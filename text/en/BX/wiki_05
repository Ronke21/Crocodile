<text>The Horizon League is a collegiate athletic conference in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I. Headquartered in Indianapolis, the league&#x27;s eleven member schools are located in and near the Great Lakes region and in part of the Southern United States.

The Horizon League founded in 1979 as the Midwestern City Conference. The conference changed its name to Midwestern Collegiate Conference in 1985 and then the Horizon League in 2001. The conference started with a membership of six teams and has fluctuated in size with 24 different schools as members at different times. The league currently has 11 members.

The Horizon League currently sponsors 19 sports and is a non-football conference.

==History==

===Foundation (1978–1979)===
In May 1978, DePaul University hosted a meeting with representatives from Bradley, Dayton, Detroit, Illinois State, Loyola–Chicago, Air Force, and Xavier who all agreed in principle that a new athletic conference was needed. Further progress was made through a series of early 1979 meetings in San Francisco, Chicago, and St. Louis that included participation by Butler, Creighton, Marquette, and Oral Roberts. On June 16, 1979, the Midwestern City Conference (nicknamed the MCC or Midwestern City 6) was formed by charter members Butler, Evansville, Loyola, Oklahoma City, Oral Roberts, and Xavier, with Detroit joining the following year. , Detroit, now known as Detroit Mercy, is the only remaining member from the league&#x27;s original members.

=== Maturity (1980–1992) ===

In 1980, the league established its headquarters in Champaign, Illinois. The MCC gained an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament in 1981, followed by the announcement that Saint Louis University would be joining the following season. The University of Notre Dame joined the conference for all sports except basketball and football in 1982. The conference attained automatic qualification for the NCAA Division I Baseball Championship in 1984 and the conference moved its headquarters to Indianapolis. Three changes occurred in the summer of 1985: Oklahoma City dropped out of the NCAA altogether; the conference name was altered slightly to Midwestern Collegiate Conference; and the conference began sponsoring women&#x27;s athletics. The latter triggered Notre Dame&#x27;s temporary withdrawal from the league as its women&#x27;s teams were contracted to the North Star Conference. ESPN began televising the MCC Championship game in 1986. In 1987, Oral Roberts left the conference while Dayton joined and Notre Dame rejoined. The conference earned its first at-large bid to the men&#x27;s basketball tournament and automatic qualification to the NCAA Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship in 1989. In 1991, the conference received an automatic bid to the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament and lost members Marquette and Saint Louis. Duquesne and La Salle joined the MCC in 1992, the same year the conference gained an automatic berth to the NCAA Women&#x27;s Volleyball Championship. Duquesne and Dayton left the conference in 1993.

=== Modern era (1990–present) ===

The largest non-merger conference expansion in NCAA history up to that time occurred on December 9, 1993, when Cleveland State, UIC, Northern Illinois, Green Bay, Milwaukee, and Wright State left the Mid-Continent Conference to join the Midwestern Collegiate Conference beginning with the 1994–95 academic year. With Evansville&#x27;s departure to the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC), there were 12 league members. Xavier, Notre Dame, and La Salle withdrew the following summer of 1995, followed by Northern Illinois in 1997. The conference changed its name to the Horizon League on June 4, 2001, in part due to the initials causing confusion between the MCC and the Mid-Continent Conference, who also used the initials. That year, Youngstown State University joined from the Mid-Con, and on May 17, 2006, Valparaiso University announced it would do the same in 2007.
In April 2013, the split of the original Big East Conference caused a ripple effect that fell to the Horizon League; Loyola announced that it would leave the Horizon League effective July 1 to join the Missouri Valley Conference, which itself lost Creighton to the reconfigured Big East.

Butler also left the Horizon League. It spent a season in the Atlantic 10 before joining the Big East.

The Horizon announced that Oakland University, formerly of the Summit League, would immediately replace Loyola within a month.

The next change in the Horizon League&#x27;s membership came in 2015 with the arrival of Northern Kentucky University from the Atlantic Sun Conference.

Two more membership changes were announced near the end of the 2016–17 school year. First, Valparaiso announced on May 25, 2017, that it would leave for the MVC effective July 1. The Crusaders replaced Wichita State, which announced that it would leave the MVC for the American Athletic Conference. Three days before Valparaiso&#x27;s departure, the Horizon League Board of Directors unanimously approved the membership of Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) to replace Valparaiso, also effective July 1. IUPUI was dissolved in 2024 and replaced by separate institutions affiliated with the Indiana University and Purdue University systems. At that time, the athletic program transferred to the new Indiana University Indianapolis with an athletic brand name of IU Indy, maintaining IUPUI&#x27;s Division I and Horizon League memberships.

The start of the 2020s set further membership changes into motion, with the arrivals of Purdue Fort Wayne and Robert Morris from the Summit League and the Northeast Conference (NEC), respectively, announced on August 5, 2019 and June 15, 2020. This brought the Horizon League up to 12 full-time members for the first time since the 1994–95 season. It was short-lived, however, as the UIC Flames were reported to be following many of their former conference colleagues to the MVC effective July 1, 2022.

On July 6, 2022, the Horizon League and Ohio Valley Conference (OVC) jointly announced that they would merge their men&#x27;s tennis leagues under the Horizon banner, effective immediately. The five OVC members that sponsored the sport became Horizon associates. At the same time, the Horizon announced that Belmont, which had just left the OVC for the Missouri Valley Conference (which sponsors tennis only for women), would become a men&#x27;s tennis associate, and Chicago State, which became a D-I independent after leaving the Western Athletic Conference days earlier, would become an associate in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis. The Horizon later lost men&#x27;s associate Lindenwood after they dropped nine NCAA sports, including men&#x27;s tennis, after the 2023–24 season. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s associate Chicago State also announced it would join the Northeast Conference, which sponsors the sport for both sexes — however, CSU announced that it would keep its tennis programs in the Horizon for one extra year before moving them to the NEC for the 2025–26 season.

On February 24, 2025, multiple media reports indicated that Northern Illinois was set to rejoin the Horizon League in 2026, coinciding with NIU football becoming an affiliate member of the Mountain West Conference. The move became official on February 27, after approval by NIU&#x27;s governing board.

Prior to the 2023–24 academic year, the conference announced a brand refresh with the introduction of a new secondary logo. The logo is a gold stylized H that incorporates the arch of the conference&#x27;s primary logo and a number one to symbolize unity. The logo was promoted to primary status ahead of the 2024-25 academic year.

, eight of the 11 full Horizon League members are former members of the Mid-Con (now known as the Summit League), with the exceptions being Detroit Mercy, Northern Kentucky, and Robert Morris.

== Broadcasting rights ==
In 2006, the conference launched the Horizon League Network (HLN) as the centerpiece of a revamped web portal. The digital network aired over 200 live events free on the league&#x27;s official website at the time.

The Horizon League and WebStream Productions launched a completely redesigned HLN website in September 2009. The site serves as a portal to hundreds of live and on-demand videos while giving its users the ability to interact on an array of social media platforms.

The Horizon League Network migrated to ESPN3 in 2014, and over 700 events streamed live in 2015–16. Horizon League coverage was absorbed into ESPN+, along with other mid-major conferences, in 2018. The conference extended its deal with ESPN in 2021. Over 500 events are aired on ESPN+ annually, along with select men&#x27;s basketball games airing on ESPN2 and ESPNU and the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball championships airing on ESPN and ESPNU.

Basketball games not selected for broadcast on national linear television are often televised by regional sports networks and over-the-air channels within the teams’ home markets. In recent years, WMYD Detroit, Marquee Sports Network, Bally Sports Ohio, Bally Sports Great Lakes, Bally Sports Wisconsin, and SportsNet Pittsburgh have broadcast multiple men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball contests.

==Men&#x27;s basketball==

===Horizon League men&#x27;s basketball tournament champions===
===Historic===
From 1995 to 2011, the Horizon League sent an impressive 24 qualifiers (7 At-Large berths) to the Men&#x27;s NCAA basketball tournament, making the Horizon League one of the most prolific mid-major (non-power 6) conferences in all of college basketball. Even more impressively, those 24 clubs produced 22 wins in that span, including five &quot;Sweet 16&quot; appearances, making the Horizon League the only non-BCS conference to have Sweet 16 participants in five NCAA tournaments during that span (2003, 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011). Four schools from the conference have produced &quot;modern-day&quot; Sweet 16 appearances – Loyola (1985), Xavier (1990), Butler (2003, 2007, 2010 and 2011), and Milwaukee (2005). The Horizon League also compiled a 19–12 record in the NCAA tournament from 2003 to 2011, ranking tops among all 32 NCAA Division I conferences for winning percentage (.613) in March Madness during that span. This historic stretch of conference dominance was thanks to NCAA Tournament wins from Butler (15), Milwaukee (3), and Cleveland State (1) . Butler appeared in the men&#x27;s national championship game in both 2010 and 2011. Since the NCAA began seeding teams in 1979, Loyola&#x27;s 4 seed in the 1985 tournament is the best for a Horizon League team. The Horizon League currently holds the best winning percentage among non-BCS conferences in the men&#x27;s NCAA basketball Tournament (.488, 7th overall amongst the 32 Division I conferences).

One former Horizon League member claims a national championship from the era before the league&#x27;s creation. In the 1963 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, Loyola defeated two-time defending champ Cincinnati. Before post-season tournaments determined champions, former Horizon member Butler claimed national titles in 1924 and 1929.

The League hosted the men&#x27;s Final Four in 1991, 1997, 2000, 2006, 2009 and 2010. It also hosted the women&#x27;s Final Four in 2005 and 2007. Horizon League commissioner Jonathan B. LeCrone, who is in his 17th year as league commissioner, just finished a five-year term on the NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball Committee.

===2000s===
As stated on their official website, the recent success of Horizon League athletic teams on the national stage heightened the visibility of the league and its member schools and quickly moved it closer toward its stated goal of becoming one of the nation&#x27;s top 10 Division I NCAA athletic conferences.

====2002–03====
In the 2003 NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, the Horizon League entered two teams for the first time since 1998. Milwaukee, who earned a 12 seed in its first bid to the tournament since joining the conference, lost by one point to Notre Dame in the first round. Butler, who earned both an at-large bid and a 12 seed, made its fifth tournament appearance in seven years. The Bulldogs made it to the Sweet 16 with victories over No. 20 (5 seed) Mississippi State and No. 14 (4 seed) Louisville before falling to No. 3 (1 seed) Oklahoma in the East Regional. The Bulldogs finished the year ranked No. 21 in the final ESPN/USA Today Top 25 Poll.

====2004–05====
In the men&#x27;s 2005 NCAA basketball tournament, the Horizon League enjoyed one of its best showings ever as 12 seed Milwaukee marched to the Sweet 16 with victories over No. 19 (5 seed) Alabama and No. 14 (4 seed) Boston College before they fell to then-No. 1 and eventual tournament runner-up Illinois. Milwaukee ranked as high as No. 23 in the March 7 ESPN/USA Today Top 25 Poll.

====2005–06====
In the 2006 NCAA basketball tournament, 11 seed Milwaukee once again advanced in the Tournament by upsetting the No. 20 (6 seed) Oklahoma 82–74. The Panthers, led by first year head coach Rob Jeter, fell to eventual national champion No. 11 (AP)/No. 10 (ESPN) (3 seed) Florida in the second round of the tournament. The league had a team advance past the first round for the second straight year and third time in the last four years.

====2006–07====
In the 2006–07 basketball season, Butler won the Preseason NIT tournament in Madison Square Garden with wins over in-state rivals Notre Dame and Indiana in the NIT&#x27;s Midwest regional bracket, followed by wins over No. 21 Tennessee and No. 23 Gonzaga in the NIT Final Four in Madison Square Garden. Later, the Bulldogs claimed victory over Purdue in the Wooden Tradition. On February 5, 2007, Butler became the first school in Horizon League history to rank in the Top 10 of the national college basketball polls, as the Bulldogs reached No. 9 and No. 10 in the ESPN/USA Today and AP polls, respectively. The Bulldogs ended their season with a No. 21 ranking in the final AP poll, a 5 seed in the NCAA tournament and a Sweet 16 berth by beating Old Dominion and Maryland before losing to eventual national champion Florida. Wright State also qualified for the NCAA tournament as the winner of the Horizon League tournament championship and tying Butler for the regular season championship. As a 14 seed, the Raiders fell to No. 13 (AP)/No. 11 (ESPN) (3 seed) Pittsburgh in the first round.

====2007–08====
During the 2007–08 basketball season, Butler won the Great Alaska Shootout with wins over Michigan, Virginia Tech and Texas Tech, and also claimed wins over Ohio State and Florida State, extending their record against BCS schools to 10–1 since the start of the 2006–07 season. As a 7 seed in the 2008 NCAA basketball tournament, the Bulldogs beat 10 seed South Alabama before falling in overtime to No. 5 (AP)/No. 4 (ESPN) (2 seed) Tennessee. Butler finished the season ranked No. 11 in the AP poll and No. 14 in the ESPN/USA Today poll. Cleveland State also earned a 6 seed in the NIT, losing in the first round to Dayton.

====2008–09====
Starting in 2009, regional convenience store and gas station chain Speedway served as the title sponsor of the conference tournament that Cleveland State won and earned the Horizon League&#x27;s automatic bid to the NCAA Tourney while Butler earned an at-large bid. Butler, a 9 seed, lost in the first round to LSU while 13 seed Cleveland State upset No. 8 (AP)/No. 9 (ESPN) (4 seed) Wake Forest 84–69 (and achieved the third biggest upset in NCAA history winning by 15 points) and shocked the nation in the first round of play before falling to 12 seed Arizona in the second round of tournament play. Butler finished the season ranked No. 22 in the final AP poll and No. 25 in the final ESPN/USA Today poll.

====2009–10====
After defeating No. 25 (12 seed) UTEP, (13 seed) Murray State and No. 4 (1 seed) Syracuse, the No. 8 (ESPN)/No. 11 (AP) (5 seed) Butler men&#x27;s team defeated No. 7 Kansas State, the 2 seed in the West, by a score of 63–56 to advance to their first Final Four. After beating the No. 12 (ESPN)/No. 13 (AP) (5 seed) Michigan State Spartans 52–50 in the national semifinals, Butler played in Indianapolis against the South Regional Champions, No. 3 (1 seed) Duke for the NCAA Division I National Championship. Butler lost what many call the most thrilling college basketball game in a generation, losing 61–59 in a game that came down to the final play. This is the farthest any team has reached in the tournament while a member of the Horizon League. Butler was the first Division I men&#x27;s team to play in the Final Four in its hometown since UCLA in 1972, and the first of either sex since Texas played in the 1987 Women&#x27;s Final Four on its home court.

Also of note, former Milwaukee head coach Bruce Pearl coached the Tennessee Volunteers to the Elite Eight and narrowly lost the opportunity to play Butler by losing to Michigan State, who Butler beat in the Final Four.

====2010–11====
Butler once again represented the Horizon League in the tournament with another very strong showing. As an 8 seed, Butler defeated (9 seed) Old Dominion, narrowly upset Pittsburgh (who was No. 1 ranked and seeded), Wisconsin (4 seed) and Florida (2 seed) to return to the Final Four. Butler faced VCU, an 11 seed Cinderella team who unexpectedly reached the Final Four as the first team to play five tournament games to reach the Final Four, due to VCU&#x27;s participation in the inaugural First Four Round. After Butler defeated VCU 70–62, the Bulldogs were in the national championship game for the second consecutive season. This time they faced Connecticut at Reliant Stadium in Houston. The Huskies were too much for the Butler Bulldogs to handle, as Butler lost the game 53–41 in an unusually low-scoring national championship game. This made Butler national runner-up for the second straight season.

====2011–12====
In the 2012 postseason, the Detroit Titans won their first Horizon League Championship since 1999 under head coach Ray McCallum. They defeated top seeded Valparaiso 70–50. The tournament MVP was son Ray McCallum, Jr.

====2012–13====
Valparaiso was the regular season champion of the Horizon for the second straight year. It defeated Wright State 62–54 in the championship game under coach Bryce Drew for its first Horizon League Championship. This was the first season that the league was absent of Butler, who departed for the Atlantic 10.

====2013–14====
Green Bay won the regular season championship in 2014. It was upset by Milwaukee in the tournament semi-final. Milwaukee would go on to win the tournament, knocking off Wright State.

====2014–15====
Following a good outcome, finishing as the 2014 champions, the Milwaukee Panthers were banned from the 2015 NCAA Tournament and postseason play. Valparaiso won the regular and postseason championships. It entered the NCAA tournament as a 13th seed, although losing in the first round.

====2015–16====
The 2015 season ushered in the arrival of the Northern Kentucky Norse to the league, who departed from the Atlantic Sun Conference. Valparaiso won the regular season championship again but was defeated by Green Bay in the tournament championship 78–69.

====2023-2024====
The Oakland University Golden Grizzles won the conference tournament in 2024 after finishing in the bottom half of the regular season standings. Coach Greg Kampe led his 14th seeded Golden Grizzles to a win over 3rd seed Kentucky in the first round of the NCAA tournament.

==Other sports==
The Milwaukee baseball team made national headlines during the 1999 College World Series by upsetting No. 1 ranked Rice in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. In the 2004–05 academic year, Milwaukee&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer team defeated 16th-ranked San Francisco, while Detroit upset Michigan in women&#x27;s soccer in their respective NCAA tournaments. Also that year, Butler&#x27;s men&#x27;s cross country team finished fourth in the nation at the NCAA Cross-Country Championships, and their own Victoria Mitchell became the first Horizon League athlete to win an individual national title when she captured the 3,000 Meter Steeplechase at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships. Green Bay also upset 6th-ranked Oregon State in the opening round of the NCAA softball tournament.

Although the league does not sponsor football, current members Robert Morris and Youngstown State play in Division I FCS. Youngstown State plays in the Missouri Valley Football Conference; Robert Morris originally planned to play the 2020–21 season as an independent and join Big South Conference football in July 2021, but COVID-19 issues led the Big South to bring Robert Morris into its football league for its rescheduled spring 2021 season.

<text>Donald George Revie (10 July 1927 – 26 May 1989) was an English footballer and manager. He is best known for managing Leeds United from 1961 until 1974, winning the Football League First Division twice and the FA Cup once, before being the England national football team manager for three years.

A forward, he began his career with Leicester City in August 1944, before a £19,000 move to Hull City in November 1949. He was sold on to Manchester City in October 1951 for a fee of £25,000, where he became the main focus of the &quot;Revie Plan&quot; which saw him named as FWA Footballer of the Year in the 1954–55 season, after innovating the role of the first deep-lying centre forward in England. He won the FA Cup in 1956, having finished on the losing side in the 1955 final. He was bought by Sunderland for £22,000 in October 1956 before moving on to Leeds United in November 1958 for a £14,000 fee. In total, he scored 108 goals in 501 league and cup appearances in an 18-year professional career, also scoring four goals in six England appearances, as well as winning representative honours for the Football League XI and the England B team.

In March 1961, Revie was appointed player-manager of Leeds United, then a Second Division club that had never won a major trophy. Under Revie&#x27;s management, Leeds became a major force in English football, winning the Second Division in the 1963–64 season, the First Division in the 1968–69 and 1973–74 seasons, the FA Cup in 1972, the League Cup in 1968, the FA Charity Shield in 1969, and the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in 1968 and 1971. Additionally, Leeds were First Division runners-up five times, three times FA Cup runners-up and runners-up in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. In July 1974, he accepted the job as the England manager. He had an unsuccessful three years in the role before quitting in highly controversial circumstances to take the management role with the United Arab Emirates. He later had spells in Middle Eastern club football with Al-Nasr and Al-Ahly.

As Leeds manager, he was criticised for his teams&#x27; physical and often negative approach, though the period was noted for its highly physical football across the country. His resignation as England manager fuelled criticism of him as money-obsessed, and unproved allegations of bribery and financial misconduct tarnished his reputation. He retired in 1984 but was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in May 1987, which led to his death two years later. He remains a highly popular figure in Leeds and has a stand named after him at Elland Road and a statue outside the ground.

==Early life==
Revie was born in Middlesbrough, North Riding of Yorkshire, on Sunday, 10 July 1927. His father, also named Donald, was a joiner who found himself frequently out of work during the Great Depression. His mother, a washerwoman, died of cancer on 27 November 1939, aged 50. He played youth football for Newport Boys&#x27; Club and then Middlesbrough Swifts, who were coached by influential manager Bill Sanderson. He learnt the rudiments of the game using a small bundle of rags in the tiny yard behind his home. This influenced his thinking in later life, and he argued that young players should learn using smaller footballs on smaller pitches so they would be more adept in control when progressing to a bigger football.

==Club career==
===Leicester City===
He signed as a professional footballer for Leicester City in August 1944, choosing them ahead of local club Middlesbrough primarily due to the close links between Middlesbrough Swifts and Leicester City; he also worked as an apprentice bricklayer. Leicester originally thought he was not good enough to turn professional, but he was taken under the wing of Leicester player Sep Smith, who mentored Revie on many of his ideas about the game. Smith instructed Revie that &quot;When not in position, get into position; never beat a man by dribbling if you can beat him more easily with a pass; it is not the man on the ball but the one running into position to take the pass who constitutes the danger; and the aim is to have a man spare in a passing move. Soccer would then become easy.&quot; He played in the wartime league before making his debut in the Football League on the opening day of the 1946–47 season, a 3–0 defeat to Manchester City, who would go on to win the Second Division that season. He showed good form at Filbert Street before breaking his right ankle in three places after a tackle from Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s Ron Burgess; the injury could have ended his career, but he recovered to full fitness within 19 weeks.

Manager Johnny Duncan identified Revie as the player to build his team around for the 1947–48 and 1948–49 seasons, and though the &quot;Foxes&quot; fared poorly in the league they managed to reach the 1949 FA Cup final. Revie scored the opening goal of the semi-final victory over First Division champions Portsmouth, having been told pre-match that opposition goalkeeper Ernest Butler tended to palm the ball over the attacker&#x27;s head before reclaiming possession Revie positioned himself to take advantage of the situation when teammate Jack Lee challenged Butler for the ball, leaving Revie with a simple conversion. However Revie suffered a nasal haemorrhage caused by a burst vein one week before the final, and the condition became so severe it would threaten his life and see him miss his first chance to play at Wembley. He could only listen on the radio as Leicester lost 3–1 to Wolverhampton Wanderers in the final. Revie left Leicester after Duncan left the club, having already been dissatisfied with the club&#x27;s lack of progress in the league.

===Hull City===
In November 1949, he joined Second Division club Hull City for a transfer fee of £19,000. He chose to join the &quot;Tigers&quot; ahead of bigger clubs like Arsenal and Manchester City, who had shown interest in signing him since Hull were managed by Raich Carter, who had been a great player before and after World War II. Carter did improve Revie&#x27;s game but was not a success as Hull manager, as City finished mid-table in the 1949–50 and 1950–51 seasons, before becoming involved in a relegation battle in the 1951–52 season. Teammate Andy Davidson later said Revie failed to fulfil his potential at Boothferry Park as he was not a tough player. The rest of the Hull team were not physically dominant enough to protect him and allow him to dictate play with his accurate passing. As at Leicester, Revie felt the time had come for him to move on and handed in a transfer request once Carter departed.

===Manchester City===
Revie was sold to First Division side Manchester City for £25,000 (including a part-exchange for Ernie Phillips, valued at £12,000) in October 1951. The &quot;Citizens&quot; struggled in the 1951–52 season and then went on to finish just one place above the relegation zone in the 1952–53 campaign. Revie was often isolated from the rest of the team due to his lack of pace. The sale of Ivor Broadis then allowed Revie to drop deeper down the field and allowed manager Les McDowall to put Revie in what eventually proved to be a pivotal role, introducing to English football the position of deep-lying centre forward. This evolved into the so-called &quot;Revie Plan&quot;, with Revie as the central figure. His role derived from the more traditional inside right position and was based on the style of the successful Hungary national team, and in particular Nándor Hidegkuti, who invented the role. Revie devoted 20 pages to analysing and explaining the plan in his autobiography &quot;Soccer&#x27;s Happy Wanderer&quot; written in 1955.

Revie had improved his goal tally to 13 in the 1953–54 season, but only once the Revie Plan was implemented in the 1954–55 campaign were Manchester City able to fully make use of his abilities. The new tactic opened with a 5–0 defeat to Preston North End, but then Ken Barnes replaced John McTavish at inside-forward and the team clicked. Though the tactic was named after Revie, it had initially been introduced at the reserve team level by Johnny Williamson. However, Revie&#x27;s superior passing talents meant Williamson was overlooked for the position at first team level. City&#x27;s league title campaign fell away, but they went on to reach the 1955 FA Cup final at Wembley, where they were beaten 3–1 by Newcastle United; a first-half injury to Jimmy Meadows left City down to ten men and unable to compete effectively. At the end of the season, Revie was named as FWA Footballer of the Year.

McDowall fined Revie £27 for missing two weeks of training for a family holiday in Blackpool, which infuriated him as he had received permission from trainer Laurie Barnett and had promised to train whilst on holiday. McDowall dropped Revie for much of the 1955–56 season, preferring instead to play Bobby Johnstone. Revie played only one FA Cup match that season before being named in the team for the 1956 FA Cup final against Birmingham City, with Johnstone being moved to the wings. He provided the assist for Joe Hayes&#x27;s opening goal and instructed Ken Barnes to deviate from the manager&#x27;s instructions at half-time, with the result being a more dominant second half display and a 3–1 victory; Revie was named as Man of the Match. However the rift with his manager was not forgotten, and he was moved to right-half in the 1956–57 campaign, leaving him to seek a move away from Maine Road.

===Sunderland===
In October 1956, Sunderland manager Bill Murray bought Revie for a £22,000 fee. Poor results left the &quot;Black Cats&quot; facing relegation towards the end of the 1956–57 campaign, but a late seven-game unbeaten run lifted them to safety, just one place above relegated Cardiff City. A financial scandal over illegal payments to players resulted in harsh sanctions at Roker Park from The Football Association and forced Murray&#x27;s resignation. His replacement, Alan Brown, preferred a more physical style of play that did not suit Revie. Sunderland suffered relegation from the First Division for the first time in the club&#x27;s history in the 1957–58 season, and Revie was dropped for the 1958–59 Second Division campaign in favour of a youth policy. In September 1958, he rejected the opportunity to sign for hometown club Middlesbrough – had he joined the club then he would have played alongside captain Brian Clough and goalkeeper Peter Taylor.

===Leeds United===
Revie returned to the First Division when he joined Leeds United in November 1958 for a £14,000 fee. Manager Bill Lambton had hoped that Revie&#x27;s creativity would help the &quot;Peacocks&quot; to turn their poor form around and appointed him as captain. Leeds avoided relegation in the 1958–59 season, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959–60 campaign with the division&#x27;s worst defensive record. Revie recognised his playing days were coming to an end and relinquished the captaincy to Freddie Goodwin.

==International career==
In October 1953, he was called up to The Football League XI to face the League of Ireland XI at Maine Road, and scored a hat-trick in a 9–1 victory. He went on to play for the England B team in March 1954. He scored on his England debut on 2 October 1954, in a 2–0 British Home Championship victory over Northern Ireland at Windsor Park. He also scored during his second appearance on 2 April 1955, a 7–2 victory over Scotland at Wembley Stadium. He made three further appearances that year, playing in defeats to France at the Stade Olympique Yves-du-Manoir and Wales at Ninian Park, and scoring twice in a 5–1 win over Denmark at Idrætsparken. His sixth and final cap came in a 1–1 draw with Northern Ireland on 6 October 1956.

He was one of many signatories in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; on 17 July 1958, opposing &quot;the policy of apartheid&quot; in international sport and defending &quot;the principle of racial equality which is embodied in the Declaration of the Olympic Games&quot;.

==Management career==
===Leeds United===
Revie was made player-manager at Leeds United in March 1961 following the resignation of Jack Taylor, who left after Leeds found themselves struggling in the Second Division. He had initially applied for the vacant job at Bournemouth &amp; Boscombe Athletic, but they were unable to find the £6,000 Leeds demanded, and the Leeds directors decided to appoint Revie as manager instead. At the time the club was in debt and was located in a rugby league territory, with very little football tradition. Fewer than 7,000 turned out for the final home game of the 1960–61 season, while Leeds Rhinos&#x27; championship game of the 1960–61 Rugby League season had an attendance of over 50,000. He immediately began to institute radical changes, such as ensuring the players stayed at higher-quality hotels. He instilled a &quot;family atmosphere&quot; at Elland Road, making sure to take an interest in the lives of everyone at the club, from the cleaning staff to the star players and ensuring there were no &quot;big egos&quot; at the club. He showed trust in his players, leaving them mainly to their own devices, though he always made sure he was fully informed as to what they were up to off the pitch, even going so far as to tell them to dump their girlfriends if he viewed them as unsuitable. He also introduced lengthy dossiers on opposing teams to ensure his players knew every detail about the opposition and were able to exploit weaknesses and nullify threats. Other changes were based on some of his many superstitions, such as his belief that birds were bad luck which resulted in him getting rid of the owl on the club badge and the discontinuation of the &quot;Peacocks&quot; nickname in favour of the &quot;Whites&quot;.

Leeds struggled in the 1961–62 season, as aside from Billy Bremner and Jack Charlton, his playing squad was filled with journeymen pros; he did though inherit a good coaching staff that included Les Cocker, Maurice Lindley and Syd Owen who would all spend many years with Revie at Leeds. He developed a youth policy at the club, notable graduates of which would be Eddie Gray, Norman Hunter, Peter Lorimer and Paul Reaney. He had a difficult task in persuading young players to join Leeds over more glamorous clubs. Still, he made sure he put in extra effort to make the youngsters feel happy at Leeds, and in one instance, drove to Scotland to talk to Bremner&#x27;s girlfriend to successfully persuade her to encourage Bremner to stay at Leeds rather than return to Scotland to be with her. Revie played his last game in March 1962 before concentrating entirely on management.

After new investment at board level, Revie was able to spend £25,000 on Everton&#x27;s Scotland international Bobby Collins, who he installed as captain. Other arrivals included former Manchester City teammate Billy McAdams, forward Ian Lawson and left-back Cliff Mason. He spent £53,000 to bring John Charles back from Juventus. Though he proved not to be as effective as during his first spell at Leeds, Revie was able to sell him on to Roma for a £17,000 profit within just a few months. Leeds pushed for promotion in 1962–63, but the harsh winter caused many postponements and a backlog of games at the end of the season proved too much for Leeds, who fell away to finish in fifth place.

United secured promotion as champions of the Second Division in the 1963–64 season, helped by the late signing of striker Alan Peacock from Middlesbrough for £53,000. However, the overly physical approach typified by captain Collins earned Leeds a reputation as &quot;dirty&quot; that would shadow the club throughout Revie&#x27;s tenure as manager and continue to this day. Leeds adapted well to the First Division early in the 1964–65 campaign but caused controversy in Collins&#x27;s return to Goodison Park as the game against Everton descended into a brawl. The referee ordered the players off the field after 35 minutes to prevent further violence. Leeds went on to maintain a strong title challenge, finishing second to rivals Manchester United on goal average after failing to beat Birmingham City on the last day of the season. They also reached the final of the FA Cup, losing 2–1 to Liverpool at Wembley after extra-time.

Revie felt he did not have to strengthen his squad for the 1965–66 campaign, and made no new signings. With Leeds in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup he showed his gamesmanship, sending his team out against Italian club Torino wearing unfamiliar numbers in an attempt to confuse the Italian club&#x27;s tight man-marking system. However, Collins had his leg broken by Torino&#x27;s Fabrizio Poletti, meaning Revie had to partner Giles and Bremner in central midfield and sign Huddersfield Town winger Michael O&#x27;Grady for £30,000. Although Collins would be missed, the partnership of Giles and Bremner would prove highly effective. Leeds again finished second in the league, trailing Liverpool by six points. They reached the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, losing on aggregate to Spanish side Real Zaragoza despite Revie ordering the fire brigade to flood the pitch before the replay at Elland Road.

Leeds struggled at the start of the 1966–67 season, though despite winning just three of their opening eleven games, they finished in fourth place. They reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup, losing 1–0 to Chelsea at Villa Park. They reached the final of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup against Yugoslavian side Dinamo Zagreb, but were unable to scout the opposition due to Syd Owen having his flight cancelled on him; Leeds lost 2–0 on aggregate and Revie was criticised for his negative tactics.

With his team coming close but failing to land a trophy, he brought in a gypsy to lift a curse he believed had been placed on Elland Road so that there would be no bad luck for the 1967–68 season. A more practical measure he took to increase United&#x27;s fortunes was to nearly double the club&#x27;s record transfer to buy Sheffield United centre-forward Mick Jones for £100,000, who would replace the frequently injured Peacock as the main striker. Soon after the purchase, Leeds recorded a 7–0 victory over Chelsea, though ironically, Jones was not on the score sheet. Revie&#x27;s first trophy would be the League Cup, as they eliminated Luton Town, Bury, Sunderland, Stoke City and Derby County to reach the final against Arsenal; Terry Cooper scored the only goal of what was a dour and tense final as Revie told his players to &quot;shut up shop&quot; and defend their 1–0 lead. This success did not immediately translate into league and FA Cup success, however, as they finished in fourth place and were beaten in the FA Cup semi-finals by Everton. They instead reached a second successive Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final, beating Spora (Luxembourg), Partizan (Yugoslavia), Hibernian (Scotland), Rangers (Scotland), and Dundee (Scotland) to reach the final against Hungarian club Ferencvárosi. Leeds won the first leg 1–0 and a month later defended their lead with a 0–0 draw in Budapest, by which time Jimmy Greenhoff, a substitute in the first leg, had been sold to Birmingham City.

Having found success in domestic and European cup competitions, Revie focused exclusively on the league for the 1968–69 campaign. They went the rest of the season unbeaten in the league following a 5–1 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor on 19 October, and secured the title with a 0–0 draw with challengers Liverpool at Anfield; after the game Revie led his team back out onto the pitch to applaud the Liverpool supporters, who in turn applauded the Leeds team. His team set several records: most points (67), most wins (27), fewest defeats (2), and most home points (39); a still-unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten run that extended into the following season.

Revie strengthened his front line by breaking the British transfer record with a £165,000 purchase of Allan Clarke from Leicester City, who would partner Mick Jones up front. This allowed him to sell O&#x27;Grady to Wolverhampton Wanderers for £80,000 and move Lorimer to a more attacking role. He targeted the treble in 1969–70 and came close to achieving his aim only to fail on all three fronts in a congested close season, finishing second in the league to Everton, losing the 1970 FA Cup final to Chelsea (after a replay), and exiting the European Cup with a semi-final defeat to Celtic in front of a competition record crowd of 136,505 at Hampden Park.

Rejecting a £100,000 four-year contract offer to manage Birmingham City, Revie elected to remain at Leeds and stick with the same squad for the 1970–71 campaign. Leeds and Arsenal soon pulled away from the rest of the pack, though it would be the Gunners who would claim the league title, finishing one point ahead of Leeds after the latter lost to West Bromwich Albion following a controversial offside goal in front of the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; television cameras late in the season. United were embarrassed in the FA Cup, being knocked out by Fourth Division side Colchester United in a famous &quot;giant-killing&quot;. Leeds again found success in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup though, beating Sarpsborg (Norway), Dynamo Dresden (East Germany), Sparta Prague (Czechoslovakia), Vitória (Portugal) and Liverpool to reach the final against Juventus. They drew 2–2 at the Stadio Olimpico di Torino before claiming the trophy on away goals after a 1–1 draw at Elland Road.

The previous season&#x27;s defeat to West Bromwich Albion led to Revie criticising referee Ray Tinkler. As punishment, Leeds were forced to play their first four home games of the 1971–72 season at a neutral venue; they played at Huddersfield&#x27;s Leeds Road and boasted four wins and two draws from the opening seven matches. Leeds played good football, particularly winning praise for their 7–0 and 6–1 wins over Southampton and Nottingham Forest respectively, but again could only finish as runners-up after a late collapse and final day defeat at Wolves, allowing Derby County to claim the title by a single point. Revie had attempted to strengthen his squad before the final run-in with a £177,000 bid for Asa Hartford, but the deal was cancelled by the medical team who spotted a heart defect in the attacker&#x27;s medical records. United reached the 1972 FA Cup final after beating Bristol Rovers, Liverpool, Cardiff City, Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City, and lifted the trophy after a 1–0 victory over Arsenal in the final.

Looking for a successor to Jack Charlton, early in the 1972–73 season, he signed Gordon McQueen from St Mirren for £30,000. He also spent £100,000 on defender Trevor Cherry and £35,000 on centre-half Roy Ellam, both from Huddersfield Town, and started playing young Scottish forward Joe Jordan more regularly. Leeds again came close to a Treble, but their league title campaign tailed off and they finished third, some seven points behind champions Liverpool. They did reach the 1973 FA Cup final to face Second Division Sunderland, but despite manager turned pundit Brian Clough&#x27;s remark that &quot;there is no way Sunderland can beat Leeds&quot;, United lost 1–0. Leeds also reached the final of the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup against Italian club A.C. Milan at the Kaftanzoglio Stadium, where they were beaten 1–0. The match saw a controversial refereeing performance from Christos Michas, which eventually saw Norman Hunter get sent off after he reacted badly to being consistently fouled by pushing Gianni Rivera to the ground. In 2009, Yorkshire and the Humber MEP Richard Corbett unsuccessfully petitioned the European Parliament to reverse the result of the match over allegations that Michas accepted a bribe from the Italian side.

Revie was offered a five-year £100,000 contract (plus £50,000 signing-on fee) by Everton in the summer, but remained with Leeds after the move broke down due to a new law introduced in Parliament that prevented wage rises to curb inflation. He chose to continue with largely the same line-up for the 1973–74 season. He told his squad that the aim for the season would be to go unbeaten throughout the campaign. Though Leeds failed to achieve this as they lost three successive games in February/March, they did secure the title with a five-point lead over Liverpool. Completely focused on the league, and finally accepting that he was asking too much of his players to try and win every competition he played weakened teams to allow an early exit from the UEFA Cup. He chose to take the job of England national football team manager ahead of leading a European Cup challenge at Leeds and breaking up the aging team he had stuck with for many years, and though he was well loved at the club he was not popular with the Leeds boardroom members, who appointed Brian Clough, a fierce critic of Revie, as his successor. Despite lasting just 44 days in the job, Clough spent more in transfer fees than Revie had in his 13 years at the club.

===England===
In July 1974, Revie accepted the offer of the England manager&#x27;s job, succeeding Alf Ramsey and caretaker-manager Joe Mercer. The Football Association, particularly Ted Croker, were impressed with Revie&#x27;s personality and ideas. He was a popular appointment with the press and supporters; noted journalist Brian Glanville wrote that &quot;Revie was the obvious choice&quot;. Revie attempted to build a relationship with the media, and also invited 81 prospective and established England players to a meeting in Manchester to make everyone feel included, where he announced that he would establish extra pay for international players as well as bonus payments for wins and draws. He held a meeting with Alan Hardaker, chairman of the Football League, but Hardaker had long resented Revie and was very reluctant to accept his proposal to rearrange league fixtures to benefit the England team. He also had difficult relationships with figures within the FA, most notoriously with chairman Sir Harold Thompson, who allegedly attempted to influence Revie&#x27;s team selections and undermine him publicly. As well as this he found difficulty in his attempts to introduce the Leeds traditions into the England camp, such as carpet bowls and bingo, which were met with resentment and disdain by some England internationals. Colin Todd stated that Revie was ill-suited to the England job, with his strengths lying in the day-to-day contact found only in club management rather than the politics and committee meetings of international management.

For UEFA Euro 1976, England were drawn in a tough qualification group including Czechoslovakia, Portugal and Cyprus, with only the winner progressing to the finals. England began the campaign well with a 3–0 victory over Czechoslovakia at Wembley, Mick Channon and Colin Bell scoring the goals. However, a 0–0 home draw with Portugal was a minor setback, despite Malcolm Macdonald scoring all the goals in a 5–0 win over Cyprus following a morale-boosting 2–0 friendly win over 1974 FIFA World Cup champions West Germany. Kevin Keegan scored the only goal of the game at the Tsirion Stadium to secure maximum points in Cyprus and leave England in a strong position going into the two tough final group games in Czechoslovakia and Portugal. Though only drawing with Wales and Northern Ireland, a 5–1 victory over Scotland secured England the 1974–75 British Home Championship title and left England in confident mood for the crucial qualifying games. However, despite Channon opening the scoring, they fell to a 2–1 defeat to the Czechoslovakians in Bratislava after playing with what was for Revie uncharacteristic attacking tactics. A 1–1 draw in Lisbon then allowed Czechoslovakia to clinch the group with a win over Cyprus. Czechoslovakia then went on to win the whole tournament. Revie was criticised for his constant changing of players during the qualifying group, particularly his decision to drop captains Emlyn Hughes and Alan Ball from his squad entirely, his mistrust of flair players like Charlie George and Alan Hudson, and his willingness to play players out of position.

With England unseeded, Revie was handed opponents for qualifying for the 1978 World Cup of Italy, Finland and Luxembourg. Only the winner would progress to the finals. Just before the campaign began, England suffered a 2–1 defeat to Scotland to finish second in the 1975–76 British Home Championship. England made heavy work of both Finland and Luxembourg, winning 4–1 away and 2–1 at home against the Finns and 5–0 at home and 2–0 away against the Luxembourgers. The failure to inflict heavier defeats on these sides was ultimately the reason why Italy qualified for the finals on goal difference alone. England fell to a 2–0 defeat in Rome, where Revie was criticised for his previously untested back four selection of Emlyn Hughes, Dave Clement, Roy McFarland, and Mick Mills; he also played Trevor Brooking out of position and surprised many by selecting Stan Bowles ahead of Stuart Pearson. Sensing that he was disliked by FA chairman Sir Harold Thompson, and with further criticism coming his way after England could only finish third in the 1976–77 British Home Championship, Revie began to look for a way out. He missed a friendly with Brazil in Rio de Janeiro for what he claimed was a scouting assignment on the Italians, when in fact he had travelled to Dubai for contract negotiations with the United Arab Emirates. Revie asked for his contract with England to be cancelled but the FA refused although they offered Revie their full support despite having already approached Bobby Robson to replace him. The game with Brazil ended in a 0–0 draw, and their tour of South America concluded with draws with Argentina and Uruguay. On 12 July 1977, Revie revealed in an exclusive to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; that he was quitting the England job to become manager of the UAE. The FA suspended Revie from football for ten years on a charge of bringing the game into disrepute; Revie contested his suspension in a lawsuit against the FA, and the court overturned the suspension after ruling that the FA had overreached its powers.

When Revie departed, England were three points behind Italy in the qualification group, with two matches remaining, including an encounter with the Italians at Wembley. Revie&#x27;s replacement Ron Greenwood led the national team to victory in both remaining matches. England thus finished level with the Italians on points but behind them on goal difference. Since only the winner of the group qualified for the finals, England missed their second consecutive World Cup tournament.

===Middle East===
His contract at the United Arab Emirates ensured him a £340,000 four-year contract, though caused irreparable damage to his reputation in England. Selling the story to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; also earned him £20,000, but only furthered the criticism that he was a &quot;mercenary&quot;. In April 1979 the UAE finished sixth in the seven-team 5th Arabian Gulf Cup in Iraq, but it was his work in helping to improve the footballing facilities in the country in the long-term that were more important, helping the UAE qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. He left the UAE coaching role in May 1980 as the UAE searched for an Arabic speaking manager. He returned to club management with Dubai club Al-Nasr of the UAE Arabian Gulf League, but was sacked in 1984 with the club sitting third in the league. The next year he had a brief stint with Egyptian Premier League club Al-Ahly of Cairo, but did not settle in Egypt and returned home to England. He was approached to replace Alan Mullery as Queens Park Rangers manager by chairman Jim Gregory, but the deal was not completed, and Revie never worked in football again.

==Personal life==
Revie married Elsie, the niece of Leicester City&#x27;s Scottish manager Johnny Duncan, on 17 October 1949. They had a son and a daughter. Elsie died of cancer on 28 March 2005 at the age of 77.

He published an autobiography, &quot;Soccer&#x27;s Happy Wanderer&quot;, in 1955. He was appointed an OBE for his services to football. In April 1974, shortly before departing from Leeds for the England job, Revie was a special guest on the TV guest show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. Revie was an active freemason attending Leodiensis Lodge No. 4029 based at Westbourne House in Otley from 1965 until his death.

===Illness and death===

After living in Surrey for two years, Revie moved to Kinross, Scotland, in 1986, where he intended to spend his retirement. He was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in May 1987. He publicly announced his illness in August of that year and made his final public appearance on 11 May 1988 at Elland Road in a wheelchair, at a charity football match held to raise money for research into the disease. He died in Murrayfield Hospital in Edinburgh on 26 May 1989, aged 61, and was cremated four days later at Warriston Crematorium in Edinburgh. Though his funeral was well attended by representatives of Leeds United and many others involved in football such as Kevin Keegan, Brian Moore, Lawrie McMenemy, Denis Law and Alex Ferguson, The Football Association did not send any representatives.

==Legacy==

The family atmosphere Revie instilled at Elland Road ensured that many Leeds United players remained friends and fiercely loyal to Revie long after their playing days had ended; his players also generally avoided financial, addiction or family problems, enjoying largely stable lives even after retirement. In May 2012, a statue of Revie was unveiled outside Elland Road. The North Stand of Elland Road is formally known as the Revie Stand.

In a survey of leading football writers, historians and academics by &quot;Total Sport&quot; magazine, Revie&#x27;s Leeds United was voted one of the 50 greatest football teams of all time. James Corbett of the Guardian wrote that Revie &quot;had been the most innovative manager of his generation&quot; and &quot;not until Arsène Wenger would a manager exert such a profound influence on his club - and the English game as a whole&quot;.

===Criticism===

====&quot;Dirty Leeds&quot;====
The combative nature of his teams earned United the moniker of &quot;dirty Leeds&quot;, as key player Eddie Gray admitted that &quot;it was brutal stuff and, definitely win-at-all-costs&quot;. Alan Peacock said that one of the attractions for joining Leeds was that he would not have to play against them and &quot;then they won&#x27;t be kicking me&quot;. In 1963 Leeds were labelled by the Football Association&#x27;s own &quot;FA News&quot; as &quot;the dirtiest [team] in the Football League&quot;. On more than one occasion referees had to order Leeds players off the pitch for a break mid-match to break up mass brawls. His teams were notorious for dour play and playing to defend 1–0 leads, though he allowed a more attacking style later in his career. Nevertheless, the unpopularity and poor reputation stuck with Leeds throughout Revie&#x27;s time as manager and afterwards. George Best said that he &quot;hated playing against them&quot; and that the only time he needed to wear shinpads was when he was playing against Leeds.

One of Revie&#x27;s most notable critics was Brian Clough, who initially gave some degree of praise to Leeds following the 1969–70 season in which Clough managed Derby County to fourth place, commenting that &quot;they have made the season&quot;. However, Clough&#x27;s attitude soon changed as the competition between their clubs intensified, and in subsequent seasons he would use his newspaper columns to attack Revie and Leeds. A particular example of this was in August 1973 in which he branded the Leeds players &quot;cheats&quot; and called for the club to be relegated to the Second Division on disciplinary grounds, though Clough would surprisingly succeed Revie as Leeds manager in 1974 in an ill-fated tenure that lasted only 44 days. In 2009, Revie was portrayed by Colm Meaney in the film &quot;The Damned United&quot;, which focused on Clough&#x27;s reign as manager of Leeds United.

====Allegations of financial misconduct====
Revie&#x27;s reputation suffered in the late 1970s after his highly controversial England resignation. Both the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and &quot;The Sunday People&quot; claimed that Revie had attempted to bribe Wolverhampton Wanderers players to lose a crucial match in May 1972. The papers quoted Wolves midfielder Danny Hegan and former Leeds United goalkeeper Gary Sprake&#x27;s claims that Revie&#x27;s captain Billy Bremner had tried to arrange a bribe. Bremner sued for libel and won £100,000 libel damages and legal costs after both Hegan and Sprake refused to repeat their allegations under oath in court. Wolves player Derek Dougan, who had scored against Leeds in the match, testified that he had heard no mention of the alleged bribes. Neither the police nor FA investigations found any evidence of wrongdoing.

Additionally, Bob Stokoe would later claim that while managing Bury on Good Friday 1962, Revie had offered him a bribe of £500 to &quot;go easy&quot; on his Leeds side who were at the time struggling against relegation to the Third Division and that he had become enraged when Revie responded to his refusal to accept the bribe by asking &quot;in that case, may I speak to your players?&quot;. Alan Ball also alleged that Revie made an illegal approach for him, and despite pocketing the £300 bribe, he signed for Everton instead of Leeds; both men were charged with bringing the game into disrepute. The allegations of corruption earned him the nickname of &quot;Don Readies&quot;. Though Mr Justice Cantley lifted the FA&#x27;s ten-year ban on Revie, during his conclusion of the case the judge said that Revie &quot;lacked candour&quot;, was &quot;greedy&quot; and &quot;prickly&quot;, focused on &quot;imagined wrongs&quot; and his resignation as England manager showed a &quot;sensational, outrageous example of disloyalty, breach of trust, discourtesy and selfishness&quot;.

<doc id="660937" wikidata="Q55401" url="?curid=660937" title="Kenji Mizoguchi">
<text>was a Japanese filmmaker who directed roughly one hundred films during his career between 1923 and 1956. His most acclaimed works include &quot;The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums&quot; (1939), &quot;The Life of Oharu&quot; (1952), &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1953), and &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; (1954), with the latter three all being awarded at the Venice International Film Festival. A recurring theme of his films was the oppression of women in historical and contemporary Japan. Together with Akira Kurosawa and Yasujirō Ozu, Mizoguchi is seen as a representative of the &quot;golden age&quot; of Japanese cinema.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Mizoguchi was born in Hongō, Tokyo, as the second of three children, to Zentaro Miguchi, a roofing carpenter, and his wife Masa. The family&#x27;s background was relatively humble until the father&#x27;s failed business venture of selling raincoats to the Japanese troops during the Russo-Japanese War. The family was forced to move to the downtown district of Asakusa and gave Mizoguchi&#x27;s older sister Suzu up for adoption, which in effect meant selling her into the geisha profession.

In 1911, Mizoguchi&#x27;s parents, too poor to continue paying for their son&#x27;s primary school training, sent him to stay with an uncle in Morioka in northern Japan for a year, where he finished primary school. His return coincided with an onset of crippling rheumatoid arthritis, which left him with a walking gait for the rest of his life. In 1913, his sister Suzu secured him an apprenticeship as a designer for a yukata manufacturer, and in 1915, after the mother&#x27;s death, she brought both her younger brothers into her own house. Mizoguchi enrolled for a course at the Aoibashi Yoga Kenkyuko art school in Tokyo, which taught Western painting techniques, and developed an interest in opera, particularly at the Royal Theatre at Akasaka where he helped the set decorators with set design and construction.

In 1917, his sister again helped him to find work, this time as an advertisement designer with the &quot;Yuishin Nippon&quot; newspaper in Kobe. The film critic Tadao Sato has pointed out a coincidence between Mizoguchi&#x27;s life in his early years and the plots of dramas, which characteristically documented the sacrifices made by geisha on behalf of the young men they were involved with. Probably because of his familial circumstances, &quot;the subject of women&#x27;s suffering is fundamental in all his work; while sacrifice – in particular, the sacrifice a sister makes for a brother – makes a key showing in a number of his films, including some of the greatest ones (&quot;Sansho the Bailiff/Sansho Dayu&quot; [1954], for example).&quot; After less than a year in Kobe, however, Mizoguchi returned &quot;to the bohemian delights of Tokyo&quot; (Mark Le Fanu). In 1920, Mizoguchi entered the film industry as an assistant director at the Nikkatsu studios in Mukojima, Tokyo. Three years later, he gave his directorial debut with &quot;Ai ni yomigaeru hi&quot; (&quot;The Resurrection of Love&quot;).

===Film career===
After the 1923 earthquake in Tokyo, Mizoguchi moved to Nikkatsu&#x27;s studios in Kyoto. His early works included remakes of German Expressionist cinema and adaptations of Eugene O&#x27;Neill and Leo Tolstoy. While working in Kyoto, he studied kabuki and noh theatre, and traditional Japanese dance and music. He was also a frequent visitor of the tea houses, dance halls and brothels in Kyoto and Osaka, which at one time resulted in a widely covered incident of him being attacked by a jealous prostitute and then-lover with a razor. His 1926 &quot;Passion of a Woman Teacher&quot; (&quot;Kyōren no onna shishō&quot;) was one of a handful of Japanese films shown in France and Germany at the time and received considerate praise, but is nowadays lost like most of his 1920s and early 1930s films. By the end of the decade, Mizoguchi directed a series of left-leaning &quot;tendency films&quot;, including &quot;Tokyo March&quot; and &quot;Metropolitan Symphony&quot; (&quot;Tokai kokyōkyoku&quot;). 

In 1932, Mizoguchi left Nikkatsu and worked for a variety of studios and production companies. &quot;The Water Magician&quot; (1933) and &quot;Orizuru Osen&quot; (1935) were melodramas based on stories by Kyōka Izumi, depicting women who sacrifice themselves to secure a poor young man&#x27;s education. Both have been cited as early examples of his recurring theme of female concerns and &quot;one-scene-one-shot&quot; camera technique, which would become his trademark. The 1936 diptych of &quot;Osaka Elegy&quot; and &quot;Sisters of the Gion&quot;, about modern young women (moga) rebelling against their surroundings, is considered to be his early masterpiece. Mizoguchi himself named these two films as the works with which he achieved artistic maturity. &quot;Osaka Elegy&quot; was also his first full sound film, and marked the beginning of his long collaboration with screenwriter Yoshikata Yoda.

1939, the year when Mizoguchi became president of the Directors Guild of Japan, saw the release of &quot;The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums&quot;, which is regarded by many critics as his major pre-war, if not his best work. Here, a young woman supports her partner&#x27;s struggle to achieve artistic maturity as a kabuki actor at the price of her health.

During World War II, Mizoguchi made a series of films whose patriotic nature seemed to support the war effort. The most famous of these is a retelling of the classic samurai tale &quot;The 47 Ronin&quot; (1941–42), an epic jidaigeki (historical drama). While some historians see these as works which he had been pressured into, others believe him to have acted voluntarily. Fellow screenwriter Matsutarō Kawaguchi went as far as, in a 1964 interview for , calling Mizoguchi (whom he otherwise held in high regard) an &quot;opportunist&quot; in his art who followed the currents of the time, veering from the left to the right to finally become a democrat. 

1941 also saw the permanent hospitalisation of his wife Chieko (m. 1927), whom he erroneously believed to have contracted venereal disease.

===International recognition===

During the early post-war years following the country&#x27;s defeat, Mizoguchi directed a series of films concerned with the oppression of women and female emancipation both in historical (mostly the Meiji era) and contemporary settings. All of these were written or co-written by Yoda, and often starred Kinuyo Tanaka, who remained his regular leading actress until 1954, when both fell out with each other over Mizoguchi&#x27;s attempt to prevent her from directing her first own film. &quot;Utamaro and His Five Women&quot; (1946) was a notable exception of an Edo era jidaigeki film made during the Occupation, as this genre was seen as being inherently nationalistic or militaristic by the Allied censors. Of his works of this period, &quot;Flame of My Love&quot; (1949) has repeatedly been pointed out for its unflinching presentation of its subject. Tanaka plays a young teacher who leaves her traditionalist milieu to strive for her goal of female liberation, only to find out that her allegedly progressive partner still nourishes the accustomed attitude of male preeminence.

Mizoguchi returned to feudal era settings with &quot;The Life of Oharu&quot; (1952), &quot;Ugetsu&quot; (1953) and &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; (1954), which won him international recognition, in particular by the &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; critics such as Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer and Jacques Rivette, and were awarded at the Venice Film Festival. While &quot;The Life of Oharu&quot; follows the social decline of a woman banished from the Imperial court during the Edo era, &quot;Ugetsu&quot; and &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot; examine the brutal effects of war and reigns of violence on small communities and families. In between these three films, he directed &quot;A Geisha&quot; (1953) about the pressures put upon women working in Kyoto&#x27;s post-war pleasure district. After two historical films shot in colour (&quot;Tales of the Taira Clan&quot; and &quot;Princess Yang Kwei Fei&quot;, both 1955), Mizoguchi once more explored a contemporary milieu (a brothel in the Yoshiwara district) in black-and-white format with his last film, the 1956 &quot;Street of Shame&quot;.

Mizoguchi died of leukemia at the age of 58 in the Kyoto Municipal Hospital. At the time of his death, Mizoguchi was working on the script of &quot;An Osaka Story&quot;, which was later realised by Kōzaburō Yoshimura.

===International appreciation===
‘On 24 August 1956, Japan&#x27;s greatest film-maker died in Kyoto. And one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. Kenji Mizoguchi was the equal of a Murnau or a Rossellini... If poetry appears at every second, in every shot that Mizoguchi makes, it is because, as with Murnau, it is the instinctive reflection of the inventive nobility of its author’. Jean-Luc Godard, Arts, 5 February 1958.

‘There is no doubt that Kenji Mizoguchi, who died three years ago, was his country&#x27;s greatest filmmaker. He knew how to discipline for his own use an art born in other climes and from which his compatriots had not always made the most of. And yet there is no slavish desire on his part to copy the West. His conception of setting, acting, rhythm, composition, time and space is entirely national. But he touches us in the same way as Murnau, Ophüls or Rossellini’. Éric Rohmer, Arts, 25 September 1959.

‘Comparisons are as inevitable as they are unfashionable: Mizoguchi is the Shakespeare of cinema, its Bach or Beethoven, its Rembrandt, Titian or Picasso’, James Quandt, Mizoguchi the Master, (retrospective of Mizoguchi centenary films), Cinematheque Ontario and The Japan Foundation, 1996.

==Legacy==
In 1975, Kaneto Shindō, a set designer, chief assistant director and scenarist for Mizoguchi in the late 1930s and 1940s, released a documentary about his former mentor, &quot;Kenji Mizoguchi: The Life of a Film Director&quot;, as well as publishing a book on him in 1976. Already with his autobiographical debut film &quot;Story of a Beloved Wife&quot; (1951), Shindō had paid reference to Mizoguchi in the shape of the character &quot;Sakaguchi&quot;, a director who nurtures a young aspiring screenwriter.

Mizoguchi&#x27;s films have regularly appeared in &quot;best film&quot; polls, such as &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The 100 Greatest Films of All Time&quot; (&quot;Ugetsu&quot; and &quot;Sansho the Bailiff&quot;) and Kinema Junpo&#x27;s &quot;Kinema Junpo Critics&#x27; Top 200&quot; (&quot;The Life of Oharu&quot;, &quot;Ugetsu&quot; and &quot;The Crucified Lovers&quot;). A retrospective of his 30 extant films, presented by the Museum of the Moving Image and the Japan Foundation, toured several American cities in 2014. Among the directors who have admired Mizoguchi&#x27;s work are Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, Andrei Tarkovsky, Martin Scorsese, Werner Herzog, Theo Angelopoulos and many others. Film historian David Thomson wrote, &quot;The use of camera to convey emotional ideas or intelligent feelings is the definition of cinema derived from Mizoguchi&#x27;s films. He is supreme in the realization of internal states in external views.&quot;

<doc id="660940" wikidata="Q1114502" url="?curid=660940" title="American comic book">
<text>An American comic book is a thin periodical originating in the United States, on average 32 pages, containing comics. While the form originated in 1933, American comic books first gained popularity after the 1938 publication of &quot;Action Comics&quot;, which included the debut of the superhero Superman. This was followed by a superhero boom that lasted until the end of World War II. After the war, while superheroes were marginalized, the comic book industry rapidly expanded and genres such as horror, crime, science fiction and romance became popular. The 1950s saw a gradual decline, due to a shift away from print media in the wake of television and the impact of the Comics Code Authority. The late 1950s and the 1960s saw a superhero revival and superheroes remained the dominant character archetype throughout the late 20th century into the 21st century. 

Some fans collect comic books, helping drive up their value. Some have sold for more than 1 million. Comic shops cater to fans, selling comic books, plastic sleeves (&quot;bags&quot;) and cardboard backing (&quot;boards&quot;) to protect the comic books.

An American comic book is also known as a floppy comic. It is typically thin and stapled, unlike traditional books.

American comic books are one of the three major comic book industries globally, along with Japanese manga and the Franco-Belgian comic books.

==Format==
The typical size and page count of comics have varied over the decades, generally tending toward smaller formats and fewer pages.

Historically, the size was derived from folding one sheet of Quarter Imperial paper (), to print 4 pages which were each . This also meant that the page count had to be some multiple of 4.

In recent decades, standard comics have been trimmed at about 6.625 x 10.25 inches.

The format of the American comic book has been adapted periodically outside the United States, especially in Canada and the United Kingdom.

== Creating comics ==
While comics can be the work of a single creator, the labor of creating them is frequently divided between a number of specialists. There may be a separate writer and artist, or there may be separate artists for the characters and backgrounds.

Particularly in superhero comic books, the art may be divided between:
* a writer, who plots the story and writes the dialogue
* a penciller (usually termed the artist), who, working exclusively in pencils, generally lays out the panel breakdown on the page, and draws the actual artwork in each panel (but layouts may be handled by a separate artist), and who, particularly at Marvel Comics, may also co-plot the storyline
* an inker, working exclusively in ink, who finishes the artwork ready for the printing press. 
* a colorist, who adds the color to the pages (but this usually involves preparing four individual separations in cyan, magenta, yellow and black for the CMYK printing process, not a literal application of those colors to the inked pages)
* a letterer, who adds the captions and speech balloons (from the script prepared by the writer).

The process begins with the writer (often in collaboration with one or more others, who may include the editor and/or the penciller) coming up with a story idea or concept, then working it up into a plot and storyline, finalizing it with a script. After the art is prepared, the dialogue and captions are lettered onto the page from the script, and an editor may have the final say (but, once ready for printing, it is difficult and expensive to make any major changes), before the comic is sent to the printer.

The creative team, the writer and artist(s), may work for a comic book publisher who handles the marketing, advertising, and other logistics. A wholesale distributor, such as Diamond Comic Distributors, the largest in the US, distributes the printed product to retailers.

Another aspect of the process involved in successful comics is the interaction between the readers/fans and the creator(s). Fan art and letters to the editor were commonly printed in the back of the book, until, in the early 21st century, various Internet forums started to replace this tradition.

==Independent and alternative comics==

The growth of comic specialty stores helped permit several waves of independently-produced comics, beginning in the mid-1970s. Some early examples of these – generally referred to as &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;alternative&quot; comics – such as &quot;Big Apple Comix&quot;, continued somewhat in the tradition of the earlier underground comics, while others, such as &quot;Star Reach&quot;, resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned ventures or by a single artist.

This so-called &quot;small press&quot; scene (a term derived from the limited quantity of comics printed in each press-run) continued to grow and diversify, with a number of small publishers in the 1990s changing the format and distribution of their comic books to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The &quot;minicomics&quot; form, an extremely informal version of self-publishing, arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s, despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small presses.

==History==
===Proto-comic books===
The development of the modern American comic book happened in stages. Publishers had collected comic strips in hardcover book form as early as 1842, with &quot;The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck&quot;, a collection of English-language newspaper inserts originally published in Europe as the 1837 book &quot;Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois&quot; by Rodolphe Töpffer.

The G. W. Dillingham Company published the first known proto-comic-book magazine in the US, &quot;The Yellow Kid in McFadden&#x27;s Flats&quot;, in 1897. A hardcover book, it reprinted material—primarily the October 18, 1896, to January 10, 1897, sequence titled &quot;McFadden&#x27;s Row of Flats&quot;—from cartoonist Richard F. Outcault&#x27;s newspaper comic strip &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Alley&quot;, starring the Yellow Kid. The 196-page, square-bound, black-and-white publication, which also includes introductory text by E. W. Townsend, measured and sold for 50 cents. The neologism &quot;comic book&quot; appears on the back cover. Despite the publication of a series of related Hearst comics soon afterward, the first monthly proto-comic book, Embee Distributing Company&#x27;s &quot;Comic Monthly&quot;, did not appear until 1922. Produced in an format, it reprinted black-and-white newspaper comic strips and lasted a year.

===&quot;The Funnies&quot; and &quot;Funnies on Parade&quot;===

In 1929, Dell Publishing (founded by George T. Delacorte, Jr.) published &quot;The Funnies&quot;, described by the Library of Congress as &quot;a short-lived newspaper tabloid insert&quot; and not to be confused with Dell&#x27;s 1936 comic-book series of the same name. Historian Ron Goulart describes the 16-page, four-color periodical as &quot;more a Sunday comic section without the rest of the newspaper than a true comic book. But it did offer all original material and was sold on newsstands&quot;. &quot;The Funnies&quot; ran for 36 issues, published Saturdays through October 16, 1930.

In 1933, salesperson Maxwell Gaines, sales manager Harry I. Wildenberg, and owner George Janosik of the Waterbury, Connecticut, company Eastern Color Printing—which printed, among other things, Sunday-paper comic-strip sections – produced &quot;Funnies on Parade&quot; as a way to keep their presses running. Like &quot;The Funnies&quot;, but only eight pages, this appeared as a newsprint magazine. Rather than using original material, however, it reprinted in color several comic strips licensed from the McNaught Syndicate, the Ledger Syndicate, and the Bell-McClure Syndicate. These included such popular strips as cartoonist Al Smith&#x27;s &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;, Ham Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, and Percy Crosby&#x27;s &quot;Skippy&quot;. Eastern Color neither sold this periodical nor made it available on newsstands, but rather sent it out free as a promotional item to consumers who mailed in coupons clipped from Procter &amp; Gamble soap and toiletries products. The company printed 10,000 copies. The promotion proved a success, and Eastern Color that year produced similar periodicals for Canada Dry soft drinks, Kinney Shoes, Wheatena cereal and others, with print runs of from 100,000 to 250,000.

===&quot;Famous Funnies&quot; and &quot;New Fun&quot;===

Also in 1933, Gaines and Wildenberg collaborated with Dell to publish the 36-page &quot;Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics&quot;, which historians consider the first true American comic book; Goulart, for example, calls it &quot;the cornerstone for one of the most lucrative branches of magazine publishing&quot;. Distribution took place through the Woolworth&#x27;s department-store chain, though it remains unclear whether it was sold or given away; the cover displays no price, but Goulart refers, either metaphorically or literally, to &quot;sticking a ten-cent pricetag on the comic books&quot;.

When Delacorte declined to continue with &quot;Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics&quot;, Eastern Color on its own published &quot;Famous Funnies&quot; #1 (cover-dated July 1934), a 68-page giant selling for 10¢. Distributed to newsstands by the mammoth American News Company, it proved a hit with readers during the cash-strapped Great Depression, selling 90 percent of its 200,000 print, although putting Eastern Color more than $4,000 in the red. That quickly changed, with the book turning a $30,000 profit each issue starting with #12. &quot;Famous Funnies&quot; would eventually run 218 issues, inspire imitators, and largely launch a new mass medium.

When the supply of available existing comic strips began to dwindle, early comic books began to include a small amount of new, original material in comic-strip format. Inevitably, a comic book of all-original material, with no comic-strip reprints, debuted. Fledgling publisher Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson founded National Allied Publications, which would evolve into DC Comics, to release &quot;New Fun&quot; #1 (Feb. 1935). This came out as a tabloid-sized, , 36-page magazine with a card-stock, non-glossy cover. An anthology, it mixed humor features such as the funny animal comic &quot;Pelion and Ossa&quot; and the college-set &quot;Jigger and Ginger&quot; with such dramatic fare as the Western strip &quot;Jack Woods&quot; and the &quot;yellow-peril&quot; adventure &quot;Barry O&#x27;Neill&quot;, featuring a Fu Manchu-styled villain, Fang Gow. Issue #6 (Oct. 1935) brought the comic-book debut of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, the future creators of Superman. The two began their careers with the musketeer swashbuckler &quot;Henri Duval&quot;, doing the first two installments before turning it over to others and, under the pseudonyms &quot;Leger and Reuths&quot;, they created the supernatural-crimefighter adventure Doctor Occult.

===Superheroes and the Golden Age===
In 1938, after Wheeler-Nicholson&#x27;s partner Harry Donenfeld had ousted him, National Allied editor Vin Sullivan pulled a Siegel/Shuster creation from the slush pile and used it as the cover feature (but only as a backup story) in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1 (June 1938). The duo&#x27;s alien hero, Superman, was dressed in a cape and colorful tights. The costume, influenced by Flash Gordon&#x27;s attire from 1934, evoked circus aerial performers and circus strongmen, and Superman became the archetype of the &quot;superheroes&quot; that would follow.

In early 1939, the success of Superman in &quot;Action Comics&quot; prompted editors at National Comics Publications (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles. In response, Bob Kane and Bill Finger created Batman, who debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #27 (May 1939). The period from the late 1930s through roughly the end of the 1940s is referred to by comic book experts as the Golden Age of comic books. It featured extremely large print-runs, with &quot;Action Comics&quot; and &quot;Captain Marvel&quot; selling over half a million copies a month each; comics provided very popular cheap entertainment during World War II especially among soldiers, but with erratic quality in stories, art, and printing. In the early 1940s, over 90 percent of girls and boys from seven to seventeen read comic books.

In 1941, H. G. Peter and William Moulton Marston, created the female superhero character Wonder Woman, who debuted in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #8 (December 1941) and &quot;Sensation Comics&quot; featuring Wonder Woman in 1942.

MLJ&#x27;s &quot;Pep Comics&quot; debuted as a superhero, science-fiction and adventure anthology, but after the title introduced the teen-humor feature &quot;Archie&quot; in 1942, the feature&#x27;s popularity would soon eclipse all other MLJ properties, leading the publisher to rename itself Archie Comics.

Following the end of World War II, the popularity of superheroes greatly diminished, while the comic-book industry itself expanded. A few well-established characters such as Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman continued to sell, but DC canceled series starring the Flash and Green Lantern and converted &quot;All-American Comics&quot; and &quot;All Star Comics&quot; to Western titles, and &quot;Star Spangled Comics&quot; to a war title. The publisher also launched such science-fiction titles as &quot;Strange Adventures&quot; and &quot;Mystery in Space&quot;. Martin Goodman&#x27;s Timely Comics, also known as Atlas, canceled its three formerly high-selling superhero titles starring Captain America (created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby), the Human Torch, and the Sub-Mariner, briefly reviving the characters in 1954 only to cancel them again shortly thereafter to focus on horror, science fiction, teen humor, romance and Western genres. Romance comics became strongly established, with Prize Comics&#x27; &quot;Young Romance&quot; and with &quot;Young Love&quot;, the latter written and drawn by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby; those two titles&#x27; popularity led to an explosion of romance comics from many publishers.

Dell&#x27;s comic books accounted for a third of all North American sales in the early 1950s. Its 90 titles averaged a circulation of 800,000 copies per title for every issue, with &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; peaking at a circulation of three million a month in 1953. Eleven of the top 25 bestselling comic books at the time were Dell titles. Out of 40 publishers active in 1954, Dell, Atlas (i.e. Marvel), DC, and Archie were the major players in volume of sales. By this point, former big-time players Fawcett and Fiction House had ceased publishing.

Circulation peaked in 1952 when 3,161 issues of various comics were published with a total circulation of about one billion copies. After 1952, the number of individual releases dropped every year for the rest of the decade, with the biggest falls occurring in 1955–56. The rapid decline followed the introduction of the Comics Code Authority in the wake of Senate hearings on juvenile delinquency, which, ignoring the social problems caused by the wars of 1939–45 and 1950–52, sought to blame those problems solely on comics. While there was only a 9% drop in the number of releases between 1952 and 1953, circulation plummeted by an estimated 30–40%. The cause of the decrease is not entirely clear. Television had begun to provide competition with comic books, but there was also a rise in conservative values with the election in 1952 of Dwight Eisenhower. The Comics Code Authority, a self-censoring body founded to curb the juvenile delinquency alleged to be due to the crime and horror comics, has often been targeted as the culprit, but sales had begun to drop the year before it was founded. The major publishers were not seriously harmed by the drop in sales, but smaller publishers were killed off: EC (the prime target of the CCA) stopped publishing crime and horror titles, which was their entire business, and were forced out of the market altogether, turning to magazine publishing instead. By 1960, output had stabilized at about 1,500 releases per year (representing a greater than fifty percent decline since 1952).

The dominant comic book genres of the post-CCA 1950s were funny animals, humor, romance, television properties, and Westerns. Detective, fantasy, teen, and war comics were also popular, but adventure, superheroes, and comic strip reprints were in decline, with &quot;Famous Funnies&quot; seeing its last issue in 1955.

===The Comics Code===

In the late 1940s and early 1950s horror and true-crime comics flourished, many containing graphic violence and gore. Due to such content, moral crusaders became concerned with the impact of comics on the youth, and were blaming comic books for everything from poor grades to juvenile delinquency to drug abuse. This perceived indecency resulted in the collection and public burning of comic books in Spencer, West Virginia and Binghamton, New York in 1948, which received national attention and triggered other public burnings by schools and parent groups across the country. Some cities passed laws banning comic books entirely. In 1954, psychiatrist Fredric Wertham published his book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;, where he discussed what he perceived as sadistic and homosexual undertones in horror comics and superhero comics respectively, and singled out EC Comics due to its success as a publisher of these genres. In response to growing public anxiety, the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency held hearings on comic book indecency from April to June 1954. 

In the wake of these troubles, a group of comics publishers, led by National and Archie, founded the Comics Code Authority in 1954 and drafted the Comics Code, intended as &quot;the most stringent code in existence for any communications media&quot;. A Comic Code &quot;Seal of Approval&quot; soon appeared on virtually every comic book carried on newsstands. EC, after experimenting with less controversial comic books, dropped its comics line to focus on the satirical &quot;Mad&quot;—a former comic book which was now converted to a magazine format in order to circumvent the Code.

===Silver Age of Comic Books===
DC started a revival in superhero comics in 1956 with the October 1956 revival of its former golden age top-seller The Flash in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4. Many comics historians peg this as the beginning of the Silver Age of American comic books, although Marvel (at this point still known variously as both &quot;Timely&quot; and &quot;Atlas&quot;) had started reviving some of its old superheroes as early as 1954. The new Flash is taken symbolically as the beginning of a new era, although his success was not immediate. It took two years for the Flash to receive his own title, and &quot;Showcase&quot; itself was only a bimonthly book, though one which was to introduce a large number of enduring characters. By 1959, the slowly building superhero revival had become clear to DC&#x27;s competitors. Archie jumped on board that year, and Charlton joined the bandwagon in 1960.

In 1961, at the demand of publisher Martin Goodman (who was reacting to a surge in sales of National&#x27;s newest superhero title &quot;The Justice League of America&quot;), writer/editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four for Atlas, which now re-named itself Marvel Comics. With an innovation that changed the comic-book industry, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #1 initiated a naturalistic style of superheroes with human failings, fears, and inner demons - heroes who squabbled and worried about the likes of paying the rent. In contrast to the super-heroic do-gooder archetypes of established superheroes at the time, this ushered in a revolution. With dynamic artwork by Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck, and others, complementing Lee&#x27;s colorful, catchy prose, the new style became very popular among teenagers and college students who could identify with the angsty and irreverent nature of characters like Spider-Man, Hulk, X-Men and Fantastic Four. This was a time of social upheaval, giving birth to a new generation of hip and more counter-cultural youngsters, who found a voice in these books. Because Marvel&#x27;s books were distributed by its rival, National, from 1957 until 1968 Marvel were restricted to publishing only eight titles a month. This was a cloud with a silver lining, and proved the making of Marvel, allowing the company to concentrate its brightest and best talent on a small number of titles, at a time when its rivals were spreading their creative talents very thin across a huge number of monthly titles. The quality of Marvel&#x27;s product soared in consequence, and sales soared with it.

While the creators of comics were given credit in the early days of comic books, this practice had all but vanished during the 1940s and 1950s. Comic books were produced by comic book &quot;companies&quot; rather than by individual creators (EC being a notable exception, a company that not only credited its creative teams but also featured creators&#x27; biographies). Even comic books by revered and collectible artists like Carl Barks were not known by their creator&#x27;s name—Disney comics by Barks were signed &quot;Walt Disney&quot;. In the 1960s, DC, and then Marvel, began to include writer and artist credits on the comics that they published.

Other notable companies publishing comics during the Silver Age included the American Comics Group (ACG), Charlton, Dell, Gold Key, Harvey Comics, and Tower.

===Underground comix===

Sex, drugs and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll were featured, as the anti-authoritarian underground comix made waves in 1968, following the publication of Robert Crumb&#x27;s irregularly published &quot;Zap Comix&quot;. Frank Stack had published &quot;The Adventures of Jesus&quot; as far back as 1962, and there had been a trickle of such publications until Crumb&#x27;s success. What had started as a self-publishing scene soon grew into a minor industry, with Print Mint, Kitchen Sink, Last Gasp and Apex Novelties among the more well-known publishers. These comix were often extremely graphic, and largely distributed in head shops that flourished in the countercultural era.

Legal issues and paper shortages led to a decline in underground comix output from its 1972 peak. In 1974 the passage of anti-paraphernalia laws in the US led to the closing of most head shops, which throttled underground comix distribution. Its readership also dried up as the hippie movement itself petered out in the mid-1970s.

===Bronze Age of Comic Books===
&quot;Wizard&quot; originally used the phrase &quot;Bronze Age&quot;, in 1995, to denote the Modern Horror age. But historians and fans use &quot;Bronze Age&quot; to describe the period of American mainstream comics history that began with the period of concentrated changes to comic books in 1970. Unlike the Golden/Silver Age transition, the Silver/Bronze transition involves many continuing books, making the transition less sharp.

===The Modern Age===
The development of the &quot;direct market&quot; distribution system in the 1970s coincided with the appearance of comic-book specialty stores across North America. These specialty stores were a haven for more distinct voices and stories, but they also marginalized comics in the public eye. Serialized comic stories became longer and more complex, requiring readers to buy more issues to finish a story.

In the mid-to-late 1980s, two series published by DC Comics, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Watchmen&quot;, had a profound impact upon the American comic-book industry. Their popularity, along with mainstream media attention and critical acclaim, combined with changing social tastes, led to a considerably darker tone in comic books during the 1990s nicknamed by fans as the &quot;grim-and-gritty&quot; era.

The growing popularity of antiheroes such as Wolverine and the Punisher exemplified this change, as did the darker tone of some independent publishers such as First Comics, Dark Horse Comics, and (founded in the 1990s) Image Comics. This tendency towards darkness and nihilism was manifested in DC&#x27;s production of heavily promoted comic book stories such as &quot;&quot; in the &quot;Batman&quot; series (in which The Joker brutally murdered Batman&#x27;s sidekick Robin), while at Marvel the continuing popularity of the various X-Men books led to storylines involving the genocide of superpowered &quot;mutants&quot; in allegorical stories about religious and ethnic persecution.

In addition, published formats like the graphic novel and the related trade paperback enabled the comic book to gain some respectability as literature. As a result, these formats are now common in book retail and the collections of US public libraries.

<doc id="660941" wikidata="Q2443442" url="?curid=660941" title="XSL attack">
<text>In cryptography, the &quot;eXtended Sparse Linearization&quot; (XSL) attack is a method of cryptanalysis for block ciphers. The attack was first published in 2002 by researchers Nicolas Courtois and Josef Pieprzyk. It has caused some controversy as it was claimed to have the potential to break the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher, also known as Rijndael, faster than an exhaustive search. Since AES is already widely used in commerce and government for the transmission of secret information, finding a technique that can shorten the amount of time it takes to retrieve the secret message without having the key could have wide implications.

The method has a high work-factor, which unless lessened, means the technique does not reduce the effort to break AES in comparison to an exhaustive search. Therefore, it does not affect the real-world security of block ciphers in the near future. Nonetheless, the attack has caused some experts to express greater unease at the algebraic simplicity of the current AES.

In overview, the XSL attack relies on first analyzing the internals of a cipher and deriving a set of quadratic simultaneous equations. These systems of equations are typically very large, for example 8,000 equations with 1,600 variables for the 128-bit AES. Several methods for solving such systems are known. In the XSL attack, a specialized algorithm, termed &quot;eXtended Sparse Linearization&quot;, is then applied to solve these equations and recover the key.

The attack is notable for requiring only a handful of known plaintexts to perform; previous methods of cryptanalysis, such as linear and differential cryptanalysis, often require unrealistically large numbers of known or chosen plaintexts.

==Solving multivariate quadratic equations==
Solving multivariate quadratic equations (MQ) over a finite set of numbers is an NP-hard problem (in the general case) with several applications in cryptography. The XSL attack requires an efficient algorithm for tackling MQ. In 1999, Kipnis and Shamir showed that a particular public key algorithm, known as the Hidden Field Equations scheme (HFE), could be reduced to an overdetermined system of quadratic equations (more equations than unknowns). One technique for solving such systems is linearization, which involves replacing each quadratic term with an independent variable and solving the resultant linear system using an algorithm such as Gaussian elimination. To succeed, linearization requires enough linearly independent equations (approximately as many as the number of terms). However, for the cryptanalysis of HFE there were too few equations, so Kipnis and Shamir proposed &quot;re-linearization&quot;, a technique where extra non-linear equations are added after linearization, and the resultant system is solved by a second application of linearization. Re-linearization proved general enough to be applicable to other schemes.

In 2000, Courtois et al. proposed an improved algorithm for MQ known as &quot;XL&quot; (for &quot;eXtended Linearization&quot;), which increases the number of equations by multiplying them with all monomials of a certain degree. Complexity estimates showed that the XL attack would not work against the equations derived from block ciphers such as AES. However, the systems of equations produced had a special structure, and the XSL algorithm was developed as a refinement of XL which could take advantage of this structure. In XSL, the equations are multiplied only by carefully selected monomials, and several variants have been proposed.

Research into the efficiency of XL and its derivative algorithms remains ongoing (Yang and Chen, 2004).

==Application to block ciphers==
Courtois and Pieprzyk (2002) observed that AES (Rijndael) and partially also Serpent could be expressed as a system of quadratic equations. The variables represent not just the plaintext, ciphertext and key bits, but also various intermediate values within the algorithm. The S-box of AES appears to be especially vulnerable to this type of analysis, as it is based on the algebraically simple inverse function. Subsequently, other ciphers have been studied to see what systems of equations can be produced (Biryukov and De Cannière, 2003), including Camellia, KHAZAD, MISTY1 and KASUMI. Unlike other forms of cryptanalysis, such as differential and linear cryptanalysis, only one or two (in the case of a 128 bit block size and a 256 bit key size) known plaintexts are required.

The XSL algorithm is tailored to solve the type of equation systems that are produced. Courtois and Pieprzyk estimate that an &quot;optimistic evaluation shows that the XSL attack might be able to break Rijndael [with] 256 bits and Serpent for key lengths [of] 192 and 256 bits.&quot; Their analysis, however, is not universally accepted. For example:
In AES 4 Conference, Bonn 2004, one of the inventors of Rijndael, Vincent Rijmen, commented, &quot;The XSL attack is not an attack. It is a dream.&quot; Promptly Courtois answered, &quot;XSL may be a dream. It may also be a very bad dream and turn into a nightmare.&quot; However neither any later paper or any actions by the NSA or NIST give any support to this remark by Courtois.

In 2003, Murphy and Robshaw discovered an alternative description of AES, embedding it in a larger cipher called &quot;BES&quot;, which can be described using very simple operations over a single field, GF(28). An XSL attack mounted on this system yields a simpler set of equations which would break AES with complexity of around 2100, if the Courtois and Pieprzyk analysis is correct. In 2005 Cid and Leurent gave evidence that, in its proposed form, the XSL algorithm does not provide an efficient method for solving the AES system of equations; however Courtois disputed their findings. At FSE 2007, Chu-Wee Lim and Khoongming Khoo showed that the XSL attack was worse than brute force on BES. 

Even if XSL works against some modern algorithms, the attack currently poses little danger in terms of practical security. Like many modern cryptanalytic results, it would be a so-called &quot;certificational weakness&quot;: while faster than a brute force attack, the resources required are still huge, and it is very unlikely that real-world systems could be compromised by using it. Future improvements could increase the practicality of an attack, however. Because this type of attack is new and unexpected, some cryptographers have expressed unease at the algebraic simplicity of ciphers like Rijndael. Bruce Schneier and Niels Ferguson write, &quot;We have one criticism of AES: we don&#x27;t quite trust the security… What concerns us the most about AES is its simple algebraic structure… No other block cipher we know of has such a simple algebraic representation. We have no idea whether this leads to an attack or not, but not knowing is reason enough to be skeptical about the use of AES.&quot; (&quot;Practical Cryptography&quot;, 2003, pp. 56–57)

<text>USS &quot;Rainbow&quot; (AS-7) was the only ship in the United States Navy by that name. The ship was originally converted to a distilling ship in 1898, and then converted again in 1917 to a submarine tender.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; was built in 1890 as the merchant ship &quot;Norse King&quot; by James Laing at Sunderland, England. She was purchased by the U.S. Navy on 29 June 1898, placed in reduced commission on 18 July, and transferred to the New York Navy Yard for fitting out for use as a distilling and station ship in the Philippines.

==Service history==
===Asiatic Fleet, 1901–1908===
&quot;Rainbow&quot; was commissioned in full on 2 December 1901, Comdr. S. A. Stanton in command, and was assigned to the Asiatic Fleet. En route to the Philippines, she sailed via Gibraltar for the Suez Canal, calling at Palermo, Sicily; Port Said, Egypt; Colombo, Ceylon; and Singapore before arriving at Cavite on 3 April 1902.

&quot;Rainbow&quot;, as flagship of the Philippine Squadron, remained in the Philippines, with only periodic runs to Hong Kong for repairs, until 1906. Her range was then expanded from an annual circuit among Philippine ports to include visits to various Japanese ports, and in November 1907, a call at Vladivostok with Secretary of War Taft embarked.

===Pacific Fleet, 1908–1911===
Becoming flagship of the 3rd Squadron, Pacific Fleet, in 1908, &quot;Rainbow&quot; cruised among the Philippine and Japanese islands and off the coast of China, and, on at least one occasion, December 1908-January 1909, conducted hydrologic surveys. Then, designated tender to the First Torpedo Flotilla, she alternated between the China coast and the Philippines until pressed into service as a transport in 1911.

===Asiatic Fleet, 1911–1914===
&quot;Rainbow&quot; departed Cavite on 26 October 1911, en route with an expeditionary force of Marines landed at Wusong (31 October-1 November) to help protect American nationals from imminent dangers of the revolutionary turmoil in China. She became the temporary flagship of the Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet, 1 November 1911, cruising the China coast to observe conditions which might affect the safety of Americans at Shanghai, Wusong, Nanjing, Amoy, Shantou, Qingdao, and Taku.

 relieved &quot;Rainbow&quot; as Asiatic Fleet flagship on 10 April 1912. &quot;Rainbow&quot; then proceeded to Huangpu where she became the flagship of the China Squadron on 13 April. She supported Marine expeditionary forces on the China coast until 30 August 1912, when she sailed from Yantai for repairs at Olongapo, Philippine Islands.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; shifted from Olongapo to Cavite on 8 October 1912 and served there as temporary flagship for the Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet (30 October-7 November). She departed Cavite on 7 November 1912, bound by way of Wusong, Shanghai, and the Yangtze River to Nanjing, China. She arrived at Nanjing on 20 November and sailed 10 days later to cruise with the American ambassador to the ports of Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shantou, Amoy, and Wusong. She departed Wusong on 28 December 1912, investigating the landing facilities at Lingayen Gulf in the Philippines before being repaired at Olongapo in January 1913.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; shifted from Olongapo to Cavite on 26 January 1913 and remained in the Philippines until 28 March when she again set course for the coast of China. She transferred stores and men to at Wusong, then served as a station ship at Shanghai until 4 November 1913. After calling at Olongapo, she proceeded to Manila, embarked the Commander-in-Chief for transport to Shanghai, and served there as flagship from 21 December 1913 to 19 January 1914.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; resumed station ship duty at Cavite on 22 January 1914. She again became temporary flagship of the Commander-in-Chief at Cavite on 1 March 1914, but terminated this duty on 23 March 1914 when she shifted to Olongapo for overhaul, completed on 8 July 1914. She departed Manila Bay on 16 July 1914, taking refuge from a storm in Lingayen Gulf the 18th, before proceeding to survey the French Frigate Shoals, Hawaii (7-10 August 1914). She arrived at Honolulu 12 August, basing there for further survey work off the French Frigate Shoals until 14 November 1914. She then set course for San Francisco, arriving 24 November 1914 and shifting to the Mare Island Navy Yard the following day to prepare for inactivation. She decommissioned in the Mare Island Navy Yard on 24 December 1914.

===Conversion to submarine tender, 1916–1918 ===
&quot;Rainbow&quot; was placed in commission, in reserve, at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 29 January 1916. She shifted to the U.S. Naval Training Station, Yerba Buena Island, 4 February 1916, serving as a receiving ship there until 14 December 1917. She then entered the Mare Island Navy Yard to fit out for service as a tender to the 6th Division, Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet.

===Submarine tender, 1918–1925===
On 2 April 1918 &quot;Rainbow&quot;, Lieutenant Paul H. Rice commanding, departed Mare Island to tend submarines and at Yerba Buena Island, California City, and San Pedro, California. On 3 May 1918 she departed San Pedro for the eastern seaboard in company with &quot;L-6&quot; and &quot;L-7&quot;. She arrived in Charleston with the L-boats on 9 June 1918 and proceeded independently on the 21st for the Philadelphia Navy Yard, arriving on 24 June 1918.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; overhauled in the Philadelphia Navy Yard until 20 October 1918, then tended the O-boats of Submarine Division 10 at Newport, Rhode Island; Bridgeport, Connecticut; and Tompkinsville, New York. The tender sailed from Tompkinsville in company with Submarine Division 10, bound by way of Hampton Roads, Virginia, to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, arriving on 7 January 1919.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; served as tender for Submarine Division 10 at Guantanamo until 10 March 1919; then cruised to Charlotte Amalie Harbor, St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, where the O-boats carried out daily practice on the target range until 16 April. After calling at San Juan, Puerto Rico, the tender and her submarines returned to New York on 1 May 1919.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; continued as a tender to Submarine Division 10 at Cold Spring Inlet, Cape May, New Jersey, from 14 May to 22 September 1919. She then sailed to Charleston, where she remained in commission, in reserve, until 13 February 1920. She entered the Boston Navy Yard on 18 February 1920 for overhaul and was placed in full commission there 1 July 1920 to serve as a tender to Submarine Division 12.

Reclassified AS-7 on 17 July 1920, &quot;Rainbow&quot; departed the Boston Navy Yard on 28 October 1920, made a brief call at the Portsmouth Navy Yard, Kittery, Maine, then reached Newport, Rhode Island, 6 November 1921 to commence tending the S-boats of Submarine Division 12. The submarine division shifted base to New York on 19 November and sailed the 30th bound by way of Key West, Guantanamo Bay, the Panama Canal and ports of Mexico, to San Diego, arriving on 9 February 1921.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; tended Submarine Division 12 on the California coast until 6 April 1921, then set course from San Francisco with the S-boats of Division 12 for Honolulu, arriving 17 April 1921. Tending operations in Hawaiian waters continued until 12 November 1921 when she set course with the S-boats for Apra Harbor, Guam (27-30 November), thence to Cavite, Philippine Islands, arriving on 6 December 1921.

Upon arrival at Cavite, Philippine Islands, &quot;Rainbow&quot; became the flagship of Submarine Flotilla 3 (later designated Submarine Division), Asiatic Fleet. She also served as tender to Submarine Division 12 and sometimes assisted in tending the &quot;boats&quot; of Submarine Division 18. Except for a visit to Hong Kong (11-31 October 1921), she remained in the Philippines until 23 April 1923. She then sailed with the Submarine Divisions of the Asiatic Fleet and tender &quot;Finch&quot; to serve along the China Coast at Shanghai, Yantai, Qinhuangdao, Wusong, and Amoy.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; returned to Olongapo, Philippine Islands, from the coast of China on 10 September 1923, serving there and at Cavite until 24 June 1924. She again sailed from Cavite on 24 June 1924 in company with tender &quot;Finch&quot; and the S-boats of Divisions 12 and 18 to serve at Qingdao, Yantai, and Amoy until 20 September. She returned to Olongapo on 23 September 1924 and sailed 28 October for return to the western seaboard of the United States. She called at Sorsogon Bay, Luzon (29 September-3 October); Apra Harbor, Guam (6-17 November); Pearl Harbor (7-19 December); and reached the Mare Island Navy Yard on 31 December 1924.

&quot;Rainbow&quot; departed San Diego on 2 February 1925 to land Marine reinforcements at Corinto, Nicaragua (11-12 February), then proceeded by way of the Panama Canal, Guantanamo Bay, and Hampton Roads to the Philadelphia Navy Yard, arriving on 10 March 1925.

===Decommissioning and sale, 1925–1928===
&quot;Rainbow&quot; was decommissioned in the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 11 July 1925. She remained inactive in the Philadelphia Navy Yard until her name was struck from the Navy list on 26 June 1928. She was sold for scrapping on 13 September 1928 to the Boston Iron Works, Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>The Missouri Valley Conference (also called MVC or simply &quot;The Valley&quot;) is the fourth-oldest collegiate athletic conference in the United States. The conference&#x27;s members are primarily located in the Midwest though with substantial extension into the South in states like Kentucky, Tennessee, and Arkansas.

==History==
The MVC was established in 1907 (its charter member schools: the University of Kansas, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska, and Washington University in St. Louis) as the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association or MVIAA, 12 years after the Big Ten Conference, the only Division I conference that is older. It is the fourth-oldest college athletic conference in the United States, after the Big Ten Conference and the NCAA Division III&#x27;s Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association (MIAA) and Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC).

The MVIAA split in 1928, with most of the larger schools (the University of Kansas, University of Missouri, University of Nebraska, Iowa Agricultural College (now Iowa State University), Kansas State University, and University of Oklahoma) forming a conference that retained the MVIAA name; this conference evolved into the Big Six Conference. The Big Eight merged with four Texas schools of the Southwest Conference to form the Big 12 Conference in 1996.

The smaller MVIAA schools (Drake, Grinnell and Washington University in St. Louis), plus Oklahoma A&amp;M (now Oklahoma State University, which joined the Big Eight in 1957), were joined by Creighton to form the MVC, which retained the old MVIAA&#x27;s administrative staff.

To this day, it has never been definitively established which conference was the original and which was the spinoff, though the Big Eight would go on to become the more prestigious of the two. During the Big Eight&#x27;s run, both conferences claimed 1907 as their founding date, and the same history through 1927.

MVC teams held a 74–27 non-conference record during the 2006–07 college basketball season, including a record of 44–1 at home. The Valley finished in the top six of the RPI and ahead of a BCS conference for the second consecutive year, while also garnering multiple NCAA bids for the ninth straight year and 12th of 14.

The MVC has not sponsored football since 1985, when it was a hybrid I-A/I-AA (now FBS and FCS, respectively) conference. However, five members have football programs in the Missouri Valley Football Conference (MVFC) (known as the Gateway from 1985 to 2008) of Division I FCS, and two others compete in another FCS conference, the Pioneer Football League. The Missouri Valley Conference shares its name with the MVFC, and all three conferences operate from the same headquarters complex in St. Louis; however, the three are separate administratively.

After weeks of speculation, Wichita State announced on April 7, 2017, that it would leave the conference to join the American Athletic Conference starting with the 2017–18 season. The conference announced it extended an invitation to Valparaiso University on May 9, 2017; and on May 25, the MVC announced that Valparaiso would officially join the following July 1.

The most recent changes to the core MVC membership were announced during the 2021–22 school year. On September 28, 2021, the MVC and Belmont University jointly announced that the school would leave the Ohio Valley Conference for the MVC effective July 1, 2022. Then, on November 16, Loyola University Chicago announced it would leave the MVC at the same time, joining the Atlantic 10 Conference. On the same day Loyola announced its departure, CBS Sports reported that the MVC was actively pursuing further expansion, having entered into talks with the University of Missouri–Kansas City (known athletically as Kansas City), Murray State University, and the University of Texas at Arlington (UT Arlington). The report indicated that the latter two were considered the strongest candidates, but that all three were likely to receive invitations in the coming months. On January 7, 2022, the MVC announced that Murray State would officially join the conference on July 1 of that year. UT Arlington would soon remove itself from the list of candidates by announcing a 2022 move to the Western Athletic Conference.

Shortly before Murray State was officially announced as an incoming MVC member, Matt Brown of the &quot;Extra Points&quot; college sports blog reported that the MVC was also in membership discussions with the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC), then a member of the Horizon League. On the same weekend that Murray State&#x27;s arrival was officially announced, MVC officials made a site visit to UIC. Brown&#x27;s sources indicated that an invitation to UIC was likely. Brown noted that with the MVC losing Loyola, league officials believed that maintaining a presence in the city was a top priority, stating (emphasis in original): 

On January 22, 2022, Matt Norlander of &quot;CBSSports.com&quot; reported that UIC&#x27;s July entry to the MVC was &quot;a done deal&quot;, with his sources indicating that the MVC wanted to announce the move before the Conference Commissioners Association held its annual meeting in Naples, Florida in early February. UIC&#x27;s entry was officially announced on January 26.

On May 10, 2024, Missouri State announced they would leave the MVC to transition to the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and join Conference USA, effective for the 2025–26 season.

==Sports==

The Missouri Valley Conference sponsors championship competition in eight men&#x27;s and ten women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports. Ball State (men), Little Rock (women), and Miami (OH) (men) are affiliates in swimming and diving, and Bowling Green, Northern Illinois, and Western Michigan are affiliates in men&#x27;s soccer.

The most recent change to the roster of sports came in the 2024–25 school year, when the MVC reinstated men&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving after a 22-year absence. The inaugural season of the relaunched league features 7 sponsoring members, with full members Evansville, UIC, Missouri State, Southern Illinois, and Valparaiso joined by new affiliates Ball State and Miami (OH)— previously, all these programs were housed in the Mid-American Conference.

==Men&#x27;s basketball attendance==
&quot;Sources:&quot;

The Valley is well known for having some of the most dedicated fanbases in all of college basketball, with several members regularly selling out their large arenas on a nightly basis throughout the year. Former member (Creighton) had the sixth highest attendance for Division I in 2012–13 while Bradley, Illinois State, Missouri State, and Indiana State were all among the NCAA&#x27;s top 100 teams in home attendance.

In 2010–11, 2011–12, and 2012–13, the Valley maintained its position as the eighth ranked conference in average attendance.

The Valley made history in March 2007 with record attendance for four days at St. Louis&#x27; Scottrade Center as 85,074 fans turned out to watch the five sessions of the tournament. The two sellout crowds of 22,612 for the semifinals and final of the 2007 State Farm Tournament set an all-time attendance record for basketball at the arena and also gave The Valley the distinction of having the largest championship crowd for any of the 30 NCAA conference tournaments in 2007.

== Football champions by year ==

* All MVC schools that currently play football are part of the Missouri Valley Football Conference except for Drake and Valparaiso, which play in the Pioneer Football League.

==MVC TV Network==
Since at least 1993, the MVC has produced an in-house package of sports as part of the MVC TV Network.Starting in 1996, those telecasts were produced, in part, by Bally Sports Midwest (formerly Fox Sports Midwest). These games were distributed to regional sports networks including Bally Sports Indiana, Bally Sports Kansas City, Bally Sports South, Bally Sports Southeast, and NBC Sports Chicago (now Chicago Sports Network), as well as shown on Bally Sports Midwest. Until the 2020–21 season, some of these telecasts also aired on Fox College Sports. Outside of regional networks these telecasts were also available on ESPN3 until the 2018–19 season; those telecasts were then migrated over to ESPN+.

Starting with the 2024-25 academic year, production and distribution rights were acquired by Gray Media, with Gray Media-owned Indianapolis-based Tupelo Honey handling the actual production and distribution. It is a linear over-the-air station package distributed in Gray Media markets within the MVC member states of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee as well as third-party broadcast partners in markets within those same states where Gray Media has no presence; in addition, simulcasts will be available live nationally (via ESPN+ and through the ESPN app) without any digital blackouts (prior contracts prohibited simulcast availability within the MVC footprint).

The MVC TV Network serves as the home for the opening and quarterfinal rounds of Arch Madness (the nickname for the MVC men&#x27;s basketball tournament).

<doc id="660957" wikidata="Q957749" url="?curid=660957" title="John Marshall Harlan II">
<text>John Marshall Harlan (May 20, 1899 – December 29, 1971) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1955 to 1971. Harlan is usually called John Marshall Harlan II to distinguish him from his grandfather, John Marshall Harlan, who served on the U.S. Supreme Court from 1877 to 1911.

Harlan was a student at Upper Canada College and Appleby College and then at Princeton University. Awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, he studied law at Balliol College, Oxford. Upon his return to the U.S. in 1923 Harlan worked in the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner &amp; Howland while studying at New York Law School. Later he served as Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and as Special Assistant Attorney General of New York. In 1954 Harlan was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and a year later President Dwight D. Eisenhower nominated Harlan to the U.S. Supreme Court following the death of Justice Robert H. Jackson.

Harlan is often characterized as a member of the conservative wing of the Warren Court. He advocated a limited role for the judiciary, remarking that the Supreme Court should not be considered &quot;a general haven for reform movements&quot;. In general, Harlan adhered more closely to precedent, and was more reluctant to overturn legislation than many of his colleagues on the Court. He strongly disagreed with the doctrine of incorporation, which held that the provisions of the federal Bill of Rights applied to the state governments, not merely the federal government. At the same time, he advocated a broad interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause, arguing that it protected a wide range of rights not expressly mentioned in the United States Constitution. Justice Harlan was gravely ill when he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971. He died from spinal cancer three months later on December 29, 1971. After Harlan&#x27;s retirement, President Richard Nixon appointed William Rehnquist to replace him.

==Early life and career==
John Marshall Harlan was born on May 20, 1899, in Chicago. He was the son of John Maynard Harlan, a Chicago lawyer and politician, and Elizabeth Flagg. He had three sisters. Historically, Harlan&#x27;s family had been politically active. His forebear George Harlan served as one of the governors of Delaware during the seventeenth century; his great-grandfather James Harlan was a congressman during the 1830s; his grandfather, also John Marshall Harlan, was an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1877 to 1911; and his uncle, James S. Harlan, was attorney general of Puerto Rico and then chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission.

In his younger years, Harlan attended The Latin School of Chicago. He later attended two boarding high schools in the Toronto Area, Canada: Upper Canada College and Appleby College. Upon graduation from Appleby, Harlan returned to the U.S. and in 1916 enrolled at Princeton University. There, he was a member of the Ivy Club, served as an editor of &quot;The Daily Princetonian&quot;, and was class president during his junior and senior years. After graduating from the university in 1920 with an Artium Baccalaureus degree, he received a Rhodes Scholarship to attend Balliol College, Oxford, making him the first Rhodes Scholar to sit on the Supreme Court. He studied jurisprudence at Oxford for three years, returning from England in 1923. Upon his return to the United States, he began work with the law firm of Root, Clark, Buckner &amp; Howland (which became Dewey &amp; LeBoeuf), one of the leading law firms in the country, while studying law at New York Law School. He received his Bachelor of Laws in 1924 and earned admission to the bar in 1925.

Between 1925 and 1927, Harlan served as Assistant United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, heading the district&#x27;s Prohibition unit. He prosecuted Harry M. Daugherty, former United States Attorney General. In 1928, he was appointed Special Assistant Attorney General of New York, in which capacity he investigated a scandal involving sewer construction in Queens. He prosecuted Maurice E. Connolly, the Queens borough president, for his involvement in the affair. In 1930, Harlan returned to his old law firm, becoming a partner one year later. At the firm, he served as chief assistant for senior partner Emory Buckner and followed him into public service when Buckner was appointed United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. As one of &quot;Buckner&#x27;s Boy Scouts&quot;, eager young Assistant United States Attorneys, Harlan worked on Prohibition cases, and swore off drinking except when the prosecutors visited the Harlan family fishing camp in Quebec, where Prohibition did not apply. Harlan remained in public service until 1930, and then returned to his firm. Buckner had also returned to the firm, and after Buckner&#x27;s death, Harlan became the leading trial lawyer at the firm.

As a trial lawyer Harlan was involved in a number of famous cases. One such case was the conflict over the estate left after the death in 1931 of Ella Wendel, who had no heirs and left almost all her wealth, estimated at $30–100 million, to churches and charities. However, a number of claimants, most of them imposters, filed suits in state and federal courts seeking part of her fortune. Harlan acted as the main defender of her estate and will as well as the chief negotiator. Eventually a settlement among lawful claimants was reached in 1933. In the following years Harlan specialized in corporate law dealing with the cases like &quot;Randall v. Bailey&quot;, concerning the interpretation of state law governing distribution of corporate dividends. In 1940, he represented the New York Board of Higher Education unsuccessfully in the Bertrand Russell case in its efforts to retain Bertrand Russell on the faculty of the City College of New York; Russell was declared &quot;morally unfit&quot; to teach. The future justice also represented boxer Gene Tunney in a breach of contract suit brought by a would-be fight manager, a matter settled out of court.

In 1937, Harlan was one of five founders of a eugenics advocacy group called the Pioneer Fund, which had been formed to introduce ideas on eugenics to the United States. He had likely been invited into the group due to his expertise in non-profit organizations. Harlan served on the Pioneer Fund&#x27;s board until 1954. He did not play a significant role in the fund.

== Military service ==
During World War II, Harlan volunteered for military duty, serving as a colonel in the United States Army Air Forces from 1943 to 1945. He was the chief of the Operational Analysis Section of the Eighth Air Force in England. He won the Legion of Merit from the United States, and the Croix de Guerre from both France and Belgium. In 1946 Harlan returned to private law practice representing Du Pont family members against a federal antitrust lawsuit. In 1951, however, he returned to public service, serving as Chief Counsel to the New York State Crime Commission, where he investigated the relationship between organized crime and the state government as well as illegal gambling activities in New York and other areas. During this period Harlan also served as a committee chairman of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, and to which he was later elected vice president. Harlan&#x27;s main specialization at that time was corporate and antitrust law.

==Personal life==
In 1928, Harlan married Ethel Andrews, who was the daughter of Yale history professor Charles McLean Andrews. This was the second marriage for her. Ethel was originally married to New York architect Henry K. Murphy, who was twenty years her senior. After Ethel divorced Murphy in 1927, her brother John invited her to a Christmas party at Root, Clark, Buckner &amp; Howland, where she was introduced to John Harlan. They saw each other regularly afterwards and married on November 10, 1928, in Farmington, Connecticut.

Harlan, a Presbyterian, maintained a New York City apartment, a summer home in Weston, Connecticut, and a fishing camp in Murray Bay, Quebec, a lifestyle he described as &quot;awfully tame and correct&quot;. The justice played golf, favored tweeds, and wore a gold watch which had belonged to the first Justice Harlan. In addition to carrying his grandfather&#x27;s watch, when he joined the Supreme Court he used the same furniture which had furnished his grandfather&#x27;s chambers.

John and Ethel Harlan had one daughter, Evangeline (born on February 2, 1932). She was married to Frank Dillingham of West Redding, Connecticut, until his death, and had five children. One of Eve&#x27;s children, Amelia Newcomb, is the international news editor at &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; and has two children: Harlan, named after John Marshall Harlan II, and Matthew Trevithick. Another daughter, Kate Dillingham, is a professional cellist and published author.

==Second Circuit service==

Harlan was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on January 13, 1954, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated by Judge Augustus Noble Hand. Harlan knew this court well, as he had often appeared before it and was friendly with many of the judges. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 9, 1954, and received his commission on the next day. His service terminated on March 27, 1955, due to his elevation to the Supreme Court.

==Supreme Court service==

Harlan was nominated by President Eisenhower on January 10, 1955, as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, to succeed Robert H. Jackson. On being nominated, the reticent Harlan called reporters into his chambers in New York, and stated, in full, &quot;I am very deeply honored.&quot; He was confirmed by the Senate on March 16, 1955, by a 71–11 vote, and was sworn into office on March 28, 1955. Despite the brevity of his stay on the Second Circuit, Harlan would serve as the Circuit Justice responsible for the Second Circuit throughout his Supreme Court capacity, and, in that capacity, enjoyed attending the Circuit&#x27;s annual conference, bringing his wife and catching up on the latest gossip. Additionally, he served as Circuit Justice for the Ninth Circuit from June 25 to June 26, 1963. He assumed retired status on September 23, 1971, serving in that capacity until his death on December 29, 1971.
Harlan&#x27;s nomination came shortly after the Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, declaring segregation in public schools unconstitutional. James Eastland (the chairman of the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary) and several other southern senators delayed his confirmation, because they (correctly) believed that he would support desegregation of the schools and civil rights. Unlike almost all previous Supreme Court nominees, Harlan appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee to answer questions relating to his judicial views. Every Supreme Court nominee since Harlan has been questioned by the Judiciary Committee before confirmation. The Senate finally confirmed him on March 17, 1955, by a vote of 71–11. He took his seat on March 28, 1955. Of the eleven senators who voted against his appointment, nine were from the South. He was replaced on the Second Circuit by J. Edward Lumbard.

On the Supreme Court, Harlan often voted alongside Justice Felix Frankfurter, who was his principal mentor on the court. Some legal scholars even viewed him as &quot;Frankfurter without mustard&quot;, though others recognize his own important contributions to the evolution of legal thought. Harlan was an ideological adversary—but close personal friend—of Justice Hugo Black, with whom he disagreed on a variety of issues, including the applicability of the Bill of Rights to the states, the Due Process Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause.

Justice Harlan was very close to the law clerks whom he hired, and continued to take an interest in them after they left his chambers to continue their legal careers. The justice would advise them on their careers, hold annual reunions, and place pictures of their children on his chambers&#x27; walls. He would say to them of the Warren Court, &quot;We must consider this only temporary,&quot; that the Court had gone astray, but would soon right itself.

Justice Harlan is remembered by people who worked with him for his tolerance and civility. He treated his fellow Justices, clerks and attorneys representing parties with respect and consideration. While Justice Harlan often strongly objected to certain conclusions and arguments, he never criticized other justices or anybody else personally, and never said any disparaging words about someone&#x27;s motivations and capacity. Harlan was reluctant to show emotion, and was never heard to complain about anything. Harlan was one of the intellectual leaders of the Warren Court. Harvard Constitutional law expert Paul Freund said of him:

His thinking threw light in a very introspective way on the entire process of the judicial function. His decisions, beyond just the vote they represented, were sufficiently philosophical to be of enduring interest. He decided the case before him with that respect for its particulars, its special features, that marks alike the honest artist and the just judge.

==Jurisprudence==
Harlan&#x27;s jurisprudence is often characterized as conservative. He held precedent to be of great importance, adhering to the principle of &quot;stare decisis&quot; more closely than many of his Supreme Court colleagues. Unlike Justice Black, he eschewed strict textualism. While he believed that the original intention of the Framers should play an important part in constitutional adjudication, he also held that broad phrases like &quot;liberty&quot; in the Due Process Clause could be given an evolving interpretation.

Harlan believed that most problems should be solved by the political process, and that the judiciary should play only a limited role. In his dissent to &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, he wrote:

These decisions give support to a current mistaken view of the Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, is that every major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should take the lead in promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, be thought of as a general haven of reform movements.

However, Harlan was not a social conservative. He wrote the plurality opinion in &quot;Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day&quot;, ruling that photographs of nude men are not obscene, one of the first major victories for the early gay rights movement.
Despite Harlan&#x27;s conservatism, he opposed the Vietnam War and along with Justices William O. Douglas, Potter Stewart and William J. Brennan Jr. unsuccessfully pushed for the Court to hear challenges to its legality.

===Equal Protection Clause===
The Supreme Court decided several important equal protection cases during the first years of Harlan&#x27;s career. In these cases, Harlan regularly voted in favor of civil rights—similar to his grandfather, the only dissenting justice in the infamous &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; case.

He voted with the majority in &quot;Cooper v. Aaron&quot;, compelling defiant officials in Arkansas to desegregate public schools. He joined the opinion in &quot;Gomillion v. Lightfoot&quot;, which declared that states could not redraw political boundaries in order to reduce the voting power of African-Americans. Moreover, he joined the unanimous decision in &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;, which struck down state laws that banned interracial marriage.

===Due Process Clause===
Justice Harlan advocated a broad interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause. He subscribed to the doctrine that the clause not only provided procedural guarantees, but also protected a wide range of fundamental rights, including those that were not specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution. (See substantive due process.) However, as Justice Byron White noted in his dissenting opinion in &quot;Moore v. East Cleveland&quot;, &quot;no one was more sensitive than Mr. Justice Harlan to any suggestion that his approach to the Due Process Clause would lead to judges &#x27;roaming at large in the constitutional field&#x27;.&quot; Under Harlan&#x27;s approach, judges would be limited in the Due Process area by &quot;respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms&quot;.

Harlan set forth his interpretation in an often cited dissenting opinion to &quot;Poe v. Ullman&quot;, which involved a challenge to a Connecticut law banning the use of contraceptives. The Supreme Court dismissed the case on technical grounds, holding that the case was not ripe for adjudication. Justice Harlan dissented from the dismissal, suggesting that the Court should have considered the merits of the case. Thereafter, he indicated his support for a broad view of the due process clause&#x27;s reference to &quot;liberty&quot;. He wrote, &quot;This &#x27;liberty&#x27; is not a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures; and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking, includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and purposeless restraints.&quot; He suggested that the due process clause encompassed a right to privacy, and concluded that a prohibition on contraception violated this right.

The same law was challenged again in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;. This time, the Supreme Court agreed to consider the case, and concluded that the law violated the Constitution. However, the decision was based not on the due process clause, but on the argument that a right to privacy was found in the &quot;penumbras&quot; of other provisions of the Bill of Rights. Justice Harlan concurred in the result, but criticized the Court for relying on the Bill of Rights in reaching its decision. &quot;The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands,&quot; he wrote, &quot;on its own bottom.&quot; The Supreme Court would later adopt Harlan&#x27;s approach, relying on the due process clause rather than the penumbras of the Bill of Rights in right to privacy cases such as &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot;.

Harlan&#x27;s interpretation of the Due Process Clause attracted the criticism of Justice Black, who rejected the idea that the Clause included a &quot;substantive&quot; component, considering this interpretation unjustifiably broad and historically unsound, one of the few issues in which Black was more conservative than Harlan. The Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan, and has continued to apply the doctrine of substantive due process in a wide variety of cases.

===Incorporation===

Justice Harlan was strongly opposed to the theory that the Fourteenth Amendment &quot;incorporated&quot; the Bill of Rights—that is, made the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. His opinion on the matter was opposite to that of his grandfather, who supported the full incorporation of the Bill of Rights. When it was originally ratified, the Bill of Rights was binding only upon the federal government, as the Supreme Court ruled in the 1833 case &quot;Barron v. Baltimore&quot;. Some jurists argued that the Fourteenth Amendment made the entirety of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states as well. Harlan, however, rejected this doctrine, which he called &quot;historically unfounded&quot; in his &quot;Griswold&quot; concurrence.

Instead, Justice Harlan believed that the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s due process clause only protected &quot;fundamental&quot; rights. Thus, if a guarantee of the Bill of Rights was &quot;fundamental&quot; or &quot;implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,&quot; Harlan agreed that it applied to the states as well as the federal government. Thus, for example, Harlan believed that the First Amendment&#x27;s free speech clause applied to the states, but that the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s self-incrimination clause did not.

Harlan&#x27;s approach was largely similar to that of Justices Benjamin Cardozo and Felix Frankfurter. It drew criticism from Justice Black, a proponent of the total incorporation theory. Black claimed that the process of identifying some rights as more &quot;fundamental&quot; than others was largely arbitrary, and depended on each Justice&#x27;s personal opinions.

The Supreme Court has eventually adopted some elements of Harlan&#x27;s approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states—the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, an increasing number of rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings). Hence, the majority of provisions from the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are the Third Amendment, the grand jury clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Seventh Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, and the Tenth Amendment. Thus, although the Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan&#x27;s general reasoning, the result of its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.

===First Amendment===
Justice Harlan supported many of the Warren Court&#x27;s landmark decisions relating to the separation of church and state. For instance, he voted in favor of the Court&#x27;s ruling that the states could not use religious tests as qualifications for public office in &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot;. He joined in &quot;Engel v. Vitale&quot;, which declared that it was unconstitutional for states to require the recitation of official prayers in public schools. In &quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot;, he similarly voted to strike down an Arkansas law banning the teaching of evolution.

In many cases, Harlan took a fairly broad view of First Amendment rights such as the freedom of speech and of the press, although he thought that the First Amendment applied directly only to the federal government. According to Harlan the freedom of speech was among the &quot;fundamental principles of liberty and justice&quot; and therefore applicable also to states, but less stringently than to the national government. Moreover, Justice Harlan believed that federal laws censoring &quot;obscene&quot; publications violated the free speech clause. Thus, he dissented from &quot;Roth v. United States&quot;, in which the Supreme Court upheld the validity of a federal obscenity law. At the same time, Harlan did not believe that the Constitution prevented the states from censoring obscenity. He explained in his &quot;Roth&quot; dissent:

The danger is perhaps not great if the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot; goes so far beyond the acceptable standards of candor that it will be deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly great if the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. ... The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so seems to me to be intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.

Harlan concurred in &quot;New York Times Co. v. Sullivan&quot;, which required public officials suing newspapers for libel to prove that the publisher had acted with &quot;actual malice.&quot; This stringent standard made it much more difficult for public officials to win libel cases. He did not, however, go as far as Justices Hugo Black and William O. Douglas, who suggested that all libel laws were unconstitutional. In &quot;Street v. New York&quot;, Harlan wrote the opinion of the court, ruling that the government could not punish an individual for insulting the American flag. In 1969 he noted that the Supreme Court had consistently &quot;rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication.&quot;

When Harlan was a Circuit Judge in 1955, he authorized the decision upholding the conviction of leaders of the Communist Party USA (including Elizabeth Gurley Flynn) under the Smith Act. The ruling was based on the previous Supreme Court&#x27;s decisions, by which the Court of Appeals was bound. Later, when he was a Supreme Court justice, Harlan, however, wrote an opinion overturning the conviction of Communist Party activists as unconstitutional in the case of &quot;Yates v. United States&quot;. Another such case was &quot;Watkins v. United States&quot;.

Harlan penned the majority opinion in &quot;Cohen v. California&quot;, holding that wearing a jacket emblazoned with the words &quot;Fuck the Draft&quot; was speech protected by the First Amendment. His opinion was later described by constitutional law expert Professor Yale Kamisar as one of the greatest ever written on freedom of expression. In the &quot;Cohen&quot; opinion, Harlan famously wrote &quot;one man&#x27;s vulgarity is another&#x27;s lyric,&quot; a quote that was later denounced by Robert Bork as &quot;moral relativism&quot;.

Justice Harlan is credited for establishing that the First Amendment protects the freedom of association. In &quot;NAACP v. Alabama&quot;, Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the court, invalidating an Alabama law that required the NAACP to disclose membership lists. However he did not believe that individuals were entitled to exercise their First Amendment rights wherever they pleased. He joined in &quot;Adderley v. Florida&quot;, which controversially upheld a trespassing conviction for protesters who demonstrated on government property. He dissented from &quot;Brown v. Louisiana&quot;, in which the Court held that protesters were entitled to engage in a sit-in at a public library. Likewise, he disagreed with &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines&quot;, in which the Supreme Court ruled that students had the right to wear armbands (as a form of protest) in public schools.

===Criminal procedure===
During the 1960s the Warren Court made a series of rulings expanding the rights of criminal defendants. In some instances, Justice Harlan concurred in the result, while in many other cases he found himself in dissent. Harlan was usually joined by the other moderate members of the Court: Justices Potter Stewart, Tom Clark, and Byron White.

Most notably, Harlan dissented from Supreme Court rulings restricting interrogation techniques used by law enforcement officers. For example, he dissented from the Court&#x27;s holding in &quot;Escobedo v. Illinois&quot;, that the police could not refuse to honor a suspect&#x27;s request to consult with his lawyer during an interrogation. Harlan called the rule &quot;ill-conceived&quot; and suggested that it &quot;unjustifiably fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement.&quot; He disagreed with &quot;Miranda v. Arizona&quot;, which required law enforcement officials to warn a suspect of his rights before questioning him (see Miranda warning). He closed his dissenting opinion with a quotation from his predecessor, Justice Robert H. Jackson: &quot;This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added.&quot;

In &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright&quot;, Justice Harlan agreed that the Constitution required states to provide attorneys for defendants who could not afford their own counsel. However, he believed that this requirement applied only at trial, and not on appeal; thus, he dissented from &quot;Douglas v. California&quot;.

Harlan wrote the majority opinion in &quot;Leary v. United States&quot;—a case that declared the Marijuana Tax Act unconstitutional based on the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination.

Justice Harlan&#x27;s concurrence in &quot;Katz v. United States&quot; set forth the test for determining whether government conduct constituted a search. In this case the Supreme Court held that eavesdropping on the petitioner&#x27;s telephone conversation constituted a search in the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and thus required a warrant. According to Justice Harlan, there is a two-part requirement for a search: (1) that the individual have a subjective expectation of privacy; and (2) that the individual&#x27;s expectation of privacy is &quot;one that society is prepared to recognize as &#x27;reasonable.&#x27;&quot;

===Voting rights===

Justice Harlan rejected the theory that the Constitution enshrined the so-called &quot;one man, one vote&quot; principle, or the principle that legislative districts must be roughly equal in population. In this regard, he shared the views of Justice Felix Frankfurter, who in &quot;Colegrove v. Green&quot; admonished the courts to stay out of the &quot;political thicket&quot; of reapportionment. The Supreme Court, however, disagreed with Harlan in a series of rulings during the 1960s. The first case in this line of rulings was &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;. The Court ruled that the courts had jurisdiction over malapportionment issues and therefore were entitled to review the validity of district boundaries. Harlan, however, dissented, on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that malapportionment violated their individual rights.

Then, in &quot;Wesberry v. Sanders&quot;, the Supreme Court, relying on the Constitution&#x27;s requirement that the United States House of Representatives be elected &quot;by the People of the several States,&quot; ruled that congressional districts in any particular state must be approximately equal in population. Harlan vigorously dissented, writing, &quot;I had not expected to witness the day when the Supreme Court of the United States would render a decision which casts grave doubt on the constitutionality of the composition of the House of Representatives. It is not an exaggeration to say that such is the effect of today&#x27;s decision.&quot; He proceeded to argue that the Court&#x27;s decision was inconsistent with both the history and text of the Constitution; moreover, he claimed that only Congress, not the judiciary, had the power to require congressional districts with equal populations.

Harlan was the sole dissenter in &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, in which the Court relied on the Equal Protection Clause to extend the one man, one vote principle to state legislative districts. He analyzed the language and history of the Fourteenth Amendment, and concluded that the Equal Protection Clause was never intended to encompass voting rights. Because the Fifteenth Amendment would have been superfluous if the Fourteenth Amendment (the basis of the reapportionment decisions) had conferred a general right to vote, he claimed that the Constitution did not require states to adhere to the one man, one vote principle, and that the Court was merely imposing its own political theories on the nation. He suggested, in addition, that the problem of malapportionment was one that should be solved by the political process, and not by litigation. He wrote:

This Court, limited in function in accordance with that premise, does not serve its high purpose when it exceeds its authority, even to satisfy justified impatience with the slow workings of the political process. For when, in the name of constitutional interpretation, the Court adds something to the Constitution that was deliberately excluded from it, the Court, in reality, substitutes its view of what should be so for the amending process.

For similar reasons, Harlan dissented from &quot;Carrington v. Rash&quot;, in which the Court held that voter qualifications were subject to scrutiny under the equal protection clause. He claimed in his dissent, &quot;the Court totally ignores, as it did in last Term&#x27;s reapportionment cases ... all the history of the Fourteenth Amendment and the course of judicial decisions which together plainly show that the Equal Protection Clause was not intended to touch state electoral matters.&quot; Similarly, Justice Harlan disagreed with the Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections&quot;, invalidating the use of the poll tax as a qualification to vote.

==Retirement and death==
John M. Harlan&#x27;s health began to deteriorate towards the end of his career. His eyesight began to fail during the late 1960s. To cover this, he would bring materials to within an inch of his eyes, and have clerks and his wife read to him (once when the Court took an obscenity case, a chagrined Harlan had his wife read him &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;). Gravely ill, he retired from the Supreme Court on September 23, 1971.

Harlan died from spinal cancer three months later, on December 29, 1971. He was buried at the Emmanuel Church Cemetery in Weston, Connecticut. President Richard Nixon considered nominating Mildred Lillie, a California appeals court judge, to fill the vacant seat; Lillie would have been the first female nominee to the Supreme Court. However, Nixon decided against Lillie&#x27;s nomination after the American Bar Association found Lillie to be unqualified. Thereafter, Nixon nominated William Rehnquist (a future Chief Justice), who was confirmed by the Senate.

Despite his many dissents, Harlan has been described as one of the most influential Supreme Court justices of the twentieth century. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1960. Harlan&#x27;s extensive professional and Supreme Court papers (343 cubic feet) were donated to Princeton University, where they are housed at the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library and open to research. Other papers repose at several other libraries. Ethel Harlan, his wife, outlived him by only a few months and died on June 12, 1972. She suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for the last seven years of her life.

<text>Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, Hashimoto&#x27;s disease and autoimmune thyroiditis, is an autoimmune disease in which the thyroid gland is gradually destroyed.

Early on, symptoms may not be noticed. Over time, the thyroid may enlarge, forming a painless goiter. Most people eventually develop hypothyroidism with accompanying weight gain, fatigue, constipation, hair loss, and general pains. After many years the thyroid typically shrinks in size. Potential complications include thyroid lymphoma. Further complications of hypothyroidism can include high cholesterol, heart disease, heart failure, high blood pressure, myxedema, and potential problems in pregnancy.
Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include a family history of the condition and having another autoimmune disease. Diagnosis is confirmed with blood tests for TSH, Thyroxine (T4), antithyroid autoantibodies, and ultrasound. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include Graves&#x27; disease and nontoxic nodular goiter.
Hashimoto&#x27;s is typically not treated unless there is hypothyroidism, or the presence of a goiter, when it may be treated with levothyroxine. Those affected should avoid eating large amounts of iodine; however, sufficient iodine is required especially during pregnancy. Surgery is rarely required to treat the goiter.
Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis has a global prevalence of 7.5%, and varies greatly by region. The highest rate is in Africa, and the lowest in Asia. In the US white people are affected more often than black. It is more common in low to middle income groups. Females are more susceptible with a 17.5% rate of prevalence compared to 6% in males. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in developed countries. It typically begins between the ages of 30 and 50. Rates of the disease have increased. It was first described by the Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto in 1912. Studies in 1956 discovered that it was an autoimmune disorder.
==Signs and symptoms==
=== Signs ===
Early stages of autoimmune thyroiditis may have a normal physical exam with or without a goiter. A goiter is a diffuse, often symmetric, swelling of the thyroid gland visible in the anterior neck that may develop. The thyroid gland may become firm, large, and lobulated in Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, but changes in the thyroid can also be non-palpable. Enlargement of the thyroid is due to lymphocytic infiltration, and fibrosis.

While their role in the initial destruction of the follicles is unclear, antibodies against thyroid peroxidase or thyroglobulin are relevant, as they serve as biomarkers for detecting the disease and its severity. They are thought to be the secondary products of the T cell-mediated destruction of the gland.

As lymphocytic infiltration progresses, patients may exhibit signs of hypothyroidism in multiple bodily systems, including, but not limited to, a larger goiter, weight gain, cold intolerance, fatigue, myxedema, constipation, menstrual disturbances, pale or dry skin, and dry, brittle hair, depression, and ataxia. Extended thyroid hormone deficiency may lead to muscle fibre changes, with fast-twitching type II being replaced by slow-twitching type-I fibers, resulting in muscle weakness, muscle pain, stiffness, and rarely, pseudohypertrophy.

While rare, more serious complications of the hypothyroidism resulting from autoimmune thyroiditis are pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, both of which require further medical attention, and myxedema coma, which is an endocrine emergency.

Patients with goiters who have had autoimmune thyroiditis for many years might see their goiter shrink in the later stages of the disease due to destruction of the thyroid.

Graves disease may occur before or after the development of autoimmune thyroiditis.

=== Symptoms ===
Many symptoms are attributed to the development of Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis. Symptoms can include: fatigue, weight gain, pale or puffy face, feeling cold, joint and muscle pain, constipation, dry and thinning hair, heavy menstrual flow or irregular periods, depression, a slowed heart rate, problems getting pregnant, miscarriages, and myopathy.

Some patients in the early stage of the disease may experience symptoms of hyperthyroidism due to the release of thyroid hormones from intermittent thyroid destruction (aka destructive thyrotoxicosis).

While most symptoms are attributed to hypothyroidism, similar symptoms are observed in Hashimoto&#x27;s patients with normal thyroid hormone levels. According to one study, these symptoms may include lower quality of life, and issues of the &quot;digestive system (abdominal distension, constipation and diarrhea), endocrine system (chilliness, gain weight and facial edema), neuropsychiatric system (forgetfulness, anxiety, depressed, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, and indifferent [&quot;sic&quot;]) and mucocutaneous system (dry skin, pruritus, and hair loss).&quot; 

In non-medical settings, the term &quot;flare&quot; is used to refer to a sudden exacerbation of symptoms, whether hyper or hypo. 
== Causes ==
The causes of Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis are complex. Around 80% of the risk of developing an autoimmune thyroid disorder is due to genetic factors, while the remaining 20% is related to environmental factors (such as iodine, drugs, infection, stress, radiation).

=== Genetics ===
Thyroid autoimmunity can be familial. Many patients report a family history of autoimmune thyroiditis or Graves&#x27; disease. The strong genetic component is borne out in studies on monozygotic twins, with a concordance of 38–55%, with an even higher concordance of circulating thyroid antibodies not in relation to clinical presentation (up to 80% in monozygotic twins). Neither result was seen to a similar degree in dizygotic twins, offering strong favour for high genetic etiology.

The genes implicated vary in different ethnic groups and the impact of these genes on the disease differs significantly among people from different ethnic groups. A gene that has a large effect in one ethnic group&#x27;s risk of developing Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis might have a much smaller effect in another ethnic group.

The incidence of autoimmune thyroid disorders is increased in people with chromosomal disorders, including Turner, Down, and Klinefelter syndromes.

==== HLA genes ====
The first gene locus associated with autoimmune thyroid disease was the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6p21. It encodes human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). Specific HLA alleles have a higher affinity to auto-antigenic thyroidal peptides and can contribute to autoimmune thyroid disease development. Specifically, in Hashimoto&#x27;s disease, aberrant expression of HLA II on thyrocytes has been demonstrated. They can present thyroid autoantigens and initiate autoimmune thyroid disease. Susceptibility alleles are not consistent in Hashimoto&#x27;s disease. In Caucasians, various alleles are reported to be associated with the disease, including DR3, DR5, and DQ7.

==== CTLA-4 genes ====
CTLA-4 is the second major immune-regulatory gene related to autoimmune thyroid disease. CTLA-4 gene polymorphisms may contribute to the reduced inhibition of T-cell proliferation and increase susceptibility to autoimmune response. CTLA-4 is a major thyroid autoantibody susceptibility gene. A linkage of the CTLA-4 region to the presence of thyroid autoantibodies was demonstrated by a whole-genome linkage analysis. CTLA-4 was confirmed as the main locus for thyroid autoantibodies.

====PTPN22 gene====
&quot;PTPN22&quot; is the most recently identified immune-regulatory gene associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. It is located on chromosome 1p13 and expressed in lymphocytes. It acts as a negative regulator of T-cell activation. Mutation in this gene is a risk factor for many autoimmune diseases. Weaker T-cell signaling may lead to impaired thymic deletion of autoreactive T cells, and increased PTPN22 function may result in inhibition of regulatory T cells, which protect against autoimmunity.

==== Immune-related genes ====
IFN-γ promotes cell-mediated cytotoxicity against thyroid mutations causing increased production of IFN-γ were associated with the severity of hypothyroidism. Severe hypothyroidism is associated with mutations leading to lower production of IL-4 (Th2 cytokine suppressing cell-mediated autoimmunity), lower secretion of TGF-β (inhibitor of cytokine production), and mutations of FOXP3, an essential regulatory factor for the regulatory T cells (Tregs) development. Development of Hashimoto&#x27;s disease was associated with mutation of the gene for TNF-α (stimulator of the IFN-γ production), causing its higher concentration.

=== Existential (endogenous environmental) ===

==== Sex ====
Study of healthy Danish twins divided to three groups (monozygotic and dizygotic same sex, and opposite sex twin pairs) estimated that genetic contribution to thyroid peroxidase antibodies susceptibility was 61% in males and 72% in females, and contribution to thyroglobulin antibodies susceptibility was 39% in males and 75% in females.

The high female predominance in thyroid autoimmunity may be associated with the X chromosome. It contains sex and immune-related genes responsible for immune tolerance.
A higher incidence of thyroid autoimmunity was reported in patients with a higher rate of X-chromosome monosomy in peripheral white blood cells. 

==== X-chromosome inactivation ====
Another potential mechanism might be skewed X-chromosome inactivation, leading to the escape of X-linked self-antigens from presentation in the thymus and loss of T-cell tolerance.

==== Pregnancy ====
In one population study, two or more births were a risk factor for developing autoimmune hypothyroidism in pre-menopausal women.

=== Environmental ===

==== Medications ====
Certain medications or drugs have been associated with altering and interfering with thyroid function. There are two main mechanisms of interference:

* Altering thyroid hormone serum transfer proteins. Estrogen, tamoxifen, heroin, methadone, clofibrate, 5-fluorouracil, mitotane, and perphenazine all increase thyroid binding globulin (TBG) concentration. Androgens, anabolic steroids such as danazol, glucocorticoids, and slow release nicotinic acid all decrease TBG concentrations. Furosemide, fenoflenac, mefenamic acid, salicylates, phenytoin, diazepam, sulphonylureas, free fatty acids, and heparin all interfere with thyroid hormone binding to TBG and/or transthyretin.
* Altering extra-thryoidal metabolism of thyroid hormone. Propylthiouracil, glucocorticoids, propranolol, iondinated contrast agents, amiodarone, and clomipramine all inhibit conversion of T4 and T3. Phenobarbital, rifampin, phenytoin and carbamazepine all increase hepatic metabolism. Finally, cholestryamine, colestipol, aluminium hydroxide, ferrous sulphate, and sucralfate are all drugs that decrease T4 absorption or enhance excretion.

==== Iodine ====
Excessive iodine intake is a well-established environmental factor for triggering thyroid autoimmunity. Thyroid autoantibodies are found to be more prevalent in geographical areas with a higher dietary iodine levels. Several mechanisms by which iodine may promote thyroid autoimmunity have been proposed:

* Via thyroglobulin iodination: Iodine exposure leads to higher iodination of thyroglobulin, increasing its immunogenicity by creating new iodine-containing epitopes or exposing cryptic epitopes. It may facilitate presentation of thyroglobulin by antigen-presenting cells, and enhance the binding affinity of the T-cell receptor. &quot;Sufficiently Iodinated&quot; thyroglobulin may activate Tg-specific T-cells.
* Via thyrocyte damage: Iodine exposure has been shown to increase the level of reactive oxygen species. They enhance the expression of the intracellular adhesion molecule-1 on the thyrocytes, which could attract the immunocompetent cells into the thyroid gland. Additionally, such oxidative elements may bind to &quot;proteins, nucleic acids and membrane lipids&quot; forming compounds which damage cell integrity. Oxidative stress may cause cell necrosis and the release of autoantigens. Iodine also promotes thyrocyte apoptosis.
* Via immune cell behaviour: Iodine has an influence on immune cells (stimulation of macrophages, augmented maturation of dendritic cells, increased number of T cells, stimulated B-cell immunoglobulin production). 

Data from the Danish Investigation of Iodine Intake and Thyroid Disease shows that within two cohorts (males, females) with moderate and mild iodine deficiency, the levels of both thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies are higher in females, and prevalence rates of both antibodies increase with age.

==== Comorbidities ====
Comorbid autoimmune diseases are a risk factor for developing Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis, and the opposite is also true. Another thyroid disease closely associated with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis is Graves&#x27; disease. Autoimmune diseases affecting other organs most commonly associated with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, alopecia, Addison disease, Sjogren&#x27;s syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis Autoimmune thyroiditis has also been seen in patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes type 1 and 2.

==== Other ====
Other environmental factors include selenium deficiency, infectious diseases such as hepatitis C, rubella, and possibly Covid-19, toxins, dietary factors, radiation exposure, and gut dysbiosis.

==Mechanism==
The pathophysiology of autoimmune thyroiditis is not well understood. However, once the disease is established, its core processes have been observed:

Hashimoto&#x27;s Thyroiditis is a T-lymphocyte mediated attack on the thyroid gland. T helper 1 cells trigger macrophages and cytotoxic lymphocytes to destroy thyroid follicular cells, while T helper 2 cells stimulate the excessive production of B cells and plasma cells which generate antibodies against the thyroid antigens, leading to thyroiditis. The three major antibodies are: Thyroid peroxidase Antibodies (TPOAb), Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb), and Thyroid stimulating hormone receptor Antibodies (TRAb), with TPOAb and TgAb being most commonly implicated in Hashimotos. They are hypothesized to develop as a result of thyroid damage, where T-lymphocytes are sensitized to residual thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin, rather than as the initial cause of thyroid damage. However, they may exacerbate further thyroid destruction by binding the complement system and triggering apoptosis of thyroid cells. TPO antibody levels may correlate with the degree of lymphocyte infiltration of the thyroid.

Gross morphological changes within the thyroid are seen in the general enlargement, which is far more locally nodular and irregular than more diffuse patterns (such as that of hyperthyroidism). While the capsule is intact and the gland itself is still distinct from surrounding tissue, microscopic examination can provide a more revealing indication of the level of damage.

Hypothyroidism is caused by replacement of follicular cells with parenchymatous tissue.

Partial regeneration of the thyroid tissue can occur, but this has not been observed to normalise hormonal levels. 

=== Pathology ===
Gross pathology of a thyroid with autoimmune thyroiditis may show an symmetrically enlarged thyroid. It is often paler in color, in comparison to normal thyroid tissue which is reddish-brown. 

Microscopic examination (histology) will show diffuse parenchymal infiltration by lymphocytes including plasma B-cells. The lymphocytes are predominately T-lymphocytes with a representation of both CD4 positive and CD8 positive cells. The plasma cells are polyclonal, with present germinal centers resembling the structure of a lymph node (aka secondary lymphoid follicles, not to be confused with the normally present colloid-filled follicles that constitute the thyroid). 

Atrophic colloid follicles are lined by Hürthle cells (cells with intensely eosinophilic and granular cytoplasm, which are a metaplasia of the normal cuboidal cells that line the thyroid follicles). 

Fibrous tissue may be found throughout the affected thyroid as well. In late stages of the disease, the thyroid may be atrophic. Severe thyroid atrophy presents often with denser fibrotic bands of collagen that remains within the confines of the thyroid capsule.

Generally, pathological findings of the thyroid are related to the amount of existing thyroid function - the more infiltration and fibrosis, the less likely a patient will have normal thyroid function. 

A rare but serious complication is thyroid lymphoma, generally the B-cell type, non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

==Diagnosis==
=== Tests ===
Some or all of the following tests may be performed, in any order:

==== Physical exam ====
Physicians will often start by assessing reported symptoms and performing a thorough physical exam, including a neck exam. On gross examination, a hard goiter that is not painful to the touch often presents; other symptoms seen with hypothyroidism, such as periorbital myxedema, depend on the current state of progression of the response, especially given the usually gradual development of clinically relevant hypothyroidism.

==== Antithyroid antibodies tests====
Tests for antibodies against thyroid peroxidase, thyroglobulin, and thyrotropin receptors can detect autoimmune processes against the thyroid. However, seronegative (without circulating autoantibodies) thyroiditis is also possible. There may be circulating antibodies before the onset any symptoms.

==== Ultrasound ====

An ultrasound may be useful in detecting Hashimoto thyroiditis, especially in those with seronegative thyroiditis, or when patients have normal laboratory values but symptoms of autoimmune thyroiditis. Key features detected in the ultrasound of a person with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis include &quot;echogenicity, heterogeneity, hypervascularity, and presence of small cysts.&quot; Images obtained with ultrasound can evaluate the size of the thyroid, reveal the presence of nodules, or provide clues to the diagnosis of other thyroid conditions.

==== Nuclear medicine ====
Nuclear imaging showing thyroid uptake can also be helpful in diagnosing thyroid function, particularly differential diagnosis.

==== TSH plasma serum concentration test ====
To detect if the pituitary is stimulating an underperforming thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secretion from the anterior pituitary increases in response to decreased serum thyroid hormones. If elevated, it signifies hypothyroidism. The elevation is usually a marked increase over the normal range. TSH is the preferred initial test of thyroid function as it has a higher sensitivity to changes in thyroid status than free T4.

Biotin can cause this test to read &quot;falsely low&quot;. Time of day can affect the results of this test; TSH peaks early in the morning and slumps in the late afternoon to early evening, with &quot;a variation in TSH by a mean of between 0.95 mIU/mL to 2.0 mIU/mL&quot;. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed more often in samples taken soon after waking. 

==== T3 or T4 levels test ====
To detect a lack of thyroid hormones (hypothyroidism), or excess of thyroid hormones (hyperthyroidism). The two thyroid hormones are Thyroxine (T4) and Tri-iodothyronine (T3). T4 and T3 can be measured by their total amount, or free amount. As the free amount reflects the amount available to body tissues, the most treatment-relevant measures for thyroid disorders are Free T3 and Free T4. Typically, Free T4 is the preferred test for hypothyroidism, as Free T3 immunoassay tests are less reliable at detecting low levels of thyroid hormone, and they are more susceptible to interference. Free T4 levels will usually be lowered, but sometimes might be normal.

Immunoassay tests of Free T4 and Free T3 may overestimate concentrations, particularly at low thyroid hormone levels, which is why results are typically read in conjunction with TSH, a more sensitive measure. LC-MSMS assays are rarer, but they are &quot;highly specific, sensitive, precise, and can detect hormones found in low concentrations.&quot;

==== Muscle Biopsy ====
Muscle biopsy is not necessary for diagnosis of myopathy due to hypothyroid muscle fibre changes, however it may reveal confirmatory features.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for Hashimoto&#x27;s Thyroiditis. There is currently no known way to stop auto-immune lymphocytes infiltrating the thyroid or to stimulate regeneration of thyroid tissue. However, the condition can be managed.
===Managing hormone levels===

Hypothyroidism caused by Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis is treated with thyroid hormone replacement agents such as levothyroxine (LT4), liothyronine (LT3), or desiccated thyroid extract (T4+T3). A tablet or liquid taken once a day generally keeps the thyroid hormone levels normal. In most cases, the treatment needs to be taken for the rest of the person&#x27;s life.

The standard of care is levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, which is an oral medication identical in molecular structure to endogenous thyroxine (T4). Levothyroxine sodium has a sodium salt added to increase the gastrointestinal absorption of levothyroxine. Levothyroxine has the benefits of a long half-life leading to stable thyroid hormone levels, ease of monitoring, excellent safety and efficacy record, and usefulness in pregnancy as it can cross the fetal blood-brain barrier. 

Levothyroxine dosing to normalise TSH is based on the amount of residual endogenous thyroid function and the patient’s weight, particularly lean body mass. The dose can be adjusted based upon each patient, for example, the dose may be lowered for elderly patients or patients with certain cardiac conditions, but should be increased in pregnant patients. It should be administered on a consistent schedule. Levothyroxine may be dosed daily or weekly, however weekly dosing may be associated with higher TSH levels, elevated thyroid hormone levels, and transient &quot;echocardiographic changes in some patients following 2-4 h of thyroxine intake&quot;.

Some patients elect combination therapy with both levothyroxine and liothyronine, which is identical in molecular structure to tri-iodothyronine (T3), however studies of combination therapy are limited, and five meta-analyses/reviews &quot;suggested no clear advantage of the combination therapy.&quot; However, subgroup analysis found that patients who remain the most symptomatic while taking levothyroxine may benefit from therapy containing liothyronine.

There is a lack of evidence around the benefits, long-term effects and side effects of dessicated thyroid extract. It is no longer recommended for the treatment of hypothyroidism.

==== Side Effects ====
Side effects of thyroid replacement therapy are associated with &quot;inadequate or excessive doses.&quot; Symptoms to watch for include, but are not limited to, anxiety, tremor, weight loss, heat sensitivity, diarrhea, and shortness of breath. More worrisome symptoms include atrial fibrillation and bone density loss.

Long term over-treatment is associated with increased mortality and dementia.

==== Monitoring ====
Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) is the laboratory value of choice for monitoring response to treatment with levothyroxine. When treatment is first initiated, TSH levels may be monitored as often as a frequency of every 6–8 weeks. Each time the dose is adjusted, TSH levels may be measured at that frequency until the correct dose is determined. Once titrated to a proper dose, TSH levels will be monitored yearly. The target level for TSH is the subject of debate, with factors like age, sex, individual needs and special circumstances such as pregnancy being considered. Recent studies suggest that adjusting therapy based on thyroid hormone levels (T4 and/or T3) may be important.

Monitoring liothyronine treatment or combination treatment can be challenging. Liothyronine can suppress TSH to a greater extent than levothyroxine. Short-acting Liothyronine&#x27;s short half-life can result in large fluctuations of free T3 over the course of 24 hours.

Patients may have to adjust their dosage several times over the course of the disease. Endogenous thyroid hormone levels may fluctuate, particularly early in the disease. Patients may sometimes develop hyperthyroidism, even after long-term treatment. This can be due to a number of factors including acute attacks of destructive thyrotoxicosis (autoimmune attacks on the thyroid resulting in rises in thyroid hormone levels as thyroid hormones leak out of the damaged tissues). This is usually followed by hypothyroidism. 
==== Reverse T3 ====
Measuring reverse tri-iodothyronine (rT3) is often mentioned in the lay (non-medical) press as a possible marker to inform T4 or T3 therapy, &quot;however, there is currently no evidence to support this application&quot; as of 2023. Although cited in the lay press as a possible competitor to T3, it is unlikely that rT3 causes hypothyroid symptoms by out-competing T3 for thyroid hormone receptors, as it has a binding affinity 200 times weaker. It is also unlikely that rT3 causes poor T4 to T3 conversion; despite being demonstrated &quot;in vivo&quot; to have the potential to inhibit DIO-mediated T4 to T3 conversion, this is considered improbable at normal body hormone concentrations.

=== Persistent Symptoms ===
Multiple studies have demonstrated persistent symptoms in Hashimotos patients with normal thyroid hormone levels (euthyroid) and an estimated 10%-15% of patients treated with levothyroxine monotherapy are dissatisfied due to persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism. Several different hypothesised causes are discussed in the medical literature:

==== Low tissue tri-iodothyronine (T3) hypothesis ====
Peripheral tissue T4 to T3 conversion may be inadequate. Some patients on LT4 monotherapy may have blood T3 levels low or below the normal range, and/or may have local T3 deficiency in some tissues.

Although both molecules can have biological effects, thyroxine (T4) is considered the &quot;storage form&quot; of thyroid hormone, while tri-iodothyronine (T3) is considered the active form used by body tissues. The body must convert thyroxine into tri-iodothyronine in order to have biological effects. Tri-iodothyronine is produced primarily by conversion in the liver, kidney, skeletal muscle and pituitary gland. Possible reasons for poor conversion include:

* Insufficient nutrients. Sufficient levels of the micronutrients zinc, selenium, iron, and possibly vitamin A are important for adequate conversion. 
* Conversion rates may decline with age. 
* Possible contribution of gene polymorphisms. Since deiodinase type 2 is necessary for T4 to T3 conversion in some peripheral tissues, &quot;patients with &quot;DIO2&quot; gene polymorphisms may have variable peripheral T3 availability&quot;, leading to localised hypothyroidism in some tissues. For these patients, levothyroxine monotherapy may not be sufficient and patients may have improvement on combination therapy. Thr92Ala &quot;DIO2&quot; polymorphism is present in 12–36% of the population.

Patients with impaired conversion may be recommended combination therapy of both levothyroxine and liothyronine. As standard immunoassay tests can overestimate blood T4 and T3 levels, Ultrafiltration LC-MSMS T4 and T3 tests may help to identify patients who would benefit from additional T3. 

==== Inadequate markers hypothesis ====
There is ongoing debate about how to define euthyroidism and whether TSH is its best indicator. TSH may be useful to detect poor thyroid output and may reflect the state of thyroid hormones in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, but not the presence of hormones in other body tissues. As a result, LT4 monotherapy may not result in a &quot;truly biochemically euthyroid state.&quot; Patients may express a preference for &quot;low normal or below normal TSH values&quot; and/or T4 and T3 monitoring. The monitoring of other biomarkers that reflect the action of thyroid hormone on tissues has also been proposed.

As immunoassay Free T3 and Free T4 tests can overestimate levels, particularly at low thyroid hormone levels, hypothyroidism may be undertreated. LC-MSMS tests may provide more reliable measures.

==== Extra-thyroidal effects of autoimmunity hypothesis ====
It is hypothesised that autoimmunity may play some role in euthyroid symptoms. Hypothesised mechanisms include the proposal that TPO-antibody-producing lymphocytes may travel out of the thyroid to other tissue, creating symptoms and inflammation due to cross-reaction, or &quot;the inflammatory nature of [...] persistently increased circulating cytokine levels.&quot; Multiple studies find that antibodies coincide with symptoms even in euthyroid patients, and higher levels are associated with increased symptoms, however &quot;the found association does not prove a causality&quot;. No treatment currently exists for Hashimotos autoimmunity, although observed wellbeing improvements after surgical thyroid removal are hypothesised to be due to removing the autoimmune stimulus.

==== Physical and psychosocial co-morbidities hypothesis ====
It is hypothesised that symptoms may not be due to Hashimotos or hypothyroidism, but some other &quot;physical and psychosocial co-morbidities&quot;.

=== Other influences on thyroid hormone levels ===
Zinc may increase free T3 levels. A small pilot study found Ashwagandha Root may increase T3 and T4 levels, however, there&#x27;s a lack of strong evidence of this benefit and Ashwagandha has a potential to cause adrenal insufficiency.

=== Improving wellbeing ===
Some patients may perceive improved wellbeing while in thyrotoxicosis, however overtreatment has risks (known risks for levothyroxine and unknown risks for liothyronine).

One study demonstrated surgical thyroid removal may substantially improve fatigue and wellbeing, see Surgery considerations, below.

=== Reducing antibodies ===
It is not established that reducing antithyroid antibodies in Hashimoto&#x27;s has benefits. A systematic review and meta-analysis of selenium trials found that while selenium reduces TPO antibodies, there was a lack of evidence of effects on &quot;disease remission, progression, lowered levothyroxine dose or improved quality of life&quot;.

Selenium, vitamin D, and metformin can reduce thyroid peroxidase antibodies. There is preliminary evidence that levothyroxine, aloe vera juice and black cumin seed may reduce thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Metformin can reduce thyroglobulin antibodies.

It is not established that a gluten-free diet can reduce antibodies when there is no comorbid coeliac disease. Gluten free diets have been shown in several studies to reduce antibodies, and in other studies to have no effect, however there were significant confounding issues in these studies, including not ruling out comorbid coeliac disease.

One study found surgical thyroid removal can substantially reduce anti-thyroid antibody levels, see Surgery considerations, below.

=== Surgery considerations ===
Surgery is not the initial treatment of choice for autoimmune disease, and uncomplicated Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis is not an indication for thyroidectomy. Patients generally may discuss surgery with their doctor if they are experiencing significant pressure symptoms, or cosmetic concerns, or have nodules present on ultrasound. One well-conducted study of patients with troublesome general symptoms and with anti-thyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) levels greater than 1000 IU/ml (normal &lt;100 IU/ml) showed that total thyroidectomy caused the symptoms to resolve and median anti-thyroid peroxidase levels to reduce from 2232 to 152 IU/mL, but post-operative complications were higher than expected: infection (4.1%), permanent hypoparathyroidism (4.1%) and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (5.5%).

=== Other ===
As of 2022, there has been only one study of low-dose naltrexone in Hashimotos, which did not demonstrate efficacy, therefore nothing supports its use; Removing dairy products in those without lactose intolerance has not been found to be supported. While soy isoflavones have the potential to theoretically affect T3 and T4 production, studies in those with sufficient iodine find no effect.

==Prognosis==
Overt, symptomatic thyroid dysfunction is the most common complication, with about 5% of people with subclinical hypothyroidism and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis progressing to thyroid failure every year. Transient periods of thyrotoxicosis (over-activity of the thyroid) sometimes occur, and rarely the illness may progress to full hyperthyroid Graves&#x27; disease with active orbitopathy (bulging, inflamed eyes).

Rare cases of fibrous autoimmune thyroiditis present with severe shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing, resembling aggressive thyroid tumors, but such symptoms always improve with surgery or corticosteroid therapy. Although primary thyroid B-cell lymphoma affects fewer than one in 1000 persons, it is more likely to affect those with long-standing autoimmune thyroiditis, as there is a 67- to 80-fold increased risk of developing primary thyroid lymphoma in patients with Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis.

Myopathy as a result of muscle fibre changes due to thyroid hormone deficiency may take months or years of thyroid hormone treatment to resolve.

=== Anti-thyroid antibodies ===
Thyroid peroxidase antibodies typically (but not always) decline in patients treated with levothyroxine, with decreases varying between 10% and 90% after a follow-up of 6 to 24 months. One study of patients treated with levothyroxine observed that 35 out of 38 patients (92%) had declines in thyroid peroxidase antibody levels over five years, lowering by 70% on average. 6 of the 38 patients (16%) had thyroid peroxidase antibody levels return to normal.

=== Children ===
Many children diagnosed with Hashimoto&#x27;s disease will experience the same progressive course of the disease that adults do. However, of children who develop anti-thyroid antibodies and hypothyroidism, up to 50% are later observed to have normal antibodies and thyroid hormone levels.

One case of true remission has been observed in a 12-year-old girl. Her thyroid was observed via ultrasound to progress from early inflammation to severe end-stage Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis with hypothyroidism, and then return to &quot;almost normal with only minimal features of inflammation&quot; and euthyroidism.

==Epidemiology==
Hashimoto&#x27;s Disease is estimated to affect 2% of the world&#x27;s population. About 1.0 to 1.5 in 1000 people have this disease at any time.

=== Sex ===
Anyone may develop this disease, but it occurs between 8 and 15 times more often in women than in men. Some research suggests a connection to the role of the placenta as an explanation for the sex difference. The difference in prevalence amongst genders is due to the effects of sex hormones.

=== High iodine consumption ===
Autoimmune thyroiditis has a higher prevalence in societies that have a higher intake of iodine in their diet, such as the United States and Japan, and among people who are genetically susceptible. It is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in areas of sufficient iodine. Also, the rate of lymphocytic infiltration increased in areas where the iodine intake was once low, but increased due to iodine supplementation.

Iodine deficiency disorder is combated using an increase in iodine in a person&#x27;s diet. When a dramatic change occurs in a person&#x27;s diet, they become more at-risk of developing hypothyroidism and other thyroid disorders. Treating iodine deficiency disorder with high salt intakes should be done carefully and cautiously as risk for Hashimoto&#x27;s may increase.

=== Geographic influence of dietary trends ===
Geography plays a large role in which regions have access to diets with low or high iodine. Iodine levels in both water and salt should be heavily monitored in order to protect at-risk populations from developing hypothyroidism.

Geographic trends of hypothyroidism vary across the world as different places have different ways of defining disease and reporting cases. Populations that are spread out or defined poorly may skew data in unexpected ways.

=== North America ===
Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis may affect up to 5% of the United States&#x27; population. Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis disorder is thought to be the most common cause of primary hypothyroidism in North America.

=== Age ===
It has been shown that the prevalence of positive tests for thyroid antibodies increases with age, &quot;with a frequency as high as 33 percent in women 70 years old or older.&quot;

Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis can occur at any age, including children, but more commonly appears in middle age, particularly for men. Incidence peaks in the fifth decade of life, but patients are usually diagnosed between age 30–50. The highest prevalence from one study was found in the elderly members of the community.

=== Race ===
The prevalence of Hashimoto&#x27;s varies geographically. The highest rate is in Africa, and the lowest in Asia. In the US, the African-American population experiences it less commonly but has greater associated mortality.

=== Autoimmune diseases ===
Those that already have an autoimmune disease are at greater risk of developing Hashimoto&#x27;s as the diseases generally coexist with each other. See Causes &gt; Comorbidities, above.

=== Secular trends ===
The secular trends of hypothyroidism reveal how the disease has changed over the course of time given changes in technology and treatment options. Even though ultrasound technology and treatment options have improved, the incidence of hypothyroidism has increased according to data focused on the US and Europe. Between 1993 and 2001, per 1000 women, the disease was found varying between 3.9 and 4.89. Between 1994 and 2001, per 1000 men, the disease increased from 0.65 to 1.01.

Changes in the definition of hypothyroidism and treatment options modify the incidence and prevalence of the disease overall. Treatment using levothyroxine is individualized, and therefore allows the disease to be more manageable with time but does not work as a cure for the disease.

==History==
Also known as Hashimoto&#x27;s disease, Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis is named after Japanese physician Hakaru Hashimoto (1881−1934) of the medical school at Kyushu University, who first described the symptoms of persons with &quot;struma lymphomatosa&quot;, an intense infiltration of lymphocytes within the thyroid, in 1912 in the German journal called . This paper was made up of 30 pages and 5 illustrations all describing the histological changes in the thyroid tissue. Furthermore, all results in his first study were collected from four women. These results explained the pathological characteristics observed in these women especially the infiltration of lymphocyte and plasma cells as well as the formation of lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, fibrosis, degenerated thyroid epithelial cells and leukocytes in the lumen. He described these traits to be histologically similar to those of Mikulic&#x27;s disease. As mentioned above, once he discovered these traits in this new disease, he named the disease &quot;struma lymphomatosa.&quot; This disease emphasized the lymphocyte infiltration and formation of the lymphoid follicles with germinal centers, neither of which had ever been previously reported.

Despite Dr. Hashimoto&#x27;s discovery and publication, the disease was not recognized as distinct from Reidel&#x27;s thyroiditis, which was a common disease at that time in Europe. Although many other articles were reported and published by other researchers, Hashimoto&#x27;s struma lymphomatosa was only recognized as an early phase of Reidel&#x27;s thyroiditis in the early 1900s. It was not until 1931 that the disease was recognized as a disease in its own right, when researchers Allen Graham et al. from Cleveland reported its symptoms and presentation in the same detailed manner as Hashimoto.

In 1956, Drs. Rose and Witebsky were able to demonstrate how immunization of certain rodents with extracts of other rodents&#x27; thyroid resembled the disease Hakaru and other researchers were trying to describe. These doctors were also able to describe anti-thyroglobulin antibodies in blood serum samples from these same animals.

Later on in the same year, researchers from the Middlesex Hospital in London were able to perform human experiments on patients who presented with similar symptoms. They purified anti-thyroglobulin antibody from their serum and were able to conclude that these sick patients had an immunological reaction to human thyroglobulin. From this data, it was proposed that Hashimoto&#x27;s struma could be an autoimmune disease of the thyroid gland.

&quot;Following these discoveries, the concept of organ-specific autoimmune disease was established and HT recognized as one such disease.&quot;

Following this recognition, the same researchers from Middlesex Hospital published an article in 1962 in &quot;The Lancet&quot; that included a portrait of Hakaru Hashimoto. The disease became more well known from that moment, and Hashimoto&#x27;s disease started to appear more frequently in textbooks.

== Pregnancy ==

=== Conception ===
It is recommended that hypothyroidism be treated with levothyoxine before conception, to prevent adverse effects on the course of the pregnancy and on the development of the child. In IVF, embryo transfer is improved when hypothyroidism is treated.

=== Pregnancy ===
The Endocrine Society recommends screening in pregnant women who are considered high-risk for thyroid autoimmune disease. Universal screening for thyroid diseases during pregnancy is controversial, however, one study &quot;supports the potential benefit of universal screening&quot;.

Pregnant women may have antithyroid antibodies (5%–14% of pregnancies), poor thyroid function resulting in hypothyroidism, or both. Each is associated with risks.

==== Anti-thyroid antibodies in pregnancy ====
The presence of Thyroid peroxidase antibodies at the outset of pregnancy are associated with a greater risk to the mother of hypothyroidism and thyroid impairment in the first year after delivery.

The presence of antibodies is also associated with &quot;a 2 to 4-fold increase in the risk of recurrent miscarriages, and 2 to 3-fold increased risk of preterm birth&quot;, however the reason why is unclear. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are speculated to indicate other autoimmune processes against the placental-fetal unit.

Levothyroxine treatment in euthyroid women with thyroid autoimmunity does not significantly impact the relative risk of miscarriage and preterm delivery, or outcomes with live birth. &quot;Therefore, no strong recommendations regarding the therapy in such scenarios could be made, but consideration on a case-by-case basis might be implemented.&quot;

==== Hypothyroidism in pregnancy. ====
Women who have low thyroid function that has not been stabilized are at greater risk of complications for both parent and child. Risks to the mother include gestational hypertension including preeclampsia and eclampsia, gestational diabetes, placental abruption, and postpartum hemorrhage. Risks to the infant include miscarriage, preterm delivery, low birth weight, neonatal respiratory distress, hydrocephalus, hypospadias, fetal death, infant intensive care unit admission, and neurodevelopmental delays (lower child IQ, language delay or global developmental delay).

Successful pregnancy outcomes are improved when hypothyroidism is treated. Levothyroxine treatment may be considered at lower TSH levels in pregnancy than in standard treatment. Liothyronine does not cross the fetal blood-brain barrier, so liothyronine (T3) only or liothyronine + levothyroxine (T3 + T4) therapy is not indicated in pregnancy.

Close cooperation between the endocrinologist and obstetrician benefits the woman and the infant.

==== Immune changes during pregnancy ====
Hormonal changes and trophoblast expression of key immunomodulatory molecules lead to immunosuppression and fetal tolerance. The main players in regulation of the immune response are Tregs. Both cell-mediated and humoral immune responses are attenuated, resulting in immune tolerance and suppression of autoimmunity. It has been reported that during pregnancy, levels of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies decrease.

=== Postpartum ===
Thyroid peroxidase antibodies testing is recommended for women who have ever been pregnant regardless of pregnancy outcome. &quot;[P]revious pregnancy plays a major role in development of autoimmune overt hypothyroidism in premenopausal women, and the number of previous pregnancies should be taken into account when evaluating the risk of hypothyroidism in a young women [&quot;sic&quot;].&quot;

Postpartum thyroiditis can occur in women with Hashimoto&#x27;s. In healthy women, Postpartum thyroiditis can occur up to 1 year after delivery and should be differentiated from Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis as it is treated differently.

After giving birth, Tregs rapidly decrease and immune responses are re-established. It may lead to the occurrence or aggravation of autoimmune thyroid disease. In up to 50% of females with thyroid peroxidase antibodies in the early pregnancy, thyroid autoimmunity in the postpartum period exacerbates in the form of postpartum thyroiditis. Higher secretion of IFN-γ and IL-4, and lower plasma cortisol concentration during pregnancy has been reported in females with postpartum thyroiditis than in healthy females. It indicates that weaker immunosuppression during pregnancy could contribute to the postpartum thyroid dysfunction.

=== Fetal microchimerism ===

Several years after the delivery, the chimeric male cells can be detected in the maternal peripheral blood, thyroid, lung, skin, or lymph nodes. The fetal immune cells in the maternal thyroid gland may become activated and act as a trigger that may initiate or exaggerate the autoimmune thyroid disease. In Hashimoto&#x27;s disease patients, fetal microchimeric cells were detected in thyroid in significantly higher numbers than in healthy females.

== Other animals ==
Hashimoto&#x27;s disease is known to occur in chickens, rats, mice, dogs, and marmosets, but Graves&#x27; disease does not.

== Pseudoscience ==
Pseudoscientific claims and &quot;rogue practitioners&quot; pose increasing risks to patients. &quot;We have seen practitioners who proclaim themselves to be experts in hormonal therapy without any formal training and who often promote hormonal treatments without adequate endocrine evaluations. We have seen practitioners who make astonishing promises regarding the benefits of herbal, supplemental, and other unproven therapies that they themselves sell in their offices and/or online. And we have seen what we know to be frankly harmful and even dangerous products that contain animal whole organ (most commonly thyroid and/or adrenal) extracts or hormonal injections that produce highly elevated levels of sex hormones (especially testosterone) without any concern for short-term patient safety or longterm outcomes. And we have heard anecdotal stories from patients who visited these practitioners and had no beneficial results or frankly concerning on-treatment results at a surprisingly high financial cost, even though they had been promised symptom improvement, safety, and full insurance coverage.&quot;

<text>Mark Anthony Whiten (born November 25, 1966) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and switch-hitting batter, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays (–), Cleveland Indians (1991–, –), St. Louis Cardinals (–), Boston Red Sox (), Philadelphia Phillies (), Atlanta Braves (1996), Seattle Mariners (1996), and New York Yankees (). He became known by the nickname &quot;Hard-Hittin&#x27;&quot; Mark Whiten. In 1993, Whiten became the 12th player in major league history to hit four home runs in a single game and tied the all-time single game RBI record with 12.

==Early life==
Whiten was born in Pensacola, Florida on November 25, 1966. He did not play baseball competitively until his senior year at Pensacola High School but managed to earn a scholarship to play baseball at Pensacola State College.

==Career==
===Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Indians===

He was selected by Toronto in the 1986 amateur draft and made his major league debut in the 1990 season. Whiten was an up-and-down player. He had one of the best outfield arms in the 1990s. He hit for power too, but his mental lapses hurt him in the field and at the plate. The Blue Jays had little patience with his development and sent him to Cleveland. After two seasons with the Indians he was sent to the Cardinals.

===St. Louis Cardinals===
In his first season with St. Louis, Whiten recorded nine outfield assists, fifth-best in the National League. On September 7, 1993, he gained notability with his performance against the Cincinnati Reds in the second game of a doubleheader. Whiten hit four home runs and drove in 12 runs, tying the all-time single-game records in both categories in the process. He also tied the major league mark for runs batted in in a doubleheader (13), set by Nate Colbert in 1972. Whiten became the 12th player in major league history to hit four home runs in one game; he and Jim Bottomley are the only two players with 12 RBI in one game.

During the same season, he belted a 464-foot homer into the upper deck at Three Rivers Stadium, becoming the first visiting player to reach the right-field overhang. He finished that year with a .253 batting average, to go along with 25 home runs and 99 RBI.

===Later career===
Whiten suffered through pulled rib cage muscles early at the 1994 season that limited him to play in 92 games. Injuries would limit him to no more than 136 games a season. Over the following six seasons, he played for six teams, including a second stint with Cleveland. In 1997, Whiten faced sexual assault charges while playing with the New York Yankees. On July 31, 1998, Whiten pitched his only inning of professional ball, for Cleveland against the Oakland Athletics. He walked two and gave up a hit and an earned run, but also struck out the side (which included future AL MVP Miguel Tejada). He thus has a perfect career K/9 ratio of 27.

In his 11-year major-league career, Whiten had a .259 batting average, with 105 home runs, 423 RBIs, 465 runs scored, 804 hits, 129 doubles, 20 triples, and 70 stolen bases in 939 games. He resumed his playing career with the Long Island Ducks in the Atlantic League.

<text>SAP Center at San Jose (originally known as San Jose Arena and HP Pavilion at San Jose) is an indoor arena located in San Jose, California. Its primary tenant is the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League, for which the arena has earned the nickname &quot;The Shark Tank&quot;.

==History==
Plans for a San Jose arena began in the mid-1980s, when a group of local citizens formed Fund Arena Now (FAN). The group contacted city officials and pursued potential sponsors and partners from the NHL and NBA. In the late 1980s, mayor Tom McEnery met with FAN, and subsequently a measure to allocate local taxes for arena construction came up for a public vote on June 7, 1988, passing by a narrow margin.

In 1991, soon after construction began, the NHL granted an expansion franchise to San Jose. After it was discovered that the arena would not be suitable for NBA or NHL use as originally designed, the Sharks requested an upgrade to NHL standards, including the addition of luxury suites, a press box, and increased seating capacity.

In 1993, the arena was completed and initially named the &quot;San Jose Arena&quot;.

For the 1996–97 NBA season, the arena served as home to the Golden State Warriors while their regular home court in Oakland (now known as Oakland Arena) was under renovation.

In 2001, naming rights were sold to Compaq, and it was renamed &quot;Compaq Center at San Jose&quot; (not to be confused with the Compaq Center (formerly The Summit) in Houston, Texas). After HP purchased Compaq in 2002, the arena was renamed &quot;HP Pavilion&quot;, the same name as one of its computer models.

In late April 2007, it was announced that the HP Pavilion at San Jose would be receiving several building improvements, including a new center-hung LED video display system from Daktronics similar to that of the TD Garden, home of the Boston Bruins of the NHL.

In June 2013, German software company SAP (co-founded by Sharks managing partner Hasso Plattner, who is also SAP&#x27;s chairman of the board) purchased the naming rights to the facility in a five-year deal worth US$3.35 million per year. The arena was renamed &quot;SAP Center at San Jose&quot; upon approval by the San Jose City Council.

In September 2022, a new center-hung system from Daktronics that doubled the surface of the old video display system was debuted ahead of the 2022-23 NHL season. The four main LED displays measure approximately 23 feet high by 41 feet wide and the size of the 14 newly installed displays total at more than 9,300 square feet of surface area.

In April 2023, construction was announced on a new 10,000-square-foot penthouse lounge, with seven suites and three rows of regular seating being converted to accommodate the project. With the new premium seating completed, the arena&#x27;s total attendance capacity for hockey games changed from 17,562 to 17,435.

==Events==
In 2006, SAP Center sold the most tickets (633,435) to non-sporting events of any venue in the Western United States, and the fourth highest total in the world, after Madison Square Garden in New York City (US), the Manchester Arena in Manchester (UK), and Scotiabank Arena in Toronto (Canada).

Other events hosted at the arena include the 1996 United States Figure Skating Championships, the 47th National Hockey League All-Star Game in 1997, the 1999 NCAA Women&#x27;s Final Four, ArenaBowl XVI in 2002, the 2007 USA Gymnastics Visa Championships, and UFC 139 on November 19, 2011. Intel Extreme Masters Season IX – San Jose in 2014 and Intel Extreme Masters Season X – San Jose were held at the venue. Prior to Super Bowl 50 in nearby Santa Clara, the arena housed introductory media activities for the event. SAP Center hosted games 3, 4, and 6 of the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals in the Sharks&#x27; first appearance in franchise history, with the Cup being presented to the series-winning Pittsburgh Penguins after game 6. In 2012 and 2016, the arena played host to the USA Gymnastics Olympic Trials. The arena was the host to the West Regional semifinals and finals of the 2002, 2007, and 2017 NCAA men&#x27;s basketball tournaments; as well as first- and second-round games of the 2010, 2013, and 2019 tournaments.

Mixed Martial Arts events have played a big role at SAP Center. The MMA organization Strikeforce held many events in San Jose beginning with in 2006, then in 2009, through 2012 with . The first Bellator MMA organization event at SAP was Bellator MMA &amp; Glory: Dynamite 1 in September 2015 and since has held 6 total events with the most recent being Bellator 199 on May 16, 2018. SAP Center has also been the host of premiere MMA promotion the UFC. The first event was UFC 139 on November 19, 2011, then UFC on Fuel TV: Muñoz vs. Weidman on July 11, 2012, UFC on Fox: Henderson vs. Melendez on April 20, 2013, and most recently UFC on Fox: Lawler vs. Brown on July 26, 2014.

On September 18, 2016, the arena hosted the Kellogg&#x27;s Tour of Gymnastics Champions.

The annual US Figure Skating Championships have been staged here in San Jose five times now — 1996, 2012, 2018, 2021 and 2023.

SAP Center has also hosted WWE Pay Per Views. Royal Rumble (1998), SummerSlam (2001), The Great American Bash (2007), Payback (2017) took place where Braun Strowman defeated Roman Reigns in the main event. took place at SAP Center.

<text>The San Jose SaberCats were a professional arena football team based in San Jose, California. The SaberCats had been members of the Arena Football League (AFL) since 1995 (the year in which the team was founded); and until 2015, they belonged to the AFL&#x27;s National Conference. Over nineteen seasons of play, the SaberCats emerged as one of the Arena Football League&#x27;s most successful franchises; at the conclusion of the 2015 season, the SaberCats boasted a lifetime regular season record of 198–98. Moreover, the SaberCats had won a total of four AFL Championships (2002, 2004, 2007, and 2015). Their lifetime postseason record stood at 19–12.

In the club&#x27;s first four seasons (1995–1998), the team played just above mediocre, but still qualified for the playoffs three out of the four years, losing in the opening round each time under the guidance of Todd Shell. In 1999, the SaberCats appointed eventual owner-general manager Darren Arbet to the position of head coach. Under Arbet&#x27;s guidance, the team&#x27;s fortunes improved dramatically. In 2000, the SaberCats won a post-season game.

The SaberCats&#x27; run of success intensified in the 2000s; during that time, they won seven division titles and played in three American Conference championship games. In 2002, the team captured its first ArenaBowl championship by defeating the Arizona Rattlers in ArenaBowl XVI. In 2004, the SaberCats won a second championship by defeating the Rattlers in ArenaBowl XVIII. In 2007, they defeated the Columbus Destroyers in ArenaBowl XXI to capture a third championship. In 2008, the SaberCats returned to the ArenaBowl, only to fall to the Philadelphia Soul. In 2015, the SaberCats returned to the ArenaBowl, defeating the Jacksonville Sharks.

The 2009 demise of the AFL caused the SaberCats to take a two-year hiatus. They returned to the re-formed Arena Football League in 2011 (along with several other franchises). The SaberCats posted a disappointing record of 7–11 in the season of their return. The losing season was the organization&#x27;s first since 1999 and remained the worst in franchise history. While the SaberCats&#x27; regular season performance improved greatly over the following three seasons (between 2012 and 2014, they went 38–16), their postseason performance did not; over that span, they went 1–3 (with all three losses coming at the hands of the Arizona Rattlers, who subsequently won the ArenaBowl in each season). In 2015, the SaberCats finished the regular season with a franchise-best record of 17–1. After dispatching the Portland Thunder easily in the first round of the playoffs, they again faced the Rattlers; this time, however, San Jose emerged victorious. For a list of all seasons, see List of San Jose SaberCats seasons

On November 12, 2015, the league announced the SaberCats would be ceasing operations due to &quot;reasons unrelated to League operations.&quot; A statement from the league indicated that the AFL was working to secure new, long-term owners for the franchise, but no such group has emerged. In 2019, it was announced that the Indoor Football League would be expanding to Oakland with of the Oakland Panthers, bringing arena football back to the Bay Area for the first time since the SaberCats demise. The Panthers ended up moving to the SAP Center itself in 2022 as the Bay Area Panthers.

The SaberCats came into existence in December 1994, when the Arena Football League awarded an expansion team to businesswoman Ramune Ambrozaitis, Lafayette attorney David Frey and John Fry of Fry&#x27;s Electronics. The group of three owners got a bargain when they were awarded the franchise, paying only US$750,000 of the $1.25 million the AFL typically requested of an expansion team. The team played at the San Jose Arena in San Jose, California, which is also home to the San Jose Sharks franchise of the National Hockey League. The SaberCats named Todd Shell, a former San Francisco 49ers linebacker, as the team&#x27;s first head coach. The SaberCats competed in the Western Division of the American Conference. The SaberCats are one of Arena&#x27;s premier organizations, having never drawn below 10,000 fans at any of their home games. The SaberCats were ArenaBowl champions in 2002, 2004, and 2007, beating the Arizona Rattlers for their first two titles and the Columbus Destroyers for the third. The San Jose SaberCats did play in a fourth ArenaBowl, ArenaBowl XXII, but lost to the Philadelphia Soul. ArenaBowl XXII would be the last game played in the originally incarnation of the AFL.

On June 5, 2004, the SaberCats were fined $20,000 for violations during their quarterfinal round playoff game against the Tampa Bay Storm. They were first fined $10,000 for distributing cow bells, without advance approval, to fans entering the building, which was cited as a violation by the AFL as an intentional competitive advantage generated by the creation of artificial noise. Also, during the game itself, the SaberCats refused to apply microphones to certain players and coaches during the NBC broadcast, which led to an additional $10,000 fine.

The cowbells went on to become a mainstay of many perennial season ticket holders, even though the SaberCats never again distributed cowbells to fans after the incident in 2004.

San Jose was 9–7 in 2005, earning the fourth seed in the American Conference playoffs. They lost to #1 seed Colorado Crush 56–48 in the first round, after failing to score on six goal line opportunities in the final minute of play.

The SaberCats went 10–6 in 2006 and won a division title in the process, along with the AC&#x27;s #2 seed. They got a bye week from the wild-card round and then beat the Arizona Rattlers in the divisional round, 62–48. Because the Colorado Crush (the AC&#x27;s #1 seed) lost in the divisional round to the Chicago Rush, they hosted the American Conference Championship game; however, they lost the game, 59–56.

In 2007, they got revenge against the Rush in the American Conference championship and advanced to ArenaBowl XXI, where they beat the Columbus Destroyers in front of a sellout crowd in New Orleans Arena and claimed their third Arena Bowl title in six seasons.

=== AFL collapse and revival (2009–2010)===
On August 4, 2009, the Arena Football League announced that it was &quot;suspending operations indefinitely&quot; but likely to fold. The SaberCats announced shortly afterward that they intend to field a team for 2010, even if it means moving to a new indoor football league.

When the formation of a new arena football league, Arena Football 1 (renamed the new Arena Football League), was announced in 2009, the SaberCats were not one of the initial 16 teams announced. Bossier-Shreveport Battle Wings owner Dan Newman mentioned that the SaberCats were one of at least two former AFL franchises with which negotiations were in progress, the other being the Tampa Bay Storm. However, when AF1 announced its schedule in January 2010, the SaberCats were not among the 15 teams listed. At the time, it was unclear whether they would join another league, or join the new AFL later.

They would be replaced by the smaller and lesser-known San Jose Wolves of the AIFA as they contemplate their future. The Wolves do not play at HP Pavilion as the SaberCats have, rather at the Cow Palace in Daly City.

On June 16, it was officially announced that the SaberCats would be returning in 2011 as a member of the Arena Football League. The ownership once again consists of major executives from national electronics chain Fry&#x27;s Electronics (John Fry, William Randy Fry, David Fry, and Kathryn J. Kolder), and in addition maintained former SaberCats coach Darren Arbet.

=== 2011 season ===
The SaberCats opened their 2011 season with a 76–48 victory over the Spokane Shock. They went on to win against the Kansas City Command 60–57. The SaberCats lost the next two games, 54–41 against the Chicago Rush, and 76–69 against the Iowa Barnstormers. It looked like the &#x27;Cats were going on a winning streak after they won the next three games (75–55 against the Utah Blaze, 42–33 against the Tulsa Talons, and 68–61 against the Philadelphia Soul), but after a bye week they went on a devastating seven game losing streak (65–43 against the Arizona Rattlers, 54–48 against the Pittsburgh Power, 76–68 against the Utah Blaze, 55–49 against the Georgia Force, 70–57 against the Dallas Vigilantes, 64–57 against the Arizona Rattlers, and 82–21 against the Cleveland Gladiators). This losing streak ended against the Jacksonville Sharks when they won 83–70. The SaberCats ended the season with a 7–11 record.

===2012 season===
Unlike their disappointing 2011 campaign, the SaberCats were able to clinch a playoff spot as the #3 seed, finishing the regular season with a 12–6 record. However, they were defeated 48–51 by the Arizona Rattlers in the first round of the playoffs.

===2013 season===
The SaberCats finished the regular season with a 13–5 record, earning the #4 seed in the National Conference. They lost the National Conference Semifinals to the Arizona Rattlers by a score of 59–49.

===2014 season===
The SaberCats finished the regular season with a record of 13–5 for the second consecutive year, winning the Pacific Division and earning the #2 seed in the National Conference. They won the National Conference Semifinals against the Spokane Shock in a 55–28 contest but lost the Conference Championship to the Arizona Rattlers by a 72–56 score.

===2015 season===
The SaberCats finished the regular season with a franchise best 17–1 record (their only loss was against the 4–14 L.A. Kiss), winning the Pacific Division and earning the #1 seed in the National Conference with homefield advantage throughout the playoffs. They won the National Conference Semifinals against the Portland Thunder by a score of 55–28 and then won the Conference Championship against the Arizona Rattlers in a 70–67 contest. They won ArenaBowl XXVIII against the Jacksonville Sharks, finishing the 2015 season with a combined 20–1 record and becoming the first team in league history to win twenty combined regular season and postseason games. However, due to scheduling conflicts at the SAP Center, the SaberCats were forced to play all but one playoff game–including the ArenaBowl–at Stockton Arena in Stockton, north of San Jose. The Frys lobbied to move the game from its original August 29 date to August 31 so it could be played in San Jose. However, the league refused, citing its contract with ESPN.

Surprisingly, after the 2015 season, the AFL announced that the SaberCats were ceasing operations for non-football related reasons. According to &quot;Metro Silicon Valley,&quot; the Frys were concerned about the rampant instability that had prevailed in the league since it returned to the field.

Controversy surrounded the closing of the franchise in 2015. The SaberCats&#x27; franchise never returned the Foster Trophy to the league, the award handed out to each Arena Bowl champion throughout the league&#x27;s history. Also, the players of the Arena Bowl XXVIII never received championship rings, becoming the first team in league history to never receive rings for the accomplishment.

===Season-by-season===
==Championships==
The SaberCats won a total of four ArenaBowls, all while under Darren Arbet.

==Rivals==
The San Jose SaberCats had two primary rivals: Their divisional rival Spokane Shock, and their former division rival, the Arizona Rattlers. They also have rivalries with other teams that arose from playoff battles in the past, most notably with the Chicago Rush. The Los Angeles Avengers had an old rivalry with San Jose as well, but the rivalry became irrelevant when the Avengers became defunct in 2009.

===Arizona Rattlers===
The Rattlers and SaberCats were divisional rivals from 1995 to 2013, but the division alignment for 2014 put San Jose in the Pacific division and Arizona in the west. The SaberCats had a 7-game winning streak against the Rattlers from 2006 to 2008, lasted until May 7, 2011, when the Rattlers defeated the SaberCats 43–65. While the SaberCats still hold the advantage in the all-time series 26–22 (21–18 in the regular season and 5–4 in the playoffs), the Rattlers amassed 9 wins in 12 games, from the 1995 season before the arrival of SaberCats head coach Darren Arbet, through the 2000 season. On Saturday May 5, 2012 the SaberCats beat the Rattlers 77–70 (at US Airways Center), giving the SaberCats the most points scored in a game against the Rattlers in the team&#x27;s history. The SaberCats&#x27; first ever ArenaBowl appearance (in the 2002 season) was a victory over the Rattlers.

===Spokane Shock===
The Shock and the SaberCats have been divisional rivals since the SaberCats re-joined the AFL in 2011. San Jose lost a Saturday June 23, 2012 game (63–90), and this game remains the highest ever point total scored against the SaberCats in franchise history. In 2011, the Shock won 63–61 on a last second Hail Mary from Kyle Rowley to Adron Tennell, clinching a playoff spot for the Shock and eliminating the SaberCats from playoff contention. San Jose led the overall series 5–4 when the Shock departed the AFL.

==Broadcasting==
The SaberCats game had been broadcast on KNBR AM 1050 out of San Mateo. However, on May 15, 2015, the SaberCats announced that they would have their games broadcast live on KDOW AM 1220 radio in San Francisco. This was the first broadcast of sports of any kind for that station.

<text>The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters is a collection of short stories by American writer Ursula K. Le Guin, named after a line from A. E. Housman&#x27;s &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;, and first published by Harper &amp; Row in 1975. A retrospective of Le Guin&#x27;s short stories, it collects 17 previously published pieces of speculative fiction. Four of these were the germs of novels she was to write later, and a few others shared connections to Le Guin novels. At least four stories are set in the Hainish Universe, and two others in &quot;Earthsea&quot;. Many stories share themes and motifs, including time and utopia: certain images and characters also recur, including isolated scholars or explorers seeking knowledge in a hostile world.

&quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot; won the Locus Award for best single author collection in 1976. Several stories had won awards upon initial publication. The collection was critically well-received. Several contemporary reviewers wrote that it showcased Le Guin&#x27;s development as an author, and highlighted Le Guin&#x27;s introduction to each story as giving insight into her writing. Scholar Suzanne Reid wrote in 1997 that the stories showcased Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;wide range of talents and ethical concerns&quot; and praising her comfort with widely varied settings. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described it as &quot;First-rate Le Guin&quot;, while the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; praised Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;startlingly original approach to the genre&quot; in the collection.

== Contents ==
&quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot; was first published in 1975 by Harper &amp; Row, and was republished in standalone editions and omnibus volumes several times. It collects 17 previously published stories. Most appear unchanged from their original publication: &quot;Nine Lives&quot; was published as originally written, and &quot;Winter&#x27;s King&quot; was considerably rewritten. Literary scholar Barbara Bucknall divides the stories into three approximate categories: early fantasies, &quot;surrealistic&quot; later fantasies described by Le Guin as &quot;psychomyths&quot;, and science fiction stories. Le Guin considered four stories to be the germs of novels she was to write later: &quot;The Word of Unbinding&quot; and &quot;The Rule of Names&quot; were Le Guin&#x27;s first pieces set in Earthsea; &quot;Semley&#x27;s Necklace&quot; was first published as &quot;Dowry of the Angyar&quot; in 1964 and then as the prologue of the novel &quot;Rocannon&#x27;s World&quot; in 1966; and &quot;Winter&#x27;s King&quot; is about the inhabitants of the planet Winter, as is Le Guin&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;The Left Hand of Darkness&quot;. Several of the other stories are also connected to Le Guin&#x27;s novels. The protagonist of &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot; was an inspiration for the society depicted in &quot;The Dispossessed&quot; (1974), and the short story is described as a prologue to that novel, though it was written later. Like Le Guin&#x27;s later novel &quot;The Word for World Is Forest&quot;, &quot;Vaster than Empires and More Slow&quot; has an immense forest as a setting, and examines the relationship between humans and their natural environment. 

The stories are arranged approximately in order of publication, and although they share little direct connection, several share themes and motifs. Four stories are part of the Hainish Cycle, while Bucknall writes that &quot;Nine Lives&quot; could plausibly belong in that loose grouping as well. Three stories — &quot;Winter&#x27;s King&quot;, &quot;Vaster Than Empires and More Slow&quot;, and &quot;Semley&#x27;s Necklace&quot; — touch on the effects of relativistic time dilation. Two others, &quot;April in Paris&quot; and &quot;Darkness Box&quot;, also feature time as a prominent theme. Literary scholar Suzanne Reid writes that &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; shares philosophical underpinnings with the utopian experiment depicted in &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;, while &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot; examines the life of Odo, who inspired the society of &quot;The Dispossessed&quot;. &quot;The Masters&quot; and &quot;The Stars Below&quot; both concern &quot;science as an idea to be cherished&quot; even in the face of authoritarian opposition to it. Literary scholar Charlotte Spivack writes that &quot;The Field of Vision&quot; also contains thematic similarities, in its exploration of science and religion, though it features a futuristic setting. Scholar Elizabeth Cummins links &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot; and &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; to &quot;The Field of Vision&quot;, writing that they &quot;show Le Guin&#x27;s continued concern with utopia&quot;. The collection as a whole, in Bucknall&#x27;s view, moves from &quot;tender, romantic&quot; pieces to ones that Le Guin describes as concerning &quot;something stronger, harder and more complex&quot;, showcasing a shift from &quot;private concerns to public ones&quot;. Literary scholar Susan Wood suggested that the collection shared broad themes, including a &quot;concern with the nature of truth&quot; and the &quot;right way to live&quot;. The collection also had recurring images and characters, in Wood&#x27;s view, including motifs of light and darkness, and isolated characters seeking knowledge in a hostile world.

===List of stories===
== Reception ==

&quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot; was positively received by critics, though, according to Spivack, reviewers were generally less favorable toward Le Guin&#x27;s short stories than her novels. A reviewer in the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; wrote that Le Guin was the &quot;ideal science fiction writer for readers who ordinarily dislike science fiction&quot;, which Spivack attributes to Le Guin&#x27;s exploration of the &quot;ideas and psychological implications&quot; of science rather than its technological aspects. The &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; similarly praised Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;startlingly original approach to the genre&quot; in the collection. A review in &quot;The New Republic&quot; found the science fiction stories, and particularly those exploring plausibly scientific possibilities, most effective. A review in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; praised the collection as &quot;First-rate Le Guin&quot;, describing it as a &quot;retrospective&quot; of the a decade of Le Guin&#x27;s writing and a demonstration of her &quot;special talent&quot; for speculative fiction. Susan Wood wrote that the collection was a good showcase of Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;rapid development as a writer&quot; in the period following the publication of her first stories, and that the collection was essential to understanding Le Guin. The &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; called the book a &quot;collection of excellence only a handful of writers can match&quot;. Multiple reviews called attention to the author&#x27;s notes that preceded each story, with the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; saying they &quot;[threw] some light on the workings of one of the most original minds in the genre&quot;. Reid wrote in 1997 that the stories showcased Le Guin&#x27;s &quot;wide range of talents and ethical concerns&quot; and praising her comfort with widely varied settings. A review in the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; said that the collection &quot;certainly stands on its own&quot;, and praised Le Guin&#x27;s characterization in particular.

Commentators favorably highlighted a variety of individual stories. Wood called particular attention to &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, &quot;Winter&#x27;s King&quot;, and &quot;Vaster Than Empires and More Slow&quot;, writing that in each, scientific extrapolation was used as a &quot;framework for powerful psychological studies&quot;. Reid, writing in 1997, also highlighted &quot;Vaster Than Empires and More Slow&quot;, calling it a &quot;Le Guin classic&quot;, as well as &quot;April in Paris&quot;, praising Le Guin&#x27;s use of her knowledge of medieval French culture. Literary scholar Charlotte Spivack had similar praise for &quot;April in Paris&quot;, describing it as a &quot;delightful &quot;time&quot; fantasy&quot;. She also praised &quot;The Stars Below&quot; as an &quot;excellent science fiction story&quot;, and compared it favorably to the thematically similar &quot;The Masters&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; highlighted the stories &quot;April in Paris&quot;, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, and &quot;The Ones Who Walk from Omelas&quot; (sic), while the &quot;Salt Late Tribune&quot; reserved particular praise for &quot;Winter&#x27;s King&quot; and &quot;Semley&#x27;s Necklace&quot;. In a 2020 retrospective of the collection in &quot;Tor&quot;, Sean Guynes wrote that the four &quot;germinative&quot; stories that grew into novels were of interest largely because they hinted at Le Guin&#x27;s later explorations, but considered &quot;Semley&#x27;s Necklace&quot; &quot;beautifully written&quot; and &quot;The Rule of Names&quot; amusing. In contrast, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; had particular praise for &quot;Winter&#x27;s King&quot;. Guynes also praised &quot;April in Paris&quot; and &quot;The Good Trip&quot;, finding the other stories in the first half of the collection average. The rest of the volume, in contrast, received strong praise: Guynes wrote that they were &quot;heady, beautiful, and thought-provoking&quot;, written with a &quot;careful, sometimes quiet, power&quot;. Guynes concluded that the collection as a whole was &quot;multifaceted, intellectually rich, and artistically transformative&quot;. Guynes noted that many individual stories in the collection were among Le Guin&#x27;s most famous, including in particular &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; and &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot;. Scholar Donna White noted that those two stories, along with &quot;Nine Lives&quot; are among Le Guin&#x27;s most-anthologized stories.

=== Awards and honors ===
&quot;The Wind&#x27;s Twelve Quarters&quot; won the Locus Award for best single author collection in 1976. Science fiction editor and critic David G. Hartwell included it with 23 others on his list of the best short-story collections of the 1970s. Two of the stories in the volume won awards when first published. &quot;The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas&quot; was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Short Fiction and won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1974, while &quot;The Day Before the Revolution&quot; won the Nebula Award for Best Short Story, the Locus Award for best short story, and the Jupiter Award for short stories, all in 1975. It was also nominated for the 1975 Hugo Award for Best Short Story. Additionally, &quot;Winter&#x27;s King&quot; was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Short Story in 1970, and &quot;Vaster than Empires and More Slow&quot; was nominated for the same award in 1972, and came 14th in a poll for the Locus Award for Best Short Story, while &quot;Nine Lives&quot; was nominated for the Nebula Award for Best Short Story in 1970. &quot;Vaster than Empires and More Slow&quot;, &quot;The Field of Vision&quot;, and &quot;The Stars Below&quot; were all nominees for the Locus Award, in 1972, 1974, and 1975 respectively.

<doc id="660970" wikidata="Q729307" url="?curid=660970" title="Coffin ship">
<text>A coffin ship () is a popular idiom used to describe the ships that carried Irish migrants escaping the Great Irish Famine and Highlanders displaced by the Highland Clearances.

Coffin ships carrying emigrants, crowded and disease-ridden, with poor access to food and water, resulted in the deaths of many people as they crossed the Atlantic, and led to the 1847 North American typhus epidemic at quarantine stations in Canada. Owners of coffin ships provided as little food, water and living space as was legally possible, if they obeyed the law at all. With death rates commonly reaching 20 percent and horror stories of 50 percent dying, these vessels soon became known as &quot;coffin ships&quot;. Those who died were buried at sea.

While coffin ships were the cheapest way to cross the Atlantic, mortality rates of 30 percent aboard the coffin ships were common. It was said that sharks could be seen following the ships, because so many bodies were thrown overboard.

== Legislation ==
Legislation to protect emigrant passengers, the Passenger Vessels Act 1803 (43 Geo. 3. c. 56), was enacted in Britain and continued to evolve in the following decades. A revised act, the Passengers in Merchant Vessels Act 1828 (9 Geo. 4. c. 21), for example, marked the first time that the British government took an active interest in emigration matters. Within a few years, regulations were in force to determine the maximum number of passengers that a ship could carry, and to ensure that sufficient food and water be provided for the voyage.

But the legislation was not always enforceable, and unscrupulous shipowners and shipmasters found ways to circumvent the law. In addition, ships sailing from non-British ports were not subject to the legislation. As a consequence, thousands of emigrants experienced a miserable and often dangerous journey. By 1867, regulations were more effective, thus providing people with the promise of a safe, if not comfortable, voyage.

== Memorials ==
The National Famine Monument at the base of Croagh Patrick in Murrisk, County Mayo, Ireland depicts a coffin ship with skeletons and bones as rigging. Sculpted by John Behan, it is Ireland&#x27;s largest bronze sculpture. The &quot;Coffin Ship&quot; was unveiled by then President of Ireland Mary Robinson in 1997 to mark the 150th anniversary of the Irish Famine.

== In popular culture ==
Contrary to popular understanding, the term &quot;coffin ships&quot; was practically never used during the Great Famine itself (1845–1852). It appeared in Irish newspapers only once in a while in the years before and during the catastrophe but it was not popularized during that period nor did its use having anything to do with Irish nationalist politician Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee&#x27;s famous &quot;sailing coffins&quot; speech in March 1848.

In fact, the term &quot;coffin ship&quot; was popularized in the early 1870s by English Member of Parliament Samuel Plimsoll as part of his campaign for sailors&#x27; rights. It was later adopted by Irish nationalists during the Land War of the late 1870s and early 1880s as part of their twin campaign for land reform and political independence.

In The Pogues song &quot;Thousands Are Sailing&quot;, the ghost of an Irish immigrant laments, &quot;...on a coffin ship I came here/And I never even got so far that they could change my name.&quot;

The Dutton family of the &quot;Yellowstone&quot; universe is said in the prequel show &quot;1923&quot; to have been &quot;ravaged&quot; &quot;upon the coffin ships of Ireland&quot;.

The Kenn Gordon &amp; 1916 song &quot;The Ships&quot; describes how they were crammed in and not really expected to actually survive the journey that they had paid for. This included those from the Highland clearances of Sutherland and Caithness and poor Irish farmers.

Irish metal bands Cruachan and Primordial both have songs entitled &quot;The Coffin Ships&quot;. Primordial&#x27;s version was released on their 2005 album &quot;The Gathering Wilderness&quot;, whilst Cruachan&#x27;s (unrelated) song was written for their 2007 album &quot;The Morrigan&#x27;s Call&quot;. The Australian/Irish band Clann Zú also makes mention of coffin ships in the song &quot;Black Coats and Bandages&quot;.

Irish poet Eavan Boland mentions the coffin ships in her poem &quot;In a Bad Light&quot; from the collection &quot;In a Time of Violence&quot;, and in her memoir &quot;Object Lessons: The Life of the Woman and the Poet in Our Time&quot;.

Flogging Molly, an Irish-American celtic punk band, uses the term &quot;coffin ship&quot; in their song &quot;You Won&#x27;t Make a Fool Out of Me&quot; from their album &quot;Float&quot;. The quote is as follows:

Frank Herbert&#x27;s novel &quot;The White Plague&quot;, about a worldwide plague-like virus that only killed women, featured modern coffin ships which carried Irish people back home to their deaths, as demanded by the novel&#x27;s antagonist who had released the virus.

Irish writer Joseph O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 2004 novel &quot;Star of the Sea&quot; is set aboard a coffin ship and against the backdrop of the Irish famine. The book became an international bestseller.

The BibleCode Sundays song &quot;Mayo Moon&quot; describes a man preparing to leave for New York during the Great Famine of Ireland. It mentions the term &quot;Coffin Ship&quot; as it is waiting by the quay to take him away from here. The song continues the journey across the ocean as a storm rips the sails off and leaving the ship lost on the ocean. It finishes by describing all the passengers that had died on the crossing and the final sinking of the ship.

<text>Rumkale (; ) is a ruined fortress on the Euphrates, located in the province of Gaziantep and 50 km west of Şanlıurfa. 

Although Rumkale is sometimes linked with places mentioned in ancient sources, the foundations of the structure can be traced back to the Byzantine rule the earliest, when the fortress was the seat of a Syriac Orthodox bishopric. Rumkale evolved into a town when its Armenian civilian population grew in the 11th century. The fortress slipped away from the Byzantine rule when Philaretos Brachamios (), a Byzantine general of Armenian origin, usurped control of the region amidst the political turmoil caused by the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Rumkale then came under Kogh Vasil, whose adoptive son and successor Vasil Dgha was tortured by Baldwin II of Edessa and forced to relinquish his lands, including Rumkale, to the Crusader states in 1116. Sometime between 1148 and 1150, Catholicos Grigor III Pahlavuni purchased the fortress making it the headquarters of the Armenian Apostolic Church, although it continued to house Syriac Orthodox and Catholic representatives. The town later became part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, and by 1268, became isolated from the rest of the Cilician domains. 

In 1292, the castle was besieged and captured by the Mamluk Sultanate. From then on, it served as a significant outpost on the border with the Ilkhanate, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire. In 1516, Rumkale surrendered to the Ottoman army without a siege following the Mamluk defeat at the Battle of Marj Dabiq.

In 1831, the fortress was depopulated after the Ottoman forces suppressed the rebellion led by the local tax collector. The next year, Egyptian general Ibrahim Pasha bombarded the fortress during the Egyptian–Ottoman War.

==Names==
The site was historically known as , , or in Armenian. It was also known as Urumgala by the locals, and the 15th-century traveler Johann Schiltberger recorded it as Urumkala. In Syriac sources, the site was attested to as , and by the 11th century, and . Although the site was known as Rumkale and its variations throughout the entirety of its history from the medieval to late Ottoman period, it was renamed to following its capture by the Mamluk Sultanate in 1292.

==History==
===Antiquity===
Rumkale&#x27;s strategic location was known to the Assyrian Empire. Rumkale has been suggested to correspond to Shitamrat, which was taken by Shalmaneser III () in 855 BC, due to Rumkale&#x27;s location on a cliff, which is an uncommon feature among other structures in the region. It is said that John, an apostle of Jesus, lived in Rumkale during Roman times. Although it is possible that the site was fortified by the Roman Empire, no remains of periods earlier than 1000 CE have been identified at the site.

===Early medieval period===
From what remains of the fortress, the foundations may be traced back to the rule by the Byzantine Empire. The structure was potentially guarding the Byzantine frontier and the Roman road following the right bank of the Euphrates. The fortress housed a Syriac Orthodox bishopric during the 5–6th-centuries. Among its bishops were Uranius, who attended the Council of Antioch in 445, Maryiun, who took part in the consecration of Severus of Antioch and was later banished by Justin I (), and John, appointed by Jacob Baradaeus in mid-6th century. The site likely evolved into a settlement in the 11th century with the immigration of Armenians from the north as the Byzantine forces displaced a significant population from their lands. 

By the 1080s, the region was under Philaretos Brachamios (), a Byzantine-Armenian general who carved up parts of the empire with the defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. Later, Hromgla became one of Kogh Vasil&#x27;s domains, who was based in Kaysum to the north, and probably bore allegiance to Philaretos. Despite Kogh Vasil&#x27;s wish to ally with the Crusader states, his adopted son and successor Vasil Dgha was captured, tortured, and forced to relinquish his lands to Baldwin II of Edessa in 1116. The fortress likely was part of the Lordship of Marash until the downfall of the County of Edessa between 1144 and 1151. The population of Edessa fled to neighboring places following its capture in 1144, including Rumkale. Between about 1147 and 1150, Rumkale served as the prison for Syriac Orthodox Metropolitan Basil bar Shumna, who, after having escaped from Edessa&#x27;s second capture the previous year, was chained by Joscelin II, Count of Edessa.

With an Armenian bishop already present during that time, it was purchased by Gregory III from Beatrice of Turbessel in 1148 or 1150 to obtain a safe settlement for the Armenian Catholicosate. Gregory&#x27;s brother Nerses IV was elected as Armenian Catholicos here in 1166 and it seems that at this time a very considerable settlement existed there during his time that also housed representatives of the Syriac Orthodox and the Catholic Church. 
===Armenian Cilician period===
The castle became then part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia. In the 1170 and 1172, theological conferences exploring a union of churches were held at Hromgla between the Armenian Church and the Byzantine Church with the Syrian Orthox (Jacobite) Church sending observers. In 1179, a synod of 33 Armenian bishops took place in Hromgla came up with a compromise and sent a profession of faith to Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos, but he died in September 1180 before it reached him. From 1203 to 1293, it served as the residence of the Catholicos of the Armenian Church. The site became an important center for manuscript production, reaching its artistic peak under the Catholicos Constantine I who employed Toros Roslin, whose stylistic and iconographic innovations had profound influence on subsequent generations of Armenian art.
By 1268, Hromgla was isolated from the remainder of the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia and was attacked by a force of Mamluks of Egypt, which destroyed the town while it was unable to conquer the citadel. On 19 May 1280, the fortress was besieged by the Mamluk army. Sultan Qalawun () demanded the catholicos to relocate to Jerusalem or Cilicia. However, the siege was unsuccessful.

===Mamluk period===
In 1292, the castle was captured following a protracted siege by the Mamluks under al-Ashraf and its garrison massacred while the clergy and other population were made prisoners or enslaved. Al-Ashraf also had the castle rebuilt and renamed it to . On several occasions, contemporary sources referred to the castle as a strategic base of the Mamluks for raids or intelligence in the lands of the Ilkhanate. It was not of the same importance as Bahasni to the north and Ayntab to the west. The castle was damaged by Timur&#x27;s forces in 1400–1, but the structure was repaired again by the Mamluks.

In 1466, the Mamluk-controlled fortress fell to the Dulkadirid ruler Shah Suwar (). However, much of Shah Suwar&#x27;s new possessions were later regained by the Mamluks, and he was caught and executed in 1472. 

In 1516, the Ottoman Empire and the Mamluk Sultanate engaged in a war that would facilitate the downfall of the latter. Although the Ottoman forces camped 25 km west of Rumkale near the Merziman Stream, they did not lay siege to the town and began advancing towards Ayntab. The garrison of the town handed over control to the Ottomans, who marched in the direction of Dabiq.

===Ottoman period===
Rumkale, along with other Mamluk fortresses and towns west of the Euphrates, surrendered to the Ottoman forces following the defeat of the Mamluk Sultanate at Battle of Marj Dabiq the same year. In 1517, Rumkale became the center of its namesake sanjak with Omer Beg-oghlu Idris as its sanjak-bey as part of the new Damascus-based () of the Ottoman Empire. However, Rumkale was shortly demoted to the status of kaza of the Sanjak of Birejik sometime between 1518 and 1520. 

All residents of Rumkale recorded in the Ottoman defters during the 16th-century were Muslim. The site was later repopulated by some Armenians, who were allowed to use the old catholical church on occasions.
====Desertion====
Following the 1831 rebellion led by Bekirzade Mehmed Bey, the voivode (tax-collector, warlord) of Rumkale, the Ottoman government decreed the depopulation of the town and the destruction of the homes to prevent the fortress from harboring any future rebels.

The remaining few intact buildings were bombarded by Ibrahim Pasha in 1832 during the Egyptian–Ottoman War, which forced the residents to relocate to the village of Kasaba, while influential families moved to the town of Halfeti on the opposite (eastern) side of the Euphrates or the city of Aintab in the west.
==Architecture==
===Churches===
Thirteenth-century Syriac primate and writer Bar Hebraeus noted at least two Syriac Orthodox churches in Rumkale: a small church likely located in the town and built at the end of the 12th century and a larger one constructed in the lower neighborhood during Patriarch Ignatius III David&#x27;s tenure (1222–52). Rumkale included a church erected by Rabban Isho, an Assyrian monk and copyist, who died in 1247 and was buried there.

===Mosques===
In the 16th-century Ottoman records detailing the population of Rumkale, historian H. Basri Karadeniz identified two mosques in the town, the Grand Mosque () and the Castle Mosque (). In addition to both two mosques, historian Ali Yılmaz listed 3 mosques Horos, Mehmed Saruji, and Zeytun, as well as 4 masjids, Kubbeli, Han, Hajji Osman, and Diremli. According to Yasin Taş, these mosques were potentially located in the neighboring villages, and the town contained only the first two mosques based on the same records, which attested to the presence of a smaller clergy community in Rumkale. In parallel, 17th-century traveler Evliya Çelebi mentioned one mosque and another in the suburbs in his (travelogue). 

Ak Masjid was likely built in late 17th century as it was first attested to in January 1697 and continued to be mentioned in Ottoman records through 1844. Abu&#x27;l-Qays Mosque first appeared in January 1726 with the appointment of a trustee and stopped being mentioned by mid-19th century. Ikiyollu Masjid was the only Islamic place of worship whose location is known to be in a specific neighborhood, Qizilja, from the Ottoman records. It was later known as Ghnana Masjid from its potential founder Abdulghani dubbed as Ghnana Dede. However, the masjid&#x27;s construction year is unknown and it was first mentioned in February 1697. Oluk Mosque was recorded once in February 1697. Hizir Ilyas Mosque differs from the rest as it was not found in any archival records but is identified in a photo dated back to late 19th century.
===Schools===
The Rammahiya Madrasa was most likely located in the Rumlulu neighborhood. Historian Muhsin Soyudoğan points out that Zamahiya, the transliteration put forward by Yılmaz and Karadeniz in prior publications, is a result of the misreading of the , Arabic diacritic equivalent of double consonants, as a dot above the first letter, , () so that it was (). The name of the institution was inevitably tied to the Ramah Spring. According to Soyudoğan, the name may be alluding to Syrian chemist Hasan al-Rammah, who died 3 years after Mamluk acquisition of Rumkale. In addition to a madrasa, the complex also included a primary school and a masjid. As opposed to the riverside, the complex was located inside the fortress, possibly near a famous well, since the institution&#x27;s expenses listed in the Ottoman documents included ropes () and buckets () used for extracting water from wells.
==Access==
The fortress, now situated across a peninsula created by the reservoir of Birecik Dam and within the administrative boundaries of Gaziantep&#x27;s Nizip district, is currently accessible by boat either from the neighboring site of Zeugma or from the town of Halfeti. As of March 2017, it was not possible to land at the site; extensive (re)building is underway inside the fortress and on the external walls.

<text>Vintilă Horia (; December 18, 1915 – April 4, 1992) was a Romanian writer, winner of the Prix Goncourt. His best known novel is &quot;God Was Born in Exile&quot; (1960).

==Life and career==
Horia was born in Segarcea, a small town in Dolj County, Romania. After graduating from Saint Sava High School in Bucharest, he studied Law, and then Letters at the University of Bucharest, and in parallel at universities in Italy and Austria. An associate of the far right thinker Nichifor Crainic, Horia sat on the editorial board of his &quot;Sfarmă Piatră&quot; journal. He contributed to &quot;Gândirea&quot; and &quot;Porunca Vremii&quot; articles praising the Italian fascism of Benito Mussolini (&quot;Miracolul fascist&quot; — &quot;The Fascist Miracle&quot;), as well as pieces attacking authors whom the traditionalist group viewed as decadent (notably, Tudor Arghezi and Eugen Lovinescu).

After Crainic took over as Minister of Propaganda in King Carol II&#x27;s authoritarian government, he appointed Horia as member of the diplomatic mission to Rome. According to his own account, Horia shared Crainic&#x27;s rejection of the Iron Guard, and, after Carol was ousted by the latter&#x27;s National Legionary State government, he was recalled from office. He later left for Vienna.

With Romania&#x27;s siding with the Allies in August 1944 (&quot;see Romania during World War II&quot;), Horia was taken prisoner by the Nazi authorities, and interned in the concentration camps at Karpacz and Maria Pfarr. He was liberated a year later by the British Army.

Deciding not to return to an increasingly Soviet Union-dominated Romania, Vintilă Horia lived in Italy (where he became good friends with Giovanni Papini).

In 1946, following a trial &quot;in absentia&quot; during the Post-World War II Romanian war crime trials, Horia was sentenced to life in prison for facilitating the penetration of fascist ideas in Romania, and for making the case for those ideas to be implemented under the leadership of the German embassy in Bucharest. The sentence against him has never been rescinded. In 1948, Horia moved to Argentina, where he taught at the Universidad de Buenos Aires; after March 1953, he lived in Spain, employed as a researcher in the Italic Studies field.

He won the Prix Goncourt for his novel &quot;Dieu est né en exil&quot; (&quot;God was born in exile&quot;) in 1960; however, following the allegations that he had been a member of the Iron Guard, Horia refused to receive the Prize, but the Goncourt remains attributed to him. According to some, the allegations constituted slander aimed at Horia by the communist regime, with the purpose of blackmailing him into issuing positive remarks about the regime. His book notably attracted Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s criticism.

Other prizes received by Vintilă Horia include &quot;Medalla de Oro de Il Conciliatore&quot;, Milano (1961); &quot;Bravo para los hombres que unem en la verdad&quot;, Madrid (1972); and the Dante Alighieri Prize, Florence (1981).

He died in Collado Villalba, a municipality of Madrid, and was buried in the Madrid Civil Cemetery.

The centenary of Vintilă Horia was celebrated at the University of Alcalá (a Spanish university in Alcalá de Henares) and in several towns in Romania.

<text>Running rigging is the rigging of a sailing vessel that is used for raising, lowering, shaping and controlling the sails on a sailing vessel—as opposed to the standing rigging, which supports the mast and bowsprit. Running rigging varies between vessels that are rigged fore and aft and those that are square-rigged.

== History of materials ==

In centuries past, a ship&#x27;s rigging was typically fashioned from rope. In the 19th century this was commonly referred to as Manilla, a reference to the origin of much good quality rope. Traditionally the running rigging was easily recognized since, for flexibility, it was not coated with tar and therefore of a lighter color than the standing rigging which was tarred for protection from weather and therefore darker or even black in color. On modern vessels, running rigging is likely to be made from synthetic fibers, while the standing rigging is most often fashioned from stainless steel &quot;wire rope&quot;. Since the 1990s, several new synthetic fibers have become common, particularly on racing and other high-performance sailing boats. These fibers include Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) (also known as Spectra or Dynema), Vectran, and Technora.

==Fore-and-aft rigged vessels==
Fore-and-aft rigged vessels have rigging that supports, shapes, and adjusts the sails to optimize their performance in the wind.

===Supporting===
* Halyards (sometimes haulyards), are used to raise sails and control luff tension. In large yachts the halyard returns to the deck but in small racing dinghies the head of the sail is attached by a short line to the head of the mast while the boat is lying on its gunwale.
* Topping lifts, which hold booms and yards aloft.
* Brails run from the leech of a fore-and-aft rigged sail (a spanker or lateen mizzen, for example) to the gaff and mast and serve the same function as buntlines: to haul in the sail when furling. In this case, however, the action is more horizontal than vertical, hauling the sail forwards, toward the luff and a bit up, towards the gaff.

===Shaping===
*Barber haulers, which adjust the spinnaker/jib sheeting angle by pulling the sheet/sail inboard or outboard at right angles to the sheet. Consists of either a ring or clip on the sheet attached to cordage which is secured and adjusted via fairlead and cam cleat.
* Kicking straps / boom vangs, which control a boom-footed sail&#x27;s leech tension by exerting downward force mid-boom. Normally this is a system of highly geared blocks, of flexible stainless steel wire and low stretch cordage but recently some sail boats have a short spar instead, often of carbon fibre. When sailing downwind the kicking strap (kicker) is tensioned to stop the boom lifting.
* Cunninghams, which tighten the luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling downward on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. The idea is to flatten the main sail in heavier weather or when sailing to windward. In its simplest form a stainless steel hook that goes through the cringle. From the hook a cordage tail passes through a turnblock on the deck at the base of the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.
* Downhauls, which lower a sail or a yard, and can be used to adjust the tension on the luff of a sail.
* Outhauls, which control the foot tension of a boom-footed sail. This is one of the main controls for sail fullness. In a racing boat the boom outhaul runs from the sail clew through a turning block along the inside of the boom and out through another turning block at the fore end of the boom. For simplicity many small racing craft have the boom outhaul attached to a powerful hyfield lever mounted on the boom or deck. The lever is let off for down wind sailing, so the main sail becomes full. Alternatively the outhaul tail can be attached to a block and tackle system so that it can be adjusted to many positions.
* Jib Fairleads, which determine the sheeting angle, depth of the sail, height of the clew, leach tension and other sail trim variables.

===Adjusting angle to the wind===
* Guys, which control spar angle with respect to the apparent wind.
*Preventer, is cordage attached to the end of the boom and fixed to (or running through a block) on the rail athwart or forward of the mast. Its most common purpose is to prevent potentially dangerous movement of the spar in an accidental gybe.
* Sheets, which control foot tension of loose-footed sails, angle of attack with respect to the apparent wind and/or the amount of leech &quot;twist&quot; near the head of the sail. Central sheeting refers to main sheets that attach to the centre of the boom. Sheets are made from thin low stretch cordage in racing yachts.

===Stability===
* Trapeze wires, which are narrow gauge flexible stainless steel wire, running from about the cross trees on the mast to the harness worn by a crew member and sometimes skipper on a high speed racing skiff. The lower section often has a system of small blocks which are used by the crew to alter the length of the trapeze wire as the crew moves aft on a broad reach. When the boat changes tack the crew unclips the hook, the wire is automatically sprung into the gunwale by an elastic tail.

==Square-rigged vessels==
Square-rigged vessels require more controlling lines than fore-and-aft rigged ones.

===Supporting===
* Halyards (sometimes haulyards) are used to raise and lower the yards.
* Buntlines, spaced every few feet along the front of a sail, run from a point on the mast above the yard to the foot (bottom edge) of the sail and serve to raise the foot up for shortening sail or for furling.
* Lifts adjust the tilt of a yard, to raise or lower the ends off the horizontal.
* Leechlines run to the leech (outer vertical edges) of a sail and serve to pull the leech both in and up when furling.

===Shaping===
* Bowlines run from the leech (outer vertical edges) of a sail forward (towards the bow) and are used to control the weather leech, keeping it taut and thus preventing it from curling back on itself. To extend its spread it was often attached to a bridle and thence to three or four bowline cringles set upon the leech.
* Clewlines raise the clews (bottom corners) of a square sail to the yard above, either to the outer ends of a yard or, more commonly, to near the middle of the yard, near (but not quite at) the mast. As the clewlines were hauled in, the sheets would be slacked off. This process would be reversed when setting sail.

===Adjusting angle to the wind===
* Braces are used to adjust the fore and aft angle of a yard (i.e. to rotate the yard laterally, fore and aft, around the mast).
* Sheets attach to the clews (bottom corners) of a sail to control the sail&#x27;s angle to the wind. Sheets run aft (for comparison, see tacks).
* Tacks are used to haul the clew of a loose-footed square sail (for example, a course) forward when sailing close to the wind. Tacks run forward (for comparison, see sheets).

<doc id="661017" wikidata="Q4772277" url="?curid=661017" title="Same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Ireland since 16 November 2015. A referendum on 22 May 2015 amended the Constitution of Ireland to provide that marriage is recognised irrespective of the sex of the partners. The measure was signed into law by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, as the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland on 29 August 2015. The &quot;Marriage Act 2015&quot;, passed by the Oireachtas on 22 October 2015 and signed into law by the Presidential Commission on 29 October 2015, gave legislative effect to the amendment. Same-sex marriages in Ireland began being recognised from 16 November 2015, and the first marriage ceremonies of same-sex couples in Ireland occurred the following day. Ireland was the eleventh country in Europe and the eighteenth in the world to allow same-sex couples to marry nationwide.

Civil partnerships, granted under the &quot;Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010&quot;, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal, to those of civil marriage. The 2011 Irish census revealed 143,600 cohabiting couples, up from 77,000 in 2002. This included 4,042 in same-sex relationships, up from 1,300.

==Background==

===Law Reform Commission===
In December 2000, as part of the Second Programme of Law Reform, the government requested the Law Reform Commission of Ireland to examine the rights and duties of cohabitees. In April 2004, the commission published a consultation paper with provisional recommendations on legal issues related to cohabiting relationships. The report included an analysis of issues for same-sex couples. Following responses, the final report was launched in December 2006 by Justice Minister Michael McDowell.

The consultation proposals called for legal &#x27;presumed&#x27; recognition of &quot;qualifying&quot; cohabiting relationships. &quot;Qualifying cohabitees&quot; were defined as unmarried same-sex or opposite-sex cohabiting couples in a &#x27;marriage-like&#x27; relationships of 2 years (or 3 years in some cases), to be determined by the courts. The commission reviewed such areas as property, succession, maintenance, pensions, social welfare and tax, and recommended some changes in the law to provide rights for qualifying cohabitees. These rights would be applied by the court on application as distinct from the &#x27;automatic&#x27; rights of legal marriage. The commission took care not to propose anything which would equate cohabitation with marriage due to concerns that such a proposal might violate the constitutional protection of the family. The paper also included recommendations on other steps that cohabiting couples should take such writing wills, defining power of attorney, etc.

===Constitutional review===
The all-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, re-established in December 2002, was conducting a review of the entire Constitution of Ireland. In October 2004, it invited submissions on the articles related to the family. Chairman Denis O&#x27;Donovan stated that it was examining these articles &quot;to ascertain the extent to which they are serving the good of individuals and the community, with a view to deciding whether changes in them would bring about a greater balance between the two.&quot; Among the many issues raised by the committee were the definition of the family and the rights of same-sex couples to marry.

The relevant provisions were Articles 40.3, 41 and 42. Article 41 states:
The committee held oral hearings in spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly large volume of written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and the Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It suggested that there should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the &#x27;presumed&#x27; recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation was that it would be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.

===Colley Report===

On 20 December 2005, Minister for Justice Michael McDowell announced that he was creating a working group in the Department of Justice to provide options for government consideration. This announcement came on the day after Belfast in Northern Ireland held the first of the new UK civil partnership registration ceremonies. The government said that it would legislate following the report, but Taoiseach Bertie Ahern also said there might not be time to do so before the upcoming election.

Chaired by former TD Anne Colley, this working group included the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network (GLEN), the gay rights lobby organisation, which said they expected a recommendation for civil marriage. The group facilitated a conference on the topic in May 2006, as input to its reports which was attended by experts from other countries which have introduced civil unions and same-sex marriage. During his speech, McDowell was interrupted by members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians opposed to the government plans.

Initially to report by March 2006, the group presented its report to the government in November 2006. They recommended that a civil partnership scheme would resolve most of the issues for same-sex and cohabiting couples, while providing less benefits than marriage. Offering civil marriage to same-sex couples would be open to a constitutional challenge. They also recommended a legal presumption of partnership for couples who have lived together for three years, or have children together. No recommendations were made for couples in non-conjugal relationships due to lack of research. The cabinet reviewed the report, but no legislation was introduced before the 2007 general election, and in the intervening period the government rejected opposition legislation, saying that legislation should await the Supreme Court appeal in &quot;Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners&quot;.

===Other statutory bodies and NGOs===

Since 2002, various statutory bodies have issued reports calling for the recognition of &quot;de facto&quot; same-sex and opposite-sex relationships:

&quot;Equality Authority&quot;: In January 2001, the authority produced a report
on same-sex partnerships in Ireland. In May 2002, the Equality Authority issued its formal report on equality for lesbians, gays and bisexuals, which highlighted the lack of recognition for same-sex couples in Irish law. In a departure from the norm, the report recommended legislative changes. These were to give legal recognition to same-sex couples and to provide equality with married couples in the areas of adoption, inheritance and taxation to eliminate discrimination.

&quot;National Economic and Social Forum&quot;: In April 2003, the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) published a report calling for the implementation of equality policies for gay, lesbian and bisexual people, and for the Law Reform Commission to consider models to achieve equal rights for same-sex couples in its then upcoming report.

&quot;Irish Human Rights Commission&quot;: In a report on &quot;de facto&quot; couples presented to the Justice Minister in May 2006, the Irish Human Rights Commission (IHRC) evaluated international standards in dealing with unmarried couples, and assessed the changes needed in Irish law from a human rights perspective. The Commission called for legal recognition of all &quot;de facto&quot; relationships, but did not call for civil marriage to be made available to same-sex couples. The IHRC also released a report on the civil partnership scheme in January 2009.

&quot;Irish Council for Civil Liberties&quot;: Legal recognition of partnership rights and addressing inequalities in family law were a strategic objective of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL) for 2004–2009. In a December 2004 submission, they welcomed the Law Reform proposals, but said that registered unions were necessary. In a 2005 radio interview, the partnerships officer said that full civil marriage would not be likely to succeed in a referendum. However, their May 2006 report on the issue, &quot;Equality for All Families&quot; launched by ICCL founder Kader Asmal, called for legislated partnership registration and revisions to the constitutional provisions on civil marriage and the family, to give improved protection to children. This revision, which might require a referendum, should include a right to marry irrespective of sexual orientation.

==Civil partnerships==

===Summary===
Civil partnerships (, ), introduced by the &quot;Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010&quot;, gave same-sex couples rights and responsibilities similar, but not equal to, those of civil marriage. The ability to enter into a civil partnership ended on 16 November 2015. Constitutional protections granted to spouses, such as the spouse of a witness not being compelled to give evidence against their spouse in most cases, is one example of protections granted under civil partnerships. Spouses may further claim privilege in so far as necessary to protect the constitutional right to marital privacy. No such constitutional protections existed for civil partnerships. Further inequalities in relation to the family, immigration and other types of Irish law existed. The legislation also provided rights for participants in long-term cohabiting relationships (opposite-sex or same-sex) who had not entered into a civil partnership or marriage. The following entry focuses primarily on the same-sex civil partnership aspect of the act, as opposed to the cohabitation aspect.

The &quot;Civil Partnership Act&quot; came into effect on 1 January 2011. It had been expected that the first ceremonies would not take place until April 2011 due to a three-month waiting period required by law for all civil ceremonies. However, the legislation provided a mechanism for exemptions to be sought through the courts, and the first partnership, which was between two men, was registered on 7 February 2011. While this ceremony was carried out publicly in the Civil Registration Office in Dublin, the mainstream media were not present. It was not until 5 April 2011, the date originally anticipated as the date for the first ceremonies, that the media covered a civil partnership. This partnership ceremony, which was between Hugh Walsh and Barry Dignam, also took place in Dublin.

Registration of civil partnerships discontinued on the day same-sex marriage legislation came into effect in November 2015, though existing civil partners are permitted to retain their relationship status, as there is no automatic conversion from a civil partnership to marriage.

===Legal history===

====Position before civil partnerships====
In March 2004, there was controversy in Dáil Éireann surrounding a definition of &quot;spouse&quot; when it was claimed that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Mary Coughlan, was seeking to exclude non-married partners from social welfare legislation. The exclusion was a government response to a finding by the Equality Tribunal that a same-sex couple was discriminated against in travel privileges.

The &quot;Civil Registration Act 2004&quot; included a prohibition of same-sex marriage. The act explicitly declared that there was an &quot;impediment to a marriage&quot; if &quot;both parties are of the same sex&quot;. In December 2006, the High Court held in &quot;Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners&quot; that marriage as defined in the Irish Constitution was between &quot;a man and a woman&quot; and that there was no breach of rights in the refusal of the Revenue Commissioners to recognise foreign same-sex marriages.

====Norris bill====
In December 2004, Independent Senator David Norris, who had been central to the 1970s and 1980s Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform and had been successful in the European Court of Human Rights in &quot;Norris v. Ireland&quot;, tabled a private member&#x27;s bill on civil partnerships in Seanad Éireann. The bill provided for the recognition of unmarried partnerships, both same-sex and opposite-sex cohabiting couples. It defined eligibility for a civil partnership and the process of registering a civil partnership. Rather than listing all the rights of a civil partner, it specified that all the rights of marriage would apply to anyone in a civil partnership. However, it specifically defined the dissolution process and the process for recognising foreign civil partnerships. Norris said the bill was initiated &quot;to protect the rights of adults who find themselves in relationships outside the conventional bonds of marriage&quot; and &quot;to meet the requirements of those who are making arrangements in their personal lives outside the formalities of marriage&quot; and who also &quot;need to be supported in the creation of mature stable relationships&quot;. Norris said he had done substantial research in order to achieve consensus on a moderate bill which took on board stated reservations.

The debate, including contributions from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, took place on 16 February 2005. The majority of speakers supported the principles behind the bill and complimented Senator Norris on his work. Some expressed reservations due to the constitutional protection of the family. A government amendment designed to postpone a vote attracted much acrimony. This postponement was to allow for input from then ongoing investigations: the Law Reform Commission, the High Court case &quot;Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners&quot; on the recognition of a Canadian marriage and the Constitutional Review Committee. Eventually, it was agreed to debate the bill but adjourn a vote indefinitely.

====Labour Party bills====
In December 2006, on the same day as the High Court judgment in &quot;Zappone&quot;, Brendan Howlin, an opposition Labour Party TD, tabled a private member&#x27;s bill on civil partnerships in Dáil Éireann. Similar to the Norris bill in its provisions, this bill defined a civil union as providing all the rights and duties as defined for marriage, but specifically limited civil unions to same-sex couples. It also provided for adoption by couples in such unions.

The debate, again including contributions from Justice Minister Michael McDowell, took place in February 2007. All speakers supported civil unions for same-sex couples and complimented Deputy Howlin on the bill. One expressed reservations about adoption. Minister McDowell claimed that the bill violated the constitutional provisions on marriage and the family. Government speakers said that civil unions needed to be introduced but that more time was needed to take account of the ongoing Supreme Court case and investigation work in the Department of Justice. The government amended the bill to delay debate for six months. As expected, the bill then fell when the Dáil was dissolved in the intervening period for the 2007 general election. Deputy Howlin said that the real reason for the delay was that the government did not want to enact this type of social legislation in the face of an election.

Labour again brought their bill before the new house on 31 October 2007 but the government again voted the bill down. The Green Party, now in government also voted in opposition to the bill, with spokesperson Ciarán Cuffe arguing that the bill was unconstitutional but without giving a reasoning. The government committed itself to introducing its own bill for registered civil partnerships by 31 March 2008, a date it would fail to meet.

====Government legislation====

The Green Party entered government with Fianna Fáil in 2007, and a commitment to legislation introducing civil partnerships was agreed in the Programme for Government in June of that year. On 24 June 2008, the government announced the publication of a civil partnership bill. In response to the legislation, Senator Jim Walsh put forward a party motion to counter the bill. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; reported that around 30 unidentified backbenchers had signed the motion. One anonymous senator was quoted as claiming that the motion &quot;would have considerable support from the more conservative sections of the parliamentary party&quot;. Taoiseach Brian Cowen responded by insisting that the registration of same-sex couples would not interfere with the constitutional status of marriage. Cowen noted that the bill had been drawn up in close consultation with the Attorney General, Paul Gallagher, and had been included in the Programme for Government. The motion was referred to the parliamentary party&#x27;s justice committee on 1 July 2008. A Fianna Fáil spokesperson was quoted as saying that there was &quot;broad support&quot; within the party for the legislation, while the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, reaffirmed the constitutional compatibility of the law. The announcement was denounced as inadequate by the opposition Labour and Sinn Féin parties. Sinn Féin spokesperson Aengus Ó Snodaigh commented that &quot;the government must do better&quot;.

The civil partnership bill was introduced on 26 June 2009. Dermot Ahern, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, introduced the bill&#x27;s second stage on 3 December 2009. He said that consequent modifications to the finance and social welfare provisions would come into effect when the bill was passed. There was further second stage debate on the bill on 21 January 2010. The second stage finished on 27 January 2010, and the committee stage of the bill was completed on 27 May 2010. The bill was passed in the final stage by the Dáil without a vote on 1 July 2010. It was passed in the final stage in the Seanad by a vote of 48–4 on 8 July 2010 and was signed by President Mary McAleese on 19 July 2010. Minister Ahern said, &quot;This is one of the most important pieces of civil rights legislation to be enacted since independence. Its legislative advance has seen an unprecedented degree of unity and support within both Houses of the Oireachtas.&quot;

The Minister for Justice signed a commencement order on 23 December 2010. The act came into force on 1 January 2011. The date of commencement of the act was dependent on further legislation in the areas of taxation and social welfare, which was enacted separately. The &quot;Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2010&quot; was passed by the Dáil on 14 December and the Seanad on 17 December 2010. Tax codes were amended in July 2011 under the &quot;Finance (No. 3) Act 2011&quot; to take account of civil partnerships. The act, in the main, is retrospective to 1 January 2011 and it created virtual parity, in taxation matters, between civil partners on the one hand and married people on the other hand.

===Recognition of foreign partnerships===
Certain foreign partnerships and same-sex marriages had been recognised as civil partnerships since 13 January 2011. While Glenn Cunningham and Adriano Vilar are often cited as the first same-sex couple to have their civil partnership formally recognised in Ireland, in fact several hundred couples were recognised together at the exactly the same time. The couple had formed a civil partnership at a ceremony in Northern Ireland in 2010.

Section 5 of the &quot;Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010&quot; stated the criteria used to govern which classes of relationships could be recognised. They were:
*the relationship was exclusive in nature
*the relationship was permanent unless the parties dissolved it through the courts
*the relationship had been registered under the law of that jurisdiction
*the rights and obligations attendant on the relationship were, in the opinion of the Minister, sufficient to indicate that the relationship would be treated comparably to a civil partnership
The recognition was formally authorised by statutory instruments, four of which were passed: in 2010, listing 33 relationship types in 27 jurisdictions; 
in 2011, adding 6 relationships; 
in 2012, adding 4; 
and in 2013, adding 14. The French civil solidarity pact was not included, nor were some other legal relationships, for example, the Dutch registered partnership and some of the domestic partnerships in the United States. The reason is that these kinds of relationships can be dissolved by agreement between the parties (that is by both parties signing a document with a lawyer), not through the courts.

===Statistics===
2,071 civil partnerships were registered in Ireland between 2011 and 2015; 536 in 2011, 429 in 2012, 338 in 2013, 392 in 2014, and 376 in 2015. Most partnerships were between two men (1,298), and a majority were performed in Leinster, particularly in the Greater Dublin Area.

===End of civil partnerships===
Following Ireland&#x27;s legalisation of same-sex marriage in 2015, the ability to enter into a civil partnership was closed off. As of 16 November 2015, no further civil partnerships are granted in Ireland and existing civil partners only retain that status if they do not marry. Any civil partnership converted into a marriage is dissolved.

==Same-sex marriage==
===Legal case===

In November 2004, Katherine Zappone and Ann Louise Gilligan were granted leave by the High Court of Ireland to pursue a claim to have their September 2003 Vancouver marriage recognised for the filing of joint tax returns in Ireland.
The case was heard in October 2006. The judgment was delivered in December 2006 and found that the Irish Constitution had always meant for marriage to be between &quot;a man and a woman&quot;. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court in February 2007. It came before the Supreme Court in 2012, although returned to the High Court to challenge different elements of law, specifically the &quot;Civil Registration Act 2004&quot; and the &quot;Civil Partnership Act 2010&quot;.

===Preparation for the referendum===
The coalition government, which took office in March 2011, convened a Constitutional Convention to discuss proposed amendments to the Constitution of Ireland, including plans to introduce same-sex marriage. On 10 July 2012, the Dáil referred the issue of whether to make provision for same-sex marriage to the Constitutional Convention, to report back in a year. On 14 April 2013, the convention approved provisions allowing for same-sex marriage, to be discussed by the Oireachtas and be put to a public referendum. On 2 July 2013, the Constitutional Convention delivered the formal report to the Oireachtas, which had four months to respond. On 5 November 2013, it was announced that a referendum to legalise same-sex marriage would be held in the first half of 2015. On 1 July 2014, Taoiseach Enda Kenny announced that the same-sex marriage referendum would take place in spring 2015. The referendum was held on 22 May 2015.

With the signing into law of the &quot;Children and Family Relationships Act 2015&quot; on 6 April 2015, same-sex couples have the ability to adopt stepchildren, as well as being able to obtain parental recognition in assisted reproduction methods. On 18 January 2016, key provisions of the law (including spouses, stepparents, civil partners and cohabiting partners being able to apply to become guardians of a child or for custody) went into effect, following the signing of a commencement order by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Frances Fitzgerald. Portions of the act allowing for joint adoption, which never went into effect as no commencement order was signed, were repealed in 2017 after passage of the &quot;Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017&quot;, which legalised joint adoption by married same-sex couples.

===Marriage Equality referendum===

The amendment to the Constitution was moved on 21 January 2015. The referendum proposed to add the following text to Article 41 of the Constitution: &quot;Marriage may be contracted in accordance with law by two persons without distinction as to their sex.&quot;

In March 2015, the Department of Justice and Equality published the general scheme of a new marriage bill. The bill set out the changes to be made to legislation if the proposed amendment was approved. These changes included removing the legislative bar on same-sex couples marrying (though the wording of the amendment is self-executing and designed to invalidate it irrespective of legislative delay), addressing the situation of civil partnerships, and updating terminology of existing legislation to reflect the new provision.
The Marriage Equality referendum was held on 22 May 2015. With votes from all 43 constituencies counted, the 62.07% &quot;yes&quot; vote assured the passage of the referendum. In the aftermath of the result, Minister for Justice and Equality Frances Fitzgerald stated that legislation would be brought through the Oireachtas by summer (i.e. sometime in June or July 2015) to make same-sex marriage a reality. However, an unsuccessful legal challenge contesting the validity of the referendum delayed the legislation from going to government and the Oireachtas. The referendum results were published in &quot;Iris Oifigiúil &quot; on 26 May.

===Marriage Act 2015===

On 16 September 2015, following the High Court&#x27;s rejection of the legal challenge contesting the validity of the referendum result, Fitzgerald brought a same-sex marriage bill before cabinet. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice and Equality stated that &quot;the aim is to have the bill enacted as quickly as possible, subject to the legislative process, so that the first same-sex marriages can take place this year.&quot; Under the legislation, the first same-sex marriages would be those of couples who convert a notification of their intention to register a civil partnership into a notification of their intention to marry. The bill passed all stages of the legislative process in the Oireachtas on 22 October 2015. On 29 October 2015, the bill was signed into law by the Presidential Commission.

The &quot;Marriage Act 2015&quot; (, ) also provides for the recognition of same-sex marriages validly performed abroad: &quot;A marriage under the law of a place other than the State shall not be precluded from being recognised as a marriage by reason of the sex of the parties to the marriage.&quot;

===Commencement===
Though most same-sex couples seeking to marry are required to give three months notice (as is the case for opposite-sex couples), same-sex couples already in a civil partnership were allowed to make use of a 5-day fast track provision in the legislation. As of 16 November 2015, same-sex couples who married abroad have their marriages recognised in Ireland. The first marriage ceremonies of same-sex couples occurred the following day, on 17 November 2015. The first couple to marry in Ireland were Richard Dowling and Cormac Gollogly on Tuesday, 17 November in Clonmel, County Tipperary. The couple said they &quot;[were] really delighted to be able to do it and we are 12 years together so it was obviously the next move. Having a full marriage was important to us so now we can relax and get old together.&quot;

===Subsequent changes===
On 5 May 2016, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, James Reilly, announced that the Irish Government had approved the publication of a new adoption bill. The bill would amend the &quot;Adoption Act 2010&quot; and the &quot;Children and Family Relationships Act 2015&quot; and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill were to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they have cared for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the &quot;Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017&quot;. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October 2017 and the law went into effect the following day.

In January 2019, the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty, announced that the government had published a bill to amend the &quot;Civil Registration Act 2004&quot; to allow lesbian couples who have had donor-assisted children to be automatically registered as their parents. Under the changes, parents may choose the labels &quot;mother&quot;, &quot;father&quot; or &quot;parent&quot;, meaning that the non-biological mother would be able to legally register as a co-parent. Previously, only the biological mother could be named on the child&#x27;s birth certificate. The legislation passed the Daíl in March 2019, and the Seanad in May 2019, and was signed into law by President Higgins on 23 May 2019. It came into effect that same day.

===Statistics===
91 same-sex marriages were performed between 16 November and 31 December 2015; 47 between two men and 44 between two women. Data published by the Department of Social Protection a few days ahead of the first anniversary of the Marriage Equality referendum showed that 412 same-sex marriages had been performed in Ireland since November 2015, distributed by county as follows: Dublin (213), Cork (43), Limerick (25), Wicklow (17), Galway (14), Donegal, Kildare and Wexford (all three at 11), Kerry (9), Louth (8), Kilkenny (7), Offaly (6), Meath and Waterford (both at 5), Cavan, Sligo and Tipperary (all three at 4), Laois and Mayo (both at 3), Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath (all three at 2), Carlow, Leitrim and Monaghan (all three at 1), and Clare (0).

1,082 same-sex couples married in Ireland in the one year following the law&#x27;s entry into force, averaging 21 same-sex weddings a week. 450 of these marriages were performed in Dublin, 93 in Cork, 56 in Wicklow and 48 in Kildare. The counties with the fewest same-sex marriages were Longford with two, followed by three in Roscommon and five in Leitrim. 1,056 same-sex marriages took place in 2016, the first full year when same-sex couples could get married; 606 were male unions and 450 were female unions. 5,288 same-sex marriages had been performed in Ireland by the end of 2023:

Figures for 2020 are much lower than previous years because of the restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Religious performance===
Most religious denominations in Ireland do not support same-sex marriage and do not allow their clergy to bless or officiate at marriages of same-sex couples. The Quakers in Ireland are the only mainstream church in Ireland that performs same-sex marriages. In 2018, a motion supporting and allowing such marriages in their meeting houses was passed at an annual yearly meeting held in Limerick.

The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. In December 2023, the Holy See published &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot;, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. Primate of All Ireland and Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin said, &quot;At a practical level as a priest, I welcome the clarity in this document. The pope is very clear that these pastoral blessings are not a kind of a liturgical or ritual acknowledgment that these unions are equivalent or in any way analogous to the marriage between a man or a woman. At the same time, it shows that the issues and the hurts experienced by people identifying as LGBT+ have certainly been heard very loudly within the church. I do hope that people who may have felt excluded in the past, will see this as some step towards them with the love and mercy of Christ.&quot; Bishop of Waterford and Lismore Alphonsus Cullinan also welcomed the declaration, &quot;This document is a valuable gift since it focuses on the beauty of blessings flowing from the heart of God and is particularly welcome before Christmas when we celebrate the greatest blessing on our world – Christ Our Saviour – who is born among us. He is the One to whom we turn for spiritual health and goodness and the fulness of life.&quot; Archbishop of Dublin Dermot Farrell issued a statement on 8 January 2024 that &quot;couples in so-called irregular unions, including same sex couples, cannot be refused a blessing by a Catholic priest&quot;.

The Presbyterian Church in Ireland subscribes to the Westminster Confession of Faith which affirms that marriage &quot;is to be between one man and one woman: neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband, at the same time&quot;. The Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland also subscribes to the Westminster Confession of Faith and its definition of marriage. The Methodist Church in Ireland states that marriage is &quot;a relationship, intended as permanent, between one man and one woman&quot; in its &quot;Practical Expressions of Methodist Belief&quot; document. The church opposes &quot;all debased forms of sexuality and sexual practice, whether heterosexual or homosexual&quot; but asks for &quot;understanding and tolerance for those whose sexual orientation is towards those of their own gender&quot; and encourages the wider church &quot;to give a greater lead in the education of society, including Christians, regarding this issue, so that ignorance, prejudice and fear may disappear&quot;. The Association of Baptist Churches in Ireland affirms &quot;the creation ordinance of marriage as the lifelong union of one man and one woman&quot; in its Doctrinal Statement.

The Church of Ireland affirms in its canon law that &quot;according to our Lord&#x27;s teaching that marriage is in its purpose a union permanent and life-long, for better or worse, till death do them part, of one man with one woman, to the exclusion of all others on either side&quot;. In 2012, the General Synod of the Church of Ireland reaffirmed this teaching in a motion on &quot;Human Sexuality in the Context of Christian Belief&quot;. The motion added that the church &quot;recognises for itself and of itself, no other understanding of marriage&quot; and acknowledged that members of the church &quot;have at times hurt and wounded people by words and actions, in relation to human sexuality&quot;. The church affirmed a &quot;continuing commitment to love our neighbour, and opposition to all unbiblical and uncharitable actions and attitudes in respect of human sexuality from whatever perspective, including bigotry, hurtful words or actions, and demeaning or damaging language&quot;. In October 2023, the synod of the Diocese of Dublin and Glendalough passed a motion calling on the Church of Ireland to permit same-sex blessings. The dioceses of Tuam, Limerick and Killaloe and Cashel and Ossory approved similar resolutions a few weeks later.

==Public debate==

===Campaigns===
Following the decriminalisation of buggery in 1993, LGBT rights was not a high-profile issue in Ireland. From 2001 however, Irish media increasingly covered international developments on the recognition of same-sex partnerships. This has included coverage of reports on the issue, legal cases taken by Irish same-sex couples, surrogate parenthood, adoption, extra-legal same-sex unions, blessings and the foreign partnerships of Irish politicians. There was extensive coverage of the 2005 introduction of civil partnerships by the British Government, which applies to Northern Ireland.

Irish legislators began to comment publicly from 2003, some tentatively suggesting legislation, and some referring to Catholic teachings. Among the general public, reaction was favourable, with a 2005 online poll showing most respondents seeing some recognition as inevitable and acceptable. More rigorous public polls taken during 2006 showed an increasing majority of the population, up to 80%, supporting the introduction of some partnership rights for same-sex couples, with a slim majority favouring marriage. The numbers in favour of adoption by same-sex couples were lower but less clear.

Some public and religious figures, including bishops in the Catholic Church, and in the Church of Ireland also proposed legal recognition in 2004, but in a form different from marriage. Existing and new gay organisations such as the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, &quot;GLUE&quot; magazine and LGBT Noise began specifically campaigning for recognition in 2006.

At the 2002 general election, only the manifestos of the Green Party and the Labour Party explicitly referred to the rights of same-sex couples, but from 2004 all political parties, including the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrat government, produced policies or made statements in favour of varying forms of recognition. In 2004, Fine Gael was the first party to launch an explicit policy document supporting civil partnerships. In the run-up to the 2007 general election, the manifestos of all parties supported civil unions for same-sex couples, with Sinn Féin and the Green Party supporting civil marriage. All parties ran advertisements in the &quot;Gay Community News&quot; with commitments to same-sex couples. In 2012, Sinn Féin sought to provide opportunities to bring same-sex marriage to the fore by introducing motions of support at the city and county council level. By November 2013, all parties in the Dáil supported same-sex marriage: the Labour Party, the Green Party, the Socialist Party, Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, and Fine Gael.

===Polling===
A survey carried out in 2008 showed that 84% of Irish people supported civil marriage or civil partnerships for same-sex couples, with 58% (up from 51%) supporting full marriage rights in registry offices. The number who believed same-sex couples should only be allowed to have civil partnerships fell in the same period, from 33% to 26%. A public survey in October 2008 revealed that 62% of adults would vote &quot;yes&quot; in a referendum to extend civil marriage to same-sex couples. A breakdown of the results showed that support was strongest among younger people and in urban areas. Women were more supportive at 68% compared to 56% of men. There was slightly less support for same-sex couples being given the right to adopt. A total of 58% of those under 50 believed same-sex couples should be able to adopt, falling to 33% among the over-50s. A total of 54% believed the definition of the family unit in the Irish Constitution should be changed to include same-sex families.

A survey commissioned by MarriagEquality in February 2009 indicated that 62% of Irish people supported same-sex marriage and would vote in favour of it if a referendum were held. In September 2010, a survey by &quot;The Irish Times&quot;/Behaviour Attitudes of 1,006 people showed that 67% of respondents felt same-sex couples should be allowed to marry. This majority extended across all age groups, with the exception of the over-65s, and 66% of Catholics were in favour of same-sex marriage. Only 25% disagreed that same-sex couples should be allowed to marry, opposition that was concentrated among older people and those in rural areas. In terms of same-sex adoption, 46% were in support and 38% opposed; however, a majority of women, 18–44-year-olds, and urban dwellers supported the idea. The survey also showed that 91% of people would not think less of someone who came out as homosexual, while 60% felt the recent civil partnership legislation was not an attack on marriage.

A poll in March 2011 conducted by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;/RED C showed that 73% of people supported allowing same-sex marriage, with 53% &quot;agreeing strongly&quot; with the idea, and 60% felt that same-sex couples should be allowed to adopt children. A poll in January 2012 conducted by RED C for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform showed that 73% of voters supported the idea of same-sex marriages being recognised in the Irish Constitution, and a late 2012 poll by Millward Brown Lansdowne showed that 75% of respondents would vote in favour of extending marriage to same-sex couples.

A poll in November 2013 by RED C for Paddy Power showed that 76% of voters intended to support the introduction of same-sex marriage in any referendum, with 18% opposed and 6% undecided (with the undecideds excluded, the ratio was 81% support and 19% against). Support was highest among women (85%), those under 44 (87%), Labour supporters (96%) and those living in Dublin and commuter counties (83%). A February 2014 poll by RED C for RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Prime Time&quot; and the &quot;Business Post&quot; showed that 76% of voters would vote &quot;yes&quot; to the introduction of same-sex marriage in any referendum. A poll conducted two months later by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and Ipsos MRBI found that 67% of respondents would vote in favour of same-sex marriage and 21% against, with 12% undecided. When the undecided were excluded, 76% were in favour and 24% against.

The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 80% of Irish people thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, whilst 15% were against. A Pew Research Center poll, conducted between April and August 2017 and published in May 2018, showed that 66% of Irish people supported same-sex marriage, 27% were opposed and 7% did not know or had refused to answer. When divided by religion, 87% of religiously unaffiliated people, 80% of non-practicing Christians and 43% of church-attending Christians supported same-sex marriage. Opposition was 20% among 18–34-year-olds. The 2019 Eurobarometer found that 79% of Irish people thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 13% were opposed. The 2023 Eurobarometer showed that support had increased to 86%, while 9% were opposed. The survey also found that 83% of Irish people thought that &quot;there is nothing wrong in a sexual relationship between two persons of the same sex&quot;, while 12% disagreed.

Support is strongest among younger voters. Sinn Féin and Labour voters are somewhat more in favour than Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil voters. Among those intending to vote &quot;yes&quot; in January 2015, 33/77 had &quot;some reservations about same-sex marriage&quot;, and 29/77 had &quot;some reservations about adoption by gay couples&quot;. A poll conducted a week before the referendum by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; showed that women supported same-sex marriage more than men.

<doc id="661025" wikidata="Q1071585" url="?curid=661025" title="Salvia hispanica">
<text>Salvia hispanica, one of several related species commonly known as chia (), is a species of flowering plant in the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is native to central and southern Mexico and Guatemala. It is considered a pseudocereal, cultivated for its edible, hydrophilic chia seed, grown and commonly used as food in several countries of western South America, western Mexico, and the southwestern United States.

==Description==
Chia is an annual herb growing up to tall, with opposite leaves that are long and wide. Its flowers are purple or white and are produced in numerous clusters in a spike at the end of each stem.

Typically, the seeds are small ovals with a diameter around . They are mottle-colored, with brown, gray, black, and white. The seeds are hydrophilic, absorbing up to 12 times their weight in liquid when soaked. While soaking, the seeds develop a mucilaginous coating that gives chia-based beverages a distinctive gelatinous texture.

Many plants cultivated as &quot;S.hispanica&quot; are in fact &quot;S. officinalis&quot; subsp. &quot;lavandulifolia&quot; (syn. &quot;S. lavandulifolia&quot;).

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;chia&quot; is derived from the Nahuatl word , meaning &#x27;oily&#x27;.

Other plants known as &quot;chia&quot; include &quot;Salvia columbariae&quot;, which is sometimes called &quot;golden chia&quot;, &quot;Salvia polystachia&quot;, and &quot;Salvia tiliifolia&quot;.

== Distribution and habitat ==
Chia is native to central and southern Mexico and Guatemala. It is hardy from USDA Zones 9–12.

== Cultivation ==
Chia is grown and consumed commercially in its native Mexico and Guatemala, as well as Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua, northwestern Argentina, parts of Australia, and the southwestern United States. New patented varieties of chia have been bred in Kentucky for cultivation in northern latitudes of the United States.

It is grown commercially for its seed, a food rich in omega-3 fatty acids since the seeds yield 25–30% extractable oil, including α-linolenic acid. Typical composition of the fat of the oil is 55% ω-3, 18% ω-6, 6% ω-9, and 10% saturated fat.

===Climate and growing cycle length===
The length of the growing cycle for chia varies based on location and is influenced by elevation. For production sites located in different ecosystems in Bolivia, Ecuador and northwestern Argentina, growing cycles are between 100 and 150 days in duration. Accordingly, commercial production fields are located in the range of altitude across a variety of ecosystems ranging from tropical coastal desert, to tropical rain forest, and inter-Andean dry valley. In northwestern Argentina, a time span from planting to harvest of 120–180 days is reported for fields located at elevations of .

&quot;S. hispanica&quot; is a short-day flowering plant, indicating its photoperiodic sensitivity and lack of photoperiodic variability in traditional cultivars, which has limited commercial use of chia seeds to tropical and subtropical latitudes until 2012. Now, traditional domesticated lines of &quot;Salvia&quot; species grow naturally or can be cultivated in temperate zones at higher latitudes in the United States. In Arizona and Kentucky, seed maturation of traditional chia cultivars is stopped by frost before or after flower set, preventing seed harvesting. Advances in plant breeding during 2012, however, led to development of new early-flowering chia genotypes proving to have higher yields in Kentucky.

===Seed yield and composition===
Seed yield varies depending on cultivars, mode of cultivation, and growing conditions by geographic region. For example, commercial fields in Argentina and Colombia vary in yield range from . A small-scale study with three cultivars grown in the inter-Andean valleys of Ecuador produced yields up to , indicating that the favorable growing environment and cultivar interacted to produce the high yields. Genotype has a larger effect on yield than on protein content, oil content, fatty acid composition, or phenolic compounds, whereas high temperature reduces oil content and degree of unsaturation, and raises protein content.

=== Soil, seedbed requirements, and sowing===
The cultivation of &quot;S. hispanica&quot; requires light to medium clay or sandy soils. The plant prefers well-drained, moderately fertile soils, but can cope with acid soils and moderate drought. Sown chia seeds need moisture for seedling establishment, while the maturing chia plant does not tolerate wet soils during growth.

Traditional cultivation techniques of &quot;S. hispanica&quot; include soil preparation by disruption and loosening followed by seed broadcasting. In modern commercial production, a typical sowing rate of and row spacing of are usually applied.

=== Fertilization and irrigation===
&quot;S. hispanica&quot; can be cultivated under low fertilizer input, using nitrogen or in some cases, no fertilizer is used.

Irrigation frequency in chia production fields may vary from none to eight irrigations per growing season, depending on climatic conditions and rainfall.

===Genetic diversity and breeding===
The wide range of wild and cultivated varieties of &quot;S. hispanica&quot; are based on seed size, shattering of seeds, and seed color. Seed weight and color have high heritability, with a single recessive gene responsible for white color.

===Diseases and crop management===
Currently, no major pests or diseases affect chia production. Essential oils in chia leaves have repellent properties against insects, making it suitable for organic cultivation. Virus infections, however, possibly transmitted by white flies, may occur. Weeds may present a problem in the early development of the chia crop until its canopy closes, but because chia is sensitive to most commonly used herbicides, mechanical weed control is preferred.

==Other uses==
During the 1980s in the United States, the first substantial wave of chia seed sales was tied to Chia Pets. These &quot;pets&quot; come in the form of clay figures that serve as a base for a sticky paste of chia seeds; the figures then are watered and the seeds sprout into a form suggesting a fur covering for the figure. About 500,000 Chia Pets a year are sold in the US as novelties or house plants.

*31 December 2002 – 2002 ends with Arsenal top of the Premier League, four points ahead of second-placed Chelsea and with a game in hand. Manchester United occupy third place, Everton are fourth and Liverpool&#x27;s ongoing decline has seen them slip to fifth place just two months after they had a comfortable lead at the top. Southampton&#x27;s recent resurgence is putting pressure on the top five as they occupy seventh place and look on course for their highest finish since 1995. West Ham United remain bottom and are still looking for their first home win of the season, while West Bromwich Albion and Sunderland complete the bottom three. Portsmouth and Leicester City&#x27;s two-horse race at the top of Division One continues, with the playoff zone unchanged from last month.

*31 January 2003 – January draws to a close with Arsenal still top of the Premier League, two points above second placed Manchester United and within a game in hand. Newcastle United, Chelsea and Everton complete the top five. Liverpool&#x27;s decline continues as they occupy eighth place, deepening fears that a side looking all set for title glory three months ago might now not even qualify for the UEFA Cup. Meanwhile, West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s dismal form continues as they and West Ham United prop up the rest of the top flight on goal difference. Sunderland occupy the last relegation place. Middlesbrough boost their bid for a UEFA Cup place by spending a total of £8.5million on new signings Chris Riggott, Malcolm Christie and Michael Ricketts. The true extent of Leeds United&#x27;s financial difficulties becomes public knowledge during a press conference to announce the sale of Jonathan Woodgate to Newcastle United for £9million, during which Terry Venables states that he had been assured players wouldn&#x27;t need to be sold. Portsmouth and Leicester City remain in pole position at the top of Division One, and apart from Coventry City edging Reading out of the playoff zone the top six of the division is unchanged from last month.
*9 February 2003 – Manchester United drop two priceless points in the Premier League title race as they can only manage a 1–1 draw with City in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford. It is the first time since the 1991–92 season that they have failed to beat City in either derby games.

*16 February 2003 – One of the most decisive games of the season sees Arsenal cancel out Manchester United in the double race with a 2–0 win at Old Trafford. After the game, David Beckham suffers a gash to his face which is reportedly the result of Sir Alex Ferguson throwing a basket full of boots across the changing room after his side&#x27;s defeat.
*22 February 2003 – Manchester United drop points once again when relegation threatened Bolton hold them to a 1–1 draw at the Reebok Stadium.
*28 February 2003 – The month-end leaders for February are Arsenal, who now lead Manchester United by five points. Newcastle United, Chelsea and Everton complete the top five. There will now be a place in the UEFA Cup for the Premier League&#x27;s sixth place team if Manchester United or Liverpool (who contest this weekend&#x27;s League Cup final) finish in the top five. Currently in sixth place are Charlton Athletic, while Liverpool are still only seventh in a division which they had looked set to win a few months ago. Portsmouth have a two-point lead over Leicester City at the top of Division One. Reading, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United remain in the playoff zone, but an improving Wolverhampton Wanderers side have edged Norwich City out of the top six. Rotherham United are in contention for promotion after an impressive season so far.
*2 March 2003 – Liverpool win the League Cup for the seventh time in their history thanks to a 2–0 win over Manchester United in the final at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

*21 March 2003 – Leeds United, 16th in the FA Premier League and £120million in debt, sack Terry Venables after eight months in charge. Peter Reid is named as his successor on a temporary contract until the end of the season, but it is far from clear whether Reid will get the job on a permanent basis.
*22 March 2003
**Derby County (in Division One) suspend manager John Gregory over allegations of misconduct and replace him with George Burley as interim manager.

*23 March 2003 – Arsenal return to the top of the Premier League with a narrow 2–1 win over Everton.
*31 March 2003 – March draws to a close with Manchester United now leading the Premier League just a month after Arsenal looked to have won it, though Arsène Wenger&#x27;s team are only a point behind with a game in hand. Three points now separate Portsmouth and Leicester City at the top of Division One. Sheffield United, Reading, Nottingham Forest and Wolverhampton Wanderers remain in the playoff zone. Ipswich Town&#x27;s resurgence has seen them creep to the fringe of the top six, but Rotherham United&#x27;s playoff hopes are evaporating.
*5 April 2003 – Manchester United seize the initiative in the title challenge by beating Liverpool 4–0 at Old Trafford as Arsenal can only manage a 1–1 draw at Aston Villa. Leeds United move closer to survival with a 6–1 away win over a Charlton side which effectively ends their opposition&#x27;s hopes of European qualification.
*12 April 2003 – Paul Scholes scores a hat-trick as Manchester United beat Newcastle United 6–2 on Tyneside to extend their lead at the top of the Premier League. Newcastle&#x27;s neighbours Sunderland&#x27;s relegation is confirmed by a 2–0 defeat at Birmingham City.
*16 April 2003 – The much-anticipated &quot;title decider&quot; between Arsenal and Manchester United at Highbury ends in a 2–2 draw, meaning that Arsenal are now three points behind Manchester United but with a game in hand and a remotely superior goal difference.
*19 April 2003 – Paul Scholes is on the scoresheet twice as a 3–1 home win over Blackburn Rovers edges Manchester United closer to their eighth Premier League title in 11 seasons, despite Arsenal&#x27;s 2–0 win at Middlesbrough.

*21 April 2003 – West Ham manager Glenn Roeder is hospitalised with a suspected stroke; director of football Trevor Brooking is placed in charge of the first team until Roeder is well enough to resume control.
*26 April 2003 – Arsenal suffer a huge blow to their double hopes, as they surrender a 2–0 lead in their game-in-hand to draw 2–2 with Bolton at the Reebok Stadium – well and truly shifting the title race in Manchester United&#x27;s favour with three games to go.
*27 April 2003 – Portsmouth beat Rotherham 3–2 to win the Division One championship and gain promotion to the Premier League for the first time since the league&#x27;s inception.

*29 April 2003 – Glenn Roeder&#x27;s illness is diagnosed as a brain tumour which will be operated upon shortly.
*30 April 2003 – Sunderland, without a point since January and win since December, end the month, and West Bromwich Albion, with only six wins in their first top division campaign for nearly 20 years, end April with their relegation battle lost. West Ham United complete the bottom three but their survival bid is still very much alive as they are posing a threat to Bolton Wanderers, Birmingham City, Fulham, Aston Villa and a Leeds United team who began the season among the teams expected to challenge for the title but are now battling relegation as well as huge debts.
*3 May 2003 – A Ruud van Nistelrooy hat-trick contributes to Manchester United&#x27;s 4–1 home win over Charlton Athletic and puts them on the brink of title glory.
*4 May 2003 – Arsenal lose 3–2 at home to Leeds United, a result which ensures Leeds United&#x27;s safety and ends Arsenal&#x27;s defence of the title.

Shrewsbury Town are relegated to the Conference, ending 53 years of Football League membership. Exeter City finished 23rd in Division Three and are also relegated to the Conference – the first club to suffer automatic relegation without finishing bottom of the league. Peter Schmeichel calls time on his footballing career six months before his 40th birthday after helping Manchester City to finish ninth in the Premiership.
*9 May 2003 – Derby County confirm that suspended manager John Gregory will not be returning, and his contract is terminated to make way for George Burley to receive the job on a permanent basis.
*11 May 2003 – West Ham United are relegated after 10 years in the Premier League after failing to get the better of a Birmingham side who hold them to a 2–2 draw. Bolton are safe after a 2–1 home win over Middlesbrough. Sunderland&#x27;s 4–0 home defeat to Arsenal sees them end the season as officially the worst Premier League team ever with a record low of four wins, 19 points and 21 goals. Not since Stoke City in the old First Division 18 years ago has any top flight club attained such a poor record in the top flight. Ninth placed Manchester City bid farewell to Maine Road after 80 years, their last game before relocation to the City of Manchester Stadium being watched by a 35,000 capacity crowd as they lost 1–0 to eighth placed Southampton. The final goal at the stadium is scored by Saints defender Michael Svensson.

===FA Premier League===

Manchester United, unbeaten in the league after 26 December, overhauled Arsenal during the final three months of the season to clinch their eighth Premiership title in 11 seasons, while the other two Champions League places went to Newcastle United and Chelsea. Going into the UEFA Cup were Liverpool (who made an excellent start to the league, going unbeaten in their first three months before a sudden collapse and falling to 7th but with a late good form to finish 5th) and Blackburn Rovers who were bouncing in mid table at February, although they missed out on Champions League qualification thanks to staying in mid table for a long time, finished 6th, along with FA Cup runners-up Southampton (who also achieved their best Premiership finish of 8th place) and Fair Play award winners Manchester City (who finished an impressive ninth on their Premiership comeback). Southampton had not played in European competitions for nearly 20 years, while Manchester City&#x27;s last European campaign was a quarter of a century ago.

Everton finished seventh in their first full season under the management of David Moyes, the club&#x27;s highest finish for seven years, in a campaign where the club was the centre of national media and public attention following the performances of 17-year-old striker Wayne Rooney, who became the youngest full England international after the season&#x27;s end.

Compensation for Arsenal after their spectacular failure to retain the league title came in the form of retaining the FA Cup – the first side to do so for 21 years.

Leeds United&#x27;s season was plagued by a loss of form and mounting debts, and having to sell several key players, as they slipped to 15th place – their lowest finish for 10 years and a stark contrast to the previous five campaigns, where they had never finished outside the top five. Manager Terry Venables was axed towards the end of March after eight months in charge, with Peter Reid taking over for the final weeks of the season to secure survival and earn himself a permanent contract. Aston Villa&#x27;s 16th-place finish was their lowest for eight years, although their strong home form ensured their survival in the Premier League. However, they sat above Blackburn Rovers in February but only poor form at the end prevented them from qualifying for the UEFA Cup.

Sunderland&#x27;s season started badly and got worse as they finished with a record Premiership low of 4 wins, 19 points and 21 goals, losing their final 15 league games in the process. The Wearside club went through three managers, with Peter Reid (one of the league&#x27;s longest-serving managers) leaving in early October to be replaced by Howard Wilkinson, who lasted just five months before Mick McCarthy was appointed. They were joined by West Bromwich Albion, who attained just 26 points in their first top flight season for nearly 20 years and won just three times in the league after September. Last to go down were West Ham United, who went down with 42 points – the highest points tally of any club to be relegated from the Premiership under the 20-club format.

Leading goalscorer: Ruud van Nistelrooy (Manchester United), 25

===Football League First Division===

Portsmouth won the Division One title by some distance, passing manager Harry Redknapp&#x27;s old club, West Ham, on the way down and ending their own 15-year exile from the top flight. They were rarely outside the top two at any point of the season.

Leicester City earned a somewhat controversial promotion, as administration and a Creditor&#x27;s Voluntary Agreement wrote off much of their £30million debt. Partly as a result of this, the League would introduce a 10-point subtraction for any teams entering administration from the next season onwards. The play-offs were won by Wolves, returning to the top flight after nearly 20 years and finally allowing owner Sir Jack Hayward to see the return he wanted on his years of investment. Their opponents, Sheffield United, were semi-finalists in both domestic cups.

Gillingham enjoyed their most successful season to date, finishing a club record eleventh place in the division, the highest in their history. Despite having some of the lowest attendances in senior football after the relocation to Milton Keynes was announced, Wimbledon managed a 10th-place finish in the league, but then went into administration – putting the future of the club under yet more doubt.

Grimsby were relegated, after struggling in the division for five years on extremely limited resources. Both Brighton and Sheffield Wednesday suffered awful starts to the season (Brighton managing only a single win from their first sixteen matches), and despite good runs of form late in the season, neither were able to survive, although Brighton at least had the satisfaction of staying in the hunt for survival up to the last game.

Leading goalscorer: Svetoslav Todorov (Portsmouth), 26

===Football League Second Division===

Wigan won their first-ever promotion beyond the Second Division. Crewe managed a promotion on the back of their famed youth policy while play-off winners Cardiff were another big-spending team that were able to earn promotion, beating QPR in the final.

Tranmere Rovers had to settle for seventh place – not even enough for a playoff place – despite collecting 80 points, a tally which at times had been enough for some teams to win automatic promotion. Plymouth Argyle and Luton Town both achieved top half finishes a season after promotion.

An ill-advised managerial change mid-season helped send Northampton down. Mansfield Town&#x27;s first season out of the bottom division in over a decade ended as their previous spell had; with immediate relegation in a season awash with over 160 goals where they had no problems scoring goals but unfortunately leaked goals at an alarming rate. Huddersfield started badly, and a financial crisis later in the season helped condemn them to relegation, only three years after they looked Premiership-bound. Cheltenham came close to survival, but a defeat on the final day of the season saw them return to Division Three.

Leading goalscorer: Robert Earnshaw (Cardiff City), 31

===Football League Third Division===

Rushden &amp; Diamonds continued their meteoric rise, winning the divisional title. They were helped in no small part by runners-up Hartlepool suffering a shocking late-season collapse, which cost them the title and manager Mike Newell his job. Wrexham took the last automatic promotion spot and bounced back from the previous season&#x27;s relegation, as did play-off winners AFC Bournemouth, who beat Lincoln City in the final.

Oxford United were promotion contenders a season after finishing fourth from bottom, but in the end just missed out on the playoffs. Despite almost going out of business, York City managed to finish 10th – their highest finish since relegation to Division Three in 1999. Hull City finished 13th under new manager Peter Taylor, who took over from Jan Molby just before the club completed its relocation from Boothferry Park to the new KC Stadium, which gave the club the highest crowds at this level, although the upturn in form was not enough to get them anywhere near the top of the table. Boston United managed a 15th-place finish in their first season as a league club, despite having four points deducted for financial irregularities.

A shock FA Cup victory over Everton did little to help Shrewsbury, and they finished bottom of the League. Exeter City were bought out pre-season in a high-profile takeover spearheaded by Uri Geller; unfortunately, Geller&#x27;s associates proceeded to asset-strip the club, and despite a late-season run of form, Exeter fell victim to the first-ever dual relegation from the League.

Yeovil Town, who had spent decades making the headlines by defeating league opposition in the FA Cup, finally reached the Football League as Conference champions. The first Conference playoffs were won by Doncaster Rovers, who returned to the league after a five-year exile with the financial backing of John Ryan, who now had a new all-seater stadium in the pipeline.

Chelsea did not inform Charlton of the poor state of the pitch prior to the game, which Chelsea won 4–1.

<text>Kylie Travis (born 27 April 1970) is an English-born Australian former actress known for her leading role in the soap opera &quot;Central Park West&quot;.

==Early life==
Travis was born in London, England, the oldest of four sisters. After her birth, her family moved to Australia. She modelled for various agencies in Paris, London, and New York City before taking up acting.

==Career==
Travis&#x27; first major role was in the Aaron Spelling soap opera &quot;Models Inc.&quot; where she played the part of Julie, a vindictive yet loyal model. After the show was cancelled, she was approached by Darren Star, creator of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, from which &quot;Models Inc&quot; was a spin-off, to star in his new prime time drama &quot;Central Park West&quot;, in which she played scheming fashion editor, Rachel Dennis.

She then went on to play parts in several motion pictures, including &quot;Retroactive&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; as Rachel Malcolm, and &quot;Gia&quot;.

==Personal life==
Travis is married to Louis R. Cappelli, a property developer active in Westchester County, New York.

<doc id="661036" wikidata="Q1045128" url="?curid=661036" title="List of banned video games by country">
<text>This is a list of [[video game]]s that have been [[censorship|censored]] or [[ban (law)|banned]] by governments of various states in the world. Governments that have banned video games have been criticized for a correlated increase in digital piracy, limiting business opportunities and violating rights.

==Afghanistan==
During the first reign of the Islamic Emirate government in Afghanistan (1996–2001), Western technology and art was prohibited and this included video games. Between 2001 and 2021, no video games were officially banned in Afghanistan, except for &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot;. In April 2022 Taliban spokesperson Inamullah Samangani confirmed that &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot; is still banned under the Taliban administration to &#x27;protect younger generations from a bad influence&#x27;.

==Albania==
In 2019, a ban on online gambling went to effect in Albania. When &quot;Dead Rising 2&quot; released in Albania, retailer Albagame refused to sell copies of it over alleged gambling. Prime Minister Edi Rama threatened to ban the game in response to the anti-gambling law.

==Argentina==

&quot;Carmageddon&quot; is banned in the capital city of Buenos Aires because it depicts people being killed by motor vehicles.

&quot;RapeLay&quot; is banned because it promotes and supports the use of violence to compel a person to submit to sexual conduct, as well as the exploitation of young people for sexual purposes.

==Australia==

By Australian law, all media is rated by the Australian Classification Board (ACB), with works potentially receiving MA15+ (Mature Accompanied 15+), R18+ (Restricted 18+), X18+ (Restricted 18+), or even denied at rating (RC, Refused Classification). The ratings are enforced by law, banning retail sales of R18+ and X18+ works to adult consumers and preventing the sale or import of RC works. Penalties may vary up to 3 years in prison, or 200,000$ in fines.

Until 2011, video games in Australia could only be rated up to MA15+. At the time, the R18+ classification rating could be given to films, but a video game with content deemed fitting for the R18+ rating would be classed as &#x27;Refused Classification&#x27; due to an appropriate classification not being available for the medium. In July and August 2011, all Australian state Attorneys-General agreed to instate an R18+ rating for video games, which would be available by the end of 2011. Many games previously refused classification would now fit into the R18+ rating and, if the publisher chose to pay the reclassification fee, would theoretically be able to sell their game in Australia. The date was later changed to allow the rating to be introduced at the beginning of 2013.

Due to the licensing of the International Age Rating Coalition software for developers to rate their own game, several hundred games have been banned from various app stores as of 2015.

==Belgium==
In Belgium, games such as &quot;Phantasy Star Online 2&quot;, &quot;FIFA 17&quot;, &quot;Gears of War 4&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart Tour&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Mobile&quot; and others have been banned due to the usage of loot boxes (which constitute gambling under the country&#x27;s existing laws) and their equivalents. More are expected to be banned for the same reason.

==Brazil==
Brazil has banned many video games since 1999, mainly due to depictions of violence and cruelty, making it illegal to distribute and otherwise sell these games. Additionally, the Brazilian advisory rating system requires that all video games be rated by the organization, where unrated video games are banned from being sold in Brazil.

&quot;Bully&quot; is banned for showing violence and harassment in a school setting. The ban was lifted on 23 June 2016; the game can be acquired in physical and non-physical format through Steam.

&quot;Counter-Strike&quot; is banned because of violence and a map simulating a Favela in 2008. The ban was later lifted and the game is available for sale.

&quot;EverQuest&quot; is banned because the player is able to go on quests for both good and evil. 

&quot;Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City&quot; was banned in Barueri because it uses music by the Brazilian composer Hamilton da Silva Lourenço without proper permission. It has been resolved and was lifted in 2012.

==People&#x27;s Republic of China==
A large number of games were banned throughout China. Home gaming consoles were banned in mainland China from June 2000 until 2013. When the ban was lifted, eighth-generation consoles such as the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were allowed in the country.

As of April 2019, after implementing a new mandatory local rating and approval system, any and all games containing depictions of violence, blood, gambling and imperial history are &quot;de facto&quot; banned from all accessible platforms in the nation (unless otherwise changed to comply with local standards).

Notable games banned in this region are:

==Germany==
The list of confiscated video games was published as part of the official &quot;BzKJaktuell&quot; magazine by the Federal Agency for Child and Youth Protection in the Media. The list was last published in issue 1/22. No further list entries are known since then, although some titles have since been removed from the list.

Video games that have been confiscated by a court in Germany may no longer be sold, even to adults (however, private possession and use are permitted).

The list of confiscated media should not be confused with the &quot;&quot;List of Media Harmful to Young People&quot;&quot; (also known colloquially as &quot;The Index&quot;), as indexed video games are not considered banned. However, indexed video games are subject to strict restrictions and may only be offered and sold to adults.

From 2003 to April 2021, the &quot;List of Media Harmful to Young People&quot; was kept in four parts:
* &quot;Liste A&quot; contains physical media classified as harmful to minors (similar to an “adults only” rating).
* &quot;Liste B&quot; contains physical media which, in the opinion of the review panel, have criminal content.
* &quot;Liste C&quot; contains online media classified as harmful to minors (similar to an “adults only” rating).
* &quot;Liste D&quot; contains online media which, in the opinion of the review panel, have criminal content.

&quot;Liste C&quot; and &quot;Liste D&quot; contain online media and are not published because the content is accessible without barriers. These lists are contained as an encrypted database in online search engines or optionally in routers or youth protection filters.

Although inclusion in &quot;Liste B&quot; did not yet mean a ban, some titles were later confiscated by a court, so an entry on &quot;Liste B&quot; was often seen as a warning not to continue distributing the game in Germany (even if an entry in the &quot;Liste B&quot; is not a prerequisite for confiscation), although some games were moved to &quot;Liste A&quot; after a re-examination.

Video games that have been rejected by the Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle are not banned. These games may also only be offered and sold to adults on the German market.

As of November 15 2024, all games without a USK rating are de-facto delisted and forbidden for sale on all digital platforms in Germany after a reimplementation of the laws. Of course the same rule applies where if they&#x27;re bought outside of Germany, the individual is allowed to own them.

=== List of games confiscated by court in Germany ===
Since 2018, several games have had their bans lifted.

=== List of games added to the &quot;Liste B&quot; by the &quot;Federal Agency for Child and Youth Protection in the Media&quot; in Germany ===
Some games were added to the &quot;Liste B&quot; and later transferred to &quot;Liste A&quot; or removed from the &quot;List of Media Harmful to Young People&quot; altogether.

==Greece==

The Law 3037/2002 banned all electronic games in public places in the hopes that it would fight illegal gambling in the country. It was repealed in 2011.

==India==

On October 22, 2008, Microsoft announced that &quot;Fallout 3&quot; would not be released in India for the Xbox 360 platform. Religious and cultural sentiments were cited as the reason. Although the specific reason was not revealed, it is possible that it is because the game contains two-headed mutated cows called Brahmin, which was considered sensitive to religious beliefs. Brahmin is the name of a caste of Hindu priests and religious scholars. The spelling of Brahmin is also similar to Brahman which connotes the highest universal principle, the Ultimate Reality of the universe in Hinduism.

&quot;PUBG Mobile&quot; was banned because of extreme level of violence. The move came after a direction from the states of Gujarat and Jammu and Kashmir seeking a ban on the game, as it was claimed to affect the minds of youths. It was banned in the cities of Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, Bhavnagar and Rajkot of Gujarat, as well as all of Jammu and Kashmir including border areas . Players have been prosecuted for playing the game. However, there was PUBG Battlegrounds India. The game was later completely banned due to mishandling of data on 2 September 2020, along with &quot;Rules of Survival&quot;, &quot;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&quot; and &quot;Clash of Kings&quot; as a part of the Indian government&#x27;s ban on 59 Chinese-owned apps following the border skirmishes between the two countries. Later, an India-exclusive version of &quot;PUBG Mobile&quot;, &quot;Battlegrounds Mobile India&quot; was released by Krafton.

==Indonesia==
&quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; is banned in Indonesia because of excess violence and gore as well as depiction of communist symbolism which is strictly banned in the country. The game had featured bloody battles. 

==Iran==

&quot;1979 Revolution: Black Friday&quot; focuses on the Iranian Revolution of 1979 and was banned for presenting &quot;false and distorted information&quot; regarding the revolution, and for being anti-Iranian.

&quot;ARMA 3&quot; is banned due to the game&#x27;s portrayal of a fictional faction, which includes Iran and is an enemy of NATO.

&quot;Battlefield 3&quot; is banned because it presented a fictional U.S. invasion on Iran. Even before the ban, many retail stores were removing copies of the game from their shelves.

&quot;Clash of Clans&quot; is banned because it encourages violence, tribal war and is extensively addictive, as the government states.

&quot;Call of Duty: Mobile&quot;″s services were cancelled by developer Activision for unspecified reasons, but thought to involve United States sanctions against Iran.

&quot;Pokémon Go&quot; is banned due to security reasons.

&quot;Valkyrie Drive: Bhikkhuni&quot; is banned for excessively glorifying homosexuality and immoral values via eroge style animation. However, the ban does not extend to digital distributions.

== Iraq ==
&quot;Fortnite&quot; and &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot; are banned in Iraq because of negative effects caused by some electronic games on the health, culture, and security of Iraqi society. However, the ban is not in effect in Iraqi Kurdistan, where the games are still available and are quite popular.

==Republic of Ireland==
The IFCO rarely rates video games and leaves decisions to PEGI and the BBFC. &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; was banned for &quot;gross, unrelenting and gratuitous violence&quot;, but the ban was later lifted and the game was given a PEGI 18 rating.

==Italy==
In 2006, following the release of the trailer to the game &quot;Rule of Rose&quot;, the magazine &quot;Panorama&quot; ran an article claiming live burials of children at the protagonist&#x27;s hand. Shortly after, then-mayor of Rome, Walter Veltroni, called for a ban of the game in Italy. The game&#x27;s European publisher, 505 Games, dismissed these claims, and the game was not banned following Veltroni&#x27;s comments.

In 2007, following the decision of the governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland, the Minister of Communications Paolo Gentiloni publicly expressed the desire to ban the distribution of &quot;Manhunt 2&quot; in Italy, due to the gratuitous violence and excessive cruelty in the video game, but the ban was never put into practice.

==Japan==
Video games are rarely banned in Japan, and it holds the place as one of the top video game producers in the world. However, for some games, usually western, they may edit or censor their games if they appear offensive to Japan; an example being the Japanese release of &quot;Fallout 3&quot;. &quot;The Power of the Atom&quot; quest was edited to relieve concerns about atomic detonation in inhabited areas and the Fat Man weapon was renamed to the Nuka Launcher due to its relation to the real historic event. Another example is the Japanese version of &quot;Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back&quot; in which a death animation that has Crash squashed into a head and feet was altered due to its resemblance to the Kobe child murders. Japan&#x27;s Spike removed all references to Kim Jong-il and North Korea in &quot;Homefront&quot;, as well. &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot;, &quot;Bulletstorm&quot;, &quot;Gears of War 3&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, &quot;Dead Island&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;, &quot;Just Cause 2&quot; and numerous other violent titles, distributed physically and digitally, were heavily edited for excessive violence, but only on the localization level; the games can still be played if the locale is switched from Japanese to English. On 13 March 2019, the sales of &quot;Judgment&quot; had stopped producing future sales in Japan, following Pierre Taki&#x27;s arrest on suspicion of cocaine use. As a result, Sega had replaced both the voice actor and the character model having been subsequently removed. As of November 2022, video game The Callisto Protocol has been banned in Japan. CERO would not be rating due to the game&#x27;s violent content and the developer refused to make the necessary changes. Previously, the &quot;Dead Space series&quot; encountered the same fate, with all entries since the original 2008 release effectively being banned in Japan.

==Malaysia==

Malaysia tends to ban offensive content such as extreme-impact violence, depictions of cruelty, any content considered anti-Muslim, sexual content and nudity. In August 2008, after the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series ban in Thailand (see below), head of a Malaysian consumer rights organization, Muhammad Idris, called for the ban of the entire &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series and other similarly violent video games such as the &quot;Manhunt&quot; series and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. In February 2010, one week after &quot;Dante&#x27;s Inferno&quot; was released, the game was banned by the Jabatan Agama Islam (JAIS), a Muslim organisation in Malaysia, for depictions of Judeo-Christian hell iconography which was against Sharia, as well as cruelty and sexuality.

In September 2017, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) blocked access to the entire Steam store following the discovery of a controversial fighting game involving religious deities, &quot;Fight of Gods&quot;. The ban was lifted one day later after Valve agreed to block the game in Malaysia.

==Mexico==
&quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter 2&quot; was banned in the state of Chihuahua due to Mexican rebels being depicted as antagonists and stereotyping the cities of Chihuahua City and Ciudad Juárez. However, the game could still be found in shelves in other federal entities.

==Nepal==
&quot;PUBG and Roblox&quot; were banned because of delinquency issues involving youths. Currently, the ban has been lifted.

==New Zealand==

In New Zealand, games are classified by the country&#x27;s Office of Film and Literature Classification. If they are dubbed &quot;objectionable&quot; in all cases, they are banned. In this case, the game in question is not only illegal to sell, but also to own, possess, or import. Penalties may vary up to 2 years in prison, or 100,000$ in fines. Games are typically banned and classified as &quot;objectionable content&quot; when they contain extreme violence, offensive depictions of cruelty, animal cruelty, sexual content involving minors, or graphic depictions of sexual content, including sexual fetishes that are &quot;revolting or abhorrent&quot; (such as depictions of urination, bestiality, necrophilia, urophilia, coprophilia, and/or incest).

== Pakistan ==
On July 1, 2022, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority banned &quot;PlayerUnknown&#x27;s Battlegrounds&quot; (PUBG) after a teenager allegedly shot his family of four after binging the video game for days. The ban caused turmoil among the youth, whose protests mounted pressure against the regulator. It was eventually unbanned after nearly a month. 

Games such as &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops II&quot; and &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; have also been banned in Pakistan due to their portrayal of the country as a failed state where terrorist organizations openly operate.

==Philippines==
In 1981, a presidential decree issued by Ferdinand Marcos outlawed the use and distribution of video game consoles, arcade games and pinball machines, deeming them as a &quot;destructive social enemy&quot; and &quot;to the detriment of the public interest&quot;.

While no video games have been banned nationwide since 1986, at least one title, &quot;Defense of the Ancients&quot;, has been banned in a barangay in Dasmariñas, Cavite following complaints of delinquency issues, and two murder incidents involving youths in the area resulting from brawls in relation to the game. The ban, however, only covers internet cafes and does not extend to privately-and-individually-owned PCs in private homes.

==Russia==
In Russia, games are classified by the &quot;On Countering Extremist Activity&quot; federal law and are included in the &quot;Federal List of Extremist Materials&quot;.

Media in the United States and Europe have incorrectly reported that &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;, which features a storyline in which Russian ultra-nationalists take control of the country and invade the United States, was banned in Russia. Activision called these reports &quot;erroneous&quot;. Instead, a censored version of the game was published, omitting the controversial &quot;No Russian&quot; level. This also presumably prevented the game from being released on consoles in Russian, with only a PC version officially available.

Because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, few games are being released because many game developers are ceasing operations in Russia.

== Saudi Arabia ==
Most banned games can be found in many stores due to a lack of government enforcement of bans (often at a substantial price). However, not all major stores will stock banned titles.

==Singapore==
Singapore has banned games in the past and still occasionally does (including a ban on arcades nationwide from 1983 to the 1990s). With the implementation of the Video Game Classification in 2008 by the Media Development Authority, most games are widely available for purchase to their respective age group, such as those containing full frontal nudity or strong graphic violence under an &quot;M18&quot; rating. Games that were previously banned such as &quot;Mass Effect&quot; were re-rated either &quot;Age Advisory&quot; or &quot;M18&quot; after the implementation of the classification system.

==South Korea==

Since 2006, South Korea has only banned video games on rare occasions. Even before this, games were very rarely banned unless that game mentioned elements of the Korean War in order to avoid tensions between the countries North Korea and South Korea. However, &quot;Manhunt&quot;, &quot;Manhunt 2&quot;, and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; are still banned because of violence and cruelty. &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City&quot; and &quot;&quot; were previously banned, but the bans were later lifted.

The Game Rating Board requires that all video games be rated by the organization. Unrated titles are banned from being sold in the country, and websites selling them can be blocked.

==Thailand==

Since August 2008, all video game titles of the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series have been completely banned in Thailand, because of a case where an 18-year-old Thai player supposedly influenced by &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; killed a taxi driver from Bangkok. The ban, however, does not extend to the digital PC versions of &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;.

&quot;Tropico 5&quot; is yet another banned title. The ruling military junta at the time claimed that it could &quot;affect peace and order&quot; within the country.

==United Arab Emirates==

In the United Arab Emirates, a branch of the government called the National Media Council (NMC) works to control the media and entertainment industry in the country, and they have the authority to issue bans on any specific media products, including video games, to comply with the country&#x27;s legal and cultural values. Usually, the NMC do not explicitly state their actual consensus for any kind of issued ban on a product, so official reasons behind their bans remain unclear. However, bans issued by the NMC apply only to the sale of those products through local outlets; they do not make private ownership illegal. There are certain exceptions, notably for &quot;Spec Ops: The Line&quot; (see below). Some banned games may be available and sold on the nation&#x27;s grey market.

In 2018, the NMC introduced a localised rating system for various media, including video games.

The following titles are banned from mainstream physical retail. However, unlike Saudi Arabia, most of these games can still be seen on digital storefronts such as the PlayStation Store.
==United Kingdom==

Games in the UK usually only fail to receive a certification rating (effectively a ban) when they contain real sex scenes and/or gratuitous violence. BBFC age ratings are compulsory and backed by legislation, taking effect 30 July 2012. It is illegal to sell, buy or rent, but not import, a game that has not been classified by an approved age rating organisation in the UK. This only applies to games stored on physical media, not downloadable media.

==United States==
In the United States, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)—a self-regulatory organization—issues ratings for video games and enforces voluntary regulations on how they are marketed and sold. The Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association&quot;—which challenged a California law restricting the sale of &quot;violent video games&quot; (defined using a variation of the Miller test separate from ratings assigned by bodies such as the ESRB) to minors, insisting that video games were considered a protected form of expression under the First Amendment, meaning that federal or state law cannot be used to regulate their distribution based on content.

However, games can still be recalled as the result of court orders; a nude model featured in &quot;The Guy Game&quot; sued its developer and publisher over use of her likeness, as she was underage at the time of filming and thus could not personally consent to her depiction. All remaining copies of the game that contained her likeness were recalled from stores. In 1989, a court found that the Tengen version of &quot;Tetris&quot; for the Nintendo Entertainment System had violated Nintendo&#x27;s exclusive right to publish home console versions of &quot;Tetris&quot;, ordering Atari Games to recall the game and destroy all remaining copies. In 2012, a court found that Silicon Knights had plagiarized Epic Games&#x27; proprietary Unreal Engine, and had used it in &quot;Too Human&quot; and &quot;X-Men: Destiny&quot;, along with other unreleased projects. The studio was ordered to recall and destroy all remaining copies, materials, and source code relating to the games.

The ESRB&#x27;s highest rating, &quot;Adults Only&quot;, has been considered a total ban on the mainstream sale of certain games, as most retailers refuse to stock games carrying the rating, and they cannot be published on major video game consoles due to company policies. The release of &quot;Thrill Kill&quot;, an AO-rated fighting game with extreme violence and strong sexual themes, was outright cancelled by Electronic Arts (who had acquired its developer) due to objections over its content. Following the discovery of an incomplete sex minigame that was not included in the final game but was still present in the game&#x27;s code and could be accessed using a modification or cheating device, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; was re-rated Adults Only and recalled by Rockstar Games, in favor of a new revision of the game that omitted the offending content entirely and carried the original Mature rating.

On January 18, 2025, &quot;Marvel Snap&quot; was pulled from the App Store and Google Play Store as a result of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) being signed into law, with the app also preventing players from logging back in. This was due to security concerns being raised over the game&#x27;s publisher, known as Nuverse, whose parent company, ByteDance, was accused of collecting sensitive data, alongside their other applications (most notably the social media platform TikTok) and potentially sharing such information with the government of China, the company&#x27;s origin of operation, which is recognized as a foreign adversary of the United States.

==Ukraine==
&quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; is banned in Ukraine due to high-impact blood and gore and depictions of communist symbolism, which is banned per Ukrainian law.

==Uzbekistan==
Authorities in Uzbekistan banned a number of games over concerns that they could be &quot;used to propagate violence, pornography, threaten security and social and political stability&quot;, most notably first-person shooters such as &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;, horror games like &quot;Silent Hill&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and even relatively non-violent simulations such as &quot;The Sims&quot;. The ban was condemned and ridiculed for taking precedence over more important societal issues and a waste of time and effort.

==Vietnam==
Vietnam refused to release the 1992 title &quot;Mega Man 5&quot; due to the Napalm Man level resembling conflicts of the Vietnam War, which lasted from 1955 to 1975. It still remains absent in the country today. The country also banned the game &quot;Madden NFL 22&quot;.

<text>The Kerr effect, also called the quadratic electro-optic (QEO) effect, is a change in the refractive index of a material in response to an applied electric field. The Kerr effect is distinct from the Pockels effect in that the induced index change for the Kerr effect is directly proportional to the &quot;square&quot; of the electric field instead of varying linearly with it. All materials show a Kerr effect, but certain liquids display it more strongly than others. The Kerr effect was discovered in 1875 by Scottish physicist John Kerr.

Two special cases of the Kerr effect are normally considered, these being the Kerr electro-optic effect, or DC Kerr effect, and the optical Kerr effect, or AC Kerr effect.

== Kerr electro-optic effect ==
The Kerr electro-optic effect, or DC Kerr effect, is the special case in which a slowly varying external electric field is applied by, for instance, a voltage on electrodes across the sample material. Under this influence, the sample becomes birefringent, with different indices of refraction for light polarized parallel to or perpendicular to the applied field. The difference in index of refraction, &quot;Δn&quot;, is given by
:formula_1
where &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength of the light, &quot;K&quot; is the &quot;Kerr constant&quot;, and &quot;E&quot; is the strength of the electric field. This difference in index of refraction causes the material to act like a waveplate when light is incident on it in a direction perpendicular to the electric field. If the material is placed between two &quot;crossed&quot; (perpendicular) linear polarizers, no light will be transmitted when the electric field is turned off, while nearly all of the light will be transmitted for some optimum value of the electric field. Higher values of the Kerr constant allow complete transmission to be achieved with a smaller applied electric field.

Some polar liquids, such as nitrotoluene (C7H7NO2) and nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) exhibit very large Kerr constants. A glass cell filled with one of these liquids is called a &quot;Kerr cell&quot;. These are frequently used to modulate light, since the Kerr effect responds very quickly to changes in electric field. Light can be modulated with these devices at frequencies as high as 10 GHz. Because the Kerr effect is relatively weak, a typical Kerr cell may require voltages as high as 30 kV to achieve complete transparency. This is in contrast to Pockels cells, which can operate at much lower voltages. Another disadvantage of Kerr cells is that the best available material, nitrobenzene, is poisonous. Some transparent crystals have also been used for Kerr modulation, although they have smaller Kerr constants.

In media that lack inversion symmetry, the Kerr effect is generally masked by the much stronger Pockels effect. The Kerr effect is still present, however, and in many cases can be detected independently of Pockels effect contributions.

The optical Kerr effect, or AC Kerr effect is the case in which the electric field is due to the light itself. This causes a variation in index of refraction which is proportional to the local irradiance of the light. This refractive index variation is responsible for the nonlinear optical effects of self-focusing, self-phase modulation and modulational instability, and is the basis for Kerr-lens modelocking. This effect only becomes significant with very intense beams such as those from lasers. The optical Kerr effect has also been observed to dynamically alter the mode-coupling properties in multimode fiber, a technique that has potential applications for all-optical switching mechanisms, nanophotonic systems and low-dimensional photo-sensors devices.

== Magneto-optic Kerr effect ==

The magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is the phenomenon that the light reflected from a magnetized material has a slightly rotated plane of polarization. It is similar to the Faraday effect where the plane of polarization of the transmitted light is rotated.

== Theory ==

=== DC Kerr effect ===
For a nonlinear material, the electric polarization formula_2 will depend on the electric field formula_3:

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the vacuum permittivity and formula_6 is the formula_7-th order component of the electric susceptibility of the medium.
We can write that relationship explicitly; the &quot;i-&quot;th component for the vector &quot;P&quot; can be expressed as:
:formula_8

where formula_9. It is often assumed that formula_10 ∥ formula_11, i.e., the component parallel to &quot;x&quot; of the polarization field; formula_12 ∥ formula_13 and so on.

For a linear medium, only the first term of this equation is significant and the polarization varies linearly with the electric field.

For materials exhibiting a non-negligible Kerr effect, the third, χ(3) term is significant, with the even-order terms typically dropping out due to inversion symmetry of the Kerr medium. Consider the net electric field E produced by a light wave of frequency ω together with an external electric field E0:

:formula_14

where Eω is the vector amplitude of the wave.

Combining these two equations produces a complex expression for P. For the DC Kerr effect, we can neglect all except the linear terms and those in formula_15:

:formula_16

which is similar to the linear relationship between polarization and an electric field of a wave, with an additional non-linear susceptibility term proportional to the square of the amplitude of the external field.

For non-symmetric media (e.g. liquids), this induced change of susceptibility produces a change in refractive index in the direction of the electric field:

:formula_17

where λ0 is the vacuum wavelength and &quot;K&quot; is the &quot;Kerr constant&quot; for the medium. The applied field induces birefringence in the medium in the direction of the field. A Kerr cell with a transverse field can thus act as a switchable wave plate, rotating the plane of polarization of a wave travelling through it. In combination with polarizers, it can be used as a shutter or modulator.

The values of &quot;K&quot; depend on the medium and are about 9.4×10−14 m·V−2 for water, and 4.4×10−12 m·V−2 for nitrobenzene.

For crystals, the susceptibility of the medium will in general be a tensor, and the Kerr effect produces a modification of this tensor.

=== AC Kerr effect ===
In the optical or AC Kerr effect, an intense beam of light in a medium can itself provide the modulating electric field, without the need for an external field to be applied. In this case, the electric field is given by:

:formula_18

where Eω is the amplitude of the wave as before.

Combining this with the equation for the polarization, and taking only linear terms and those in χ(3)|Eω|3:

:formula_19

As before, this looks like a linear susceptibility with an additional non-linear term:

:formula_20

and since:

:formula_21

where &quot;n&quot;0=(1+χLIN)1/2 is the linear refractive index. Using a Taylor expansion since χNL ≪ &quot;n&quot;02, this gives an &quot;intensity dependent refractive index&quot; (IDRI) of:

:formula_22

where &quot;n&quot;2 is the second-order nonlinear refractive index, and &quot;I&quot; is the intensity of the wave. The refractive index change is thus proportional to the intensity of the light travelling through the medium.

The values of &quot;n&quot;2 are relatively small for most materials, on the order of 10−20 m2 W−1 for typical glasses. Therefore, beam intensities (irradiances) on the order of 1 GW cm−2 (such as those produced by lasers) are necessary to produce significant variations in refractive index via the AC Kerr effect.

The optical Kerr effect manifests itself temporally as self-phase modulation, a self-induced phase- and frequency-shift of a pulse of light as it travels through a medium. This process, along with dispersion, can produce optical solitons.

Spatially, an intense beam of light in a medium will produce a change in the medium&#x27;s refractive index that mimics the transverse intensity pattern of the beam. For example, a Gaussian beam results in a Gaussian refractive index profile, similar to that of a gradient-index lens. This causes the beam to focus itself, a phenomenon known as self-focusing.

As the beam self-focuses, the peak intensity increases which, in turn, causes more self-focusing to occur. The beam is prevented from self-focusing indefinitely by nonlinear effects such as multiphoton ionization, which become important when the intensity becomes very high. As the intensity of the self-focused spot increases beyond a certain value, the medium is ionized by the high local optical field. This lowers the refractive index, defocusing the propagating light beam. Propagation then proceeds in a series of repeated focusing and defocusing steps.

<doc id="661042" wikidata="Q17467" url="?curid=661042" title="Same-sex marriage in Massachusetts">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legally recognized in Massachusetts since May 17, 2004, as a result of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) ruling in &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; that it was unconstitutional under the Constitution of Massachusetts to allow only opposite-sex couples to marry. Massachusetts was the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage after the Netherlands, Belgium, Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec. It was the first U.S. state to open marriage to same-sex couples.

==Legal history==

===Background===
In 1989, passing legislation first proposed in 1973, Massachusetts prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation in credit, public and private employment, union practices, housing, and public accommodation. In the decade that followed, political debate addressed same-sex relationships through two proxy issues: spousal benefits and parenting rights. The Boston City Council debated health insurance for the same-sex partners of city employees in May 1991, and Cambridge began providing health benefits to the same-sex partners of its employees the following year. In 1992, Governor Bill Weld issued an executive order providing limited benefits to the same-sex partners of approximately 3,000 management-level state employees, covering only leave for family sickness and bereavement, far short of the health benefits LGBT activists were seeking, but probably the first state-level recognition of same-sex relationships. The Roman Catholic bishops of Massachusetts, replying in &quot;The Pilot&quot;, the newspaper of the Boston Archdiocese, said that Weld&#x27;s &quot;domestic partners&quot; decision harms the common good &quot;by making a special interest group equal to the family&quot; and confuses &quot;civil rights and family benefits&quot;. They asked: &quot;Why should special recognition and assistance be given to friends who happen to share the same house?&quot; Legislation to establish domestic partnerships that would carry spousal benefits was introduced annually in the Massachusetts General Court without success. Its supporters focused on equal benefits and fairness rather than same-sex relationships themselves. In 1998, when the General Court passed a home rule petition allowing Boston to create such a status, Governor Paul Cellucci vetoed it because it applied to different-sex couples, which he thought undermined marriage, while he offered to sign legislation that applied to same-sex couples only. Mayor Thomas Menino&#x27;s attempt to extend health care benefits to Boston city employees&#x27; domestic partners by executive order was successfully challenged by the Catholic Action League in court.

The state had no explicit regulations with respect to foster care and parenting by gays and lesbians, either singly or in relationships, until, on May 24, 1985, the state Department of Social Services, with the approval of Governor Michael Dukakis, created a rule that foster children be placed in &quot;traditional family settings&quot;. In December 1986, a commission that reviewed the foster care system recommended that sexual orientation could not be used to disqualify foster parents. As Dukakis delayed accepting that recommendation, advocates for gay and lesbian rights threatened protests against his presidential campaign. The ban on gay foster parents was enacted into law in the 1989 budget. After a lawsuit challenging the ban was settled out of court, the Dukakis administration withdrew the policy in April 1990. In the 1990s, court decisions further expanded the parenting rights of gays and lesbians. In September 1993, the state&#x27;s highest court ruled that state law allowed for second-parent adoption by a parent of the same sex as a biological parent. In July 1999, the same court awarded visitation rights to each of two mothers after their separation. 
Same-sex marriage itself was rarely mentioned or addressed directly during these years. The Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights launched a campaign on behalf of marriage rights for same-sex couples in Massachusetts in 1991. Governor Bill Weld said he would be willing to meet with the group and said he was undecided on the question. When asked about &quot;gay marriage&quot; while running to represent Massachusetts in the U.S. Senate in 1994, Mitt Romney said: &quot;it is not appropriate at this time&quot;. In December 1996, considering the possibility of Hawaii legalizing same-sex marriage, Weld said that Massachusetts would recognize the validity of same-sex marriages licensed there. He called the &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; (DOMA) unconstitutional.

===Protection of Marriage Amendment===
In December 1998, Representative John H. Rogers, a Democrat, proposed legislation to prevent Massachusetts from granting legal recognition to same-sex marriages established elsewhere: &quot;a purported marriage contracted between persons of the same sex shall be neither valid nor recognized in the Commonwealth.&quot; In 1999, the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts called it a &quot;hate bill&quot; and a coalition of more than 150 religious leaders formed the Religious Coalition for the Freedom to Marry to oppose it. Other religious leaders organized in support of the measure. Rogers revised his proposal to define marriage as &quot;the union of a man and a woman&quot; when he offered it again in 2001, with the additional provision that &quot;Any other relationship shall not be recognized as a marriage, or its legal equivalent, or receive the benefits exclusive to marriage in the Commonwealth.&quot; The chair of the Lesbian and Gay Political Alliance of Massachusetts said its prospects for passage were slim but it could serve as a countervailing proposal to efforts at establishing civil unions or providing benefits to same-sex partners of state and local government employees. Alongside these legislative maneuvers, the Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD) filed a lawsuit in state court challenging the denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples in April 2001.

In July 2001, Massachusetts Citizens for Marriage announced a campaign to amend the Constitution of Massachusetts with language similar to Rogers&#x27; legislation, called the &quot;Protection of Marriage Amendment&quot;. Some signature gatherers complained that opponents of the amendment were harassing them and their opponents charged in turn that some signature gatherers were misrepresenting the petition&#x27;s content. A sufficient number of signatures were certified in December.

The President of the Massachusetts Senate controls the calling of a constitutional convention and its agenda. Senate President Tom Birmingham, an opponent of the amendment, called a joint meeting of the General Court as a constitutional convention for June 19, 2002, and immediately adjourned it for a month saying legislators needed for time to consider the agenda items. When the constitutional convention met again on July 17, the amendment&#x27;s opponents knew that proponents had the 50 votes needed for passage. Birmingham, who was presiding, moved for adjournment without considering the amendment, and his motion passed 137 to 53. He called the amendment &quot;wrong-hearted and wrong-headed&quot; and defended the procedure: &quot;Everybody recognizes a vote to adjourn was a vote up or down&quot; on the amendment. &quot;I did gavel the last constitutional convention to a recess because I felt the members needed more time to assess... Today we saw democracy in action. They may not like it, but they lost two to one.&quot; A representative of the Catholic Action League, which supported the amendment, said: &quot;Everything that is wrong with Massachusetts state government was apparent today for all the world to see&quot;. One legislator who voted to adjourn said: &quot;For those of us who believe in an open democratic process, this was not a comfortable vote&quot;. State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques, an opponent of the amendment and a lesbian, said: &quot;I&#x27;m proud to have done anything possible to defeat this hate-filled, discriminatory measure. I&#x27;ll take a victory on this any way I can get it.&quot; Arlene Isaacson of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus later explained it was a critical moment because same-sex marriage had no chance of winning a popular vote at the time: &quot;Not that we would lose by a little, because that wasn&#x27;t an issue. Rather, it was that we were going to get massacred&quot;.

In April 2003, a committee of the General Court held a hearing on the constitutional amendment, but took no action. The four Roman Catholic bishops of Massachusetts, long distracted by the revelations of the sexual abuse of minors by priests, did not address the issue until late May, when they ordered pastors to read and publish a statement to mobilize their parishioners to contact their legislators to urge then to support the constitutional amendment.

===&quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot;===

Seven same-sex couples represented by Gay &amp; Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD) initiated a lawsuit in state court, &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot;, on April 11, 2001. GLAD attorney, Jennifer Levi, argued the case in Superior Court on behalf of the plaintiffs. Levi argued that denying same-sex couples equal marriage rights was unconstitutional under the State Constitution. On May 7, 2002, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Thomas E. Connolly ruled that the state marriage statute was not gender-neutral, no fundamental right to same-sex marriage existed, and that limiting marriage to male-female couples was rational because &quot;procreation is marriage&#x27;s central purpose&quot;. He concluded his legal analysis by saying that the issue should be handled by the General Court.

The plaintiffs appealed directly to the Supreme Judicial Court (SJC), which heard arguments on March 4, 2003. Mary Bonauto of GLAD argued the case for the plaintiffs. Assistant Attorney General Judith Yogman represented the Massachusetts Department of Public Health. On November 18, 2003, the SJC ruled 4 to 3 that the state&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage was unconstitutional. The court said: &quot;We declare that barring an individual from the protections, benefits, and obligations of civil marriage solely because that person would marry a person of the same sex violates the Massachusetts Constitution.&quot; It provided a definition of marriage that would meet the State Constitution&#x27;s requirements: &quot;We construe civil marriage to mean the voluntary union of two persons as spouses, to the exclusion of all others.&quot; The court stayed its ruling for 180 days (i.e. until May 17, 2004) to allow the General Court to &quot;take such action as it may deem appropriate in light of this opinion.&quot; In a widely quoted passage from the majority ruling, Chief Justice Margaret Marshall wrote:

Governor Mitt Romney said he disagreed with the SJC&#x27;s decision, but &quot;We obviously have to follow the law as provided by the Supreme Judicial Court, even if we don&#x27;t agree with it&quot;. He said he would work with the General Court to draft a law &quot;consistent&quot; with the ruling. He also backed an amendment to the State Constitution to define marriage as &quot;the union of a man and a woman&quot; while also providing by statute &quot;basic civil rights and appropriate benefits to same-sex couples and other nontraditional relationships.&quot; Romney quickly joined legislators in attempting to satisfy the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision by creating civil unions for same-sex couples. His views were recognized as an attempt to establish his record on a controversial issue while planning to run for the Republican nomination for president. Former Governor Weld took credit for laying the groundwork for the decision: &quot;A lot of the stuff we did foreshadowed the opinion.&quot; He said: &quot;It is a thunderbolt, but a thunderbolt correctly heard.&quot;

Opponents of gay and lesbian rights opposed any compromise with the SJC. Brian Camenker, head of the Parents Rights Coalition, said: &quot;As Martin Luther King Jr. pointed out in his letter from the Birmingham jail, there are some laws that are so unnatural that you have an obligation to openly defy them. The concept of stable, healthy gay relationships is largely a manufacturing of the gay propaganda machine.&quot; He called the decision &quot;complete lunacy&quot; and said: &quot;It&#x27;s beyond shocking. It&#x27;s madness. It&#x27;s four judges basically turning society inside out with no input from anybody else.&quot;

===Interpreting &quot;Goodridge&quot;===
On December 11, 2003, the Massachusetts Senate put forward legislative language creating civil unions for same-sex couples to the SJC, asking if it satisfied the court&#x27;s requirements. On February 4, 2004, the court replied that it was unacceptable to allow different-sex couples marriages but same-sex couples only civil unions, that the distinction between marriage and civil unions constituted unconstitutional discrimination, even if the rights and obligations attached to each were identical. It called the difference between the terms marriage and civil union &quot;a considered choice of language that reflects a demonstrable assigning of same-sex, largely homosexual, couples to second-class status.&quot; As for the argument that the federal government&#x27;s refusal to recognize same-sex marriages as marriages justified the use of a different term, the court said: &quot;Courts define what is constitutionally permissible, and the Massachusetts Constitution does not permit this kind of labeling... We do not abrogate the fullest measure of protection to which residents of the Commonwealth are entitled under the Massachusetts Constitution ... because those rights might not be acknowledged elsewhere.&quot; The court also reiterated the need for the General Court to modify the state&#x27;s marital laws. &quot;The purpose of the stay was to afford the Legislature an opportunity to conform the existing statutes to the provisions of the Goodridge decision.&quot; It ended: &quot;The answer to the question is &#x27;No.&#x27;&quot; Religious leaders responded with strong statements on both sides of the issue. Archbishop Seán Patrick O&#x27;Malley said in a statement: &quot;The tone and tenor of this answer clearly demonstrates the overly activist stance of the four-judge majority... Clearly, the justices who issued this opinion seem determined to blur the constitutional separation of powers and to usurp the rightful role of the Legislature.&quot; He called for the General Court to act during its scheduled joint session to put a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage to a popular vote. Governor Mitt Romney authored an op-ed in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that called the latest SJC ruling &quot;wrongly decided and deeply mistaken&quot;, backed a state constitutional amendment and urged other states to take similar action, but did not endorse the idea of a federal constitutional amendment.

Without coming to agreement on how to proceed, legislative leaders considered several legal options, including passing statutes to delay the implementation of &quot;Goodridge&quot;, a strategy outlined by Mary Ann Glendon of Harvard Law School, until a referendum on a constitutional amendment could be held in November 2006. Amending the Massachusetts Constitution is a multi-year process that could not be accomplished before the date set by the SJC for the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples. In order to amend the State Constitution, it is necessary for an amendment first to receive sufficient support at two state constitutional conventions, which is a joint meeting of the two houses of the General Court (the House of Representatives and the Senate), held during two successive two-year sessions, before going before the voters in a referendum during a normally scheduled November election. An amendment put forward by legislators needs a majority (101 out of 200) at two constitutional conventions and an amendment put forward by petition needs a 25% vote (50 out of 200) at two constitutional conventions.

===Constitutional convention 2004===
Advocates of same-sex marriage, who had been far outnumbered as demonstrators two years earlier, were a large and constant presence in the House of Representatives throughout the 2004 convention, coordinated by MassEquality, an umbrella organization formed to respond to the public backlash against &quot;Goodridge&quot;. They had mobilized constituent telephone calls with increasing success in the weeks before the convention and emphasized the impact on children being raised by gay parents. The amendment&#x27;s proponents drew support from Massachusetts Citizens for Life and larger donations than they had previously received, along with personal lobbying in localities.

The General Court met in joint session as a constitutional convention on February 11, and after six hours of debate rejected two amendments, one proposed by House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran and the other by Senate President Robert Travaglini. Both would have banned same-sex marriage, one would have made civil unions possible in the future and the other would have established civil unions. Finneran commented: &quot;We are as divided as the nation on this. We are doing the best we can. We are human beings. We struggle. Sometimes we come up short.&quot; The convention met again the next day and defeated an amendment that defined marriage as &quot;the union of a man and a woman&quot; and disavowed any position on civil unions on a 103–94 vote that showed divisions in each party and Catholic legislators evenly divided. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute blamed Finneran&#x27;s misreading of his own caucus for the failure of his own proposed language, a defeat in the convention&#x27;s opening moments from which Crews found it impossible to recover.

At the end of March, after extended debate, and some tactical voting in which some legislators backed measures they would not ultimately support in order to prevent the adoption of an even stronger measure, the convention passed by a vote of 105–92 an amendment to ban same-sex marriage but allow civil unions. It also specified that civil unions should not be treated as marriages for federal purposes. The language adopted had Romney&#x27;s support. One report described the process: &quot;Tenuous and shifting coalitions held together in the final vote, despite a series of parliamentary moves by liberal lawmakers to stop anything from moving forward. In the end, an amendment that was disliked by the political right and the political left was approved because it was the only measure that could draw the support of a majority of lawmakers.&quot; The proposed amendment, if approved by a second constitutional convention in 2005, would have been placed before the voters as a referendum in November 2006. Romney believed the vote justified asking the SJC to stay its ruling requiring the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples on May 17, but Attorney General Thomas Reilly said there was no legal basis for making that request.

As the constitutional convention concluded its work on the amendment, some politicians announced plans to make the November 2004 elections a referendum on same-sex marriage. In Vermont, following the enactment of civil unions legislation in 2000, a large group of its supporters had been defeated. One political action committee announced plans to target legislative candidates who supported same-sex marriage, eight Republicans and two independents. Ronald Crews of the Massachusetts Family Institute estimated a possible shift of 10 to 15 seats against same-sex marriage. The elections resulted in shifts that consistently favored supporters of same-sex marriage rights. Carl Sciortino, a gay activist and first-time candidate, drew support from supporters of same-sex marriage, but ran largely on traditional issues like education, taxation, and health care, and narrowly defeated a 16-year veteran and same-sex marriage opponent in the Democratic primary on September 14. Later that month, Speaker of the House Finneran resigned from the General Court to be replaced by Salvatore DiMasi, who backed same-sex marriage. Some candidates who backed a constitutional amendment did not make same-sex marriage a campaign issue as anticipated, but it proved critical in a few races. All 50 incumbents who opposed a constitutional amendment and faced challengers won re-election. Four supporters of &quot;Goodridge&quot; retired and successors with similar views replaced them. Five opponents of &quot;Goodridge&quot; retired and three of their successors were supporters of same-sex marriage. In special elections in the spring of 2005, three incumbents who supported a constitutional amendment lost to supporters of same-sex marriage.

===Attempts to delay implementation===
Despite Romney&#x27;s urging, Attorney General Reilly refused to ask the SJC to stay its decision, saying that implementation was not problematic and that a popular vote on a constitutional amendment was the only way to resolve the issue. On April 16, 2004, Romney asked the General Court to pass legislation giving him authority to request a stay. He said the implementation of the SJC ruling presented legal complications, citing both a 1913 law that invalidated the marriage of non-residents if the marriage was invalid in their home state and the possibility that a popular referendum on same-sex marriage might retroactively invalidate same-sex marriages. Conservative groups like the Coalition for Marriage praised Romney for continuing to search for a way to block same-sex marriages.

In April, the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts and several conservative advocacy organizations tried to block the implementation of &quot;Goodridge&quot; in state court until the attempt to amend the State Constitution was allowed to run its course. A single justice of the SJC dismissed the complaint on May 3. A few days later, shortly before the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision was to take effect, four conservative public interest law firms, Liberty Counsel, the Thomas More Law Center, Citizens for the Preservation of Constitutional Rights, and the American Family Association Center for Law and Policy, brought suit in federal court on behalf of the Vice President of the Catholic Action League, Robert Largess, and eleven members of the General Court to stop the May 17 marriages. It argued that the SJC&#x27;s decision deprived the people of Massachusetts of their right to a republican government. On May 13, 2004, U.S. District Court Judge Joseph Tauro denied their request for an injunction delaying implementation of the decision, as did the First Circuit Court of Appeals on June 29. In November, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case without comment.

On May 14, Democratic Representative Philip Travis filed legislation to impeach Chief Justice Margaret Marshall, the author of the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision. Another bill targeted all four justices who signed the majority decision in that case.

===Implementation===
With respect to implementation, the principal dispute concerned the 1913 statute that denied a marriage license to a couple if their marriage would not be valid in their state of residence. The Massachusetts Town Clerks&#x27; Association raised the issue for the first time on February 24, reporting that some of them were receiving inquiries from out-of-state couples. New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer made the question more urgent when he issued a non-binding opinion on March 3 that &quot;New York common law requires recognizing as valid a marriage... validly executed in another state&quot;. On March 31, Romney took the position that no other states recognized same-sex marriage and therefore residents of other states could not marry in Massachusetts. Reilly took the position that 38 states expressly denied recognition to same-sex marriages and that residents of other states could obtain licenses.

Localities that supported the right of same-sex couples to marry resisted both those interpretations. On April 11, Provincetown&#x27;s Board of Selectmen decided their town clerk would approve marriage license applications from any couple that swore, as was customary, that their marriage was lawful. The town manager said: &quot;We&#x27;ve never been the marriage police with heterosexual couples, and we&#x27;re not about to start with same-sex couples&quot;. Worcester&#x27;s clerk took a similar position on April 16. Before the end of the month, an investigation by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; showed that since 1976 town clerks had been repeatedly instructed not to question applicants for marriage licenses about their eligibility. A spokesman for Governor Romney said that the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision &quot;changed the definition of marriage, it changed the way the new marriage forms look, and it changed the way city and town clerks will carry out the requirements of the law.&quot;

When Romney suggested confusion over the 1913 law justified postponing the implementation of &quot;Goodridge&quot;, Mary Bonauto, the lawyer who successfully argued &quot;Goodridge&quot;, suggested he get the law repealed: &quot;If he&#x27;s so concerned about problems, he can file an emergency bill to repeal that law. Massachusetts has basically said discriminating against people of the same sex is unconstitutional. So why would we try so hard to uphold another state&#x27;s discriminatory law?&quot; She asked: &quot;Under the governor&#x27;s logic, if some state again started banning marriages between Catholics and Protestants, then would Massachusetts enforce that?&quot; In an interview on April 23, Romney said: &quot;Massachusetts should not become the Las Vegas of same-sex marriage. We do not intend to export our marriage confusion to the entire nation.&quot; His spokesman announced he was sending letters to the governors and attorneys general of the other states to explain his view that same-sex marriage was not legal in their state and asking &quot;if we&#x27;re wrong&quot; about that. Denying license to all out-of-state couples became known as &quot;the Romney plan&quot;. It also allowed visitors from Ontario to marry, since same-sex marriage was legal there. The governor&#x27;s legal counsel, Daniel Winslow, warned that a justice of the peace who could not in conscience officiate at a same-sex wedding should resign.

On May 4, when the Romney Administration began training clerks to handle applications from same-sex couples, a report from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called it &quot;a major shift from the governor&#x27;s earlier stance on enforcing limitations on licensing gay marriage.&quot; The new forms were gender-neutral, identifying the applicants as &quot;Party A&quot; and Party B&quot; and asking each to check a box for either male or female. Clerks could require proof of residency if they asked that of all couples, but needed only to have applicants swear that there were no legal impediments to their marrying in Massachusetts. The administration said that earlier reports had been premature. Some towns and clerks announced plans to knowingly issue licenses to out-of-staters, including Provincetown, Worcester, and Somerville. Bonauto said that GLAD&#x27;s position was that applicants should never be less than honest, &quot;let alone on a form signed under oath&quot;.

===First same-sex marriages===

On May 16, 2004, Cambridge, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as having &quot;a well-known taste for erudite rebelliousness&quot;, decorated the wooden staircases of City Hall with white organza. Hundreds of applicants and supporters in celebratory dress–&quot;glittery party hats and boutonnieres&quot;–gathered in the street. City officials opened the building at 12:01 a.m. May 17 &quot;for a rousing party, with wedding cake, sparkling cider and the music of the Cambridge Community Chorus.&quot; Some 262 couples obtained licenses, starting with Marcia Hams and Susan Shepherd. The first to wed in Cambridge were Tanya McCloskey and Marcia Kadish at 9:15 a.m. Cambridge City Clerk Margaret Drury was the first city clerk in the U.S. to perform a legal same-sex marriage. Massachusetts has a three-day waiting period before issuing marriage licenses, but many couples obtained waivers of the waiting period in order to be wed as soon as possible.

Other cities and towns in Massachusetts began issuing applications during normal business hours. Boston Mayor Thomas Menino greeted three of the couples who were plaintiffs in &quot;Goodridge&quot; and said: &quot;We&#x27;ve broken down the barrier. I am so proud of these people. I am very proud to be mayor of this city today.&quot; The first to marry in Boston City Hall were Tom Weikle and Joe Rogers, who lined up for their license application at 5:30 a.m. and were wed about 11 a.m. by Boston&#x27;s city clerk. Rejecting the Romney&#x27;s insistence that the 1913 statute be respected, Somerville Mayor Joseph Curtatone addressed a crowd of same-sex couples that included several from New York gathered in front of Town Hall at 8 am.: &quot;No matter who you are or where you come from, if you fill out the application, you will be given a license to marry. Those of you from out of state, welcome to Somerville.&quot; The seven couples who were party to the &quot;Goodridge&quot; lawsuit were all wed on May 17, beginning with Robert Compton and David Wilson at Boston&#x27;s Arlington Street Church. There were sizable celebrations in Northampton, Worcester, and Provincetown, while &quot;explicit protests were scattered and few&quot;.

A survey from &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; found that half of the couples who applied for licenses on the first day had been partners for a decade or more. Two-thirds were women and 30% were raising children. Only the towns that had made an issue of issuing licenses to out-of-staters had appreciable numbers of them. In the first week, 2,468 same-sex couples applied for licenses, including at least 164 from 27 other states and the District of Columbia. News coverage of the day&#x27;s events in Massachusetts was extensive, though limited outside the United States. The &quot;Today Show&quot; broadcast live coverage from outside Boston City Hall. The three major networks lead their evening news shows with wedding coverage. &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; ran the tag &quot;For better or for worse&quot; above the headline &quot;Same-sex weddings make history&quot;. It was the lead story in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

Governor Romney in a brief statement said: &quot;All along, I have said an issue as fundamental to society as the definition of marriage should be decided by the people. Until then, I intend to follow the law and expect others to do the same.&quot; President George W. Bush took note of these events in Massachusetts with a statement calling for a federal constitutional amendment &quot;defining and protecting marriage as a union of a man and a woman as husband and wife.&quot; It said: &quot;The sacred institution of marriage should not be redefined by a few activist judges. All Americans have a right to be heard in this debate.&quot; On the same day, non-binding opinions by the attorneys general of two more neighboring states fueled debate about enforcing the 1913 law. On May 17, Richard Blumenthal wrote in a letter to Romney that the status of an out-of-state same-sex marriage in Connecticut was not &quot;automatically void&quot;, and Patrick C. Lynch reported that Rhode Island only invalidated a marriage that violated public policy as in cases of &quot;bigamy, incest or mental incompetence&quot;.

===Constitutional convention 2005===
The constitutional convention took up the compromise amendment approved in 2004. It failed on a vote of 157–39 on September 14, after many moderate legislators who had initially supported it refused to and most legislators opposed to same-sex marriage abandoned its compromise language. State Senator Brian Lees, a Republican who co-sponsored the amendment in the previous convention, explained why he withdrew his support: &quot;Gay marriage has begun, and life has not changed for the citizens of the commonwealth, with the exception of those who can now marry. This amendment which was an appropriate measure or compromise a year ago, is no longer, I feel, a compromise today.&quot; Opponents turned instead to an alternative method of amending the Constitution that they thought would allow them to present an uncompromising ban on same-sex marriage to the voters. This method would require the collection of thousands of signatures on petitions but would need the support of only a quarter of the legislators to become a referendum. The process of gathering signatures was already underway when the legislators voted to reject the 2004 compromise. Travis explained that the opponents&#x27; fervor came in reaction to the position taken by gay and lesbian activists:
===Initiative to amend the State Constitution===

====Petitions====
An organization called VoteOnMarriage.org organized the petition drive. Its backers included Governor Romney, former Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn, former SJC Justice Joseph Nolan, and Gilbert Thompson, president of the board of the Black Ministerial Alliance of Greater Boston. The language of their amendment was: 

Unlike amendments in other states, the amendment did not explicitly forbid other forms of legal relationships for same-sex couples, such as civil unions or domestic partnerships. It did not attempt to invalidate same-sex marriages licensed since &quot;Goodridge&quot;.

Attorney General Reilly certified the language and format of the petitions as valid on September 7, 2005. Advocates of same-sex marriage objected that the proposed amendment was clearly designed to reverse the SJC decision, a violation of the State Constitution&#x27;s rule that amendments could not be used for that purpose. Deval Patrick, Reilly&#x27;s principal opponent for the Democratic nomination for governor, said &quot;There was a strong argument that this should have gone a different way.&quot; Massachusetts Secretary of State William F. Galvin said: &quot;I think this is one of those instances where the institution of gay marriage may be less divisive to society than the referendum campaign will be. The emotions that this kind of issue brings out can be very detrimental to society. It has been around for a year and any honest person can conclude that it has not been detrimental to society.&quot;

VoteOnMarriage.org collected 170,000 signatures before the December 7, 2005 deadline, almost three times the number required. Paid signature collectors from Arno Political Consultants subsequently revealed that an unknown but large number of these signatures had been collected through fraud. The collectors told voters that they were signing a petition about a different issue or that the petitions were in favor of same-sex marriage. In a case led by attorney Jennifer Levi, GLAD challenged Reilly&#x27;s certification of the petitions in court, claiming the effort contradicted a provision of the Massachusetts Constitution (Article 48, Section 2), which prohibits the use of such petitions for &quot;reversal of a judicial decision.&quot; In July, the SJC ruled unanimously that the amendment did not constitute &quot;reversal&quot; of a judicial decision, given that the proposed amendment sought to define only those marriages performed after its passage. If passed, the amendment would have restricted future marriages to different-sex couples but would not have invalidated the approximately 8,000 same-sex marriage licenses already issued.

====Constitutional convention 2006====
On July 12, 2006, the General Court sitting as a constitutional convention voted 100 to 91 to postpone action on the initiative amendment until November 9, 2006, two days after the elections. Supporters of same-sex marriage sought the delay, which the amendment&#x27;s backers denounced and Romney criticized it. As that date neared, Arline Isaacson, a lobbyist for the Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, was not optimistic about her side&#x27;s chances and Senate President Robert Travaglini was considering allowing a vote to adjourn without acting on the measure. Instead, on November 9, 2006, the legislators in convention voted 109 to 87 to recess until January 2, the last day of the legislative session.

On November 19, 2006, Governor Romney led a rally against the General Court&#x27;s delaying tactics in front of the Massachusetts State House. Romney said: &quot;The issue before us is not whether same-sex couples should marry. The issue before us today is whether 109 legislators will follow the constitution.&quot; He said he would ask a justice of the SJC to order the initiative placed on the ballot because the legislators were refusing to fulfill their constitutional obligations. The next day, he sent the 109 legislators a copy of the State Constitution with a letter underscoring the document&#x27;s provision that the legislators sitting as a constitutional convention &quot;shall&quot; vote on initiatives: &quot;Not &#x27;may&#x27; vote ... not &#x27;could&#x27; vote ... not &#x27;perhaps&#x27; vote ... It&#x27;s very clear.&quot; His reference was to the clause: &quot;final legislative action in the joint session ... shall be taken only by call of the yeas and nays&quot;. He filed the lawsuit as one member of a group of private citizens on November 24, citing 5 occasions in 24 years in which the General Court failed to vote on valid initiatives. Other plaintiffs included Raymond Flynn and officials of VoteOnMarriage.org and the Catholic Action League of Massachusetts. Named as defendants were the Massachusetts Secretary of State, who oversees the preparation of election ballots, William F. Galvin, and the President of the Massachusetts Senate who chairs joint sessions of the General Court, Senator Travaglini. After a 20-minute hearing on November 30, Associate Justice Judith A. Cowin ordered an expedited hearing before the full SJC on December 20. At that hearing, both sides agreed that the SJC could not enforce an order against the General Court. An attorney for the plaintiffs said: &quot;We&#x27;re not asking you to tell the General Court how to do their business. We&#x27;re only asking you to declare what their constitutional obligations are.&quot; The First Assistant Attorney General representing the General Court countered that the voters were free to replace the legislators at the next election.

On December 27, 2006, the SJC ruled unanimously that Article 48 of the State Constitution requires legislators to take recorded votes on initiative amendments. The SJC&#x27;s opinion authored by Justice John M. Greaney said the legislators&#x27; duties were &quot;beyond serious debate&quot;, and described their constitutional obligations:

He explained that the court could take no action against the plaintiffs in the case: &quot;[T]here is no presently articulated judicial remedy for the Legislature&#x27;s indifference to, or defiance of, its constitutional duties. We have no statutory authority to issue a declaratory judgment concerning the constitutionality of the legislative action, or inaction, in this matter.&quot; VoteOnMarriage.org, which had gathered signatures on the proposal the legislators had failed to vote on, sued on December 13, asking a federal court to order them to vote or, in the absence of a vote, to order the amendment placed on the ballot. It also sought $500,000 from the 109 legislators who voted to adjourn, the cost of its signature-gathering campaign. Arline Isaacson, one of the leaders of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus, urged the General Court to adjourn without voting on the amendment. She said: &quot;We know that if the Legislature votes on the amendment, we will lose this year and next year, and it will go to the ballot, where it will likely pass.&quot; Senator Brian Lees said he thought the General Court would not be swayed by the ruling and he stood by his opposition to taking a vote: &quot;I will never vote to put a form of discrimination into the state constitution.&quot; Before the legislators met, Deval Patrick, who was due to succeed Romney as governor on January 4, 2007, said: &quot;I hope by whatever means appropriate, the constitutional convention today ends this debate. I think a vote on adjournment is a vote on the merits.&quot; The joint session of the General Court, promptly after coming to order and without debate, voted on the amendment on January 2, 2007, the last day of its 2005–2006 session. There were 62 votes in favor and 132 opposed, a sufficient number to require the amendment&#x27;s consideration at another constitutional convention. Isaacson said that the SJC ruling &quot;really tipped the scales against us.&quot;

====Constitutional convention 2007====

When the General Court met as a constitutional convention in June 2007, observers anticipated a closer vote than the previous January because of retirements and some announced changes in position. Advocates of the amendment charged that the political pressure on legislators on the part of Governor Deval Patrick and legislative leaders included job offers and trading votes on other issues. Opponents of the amendment cast the vote as one of conscience and personal rather than political lobbying. The day before the convention, the state&#x27;s four Roman Catholic bishops in a letter to legislators endorsed putting the issue to a popular vote: &quot;[T]he marriage debate should not be reserved only to lawyers and lawmakers. Every citizen has a stake in the outcome, because every citizen has a stake in the well-being of the family.&quot; Cardinal O&#x27;Malley called several legislators to lobby for their votes and Governor Patrick said he offered some help in their re-election campaigns. On June 14, 2007, the convention opened and proceeded immediately to a vote on the issue without debate. The measure failed to obtain the required 50 votes, as 45 voted in favor, 151 opposed the measure, and four were absent or abstained from the vote. Two new legislators who were thought to support the amendment voted against it, while nine who had supported it in January, seven Democrats and two Republicans, changed their votes to oppose it. VoteOnMarriage.Org announced it would attempt to unseat legislators who had switched sides to defeat the amendment.

===Marriages of non-residents===
A Massachusetts law enacted in 1913 invalidated the marriage of non-residents if the marriage was invalid in the state where they lived. Historians and legal scholars believe it originated in an upsurge of anti-miscegenation sentiment associated with the notoriety of champion boxer Jack Johnson&#x27;s marriages to white women. Though moribund for decades, it was used to prevent same-sex couples who were residents of other states from marrying in Massachusetts. As the date neared for the issuance of marriage licenses to same-sex couples, Governor Romney and some town clerks disputed how and whether that law should be enforced, and Romney had used the state&#x27;s authority to block the same-sex marriages of non-residents from being properly recorded. He told a news conference: &quot;We certainly won&#x27;t record on our public health records marriages that are on the face of them not consistent with the law&quot;. The clerks soon relented under orders from Attorney General Reilly. In June 2004, GLAD brought a lawsuit, &quot;Cote-Whitacre v. Department of Public Health&quot;, on behalf of several out-of-state same-sex couples and several town clerks who objected to being forced to discriminate in denying licenses to such couples. The SJC upheld the law on March 30, 2006, though it allowed that residents of states like New York and Vermont, which did not explicitly exclude same-sex couples from marriage, might pursue the case further. On September 29, 2006, Superior Court Justice Thomas Connolly determined that same-sex couples who reside in Rhode Island can marry in Massachusetts after finding &quot;that same-sex marriage is ... not prohibited in Rhode Island&quot;. In May 2007, Judge Connolly declared valid the marriages of several same-sex couples, residents of New York, who married in Massachusetts before July 6, 2006, when a New York court issued a ruling that same-sex marriage was not legal there, New York&#x27;s first explicit prohibition on same-sex marriage. In July 2007, the Department of Public Health ruled that same-sex couples from New Mexico, where whether the law prohibited same-sex marriage was disputed, can obtain marriage licenses in Massachusetts.

On June 15, 2007, following the defeat of the initiative to amend the State Constitution, Kris Mineau of the Massachusetts Family Institute warned that gay and lesbian activists would try to repeal the 1913 law next so that &quot;This radical social experiment will be exported to the other 49 states&quot;. He said its repeal would &quot;open the floodgates for Massachusetts to become the Mecca for same-sex marriage. Their goal is to strike down the marriage restrictions in every state. Their launching pad will be Massachusetts.&quot; Isaacson said &quot;no one is rushing&quot; to take on that issue and that &quot;In the short term, we want everyone to rest, breathe and appreciate the incredible victory that took place&quot;. Liberal columnist Ellen Goodman wrote: &quot;Las Vegas? Mecca? So far, little Rhode Island is the only state that allows gay residents to wed in Massachusetts. We are the Las Vegas of Rhode Island.&quot;

On June 30, 2008, the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, in reply to an inquiry from Daniel O&#x27;Connell, Massachusetts Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, reported that it calculated that allowing non-resident same-sex couples to marry would add $37 million to the Massachusetts economy in each of the next three years and add 330 jobs for the same period.

The Massachusetts General Court took up the repeal of the 1913 law the next month. On July 15, the Massachusetts Senate voted to repeal it on a unanimous voice vote. The House approved the legislation on July 29, 2008 on a 118 to 35 vote, and Governor Deval Patrick signed the bill into law on July 31. It took effect immediately. Patrick said: &quot;I think other states will make their own judgments, and I expect them to–that&#x27;s their own business. All we can do is tend our own garden, and make sure that it&#x27;s weeded, and I think we&#x27;ve weeded out a discriminatory law that we should have.&quot; MassResistance mounted a petition drive for a referendum to reinstate the law in October 2008, but failed to collect enough signatures.

===Recognition of legal relationships from other jurisdictions===
On July 26, 2012, in a case involving a same-sex couple who established a civil union in Vermont in 2003, the SJC ruled unanimously in &quot;Elia-Warnken v. Elia&quot; that Massachusetts recognizes a same-sex civil union established in another jurisdiction as the legal equivalent of a marriage. Chief Justice Roderick L. Ireland wrote: &quot;Refusing to recognize a legal spousal relationship that granted rights equal to those acquired through marriage, in a State that did not allow same-sex couples to marry at the time, would only perpetuate the discrimination against same-sex couples&quot; that led the court to tell the Senate in 2004 that civil unions would not suffice as an alternative to marriage for same-sex couples. The SJC took a comparable position on September 12 with respect to domestic partnerships established in other jurisdictions in a case involving a California couple, &quot;Hunter v. Rose&quot;.

===Subsequent developments===

On July 10, 2008, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled unanimously in &quot;Charron v. Amaral&quot; that a surviving partner in a same-sex relationship, that was prevented from marrying before the same-sex marriage ban was declared unconstitutional, could not sue for loss of consortium. The court ruled that its decision in &quot;Goodridge&quot; could not be applied retroactively. Previously, a lower court had granted summary judgment to the defendants.

Eleven years after legalization in Massachusetts, the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide with its &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; ruling on June 26, 2015. Several state politicians from across the political spectrum welcomed the ruling. Governor Charlie Baker said, &quot;For me, the issue of marriage equality is personal. I&#x27;m pleased the Commonwealth has already recognized same-sex marriages in our state, and with today&#x27;s Supreme Court decision every American citizen across the nation will have equal protection under the law and the right to marry the person they choose.&quot; Senator Ed Markey said, &quot;With this momentous ruling from the Supreme Court we end a chapter of discrimination in our country&#x27;s history and start a new one that says all Americans have the right to pursue happiness by marrying the person they love. Today, we raise our voices for equality. We raise our voices for an end to all forms of discrimination. We raise our voices for justice. It&#x27;s about basic freedoms for our friends, neighbors and families. Any effort to deny equal protections under the law is unfair, discriminatory, and unconstitutional – and that is just plain wrong. I am so proud to represent the state that has become a model across the country and the world on LGBT inclusion and acceptance.&quot;
In August 2023, Boston removed all mentions of sex on marriage licence forms &quot;in the hopes of offering more dignified experiences for all&quot;.

Opponents of same-sex marriage argued in 2004 that legalizing same-sex marriages would open the door to other types of relationships being recognized as marriages, including polygamy and polyamory. Supporters called this line of reasoning &quot;scare tactics&quot;. In 2020, the Somerville City Council passed an ordinance recognizing polyamorous domestic partnerships, allowing those in polyamorous relationships easier access to their partners&#x27; health insurance.

==Native American nations==
The Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe and the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head have jurisdiction over marriages and divorces performed under tribal law. As a result, it is unclear if same-sex marriage is legal on their reservations. While there are no records of same-sex marriages as understood from a Western perspective being performed in Native American cultures, there is evidence for identities and behaviours that may be placed on the LGBT spectrum. Many of these cultures recognized two-spirit individuals who were born male but wore women&#x27;s clothing and performed everyday household work and artistic handiwork which were regarded as belonging to the feminine sphere. This two-spirit status allowed for marriages between two biological males to be performed in some of these tribes. In the Massachusett language, the term for two-spirit is . 

==Marriage statistics==
In the first year, more than 6,200 same-sex couples had married in Massachusetts. That number fell to only 1,900 marriages in the second year. Out of the total of more than 8,100 marriages, 64% involved lesbian couples. In comparison, more than 36,000 heterosexual couples are married each year in Massachusetts. The number of marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples in Massachusetts leveled off at about 1,500 a year in 2006 and 2007. They represented about 4% of all marriages in the state. A total of 22,406 same-sex marriages were performed in Massachusetts from 2004 to 2012, mostly in Barnstable, Middlesex and Suffolk counties. Subtracting the first year total, an average of 2,025 marriages were performed each subsequent year. Approximately 32,000 same-sex couples had married in Massachusetts by 2024.

The 2020 U.S. census showed that there were 20,913 married same-sex couple households (9,037 male couples and 11,876 female couples) and 12,539 unmarried same-sex couple households in Massachusetts.

<text>The first USS &quot;Eagle&quot;, a schooner, was built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1798, and commissioned in the Revenue Cutter Service under the command of Captain Hugh G. Campbell, USRCS. 
==Quasi War==
She placed under control of the Navy in July 1798 for service in the undeclared naval war (Quasi-War) with France. 

From October 1798 &quot;Eagle&quot; patrolled off the coast of South Carolina and Georgia protecting American shipping from French privateers. Ordered to the West Indies, she arrived at Prince Rupert&#x27;s Bay, Dominica, 14 March 1799, to hunt French ships, and to convoy merchant vessels on the Guadeloupe Station until late in June, when she sailed for New Castle, Delaware. Sometime in early 1799 she and USRC Diligence captured French ship Reynard. On 5 April, 1799 she captured French privateer sloop &quot;Bon Pere&quot;, Bon Pere was taken into USRC Service under same name that year. In late April or before 6 May 1799, &quot; Eagle&quot;, and captured the French ship &quot;Louis&quot;.

In a letter dated 20 May, 1799 Navy Secretary Benjamin Stoddert notified the Treasury Secretary that he should consider Eagle to be officially transferred to the U.S. Navy.

Sometime just before 11 June, 1799 she and USS &quot;Baltimore&quot; captured a prize, probably French ship &quot;Siren&quot;.

On 27 July 1799 the Secretary of the Navy sent a letter with Campbell&#x27;s commission as a U.S. Navy officer, rank of master commandant.

She returned to the Caribbean in August 1799 for similar duty. In early November she recaptured a brig that was being towed by a privateer, the privateer was forced ashore but got off and got away. She later captured a French sloop, and with captured a French Letter of Marque. In December recaptured brig &quot;George&quot;. In February she recaptured schooner &quot;Benevolence&quot;. In March she recaptured schooner &quot;Three Friends&quot;. In April she captured schooner &quot;Favorite&quot;. On 2 May, 1800 captured French schooner &quot;La Magdelaine&quot; (15 tons). On 25 June, captured French merchantman &quot;Dolphin&quot;. On 10 September 1800 she set sail for St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, with the sloop-of-war , escorting a convoy of 52 ships. On unknown date she and USS Maryland recaptured brig &quot;Mahitable&quot;. After arrival at New Castle on 28 September, &quot;Eagle&quot; proceeded to Philidelphia and was laid up for repairs. On 19 November 1800 Lt. Tho. Calvert was ordered to take command of her. On 8 December 1800 Lt. M. Simmones Bunbury was ordered to take command. &quot;Eagle&#x27;s&quot; third cruise to the West Indies extended from January to June 1801, when she returned to Baltimore. 

During her career in the United States&#x27; navy, she captured or assisted in the capture of 22 French vessels which had been preying on American ocean commerce. &quot;Eagle&quot; was sold 17 June 1801 at Baltimore for $10,585.73.

<text>Richard Scurrah Wainwright (11 April 1918 – 16 January 2003) was a British politician of the Liberal Party. He was the MP for Colne Valley from 1966 to 1970, and again from 1974 to 1987.

==Early life and education==
Wainwright was born in Leeds. He was educated at Shrewsbury School He then won an open scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge (BA History, 1938). While studying for his degree he developed his interest in the Liberal Party, as a member of the Cambridge University Liberal Club.

==Early career==
After leaving university he became a Merchant Banker, but later left the profession to focus on his political aspirations. During World War II, he registered as a conscientious objector and joined the Friends&#x27; Ambulance Unit, a Quaker organisation, serving in Normandy in 1944, and Antwerp the Netherlands and Germany in 1944–46.

==Parliamentary career==
Wainwright stood as the Liberal Party candidate for the constituency of Pudsey in the general election of 1950 and again in 1955, but was unsuccessful on both occasions. In 1956 he became the Liberal candidate for Colne Valley. Standing there as a Liberal in 1959, the 1963 by-election, and 1964, he increased his vote each time until he finally gained the seat in 1966. At the following election in 1970 he was defeated by the Labour Party&#x27;s David Clark but regained the seat at the February 1974 election. He retained his seat until his retirement at the 1987 general election.

In 1953, Wainwright was elected to the executive of the Liberal Party and served as its Chairman between 1970 and 1972. His particular areas of interest were employment, trade and public finance. From 1961 he concentrated his work at Liberal headquarters on local government. He was a central spokesman for the Liberal Party on finance and represented his party on the Finance Bill Committee in 1968, trade and industry, the economy (1966–1970, 1979–1985) and employment (1985–1987). He was the chairman of the Liberal Party Research Department (1968–1970). After 1974 Wainwright focused on the financial management of the party.

==Outside Parliament==
After 1987, although retired as an MP, Wainwright continued to be politically active, working for the Electoral Reform Society, as well as being a founding member of the executive committee of Charter 88. Between 1986 and 1997 he was also Deputy Chairman of the Wider Share Ownership Council. When the Liberal Party merged with the Social Democratic Party to become the Liberal Democrats, Wainwright became a member working as President of the Yorkshire Federation of Liberal Democrats (1989–1997).

Wainwright was a Methodist lay preacher. Between 1948 and 1958, he served on the Leeds Group B Hospital Management Committee and was Chairman of the Arthington Hospital and Thorp Arch Hospital Committees. He served on the Committee for the Leeds, Skyrac and Morley Savings Bank Board of Managers and the Leeds Library Committee. Further roles included Treasurer of the Leeds Invalid Children&#x27;s Aid Society and the Bethany House Free Church Probation Home. Between 1959 and 1984, he was a member of the Joseph Rowntree Social Services Trust Limited (now the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust). He was also made a Fellow of the Huddersfield Polytechnic (later the University of Huddersfield) in 1988.

==Personal life==
His wife Joyce (née Hollis; died 4 February 2011), whom he married in 1948, was an active member of the Yorkshire Women&#x27;s Liberal Federation, fulfilling roles as both Chairman and President, and Chairman of the Colne Valley Women&#x27;s Liberal Council (1959–1987). She was also a member of the Executive of the national Women&#x27;s Liberal Federation. The couple had four children, two of whom entered public life: their son Martin is a former Northern Editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, and their daughter Hilary is a radical academic and editor of &quot;Red Pepper&quot; magazine.

Wainwright died in Leeds on 16 January 2003, aged 84. The former offices of Greg Mulholland, who was Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West from 2005 to 2017, were named &#x27;Richard Wainwright House&#x27; in his honour.

<doc id="661049" wikidata="Q4548713" url="?curid=661049" title="12 Golden Country Greats">
<text>12 Golden Country Greats is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Ween, and their third on Elektra Records. It is the only album on which the group limited themselves to a specific genre of music (in this case, country music).

==Background and recording==
According to producer and friend of the band Ben Vaughn, Ween asked him to produce the album because he already had experience working with musicians in the Nashville country scene, having produced Arthur Alexander&#x27;s album &quot;Lonely Just Like Me&quot; (1993) and co-written songs with Rodney Crowell and Gary Nicholson. The legendary Bradley&#x27;s Barn was chosen as the recording studio for the album.

Some musicians, such as keyboardist Bobby Emmons (who also served as a church deacon) and Danny Davis, declined to participate in the recording due to the vulgar nature of much of the lyrics, with Emmons saying &quot;I prefer not to work on blue material&quot;. However, Ween and Vaughn still got many highly regarded country musicians to play on the album. Later, Ween assembled some of the session musicians again into a touring band dubbed The Shit Creek Boys.

==Album title==
Despite the album&#x27;s title, it only features ten tracks. Ween claimed that the &quot;12&quot; represents the veteran musicians that appear on the record.

However, the band did indeed record twelve songs during the demo sessions for the album. When it came time to record the actual album, the band chose not to use the songs &quot;I Got No Darkside&quot; and &quot;So Long, Jerry&quot; but kept the album title. &quot;So Long, Jerry&quot;, a tribute to the then recently deceased Jerry Garcia, was featured as a B-Side on the &quot;Piss Up a Rope&quot; single.

==Song information==
The session musicians were responsible for almost all of the instrumentation on the album. The only instrumental parts recorded by the core members of Ween were guitar solos by Dean and Gene on &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Leave You on the Farm&quot; and &quot;Fluffy&quot;, respectively.

Gene sings the lead vocal part on every song except &quot;Piss Up a Rope&quot; and &quot;Help Me Scrape the Mucus off My Brain&quot;, which feature Dean on lead vocals. The Jordanaires, best known for having provided background vocals for Elvis Presley, appear on the tracks &quot;I&#x27;m Holding You&quot; and &quot;Powder Blue&quot;.

The melody of &quot;Japanese Cowboy&quot; closely resembles that of &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; by Vangelis. The band has played the two songs as a medley in live shows.

In the tradition of country music, during &quot;Powder Blue&quot;, Gene introduces each member of the band, who then plays a short solo on their instrument. The track was intended to run for 4:16, the last approximately one minute of which would consist of an audio clip of Muhammad Ali from after the Rumble in the Jungle fight playing over the backing instrumental track of the song. Ali&#x27;s lawyers denied Ween permission to use the audio sample, but the album had already been mixed by that point, and Elektra accidentally initially pressed the album with Ali&#x27;s speech still included. Repressings contain a cropped version of the track that ends abruptly at 3:13, after the introduction: &quot;Ladies &amp; Gentlemen, I&#x27;d like to present Muhammad Ali&quot; (who is no longer heard).

&quot;Help Me Scrape the Mucus off My Brain&quot; is a riff on Merle Haggard&#x27;s &quot;If We Make It Through December&quot;, featuring a nearly identical melody, but played much faster than Haggard&#x27;s more somber original.

==Singles==
&quot;Piss Up a Rope&quot; was released as a 7-inch vinyl single on Diesel Only Records. The B-side was &quot;Sweet Texas Fire&quot;, a non-album track recorded during the &quot;Chocolate &amp; Cheese&quot; sessions.

&quot;You Were the Fool&quot; and &quot;Piss Up a Rope&quot; were released together as a 7-inch vinyl single on Flying Nun Records (with &quot;You Were the Fool&quot; on &quot;Side A&quot; and &quot;Piss Up a Rope&quot; on &quot;Side AA&quot;). &quot;So Long Jerry&quot; (a tribute to Jerry Garcia recorded during the &quot;12 Golden Country Greats&quot; sessions, but omitted from the final album) was included with these songs on a CD single issued by Elektra.

==Reception==

Reviews for the album were mostly positive. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called it &quot;as satisfying as any of their records, and gutsier, too&quot;, despite interpreting &quot;Mister Richard Smoker&quot; as being homophobic, and awarded the album 4 stars out of 5. Sputnikmusic&#x27;s Zachary Powell gave the album stars out of 5 and claimed that &quot;Writing songs about similar themes to what country songs have been written about but including their personal brown touch is what the band does best.&quot; Another writer for the same site, Bill Thomas, gave the album 4 stars out of 5. Ethan Smith of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, on the other hand, railed against the album, describing the songs as being &quot;notable more for their homophobia, misogyny, and racism than for anything funny&quot;, and gave it a C−.

In a 2011 interview, producer Ben Vaughn remarked that, when the album was released, many Ween fans were confused by the radical break with the band&#x27;s previous sound, comparing it to the fan reception given to Neil Young&#x27;s album &quot;Trans&quot;.

<doc id="661052" wikidata="Q315780" url="?curid=661052" title="Stan Kenton">
<text>Stanley Newcomb Kenton (December 15, 1911 – August 25, 1979) was an American popular music and jazz artist. As a pianist, composer, arranger and band leader, he led an innovative and influential jazz orchestra for almost four decades. Though Kenton had several pop hits from the early 1940s into the 1960s, his music was always forward-looking. Kenton was also a pioneer in the field of jazz education, creating the Stan Kenton Jazz Camp in 1959 at Indiana University.

==Early life==
Stan Kenton was born on December 15, 1911, in Wichita, Kansas; he had two sisters (Beulah and Erma Mae) born three and eight years after him, respectively. His parents, Floyd and Stella Kenton, moved the family to Colorado, and in 1924, to the Greater Los Angeles Area, settling in suburban Bell, California.

Kenton attended Bell High School; his high-school yearbook picture has the prophetic notation &quot;Old Man Jazz&quot;. Kenton started learning piano as a teen from a local pianist and organist. When he was around 15 and in high school, pianist and arranger Ralph Yaw introduced him to the music of Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines. He graduated from high school in 1930.

By the age of 16, Kenton was already playing a regular solo piano gig at a local hamburger eatery for 50 cents a night plus tips; during that time he had his own performing group named &quot;The Bell-Tones&quot;. His first arrangement was written during this time for a local eight-piece band that played in nearby Long Beach.

==Career==
===1930s===
With little money, Kenton traveled to speakeasys in San Diego and Las Vegas playing piano. By 1932 he was playing with the Francis Gilbert Territory band and would tour through Arizona; he would go on to working with the Everett Hoagland Orchestra in 1933, which would be his first time playing at the Rendezvous Ballroom. He would then play with Russ Plummer, Hal Grayson and eventually got his big break with Gus Arnheim.

In April 1936, Arnheim was reorganizing his band into the style of Benny Goodman&#x27;s groups and Kenton was to take the piano chair. This is where Kenton would make his first recordings when Arnheim made 14 sides for the Brunswick label in summer of 1937. Once he departed from Gus Arnheim&#x27;s group, Kenton went back to study with private teachers on both the piano and in composition. In 1938 Kenton would join Vido Musso in a short-lived band, but a very educational experience for him.

From the core of this group came the lineup of the first Stan Kenton groups of the 1940s. Kenton would also go on to working with the NBC House Band and in various Hollywood studios and clubs. Producer George Avakian took notice of Kenton during this time while he worked as the pianist and Assistant Musical Director at the Earl Carroll Theatre Restaurant in Hollywood. Kenton started to get the idea of running his own band from this experience; he created a rehearsal band of his own, which eventually become his group in the 1940s.

===1940s===

In 1940, Kenton formed his first orchestra. Kenton worked in the early days with his own groups as much more of an arranger than a featured pianist. Although there were no &quot;name&quot; musicians in his first band (with the possible exception of bassist Howard Rumsey and trumpeter Chico Alvarez), Kenton spent the summer of 1941 playing regularly before an audience at the Rendezvous Ballroom on the Balboa Peninsula at Newport Beach, CA. Influenced by Benny Carter and Jimmie Lunceford, the Stan Kenton Orchestra struggled for a time after its initial success. Its Decca recordings were not big sellers and a stint as Bob Hope&#x27;s backup radio band during the 1943–44 season was an unhappy experience; Les Brown permanently took Kenton&#x27;s place.

 Kenton&#x27;s first appearance in New York was in February 1942 at the Roseland Ballroom, with the marquee featuring an endorsement by Fred Astaire. By late 1943, with a contract with the newly formed Capitol Records, a popular record in &quot;Eager Beaver&quot;, and growing recognition, the Stan Kenton Orchestra was gradually catching on; it developed into one of the best-known West Coast ensembles of the 1940s. Its soloists during the war years included Art Pepper, briefly Stan Getz, altoist Boots Mussulli, and singer Anita O&#x27;Day. By 1945, the band had evolved. The songwriter Joe Greene provided the lyrics for hit songs like &quot;And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Catch You Cryin&#x27;&quot;. Pete Rugolo became the chief arranger (extending Kenton&#x27;s ideas), Bob Cooper and Vido Musso offered very different tenor styles, and June Christy was Kenton&#x27;s new singer; her hits (including &quot;Tampico&quot; and Greene&#x27;s &quot;Across the Alley from the Alamo&quot;) made it possible for Kenton to finance his more ambitious projects.

====Artistry in Rhythm====
 When composer/arranger Pete Rugolo joined the Stan Kenton Orchestra as staff arranger in late 1945 he brought with him his love of jazz, Stravinsky and Bartók. Given free rein by Kenton, Rugolo experimented. Although Kenton himself was already trying experimental scores prior to Rugolo&#x27;s tenure, it was Rugolo who brought extra jazz and classical influences much needed to move the band forward artistically.

During his first six months on the staff, Rugolo tried to copy Kenton&#x27;s sound; on encouragement from the leader he explored his own voice. By incorporating compositional techniques borrowed from the modern classical music he studied, Rugolo was a key part of one of Kenton&#x27;s most fertile and creative periods.

After a string of mostly arrangements, Rugolo turned out three originals that Kenton featured on the band&#x27;s first album in 1946 (&quot;Artistry in Rhythm&quot;): &quot;Artistry in Percussion&quot;, &quot;Safranski&quot; and &quot;Artistry in Bolero&quot;. Added to this mix came &quot;Machito&quot;, &quot;Rhythm Incorporated&quot;, &quot;Monotony&quot;, and &quot;Interlude&quot; in early 1947 (although some were not recorded until later in the year). These compositions, along with June Christy&#x27;s voice, came to define the &quot;Artistry in Rhythm&quot; band. Afro-Cuban writing was added to the Kenton book with compositions like Rugolo&#x27;s &quot;Machito&quot;. The resulting instrumentation, utilizing significant amounts of brass, was described as a &quot;wall of sound&quot; (a term later coined independently by Andrew Loog Oldham for Phil Spector&#x27;s production methods).

The &quot;Artistry in Rhythm&quot; ensemble was a formative band, with outstanding soloists. By early 1947, the Stan Kenton Orchestra had reached a high point of financial and popular success. They played in the best theaters and ballrooms in America and had numerous hit records. Dances at the ballrooms were typically four hours a night and theater dates generally involved playing mini-concerts between each showing of the movie. This was sometimes five or six a day, stretching from morning to late night. Most days not actually playing were spent in buses or cars. Days off from performing were rare. For Kenton they just allowed for more record signing, radio station interviews, and advertising for Capitol Records. Due to the financial and personal demands, following an April performance in Tuscaloosa, he broke up the &quot;Artistry in Rhythm&quot; incarnation of Kenton ensembles.

==== Progressive Jazz ====
After a hiatus of five months, Kenton formed a new, larger ensemble to present &quot;Concerts in Progressive Jazz&quot;. Sustaining the ensemble on its own proved mostly attainable but the band still had to fill in its schedule by booking dances and movie theater jobs, especially over the summer.

Pete Rugolo composed and arranged the great bulk of the new music; Kenton declared these works to be &quot;Progressive Jazz.&quot; A student of famed composer and educator Russ Garcia, Bob Graettinger wrote numerous works for the band, starting with his composition &quot;Thermopylae.&quot; His ground-breaking composition &quot;City of Glass&quot; was premiered by the band in Chicago in April 1948, but not recorded for another two and a half years, in a reworked version for the Innovations Orchestra. Ken Hanna, who began the tour as a trumpet player, contributed a few compositions to the new band, including &quot;Somnambulism&quot;. Kenton contributed no new scores to the &quot;Progressive Jazz&quot; band, although several of his older works were performed on concerts, including &quot;Concerto to End All Concertos&quot;, &quot;Eager Beaver&quot;, &quot;Opus in Pastels&quot;, and &quot;Artistry in Rhythm&quot;.

Cuban inflected titles from the &quot;Progressive Jazz&quot; period include Rugolo&#x27;s &quot;Introduction to a Latin Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Cuban Carnival&quot;, &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot;, &quot;Journey to Brazil&quot;, and Bob Graettinger&#x27;s &quot;Cuban Pastorale&quot;. The addition of a full-time bongo player and a Brazilian guitarist in the band enabled Kenton&#x27;s cadre of composers to explore Afro-Latin rhythms to far greater possibilities.

The &quot;Progressive Jazz&quot; period lasted 14 months, beginning on September 24, 1947, when the Stan Kenton Orchestra played a concert at the Rendezvous Ballroom. And it ended after the last show at the Paramount Theatre in New York City on December 14, 1948. The band produced only one album and a handful of singles, due to a recording ban by the American Federation of Musicians that lasted the entirety of 1948.

The lone record, &quot;A Presentation of Progressive Jazz&quot;, received a 3 out of 4 rating from Tom Herrick in &quot;DownBeat&quot;. Metronome rated it &quot;C&quot; calling it a &quot;jerry-built jumble of effects and counter-effects&quot; and &quot;this album presents very little that can justifiably be called either jazz or progressive&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; scored it 80 out of 100, but declared it &quot;as mumbo-jumbo a collection of cacophony as has ever been loosed on an unsuspecting public.

Many sidemen from the &quot;Artistry&quot; band returned, but there were significant changes. Laurindo Almeida on classical guitar, and Jack Costanzo on bongos dramatically changed the band&#x27;s timbre. Both were firsts for the Kenton band, or any jazz band for that matter. The rhythm section included returnees Eddie Safranski (bass) and Shelly Manne (drums), both destined to win first place Down Beat awards.

Four of the five trumpet players returned: Buddy Childers, Ray Wetzel, Chico Alvarez, and Ken Hanna. Al Porcino was added to the already powerhouse section. Conte Candoli joined the band, replacing Porcino, in February 1948.

Kai Winding, star trombonist of the &quot;Artistry in Rhythm&quot; band, would not be a part of the &quot;Progressive Jazz&quot; era, except for a few dates on which he subbed. Milt Bernhart came in on lead trombone. And Bart Varsalona returned on bass trombone. Bernhart&#x27;s first big solo with the Kenton band proved to be a major hit, &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot;.

The saxophone section was much improved and modernized. Returning saxophonists included baritone Bob Gioga, holding down his chair since the very start, and Bob Cooper on tenor. With Vido Musso&#x27;s departure, Cooper and his modernist sound became the featured tenor soloist. Art Pepper came on as second alto, the &quot;jazz&quot; chair. And the new lead alto was George Weidler.

This was genuinely a band of all-stars. They received five first place awards in the Down Beat poll at the end of 1947, and similar awards from the other magazines. The arrangers continued to push the limits of these superb instrumentalists in their compositions. Works from this period are more sophisticated than those written for the &quot;Artistry&quot; band, and are some of the first and most successful &quot;third stream&quot; compositions.

The band criss-crossed the country, appearing in the nation&#x27;s top concert venues, including Carnegie Hall, Boston Symphony Hall, Chicago Civic Opera House, Academy of Music (Philadelphia), and the Hollywood Bowl. They had extended stays at New York&#x27;s Paramount Theatre and Hotel Commodore, Philadelphia&#x27;s Click, Detroit&#x27;s Eastwood Gardens, Radio City Theater in Minneapolis, and the Rendezvous Ballroom, a special place in Kenton&#x27;s musical life.

Kenton&#x27;s band was the first to present a concert in the famous outdoor arena, the Hollywood Bowl. His concert there on June 12, 1948, drew more than 15,000 people, and was both an artistic and commercial success. Kenton pocketed half of the box office, walking away with US$13,000 () for the evening&#x27;s concert.

The band broke attendance records all across the country. Thanks to Kenton&#x27;s public relations acumen, he was able to convince concert goers and record buyers of the importance of his music. Comedy numbers and June Christy vocals helped break up the seriousness of the new music.

Kenton&#x27;s successes did not sit well with everyone. In an essay entitled &quot;Economics and Race in Jazz&quot;, Leslie B. Rout Jr. wrote: Rout contrasted this with the relative lack of critical and public recognition for another leading jazz artist: 

At the end of 1948, as the band was fulfilling an extended engagement at the Paramount Theater in New York City, the leader notified his sidemen, his bookers, and the press, that he would be disbanding once more. Kenton&#x27;s most artistically and commercially successful band ceased to be at the top of their game. On December 14, 1948, the Stan Kenton Orchestra played their last notes for more than a year. They would return with new faces, new music, and a string section.

===1950s===
After a year&#x27;s hiatus, in 1950 Kenton assembled the large 39-piece Innovations in Modern Music Orchestra that included 16 strings, a woodwind section, and two French horns. The music was an extension of the works composed and recorded since 1947 by Bob Graettinger, Manny Albam, Franklyn Marks and others. Name jazz musicians such as Maynard Ferguson, Shorty Rogers, Milt Bernhart, John Graas, Art Pepper, Bud Shank, Bob Cooper, Laurindo Almeida, Shelly Manne, and June Christy were part of these musical ensembles. The groups managed two tours during 1950–51, from a commercial standpoint it would be Stan Kenton&#x27;s first major failure. Kenton soon reverted to a more standard 19-piece lineup.

In order to be more commercially viable, Kenton reformed the band in 1951 to a much more standard instrumentation: five saxes, five trombones, five trumpets, piano, guitar, bass, drums. The charts of such arrangers as Gerry Mulligan, Johnny Richards, and particularly Bill Holman and Bill Russo began to dominate the repertoire. The music was written to better reflect the style of cutting edge, be-bop oriented big bands, such as those of Dizzy Gillespie or Woody Herman. Young, talented players and outstanding jazz soloists such as Maynard Ferguson, Lee Konitz, Conte Candoli, Sal Salvador, and Frank Rosolino made strong contributions to the level of the 1952–53 band. The music composed and arranged during this time was far more tailor-made to contemporary jazz tastes; the 1953 album &quot;New Concepts of Artistry in Rhythm&quot; is noted as one of the high points in Kenton&#x27;s career as band leader. Though the band was to have a very strong &quot;concert book&quot;, Kenton also made sure the dance book was made new, fresh and contemporary. The album &quot;Sketches on Standards&quot; from 1953 is an excellent example of Kenton appealing to a wider audience while using the band and Bill Russo&#x27;s arranging skills to their fullest potential. Even though the personnel changed rather rapidly, Kenton&#x27;s focus was very clear on where he would lead things musically. By this time producer Lee Gillette worked well in concert with Kenton to create a balanced set of recordings that were both commercially viable and cutting edge musically.

Arguably the most &quot;swinging&quot; band Kenton was to field came when drummer Mel Lewis joined the orchestra in 1954. Kenton&#x27;s &quot;Contemporary Concepts&quot; (1955) and &quot;Kenton in Hi-Fi&quot; (1956) albums during this time are very impressive as a be-bop recording and then a standard dance recording (respectively). &quot;Kenton in Hi-Fi&quot;&#x27;s wide popularity and sales benefited from the fact it was his greatest hits of ten years earlier re-recorded in stereo with a contemporary, much higher level band. The album climbed all the way up to #22 on the Billboard album charts and provided much needed revenue at a time when Rock n Roll had started to become the dominant pop music in the United States. It would become more and more difficult for Kenton to alternate between &#x27;dance&#x27; and serious &#x27;jazz&#x27; albums while staying financially solvent.

During the summer of 1955 (July–September), Kenton was to become the host of the CBS television series &quot;Music 55.&quot; While it offered 10 weeks of great exposure to a rapidly expanding television audience, the show failed. It was plagued by poor production techniques and a strange combination of guests that did not work well with what Kenton had envisioned. He ended up being stiff and out of place with what the producers tried to achieve. Kenton had to burn the candle at both ends, flying in to do the show and then flying back to meet his band on the road. The New York production team was limited to using an American Federation of Musicians roster of local players; Kenton wanted his own band to do the show. There would be another attempt for the Kenton organization to place the band on regularly scheduled television programming in 1958. After six Kenton-financed episodes on KTTV in Los Angeles, there would be no sponsors to step up and back the show.
One of the standout projects and recordings for the mid-1950s band is the &quot;Cuban Fire!&quot; album released in 1956. Though Stan Kenton had recorded earlier hits such as &quot;The Peanut Vendor&quot; in 1947 with Latin percussionist Machito, as well as many other Latin flavored singles, the &quot;Cuban Fire!&quot; suite and LP stands as a watershed set of compositions for Johnny Richards&#x27; career and an outstanding commercial/artistic achievement for the Kenton orchestra, and a singular landmark in large ensemble Latin jazz recordings. &quot;CUBAN FIRE is completely authentic, the way it combines big-band jazz with genuine Latin-American rhythms.&quot; The success of the &quot;Cuban Fire!&quot; album can be gauged in part by the immediate ascent of Johnny Richards&#x27; star after its release; he was suddenly offered a contract by Bethlehem Records to record what would be the first of several recordings with his own groups.

At one point, Kenton faced a controversy in 1956 with comments he made when the band returned from a European tour. The current Critics Poll in &quot;Down Beat&quot; was now dominated by African-American musicians in virtually every category. The Kenton band was playing in Ontario, Canada, at the time, and Kenton dispatched a telegram which lamented &quot;a new minority, white jazz musicians&quot;, and stated his &quot;disgust [with the so-called] literary geniuses of jazz&quot;. Jazz critic Leonard Feather responded in the October 3, 1956, issue of &quot;Down Beat&quot; with an open letter that questioned Kenton&#x27;s racial views. Feather implied that Kenton&#x27;s failure to win the Critics Poll was probably the real reason for the complaint, and wondered if racial prejudice was involved. Less than 2% of the more than 600 sidemen with the Kenton band were African American.

By the end of the decade Kenton was with the last incarnation of a 19-piece, 1950s-style Kenton orchestra. Many bands have been called a leader&#x27;s &quot;best&quot;; this last Kenton 1959 incarnation of the 1950s bands may very well be the best. The group would pull off one of Kenton&#x27;s most artistic, subtle and introspective recordings, &quot;Standards in Silhouette.&quot; As trombonist Archie LeCoque recalled of this album of very slow ballads, &quot;...it was hard, but at the time we were all young and straight-ahead, we got through it and (two) albums came out well.&quot; By 1959 Stereophonic sound recording was now being fully utilized with all major labels. One of the great triumphs of the &quot;Standards in Silhouette&quot; album is the mature writing, the combination of the room used, a live group with very few overdubs, and the recording being in full stereo fidelity (and later remastered to digital). Bill Mathieu was highly skeptical of the decision to record his music like &quot;Cuban Fire!&quot; in a cavernous ballroom. Mathieu adds: &quot;Stan and producer Lee Gillette were absolutely right: the band sounds alive and awake (which is not easy when recording many hours of slow-tempo music in a studio), and most importantly, the players could hear themselves well in the live room. The end result is the band sounds strong and cohesive, and the album is well recorded.&quot; This is the last set of studio dates before Kenton would retool the entire orchestra in 1960.

===1960s===
The Kenton orchestra had been on a slow decline in sales and popularity in the late 1950s with having to compete with newer, popular music artists such as Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin, and The Platters. The nadir of this decline was around 1958 and coincided with a recession that was affecting the entire country. There were far fewer big bands on the road and live music venues were hard to book for the Kenton orchestra. The band would end 1959 beaten up by poor attendance at concerts and having to rely far more on dance halls than real jazz concerts. The band would reform in 1960 with a new look, a new sound, a larger group with a &#x27;mellophonium&#x27; section added and an upsurge in Kenton&#x27;s popularity.

The new instrument was used by Kenton to &quot;bridge the gap&quot; in range, color, and tonality between his trumpet and trombone sections. Essentially it creates a conical, midrange sound that is common in a symphonic setting with a horn (French horn) but the bell of the instrument faces forward. Kenton&#x27;s 1961 recording &quot;The Romantic Approach&quot; for Capitol is the first of 11 LPs that would feature the &quot;mellophonium band&quot;. Kenton arranged the whole first mellophonium album himself and it was very well received in a September 1961 review in &quot;Down Beat&quot;.
The Kenton Orchestra from 1960 to 1963 had numerous successes; the band had a relentless recording schedule. The albums &quot;Kenton&#x27;s West Side Story&quot; (arrangements by Johnny Richards) and &quot;Adventures In Jazz&quot;, each won Grammy awards in 1962 and 1963 respectively. Ralph Carmichael wrote a superb set of Christmas charts for Kenton which translated into one of the most popular recordings from the band leader to date: &quot;A Merry Christmas!.&quot; Also, Johnny Richards&#x27; &quot;Adventures in Time&quot; suite (recorded in 1962) was the culmination of all things the mellophonium band was capable of. After the Fall 1963 U.S./U.K. tour ended in November, the mellophonium incarnation of Kenton bands was done. The conditions of Stan&#x27;s divorce from jazz singer Ann Richards was that a judge ordered Stan to take a year off the road to help raise their two children or lose custody altogether. Kenton would not reform another road band for tour until 1965.

Kenton had ties from earlier writing of country/western songs that were a success with Capitol and again he tried his hand in that genre during the early 1960s. In a music market that was becoming increasingly tight, in 1962 he cut the hit single &quot;Mama Sang a Song&quot;; his last Top-40 ( 32 &quot;Billboard&quot;, No. 22 Music Vendor). The song was a narration written by country singer Bill Anderson and spoken by Kenton. The single also received a Grammy nomination the following year in the Best Documentary or Spoken Word Recording category. The other attempt he made into that market was the far less successful &quot;Stan Kenton! Tex Ritter!&quot;, released in 1962 as a full LP.

After the breakup of the mellophonium band, &quot;Kenton / Wagner&quot; (1964) was an important recording project that Kenton himself arranged, again moving towards &quot;progressive jazz&quot; or third stream music. This album was not a financial success but kept Kenton at the forefront of &#x27;art music&#x27; interpretation in the commercial music world. &quot;Stan Kenton Conducts the Los Angeles Neophonic Orchestra&quot; (1965) was an artistic success that garnered another Grammy nomination for the band leader. During this time Kenton also co-wrote the theme music for the short lived NBC television series &quot;Mister Roberts&quot; (1965–66).

The 1966–1969 Capitol releases for Stan Kenton were a severe low point for his recording career. Capitol producer Lee Gillette was trying to exploit the money making possibilities of numerous popular hits to include the 1968 musical &quot;Hair&quot; featuring contemporary rock music. Due to lack of promotion by Capitol, four LPs were financial failures; this would be the last releases for Kenton under the aegis of long time Kenton producer Lee Gillette and Capitol. In fact, by the time it was recorded Kenton had no involvement in the &quot;Hair&quot; LP except for Kenton&#x27;s name placed on the jacket cover; Ralph Carmichael and Lennie Niehaus were placed in charge of the project. Two exceptions to this late 1960s period are the Billboard charted single the band cut of the &quot;Dragnet&quot; theme (1967) and another &quot;Kenton presents&quot; release featuring the music of composer and ex-bandsman Dee Barton: &quot;The Jazz Compositions of Dee Barton&quot; (1967). The album featuring Barton&#x27;s music was another unsung artistic success for the Kenton band though widely unseen commercially by the a music listening public.

===1970s===
The transition from Capitol to Creative World Records in 1970 was fraught with difficulties during a time when the music business was changing rapidly. As a viable jazz artist who was trying to keep a loyal but dwindling following, Kenton turned to arrangers such as Hank Levy and Bob Curnow to write material that appealed to a younger audience. The first releases for the Creative World label were live concerts and Kenton had the control he wanted over content but lacked substantial resources to engineer, mix, and promote what Capitol underwrote in the past. Kenton would take a big gamble to bypass the current record industry and rely far more on the direct mail lists of jazz fans which the newly formed Creative World label would need to sell records. Kenton also made his print music available to college and high-school stage bands with several publishers. Kenton continued leading and touring with his big band up to his final performance on August 20, 1978, when he disbanded the group due to his failing health.
In June 1973 Bob Curnow had started as the new artists and repertoire manager overseeing the whole operation of the Creative World Records. It was just the year before (in 1972) the Kenton orchestra recorded the &quot;National Anthems of the World&quot; double LP with 40 arrangements all done by Curnow. As per Curnow himself: 

When Kenton took to the road during the early 1970s (one in London in 1972) and up to his last tour, he took with him seasoned veteran musicians (John Worster, Willie Maiden, Warren Gale, Graham Ellis, and others) teaming them with relatively unknown young artists, and new arrangements (including those by Hank Levy, Bill Holman, Bob Curnow, Willie Maiden, and Ken Hanna) were used. Many alumni associated with Kenton from this era became educators (Mike Vax, John Von Ohlen, Chuck Carter, Lisa Hittle, and Richard Torres), and a few went on to take their musical careers to the next level, such as Peter Erskine, Douglas Purviance, and Tim Hagans.

==Timeline of Stan Kenton Orchestras==
===Legacy===
Kenton was a significant figure on the American musical scene and made an indelible mark on the arranged type of big band jazz. Kenton&#x27;s music evolved with the times from 1940 through the 1970s. He was at the vanguard of promoting jazz and jazz improvisation through his service as an educator through his Stan Kenton Band Clinics. The &quot;Kenton Style&quot; continues to permeate big bands at the high school and collegiate level, and the framework he designed for the &quot;jazz clinic&quot; is still widely in use today.

Starting in the waning days of the big band era, Kenton found many ways to progress his art form. In his hands the size of the jazz orchestra expanded greatly, at times exceeding forty musicians. The frequency range (high and low notes) was also increased with the use of bass trombones and tuba, and baritone and bass saxophones. The dynamic range was pushed on both ends; the band could play softer and louder than any other big band. Kenton was the primary band leader responsible for moving the big band from the dance hall to the concert hall; one of the most important and successful players in the Third Stream movement.

Interest in his music has experienced somewhat of a resurgence, with critical &quot;rediscovery&quot; of his music and many reissues of his recordings. An alumni band named for him tours, led by lead trumpeter Mike Vax, which performs not only classic Kenton arrangements, but also new music written and performed by the band members (much like Kenton&#x27;s own groups). Kenton donated his entire library to the music library of North Texas State University (now the University of North Texas), and the Stan Kenton Jazz Recital Hall was named in his honor, although has recently been changed due to concerns over his history of sexual misconduct. His arrangements are now published by Sierra Music Publications.

When compared with the four longest running touring jazz orchestras (Stan Kenton, Woody Herman, Count Basie, and Duke Ellington), Kenton&#x27;s band had the highest turnover of personnel: Bob Gioga, Buddy Childers, and Dick Shearer are among only the few who played for Kenton for over a decade. Other important soloists such as Lennie Niehaus, Bill Perkins and Chico Alvarez had lengthy stays on the band as well. The &quot;full&quot; list of notable jazz players, studio musicians, et al. who served a stint is in itself impressive, as is the consistency of the group as a going concern from 1941 right until the decade of Kenton&#x27;s death in 1979. Kenton&#x27;s leadership and musical vision marshalled the numerous forces of an evolving and transient diverse set of players and arrangers for nearly four decades.

==Personal life==
Kenton&#x27;s birth certificate stated that he was born on December 15, 1911, according to British biographer Michael Sparke.

Kenton was conceived out of wedlock, and his parents told him that he was born on February 19, 1912, two months later than the actual date, to obscure this fact. Kenton believed well into adulthood that the February date was his birthday, and recorded the &quot;Birthday In Britain&quot; concert album on February 19, 1973.

The true date remained secret, and his grave marker shows the incorrect February birthdate.

Kenton was married three times. He had three children from the first two marriages. His first marriage was to Violet Rhoda Peters in 1935 and lasted 15 years. The couple had a daughter in 1941, Leslie. In her 2010 memoir &quot;Love Affair&quot;, Leslie Kenton wrote that, from 1952 to 1954 when she was between the ages of 11 and 13, her father sexually abused her. She nonetheless maintained a close relationship with him, though she states that she was emotionally scarred by the experience. She said that the abuse happened when he was drunk. 20 years later he apologized.

In 1955, Stan Kenton married San Diego-born singer Ann Richards, who was 23 years his junior. They had two children. In 1961, Richards posed for a nude layout in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine&#x27;s June 1961 issue. She signed a contract to record with Atco Records, without her husband&#x27;s knowledge. The &quot;Playboy&quot; shoot was done without Kenton&#x27;s knowledge; he found out about it while playing at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago when handed the magazine by Charles Suter, who was the editor of &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine at the time. Richards was not typically on the road with the band, though she had recorded the album &quot;Two Much!&quot; with Kenton in 1960. Richards filed for divorce in August 1961; it was finalized in 1962. He retained custody of their two children.

Kenton&#x27;s third marriage was to KABC production assistant Jo Ann Hill, in 1967. This also ended in a separation in 1969 with the divorce following in 1970.

In his later years he lived with his public relations secretary and last business manager, Audree Coke Kenton, though they never married.

Kenton&#x27;s heavy consumption of alcohol contributed to frequent accidents and the physical difficulties he encountered during the last 10 years of his life.

Kenton&#x27;s son Lance became a member of the controversial Synanon new-age community in California, and served as one of its &quot;Imperial Marines&quot;, a group entrusted with committing violence against former members and others considered enemies of the community. In 1978 he was arrested for helping to put a rattlesnake in the mailbox of an anti-Synanon lawyer, and was sentenced to a year in prison.

Kenton had two serious falls, one in the early 1970s and one in May 1977 whilst on tour in Reading, Pennsylvania, the second of which fractured his skull. On August 17, 1979, he was admitted to Midway Hospital near his home in Los Angeles after a stroke; he died eight days later, on August 25. Kenton was interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery, Los Angeles.

==Compositions==

Stan Kenton&#x27;s compositions include &quot;Artistry in Rhythm&quot;, released as V-Disc No. 285B, &quot;Opus in Pastels&quot;, &quot;Artistry Jumps&quot;, &quot;Reed Rapture&quot;, &quot;Eager Beaver&quot;, released on V-Disc 285B, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Southern Scandal&quot;, which was released as V-Disc No. 573B, &quot;Monotony&quot;, released as V-Disc No. 854B, in 1948, with a spoken introduction by Kenton, &quot;Harlem Folk Dance&quot;, &quot;Painted Rhythm&quot;, &quot;Concerto to End All Concertos&quot;, &quot;Easy Go&quot;, &quot;Concerto for Doghouse&quot;, &quot;Shelly Manne&quot;, &quot;Balboa Bash&quot;, &quot;Flamenco&quot;, and &quot;Sunset Tower&quot;.

Many compositions are collaborations between Stan Kenton and Pete Rugolo, such as &quot;Artistry in Boogie&quot;, &quot;Collaboration&quot;, and &quot;Theme to the West&quot;. Kenton was credited as a co-writer of the 1944 jazz classic &quot;And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine&quot;.

==Kenton and Drum Corps==
Many of the Kenton band&#x27;s arrangements have been popular with drum corps, where the contrasting dynamics and demanding brass playing are particularly suited to the competitive nature of the activity. Of particular note are Madison Scouts championship-winning performance of &quot;Malaguena&quot; in 1988, Suncoast Sound&#x27;s 1986 repertoire based on &quot;Adventures in Time&quot;, and Blue Devils Drum and Bugle Corps 1992 suite from &quot;Cuban Fire&quot;.

<text>Bheki (Sanskrit: भेकि) is the name given to a frog that symbolises the sun on the horizon in Sanskrit legend. Related myths can be found in Germanic and Celtic culture.

In the legend, Bheki was originally a beautiful woman. A king asked her to be his wife, so she married him, but only on condition that he should never show her a drop of water. One day she grew tired, and asked for water. The king gave it to her, and she sank out of his sight, just as the sun sinks when it touches the water.

<text>Robert Lincoln Lowe (July 10, 1865 – December 8, 1951), nicknamed &quot;Link&quot;, was an American Major League Baseball (MLB) player, coach, and scout. He played for the Boston Beaneaters (1890–1901), Chicago Cubs (1902–1903), Pittsburgh Pirates (1904), and Detroit Tigers (1904–1907). Lowe was the first player in Major League history to hit four home runs in a game, a feat which he accomplished in May 1894. He also tied or set Major League records with 17 total bases in a single game and six hits in a single game. Lowe was a versatile player who played at every position but was principally a second baseman. When he retired in 1907, his career fielding average of .953 at second base was the highest in Major League history.

Lowe also worked as a baseball manager, coach, and scout. He was the player-manager of the Detroit Tigers during the last half of the 1904 season. He was also a player-manager for the Grand Rapids Wolverines in 1908, and coached college baseball in 1907 for the University of Michigan and from 1909 to 1910 for Washington &amp; Jefferson College. Lowe was a scout for the Detroit Tigers in 1911 and 1912.

==Early years==
Lowe was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in July 1865, two months after the end of the American Civil War and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. His middle name &quot;Lincoln&quot; likely derives from the historic circumstances immediately preceding his birth. Lowe&#x27;s father, Robert L. Lowe, was a Pennsylvania native and a railroad engineer. His mother, Jane (or Jennie) Lowe, was an immigrant from Ireland. At the time of the 1870 U.S. Census, at age five, he was living with his parents and four siblings Mary, Eliza (or Lida), John Charles, and Olive B., in Union Township, Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, approximately 50 miles north of Pittsburgh, a township adjoining the city of New Castle. By 1880, Lowe&#x27;s father had died, and at age 15 he was living with his mother and three siblings in Union Township.

==Amateur and minor league baseball==
In 1881, Lowe was working as an &quot;office devil&quot; at the &quot;Newcastle Courant&quot;, a newspaper in New Castle, Pennsylvania. In the summer of 1881, at age 16, he played in a baseball game between the printers and the doctors of New Castle. Charley Powers, who played minor league baseball, was working as a compositor at the &quot;Courant&quot; and was selected as the captain of the printers. Lowe pleaded for a place on the team, and Powers stationed him in right field. He later recalled that &quot;the kid carried off the honors both in the field and at the bat. I saw at once that he was a born ballplayer.&quot;
In 1882, Lowe played with the Archie Reeds, an amateur baseball club in New Castle. He left his job with the &quot;Courant&quot; in 1883 and, at age 18, took a job as a machinist at Witherow &amp; Co., the largest manufacturing establishment in New Castle. He was the sole support at the time for his mother and youngest sister, Olive, and gave up baseball for several years. Some accounts indicate he also played for Witherow&#x27;s plant baseball team and for the Neshannocks of New Castle.

In 1886, Charley Powers organized a baseball club in New Castle and persuaded Lowe&#x27;s employer to allow him to play with the club occasionally. He played catcher and third base for New Castle in 1886 and led the team in batting and baserunning.

Powers and Lowe both signed to play with the Eau Claire, Wisconsin team in the Northwestern League during the summer of 1887. Powers later recalled that the manager of the Eau Claire club, Abe Devine, ran a saloon and refused to use Lowe because he refused to patronize his saloon. Devine sent him back to New Castle, declaring, &quot;That boy can&#x27;t play ball,&quot; but brought him back to Eau Claire after the team&#x27;s starting third baseman, Charlie Levis, was injured. Lowe was put into the lineup in a game against Milwaukee and drew cheers from the crowd for his defensive play at third base. In his first at-bat, he hit a long home run off Varney Anderson that &quot;sailed far over the center field fence.&quot; He appeared in 108 games for Eau Claire in 1887, batting .294 with 47 extra-base hits, 61 stolen bases, 100 runs scored and 240 total bases. He also demonstrated his versatility in the field, playing 51 games in left field, 21 games at shortstop, 17 games in right field, 11 games at third base, 6 games as catcher, and 5 games in center field.

During the 1888 and 1889 baseball seasons, Lowe played for the Milwaukee Brewers and Milwaukee Creams of the Western Association. He hit .246 in 114 games in 1888, and hit .315 in 99 games in 1889.
==Major League Baseball==

===Boston Beaneaters===

After the 1889 baseball season, the Boston Beaneaters purchased Lowe from the Milwaukee Brewers for $700 in a deal that has been described as &quot;one of baseball&#x27;s biggest bargains.&quot; He made his Major League Baseball debut with the Beaneaters on April 19, 1890, and remained with the Beaneaters for 12 years through 1901.

During his years in Boston, Lowe developed a reputation both as a hitter and a fielder. Listed at 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m), 150 pounds (68 kg), he hit right-handed and was considered one of the best second basemen of the 19th century. He was one of only three (along with Kid Nichols and Herman Long) to play on all five of the Beaneaters teams that won pennants in the 1890s.

In 1891, Lowe tied a then major league record with six hits (four singles, a double, and a home run) in six at-bats. Having played mostly in the outfield in 1891 and 1892, he replaced Joe Quinn at second base in 1893 and was the Beaneaters&#x27; starting second baseman for eight straight years, from 1893 to 1900.

On May 30, 1894, Lowe became the first major-leaguer to hit four home runs in one game, including two home runs in the third inning. He accomplished the feat in front of a Decoration Day crowd of 8,500 spectators against Elton &quot;Ice Box&quot; Chamberlain of the Cincinnati Reds at Boston&#x27;s Congress Street Grounds. The &quot;Boston Daily Globe&quot; reported on the game as follows:&quot;Bobby Lowe broke all league records with four home runs in succession, and then tied the record for total bases by adding a single, making a total of 17 bases. The hitting of Lowe has never been surpassed in a game. His home runs were on line drives far over the fence, and would be good for four bases on an open prairie. The crowd cheered Bobby every time he came up, and when he responded with a home run even the visitors had to join in the good-natured smile.&quot;
After the game, fans &quot;showered $160 worth of silver on the plate for Lowe.&quot; In 1894, he led the National League with 613 at-bats and was among the leaders in fielding and particularly in batting, with 319 total bases (2nd in the league), 17 home runs (2nd in the league), 345 putouts as a second baseman (2nd in the league), 212 hits (4th in the league), 402 assists as a second baseman (4th in the league), and 158 runs scored (5th in the league).

He was part of a Beaneater infield that included Fred Tenney at first base, Lowe at second base, Herman Long at shortstop, and Jimmy Collins at third base, and has been rated by some as &quot;the greatest infield of all time.&quot; John McGraw reportedly called Lowe and Long the greatest double-play combination he had seen.

In December 1895, the &quot;Boston Daily Globe&quot; published a lengthy biography of Lowe, whom the paper described as Boston&#x27;s &quot;quiet, unassuming but phenomenal second baseman.&quot; The &quot;Globe&quot; noted that the ease with which Lowe played the game led many to understate his value to the club:&quot;For a grand player, Lowe is seldom given the credit often dished out to his inferiors. His work does not appeal to the bleachers and grandstand like the less natural and clumsy player who is often seen floundering around like a fish out of water, while the crowd enjoy the effort and go home to tell what great playing they saw. &#x27;He is a hard worker,&#x27; you will hear them say. Bobby Lowe is not only a hard worker but a conscientious player and an artist of the first magnitude.&quot;
Lowe&#x27;s annual salary while playing for Boston never exceeded $3,000.

===Chicago Cubs===
On December 16, 1901, Lowe was purchased by the Chicago Orphans from the Beaneaters. In April 1902, manager Frank Selee named him team captain. He played for the Orphans, renamed the Cubs later that season, for two years. He was the starting second baseman in 1902. Although his batting statistics declined that year (.248 batting average), his .956 fielding percentage, 328 putouts, and 412 assists each ranked second among National League second basemen. In 1903, he became a backup to Johnny Evers at second base, appearing in only 32 games for the Cubs. He was paid a salary of $3,500 per year for his two years in Chicago.

===Detroit Tigers===
On April 20, 1904, Lowe was purchased by the Pittsburgh Pirates from the Cubs. He appeared in only one game for the Pirates before being sold to the Detroit Tigers on April 30. He was the Tigers&#x27; starting second baseman in 140 games that season. His .964 fielding percentage and 328 assists in 1904 were the second-highest among American League second basemen. Halfway through the season, he also became the manager. In 74 games as a player-manager, he led the Tigers to a 30-44 record. Despite solid fielding in 1904, Lowe&#x27;s offensive output continued to decline as his batting average dropped to .207, 66 points below his career average of .273.

In 1905, Bill Armour took over as Tiger manager, and Lowe stayed on as a part-time player. He was a utility player for the next three seasons, playing all four infield positions and in the outfield. In August 1906, he sustained a broken nose and a fractured jaw after being struck by a foul tip from his own bat during a game in Philadelphia. After the injury, Lowe missed the remainder of the 1906 season and appeared in only 17 games (with 37 at-bats) in 1907, his final year in the major leagues. After that season, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; wrote that Lowe at age 42 &quot;has not lost his batting eye nor his speed. His arm is just as good as ever and he is a much stronger ball player than many who held down regular jobs in the league this past season.&quot;

===Career statistics and legacy===
In his 18-season career in Major League Baseball, Lowe batted .273, with 71 home runs, 989 runs batted in, 1,135 runs, 1,934 hits, 230 doubles, 85 triples, 303 stolen bases, and 474 bases on balls in 1,821 games played. At the time of his retirement, his career fielding average of .953 was the highest for a second baseman, and his totals of 3,336 putouts and 4,171 assists also ranked among the top ten of all-time among second baseman.

In 1911, Fred Tenney wrote a series of articles for &quot;The New York Times&quot; selecting the greatest player in baseball history at each position. Having picked Johnny Evers at second base, Tenney chose Lowe as the best utility player of all time. He wrote: &quot;Lowe of Boston was one of those baseball phenomeons [sic] who could play any position on the team in first-class style.&quot;

In 1932, syndicated sportswriter Whitney Martin wrote a column arguing that Lowe ranked with Bobby Doerr, Joe Gordon, Nap Lajoie, and Eddie Collins as the greatest second basemen of all time. Martin argued that Lowe&#x27;s accomplishments were overlooked because he played &quot;at a time when the ball had more turtle in it than rabbit.&quot; He catalogued a number of Lowe&#x27;s accomplishments to support the argument:
* Hit four home runs and a single in one game for 17 total bases.
* Batted over .300 from 1893 to 1897 &quot;with the dead ball.&quot;
* Made six hits in six at-bats for 10 total bases in another game.
* Scored six runs in one game on May 3, 1895.
* Played 34 consecutive games without an error, accepting 165 chances.

Lowe also won a reputation as a gentleman in an era of rough play. Whitney Martin noted that, in his 18-year career, Lowe &quot;never once was fined or thumbed out of a game.&quot; At the conclusion of his playing career, &quot;The Detroit News&quot; wrote: &quot;Lowe was one of the greatest and is today one of the most popular ball players ever in the game. There is no better type of the gentleman in baseball and no one ever heard ought but words of praise for him.&quot;

In 1936, the Baseball Hall of Fame appointed a Veteran&#x27;s Committee to consider candidates from baseball&#x27;s early years. Lowe ranked 34th in the voting by the Veteran&#x27;s Committee, trailing Nap Lajoie and Dan Brouthers by a half vote. Of the 33 players who finished ahead of him in the voting, 24 have been inducted into the Hall of Fame, and several players who finished behind Lowe in the voting (including Bobby Wallace, Jesse Burkett, Jake Beckley, Tommy McCarthy, Tim Keefe, and Candy Cummings) have also been inducted into the Hall of Fame.

In the 2001 book &quot;The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract&quot;, writer Bill James ranked Lowe as the 56th greatest second baseman of all-time.

==Coaching career==
In addition to his having been the manager of the Tigers for the last half of the 1904 season, Lowe also coached baseball at the college and minor league level. In 1907, he was hired as the baseball coach for the University of Michigan Wolverines baseball team. In April 1907, a newspaper reported: &quot;Mr. Lowe is the idol of the students at the university and has received the highest possible praise from the college for the excellent manner in which he handles the team.&quot; Lowe led the Wolverines to a record of 11-4-1 in 1907.

After his career as a Major League player ended in 1907, Lowe was actively pursued by several minor league teams for coaching positions. He ultimately signed with Grand Rapids Wolverines of the Central League. In March 1908, Lowe expressed optimism that &quot;there is more interest being taken in baseball in different league towns than ever before.&quot;

Lowe&#x27;s final coaching position was as the baseball coach at Washington &amp; Jefferson College in 1909 and 1910.

==Later years==
After retiring as a player and coach, Lowe continued his affiliation with the game as a scout for the Detroit Tigers in the early 1910s. In February 1912, a syndicated newspaper story reported that Lowe had traveled 20,000 miles as a scout during the prior year, and noted that his itinerary &quot;reads like a cross between a railroad guide and an atlas.&quot; Lowe&#x27;s destinations in 1911 included Hattiesburg, Mississippi, Macon, Georgia, Yazoo City, Mississippi, Montgomery, Alabama, New Orleans, Chicago, Memphis, Atlanta, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Hannibal, Missouri, Denver, Butte, Montana, Boise, Idaho, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Waterloo, Iowa, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Calgary, and Moose Jaw.

Lowe was married to Harriet Hughes, whose father operated the Leslie Hotel in New Castle. They had no children. After retiring from baseball, Lowe remained in Detroit. In 1920, he was living with his wife and was employed as a &quot;dealer&quot; in real estate. Later, he became an inspector for the City of Detroit Department of Public Works. In 1930, he was living with his wife at the Case De Vine Apartments and was employed as an inspector for the City of Detroit.

Lowe remained &quot;a student and ardent patron of baseball.&quot; In 1922, he returned to Boston to play in a veterans baseball game to benefit Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital. After Lou Gehrig hit four home runs in a game in 1932, Lowe, wearing his old Beaneaters uniform, posed for photographs with Gehrig. Lowe said, &quot;I feel complimented to share the record with so grand a boy.&quot; He was 38 years older than Gehrig, but outlived him by 10 years. Two days before his 76th birthday, Lowe attended the 1941 All Star game in Briggs Stadium, Detroit.

In December 1951, Lowe died at his home in Detroit at the age of 86. He was posthumously inducted into the Lawrence County Sports Hall of Fame in 1995.

<doc id="661061" wikidata="Q2397992" url="?curid=661061" title="Malt liquor">
<text>Malt liquor is a type of mass market beer with high alcohol content, most closely associated with North America. Legally, it often includes any alcoholic beverage with 5% or more alcohol by volume made with malted barley. In common usage, it refers to beers of high alcohol content, generally above 6%, which are made with ingredients and processes resembling those for American-style lagers.

==Manufacture==
Malt liquor is a strong lager or ale in which sugar, corn or other adjuncts are added to the malted barley to boost the total amount of fermentable sugars in the wort. This increases the final alcohol concentration without creating a heavier or sweeter taste. Also, it is not heavily hopped, so it is not very bitter.

==Brewing and legal definitions==
Malt liquor is typically straw to pale amber in color. While traditional premium lager is made primarily from barley, water, and hops, malt liquors tend to make much greater use of inexpensive adjuncts such as corn, rice, or dextrose. Use of these adjuncts, along with the addition of special enzymes, results in a higher percentage of alcohol than an average beer. Higher-alcohol versions, sometimes called &quot;high-gravity&quot; or just &quot;HG&quot;, may contain high levels of fusel alcohols, which give off solvent- or fuel-like aromas and flavors.

Owing to inconsistencies in American alcoholic beverage regulations, which can vary from state to state, the term &quot;malt liquor&quot; lacks a stable definition. In some states, malt liquor refers to any alcoholic beverage made by fermenting grain and water; in these states a non-alcoholic beer may also be called a non-alcoholic or non-intoxicating malt liquor. In some states, products labeled &quot;beer&quot; must fall below a certain alcohol content, and beers that exceed the mark must be labeled as &quot;malt liquor&quot;. While ordinary beers in the United States average around 4-5% alcohol by volume, malt liquors typically range from 6% up to 9% alcohol by volume. A typical legal definition is Colorado&#x27;s Rev. Stat. ss. 12-47-103(19), which provides that:

&quot;Malt Liquors&quot; includes beer and shall be construed to mean any beverage obtained by the alcoholic fermentation of any infusion or decoction of barley, malt, hops or any other similar products, or any combination thereof, in water containing more than three and one fifth percent of alcohol by weight.

Alcohol percentages measured by weight translate into larger figures when re-expressed as alcohol percentages by volume, because ethanol is less dense than water.

==History==
The term &quot;malt liquor&quot; is documented in England in 1690 as a general term encompassing both beer and ale. The first mention of the term in North America appears in a patent issued by the Canadian government on July 6, 1842, to one G. Riley for &quot;an improved method of brewing ale, beer, porter, and other maltliquors.&quot;

The Clix brand is often credited as the first malt liquor made in the United States, granted a patent in 1948. The first widely successful malt liquor brand in America was Country Club, which was produced in the early 1950s by the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company in St. Joseph, Missouri.

Popular brands include Colt 45, St. Ides, Mickey&#x27;s, Steel Reserve, King Cobra, Olde English 800, Country Club, Magnum, Schlitz Bull, Private Stock, Earthquake, Camo, Hurricane, Natty Daddy, and Icehouse Edge.

==Advertising==
The core market for malt liquor brewers in the United States in recent decades has been the Black and Hispanic populations. Brewers&#x27; use of target marketing in advertising malt liquor primarily to young, inner-city, black males has been controversial, because of the drink&#x27;s higher alcohol content and the perceived vulnerability of the target audience. Brewers and advertisers have stated that they simply advertise to those who already buy their products. Critics have objected to the targeting of a segment of the population suffering disproportionately from alcohol-related disease and poor access to medical care.

In order to highlight the potency of malt liquor, brand names have stressed powerful imagery such as Colt 45 (a reference to the .45 Colt handgun cartridge), Big Bear, and Power Master, and used slogans such as &quot;It&#x27;s got more&quot; or &quot;The Real Power&quot;. Power and sexual dominance have been common themes in their advertising. Latter-20th-century television commercials for Schlitz Malt Liquor featured an 1800-lb. Brahma bull charging through walls. Ads for Power Master, and the brand name itself, were eventually banned in the United States by regulations against advertising implying the strength of alcoholic beverages. 

===Health concerns===
The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) has reported that African Americans suffer disproportionate rates of cirrhosis of the liver and other alcohol-related health problems. In light of such statistics, African-American community leaders and some health officials have concluded that targeting high-alcohol beverage ads at this segment of the population is unethical and socially irresponsible. In 1991, U.S. Surgeon General Antonia Novello criticized all alcoholic beverage companies for &quot;unabashedly targeting teenagers&quot; with &quot;sexual imagery, cartoons, and rock and rap music&quot; in television and print ads.

==Container size==
In the American vernacular, a forty-ounce or simply a forty is a glass or plastic bottle that holds of malt liquor. Malt liquors are commonly sold in 40–fluid ounce bottles, among other sizes, as opposed to the standard bottle that contains a single serving of beer, although many malt liquors are offered in various volumes.

After the introduction of 40-ounce containers, which contain roughly five standard drinks, &quot;Forties&quot; became a favorite high of many youth in inner-city areas. They have often been mentioned and endorsed by rap stars as well as by punk bands, as in such songs as &quot;40.oz Casualty&quot; by The Casualties, &quot;Rock the 40. Oz.&quot; by Leftöver Crack, and &quot;40oz. to Freedom&quot; by Sublime.

Examples of malt liquors sold in forty-ounce bottles include Olde English 800, Colt 45, Mickey&#x27;s, Camo 40, Earthquake, Black Fist, Country Club, Black Bull, Labatt Blue Dry 6.1/7.1/8.1/9.1/10.1, Labatt Max Ice, WildCat, Molson Dry 6.5/7.5/8.5/10.1, Molson XXX, Private Stock, Big Bear, St. Ides, Steel Reserve 211, B40 Bull Max, King Cobra, and Hurricane. Dogfish Head Brewery has sporadically produced a high-end bottle-conditioned forty called &quot;Liquor de Malt&quot;.

At least for a brief period in the mid-1990s, some brands of malt liquor, including Olde English 800, Colt 45, and Mickey&#x27;s, were available in even larger, 64-ounce glass bottles. Forty-ounce bottles are not permitted in some U.S. states, including Florida, where the largest permissible container of retail malt beverage is .

==International==

American malt liquor brands are rarely exported to Europe.

American-style malt liquors were made in Britain in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some were American brands brewed under license, notably Colt 45; some were not. They were generally 5% ABV. They were heavily marketed but failed in the market.

However, similar inexpensive high-alcohol beers are available, whilst white cider fills a similar niche as a cheap-to-produce product available in large containers.
In Italy, beers with more than 14.5 Plato degrees fall into a distinct tax rate known as (double malt beer). Brewing companies often state this classification on the label. Therefore, the indication nearly always identifies a beer that is the rough equivalent strength of a North American malt liquor.
