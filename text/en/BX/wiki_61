<text>The City of Kwinana is a local government area of Western Australia. It covers an area of approximately 118 square kilometres in metropolitan Perth, and lies about 38 km south of the Perth central business district, via the Kwinana Freeway. Kwinana maintains 287 km of roads and had a population of almost 39,000 as at the 2016 Census.

== History ==

Kwinana is a Kimberley Aboriginal word meaning either &quot;young woman&quot; or &quot;pretty maiden&quot;. The ship was wrecked on Cockburn Sound in 1922 and blown onto Kwinana Beach. The nearby area acquired the name and it was officially adopted for a township in 1937. Some of its suburbs take their names from the sailing ships that first brought immigrants to Western Australia, for example, Medina, Calista and Parmelia.

The Kwinana Road District was formed out of part of Rockingham on 15 February 1954 as a result of the passage of the &quot;Kwinana Road District Act 1953&quot;. Section 4 of the Act stated that &quot;there shall not be a duly elected Road Board for the Kwinana Road District but the Governor may, by Order in Council, appoint a fit and proper person having a comprehensive knowledge and experience of local government matters to be Commissioner of the district.&quot;

On 11 November 1960, an Order in Council was issued dividing Kwinana into five wards in preparation for an election to be held on 11 February 1961. The Town ward would elect three councillors while the Rural, Industrial, Naval Base and Kwinana Beach wards would each elect one councillor. In order that the election could go ahead, the Kwinana Road District Act was repealed on 14 February 1961 by proclamation, with the District now subject to the same laws as any other council. The first elected councillors took office on 15 February 1961.

On 1 July 1961, the district became the Shire of Kwinana following the enactment of the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;. It became the Town of Kwinana on 28 May 1977 and it assumed its current name when it was proclaimed a city on 17 September 2012.

== Industry ==
In 1952 a major industrial area was developed by BP (then the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company) in conjunction with the state government. The state government guaranteed that it would provide electricity, water, essential infrastructure and 2000 state homes within three years to support the establishment of the Kwinana Oil Refinery. Today there are many other associated petro-chemical companies nearby.

The city is home to the Fremantle Outer Harbour consisting of, from north to south, the Alcoa Jetty, the Kwinana Bulk Terminal, the BP Oil Refinery Jetty, the Kwinana Bulk Jetty and the CBH Grain Jetty.

Of these, the Kwinana Bulk Terminal and the Kwinana Bulk Jetty are operated by the Fremantle Ports and serve for the import and export of bulk cargoes and liquids, among them iron ore, coal, cement clink, gypsum, liquefied natural gas, petroleum and fertiliser. The other three facilities are privately operated.

The Outer Harbour deepwater bulk facilities in at Kwinana were first developed in 1955, to service the Kwinana industrial area, and saw rapid expansion in the 1960s and 70s.

From 1968 to 1982, the BHP subsidiary company, Australian Iron &amp; Steel, operated a blast furnace making pig iron at Kwinana, using iron ore mined at Koolyanobing.

The Kwinana Industrial Area is also home to the Kwinana Grain Terminal, also the facility is located in East Rockingham. A cooperative owned by 12,000 farmers, CBH Group is Western Australia&#x27;s leading grain storage, handling and marketing business. Grain from the facility is also used to supply Primary Energy&#x27;s proposed bio-fuel facility in Kwinana.

In 2020, Spanish renewable energy leader Acciona and Hitachi Zosen Inova (HZI) received approval to build a waste-to-energy plant in the Rockingham Industrial Zone. The 29 MW plant will have capacity to power 40,000 homes from an annual feedstock of 300,000 tonnes of municipal, industrial and commercial rubbish.

== Facilities ==
There are three public beaches at Cockburn Sound looking out to Garden Island. herself is part of the former jetty at Kwinana Beach. The rusting hulk of the ship was cut down to low water level and the centre was filled with limestone to form a platform. There are also wetlands and bushlands in the Kwinana area. The Spectacles are the local wetlands and are so named because of their appearance from the air.

The local companies are keen to be seen preserving the environment and claim to demonstrate the best practice in production methods and environmental safeguards. The BP Kwinana Refinery is apparently responsible for &quot;Australia&#x27;s cleanest petrol&quot; – BP Ultimate, which matches the stringent environmental specifications demanded in Europe and the United States.

Kwinana also is home to a centre of attraction for drag racing, dirt track speedway, burnout competitions, street machine shows and supercross events. The Perth Motorplex opened in December 2000 at a cost of A$20 million with catering, licensed bars, state of the art stadium lighting and the &quot;Snake Pit&quot;, a purpose built and dedicated burn out section. The venue holds many prestigious events including the Westernationals (drag racing), World Series Sprintcars (speedway) and Motorvation (car show).

== Local elections ==
The 2023 Western Australian local elections were held within the City of Kwinana and marked the first time a new system was used. Optional preferential voting was used to replace the first-past-the-post system used under previous local elections. Another first in this election was the appointment of Peter Feasey as mayor - the first time this role had been voted in by the general public as opposed to being voted for by the elected councillors.

<doc id="676678" wikidata="Q1278904" url="?curid=676678" title="Nigel Kneale">
<text>Thomas Nigel Kneale (18 April 1922 – 29 October 2006) was a Manx screenwriter who wrote professionally for more than 50 years, was a winner of the Somerset Maugham Award, and was twice nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best British Screenplay.

Predominantly a writer of thrillers that used science-fiction and horror elements, he was best known for the creation of the character Professor Bernard Quatermass. Quatermass was an heroic scientist who appeared in various television, film and radio productions written by Kneale for the BBC, Hammer Film Productions and Thames Television between 1953 and 1996. Kneale wrote original scripts and successfully adapted works by writers such as George Orwell, John Osborne, H. G. Wells and Susan Hill.

Kneale was most active in television, joining BBC Television in 1951; his final script was transmitted on ITV in 1997. He wrote well-received television dramas such as &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Stone Tape&quot; (1972) in addition to the &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials. He has been described as &quot;one of the most influential writers of the 20th century&quot;, and as &quot;having invented popular TV&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Kneale was born Thomas Nigel Kneale in Barrow-in-Furness, England on 28 April 1922. His family came from the Isle of Man, and returned to live there in 1928, when he was six years old. He was raised in the island&#x27;s capital, Douglas, where his father was the owner and editor of the local newspaper, &quot;The Herald&quot;. He was educated at St Ninian&#x27;s High School, Douglas and trained to become an advocate at the Manx Bar. He also worked in a lawyer&#x27;s office, but became bored with his legal training and abandoned the profession. At the beginning of the Second World War Kneale attempted to enlist in the British Army, but was deemed medically unfit for service owing to photophobia, from which he had suffered since childhood.

=== 1946–1950: Acting career ===
On 25 March 1946 Kneale made his first broadcast on BBC Radio, performing a live reading of his own short story &quot;Tomato Cain&quot; in a strand entitled &quot;Stories by Northern Authors&quot; on the BBC&#x27;s North of England Home Service region. Later that year he left the Isle of Man and moved to London, where he studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA). He made further radio broadcasts in the 1940s, including a reading of his story &quot;Zachary Crebbin&#x27;s Angel&quot; on the BBC Light Programme, broadcast nationally on 19 May 1948. He also had short stories published in magazines such as &quot;Argosy&quot; and &quot;The Strand&quot;. He began using the name &quot;Nigel Kneale&quot; for these professional credits, but was known as &quot;Tom&quot; to his family and friends up until his death.

After graduating from RADA, Kneale worked for a short time as a professional actor performing in small roles at the Stratford Memorial Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. He continued to write in his spare time and in 1949 a collection of his work, &quot;Tomato Cain and Other Stories&quot;, was published. The book sufficiently impressed the writer Elizabeth Bowen that she wrote a foreword for it, and in 1950 the collection won the Somerset Maugham Award.

Following this success, Kneale gave up acting to write full-time. He did take small voice-over roles in some of his 1950s television productions, such as the voice heard on the factory loudspeaker system in &quot;Quatermass II&quot; (1955), for which he also narrated most of the recaps shown at the beginning of each episode. Kneale&#x27;s publisher was keen for him to write a novel, but Kneale himself was more interested in writing for television. A keen cinema-goer, he believed that the audience being able to see human faces was an important factor in storytelling.

=== 1950–1953: Kneale&#x27;s early BBC screenplay work ===
His first professional script writing credit came when he wrote the radio drama &quot;The Long Stairs&quot;, broadcast by the BBC on 1 March 1950 and based on an historical mining disaster on the Isle of Man. In 1951 he was recruited as one of the first staff writers to be employed by BBC Television; before he started working for the station, Kneale had never seen any television. Kneale was initially a general-purpose writer, working on adaptations of books and stage plays and even writing material for light entertainment and children&#x27;s programmes. The following year, Michael Barry became the Head of Drama at BBC Television, and spent his entire first year&#x27;s script budget of £250 to hire Kneale as a full-time writer for the drama department. Kneale&#x27;s first credited role in adult television drama was providing &quot;additional dialogue&quot; for the play &quot;Arrow to the Heart&quot;, broadcast on 20 July 1952. This play was adapted and directed by the Austrian television director Rudolph Cartier, who had also joined the staff of the BBC drama department in 1952.

Kneale&#x27;s &quot;lost&quot; radio play &quot;You Must Listen&quot;, broadcast in 1952, was re-broadcast in a new production by BBC Radio 4 on 20 September 2023.

=== 1953: &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; ===
Kneale wrote &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, which was broadcast in six half-hour episodes in July and August 1953. The serial told the story of Professor Bernard Quatermass of the British Experimental Rocket Group, and the consequences of his sending the first crewed mission into space where a terrible fate befalls the crew and only one returns. &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was one of the first adult television science-fiction productions, held a large television audience gripped across its six weeks, and has been described by the Museum of Broadcast Communications as dramatising &quot;a new range of gendered fears about Britain&#x27;s postwar and post-colonial security.&quot; Kneale chose the character&#x27;s surname because many Manx surnames began with &quot;Qu&quot;; the actual name itself was picked from a London telephone directory. The Professor&#x27;s first name was chosen in honour of the astronomer Bernard Lovell.

The BBC recognised the success of the serial, particularly in the context of the impending arrival of commercial television to the UK. Controller of Programmes Cecil McGivern wrote in a memo that: &quot;Had competitive television been in existence then, we would have killed it every Saturday night while [&quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;] lasted. We are going to need &quot;many&quot; more &#x27;Quatermass Experiment&#x27; programmes.&quot; Like all of Kneale&#x27;s television work for the BBC in the 1950s, &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; was transmitted live; only the first two episodes were telerecorded and survive in the BBC&#x27;s archives.

In the autumn of 1955, Hammer Film Productions released &quot;The Quatermass Xperiment&quot;, their film adaptation of the serial. Kneale was not pleased with the film, and particularly disliked the casting of Brian Donlevy as Quatermass, as he explained in a 1986 interview. &quot;[Donlevy] was then really on the skids and didn&#x27;t care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle.&quot;

=== 1953–1956: Later BBC works ===
Kneale and Cartier next collaborated on an adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (broadcast 6 December 1953) and then on a version of George Orwell&#x27;s novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (12 December 1954). &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; was a particularly notable production; many found it shocking, and questions were asked in Parliament about whether some of the scenes had been suitable for television. There was also prominent support for the play; the Duke of Edinburgh made it known that he and the Queen had watched and enjoyed the programme, and the second live performance on 16 December gained the largest television audience since her coronation the previous year. &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper&#x27;s obituary of Kneale in 2006 claimed that the adaptation had &quot;permanently revived Orwell&#x27;s reputation,&quot; while the British Film Institute included it in their list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century in 2000.

&quot;The Creature&quot;—an original script by Kneale concerning the legend of the abominable snowman—was his next collaboration with Cartier, broadcast on 30 January 1955, followed by an adaptation of Peter Ustinov&#x27;s play &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; (10 March 1955), before Kneale was commissioned to write &quot;Quatermass II&quot;. Specifically designed by the BBC to combat the threat of the new ITV network, which launched just a month before &quot;Quatermass II&quot; was shown, the serial was even more successful than the first, drawing audiences of up to nine million viewers. Kneale was inspired in writing the serial by contemporary fears over secret UK Ministry of Defence research establishments such as Porton Down, as well the fact that as a BBC staff writer he had been required to sign the Official Secrets Act.

&quot;Quatermass II&quot; was Kneale&#x27;s final original script for the BBC as a staff writer. He left the corporation when his contract expired at the end of 1956; &quot;Five years in that hut was as much as any sane person could stand,&quot; he later told an interviewer.

=== 1956–1958: Further &quot;Quatermass&quot; works ===
The same year that he left the BBC, Kneale wrote his first feature film screenplay, adapting &quot;Quatermass II&quot; for Hammer Film Productions along with producer Anthony Hinds and director Val Guest. Hinds and Guest had overseen the first &quot;Quatermass&quot; film, upon which Kneale had been unable to work due to his BBC staff contract. Kneale was disappointed that Brian Donlevy also returned in the role of Quatermass. The film premiered at the end of May 1957, and was reviewed positively in &quot;The Times&quot;: &quot;The writer of the original story, Mr Nigel Kneale, and the director, Mr Val Guest, between them keep things moving at the right speed, without digressions. The film has an air of respect for the issues touched on, and this impression is confirmed by the acting generally.&quot; 1957 also saw the release of another cinematic collaboration between Kneale and Guest, when Kneale adapted his 1955 BBC play &quot;The Creature&quot; into &quot;The Abominable Snowman&quot;; in this case, Hammer retained the star of the BBC version, Peter Cushing.

In May 1957, Kneale was contracted by the BBC to write a third &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial, and this was eventually transmitted as &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; across six weeks in December 1958 and January 1959. On this occasion Kneale was inspired by the racial tensions that had recently been seen in the United Kingdom, and which came to a head while the serial was in pre-production when the Notting Hill race riots occurred in August and September 1958. Drawing audiences of up to 11 million, &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; has been referred to by the BBC&#x27;s own website as &quot;simply the first finest thing the BBC ever made.&quot; It was also included in the British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;TV 100&quot; list in 2000, where it was praised for the themes and subtexts it explored. &quot;In a story which mined mythology and folklore ... under the guise of genre it tackled serious themes of man&#x27;s hostile nature and the military&#x27;s perversion of science for its own ends.&quot;

Despite the success of the serial, Kneale felt that he had now taken the character of Quatermass as far as he could. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to go on repeating because Professor Quatermass had already saved the world from ultimate destruction three times, and that seemed to me to be quite enough,&quot; he said in 1986. It was also his final new collaboration with Rudolph Cartier, although the director did later handle a new version of Kneale&#x27;s 1953 adaptation of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; for the BBC in 1962.

=== 1958–1966: Film screenplays and adaptations ===
In 1958, Kneale&#x27;s play &quot;Mrs Wickens in the Fall&quot;, transmitted by the BBC the previous year, was remade by the CBS network in the United States, retitled &quot;The Littlest Enemy&quot;. Broadcast on 18 June as part of &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; anthology series, the script was severely cut back in length. It was Kneale&#x27;s only involvement with American television, and he was not pleased with the result. &quot;I made up my mind I would never ever again have anything done on a television network in America,&quot; he later commented.

For the next few years, Kneale concentrated mostly on film screenplays, adapting plays and novels for the cinema. Described by &quot;The Independent&quot; as &quot;one of the few writers not to fall out with John Osborne&quot;, Kneale adapted Osborne&#x27;s plays &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; and &quot;The Entertainer&quot; in 1958 and 1960 respectively, both for director Tony Richardson. Kneale knew Richardson through having previously adapted a Chekhov short story for the BBC, which Richardson had directed. Kneale was nominated for the British Film Award (later known as a BAFTA) for Best Screenplay for both films. Film producer Harry Saltzman, who had produced the two Osborne adaptations, approached Kneale about scripting a project he was working on to adapt Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond novels for the cinema; Kneale was not a fan of Fleming&#x27;s work and turned the offer down.

Kneale completed screenplays for adaptations of the novels &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; by William Golding and &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Aldous Huxley. Neither of these scripts ever saw production, as the companies making them went out of business. Another screenplay that went unproduced was a Kneale original, a drama involving a wave of teenage suicides called &quot;The Big Giggle&quot;, or &quot;The Big, Big Giggle&quot;. Written in 1965 while Kneale was suffering from a mystery illness and forced to stay in bed for a long period, the concept was produced as a drama serial for the BBC, before the corporation reconsidered the nature of the storyline and the possibility of copycat suicides; Kneale later agreed with their decision not to make it for television. The production was nearly made as a film by 20th Century Fox, but John Trevelyan, Chief Executive of the British Board of Film Censors, forbade the script&#x27;s production.

In 1966 Kneale worked again for Hammer Film Productions when he adapted Norah Lofts&#x27;s 1960 novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; into the horror film &quot;The Witches&quot;. Kneale had worked on the screenplay for the adaptation in 1961, the same year in which he had begun to adapt &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; for Hammer. Like &quot;The Witches&quot;, the film version of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; took several years to reach the screen, eventually being released in 1967. Roy Ward Baker directed, with Andrew Keir starring as Quatermass. Kneale was much happier with this version than the previous Hammer Quatermass adaptations, and the film was described by &quot;The Independent&quot; in 2006 as &quot;one of the best ever Hammer productions.&quot; &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; was Kneale&#x27;s final credited film work; 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Quatermass Conclusion&quot; was only released to cinemas in overseas markets after it was made for television in the UK, and he had his name removed from the credits of &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; (1982).

=== 1963–1974: Return to BBC ===
Kneale returned to writing for television with the BBC when his play &quot;The Road&quot; was broadcast in September 1963. The play concerned the population of an 18th-century village who become haunted by visions of a future nuclear war, and was followed by several one-off dramas for the BBC over the following decade, including two entries into BBC1&#x27;s &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; anthology strand. During this period he was regarded as one of the finest writers working for the BBC by Shaun Sutton, the Head of Drama for BBC television. Kneale did his first work for the ITV network during this time, writing a one-off play called &quot;The Crunch&quot; for the ATV company in 1964.

A particular critical success was &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot;, broadcast as part of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Theatre 625&quot; series in July 1968. In the programme, a group of people creates a show-within-a-show called &quot;The Live Life Show&quot;, in which a family are filmed as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island. becomes a massive success, especially when a murderer is introduced into the set-up. &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot; has been praised for its foreshadowing of the rise of reality television programmes such as &quot;Big Brother&quot; (1999–present) and &quot;Celebrity Love Island&quot; (2005–2006). Critic Nancy Banks-Smith wrote in 2003 that: &quot;In &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot; [Kneale] foretold the reality show and, in the scramble for greater sensation, its logical outcome ... This is satire from a TV insider, but it mutates into something far more desolate and disorientating.&quot;

In 1965 Kneale had been approached by the producer of the BBC2 science-fiction anthology series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot; to write a new one-off 75-minute &quot;Quatermass&quot; story for the programme. Nothing came of this, but he would write &quot;The Chopper&quot; six years later for the fourth and final series. It was about the vengeful spirit of a dead motorcyclist who is reluctant to leave his wrecked machine and manifests itself to a woman journalist as motorbike noise. It featured Patrick Troughton as a mechanic, although the episode is now lost. In 1972 he was commissioned by the BBC to write a new four-part &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial, based in a dystopian near future world overrun with crime, apathy, martial law and youth cults. The serial was announced as a forthcoming production by the BBC in November, and some model filming was even begun in June 1973, but eventually budgetary problems and the unavailability of Stonehenge—a central location in the scripts—led to the project&#x27;s cancellation.

Kneale&#x27;s next script for the BBC was &quot;The Stone Tape&quot;, a scientific ghost story broadcast on Christmas Day 1972. Lez Cooke praised the production, when writing in 2003, describing it as &quot;one of the most imaginative and intelligent examples of the horror genre to appear on British television, a single play to rank alongside the best of &quot;Play for Today&quot;.&quot; His final BBC work was an entry into a series called &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, adapting traditional fairy tales into adult dramas. Kneale&#x27;s last script for the BBC, &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;, was transmitted on 24 March 1974.

=== 1974–1982: Early ITV work ===
Kneale&#x27;s remaining television work was written for ITV. His first script for ITV in this period was the one-off play &quot;Murrain&quot;, made by the network&#x27;s Midlands franchise holders Associated TeleVision (ATV) in 1975. The play, a horror piece based around witchcraft, led the following year to a series called &quot;Beasts&quot;, a six-part anthology where Kneale created six different character-based tales of horror and the macabre. It featured some well-known actors such as Martin Shaw, Pauline Quirke and Bernard Horsfall, but did not gain a full network run on ITV; different regions transmitted the episodes in different timeslots and some in different sequences.

In the mid-1970s, Kneale made his only attempt at writing a stage play. Called &quot;Crow&quot;, it was based upon the memoirs of real-life Manx slaver Captain Hugh Crow. Kneale was unable to find backing to produce the play for the stage, but sold the script to ATV who put it into pre-production for television. Shortly before filming it was cancelled by ATV&#x27;s managing director, Lew Grade, and Kneale was never told why.

Following the cancellation of &quot;Crow&quot;, Kneale moved to work for another of the ITV companies, Thames Television, who in 1977 commissioned the production of the scripts of Kneale&#x27;s previously abandoned fourth &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial, to be produced by their Euston Films subsidiary film company. The production, &quot;Quatermass&quot;, was structured to work both as a four-episode serial for transmission in the UK, and a 100-minute film version for cinema release overseas—something Kneale later regretted agreeing to. Starring John Mills as Quatermass and with a budget of over £1 million—more than fifty times the budget of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; in 1958—the serial was not as critically successful as its predecessors. &quot;Thematically no less awesome than Mr Kneale&#x27;s earlier science-fiction essays for BBC Television, his ITV debut has proved only a so-so affair&quot;, was the verdict of &quot;The Times&quot; when previewing the final episode. Tying in with the series, Kneale returned to prose fiction when he wrote his only full-length novel, &quot;Quatermass&quot;, a novelisation of the serial.

Kneale&#x27;s next television series was a departure from his usual style—&quot;Kinvig&quot;, his sole attempt at writing a sitcom, produced by London Weekend Television and broadcast on ITV in the autumn of 1981. Although his first out-and-out comedy, Kneale stressed that there had always been elements of humour present throughout his scripts. Some of the press reaction to &quot;Kinvig&quot; was positive: &quot;If you like the idea of the &quot;Hitch-Hiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; but found its realization tiresomely hysterical you may well prefer Kneale&#x27;s relaxed wit. Cast splendid, direction deft,&quot; was &quot;The Times&quot;″s preview of the first episode. The series was not a commercial success, although Kneale later remained personally pleased with it.

=== 1982: &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot; ===
In 1982, Kneale made another one-off diversion from his usual work when he wrote his only produced Hollywood movie script, &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;. Kneale was approached by the director John Landis to work on the screenplay for a remake of &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;, and Kneale and his wife spent some time living at the Sheraton Hotel in Hollywood while Kneale worked on the project. The &quot;Black Lagoon&quot; script never went into production, but while in America Kneale met the director Joe Dante, who invited him to script the third film in the &quot;Halloween&quot; series, on which Dante was working; Kneale agreed, on the proviso that it would be a totally new concept unrelated to the first two films, which he had not seen and he did not like what he had heard about them.

Kneale&#x27;s treatment for the film met with the approval of John Carpenter, the producer of the &quot;Halloween&quot; series, although Kneale was required to write the script in six weeks. Kneale had a positive relationship with the director assigned to the film, Tommy Lee Wallace, but when one of the film&#x27;s backers, Dino De Laurentiis, insisted upon the inclusion of more graphic violence and a rewrite of the script from Wallace, Kneale became displeased with the results and had his name removed from the film.

=== 1987–1995: Later ITV work ===
He returned to writing scripts for British television, including &quot;Gentry&quot; with Roger Daltrey for ITV in 1987, and the 1989 adaptation of Susan Hill&#x27;s novel &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; for transmission on ITV on Christmas Eve. Lynne Truss, reviewing a repeat broadcast of the production on Channel 4 for &quot;The Times&quot; in 1994, wrote that: &quot;Clip-clop is not usually a noise to get upset about. But it will be an interesting test, today, to go up behind people and whisper &#x27;clip-clop&#x27;, to find out whether they saw &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; last night. People who made the bold decision to watch this excellent drama will respond to any &#x27;clip-clop&#x27; by gratifyingly leaping in the air and grabbing the backs of their necks.&quot; The adaptation nearly went unmade; Kneale had written the script in ten days but been advised by his agent to wait before submitting it to the producers Central Independent Television so that they would not think he had rushed it. When he did submit the script three weeks later, he discovered that Central had been about to cancel the production as they had assumed that Kneale, then 67, had not been able to complete the work due to his age.

Susan Hill did not like some of the changes that Kneale had made to &quot;The Woman in Black&quot;. It has been observed that Kneale on some occasions operated a double standard with adaptations; being unhappy when others made changes to his stories, but willing to make changes to stories he was adapting into script form. Referring to &quot;The Woman in Black&quot; adaptation, the writer and critic Kim Newman noted that: &quot;He was very offended at the notion of Susan Hill using the name of Kipps from HG Wells as the hero of &quot;The Woman in Black&quot;, and so he decided not to use it and to change the hero&#x27;s name to Kidd. I&#x27;m sure if somebody thought that Quatermass was a silly name and changed it, he&#x27;d be furious!&quot; However, Kneale&#x27;s adaptations were not always unpopular with the original author. In 1991, a four-part version he wrote of Kingsley Amis&#x27;s novel &quot;Stanley and the Women&quot;, met with approval from the original author, with Amis regarding it as the most successful adaptation of his work.

Kneale also adapted &quot;Sharpe&#x27;s Gold&quot; for ITV in 1995, as part of their series of adaptations of Bernard Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;Sharpe&quot; novels. This was an assignment that surprised his agent; &quot;We didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d want to bother with them but he did. That was probably because he liked the producer.&quot; He returned to writing for radio for the first time since the 1950s in 1996, when he wrote the drama-documentary &quot;The Quatermass Memoirs&quot; for BBC Radio 3. Partly composed of Kneale looking back at the events that led to the writing of the original three &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials and using some archive material, there was also a dramatised strand to the series, set just before the ITV &quot;Quatermass&quot; serial and featuring Andrew Keir, star of the Hammer version of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;, as the Professor.

While recording an audio commentary for that film in 1997, Kneale speculated about a possible &quot;Quatermass&quot; prequel set in 1930s Germany. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, Kneale conceived a storyline involving the young Quatermass becoming involved in German rocketry experiments in the 1930s, and helping a young Jewish woman to escape from the country during the 1936 Berlin Olympics.

=== 1995–2006: Final years ===
Kneale was invited to write for the successful American science-fiction series &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1993–2002), but declined the offer. His final professional work was an episode of the ITV legal drama &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot;, starring John Thaw. Kneale&#x27;s episode, &quot;Ancient History&quot;, was about a Jewish woman who during the Second World War had been subjected to horrific experiments in a concentration camp.

He continued to appear as an interview subject in various television documentaries, and also recorded further audio commentaries for the release of some of his productions on DVD. In 2005, he acted as a consultant when the digital television channel BBC Four produced a live remake of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;. He lived in Barnes, London, until his death on 29 October 2006 at the age of 84, following a series of small strokes.

==Legacy==
When he joined BBC, Kneale was impressed with the state in which they found BBC television drama. However, he was frustrated at what he saw as the slow and boring styles of television drama production then employed, which he felt wasted the potential of the medium. Together with Cartier he would help revolutionise British television drama and establish it as an entity separate from its theatre and radio equivalents. Television historian Lez Cooke wrote in 2003 that &quot;Between them, Kneale and Cartier were responsible for introducing a completely new dimension to television drama in the early to mid-1950s.&quot; Jason Jacobs, a lecturer in film and television studies at the University of Warwick, wrote: &quot;It was the arrival of Nigel Kneale ... and Rudolph Cartier ... that challenged the intimate drama directly ... Kneale and Cartier shared a common desire to invigorate television with a faster tempo and a broader thematic and spatial canvas, and it was no coincidence that they turned to science-fiction in order to get out of the dominant stylistic trend of television intimacy.&quot;

The writer and actor Mark Gatiss indicated that Kneale was among the first rank of British television writers, but that this had been overlooked. &quot;He is amongst the greats—he is absolutely as important as Dennis Potter, as David Mercer, as Alan Bleasdale, as Alan Bennett, but I think because of a strange snobbery about fantasy or sci-fi it&#x27;s never quite been that way.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that &quot;Kneale was by no means the only author to have been largely wasted by television, and to have seen his status overtaken by soap opera hacks. But his place is secure, alongside Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, John Wyndham and Brian Aldiss, as one of the best, most exciting and most compassionate English science fiction writers of his century.&quot; Writing about &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot;, Nancy Banks-Smith felt that Kneale was one of the few television writers whose work was particularly memorable. &quot;At the name of Kneale, I feel, every knee should bow. How much TV do you remember from last night ... last year ... last century? Quite. Curiously, I can remember clearly the first time I saw &quot;The Year of the Sex Olympics&quot; by Nigel Kneale. It was 35 years ago.&quot;

Kneale was admired by the film director John Carpenter. The horror fiction writer Stephen King has cited Kneale as an influence, and Kim Newman suggested in 2003 that King had &quot;more or less rewritten &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot; in &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot;.&quot; Other writers have acclaimed Kneale as an influence on their work including comics writer Grant Morrison and television screenwriter Russell T Davies, who described the &quot;Beasts&quot; episode &quot;Baby&quot; as &quot;the most frightening thing I&#x27;ve ever seen ... Powerful stuff.&quot; Film screenwriter and director Dan O&#x27;Bannon was also an admirer of Kneale&#x27;s writing, and in 1993 wrote a potential remake of &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot;, of which Kneale approved, but the film was never made. Other entertainment industry figures that publicly expressed admiration for Kneale&#x27;s work include The Beatles&#x27; drummer Ringo Starr, members of the rock group Pink Floyd and &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; writer/performer Michael Palin.

Kneale never saw himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often critical of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), for which he had once turned down an offer to write. He also criticised &quot;Doomwatch&quot; and &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, with the latter described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; was heavily influenced by Kneale&#x27;s &quot;Quatermass&quot; serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were similar to those from &quot;Quatermass&quot;.

== Family ==

Kneale&#x27;s younger brother is artist and sculptor Bryan Kneale, who was Master and then Professor of Sculpture at the Royal Academy from 1982 to 1990. He painted the covers for the &quot;Quatermass&quot; script books released by Penguin Books in 1959 and 1960. He was also responsible for a painting of a lobster from which special effects designers Bernard Wilkie and Jack Kine drew their inspiration for the Martian creatures they constructed for the original television version of &quot;Quatermass and the Pit&quot;.

In the early 1950s Kneale met fellow BBC screenwriter Judith Kerr, a Jewish refugee, in the BBC canteen. They married on 8 May 1954 and had two children; Matthew, who later became a successful novelist, and Tacy, an actress and later a special effects designer who worked on the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series.

Kerr became a successful children&#x27;s writer, with the &quot;Mog&quot; series of books and &quot;When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit&quot;, which was based on her own experiences of fleeing Nazi Germany in her youth. Kneale worked with Kerr on an adaptation of &quot;When Hitler Stole Pink Rabbit&quot; in the 1970s, but the eventual makers of the film version disregarded their script. Similarly, in 1995 Kneale scripted a four-part adaptation of one of Kerr&#x27;s sequels to the book, &quot;A Small Person Far Away&quot;, but this also went unproduced.

<doc id="676688" wikidata="Q4907071" url="?curid=676688" title="Bihar People's Party">
<text>Bihar People&#x27;s Party was a political party in the Indian state of Bihar, founded in 1993 by former leader of the Samajwadi Krantikari Sena and former Janata Dal MLA, Anand Mohan Singh.

Singh&#x27;s wife, Lovely Anand, won a by-election to the Lok Sabha (the lower house of the Parliament of India) from the north Bihar constituency of Vaishali in 1994 by defeating veteran leader Kishori Sinha, wife of Bihar stalwart and former Chief Minister Satyendra Narain Sinha. The party then fielded around 100 candidates in the 1995 state assembly elections, with Anand Mohan Singh himself standing and losing in three separate constituencies.

BPP then joined with the Samata Party and Singh was elected to the Lok Sabha as a candidate of that party in 1996, then as an All India Rashtriya Janata Party candidate in 1998. In 1999 BPP contested the Lok Sabha polls in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Janata Dal (United).

The party contested the 2000 Bihar legislative election in alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Jharkhand People&#x27;s Party. The party won two seats, contesting as independents.

BPP merged with the Indian National Congress party in February 2004.

<doc id="676691" wikidata="Q5696501" url="?curid=676691" title="Hecla-class survey vessel">
<text>The &quot;Hecla&quot; class formed the backbone of the Royal Navy&#x27;s ocean survey fleet from the mid-1960s.

==Design==
The hull design was based on that of the RRS &quot;Discovery&quot; and the Hecla class were built to commercial standards costing £1.25 million each. They carried two small survey craft, a launch, a Land Rover and a Wasp helicopter, for which there was a flight deck and hangar. They were chiefly funded from the Polaris Submarine Ballistic Nuclear Missile programme, with their major task to carry out regular oceanographic observations essential for the Polaris submarines to hide in thermal layers.

===Special modifications===
Besides the strengthened hull for work in ice and the provision of air conditioning necessary for work in all climates, they had modifications particular for a scientific vessel: wet and dry laboratories; a survey chartroom and photographic darkroom; oceanographic winches for deep seawater analysis and coring; stabilisers and a bow thruster, which enabled the ship to maintain her position when stopped for scientific observations.
All 4 Royal Navy vessels were fitted with an Inertial Navigation System for mid-Ocean positioning. &#x27;Drift&#x27; was corrected by taking satellite fixes from the Transit Doppler Sat Nav. 
Each vessel, due to their requirement to operate mid-Ocean, was equipped with a sick bay with a 2-bed ward and an operating theatre with X-Ray machine. Every vessel carried a Surgeon-Lieutenant and Leading Medical Assistant.
In the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s, &#x27;Hecla&#x27; and &#x27;Hecate&#x27; were equipped to make Gravity Free Air Anomaly observations over the mid-Atlantic ridge for the US Department of Defence &#x27;Nav Star&#x27; GPS constellation of satellites.

== Ships in class ==
==Service==
The first three ships, , and , were ordered in the early 1960s to replace the aging survey ships and .

A fourth ship, was ordered in the early 1970s. Apart from HMS &quot;Hecate&quot;, they all saw service as hospital ships in the Falklands War, while &quot;Herald and Hecla&quot; also served in the Gulf War and the former as a temporary Antarctic Patrol Ship in 1991 and 1992. &quot;Hecate&quot; saw service as the temporary Antarctic Patrol Ship in 1982 after being painted grey and fitted with AA guns in Gibraltar. &quot;Hecate&quot; was the first Royal Navy vessel to visit South America following the Falklands conflict. During the conflict, &quot;Hecla&quot;, commanded by Captain Geoffrey Hope RN, with Lt. Cdr. Ward as XO, ferried Argentinian prisoners of war to Montevideo. Being the first vessel of the conflict to be in the glare of the world media, she gained a high public profile out of proportion to her ambulance ship role. &quot;Hydra&quot; was also outfitted as an ambulance ship whereas &quot;Herald&quot; was equipped as a casualty reception station on a par with SS &quot;Uganda&quot;.

A fifth Hecla-class vessel, SAS &quot;Protea&quot; (A324) was ordered by the South African Navy and commissioned on 23 May 1972. As of 2017, &quot;Protea&quot; remains in service.

&quot;Hydra&quot; was sold to Indonesia Navy in 1986 and renamed &quot;KRI Dewa Kembar-932.&quot; As of 2017, &quot;Dewa Kembar&quot; remains in service.

&quot;Hecate&quot; decommissioned in 1990 and was broken up, while &quot;Herald&quot; was finally decommissioned in 2001, and was replaced the same year by .

&quot;Hecla&quot; was paid off in 1997 and sold to an Irish private company, renamed MV Blythe, to be replaced by . In 1969, commanded by Captain David Haslam (who retired after 10 years as Hydrographer in 1985), she landed a party who hoisted the Union Flag on Rockall, which significantly extended the UK&#x27;s territory.

==Nomenclature==
The first three ships in the class were named for the three paddle-wheel &quot;Hydra&quot;-class sloops, two of which ( and ) were fitted out as survey ships from around 1860.

<doc id="676698" wikidata="Q3899395" url="?curid=676698" title="Peppermint Grove, Western Australia">
<text>Peppermint Grove is an affluent western suburb of Perth, Western Australia on the north bank of the Swan River at Freshwater Bay. Its local government area, the smallest in the country, is the Shire of Peppermint Grove. The suburb was named after the Swan River peppermint trees (&quot;Agonis flexuosa&quot;) lining many streets. The suburb has long been associated with Western Australia&#x27;s wealthiest and oldest families. Their prosperity is reflected in the many historical houses in the area, such as &quot;The Cliffe&quot; and the Federation Queen Anne style &quot;St Just&quot;. Colin Barnett, a former Premier of Western Australia, dubbed the suburb &quot;Monaco of WA&quot; due to its small size and concentration of wealth.
It is also known as millionaire’s row and had the highest income of any suburb in Australia in 2022.

==History==
At the time of European settlement and for some years after, the area was thickly wooded with tuart, jarrah, red gum, banksia as well as the peppermint trees which gave the suburb its name.

In 1830, John Butler, an innkeeper, was given a grant of 250 acres (1 km²) on Freshwater Bay, after unsuccessfully attempting to secure land at Claremont. From this location, he operated &quot;The Bush Inn&quot;, a stone house he had built and rigged out with native mahogany, commonly known as jarrah. After a series of arguments with the colonial authorities of the day, Butler left for Sydney in October 1835, but did not dispose of the property.

After the death of Butler&#x27;s wife, Ann, in 1886, a syndicate of businessmen, including Alexander Forrest and George Leake, persuaded Butler&#x27;s children to sell the land. In 1891, it was subdivided and lots were sold for £7 to £12 each. Two of the earliest residents were Edward Vivien Harvey Keane, Lord Mayor of Perth, and John Forrest, Premier of Western Australia. Four years later, residents got a road board, later to become the Peppermint Grove Shire Council – to this day, the smallest in Australia, at .

==Geography==
Peppermint Grove is situated between Stirling Highway on the west and the Swan River at Freshwater Bay to the east. It spans six blocks, with its main streets named after the first post-subdivision residents of the suburb – McNeil, Forrest, Leake, Irvine, Keane, Johnston and Venn.

At the 2016 Australian census, Peppermint Grove had a high-income, mostly British Isles-derived population of 1,636 people living in 613 dwellings. 58% of the residents were female. The ABS noted that 64% of the suburb&#x27;s workforce were professionals or managers (five percentage points less than the 2011 Census).

==Facilities==
Cottesloe Primary School (established 1896) and Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College are located within the suburb, as are the shire council office and the Grove Library on Stirling Highway, a small shopping centre opposite Cottesloe&#x27;s Napoleon Street shopping area, and reserves along the riverfront, most notably Manners Hill Park and Keanes Point Reserve, which offer recreational facilities and jetties.

===The Grove Library===
The Grove Library is funded by the Town of Cottesloe, the Shire of Peppermint Grove and the Town of Mosman Park. It houses the digital Grove Community History Library, which focuses on the people, places and events that have shaped the suburbs of Cottesloe, Peppermint Grove and Mosman Park. It was established in 2006 as a conventional paper-based community collection but became digital in 2011. Much of the collection is available online.

==Churches==
There are two churches in Peppermint Grove: St Columba&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, a Presbyterian church located at the corner of Venn and Keane Streets; and St Mary Star of the Sea, a Roman Catholic church located on Stirling Highway at McNeil Street.

==Transport==
The suburb is serviced by Fremantle to Perth bus services and the CircleRoute bus route along Stirling Highway, and by Cottesloe and Mosman Park railway stations on the Fremantle line. All services are operated by the Public Transport Authority.

=== Bus ===
* 102 Cottesloe Station to Claremont Station – serves Stirling Highway
* 107 Fremantle Station to Claremont Station – serves View Street, Leake Street and Stirling Highway

==Politics==
From 1901 to 1968 and from 1974 to 1980 Peppermint Grove was part of the federal Fremantle electorate, since 1934 a notional Labor seat. Its most prominent member was wartime Prime Minister John Curtin, a Cottesloe resident.

Since 1980 it has been part of the federal division of Curtin. Until 2022, Curtin was regarded as a safe seat for the centre right Liberal Party, which has held the seat continually since its inception, with the exception of a period from 1996 to 1998 when former Liberal member Allan Rocher held the seat as an independent, and from 2022 onwards. In the parliament of Western Australia, its Legislative Assembly electoral district is Cottesloe, held by David Honey, also of the Liberal Party.

<text>Mundaring is a suburb located 34 km east of Perth, Western Australia on the Great Eastern Highway. The suburb is located within the Shire of Mundaring.

The Aboriginal name of the area &quot;Mindah-lung&quot;, said to mean &quot;a high place on a high place&quot;, was anglicised to become &quot;Mundaring&quot;.

The Mundaring area is considered to be part of the Perth Hills area.

==Newspapers==
The Mundaring region is currently well served by weekly and monthly newspapers:
* &quot;Chidlow Chatter&quot;
* &quot;Darlington Review&quot; – locality specific
*&quot;Echo Newspapers&quot; – weekly – Midland based

Former newspapers in the area included:
*&quot;The Darling&quot;
* &quot;Swan Express&quot; – although Midland based, had considerable space to &quot;Hills&quot; stories
**It is also extracted in entries in the J S Battye Library catalogue with items about the Hills.
*&quot;Hills Gazette&quot; (Community Newspaper Group) – weekly 
*&quot;Mundaring magazine&quot; – monthly

==Railway==
The only railway line current in the Mundaring Shire – is the third route of the Eastern Railway which passes through Bellevue and Swan View.
The railway routes mentioned below – first route and second route are no longer operational – and constitute sections of the Railway Reserve Heritage Trail.

The Eastern Railway passed through Mundaring on its first route through to Chidlow. Mundaring railway station, and the branch railway leading from it – the Mundaring Weir branch railway were significant locations for the construction of the Mundaring Weir.
Following the construction of the second route of the Eastern Railway, the Mundaring line served as an alternative to the second route at the time of accidents and derailments, until its 
closing to traffic in 1954.

The line through Mundaring was known as the Mundaring loop to railway administration in its later years of operation, while in earlier years it was known as Smiths Mill branch (the earlier name for Glen Forrest). The line served a small population but played an integral part in the development and history of Mundaring.

The Mundaring Hotel opened opposite the Mundaring railway station in 1899 and served patrons on the route.

==Mundaring Geophysical Observatory==
Mundaring was the location of a Bureau of Mineral Resources Geophysical Observatory from 1959 to April 2000.

The annual reports from the Observatory constituted the seismic record of the state of Western Australia for that period of time as well as reports and summaries of activity.

==Environment==
The town lies within the Mundaring-Kalamunda Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance as a non-breeding season roost site and foraging base for the long-billed black cockatoos.

<text>The Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale is a local government area in the outer southeastern metropolitan area of Perth, the capital of Western Australia, and has an area of and a population of 32,173 as at the 2021 census. Despite being named after two towns in the area, neither Serpentine nor Jarrahdale function as either the Shire&#x27;s largest settlement (Byford) &quot;or&quot; the seat of government (Mundijong).

==History==

The Serpentine-Jarrahdale Road District was established on 8 August 1913 with the amalgamation of the Serpentine Road District (1894) and Jarrahdale Road District (1902).

On 1 July 1961, it became a Shire following the passage of the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires. On 17 June 1977, it acquired Byford from Shire of Armadale–Kelmscott.

Following the 2021 Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale local government election, councillor for the North Ward, Rob Coales, led calls for an investigation into fraud during the election. The motion was passed unainmously.

== Demographics ==
From the 2021 census, the shire had a population of 32,173, with 2.9% being Indigenous. Compared to the national and state median age of 38, the shire&#x27;s median was younger at 33.

==Council==

* North (4 councillors)
* North West (2 councillors)
* Southern (3 councillors)

Elections to fill all positions in these new wards were called for 15 October 2011.

<text>The City of South Perth is a local government area in the inner southern suburbs of the Western Australian capital city of Perth about south of Perth&#x27;s central business district. The City covers an area of , maintains of roads and a little over 4.3 km2 of parks and gardens, and had a population of about 42,000 at the 2016 Census. The City is the entirety of the state electoral district of South Perth. An area of Kensington joined into South Perth after the 2013 redistribution, although dwindling population growth in Victoria Park may mean that part of the City will move back.

The area broadly forms a peninsula, being bounded on three sides by the waters of the Swan and Canning rivers.

== History ==
The South Perth Road District was formed on 9 June 1892 and the district became a municipality as the Municipality of South Perth on 21 February 1902. It then reverted to a road district on 1 March 1922, but regained municipality status on 1 March 1956. It was granted city status on 1 July 1959.

In 2014, the WA State Government mounted a proposal for local government reform; the City of South Perth was proposed to be amalgamated with the Town of Victoria Park, together with a sizable portion of the City of Canning. A poll took place during January–February 2015, with the question: &quot;Should the City of South Perth and the Town of Victoria Park be abolished and amalgamated to form a new local government?&quot;. The informally (non-binding) suggested name for the new entity was &#x27;City of South Park&#x27;.

In order for the poll to prevent the amalgamation from proceeding, at least 50% of electors from either local government were required to vote, and of those, more than half needed to vote against the proposal. At the conclusion of the poll at 6.00pm on 7 February 2015, the outcome was that for South Perth, 50.83% of the City&#x27;s 26,789 electors voted, with 77.75% voting against the proposal. Although only 38.02% of the Town of Victoria Park&#x27;s 20,136 electors voted, of those, a clear majority (61.58%) voted against the proposal. However, with more than 50% poll returns, the City of South Perth response was sufficient to cancel the amalgamation of these local governments, and they remained as separate entities.

== Wards ==
The City of South Perth is divided into four wards, each of whom directly elect two councillors.

<text>Subiaco (known colloquially as Subi) is an inner-western suburb of Perth, the capital of Western Australia. It is approximately west of Perth&#x27;s central business district, in the City of Subiaco local government area. Historically a working-class suburb containing a mixture of industrial and commercial land uses, since the 1990s the area has been one of Australia&#x27;s most celebrated urban redevelopment projects. It remains a predominantly low-rise, urban village neighbourhood centred around Subiaco train station and Rokeby Road.

The suburb has three schools: Subiaco Primary School, Perth Modern School, which is the state&#x27;s only fully academically selective public school, and Bob Hawke College. Landmarks in Subiaco include Subiaco Oval, which formerly was the largest stadium in Western Australia, King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women, and Subiaco railway station.

==Geography==
Subiaco is located approximately west of the central business district (CBD) of Perth, the capital and largest city of the state of Western Australia. Subiaco is east of the Indian Ocean, and north of the Swan River. It is bounded to the south-east by Thomas Street, to the south by Nicholson Road, to the west by Railway Road, Hay Street, Tighe Street, Upham Street and Bishop Street, and to the north by Salvado Road and Railway Parade, except for a small part covering St John of God Subiaco Hospital protruding north to Cambridge Street. To the north is Wembley and West Leederville. To the east is West Perth and Kings Park. To the south is Shenton Park. To the west is Daglish and Jolimont, Western Australia.

Subiaco lies on Spearwood Dunes, which formed around 40,000 years ago. The dunes consist of brown sand lying over yellow subsoil, with Tamala Limestone below. These dunes are part of the greater Swan Coastal Plain.

==History==
===Early history===
Prior to European settlement, the area was inhabited by the Mooro group of the Whadjuk Noongar people. They were led by Yellagonga and inhabited the area north of the Swan River, as far east as Ellen Brook and north to Moore River.

In 1829, the Swan River Colony (the precursor to Western Australia) was founded by the British. Initial development of the colony was slow, and settlement followed the coast and the Swan River. In January 1846, a group of missionaries led by John Brady, the first Catholic Bishop of Perth, arrived at the port of Fremantle. Among them were Joseph Benedict Serra and Rosendo Salvado, two Spanish Benedictine monks. 

Brady decided to establish three missions in regional area. In 1846 or 1847, the Catholic Church acquired two lots of land near Herdsman Lake, north of the modern day Subiaco. In 1849, Serra replaced Brady. He then decided to establish a monastery near Perth, selecting the land near Herdsman Lake. It was named the Benedictine Monastery of New Subiaco, after Subiaco, Italy, where the Benedictines were established. Starting in 1857, the monks began to leave for the monastic town of New Norcia. The last monks left in 1864. In the early 1870s, the St Vincent’s Boy’s Orphanage started occupying the former monastery. The only buildings remaining of the monastery today are the heritage-listed Benedictine Stables, on Barrett Street in Wembley.

In the 1860s and 1870s, investors began buying land in the area, speculating that a railway line would be built eventually. In 1871, a railway line between Fremantle and Guildford was first proposed, following on from the success of railways in Sydney and Melbourne. In 1874, two possible routes were suggested: one traveling north of the Swan River, and one travelling south of the river. In July 1878, the northern route was chosen. Construction on the railway began in 1879, and it was opened on 1 March 1881, as the Fremantle to Guildford railway line. The first station in Subiaco opened in 1883, as just a basic siding, east of the present day Subiaco railway station, at Salvado Road. The station was used to deliver goods, and serve the St Vincent’s Boy’s Orphanage. As more people started living along the line though, the station started serving as a passenger station for the general public.

In the 1880s and 1890s, Western Australia experienced several gold rushes, causing a rapid increase in population across Perth. On 13 March 1883, the Government of Western Australia announced it would survey an area of commonage to create suburban lots, to put up for sale. This covered the area bounded by Thomas Street, Aberdare Road, and the railway line, taking up most of Subiaco, and part of Shenton Park. The land was surveyed by Gilbert H. Rotton, who set out the streets in a traditional grid pattern, with large lots. The area north of Roberts Road (known then as Mueller Road) was retained by the government, for a school, recreation, and future purposes. The first auction occurred in November 1883. Most of the land was sold over the following two years. A separate piece of land, between Subiaco Road and the railway line, was subdivided and sold too.

===Development===
In 1886, the construction of Subiaco&#x27;s first house started. It was built on Mueller Road, near Rokeby Road, by reporter, editor and former convict John Rowland Jones. It was named &quot;Jones&#x27; Folly&quot;, due to the time it took to construct, and its isolation. The building was demolished in 1959. Several wealthy land developers from the eastern colonies of Australia purchased lots in Subiaco, and subdivided them further, creating new streets to serve the smaller lots. Many of the lots they sold were to new arrivals in Western Australia in the 1890s, who had come due to the gold rushes. Many of these people came from Victoria, and were working class, young couples, with small children. These people built makeshift structures on their lots, such as tents and tin shacks. Later that decade, houses, mostly made of timber, were erected in stages at a time. In 1895, the population of the area was 100. By mid-1896, it was 1300.

1896 saw the establishment of several services in Subiaco. The first school opened that year, albeit permanent buildings were only complete in 1897. The school officially opened on 12 May 1897. A post office opened as well in 1896. These two services were built on Rokeby Road, as that was the first road to be macadamised. The macadamisation in part caused Rokeby Road to become the commercial centre of Subiaco. The Subiaco Progress Association was established in 1896. They lobbied for the formation of the Subiaco Road District, which was then created on 10 April 1896. The first chairman of the Subiaco Road Board was Charles Hart, who was Secretary of the Subiaco Progress Association. By the end of 1896, the population of the Subiaco Road District was above 2000, allowing the Road Board to apply to become a municipality. The government granted the request, and so the Municipality of Subiaco was gazetted on 26 March 1897.

Several churches were built in the mid- to late-1890s. A Methodist Church was opened in November 1896. A Presbyterian Church was opened the following year, and an Anglican Church opened in 1898. Around 1900, a Church of Christ building opened.

Sports clubs were formed as well. Subiaco Football Club and Subiaco Cricket Club formed in 1897. The council leased of land near Townshend Road and Railway Road for sports use. At first, the land was not suitable for this use, so these clubs used Dyson&#x27;s Swamp in Shenton Park until 1908. The original land was vested in the Municipality of Subiaco in 1904, and named Mueller Park, after German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller, in 1906. It was then made into a suitable ground for sports, with the Subiaco Football Club playing their first match there in May 1908. By the end of 1909, there was a grandstand at the oval, which was named Subiaco Oval. Further facilities came after, including grounds for tennis, croquet and lawn bowls. Mueller Park was renamed to Kitchener Park in 1916, due to anti-German sentiment.

Around 1897, Subiaco railway station was relocated from Salvado Road to the northern end of Rokeby Road, further entrenching that road as Subiaco&#x27;s main street. Around 1898, the Subiaco Hotel was constructed, and in 1899, a permanent building for the Municipality of Subiaco council was constructed, on a site next to the primary school. In 1901, a fire station on the same block was completed. This cluster of facilities led to the block being named Civic Square. The Subiaco council moved to a newer and larger building, still in Civic Square, in 1909.

Around 1905, the Municipality was given of endowment land to use, located north of the railway line and south of Salvado Road. The council held a competition for the design of a subdivision on the land. Architect George Temple Poole won the competition. The land then became an industrial area. The land was first leased in 1905, and factories were subsequently built on the land, including a timber and construction materials factory, and a foundry and ironworks.

By 1906, 4500 street trees had been planted by the municipality, establishing Subiaco as one of Perth&#x27;s leafiest suburbs. This was initiated by inaugural Town Clerk and Engineer Alexander Rankin. Ken Spillman wrote in his book that Rankin has a &quot;near obsession with beautifying the municipality&quot;.

In 1909, the first stage of a new children&#x27;s hospital opened, on Thomas Street, at the eastern end of Subiaco. This hospital was named Princess Margaret Hospital for Children in 1949. Following the opening of the children&#x27;s hospital, women&#x27;s organisations began to lobby for a public maternity hospital to be constructed in Perth. As a result, the King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women opened in 1916, at the western end of Subiaco.

In 1911, Perth Modern School opened, as the state&#x27;s first government funded high school. Demand for spots at the school was so great that prospective students had to pass an examination to get in. This practice continued, even after other schools opened in Perth, until it became a comprehensive school in 1959.

On 9 January 1912, the Workers&#x27; Home Board Act passed the Parliament of Western Australia, causing the formation of the Workers&#x27; Homes Board, which was the state&#x27;s first public housing organisation. The government bought land in Subiaco to use as public housing. At a ceremony on 29 August 1912, John Scaddan, the Premier of Western Australia, placed the first brick to be laid by the Workers&#x27; Homes Board, at a construction site on Hensman Road, Subiaco.

Following World War I, population growth in Subiaco slowed. Residents and the Subiaco Council entered into financial hardship. The major growth that occurred in Subiaco in the 1920s was the industrial area. In November 1922, the council began construction on a World War I memorial clock tower. Despite initially being conceived as mostly community funded, the Subiaco council funded the majority of the memorial, after fundraising efforts did poorly. It officially opened on 25 November 1923. This decade also saw the return to the council&#x27;s focus on beautification. A council nursery was established at Kitchener Park in 1921.

In 1924, Daglish railway station opened on the south-western edge of Subiaco. It was named after the former Mayor of Subiaco, Premier of Western Australia, and member for Subiaco, Henry Daglish.

In 1927, the Subiaco post office relocated from Civic Square to a larger building on the corner of Rokeby Road and Park Street. This led to the council establishing a library in the old post office.

In 1936, Subiaco Oval became the headquarters of the Western Australian Football League (WAFL), of which the Subiaco Football Club is a part, and more grandstands were constructed. That same year, the WAFL Grand Final was played at Subiaco Oval for the first time. Subiaco became the home of Australian rules football in Western Australia.

===Post World War II===
By the late 1940s, the Municipality of Subiaco had reached a high enough population that it was eligible to become a city. Under the &quot;Municipal Corporations Act 1906&quot;, a municipality can become a city if its population is greater than 20,000, and its annual revenue is greater than £20,000. The municipality&#x27;s population in 1952 was 20,100. Thus, on 8 February 1952, the City of Subiaco was gazetted. In celebration of becoming a city, a parade was staged along Hay Street and Rokeby Road on 20 September 1952. It started at Kitchener Park, and ending at the corner of Rokeby and Heytesbury roads. Thousands of people from Subiaco and across Perth attended; Mayor Joseph Abrahams said that it was &quot;the greatest assembly of citizens Subiaco has seen&quot;.

By the late 1940s, many of Subiaco&#x27;s older buildings were rundown and needing significant repairs, giving the suburb a bad image. The newer, nearby suburbs of Daglish and parts of Shenton Park were mostly owner-occupied, compared to Subiaco, where most properties were rentals. The council encouraged renovations, but this had little effect. Across the 1950s and 1960s, demolition of older homes was common in Subiaco. The benefits of demolition were seen as better than renovating. In the mid 1950s, the Wandana State Housing Complex was built in Subiaco. The 10 storey building was the first high rise state housing block in Perth, and one of the first in Australia. The construction of other apartment blocks followed.

The 1950s also brought about an increase in commercial activity in Subiaco. New businesses were built, particularly along Hay Street and Rokeby Road. New commercial buildings were functional in design, with little detailing, which contrasted with older buildings. Mayor Joseph Abrahams said in 1954 that &quot;within the period of one year the appearance of both Hay Street and Rokeby Road has altered considerably&quot;. Due to the increasing use of cars, tramways closed across Perth in the 1950s. The last tram through Subiaco was on 19 April 1958. A lack of car parking in Subiaco&#x27;s commercial areas became a problem. In the early 1960s, the council purchased a property in the town centre to provide parking. This opened in April 1962. Two more car parks were built over the following years. 

Modernisation upgrades occurred during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Roads, footpaths, parks and sporting grounds were improved. A new council building opened in 1968. The original, 1899 council building was demolished. In 1971, a new library was opened.

The need to preserve historic structures was recognised more in the 1970s. The Subiaco Historical Society was formed in 1973. The society opened a museum at Civic Square in 1975. The council put in place policies to preserve heritage in Subiaco. More and more people saw the renovation of old buildings as an option, and developments grew more sympathetic to existing structures. This continued across the following decades.

In 1979, the Perth to Fremantle railway line closed, drawing protest. The council and residents celebrated when it was reinstated in 1983. In 1981, part of Kitchener Park was renamed back to Mueller Park.

===Redevelopment===
Increasing land values across the second half of the 20th century for inner city areas of Perth and the acquisition of smaller businesses by large companies saw the rise of the large, outer suburban industrial areas of Kwinana and Welshpool, at the expense of Subiaco&#x27;s industrial area. Across the 1970s and 1980s, much land in this area was vacated. The City of Subiaco and the State Government saw an opportunity to redevelop this land into an urban village. The &quot;Subiaco Redevelopment Act 1994&quot; was passed by parliament, forming the Subiaco Redevelopment Authority. The project was called &quot;Subi Centro&quot; As part of the redevelopment, the Fremantle line was put in a cut-and-cover tunnel for , and a new underground Subiaco station was built. This also opened up of land for the redevelopment project. A town square around the station was built, named Subiaco Square. The square and the station opened in December 1998. As of 2014, 86% of the redevelopment has been completed. The state government later dissolved the Subiaco Redevelopment Authority, handing back planning control to the City of Subiaco.

In October 2020, the state government finalised the &quot;Subi East&quot; redevelopment plan, to follow the demolition of the Subiaco Oval stadium and Princess Margaret Hospital after their closures in 2017 and 2018 respectively. The plan will see the creation of a new residential urban village in the north-east of the suburb.

==Landmarks==

Landmarks of suburb include Subiaco Oval, Mueller Park, the Regal Theatre, the Subiaco Hotel, the Victorian terraces on Catherine Street and the Subiaco Arts Centre.

The main street of Subiaco is Rokeby Road, which was named after General Henry Montagu, 6th Baron Rokeby, who was commander of the 1st Division during the Crimean War. Another important commercial road is Hay Street.

Residential areas include Subi Centro, a modern housing development with the sunken Subiaco railway station on reclaimed industrial land near Wembley, and older heritage properties towards Shenton Park.

Major hospital facilities include St John of God Subiaco Hospital and King Edward Memorial Hospital for Women.

On the corner of Rokeby and Hamersley Roads is a clock tower war memorial, built in 1923 to commemorate soldiers from the district who died in World War I. The names of those who died in later conflicts have also been added.

== Architecture ==
Subiaco has a large number of well-preserved high-quality historic homes, many with elaborate leadlight windows. Many houses in Subiaco are heritage listed, which recognises their cultural significance and ensures that any changes preserve their unique characteristics. The City of Subiaco publishes a self-guide walking tour of some of them. From 1989 until 2006 a Festival of Leadlights community event was run biennially. It was restarted in 2018.

== Culture ==
Each year, the City of Subiaco supports a boutique street festival where Rokeby Road is closed off from traffic between Barker Road and Hay Street. It is commonly referred to as the &quot;Subiaco Street Party&quot; and is a free community event that promotes live music, street food, markets and family entertainment.

<text>Marvin D. Girardeau (3 October 1930 – 13 January 2015) was a quantum physicist, and a faculty member in the Institute for Theoretical Science at the University of Oregon, where he was hired as a professor in 1963 and worked until his retirement in 2000, after which he became a research professor at the University of Arizona. He was a mathematical physicist with an unusual nonlinear career, which culminated in a remarkable impact in the ultracold atom physics community. One of Girardeau&#x27;s achievements was to predict the existence of the Tonks–Girardeau gas in 1960. A Tonks–Girardeau gas was created in 2004, and its measured properties strikingly confirmed Girardeau&#x27;s original predictions.

His research interests included the dynamics of ultracold atomic vapour confined in tight de Broglie waveguides; and the behaviour of identical particles including fermions, bosons, and anyons.

Girardeau was a fellow of the American Physical Society, and winner of the 1984 Humboldt Prize. His 1984-86 tenure at the Max Planck Institut für Strahlenchemie, Mühlheim/Ruhr, Germany, followed. In 2013, Marvin was nominated for a prestigious Senior BEC Award by the European Community.

<text>Medical tourism is the practice of traveling abroad to obtain medical treatment. In the past, this usually referred to those who traveled from less-developed countries to major medical centers in highly developed countries for treatment unavailable at home. However, in recent years it may equally refer to those from developed countries who travel to developing countries for lower-priced medical treatments. With differences between the medical agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA), etc., which decide whether a drug is approved in their country or region, or not, the motivation may be also for medical services unavailable or non-licensed in the home country.

Medical tourism most often is for surgeries (cosmetic or otherwise) or similar treatments, though people also travel for dental tourism or fertility tourism. People with rare conditions may travel to countries where the treatment is better understood. However, almost all types of health care are available, including psychiatry, alternative medicine, convalescent care, and even burial services.

Health tourism is a wider term for travel that focuses on medical treatments and the use of healthcare services. It covers a wide field of health-oriented tourism ranging from preventive and health-conductive treatment to rehabilitational and curative forms of travel. Wellness tourism is a related field.

==History==
The first recorded instance of people traveling for medical treatment dates back thousands of years to when Greek pilgrims traveled from the eastern Mediterranean to a small area in the Saronic Gulf called Epidauria. This territory was the sanctuary of the healing god Asklepios.

Spa towns and sanitaria were early forms of medical tourism. In 18th-century Europe patients visited spas because they were places with supposedly health-giving mineral waters, treating diseases from gout to liver disorders and bronchitis.

==Description==
Factors that have led to the increasing popularity of medical travel include the high cost of health care, long wait times for certain procedures, the ease and affordability of international travel, and improvements in both technology and standards of care in many countries. The avoidance of waiting times is the leading factor for medical tourism from the UK, whereas in the US, the main reason is cheaper prices abroad. Furthermore, death rates even in the developed countries differ extremely.

Many surgical procedures performed in medical tourism destinations cost a fraction of the price they do in other countries. For example, in the United States, a liver transplant that may cost US$300,000, would generally cost about US$91,000 in Taiwan. A large draw to medical travel is convenience and speed. Countries that operate public health-care systems often have long wait times for certain operations, for example, an estimated 782,936 Canadian patients spent an average waiting time of 9.4 weeks on medical waiting lists in 2005. Canada has also set waiting time benchmarks for non-urgent medical procedures, including a 26-week waiting period for a hip replacement and a 16-week wait for cataract surgery.

In developed countries such as the United States, medical tourism has large growth prospects and potentially destabilizing implications. A forecast by Deloitte Consulting published in August 2008 projected that medical tourism originating in the US could jump by a factor of ten over the next decade. An estimated 750,000 Americans went abroad for health care in 2007, and the report estimated that 1.5 million would seek health care outside the US in 2008. The growth in medical tourism has the potential to cost US health care providers billions of dollars in lost revenue.

Manish Chandra, Co founder of Vaidam Health stated that &quot; Medical tourism is a rapidly expanding sector within India&#x27;s healthcare industry, offering immense potential. Over the years, a significant number of people have traveled across continents seeking medical care due to factors such as cost-effectiveness, faster and more efficient services, specialized healthcare, and advanced treatment options that may not be available in their home countries. Industry reports indicate that India&#x27;s healthcare industry is projected to reach $280 billion by 2020, which will likely enhance the quality and scope of medical treatment offered by hospitals&quot;.

An authority at the Harvard Business School stated that &quot;medical tourism is promoted much more heavily in the United Kingdom than in the United States&quot;.

Additionally, some patients in some First World countries are finding that insurance either does not cover orthopedic surgery (such as knee or hip replacement) or limits the choice of the facility, surgeon, or prosthetics to be used.

Popular medical travel worldwide destinations include: Canada, Cuba, Costa Rica, India, Israel, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United States.

Popular destinations for cosmetic surgery include: Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Greece, India, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, South Korea, South Africa, Turkey and Thailand. 

Some people travel for assisted pregnancy, such as in-vitro fertilization, or surrogacy, or freezing embryos for retro-production.

However, perceptions of medical tourism are not always positive. In places like the US, which has high standards of quality, medical tourism is viewed as risky. In some parts of the world, wider political issues can influence where medical tourists will choose to seek out health care.

Medical tourism providers have developed as intermediaries which unite potential medical tourists with surgeons, provider hospitals and other organizations. In some cases, surgeons from the United States have signed up with medical tourism providers to travel to Mexico to treat American patients. The hope is that using an American surgeon may alleviate concerns about going outside the country, and persuade self-insured American employers to offer this cost-effective option to their workers as a way to save money while still provide high-quality care. Companies that focus on medical value travel typically provide nurse case managers to assist patients with pre- and post-travel medical issues. They may also help provide resources for follow-up care upon the patient&#x27;s return.

Circumvention tourism is also an area of medical tourism that has grown. Circumvention tourism is travel in order to access medical services that are legal in the destination country but illegal in the home country. This can include travel for fertility treatments that are not yet approved in the home country, abortion, and doctor-assisted suicide. Abortion tourism can be found most commonly in Europe, where travel between countries is relatively simple. Poland, a European country with highly restrictive abortion laws, has one of the highest rates of circumvention tourism, as did Ireland before abortion was made legal in 2018. In Poland especially, it is estimated that each year nearly 7,000 women travel to the UK, where abortion services are free through the National Health Service. There are also efforts being made by independent organizations and doctors, such as with Women on Waves, to help women circumvent laws in order to access medical services. With Women on Waves, the organization uses a mobile clinic aboard a ship to provide medical abortions in international waters, where the law of the country whose flag is flown applies.

Dental tourism is travel for cheaper dentistry or oral surgery. The same porcelain veneer made in a lab in Sweden can be as much as 2500 AUD in Australia, but only 1200 AUD in India. The price difference here is not explainable by reference to the material cost.

==International healthcare accreditation==
International healthcare accreditation is the process of certifying a level of quality for healthcare providers and programs across multiple countries. International healthcare accreditation organizations certify a wide range of healthcare programs such as hospitals, primary care centers, medical transport, and ambulatory care services. There are a number of accreditation schemes available based in a number of different countries around the world.

The oldest international accrediting body is Accreditation Canada, formerly known as the Canadian Council on Health Services Accreditation, which accredited the Bermuda Hospital Board as soon as 1968. Since then, it has accredited hospitals and health service organizations in ten other countries.
In the United States, the accreditation group Joint Commission International (JCI) was formed in 1994 to provide international clients education and consulting services. Many international hospitals today see obtaining international accreditation as a way to attract American patients.

Joint Commission International is a relative of the Joint Commission in the United States. Both are US-style independent private sector not-for-profit organizations that develop nationally and internationally recognized procedures and standards to help improve patient care and safety. They work with hospitals to help them meet Joint Commission standards for patient care and then accredit those hospitals meeting the standards.

A British scheme, QHA Trent Accreditation, is an active independent holistic accreditation scheme, as well as GCR.org which monitors the success metrics and standards of almost 500,000 medical clinics worldwide.

The different international healthcare accreditation schemes vary in quality, size, cost, intent and the skill and intensity of their marketing. They also vary in terms of cost to hospitals and healthcare institutions making use of them.

Increasingly, some hospitals are looking towards dual international accreditation, perhaps having both JCI to cover potential US clientele, and Accreditation Canada or QHA Trent. As a result of competition between clinics for American medical tourists, there have been initiatives to rank hospitals based on patient-reported metrics.

==Risks and criticism==
Medical tourism carries some risks that locally provided medical care either does not carry or carries to a much lesser degree.

Some countries, such as South Africa, or Thailand have very different infectious disease-related epidemiology to Europe and North America. Exposure to diseases without having built up natural immunity can be a hazard for weakened individuals, specifically with respect to gastrointestinal diseases (e.g. hepatitis A, amoebic dysentery, paratyphoid) which could weaken progress and expose the patient to mosquito-transmitted diseases, influenza, and tuberculosis. However, because in poor tropical nations diseases run the gamut, doctors seem to be more open to the possibility of considering any infectious disease, including HIV, TB, and typhoid, while there are cases in the Western world where patients were consistently misdiagnosed for years because such diseases are perceived to be &quot;rare&quot; in the West.

The quality of post-operative care can also vary dramatically, depending on the hospital and country, and may be different from US or European standards. Also, traveling long distances soon after surgery can increase the risk of complications. Long flights and decreased mobility associated with window seats can predispose one towards developing deep vein thrombosis and potentially a pulmonary embolism. Other vacation activities can be problematic as well — for example, scars may become darker and more noticeable if they are sunburned while healing.

Also, health facilities treating medical tourists may lack an adequate complaints policy to deal appropriately and fairly with complaints made by dissatisfied patients.

Differences in healthcare provider standards around the world have been recognized by the World Health Organization, and in 2004 it launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety. This body assists hospitals and government around the world in setting patient safety policy and practices that can become particularly relevant when providing medical tourism services.

Patients traveling to countries with less stringent surgical standards may be at higher risk for complications. If there are complications, the patient may need to stay in the foreign country for longer than planned or if they have returned home, will not have easy access to follow up care.

Patients sometimes travel to another country to obtain medical procedures that doctors in their home country refuse to perform because they believed that the risks of the procedure outweigh the benefits. Such patients may have difficulty getting insurance (whether public or private) to cover follow up medical costs should the feared complications indeed arise.

===Legal issues===
Receiving medical care abroad may subject medical tourists to unfamiliar legal issues. The limited nature of litigation in various countries is a reason for accessibility of care overseas. While some countries currently presenting themselves as attractive medical tourism destinations provide some form of legal remedies for medical malpractice, these legal avenues may be unappealing to the medical tourist. Should problems arise, patients might not be covered by adequate personal insurance or might be unable to seek compensation via malpractice lawsuits. Hospitals and/or doctors in some countries may be unable to pay the financial damages awarded by a court to a patient who has sued them, owing to the hospital and/or the doctor not possessing appropriate insurance cover and/or medical indemnity.

Issues can also arise for patients who seek out services that are illegal in their home country. In this case, some countries have the jurisdiction to prosecute their citizen once they have returned home, or in extreme cases extraterritorially arrest and prosecute. In Ireland, especially, in the 1980s-90s there were cases of young rape victims who were banned from traveling to Europe to get legal abortions. Ultimately, Ireland&#x27;s Supreme Court overturned the ban; they and many other countries have since created &quot;right to travel&quot; amendments.

===Ethical issues===
There can be major ethical issues around medical tourism. For example, the illegal purchase of organs and tissues for transplantation had been methodically documented and studied in countries such as China, Pakistan, Colombia and the Philippines. The Declaration of Istanbul distinguishes between ethically problematic &quot;transplant tourism&quot; and &quot;travel for transplantation&quot;.

Medical tourism may raise broader ethical issues for the countries in which it is promoted. For example, in India, some argue that a &quot;policy of &quot;medical tourism for the classes and health missions for the masses&quot; will lead to a deepening of the inequities&quot; already embedded in the health care system. In Thailand, in 2008 it was stated that, &quot;Doctors in Thailand have become so busy with foreigners that Thai patients are having trouble getting care&quot;. Medical tourism centered on new technologies, such as stem cell treatments, is often criticized on grounds of fraud, blatant lack of scientific rationale and patient safety. However, when pioneering advanced technologies, such as providing &quot;unproven&quot; therapies to patients outside of regular clinical trials, it is often challenging to differentiate between acceptable medical innovation and unacceptable patient exploitation.

=== Medical volunteerism as tourism ===
The field of the medical tourism (referring to volunteers who travel overseas to deliver medical care) has recently attracted negative criticism when compared to the alternative notion of sustainable capacities, i.e., work done in the context of long-term, locally-run, and foreign-supported infrastructures. A preponderance of this criticism appears largely in scientific and peer-reviewed literature. Recently, media outlets with more general readerships have published such criticisms as well.

== Employer-sponsored health care in the US ==
Some US employers have begun exploring medical travel programs as a way to cut employee health care costs. Such proposals have raised stormy debates between employers and trade unions representing workers, with one union stating that it deplored the &quot;shocking new approach&quot; of offering employees overseas treatment in return for a share of the company&#x27;s savings. The unions also raise the issues of legal liability should something go wrong, and potential job losses in the US health care industry if treatment is outsourced.

Employers may offer incentives such as paying for air travel and waiving out-of-pocket expenses for care outside of the US. For example, in January 2008, Hannaford Bros., a supermarket chain based in Maine, began paying the entire medical bill for employees to travel to Singapore for hip and knee replacements, including travel for the patient and companion. Medical travel packages can integrate with all types of health insurance, including limited benefit plans, preferred provider organizations and high deductible health plans.

In 2000, Blue Shield of California began the United States&#x27; first cross-border health plan. Patients in California could travel to one of the three certified hospitals in Mexico for treatment under California Blue Shield. In 2007, a subsidiary of BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina, Companion Global Healthcare, teamed up with hospitals in Thailand, Singapore, Turkey, Ireland, Costa Rica and India. A 2008 article in &quot;Fast Company&quot; discusses the globalization of healthcare and describes how various players in the US healthcare market have begun to explore it.

== Impact of COVID-19 on medical tourism ==

The growth of Global Medical Tourism in the last decade has influenced overall growth of health care sector. Due to the multidimensional impact of the Pandemic COVID-19 in the form of a global healthcare crisis, falling global economy, restricted international travel, the medical tourism industry is undergoing a substantial decline.

The CDC has listed various levels of different destinations or countries that are ranked from 1 to 3, with 1 and 2 considered safe to travel. A destination ranked level-3 is considered a warning not to travel to that area.

=== COVID-19 vaccine tourism ===
In the later half of February 2021, it was reported that wealthy and influential people from Canada and European countries flew to the United Arab Emirates to secure early access to the COVID-19 vaccine. The UAE promoted Dubai as a vaccine holiday hub for the wealthy, who could pay large sums of money to get inoculated before they became eligible in their home countries.

In January 2021, Canadian snowbirds traveled to the United States (specifically Florida and Arizona) via air charter for quicker access to the COVID-19 vaccine.

== Destinations ==

===Africa and the Middle East===
====Iran====
In 2012, 30,000 people came to Iran to receive medical treatment.
In 2015, it is estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 health tourists came to Iran, and this figure is expected to rise to 500,000 a year. Iran medical services are low cost in the fields of cosmetic and plastic surgeries, infertility treatment and dentistry services. According to a report in 2016 by Big Market Research, the global medical tourism market is expected to reach $143 billion by 2022. It was reported in May that the number of tourists traveling to Iran for advanced medical services has grown by 40% over past five years.

====Israel====

Israel is a popular destination for medical tourism. Many medical tourists to Israel come from Europe, particularly the former Soviet Union, as well as the United States, Australia, Cyprus, and South Africa. Medical tourists come to Israel for a variety of surgical procedures and therapies, including bone marrow transplants, heart surgery, and catheterization, oncological and neurological treatments, orthopedic procedures, car accident rehabilitation, and in-vitro fertilization. Israel&#x27;s popularity as a destination for medical tourism stems from its status as a developed country with a high-quality level of medical care, while at the same time having lower medical costs than many other developed countries. Israel is particularly popular as a destination for bone marrow transplants among Cypriots, as the procedure is not available in Cyprus, and for orthopedic procedures among Americans, as the cost of orthopedic procedures in Israel is about half that of in the United States. Israel is a particularly popular destination for people seeking IVF treatments. Medical tourists in Israel use both public and private hospitals, and all major Israeli hospitals offer medical tourism packages which typically cost far less than comparable procedures than in facilities elsewhere with a similarly high standard of care. In 2014, it was estimated that roughly 50,000 medical tourists came to Israel annually. There are reports that these medical tourists obtain preferential treatment, to the detriment of local patients. In addition, some people come to Israel to visit health resorts at the Dead Sea, and on Lake Kinneret.

====Jordan====
Jordan, through their Private Hospitals Association, attracted 250,000 international patients accompanied by more than 500,000 companions in 2012, with total revenues exceeding 1B US$. Jordan won the Medical Destination of the year award in 2014 in the IMTJ Medical Travel Awards.

====South Africa====
South Africa is the first country in Africa to emerge as a medical tourism destination.

====Tunisia====
On the African scale, Tunisia ranks second in the field of health tourism. It is also named the world&#x27;s second best thalassotherapy destination, behind France.

====United Arab Emirates====
United Arab Emirates, especially Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Ras Al Khaimah is a popular destination for medical tourism. The Dubai Health authority has been spearheading medical tourism into UAE, especially Dubai. However, hospitals providing medical tourism are spread all over the seven emirates. UAE has the distinction of having the maximum number of JCI accredited hospitals (under various heads). UAE has inbound medical tourism as well as people going out for medical treatment. The inbound tourism usually is from African countries like Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, etc. The outbound can be categorized into two segments - the local population (citizens of UAE) and the expats. The locals prefer to go to European destinations like the UK, Germany etc. The expats prefer to go back to their home countries for treatment.

===Americas===
====Brazil====
In Brazil, Albert Einstein Hospital in São Paulo was the first JCI-accredited facility outside of the US, and more than a dozen Brazilian medical facilities have since been similarly accredited.

====Canada====
In comparison to US health costs, patients can save 30 to 60 percent on health costs in Canada.

In the early 1990s, Americans illegally using counterfeit, borrowed, or fraudulently obtained Canadian health insurance cards to obtain free healthcare in Canada became a serious issue due to the high costs it imposed.

====Costa Rica====
In Costa Rica, there are two Joint Commission International accredited (JCI) hospitals. Both are in San Jose, Costa Rica. When the World Health Organization (WHO) ranked the world&#x27;s health systems in the year 2000, Costa Rica was ranked as no. 26, which was higher than the US, and together with Dominica it dominated the list among the Central American countries.

The Deloitte Center for Health Solutions in 2008 reported a cost savings average of between 30 and 70 percent of US prices. In 2019 a knee operation in Clinica Biblica which would have cost around $44,000 in the USA cost $12,200.

====Cayman Islands====
====Cuba====
====Dominican Republic====
The Dominican Republic has been a popular destination for US medical tourists, because it is fairly close. Since 2003, the CDC has reported adverse events after cosmetic surgery, particularly due to liposuction in combination with gluteal fat transfer, abdominoplasty, and breast augmentation. During 2009–2022, 93 U.S. citizens died after cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic, and 90% of autopsy-confirmed deaths were due to embolism; in 55% due to fat embolism and in 35% due to pulmonary venous thromboembolism.

====Mexico====

Mexico has 98 hospitals accredited by the country&#x27;s Federal Health Ministry and seven hospitals which are JCI-accredited. Mexico is most reputed for advanced care in dentistry and cosmetic surgery.

In recent years, Los Algodones, Baja California, a settlement of fewer than 6,000 people located on the US border near Yuma, Arizona, has become a major destination for Americans and Canadians seeking dental services. Roughly 600 dentists practice in the community, catering mainly to tourists, leading the community to be nicknamed &quot;Molar City&quot;.

====United States====

A 2015 report from the United States International Trade Commission found that between 150,000 and 320,000 medical tourists from the United States were traveling worldwide for the purpose of receiving in-patient medical care. While some have estimated that 750,000 American medical tourists traveled from the United States to other countries in 2007 (up from 500,000 in 2006), according to the McKinsey report, 45% of North American medical tourists travel to Asia, 26% go to Latin America, 2% go to the Middle East, and 27% travel to another country in North America. None travel to Europe.

The availability of advanced medical technology and sophisticated training of physicians are cited as driving motivators for growth in foreigners traveling to the US for medical care, whereas the low costs for hospital stays and major/complex procedures at Western-accredited medical facilities abroad are cited as major motivators for American travelers. Also, the decline in value of the US dollar between 2007 and 2013 used to offer additional incentives for foreign travel to the US, although cost differences between the US and many locations in Asia are larger than any currency fluctuations.

Several major medical centers and teaching hospitals offer international patient centers that cater to patients from foreign countries who seek medical treatment in the US. Many of these organizations offer service coordinators to assist international patients with arrangements for medical care, accommodations, finances and transportation including air ambulance services.

===Asia and the Pacific Islands===

====India====
Medical tourism is a growing sector in India. India is becoming the 2nd medical tourism destination after Thailand. Gurgaon is India&#x27;s largest Medical Tourism hub, followed by Chennai, which is regarded as &quot;India&#x27;s Health City&quot; as it attracts 45% of health tourists visiting India and 40% of domestic health tourists.

India&#x27;s medical tourism sector was expected to experience an annual growth rate of 30% from 2012, making it a $2 billion industry by 2015.

In August 2019, the Indian government made it easier for foreigners to receive medical treatment without necessarily applying for a medical visa. These initiatives by Indian government are help Medical Tourism market to reach around $9 Billion in 2020. Furthermore, the major reason for foreign tourist to choose India is because it has 40 hospitals accredited by the US Joint Commission.

As medical treatment costs in the developed world balloon—with the United States leading the way—more and more Westerners are finding the prospect of international travel for medical care increasingly appealing. An estimated 150,000 of these travel to India for low-priced healthcare procedures every year.

India is increasingly becoming popular with Africans seeking medical treatment overseas. Treatments are approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Food and Drug Administration.

The Government has also started various initiative that can be of great push to help international patients get the right kind of treatment at affordable prices.

In 2008, Indonesians comprised 75% of all foreign patients receiving care in Malaysia; Europeans, 3%; Japanese, 3%; Singaporeans, 1% and citizens from Middle Eastern countries, 1%.

====Pakistan====
Pakistan has four Joint Commission International (JCI) accredited hospitals in Pakistan. Mostly people travel for treatments in Pakistan from Afghanistan, Iran, United Kingdom, Middle East and United States.

====Singapore====
Singapore has a dozen hospitals and health centers with JCI accreditation. In 2013 medical expenditure generated from medical tourists, mostly from more complex medical procedures, such as heart surgery, was S$832 million, a decline of 25 percent from 2012&#x27;s S$1.11 billion, as the hospitals faced more competition from neighboring countries for less complex work.

====Thailand====

Foreigners seeking treatment for everything from open-heart surgery to fertility treatments have made Thailand and its accredited hospitals a popular destination for medical tourism, attracting an estimated 2.81 million patients in 2015, up 10.2 percent. In 2013, medical tourists spent as much as US$4.7 billion, according to government statistics. , with 64 accredited hospitals, Thailand is currently among the top 10 medical tourism destinations in the world. In 2017, Thailand registered 3.3 million visits by foreigners seeking specialized medical treatment. In 2018, this number grew to 3.5 million.

===Europe===
Even within Europe, although therapy protocols might be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), several countries have their own review organizations in order to evaluate whether the same therapy protocol would be &quot;cost-effective&quot;, so that patients face differences in the therapy protocols, particularly in the access of these drugs, which might be partially explained by the financial strength of the particular Health System.

In 2006, it was ruled that under the conditions of the E112 European health scheme, UK health authorities had to pay the bill if one of their patients could establish urgent medical reasons for seeking quicker treatment in another European union country.

The European directive on the application of patients&#x27; rights to cross-border healthcare was agreed in 2011.

An online survey of EU migrants, mostly from Poland, Hungary and Romania, in the UK by the Centre for Population Change in 2019 showed that 46% of them preferred the health system in their country of origin. Only 36% preferred NHS medical treatment, and fewer among those from Western Europe.

====Turkey====

Volunteer doctors of Global Clinic have tried to help these people, for whom only acute care has been available. This means that the Finnish health care system is open for all people coming outside of the European Union.

====France====
British NHS patients have been offered treatment in France to reduce waiting lists for hip, knee and cataract surgery since 2002. France is a popular tourist destination but also ranked the world&#x27;s leading health care system by the World Health Organization. European Court of Justice said that National Health Service (England) has to pay back British patients.

The number of patients is growing, and in 2016, France scored # 7 in the Medical Tourism Index.

====Germany====
In 2017 there were said to be around 250,000 foreign patients who brought more than 1.2 billion euros income to German hospitals. Some were visitors who fell ill unexpectedly, but it is estimated that more than 40 percent came for planned treatment, the majority from Poland, the Netherlands or France. There have long been medical tourists from the Middle East. University hospitals and the large municipal clinics, such as University Hospital Freiburg or Vivantes in Berlin, are the most popular destinations. Some require payment in full before they start treatment.

The Hallwang Clinic GmbH is said to be the most high-profile clinic in the European private cancer industry, centred in Germany, which attracts patients from the US, the UK, Australia and the Middle East, offering a variety of different treatments, some of which do not appear to be evidence based; the clinic has been accused of selling false hope.

====Greece====

====Lithuania====
Health Tourism Lithuania, a booking agent, was established in 2018, focusing on the Scandinavian market, but in 2019 in response to longer waiting lists in the NHS noticed an increase in enquiries about hip replacements, in addition to the existing interest in cosmetic surgery and dentistry from Britons. A hip replacement costs £3,340, about a third of the price of a commercial procedure in the UK.

====Russia====
In his address to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation dated March 1, 2018, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed the need to develop health care and export services in the field of medicine and tourism.

In accordance with the decree of the President of the Russian Federation of May 7, 2018 No. 204 &quot;on national goals and strategic objectives of the development of the Russian Federation for the period up to 2024&quot; the volume of exports of medical services by 2024 will have to be $1 billion per year. RAMT in order to implement the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of 7 May 2018 No. 204, the Federal non-profit organization Russian Association of Medical Tourism was established.

====Serbia====
Serbia has a variety of clinics catering to medical tourists in areas of cosmetic surgery, dental care, fertility treatment and weight loss procedures. The country is also a major international hub for gender reassignment surgery.

====United Kingdom====

Both the publicly owned National Health Service and private hospitals attracts medical tourism. Many private hospitals and clinics in the United Kingdom are medical tourism destinations. UK private hospitals have mandatory registration with the UK&#x27;s watchdog, the Care Quality Commission. The vast majority of medical tourism in the UK is attracted to London where there are 25 private hospitals and clinics and 12 private patient units run by NHS hospital trusts. In 2017 there was a 3% decline in the £1.55 billion market because of fewer clients from the Middle East. Overseas patients coming to London are particularly likely to be seeking complex cancer, neurosciences, cardiovascular and pediatric services supported by strong clinical expertise reflected by the leading teaching hospitals based in the UK. Income for NHS providers rose by 9% in 2018–9, pushing the Royal Marsden nearer the 50% statutory limit.

=====Abuse in the UK=====
It is alleged that health tourists in the UK often target the NHS for its free-at-the-point-of-care treatment, allegedly costing the NHS up to £200 million. A study in 2013 concluded that the UK was a net exporter of medical tourists, with 63,000 UK residents traveling abroad for treatment and about 52,000 patients getting treatment in UK. Medical tourists treated as private patients by NHS trusts are more profitable than UK private patients, yielding close to a quarter of the revenue from only seven percent of volume of cases. UK dental patients largely go to Hungary and Poland. Fertility tourists mostly travel to Eastern Europe, Cyprus and Spain.

In the summer of 2015 immigration officers from the Border Force were stationed in St George&#x27;s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust to train staff to identify &quot;potentially chargeable patients&quot;. In October 2016 the trust announced that it planned to require photo identity papers or proof of their right to remain in the UK such as asylum status or a visa for pregnant women. Those not able to provide satisfactory documents would be sent to the trust&#x27;s overseas patient team &quot;for specialist document screening, in liaison with the UK Border Agency and the Home Office.&quot; It was estimated that £4.6 million a year was spent on care for ineligible patients. A pilot scheme to check whether patients were entitled to free NHS care in 18 NHS trusts, 11 in London, for two months in 2017 asked 8,894 people for two forms of ID prior to non-emergency care. Only 50 were not eligible for free NHS treatment. Campaigners claimed this was &quot;part of the Government&#x27;s hostile environment policy&quot;, and that in Newham hospital &quot;you will see huge signs saying you may not be eligible for free NHS treatment&quot;.

The bills issued to patients thought to be ineligible far exceed the sums actually collected. Most trusts do not have dedicated staff for the task. Ineligible patients generally live overseas, many have no money, and some demonstrate that they were eligible for free treatment after invoices had been issued.

<doc id="676722" wikidata="Q6304031" url="?curid=676722" title="The Caves of Androzani">
<text>The Caves of Androzani is the sixth serial of the 21st season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in four twice-weekly parts on BBC1 from 8 to 16 March 1984.

In the serial, the Doctor becomes involved in a war for control of the life-prolonging substance &quot;spectrox&quot; on the planet Androzani Minor, which is being fought between the ruthless businessman Morgus (John Normington) and the android-builder Sharaz Jek (Christopher Gable).

&quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; was Peter Davison&#x27;s last regular appearance as the Fifth Doctor, marked the first appearance of Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor, and saw the return of scriptwriter Robert Holmes to the series for the first time since 1978. It was also Graeme Harper&#x27;s first work on the series as a full director, having worked on earlier serials as an assistant director. In 2009, &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; was voted by fans as the best &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story in history.

==Plot==
The TARDIS lands on Androzani Minor, and the Doctor and Peri explore the caves where they are captured by General Chellak, who believes them to be aiding gunrunners. Androzani Minor is the only source of the spectrox drug, produced by bats within the desert planet&#x27;s cave systems. The citizens of neighbouring Androzani Major rely on spectrox for its life-extending capabilities. Spectrox mining is controlled by Morgus&#x27;s business conglomerate, but is threatened by Sharaz Jek, a masked figure who hides within the cave systems and controls an army of androids that disrupt mining efforts. Morgus has publicly funded the military operation led by Chellak to defeat Jek, but secretly employs gunrunners Stotz and Krelper to supply Jek with weapons to profit from the war. Chellak communicates the image of the Doctor and Peri to Morgus who does not recognise them and orders their execution. At their execution, Chellak finds that Jek replaced them with androids. Unbeknownst to Chellak, his own adjutant, Maj. Salateen, has also been replaced by one of Jek&#x27;s androids.

In Jek&#x27;s lair, the Doctor and Peri complain about illness, and the real Salateen tells them that they had stepped in raw spectrox, which is lethal; the anti-toxin is the milk of the queen bat, but due to the recent war, the bats have descended to the deepest levels of the mine that are devoid of oxygen. Jek explains that he is at war with Morgus as his actions led to his disfiguration. Jek leaves the two under guard of his androids while he meets Stotz and Krelper. The Doctor reprograms the androids to allow them to escape. They are caught in the middle of one of the battles, and Peri is captured by Chellak, while the Doctor is forced to leave with Stotz and Krelper.

Stotz decides to take the Doctor to see Morgus directly, and communicates with him holographically en route. Morgus sees the Doctor alive, and believing the military is deceiving him, kills the President of Androzani and makes his own arrangements to travel to Androzani Minor to set things right. The Doctor commandeers Stotz&#x27;s ship and redirects it back to the surface of Androzani Minor, setting off to rescue Peri. Chellak initiates a major attack against Jek&#x27;s androids, which ends up costing him his life as well as most of the soldiers and androids. During this, Jek rescues Peri as she starts to succumb to the spectrox poisoning. At his base, Jek activates the cooling system to help soothe Peri&#x27;s aches. The Doctor, starting to also feel the effects, arrives at the base. Jek takes pity on the two, and directs the Doctor to where he can find the queen bat and provides him with an oxygen tank. Morgus lands by Stotz&#x27;s ship, and learns that his shrewd secretary has replaced him as head of the conglomerate. Morgus quickly enlists Stotz to get Jek&#x27;s supply of spectrox. Stotz kills Krelper and the remaining gunrunner before leaving. They follow the heat signature from Jek&#x27;s cooling system to find his base. Morgus, Stotz, and Jek get into a fight, and end up killing each other.

The Doctor finds the queen bat and collects two phials of her milk. Returning to the base, he collects Peri and wearily carries her out of the caves, dropping one of the two phials as he gets to the TARDIS. He sets the TARDIS in motion and feeds Peri the remaining phial, before collapsing on the floor. Peri recovers as the Doctor explains that there was only enough bat&#x27;s milk left to cure her; though he is dying, he says his body might regenerate, though he notes it feels different from his previous regenerations. The Doctor begins to hallucinate images of his past companions urging him to continue to fight for his life. They include the dead Adric, which the Doctor queries before the Master yells that he must die and the regeneration completes, with the Sixth Doctor suddenly alert and active. When Peri asks what has happened, the Doctor replies, &quot;Change, my dear, and it seems not a moment too soon...&quot;

==Production==
The working title of this story was &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;. This story was the first time former script editor Robert Holmes had written for the series since &quot;The Power of Kroll&quot; (1978), as Nathan-Turner had been keen to use writers new to the show instead.

Recording was interrupted by a strike, which caused a serious delay in the filming of the serial. As a result, two sequences had to be cut. The first scene would have featured the Doctor and Peri at the opening of the story in the TARDIS. The Doctor was to explain to Peri the reason for their visit to Androzani Minor. Apparently, as a boy, the Doctor had started a &quot;blown glass bottle collection,&quot; which was made from the sand of different planets. He had lost his Androzani bottle and decided to return there to retrieve some more sand. It was in this scene Peri was to say &quot;You&#x27;re such a pain, Doctor.&quot; However, when the final cut of the serial was made, it had been discovered that certain lines of dialogue (like the Doctor professing that &quot;I am not a pain.&quot; and Peri&#x27;s comments about needing sand to &quot;make some glass&quot;) alluded to the cut sequence. To rectify this, Davison and Bryant voiced over part of their conversation while the TARDIS materialises from outer space to the planet. The second scene to be cut would have featured the Doctor battling with the magma beast in episode four. Other &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories adversely affected by the industrial actions of the late 1970s and the 1980s were &quot;Resurrection of the Daleks&quot; (1984), which was delayed by a year, and &quot;Shada&quot; (1980), which was not completed.

While he is in his office, the character of Morgus frequently breaks the fourth wall by talking directly to camera. This arose through actor John Normington misunderstanding a stage direction. Harper felt the asides effectively ramped up the dramatic tension, and decided to keep them. The Fifth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration, like the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s, features a flashback of that incarnation&#x27;s companions. However, for this regeneration, it was decided that special recordings of the Davison-era companions would be used instead of stock footage. This required Matthew Waterhouse, Sarah Sutton, Janet Fielding, Mark Strickson, Gerald Flood and Anthony Ainley to return in cameos for the regeneration sequence. Fielding, Strickson, Flood and Ainley were already under contract to appear in the stories of Season 21. However, special contracts had to be made for Waterhouse, who left the series in Season 19, and Sutton, who left in Season 20. Johnny Byrne, who created the character of Nyssa (in his 1981 story &quot;The Keeper of Traken&quot;) had to be paid royalties for the use of the character in the regeneration scene.

Davison has joked on several occasions of how he was &quot;upstaged&quot; by Nicola Bryant (Peri) in his last major scene as the Doctor. Before the regeneration hallucination occurs, Davison is lying on the floor and his head is resting by Bryant, who is kneeling beside him. As he is delivering his last few lines, Bryant&#x27;s loose fitting outfit prominently displays her cleavage. The closing title sequence for episode four featured the face of Sixth Doctor Colin Baker instead of Peter Davison, and credits Baker as the Doctor before Davison&#x27;s own credit. This was the first and, to date, only time that the new lead received top billing in the final full story of an outgoing Doctor. The trousers which Colin Baker wore in the regeneration scene were modified to fit his larger frame. Davison would later wear the same pair of trousers when he reprised the role of the Fifth Doctor in the mini-episode &quot;Time Crash&quot;.

===Cast notes===
Peter Davison has stated that this is his favourite serial from his three years on the series. He has said that he particularly enjoyed the script by veteran &quot;Doctor Who&quot; writer Robert Holmes and working with the director Graeme Harper, who he claimed brought &quot;pace&quot; and &quot;energy&quot; to the programme, as well as directing it &quot;far more filmically than it had ever been done before.&quot;

Christopher Gable, who played Sharaz Jek, was a well-known actor and formerly a leading ballet dancer. Gable was not the only contender to play Jek; John Nathan-Turner, who always favoured attracting big stars to the series in guest roles, had offered the role to actor Tim Curry, as well as rock stars Mick Jagger and David Bowie. Bowie&#x27;s management declined on his behalf as the dates clashed with his Serious Moonlight Tour according to Bowie biographer and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; staff member Nicholas Pegg. Ultimately, Christopher Gable was cast, the preferred choice of director Graeme Harper (Harper claimed on the DVD commentary that Bowie was the only other contender he thought of but he believed Gable ended up being right for it). Robert Glenister and Peter Davison had previously played brothers Brian and Steve Webber in the BBC sitcom &quot;Sink or Swim&quot; (1980–82).

Glenister later played Aboresh in the audio play &quot;Absolution&quot; and Thomas Edison in &quot;Nikola Tesla&#x27;s Night of Terror&quot;. John Normington guest stars as Morgus; he returned to the series as Trevor Sigma in the Seventh Doctor story &quot;The Happiness Patrol&quot; (1988). He also appeared in &quot;Ghost Machine&quot; (2006), an episode of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off &quot;Torchwood&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==

&quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; received critical acclaim. The serial was repeated on BBC2 in February/March 1993 on consecutive Fridays (19 February 1993 to 12 March 1993) at 7:15 pm, achieving viewing figures of 2.12, 1.9, 1.86 and 1.4 million respectively. This story was released on VHS in January 1992. In 2003&#x27;s 40th Anniversary &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; poll, &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; was voted the best serial of all time. In Outpost Gallifrey&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Poll, &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; was voted the second best serial of all time. In a 2009 &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; poll, &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; was voted the greatest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story by readers, ahead of &quot;Blink&quot; and &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot;. It was the only Peter Davison story to feature in the top ten (Tom Baker had five entries while Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant had two each). In 2010, Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to the third episode — in which the Doctor prepares to crash Stotz&#x27;s ship — as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, going as far as calling it &quot;the greatest Doctor Who cliffhanger of them all&quot;. In 2013, &quot;Den of Geek&quot;″s Andrew Blair selected &quot;The Caves of Androzani&quot; as one of the ten &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories that would make great musicals. In a 2014 poll, &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; readers ranked the story as the fourth best of all time.

<doc id="676735" wikidata="Q394023" url="?curid=676735" title="Žigmund Pálffy">
<text>Žigmund Pálffy (; born 5 May 1972), nicknamed &quot;Ziggy&quot; in English and &quot;Žigo&quot; in Slovak, is a Slovak former professional ice hockey player.

One of the most talented wingers, Pálffy played in the NHL for 12 years with the New York Islanders, Los Angeles Kings, and Pittsburgh Penguins between 1993 and 2006. He announced his retirement in January 2006, and his comeback from retirement in the summer of 2007. Pálffy signed a contract to play for his boyhood club HK 36 Skalica in the 2007–08 season and continued to do so until the end of his career. He also retracted his decision from 2005 never to play for the Slovak national team again by participating at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where he was also the flagbearer. In July 2013, he announced his definite retirement. Pálffy was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2019.

==Playing career==
===New York Islanders===
After a solid season in his native Czechoslovakia and an impressive stint with the Czechoslovakia national team in the 1991 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Pálffy was drafted by the New York Islanders in the second round of the 1991 NHL Draft, 26th overall. After two more years in Slovakia, Pálffy came to North America for the 1993–94 season. He spent the majority of the 1993–94 season in the International Hockey League (IHL) with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, while also making his NHL debut with the Islanders, appearing in five games, though he did not earn a single point. The following season, 1994–95, he split the year between the Islanders and the Denver Grizzlies of the IHL.

The 1995–96 NHL season saw Pálffy break out as an offensive scorer. In his first game of 1995–96, his team went down one goal but Pálffy would score two goals to lead New York to a 2–1 win over the Florida Panthers. He also scored 87 points in 81 games and quickly became the star of the Islanders franchise. The following two seasons were much the same for Pálffy, scoring 90 and 87 points respectively. During the 1998–99 season, Pálffy was limited to only 50 games but still played solidly, scoring 50 points.

===Los Angeles Kings===
After the season, the Islanders, facing financial woes, traded him and Bryan Smolinski to the Los Angeles Kings in a deal that saw Olli Jokinen, Josh Green, Mathieu Biron and a first-round draft pick go to the Islanders.

With the Kings, Pálffy continued his strong play, often being paired with fellow Slovak Jozef Stümpel and Canadian superstar Luc Robitaille. Injuries, specifically his shoulder, began to limit Pálffy&#x27;s playing time. During the 2003–04 season, Pálffy&#x27;s nagging shoulder kept him out of action for the majority of the season.

===Pittsburgh Penguins and first retirement===
After the 2003–04 season, the Kings tried to re-sign Pálffy, but when Pálffy had a phone call with Pittsburgh Penguins owner Mario Lemieux and gave him his word that he would sign with the Penguins, that ended all negotiations with the Kings. Shortly after the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he signed with the Penguins for three years and US$13.5 million.

After playing 42 games with the Penguins during the 2005–06 season, Pálffy abruptly retired from professional hockey. On January 18, 2006, then-Penguins general manager Craig Patrick told reporters Pálffy told him he was retiring due to a lingering shoulder injury. Pálffy completed his career with 329 goals and 384 assists for 713 points in 684 games over 12 NHL seasons.

===HK 36 Skalica and second retirement===
Pálffy announced his comeback from retirement in the summer of 2007, and signed a contract to play for his hometown club of HK 36 Skalica for the entire 2007–08 season. He became the most productive player of the regular season in the Slovak Extraliga, where he led four seasons in points.

In July 2013, before the start of the 2013–14 season, Pálffy formally announced his retirement from professional hockey. He said he was old enough and did not feel like playing and traveling with the team after so many years, but also that he was going to miss the game of hockey since he lived for it for almost 40 years.

==International play==




Pálffy has represented Slovakia and Czechoslovakia in international competitions, winning a gold medal with Slovakia in the 2002 after he had assisted on Peter Bondra&#x27;s tournament-winning goal 100 seconds to go in the third period. Following the 2005 World Championships in Austria, Pálffy announced his retirement from the Slovak national team.

Five years later, Pálffy broke his retirement and was named to the Slovak national team for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver and recorded three assists with the team for a total of three points in seven games.

<text>Snæfellsjökull (, &quot;snow-fell glacier&quot;) is a 700,000-year-old glacier-capped stratovolcano in western Iceland. It is situated on the westernmost part of the Snæfellsnes peninsula. Sometimes it may be seen from the city of Reykjavík over Faxa Bay, at a distance of .

The mountain is one of the most famous sites of Iceland, primarily due to the novel &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1864) by Jules Verne, in which the protagonists find the entrance to a passage leading to the center of the Earth on Snæfellsjökull.

The mountain is part of Snæfellsjökull National Park (Icelandic: &quot;Þjóðgarðurinn Snæfellsjökull&quot;).

Snæfellsjökull was visible from an extreme distance due to an arctic mirage on 17 July 1939. Captain Robert Bartlett of the &quot;Effie M. Morrissey&quot; sighted Snæfellsjökull from a position some distant.

In August 2012, the summit was ice-free for the first time in recorded history. The icecap area had been in 1946, in 1999 reducing to in 2008.

==Geology==
The stratovolcano, which is the only large central volcano in its part of Iceland, has many pyroclastic cones on its flanks. Upper-flank craters produced intermediate to felsic materials. Several holocene eruptions have originated from the summit crater and have produced felsic material, with pumice from the two most recent major eruptions being alkaline trachyte trending in composition close to rhyolite. Lower-flank craters have produced basaltic lava flows with classic basalt composition. The latest flank eruption was of of basaltic material in the Væjuhraun lava flow and occurred shortly after the last central volcano eruption. This main eruption had been explosive and originated from the summit crater. It is dated to about  CE, and was also associated with the eruption of viscous lava that covered . In all three large, perhaps up to VEI 4 plinian rhyolitic eruptions have occurred during the Holocene producing tephra. These occurred about 1800, 4000 and 8500 years ago.

Snæfellsjökull is also associated with a fissure field that last erupted to the west forming the Væjuhraun lava flow as already mentioned. To the east of Snæfellsjökull this fissure field last erupted between 5 and 8 thousand years ago. This eruption formed the Búðahraun lava field from the crater Búðaklettur, south-west of Búðir. This is part of the Snæfellsjökull volcanic system which in turn is part of the Snæfellsnes volcanic belt (Snæfellsnes volcanic zone). This is an area of renewed intra-plate volcanism in the North American Plate, with rocks no older locally than 800,000 years, that overlay an extinct rift zone that produced the more than 5 million years old crustal basement tholeiitic flood basalts of the Snæfellsnes peninsula.

=== Hazards ===
The Snæfellsjökull volcanic system has the potential for lava flows, explosive tephra eruptions (e.g. air traffic during a major rhyolitic eruption), tsunami generation (perhaps one flank collapse has occurred historically) and Jökulhlaups. 


==Climbing==
In summer, the saddle near the summit can be reached easily by walking, although the glacier&#x27;s crevasses must be avoided. Several tour companies run regular guided walks during the season. Reaching the true summit requires technical ice climbing.

==In culture==

===Literature===
Snæfellsjökull serves as the entrance to the subterranean journey in Jules Verne&#x27;s classic science fiction novel, &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; (1864). It is also featured in the 1960s &quot;Blind Birds&quot; trilogy by Czech SF writer Ludvík Souček, loosely inspired by Verne&#x27;s work. While trying to discern whether Verne actually visited Iceland, a Czechoslovak-Icelandic science party discovers an ancient alien outpost in the cave system under Snæfellsjökull.

It also figures prominently in the novel &quot;Under the Glacier&quot; (1968) by Icelandic Nobel laureate Halldór Laxness.

===Radio and podcasting===
Snæfellsjökull is the setting and subject of &quot;Lava and Ice&quot; (episode 2) of &quot;Wireless Nights&quot;, Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s BBC Radio 4 and podcast series.

===Presidential election===
The campaign &quot;Snæfellsjökul fyrir forseta&quot; proposed Snæfellsjökul as a candidate in the 2024 Icelandic presidential election, asserting that it met the requirements of being an Icelandic citizen, aged over 35, with no criminal record, and with a supporting petition.

<doc id="676738" wikidata="Q7867680" url="?curid=676738" title="USS Benham (DD-796)">
<text>USS &quot;Benham&quot; (DD-796) was a in service with the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946 and from 1951 to 1960. She was then transferred to Peru where she served as BAP &quot;Villar&quot; (DD-71) until being scrapped in 1980.

==Service history==
&quot;Benham&quot; was the third ship of the U.S. Navy to be named for Rear Admiral Andrew E. K. Benham (1832–1905). She was launched on 30 August 1943 by Bethlehem Steel Company, Staten Island, New York; sponsored by Mrs. Harold Benham, wife of a grandson of Rear Admiral Benham; and commissioned on 20 December 1943.

=== World War II ===

==== 1944 ====
After fitting out at New York, &quot;Benham&quot; conducted her initial shakedown training in Long Island Sound before sailing southeast to Bermuda in early January 1944. After arriving in Kingston, Jamaica on 14 January, she carried out four weeks of shore bombardment, anti-submarine, and carrier escort exercises before returning to New York on 13 February. Following post-shakedown availability, she proceeded to Norfolk, Virginia on 28 February, joined with , and escorted the destroyer tender through the Panama Canal to Hawaii, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 27 March.

&quot;Benham&quot; then conducted destroyer type training—carrier screen exercises, antiaircraft gunnery practice, and antisubmarine drills—in preparation for Operation Forager, the planned invasion of the Marianas. On 24 April, however, the destroyer collided with during a night screening exercise, causing extensive damage to her bow. Given the priority accorded &quot;Forager&quot; preparations, &quot;Benham&quot;″s repairs proved slow, and the warship did not return to duty until 14 May.

On 29 May, &quot;Benham&quot; joined Task Group 52.11 (TG 52.11), comprising , , , and , and sailed for Eniwetok, arriving there a week later. Steaming to Saipan in the Marianas on 15 June, &quot;Benham&quot; screened the two escort carriers as they launched air strikes against Japanese ground troops ashore. After hearing reports of a large enemy naval force from the Philippines headed toward the Marianas, the fast carriers—which had also been flying ground support missions—moved west to fight and win the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 19 and 20 June. Meanwhile, the American troops ashore had to rely on the seven escort carriers of TG 52.1 for any close air support.

The first Japanese counterattack around Saipan took place on the night of 15 June when three small air raids attacked TG 52.1. Although none closed &quot;Benham&quot; that night, a strike by a dozen or so Aichi D3A &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers attacked the escort carriers at dusk on 17 June. &quot;Benham&quot; joined in the ensuing antiaircraft barrage, helping to shoot down two of the attackers without loss. The following day, several more raids closed the task group; but combat air patrol (CAP) fighters drove off the attackers.

The destroyer remained with the escort carriers until 2 July when she shifted to the screening and fire support group (TG 52.12) to back up mopping-up operations on Saipan. After that island was secured on the 10th, the destroyer got underway for Eniwetok, arriving there on 16 July. She quickly loaded supplies and ammunition for the next phase of the operation and escorted a convoy of assault troops from Eniwetok to Tinian, arriving off that island on 19 July.

For the next four days, &quot;Benham&quot; screened troop transports at sea while other warships conducted gunfire missions against enemy forces on Tinian. After the landings on 24 July, the destroyer spent the rest of the month firing at targets around Sunharon town during the day and covering Marine Corps battalions with defensive gunfire at night. &quot;Benham&quot; also closed the island in the evenings to fire interdiction missions and pound enemy gun emplacements. On 6 August, the destroyer shifted to Guam and spent four days bombarding the last Japanese positions on the northeast corner of the island. With the island declared secure on 10 August, &quot;Benham&quot; steamed east to Eniwetok for repairs alongside a tender.

As part of the preliminaries to the invasion of the Philippines, the fast carriers were ordered to attack Japanese air strength in the Bonins and the Palaus and on Yap and Mindanao. On 28 August, in company with TG 38.2—consisting of , , , , , two battleships, four cruisers, and seventeen other destroyers—&quot;Benham&quot; steamed west for a large raid on the Palaus. She screened the carriers during attacks there between 6 and 8 September and against Japanese airfields near Sarangani Bay on Mindanao in the Philippines on 9 and 10 September. Returning to the Palaus on 15 September, the destroyer screened the carriers as they flew strikes in support of the landings on Peleliu and Angaur. After a final series of strikes against airfields on Luzon between 21 and 24 September, the task force steamed to Ulithi on 29 September to rearm and refuel.

On 6 October, TG 38.2 put to sea and joined the three other carrier groups of Task Force 38 (TF 38). Then, the entire task force steamed northwest for raids on the Ryukyu Islands, Formosa, and the Philippines. &quot;Benham&quot; screened &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; during the strikes on Okinawa and the smaller Ryūkyūs on 10 October. A diversionary raid on Aparri in the Philippines followed on 11 October, and then a large-scale effort to destroy Japanese air power on Formosa began on 12 October.

Although the American attacks neutralized much of the defending Japanese planes on that island, the task force was plagued by night harassing attacks from Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; twin-engine bombers operating out of Kyūshū. Over two nights of attacks, &quot;Benham&quot;″s gunners helped splash nine enemy planes and chalked up a tenth as &quot;probable.&quot; The task force then slowly steamed east, covering the retirement of —heavily damaged by a Japanese torpedo—before striking at Japanese installations in the Philippines starting on 15 October. These attacks, intended to clear the way for an American amphibious landing, continued until 20 October when the first troops landed on Leyte.

Detached from the main body on 24 October, &quot;Benham&quot; escorted &quot;Bunker Hill&quot; to Manus Island in the Admiralties for repairs. She therefore missed the series of major engagements in and around the Philippines on 24 and 25 October known as the Battle for Leyte Gulf. Meanwhile, after a brief refit at Manus, the destroyer steamed to Saipan where she rejoined the carrier task force for operations in early November. Arriving off Luzon on 11 November, &quot;Benham&quot; helped screen the carriers as they provided air support for Leyte ground operations. These continued until 22 November, when the fast carriers returned to Ulithi.

The task force returned to the Philippines on 10 December, this time to support landings on Mindanao. As Japanese air attacks had slackened off by this time, the most notable event to the ships of the task force was a typhoon that swept through the area on 18 December. Caught in the center of the storm, &quot;Benham&quot; found herself faced with stack-high seas and winds that sent her laboring greatly. More seriously, water flooding through the ventilators shorted out her switchboards, the vent fans failed, and the crew had to bail free water in the extreme heat below decks. After five hours of punishing weather, the worst of the storm passed; and the warship limped to Ulithi for repairs. There, the crew heard the news that the storm had sunk three other destroyers and damaged at least 27 other ships.

====1945====
Just over a week later, &quot;Benham&quot; got underway again, this time with TG 38.1, built around , , and . These fast carriers struck at Formosa on 3 and 4 January 1945 in preparation for Operation &quot;Musketeer,&quot; the landings on Luzon in the Philippines. On 6 and 7 January, while the American invasion forces suffered under enemy air attacks in the South China Sea and at Lingayen Gulf, the fast carriers retaliated against airfields on Luzon in a successful attempt to suppress these Japanese strikes. After refueling at sea, TF 38 conducted a final raid against Formosa on the 9th.

In an effort to secure the American supply line between Mindoro and Lingayan Gulf, TF 38 steamed through the Luzon Strait into the South China Sea to strike at nearby Japanese defensive installations and shipping. Although plagued by bad weather, the American carriers raided Japanese shipping along the coast of Indochina on 12 January and struck at airfields and ports on Formosa, Hainan, and in China on the 15th and 16. After a brief excursion north to fly photographic missions over Okinawa, the task force returned to Ulithi on 27 January.

With operations on Mindoro and Luzon well underway, the destroyer&#x27;s crew received two weeks of rest while the fast carriers geared up for their next mission, a major raid on the Japanese home islands. On 10 February, after the carrier force departed Ulithi, &quot;Benham&quot; and 14 other destroyers formed a scouting and picket line about 35 miles (65 km) ahead of the carriers. Intended to destroy enemy surface pickets and provide early warning for the carriers, the destroyers screened the fast carriers during their air strikes on Honshū on 16 and 17 February. During these operations, the destroyers vectored in combat air patrol (CAP) against enemy &quot;snoopers&quot;, helping to splash eight. The task force turned south the next day and began strikes on Iwo Jima in support of the amphibious landings on the 19th. After a second strike on Honshū on 25 and 26 February, the warships returned to Ulithi at the beginning of March.

On 13 March, &quot;Benham&quot; embarked upon the last major amphibious operation of the war, the invasion of Okinawa. In company with other destroyers in the screen, she covered the carriers during the American attacks on the Kyūshū airfields and enemy naval installations on the shores of the Inland Sea. The destroyer made her first radar contact with enemy &quot;snoopers&quot; on 17 March and fired on, and drove off, a Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighter that closed her position the following morning. The action continued on 19 March, when &quot;Benham&quot; and made a submarine contact at 02:50. Over the next four hours, both destroyers exhausted their depth charges on the target but did not sink the Japanese submarine. The destroyer then collected survivors from —heavily damaged by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; on 19 March—and delivered them to &quot;Wasp&quot;.

On 31 March, obtained a sonar contact and made a depth-charge attack on a suspected Japanese submarine. &quot;Benham&quot;″s crew reported an oil slick and a strong odor of diesel fuel afterwards, but again there were no firm results. On 6 April, five days after landings began on Okinawa, Japanese air activity increased dramatically as they launched the first of their massed kamikaze attacks against American forces in and around the Ryūkyūs. Although these massive raids plagued picket destroyers elsewhere, &quot;Benham&quot; suffered no direct attacks during this initial foray. At 09:44 on 17 April, however, four Zeros closed her position. One strafed , pulled up, and then dove straight at &quot;Benham&quot;. Although antiaircraft fire from several destroyers splashed the plane about astern, the Zero disintegrated in a large explosion that, in conjunction with antiaircraft fire from adjacent ships, killed one sailor, wounded 14, and knocked out the destroyer&#x27;s radar.

After temporary repairs, &quot;Benham&quot; spent the rest of April and early May at sea, helping to protect American forces operating in and around Okinawa. After a brief repair period at Ulithi in mid-May, she once again screened the fast carriers during the naval air strikes against Kyūshū and Nansei Shoto in early June. The warship retired to Leyte on 13 June, intending to conduct a quick replenishment there but was diverted to Guam for more serious repairs on her engineering plant.

Rejoining TF 38 on 21 July, &quot;Benham&quot; stayed with the fast carriers for the next four weeks, screening them during 24 and 28 July strikes on the Inland Sea, the attacks on Kobe and Nagoya on 30 July, and the final strikes on Honshū and the Tokyo plain in mid-August. During these operations, &quot;Benham&quot; carried out varied duties including an anti-shipping sweep off Shikoku, a shore bombardment against the naval seaplane base at Shionomisaki, and even shuttle missions ferrying British liaison officers between British and American aircraft carriers.

Following the announcement of the Japanese surrender on 15 August, the destroyer patrolled off the home islands until 27 August, when she joined the long line of ships entering Sagami Wan to receive the surrender of the Yokosuka Naval Base. After a brief trip to Iwo Jima to pick up several million yen of military currency for use in Japan, the destroyer took up station near the port bow of for the official surrender ceremony on 2 September. The warship remained in Japanese waters until 26 October when she sailed for home. &quot;Benham&quot; spent the next year at various ports on the west coast until finally decommissioning on 18 October 1946. She was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California

===1951–1960===
In 1951, owing to the Korean War and the ensuing requirement for more warships in service, &quot;Benham&quot; was recommissioned at Long Beach, California, on 24 March 1951. After steaming to the east coast, by way of the Panama Canal, she underwent an extensive overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard. Among other modernization efforts, her old 40-millimeter guns were replaced by newer guns—thought to be more capable against jet aircraft. Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, with her home port at Newport, Rhode Island, the destroyer conducted shakedown operations and training exercises along the east coast for the rest of that year.

&quot;Benham&quot; began her first overseas Atlantic deployment the next spring, sailing on a European goodwill cruise on 22 April 1952. In company with , the warship visited ports in Newfoundland, Iceland, Ireland, England, Sweden, Germany, Libya, and Italy before returning home on 16 September. Following six months of antisubmarine exercises and type training out of Newport, she got underway for a second Mediterranean deployment on 17 April 1953. This cruise, which lasted for five months, took her to Italy, France, Turkey, and Greece. Returning to the east coast on 3 September, she entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a four-month modernization overhaul. Upon leaving the shipyard in January 1954, she spent the next five months conducting training exercises along the east coast in preparation for a world cruise.

Departing Newport on 1 June, &quot;Benham&quot; and the rest of Destroyer Division 242 (DesDiv 242) steamed south, passed through the Panama Canal, and crossed the Pacific Ocean to Japan. There, she spent several months training and patrolling with the 7th Fleet. One such patrol took place in the South China Sea after two Chinese communist Lavochkin La. 7 fighters shot down an Air Cathay passenger airplane in late July, killing half of the 18 passengers on board. On 25 July, while &quot;Benham&quot; searched for survivors, two Chinese fighters attacked nearby American fighters and were promptly splashed for their troubles. The destroyer also conducted antisubmarine training exercises with friendly submarines off Okinawa. Following a two-week yard period at Sasebo, Japan, the destroyer sailed for home in October. She visited Hong Kong and Singapore first, then sailed into the Indian Ocean before stopping at Ceylon and Aden. Other port visits included Naples, Barcelona, Gibraltar, and the Azores before she finally arrived in Newport on 18 December.

After a short leave and upkeep period, she spent most of 1955 conducting brief training missions out of Newport for the Atlantic Fleet antisubmarine and destroyer force commands. On 7 January 1956, &quot;Benham&quot; entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for another modernization overhaul. She then spent the summer serving as a school ship at Newport, helping to train prospective commanding officers and engineers. In September, the destroyer entered the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for a two-week availability period. Then, given the growing tensions in the Middle East over the Egyptian nationalization of the Suez Canal, her crew began intensive training exercises out of Newport in preparation for a possible emergency deployment. On 29 October, Israeli forces attacked Egyptian forces in the Sinai, followed two days later by British and French air strikes on British and French paratroopers dropped on Port Said, the start of a larger operation to seize the entire Suez Canal. The next day, however, the Soviet Union declared its intentions to support Egypt in this conflict.

In response, on the morning 6 November, President Dwight D. Eisenhower put all American warships on alert; and some, including &quot;Benham&quot;, received orders to reinforce the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. The destroyer got underway that same day and, after a non-stop 16-day voyage, arrived in the eastern Mediterranean on 22 November. There, she helped protect the deployment to Egypt of an emergency force under the auspices of United Nations. &quot;Benham&quot; also helped cover the slow withdraw of British, French, and Israeli forces from the Suez Canal region.

With the crisis over, the warship departed for home on 11 February 1957, reaching Newport on 20 February. Soon thereafter, she returned to a regular schedule of training missions off the east coast. Following three months of local exercises out of Newport, the destroyer conducted a midshipman summer cruise to South America in June and July visiting Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; St. Thomas, Virgin Islands; Guantánamo Bay, Cuba; and Culebra, Puerto Rico. In September, &quot;Benham&quot; steamed northeast from Newport for a series of NATO antisubmarine exercises in the North Atlantic. After these operations, the crew spent two days in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and Chatham, England, before returning to Newport. Moving to Boston for a three-month yard period in January 1958, the crew helped prepare the destroyer for another Mediterranean deployment later that spring.

In the Middle East, meanwhile, the specter of civil war loomed in Lebanon following a Moslem uprising in Beirut in early May. The government of President Camille Chamoun appealed to Britain and the United States for aid. Although wary of becoming involved, President Eisenhower authorized the positioning of a rapid reaction force in the region. On 14 July, following a coup in Iraq, Eisenhower authorized intervention in Lebanon in an attempt to contain the spread of unrest. Some 10,000 marines began landing in Lebanon on the following day. As part of the American response to this crisis, &quot;Benham&quot; hurriedly deployed to the Mediterranean, sailing for southern Europe from Newport on 14 July. Over the next four months, the warship served in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf, supporting American troops as they helped restore order in Lebanon.

After the last troops evacuated Beirut on 25 October, she sailed for home, arriving late in November and remaining in port for the rest of the 1958. During 1959, in addition to her normal training routine out of Newport, &quot;Benham&quot; conducted two major exercises, a carrier familiarization cruise off Mayport, Florida, that spring and an antisubmarine training voyage to the Caribbean that summer. Tapped for foreign transfer under the Military Assistance Program (MAP), the warship moved to the Boston Naval Shipyard in early 1960 for repairs and a substantial overhaul.

&quot;Benham&quot; was decommissioned at Boston on 30 June 1960. The destroyer was then transferred to Peru as a loan under the Military Assistance Program (MAP) on 15 December 1960. On 15 January 1974, &quot;Benham&quot;&#x27;s name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register, and she was sold to the government of Peru that same day.

===BAP &quot;Villar&quot; (DD-71)===
The ship served in the Peruvian Navy as BAP &quot;Villar&quot; (DD-71) until scrapped in 1980. Before being scrapped &quot;Villar&quot; was used as a target for Exocet missiles from .

==Awards==
&quot;Benham&quot; (DD-796) earned eight battle stars for World War II service.

<text>&quot;Love and Marriage&quot; is a 1955 song with lyrics by Sammy Cahn and music by Jimmy Van Heusen. It is published by Barton Music Corporation (ASCAP).

==Frank Sinatra versions==

&quot;Love and Marriage&quot; was introduced by Frank Sinatra in the 1955 television production of Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Our Town&quot;, which aired on &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot;. Sinatra went on to record two versions of the song. The first was recorded for Capitol Records on August 15, 1955, was used as the &quot;title track&quot; to the big screen Hollywood success (Love Is) The Tender Trap, and became a major chart hit. (A competing version by Dinah Shore also achieved popularity.) This first recording appeared on the 1956 album &quot;This Is Sinatra!&quot; The second version was recorded for the Reprise Records album &quot;A Man and His Music&quot; on October 11, 1965. The Capitol version was later used as the theme song for the 1987–1997 Fox TV sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot;.

Although both versions were arranged by Nelson Riddle, there are many slight but noticeable differences. For instance:

*In the Capitol version, the opening lyrics are &quot;Love and marriage. Love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage.&quot; In the Reprise version, the opening lyrics are &quot;Love and marriage. Love and marriage. They go together like a horse and carriage.&quot;
*The Capitol version includes a crescendoing instrumental bridge, which was later played over the closing credits of &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. This bridge is missing from the Reprise version.
*In the Reprise version, Sinatra ends the song by saying (not singing), &quot;No, sir.&quot; The ending of the Capitol version is an instrumental version of &quot;Shave and a Haircut&quot; with a bassoon playing the final two notes solo – a C flat and a B flat. (Traditionally, when played in B major, the last two notes of &quot;Shave and a Haircut&quot; are an A natural and a B flat.)

In 1956, &quot;Love and Marriage&quot; won the Emmy for Best Musical Contribution from the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

<doc id="676751" wikidata="Q3822357" url="?curid=676751" title="The Bonesetter's Daughter">
<text>The Bonesetter&#x27;s Daughter, published in 2001, is Amy Tan&#x27;s fourth novel. Like much of Tan&#x27;s work, this book deals with the relationship between an American-born Chinese woman and her immigrant mother.

&quot;The Bonesetter&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is divided into two major stories. The first is about Ruth, a Chinese-American woman living in San Francisco. She worries that her elderly mother, Lu Ling, is gradually becoming more and more demented. Lu Ling seems increasingly forgetful, and makes bizarre comments about her family and her own past.

The second major story is that of Lu Ling herself, as written for Ruth. Several years earlier, Lu Ling had written out her life story in Chinese. Ruth arranges to have the document translated, and learns the truth about her mother&#x27;s life in China.

Much of the novel, like Tan&#x27;s previous work, is based on her relationship with her own mother, and her mother and grandmother&#x27;s life stories. The first edition&#x27;s cover photo is an image of Tan&#x27;s grandmother Gu Jingmei, taken in about 1905.

==Plot summary==

Ruth is a self-sufficient woman who makes her living as a ghostwriter for self-help books. She lives with her boyfriend, Art Kamen, and acts as a stepmother to Art&#x27;s two teenage daughters, Dory and Fia. Meanwhile, as Lu Ling is showing signs of dementia, Ruth struggles to juggle her mother&#x27;s illness, her job, and her relationship. As an adult, Ruth struggles to understand her mother and her strange behavior during Ruth&#x27;s childhood. Although she loves her mother, she also resents her for having criticized her harshly when she was young and forcing her to obey strict rules. Lu Ling believed that young Ruth had the ability to communicate with the spirit world, and often expected her to produce messages from the ghost of Lu Ling&#x27;s long-dead nursemaid, Precious Auntie, by writing on a sand tray.

Lu Ling&#x27;s autobiography makes up the middle section of this book. This story within a story describes Lu Ling&#x27;s early life in a small Chinese village called Immortal Heart. Lu Ling is raised by a mute, burned nursemaid called &quot;Precious Auntie.&quot; It is later revealed that Precious Auntie sustained her injuries by swallowing burning ink resin. Although the oldest daughter in her family, Lu Ling is ignored by her mother in favor of her younger sister Gao Ling. However, Precious Auntie was entirely devoted to caring for Lu Ling.

Lu Ling&#x27;s story goes further back, describing Precious Auntie&#x27;s childhood as the daughter of a local bonesetter. The teenaged Precious Auntie is the only person who knows the location of a hidden cave where many ancient &quot;dragon bones&quot; can be found, knowledge that she retains even after being burned and coming to live with Lu Ling&#x27;s family. After the discovery of the Peking Man, fossilized bones and information about where they might be found becomes extremely valuable. A local family, the Changs, wish to arrange a marriage between Lu Ling and their son Fu Nan because they believe that Lu Ling can lead them to the fossil cave. Lu Ling&#x27;s family approves of the marriage, but Precious Auntie violently opposes it. Unable to speak in detail, she writes Lu Ling a long letter explaining her reasons, but Lu Ling does not read it to its end.

Only after Precious Auntie&#x27;s death does Lu Ling learn that her nursemaid was actually her mother, and that the woman she had thought to be her mother is actually her father&#x27;s sister. After Precious Auntie&#x27;s death, Gao Ling marries Fu Nan and Lu Ling is sent away to a Christian orphanage where she completes her education, grows up and becomes a teacher. Here, she meets her first husband, Pan Kai Jing. Lu Ling lives in the orphanage as a teacher through World War II, often going to extreme lengths to protect the students from the Japanese soldiers and other dangers. A few years later, she is reunited with Gao Ling. The two &quot;sisters&quot; immigrate to America separately and marry a pair of brothers, Edmund and Edwin. Lu Ling&#x27;s second husband dies from a hit and run accident when Ruth is just two years old.

Ruth struggles growing up as the child of a single parent who believes in curses and ghosts. Once Ruth learns the details of her mother&#x27;s past, she gains a new understanding of her and her seemingly erratic behavior. Answers to both women&#x27;s problems unfold as Lu Ling&#x27;s story is finally revealed in its entirety.

==Reception==
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; review under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Guardian&quot;, and &quot;Independent&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; review under &quot;Ok&quot; and &quot;TLS&quot; review under &quot;Rubbish&quot;.
==Opera==

The novel was made into an opera that premiered at San Francisco&#x27;s War Memorial Opera House and was performed by the San Francisco Opera on September 13, 2008. The opera was composed by Stewart Wallace, and the libretto penned by Amy Tan. The opera condenses the novel&#x27;s plot through various devices: it omits peripheral characters and the subplot about the Christian orphanage and expands Chang the Coffin Maker into the key villain. He rapes Precious Auntie after killing her father, the Bonesetter, and unknowingly fathers Lu Ling. The score folds traditional Chinese brass and percussion into a Western orchestra, with Chinese classical musicians led by Wu Tong and Li Zhonghua performing at the premiere. The suona, a raucous reed horn, features in the orchestration and is played onstage several times. The character of Precious Auntie sings and moves in the kunju style of Chinese Opera and was created and enacted by kunju star Qian Yi at the premiere. The other members of the premiere cast included mezzo-soprano Zheng Cao singing the dual roles of Ruth and the youthful Liu Ling, mezzo-soprano Ning Liang as Old Lu Ling, bass Hao Jiang Tian as Chang, folk/pop vocalist and suona player Wu Tong as the Taoist priest, baritone James Maddalena as Ruth&#x27;s husband, Art Kamen, mezzo-soprano Catherine Cook as Art&#x27;s mother Arlene Kamen and as Madame Wang in the flashback to Immortal Heart village, bass-baritone Valery Portnov as Art&#x27;s father, Marty Kamen, with 14-year-old Madelaine Matej and 17-year-old Rose Frazier, respectively, playing Art&#x27;s teen daughters, Dory and Fia Kamen. Chang&#x27;s wives were played by Mary Finch, Natasha Ramirez Leland, and Erin Neff. The Dalian Acrobatic Troupe performed aerial and floor stunts and played numerous supernumerary roles alongside the San Francisco Opera Chorus. The premiere was directed by Chen Shi-Zheng and conducted by Steven Sloane.

==Stage Play==
An adaptation of the book debuted in Seattle, WA on June 10, 2022, when Book-It Repertory Theatre produced a world premiere. Adapted by Desdemona Chiang, it was directed by Rosa Joshi. The ensemble of strong actors included Desieree Me Jung (Lu Ling), Khanh Doan (Precious Auntie), Sunam Ellis (Ruth), Coco Justino (The Bonesetter&#x27;s Daughter), Mona Leach (Gao Ling), Mara Palma (Lu Ling&#x27;s &quot;mother&quot;), Nabilah Ahmed (Kai Jing) and Kathy Hsieh (many women).

<doc id="676754" wikidata="Q1083724" url="?curid=676754" title="Ciao Darwin">
<text>Ciao Darwin is a variety game show format created and hosted by Paolo Bonolis (Stefano Magnaghi is the co-creator), and produced by the Italian mass media company Mediaset.

There are two competing teams of 50 people each, usually made up of people who fit certain opposing stereotypes. In each game, two members of the audience are selected at random, one from each team, indicated by a light in front of them which remains illuminated when all the other team members&#x27; lights have gone off. The games involve contestants competing in acts of skill, intelligence and general knowledge, with deliberately ridiculous results, trying to mimic the mechanism of natural selection theorized by Charles Darwin. Some of the games are designed to humiliate the contestants, especially an assault course which was introduced with the Italian version in 2010, and the Finale which is a water tank game.

At each round a score by a vote in the studio by the audience consisting of 300 people. The sum of points at the end of the various tests determines the team in the lead for the Finale.

==Original italian version==
In Italy it was aired on Canale 5 from 1998 until 2000, hosted by Italian celebrities Paolo Bonolis and Luca Laurenti, and it returned again in 2003, 2007, 2010, 2016, 2019 and 2023–2024.

==Format==
===Early rounds===
The early round in the show consists of singing a song, a debate between the two teams, an intelligence test and a test of courage.

===The Obstacle Course (Italian version from 2010)===
In the Obstacle Course round, officially called &quot;Genodrome&quot;, five or six randomly selected contestants from each team have to make their way around an assault course consisting mainly of:

* Crawling under nets, through cloth tubes or through elastic strings
* Climbing over a slippery slope and slide
* Crossing a pool by jumping onto unstable floating pontoons (series 6 &amp; 7) or trying to dodge men in inflatable tubes (series 8) 
* Crossing another pool by leaping along padded horizontal rotating rollers (series 6 to 8) or jumping in and squeezing between vertical rollers (series 9)
* Being carried across the pool by four further teammates (series 9)

Some contestants cannot make it up the slippery slope and are eliminated from the round. Points are awarded for each competitor who successfully gets to the end of the course, and further points are awarded if a further competitor who slides down a rope manages to attach themselves with Velcro to a target on a vertical wall.

In the Italian version in 2016, one variation is that fire hoses were played on the competitors as they try to cross the pontoons, and another variation involves them having to jump into the pool fully clothed and swim past the pontoons using inflatable rubber sharks as buoyancy aids.

The contestants are given trainer shoes, and elbow, knee and head protection. In series 6 to 8, they wore the outer garments they were wearing to the show over a short swimskin. In series 9, they are given a lifejacket for the pool-based part of the course but no swimskin, and remain fully dressed in the clothes they arrived in.

Almost all contestants get totally soaked in garments ranging from casual wear or fancy dress to expensive dresses or suits which are ruined by the water. The pools are approximately 1.3m deep and filled with cold water, and falling from the rollers resulted in total immersion.

===The Fashion Show===
This round consists of a fashion show featuring a number of competitors from each team dressed for different contexts: &quot;daytime&quot;, &quot;evening&quot;, &quot;disco&quot;, &quot;intimate male&quot; and &quot;intimate female&quot;.

===The Finale===
In the Finale, the two selected contestants sit in tanks that are filled with more water each time an incorrect answer is given (and, in the case of the Italian and Polish versions, each time the other contestant gives a correct answer). There are variations between the rules in the Italian, Romanian, Hungarian, Polish and Greek versions. The tank is cylindrical in shape in all but the Polish version, where it has flat sides. The tank is entered through a door in the back or side which is sealed when the game begins. The water rises by increments that are marked on the side of the tank (except in Poland). The number of these varies:

* Italy – six – the loser is the first tank to be filled to the sixth level
* Romania – ten – the loser is the first who cannot remain seated and hold their breath underwater, which usually happens after level 8 or 9
* Hungary – nine – the loser is the first who cannot remain seated and hold their breath underwater, which usually happens after level 8
* Poland and Greece – five - the loser is the first who cannot remain seated and hold their breath underwater, which usually happens after level 4

As with the Obstacle Course round, the contestants remain fully dressed and participate in the clothes that they were already wearing to the show, although they are allowed to take off their shoes (except in the Romanian version) and their jewellery (except in the Italian version).

The tanks are filled with an initial amount of water determined by the relative scores of the competing teams (usually one increment for every 50 points difference). Normally this is between one and three increments. In theory, it would be possible to answer all questions correctly and go away with just wet feet. In practice, however, the water level rises to at least chest height.

There have been some other strange variations, such as two people from the same team sitting together in the tank, contestants blindfolded, creatures like toads, snakes and ducks added, and dyed or foamy water being used. In all but the Hungarian version, contestants are given a snorkel to help them breathe, although this is seldom used. In the Hungarian and Polish versions, the rule about remaining seated is strictly enforced, and this often leads to the fully clothed contestants being totally under the water by the end.

The voice commentary in the official promotional video for the Ciao Darwin franchise states &quot;each week a winner emerges triumphant, and the loser is left all wet&quot;, suggesting that they are not offered a dry change of clothes to go home.

==International versions==

<doc id="676767" wikidata="Q2920380" url="?curid=676767" title="Common scold">
<text>In the common law of crime in England and Wales, a common scold was a type of public nuisance—a troublesome and angry person who broke the public peace by habitually chastising, arguing, and with their neighbours. Most punished for scolding were women, though men could be found to be scolds.

The offence, which carried across in the English colonisation of the Americas, was punished by fines and public humiliation: dunking (being arm-fastened into a chair and dunked into a river or pond); parading through the street; being put in the scold&#x27;s bridle (branks) or the stocks. Selling bad bread or bad ale was also punished in these ways in some parts of England in medieval centuries.

None of the physical punishments is known to have been administered (such as by magistrates) since an instance in 1817 that involved a wheeling through the streets. Washington D.C. authorities imposed a fine against a writer against clerics, declared a common scold, in 1829. The offence and punishment were abolished in England and Wales in 1967, and formally in New Jersey in 1972.

==The offence and its punishment==

=== Medieval England ===
The offence of scolding developed from the late Middle Ages in England. A British historian suggests attempts to control and punish &#x27;bad speech&#x27; increased after the Black Death, when demographic shift led to greater resistance and threats to the status quo. This included prosecutions for scolding. Scolds were described using Latin terms, including and , found in masculine and feminine forms (, etc.) in medieval legal records and all referring to negative forms of speech, chatter, quarrelling or reproachment. These offences were commonly presented and punished in manorial or borough courts that governed the behaviour of peasants and townspeople across England; with a scarce few to the parish vestry. The most common punishment was a fine.

Some historians write of scolding and bad speech coded as feminine offences by the late medieval period. Women of all marital statuses were prosecuted for scolding. The married were featured most often, whereas widows were only rarely labelled scolds. In places such as Exeter scolds were typically poorer women—elsewhere scolds could include members of the local elite. Women who were also charged with matters such as violence, nightwandering, eavesdropping, flirting or adultery were also likely to be labelled scolds. People were in some parts frequently labelled &#x27;common scolds&#x27;, indicating the impact of their behaviour and speech on a community. Karen Jones identified 13 men prosecuted for scolding in Kent&#x27;s secular courts, compared to 94 women and 2 couples.

Many of the male minority convicted were co-accused with their wives. In 1434, Helen Bradwall (wife of Peter Bradwall), scolded Hugh Welesson and his wife Isabel in Middlewich, calling Isabel a &quot;child murderer&quot; and Hugh a &quot;skallet [wretched] knave&quot;. Isabel and Hugh also scolded Helen, calling her a &quot;lesyng blebberer&quot; (lying blatherer). All parties were fined for the offences—Hugh and Isabel: jointly. Like women, male scolds were often accused of many other offences, such as fornication, theft, illegal trading, and assault.

=== Later punishments of scolding ===
Later legal treatises reflect the dominance of scolding as a charge levied against women. In the &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, Blackstone outlines the offence:


This ascribes the shift to &quot;ducking stool&quot; to a folk etymology. Other writers disagree with this: the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; notes the use of a form of cucking stool at Chester as a , a &quot;dung chair&quot;, whose punishment apparently involved exposing the sitter&#x27;s buttocks to onlookers. This seat served to punish not only scolds, but also brewers and bakers who sold bad ale or bread, whereas the ducking stool dunked its victim into the water.

French traveller and writer Francois Maximilian Misson recorded the means used in England in the early 18th century:

The ducking stool, rather than being fixed by the water, could be mounted on wheels to allow the convict to be paraded through the streets before punishment was carried out. Another method of ducking was to use the tumbrel: a chair on two wheels with two long shafts fixed to joining axles. This would be pushed into the water and the shafts would be released, tipping the chair up backwards and ducking the occupant.

A scold&#x27;s bridle, known in Scotland as a brank, consists of a locking metal mask or head cage that contains a tab that fits in the mouth to inhibit talking. Some have claimed that convicted common scolds had to wear such a device as a preventive or punitive measure. Legal sources do not mention them in the context. Anecdotes report their use as a public punishment.

In 17th-century New England and Long Island, scolds or those convicted of similar offences—men and women—could be sentenced to stand with their tongue in a cleft stick, a more primitive but easier-to-construct version of the bridle—alternatively, to the ducking stool.

==Prosecutions==
A plaque on the Fye Bridge in Norwich, England, claims to mark the site of a &quot;cucking&quot; stool, and that from 1562 to 1597 strumpets (flirtatious or promiscuous young women) and common scolds suffered dunking there. In the &quot;Percy Anecdotes&quot;, published pseudonymously by Thomas Byerley and Joseph Clinton Robertson in 18211823, the authors state that &quot;How long the ducking-stool has been in disuse in England does not appear.&quot; The &quot;Anecdotes&quot; also suggest penological ineffectiveness as grounds for the stool&#x27;s disuse; the text relates the 1681 case of a Mrs. Finch, who had received three convictions and duckings as a common scold. On her fourth conviction, the King&#x27;s Bench declined to dunk her again, ordering a fine of three marks and jail until payment took place.

The &quot;Percy Anecdotes&quot; also quote a pastoral poem by John Gay (16851732), who wrote that:

and a 1780 poem by Benjamin West, who wrote that:

While these literary sources do not prove that the punishment still took place, they do provide evidence that it had not been forgotten.

In &quot;The Queen v Foxby&quot;, 6 Mod. 11 (1704), counsel for the accused stated that he knew of no law for the dunking of scolds. Lord Chief Justice John Holt of the Queen&#x27;s Bench apparently pronounced this error, for he announced that it was &quot;better ducking in a Trinity, than a Michaelmas term&quot;, i.e. better carried out in summer than in winter. The tenor of Holt&#x27;s remarks suggests that he found the punishment a rare or dead local custom seen by the sovereign&#x27;s court as risible.

The last recorded uses of ducking stool were
*a Mrs. Ganble at Plymouth (1808)
*Jenny Pipes, a &quot;notorious&quot; scold from Leominster (1809)
*Sarah Leeke (1817) from Leominster was sentenced to be ducked but the water in the pond was so low that the authorities merely wheeled her round the town in the chair.

In 1812, federal enforcement of common law offences was held to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Hudson and Goodwin&quot;. Nevertheless, in 1829, a Washington, D.C., court found the American anti-clerical writer Anne Royall guilty of being a common scold, the outcome of a campaign launched by local clergymen. A traditional &quot;engine&quot; for intended punishment was built by sailors at the Navy Yard. The court ruled the punishment of the ducking-stool obsolete and instead imposed a fine of ten dollars.

==Current status of the law==
Counsel in &quot;Sykes v. Director of Public Prosecutions&quot; [1962] AC 528 said he could find no cases for more than a century and described the offence as &quot;obsolete&quot;. Section 13(1)(a) of the Criminal Law Act 1967 abolished it.

The common law offence endured in New Jersey until struck down in 1972 in &quot;State v. Palendrano&quot; by Circuit Judge McGann, who found it had been subsumed in the provisions of the Disorderly Conduct Act of 1898, was bad for vagueness and offended the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution for sex discrimination. It was also opined that the punishment of ducking could amount to a punishment, in which case that punishment was unlawful under the New Jersey Constitution of 1844 or since 1776.

In the United States, many states have laws restricting public profanity, excessive noise, and disorderly conduct. None of these laws carry the distinctive punishment originally reserved for the common scold, nor are they gender-centric as the offence was.

<doc id="676778" wikidata="Q7387639" url="?curid=676778" title="S. Lane Faison">
<text>Samson Lane Faison, Jr. (November 16, 1907 – November 11, 2006) was an American art historian, professor, and director of the Williams College Museum of Art. He was one of the famed &quot;Monuments Men&quot; in World War II.

==Early life==
Faison was born in Washington, D.C., to Eleanor Sowers and Samson L. Faison in 1907. His father was a West Point graduate and a general in World War I. Lane had one sibling, a younger sister named Eleanor. A boyhood trip to France that included a chance visit to Chartres Cathedral awakened a passion for art and inspired his future career.

He was himself trained at Williams (class of 1929) by Karl E. Weston, who inspired an earlier generation of art scholars in the 1920s. During the 1930s, after receiving an M.A. from Harvard (1930) and an MFA from Princeton (1932), he was a very close assistant to French visiting scholars at Yale, Marcel Aubert and Henri Focillon. He translated into English the major work of Focillon, &quot;La vie des formes&quot; (&quot;The Life of Forms in Art&quot;, New York, Wittenborn, Schultz, 1948).

== Career ==
Faison later headed the Williams College art history department from 1940 to 1969 and directed the Williams College Museum of Art from 1948 to 1976.

While directing the Williams College Museum of Art and art history department, Faison made it his mission to inspire interest in art history among students at Williams College. Dramatically expanding the museum&#x27;s collections, especially in contemporary art, Faison encouraged his students to see the compatibility of their art historical studies with all aspects of their lives as Williams students, from their fraternity parties to their English literature classes. Many of his students began their freshman year at Williams planning to become doctors, lawyers, and investment bankers, but, upon graduation, found themselves turning to the art world due to Faison&#x27;s inspirational pedagogy. Adding a new Art Studio curriculum to what was then Williams&#x27;s &quot;Fine Arts&quot; department, Faison emphasized learning by doing and developed the emphasis on visual analysis of shape, color, and form that has become the most distinctive element of the college&#x27;s Art History sequence.

In 2004, he told the &quot;New York Times&quot;:

I always stressed two things. One has to do with the connection of art to history, with the fact that every work of art was done somewhere and some when, and that this is very important to understand. The other side has to do with the medium of art, which is quite different from the subject. What we&#x27;re talking about is color and shape. You&#x27;d be surprised at the number of people who come to Williams, and I think this is generally true of American students, with absolutely no idea of what the word &#x27;shape&#x27; means or what you can do with it and why it&#x27;s important. They have easily mastered the medium of language, but many of them know very little about the medium of art.

Several of his students went on to direct major museums including Earl A. Powell III of the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., Glenn D. Lowry of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, James N. Wood of the Getty Trust and Art Institute of Chicago, and Thomas Krens of the Guggenheim Museum in New York.

== Monuments Man ==
Faison was a Navy Reservist during World War II, attaining the rank of lieutenant commander. In 1945 he was posted to the Office of Strategic Services&#x27; Art Looting Investigation Unit. He wrote the official top-secret report (see selected publications) on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s collection of stolen art. Five years later, he supervised the return of stolen art under the direction of the Department of State to major European cities such as Vienna and Paris. In 1952, he was awarded a Chevalier of French Legion of Honour for his service. Faison wrote as art critic for &quot;The Nation&quot; from 1951 to 1955.

== Personal ==
In 1935 he married Virginia Weed (d. 1997), a native of Savannah and graduate of Smith College. They had four sons: Gordon Lane (b. 1937), George Weston (b. 1940), Christopher Maury (b. 1944), and Samson Lane III (b. 1947).

S. Lane Faison, Jr. died on November 11, 2006, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, five days shy of his 99th birthday

<text>In the Middle Ages, Termagant or Tervagant was the name of a god that some European Christians believed Muslims worshipped. It originates in the eleventh-century &quot;Song of Roland&quot;

The word is also used in modern English to mean a violent, overbearing, turbulent, brawling, quarrelsome woman; a virago, shrew, or vixen. In the past, the word could be applied to any person or thing personified, not just a woman.

==Etymology==
European literature from the Middle Ages often refers to Muslims as pagans and depicts them worshipping Muhammad along with various idols and sometimes other deities, such as Apollyon, Lucifer and Termagant. In some writings, such as the &quot;Song of Roland&quot;, these were combined to create an &quot;unholy Trinity&quot; of sorts composed of Apollyon, Muhammad and Termagant.

The original form of the name is &quot;Tervagan&quot;. There are many hypotheses explaining the origin of the name, but it does not seem to derive from any actual aspect of Muslim belief or practice, however wildly distorted. Gustav Beckmann lists 23 different theories. He defends that first proposed by Ugo Foscolo in 1819 that Tervagan is the &quot;dea trivia&quot;, the threefold moon goddess Luna–Diana–Persephone (or Selene–Artemis–Hecate), attested since classical antiquity. Thus, &quot;ter vagan&quot; means &#x27;three wandering [i.e., like the moon]&#x27;. Apollyon (Apollin) is simply Apollo, Diana&#x27;s brother.

Walter William Skeat, accepting the meaning &quot;thrice wandering&quot; as a reference to the moon, tied the name &quot;Trivagante&quot; to the Islamic use of crescent moon imagery. Joseph T. Shipley argues that the Italian &quot;Trivigante&quot; became confused with , meaning &quot;boaster,&quot; derived from Hermes Trismegistus, leading to Termagant. Leo Spitzer argues that Tervagant, like several other names ending in &quot;-ant&quot; from the Matter of France (e.g. Baligant and Morgant), is an &quot;occitanization&quot; of a vulgar Latin present participle created by Old French poets for exotic effect. He proposes as its etymon &quot;terrificans&quot; (&quot;terrifying&quot;), appropriate for a god. Alternately, Aleksander Gieysztor derives the name from the Slavic deity Triglav, with the name having spread west into French-speaking lands.

James A. Bellamy proposes that the names Tervagan and Apollin in the &quot;Song of Roland&quot; derive from Ibn ʿAffān and Abū Bakr, two of Muhammad&#x27;s companions, in-laws and successors.

==Termagant in literature==
Whatever its origins, &quot;Termagant&quot; became established in the West as the supposed name of the principal idol supposedly worshipped by Saracens, being regularly mentioned in chivalric romances and &quot;chansons de geste&quot;. The spelling of the name varies considerably (&quot;Tervigant, Tervagant, Tarvigant&quot;, etc.).

In Occitan literature, the troubadour Austorc d&#x27;Aorlhac refers to Bafomet and Termagant (&quot;Tervagan&quot;) side by side in one &quot;sirventes&quot;, referring also to the latter&#x27;s &quot;companions&quot;.

In the 15th-century Middle English romance &quot;Syr Guy of Warwick&quot;, a Sultan swears an oath by Termagant.

In the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot;, the Saracens, having lost the battle of Roncesvalles, desecrate their &quot;pagan idols&quot; (lines 2589–90) including Tervagan.

Tervagant is also a statue worshipped by the &quot;king of Africa&quot; in the Jean Bodel play in Old French after the end of the Third Crusade (c.1200), &quot;Le jeu de saint Nicolas&quot;.

In the &quot;Sowdone of Babylone&quot;, the sultan makes a vow to Termagaunte(lines 135–40): 
:Of Babiloyne the riche Sowdon,
:Moost myghty man he was of moolde;
:He made a vowe to Termagaunte:
:Whan Rome were distroied and hade myschaunce,
:He woolde turne ayen erraunte
:And distroye Charles, the Kinge of Fraunce.

In Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, &quot;Sir Thopas&quot; (supposed to be told by Chaucer himself on the pilgrimage) is a parody of these chivalric romances. In the tale, a knight giant named &quot;Sir Oliphaunt&quot; is made to swear an oath by Termagant.

In Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Mardi&quot; (Chapters 25, 26, 28), Samoa&#x27;s wife Annatoo is described as a Termagant, and metaphorically referred to as Antonina (wife of Belisarius) to Samoa&#x27;s Belisarius. Explaining why she did not need the armaments on the ship, Melville writes &quot;Her voice was a park of artillery; her talons a charge of bayonets.&quot; (Chapter 23.)

Ludovico Ariosto used the form &quot;Trivigante&quot;.

It has been claimed that Termagant became a stock character in medieval mystery plays but another source denies this. In the theatre, Termagant was usually depicted as a turbanned creature who wore a long, Eastern style gown. As a stage-villain, he would rant at and threaten the lesser villains who were his servants and worshipers.

==&quot;Termagant&quot; as a ranting bully and a shrewish woman==
As a result of the theatrical tradition, by Shakespeare&#x27;s day the term had come to refer to a bullying person. &quot;Henry IV, part 1&quot; contains a reference to &quot;that hot termagant Scot&quot;. In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the hero says of ham actors that &quot;I would have such a fellow whipped for o&#x27;er-doing Termagant, it out-Herods Herod&quot;. Herod, like Termagant, was also a character from medieval drama who was famous for ranting. Beaumont and Fletcher&#x27;s play, &quot;A King and No King&quot;, contains the line &quot;This would make a saint swear like a soldier, and a soldier like Termagant.&quot;

Mainly because of Termagant&#x27;s depiction in long gowns, and given that female roles were routinely played by male actors in Shakespearean times, English audiences got the mistaken notion that the character was female, or at least that he resembled a mannish woman. As a result, the name &quot;termagant&quot; came increasingly to be applied to a woman with a quarrelsome, scolding quality, a sense that it retains today. This was a well-established usage by the late 17th century. Thomas Shadwell&#x27;s play &quot;The Squire of Alsatia&quot; (1688) contains a character called Mrs Termagant who is out for revenge on one of the other characters, and is described as a &quot;furious, malicious, and revengeful woman; perpetually plaguing him, and crossing him in all his designs; pursuing him continually with her malice, even to the attempting of his life.&quot; Arthur Murphy&#x27;s play &quot;The Upholsterer&quot; (1758) also contains a female character called &quot;Termagant&quot;. In Washington Irving&#x27;s &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot; (1819), Dame Van Winkle is described as a &quot;termagant wife&quot;. &quot;Virago&quot;, &quot;fishwife&quot; and &quot;&quot; are near-synonyms for &quot;termagant&quot; in this sense. In season 2 of &quot;Westworld&quot;, Major Craddock calls Dolores a termagant.

The term is still sometimes used of men. In 2008, the Australian politician Kim Beazley labelled opponent Tony Abbott a termagant.

<text>The Town of Victoria Park is a local government area of Western Australia. It covers an area of 17.62 km² in metropolitan Perth, the capital of Western Australia. It had a population of approximately 35,000 as at the 2016 census.

It lies on the southern side of the Swan River, to the south-east of the Perth CBD, and is connected to Fremantle and South Perth via Canning Highway; to the Perth CBD by Graham Farmer Freeway and The Causeway; to Belmont and Perth Airport by Great Eastern Highway and to Cannington by Shepperton Road and Albany Highway. The Perth–Armadale rail line passes through Burswood and forms the eastern boundaries of Lathlain and Carlisle.

The Town of Victoria Park is bounded on the east by the City of Belmont, on the south by the City of Canning on the west by the City of South Perth and on the north by City of Vincent and the City of Perth.

== History ==

Victoria Park first had its own local government between 1894 and 1917. The Victoria Park Road District was established on 17 May 1894. The road district was reconstituted as the Municipality of Victoria Park on 30 April 1897, but was amalgamated into the City of Perth on 1 November 1917.

The modern Town of Victoria Park was established as the Town of Shepperton on 1 July 1994 as a result of the Government of Western Australia having decided to split up part of the City of Perth and create three new municipalities: the Town of Shepperton, Town of Vincent and the Town of Cambridge. The Town of Shepperton was renamed Victoria Park on 2 November 1994.

== Wards ==
The town is divided into two wards along Shepperton Road, each with four councillors:

* Banksia Ward (previously the Carlisle Ward)
* Jarrah Ward (previously the Victoria Park Ward)

== Councillors ==

<doc id="676810" wikidata="Q1573718" url="?curid=676810" title="City of Vincent">
<text>The City of Vincent is a local government area of Western Australia. It covers an area of approximately in metropolitan Perth, the capital of Western Australia, and lies about 3 km from the Perth CBD. The City of Vincent maintains 139 km of roads and 104 ha of parks and gardens. It had a population of over 33,000 at the 2016 Census.

== History ==
The City of Vincent is named after the street of that name that runs through it, which itself was believed to have been named by the chief draftsman in the Lands Department, George Vincent, after himself in about 1876. George Vincent was the recipient of the land on the north side of the street, east of Charles Street, in the first Crown grant of Perth.

In May 1895, the developing area that included Leederville and West Leederville was gazetted the Leederville Roads Board.

In 1895, the Leederville Roads Board became a municipality, and in April 1897 was divided into north, south and central wards. By this point the municipal population had reached more than one thousand people.

In 1914, the greater Perth movement led to the amalgamation of the municipalities of North Perth, Leederville and Perth (subsequently joined in 1917 by Victoria Park).

On 1 July 1994, the restructuring of the City of Perth by the Government of Western Australia created three new local governments: the Town of Vincent, the Town of Cambridge and the Town of Shepperton (now the Town of Victoria Park), plus a smaller City of Perth. It became the City of Vincent when it gained city status on 1 July 2011.

In 2014, a municipal reform proposal to abolish the City and split its territory between the City of Perth and the City of Stirling was countered with a proposal to amalgamate Vincent with Perth. Ultimately these negotiations failed and the reform process was abandoned, with no change to the boundaries of the City of Vincent.

<doc id="676811" wikidata="Q168983" url="?curid=676811" title="Conflagration">
<text>A conflagration is a large fire. Conflagrations often damage human life, animal life, health, and/or property. A conflagration can begin accidentally or be intentionally created (arson). A very large fire can produce a firestorm, in which the central column of rising heated air induces strong inward winds, which supply oxygen to the fire. Conflagrations can cause casualties including deaths or injuries from burns, trauma due to collapse of structures and attempts to escape, and smoke inhalation.

Firefighting is the practice of extinguishing a conflagration, protecting life and property and minimizing damage and injury. One of the goals of fire prevention is to avoid conflagrations. When a conflagration is extinguished, there is often a fire investigation to determine the cause of the fire.
==Causes and types==

During a conflagration a significant movement of air and combustion products occurs. Hot gaseous products of combustion move upward, causing the influx of more dense cold air to the combustion zone. Sometimes, the influx is so intense that the fire grows into a firestorm.

Inside a building, the intensity of gas exchange depends on the size and location of openings in walls and floors, the ceiling height, and the amount and characteristics of the combustible materials.

*Industrial conflagrations include fires at oil refineries, such as the 2009 Cataño oil refinery fire.
*Wildfires are fires in forests or other undeveloped areas, and may grow into a conflagration.
*An urban conflagration is defined as a &quot;large, destructive fire that spreads beyond natural or artificial barriers; it can be expected to result in large monetary loss and may or may not include fatalities. An urban conflagration moves beyond a block and destroys whole sections of a city.&quot; Notable examples includes the Great Fire of London in 1666, the Great Fire of Tartu in 1775, the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, and the Great Fire of Hamburg in 1842, and the Camp Fire in Paradise, California in 2018, which burned 18,000 structures and killed 85 people.
*On board ships, a large uncontained fire may quickly lead to a ship conflagration. 
*The conflagration of a building is known as a structure fire.

<text>The City of Wanneroo is a local government area with city status in the northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia. It is centred approximately north of Perth&#x27;s central business district and forms part of the northern boundary of the Perth metropolitan area. Wanneroo encompasses the federal divisions of Cowan, Moore and Pearce.

The city&#x27;s main commercial and residential town centres are located at Wanneroo in the east and Clarkson in the north. Further urban centres are planned at Alkimos, Yanchep and Two Rocks in the future to coincide with rapid metropolitan expansion and development in the area. It is also home to the Yanchep and Neerabup National Parks, as well as the Neerabup Industrial Estate in the north.

From the city&#x27;s inception until 1998, it also incorporated the neighbouring City of Joondalup in its entirety.

==Geography==
Wanneroo covers a land area totalling . The city is bounded by Beach Road and the City of Stirling to the south, Alexander Drive and the City of Swan to the east, Wanneroo Road and Lake Joondalup to the south-west, the Indian Ocean to the west and the Shire of Gingin to the north.

Wanneroo&#x27;s population is concentrated in three locations: at the southern end centred on Girrawheen; in the region surrounding Wanneroo near the city&#x27;s geographical centre; and along the northern Perth coastline centred on Clarkson, separated from Joondalup by the rural localities of Neerabup and Tamala Park. Land in the city&#x27;s north and east is predominantly rural in character.

The City of Wanneroo encompasses one of Perth&#x27;s busiest industrial areas, Wangara. It is situated roughly 20 km north of the central business district, and is the industrial hub of the north side of Perth. The suburb of Wangara is a hub for commercial manufacturing, vehicle dealerships, industrial glaziers and commercial distribution warehousing. It is also roughly 10 km from Joondalup, Perth&#x27;s largest satellite city north of the Swan River.

==History==
Prior to 1902, Wanneroo was part of the Perth Road District, which eventually went on to become the City of Stirling. The Wanneroo Road District was established on 31 October 1902 under the &quot;Roads Act 1888&quot;. The board was named after the Wanneroo wetlands in the area, first explored and recorded by John Butler in 1834.

With the passage of the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;, all road boards became shires effective from 1 July 1961, and the Shire of Wanneroo came into being, encompassing everything north of Beach Road and west of Alexander Drive. With the development of and subsequent population growth surrounding Joondalup, the Shire of Wanneroo attained City status on 31 October 1985.

On 1 July 1998, on the recommendation of a report by the Local Government Advisory Committee, the City of Wanneroo was bifurcated. The southwestern section, encompassing the urban centre of Joondalup, was separately incorporated as the new City of Joondalup. The remainder, including the inland suburbs east of Lake Joondalup and the coastal suburbs north of Burns Beach, formed a reduced Shire of Wanneroo, which quickly regained City status on 1 July 1999. As this was before the local government elections to elect a mayor and councillors, the second incarnation of the Shire did not have a Shire President.

==Demographics==
The City of Wanneroo has experienced significant population growth of almost 110,000 persons in the 15 years between the 2001 Census and 2016 Census. The city also has the second largest population of any local government area in greater Perth.

With less than 53% of the population having been born in Australia at the 2016 Census, Wanneroo has a large immigrant populace. Over 13% of Wanneroo&#x27;s residents were born in the United Kingdom, compared to less than 4.0% nationwide. New Zealanders, Vietnamese and South Africans compose the city&#x27;s most significant minority populations.

==Transport==
The City of Wanneroo is served by two major north–south arterial roads, Wanneroo Road and Marmion Avenue. The two roads run parallel to each other through Wanneroo&#x27;s eastern and western suburbs respectively. A third north–south arterial route, the Mitchell Freeway, extends north from Joondalup to terminate in the south of Alkimos.

The City of Wanneroo has five railway stations in Clarkson, Butler, Alkimos, Eglinton and Yanchep, which are all served by the Yanchep line.

==Governance==

The Wanneroo City Council operates out of the Council Chambers on Dundebar Road, Wanneroo.

The current mayor is Linda Aitken, who was elected in September 2022.

Elections are held every four years, for a mayor and 14 councillors across the city&#x27;s seven electoral wards, covering 36 suburbs. Two councillors are elected to each of the wards.

===Local government wards===
==Sister cities==
Wanneroo has three sister cities. It was also formerly twinned with Sorrento in Italy, but this association was broken with the bifurcation of Wanneroo in 1998, when the Wanneroo suburb of Sorrento was incorporated into the City of Joondalup.

<doc id="676824" wikidata="Q57174" url="?curid=676824" title="Franz Halder">
<text>Franz Halder (30 June 1884 – 2 April 1972) was a German general and the chief of staff of the Army High Command (OKH) in Nazi Germany from 1938 until September 1942. During World War II, he directed the planning and implementation of Operation Barbarossa, the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union. Halder became instrumental in the radicalisation of warfare on the Eastern Front. He had his staff draft both the Commissar Order (issued on 6 June 1941) and the Barbarossa Decree (signed on 13 May 1941) that allowed German soldiers to execute Soviet citizens for any reason without fear of later prosecution, leading to numerous war crimes and atrocities during the campaign. After the war, he had a decisive role in the development of the myth of the clean &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;.

Halder began his military service in 1914. In 1937 he met and became a supporter of Adolf Hitler. Halder participated in the strategic planning for the 1939 German invasion of Poland. The plans authorised the SS to carry out security taskson behalf of the armythat included the imprisonment or execution of Poles. In July 1940 he began planning for the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, which began on 22 June 1941. That summer Halder engaged in a long-running and divisive dispute with Hitler over strategy. Hitler removed Halder from command in September 1942. After the 20 July 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler, Halder was arrested as it came to light that he had been involved in an earlier plot, leading to his imprisonment. As chief of OKH General Staff, he had kept extensive notes, later published as &quot;The Halder Diaries&quot;.

After World War II Halder served as a lead consultant for the US Army Historical Division. He oversaw the writing of over 2,500 historical documents by 700 former German officers, whom he instructed to remove material detrimental to the image of the German armed forces. Halder used his influence to foster a false history of the German-Soviet conflict in which the German army fought a &quot;noble war&quot; and which denied its war crimes. The US Army overlooked Halder&#x27;s apologia because Halder&#x27;s group was providing military insights on the Soviet Union that it deemed important in the light of the Cold War. Halder succeeded in his aim of exonerating the German Army: first with the US military, then amongst widening circles of politicians and eventually in American popular culture. In 1961, he was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award.

== Early life and military career ==
Halder was born in Würzburg, the son of an officer. In 1902, he joined an artillery regiment under the command of his father. Halder was educated at the Bavarian War Academy, graduating in 1914. During World War I, he served in a variety of staff roles and was awarded the Iron Cross 1st Class. In 1919, he was transferred to the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, where he served in staff and training roles, including under Walther von Brauchitsch in the army training department. In 1931, he was appointed as chief of staff of a military district. After being promoted to &quot;generalmajor&quot; (general-major) in October 1934, Halder served as the commander of the 7th Infantry Division in Munich.

== In the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; ==

In August 1936, Halder was promoted to &quot;generalleutnant&quot; (lieutenant-general). He then became the director of the Manoeuvres Staff of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. Between October 1937 and February 1938, Halder served as director of the Training Branch, on the General Staff of the Army, in Berlin. During the 1937 &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; manoeuvres, Halder met Adolf Hitler and became a loyal supporter. This personal contact also enabled him to progress through the ranks quickly.

On 1 February 1938, Halder was promoted to general of the Artillery. He was appointed chief of the General Staff of the Army High Command on 1 September. He succeeded General Ludwig Beck who had resigned on 18 August amid the Sudetenland crisis. Halder was approached by conservative nationalist officers about heading the envisaged coup d&#x27;état should Hitler start a war, but he declined. Halder discussed the situation informally with US diplomat Raymond Geist and indicated that the Army feared that Hitler was about to start a war with the West. In any case, the war was averted by the conclusion of the Munich Agreement that ceded Sudetenland to Germany.

== World War II ==
=== Invasions of Poland and Western Europe ===

Halder participated in the strategic planning for the Invasion of Poland. His plans authorised the SS to carry out security tasks on behalf of the army that included the imprisonment or execution of Polish citizens, whether Jewish or gentile. On 1 September 1939, the German offensive began, resulting in declarations of war by France and the British Empire. On 19 September, Halder noted in his diary that he had received information from Reinhard Heydrich. The SS were beginning their campaign to &quot;clean house&quot; in Poland of Jews, intelligentsia, Catholic clergy, and the aristocracy. Halder was aware of The Holocaust but did not object to the murders. He dismissed the crimes as aberrations and refused one general&#x27;s request to pursue the SS and police perpetrators.

At the end of 1939, Halder oversaw the development of the invasion plans of France, the Low Countries and the Balkans. During a meeting with Hitler on 5 November Walther von Brauchitsch, the Army commander-in-chief, attempted to talk Hitler into putting off the invasion of France. Hitler refused and berated Brauchitsch for incompetence. As a consequence, Halder and Brauchitsch discussed overthrowing Hitler because they feared the invasion was doomed. They decided against the idea. On 23 November 1939 Carl Friedrich Goerdeler met with Halder to ask him to reconsider his decision. He refused, saying that Hitler was a great leader, and &quot;one does not rebel when face to face with the enemy&quot;. Halder&#x27;s contemplation of resistance to Hitler owed more to political turf battles than it did to disagreement over the regime&#x27;s racism and antisemitism.

General Erich von Manstein&#x27;s bold plan for invading France through the Ardennes Forest proved successful, and ultimately led to the fall of France. On 19 July 1940, Halder was promoted to &quot;generaloberst&quot; (colonel-general) and began to receive undisclosed monthly extralegal payments from Hitler that effectively doubled his already large wage. The payments helped ensure his loyalty to Hitler and reduced his qualms over sending millions of men to their deaths.

=== Invasion of the Soviet Union ===
On 30 March 1941 Halder attended the conference where Hitler described the planned invasion to about 200 senior &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; officers. He later wrote in his diary, summarising Hitler&#x27;s remarks:
Halder was instrumental in the subsequent preparation and implementation of war crimes during the invasion of the Soviet Union. He had his staff draft both the Commissar Order and the Barbarossa Decree without Hitler&#x27;s instruction or interference. The author of the orders was Eugen Müller, who reported on his work directly to Halder. The Commissar Order required political commissars to be executed immediately when captured. Halder also insisted that a clause be added to the Barbarossa Decree giving officers the right to raze whole villages and execute the inhabitants. The decree freed soldiers from any form of prosecution for war crimes committed in the East. The decree had no specific target: Soviet citizens could be killed at any time and for any reason. Until this time only the SS could kill citizens without fear of later prosecution. These orders allowed officers throughout the army to execute citizens with no repercussions. Ulrich von Hassell, discussing the orders given by Halder, said the conquered population were being controlled by despotism. He added that Germans were being turned into a type of being that previously existed only in enemy propaganda. Omer Bartov described the orders as &quot;the barbarisation of warfare&quot;.

The offensive began on 22 June 1941 where the German forces initially met muted resistance. Halder brashly wrote in his diary on 3 July that the war was already won. Nicolaus von Below reported that this confidence was shared at Fuhrer Headquarters in the month of July. Halder&#x27;s confidence was dashed with dramatic effect in early August with the arrival of new intelligence information from his Foreign Armies East. He wrote in his diary on 11 August that he had underestimated the &quot;Russian colossus&quot;. At the start of the campaign, he had reckoned the enemy had 200 divisions, but now 360 had been counted. He added: &quot;We destroy a dozen of them, then the Russians put another dozen in their place.&quot; In mid-August, the German advance had stalled, and at the same time, effective long-term defence was impossible so far from friendly territory. Halder wrote of the situation: &quot;Everything that has so far been achieved is for nothing.&quot; During that summer, Hitler and the Army General Staff led by Halder had been engaged in a long and divisive dispute over strategy. By mid-September, it was clear Operation Barbarossa had failed in its central objective to quickly overcome the Soviet Union.

==== Operation Typhoon ====

Operation Typhoon, the German offensive at the Battle of Moscow, began on 2 October 1941. In early October, the German forces encircled the bulk of the Soviet armies defending the capital city in the Vyazma and Bryansk pocket. Halder determined the strategy for Typhoon, and it was subsequently endorsed by Hitler. Typhoon had the same basic flaw as Barbarossa; officers on the front line were unable to change Halder&#x27;s objectives even when those objectives were impossible.

The Barbarossa Decree and Commissar Order became a fundamental aspect of the battle for Moscow. By this time, thousands of Soviet civilians and defenceless prisoners in already occupied Russia were being murdered every day. The killings were unprecedented in the modern era and radicalised the defence of Moscow. On 5 December Operation Typhoon was over. Halder wrote in his diary there was no more strength and a withdrawal may be necessary. The withdrawal, when it came, was dictated by the Soviet army. The crisis on the battlefield prompted Hitler to remove von Brauchitsch and assume command of OKH himself.

Halder vehemently pushed for a blitzkrieg assault on Moscow and believed if the capital could be taken the war would be won. However, he did not understand the fundamental underpinnings of blitzkrieg and the impossibility of carrying out a lightning war in the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Even if Moscow had fallen, Stalin would have moved his base of operations farther east and the war would have continued.

David Stahel writes: &quot;The Soviet Union was nothing less than a militarised juggernaut and, while deeply wounded in Germany&#x27;s 1941 campaign, there is no evidence to suggest it was about to collapse either politically or militarily.&quot; The responsibility for the failure fell on Halder, Hitler and Fedor von Bock. The war in the Soviet Union and the winter that followed was one of the worst chapters in the history of the German army—there were over one million casualties.

==== Case Blue ====

In the spring of 1942, Halder, along with the German high command, began planning a new ambitious offensive in the Soviet Union. This was despite the heavy losses the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; had suffered in 1941. Under the code name &quot;Case Blue&quot;, the plan envisaged an offensive against the southern sector of the front. The aim was to capture the Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus. The directive for the offensive was issued by Hitler on 5 April 1942, envisaging a complex sequence of staggered operations. The offensive began on 28 June 1942 and at the outset appeared successful; Friedrich Paulus cut through a defensive position with ease and Bock wrote: &quot;There was nothing left: The enemy has not succeeded in organizing a new defense anywhere.&quot;

The Soviet army had adopted a new strategy known as the &quot;elastic defence&quot; that was highly uncharacteristic of prior engagements and left the German army closing in on an enemy that had already left. Confusion ensued leading to the failure of the campaign. Bock was removed as Commander of Army Group B, replaced by Maximillian von Weichs and Halder was marginalised. The relationship between Hitler and Halder became strained. Halder&#x27;s diary entries became increasingly sarcastic, and Hitler mocked him. On one occasion Hitler said Halder had spent World War I in an office &quot;sitting on that same swivel stool&quot;. On 24 September Hitler replaced Halder as Chief of Staff of the OKH with Kurt Zeitzler and retired him to the Führer Reserve.

=== Imprisonment ===
On 23 July 1944, after the failed 20 July assassination attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life by German Army officers, the Gestapo arrested Halder. Although he was not involved in 20 July plot, intense interrogations of the conspirators revealed that Halder had been involved in earlier conspiracies against Hitler. Halder was imprisoned at both the Flossenbürg and Dachau concentration camps. Halder&#x27;s wife Gertrud chose, and was allowed, to accompany her husband into imprisonment. He had no complaints about the quarters or provisions and was not treated poorly. He was in VIP company that included former French premier Leon Blum and former Austrian Chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg. On 31 January 1945, Halder was officially dismissed from the army. In the last days of April 1945, together with other &quot;special&quot; prisoners, he was transferred to the South Tyrol where he was liberated by US troops.

=== Antisemitism ===

Before the invasion of the Soviet Union, three million soldiers destined for the front received a key order. It was titled &quot;Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia&quot;. The language was determined by Halder. It described Bolshevism as the &quot;mortal enemy of the National Socialist German people&quot; and urged German forces to &quot;crack down hard&quot; and &quot;eliminate all resistance&quot;. Jews were mentioned in the order and intended to be part of the elimination. In April 1941 Halder drafted an order for the security police and Security Service during Operation Marita. The order defined the enemy as saboteurs, terrorists, communists and Jews. The &quot;criminal orders&quot; drafted by Halder document his solidarity with Hitler&#x27;s antisemitic and racist policies. The commanders under Halder including Erich Hoepner, Erich von Manstein and Walter von Reichenau gave antisemitic speeches and orders.

=== Criminal investigation ===

On 5 May 1945, Halder was arrested by the advancing American troops and was interned awaiting trial or release. He was relieved not to be part of the Nuremberg trials; instead, he was tried in a German court on charges of aiding the Nazi regime. Halder denied any knowledge of the regime&#x27;s atrocities and claimed to be outside the decision-making process; he was found not guilty.

During the trial the prosecuting attorney gained access to Halder&#x27;s personal diary which detailed his formulation of the Barbarossa Decree and Commissar Order so he was subsequently sent for retrial. Halder was working for the American Historical Division providing information on the Soviet Union, and the Americans refused to allow the retrial. It was dropped in September 1950.

=== Myth of the clean &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; ===

Halder played a key role in creating the myth of the clean &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. It was a false, mythic view of the Nazi-Soviet war in which the German army fought a &quot;noble war&quot;. It denies the existence of, or disregards, German war crimes. The genesis for the myth was the &quot;Generals&#x27; Memorandum&quot; created in November 1945 and submitted to the International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg. The memorandum was titled &quot;The German Army from 1920 to 1945&quot;. It was co-authored by Halder and former field marshals Walther von Brauchitsch and Erich von Manstein and other senior military figures. It aimed to portray the German armed forces as apolitical and largely innocent of the crimes committed by the Nazi regime. The strategy outlined in the memorandum was later adopted by Hans Laternser, the lead counsel for the defence at the High Command Trial of senior &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; commanders. The document was written at the suggestion of American General William J. Donovan, who later founded the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and viewed the Soviet Union as a global threat to world peace. Donovan served as a deputy prosecutor at the International Military Tribunal; he and some other US representatives did not believe the trials should proceed. He believed America should do everything it could to secure Germany as a military ally against the Soviet Union in the growing Cold War.

As the Cold War progressed, the military intelligence provided by the German section of the US Army Historical Division became increasingly important to the Americans. Halder oversaw the German section of the research program which became known as the &quot;Halder Group&quot;. His group produced over 2,500 major historical manuscripts from over 700 distinct German authors detailing World War II. Halder used the group to reinvent war-time history using truth, half-truth, distortion and lies. He set up a &quot;control group&quot; of trusted former Nazi officers who vetted all the manuscripts and, if necessary, required authors to change their content. Halder&#x27;s deputy in the group was Adolf Heusinger who was also working for the Gehlen Organization, the United States military intelligence organisation in Germany. Halder expected to be addressed as &quot;General&quot; by the writing teams and behaved as their commanding officer while dealing with their manuscripts. His aim was to exonerate German army personnel of the atrocities they had committed.

Halder laid down a version of history that all the writers had to abide by. This version stated that the army was the victim of Hitler, and they had opposed him at every opportunity. The writers had to emphasise the &quot;decent&quot; form of war conducted by the army and blame the SS for the criminal operations. He enjoyed a privileged position, as the few historians working on World War II history in the 1950s had to obtain historical information from Halder and his group. His influence extended to newspaper editors and authors. Halder&#x27;s instructions were sent down the chain of command and were recorded by former field marshal Georg von Küchler. They said: &quot;It is German deeds, seen from the German standpoint, that are to be recorded; this will constitute a memorial to our troops&quot;, &quot;no criticism of measures ordered by the leadership&quot; is allowed and no one is to be &quot;incriminated in any way,&quot; instead the achievements of the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; were to be emphasised. The military historian Bernd Wegner, examining Halder&#x27;s work, wrote: &quot;The writing of German history on the Second World War, and in particular on the Russian front, was for over two decades, and in part up to the present day—and to a far greater extent than most people realize—the work of the defeated.&quot; Wolfram Wette wrote, &quot;In the work of the Historical Division the traces of the war of annihilation for which the Wehrmacht leadership was responsible were covered up&quot;.

Halder sought to distance himself and the German army from Hitler, Nazism and war crimes. He claimed to have been against the Russian campaign and that he had warned Hitler against his &quot;adventure&quot; in the East. He omitted any mention of the Barbarossa Decree that he had helped formulate or the Commissar Order which he had supported and disseminated. Halder also claimed implausibly that the invasion of the Soviet Union was a defensive measure.

The Americans were aware the manuscripts contained numerous apologia. However, they also contained intelligence that the Americans viewed as important in the event of a war between the US and the Soviet Union. Halder had coached former Nazi officers on how to make incriminating evidence disappear. Many of the officers he coached such as Heinz Guderian went on to write best-selling biographies that broadened the appeal of the apologia. Halder succeeded in his aim of rehabilitating the German officer corps, first with the US military, then widening circles of politics and finally millions of Americans.

In 1949 Halder wrote &quot;Hitler als Feldherr&quot; which was translated into English as &quot;Hitler as Commander&quot; and published in 1950. The work contains the central ideas behind the myth of the clean &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; that were subsequently reproduced in countless histories and memoirs. The book describes an idealised commander who is then compared to Hitler. The commander is noble, wise, against the war in the East and free of any guilt. Hitler alone is responsible for the evil committed; his complete immorality is contrasted with the moral behaviour of the commander who has done no wrong.

Halder&#x27;s myth-making was not concentrated solely on absolving himself and the German army from war crimes; he also created two strategic and operational myths. The first is that Hitler alone was responsible for the military blunders during the invasion of the Soviet Union. The second myth is that the blitzkrieg campaign he so strongly advocated would have resulted in the capture of Moscow and won the war for Germany. The historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies writing in &quot;The Myth of the Eastern Front&quot; said &quot;Franz Halder embodies better than any other high German officer the dramatic difference between myth and reality as it emerged after World War II&quot;.

=== Retirement ===

Halder&#x27;s work with the Historical Commission drew to a close at the end of the 1950s, and he received praise from The Pentagon. Rear Admiral Walter Ansel who had worked with Halder while researching Operation Sea Lion, the planned Invasion of England, recommended he become an associate of the United States Naval Institute. In 1961 he was awarded the Meritorious Civilian Service Award for this work. This award was bestowed by Major General Edgar C. Doleman on behalf of President John F. Kennedy. Halder thus became the only German to be decorated by both Adolf Hitler and an American president. (He had received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross from Hitler in 1939.)

During the 1960s, Halder became akin to a &quot;historical icon&quot;, fielding questions from historians and general public alike. Halder died in 1972 in Aschau im Chiemgau, Bavaria.

<text>Marcus Antonius Primus (born between 20 AD and 35 AD – died after 81 AD) was a senator and general of the Roman Empire.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Primus was born at Tolosa (Toulouse) in Gaul. Possibly he was descended from Gauls who had been enfranchised by Mark Antony during his Gallic campaign. He was nicknamed &quot;Beccus&quot; (&quot;Beaky&quot;), likely due to his physique.

===Career===
During the reign of Nero, he was resident in Rome and a member of the Senate, from which he was expelled for conspiring to forge a will with Valerius Fabianus, and was banished from the city. He was subsequently reinstated by Galba, and placed in command of the Legio VII Galbiana in Pannonia.

During the civil war, Primus was one of Vespasian&#x27;s strongest supporters. Advancing into Italy, he gained a decisive victory over the Vitellians at Bedriacum in October 69, and on the same day stormed and captured Cremona. His victorious troops then sacked and burned the city. Embarrassed by the incident he forbade enslavement of captive Cremonans, and their captors then began murdering those who could not be ransomed. He then crossed the Apennines, and made his way to Rome, into which he forced an entrance after considerable opposition. Vitellius was seized and put to death. For a few days, Primus was virtually ruler of Rome, and the Senate bestowed upon him the rank and insignia of a consul, but on the arrival of Licinius Mucianus, he left Rome.

Primus must have been alive during the reign of Domitian, since four epigrams of Martial are addressed to him. Tacitus describes him as brave in action, ready of speech, clever at bringing others into odium, powerful in times of civil war and rebellion, greedy, extravagant, in peace a bad citizen, in war an ally not to be despised.

<doc id="676833" wikidata="Q29921" url="?curid=676833" title="Inuktitut">
<text>Inuktitut ( ; , ; from , &#x27;person&#x27; + , &#x27;like&#x27;, &#x27;in the manner of&#x27;), also known as Eastern Canadian Inuktitut, is one of the principal Inuit languages of Canada. It is spoken in all areas north of the North American tree line, including parts of the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, to some extent in northeastern Manitoba as well as the Northwest Territories and Nunavut. It is one of the aboriginal languages written with Canadian Aboriginal syllabics.

It is recognized as an official language in Nunavut alongside Inuinnaqtun and both languages are known collectively as &quot;Inuktut&quot;. Further, it is recognized as one of eight official native tongues in the Northwest Territories. It also has legal recognition in Nunavik—a part of Quebec—thanks in part to the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement, and is recognized in the Charter of the French Language as the official language of instruction for Inuit school districts there. It also has some recognition in NunatuKavut and Nunatsiavut—the Inuit area in Labrador—following the ratification of its agreement with the government of Canada and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. The 2016 Canadian census reports that 70,540 individuals identify themselves as Inuit, of whom 37,570 self-reported Inuktitut as their mother tongue.

The term &quot;Inuktitut&quot; is also the name of a macrolanguage and, in that context, also includes Inuvialuktun, and thus nearly all Inuit dialects of Canada. However, Statistics Canada lists all Inuit languages in the Canadian census as Inuktut.

==History==

=== Inuktitut in the Canadian school system ===
Before contact with Europeans, Inuit learned skills by example and participation. The Inuktitut language provided them with all the vocabulary required to describe traditional practices and natural features. Up to this point, it was solely an oral language. However, European colonialism brought the schooling system to Canada. The missionaries of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches were the first ones to deliver formal education to Inuit in schools. The teachers used the Inuktitut language for instruction and developed writing systems.

In 1928 the first residential school for Inuit opened, and English became the language of instruction. As the government&#x27;s interests in the north increased, it started taking over the education of Inuit. After the end of World War II, English was seen as the language of communication in all domains. Officials expressed concerns about the difficulty for Inuit to find employment if they were not able to communicate in English. Inuit were supposed to use English at school, work, and even on the playground. Inuit themselves viewed Inuktitut as the way to express their feelings and be linked to their identity, while English was a tool for making money.

In the 1960s, the European attitude towards the Inuktitut language started to change. Inuktitut was seen as a language worth preserving, and it was argued that knowledge, particularly in the first years of school, is best transmitted in the mother tongue. This set off the beginning of bilingual schools. In 1969, most Inuit voted to eliminate federal schools and replace them with programs by the (). Content was now taught in Inuktitut, English, and French.

=== Legislation ===
Inuktitut became one of the official languages in the Northwest Territories in 1984. Its status is secured in the &quot;Northwest Territories Official Language Act&quot;. With the split of the territory into the NWT and Nunavut in 1999, both territories kept the Language Act. The autonomous area Nunatsiavut in Labrador made Inuktitut the government language when it was formed in 2005. In Nunavik, the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement recognizes Inuktitut in the education system.

==Languages and dialects==
===Nunavut===
Nunavut&#x27;s basic law lists four official languages: English, French, Inuktitut, and Inuinnaqtun. It is ambiguous in state policy to what degree Inuktitut and Inuinnaqtun can be thought of as separate languages. The words &quot;Inuktitut&quot;, or more correctly &quot;Inuktut&quot; (&#x27;Inuit language&#x27;) are increasingly used to refer to both Inuinnaqtun and Inuktitut together, or &quot;Inuit languages&quot; in English.

Nunavut is the home of some 24,000 Inuit, over 80% of whom speak Inuktitut. This includes some 3,500 people reported as monolinguals. The 2001 census data shows that the use of Inuktitut, while lower among the young than the elderly, has stopped declining in Canada as a whole and may even be increasing in Nunavut.

The South Baffin dialect (, ) is spoken across the southern part of Baffin Island, including the territorial capital Iqaluit. This has in recent years made it a much more widely heard dialect, since a great deal of Inuktitut media originates in Iqaluit. Some linguists also distinguish an &quot;East Baffin&quot; dialect from either South Baffin or North Baffin dialect, which is an Inuvialuktun dialect.

As of the early 2000s, Nunavut has gradually implemented early childhood, elementary, and secondary school-level immersion programs within its education system to further preserve and promote the Inuktitut language. , &quot;Pirurvik, Iqaluit&#x27;s Inuktitut language training centre, has a new goal: to train instructors from Nunavut communities to teach Inuktitut in different ways and in their own dialects when they return home.&quot;

===Nunavik===
Quebec is home to roughly 15,800 Inuit, nearly all of whom live in Nunavik. According to the 2021 census, 80.9% of Quebec Inuit speak Inuktitut.

The Nunavik dialect (, ) is relatively close to the South Baffin dialect, but not identical. Because of the political and physical boundary between Nunavik and Nunavut, Nunavik has separate government and educational institutions from those in the rest of the Inuktitut-speaking world, resulting in a growing standardization of the local dialect as something separate from other forms of Inuktitut. In the Nunavik dialect, Inuktitut is called (). This dialect is also sometimes called or ( or ).

Sub dialects of Inuktitut in this region include Tarrarmiut and Itivimuit. Itivimuit is associated with Inukjuak, Quebec, and there is an Itivimuit River near the town.

===Labrador===
The Nunatsiavut dialect ( or, often in government documents, ) was once spoken across northern Labrador. It has a distinct writing system, developed in Greenland in the 1760s by German missionaries from the Moravian Church. This separate writing tradition, the remoteness of Nunatsiavut from other Inuit communities, has made it into a distinct dialect with a separate literary tradition. The Nunatsiavummiut call their language ().

Although Nunatsiavut claims over 4,000 inhabitants of Inuit descent, only 550 reported Inuktitut to be their native language in the 2001 census, mostly in the town of Nain. Inuktitut is seriously endangered in Labrador.

Nunatsiavut also had a separate dialect reputedly much closer to western Inuktitut dialects, spoken in the area around Rigolet. According to news reports, in 1999 it had only three very elderly speakers.

===Greenland===
Though often thought to be a dialect of Greenlandic, Inuktun or Polar Eskimo is a recent arrival in Greenland from the Eastern Canadian Arctic, arriving perhaps as late as the 18th century.

===Inuit Nunaat and Inuit Nunangat===
Throughout Inuit Nunaat and Inuit Nunangat the Inuktut is used to refer to Inuktitut and all other dialects.

It is used by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the Inuit Circumpolar Council, and the Government of Nunavut throughout Inuit Nunaat and Inuit Nunangat.

==Phonology==

Eastern dialects of Inuktitut have fifteen consonants and three vowels (which can be long or short). Consonants are arranged with six places of articulation: bilabial, labiodental, alveolar, palatal, velar and uvular; and three manners of articulation: voiceless stops, voiced continuants and nasals, as well as two additional sounds—voiceless fricatives. Natsilingmiutut has an additional consonant , a vestige of the retroflex consonants of Proto-Inuit. Inuinnaqtun has one fewer consonant, as and have merged into . All dialects of Inuktitut have only three basic vowels and make a phonological distinction between short and long forms of all vowels. In —Nunavut standard Roman orthography—long vowels are written as a double vowel.


All voiceless stops are unaspirated, like in many other languages. The voiceless uvular stop is usually written as q, but sometimes written as r. The voiceless lateral fricative is romanized as ɬ, but is often written as &amp;, or simply as l.

/ŋ/ is spelt as ng, and geminated /ŋ/ is spelt as nng.

==Grammar==
Inuktitut, like other Eskaleut languages, has a very rich morphological system, in which a succession of different morphemes are added to root words to indicate things that, in languages like English, would require several words to express. (See also: Agglutinative language and Polysynthetic language.) All words begin with a root morpheme to which other morphemes are suffixed. Inuktitut has hundreds of distinct suffixes, in some dialects as many as 700. However, it is highly regular, with rules that do not have exceptions like in English and other Indo-European languages, though they are sometimes very complicated.

One example is the word () meaning &#x27;I&#x27;ll have to go to the airport:

==Writing==

=== Latin alphabets ===
The western part of Nunavut and the Northwest Territories use a Latin alphabet usually called or , reflecting the predispositions of the missionaries who reached this area in the late 19th century and early 20th.

Moravian missionaries, with the purpose of introducing Inuit to Christianity and the Bible, contributed to the development of an Inuktitut alphabet in Greenland during the 1760s that was based on the Latin script. (This alphabet is distinguished by its inclusion of the letter kra, ĸ.) They later travelled to Labrador in the 1800s, bringing the Inuktitut alphabet with them.

The Alaskan Yupik and Inupiat (who additionally developed their own syllabary) and the Siberian Yupik also adopted Latin alphabets.

=== &quot;Qaniujaaqpait&quot; ===
Most Inuktitut in Nunavut and Nunavik is written using a scheme called or Inuktitut syllabics, based on Canadian Aboriginal syllabics.

In the 1860s, missionaries imported this system of &quot;Qaniujaaqpait&quot;, which they had developed in their efforts to convert the Cree to Christianity, to the Eastern Canadian Inuit. The Netsilik Inuit in Kugaaruk and north Baffin Island adopted by the 1920s.

In September 2019, a unified orthography called Inuktut Qaliujaaqpait, based on the Latin alphabet without diacritics, was adopted for all varieties of Inuktitut by the national organization Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, after eight years of work. It was developed by Inuit to be used by speakers of any dialect from any region, and can be typed on electronic devices without specialized keyboard layouts. It does not replace syllabics, and people from the regions are not required to stop using their familiar writing systems. Implementation plans are to be established for each region. It includes letters such as &quot;ff&quot;, &quot;ch&quot;, and &quot;rh&quot;, the sounds for which exist in some dialects but do not have standard equivalents in syllabics. It establishes a standard alphabet but not spelling or grammar rules. Long vowels are written by doubling the vowel (e.g., &quot;aa&quot;, &quot;ii&quot;, &quot;uu&quot;). The apostrophe represents a glottal stop when after a vowel (e.g., ), or separates an &quot;n&quot; from an &quot;ng&quot; (e.g., ) or an &quot;r&quot; from an &quot;rh&quot; (e.g., ).

In April 2012, with the completion of the Old Testament, the first complete Bible in Inuktitut, translated by native speakers, was published.

Noted literature in Inuktitut has included the novels &quot;Harpoon of the Hunter&quot; by Markoosie Patsauq, and by Mitiarjuk Nappaaluk.

===The Canadian syllabary===
The Inuktitut syllabary used in Canada is based on the Cree syllabary devised by the missionary James Evans. The present form of the syllabary for Canadian Inuktitut was adopted by the Inuit Cultural Institute in Canada in the 1970s. Inuit in Alaska, Inuvialuit, Inuinnaqtun speakers, and Inuit in Greenland and Labrador use Latin alphabets.

Though conventionally called a syllabary, the writing system has been classified by some observers as an abugida, since syllables starting with the same consonant have related glyphs rather than unrelated ones.

All of the characters needed for the Inuktitut syllabary are available in the Unicode block Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics. The territorial government of Nunavut, Canada, has developed TrueType fonts called (ᐱᒋᐊᕐᓂᖅ ), (ᐅᖃᒻᒪᖅ ), and (ᐅᕓᒥᐊ ) for computer displays. They were designed by Vancouver-based Tiro Typeworks. Apple Macintosh computers include an Inuktitut IME (Input Method Editor) as part of keyboard language options. Linux distributions provide locale and language support for Iñupiaq, Kalaallisut and Inuktitut.

===Braille===

In 2012 Tamara Kearney, Manager of Braille Research and Development at the Commonwealth Braille and Talking Book Cooperative, developed a Braille code for the Inuktitut language syllabics. This code is based on representing the syllabics&#x27; orientation. Machine translation from Unicode UTF-8 and UTF-16 can be performed using the Liblouis Braille translation system which includes an Inuktitut Braille translation table. The book (&quot;The Orphan and the Polar Bear&quot;) became the first work ever translated into Inuktitut Braille, and a copy is held at the headquarters of the Nunavut Public Library Services at Baker Lake.

<text>Trashigang District (Dzongkha: བཀྲ་ཤིས་སྒང་རྫོང་ཁག་; Wylie: &quot;Bkra-shis-sgang rdzong-khag&quot;; also spelled &quot;Tashigang&quot;) is Bhutan&#x27;s easternmost dzongkhag (district).

==Culture==
The population of the district is mainly Sharchop, which means &quot;easterner&quot; in Dzongkha, the national language.

==Languages==
The dominant language of Trashigang is Tshangla (Sharchopkha), the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of eastern Bhutan. Two significant minority languages are spoken in the far eastern region of the district: the East Bodish Dakpa language and the Southern Bodish Brokpa language. Dakpa is spoken by descendants of yakherding communities, and may in fact be a divergent dialect of Brokpake, heavily influenced by Dzalakha.

==Economy and education==
While it has no major urban area, Trashigang has the densest population in Bhutan. It used to be part of an important trade route connecting Assam to Tibet, and still is a primary route for Bhutanese trade with India. Towns include Trashigang (the district capital), Radi, Rangjung, and Phongmey. The district produces rice and lavender.

There are several tourist packages to Bhutan that include trips from Thimphu to Trashigang, despite the 17-hour journey from the capital over the rough and dangerous Lateral Road.

Trashigang is also the site of Sherubtse College, the original college within the Royal University of Bhutan system.

==Landmarks==

Trashigang Dzong, or fortress, was built in 1659 by the third Druk Desi Chögyal Mingyur Tenpa to defend against Tibetan invaders. Because of its altitude, invading armies remarked that &quot;it is not a dzong on the ground, it is in the sky&quot;.

An ancient &quot;lhakhang&quot; or temple in the district, known for its rock garden, contains a sacred footprint said to be either that of Guru Rimpoche or that of a &quot;khandroma&quot; (angel).

Rangjung, 16 km east of the district capital, is the site of Rangjung Ösel Chöling Monastery, established by Dungse Garab Dorje Rinpoche in 1989. The temple contains particularly fine images of Padmasambhava, Shantarakshita and Chögyal Trisong Detsen (Khen-Lop-Chö sum).

Bartsham Chador Lhakhang is a sacred Lhakhang in Bartsham Gewog that houses the thumb-size replica of the &quot;Chador&quot; Statue discovered from &quot;Yuetsho&quot; Lake in Dungsam Pemagatshel.

==Administrative divisions==
Trashigang Districts is divided into fifteen village blocks (or &quot;gewogs&quot;):

*Bartsham Gewog
*Bidung Gewog
*Kanglung Gewog
*Kangpara Gewog
*Khaling Gewog
*Lumang Gewog
*Merak Gewog
*Phongmey Gewog
*Radhi Gewog
*Sakten Gewog
*Samkhar Gewog
*Shongphu Gewog
*Thrimshing Gewog
*Uzorong Gewog
*Yangneer Gewog
==Protected area==
The Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary, one of ten protected areas of Bhutan, was created in part to protect the &quot;migoi&quot;, a type of yeti in whose existence most Bhutanese believe. The sanctuary covers the eastern third of the district (the &quot;gewogs&quot; of Merag and Sakteng), and is connected via biological corridor to Khaling Wildlife Sanctuary in Samdrup Jongkhar District to the south.

<doc id="676852" wikidata="Q1207769" url="?curid=676852" title="Dhruva">
<text>Dhruva (Sanskrit: ध्रुव, , lit. &quot;unshakeable, immovable, fixed or eternal&quot;) was an ascetic devotee of Vishnu mentioned in the Vishnu Purana and the Bhagavata Purana.

The Sanskrit term &quot;dhruva nakshatra&quot; (ध्रुव नक्षत्र, &quot;polar star&quot;) has been used for Pole Star in the Mahabharata, personified as son of Uttānapāda and grandson of Manu, even though Polaris at the likely period of the recension of the text of the Mahabharata was still several degrees away from the celestial pole.

==Narrative==
=== Devotion towards Vishnu ===
Dhruva was born as son of the King Uttānapāda (the son of Svayambhuva Manu) and his wife Suniti. The king also had another son Uttama, born to his second queen Suruchi, who was the preferred object of his affection. Once, when Dhruva was five years old, he saw his younger brother, Uttama sitting on his father&#x27;s lap at the King&#x27;s throne. Suruchi, who was jealous of Dhruva (since he would be heir to the throne, and not Suruchi&#x27;s son), cruelly scolded young Dhruva for his efforts to sit on his father&#x27;s lap. When Dhruva protested and asked if he could be allowed to sit on his father&#x27;s lap, Suruchi berated him saying, &#x27;Go ask god to be born in my womb. Only then will you have the privilege&#x27;. Suniti - being of gentle nature and now the lesser favorite wife - tried to console the distraught child, but Dhruva was determined to hear of his fate from the Lord himself and set out to perform austerities in the forest. Noticing his resolve, the divine sage Narada appeared before him and tried to desist him from assuming a severe austerity upon himself at such an early age. But, Dhruva was determined and the sage guided him by teaching him the rituals and mantras to meditate on when seeking lord Vishnu. The one mantra which Narada taught and which was effectively used by Dhruva was Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya. Having been advised, Dhruva started his meditation, and went without food and water for six months. Vishnu was pleased and appeared before Dhruva. Dhruva sang a poem praising Vishnu in 12 powerful verses, also known as &quot;Dhruva-stuti&quot;.

Vishnu Purana gives a slightly different account here. When Vishnu was pleased with Dhruva&#x27;s &quot;tapasya&quot; (penance) and asked him for a &quot;varadāna&quot; (grant of wishes), he asked for the varadāna of knowledge of a &quot;stuti&quot; (hymn). Other persons would have asked for worldly or heavenly pleasures, or for moksha at most, but Dhruva had no personal desire. Renunciation of all desires is regarded to be essential for eternal peace in Hinduism: this is the meaning of &quot;Dhruva-pada&quot;. That was the reason why the Saptarshis decided to give Dhruva the most revered seat of a star - the Pole Star.

Having spent a long time in Vishnu&#x27;s remembrance he even forgot the objective of his tapasya, and only asked for a life in memory of Vishnu. Pleased by his tapasya, Vishnu granted his wish and further decreed that he would attain &quot;Dhruva-pada&quot;: the state where he would become a celestial body which would not even be touched by the Maha Pralaya.

Dhruva returned to his kingdom, to be warmly received by his family, and attained the crown at the age of six. He ruled for many decades in a fair and just manner.

=== The Yaksha War ===
According to the Srimad Bhagavata, once, Dhruva&#x27;s step-brother Uttama went to the foothills of the Himalayas to hunt. However, he was killed by a Yaksha. Uttama&#x27;s mother Suruchi went looking for him, but she too was killed.

This news reached Dhruva. He was enraged and so, he declared a war against the Yakshas. He travelled to the Yaksha kingdom of Alakapuri fought valiantly, and vanquished his opponents. After defeating the Yaksha soldiers, he began killing even innocent Yakshas. Alarmed by this, Dhruva&#x27;s grandfather, Svayambhuva Manu appeared before him and bade him to stop. He calmed Dhruva&#x27;s anger down.

After realising his mistake, Dhruva apologised to the Yaksha king, Vaishravana. Vaishravana asked Dhruva for a boon, and Dhruva asked for being able to preserve his devotion towards Vishnu.

<doc id="676859" wikidata="Q7836548" url="?curid=676859" title="Treacle mining">
<text>Treacle mining is the fictitious mining of black treacle (also known as molasses) in a raw form similar to coal. The subject purports to be serious but is an attempt to test credulity. Thick black treacle makes the deception plausible. The topic has been a joke in British humour since the mid-19th century.

==Origins==

One possible origin of the joke is from 1853 when 8,000 British Army soldiers were camped on Chobham Common. The camp included storehouses containing barrels. When the soldiers left for the Crimean War and the site was dismantled, they buried barrels to avoid having to remove them. Some of the barrels contained treacle and Chobham villagers who discovered and removed them were called &quot;treacle miners&quot; as a joke. Local folklore about treacle mining was extended into history back to Roman Britain.

Another explanation is that the word &quot;treacle&quot; meant &quot;a medicine&quot;, derived from the appearance of the Greek derivative &quot;theriacal&quot; meaning medicinal (Greek &quot;theriake&quot; &quot;curative&quot;, &quot;antidote&quot;), leading to the various healing wells around Britain being called &quot;treacle wells&quot;. Treacle later came to mean a sticky syrup after the popularity of a honey-based drug called &quot;Venice treacle&quot;, and the continued use of the old form in the treacle wells led to the joke.

In Devon, on the eastern edge of Dartmoor, the remains of mines that produced micaceous hematite, used as pounce to dust early ink to prevent smearing, are known locally as &quot;treacle mines&quot; since they show a glistening black residue that looks like treacle.

==Locations==
The village of Sabden in Lancashire cultivated a considerable body of folklore about local treacle mining in the 1930s. The local newspaper helped foster the myth, publishing numerous stories about the fictitious mines.

The paper mills around Maidstone in Kent were known as &quot;The Tovil Treacle Mines&quot; by locals, after the area where one of the mills owned by Albert E. Reed was situated. The company helped the myth with a float in Maidstone carnival with a &quot;treacle mine&quot; theme.

One suggested source of the story in this area is a rumour that the paper industry was threatened during the Second World War because there was no imported timber. Fermentation of straw was tried, creating a sticky goo. There were attempts to make paper from other than rags in the 19th century and an early commercial success was achieved by Samuel Hook and his son, Charles Townsend Hook, using straw at Upper Tovil Mill in the 1850s. The road next to Upper Tovil Mill became known, and was later named, as Straw Mill Hill. To produce pulp, the straw was cooked in hot alkali. After separation of the fibre, the remaining liquid looked like black treacle. Upper Tovil Mill closed in the 1980s and the site was used for a housing estate.

Tudeley and Frittenden in Kent are also said to have had treacle mines. A tank wagon on the Kent and East Sussex Railway was painted in sham &quot;Frittenden Treacle Mines&quot; livery in 2009.

Suggestions of a treacle mine in Buxted were published by the &quot;Friends of Horwich&quot;.

Tadley treacle mines had a local hotel named after them and a Tadley Treacle Fair is held. Legend says the name derives from using treacle tins to store money because banks could not be trusted. The tins were buried around the village. Criminals mined for tins.

Hemel Hempstead in Hertfordshire has a legend of having a treacle mine and a local nickname since around World War I was &quot;Treacle Bumstead&quot;. Wareside, also in Hertfordshire, has long had its own &quot;treacle mines&quot;. When asked &quot;where have you been?&quot;, it was often a popular answer in and around Ware, to say &quot;down the treacle mines!&quot;

Treacle mines have also been claimed in the twin villages Trimley St. Martin and Trimley St. Mary (Suffolk), Wem (Shropshire), Talskiddy, Bisham, Nuneaton, Sway (Hampshire), Ginge (Oxfordshire), Chobham (Surrey), Tongham, Tadley, Skidby, Ditchford, Crick (Northamptonshire), Debdale (Leicestershire), Dunchideock and many other locations across Somerset and Devon, in several northern towns including Natland and Baggrow in Cumbria and Pudsey in Yorkshire, in Croftamie, Scotland, and in the fictional village of Wymsey.

==Actual places==

Several public houses, restaurants and hotels have borne the name. The Treacle Mine public house in Grays, Thurrock, Essex (pictured above) is an example, and the adjacent Treacle Mine Roundabout, which features on the local bus timetable, is named after the public house.

There is a restaurant/pub named Treacle Mine in Polegate, East Sussex. The name refers to the Polegate treacle mines, a long-running tale in the area that is very popular, with locals dressing as treacle miners for the 1978 Eastbourne carnival. The origins are believed to be associated with a nearby sweet factory.

The Broomsquire Hotel in Tadley, Hampshire, was previously the Treacle Mine Hotel; and another Treacle Mine pub is in Hereford.

Since April 2009 the town of Wincanton in Somerset, twinned with Ankh-Morpork, has had a Treacle Mine Road.

== Cultural references ==
The Treacle Mine has been a joke played on children and the gullible since at least the nineteenth century.
*Ottershaw School in Surrey (a state boarding school founded in 1948 and closed in 1980) encouraged all new boys, on their first Sunday, to wait outside the Main gate for the coach that would take them on an outing to the Chobham Treacle Mines.
*In &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (1865) by Lewis Carroll, Alice is shushed at the Mad Hatter&#x27;s tea party for disbelieving a story told by the Dormouse about a treacle well, inspired by the holy well at Binsey, Oxfordshire.
*In &quot;Uncle and the Treacle Trouble&quot; (1967), a children&#x27;s book by J. P. Martin, the main character (an elephant named &quot;Uncle&quot;) discovers the true meaning of a cryptic sign which reads &quot;Treac Levat&quot;; the characters soon discover that it relates to a vast hidden treacle vat.
*Treacle mining features in several novels by Terry Pratchett. On the fictional Discworld treacle is mined from buried deposits of compressed ancient sugarcane. In the city of Ankh-Morpork there is a street named Treacle Mine Road, with the current watch house (analogous to a police station) found in the building formerly housing the entrance to a treacle mine. The books also make references to &quot;deep treacle&quot; deposits beneath the city. As with many features of the Discworld, treacle mines exist &quot;because&quot; people believe in them, according to the Discworld&#x27;s Theory of Narrative Causality.
*&quot;The Treacle People&quot; was a children&#x27;s TV show from 1996 based around the treacle mines of Sabden in Lancashire.
*All the members of the Seven Champions Molly Dancers from Kent are reputed to be treacle miners.
*Some of Ken Dodd&#x27;s Diddy Men were said to work in a jam butty mine. This appears to be a similar concept.

<text>Nathaniel Folsom (September 28, 1726 – May 26, 1790) was an American merchant and statesman. He was a delegate for New Hampshire in the Continental Congress in 1774 and 1777 to 1780, signing the Continental Association. He served as major general of the New Hampshire Militia during the American Revolutionary War.

==Private life==
Folsom was born into a large family in Exeter, New Hampshire. His ancestors were among Exeter&#x27;s earliest settlers, having arrived with the Gilman family, to whom they were related, from Hingham, Massachusetts, where both families settled for a time before moving on to New Hampshire. The original spelling of the family name was Foulsham. The Folsoms continued to hold land outside Hingham, Norfolk, England, many years after leaving for the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1673, John Folsom of Exeter gave his son Peter of land in Norfolk County, England, which he had inherited from his family. 

Nathaniel Folsom&#x27;s father Jonathan (c. 1685–1740) married Ann Ladd (1691–1742), and she gave birth to Anna, Sarah, Lydia, Elizabeth, Abigail, John, Mary, Nathaniel, Jonathan, Samuel, Josiah and Trueworthy (named for Folsom&#x27;s Treworgy ancestors). When Folsom&#x27;s father died in January 1740, the thirteen-year-old Nathaniel went to work for a merchant. He invested in timber and opened a sawmill. Then in 1761, he went into business with some distant cousins, Joseph and Josiah Gilman. They became &quot;Folsom, Gilman &amp; Gilman&quot; and opened a general store, built ships, and carried on an import/export business. The firm operated in Exeter and Portsmouth. Though the partners separated in 1768, Folsom continued in foreign commerce, timber, and lumber operations for the rest of his life.

Folsom married twice, first to Dorothy Smith (1726–1776). Their children included: Nathaniel, Dorothy, Jonathan, Anna, Arthur, Mary, and Deborah. Deborah was New Hampshire Governor John Taylor Gilman&#x27;s first wife, and Mary was his second). Folsom married again to Mary Fisher, and they had one daughter, Ruth Weare.

==Military career==
Folsom joined the militia as did most young men. During the French and Indian War he was captain of a company in the New Hampshire Provincial Regiment during the Crown Point expedition led by Sir William Johnson in 1755. At the Battle of Lake George, his company, supported by artillery from Massachusetts, surprised and captured Baron Dieskau, the French commander-in-chief. Besides capturing the Baron, they dispersed the French troops, took the French baggage train and seized a critical mass of supplies, with the loss of only six men.

Folsom went on to become a colonel of the Fourth Regiment of New Hampshire Militia. His formal commission was revoked by Governor John Wentworth after the raid on Fort William and Mary in December 1774. Disregarding this, Colonel Folsom marched his regiment to Portsmouth and escorted the captured cannons safely back to Durham.

Near the beginning of the Revolutionary War, the Provincial Congress named him brigadier general in command of New Hampshire&#x27;s forces. This created some confusion, as the Massachusetts provisional government had named John Stark to the same position. At the time, Colonel Stark was the senior commander of the New Hampshire men who had marched to the Siege of Boston. The confusion was resolved in June 1775, when the Continental Congress named John Sullivan general of those New Hampshire forces in service with the Continental Army. Folsom was the senior officer for militia forces within the state. He was later named a major general, and continued recruiting, training, and supply efforts throughout the war.

==Political career==
Folsom had served several years as moderator of the town meetings at Exeter. When the revolutionary Provincial Congress first met on July 21, 1774, he was a delegate. The Provincial Congress named him their delegate to the First Continental Congress that met in Philadelphia, during which he was a signatory to the Continental Association.

Folsom was a member when everything relating to the success of the Revolution wore a dubious aspect. At this period too, when there were so many scattered and dispersed throughout the country who sympathized with the mother country and who were denominated Tories, it became necessary to adopt some method, or to institute some measure, by which it could be known who were friends and who were enemies of the cause of Independence. Accordingly, the Continental Congress made a provision whereby all persons friendly to the cause of liberty and independence were required to associate and sign an obligation to oppose, by arms and money, the hostilities of the British. This obligation was denominated the Association Test. All who refused to sign it were disarmed and watched with jealous care, and every hostile demonstration noted and reported to the Committee of Safety, which was composed of a body of men appointed by the General Assembly. Their order and recommendations had all the force and effect and was considered equally binding as the acts and resolves of the General Assembly.

In 1775, Folsom continued his service in the provincial congress, as he would do until 1783. He became a close political ally of Meshech Weare and Josiah Bartlett, as he was named to the New Hampshire Committee of Safety. In January 1776, he also became a justice in the Rockingham County court of common pleas. In 1777 and 1779 he was returned as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress.

In 1783, he became the chief judge in the common pleas court. That same year he went to, and presided over, the state&#x27;s constitutional convention. When a constitution was adopted, as president of the convention, he wrote a cover letter, then forwarded it to the towns for ratification. Ironically, one problem addressed by the constitution was to limit the number of offices held by one man. Folsom thus resigned from the Assembly, as head of the militia, and from the Governor&#x27;s Council. He held the position of chief judge in Rockingham County until his death in Exeter on May 26, 1790. He is buried in Exeter&#x27;s Winter Street Cemetery.

In the Gallo-Roman era, a minor road connecting Delle with Froidefontaine crossed Boron and Vellescot. A section of a hundred meters length was excavated around 1851. The first mention of the name of &quot;Vellecort&quot; is in the charter of equipment of the priory of Froidefontaine on 8 March 1105. The village then formed part of the town hall and the parish of Grosne and returned in 1125 to Frederic, count of Ferrette. In the Austrian period, which lasted from the middle of the fourteenth to the middle of the sixteenth century, the name of the village was Germanized to &quot;Hanendorf&quot;.
Before the Second World War a metric gauge railroad of local interest ran between Belfort and Réchésy, which crossed Grosne, Vellescot and Suarce.

<text>Robert Alexis Machado (born June 3, 1973) is a former Venezuelan catcher in Major League Baseball who played from 1998 through 2004 for the Chicago White Sox, Montreal Expos, Seattle Mariners, Chicago Cubs, Milwaukee Brewers and Baltimore Orioles. Listed at 6&#x27; 1&quot;, 205 lb., Machado batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Puerto Cabello, Carabobo.

Machado was a solid defensive catcher with a strong arm, but his little offensive value limited his effectiveness as an everyday player. His most productive season came in 2001 with the Cubs, when he posted a .997 of fielding percentage and threw out 13 of 39 baserunners who attempted to steal off him. He also had eight multi-hit games, including three over a six-game span, when he went 9-for-23 with three doubles and a home run.

On June 9, 2002, the Cubs traded Machado to the Brewers for previously heralded prospect Jackson Melián.

Machado also played in all or part of 13 Minor League seasons spanning 1991–2004, posting a .273 average with 70 homers and 392 RBI in 862 games.

In February 2009, Machado received a 15-game suspension for violating MLB-Minor League drug treatment and prevention program while trying to return to organized baseball.

<doc id="676875" wikidata="Q6936275" url="?curid=676875" title="Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board">
<text>The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) is a United States self-regulatory financial organization that writes investor protection rules and other rules regulating broker-dealers and banks in the municipal securities market. This including tax-exempt and taxable municipal bonds, municipal notes, and other securities issued by states, cities, and counties or their agencies to help finance public projects or for other public policy purposes.

== History ==
The MSRB was created by the Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended by the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, , and codified at ) to create a mechanism for the regulation of municipal securities as well as brokers, dealers, and banks in the municipal securities business.

The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 broadened the MSRB&#x27;s rulemaking authority to also regulate so-called municipal advisors, which include financial advisors, swap advisors, brokers of guaranteed investment contracts and other market participants that advise on the issuance of municipal securities and provide certain other types of advice to state and local governments, public pension funds and other municipal entities on municipal derivatives, investment strategies and other financial matters. , since the SEC has not released the definition of &quot;municipal advisor&quot;, the MSRB&#x27;s rules in this regard are suspended and there is considerable concern in the industry as to whether underwriters and/or other regulated professionals may be viewed as municipal advisors, thereby having the related fiduciary duties. The MSRB&#x27;s investor protection rules will be extended to protect municipal entities as well.

== Mandate ==
Like the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the MSRB is a self-regulatory organization that is subject to oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The MSRB is authorized to create rules designed &quot;to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, and processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in municipal securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market in municipal securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest.&quot; While the MSRB sets standards for broker-dealers, banks, and municipal advisors, MSRB rules do not apply to issuers of municipal securities or other municipal entities, which Congress generally exempted from most provisions of the federal securities laws (such as the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Company Act of 1940) otherwise applicable to private-sector issuers of corporate and other types of securities. MSRB rules are enforced by various other federal regulatory organizations, including the SEC, FINRA, the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).

Among its investor protection rules, the MSRB is best known for adopting the first nationwide Pay to Play rule, known as Rule G-37, designed to eliminate the use of political contributions to obtain municipal underwriting business from state and local governments. The MSRB&#x27;s investor protection rules also apply to state-operated 529 plans marketed by broker-dealers, as well as to the underwriting, sales and trading of Build America Bonds and other taxable municipal obligations. In addition, the MSRB operates the Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA) system, which provides free on-line access to comprehensive municipal securities disclosure documents, trade prices, interest rate information, and market statistics.

== Structure ==
The MSRB is composed of members from regulated broker-dealers and banks as well as from the public. Beginning on October 1, 2010, the MSRB will be recomposed to consist of a majority of independent public members and to include representatives of municipal advisors.

<doc id="676876" wikidata="Q783186" url="?curid=676876" title="Lugger">
<text>A lugger is a sailing vessel defined by its rig, using the lug sail on all of its one or more masts. Luggers were widely used as working craft, particularly off the coasts of France, England, Ireland and Scotland. Luggers varied extensively in size and design. Many were undecked, open boats, some of which operated from beach landings (such as Hastings or Deal). Others were fully decked craft (typified by the Zulu and many other sailing drifters). Some larger examples might carry lug topsails.

==History==
A lugger is usually a two- or three-masted vessel, setting lug sails on each mast. A jib or staysail may be set on some luggers. More rarely, lug topsails are used by some luggers — notably the chasse-marée. A lug sail is an asymmetric quadrilateral sail that fastens to a yard (spar) along the head (top edge) of the sail. The yard is held to the mast either by a parrel or by a traveller (consisting of a metal ring that goes round the mast and has an eye for the halyard and a hook which fastens to a strop on the yard). A dipping lug sail is fastened at the tack (front lower corner) some distance in front of the mast, often at the . A standing lug&#x27;s tack is fastened near the foot of the mast. The halyard for a dipping lug is usually made fast to the weather gunwale, thereby allowing the mast to be otherwise unstayed. A common arrangement is to have a dipping lug foresail and a standing lug mizzen. This arrangement is found on many traditional British fishing vessels, such as the fifie, but there are examples of dipping lugs on two masts or standing lugs on two or three masts (as in the chasse-marée).

== Rig ==
A standing lug may be used with or without a boom; most working craft were boomless to allow more working space. The dipping lug never uses a boom. A dipping lug has to be moved to the leeward side of the mast when going about, so that the sail can take a good aerodynamic shape on the new tack. There are several methods of doing this, one of which is to simply lower the sail, manhandle the yard and sail to the other side of the mast and re-hoist. All the various methods are time and labour consuming. A standing lug can be left unaltered when tacking as it still sets reasonably well with the sail pressed against the mast. Some users (such as in the Royal Navy Montagu whaler) would still dip the yard of a standing lug (with a sharp, well timed downward pull on the leech at the moment when the wind is not filling the sail). Conversely many fishermen would always hoist a standing lug on the same side of the mast regardless of which tack they expected to be sailing on.

== Performance ==
Sailing performance with a standing lug relies on the right amount of luff tension. An essential component of this rig is the tack tackle, a purchase with which luff tension is adjusted for various points of sail.

The balanced (or balance) lug has a boom that projects in front of the mast roughly the same distance as the yard. This is generally used in dinghies. The sail is left on the same side of the mast regardless of the wind direction. A downhaul is set up from the boom to a point close to the heel of the mast and its adjustment is critical to getting this sort of sail to set correctly.
Luggers were used extensively for smuggling from the middle of the 18th century onwards; their fast hulls and powerful rigs regularly allowed them to outpace any Revenue vessel in service. The French three-masted luggers also served as privateers and in general trade. As smuggling declined from about 1840, the mainmast of British three-masted luggers tended to be discarded, with larger sails being set on the fore and mizzen. This gave more clear space in which to work fishing nets.

==Local types==

;British Isles
* Coble, used on the English east coast from Yorkshire to Northumberland
*Five Man boats, large 55–65 foot boats used for line fishing on the Yorkshire coast
* Cornish lugger
* Deal lugger, the two larger types of boat used by Deal boatmen to service ships anchored in the Downs. These were beach-launched open boats, originally three masted, but the main-mast was later dispensed with to allow more room, ultimately giving jib, dipping lug foresail and a standing lug mizzen sheeted to an outrigger. A first-class lugger or &quot;fore-peaker&quot; was typically 38 feet long, 12 ft 3 inches at greatest beam, carried 6 tons of ballast in a clinker-built hull weighing 3.5 tons. They could carry a replacement anchor and cable out to a large ship – a load of at least six tons.
* Fifie, a herring drifter of the Scottish east coast
* Hastings lugger
* Manx nickey
* Manx nobby
* Sgoth Niseach, dipping lug

;Continental Europe
* &quot;Barca-longa&quot;, of the Iberian and Mediterranean coasts
* Breton &quot;chasse-marée&quot;. These were fast-sailing cargo vessels that took fresh fish to market, sometimes taking general cargo for the return trip. They set standing lugs on three masts and a jib. Topsails were often used and topgallants when racing.
* French lugger (&quot;lougre&quot;), of the coast of Normandy

;United States of America
* &quot;New Orleans Lugger&quot; (also known as an &quot;Oyster Lugger&quot;). These shallow draft vessels were typically 37 ft overall with a 12 ft beam, although they could vary substantially in size. They set a dipping lug on a single mast and had a centre board to help go to windward in deeper waters. They were used principally for fishing, with some cargoes occasionally carried. They could be found from Texas to the West coast of Florida.

;Australia
* Some of the early pearling luggers used off the northern coast line of Australia from about the 1870s, often ship&#x27;s boats, carried a lug sail, but the purpose-built boats that were used from the 1880s stopped using it over time. The majority of these were gaff-riged ketches, although they continued to be called pearling luggers until the present day.

<text>Sin-Muballit was the father of Hammurabi and the fifth Amorite king of the first dynasty (the &quot;Amorite Dynasty&quot;) of Babylonia, reigning c. 1813-1792 or 1748-1729 BC (see Chronology of the Ancient Near East). He ruled over a relatively new and minor kingdom; however, he was the first ruler of Babylon to actually declare himself king of the city, and the first to expand the territory ruled by the city, and his son greatly expanded the Babylonian kingdom into the short lived Babylonian Empire.

== Reign ==
Sin-Muballit succeeded his father Apil-Sin. No inscriptions for either king are known.

In Sin-Muballlit&#x27;s 13th year, he repelled the army of Larsa, which was frequently in conflict with Babylon. In the 17th year of his reign, Sin-Muballit took possession of the city of Isin and his power grew steadily over time as evidenced by his building and fortifying a number of towns. He abdicated due to failing health.

<text>HMS &quot;Scott&quot; is an ocean survey vessel of the Royal Navy, and the only vessel of her class. She is the third Royal Navy ship to carry the name, and the second to be named after the Antarctic explorer, Robert Falcon Scott. She was ordered to replace the survey ship .

==Construction==
The ship was ordered from BAeSEMA in 1995 to replace the ageing . She was built at the Appledore Shipbuilders in North Devon and launched on 13 October 1996 by Mrs Carolyn Portillo, wife of Michael Portillo, the then-Secretary of State for Defence. She was commissioned on 20 June 1997. Not only is she the largest vessel in the Royal Navy&#x27;s Hydrographic Squadron, and the fifth largest in the entire surface fleet, but she is also the largest survey vessel in Western Europe.

==Role==
&quot;Scott&quot; is the Royal Navy&#x27;s only ocean survey vessel. She can remain at sea for up to 300 days a year, thanks to her crew rotation system. Her complement of 78 is divided into three sections: two sections are required to keep the ship operational, with the third on shore on leave or in training. When the ship returns to port, one crew section on board is replaced by the section on shore. The ship can then deploy again almost immediately. As with all of the Royal Navy&#x27;s large survey vessels, &quot;Scott&quot; has an auxiliary role in support of mine countermeasure vessels.

==Service==
In February 2005 &quot;Scott&quot; surveyed the seabed around the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which varies in depth between and . The survey, conducted using a high-resolution, multi-beam sonar system, revealed that the earthquake had made a huge impact on the topography of the seabed.

In September 2006, &quot;Scott&quot; was granted the Freedom of the City of Swansea. From August 2008 until June 2009 she was refitted in Portsmouth.
On 26 October 2009 and again on 25 November 2010 the ship deployed to the South Atlantic and Antarctic to cover for the non-availability of the Royal Navy icebreaker . In February 2010, &quot;Scott&quot; hosted artist Rowan Huntley for a month in Antarctica, in a new artist-in-residence programme for the Royal Navy inaugurated by the Friends of the Scott Polar Research Institute (SPRI).

In June 2010, the ship visited Cardiff to mark the centenary of Robert Falcon Scott&#x27;s departure from Cardiff on 15 June 1910 for the South Pole, at the start of the Terra Nova Expedition. In February 2011, &quot;Scott&quot; hosted Dafila Scott, Scott&#x27;s granddaughter, in Antarctica for a month as the Friends of the SPRI&#x27;s second artist-in-residence.

The ship returned to Devonport in April 2011. With the task of Antarctic patrol taken over by in that year, &quot;Scott&quot; left Devonport in September to resume deep-water surveying, initially in the Atlantic. From November 2013 to June 2014 her most extensive refit to date took place, in Devonport. This included coating the hull with Hempasil X3 non-toxic anti-fouling paint, which is expected to increase her fuel efficiency.

The Ministry of Defence stated in October 2017 that the planned out-of-service date for &quot;Scott&quot; was to be 2022. In February 2022, it was indicated that the out of service date would be extended to 2023. In March 2023, and in advance of her purported decommissioning, the Defence Equipment Sales Authority (DESA) listed HMS Scott as for sale. However, in May 2023 it was reported that she would receive a major life extension refit and her service life would now be extended up to 2033 when she is likely to be replaced by the second Multi-Role Ocean Surveillance Ship which may be a new-build vessel for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. In the interim, HMS Scott underwent a shorter maintenance period in Gibraltar to continue operations during 2023.

She visited the United States in 2023 participating in US Navy Fleet Week from the 24th to the 29th May. From there she visited Portsmouth, New Hampshire where her ship&#x27;s company participated in the Portsmouth 400th anniversary celebrations. The ship&#x27;s company also visited the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Cemetery. On 3rd June, 2023 they participated in a Remembrance Service organised by the British &amp; Commonwealth Remembrance Project laying a wreath at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Royal Navy graves at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard Cemetery.

It has been reported that &quot;Scott&quot; would now carry at least one of the new 11-metre survey module variants of the &quot;Sea&quot;-class workboats being procured for various tasks in the Royal Navy. In late 2024, &quot;Scott&quot; entered refit at A&amp;P Falmouth to extend her service life to the early 2030s.

<doc id="676897" wikidata="Q584120" url="?curid=676897" title="Meshech Weare">
<text>Meshech Weare (June 16, 1713January 14, 1786) was an American farmer, lawyer, and statesman from Seabrook and Hampton Falls, New Hampshire. He served as the first president of New Hampshire. Before 1784 the position of governor was referred to as “president of New Hampshire.”
He is also called “The father of New Hampshire.” The first president of the earlier Province of New Hampshire was John Cutt.

==Family life==
Meshech was born to Deacon Nathaniel Weare and his second wife, Mary Waite, in what was then the Third Parish, New Hampshire. The site of the home is now in Seabrook, though the actual house burned down in the early 1900s.

Weare was baptized in modern-day Hampton Falls, New Hampshire, on June 21, 1713. He was the youngest of 14 children. Some of his siblings included (in order of baptism date) Elizabeth, Abigail, Mehitable, Susanna, and Nathan.

Weare graduated from Harvard College in 1735. He originally planned to work in the Congregational ministry, but those plans were changed after his marriage to Elizabeth Shaw in 1738. He planned on improving the land he and his wife bought after their marriage, but this plan was cut short by his wife&#x27;s death. He remarried to Mehitable Wainwright in 1746. During this time he began to study law, starting with the books passed down to him from his father and grandfather, who were former lay Judges in the provincial court.

The house in which Weare lived was built in 1737 by Samuel Shaw, and is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was later to be visited by George Washington, Marquis de Lafayette, and James Monroe. The back half of the house burnt many years after Weare&#x27;s death, although the front half was saved. It still stands in Hampton Falls, next to the park named after Weare and across from the town school, Lincoln Akerman School.

==Political life==
Weare&#x27;s political career began in 1739 when he became a town moderator. For the next 35 years, he served in various political positions, including selectman and representative of Hampton Falls in the Assembly. He was also the speaker of the House of Representatives three times, and its clerk for eight years. In 1754, he was one of New Hampshire&#x27;s delegates to the Albany Congress.

In September 1772, Weare served as one of the four judges in the trial of the participants in the Pine Tree Riot, an early act of rebellion against British authority in the Colonies. Although the defendants were found guilty (of assaulting a sheriff who had been enforcing laws against harvesting white pine reserved to the Crown), the light fines assessed by the court were seen as encouraging other such acts, including the Boston Tea Party.

On January 5, 1776, New Hampshire became the first American state to adopt a formal constitution. Weare was a leader in the drafting of this document, which served as the basic instrument of government for the ensuing eight years or until the adoption of a second and more permanent constitution in 1784. Under this constitution, there was no established executive, and the legislature was supreme. In practice, executive power was delegated to a Committee of Safety consisting of eight or ten legislative leaders. This committee had full power to act on behalf of the government while the legislature was not in session. After a brief interval, Weare was elected chairman of the Committee of Safety and served in this capacity throughout the Revolution.

In addition to being New Hampshire&#x27;s first &quot;Governor”, Weare was chief justice of the state&#x27;s highest court the &quot;Superior Court of Judicature&quot; from 1776 to 1782. He also served as presiding officer of the Council, then part of the upper house of the legislature. He managed to hold that position throughout the American Revolution. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782.

The Committee of Safety, over which Weare presided, was a most interesting governmental institution. It operated both at the state and (through a network of town committees of safety) at the local level, and was virtually a law unto itself while the legislature was not in session. Its duties included supervision and coordination of military affairs within the state, raising of recruits and supplies, regulation of the state militia, custody of prisoners of war, supervision of the entrance and clearance of vessels from Portsmouth Harbor, regulation of privateers and captured prizes, surveillance of the Loyalists, regulation of trade and currency (including prevention of counterfeiting), and supervision of price controls.

==Memorials==

The New Hampshire town of Weare (formerly Hale&#x27;s Town or Robie&#x27;s Town) was renamed in 1764 to honor his service as the town&#x27;s first clerk.

In Hampton Falls, a park, built in the early 2000s directly next to his house, is named for him. Weare&#x27;s grave is located in a small cemetery an eighth of a mile down the road.

<text>&quot;&#x27;&quot;, sometimes spelled &quot;&#x27;&quot;, are the first three words of an 11th-century text fragment written in Old Dutch. The fragment was discovered in 1932 on the back of the end-leaf of a manuscript that once belonged to the cathedral priory of Rochester, Kent, now Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 340. The manuscript contains a collection of Old English sermons by Ælfric of Eynsham. The Dutch text is found on fol. 169v and probably dates to the late 11th century. It was long considered to represent a West Flemish variant of Old Low Franconian, although more recent research shows that it also displays significant influence from Old English.

An often-cited poem, it was long believed by many Dutch-speakers to be the only remaining text in Old Dutch. However, experts were already aware of other sources that were then not yet easily accessible. Today, more than 42,000 Old Dutch words and phrases from sources such as the Wachtendonck Psalms and the Leiden Willeram have been discovered, with the oldest definitive source being the Salian Law.

==Text==
The complete text, a &quot;probatio pennae&quot; or &quot;scribble&quot; by the writer to test their pen, is usually transcribed as &quot;Hebban olla uogala nestas hagunnan hinase hic enda thu uuat unbidan uue nu&quot;, although the manuscript text is very faded and many scholars differ slightly in their reading of the poem. A word-for-word translation into Latin was written directly above it: . It is roughly translated as: &quot;All birds have begun nests, except me and you – what are we waiting for now?&quot; (Modern Dutch: )

==Origin==
The text was long considered West Flemish; the arguments in favour of this view were advanced by Moritz Schönfeld in 1933. According to his interpretation, *&quot;agunnan&quot;, &quot;hinase&quot; and (as he read it) &quot;anda&quot; are Ingvaeonic forms whose presence might be expected in any of the coastal dialects of Old Frisian, Old Saxon or Old Frankish. However, the -&quot;n&quot; of third person plural &quot;hebban&quot;, which is absent in both Old English and Frisian, identifies the language as Old Dutch. (Old High German &quot;habent&quot; uses a different stem.) Schönfeld identified &quot;nestas&quot; as the plural of a masculine &quot;nest&quot; that is attested in Middle Dutch and is still present in West Flemish, and he noted that &quot;vogala&quot; has an epenthetic vocal of a type also found in certain Old Ghentish words, whereas Old English has &quot;fuglas&quot;. The form &quot;olla&quot; is the result of a vowel shift &quot;a&quot; &gt; &quot;o&quot; before &quot;ll&quot; that is thought to have occurred in West Flemish at a very early date, possibly before 900.

The debate regarding the text&#x27;s language, however, was reopened in 2004, when Luc De Grauwe asserted that many of the text&#x27;s forms could also reflect the Kentish dialect of Old English. 
It has particularly been pointed out that the -&quot;s&quot; plural of &quot;nestas&quot;, the verb &quot;aginnan&quot; and the ending on -&quot;e&quot; of &quot;hinase&quot; are in fact more typical of Old English. The emerging consensus view is that the text is a linguistic blend of Old Dutch and Old English; it may even reflect a Flemish-speaking scribe&#x27;s attempt at writing in English, making it not only a , or pen trial, but also a &quot;&quot;, or language trial.

==Language comparisons==
Kenny Louwen gives a comparison of different forms the sentence would be expected to take in Old Dutch, Old English and Middle Dutch, which highlights the linguistic influences the text as it survives in the manuscript. (He reads &quot;umbidan&quot; rather than &quot;unbidan&quot;.)

Below is a comparison of the manuscript text with its closest translations into modern Dutch and English. The Dutch sentence is a correct one, although the verb &quot;begonnen&quot; is usually conjugated with &quot;zijn&quot; (be) and not with &quot;hebben&quot; (have). For English the word order had to be adjusted. For &quot;hinase&quot; and &quot;unbidan&quot; there are no close matches in either language.
The form &quot;hinase&quot; corresponds morphologically to Modern Dutch &quot;tenzij&quot;, meaning &quot;unless&quot;, from &quot;hit ne sī&quot;, Modern Dutch &quot;het niet zij&quot;, literally &quot;it were not to be&quot;. It does not seem to have a Modern English cognate.

==Various theories==
Frits van Oostrom has linked it to the Moorish Kharjas genre, which includes verses sung by women to their absent lovers. He concludes that the fragment was probably written by a woman or from a female perspective.

<text>The &quot;Echo&quot; class was a class of multi-purpose hydrographic survey ships in commission with the Royal Navy. The ships were primarily tasked with conducting survey work in support of submarine and amphibious operations, however, the class also has a secondary role in mine countermeasures. The two vessels of the class were the most recent additions to the Royal Navy&#x27;s Hydrographic Squadron. Each ship displaced approximately 3,700 tonnes, and was equipped with a state of the art suite of equipment. The lead ship of the class, HMS &quot;Echo&quot;, was retired in 2022 and her sister ship in 2023.

==Design==
&quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Enterprise&quot; were the first Royal Navy ships to be fitted with azimuth thrusters. Both azimuth thrusters and the bow thruster can be controlled through the integrated navigation system by a joystick providing high manoeuvrability. Complete control and monitoring for power generation and propulsion, together with all auxiliary plant systems, tank gauging and damage control functions is provided through the integrated platform management system (IPMS), accessible through workstations around the ship. The range of equipment carried includes the following:

* Multi beam echo sounder
* Single beam echo sounder
* Survey Planning and Processing Systems
* Side-scan sonar
* Oceanographic Probe and sensors
* Undulating Oceanographic Profiler
* Doppler Current Log
* Sub-bottom Profiler
* Bottom Sampling Equipment
* Survey motor boat fitted with multi-beam sonar and sidescan sonar

The vessels were armed. They carried a GAM-B01 20 mm cannon (a naval version of the Oerlikon 20 mm cannon), two miniguns and four General Purpose Machine Guns.

==Role==
The vessels were designed to conduct survey tasks in support of submarines or amphibious operations. They provided almost real-time tailored environmental information, and also have a secondary role as a mine countermeasure tasking authority platform, for which they were capable of embarking a dedicated mine counter measures command team, and supporting other mine warfare vessels.

==Manning==
The two ships followed the same type of crew rotation pattern as , in that two-thirds of their crew was needed to keep the ship operational, with the remaining one-third ashore. This allowed each ship to be available for deployment for up to 330 days a year.

The ship&#x27;s crew consisted of 72 personnel, with 48 on board at any one time, working a cycle of 75 days on, 30 days off. The ships were able to accommodate 81 personnel if necessary. In support of this high availability, all accommodation and recreational facilities were designed for an unusual (in a warship) degree of comfort. All personnel shared double cabins with private facilities, except the captain and executive officer who both had single cabins.

<text>John Taylor Gilman (December 19, 1753September 1, 1828) was a farmer, shipbuilder and statesman from Exeter, New Hampshire. He represented New Hampshire in the Continental Congress in 1782–1783 and was the fifth governor of New Hampshire for 14 years, from 1794 to 1805, and from 1813 to 1816.

==Early life==
Gilman was born in Exeter, in the Province of New Hampshire, the son of Ann (Taylor) and Nicholas Gilman. His brother was Nicholas Gilman, who had signed the U.S. Constitution. His family had settled in Exeter in its earliest days. He lived in the Ladd-Gilman House, now a part of the American Independence Museum. He received a limited education before he entered into the family shipbuilding and mercantile businesses. Aged 22, he read aloud a Dunlap Broadside brought to New Hampshire on July 16, 1776 to the city of Exeter. The American Independence Museum commemorates his brave act every year at their American Independence Festival, where a role-player reads the Declaration in its entirety to festival-goers.

==Career==
 Gilman was one of the Minutemen of 1775 and a selectman in 1777 and 1778. Gilman served as a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1779 and 1781 and was a delegate to the Convention of the States in Hartford, Connecticut, in October 1780. He served as a member of the Continental Congress in 1782 and 1783. He was the New Hampshire Treasurer in 1791 and moderator in 1791–1794, 1806, 1807, 1809–1811, 1817, 1818, and 1820–1825.

Gilman served as Governor of New Hampshire between 1794 and 1805 and was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1805. He was again a member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives in 1810 and 1811 and again an unsuccessful candidate for governor in 1812. He was elected governor and served from 1813 to 1816 and declined to be a candidate for renomination for governor in 1816. He was an ex officio trustee of Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire (1794–1805 and 1813–1816), and trustee by election (1817–1819). He was president of the board of trustees of Phillips Exeter Academy, Exeter, New Hampshire, 1795–1827, and donor of the oldest property, the &#x27;Yard,&#x27; upon which the older buildings stand. Gilman was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814.

==Personal life==
Gilman was married to Deborah (Folsom) Gilman, the daughter of Major General Nathaniel Folsom of Exeter. He died in Exeter on September 1, 1828. He is the first governor of New Hampshire not to have a place in the state named after him. The town of Gilmanton, settled by 24 members of the extended Gilman clan, was named for the family as a whole and not for the Governor.

<doc id="676905" wikidata="Q507703" url="?curid=676905" title="IRC bot">
<text>An IRC bot is a set of scripts or an independent program that connects to Internet Relay Chat as a client, and so appears to other IRC users as another user. An IRC bot differs from a regular client in that instead of providing interactive access to IRC for a human user, it performs automated functions.

==Function==
Often, an IRC bot is deployed as a detached program running from a stable host. It sits on an IRC channel to keep it open and prevents malicious users from taking over the channel. It can be configured to give channel operator status to privileged users when they join the channel, and can provide a unified channel operator list. Many of these features require that the bot be a channel operator. Thus, most IRC bots are run from computers which have long uptimes (generally running a BSD derivative or Linux) and a fast, stable Internet connection. As IRC has become popular with many dial-up users as well, shell accounts at shell providers have become popular as a stable Linux server with a decent connection to run a bot from.

Aside from managing channel permissions, a bot can also perform functions such as logging what is posted to an IRC channel, giving out information on demand (very popular in IRC channels dealing with user support), creating statistics tracking the channel&#x27;s top posters and longest-lived lurkers, or hosting trivia, Uno and other games. These functions are usually provided by scripts, often written in a scripting programming language such as Tcl or Perl by the bot&#x27;s users. Channels dedicated to file sharing often use XDCC bots to distribute their files.

IRC bots are particularly useful on IRC networks such as EFnet and IRCnet without channel registration services, and on networks like Undernet or QuakeNet that require conditions to be met (minimum user count, etc.) before a channel may be registered. Where bots are used for administrative functions such as this, they may need more access than a normal client connection allows. Some versions of IRC have a &quot;Service&quot; protocol that allows clients with these extra powers. Such server-sanctioned bots are called IRC services.

Bots are not always welcome. Some IRC networks forbid the usage of bots. One of the reasons for doing so is that each nickname connected to the network increases the size of the network database which is being kept in sync across all servers. Allowing for bots in large networks can cause a relevant amount of network traffic overhead which needs to be financed and may even lead to netsplits.

<text>The Terminal is a 2004 American comedy-drama film produced and directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci. The film is about an Eastern European man who is stuck in New York&#x27;s John F. Kennedy Airport terminal when he is denied entry to the United States, but is unable to return to his native country because of a military coup.

The film is partially inspired by the true story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri who lived in Terminal 1 of Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, France, from 1988 to 2006.

After finishing &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; (2002), Spielberg decided to direct &quot;The Terminal&quot; because he wanted to make a film &quot;that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world&quot;. As no suitable airport was willing to provide their facilities, an entire working set was built inside a large hangar at the LA/Palmdale Regional Airport, with most of the film&#x27;s exterior shots taken from the Montreal–Mirabel International Airport.

The film was released in North America on June 18, 2004, to generally positive reviews and was a commercial success, earning $219 million worldwide.

== Plot ==
Viktor Navorski, a traveler from Krakozhia, arrives at New York City&#x27;s John F. Kennedy International Airport and learns that a coup d&#x27;état has occurred in his country while he was in the air. The United States does not recognize Krakozhia&#x27;s new government, rendering Viktor&#x27;s passport invalid and leaving him unable to either enter the United States or return to Krakozhia. U.S. Customs and Border Protection seize his passport and return ticket, pending resolution of the issue, leaving him stranded at the airport with only his luggage and a Planters peanut can.

Frank Dixon, the Acting Field Commissioner of the airport, instructs Viktor to stay in the transit lounge until the issue is resolved, but becomes determined to make Viktor someone else&#x27;s problem. He tries to tempt Viktor to leave illegally by ordering guards away from the exit for five minutes, but it fails. Dixon then tries to persuade Viktor to claim asylum, but Viktor refuses, as he is not afraid of returning to his own country.

Viktor finds a gate under renovation and makes it his home. Dixon, who is being considered for a promotion, becomes increasingly obsessed with getting rid of Viktor. Meanwhile, Viktor begins reading an English version of his New York guide book, which is in his own language, so that he can learn English.

He has repeated encounters with Gupta Rajan, a grumpy elderly janitor, with whom he slowly forms a bond. He also befriends Joe Mulroy, a baggage handler who plays poker, betting lost luggage items. Enrique Cruz, a food service truck driver, provides Viktor with free meals in exchange for helping him woo Dolores Torres, an immigration officer that Viktor has befriended.

He shows skill at construction work when he remodels a wall in a terminal undergoing renovation. The airport contractors assume he is an employee and pay him under the table. He also begins a relationship with Amelia, a flight attendant who is also entangled with a married government official.

During a visit from his superiors, Dixon enlists Viktor&#x27;s help in communicating with a man from a country neighboring Krakozhia, who is desperately attempting to bring medicine home to his dying father. Dixon is determined to refuse the man because of a paperwork issue, which Viktor helps the young man circumvent, incensing and embarrassing Dixon, who threatens Viktor and tells him he will never allow him to enter the United States. This incident is witnessed by Dixon&#x27;s superiors, who give him a look of contempt before leaving, while Viktor becomes a legend amongst the terminal employees for helping the man and standing up to Dixon.

Dixon detains Amelia and interrogates her about Viktor. Amelia, who realizes Viktor has not been entirely truthful, confronts him at his makeshift home, where he shows her that the Planters peanut can contains a copy of the &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot; photograph. His late father was a jazz enthusiast who had discovered the picture in a Hungarian newspaper in 1958 and vowed to collect the autographs of all 57 musicians depicted in it. He died needing only the autograph of tenor saxophonist Benny Golson, and Viktor has come to New York to get it. After hearing the story, Amelia kisses Viktor.

Nine months after having arrived, Viktor learns that the war in Krakozhia has ended. Amelia reveals that her married boyfriend has secured Viktor a one-day emergency visa so he can fulfill his dream, but that she has also rekindled the relationship.

When he presents the emergency visa at customs, Viktor is told that Dixon must sign it. However, as Viktor&#x27;s passport is now valid again, Dixon is determined to deport him back to Krakozhia. He warns Viktor that if he does not go home at once, he will prosecute his friends at the airport for their illegal activities, most seriously by deporting Gupta back to India to face a charge of assaulting a corrupt police officer. Viktor finally agrees to return home, but Gupta delays the plane by running in front of it and is taken into custody.

Emboldened by his friend&#x27;s actions, Viktor decides to leave the airport. Several airport employees rush to say goodbye, but Dixon orders his officers to stop Viktor at the exit where, disillusioned with Dixon, they let him leave. Dixon reaches the taxi stand only moments after Viktor has left, but has a change of heart and tells his officers to handle the incoming travelers rather than engage in pursuit. Viktor arrives at the hotel where Golson is performing and finally collects the last autograph, then takes a taxi back to the airport to go home.

== Production ==

The idea for the film may have originated from the story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri, also known as Sir Alfred, an Iranian refugee who lived in Terminal One of the Charles de Gaulle airport, Paris from 1988 until 2006. In September 2003, &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Spielberg bought the rights to Nasseri&#x27;s life story as the basis for the film; and in September 2004 &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted Nasseri received thousands of dollars from the filmmakers. However, none of the studio&#x27;s publicity materials mention Nasseri&#x27;s story as an inspiration for the film, and the storyline bears no resemblance to Nasseri&#x27;s experiences. The 1993 French film &quot;Lost in Transit&quot; was already based on the same story. In deciding to make the film, Spielberg stated that after directing &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, &quot;I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world. ... This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times.&quot;

Spielberg traveled around the world to find an actual airport that would let him film for the length of the production, but could not find one. &quot;The Terminal&quot; set was built in a massive hangar at the LA/Palmdale Regional Airport. The hangar, part of the U.S. Air Force Plant 42 complex was used to build the Rockwell International B-1B bomber. The set was built to full earthquake construction codes and was based on Düsseldorf Airport. The shape of both the actual terminal and the set viewed sideways is a cross-section of an aircraft wing. Because of this design, the film was one of the first to use the Spidercam. The camera, most often used for televised sports, allowed Spielberg the ability to create sweeping shots across the set. The design of the set for &quot;The Terminal&quot;, as noted by Roger Ebert in his reviews and attested by Spielberg himself in a feature by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, was greatly inspired by Jacques Tati&#x27;s classic film &quot;PlayTime&quot;.

Hanks based his characterization of Viktor Navorski on his father-in-law Allan Wilson, a Bulgarian immigrant who speaks &quot;Russian, Turkish, Polish, Greek, little bit of Italian, little bit of French&quot;, in addition to his native Bulgarian. Hanks also had some help from a Bulgarian translator.

=== Krakozhia ===
Krakozhia (&quot;Кракожия&quot;) is a fictional country, created for the film, that closely resembles a former Soviet Republic or an Eastern Bloc state.

The exact location of Krakozhia is kept intentionally vague in the film. However, in one scene, a map of Krakozhia is briefly displayed on one of the airport&#x27;s television screens during a news report on the ongoing conflict. Its borders are those of present-day North Macedonia (known as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia at the time of the film&#x27;s production). However, in another scene, Viktor shows his driver&#x27;s license, which is a Belarusian license issued to a woman bearing an Uzbek name.

John Williams, the film&#x27;s composer, also wrote a national anthem for Krakozhia.

Hanks&#x27; character speaks mostly Bulgarian as his native Krakozhian. However in one scene, in which he helps a Russian-speaking passenger with a customs-related issue, he speaks a constructed Slavic language resembling Bulgarian and Russian. When Viktor buys a guide book of New York both in English and in his mother tongue to compare the two versions and improve his English, the book he studies is written in Russian.

The film presents a reasonably accurate picture of the process of naturalistic second-language acquisition, according to linguist Martha Young-Scholten.

== Soundtrack ==

Emily Bernstein played clarinet for the score, including several prominent solos, and her name is in the film&#x27;s end credits. Normally individual musicians in studio orchestras perform anonymously, but Spielberg insisted on highlighting Bernstein&#x27;s work; she was being treated for cancer at the time of recording, and she died less than a year later.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Terminal&quot; grossed $77.9 million in North America, and $141.2 million in other territories, totaling $219.4 million worldwide.

The film grossed $19.1 million in its opening weekend, finishing in second, then made $13.1 million in its second weekend, dropping to third.

=== Critical response ===
Rotten Tomatoes reported that 61% of 206 sampled critics gave &quot;The Terminal&quot; positive reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Terminal&quot; transcends its flaws through the sheer virtue of its crowd-pleasing message and a typically solid star turn from Tom Hanks.&quot; At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Michael Wilmington from the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said &quot;[the film] takes Spielberg into realms he&#x27;s rarely traveled before.&quot; A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Hanks&#x27; performance brought a lot to the film.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave &quot;The Terminal&quot; three and a half out of four stars, stating that &quot;This premise could have yielded a film of contrivance and labored invention. Spielberg, his actors and writers... weave it into a human comedy that is gentle and true, that creates sympathy for all of its characters, that finds a tone that will carry them through, that made me unreasonably happy&quot;. Martin Liebman of Blu-ray.com considers the film as &quot;quintessential cinema&quot;, praising it for being &quot;a down-to-earth, honest, hopeful, funny, moving, lightly romantic, and dramatically relevant film that embodies the term &#x27;movie magic&#x27; in every scene.&quot; Critic Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com considered &quot;The Terminal&quot; alongside &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; and &quot;Munich&quot; (also directed by Spielberg) as the three best films made within the studio system that comment upon the September 11 attacks.

<doc id="676910" wikidata="Q1321691" url="?curid=676910" title="Lithophyte">
<text>Lithophytes are plants that grow in or on rocks. They can be classified as either epilithic (or epipetric) or endolithic; epilithic lithophytes grow on the surfaces of rocks, while endolithic lithophytes grow in the crevices of rocks (and are also referred to as chasmophytes). Lithophytes can also be classified as being either obligate or facultative. Obligate lithophytes grow solely on rocks, while facultative lithophytes will grow partially on a rock and on another substrate simultaneously.

==Nutrients==
Lithophytes that grow on land feed off nutrients from rain water and nearby decaying plants, including their own dead tissue. It is easier for to acquire nutrients because they grow in fissures in rocks where soil or organic matter has accumulated.

For most lithophytes, nitrogen is only available through interactions with the atmosphere. The most readily available form of nitrogen in the atmosphere is the gaseous state of ammonia (NH3). Lithophytes consume atmospheric ammonia through a concentration gradient that allows the compound to traverse the plants&#x27; apoplast. Once free in the apoplast, gaseous ammonia is absorbed into metabolic cells by the enzyme glutamine synthetase.

To be able to absorb the few nutrients available on rocks or rocky substrates efficiently, lithophytes have evolved certain adaptations. They possess decreased numbers of root hairs and larger root diameters in comparison to other plant species. To add to this nutrient uptake efficiency, lithophytic plants have increased their relationship with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and dark septate endophyte fungi. These two types of fungi live inter- and intracellularly with the roots of lithophytes and a wide variety of other plant species. They increase the uptake of nutrients and water and have been found in greater concentrations in lithophytes.

==Walls colonised as artificial cliffs by lithophytes==
 Walls, and other exposed stonework, are colonised by plants in a similar way to the colonisation of cliffs and scree. These natural features are uncommon, especially in the lowlands, so walls are important for the conservation of plants which might otherwise be very isolated. Some wall plants even have &#x27;wall&#x27; or &#x27;muralis&#x27; as part of their common or scientific name such as wall-flower (&quot;Erysimum cheiri&quot;) or ivy-leaved toadflax (&quot;Cymbalaria muralis&quot;), which shows their long established relationship with these man-made structures.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;English Heritage&lt;br&gt;&quot;Landscape Advice Note: Vegetation on Walls&quot; 

==Examples==
Examples of lithophytes include many orchids such as &quot;Dendrobium&quot; and &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;, bromeliads such as &quot;Tillandsia&quot;, as well as many ferns, algae and liverworts. Lithophytes have also been found in many other plant families, such as, Liliaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Begoniaceae, Caprifoliaceae, Crassulaceae, Piperaceae and Selaginellaceae.

===Carnivorous plants===
As nutrients tend to be rarely available to lithophytes or chasmophytes, many species of carnivorous plants can be viewed as being pre-adapted to life on rocks. By consuming prey, these plants can gather more nutrients than non-carnivorous lithophytes. Examples include the pitcher plants &quot;Nepenthes campanulata&quot; and &quot;Heliamphora exappendiculata&quot;, many &quot;Pinguicula&quot; and several &quot;Utricularia&quot; species.

==Tennyson poem inspired by lithophyte==

In the year 1863, Alfred, Lord Tennyson was moved to write his short and pithy poem of metaphysical speculation
Flower in the Crannied Wall upon contemplating an unnamed lithophyte growing out of the masonry of the wishing well at Waggoners Wells. 
&lt;poem&gt;Flower in the crannied wall,
I pluck you out of the crannies,
I hold you here, root and all, in my hand,
Little flower—but if I could understand
What you are, root and all, and all in all,
I should know what God and man is.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>A 529 plan, also called a Qualified Tuition Program, is a tax-advantaged investment vehicle in the United States designed to encourage saving for the future higher education expenses of a designated beneficiary. In 2017, K–12 public, private, and religious school tuition were included as qualified expenses for 529 plans along with post-secondary education costs after passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

== Overview ==
529 plans are named after section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code—. While most plans allow investors from out of state, there can be significant state tax advantages and other benefits, such as matching grant and scholarship opportunities, protection from creditors and exemption from state financial aid calculations for investors who invest in 529 plans in their state of residence. Contributions to 529 college savings plans are made with after-tax dollars. Once money is invested in the account, it grows tax-free, and withdrawals from the plans are not taxed when the money is used for qualified educational expenses. Only 2.5 percent of all families had 529 college savings accounts in 2013. As of August 2020, more than $360 billion was invested in 529 college savings plans.

There are two types of 529 plans: prepaid plans and savings plans.

* Prepaid plans
** Prepaid plans allow one to purchase tuition credits at today&#x27;s rates to be used in the future. Therefore, performance is based upon tuition inflation.
** Prepaid plans may be administered by states or higher education institutions. 
** Currently, nine states provide a prepaid tuition plan that is accepting new applicants. Those states include Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, and Washington.
* Savings plans
** Savings plans are different in that all growth is based upon market performance of the underlying investments, which typically consist of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF). Investors can select stocks and bonds via preset investment menus.
** Most 529 savings plans offer a variety of age-based asset allocation options where the underlying investments become more conservative as the beneficiary gets closer to college age.
** Savings plans may be administered by states only. 
*** Although states administer savings plans, record-keeping and administrative services for many savings plans are usually delegated to a mutual fund company or other financial services company.

With the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA), 529 plans gained their current prominence and tax advantages. Qualified distributions from 529 plans for qualified higher education expenses or tuition for elementary or secondary schools are exempt from federal income tax.

==History==
529 college savings plan originated from states rather than the federal government. With tuition cost increasing year by year, the state-run prepaid tuition program of Michigan addressed the increasing anxiety on the part of many thousands of Michigan households with the Michigan Education Trust (MET) proposition. This created a fund to which the state&#x27;s residents could pay a fixed amount in exchange for tuition increases. The initiative sparked interest in other states, which launched their first prepaid tuition program.

Michigan delayed its own launch so that a ruling could be requested from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regarding the tax aspect of arrangement. The IRS allowed purchasers of the &quot;prepaid tuition contract&quot; to not be taxed on the accruing value of the contract until the year in which funds were distributed or refunded. Additionally, the trust fund established by the state of Michigan was required to receive prepayments and be subject to income tax on earnings from the invested funds.

The Michigan Education Trust (MET) entered into prepaid tuition contracts with Michigan&#x27;s residents. An estimated 55,000 individuals signed up for the program. MET paid federal income tax on its investment earnings, and in 1990 filed suit for refund from the IRS. The case was first decided in favor of the IRS, but on appeal in 1994 the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the district court judge&#x27;s decision and found in Michigan&#x27;s favor.

At one point MET sold prepaid tuition contracts that were below market value, and the program had to be adjusted with appropriate pricing. Today it remains as one of the largest and most successful pre-paid programs.

Subsequently, Congress has passed new legislation authorizing qualified state tuition programs. This is now part of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. Section 529 was added to the Internal Revenue Code, conferring tax exemption to qualifying state programs and deferring tax on participant&#x27;s undistributed earnings.

Section 529 advanced to the Clinton administration&#x27;s agenda and became part of Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA). The TRA made changes such as deduction on student loans, penalty-free IRA withdrawals for higher education, and adding room and board to the list of qualifying expenses.

Another provision was added to the bill to make Section 529 distributions tax-free, not just tax deferred when used for college. Bill Clinton vetoed this provision.

In 2001, when George W. Bush was president, new tax bills were crafted in both the Senate and the House of Representatives containing the previously vetoed changes.

With limited Democratic support, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act (EGTRRA) of 2001 was signed into law on June 7, 2001.

Due to federal budget constraints, EGTRRA stated that every tax provision within the new law would expire on December 31, 2010. Congressional leaders decided to insert a provision in the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) that would make all EGTRRA charges to Section 529 permanent, including tax-free treatment for qualified distributions.

Changes to the structure and marketing of 529 plans over the years have contributed to their growth. The states partnered up with the professional investment community, which allowed them to offer 529 plans with the feel of mutual funds. Also, registered brokers and investment advisors can directly assist families in understanding 529 plans and selecting an appropriate investment.

Other changes that have resulted in a growth in adoption include: federal legislation regarding taxes, financial aid, asset protection; on-going program improvement; lowering of expenses; generous state incentives; positive media coverage; and college savings registries that allow people sign up for the program. Some employers offer 529 plans to their employees as a benefit, similar to retirement plans, or even with contribution matching.

In 2014, Congress passed the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Act, laying the groundwork for ABLE accounts. ABLE, or 529A, accounts are similar to 529 plans, except for the purpose of saving for a disabled beneficiary&#x27;s special needs.

In his 2015 State of the Union address, President Obama proposed removing the tax-free status of distributions of 529 plans. He abandoned the proposal after it met with heavy opposition.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 heavily expanded 529 plans to include K–12 public, private, and religious school tuition. The original plan, called the Cruz amendment, called for homeschool expenses to also qualify for 529 plans but due to the Byrd Rule in the Senate the homeschool expenses provision was stricken by the Senate parliamentarian while the K–12 tuition provision was allowed. According to the new law 529 plans can be used to fund all K–12 school tuition costs up to $10,000 per year per child. The SECURE Act further expanded the use of 529 plans to cover student loan repayments. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act also allowed rollovers from 529 plans to ABLE accounts, as long as the ABLE account beneficiary is the original 529 beneficiary or a qualified family member. The allowed annual rollover amount is set at the standard IRS gift tax exemption, less any other contributions made in the current tax year.

Secure ACT 2.0 of Jan 2023 allows for tax and penalty free rollovers from 529 accounts to Roth IRAs, under certain conditions. Beneficiaries of 529 college savings accounts would be permitted to rollover up to $35,000 over the course of their lifetime from any 529 account in their name to their Roth IRA. These rollovers are also subject to Roth IRA annual contribution limits, and the 529 account must have been open for more than 15 years.

==Use for qualified education expenses==
The funds from a 529 plan are used for qualified education expenses. These expenses are typically tuition, fees, textbooks, computers and equipment and are charged to the student in relation to attending an institution defined as any eligible public, non-profit or private college or university, technical, vocational, or trade institutions. Expenses for special needs services needed by a special needs beneficiary must be incurred in connection with enrollment or attendance at an eligible post-secondary school or institution as described previously. For expenses to qualify, the student must be enrolled for at least half the full-time academic workload for the course of study the student is pursuing, as determined under the standards of the school where the student is enrolled. Institutions are considered eligible if they participate in a financial aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education. This may also include some foreign educational institutions located outside of the United States, but they must be eligible to participate in a financial aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education as well.

Additionally, as determined by state law, eligible expenses of no more than $10,000 of tuition incurred by a designated beneficiary enrolled in elementary or secondary school may be used at any eligible public, private or religious school that provides elementary or secondary education.

Room and board are also considered eligible expenses for both on-campus and off-campus housing. For on-campus housing – the expense allowed is the actual amount charged if the student is residing in housing owned or operated by the school. For off-campus housing – the expense is allowed up to the amount allowed for on-campus room and board, as determined by the school, that was included in the cost of attendance (for federal financial aid purposes) for a particular academic period and living arrangement of the student. 529 plan qualified expenses for off-campus housing are not limited to rent. They can include groceries and utilities. For tax purposes, receipts for all qualified expenses must be kept.

Recent changes now allow expenses for fees, books, supplies, and equipment required for the designated beneficiary&#x27;s participation in an apprenticeship program registered and certified with the Secretary of Labor under section 1 of the National Apprenticeship Act to be considered eligible expenses.

Qualified education expenses formerly did not include student loans and student loan interest. However, on December 12, 2019, the SECURE Act was signed into law, which allows for 529 withdrawals for &quot;principal or interest on any qualified education loan&quot;, under certain conditions:
* No more than $10,000 may be withdrawn for the purposes of paying a student loan
* The $10,000 limit is a &quot;maximum lifetime limit&quot; per beneficiary and sibling

A distribution from a 529 plan that is not used for the above qualified educational expenses is subject to income tax and an additional 10% early-distribution penalty on the earnings portion of the distribution. The tax penalty is waived if any of the following conditions is satisfied:
* The designated beneficiary dies, and the distribution goes to another beneficiary or to the estate of the designated beneficiary.
* The designated beneficiary becomes disabled. People providing proof of being unable do any substantial gainful activity because of a physical or mental condition are considered disabled. A physician must determine that the individual&#x27;s condition can be expected to result in death or continue indefinitely.
* The designated beneficiary receives any of the following:
** a qualified scholarship excludable from gross income
** veterans&#x27; educational assistance
** employer-provided educational assistance
** any other nontaxable payments (other than gifts, bequests or inheritances) received for education expenses
* The distribution is rolled over into an ABLE account whose beneficiary is either the original fund beneficiary or a qualified family member.

==Advantages==
There are many advantages to the 529 plan:

First, although contributions are not deductible from the donor&#x27;s federal income tax liability, many states provide state income tax benefits for all or part of the contributions of the donor. Beyond the potential state income tax deduction possibilities, a prime benefit of the 529 plan is that the principal grows tax-deferred and distributions for the beneficiary&#x27;s college costs are exempt from tax.

Many states give the account owner a full or partial state income tax deduction or tax credit for their contributions to the state&#x27;s section 529 plans. So far a total of 35 states and the District of Columbia offer such a deduction. California, Delaware, Hawaii, Kentucky, Maine, New Jersey, and North Carolina currently have state income taxes but do not offer a state income tax deduction or tax credit for contributions to the state&#x27;s 529 college savings plan. Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, New Hampshire, Washington and Wyoming do not have state income taxes. Contributions to other states&#x27; section 529 plans are generally not deductible in the account holder&#x27;s home state. Only Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana and Pennsylvania provide for state tax parity, where contributions to any state plan are eligible for the state&#x27;s income tax deduction.

Second, the donor maintains control of the account. With few exceptions, the named beneficiary has no rights to the funds. Most plans allow donors to reclaim the funds at any time for their own use. However, if a &quot;non-qualified&quot; withdrawal is made, the earnings portion will be subject to income tax and an additional 10% penalty tax.

Third, a 529 plan can provide a convenient, hands-off way to save for college. Having selected which 529 plan to use, the donor completes a simple enrollment form and makes a contribution (or signs up for automatic deposits). The ongoing investment of the account is handled by the plan, not by the donor. Plan assets are professionally managed either by the state treasurer&#x27;s office or by an outside investment company hired as the program manager. The donor will not receive a Form 1099 to report taxable or nontaxable earnings until the year of the withdrawals. If an investment switch is desired, donors may change to a different option in a 529 savings program every year (program permitting) or the account may be rolled over to a different state&#x27;s program provided no such rollover for the beneficiary has occurred in the prior 12 months. 529 plans generally have very low minimum start-up and contribution requirements. The fees, compared with other investment vehicles, are low, although this depends on the state administering the plan. Finally, everyone is eligible to take advantage of a 529 plan, and the amounts that can be put in are substantial (over $300,000 per beneficiary in many state plans). Generally, there are no income limitations or age restrictions.

A final advantage of the assets in a 529 plan is that, although they can be reclaimed by the donor (subject to income tax and the 10% additional penalty on any gains), the assets are not counted as part of the donor&#x27;s gross estate for estate tax purposes. Thus 529 plans can be used as an estate planning tool to move assets outside of the estate while still retaining some measure of control if the money is needed in the future. A beneficiary must be designated and the income tax savings are still only obtained if the money is eventually spent for education, though in some cases estate taxes can be reduced without spending the money on education.

In addition, under the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, 529 college savings plans and prepaid tuition plans are now treated as an asset of the account owner (typically the parent), meaning they have little impact on a student&#x27;s eligibility for financial aid.

Under the SECURE Act of 2019, up to $10,000 of funds from a 529 plan can be used towards student loan expenses.

=== Transferable ===
Another benefit associated with 529 Plans is the ability to transfer unused amounts to other qualified members of the beneficiary&#x27;s family without incurring any tax penalty. According to the IRS website (Publication 970), this type of transfer is known as a Rollover and is explained at length in their Qualified Tuition Program (QTP) section. Any amount paid to another QTP within 60 days of distribution is considered Rolled Over and does not require reporting anywhere on Form 1040 or 1040NR.

Qualified members of the beneficiary&#x27;s family include the beneficiary&#x27;s:
*Spouse
*Son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, adopted child, or a descendant of any of them.
*Brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister.
*Father or mother or ancestor of either.
*Stepfather or stepmother.
*Son or daughter of a brother or sister.
*Brother or sister of father or mother.
*Son-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law.
*The spouse of any individual listed above.
*First cousin.

==Disadvantages==
While the number and types of 529 plans are growing, not all investment vehicles are available in 529 form.

Unlike almost all other types of tax-deferred plans, such as 401(k) plans, IRS rules allow only two exchanges or reallocation of assets per year in a 529 plan. This limitation also applies to ABLE accounts.

The earnings portion of money withdrawn from a 529 plan that is not spent on eligible expenses (or rolled over into an ABLE account for any eligible family member) is subject to income tax, an additional 10% federal tax penalty, and the possibility of a recapture of any state tax deductions or credits taken. For example, if $50,000 is contributed to a 529 plan, where it grows to $60,000 over time, and an unqualified withdrawal is made for the entire amount, the $10,000 gain is taxable and a 10% penalty on the $10,000 is applicable (i.e. $1,000).

Paying qualified expenses directly from a 529 account that is owned by someone other than the student or parent may reduce a student&#x27;s eligibility for need-based financial aid.

Paying college expenses directly from a 529 account may reduce eligibility for the American Opportunity Tax Credit, due to IRS coordination restrictions. To claim the full credit (in addition to meeting other criteria, such as income limits), $4,000 of college tuition and textbook expenses per year should be paid from non-529 plan funds.

The 529 plan for the state in which one is domiciled may have higher fees (expense ratios) – which are not required to be disclosed in marketing materials and can range from under 0.4% to more than 1.1% – than the plans of other states. For example, a 529 plan in which $2,000 is deposited each year for 18 years would accumulate over $4,000 in fees with a 1.1% expense ratio but only $1,400 in fees with a 0.4% expense ratio – a savings of $2,600. Generally, direct-sold 529 plans have lower fees than advisor-sold 529 plans.

==Deductibility of losses==
In certain circumstances where a 529 account has experienced investment losses over the term of its existence, the contributor to the account may withdraw the funds and have the losses deducted from taxable income (but not counted as such for Alternative Minimum Tax purposes).

==Gift tax considerations==
Contributions to 529 plans are considered gifts under the federal gift tax regulations and hence any contributions in excess of the annual exclusion. The annual exclusion in 2024 is $18,000 if filing single (or $90,000 over five years) or $36,000 if filing married jointly (or $180,000 over a five-year period) count against the one-time gift/estate tax exemption. The five-year period is known as the five-year carry-forward option: Once the single donor puts in $90,000 or the married jointly donor puts in $180,000, they are not able to make another contribution (gift) to that individual (without using part of their lifetime gifting exclusion) for five years.

Since tuition payments to an educational institution are not subject to the annual gift limitation, parents who are trying to minimize estate taxes may be better off making their annual gifts to another vehicle such as a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) account and then paying the tuition directly. However, this may significantly reduce the student&#x27;s eligibility for need-based financial aid.

<text>SWF () is a defunct Adobe Flash file format that was used for multimedia, vector graphics and ActionScript.

Originating with FutureWave Software, then transferred to Macromedia, and then coming under the control of Adobe, SWF files can contain animations or applets of varying degrees of interactivity and function. They may also occur in programs, commonly browser games, using ActionScript.

Programmers can generate SWF files from within several Adobe products, including Flash, Flash Builder (an IDE), Adobe Animate (a rename of Adobe Flash since 2016), and After Effects, as well as through MXMLC, a command-line application compiler which forms part of the freely-available Flex SDK. Although Adobe Illustrator can generate SWF format files through its &quot;export&quot; function, it cannot open or edit them. Other than using Adobe products, one can build SWFs with open-source Motion-Twin ActionScript 2 Compiler (MTASC), the open-source Ming library and the free-software suite SWFTools. Various other third-party programs can also produce files in this format, such as Multimedia Fusion 2, Captivate and SWiSH Max.

The term &quot;SWF&quot; originated as an abbreviation for ShockWave Flash. This usage was changed to the backronym Small Web Format to eliminate confusion with a different technology, Shockwave, from which SWF derived. There is no official resolution to the initialism &quot;SWF&quot; by Adobe.

Adobe declared its Flash player EOL on December 31, 2020. On January 12, 2021, it pushed an update to its Flash player that blocked all Flash content from running. 

== History ==
The small company FutureWave Software originally defined the file format with one primary objective: to create small files for displaying entertaining animations.
The idea involved a format which player software could run on any system and which would work with slower network connections. FutureWave released FutureSplash Animator in May 1996. In December 1996 Macromedia acquired FutureWave and FutureSplash Animator became Macromedia Flash 1.0.

The original naming of SWF came out of Macromedia&#x27;s desire to capitalize on the well-known Macromedia Shockwave brand; Macromedia Director produced Shockwave files for the end user, so the files created by their newer Flash product tried to capitalize on the already established brand. As Flash became more popular than Shockwave itself, this branding decision became more of a liability, so the format started to be referred to as simply SWF.

Adobe acquired Macromedia in 2005.

On May 1, 2008, Adobe dropped its licensing restrictions on the SWF format specifications, as part of the Open Screen Project. However, Rob Savoye, a member of the Gnash development team, has pointed to some parts of the Flash format which remain closed. On July 1, 2008, Adobe released code to Google and Yahoo, which allowed their search engines to crawl and index SWF files.

== Description ==
The main graphical primitive in SWF is the path, which is a chain of segments of primitive types, ranging from lines to splines or Bézier curves. Additional primitives like rectangles, ellipses, and even text can be built from these. The graphical elements in SWF are thus fairly similar to SVG and MPEG-4 BIFS. SWF also uses display lists and allows naming and reusing previously defined components.

The binary stream format SWF uses is fairly similar to QuickTime atoms, with a tag, length and payload an organization that makes it very easy for (older) players to skip contents they don&#x27;t support.

Originally limited to presenting vector-based objects and images in a simple sequential manner, the format in its later versions allows audio (since Flash 3) and video (since Flash 6).

Adobe introduced a new, low-level 3D API in version 11 of the Flash Player. Initially codenamed Molehill, the official name given to this API was ultimately Stage3D. It was intended to be an equivalent of OpenGL or Direct3D. In Stage3D shaders are expressed in a low-level language called Adobe Graphics Assembly Language (AGAL).

== Adoption ==

Adobe makes available plugins, such as Adobe Flash Player and Adobe Integrated Runtime, to play SWF files in web browsers on many desktop operating systems, including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux on the x86 architecture and ARM architecture (ChromeOS only).

GNU has started developing a free software SWF player called Gnash under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Despite being a declared high-priority GNU project, funding for Gnash was fairly limited. Another player is the LGPL-licensed Swfdec. Lightspark is a continuation of Gnash supporting more recent SWF versions.

Adobe has incorporated SWF playback and authoring in other product and technologies of theirs, including in Adobe Shockwave, which renders more complex documents. SWF can also be embedded in PDF files; these are viewable with Adobe Reader 9 or later. InDesign CS6 can also produce some limited forms of SWF animations directly.

Sony PlayStation Portable consoles can play limited SWF files in Sony&#x27;s web browser, beginning with firmware version 2.71. Both the Nintendo Wii and the Sony PS3 consoles can run SWF files through their web browsers.

Scaleform GFx is a commercial alternative SWF player that features full hardware acceleration using the GPU and has high conformance up to Flash 8 and AS2. Scaleform GFx is licensed as a game middleware solution and used by many PC and console 3D games for user interfaces, HUDs, mini games, and video playback.

The newer 3D features of SWF have been seen as an alternative to WebGL, with a spurt of 3D engines like Papervision3D, Away3D, Sandy 3D, and Alternativa 3D targeting 3D SWF. Although some of these projects started around 2005, until Flash Player 10 however they had no support of GPU acceleration, and even in that version of the Flash Player, shaders could be used for same materials, but vertex information still had to be processed on the CPU (using BSP trees etc.) After version 11 of the Flash Player added the new Stage3D low-level API, some but not all of these projects migrated to the new API. One that did migrate was Away3D, version 4.

Based on an independent study conducted by Millward Brown and published by Adobe, in 2010, over 99% of desktop web browsers in the &quot;mature markets&quot; (defined as United States, Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand) had a SWF plugin installed, with around 90% having the latest version of the Flash Player.

Due to the increasing popularity of HTML5 for games and animations, as well as the numerous security holes that had plagued Adobe&#x27;s SWF player, Adobe declared its Flash player EOL on December 31, 2020. On January 12, 2021, it pushed an update to its Flash player that blocked all Flash content from running.

== Published specifications ==
Adobe makes available a partial specification of SWF, most recently updated in January 2013 to reflect changes in SWF version 19. SWF versions have been decoupled from Flash player versions after Flash 10. Afterwards the version number of the SWF progressed rapidly; SWF version 19 corresponds to the new features added in Flash Player 11.6. Flash Player 14 uses SWF version 25.

In 2008, the specifications document was criticized by Rob Savoye, the lead developer of the Gnash project, as missing &quot;huge amounts&quot; of information needed to completely implement SWF, omitting specifications for RTMP and Sorenson Spark. The RTMP specification was released publicly in June 2009. The Sorenson Spark codec is not Adobe&#x27;s property.

== Licensing ==
Until May 1, 2008, implementing software that plays SWF was disallowed by the specification&#x27;s license. On that date, as part of its Open Screen Project, Adobe dropped all such restrictions on the SWF and FLV formats.

Implementing software which creates SWF files has always been permitted, on the condition that the resulting files render &quot;error free in the latest publicly available version of Adobe Flash Player.&quot;

== Related file formats and extensions ==
Other formats related to SWF authoring in the Adobe tool chain remain without a public specification. One example is FLA, which is the editable version of SWF used by Adobe&#x27;s Flash, but not by other Adobe tools that can also output SWF, albeit with fewer features.

<text>Abul Kalam Ghulam Muhiyuddin (11 November 188822 February 1958) was an Indian politician, writer and activist of the Indian independence movement. A senior leader of the Indian National Congress, following India&#x27;s independence, he became the first Minister of Education in the Indian government. He is commonly remembered as Maulana Azad; the word Maulana is an honorific meaning &#x27;Our Master&#x27; and he had adopted &quot;Azad&quot; (&quot;Free&quot;) as his pen name. His contribution to establishing the education foundation in India is recognised by celebrating his birthday as National Education Day across India.

As a young man, Azad composed poetry in Urdu, as well as treatises on religion and philosophy. He rose to prominence through his work as a journalist, publishing works critical of the British Raj and espousing the causes of Indian nationalism. Azad became the leader of the Khilafat Movement, during which he came into close contact with the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi. After the failure of the Khilafat Movement, he became closer to the Congress. Azad became an enthusiastic supporter of Gandhi&#x27;s ideas of non-violent civil disobedience, and worked to organise the non-co-operation movement in protest of the 1919 Rowlatt Acts. Azad committed himself to Gandhi&#x27;s ideals, including promoting &quot;Swadeshi&quot; (indigenous) products and the cause of &quot;Swaraj&quot; (&quot;Self-rule&quot;) for India. In 1923, at an age of 35, he became the youngest person to serve as the President of the Indian National Congress.

In October 1920, Azad was elected as a member of foundation committee to establish Jamia Millia Islamia at Aligarh in U. P. without taking help from British colonial government. He assisted in shifting the campus of the university from Aligarh to New Delhi in 1934. The main gate (Gate No. 7) to the main campus of the university is named after him.

Azad was one of the main organizers of the Dharasana Satyagraha in 1931, and emerged as one of the most important national leaders of the time, prominently leading the causes of Hindu–Muslim unity as well as espousing secularism and socialism. He served as Congress president from 1940 to 1945, during which the &quot;Quit India&quot; rebellion was launched. Azad was imprisoned, together with the entire Congress leadership. He also worked for Hindu–Muslim unity through the &quot;Al-Hilal&quot; newspaper.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Azad was born on 11 November 1888 in Mecca, then a part of the Ottoman Empire, now a part of Saudi Arabia. His real name was Abul Kalam Ghulam Muhiyuddin, but he eventually became known as Maulana Abul Kalam Azad. Azad&#x27;s forefathers had come to India from Herat. His father was a Muslim scholar who lived in Delhi with his maternal grandfather, as his father had died at a very young age. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, he left India and settled in Mecca. His father Muhammad Khairuddin bin Ahmed Al Hussaini wrote twelve books, had thousands of disciples, and claimed noble ancestry, while his mother was Sheikha Alia bint Mohammad, the daughter of Sheikh Mohammad bin Zaher AlWatri, himself a reputed scholar from Medina who had a reputation that extended even outside of Arabia.

Azad settled in Calcutta with his family in 1890.

=== Education and influences ===
Azad was home-schooled and self-taught. Following fluency in Arabic as a first language, Azad began to master several other languages including Bengali, Hindustani, Persian, and English. He was also trained in the Madhabs of Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i and Hanbali fiqh, Shariat, mathematics, philosophy, world history, and science by tutors hired by his family. An avid and determined student, the precocious Azad was running a library, a reading room, and a debating society before he was twelve; wanted to write on the life of Al-Ghazali at twelve; was contributing learned articles to &quot;Makhzan&quot; (a literary magazine) at fourteen; was teaching a class of students, most of whom were twice his age, when he was fifteen; and completed the traditional course of study at the age of sixteen, nine years ahead of his contemporaries, and brought out a magazine at the same age. At the age of thirteen, he was married to a young Muslim girl, Zulaikha Begum. Azad compiled many treatises interpreting the Qur&#x27;an, the &quot;Hadis&quot;, and the principles of &quot;Fiqh&quot; and &quot;Kalam&quot;.

=== Early journalistic career ===
Azad began his journalistic endeavours at an early age. In 1899 at the age of eleven he started publishing a poetical journal &quot;Nairang-e-Aalam&quot; at Calcutta and was already an editor of a weekly &quot;Al-Misbah&quot; in 1900. He contributed articles to Urdu magazines and journals such as &quot;Makhzan&quot;, &quot;Ahsanul Akhbar&quot;, and &quot;Khadang e Nazar&quot;.

In 1903, he brought out a monthly journal, &quot;Lissan-us-Sidq&quot;. It was published between December 1903 to May 1905 until its closure due to shortage of funds. He then joined &quot;Al-Nadwa&quot;, the Islamic theological journal of the Nadwatu l-Ulama on Shibli Nomani&#x27;s invitation. He worked as editor of &quot;Vakil&quot;, a newspaper from Amritsar from April 1906 to November 1906. He shifted to Calcutta for a brief period where he was associated with &quot;Dar-ul-Saltunat&quot;. He returned to Amritsar after few months and resumed the editorship of Vakil, continuing to work there until July 1908.

=== Struggle for Indian Independence ===
In 1908, he took a trip of Egypt, Syria, Turkey and France where he came into contact with several revolutionaries such as followers of Kamal Mustafa Pasha, members of Young Turk Movement and Iranian revolutionaries. Azad developed political views considered radical for most Muslims of the time and became a full-fledged Indian nationalist. In his writing, Azad proved to be a fierce critic of both the British government and Muslim politicians; the former for its racial discrimination and refusal to provide for the needs of the Indian public, and the later for focusing on communal issues before matter of common-self interest (Azad pointedly rejected the All-India Muslim League&#x27;s communal separatism). However, his views changed considerably when he met ethnically oriented Sunni revolutionary activists in Iraq and was influenced by their fervent anti-imperialism and Arab nationalism. Against common Muslim opinion of the time, Azad opposed the partition of Bengal in 1905 and became increasingly active in revolutionary activities, to which he was introduced by the prominent Hindu revolutionaries Aurobindo Ghosh and Shyam Sundar Chakravarty. Azad initially evoked surprise from other revolutionaries, but Azad won their praise and confidence by working secretly to organise revolutionaries activities and meetings in Bengal, Bihar and Bombay (now called Mumbai).

==== Al-Hilal and Khilafat movement ====
He established an Urdu weekly newspaper in 1912 called &quot;Al-Hilal&quot; from Calcutta, and openly attacked British policies while exploring the challenges facing common people. Espousing the ideals of Indian nationalism, Azad&#x27;s publications were aimed at encouraging young Muslims into fighting for independence and Hindu-Muslim unity. With the onset of World War I, the British stiffened censorship and restrictions on political activity. Azad&#x27;s &quot;Al-Hilal&quot; was consequently banned in 1914 under the &quot;Press Act&quot;.

In 1913, he was founding member of the Anjuman-i-Ulama-i-Bangala, which would become the Jamiat Ulema-e-Bangala branch of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in 1921. His work helped improve the relationship between Hindus and Muslims in Bengal, which had been soured by the controversy surrounding the partition of Bengal and the issue of separate communal electorates.

In this period Azad also became active in his support for the Khilafat agitation to protect the position of the Sultan of Ottoman Turkey, who was considered the Caliph or Khalifa for Muslims worldwide. The Sultan had sided against the British in the war and the continuity of his rule came under serious threat, causing distress amongst Muslim conservatives. Azad saw an opportunity to energise Indian Muslims and achieve major political and social reform through the struggle.

Azad started a new journal, the &quot;Al-Balagh&quot;, which also got banned in 1916 under the &quot;Defence of India Regulations Act&quot; and he was arrested. The governments of the Bombay Presidency, United Provinces, Punjab and Delhi prohibited his entry into the provinces and Azad was moved to a jail in Ranchi, where he was incarcerated until 1 January 1920.

==== Non-co-operation Movement====
Upon his release, Azad returned to a political atmosphere charged with sentiments of outrage and rebellion against British rule. The Indian public had been angered by the passage of the Rowlatt Acts in 1919, which severely restricted civil liberties and individual rights. Consequently, thousands of political activists had been arrested and many publications banned. The killing of unarmed civilians at Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar on 13 April 1919 had provoked intense outrage all over India, alienating most Indians, including long-time British supporters, from the authorities. The Khilafat struggle had also peaked with the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I and the raging Turkish War of Independence, which had made the caliphate&#x27;s position precarious. India&#x27;s main political party, the Indian National Congress came under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, who had aroused excitement all over India when he led the farmers of Champaran and Kheda in a successful revolt against British authorities in 1918. Gandhi organised the people of the region and pioneered the art of &quot;Satyagraha&quot;— combining mass civil disobedience with complete non-violence and self-reliance.

Taking charge of the Congress, Gandhi also reached out to support the Khilafat struggle, helping to bridge Hindu-Muslim political divides. Azad and the Ali brothers – Maulana Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali – warmly welcomed Congress support and began working together on a programme of &quot;non-co-operation&quot; by asking all Indians to boycott British-run schools, colleges, courts, public services, the civil service, police and military. Non-violence and Hindu-Muslim unity were universally emphasised, while the boycott of foreign goods, especially clothes were organised. Azad joined the Congress and was also elected president of the All India Khilafat Committee. Although Azad and other leaders were soon arrested, the movement drew out millions of people in peaceful processions, strikes and protests.

This period marked a transformation in Azad&#x27;s own life. Along with fellow Khilafat leaders Mukhtar Ahmad Ansari, Hakim Ajmal Khan and others, Azad grew personally close to Gandhi and his philosophy. The three men founded the Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi as an institution of higher education managed entirely by Indians without any British support or control. Both Azad and Gandhi shared a deep passion for religion and Azad developed a close friendship with him. He adopted the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s ideas by living simply, rejecting material possessions and pleasures. Becoming deeply committed to &quot;ahimsa&quot; (&quot;non-violence&quot;) himself, Azad grew close to fellow nationalists like Jawaharlal Nehru, Chittaranjan Das and Subhas Chandra Bose. He strongly criticised the continuing suspicion of the Congress amongst the Muslim intellectuals from the Aligarh Muslim University and the Muslim League.

In 1921, he started the weekly &quot;Paigham&quot; which was also banned by December 1921. He along with the editor of &quot;Paigham&quot;, Abdul Razzak Mahilabadi was arrested by the government and sentenced to one year imprisonment.

During the course of 1922, both the Khilafat and the non cooperation movement suffered blow while Azad and other leaders like the Ali brothers were in jail. The movement had a sudden decline with rising incidences of violence; a nationalist mob killed 22 policemen in Chauri Chaura in 1922. Fearing degeneration into violence, Gandhi asked Indians to suspend the revolt and undertook a five-day fast to repent and encourage others to stop the rebellion. Although the movement stopped all over India, several Congress leaders and activists were disillusioned with Gandhi. By 1923, Ali brothers grew distant and critical of Gandhi and the Congress. Azad&#x27;s close friend Chittaranjan Das co-founded the Swaraj Party, breaking from Gandhi&#x27;s leadership. Despite the circumstances, Azad remained firmly committed to Gandhi&#x27;s ideals and leadership.

In 1923, he became the youngest man to be elected Congress president. Azad led efforts to organise the Flag Satyagraha in Nagpur. Azad served as president of the 1924 Unity Conference in Delhi, using his position to work to re-unite the Swarajists and the Khilafat leaders under the common banner of the Congress. In the years following the movement, Azad travelled across India, working extensively to promote Gandhi&#x27;s vision, education and social reform.

==== Congress leader ====
Azad served on the Congress Working Committee and in the offices of general secretary and president many times. The political environment in India re-energised in 1928 with nationalist outrage against the Simon Commission appointed to propose constitutional reforms. The commission included no Indian members and did not even consult Indian leaders and experts. In response, the Congress and other political parties appointed a commission under Motilal Nehru to propose constitutional reforms from Indian opinions. In 1928, Azad endorsed the Nehru Report, which was criticised by the Ali brothers and Muslim League politician Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Azad endorsed the ending of separate electorates based on religion, and called for an independent India to be committed to secularism. At the 1928 Congress session in Guwahati, Azad endorsed Gandhi&#x27;s call for dominion status for India within a year. If not granted, the Congress would adopt the goal of complete political independence for India. Despite his affinity for Gandhi, Azad also drew close to the young radical leaders Jawaharlal Nehru and Subhash Bose, who had criticised the delay in demanding full independence. Azad developed a close friendship with Nehru and began espousing socialism as the means to fight inequality, poverty and other national challenges. Azad decided the name of Muslim political party Majlis-e-Ahrar-ul-Islam. He was also a friend of Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari, founder of All India Majlis-e-Ahrar. When Gandhi embarked on the Dandi Salt March that inaugurated the Salt Satyagraha in 1930, Azad organised and led the nationalist raid, albeit non-violent on the Dharasana salt works to protest the salt tax and restriction of its production and sale. The biggest nationalist upheaval in a decade, Azad was imprisoned along with millions of people, and would frequently be jailed from 1930 to 1934 for long periods of time. Following the Gandhi–Irwin Pact in 1931, Azad was amongst millions of political prisoners released. When elections were called under the Government of India Act 1935, Azad was appointed to organise the Congress election campaign, raising funds, selecting candidates and organising volunteers and rallies across India. Azad had criticised the Act for including a high proportion of un-elected members in the central legislature, and did not himself contest a seat. He again declined to contest elections in 1937, and helped head the party&#x27;s efforts to organise elections and preserve co-ordination and unity amongst the Congress governments elected in different provinces.

At the 1936 Congress session in Lucknow, Azad was drawn into a dispute with Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr. Rajendra Prasad and C. Rajagopalachari regarding the espousal of socialism as the Congress goal. Azad had backed the election of Nehru as Congress president, and supported the resolution endorsing socialism. In doing so, he aligned with Congress socialists like Nehru, Subhash Bose and Jayaprakash Narayan. Azad also supported Nehru&#x27;s re-election in 1937, at the consternation of many conservative Congressmen. Azad supported dialogue with Jinnah and the Muslim League between 1935 and 1937 over a Congress-League coalition and broader political co-operation. Less inclined to brand the League as obstructive, Azad nevertheless joined the Congress&#x27;s vehement rejection of Jinnah&#x27;s demand that the League be seen exclusively as the representative of Indian Muslims.

==== Quit India Movement ====
In 1938, Azad served as an intermediary between the supporters of and the Congress faction led by Congress president Subhash Bose, who criticised Gandhi for not launching another rebellion against the British and sought to move the Congress away from Gandhi&#x27;s leadership. Azad stood by Gandhi with most other Congress leaders, but reluctantly endorsed the Congress&#x27;s exit from the assemblies in 1939 following the inclusion of India in World War II. Nationalists were infuriated that Viceroy Lord Linlithgow had entered India into the war without consulting national leaders. Although willing to support the British effort in return for independence, Azad sided with Gandhi when the British ignored the Congress overtures. Azad&#x27;s criticism of Jinnah and the League intensified as Jinnah called Congress rule in the provinces as &quot;Hindu Raj&quot;, calling the resignation of the Congress ministries as a &quot;Day of Deliverance&quot; for Muslims. Jinnah and the League&#x27;s separatist agenda was gaining popular support amongst Muslims. Muslim religious and political leaders criticised Azad as being too close to the Congress and placing politics before Muslim welfare. As the Muslim League adopted a resolution calling for a separate Muslim state (Pakistan) in its session in Lahore in 1940, Azad was elected Congress president in its session in Ramgarh. Speaking vehemently against Jinnah&#x27;s &quot;Two-Nation Theory&quot;—the notion that Hindus and Muslims were distinct nations—Azad lambasted religious separatism and exhorted all Muslims to preserve a united India, as all Hindus and Muslims were Indians who shared deep bonds of brotherhood and nationhood. In his presidential address, Azad said:


In face of increasing popular disenchantment with the British across India, Gandhi and Patel advocated an all-out rebellion demanding immediate independence. Azad was wary and sceptical of the idea, aware that India&#x27;s Muslims were increasingly looking to Jinnah and had supported the war. Feeling that a struggle would not force a British exit, Azad and Nehru warned that such a campaign would divide India and make the war situation even more precarious. Intensive and emotional debates took place between Azad, Nehru, Gandhi and Patel in the Congress Working Committee&#x27;s meetings in May and June 1942. In the end, Azad became convinced that decisive action in one form or another had to be taken, as the Congress had to provide leadership to India&#x27;s people and would lose its standing if it did not.

Supporting the call for the British to &quot;Quit India&quot;, Azad began exhorting thousands of people in rallies across the nation to prepare for a definitive, all-out struggle. As Congress president, Azad travelled across India and met with local and provincial Congress leaders and grass-roots activists, delivering speeches and planning the rebellion. Despite their previous differences, Azad worked closely with Patel and Dr. Rajendra Prasad to make the rebellion as effective as possible. On 7 August 1942 at the Gowalia Tank in Mumbai, Congress president Azad inaugurated the struggle with a vociferous speech exhorting Indians into action. Just two days later, the British arrested Azad and the entire Congress leadership. While Gandhi was incarcerated at the Aga Khan Palace in Pune, Azad and the Congress Working Committee were imprisoned at a fort in Ahmednagar, where they would remain under isolation and intense security for nearly four years. Outside news and communication had been largely prohibited and completely censored. Although frustrated at their incarceration and isolation, Azad and his companions attested to feeling a deep satisfaction at having done their duty to their country and people.

Azad occupied the time playing bridge and acting as the referee in tennis matches played by his colleagues. In the early mornings, Azad began working on his classic Urdu work, the &quot;Ghubhar-i-Khatir&quot;. Sharing daily chores, Azad also taught the Persian and Urdu languages, as well as Indian and world history to several of his companions. The leaders would generally avoid talking of politics, unwilling to cause any arguments that could exacerbate the pain of their imprisonment. However, each year on 26 January, which was then considered &quot;Poorna Swaraj&quot; (Complete Independence) Day, the leaders would gather to remember their cause and pray together. Azad, Nehru and Patel would briefly speak about the nation and the future. Azad and Nehru proposed an initiative to forge an agreement with the British in 1943. Arguing that the rebellion had been mistimed, Azad attempted to convince his colleagues that the Congress should agree to negotiate with the British and call for the suspension of disobedience if the British agreed to transfer power. Although his proposal was overwhelmingly rejected, Azad and a few others agreed that Gandhi and the Congress had not done enough. When they learnt of Gandhi holding talks with Jinnah in Mumbai in 1944, Azad criticised Gandhi&#x27;s move as counter-productive and ill-advised.

==== Partition of India ====

With the end of the war, the British agreed to transfer power to Indian hands. All political prisoners were released in 1946 and Azad led the Congress in the elections for the new Constituent Assembly of India, which would draft India&#x27;s constitution. He headed the delegation to negotiate with the British Cabinet Mission, in his sixth year as Congress president. While attacking Jinnah&#x27;s demand for Pakistan and the mission&#x27;s proposal of 16 June 1946 that envisaged the partition of India, Azad became a strong proponent of the mission&#x27;s earlier proposal of 16 May. The proposal advocated a federal system with a limited central government and autonomy for the provinces. The central government would have Defence, Foreign Affairs and Communication while the provinces would win all other subjects unless they voluntarily relinquished selected subjects to the Central Government. Additionally, the proposal called for the &quot;grouping&quot; of provinces on religious lines, which would informally band together the Muslim-majority provinces in the West as Group B, Muslim-majority provinces of Bengal and Assam as Group C and the rest of India as Group A. While Gandhi and others expressed scepticism of this clause, Azad argued that Jinnah&#x27;s demand for Pakistan would be buried and the concerns of the Muslim community would be assuaged. Under Azad and Patel&#x27;s backing, the Working Committee approved the resolution against Gandhi&#x27;s advice. Azad also managed to win Jinnah&#x27;s agreement to the proposal citing the greater good of all Indian Muslims.

Azad had been the Congress president since 1939, so he volunteered to resign in 1946. He nominated Nehru, who replaced him as Congress president and led the Congress into the interim government. Azad was appointed to head the Department of Education. However, Jinnah&#x27;s &quot;Direct Action Day&quot; agitation for Pakistan, launched on 16 August sparked communal violence across India. Thousands of people were killed as Azad travelled across Bengal and Bihar to calm the tensions and heal relations between Muslims and Hindus. Despite Azad&#x27;s call for Hindu-Muslim unity, Jinnah&#x27;s popularity amongst Muslims soared and the League entered a coalition with the Congress in December, but continued to boycott the constituent assembly. Later in his autobiography, Azad indicated Patel having become more pro-partition than the Muslim League, largely due to the League&#x27;s not co-operating with the Congress in the provisional government on any issue.

Azad had grown increasingly hostile to Jinnah, who had described him as the &quot;Muslim Lord Haw-Haw&quot; and a &quot;Congress Showboy.&quot; Muslim League politicians accused Azad of allowing Muslims to be culturally and politically dominated by the Hindu community. Azad continued to proclaim his faith in Hindu-Muslim unity:
Amidst more incidences of violence in early 1947, the Congress-League coalition struggled to function. The provinces of Bengal and Punjab were to be partitioned on religious lines, and on 3 June 1947 the British announced a proposal to partition India on religious lines, with the princely states free to choose between either dominion. The proposal was hotly debated in the All India Congress Committee, with Muslim leaders Saifuddin Kitchlew and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan expressing fierce opposition. Azad privately discussed the proposal with Gandhi, Patel and Nehru, but despite his opposition was unable to deny the popularity of the League and the unworkability of any coalition with the League. Faced with the serious possibility of a civil war, Azad abstained from voting on the resolution, remaining silent and not speaking throughout the AICC session, which ultimately approved the plan.

Azad, committed to a united India until his last attempt, was condemned by the advocates of Pakistan, especially the Muslim League.

=== Post-Independence career ===

India&#x27;s partition and independence on 15 August 1947 brought with it a scourge of violence that swept the Punjab, Bihar, Bengal, Delhi and many other parts of India. Millions of Hindus and Sikhs fled the newly created Pakistan for India, and millions of Muslims fled for West Pakistan and East Pakistan, created out of East Bengal. Violence claimed the lives of an estimated one million people, almost entirely in Punjab. Azad took up responsibility for the safety of Muslims in India, touring affected areas in Bengal, Bihar, Assam and the Punjab, guiding the organisation of refugee camps, supplies and security. Azad gave speeches to large crowds encouraging peace and calm in the border areas and encouraging Muslims across the country to remain in India and not fear for their safety and security. Focusing on bringing the capital of Delhi back to peace, Azad organised security and relief efforts, but was drawn into a dispute with the Deputy prime minister and Home Minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel when he demanded the dismissal of Delhi&#x27;s police commissioner, who was a Sikh accused by Muslims of overlooking attacks and neglecting their safety. Patel argued that the commissioner was not biased, and if his dismissal was forced it would provoke anger amongst Hindus and Sikhs and divide the city police. In Cabinet meetings and discussions with Gandhi, Patel and Azad clashed over security issues in Delhi and Punjab, as well as the allocation of resources for relief and rehabilitation. Patel opposed Azad and Nehru&#x27;s proposal to reserve the houses vacated by Muslims who had departed for Pakistan for Muslims in India displaced by the violence. Patel argued that a secular government could not offer preferential treatment for any religious community, while Azad remained anxious to assure the rehabilitation of Muslims in India, secularism, religious freedom and equality for all Indians. He supported provisions for Muslim citizens to make avail of Muslim personal law in courts.

Azad remained a close confidante, supporter and advisor to prime minister Nehru, and played an important role in framing national policies. Azad masterminded the creation of national programmes of school and college construction and spreading the enrolment of children and young adults into schools, to promote universal primary education. He was elected to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, the Lok Sabha in 1952 from Rampur Lok Sabha seat. In 1957 He re-contested Rampur and also dually contested the Gurgaon Lok Sabha seat in Punjab (modern-day Haryana), where he won on both seats. Gurgaon had a significant Muslim Meo population making it a safe seat for Azad. 

Azad supported Nehru&#x27;s socialist economic and industrial policies, as well as the advancing social rights and economic opportunities for women and underprivileged Indians. In 1956, he served as president of the UNESCO General Conference held in Delhi. Azad spent the final years of his life focusing on writing his book &quot;India Wins Freedom&quot;, an exhaustive account of India&#x27;s freedom struggle and its leaders. About 30 of the pages of this book were published about 30 years after Azad&#x27;s death in 1988 as per his own wish.

As India&#x27;s first Minister of Education, he emphasised on educating the rural poor and girls. As Chairman of the Central Advisory Board of Education, he gave thrust to adult literacy, universal primary education, free and compulsory for all children up to the age of 14, girl&#x27;s education, and diversification of secondary education and vocational training.
Addressing the conference on All India Education on 16 January 1948, Maulana Azad emphasised,
He oversaw the setting up of the Central Institute of Education, Delhi, which later became the Department of Education of the University of Delhi as &quot;a research centre for solving new educational problems of the country&quot;. Under his leadership, the Ministry of Education established the first Indian Institute of Technology in 1951 and the University Grants Commission in 1953., He also laid emphasis on the development of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore and the Faculty of Technology of the Delhi University. He foresaw a great future in the IITs for India:

== Literary works ==
Azad wrote many books including &quot;India Wins Freedom&quot;, &quot;Ghubar-e-Khatir&quot;, and &quot;Tazkirah Tarjumanul Quran&quot; (Urdu تذکرہ ترجمان القُران).

=== Ghubar-e-Khatir ===

Ghubar-e-Khatir (&quot;Sallies of Mind&quot;), () is one of the most important works of Azad, written primarily during 1942 to 1946 when he was imprisoned in Ahmednagar Fort in Maharashtra by British Raj while he was in Bombay (now Mumbai) to preside over the meeting of All India Congress Working Committee.

The book is basically a collection of 24 letters he wrote addressing his close friend Maulana Habibur Rahman Khan Sherwani. These letters were never sent to him because there was no permission for that during the imprisonment and after the release in 1946, he gave all these letters to his friend Ajmal Khan who let it published for the first time in 1946.

Although the book is a collection of letters but except one or two letters, all other letters are unique and most of the letters deal with complex issues such as existence of God, the origin of religions, the origin of music and its place in religion, etc.

The book is primarily an Urdu language book; however, there are over five hundred of couplets, mostly in Persian and Arabic languages. It is because, Maulana was born in a family where Arabic and Persian were used more frequently than Urdu. He was born in Mekkah, given formal education in Persian and Arabic languages but he was never taught Urdu.

It is often said that his book &quot;India Wins Freedom&quot; is about his political life and &quot;Ghubar-e-Khatir&quot; deals with his social and spiritual life.

== Legacy and influence ==
The Ministry of Minority Affairs of the central Government of India set up the Maulana Azad Education Foundation in 1989 on the occasion of his birth centenary to promote education amongst educationally backward sections of the Society. The Ministry also provides the Maulana Abul Kalam Azad National Fellowship, an integrated five-year fellowship in the form of financial assistance to students from minority communities to pursue higher studies such as M.Phil. and PhD In 1992 government of India honoured by giving posthumously Bharat Ratna.

Numerous institutions across India have also been named in his honour.

The National Education Day, an annual observance in India to commemorate the birth anniversary of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, the first education minister of independent India, who served from 15 August 1947 until his death on 22 February 1958. The National Education Day of India is celebrated on 11 November every year in India.

He is celebrated as one of the founders and greatest patrons of the Jamia Millia Islamia. Azad&#x27;s tomb is located next to the Jama Masjid in Delhi. In recent years great concern has been expressed by many in India over the poor maintenance of the tomb. On 16 November 2005 the Delhi High Court ordered that the tomb of Maulana Azad in New Delhi be renovated and restored as a major national monument. Azad&#x27;s tomb is a major landmark and receives large numbers of visitors annually.

Jawaharlal Nehru referred to him as &quot;Mir-i- Karawan&quot; (the caravan leader), &quot;a very brave and gallant gentleman, a finished product of the culture that, in these days, pertains to few&quot;. Mahatma Gandhi remarked about Azad by counting him as &quot;a person of the calibre of Plato, Aristotle and Pythagorus&quot;.

Azad was portrayed by actor Virendra Razdan in the 1982 biographical film, &quot;Gandhi&quot;, directed by Richard Attenborough.

A television series, &quot;Maulana Abul Kalam Azad&quot;, aired on DD National in the 1990s and starred Mangal Dhillon in the title role. DD Urdu aired &quot;Seher Hone Tak&quot;, a docudrama television series by Lavlin Thadani based on his life and political career, with Aamir Bashir portraying the role of Azad. It was later shortened and re-released as the film &quot;Aashiq-e-Vatan - Maulana Azad&quot;. &quot;Woh Jo Tha Ek Massiah Maulana Azad&quot;, a 2019 biographical film about Azad was directed by Rajendra Gupta Sanjay and Sanjay Singh Negi, with Linesh Fanse playing the title role.

His birthday, 11 November is celebrated as National Education Day in India.

<text>Bernard Howell Leach (5 January 1887 – 6 May 1979) was a British studio potter and art teacher. He is regarded as the &quot;Father of British studio pottery&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early years (Japan)===
Leach was born in Hong Kong. His mother Eleanor (née Sharp) died in childbirth. He spent his first three years in Japan with his father, Andrew Leach, until he moved back to Hong Kong in 1890.

Leach attended the Slade School of Fine Art and the London School of Art, where he studied etching under Frank Brangwyn. Reading books by Lafcadio Hearn, he became interested in Japan. In 1909 he returned to Japan with his young wife Muriel (née Hoyle) intending to teach etching. Satomi Ton, Kojima Kikuo, and later Ryūsei Kishida were his pupils.
In Tokyo, he gave talks and attended meetings along with Mushanokōji Saneatsu, Shiga Naoya, Yanagi Sōetsu and others from the &quot;Shirakaba-Group&quot;, who were trying to introduce western art to Japan after 250 years of seclusion.
About 1911 he attended a Raku-yaki pottery party which was his first introduction to ceramics, and through introduction by Ishii Hakutei, he began to study under Urano Shigekichi (1851–1923), who stood as &quot;Kenzan 6th&quot; in the tradition of potter Ogata Kenzan (1663–1743). Assisting as interpreter for technical terms was the potter Tomimoto Kenkichi, whom he had met already earlier. From this time Leach wrote articles for the Shirakaba.

In 1913 he also drafted covers for &quot;Shirakaba&quot; and &quot;Fyūzan&quot;. Attracted by the Prussian philosopher and art scholar Alfred Westharp, who at the time was living in Peking, Leach moved to Peking in 1915. There he took on the Name (for &quot;Leach&quot;), but returned the following year to Japan. It was the year 1919, when young Hamada Shōji visited Leach for the first time. Leach received a kiln from Kenzan and built it up in Yanagi&#x27;s garden and called it &quot;Tōmon-gama&quot;. Now established as a potter, he decided to move to England.

In 1920, before leaving, he had an exhibition in Osaka, where he met the potter Kawai Kanjirō. In Tokyo, a farewell exhibition was organized.

===Back in England===

Leach returned to England in 1920 on the invitation of Frances Horne. Horne was establishing a Guild of Handicrafts within the existing artist colony of St Ives in Cornwall. On the recommendation of a family friend, Edgar Skinner, she contacted Leach to suggest that he become the potter within this group. Leach and his wife Muriel were accompanied by the young Hamada Shoji and, having identified a suitable site next to the Stennack river on the outskirts of St Ives, the two established the Leach Pottery in 1920. They constructed a traditional Japanese climbing kiln or &#x27;Noborigama (登り窯)&#x27;, the first built in the West. The kiln was poorly built and was reconstructed in 1923 by Matsubayashi Tsurunosuke (1894-1932).

In 1934, Leach and Mark Tobey travelled together through France and Italy, then sailed from Naples to Hong Kong and Shanghai, where they parted company, Leach heading on to Japan.

Leach formally joined the Baháʼí Faith in 1940 after being introduced to it by Mark Tobey, who was himself a Baháʼí. A pilgrimage to the Baháʼí shrines in Haifa, Israel, during 1954 intensified his feeling that he should do more to unite the East and West by returning to the Orient &quot;to try more honestly to do my work there as a Baháʼí and as an artist...&quot;

Leach promoted pottery as a combination of Western and Eastern arts and philosophies. His work focused on traditional Korean, Japanese and Chinese pottery, in combination with traditional techniques from England and Germany, such as slipware and salt glaze ware. He saw pottery as a combination of art, philosophy, design and craft – even as a greater lifestyle. &quot;A Potter&#x27;s Book&quot; (1940) defined Leach&#x27;s craft philosophy and techniques; it went through many editions and was his breakthrough to recognition.

===Midlife===

Leach advocated simple and utilitarian forms. His ethical pots stand in opposition to what he called fine art pots, which promoted aesthetic concerns rather than function. Popularized in the 1940s after the publication of &quot;A Potter&#x27;s Book,&quot; his style had lasting influence on counter-culture and modern design in North America during the 1950s and 1960s. Leach&#x27;s pottery produced a range of &quot;standard ware&quot; handmade pottery for the general public. He continued to produce pots which were exhibited as works of art.

Many potters from all over the world were apprenticed at the Leach Pottery, and spread Leach&#x27;s style and beliefs. His British associates and trainees include Michael Cardew, Katherine Pleydell-Bouverie, David Leach (his son), Janet Darnell (whom Leach married in 1956) and William Marshall. Another of his students at St Ives was William Worrall who became chief craftsman at the Chalice Well crafts guild in Glastonbury and Muriel Bell, co-founder of the Lanchester Marionettes. His American apprentices include Warren MacKenzie (who likewise influenced many potters through his teaching at the University of Minnesota), Byron Temple. He was a major influence on New Zealand potter Len Castle who travelled to London to spend time working with him in the mid-1950s. Another apprentice was an Indian potter Nirmala Patwardhan who developed the so-called Nirmala glaze based on an 11th-century Chinese technique. His four Canadian apprentices, John Reeve, Glenn Lewis, Michael Henry and Ian Steele helped to shape the pottery scene in Vancouver and the Canadian west coast during the 1960 and 1970s. The Cypriot potter Valentinos Charalambous trained with Leach in 1950-51.

Leach was instrumental, with Muriel Rose, in organising the only International Conference of Potters and Weavers in July 1952 at Dartington Hall, where he had been working and teaching. It included exhibitions of British pottery and textiles since 1920, Mexican folk art, and works by conference participants, among them Shoji Hamada and US-based Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain. Another important contributor was Japanese aesthetician Soetsu Yanagi, author of &quot;The Unknown Craftsman&quot;. According to Brent Johnson, &quot;The most important outcome of the conference was that it helped organize the modern studio pottery movement by giving a voice to the people who became its leaders...it gave them [Leach, Hamada and Yanagi] celebrity status...[while] Marguerite Wildenhain emerged from Dartington Hall as the most important craft potter in America.&quot; He was an active member of the Red Rose Guild.

===Later years===

Leach continued to produce work until 1972 and never ended his passion for travelling. He continued to write about ceramics even after losing his eyesight.

The Victoria and Albert Museum in London held a major exhibition of his art in 1977.

The Leach Pottery remains in operation, accompanied by a museum displaying many pieces by Leach and his students.

==Edmund de Waal&#x27;s book==
Edmund de Waal, British ceramic artist and writer, was apprenticed to the potter Geoffrey Whiting, a disciple of Leach, at the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury in the early 1980&#x27;s. He has said that to move on, he had to address Leach directly. &quot;It&#x27;s anxiety of influence – you choose which father to kill, and in my case it was Leach.&quot; He researched Leach&#x27;s papers and journals in the archive room of the Japanese Folk Crafts Museum.

De Waal&#x27;s book, the first critical monograph on Leach, was published in 1998. He described it as &quot;the first &#x27;de-mystifying&#x27; study of Leach&quot;, writing in the last chapter: &quot;In the West, Leach has been seen as &#x27;a natural child of the East&#x27;, someone who &#x27;understood&#x27; Japan by birthright and in an almost mystical way. In the East, he has been credited with seeing deeper into the culture of Japan than any Westerner since Lafcadio Hearn&quot;.

Studying the circumstances of his grounding in Japanese culture, he pointed out that Leach could &quot;barely speak&quot; Japanese at the time of his training with Kenzan VI. De Waal also notes that poetry used in the tradition of Kenzan I would not be legible to Leach, who would straightforwardly say that he could not read Japanese texts. Leach did learn to speak the language to a conversational standard, however; recordings of this are held by the Mingei Film Archive and the Crafts Study Centre, Farnham. The book acknowledges Leach&#x27;s strength as an artist, his sophisticated mark-making and sensitivity to the surface qualities of the clay, while providing an examination of the Orientalism in his thinking and making.

<text>Earl of Avon was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1961 for the former Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden, together with the subsidiary title Viscount Eden, of Royal Leamington Spa in the County of Warwick, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The titles became extinct on the death of his only surviving son Nicholas, the second Earl, in 1985.

Eden was a member of the prominent Eden family. He was the third son of Sir William Eden, 7th Baronet, of West Auckland, and 5th Baronet, of Maryland. Eden&#x27;s nephew was fellow Conservative politician John Benedict Eden, Baron Eden of Winton. Eden&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Sir Robert Eden, 1st Baronet, of Maryland, was the elder brother of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland, and Morton Eden, 1st Baron Henley.

<doc id="676940" wikidata="Q10749897" url="?curid=676940" title="Ancient Hawaii">
<text>Ancient Hawaii is the period of Hawaiian history preceding the establishment in 1795 of the Kingdom of Hawaii by Kamehameha the Great. Traditionally, researchers estimated the first settlement of the Hawaiian islands as having occurred sporadically between 400 and 1100 CE by Polynesian long-distance navigators from the Samoan, Marquesas, and Tahiti islands within what is now French Polynesia. In 2010, a study was published based on radiocarbon dating of more reliable samples which suggests that the islands were settled much later, within a short timeframe, in about 1219 to 1266.

The islands in Eastern Polynesia have been characterized by the continuities among their cultures, and the short migration period would be an explanation of this result. Diversified agroforestry and aquaculture provided sustenance for Native Hawaiian cuisine. Tropical materials were adopted for housing. Elaborate temples (called &quot;heiau&quot;) were constructed from the lava rocks available.

The rich natural resources supported a relatively dense population, organized by a ruling class and social system with religious leaders. Captain James Cook made the first known European contact with ancient Hawaiians in 1778. He was followed by many other Europeans and Americans.

==Voyage to the Hawaiian islands==

There have been changing views about initial Polynesian discovery and settlement of Hawai&#x27;i. Radiocarbon dating in Hawai&#x27;i initially indicated a possible settlement as early as 124 CE. Patrick Vinton Kirch&#x27;s early books on Hawaiian archeology date the first Polynesian settlements to about 300 CE with more recent suggestions by Kirch of 600 CE. Other theories suggest dating as late as 700–800 CE.

In 2010, researchers announced new findings using revised, high-precision radiocarbon dating based on more reliable samples than were previously used in many dating studies. This new data indicates that the period of eastern and northern Polynesian colonization took place much later, in a shorter time frame of two waves: the &quot;earliest in the Society Islands c. 1025–1120, four centuries later than previously assumed; then after 70–265 years, dispersal continued in one major pulse to all remaining islands c. 1190–1290.&quot; According to this research, settlement of the Hawaiian Islands took place c. 1219–1266. This rapid colonization is believed to account for the &quot;remarkable uniformity of East Polynesia culture, biology and language&quot;.

According to Hawaiian mythology, there were other settlers in Hawaii: peoples who were forced back into remote valleys by newer arrivals. They claim that stories about &quot;menehune&quot;, little people who built &quot;heiau&quot; and fishponds, prove the existence of ancient peoples who settled the islands before the Hawaiians.

== Early Hawaiian sites ==

=== Waiʻahukini Rockshelter (Site H8) ===
The Wai&#x27;ahukini Rockshelter, site H8, lies within a lava tube about 600 feet inland from the shore on the southern part of the island of Hawai&#x27;i. Based on the lack of light and space necessary for normal living conditions, it was unlikely that site H8 was used as a dwelling. Excavations of site H8 began in 1954 by William J. Bonk and students from the University of Hawaii, Hilo, and concluded in 1958. Excavation of the site revealed eight fireplaces at varying depths, as well as 1671 artifacts which included faunal remains, fishhooks, and lithic materials made of basalt and volcanic glass. The distribution of artifacts in site H8 indicated that it was continuously used as a fishing shelter until the eruption of Mauna Loa in 1868. An early estimation of the site&#x27;s initial occupation was A.D. 750 by Emory and Sinoto in 1969, but a more recent study using updated radiocarbon dating methods suggested a much later date, somewhere within the mid-14th century.

=== Hālawa Dune Site ===
Located on the island of Moloka&#x27;i, the Hālawa Dune Site was first discovered in 1964 and consists of two mounds. In the summer of 1970, Patrick Vinton Kirch performed excavations on the larger of the two mounds, Mound B, revealing six major layers. Within the fourth layer were artifacts, faunal remains, and house foundations. Of the 496 artifacts unearthed in this layer, the most significant included fishhooks and adzes. The adzes recovered from Mound B were similar to those found in Nihoa and the Necker Islands and, according to Kirch and McCoy, served as &quot;evidence that the Hālawa Dune Site represented an early phase in the development of Hawaiian material culture.&quot; Initial radiocarbon dating for the site by Kirch suggested a range of 600 to 1200 CE, however a re-dating of samples in 2007 showed the site dated no earlier than 1300 CE, and was occupied primarily between 1400 and 1650 CE.

==Settlement==
Early settlers brought along with them clothing, plants (called &quot;canoe plants&quot;) and livestock and established settlements along the coasts and larger valleys. Upon their arrival, the settlers grew (taro), (banana), (coconut), (breadfruit), and raised (pork), (chicken), and (poi dog), although these meats were eaten less often than fruits, vegetables, and seafood. Popular condiments included (salt), ground kukui nut, (seaweed), and (sugarcane) which was used as both a sweet and a medicine. In addition to the foods they brought, the settlers also acquired (sweet potato), which began to be cultivated across Polynesia around the year 1000 or earlier, with the earliest evidence of cultivation in Hawaii around 1300. The sweet potato is native to South America. Recently, an analysis of the DNA of 1,245 sweet potato varieties from Asia and the Americas was done, and researchers found a genetic link that proves the root made it to Polynesia from the Andes around 1100. The findings, published in the &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences&quot;, offer more evidence that ancient Polynesians may have interacted with people in South America long before the Europeans set foot on the continent.

The Pacific rat accompanied humans on their journey to Hawaiʻi. David Burney argues that humans, along with the vertebrate animals they brought with them (pigs, dogs, chickens and rats), caused many native species of birds, plants and large land snails to become extinct in the process of colonization.

Estuaries and streams were adapted into fishponds by early Polynesian settlers, as long ago as 500 CE or earlier. Packed earth and cut stone were used to create habitat, making ancient Hawaiian aquaculture among the most advanced of the original peoples of the Pacific. A notable example is the Menehune Fishpond dating from at least 1,000 years ago, at Alekoko (Kaua&#x27;i). At the time of Captain James Cook&#x27;s arrival, there were at least 360 fishponds producing of fish per year. Over the course of the last millennium, Hawaiians undertook &quot;large-scale canal-fed pond field irrigation&quot; projects for (taro) cultivation.

The new settlers built (homes) and (temples). Archaeologists currently believe that the first settlements were on the southern end of the Big Island of Hawaiʻi and that they quickly extended northwards, along the seacoasts and the easily accessible river valleys. As the population increased, settlements were made further inland. With the islands being so small, the population was very dense. Before European contact, the population had reached somewhere in the range of 200,000 to 1,000,000 people. After contact with the Europeans, however, the population steeply dropped due to various diseases including smallpox.

==Village==

A traditional town of ancient Hawaii included several structures. Listed in order of importance:
* Heiau, temple to the gods. There were two major types. The agricultural &quot;mapele&quot; type was dedicated to Lono, and could be built by the nobility, priests, and land division chiefs, and whose ceremonies were open to all. The second type, luakini, were large war temples, where animal and human sacrifices were made. They were built on high-rising stone terraces and adorned with wood and stone carved idols. A source of great &quot;mana&quot; or divine power, the luakini could only be entered by &quot;alii&quot;, the king, important chiefs and nobility, and &quot;kahuna&quot; who were members of the Kū priesthood.
* Hale alii, the house of the chief. It was used as a residence for the high chief and meeting house of the lesser chiefs. It was always built on a raised stone foundation to represent high social standing. &quot;Kāhili&quot;, or feather standards, were placed outside to signify royalty. Women and children were banned from entering.
* Hale pahu, the house of the sacred hula instruments. It held the &quot;pahu&quot; drums. It was treated as a religious space as hula was a religious activity in honor of the goddess &quot;Laka&quot;.
* Hale papaa, the house of royal storage. It was built to store royal implements including fabrics, prized nets and lines, clubs, spears and other weapons.
* Hale ulana, the house of the weaver. It was the house where craftswomen would gather each day to manufacture the village baskets, fans, mats and other implements from dried pandanus leaves called &quot;lauhala&quot;.
* Hale mua, the men&#x27;s eating house. It was considered a sacred place because it was used to carve stone idols of &quot;aumakua&quot; or ancestral gods. The design was meant for the men to be able to enter and exit quickly.
* Hale aina, the women&#x27;s eating house. Women ate at their own separate eating house. Men and women could not eat with each other for fear that men were vulnerable while eating to have their &quot;mana&quot;, or divine spirit, stolen by women.
* Hale waa, the house of the canoe. It was built along the beaches as a shelter for their fishing vessels. Hawaiians also stored koa logs used to craft the canoes.
* Hale lawaia, the house of fishing. It was built along the beaches as a shelter for their fishing nets and lines. Nets and lines were made by a tough rope fashioned from woven coconut husks. Fish hooks were made of human, pig or dog bone. Implements found in the &quot;hale lawaia&quot; were some of the most prized possessions of the entire village.
* Hale noho, the living house. It was built as sleeping and living quarters for the Hawaiian family unit.
* Imu, the communal earth oven. Dug in the ground, it was used to cook the entire village&#x27;s food including &quot;puaa&quot; or pork. Only men cooked using the &quot;imu&quot;.

==Caste system==
Ancient Hawaii was a caste society developed from ancestral Polynesians. In &quot;The overthrow of the kapu system in Hawaii&quot;, Stephenie Seto Levin describes the main classes:
* Alii. This class consisted of the high and lesser chiefs of the realms. They governed with divine power () within a sometimes theocratic system.
* Kahuna. Priests who conducted religious ceremonies, at the and elsewhere. Professionals included master carpenters and boatbuilders, chanters, dancers, genealogists, physicians and healers.
* Makaāinana. Commoners who farmed, fished, and exercised the simpler crafts. They labored not only for themselves and their families, but to support the chiefs and .
* Kauwā. A broad and degrading category of servants, slaves, and outcasts. Marriage between higher castes and the was strictly forbidden. The worked for the chiefs, and males were often used as human sacrifices (via drowning) at the &quot;luakini heiau&quot;. (Lawbreakers of other castes and defeated political opponents were also sometimes used in human sacrifices.)

==Education==
Hawaiian youth learned life skills and religion at home, often with grandparents. For &quot;bright&quot; children a system of apprenticeship existed in which very young students would begin learning a craft or profession by assisting an expert, or &quot;kahuna&quot;. As spiritual powers were perceived by Hawaiians to imbue all of nature, experts in many fields of work were known as &quot;kahuna&quot;, a term commonly understood to mean &quot;priest&quot;. The various types of &quot;kahuna&quot; passed on knowledge of their profession, be it in &quot;genealogies, or &quot;mele&quot;, or herb medicine, or canoe building, or land boundaries&quot;, etc. by involving and instructing apprentices in their work. More formal schools existed for the study of &quot;hula&quot;, and likely for the study of higher levels of sacred knowledge.

The &quot;kahuna&quot; took the apprentice into his household as a member of the family, although often &quot;the tutor was a relative&quot;. During a religious &quot;graduation&quot; ceremony, &quot;the teacher consecrated the pupil, who thereafter was one with the teacher in psychic relationship as definite and obligatory as blood relationship&quot;. Like the children learning from their grandparents, children who were apprentices learned by watching and participating in daily life. Children were discouraged from asking questions in traditional Hawaiian culture.

==Land tenure==
In Hawaiian ideology, one does not &quot;own&quot; the land, but merely dwells on it. The belief was that both the land and the gods were immortal. This then informed the belief that land was also godly, and therefore above mortal and ungodly humans, and humans therefore could not own land. The Hawaiians thought that all land belonged to the gods (&quot;akua&quot;).

The &quot;alii&quot; were believed to be &quot;managers&quot; of land. That is, they controlled those who worked on the land, the &quot;makaāinana&quot;.
On the death of one chief and the accession of another, lands were re-apportioned—some of the previous &quot;managers&quot; would lose their lands, and others would gain them. Lands were also re-apportioned when one chief defeated another and re-distributed the conquered lands as rewards to his warriors. 

In practice, commoners had some security against capricious re-possession of their houses and farms. They were usually left in place, to pay tribute and supply labor to a new chief, under the supervision of a new &quot;konohiki&quot;, or overseer. 

This system of land tenure has similarities with the feudal system prevalent in Europe during the Middle Ages. 

The ancient Hawaiians had the &quot;ahupuaa&quot; as their source of water management. Each &quot;ahupuaa&quot; was a sub-division of land from the mountain to the sea. The Hawaiians used the water from the rain that ran through the mountains as a form of irrigation. Hawaiians also settled around these parts of the land because of the farming that was done.

== Religion and the &quot;kapu&quot; system ==

Religion held ancient Hawaiian society together, affecting habits, lifestyles, work methods, social policy and law. The legal system was based on religious &quot;kapu&quot;, or taboos. There was a correct way to live, to worship, and even to eat. Examples of &quot;kapu&quot; included the provision that men and women could not eat together (Aikapu religion). Fishing was limited to specified seasons of the year. The shadow of the &quot;alii&quot; must not be touched as it was stealing his &quot;mana&quot;.

The rigidity of the &quot;kapu&quot; system might have come from a second wave of migrations in 1000–1300 from which different religions and systems were shared between Hawaii and the Society Islands. Had Hawaii been influenced by the Tahitian chiefs, the &quot;kapu&quot; system would have become stricter, and the social structure would have changed. Human sacrifice would have become a part of their new religious observance, and the &quot;alii&quot; would have gained more power over the counsel of experts on the islands.

&quot;Kapu&quot; was derived from traditions and beliefs from Hawaiian worship of gods, demigods and ancestral &quot;mana&quot;. The forces of nature were personified as the main gods of Kū (God of war), Kāne (god of light and life), Kanaloa (god of death), and Lono (god of peace and growth). Well-known lesser gods include Pele (goddess of fire) and her sister Hiiaka (goddess of dance). In a famous creation story, the demigod Māui fished the islands of Hawaii from the sea after a little mistake he made on a fishing trip. From Haleakalā, Māui ensnared the sun in another story, forcing him to slow down so there were equal periods of darkness and light each day.

The Hawaiian mystical worldview allows for different gods and spirits to imbue any aspect of the natural world. From this mystical perspective, in addition to his presence in lightning and rainbows, the god of light and life, Kāne, can be present in rain and clouds and a peaceful breeze (typically the &quot;home&quot; of Lono).

Although all food and drink had religious significance to the ancient Hawaiians, special cultural emphasis was placed on &quot;awa&quot; (&quot;kava&quot;) due to its narcotic properties. This root-based beverage, a psychoactive and a relaxant, was used to consecrate meals and commemorate ceremonies. It is often referred to in Hawaiian chant. Different varieties of the root were used by different castes, and the brew served as an &quot;introduction to mysticism&quot;.

==Chiefs==
The four biggest islands, the island of Hawaiʻi, Maui, Kauaʻi and Oʻahu were generally ruled by their own &quot;aliʻi nui&quot; (supreme ruler) with lower ranking subordinate chiefs called &quot;aliʻi ʻaimoku&quot;, ruling individual districts with land agents called &quot;konohiki&quot;.

All these dynasties were interrelated and regarded all the Hawaiian people (and possibly all humans) as descendants of legendary parents, Wākea (symbolizing the air) and his wife Papa (symbolizing the earth). Up to the late eighteenth century, the island of Hawaiʻi had been ruled by one line descended from Umi-a-Liloa. At the death of Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku, a lower ranking chief, Alapainui, overthrew the two sons of the former ruler who were next in line as the island&#x27;s &quot;aliʻi nui&quot;.

Assuming five to ten generations per century, the &quot;Alii ʻAimoku&quot; dynasties were around three to six centuries old at 1800 CE. The Tahitian settlement of the Hawaiian islands is believed to have taken place in the thirteenth century. The &quot;alii&quot; and other social castes were presumably established during this period.

==First recorded European contact==
By chance in January 1778, British Captain James Cook encountered the Hawaiian Islands while crossing the Pacific during his third voyage of exploration. He landed first on Kauai, then Niʻihau before leaving the vicinity to continue his mission to explore the Pacific coast of North America. 

Cook&#x27;s two ships returned to the islands in November to re-supply, first sailing along the coast of Maui before eventually reaching
an anchorage at Kealakekua Bay on Hawaii island. Some Hawaiians believed Cook was a sign from their god Lono. Cook&#x27;s mast and sails coincidentally resembled the emblem (a mast and sheet of white &quot;kapa&quot;) that symbolized Lono in their religious rituals; the ships arrived during the &quot;Makahiki&quot; season dedicated to peace. Later, Cook was killed during a violent confrontation and left behind on the beach by his retreating sailors. The British demanded that his body be returned, but the Hawaiians had already performed funerary rituals of their tradition. 

This first European contact with the Hawaiian islands marked the beginning of the end of the Ancient Hawaii period. After Cook&#x27;s visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian Islands attracted European and American explorers, traders, and whalers, who found the islands to be a convenient harbor and source of supplies. Within a few decades Kamehameha I used European warfare tactics and some firearms and cannons to unite the islands into the Kingdom of Hawaii.

<text>Madden NFL 2004 is the 15th installment of the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series of American football video games. Former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick is on the cover.

==Gameplay==
New features in &quot;Madden 2004&quot; include a new owner mode option that allows the player to control a franchise. In this mode, the player takes on all the responsibilities related to owning a professional football team, from regulating hot dog prices, to team relocation, to hiring and firing coaching staff. Another new feature is the ability to edit a historic team. Also, a new training camp mode, occurring before the preseason, that can help player progress faster by putting him through mini-camp drills.

This Madden game is best known for its version of then-Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, an arguably overpowered character and by acclaim the greatest Madden player of all-time due to his 95 speed rating. In 2016, developer Clint Oldenburg told Gameradar that over the next several years &quot;features were added to the game specifically to stop Vick.&quot; The 04 version of Vick has been used in Madden NFL 25 and 15 in Ultimate Team mode as a 99 overall with either 99 or 100 speed.

The game is an EA Sports Bio game, and is compatible with other EA Sports games with the feature (&quot;NCAA Football 2004&quot;, &quot;NASCAR Thunder 2004&quot;).

The soundtrack of the game features various hip hop and rock songs.

==Development==
The game had a marketing budget of $8.6 million.

==Reception==
Upon release, the game sold over copies in three weeks. By July 2006, the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot; had sold 3.5 million copies and earned $170 million in the United States alone. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the fourth highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Between those dates, 22 million copies of the &quot;Madden&quot; series were sold in the United States, of which &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;″s PlayStation 2 version had the highest share.

Based on the platform, &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;‘s ratings ranged from universal acclaim to average reviews. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 91.77% and 94 out of 100 for the PlayStation 2 version; 91.54% and 94 out of 100 for the GameCube version; 89.24% and 92 out of 100 for the Xbox version; 88.40% and 91 out of 100 for the PC version; 80% and 80 out of 100 for the PlayStation version; and 74.60% and 70 out of 100 for the Game Boy Advance version.

&quot;Playboy&quot; gave the game a score of 100%, stating: &quot;Looking for more depth? Take the owner&#x27;s seat and relocate your team, set concession stand prices in your new stadium and hire your coaching staff. Ditka: Send us your resume.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave it an A and praised the Owner Mode, &quot;which lets you negotiate salaries, build a stadium, and - for the detail obsessed - even set prices at the concession stands.&quot; &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave it a score of four-and-a-half stars out of five and stated, &quot;Because of its tight game-play, depth and dizzying amount of features, Madden is still the one to beat.&quot;

&quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot; was named &quot;Game of the Year&quot; at the 2003 Spike TV Video Game Awards; it was also named Editor&#x27;s and Reader&#x27;s Choice &quot;Sports Game of the Year in 2003&quot; on GameCube and PlayStation 2 from IGN. &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot; also won &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2003 &quot;Best Sports Game for PC&quot; and &quot;Best Console Sports Game&quot; awards, as well as winning &quot;Computer Sports Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Sports Simulation Game of the Year&quot; during the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

<text>Drayton Park is a National Rail station in Highbury, in the London Borough of Islington. It is on the Northern City Line between Highbury &amp; Islington and Finsbury Park stations, down the line from ; it is in Travelcard Zone 2.

The station is operated by Great Northern. It is just off the Holloway Road near its southern end, close to the Liverpool Road junction. It stands in the shadow of Arsenal football club&#x27;s Emirates Stadium, but is shut prior to weekend matches and after all matches due to safety concerns of hosting fans on the station&#x27;s narrow island platform.

==History==

Drayton Park was opened by the Great Northern &amp; City Railway (GN&amp;CR) on 14 February 1904. The GN&amp;CR was constructed to provide a route for Great Northern Railway (GNR) trains between the GNR station at Finsbury Park and the Metropolitan Railway (MR) and City &amp; South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) station at Moorgate in the City of London. With the exception of Drayton Park station and the former depot which are in a deep cutting, the railway was constructed in deep tube tunnel. The tunnels were constructed with a larger diameter than the other deep-tube railways to accommodate GNR main-line trains, but a dispute between the two companies prevented the GN&amp;CR connecting its tunnels to the GNR platforms at Finsbury Park. The GN&amp;CR tunnels instead terminated beneath Finsbury Park main-line station without a running connection to the surface, rolling stock accessing the line via a yard connection at Finsbury Park.

In 1913 the GN&amp;CR was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway (MR). The MR ran the line under its own name until it became part of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) in 1933. In preparation for the LPTB&#x27;s &quot;Northern Heights&quot; plan the line was transferred to the control of the Morden-Edgware Line (now the Northern line).

===Northern heights plan===
The Northern Heights plan involved the construction of the GN&amp;CR&#x27;s unbuilt connection from Drayton Park to the surface platforms at Finsbury Park and the transfer of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) branches from there to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace. By 1939 much of the work for the connection of the lines had been done, including the ramps needed to take the tracks from Drayton Park up to Finsbury Park, and the opening of the connection was scheduled for autumn 1940, but World War II put a halt to further construction.

After the war the plan to incorporate the Alexandra Palace branch into the Underground was cancelled and the branch closed to passengers in the 1950s. No further effort was made to connect the City Line to the main-line platforms (owned after the 1948 nationalisation by British Railways) and Northern line tube trains continued to run in tunnel to Finsbury Park.

===Truncation of the line and transfer to British Rail===
Although the Victoria line does not serve Drayton Park, its construction during the 1960s had a significant impact on the station. The City Line tunnels north of Drayton Park were closed on 3 October 1964 and were reused by the Victoria line, which was connected to them south of Finsbury Park. Drayton Park became the northern terminus of the City line, which later became known as the Northern line Highbury Branch.

On 4 October 1975 the line was closed and ceased to be part of the London Underground. The line was transferred to British Rail (BR) and the unused ramps from the cancelled Northern Heights plan finally received the tracks to connect the line to the surface platforms at Finsbury Park. On 8 August 1976 Drayton Park reopened as part of the BR network, with main-line-sized trains running to Old Street. On 8 November 1976, the line was opened for main-line trains from Moorgate to Finsbury Park and beyond, 72 years after the GN&amp;CR opened, as had been originally intended. 

Following the transfer of the line from London Transport to British Rail, the tube train car sheds at Drayton Park became redundant. The track in the sheds and outside in the yard had only been used by slow-moving empty tube trains, so was in very good condition. It was purchased by the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales. The job of lifting and loading it onto a bogie flat wagon fell to volunteers of the London Area Group of the Ffestiniog Railway Society. This was accomplished over about three weekends in June 1977.

Trains on the line have dual power pick-up equipment. In the tunnel section trains use a third rail, and above ground they use overhead line equipment via pantographs. Trains change between the two methods at Drayton Park and the transition may be noticeable as sparks or momentary power blackouts.

==Services==
All services at Drayton Park are operated by Great Northern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to 

During the peak hours, the station is served by an additional half-hourly service between Moorgate and Hertford North and the service between Moorgate and Welwyn Garden City is increased to 4 tph.

Great Northern introduced a weekend and late evening service from 13 December 2015, as part of their franchise requirements.

<text>Baula () is a mountain situated in the west of Iceland near Route 1, Bifröst University, and the craters of Grábrók. The mountain&#x27;s reddish or orange hue is caused by its rhyolite rock composition.

Geologically, the mountain is a laccolith, a type of igneous intrusion. It was formed 3.4 million years ago.

Baula is characterized by its almost perfect cone. Nearby is Baula&#x27;s “little sister,” a mountain called Litla-Baula, where rare columns of rhyolite are found. Together, Baula and Litla-Baula have often been described as Iceland&#x27;s most beautiful pair of mountains.

<text>The office of Minister-President (), or Prime Minister, of Prussia existed from 1848, when it was formed by King Frederick William IV during the 1848–49 Revolution, until the abolition of Prussia in 1947 by the Allied Control Council.

==History of the office==
Under the Kingdom of Prussia the Minister President functioned as the chief minister of the King, and presided over the Landtag (the Prussian legislature established in 1848). After the unification of Germany in 1871 and until the 1918–1919 Revolution, the office of the Prussian Minister President was usually held by the Chancellor of the German Empire, beginning with the tenure of Otto von Bismarck.

Under the Free State of Prussia the Minister President was the head of the state government in a more traditional parliamentary role during the Weimar Republic. The office ceased to have any real meaning except as a kind of political patronage title after the takeover by the national government in 1932 (&quot;Preußenschlag&quot;), and after Nazi Germany dismantled Prussia as a state in 1935 (&quot;Reichsstatthaltergesetz&quot;). Eventually, the office was abolished along with Prussia itself by the Allies in the aftermath of World War II.

<doc id="677000" wikidata="Q504703" url="?curid=677000" title="Seminar">
<text>A seminar is a form of academic instruction, either at an academic institution or offered by a commercial or professional organization. It has the function of bringing together small groups for recurring meetings, focusing each time on some particular subject, in which everyone present is requested to participate. This is often accomplished through an ongoing Socratic dialogue with a seminar leader or instructor, or through a more formal presentation of research. It is essentially a place where assigned readings are discussed, questions can be raised and debates can be conducted.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;seminar&quot; was borrowed from German (in which it is capitalized as ), and is ultimately derived from the Latin word , meaning &#x27;seed plot&#x27; (an old-fashioned term for &#x27;seedbed&#x27;). Its root word is (Latin for &#x27;seed&#x27;).

==Overview==

The term &quot;seminar&quot; is also used to describe a research talk, often given by a visiting researcher and primarily attended by academics, research staff, and postgraduate students. Seminars often occur in regular series, but each seminar is typically given by a different speaker, on a topic of that speaker&#x27;s choosing. Such seminars are not usually a part of a course of study and are therefore not usually associated with any assessment or credit.

In some European universities, a &quot;seminar&quot; may be a large lecture course, especially when conducted by a renowned thinker (regardless of the size of the audience or the scope of student participation in discussion). Some non-English speaking countries in Europe use the word &quot;seminar&quot; (e.g. German &quot;Seminar&quot;, Slovenian &quot;seminar&quot;, Polish &quot;seminarium&quot;) to refer to a university class that includes a term paper or project, as opposed to a lecture class (e.g. German &quot;Vorlesung&quot;, Slovenian &quot;predavanje&quot;, Polish &quot;wykład&quot;). This does not correspond to the English use of the term. In some academic institutions, typically in scientific fields, the term &quot;preceptorial&quot; is used interchangeably with &quot;seminar&quot;.

In North Indian universities, the term &quot;seminar&quot; refers to a course of intense study relating to the student&#x27;s major. Seminars typically have significantly fewer students per professor than normal courses, and are generally more specific in topic of study. Seminars can revolve around term papers, exams, presentations, and several other assignments. Seminars are almost always required for university graduation. Normally, participants must not be beginners in the field under discussion at US and Canadian universities. Seminar classes are generally reserved for upper-class students, although at UK and Australian universities seminars are often used for all years. The idea behind the seminar system is to familiarize students more extensively with the methodology of their chosen subject and also to allow them to interact with examples of the practical problems that always occur during research work.

==Seminar rooms==

&quot;Seminar room&quot; is often used as a name for a generic group study or work space at a library. Some seminar rooms are more tailored to a specific topic or field, literally a space designed for a seminar course or individualized self-study to occur.

<doc id="677001" wikidata="Q16186591" url="?curid=677001" title="J. S. G. Boggs">
<text>James Stephen George Boggs (January 16, 1955 – January 22, 2017) was an American artist, best known for his hand-drawn depictions of banknotes. Due to his pre-Bitcoin philosophical questions about the value of fiat currency, his early interest in creating his own currency, and his contributions to an &quot;encrypted online currency&quot; as early as 2000, Boggs was described by Artnet as the Patron Saint of Cryptocurrency.

== Life ==
Boggs was born Stephen Litzner on January 16, 1955, in Woodbury, New Jersey. He attended Brandon High School in Brandon, Florida, but was expelled in his junior year.

==Art career==
Boggs began drawing currency as artwork in 1984, when a Chicago waitress accepted his drawing of &quot;a very abstract one dollar bill&quot; in payment for his 90¢ diner tab. When she returned 10¢ in change, Boggs felt &quot;electricity&quot; from the exchange and was inspired to conduct more such transactions with his original art.

His drawings of currency, depicting only a single side of the note, came to be known as &quot;Boggs notes&quot;. Boggs notes were both art objects and part of a performance. Boggs would exchange the notes only for their face value: when he drew a $100 bill, he exchanged it for $100 worth of goods. He then sold any change he received, the receipt, and sometimes the goods he purchased as his &quot;artwork&quot;, typically to art dealers and collectors. Boggs would tell a collector where he spent the note and the details of the transaction, but he did not sell the notes into the art market directly. The buyer would then track down the person in possession of the note in order to purchase it. Boggs noted that after the initial transaction the notes would be resold for much more than their face value, with one Boggs note reportedly being resold for $420,000.

One of his better-known works is a series of bills done for the Florida United Numismatists&#x27; annual convention. Denominations from $1 to $50 (and perhaps higher) feature designs taken from the reverse sides of contemporary U.S. currency, modified slightly through the changing of captions (notably, &quot;The United States of America&quot; is changed to &quot;Florida United Numismatists&quot; and the denomination wording is occasionally replaced by the acronym &quot;FUN&quot;) and visual details (the mirroring of Monticello on the $2, the Supreme Court building, as opposed to the U.S. Treasury, on the $10 and an alternate angle for the White House on the $20). They were printed in bright orange on one side and featured Boggs&#x27; autograph and thumbprint on the other.

Other works of money art that he designed include the mural &quot;All the World&#x27;s a Stage&quot;, roughly based on a Bank of England Series D £20 note and featuring Shakespearean themes, as well as banknote-sized creations that depict Boggs&#x27; ideas as to what U.S. currency should look like. A $100 bill featuring Harriet Tubman is one known example.

Boggs and his work are chronicled in &quot;Boggs: A Comedy of Values&quot;, by Lawrence Weschler, published by the University of Chicago Press.

== Legality and arrests ==
Boggs viewed his &quot;transactions&quot; as a type of performance art, but the authorities often viewed them with suspicion. Boggs aimed to have his audience question and investigate just what it is that makes &quot;money&quot; valuable in the first place. He steadfastly denied being a counterfeiter or forger, rather maintaining that a good-faith transaction between informed parties is certainly not fraud, even if the item transacted happens to resemble negotiable currency.

Boggs was first arrested for counterfeiting in England in 1986. He was defended by the human rights lawyers Geoffrey Robertson QC and Mark Stephens and acquitted. As detailed in Robertson&#x27;s book &quot;The Justice Game&quot;, all Bank of England notes now carry a copyright message on the face as a direct result of Boggs&#x27; activities, the idea being that if they cannot secure a counterfeiting charge, then they can at least secure a copyright violation. In 1989, one of the original £5 &quot;bank notes&quot; from the trial was included in the British Museum exhibition Fake? The Art of Deception; this item was added to the British Museum&#x27;s permanent collection the following year, via donation by the artist himself. In 2022, this drawing went on public display in the British Museum&#x27;s room 68 (the &quot;Money Gallery&quot;) alongside one of Banksy&#x27;s &quot;Di-faced tenner&quot; £10 notes.

He was arrested for a second time in Australia in 1989, acquitted and awarded the equivalent of US$20,000 in damages by the presiding judge.

Boggs&#x27; home was raided three times between 1990 and 1992 by the United States Secret Service on suspicion of counterfeiting. In the raids 1300 items were confiscated, although no legal case was brought against him.

==Death==
Boggs died on January 22, 2017, in Tampa at the age of 62.

<doc id="677008" wikidata="Q647653" url="?curid=677008" title="Divertimento">
<text>(; from the Italian &quot;&quot; &quot;to amuse&quot;) is a musical genre, with most of its examples from the 18th century. The mood of the &quot;&quot; is most often lighthearted (as a result of being played at social functions) and it is generally composed for a small ensemble. The term is used to describe a wide variety of secular (non-religious) instrumental works for soloist or chamber ensemble. It is usually a kind of music entertainment, although it could also be applied to a more serious genre. After 1780, the term generally designated works that were informal or light.

==Genre==
As a separate genre, it appears to have no specific form, although most of the &quot;divertimenti&quot; of the second half of the 18th century go either back to a dance suite approach (derived from the &#x27;ballet&#x27; type of theatrical &quot;divertimento&quot;), or take the form of other chamber music genres of their century (as a continuation of the merely instrumental theatrical &quot;divertimento&quot;). There are many other terms which describe music similar to the &quot;divertimento&quot;, including &quot;serenade&quot;, &quot;cassation&quot;, &quot;notturno&quot;, &quot;Nachtmusik&quot;; after about 1780, the &quot;divertimento&quot; was the term most commonly applied to this light, &quot;after-dinner&quot; and often outdoor music. &quot;Divertimenti&quot; have from one to nine movements, and there is at least one example with thirteen. The earliest publication to use the name &quot;divertimento&quot; is by Carlo Grossi in 1681 in Venice (&quot;Il divertimento de&#x27; grandi: musiche da camera, ò per servizio di tavola&quot;) and the hint that the &quot;divertimento&quot; is to accompany &quot;table service&quot; applies to later ages as well, since this light music was often used to accompany banquets and other social events.

==Examples==
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is known for having composed different types of &quot;divertimenti&quot;, sometimes even taking the form of a small symphony (or, more exactly: sinfonia), for example, the &quot;Salzburg Symphonies&quot; K. 136, K. 137 and K. 138. Even more unusual is his six movement string trio, the Divertimento in E-flat, K. 563, which is a serious work belonging with his string quartets and quintets. Other composers of &quot;divertimenti&quot; include Leopold Mozart, Carl Stamitz, Joseph Haydn and Luigi Boccherini.

 Igor Stravinsky also arranged a &quot;divertimento&quot; from his ballet to music of Tchaikovsky, &quot;Le baiser de la fée&quot;, while Joaquín Rodrigo called his 1982 cello concerto a &quot;Concierto como un divertimento&quot; (&quot;Concerto like a divertimento&quot;). Robert Davine also composed a &quot;Divertimento for Flute, Clarinet, Bassoon and Accordion&quot; for chamber music ensemble.

<doc id="677012" wikidata="Q499552" url="?curid=677012" title="Zhoukoudian Peking Man Site">
<text>Zhoukoudian Peking Man Site (), also romanized as Choukoutien, is a cave system in suburban Fangshan District, Beijing. It has yielded many archaeological discoveries, including one of the first specimens of &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (&quot;Homo erectus pekinensis&quot;), dubbed Peking Man, and a fine assemblage of bones of the giant short-faced hyena &quot;Pachycrocuta brevirostris&quot;.

Due to differing interpretations of the evidence, proposed dates for when Peking Man inhabited this site vary greatly, including: 700,000–200,000 years ago, 670,000–470,000 years ago, or no earlier than 530,000 years ago.

The Peking Man Site was first discovered by Johan Gunnar Andersson in 1921, and was first excavated by Otto Zdansky in 1921 and 1923, unearthing two human teeth. These were later identified by Davidson Black as belonging to a previously unknown species, and extensive excavations followed. Fissures in the limestone-containing middle Pleistocene deposits have yielded the remains of about 45 individuals, as well as animal remains, and stone flake and chopping tools.

The oldest animal remains date from as early as 690,000 years ago, with tools as old as 670,000 years ago, while another authority dates the tools found as no earlier than 530,000 years ago. During the Upper Palaeolithic, the site was re-occupied, and remains of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; and their stone and bone tools have also been recovered from the Upper Cave.

The crater Choukoutien on asteroid 243 Ida was named after the location. The caves are located in Zhoukoudian Town, Fangshan District, southwest of central Beijing.

==Excavation history==
===Discovery===
Swedish geologist Johan Gunnar Andersson first started his explorations of the region in 1918 at an area called &quot;Chicken-bone Hill&quot; by locals who had misidentified the rodent fossils that were found in abundance there, but it was not until 1921 that he and American palaeontologist Walter W. Granger were led to the site known as &quot;Dragon Bone Hill&quot; by local quarry men. Noticing some white quartz that was foreign to the area, he immediately realised that this would be a good place to search for the remains of primitive man.

Excavations were undertaken by Andersson&#x27;s assistant, Austrian palaeontologist Otto Zdansky in 1921 and 1923, unearthing a great deal of material that was sent back to Uppsala University in Sweden for further analysis. In 1926, Anderson announced the discovery of two human molars amongst this material, and the following year Zdansky published his finding, cautiously identifying the teeth as &quot;?Homo sp.&quot;

Sometimes called the Zhoukidian wolf, &quot;Canis variabilis&quot; fossils were found at the Zhoukoudian cave system and archaeological site in 1934, and named by their discoverer, Pei Wenzhong:

===Zhoukoudian Project===
Canadian paleoanthropologist Davidson Black, who was working for the Peking Union Medical College at the time, was excited by Andersson and Zdansky&#x27;s find, and applied to the Rockefeller Foundation for funding to undertake a systematic excavation of the site. Funding was granted, and the Zhoukoudian Project commenced excavations in 1927 under the supervision of Chinese archaeologist Li Jie.

That fall, a tooth was unearthed by Swedish paleontologist Anders Birger Bohlin, which Black proposed belonged to a new species dubbed &quot;Sinanthropus pekinensis&quot;. The following year, Black&#x27;s excavations uncovered more fossils of his new species, including teeth, a substantial part of a juvenile&#x27;s jaw, and an adult jaw complete with three teeth. These finds allowed Black to secure an additional $80,000 grant from the Foundation, which he used to establish a research laboratory.

===Cenozoic Research Laboratory===
The Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Geological Survey of China was established at the Peking Union Medical College in 1928 with the assistance of Chinese geologists Ding Wenjiang and Weng Wenhao, for the research and appraisal of the fossils unearthed. Black stayed on at the Laboratory as honorary director, while excavations continued at the site under Chinese paleontologist Yang Zhongjian, anthropologists Pei Wenzhong, and Jia Lanpo.

Conditions at the site were primitive, with scientists having to ride out to the excavation on mules and staying at caravansaries along the way. When the first skullcap was unearthed at the site in 1929, it was done by Pei, working in a 40-meter crevasse in frigid weather, with a hammer in one hand and a candle in the other. A second skullcap was discovered close to the first in 1930, and by 1932 nearly 100 workers were deployed at the site each day.

Despite the conditions at the site, eminent researchers continued to visit. French palaeontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin had been a regular visitor to the site since 1926. French archaeologist Henri Breuil visited in 1931 and confirmed the presence of stone tools. That same year, evidence of the use of fire at the cave was accepted.

The ever-industrious Black died one night at his office in 1934, with one of the skullcaps unearthed at the site on his desk. German Jewish anthropologist Franz Weidenreich replaced him as honorary director of the Laboratory, and excavations continued, uncovering a further three skullcaps in 1936.

Altogether, excavations uncovered 200 human fossils from more than 40 individuals, including 5 nearly complete skullcaps, before they were brought to a halt in 1937 by the Japanese invasion of China. Reports of Japanese atrocities include the torture and murder of workers at the site, with three bayoneted to death, and a fourth forced to pull a rickshaw until dying of starvation.

In 1941, the bulk of the finds were lost, never to be recovered, while in transport to safety. Fortunately, Weidenreich had made copies of the fossils to preserve their physical characteristics.

===Postwar excavations===
Excavation work was recommenced in 1949, unearthing new Peking Man fossils, including 5 teeth and fragments of thigh and shin bone. The following year, a third premolar was discovered in the material sent back to Uppsala by Zdansky in 1921 and 1923.

The Peking Man Site was designated &quot;Type section of cave deposits of Middle Pleistocene in North China&quot; by the Annual Congress of the National Committee of Stratigraphy of China in 1959, and a mandible fragment was unearthed.

Excavations led by Pei in 1966 unearthed a premolar and two pieces of skull fragment – these were discovered to match fragments retained from previous excavations in 1934 and 1936, and the only extant example of a nearly complete skullcap was pieced together.

Excavations at Locality 4 in Zhoukoudian, from 1972–73, unearthed a &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; premolar.

Modern scientific dating techniques confirm that the site was occupied between 230,000 and 500,000 years ago.

==Excavation sites==

===Peking Man Site===

Locality 1, also known as Peking Man Site, was the first to be discovered, in 1921, under the direction of local quarry men. The site was originally a natural limestone cave, although the roof had long since collapsed, spreading a layer of breccia and rubble across the top of the deposits. Early excavations in 1921 and 1923 revealed evidence of human habitation from 200,000 to 500,000 years ago. The cave was excavated from 1927-37, yielding 200 human fossils (from 40 individuals) identified as &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, more than 10,000 lithic pieces, several cinder layers indicating fire use in early man, as well as animal fossils from 200 separate species. The bulk of this material was lost in 1941 during the Japanese occupation and has never been recovered. Excavations recommenced in 1949 and continued to yield fossils and artefacts, making this site one of the most fruitful sources of material from the Middle Pleistocene era.

A total of 13 layers have been excavated at the site to a depth of nearly 40 m.

Layers below this have been shown by test-pit excavation not to contain fossils or lithics and have never been excavated.

===Upper Cave===

Situated on the upper part of Dragon Bone Hill, this cave was discovered in 1930, and excavated from 1933–34, during which time the roof and north-facing opening were removed. Excavations found evidence of human habitation in the cave dating back to 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. The cave was divided into an upper-level living quarters, and a lower-level burial ground, while a small recess on the lower level acted as a natural animal trap. Finds unearthed included three human skulls, and other remains from at least eight individuals identified as archaic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, tools and ornaments made from stone and bone, and numerous animal bones, including complete skeletons of large mammals caught in the lower-level trap. Also, white powder sprinkled around the remains on the lower level indicated the inhabitants practiced burial rites.

===Other localities===
More than 20 fossil-bearing localities have been excavated in Zhoukoudian to date.

<text>Hengill () is a volcanic table mountain situated in the south-west of Iceland, to the south of Þingvellir. 

The volcano is still active, as evidenced by its numerous hot springs and fumaroles, but the last eruption occurred approximately 2,000 years ago, before the settlement of Iceland.

==Geography==
The mountain is south of Lake Thingvallavatn (Þingvallavatn in Icelandic), south-west of the Nesjavellir geothermal area, south of Þingvellir National Park and is the most prominent part of a volcanic region that extends to the coast. South of the mountain towards the coast is the Hellisheiði geothermal area to its south-west, and the town of Hveragerði on Iceland&#x27;s main ringroad, Route 1 about east of Reykjavík. At the coast is the port of Þorlákshöfn.

==Geology==
The mountain is part of the long Hengill volcanic system, which is part of the Reykjanes volcanic belt, and is a hyaloclastite massif of tuyas and tindars. The dominant lava in the Hengill volcanic system is tholeiitic basalt, but andesite and about rhyolite occur within the central mountain. The largest lava shield covers about . Four small lava shields are picrite basalt and one lava shield contains about of olivine tholeiite. It is located at the intersection with two other tectonic volcanic systems, the West volcanic zone of Iceland and South Iceland seismic zone, and is co-located to the plate boundary between the North American, Eurasian and Hreppar plates. This intersection is called the Hengill triple junction.
Hveragerdi to the south is a volcano in the volcanic system that became extinct 300,000 years ago, but still has significant seismic activity. It can be regarded as a predecessor volcano. This seismic activity is significant not only because of human impact but also because the earthquakes are grouped along faults striking north–south or east–west, but not north to north-east, as might be supposed based on the surface geological structure and that the rift zone is deep as locally. The earthquake distribution has been interpreted to have defined the heat source of the Hengill volcano.

Extending to the north-east from the central volcano is a fissure swarm with a number of tindars associated with an asymmetrical graben. Lake Thingvallavatn, occupies the proximal graben, and has at its southern end lava flows from the mountain and has hosted explosive eruptions historically. Amongst the faults on the north-west side of the graben is the Almannagjá chasm which extends from the northern shore of Lake Thingvallavatn.

Towards the south-east from the mountain towards the sea is a lava covered plateau whose height is about with scattered higher tindars and tuyas.

During the Holocene volcanic eruptions in the zone have been predominantly effusive and basaltic with minor tephra production. Erupted lava volumes have ranged from .

===Risk===
The official view of the volcanic hazard is that it is confined to a radius of and is related to lava flows, plugging of geothermal boreholes by lava, volcano-tectonic faulting and volcanic gas pollution.
There was either hydrothermal fluid or magma increase at a depth of approximately within the inferred brittle-ductile transition zone of the area centred at Ölkelduháls, between Hengill and Hrómundartindur to its east during 2017 and 2018. This volume had had been contracting between 2006–2017, and was about north-west from an area of uplift between 1993 and 1999.

==Geothermal resources==
There are three associated geothermal areas related to the high amount of fissuring in the Hengill volcanic
system producing high water subsurface permeability. These areas include Iceland’s second largest geothermal field which now is an important source of energy for the south of the country. The three areas are:
#Nesjavellir geothermal system, which is captured at the Nesjavellir power station near the western shore of the lake Þingvallavatn 
#Hellisheiði, which has the largest power station in Iceland, Hellisheiði power station, approximately south-west of Nesjavelli. Both stations are operated by Orkuveita Reykjavíkur (Reykjavik Energy).
#Hveragerdi, whose hydrothermal waters have been used for greenhouse heating.

The area with its mountains and hot springs is well suited for hiking and there are a lot of hiking trails.
The town of Hveragerði with its multitude of hot springs is also part of the Hengill area.

==Culture==
Some folk tales are connected to the region. For example, in a folk tale collected and published by Jón Árnason in 1862, a young farmer is said to have killed the sleeping troll woman Jóra while she lay in wait for innocent wanderers or horsemen on the trail over Dyrafjöll north of Hengill. In another folk tale, according to some people, a woman&#x27;s body found in the area was believed to be that of Halla, the wife of the famous Icelandic outlaw Fjalla-Eyvindur.

<text>John Colin Campbell Jordan (19 June 1923 – 9 April 2009) was a British politician and a leading figure in post-war neo-Nazism in the UK. In the far-right circles of the 1960s, Jordan represented the most explicitly Nazi inclination in his open use of the styles and symbols of Nazi Germany. Through his leadership of organisations such as the National Socialist Movement and the World Union of National Socialists, Jordan advocated a pan-Aryan &quot;Universal Nazism&quot;. Although later unaffiliated with any political party, Jordan remained an influential voice on the British far right.

==Early life==
The son of a lecturer, Percy Jordan, and a teacher, Bertha Jordan, Jordan was educated at Warwick School from 1934 to 1942. During the Second World War he attempted to enlist in the Fleet Air Arm and the RAF, but, after failing the tests for both, he enlisted in the Royal Army Educational Corps. After being demobilised in 1946 he studied at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, graduating in 1949 with second class honours in history. That same year he became a teacher at Stoke Secondary Modern Boys School, Coventry, where he taught mathematics. In 1953, he received his M.A. He joined the League of Empire Loyalists and became its Midlands organiser.

At Cambridge Jordan formed a Nationalist Club, from which he was invited to join the short-lived British People&#x27;s Party, a group of former British Union of Fascists members led by Lord Tavistock, heir to the Duke of Bedford. After the Second World War Jordan joined the British League of Ex-Servicemen and Women, a pro-fascist group led by Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s secretary, Jeffrey Hamm, but Jordan soon became associated with Arnold Leese and was left the use of a house in Leese&#x27;s will. This became the Notting Hill base of operations when Jordan launched the White Defence League in 1956. Jordan later merged this party with the National Labour Party to form the British National Party in 1960, although he split from it after a quarrel with John Bean, who was opposed to Jordan&#x27;s advocacy of Nazism.

==Leading activist==
In 1962, Jordan founded the National Socialist Movement (renamed the British Movement in 1968) with John Tyndall as its leader. A meeting in Trafalgar Square on 2 July 1962 of supporters was disrupted by opponents, whom Jordan described as being &quot;Jews and Communists&quot;, leading to a riot. He was dismissed by the board of governors of the Coventry school where he taught in August 1962 after a period of suspension that had begun after the events in Trafalgar Square.

In August 1962 Jordan hosted an international conference of Nazis at Guiting Power in Gloucestershire, which resulted in the formation of the World Union of National Socialists. Jordan was the commander of its European section throughout the 1960s and was also elected &quot;World Führer&quot; with George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party, as his deputy. On 16 August Jordan and Tyndall, together with Martin Webster, Denis Pirie and Roland Kerr-Ritchie, were charged under the Public Order Act 1936 with attempting to set up a paramilitary force called the Spearhead, which was modelled on the SA of Nazi Germany. Undercover police observed Jordan leading the group in military manoeuvres. He was sentenced to nine months&#x27; imprisonment in October 1962.

On 5 October 1963, while John Tyndall was still in prison, Jordan, who had just been released, married Tyndall&#x27;s fiancée, Françoise Dior, the former wife of a French nobleman and the niece of the French fashion designer Christian Dior. This hasty marriage was ostensibly to prevent her deportation as an undesirable alien. When Tyndall was eventually released, the marriage caused friction, and he split with Jordan in 1964 to form the Greater Britain Movement. Jordan&#x27;s marriage to Dior proved short-lived, though, and she announced the couple&#x27;s separation in January 1964. She claimed that Jordan had become &quot;bourgeois&quot;.

During the Leyton by-election of 1965 Jordan led a group of about 100 fascist demonstrators at a public Labour Party meeting, and after taking to the stage to berate the audience he was punched by Denis Healey, the then Secretary of State for Defence. The fracas came about because the far right was using the by-election to stir up interracial hatred in order to defeat the Labour candidate (and Foreign Secretary) Patrick Gordon Walker. He had previously been defeated in the 1964 general election in the Smethwick constituency after racist campaigning tactics were employed by Colin Jordan and his followers. Specifically, Jordan claimed that his group produced the much publicised &quot;If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote Liberal or Labour&quot; slogan and launched the campaign to circulate the posters and stickers which the slogan was written on; in the past Jordan&#x27;s group had also written and circulated other campaign slogans, such as: &quot;Don&#x27;t vote – a vote for Tory, Labour or Liberal is a vote for more Blacks!&quot;. The successful Conservative candidate was Peter Griffiths, who did little to condemn the campaign. On 25 January 1967, Jordan was sentenced to eighteen months in prison at Devon Assizes in Exeter for breaking the Race Relations Act 1965 by circulating material that was likely to cause racial hatred. At the same time, Jordan was prosecuted and convicted under the Public Order Act 1936 for distributing a leaflet titled &quot;The Coloured Invasion&quot;, &quot;a vituperative attack on black and Asian people&quot;.

In September 1972, Jordan was fined for disorderly behaviour at Heathrow Airport when, after protesting against the arrival of Ugandan Asians into Britain, he addressed airport staff through a loudspeaker, urging them to strike in protest against mass immigration from Uganda.

Jordan reorganised the National Socialist Movement as the British Movement in 1968, but in 1974 he was obliged to step down from its leadership in favour of Michael McLaughlin. His demise was further accelerated by his arrest and subsequent conviction for shoplifting three pairs of women&#x27;s red knickers from Tesco&#x27;s Leamington Spa branch in June 1975. Magistrates fined him £50 for the offence.

While leader of the British Movement, Jordan stood for parliament on three occasions: in the 1969 Birmingham Ladywood by-election (282 votes, 3.0%); Birmingham Aston in the 1970 general election (704 votes, 2.5%) and Wolverhampton North East in the February 1974 general election (711 votes, 1.5%).

==Later life==
Jordan maintained ties to groups led by Eddy Morrison and Kevin Watmough, such as the White Nationalist Party and the British People&#x27;s Party as well as the American National Socialist Workers Party. In 2000, he expressed scepticism over the efforts of the British National Party to soften its hard right stance.

In the 1980s, Jordan revived &quot;Gothic Ripples&quot;, originally Leese&#x27;s publication, as his personal political project. He once declared that there was &quot;no reliable evidence whatsoever&quot; that six million Jews had been murdered in the Holocaust. In 1989, he stated his belief that Jesus was &quot;counterfeit&quot; and Adolf Hitler was the real &quot;messiah&quot; and &quot;saviour&quot;, whose eventual &quot;resurrection&quot; would make him &quot;the spiritual conqueror of the future&quot;. Democracy, he thought, was really a form of dictatorship because it prevented the defence of the Aryan people.

Jordan was back in court in 2001, after being charged with publishing racist literature, but the judge ruled that his serious heart condition made him unfit to stand trial. He dedicated his 2004 book &quot;The Uprising&quot; to the jailed white supremacists Richard Scutari and David Lane.

Jordan and Julianne Safrany became life partners at some point after his divorce from Dior. The two were still together when Jordan died at his Pateley Bridge home on 9 April 2009.

==In fiction==
Jordan features in the 2014 historical novel &quot;Ridley Road&quot; by Jo Bloom. In its 2021 BBC television adaptation, he is portrayed by Rory Kinnear.

<doc id="677017" wikidata="Q859741" url="?curid=677017" title="Fielding percentage">
<text>In baseball statistics, fielding percentage, also known as fielding average, is a measure that reflects the percentage of times a defensive player properly handles a batted or thrown ball. It is calculated by the sum of putouts and assists, divided by the number of total chances (putouts + assists + errors).

While a high fielding percentage is regarded as a sign of defensive skill, it is also possible for a player of lesser defensive skill to have a high fielding percentage, as it does not reflect or take into account a player&#x27;s defensive range; a player who cannot get to a ball surrenders a hit instead of having an opportunity to make an out or an error. Conversely, a highly skilled fielder might have a comparatively low fielding percentage by virtue of reaching, and potentially missing, a greater number of balls.

In order to qualify for the league lead in fielding percentage, an infielder or outfielder must appear at the specific position in at least two-thirds of his team&#x27;s games (games in the outfield are not separated by position). A catcher must appear in at least half his team&#x27;s games. A pitcher must pitch at least one inning for each of his team&#x27;s scheduled games (however, a pitcher with fewer innings may qualify if they have more total chances and a higher average). In order to qualify for major league career records for fielding average, a player must appear in 1,000 games at the position; pitchers must have at least 1,500 innings. 

The MLB record for team fielding percentage is currently held by the 2013 Baltimore Orioles, with a .99104 fielding percentage.

Operated by Great Northern, it is the only deep-level underground station in London served exclusively by National Rail trains. Between 1933 and 1975 the station was operated as part of the London Underground, on a short branch of the Northern line. Between 1922 and 1948 the station name was Canonbury &amp; Essex Road. The name reverted to the original form in 1948.

==History==
The station was opened on 14 February 1904 by the Great Northern &amp; City Railway (GN&amp;CR) on its underground route between the Great Northern Railway (GNR) station at Finsbury Park and the Metropolitan Railway (MR) and City &amp; South London Railway (C&amp;SLR) station at Moorgate in the City of London.

The GN&amp;CR was intended to carry main line trains and the tunnels were constructed with a larger diameter () than the other deep tube railways being built at that time (roughly ). From 1913 the MR took control of the GN&amp;CR and ran it under its own name until it became part of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) in 1933. In preparation for the LPTB&#x27;s &quot;Northern Heights&quot; plan the line was transferred to the control of the Morden-Edgware Line (now the Northern line).

The Northern Heights plan involved the building of a connection to the surface platforms at Finsbury Park and the transfer of a London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) branch from there to , and Alexandra Palace. By 1939 much of the work for the connection of the lines had been done and the opening of the connection was scheduled for autumn 1940 but the start of World War II put a halt to further construction. After the war the uncompleted parts of the plan were cancelled and Northern line trains continued to run to Finsbury Park on what became known as the Northern City Line or, from 1970, the Northern line Highbury Branch.

The station was, from the early 1960s, closed on Sundays. In the 1970s it was also closed on Saturdays.

The Northern City Line was closed on 4 October 1975 (due to its weekend closure, Essex Road closed the day before) and ceased to be part of the London Underground. The line was transferred to British Rail (BR) and the unused connection between Drayton Park and Finsbury Park from the cancelled Northern Heights plan finally received the tracks to connect the line to the surface platforms at . On 8 August 1976, the City Line reopened as part of the BR network with main line size trains running to . On 8 November 1976, seventy-two years after the GN&amp;CR first opened, the line was opened fully for main line trains from Moorgate to Finsbury Park and beyond as had been originally intended. It is the only underground station on this line not operated by London Underground or Transport for London.

By comparison with other underground stations built at the beginning of the 20th century, the station&#x27;s surface building is nondescript and unremarkable. Unlike many other central London underground stations, Essex Road was never modernised with escalators and access to the platforms is by lift or a spiral staircase. The station also lacks the automatic ticket gates present at most London Underground and many National Rail stations. Far fewer passengers use Essex Road station, only 0.77 million entries and exits during 2019–20, compared to nearby Angel tube station, with 17.7 million for 2019.

At the lower level the lifts and staircase (of 156 steps) are connected to the platforms via a passageway and a short staircase rising between the two tunnels. The Underground&#x27;s former operation of the station is evident from the unused and rusty fourth rail which once provided a return of the current from the tube trains serving the line. The third rail is still in use, with return now through the running rails. Signs at street and platform level still reference Network SouthEast, even though it is now Great Northern that manage and serve this station.

==Services==
All services at Essex Road are operated by Great Northern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to 

During the peak hours, the station is served by an additional half-hourly service between Moorgate and Hertford North and the service between Moorgate and Welwyn Garden City is increased to 4 tph.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 21, 38, 56, 73, 341 and 476, and night routes N38, N73 and N271 serve the station.

==Future==
Essex Road was a station on the proposed Chelsea-Hackney line. However, the scheme currently being pursued by the developers of Crossrail, known as Crossrail 2, does not provide for an interchange at Essex Road.

<text>&quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic, Updated&quot; (otherwise known as &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic (Brought Down to Date)&quot;) was written in 1900 by Mark Twain, as a parody of American imperialism, in the wake of the Philippine–American War. It is written in the same tune and cadence as the original &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; by Julia Ward Howe. The poem remained unpublished in Twain&#x27;s lifetime and did not appear in print until 1958.

A recording was made by the Chad Mitchell Trio as &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic Brought Down to Date&quot;. The lyrics were slightly modified and the verse about prostitution excised, and the first four lines from the Marines&#x27; Hymn sung over one of the choruses.

The footnote in the lyrics contained the following text:

&quot;* NOTE: In Manila the Government has placed a certain industry under the protection of our flag. (M.T.)&quot;

<text>Valdosta State University (VSU or Valdosta State) is a public university in Valdosta, Georgia, United States, and is one of the four comprehensive universities in the University System of Georgia. , VSU had over 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students. VSU also offers classes at Moody Air Force Base north of Valdosta in Lowndes County.

Valdosta State offers degree levels that include: associate, bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, Education Specialist, and doctoral degree. The university is composed of the Colleges of the Arts, College of Business Administration, College of Education and Human Services, College of Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Nursing and Health Sciences, College of Science and Mathematics. The institution also includes over sixty graduate programs to choose from both online and in-person.

==History==
===South Georgia State Normal College (1913–1922)===
The school that would become Valdosta State University was founded in 1906. Colonel W.S. West led the legislation through the Georgia Senate, and C.R. Ashley and E.J. McRee pushed it through the House. However, no funds were appropriated for it until 1911 when the state allocated $25,000. The city of Valdosta raised $50,000, and Col. West gave the property that is now the main part of campus to the state for use by the new institution. The president chosen was Richard Holmes Powell. His travels in the American southwest led him to choose the Spanish Mission style of architecture for the institution&#x27;s buildings. The school opened as South Georgia State Normal College (SGSNC) in January 1913, with three college freshmen and 15 sub-freshmen. The early students were required to wear a school uniform and paid $10 per year for tuition and $12 per month for food and board. Most came to be teachers and studied subjects from literature to physics to agriculture. In 1922, the school became a four-year college and the legislature changed the name to Georgia State Womans College.

===Georgia State Woman&#x27;s College (1922–1950)===
President Powell headed the GSWC until 1933 when he was made dean of the Coordinate College in Athens. Jere M. Pound, President of the Georgia Teachers College, was sent to Valdosta. However, his tenure at GSWC lasted less than a year before he had to go on sick leave. He died a year later.

Frank Robertson Reade assumed the job of acting president in 1934 and on Pound&#x27;s death became president. During his tenure, New Deal programs enabled the school to expand physically from three to seven buildings. The Powell Library, dedicated by Eleanor Roosevelt, was a centerpiece of this construction. During World War II, GSWC emphasized politics and science in its curriculum and in 1943, the B.S. degree was added. Moody Airfield, located nine miles from campus, provided the male participants for many patriotic parties.

===Valdosta State College (1950–1993)===
Reade served until 1948, he was followed by J. Ralph Thaxton, who came from the University of Georgia, where he had served as professor, Dean, Director of Admissions, and Registrar. Soon after Thaxton began his service, the Board of Regents, acting on the advice of a committee which had examined the whole University System of Georgia, declared that in 1950 GSWC was to become co-educational—Valdosta State College (VSC).

Programs in premedical, predentistry, and prepharmacy were added, and the sciences became more prominent. Business became a popular major after 1950. By 1956 men on campus outnumbered the women. Greek organizations were formed, with fraternities leading the way, and intercollegiate athletics became a part of campus life when the Rebels, an all-male basketball team, was formed.

In 1953 VSC acquired the property of the former Emory Jr. College, a private all-male school that operated from 1928 to 1953, less than a mile away, and the facilities became the north campus which now house the College of Business, College of Nursing and Health Sciences, and Air Force ROTC.

Under Thaxton&#x27;s tenure, the college integrated in 1963. Over the next decade, the college added African-American students, faculty and administrators.

Thaxton retired in 1966, and S. Walter Martin, former president of Emory University and Vice Chancellor of the University System of Georgia, assumed the presidency. He presided over a time of physical expansion of the school, including the construction of such buildings as the Odum Library, the Education Center, The Fine Arts Building, the College Union, a Science Administration Building and six dormitories. The student body grew, the School of Nursing was established, and many programs expanded, including those in graduate education.

===Valdosta State University (1993–present)===
When Martin retired in 1978, Hugh Coleman Bailey assumed the post. Under Bailey, the school had doubled in size from 4,500 to 9,000 students. From 1978 to 1993, numerous programs were added and existing courses upgraded, resulting in the early 1980s in an endeavor to make VSC a university. Throughout the 1980s the college established off-campus sites and course offerings and began receiving state and federal grant funds to develop curriculum and programs. In 1993, all the hard work and planning paid off. Valdosta State College became Valdosta State University (VSU), the second regional university in the University System of Georgia. In fall 1998, Valdosta State University adopted the semester system, along with other units of the University System of Georgia. Under Bailey&#x27;s leadership VSU continued to grow with the addition of the University Center in the 1995 and a new science building in 2001.

In January 2002, Ronald M. Zaccari assumed the post and during his time in office VSU updated its infrastructure to accommodate student population growth, including the construction of four new dormitories and two parking decks. Patrick J. Schloss became the President of VSU in 2008 and was in office during the opening of a new Student Health Center, Georgia Residence Hall, and Student Union. William J. McKinney was announced as the new VSU president in 2012. On April 2, 2015, it was announced that McKinney would step down as president effective July 1, 2015.

In August 2015, interim president Cecil P. Staton citing a 17% decline in enrollment since its peak in 2011, announced that over thirty faculty and staff members would not have their contracts renewed at the end of the year. That decision was met with criticism by students and faculty, and has caused some to question the future of the institution.

==Location==
The city of Valdosta is located in South Georgia, just off of Interstate 75, approximately from the Florida state line. Valdosta is about a two-hour or less drive from Tallahassee, Macon, and Jacksonville, three hours from Orlando, Tampa, and Atlanta.

The Valdosta metropolitan area has a population of over 145,000 and the area offers many shopping areas including the Valdosta Mall, historic downtown Valdosta, multiple restaurants, a movie theater, a nearby theme park, art and history museums, and more.

The total economic impact of VSU related activities in the 2010 fiscal year brought in $537 million and 5,400 jobs to the Valdosta metropolitan area, or approximately 8 percent of the employed labor force in the Valdosta Metro area.

A study by Valdosta State University&#x27;s Center for Business and Economic Research (CBER) shows that in the 2010–2011 school year VSU directly and indirectly generated 5,055 jobs and created an annual labor income impact of $208.7 million for the Valdosta Metropolitan Area. The Valdosta State staff includes 1,302 full-time and 526 part-time employees. VSU ranks within the top 10 employers for the Valdosta MSA.

==Campus==
===Main Campus===

The VSU campus is divided into two areas: main, and north campus. The main campus houses much of the academic and administrative departments and is recognized for its Spanish Mission architecture theme of every building. The Main Campus faces North Patterson Street, one of the city&#x27;s main thoroughfares. In total, 85 buildings located across make up the Valdosta State University campus. Other units of the university are located in satellite facilities adjacent to the campus and along Patterson Street. The campuses and principal satellite buildings are connected by the university bus service, operating regularly throughout each class day.

====West Hall====

Built in 1917, West Hall, is the oldest building at Valdosta State University and has long been known as the symbol of the university due to its distinctive dome and Spanish-mission architecture. It is also the center of academic activity at VSU, housing the Administrative Offices of the President and Vice President for Academic Affairs. The Departments of English, Political Science, and Modern and Classical Languages are also located in West Hall. In addition, this building houses the Public Administration Programs, Department of Modern and Classical Languages Department, Department of English, Department of Political Sciences, and numerous classrooms.

====Odum Library====

The Gertrude Gilmer Odum Library built in 1971 at , serves as the main library of Valdosta State University. In 2004, a addition was built off the southern portion of the building doubling the size of Odum Library. Distinctive features of the addition include a 24-hour internet cafe, the GALILEO Technology Center, electronic classrooms, auditorium, expanded Media Center, climate-controlled Archives, new study areas, and additional book shelving.

The nearly library houses approximately 453,757 bound volumes, and nearly 3,000 current periodicals and newspapers and a microform collection of over a million units. The Odum Library is a Selective Depository of U.S. Government documents and maintains the Archives of Contemporary South Georgia History and a Southern History Collection. In November 2013, VSU announced it would expand its sustainability efforts by adding a solar canopy behind the library.

====Student Union====
The Valdosta State Student Union serves as the social center of Valdosta State. It offers students a one-story bookstore, 300-seat theater, game room, large dividable multi-purpose room with a capacity for over 500 people, ample lounge space, meeting rooms, student organization offices and a food court featuring Which Wich?, Starbucks, Moe&#x27;s Southwest Grill, and Chick-fil-A. The previous Student Union was too small to accommodate the growing student population at VSU and in the fall of 2008, was demolished for construction of the new Student Union which opened in 2010.

====Bailey Science Center====

The Hugh C. Bailey Science Center serves as the home of the Biology and Chemistry Departments. The facility is named after former VSU President Hugh C. Bailey who served from 1978 to 2001. The building has 22 teaching and 19 research laboratories that occupy the entire north side of the building. In addition, it has four greenhouses on the rooftop; 11 classrooms, including four 48 seat classrooms, and one 96 seat classroom; a large auditorium which seats 275, and a smaller auditorium which seats 148; two conference rooms and 41 offices.

===North Campus===
The Rea and Lillian Steele North Campus, located less than a mile, approximately ten blocks, north of the VSU main campus and is home to the Harley Langdale, Jr. School of Business Administration, Air Force ROTC Detachment 172, Billy Grant Field, home of the VSU baseball team, and the VSU Softball Complex. The campus is the former home of Emory Junior College, an all-male two-year private institution that served as a branch of Emory University based in Atlanta. The property was sold to Valdosta State in 1950 after it transitioned from an all-female school to co-educational. The buildings follow a red-brick modified form of Georgian architecture.

===Jewel Whitehead Camellia Trail===

The Camellia Trail is believed to be the only such trail on a university campus in the nation. Located in the northwest area of the Main Campus, more than 1,100 camellias of many varieties form a winding trail through the towering pines. The trail was a 1944 Christmas gift to the university from the late Mr. and Mrs. R. B. Whitehead of Valdosta. A memorial gateway honors the collection&#x27;s founder, &quot;The Camellia Lady,&quot; Jewell Whitehead.

===Outdoor Art Collection===
The Valdosta State campus features six metal sculptures as part of an expanding outdoor art collection. &quot;Cormorant&quot; by Harry McDaniel of North Carolina was the first sculpture installed during the summer of 2011 outside of the Fine Arts Building on the corner of Brookwood Drive and Oak Street. &quot;Three Spheres&quot; by Hoss Haley, also from North Carolina, is located on the north side of the Fine Arts Building. &quot;Fly Away Too&quot; by Andrew Light of Tallahassee, Florida, is outside the College of Education on Baytree Road. &quot;Black Bird,&quot; located between Odum Library and the Student Union, was created and donated by the university&#x27;s seventh president, Ronald M. Zaccari. Charles E. Hook&#x27;s &quot;Fenris&quot; located outside the north entrance Odum Library, was added in June 2012. Most recently &quot;Guardian&quot; by Tallahassee artist Mark Dickson was installed in July 2012 between Odum Library and the Fine Arts Building.

==Noted people==
==Free speech controversies==
===2007 suspension of student Hayden Barnes===

In May 2007, T. Hayden Barnes, a student at Valdosta State University, was &quot;administratively withdrawn&quot; for criticizing the construction of two new parking garages on campus in a manner that University President Ronald Zaccari, over the objection of other administrators, deemed to be indicative of Barnes posing a clear and present danger to the VSU campus. In January 2008, Barnes filed a civil rights lawsuit against the university, VSU President Ronald Zaccari, the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, and other VSU administrators. In 2021, Barnes won his legal battle against past university president Zaccari. In July 2015, the university&#x27;s insurers settled the case for $900,000.

===2014 deactivation of adjunct professor Mark Patrick George===

On July 28, 2014, Valdosta State University deactivated the email account of adjunct sociology professor Mark P. George, a day after he sent a follow-up letter to state officials critical of the state of Georgia funding Confederate History Month, confederate events, and memorials. In June 2014, George had sent a similar open letter to Governor Nathan Deal and all of the state legislatures through his university email account. Professor George was also the long-time director of the Mary Turner Project, a program dedicated to raising awareness of the 1918 lynching spree in Lowndes County which included the death of Mary Turner. The funds for the Mary Turner Project were frozen at the same time of the deletion of George&#x27;s email. The email account was deactivated following complaints by VSU alumnus and Sons of Confederate Veterans member, John Cooper Hall Jr. to VSU president William McKinney on 11 July. After initially supporting George&#x27;s actions under freedom of speech, McKinney was instructed by Thomas Daniel of the University System of Georgia&#x27;s External Affairs to remove George&#x27;s access to university email. It is the position of VSU that George&#x27;s action violated rules against using university materials for a political agenda. A meeting was arranged between McKinney and George in August in which George came away dissatisfied. In response to George&#x27;s account being deactivated, John Cooper Hall Jr. responded, &quot;Cry me a river. It&#x27;s not like the Confederate Army went down there and hung him.&quot; If proper procedures were followed when George&#x27;s email account was deactivated is still in question as of August 24, 2014. George has since voluntarily left VSU for a job elsewhere. In late October 2014, McKinney ordered an independent investigation into the ongoing clash. It is the position of Mark George that the shut-down of his email was politically motivated. John Cooper Hall Jr, claims that George&#x27;s email being shut-down was as a result of personal attacks against Hall. McKinney is refusing to comment on the matter until the independent investigation is complete. Hall&#x27;s initial letter to McKinney complained that George was trying &quot;to use racial politics to affect the upcoming election&quot; with his campaign against Georgia&#x27;s funding Confederate related matters, and makes no mention of personal attacks. In late January 2015, the independent investigation announced that President McKinney did no wrong regarding Mark George.

<text>Eugene Huu-Chau &quot;Gene&quot; Trinh (Vietnamese: Trịnh Hữu Châu, born September 14, 1950) is a Vietnamese American biochemist who flew aboard NASA Space Shuttle mission STS-50 as a Payload Specialist, becoming the first Vietnamese American astronaut in space and the second Vietnamese in space (after cosmonaut Phạm Tuân).

==Biography==
Trinh was born in Saigon, South Vietnam. Trinh moved with his parents to Paris, France, when he was two years old. He came to the United States to study when he was 18 and later became an American citizen.

Trinh graduated from Lycee Michelet in Paris, France, in 1968 with a baccalaureate degree. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering-Applied Physics from Columbia University in 1972. He then studied at Yale University, earning a Masters of Science in 1974, a Masters of Philosophy in 1975, and a Doctorate of Philosophy in Applied Physics in 1977.

==Career==
Trinh served as the director of the physical sciences research division in the Biological and Physical Research Enterprise at NASA headquarters. He started with NASA in 1979, as a senior research scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He conducted experimental and theoretical research in fluid dynamics, fundamental materials science, and levitation technology for 20 years. He performed hands-on experimental investigations in laboratories aboard the NASA KC-135 aircraft, and on the Space Shuttle Columbia.

Trinh was a payload specialist crew member on the STS-50/United States Microgravity Lab-1 Space Shuttle flight in 1992.

As director of the physical sciences research division at NASA, Trinh leads the effort to develop an innovative peer-reviewed scientific program focusing on the effects of gravity on physical, chemical, and biological systems. The results of this program will enable the human exploration and development of space, providing the scientific basis for technologies permitting humankind to explore the vast expanses of our solar system and beyond.

In May 2004, Trinh received the Golden Torch Award from the Vietnamese American National Gala in Washington, D.C.

* Alexey Leonov Medal (Kemerovo Region, 2015) — for five perfect spacewalks.

== Cosmonaut career ==

In 1994 he was selected to begin cosmonaut training, and in 1998 he started training as a flight engineer for the Expedition 3 crew. He also served as a backup crew member for the first ISS mission.

=== Expedition 3 ===
Tyurin lived and worked aboard the International Space Station as part of the Expedition 3 crew. carrying Tyurin and six other crewmembers on STS-105 mission blasted off to space from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on August 10, 2001. The shuttle docked with the ISS on 12 August at 18:41 UTC. Tyurin spent approximately 4 months aboard the station as flight engineer 1. During the long-duration mission, the Expedition 3 crew enjoyed a unique view of the 2001 Leonid meteor storm. At the end of the stay Expedition 3 crewmembers, NASA astronaut Frank Culbertson, Tyurin, and cosmonaut Vladimir Dezhurov returned to Earth on board Space Shuttle . &quot;Endeavour&quot; STS-108 mission delivered the Expedition 4 crew to the ISS and landed at KSC on December 17, 2001.

=== Expedition 14 ===

Tyurin with NASA astronaut Michael Lopez-Alegria and spaceflight participant Anousheh Ansari lifted off on board the Soyuz TMA-9 spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on 18 September 2006 at 04:08 UTC, to the ISS. The spacecraft docked with the ISS on September 20 at 05:21 UTC following two days of autonomous flight. Tyurin served as the Soyuz commander, and after docking with the ISS they exchanged with the resident crew on board ISS and became the fourteenth station crew, Expedition 14. Tyurin spent 215 days aboard the International Space Station as a flight engineer. The Soyuz TMA-9 capsule carrying Tyurin, Lopez-Alegria and spaceflight participant Charles Simonyi landed southwest of Karaganda, Kazakhstan on 21 April 2007 12:30 UTC.

=== Expedition 38/39 ===

Tyurin was commander of flight Soyuz TMA-11M, which docked with the ISS on November 7, 2013. The Soyuz FG rocket carrying Tyurin, American astronaut Rick Mastracchio and Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata lifted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome at 04:14 GMT and docked with the ISS six hours later. The Soyuz TMA-11M crew carried a torch for the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Once at the ISS, Tyurin, Mastracchio and Wakata met Fyodor Yurchikhin, Karen Nyberg, Luca Parmitano, Oleg Kotov, Sergey Ryazansky, Michael Hopkins. This was the first time since October 2009 that nine people have served together aboard the station without a space shuttle being docked to the orbital station.

During his stay at the space station, Tyurin was involved in studying the cardiovascular and neurological systems as a part of understanding how human body adapts to zero gravity.

Tyurin returned to Earth on May 14, 2014, after 188 days in space. The Soyuz crew carrying Tyurin touched down southeast of Dzhezkazgan in Kazakhstan at 01:57 UTC.

=== Spacewalks ===
As of June 2010, Tyurin has performed four career spacewalks. Tyurin&#x27;s EVA time through four spacewalks is 17 hours and 14 minutes.

Tyurin conducted his first three career spacewalks during the Expedition 3 mission to the ISS. On October 8, 2001, Tyurin and Dezhurov ventured outside ISS to mark the 100th spacewalk to be carried out by Russian cosmonauts. The main objective of the spacewalk was to outfit the &quot;Pirs&quot; Docking Compartment and make connections between that newly arrived compartment and the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module. The spacewalkers installed a cable that allows space walk radio communications between the two station sections. They also installed handrails on the new compartment and an exterior ladder that will be used to help spacewalkers leave &quot;Pirs&quot;″ hatch. Tyurin and Dezhurov also installed a Strela cargo crane onto the station. The spacewalk lasted 4 hours and 58 minutes ending at 19:21 UTC.

On October 15, 2001, Tyurin performed his second career spacewalk. The two spacewalkers returned to space outside the ISS from the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock. Dezhurov and Tyurin installed Russian commercial experiments on the exterior of &quot;Pirs&quot;. Among the experiments is a set of investigations of how various materials react to the space environment over a long time. Called MPAC-SEEDS, the investigation is housed in three briefcase-sized containers. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 52 minutes.

On December 3, 2001, Tyurin conducted his third career spacewalk. Dressed in Orlan spacesuits, Tyurin and Dezhurov floated out of the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock at 13:20 UTC. Dezhurov and Tyurin used a cutting tool to remove an errant rubber seal that had prevented a Progress resupply ship from firmly docking with the ISS. The two spacewalkers also took pictures of the debris, which was a rubberized seal from the previous cargo ship, and of the docking interface. The spacewalk lasted 2 hours and 46 minutes.

On November 22, 2006, Tyurin performed his fourth career spacewalk starting at 23:17 UTC. The spacewalk had been delayed from its scheduled 20:00 UTC start time due to a cooling issue in Tyurin&#x27;s suit. Tyurin got out of the suit and straightened a suspect hose which apparently had become kinked. During the spacewalk, Tyurin hit a golf ball from the exterior of the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock. This &quot;experiment&quot; was sponsored by a Toronto-based commercial company, &quot;Element 21&quot;, which manufactures golf clubs made of scandium. The ball weighs just 3 grams, compared with 48 grams for a standard golf ball. At that weight, it was unlikely to damage any station components which might accidentally have been hit. The two spacewalkers next task was to inspect a Kurs antenna on the Progress M-58 spacecraft that had docked on October 26, 2006. Tyurin and Lopez-Alegria moved to the rear of the &quot;Zvezda&quot; module and photographed the antenna. Since it was still fully extended, Tyurin used a screwdriver to release a latch and tried to retract the antenna. Russian flight controllers also tried to retract it by activating a motor. Neither succeeded, and the task was abandoned. Next they relocated a WAL antenna, that was to guide the unpiloted European cargo carrier, the Automated Transfer Vehicle, to dock with the station. The two spacewalkers also installed a BTN neutron experiment, which characterizes charged and neutral particles in low Earth orbit. Two thermal covers from the BTN were jettisoned before Tyurin and Lopez-Alegria returned to the &quot;Pirs&quot; airlock at 04:55 UTC on 23 November. The spacewalk lasted 5 hours and 38 minutes.

<text>Dungannon (, ) is a town in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It is the second-largest town in the county (after Omagh) and had a population of 16,282 at the 2021 Census. The Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council had its headquarters in the town, though since 2015 the area has been covered by Mid-Ulster District Council.

For centuries, it was the &#x27;capital&#x27; of the O&#x27;Neill dynasty of Tír Eoghain, who dominated most of Ulster and built a castle on the hill. After the O&#x27;Neills&#x27; defeat in the Nine Years&#x27; War, the English founded a plantation town on the site, which grew into what is now Dungannon. Dungannon has won Ulster in Bloom&#x27;s Best Kept Town Award five times. It currently has the highest percentage of immigrants of any town in Northern Ireland.

== History ==
For centuries, Dungannon&#x27;s fortunes were closely tied to that of the O&#x27;Neill dynasty which ruled a large part of Ulster until the 17th century. Dungannon was the clan&#x27;s main stronghold. The traditional site of inauguration for &#x27;The O&#x27;Neill&#x27; was Tullyhogue Fort, an Iron Age mound some four miles northeast of Dungannon. The clan O&#x27;Hagan were the stewards of this site for the O&#x27;Neills. In the 14th century the O&#x27;Neills built a castle on what is today known as Castle Hill; the location was ideal for a fort, for it was one of the highest points in the area and dominated the surrounding countryside, giving (depending on the weather) the ability to see seven counties.

This castle was burned in 1602 by Hugh O&#x27;Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, as Crown forces under Lord Mountjoy closed in on the Gaelic lords towards the end of the Nine Years&#x27; War. In 1607, ninety-nine Irish chieftains and their followers, including Hugh O&#x27;Neill, set sail from Rathmullan, bound for the continent, in an event known as the Flight of the Earls. In what became known as the Plantation of Ulster, their lands were confiscated and awarded to Protestant English and Scots settlers; Dungannon and its castle were granted to Sir Arthur Chichester, the Lord Deputy of Ireland.

Sir Phelim O&#x27;Neill seized the town in the opening stages of the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and issued the Proclamation of Dungannon, in which the rebels set out their aims and proclaimed their loyalty to Charles I. O&#x27;Neill claimed they had been ordered to rise by the King, and later produced a forged commission in support of this. During the course of the Irish Confederate Wars, Dungannon changed hands several times; Scots Covenanter forces under Alexander Leslie captured it in September 1642, before O&#x27;Neill took it back in spring 1643.

In 1973, the town became the seat of the new district of the Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council. In 1782, the town was the location where the independence of the Irish Parliament was declared by members of the Protestant Ascendancy who controlled the parliament at the time.

The castle was partially excavated in October 2007 by the Channel 4 archaeological show &quot;Time Team&quot;, uncovering part of the moat and walls of the castle.

=== The Troubles ===
In the late 1960s Northern Ireland was plunged into an ethnopolitical conflict known as the Troubles. On 24 August 1968, the Campaign for Social Justice (CSJ), the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA), and other groups, held Northern Ireland&#x27;s first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The rally was officially banned, but took place and passed off without incident. The publicity surrounding the march encouraged other groups to form branches of NICRA.

During the conflict Dungannon suffered numerous bombings, and almost 50 people were killed in and around the town. The deadliest attack was on 17 March 1976, when a loyalist car bomb killed four Catholic civilians.

=== The Dungannon circus crash ===

On 7 May 1954, a convoy of circus wagons crashed and overturned in Dungannon. The convoy was on its way to hold a circus in Ballygawley when a pilot lorry, which was towing three wagons, struck a chemist&#x27;s shop while taking a sharp bend on Irish Street. The driver lost control of the lorry, which continued on to Market Square. The first of its wagons, carrying eight horses, four Shetland ponies and an ass, toppled over, smashing the front of two drapery shops. The second wagon, carrying three lions, crashed into the front of a hair salon and a hardware shop. Locals broke the back of the horses&#x27; wagon open, to free the animals trapped inside. A large group of locals and police physically moved the wagon containing the lions back onto the road to allow it to be removed.

== Demography ==
The population of the town increased slightly overall during the 19th century:

== Places of interest ==

An interesting feature of the town is the former Royal Irish Constabulary barracks at the northeastern corner of the market square which is quite unlike any other police barracks of a similar vintage in Ireland. A popular but apocryphal story relates that the unusual design of this building is due to a mix-up with the plans in Dublin which meant Dungannon got a station designed for Nepal and they got a standard Irish barracks, complete with a traditional Irish fireplace. Dungannon Park covers ; it is centred round an idyllic still-water lake, with miles of pathways and views of the surrounding townland.

== Geography ==
Dungannon is in the southeast of County Tyrone, within the historic barony of Dungannon Middle and the civil parish of Drumglass.

The town grew up around a hill, known locally as Castle Hill. There are three small lakes on the southern edge of town, the biggest of which is Black Lough. There are also two parks in the eastern part of town: Dungannon Park and Windmill Wood Park.

The Great Northern Railway took over the PD&amp;O in 1876 and built a branch line from Dungannon to Cookstown in 1879.

The GNR Board cut back the Cookstown branch to Coalisland in 1956 and the Ulster Transport Authority (UTA) closed the branch altogether in 1959. In accordance with the Benson Report submitted to the Government of Northern Ireland 1963 the UTA closed the &quot;Derry Road&quot; through Dungannon in 1965.

== Sport ==
=== Cricket ===
Dungannon Cricket Club was established in 1865. Attempts were made to re-establish the club after the First World War and this was done in 1929 and survived until 1933 when Lord Ranfurly died, which for a second time left the club without a ground. Cricket was kept alive by the Royal School, Bankers and the RUC until 1939 when the Second World War broke out. The club was reformed in 1948 mainly due to the efforts of Eddie Hodgett and the NCU leagues in 1952 and continues to do so to the present time. The club has never quite reached senior cricket as it has limited resources and relies on the District Council for a ground. The club has played on at least five different locations during its existence. Home games are played at Dungannon Park.

=== Football ===
Dungannon Swifts F.C. is the town&#x27;s local team, which plays in the NIFL Premiership, and is Tyrone&#x27;s only representative in the league, following Omagh Town&#x27;s collapse.

=== Greyhound racing ===
Greyhound racing was once a popular sport in Dungannon. The Dungannon Greyhound Stadium was opened in July 1930, the third track in Northern Ireland after Celtic Park and Dunmore Stadium. The stadium, also known as the Oaks Park Greyhound Stadium, remained operational until January 2003 when it was closed by Dungannon (Oaks Park) Stadium Greyhound Racing Limited who had taken over the track in 1995 and saw the opportunity to make a substantial profit by developing the site.
