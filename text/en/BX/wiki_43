<text>The current Constitution of Mexico, formally the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States (), was drafted in Santiago de Querétaro, in the State of Querétaro, Mexico, by a constituent convention during the Mexican Revolution. It was approved by the Constituent Congress on 5 February 1917, and was later amended several times. It is the successor to the Constitution of 1857, and earlier Mexican constitutions. &quot;The Constitution of 1917 is the legal triumph of the Mexican Revolution. To some it is the revolution.&quot;

The current Constitution of 1917 is the first such document in the world to set out social rights, serving as a model for the Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Constitution of 1918. Some of the most important provisions are Articles 3, 27, and 123; adopted in response to the armed insurrection of popular classes during the Mexican Revolution, these articles display profound changes in Mexican politics that helped frame the political and social backdrop for Mexico in the twentieth century. Article 3 established the basis for free, mandatory, and secular education; Article 27 laid the foundation for land reform in Mexico; and Article 123 was designed to empower the labor sector, which had emerged in the late nineteenth century and which supported the winning faction of the Mexican Revolution.

Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130 seriously restricted the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico, and attempts to enforce the articles strictly by President Plutarco Calles (1924–1928) in 1926 led to the violent conflict known as the Cristero War.

In 1992, under the administration of Carlos Salinas de Gortari, there were significant revisions of the constitution, modifying Article 27 to strengthen private property rights, allow privatization of ejidos and end redistribution of land, and the articles restricting the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico were largely repealed.

Constitution Day (&quot;Día de la Constitución&quot;) is one of Mexico&#x27;s annual Fiestas Patrias (public holidays), commemorating the promulgation of the Constitution on 5 February 1917. The holiday is held on the first Monday of February.

==History==

===Constitutionalists and the idea of a new constitution===
The Political Constitution of the United Mexican States is one of the major outcomes of the Mexican Revolution that started in 1910 and won by the Constitutionalist faction led by Venustiano Carranza. Carranza&#x27;s Constitutionalist coalition invoked the liberal 1857 Constitution to unite Mexicans against the regime of General Victoriano Huerta, who had come to power by a coup in February 1913. The revolutionaries fought for causes that were beyond the political bounds of the 1857 Constitution. Various political plans articulated demands for socio-economic reform. Carranza&#x27;s Constitutionalist faction emerged victorious in 1915, having defeated Huerta&#x27;s regime and then the bloody civil war between the revolutionary faction of Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Historian Alan Knight contends that the new constitution was &quot;a means to confer legitimacy on a shaky regime.&quot;

Carranza initially envisioned revisions to the 1857 Constitution that would incorporate the demands for which revolutionaries fought. Carranza&#x27;s 1913 Plan of Guadalupe and its subsequent updates did not include demands for a new constitution, but his advisors persuaded him that the best way forward was a new constitution rather than a piecemeal revision of the earlier Constitution. He had initially floated the idea of a constitutional convention in September 1913, but had not pursued the idea in the thick of revolutionary struggle, but once he had consolidated power, he formally and publicly articulated the idea. Writing in February 1915, he stated &quot;When peace is established, I shall convoke a Congress duly elected by all people which shall have the character of a &quot;congreso constituyente&quot; for raising constitutional precepts the reforms dictated during the struggle.&quot; persuaded Carranza that a new constitution was the best way to return to rule of law, through a new governing document. Carranza agreed, allowing Palavicini to launch a press campaign to win over Mexicans, and especially the revolutionary army generals, to the idea.

Palavicini argued that incorporating revolutionary reforms into a new constitution would give them firm standing in the present and future that could be overturned easily. Once a new legislature was convened, legislators could more effect reforms efficiently since they were part of the constitution already. The Constitution of 1857 had subordinated the executive branch to the legislative, in an attempt to curtail the power of strong presidents. The liberal general Porfirio Díaz when president for more than three decades made the legislature and the courts subordinate to his executive power while the Constitution of 1857 remained in effect in theory, but not in practice. Palavicini argued that the process of amending the constitution would be time-consuming and piecemeal. Since the multiple major revolutionary reforms were not part of the 1857 Constitution, adding them would entail further complexity. A new constitution drafted by elected delegates would give legitimacy to the new charter, arguing for a constituent congress. Although there was some resistance to the idea, the revolutionaries recognized the &quot;right of revolution&quot;, that having won the conflict, the victors could have their way in creating the new document.

===Constitutional Convention===
Carranza convoked a congress specifically to revise the liberal constitution of 1857, but the process created a more sweeping, new document. The Constitution was drafted in Querétaro, not the capital. Carranza chose the site because it was where Emperor Maximilian of Mexico was executed, bringing to an end the Second French Intervention in 1867. Another view is that Mexico City was too conservative and Carranza chose the provincial capital of Querétaro because it was a quiet, peaceful place for such an important meeting. The congress formally opened in November 1916, with delegate elections and then a credentials fight preceding that; the final draft was approved on 5 February 1917.

Unlike the earlier congresses that produced the 1824 Mexican Constitution and the 1857 Constitution over a lengthy period, the Constituent Congress produced the final draft in a matter of a few months, between November 1916 and February 1917. According to Alan Knight, the immediacy with which the document was drafted and Carranza&#x27;s acceptance of some radical provisions &quot;suggests that what Carranza and his colleagues chiefly wanted was &quot;a&quot; Constitution, the hypothetical contents of which could be later reviewed, rewritten and ignored (all of which happened).&quot; Another factor may have been that the forces of General Pancho Villa remained an active threat to the Constitutionalist regime. In December 1916, Villa captured the important city of Torreón, which historian Adolfo Gilly contends &quot;revealed the still-hot embers of peasant war and mass discontent with the whole reactionary policy followed by Carranza in 1916.&quot;

====Delegates====
Delegates to the congress were to be elected, with one per jurisdiction that had existed in 1912, when congressional elections had been held during the Francisco I. Madero presidency. Those who had been &quot;hostile to the Constitutionalist Cause&quot; were banned from participating, but voting was by universal manhood suffrage. Carranza was pressured to amnesty those who had been hostile as well as allow those who had gone into exile to return to Mexico, but he refused. Carranza excluded the villista and zapatista factions from this congress; however, the demands, and political pressure, of these factions pushed the delegates to adopt social demands not originally in Carranza&#x27;s plan –i.e. articles 27 and 123 that spoke to the demands of peasants and workers who had fought for their rights.

The membership of the Congress was not representative of all regions, classes, or political stripes in Mexico. The 220 delegates were all Carrancistas, since the Constitutionalist faction had been victorious militarily; but that did not mean they were of one mind. Most delegates were middle class, not workers or peasants. Middle class professionals predominated, with lawyers, teachers, engineers, doctors, and journalists. A small but significant group of delegates were revolutionary generals, including Francisco José Múgica and Candido Aguilar, Carranza&#x27;s son-in-law. The predominantly civilian composition of the Constituent Congress was in contrast with the place of real power in revolutionary Mexico, which was in the military. Most senior generals did not participate directly in the congress. An exception was Álvaro Obregón backing the progressive faction, although indirectly. &quot;Of the members of the high command, it was Obregón who best understood that military victory had to be consolidated through major concessions to crucial revolutionary forces.&quot; Historian of the Querétaro convention, E.V. Niemeyer, compiled a roster of delegates, with the names of delegates and information on the age, state from which delegates were elected, and their occupation, profession, or military rank. Villa&#x27;s home state of Chihuahua had only one delegate., while Morelos, Zapata&#x27;s home state, had two. Enrique Krauze, in his book &quot;Biography of Power&quot;, states the Constituent Congress contained 85 conservatives and centrists close to Carranza&#x27;s brand of liberalism, and 132 more radical delegates.

An important group of delegates elected to the congress were the &quot;Bloc Renovador&quot;, who had been elected in 1912 to the Mexican legislature during Madero&#x27;s presidency. Some considered them tainted for their continuing to serve during Victoriano Huerta&#x27;s regime (February 1913-July 1914). Although some had voted to accept Madero&#x27;s forced resignation from the presidency, in a failed move to save his life, this group had blocked Huerta&#x27;s moves in the legislature to the point that in October 1913 Huerta dissolved congress and ruled as a dictator. Some congressmen fled Mexico, others were jailed by Huerta. With the Constitutionalist victory, some &quot;Renovadores&quot;, namely Alfonso Cravioto, José Natividad Macías, Félix F. Palavicini, and Luis Manuel Rojas, were now ready to serve in the Constituent Congress to draft the new constitution. There was opposition to them from other Carrancistas for their history of serving in the Huerta regime and those opponents attempted to block their being seated as delegates. Carranza supported the &quot;Renovadores&quot;, saying he had instructed them to continue serving in Congress during the Huerta regime as a way to gather information about the regime and to block its attempts to act constitutionally. At the Constituent Congress, there were bitter fights over the seating of particular delegates, so that the division between the &quot;Renovadores&quot; and a more radical group of leftists (sometimes called &quot;Obregonistas&quot;) was sharp even before the congress actually opened. The most bitter fight was over the seating of Palavicini, which was finally settled in a closed session. Carranza&#x27;s foreign minister and son-in-law, revolutionary General Cándido Aguilar, brought the matter to conclusion by saying that the Constituent Congress was losing time with the debate of Palavincini, while Villa remained strong in Chihuahua and the United States might intervene in Mexico to oppose the new constitution.

====Carranza&#x27;s draft constitution====
Carranza himself submitted a full draft revision of the constitution on 1 December 1916, but the proposed revisions &quot;reflected little of the turmoil that had been going on for the past four years. It was indeed simply a rewording and reorganization of the Constitution of 1857.&quot; Carranza&#x27;s advisers who had prepared the draft expected that it &quot;would serve as a starting point for the &quot;constituyentes&quot; discussions,&quot; and that &quot;no one should lose sight of the profound change taking place in our fundamental institutions.&quot; There is evidence that the &quot;people of Mexico City were cynical: they expected the congress to rubber stamp the draft presented to it by Carranza.&quot; Delegates read Carranza&#x27;s draft, but did not accept the document that only made minor revisions to the 1857 Constitution.

===Debates===
The most highly contentious discussions were over the articles dealing with education and with the Roman Catholic Church, while the more &quot;revolutionary&quot; articles on the state&#x27;s power to expropriate and distribute resources (Article 27) and the rights of labor (Article 123) passed easily. Although the Constituent Congress has been characterized as a polarized battle of &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;radical&quot; delegates, Carranza&#x27;s advisers expected his draft to be revised. In the words of one scholar it was &quot;mauled.&quot; The drafting of the two most revolutionary articles was by a small committee and the congress voted unanimously in favor within hours of their presentation. Pastor Rouaix was the guiding hand behind the final versions of both Article 123, passed first, and Article 27. The initial draft of Article 27 was done by Andrés Molina Enríquez, author of influential 1909 work, &quot;The Great National Problems&quot;.

====Anticlericalism====
Article 3, dealing with education, was highly contentious. Carranza&#x27;s draft of Article 3 reads &quot;There is to be full liberty of instruction, but that given in official educational establishments will be secular, and the instruction imparted by these institutions will be free at both the upper and lower levels.&quot; Francisco Múgica proposed a much more strongly worded alternative. &quot;There will be liberty of instruction; but that given in official establishments of education will be secular, as will be the upper and lower primary instruction given in private schools. No religious corporation, ministry of any cult, or any person belonging to a similar association may establish or direct schools of primary instruction, nor give instruction in any school [&quot;colegio&quot;]. Private primary schools may be established only subject to the supervision of the Government. Primary instruction will be obligatory for all Mexicans, and in official establishments it will be free.&quot;

There were significant debates on the anticlerical articles of the constitution. The liberal Constitution of 1857 already restricted the Roman Catholic Church as an institution, but the constitutional revision went even further. The 1914 Convention of Aguascalientes had already brought together victorious revolutionary factions, including Constitutionalists, Zapatistas, and Villistas, but discussions there did not center on anticlericalism. However, the 1916–1917 constitutional congress had lengthy and heated debates over anticlericalism. A contention that fits the content of the debates is that for Constitutionalists anticlericalism was a nationalist rather than religious issue. The Roman Catholic Church as an institution was seen to be antiliberal and antinationalist, so that &quot;the Catholic Church was an enemy of Mexican sovereignty and an obstacle to the triumph of liberalism and progress.&quot; From this ideological viewpoint, the implementation of the Catholic Church&#x27;s agenda &quot;was exercised through its control of education, oral confession, etc.&quot;

It has been argued that Article 3 and Article 130 restricted the Catholic Church as a consequence of the support given by the Mexican Church&#x27;s hierarchy to Victoriano Huerta&#x27;s dictatorship, 
It has been argued that the Revolution did not begin in 1910 with anticlericalism as a significant issue, but emerged as one only after the victory of the Constitutionalist faction. The anticlericalism of the Constitutionalists was a part of their aim to build a strong nation-state. &quot;[D]elegates viewed the church as a political enemy to the establishment of a liberal, secular nation-state...The church seemed to be viewed by most of the delegates as a foreign body that worked against the development of a progressive and independent nation.&quot; Rather than anticlericalism being a religious stance, in this interpretation &quot;the militant anti-church stance of the congress was another expression of nationalism.&quot; But the Catholic Church had strongly supported the Huerta regime, so that the anticlerical articles in the Constitution are the negative consequences of that.

====Land reform and natural resources====
The question of the state&#x27;s power over natural resources was articulated in Article 27, which enabled the government to implement land reform and exert control over its subsoil resources, particularly oil. Article 27 states in particular that foreign citizens cannot own land at the borders or coasts as a consequence of the United States occupation of Veracruz, 
In the assessment of historian Frank Tannenbaum
 The Constitution was written by the &quot;soldiers&quot; of the Revolution, not the lawyers, who were there, but were generally the opposition. On all the crucial issues the lawyers voted against the majority of the Convention. The majority was in the hands of the soldiers -- generals, colonels, majors -- men who had marched and counter-marched across the Republic and fought its battles... The soldiers wanted, as General [Francisco] Múgica said to me, to socialize property. But they were frightened -- afraid of their own courage, of their own ideas. They found all of the learned men in the Convention opposed to them. Article 27 was a compromise.

====Labor rights====
A major victory for organized labor was the enshrining of labor rights in the Constitution. Labor had played an important role in the Constitutionalist victory, and this was its reward in Article 123. The labor article was drafted by a small committee of the congress, headed by Pastor Rouaix and José Natividad Macías. The Program of the Liberal Party of Mexico made demands for protections for labor, that were incorporated into the labor article.

====Women&#x27;s suffrage====
The congress debated extending the vote to Mexican women. There were very active women&#x27;s suffrage movements in the U.S. and Britain. While not as strong in Mexico, there were activists for the cause. Hermila Galindo, a strong supporter of Carranza, requested the convention to consider extending the vote to women for representatives for the lower house of the legislature. The request was conveyed to a committee. Article 35 specifying the rights and privileges of Mexican citizens could have been extended to include full rights for women, but the committee went out of its way to explicitly deny women those rights. Carranza was an advocate of women&#x27;s rights as was his advisor and delegate to the congress, Palavicini. Palavicini questioned the committee chair for not including women&#x27;s suffrage, but the chair deflected, saying the committee did not take the question of women&#x27;s suffrage into consideration. In fact, the committee had stated explicitly why they did not extend women the vote. &quot;women ... do not feel the need to participate in public affairs, as is shown by the lack of all organized movement toward that end; ... political rights are not based on the nature of the human being but on the regulatory functions of the State, on the functions that it must exercise in order to maintain the coexistence of natural rights of all; under the conditions in which Mexican society finds itself, the granting of the vote to women is considered unnecessary.&quot; Those opposing women&#x27;s suffrage thought that women were under the influence of the Catholic Church, so enfranchising them would give power to the Church, but this opinion was not explicitly found in the records of the debate. Women would not achieve the vote in Mexico until 1953.

====Prohibition of alcohol and bullfighting====
Delegates debated social reforms of popular practices deemed as detrimental to the public health of Mexicans. Prohibition of the manufacture and consumption of alcohol had been included as an amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, repealed in 1933 as a failure, but the idea was in the air. Although Mexican delegates did not think enforcement would be easy, it was argued by proponents that enshrining it in the constitution would give prohibition due respect. It was considered in the draft of Article 4, but resoundingly defeated by delegates 145–7. Article 123 dealing with labor, prohibited sale of alcoholic beverages and the establishment of gambling houses in workers&#x27; centers, so further debates on prohibition had a chance of passage. Arguments for prohibition were voiced over the loss of revenues that taxing taverns and drink brought in, its contribution to criminality, and undermining public health. In the end, prohibition of alcohol generally was not incorporated into the constitution. Delegate General Múgica made an all-out effort to include the ban, but realized it would not pass. An attempt to prohibit bullfighting was given short shrift, considered a Mexican cultural celebration.

===Influences===

The Liberal Party of Mexico&#x27;s (PLM) 1906 political program proposed a number of reforms that were incorporated into the 1917 Constitution. Article 123 incorporated its demands for the 8-hour day, minimum wage, hygienic working conditions, prohibitions on abuse of sharecroppers, payment of wages in cash, not scrip, banning of company stores, and Sunday as an obligatory day of rest. Article 27 of the Constitution incorporated some of the PLM&#x27;s demands for land reform in Mexico. Requiring landowners to make all their land productive, and if left idle, subject to government expropriation; the granting of a fixed amount of land to anyone who asks for it, provided they bring it into production and not sell it. Points in the PLM&#x27;s call for improvement in education were also incorporated, such as completely secular education, compulsory attendance up until age 14, and the establishment of trade schools. Not surprisingly, the PLM also called for restrictions on the Roman Catholic Church, which were incorporated in the constitution. These included treating religious institutions as businesses and required to pay taxes; nationalization of religious institutions&#x27; real property; and the elimination of religious-run schools.

===Importance===
This constitution is the first one in world history to set out social rights, serving as a model for the Weimar Constitution of 1919 and the Russian Constitution of 1918. Articles: 3, 27, and 123 displayed profound changes in Mexican political philosophy that would help frame the political and social backdrop for the rest of the century. Article 3 established the bases for a mandatory and lay education; Article 27 led the foundation for land reform in Mexico as well as asserting state sovereignty over the nation&#x27;s subsoil rights ; and Article 123 was designed to empower the labor sector.

Its innovations were in expanding the Mexican state&#x27;s power into the realms of economic nationalism, political nationalism, protection of workers&#x27; rights, and acknowledgment of peasants&#x27; rights to land. In the assessment of E.V. Niemeyer, &quot;In contrast with the reformers of 1857, who first wrote a constitution and then defended it liberal principles on the battlefield, the early twentieth-century revolutionaries fought first and then wrote a new constitution of the land, the Constitution of 1917. In a real sense this document legalized the Mexican Revolution.&quot;

The Constitution is a living document, which has been amended a number of times. As with the earlier Constitutions, the enforcement of Constitution of 1917 has varied over the years. The Constitution of 1857 had strong anticlerical articles, but under Díaz the Catholic Church had regained much of its economic power, since he did not enforce the constitutional provisions. The anticlerical articles of the 1917 Constitution were not enforced vigorously until Plutarco Elías Calles became president in 1924, sparking the Cristero War. In the 1990s, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari called for amending the Constitution as Mexico sought to join the North American Free Trade Agreement with the U.S. and Canada. Anticlerical articles were amended as was Article 27 empowering the state over natural resources.

===Further amendments===
====Amendments on presidential terms====
The constitution was amended in 1926 to allow presidential re-elections as long as the president did not serve consecutive terms. This amendment allowed former president Álvaro Obregón to run for the presidency in 1928, an election he won, but he was assassinated before taking office. The amendment was repealed in 1934.

The Constitution was amended in 1927 to extend the president&#x27;s term for four years to six years. President Lázaro Cárdenas was the first to serve out a full six-year term, beginning in 1934 and stepping down from power in 1940.

====Amendment restricting agrarian women&#x27;s rights====
One of the major impacts of Article 27 was to empower the government to expropriate property for the good of the nation. This tool was used to break up large landed estates and created ejidos, small-scale, inalienable peasant holdings. In 1927, Article 27 was revised to restrict the rights of peasant women to hold ejidos in their own name, unless they were &quot;the sole support of the family unit.&quot; Female holders of ejidos lost their ejido rights if they married another ejidatario. &quot;Essentially, land was viewed as a family resource, with only one ejido membership allotted per family.&quot; In 1971, these restrictions were removed via the &quot;Ley de Reforma Agraria&quot; (Agrarian Reform Law), so that spouses and their children could inherit.

The 1992 amendment to Article 27 that allowed ejidos to be converted to private property and sold were designed to create a market in real estate and allow for the creation of larger, more productive agricultural enterprises. Women were seen to be more vulnerable economically with this change since they were a small proportion of ejidatarios. In practice, in one 2002 study of four different site, despite the change in the law, women (mothers and widows) retained considerable economic status within the family.

====Anticlerical articles and the 1934 and 1946 Amendments====
Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, and 130 as originally enacted in 1917 were anticlerical and restricted the role of the Roman Catholic Church in Mexico, as well as other organized churches. Although it has been argued that these restrictions were included in part due to a desire by anticlerical framers to punish the Mexican Church&#x27;s hierarchy for its support of Victoriano Huerta, the Mexican Constitution of 1857 enacted during the Liberal Reform in Mexico, already significantly curtailed the role of religious institutions.

Article 3 required that education, in both public and private schools be completely secular and free of any religious instruction and prohibited religions from participating in education essentially outlawing Catholic schools or even religious education in private schools. Article 3 likewise prohibited ministers or religious groups from aiding the poor, engaging in scientific research, and spreading their teachings. The constitution prohibited churches to own property and transferred all church property to the state, thus making all houses of worship state property.

Article 130 denied churches any kind of legal status and allowed local legislators to limit the number of ministers, (essentially giving the state the ability to restrict religious institutions) and banned any ministers not born in Mexico. It denied ministers freedom of association, the right to vote and freedom of speech, prohibiting them and religious publications from criticizing the law or government.

Presidents Venustiano Carranza (1917–1920) and Alvaro Obregón (1920–1924) did not implement the anticlerical articles of the constitution, which was the stance that Porfirio Díaz had taken with the anticlerical articles of the 1857 Constitution and the Catholic Church. 

Starting in 1926 President Plutarco Elías Calles (1924–1928) sought to enforce them. In 1926 Pope Pius XI, in the encyclical &quot;Acerba animi&quot;, stated that the anticlerical articles of the constitution were &quot;seriously derogatory to the most elementary and inalienable rights of the Church and of the faithful&quot; and that both he and his predecessor had endeavored to avoid their application by the Mexican government.

The escalation of church-state tensions led to fierce regional violence known as the Cristero War. Some scholars have characterized the constitution in this era as a &quot;hostile&quot; approach to the issue of church and state separation. Although the Cristero War came to an end in 1929, with U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Dwight Morrow acting as mediator between the Mexican government and the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church, the end of the violent conflict did not result in constitutional changes.

The constitution was made even more anticlerical from 1934 to 1946, when an amendment mandating socialist education was in effect. On 13 December 1934 Article 3 now mandated socialist education, which &quot;in addition to removing all religious doctrine&quot; was to &quot;combat fanaticism and prejudices&quot;, &quot;build[ing] in the youth a rational and exact concept of the universe and of social life&quot;. In 1946 socialist education was formally removed from the constitution and the document returned to the generalized secular education. In practice, however, socialist education ended with President Manuel Avila Camacho, who said at the beginning of his presidential term in 1940 &quot;I am a [religious] believer&quot; (&quot;Soy creyente&quot;), signaling the end of the enforcement of the anticlerical articles.

The inconsistency in enforcement meant that even though the constitution prohibited any worship outside of a church building, which made Pope John Paul II&#x27;s outdoor Masses and other religious celebrations during his 1980 and 1990 visits illegal acts, the government turned a blind eye. The anticlerical articles remained in the Constitution until the reforms of 1992.

====Constitutional reform of anticlerical articles and land reform under Salinas====

In his inaugural address, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari (1988–1994) announced a program to &quot;modernize&quot; Mexico via structural transformation. &quot;The modern state is a state which ... maintains transparency and updates its relation with political parties, entrepreneurial groups, and the church.&quot; His declaration was more an articulation of the direction of change, but not list of specifics.

The implementation of reforms entailed amending the constitution, which required overcoming opposition on the Left as well as in the Catholic Church itself. After considerable debate, the Mexican legislature voted for these fundamental revisions in Church-State policy.

The Constitution of 1917 had several anticlerical restrictions. Article 5 restricted the existence of religious orders; Article 24 restricted church services outside of church buildings; Article 27 which empowered the State over fundamental aspects of property ownership and resulted in expropriation and distribution of lands, while limiting the right to sell communally-held ejido lands, and most famously in 1938, the expropriation of foreign oil companies. Article 27 also prevented churches from holding real property at all. For the Catholic hierarchy, Article 130 prevented the recognition of the Church as a legal entity, denied to clergy the exercise of political rights, and prevented the Church from participating in any way in political matters.

The Church had contested all these restrictions from the beginning. With the possibility of changed relations between Church and State, &quot;the main demand of the Catholic hierarchy was centered on the modification of Article 130&quot; to recognize the Church as a legal entity, restore political rights to priests, and to end restrictions &quot;on the social actions of the Church and its members.&quot;

The initial reaction to changing the constitution was quite negative from members of the Institutional Revolutionary Party who saw anticlericalism as an inherent element of post-Revolution Mexico. It was clear that given the contested nature of the 1988 elections that Salinas could not expect to operate with a mandate for his program. However, the debate was now open. Leftists led by Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas opposed any change in the anticlerical articles of the constitution, since they were seen as the foundation for the power of the secular state. However, the National Action Party in alliance with the weakened PRI became allies to move toward fundamental reforms.

The Vatican likely sensed a sea-change in the Mexican ruling party&#x27;s stance on anticlericalism. In 1990, John Paul II visited Mexico, his first since 1979 for the Puebla conference of Latin American bishops. After the announcement of his intentions, the Mexican Minister of the Interior (&quot;Gobernación&quot;) stated flatly that the government would not amend Article 130. Nonetheless, the Mexican government began moves to normalize diplomatic relations with the Vatican. The pope&#x27;s second 1990 trip in May put increased pressure on the Mexican government to take steps toward normalization, particularly after the Vatican and the Soviet Union did so that year. Although Salinas planned a trip to the Vatican in 1991, the Catholic hierarchy in Mexico did not want normalization of relations with the Vatican without discussion of significant changes to the constitution.

An even more significant change came in Salinas&#x27;s official state of the nation address in November 1991. He stated that &quot;the moment has come to promote new judicial proceedings for the churches,&quot; which were impelled by the need &quot;to reconcile the definitive secularization of our society with effective religious freedom.&quot; The government proposed changes to the constitution to &quot;respect freedom of religion,&quot; but reaffirmed the separation of Church and State, keeping in place secular public education, as well as restrictions on clerics&#x27; political participation in civic life and wealth accumulation.

The bill to amend the constitution was submitted to the legislature to reform Articles 3, 5, 24, and 130. The bill passed in December 1991 with the support of the conservative National Action Party (PAN). The enabling legislation was debated far more than the initial bill, but in July 1992, the enabling legislation, &quot;Ley de Asociaciones Religiosas y Culto Público&quot; (Religious Associations Act), passed 408–10. The leftist Partido Revolucionario Democrático struggled with whether to support this significant change to Mexico&#x27;s anticlericalism, but most PRD legislators did in the end.

The constitution still does not accord full religious freedom as recognized by the various human rights declarations and conventions. Specifically, outdoor worship is still prohibited and only allowed in exceptional circumstances, generally requiring government permission, religious organizations are not permitted to own print or electronic media outlets, government permission is required to broadcast religious ceremonies, and ministers are prohibited from being political candidates or holding public office.

The end of constitutional support for land reform was part of a larger program of neoliberal economic restructuring that had already been weakening support for ejidal and other forms of small-scale agriculture and negotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the modifications of Article 27 also permit the privatization and the sale of ejidal land and was a direct cause of the Chiapas conflict.

In 2009, it was reported that changes to the ejidal system have largely failed to improve ejidal productivity. The changes have been implicated as significant contributing factors to worsening rural poverty, forced migration, and the conversion of Mexico, where the cultivation of maize originated, into a net-importer of maize and food in general.

====Capital punishment and 2005 amendment====
On 8 November 2005, The Senate of Mexico adopted a final decree amending the Constitution as approved by the majority of the Federated States, modifying Articles 14 and 22 of said Constitution banning the use of capital punishment in its entirety within Mexican territory.

====Constitutional right to food, 2011====
Article 4 and Article 27 were revised to guarantee the right of food In Mexico. &quot;[T]he State has an obligation to guarantee the right [to food]... and to assure sufficient supply of basic foods through integral and sustainable development (Article 27).&quot; The formal language is &quot;Article 4: Every person has the right to adequate food to maintain his or her wellbeing and physical, emotional and intellectual development. The State must guarantee this right.&quot; For Article 27, Clause XX, the revision is &quot;Sustainable and integral rural development (...) will also have among its objectives that the State guarantee sufficient and timely supply of basic foods as established by law.&quot;

==Current articles of the constitution==

The main ideas or an abstract of the current contents of the articles of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States is as follows. Not all articles are presented on this page. (See the External links section below for links to the full text in English and Spanish.)

===Article 1===
This article states that every individual in Mexico (official name, Estados Unidos Mexicanos or United Mexican States) has the rights that the Constitution gives. These rights cannot be denied and they cannot be suspended. Slavery is illegal in Mexico; any slaves from abroad who enter national territory will, by this mere act, be freed and given the full protection of the law. All types of discrimination whether it be for ethnic origin, national origin, gender, age, different capacities, social condition, health condition, religion, opinions, sexual preferences, or civil state or any other which attacks human dignity and has as an objective to destroy the rights and liberties of the people are forbidden.

===Article 2===
This article states the nature of the Mexican nation.

The Mexican nation is unique and indivisible. The nation is pluricultural based originally on its indigenous people which are those that are descendants of the people that lived in the current territory of the country at the beginning of the colonization and that preserve their own social, economic, cultural, political institutions. The awareness of their indigenous identity should be fundamental criteria to determine to whom the dispositions over indigenous tribes are applied. They are integral communities of an indigenous tribe that form a social, economic and cultural organization.

===Article 3===
The education imparted by the Federal State shall be designed to develop harmoniously all the faculties of the human being and shall foster in him at the same time a love of country and a consciousness of international solidarity, in independence and justice. Said education must be free of bias. (As per the full definition of the word &quot;&quot; as used in the original document).

I. According to the religious liberties established under article 24, educational services shall be secular and, therefore, free of any religious orientation.
II. The educational services shall be based on scientific progress and shall fight against ignorance, ignorance&#x27;s effects, servitudes, fanaticism and prejudice.

It shall be democratic, considering democracy not only as a legal structure and a political regimen, but as a system of life founded on a constant economic, social, and cultural betterment of the people;

It shall be national insofar as without hostility or exclusiveness it shall achieve the understanding of our problems, the utilization of our resources, the defense of our political independence, the assurance of our economic independence, and the continuity and growth of our culture; and it shall contribute to better human relationships, not only with the elements which it contributes toward strengthening and at the same time inculcating, together with respect for the dignity of the person and the integrity of the family, the conviction of the general interest of society, but also by the care which it devotes to the ideals of brotherhood and equality of rights of all men, avoiding privileges of race, creed, class, sex, or persons.

Private persons may engage in education of all kinds and grades. But as regards elementary, secondary, and normal education (and that of any kind or grade designed for laborers and farm workers) they must previously obtain, in every case, the express authorization of the public power. Such authorization may be refused or revoked by decisions against which there can be no judicial proceedings or recourse.

Private institutions devoted to education of the kinds and grades specified in the preceding section must be without exception in conformity with the provisions of sections I and II of the first paragraph of this article and must also be in harmony with official plans and programs.

Religious corporations, ministers of religion, stock companies which exclusively or predominantly engage in educational activities, and associations or companies devoted to the propagation of any religious creed shall not in any way participate in institutions giving elementary, secondary and normal education and education for laborers or field workers. The State may in its discretion withdraw at any time the recognition of official validity of studies conducted in private institutions.

Elementary education shall be compulsory.

All education given by the State shall be free.

The Congress of the Union, with a view to unifying and coordinating education throughout the Republic, shall issue the necessary laws for dividing the social function of education among the Federation, the States and the Municipalities, for fixing the appropriate financial allocations for this public service and for establishing the penalties applicable to officials who do not comply with or enforce the pertinent provisions, as well as the penalties applicable to all those who infringe such provisions.

===Article 4===
All people, men and women, are equal under the law. This article also grants all people protection to their health, a right to housing, and rights for children. Everyone has a right to an appropriate ecosystem for their development &amp; welfare.

===Article 5===
All Citizens of the United Mexican States are free to work in the profession of their choosing, as long as it does not attack the rights of others.

===Article 6===
This article establishes freedom for the expression of ideas with limitations for speech that is morally offensive, infringes on others&#x27; rights, or encourages crime or public disorder.

===Article 7===
This article states that no law or authority can &quot;previously&quot; censor the press, or ask for a bail to the authors or printers. The freedom of the press has its limits in respect to private life, morality, and public peace. Incarceration or censorship cannot occur before charges of &quot;press crimes&quot; can be proven, but it can happen when responsibility has been judicially established. In no case shall printers be seized as crimes&#x27; instruments.

===Article 8===
Public functionaries and employees will respect the public exercise to their right to petition, as long as it is formulated in writing, in a peaceful and respectful manner. In political petitioning, only citizens of the republic have this right.

===Article 9===
Only citizens of the Republic of Mexico may take part in the political affairs of the country.

===Article 10===
Inhabitants of the Republic may, for their protection, own guns and arms in their homes. Only arms approved by the Army may be owned, and federal law will state the manner in which they can be used. (Firearms are prohibited from importation into the Republic without proper licensing and documentation. Foreigners may not pass the border with unlicensed firearms; the commission of such act is a felony, punishable by prison term. See Gun politics in Mexico.)

===Article 11===
&quot;Everyone has the right to enter the Republic, exit it, travel through its territory, and change his residence without the need of a security card, passport, or any similar device. The exercise of this right will be subordinated to the faculties of judicial authority, in the cases of criminal or civil responsibility, and to the limits of the administrative authorities, on the limits imposed by laws on emigration, immigration, and health safety laws in the Republic, or over foreigners residing in our country.&quot;

===Article 12===
The Mexican state does not have a peerage and cannot confer a title of nobility upon any person. (The Mexican Congress does confer awards such as the Order of the Aztec Eagle to notable persons.)

===Article 13===
There are no private courts (i.e.: feudal or manorial courts) in Mexico. Military courts-martial cannot be used to judge civilians.

===Article 14===
Prohibits the enactment of ex post facto (retroactive) laws. All persons punished under the law are entitled to due process, punishments must follow what is dictated by written law. Note that due process under Mexican law is not the same as US law as Mexico is not a common law country.

===Article 15===
Disallows international treaties for extradition when the person to be extradited is politically persecuted, or accused while having the condition of slave, or when the foreign country contravenes the civil rights granted in the Mexican constitution (like the right to life and the abolishment of the death penalty in Article 22).

===Article 16===
&quot;In cases of flagrante delicto, any person may arrest the offender and his accomplices, turning them over without delay to the nearest authorities.&quot; In other words, a citizen&#x27;s arrest is allowed (as distinct from vigilante justice, prohibited in the next article).

===Article 17===
Prohibits vigilante justice, all civil and criminal disputes must be resolved before courts. Mandates speedy trials in both civil and criminal matters. Prohibits levying of &quot;court costs&quot; and fees, judicial service is free to all parties. Courts are to be free and independent. Imprisonment for debts is prohibited. This article makes provisions relating to arrest and imprisonment. The article&#x27;s emphasis on &quot;social readjustment of the offender&quot; was interpreted for a time after 2001 as forbidding sentences of life imprisonment, which led to the refusal of some extradition requests from the United States.

===Article 18===
Mandates gender segregation of inmates and separation of those held for trial from those who have been convicted. Limits the government&#x27;s authority to arrest only those suspected of crimes for which imprisonment is an allowed punishment.

===Article 19===
Prohibits detention in excess of 72 hours (3 days) without formal charges. Mandates due process for imprisonable charges. Separate crimes discovered during an investigation must be charged separately. Mistreatment during detention by authorities, all discomforts that are inflicted without legal motive, and all fees or contributions (forced bribes) in jails are abuses that will be prohibited by law and curbed by the authorities.

===Article 20===
Allows people charged to remain silent.

===Article 21===
Crime investigation corresponds to the Public Ministry and different police corps, which will be under the command of whoever is in the exercise of that function.
This article proceeds to explain the functions of the Public Ministry, police, and trials.

===Article 22===
Cruel and unusual punishment is prohibited. Specifically, penalties of death, mutilation, infamy, marks, physical punishments, torments, excessive fines, confiscation of assets, and others are abolished.

Confiscation of assets does not include the application of said assets to pay for civil responsibilities caused by a crime, or when used to pay taxes or other fines. Nor will it be confiscation when said assets are part of illegal activities, or when they are related to organized crime, or when proof of ownership cannot be established.

===Article 23===
No trial should have more than three instances. No one can be judged twice for the same crime, whether the person is declared guilty or non-guilty.

===Article 24===
&quot;Every man is free to pursue the religious belief that best suits him, and to practice its ceremonies, devotions or cults, as long as they do not constitute a crime. Congress cannot dictate laws that establish or abolish any given religion. Ordinarily, all religious acts will be practiced in temples, and those that extraordinarily are practiced outside temples must adhere to law.&quot;

===Article 25===
The State will plan, determine, and carry out the development of the Nation, so that it guarantees its integrity, strengthens national sovereignty, and allows for a broader exercise of freedom and dignity of the individuals through an economic growth that distributes wealth with justice.

===Article 26===
The State will encourage the development of democracy which will support economic growth.

===Article 27===
The property of all land and water within national territory is originally owned by the Nation, who has the right to transfer this ownership to particulars. Hence, private property is a privilege created by the Nation.

Expropriations may only be made when there is a public utility cause.

The State will always have the right to impose on private property constraints dictated by &quot;public interest&quot;. The State will also regulate the exploitation of natural resources based on social benefits and the equal distribution of wealth. The state is also responsible for conservation and ecological considerations.

All natural resources in national territory are property of the nation, and private exploitation may only be carried out through concessions.

Nuclear fuel may only be exploited and used by the State. The use of Nuclear elements in the Nation may only have peaceful purposes (i.e. Mexico cannot build nuclear weapons).

This article also deals with other subtleties on what constitutes Mexico&#x27;s territory.

Foreign nationals cannot own land within 100 km of the borders or 50 km of the coast; however, foreigners can have a beneficial interest in such land through a trust (fideicomiso), where the legal ownership of the land is held by a Mexican financial institution. The only precondition &quot;sine qua non&quot; to granting such a beneficial interest is that the foreigner agree that all matters relating to such land are the exclusive domain of Mexican courts and Mexican jurisdiction, and that in all issues pertaining to such land, the foreigner will conduct him or herself as a Mexican, and settle any issues arising from their interest in such land exclusively through Mexican courts and institutions. The stipulated consequence of a failure to abide by these terms is forfeiture to the nation of their interests in all lands where the foreigner has such beneficial interests.

That an area of land at the coast (20 meters from the highest tide line) is federal property that cannot be sold.

===Article 28===
All monopolies are prohibited.

The areas of the economy in direct control of the government, such as post, telegraph, oil and its derivatives, basic petrochemical industries, radioactive minerals, and the generation of electricity are not considered to be monopolies.

The State will protect areas of priority in the economy, such as satellite communications and railroads.

The Nation will have a Central Bank with the primary objective of procuring the stability of the national currency. The Central Bank and its activities will not be considered monopolies either.

Unions and workers associations will not be considered monopolies. Guilds will not be considered to be monopolies when their purpose is the economic equality of the industry, as long as the guild is overseen by the Federal Government.

Copyrights and patents will not be considered monopolies.

===Article 29===
&quot;In the case of an invasion, a serious disrupt of public peace or any event that puts society in danger or conflict, only the President of the United Mexican States, in accordance with the Secretaries of State and the General Attorney of the Republic, and with approval of the Congress of the Union and, on its recesses, the Permanent Commission, may suspend in all the country or in a specific place any guarantee which were an obstacle to face quickly and easily the situation; but the president shall only do it for a limited time. If the suspension had place when the Congress is gathered, then the Congress will grant any authorization that it deems necessary for the Executive to face the situation.&quot;

===Article 30===
This article speaks about the Mexican nationality.

===Article 31===
This article speaks about obligations of Mexicans.

===Article 32===
&quot;Mexicans shall have priority over foreigners under equality of circumstances for all classes of concessions and for all employment, positions, or commissions of the Government in which the status of citizenship is not indispensable.&quot; Foreigners, immigrants, and even naturalized citizens of Mexico may not serve as military officers, Mexican-flagged ship and airline crew, or chiefs of seaports and airports.

===Article 33===
&quot;The Federal Executive shall have the exclusive power to compel any foreigner whose remaining he may deem inexpedient to abandon the national territory immediately and without the necessity of previous legal action.&quot; It also states: &quot;Foreigners may not in any way participate in the political affairs of the country.&quot;

=== Article 34 ===
About Mexican Citizenship.

=== Article 39 ===
National sovereignty is bestowed essentially and originally upon the people. Every public power derives from the people and is instituted for their benefit. The people possess, at all times, the inalienable right to alter or change their form of government.

===Article 55===
A deputy or senator must be &quot;a Mexican citizen by birth.&quot;

===Article 91===
Cabinet officers must be Mexicans by birth.

===Article 95===
Supreme Court justices must be Mexican by birth.

===Article 123===
Covers the rights of workers, including the eight-hour work day, the right to strike, the right to a day&#x27;s rest per week, and the right to a proper indemnification following unjustified termination of the working relationship by the employer. This article also established equality regardless of race or gender. The language of the draft passed in 1917 restricted the employment of women in dangerous industries or in work after 10 p.m.; there were provisions for prenatal relief from onerous work three months before birth and one month following birth, as well as provisions to allow mothers to nurse their babies.

Article 123 was perhaps the most radical of the provisions of the 1917 Constitution and was intended to give the working class a relief to the many abuses and hardships they had previously faced from uncontrolled labour managers. Although Venustiano Carranza had not intended to codify labour protection in the constitution, congressmen who supported the working-class successfully pushed for it to be included.

===Article 130===
States that church(es) and state are to remain separate. It provides for the obligatory state registration of all &quot;churches and religious groupings&quot; and places a series of restrictions on priests and ministers of all religions (ineligible to hold public office, to campaign on behalf of political parties or candidates, to inherit from persons other than close blood relatives, etc.).

<doc id="671489" wikidata="Q423003" url="?curid=671489" title="Busy waiting">
<text>In computer science and software engineering, busy-waiting, busy-looping or spinning is a technique in which a process repeatedly checks to see if a condition is true, such as whether keyboard input or a lock is available. Spinning can also be used to generate an arbitrary time delay, a technique that was necessary on systems that lacked a method of waiting a specific length of time. Processor speeds vary greatly from computer to computer, especially as some processors are designed to dynamically adjust speed based on current workload. Consequently, spinning as a time-delay technique can produce inconsistent or even unpredictable results on different systems unless code is included to determine the time a processor takes to execute a &quot;do nothing&quot; loop, or the looping code explicitly checks a real-time clock.

In most cases spinning is considered an anti-pattern and should be avoided, as processor time that could be used to execute a different task is instead wasted on useless activity. Spinning can be a valid strategy in certain circumstances, most notably in the implementation of spinlocks within operating systems designed to run on SMP systems.

==Example C code==
The following C code examples illustrate two threads that share a global integer i. The first thread uses busy-waiting to check for a change in the value of i:
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdatomic.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

/* i is global, so it is visible to all functions. It makes use of the special
 * type atomic_int, which allows atomic memory accesses.
atomic_int i = 0;

/* f1 uses a spinlock to wait for i to change from 0. */
static void *f1(void *p)
 int local_i;
 /* Atomically load current value of i into local_i and check if that value
 is zero */
 while ((local_i = atomic_load(&amp;i)) == 0) {
 /* do nothing - just keep checking over and over */

 printf(&quot;i&#x27;s value has changed to %d.\n&quot;, local_i);
 return NULL;

static void *f2(void *p)
 int local_i = 99;
 sleep(10); /* sleep for 10 seconds */
 atomic_store(&amp;i, local_i);
 printf(&quot;t2 has changed the value of i to %d.\n&quot;, local_i);
 return NULL;

int main()
 int rc;
 pthread_t t1, t2;

 rc = pthread_create(&amp;t1, NULL, f1, NULL);
 if (rc != 0) {
 fprintf(stderr, &quot;pthread f1 failed\n&quot;);
 return EXIT_FAILURE;

 rc = pthread_create(&amp;t2, NULL, f2, NULL);
 if (rc != 0) {
 fprintf(stderr, &quot;pthread f2 failed\n&quot;);
 return EXIT_FAILURE;

 pthread_join(t1, NULL);
 pthread_join(t2, NULL);
 puts(&quot;All pthreads finished.&quot;);
 return 0;

In a use case like this, one can consider using C11&#x27;s condition variables.

== Alternatives ==
Most operating systems and threading libraries provide a variety of system calls that will block the process on an event, such as lock acquisition, timer changes, I/O availability or signals. Using such calls generally produces the simplest, most efficient, fair, and race-free result. A single call checks, informs the scheduler of the event it is waiting for, inserts a memory barrier where applicable, and may perform a requested I/O operation before returning. Other processes can use the CPU while the caller is blocked. The scheduler is given the information needed to implement priority inheritance or other mechanisms to avoid starvation.

Busy-waiting itself can be made much less wasteful by using a delay function (e.g., codice_1) found in most operating systems. This puts a thread to sleep for a specified time, during which the thread will waste no CPU time. If the loop is checking something simple then it will spend most of its time asleep and will waste very little CPU time.

In programs that never end (such as operating systems), infinite busy waiting can be implemented by using unconditional jumps as shown by this NASM syntax: jmp $. The CPU will unconditionally jump to its own position forever. A busy wait like this can be replaced with:

sleep:
hlt
jmp sleep
For more information, see HLT (x86 instruction).

== Appropriate usage ==

In low-level programming, busy-waits may actually be desirable. It may not be desirable or practical to implement interrupt-driven processing for every hardware device, particularly those that are seldom accessed. Sometimes it is necessary to write some sort of control data to hardware and then fetch device status resulting from the write operation, status that may not become valid until a number of machine cycles have elapsed following the write. The programmer could call an operating system delay function, but doing so may consume more time than would be expended in spinning for a few clock cycles waiting for the device to return its status.

<text>The City of Stirling is a local government area in the northern suburbs of the Western Australian capital city of Perth about north of Perth&#x27;s central business district. The City covers an area of and has a population of over 223,000, making it the largest local government area by population in Western Australia.

==History==
Stirling was established on 24 January 1871 as the Perth Road District under the &quot;District Roads Act 1871&quot;. The district at that time included what are now the Cities of Wanneroo, Joondalup, Bayswater and Belmont.

With the passage of the &quot;Local Government Act 1960&quot;, which reformed all road districts into shires, it became the Shire of Perth on 1 July 1961. The Shire of Perth had a population of 84,000 in 1961. It was declared a city and renamed Stirling on 24 January 1971.

At a meeting of electors in May 2021, electors passed a motion that the City of Stirling be renamed, causing it to be considered at the next council meeting. The rationale for the name change is the personal involvement of James Stirling, the first governor of Western Australia and the namesake of the city, in the Pinjarra Massacre on 28 October 1834. Following the well-conceived ambush and subsequent massacre of 15 to 80 Binjareb Noongar men, women, and children lasting at least one hour that Stirling led personally, Stirling threatened the Noongar people with genocide should they continue to resist colonisation. Historian Chris Owen has argued that James Stirling&#x27;s involvement in the Pinjarra massacre was on the historical record, and &quot;there&#x27;s no ambiguity in it any more, Stirling set out to punish the Noongar tribe down there for blocking expansion of the colony. He told everyone what he was going to do, went down there, did it and reported on it.&quot; 

The motion made national news, and sparked a barrage of hateful messages towards the City of Stirling. Among suggestions was for a dual name to be adopted, involving a Noongar name. A report released by the city two weeks later stated that the name change was not a priority, and that there were significant costs associated with any name change. At the council meeting on 8 June 2021, arguments were put forth either way, with one councillor saying &quot;while nobody condoned historical atrocities, a name change would cost &#x27;millions of dollars&#x27;, would set a dangerous precedent and should be &#x27;nipped in the bud″&quot;, but no motions regarding changing the name were carried. The meeting was attended by over 100 people, an unusually high number. Shortly afterwards, Western Australian senators called for a broader review of Western Australian &quot;place names, such as Stirling Range, linked to colonial figures with known racist histories ... such as William Dampier, John Forrest and John Septimus Roe.&quot;

==Wards==
The city has been divided into seven wards, each of two councillors. Each councillor serves a four-year term, and half-elections are held every two years. The mayor is elected from among the councillors.

* Balga Ward
* Coastal Ward
* Doubleview Ward
* Hamersley Ward
* Inglewood Ward
* Lawley Ward
* Osborne Ward

==Suburbs==
The suburbs of the City of Stirling with population and size figures based on the most recent Australian census:
==Population==

* The 1996 figure includes 9,703 residents living in Maylands, and Mount Lawley south of the Midland railway line who were transferred to the City of Bayswater in 1998.

==Libraries==
The City of Stirling holds 6 libraries. They are the:
* Scarborough Library
* Karrinyup Library
* Dianella Library
* Inglewood Library
* Mirrabooka Library
* Osborne Library

==Heritage-listed places==

, 641 places are heritage-listed in the City of Stirling, of which 20 are on the State Register of Heritage Places.

<text>Chronic Town is the debut extended play (EP) by American alternative rock band R.E.M., released on August 24, 1982, on I.R.S. Records. Containing five tracks, the EP was recorded at the Drive-In Studio in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, in October 1981, eighteen months after the formation of the band. Its co-producer was Mitch Easter, who produced the band&#x27;s &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; single earlier in 1981.

&quot;Chronic Town&quot;″s opening track, &quot;Wolves, Lower&quot;, was re-recorded in June 1982, two months before the EP&#x27;s release.

The title of the EP is part of the lyric to &quot;Carnival of Sorts (Boxcars)&quot;, the third track on the release, and the name of the first side of the EP. &quot;Poster Torn&quot;, also a lyric in &quot;Carnival of Sorts (Boxcars)&quot;, is the name of side two.

==Background and recording==
After the minor success of the group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot; in 1981, R.E.M. manager Jefferson Holt felt the band was ready to record a longer release. While he felt they were not ready to record a full album, Holt thought an EP would be satisfactory. The band was uncertain at first if they would record with producer Mitch Easter (who had produced &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;), but Easter managed to convince Holt and the band to let him produce it.

In October 1981, R.E.M. spent a weekend at Easter&#x27;s Drive-In Studios recording the EP. Easter was a fan of the electronic band Kraftwerk, which inspired him to try various sonic experiments while recording. Easter incorporated tape loops and recorded singer Michael Stipe singing outdoors. &quot;There were a lot of bugs out there,&quot; remembered Easter. &quot;Whenever that &#x27;house in order&#x27; part comes up, I think you can hear tons of crickets.&quot;

The band was open to such experimentation and used the sessions as an opportunity to learn how to use a studio. At the time of R.E.M.&#x27;s stint at the Drive-In, &quot;the set-up was really simple,&quot; Easter said in 1994. &quot;I had almost nothing in the studio back then, except a tape machine and a console and two compressors and one delay device. We couldn&#x27;t do any fancy stuff.&quot;

Easter continued: &quot;I remember &quot;Chronic Town&quot; completely fondly because it was so relaxed, and so open to cutting the tape up and putting pieces in backwards and stuff. There were some fireworks one night, so we went and sat on the roof for four hours and watched the fireworks instead of working on the record—because we &quot;could&quot;, you know?&quot;

R.E.M. intended to release the EP on a proposed independent record label named Dasht Hopes run by Holt and his business partner David Healy, who funded three days of recording at the Drive-In. However, the band&#x27;s demo had caught the attention of I.R.S. Records. The label signed the group to a record deal, working it out of its contracts with Healy and Hib-Tone, the indie label which released &quot;Radio Free Europe&quot;. I.R.S. heads Jay Boberg and Miles Copeland III felt the proposed track listing was weakened by the song &quot;Ages of You&quot; and &quot;Jazz Lips&quot;, and felt &quot;Wolves, Lower&quot; was a better choice. However, the pair felt the original take of the song was too fast. The band re-recorded &quot;Wolves, Lower&quot; with Easter in June 1982 in a quick recording session.

During his time in Athens, Michael Lachowski, of Pylon, ran an answerphone service known as the Athens Party Telephone. Its initialism, A.P.T., was used in the lyric to &quot;Stumble&quot;.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s front cover features an image of the Stryge gargoyle from Notre-Dame Cathedral.

==Release==
I.R.S. released &quot;Chronic Town&quot; in August 1982 as its first American release. Reaction to the EP varied; one I.R.S. radio promoter said that many of his contacts at campus radio did not know what to make of the record, but added, &quot;The Georgia stations and some of the more together college stations across the country jumped on it.&quot; The band filmed its first music video for &quot;Wolves, Lower&quot; to promote the record. The EP sold 20,000 copies in its first year.

==Reception==

I.R.S.&#x27;s Jay Boberg said of &quot;Chronic Town&quot;: &quot;The thing that made me play the cassette again and again was that it kept getting better. It was not the kind of thing you listened to once or twice, casually, and said, &#x27;Oh my God! This is tremendous!&#x27; It had a depth to it.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; reviewer Richard Grabel wrote, &quot;&quot;Chronic Town&quot; is five songs that spring to life full of immediacy and action and healthy impatience. Songs that won&#x27;t be denied.&quot; Grabel praised the songs&#x27; auras of mystery, and concluded, &quot;R.E.M. ring true, and it&#x27;s great to hear something as unforced and cunning as this.&quot; &quot;Creem&quot; writer Robot A. Hull began his review saying, &quot;This EP is so arcane that I had to play it six times in a row to get a handle on it – and even now, I&#x27;m still not sure.&quot; Hull praised the EP for &quot;[evoking] the music of the late-&#x27;60s without any pretensions, mingling past and present to shape both into concurrent moments.&quot; Hull concluded, &quot;Despite its eccentricity, R.E.M.&#x27;s record is undoubtedly the sleeper EP of the year.&quot;

&quot;Chronic Town&quot; ranked second in the EP category of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll in 1982.

<text>Highway 97C is an east–west highway, forming part of an important link between the Lower Mainland and the Okanagan Valley south of Kelowna, which is the third largest metropolitan area in the province. It bisects the Coquihalla Highway at Merritt. The expressway and freeway sections of the highway are known as Okanagan Connector or Coquihalla Connector. The section of Highway 97C between Highway 5 and Highway 97 is a core route of the National Highway System.

== Route description ==
Highway 97C begins near Peachland, at a trumpet interchange on Highway 97 known as &quot;Drought Hill&quot;. The section of Highway 97C east of Merritt is an expressway ranging between 4 and 6 lanes, with a speed limit of . The section east of Aspen Grove is a freeway with a speed limit of . The road was formerly an expressway with a speed limit of . As of more recently, speed limits have been lowered in an effort to combat accidents along the highway. Freeway sections along the highway have very few exits along its route. Its highest altitude is the Pennask Summit, above sea level. Highway 97C travels on this freeway northwest to Aspen Grove, where it converges with Highway 5A. This stretch is a four-lane rural arterial highway. Highways 97C and 5A share the long route between Aspen Grove and the Coquihalla Highway at Meritt, where Highway 5A continues northeast and Highway 8 begins.

Highways 97C and 8 travel along Nicola Avenue through Merritt and share a concurrency to Lower Nicola, where Highway 8 continues west to Spences Bridge and Highway 97C diverges north. Highway 97C goes north for to Logan Lake, then northwest for to Ashcroft on the Canadian National Railway. Highway 97C then travels west from Ashcroft to where it converges with Highway 1, which takes Highway 97C north for its final to its end at Highway 97 in Cache Creek.

== History ==
Highway 97C was opened to traffic on October 1, 1990, and was constructed as the third phase of the Coquihalla Highway Project. It cost $225 million to construct (equivalent to $ million in dollars).

Highway 97C was originally intended to have a freeway connection with the Coquihalla Highway approximately south of Merritt, near exit 256; however due to protest by local residents in Merritt on the grounds that it would take tourists away from the area, the project was postponed and the freeway remains incomplete to this day.

In July 2007, the shared roadway of Highway 5A and 97C was upgraded to a two-lane road in each direction, the last segment required to enable two lanes in each direction when travelling between Vancouver and Kelowna. The upgrade was completed on July 24.

When it was constructed, initial proposals had it designated as Highway 8; however, communities on the route preferred it designated as an auxiliary route of Highway 97, hence its Highway 97C designation.

<text>Ciba was a chemical company based in and near Basel, Switzerland. &quot;Ciba&quot; stood for &quot;Chemische Industrie Basel&quot; (Chemical Industries Basel) and was formed when the non-pharmaceuticals elements of Novartis were spun out in 1997, following the merger in the previous year of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz that created Novartis.

In 2008, Ciba was acquired by the German chemical company BASF and, in April 2009, integrated into the BASF group. Ciba AG initially continued to trade under the old name, but was renamed to &quot;BASF Schweiz AG&quot; in March 2010.

The BASF subsidiary makes products in the following areas: Agriculture, Automotive, Construction &amp; Pipes, Electronic materials, Extractive &amp; Process Technologies, Home &amp; Fabric Care, Inks &amp; Graphics, Lubricants, Monomers &amp; Water Soluble Polymers, Packaging, Paints and Coatings, Paper, Personal Care, Photo &amp; Digital Imaging, Plastics &amp; Rubber, Textiles &amp; Fibers, Water treatment.

==History==
The company first came to life under the name &quot;Gesellschaft fur Chemische Industrie&quot;, and eventually settled on an acronym of Chemische Industrie Basel sometime after 1920.

Part of the merger agreement of 1997, between Ciba Geigy and Sandoz, was that the former&#x27;s industrial chemicals business would be spun off as a separate business, leading to the formation of Ciba Specialty Chemicals plc.

In 2004, Ciba bought paper chemical manufacturer Raisio Chemicals from Raisio Group. In 2006, Ciba divested its textile dyes and chemical auxiliaries business in a sale to Huntsman Corporation.

In 2007, the company announced the intention to adopt the name Ciba Inc.

Ciba&#x27;s board of directors agreed to a €3.4 billion takeover offer from BASF, the world&#x27;s largest chemicals company, on 15 September 2008.

In 2009, the parent company changed the name to BASF Performance Products Limited – BASF group.

<text>Bandar Utama Damansara is a residential township located within the Sungai Buloh mukim (subdivision) of the Petaling District, Selangor, Malaysia. It is a residential suburb and home to the popular 1 Utama Shopping Centre. Bandar Utama Damansara, together with neighbouring Kampung Sungai Kayu Ara, form the PJU 6 section of the city of Petaling Jaya.

Bandar Utama Damansara is represented in parliament by the MP for Damansara, Gobind Singh Deo and State Assemblywoman for Bandar Utama, Jamaliah Jamaluddin.

==Demographics==

As of 2004, it is estimated that there are 59,040 people residing in Bandar Utama Damansara. The population had risen to roughly 100,000 people by 2021. The primary residents appear to be Chinese followed by Indian and Malay. However, there were nearby squatter settlements of illegal immigrants in the neighbouring Kayu Ara village which is enclosed by Bandar Utama Damansara and Damansara Utama. They have now mostly been relocated to nearby low-cost flats and their squatter houses demolished to make way for legal developments.

==History==

Until 1991, the Bandar Utama Damansara area was originally consisted of palm oil estates with a population fewer than 100 people. Development of Bandar Utama Damansara began in the early 1990s under the company named See Hoy Chan Holdings Sdn. Bhd., and an attempt to modernise the area was made, with the opening of Sri Pentas, TV3&#x27;s broadcast centre was officially opened on 22 October 1996, as well as the 1 Utama Shopping Centre, which became increasingly well known after the Jaya Jusco chain of department stores, presently known as AEON, moved its Taman Tun Dr. Ismail, Kuala Lumpur outlet to Bandar Utama Damansara in 1995.

With the opening of several new schools in 1997 and 1998, as well as the establishment of Kolej Bandar Utama, a tertiary institution, Bandar Utama Damansara continued to grow. In 2004, additional residential precincts of BU7, BU10 and BU6 (comprising 2½-storey houses) were completed. These are newer sections of Bandar Utama Damansara compared to the older sections, BU1 until BU4, which were completed in phases beginning from 1991 until 1996.

==Geography==
Bandar Utama Damansara is roughly 1000 acres (4 km2) in size, and is divided into 12 sections ranging from BU1 to BU12. These sections are served by roads, e.g. &quot;Jalan BU2/5&quot; where &quot;Jalan&quot; is a Malay word meaning road, BU2 is the section and 5 is the road number. Houses on one side of the road have even numbers, and the other side odd numbers, so one side of a road will consist of houses with numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and so forth while the opposite will have houses numbered 1, 3, 5, 7 and so on.

A bridge over the Sprint Expressway joins the two parts of Bandar Utama Damansara, sections BU1 until BU10 and BU11 with BU12, which are separated by the expressway.

==Places==

===Places of worship===

The Bandar Utama Buddhist Society was registered on 28 March 2000. Uttama Bodhi Vihara, located in BU3, is an iconic building that is the home of the Society. Today, it is known to many Buddhists throughout the Klang Valley.

Until recently, there has not been a church in Bandar Utama Damansara. Most Charismatics opted for either the Glad Tidings Assembly of God Church, the Damansara Utama Methodist Church, or the PJEFC which are all located in Seksyen 13, Petaling Jaya, or the Grace Assembly located in &quot;Taman SEA&quot; (SEA Park). Roman Catholics who live in the area tend to worship at the Church of St. Ignatius, near &quot;Kampung Chempaka&quot; (Cempaka Village) or Kristus Aman, located in Taman Tun Dr Ismail. However, in August 2017, Victory Church, a Foursquare Gospel Church, moved into Centrepoint Mall.

There is a &quot;surau&quot; (prayer hall) for Muslims at BU3, and the village of Kayu Ara has a mosque. Since 2016, there is also a huge mosque named Masjid Bandar Utama just beside the BU12 residential area.

===Education===
There are 3 national primary schools, a Chinese primary school (Puay Chai 2) and a Tamil primary school in Bandar Utama Damansara. There are also four secondary schools. The first primary school was opened near BU12 in 1998, but as of 2004 had begun to languish due to the opening of primary schools on the other side of Bandar Utama Damansara.

The first secondary school, SMK Bandar Utama was also opened around the same time. The school has enjoyed an increase in media coverage particularly due to their performance in the annual The Star National Best School Newspaper Competition; in which the 2003 class of 4 Adil won runner-up. The school was also recently involved in the Student Exchange Programme held between Phuay Chai Secondary School, Singapore and SMK Bandar Utama which had gained the approval from the Ministry of Education with the aim to foster stronger relations between the schools in its neighbouring countries. This programme had also been highlighted in &quot;stuff@school&quot; pullout of The Star newspaper.

In early 2007, the school beat SMK Bandar Utama Damansara (4) and SMK Damansara Jaya in the Tan Sri Datuk Wira Abdul Rahman Arshad cup; in the first and second rounds. Against SMK Damansara Jaya, the school&#x27;s third speaker was named Best Speaker. The school&#x27;s Drama Team landed third place at a drama competition for the Damansara zone; with their comedy The Poser Dilemma.

There is a propensity for some parents to school their children outside Bandar Utama Damansara, particularly for those living on the BU11/BU12 side, who tend to send their children to the Tropicana primary or secondary schools in Sunway Damansara, or the highly reputed primary and secondary schools at Damansara Utama and Damansara Jaya.

There is also First City University College, formerly known as KBU International College (KBU), a private tertiary institution and the British International School, Kuala Lumpur that follows the British educational curriculum in Malaysia.

For early childhood development centres or kindergartens, there are a few such as Smart Reader Kids Bandar Utama Damansara which is located at a corner lot of Jalan BU6/12.

===Community Centre===
There is a community centre completed in the year 2005 situated between BU6 and BU3 next to Puay Chai 2 school. This community centre contains a community hall, a football (soccer) field, basketball/volleyball court and a few indoor badminton courts. It was built as a trade-off for not building low-cost houses. Many residents like to play games at the facilities.

===Commercial complexes===
Residents of Bandar Utama Damansara tend to shop at the 1 Utama shopping mall, the second-largest mall in Malaysia. 1 Utama is located at the far end of the BU1-BU10 side (right beside Damansara–Puchong Expressway), and quite a distance from BU11 and BU12. It is tenanted by almost every international brand, and two large cineplexes with a total of 24 screens. A significant number of international tourists also shop at 1 Utama. It has been well patronised since its opening in 1995, allowing it to more than double its size since then. As of 2004, it spans more than , making it one of the largest malls in Malaysia.

Centrepoint Bandar Utama, a much smaller commercial complex is also frequented by those who do not feel like travelling to the far end of Bandar Utama Damansara. It is located in the heart of the neighbourhood, and is much more cosier than 1 Utama. It thrives in particular with officeworkers in a hurry having their lunch breaks, as well as students from the three secondary schools within walking distance of it. It is also right next to a McDonald&#x27;s drive-through restaurant

A Tesco outlet, the Ikano Power Centre, the Curve mall and the largest IKEA outlet in Southeast Asia were opened in the adjacent township of Mutiara Damansara. This has provided even more choices to the residents of Bandar Utama Damansara. There are also free bus services from the Curve to Bintang Walk, and from 1 Utama to Sri Hartamas.

===Accommodation===
There is a 5-star hotel completed in 2007 named One World Hotel. There are 438 rooms in the hotel located next to Sri Pentas.

===Golf And Recreation Club===
The Club located at Bukit Utama Damansara is a membership-based golf and recreation club that has a 9-Hole golf course with night golfing facilities. The Club is popular among residents not only from Bandar Utama Damansara but residential areas surrounding Bandar Utama Damansara. The Club facilities boasts of its three indoor artificial grass tennis courts, squash courts, badminton courts, an Olympic-sized swimming pool, steam room, amped trampoline park, gym, meetings and conferences facilities, a grand ballroom, and Extra Super Tanker, a popular Chinese Cuisine Restaurant. There are ample parking facilities available for members and guests.

==Transportation==

Bandar Utama Damansara is served by a mass rapid transit (MRT) station, Bandar Utama, on the MRT Kajang Line. It is located between Sri Pentas and the LDP. The station is directly linked with the One World Hotel/1 Utama complex and the 1Powerhouse building where the park and ride bays and feeder bus stop are located. In the future, the station will also serve as the terminus of the new LRT Shah Alam Line.

There are two MRT feeder bus routes running from the bus stop, covering parts of Bandar Utama Damansara as well as neighbouring neighbourhoods. Bandar Utama also has one bus hub, Bandar Utama bus hub, located near 1 Utama.

There are also frequent buses to and from Kelana Jaya on the LRT Kelana Jaya Line. These buses, which are provided by 1 Utama, depart from the 1 Utama New Wing bus stop. From this bus stop, there are also Rapid KL buses to and from Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya.

Bandar Utama Damansara is served by both the New Klang Valley Expressway (NKVE) and the Damansara-Puchong Expressway (LDP).

==Administration==
Bandar Utama Damansara, like most of Damansara, falls under the jurisdiction of the &quot;Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya&quot; (Petaling Jaya City Council).

<doc id="671517" wikidata="Q2069740" url="?curid=671517" title="Reckoning (R.E.M. album)">
<text>Reckoning (alternatively titled File Under Water) is the second studio album by American alternative rock band R.E.M., released on April 9, 1984, by I.R.S. Records. Produced by Mitch Easter and Don Dixon, the album was recorded at Reflection Sound Studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, over 16 days in December 1983 and January 1984. Dixon and Easter intended to capture the sound of R.E.M.&#x27;s live performances, and used binaural recording on several tracks. Lead singer Michael Stipe dealt with darker subject matter in his lyrics, with water-related imagery being a recurring theme on the album.

Released to critical acclaim, &quot;Reckoning&quot; reached number 27 in the United States—where it was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 1991—and peaked at number 91 in the United Kingdom.

==Background and production==

After their debut album &quot;Murmur&quot; (1983) received critical acclaim, R.E.M. quickly began working on their second album. They wrote new material prodigiously, mostly in Mike Mills&#x27; living room on Barber Street in Athens. Guitarist Peter Buck recalled, &quot;We were going through this streak where we were writing two good songs a week [...] We just wanted to do it; whenever we had a new batch of songs, it was time to record&quot;. Because of the many new songs the band had, Buck unsuccessfully tried convincing everyone to make the next album a double album. In November 1983, the band recorded 22 songs during a session with Neil Young producer Elliot Mazer in San Francisco. While Mazer was briefly considered as a candidate to produce the band&#x27;s next album, R.E.M. ultimately decided to team up again with &quot;Murmur&quot; producers Mitch Easter and Don Dixon instead.

R.E.M. started recording &quot;Reckoning&quot; at Reflection Sound in Charlotte, North Carolina, on December 8, 1983. The group recorded over two eight-day stretches around Christmas that year, separated by two weeks of canceled studio time that allowed the band to perform in Greensboro, North Carolina, go see a movie, and shoot a video in the studio. While the studio diary listed 16 days for recording, the album sleeve later claimed the album was recorded in 14 days, while in interviews, Buck sometimes stated that the album was recorded in 11 days. The producers both disputed that the sessions were that short; Dixon insisted that they were at the studio for over 25 days – during which he worked 18-hour days – while Easter said, &quot;When I read &#x27;11 days&#x27; I thought, what the fuck! It was 20 days, which was still short, but it&#x27;s not 11.&quot;

During recording, there was pressure from I.R.S. Records to try making the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg &quot;record company clueless&quot;, while Easter said &quot;I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, &#x27;holy shit&#x27;, because it would strike me as really teenage.&quot; Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that &quot;it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn&#x27;t know we were recording them!&quot;, and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.

The recording sessions were difficult for lead singer Michael Stipe, who, among the band, was particularly worn out by the band&#x27;s 1983 tour schedule. Getting usable vocal tracks from Stipe was difficult; Dixon recalled that he and Stipe would show up around noon each day before the rest of the band, but that &quot;he was kind of shut down, and it was difficult to get him to open up&quot;. While recording the song &quot;7 Chinese Bros.&quot;, Stipe sang so quietly that Dixon could not hear him on the tape. Frustrated, the producer climbed a ladder to a spot above the recording booth Stipe was in and found a gospel record titled &quot;The Joy of Knowing Jesus&quot; by the Revelaires, which he then handed to the singer in an attempt to inspire him. Stipe began reciting the liner notes from the album audibly, which enabled Dixon to move on to recording the vocal track to &quot;7 Chinese Bros.&quot; properly (the initial recitation take was later released as &quot;Voice of Harold&quot;, first as a B-side to &quot;So. Central Rain&quot; and then in 1987 on the compilation &quot;Dead Letter Office&quot;).

==Music==

With &quot;Reckoning&quot;, Dixon, Easter, and the band wanted to capture the energy of R.E.M.&#x27;s live sound. Dixon had not seen the band perform live before working on &quot;Murmur&quot;; after he had done so, he had a greater sense of the band&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses. Dixon wanted the guitars to sound more like they did in concert, but originally they met resistance from both the band and the label; however, by the time R.E.M. started recording, Dixon said the group &quot;wanted to rock out a bit more&quot;.

Dixon was enamored of the binaural recording technique, and used it extensively on the album. Easter recalled that Dixon &quot;made this sort of fake binaural head out of a cardboard box and stuck two microphones in it&quot; to record the group. In Easter&#x27;s opinion the method made drummer Bill Berry&#x27;s parts &quot;fresher sounding&quot;. Binaural recording also allowed bassist Mike Mills&#x27; backing vocals to be loud without obscuring Stipe&#x27;s lead vocals. Dixon explained, &quot;Mike Mills was often singing 12 to 15 feet away from the microphones that were recording his part, but because it was in a studio binaural field, we would tend to hear him as behind [Stipe].&quot;

Biographer David Buckley wrote, &quot;While the music moved away from &quot;Murmur&quot;&#x27;s slightly airless feel, the subject matter was a little darker.&quot; Buck noted in a 1988 interview that water imagery was abundant in the album. Buckley interpreted that imagery as representing the change presented by the band&#x27;s increasing success, as well as the changing music scene of the group&#x27;s Athens, Georgia hometown. The song &quot;Camera&quot; addressed the death of a friend from Athens who died in a car crash. Easter said, &quot;[Stipe&#x27;s] vocal was so exposed on that track, and because of that, it could really show any technical imperfections with regard to pitch.&quot; The producer tried to get Stipe to sing a better take, but the singer was more intent on getting the feeling of the song across, and at one point refused to record further. While many of the album&#x27;s songs were new compositions, some had been in R.E.M.&#x27;s show setlists for years; in particular, the songs &quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot; and &quot;(Don&#x27;t Go Back to) Rockville&quot; had been played live as far back as October 1980. The band was reluctant to record &quot;Pretty Persuasion,&quot; as the members considered it too old, but Dixon and Easter convinced the group to do so. R.E.M. initially planned releasing &quot;(Don&#x27;t Go Back to) Rockville&quot; as a non-album single between &quot;Reckoning&quot; and its next release. When the band recorded it for the album, the group rearranged the song from its live incarnation and gave it a country music-like influence as tribute to their advisor Bertis Downs, IV, who was a fan of country music.

The following additional songs were recorded during the &quot;Reckoning&quot; sessions:

==Packaging==
For the cover of &quot;Reckoning&quot;, Stipe drew a picture of a two-headed snake, which he then gave to artist Howard Finster to fill in as a painting. Stipe stated that the imagery was an attempt to define the elements, explaining, &quot;Part of it is rocks and part of it is the sun and part of it the sky.&quot; The end result was considered a disappointment, as Stipe had to work with Finster on a long-distance basis, and the reproduction of the artwork for the album sleeve was problematic. The spine of the vinyl version of the album features the phrase &quot;File Under Water&quot;. Stipe told &quot;NME&quot; in 1984 the phrase is the true title of the record. He added &quot;In America, both titles are on the spine, with nothing on the cover. Here [in the United Kingdom] they insisted on &quot;Reckoning&quot; being on the cover.&quot; Instead of labeling the sides of the record as &quot;side one&quot; and &quot;side two&quot;, the sides were designated as &quot;L&quot; and &quot;R&quot;, respectively.

The back cover features individual photographs of the band members, including a photograph of Stipe taken by Michael Plen at the club Les Bains-Douches in Paris, France, on November 24, 1983.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Reckoning&quot; was released on April 9, 1984, in the United Kingdom and on April 17 in the United States. The album quickly reached number one on the college radio airplay charts, whose audience had highly anticipated the album; however, the band hadn&#x27;t received much exposure on commercial radio and MTV by that point. Instead of the music industry standard of waiting for mainstream radio stations to pick up the band&#x27;s music, I.R.S. hoped to &quot;convince reluctant programmers to add the group by pointing to the press response, word-of-mouth reaction to local live performances and sales figures&quot;, according to a July 1984 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;So. Central Rain (I&#x27;m Sorry)&quot;, was released in May and reached number 85 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts. Its second single, &quot;(Don&#x27;t Go Back to) Rockville&quot;, was released in August; unlike its predecessor, it did not chart. Within a month of its release, &quot;Reckoning&quot; peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, and it remained there for nearly a year. While the album&#x27;s domestic chart placing was unusually high for a college rock band at the time, scant airplay and poor distribution overseas allowed it to chart no higher than number 91 in the United Kingdom. In 1991 the record was certified gold (500,000 copies shipped) by the Recording Industry Association of America.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave &quot;Reckoning&quot; a four-out-of-five star rating. Reviewer Christopher Connelly wrote that in comparison to &quot;Murmur&quot; the &quot;overall sound is crisper, the lyrics far more comprehensible. And while the album may not mark any major strides forward for the band, R.E.M.&#x27;s considerable strengths – Buck&#x27;s ceaselessly inventive strumming, Mike Mills&#x27; exceptional bass playing and Stipe&#x27;s evocatively gloomy baritone – remain unchanged&quot;. However, Connelly felt that Stipe&#x27;s &quot;erratic meanderings&quot; were an impediment to the band that &quot;will prevent R.E.M. from transcending cult status&quot;. Nonetheless, he concluded, &quot;R.E.M.&#x27;s music is able to involve the listener on both an emotional and intellectual level.&quot; Joe Sasfy of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt that the songs on the album &quot;trump even &quot;Murmur&quot;″s outstanding songwriting&quot; and stated &quot;there isn&#x27;t an American band worth following more than R.E.M.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Mat Snow wrote that &quot;Reckoning&quot; &quot;confirms R.E.M. as one of the most beautifully exciting groups on the planet&quot; and called the album &quot;another classic&quot;. The album placed seventh in &quot;NME&quot;″s Best Album of the Year critics&#x27; poll, and ranked sixth in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Pazz &amp; Jop poll. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 81 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;.

The 1992 British CD reissue of the album included five bonus tracks. A 25th anniversary deluxe edition of the album, which was remastered and packaged with a bonus disc featuring a concert recorded at Chicago&#x27;s Aragon Ballroom on July 7, 1984, was released in 2009.

==&quot;Left of Reckoning&quot;==
Eager to explore the music video medium, Stipe secured funding for a short film that would accompany music from the first half of &quot;Reckoning&quot;. Stipe&#x27;s concept was to film the project at folk artist R.A. Miller&#x27;s Whirligig Farm, and he recruited Athens filmmaker James Herbert to direct it. In March 1984 R.E.M. filmed &quot;Left of Reckoning&quot; at the Whirligig Farm in Rabbittown, Georgia. The short film draws its title from the fact that it is soundtracked by five songs that appear on the &quot;L&quot; side of the vinyl version of &quot;Reckoning&quot;: &quot;Harborcoat&quot;, &quot;7 Chinese Bros.&quot;, &quot;So. Central Rain (I&#x27;m Sorry)&quot;, &quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot;, &quot;Time After Time (AnnElise)&quot;, in addition to &quot;Second Guessing&quot; from the R side. In contrast to standard music video imagery, the film consists primarily of footage of the band members wandering around the farm, while Herbert utilizes close-ups, silhouettes, and slow motion footage. Herbert utilized rephotography during the editing process, which involved taking photographs of film frames at random, while also closing in or pulling back from the image with no regard to narrative. According to Buck, &quot;It was really inexpensive to make and kind of fun. We just asked [Herbert] to edit something to four minutes&#x27; length, but he&#x27;s used to making 20-minute films, that&#x27;s the length he works in. He just made this film that goes along with the first side of the record.&quot; While MTV did not air the complete film, the channel&#x27;s program &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; (funded by I.R.S.) aired the &quot;Time After Time (AnnElise)&quot; segment, and the snippet featuring &quot;Pretty Persuasion&quot; was aired by other music programs. The full film was later included on the video releases &quot;Succumbs&quot; and &quot;When the Light Is Mine: The Best of the I.R.S. Years 1982–1987&quot;.

<text>Doubleview is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia in the local government area of the City of Stirling. It was named Doubleview due to its views of both the Indian Ocean to the west and the Darling Range to the east.

==Location==
Doubleview lies between Scarborough to the west and Innaloo to the east on the heavily trafficked Scarborough Beach Road. It is bordered by Newborough Street to the North, Grand Promenade to the West, Williamstown Road to the South, and Huntriss Road to the East. Its main roads are Sackville Terrace and Scarborough Beach Road.

==History==
In 1895, the land was occupied by John Daniel Manning (1814-1895), an English-born dairy farmer, shortly before his death. In 1910, a real estate investor called Charles Edgar Stoneman purchased the land and started selling it in subdivisions. He used the same street names used in the centre of Perth, leading buyers to believe they were purchasing land there. In 1916, a real estate developer called M. L. Connor purchased the Southern portion of Doubleview and started selling it in subdivisions. After he failed to sell many, it was purchased by a team of real estate developers, Dudley and Dwyer, in 1926. They were the ones who coined the name &#x27;Doubleview.&#x27; However, the land subdivisions failed to sell again.

Shortly after the Second World War, the Western Australian government built houses for returning soldiers in the Northern section of Doubleview. Those first houses were built in timber-frame. More recently, houses have been built using brick and tile. It has remained a predominantly residential area.

==School==
Doubleview contains one state primary school, Doubleview Primary School, located at 203 St Brigid&#x27;s Terrace.

==Churches==
*The Perth Chinese Christian Church is located at 146 Flamborough Street.
*A meeting house of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is located at 71 Princess Road.
*Doubleview Parish of the Catholic Archdiocese of Perth is located in the neighbouring suburb of Woodlands

==Public parks==
Doubleview contains several public parks:
*Bradley Reserve.
*Munro Reserve.
*Bennett Park.

It is a primarily middle-class suburb made up of mainly Italian, Greek and Macedonian families, as well as many families from other European countries. It is also one of the largest suburbs in the northern part of the Perth metropolitan area. Much of Balcatta is a commercial and industrial area.

== History ==

Balcatta&#x27;s name was derived from the Aboriginal words &quot;bal&quot; meaning &quot;his&quot; and &quot;katta&quot; meaning &quot;hill&quot;. The name was recorded by Alexander Forrest in 1877 as referring to the northern portion of Careniup Swamp.

Before the 1960s, the area mainly consisted of market gardens, before residential and industry grew from the 1970s onwards.

The area became popular with Southern European migrant families, because it was one of the few areas that had not been settled and many migrant families wanted to build their own homes in their distinctive style, many complete with plaster figurines of lions and romanesque style columns adorning the front verandah and entry. Similarly, other European immigrant families had already settled in nearby suburbs such as Osborne Park, and made their living as market gardeners.

The area was especially popular with Macedonian families, leading to the establishment of Macedonian Cultural Centre &quot;Ilinden&quot; on Grindleford Place. Balcatta was also a popular area among other peoples from the Balkans.

As many of the older families pass on and others choose to update by building a newer home further north, the area is becoming increasingly popular with those of Asian cultural background, which has also led to some parts of Balcatta being subdivided into small units or villas.

== Areas of interest ==
===Jones Street===
The longest street in Balcatta. Winding through the locality, Jones Street has had repeated work done by the local council to resurface it out and make it safer for both pedestrians and motorists. A number of new round-abouts have been constructed in order to slow down traffic at various points on the road. Jones Street also runs past Takari Primary School and ends at Delawney Street behind the Water Corporation Depot and Stirling Recycling Plant.

===Amelia Street===
This hilly street runs east to west through Balcatta. It also goes past one side of Balcatta Senior High School.

===Balcatta Senior High School ===
Balcatta Senior High School (BSHS) is the only public high school in Balcatta. A large percentage of its students are from non-Anglo Australian backgrounds. The school has specialist programs in the arts, such as dance and drama. BSHS was opened in 1967 and at the time was the northernmost school in the Perth metropolitan area.

===Jones Paskin Reserve===
This is a large oval mainly utilised in the summer as a cricket oval and for general use by the local community. This is the home ground of the Balcatta Cricket Club.

<doc id="671528" wikidata="Q1848129" url="?curid=671528" title="Cape Chidley">
<text>Cape Chidley is a headland located on the eastern shore of Killiniq Island, Canada, at the northeastern tip of the Labrador Peninsula.

Cape Chidley was named by English explorer John Davis on August 1, 1587, after his friend and fellow explorer John Chidley. On October 22, 1943, the landed just south of Cape Chidley and set up Weather Station Kurt to collect data about the weather.

In the original plans for the Pinetree Line (a series of radar stations along the 50th parallel north), Cape Chidley was meant to be the site for a long-range radar station called &quot;N-30&quot;. Supplies were moved to the site by ship during 1951–52, but in late 1952–early 1953 the site was moved to Resolution Island.

==Location==

Sometimes spelled &quot;Cape Chudleigh&quot;, Cape Chidley is on the short boundary between the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the territory of Nunavut on Killiniq Island. It forms the northernmost point of Labrador.

The Dominion of Newfoundland, having been a separate country at the time that Canada&#x27;s Arctic islands were assigned in this manner, shared a boundary with Canada on Killiniq Island. The territory of Labrador included the entire Atlantic watershed of the Labrador Peninsula and its islands. 

The northern and western part of Killiniq Island (under Nunavut&#x27;s jurisdiction) drains into Ungava Bay and the Hudson Strait. Thus Cape Chidley is also the terminus of the Laurentian Divide, which separates the Arctic Ocean watershed from the Atlantic Ocean watershed. (Some sources include Hudson Bay in the Atlantic Ocean watershed, though the Laurentian Divide has been long established and places Hudson Bay with the Arctic Ocean watershed.) The cape marks the south end of the entrance to the Hudson Strait, opposite Resolution Island.

The closest community to Cape Chidley was Port Burwell, Nunavut, until it was evacuated in 1978. Killiniq Island itself is separated from mainland North America by the narrow McLelan Strait.

The Torngat Mountains run along the coast of Labrador and terminate at Killiniq Island. The top of the knoll forming the headland at Cape Chidley has an elevation of , making the cape considerably higher than either of its two flanking headlands.

The Cape Chidley Islands lie at the north end of the cape.

<text>Balga is a suburb of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, north of Perth city&#x27;s central business district (CBD). Its local government area is the City of Stirling. Mark Irwin is the current mayor.

The name &quot;Balga&quot; was adopted in 1954 and is the Noongar (Aboriginal) word for the indigenous grass tree &quot;Xanthorrhoea preissii&quot;. It was designed by the State Housing Commission along with Nollamara and Westminster as part of the &quot;Mirrabooka Project&quot;, and the laying of streets and building of homes commenced in the 1960s.

==Geography==
Balga is north of Perth, and is bounded by Wanneroo Road to the west, Reid Highway to the south, Mirrabooka Avenue to the east and Beach Road to the north.

==Demographics==
At the 2011 census, Balga had a population of 10,701. Balga residents had a median age of 31, and median incomes were well below average for the Perth metropolitan area and the region — $490 per week compared with $669 per week in Perth, and $685 in the Perth North West statistical region. The population of Balga was more ethnically diverse than the Perth average, with 49.1% born in Australia and significant minorities from Sudan, Italy, Macedonia, Vietnam and Burma identified in the 2011 census. At the 2011 census, 3.72% of residents identified as Indigenous Australians.

==Education==
Balga contains a state high school, Balga Senior High School which opened in 1970; three state primary schools, Balga (1965), North Balga (1968) and Warriapendi (1970); one special school, the Gladys Newton School; and one private school, Majella Catholic Primary School (1971). Additionally, a campus of North Metropolitan TAFE (formerly known as Polytechnic West) is in the southeast of the suburb.

Balga Senior High School includes an Intensive English Centre for newly arrived refugee students, a program for teenage parents, a sports-based education program for indigenous students, and an emphasis on literacy, numeracy, health and careers through all levels of the school. It is one of the few high schools in Western Australia not to offer a Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) program, although several students each year complete a university preparation course conducted by Edith Cowan University.

==Transport==
The suburb is served by a number of Transperth bus routes operated by Swan Transit (374-375, 385-389) and Path Transit (371 and 376).

<text>Carine is a suburb of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, and is located north of Perth&#x27;s central business district (CBD) between Marmion Avenue and Mitchell Freeway. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

==History==

The name &quot;Carine&quot; was derived from the two swamps in the area, which were recorded by R. Quinn in a survey in 1865 as &quot;Big Carine Swamp&quot; and &quot;Small Carine Swamp&quot;. Carine originally formed part of the Hamersley Estate, which also included the suburbs now known as North Beach, Waterman and Hamersley.

These areas were owned by the Hamersley family, who arrived from Europe to settle in the Swan River Colony in 1837 and built a summer home in what is now North Beach. The majority of land at Carine remained largely undeveloped until the 1960s, with a few market gardens and farms established in the low-lying portions around the swamps, the remainder being timber reserves and a small piggery and horse stable near Little Carine Swamp, and the Beetles Dairy in Okely Road which operated until 1915.

In the early 1970s, the part of the suburb south of what is now Reid Highway was built, and in 1973, Carine High School opened. For several years, the high school and the Carine Gardens Caravan Park and surrounding market gardens on Balcatta Road were the only facilities in the suburb. From 1975 onwards, the residential suburb was built progressively, with the last two stages being completed in 1987, west of Osmaston Road and the Lake Carine Gardens estate (built on a site originally reserved for a school to serve eastern Carine).

The majority of buildings were single detached houses but, with the growth in popularity of infill development, duplexes have become more common.

In 2000, the final stage of Reid Highway was completed despite considerable local opposition. This effectively separated the southern 300m of the suburb (the oldest section) and the caravan park from the rest of Carine.

In November 2013, a plan was announced to redevelop the former Carine Tafe site. The plan included new town housing, apartments, a retirement village, aged care facilities and mixed use space. The project developers for the site are LandCorp, Cedar Woods Properties and St Ives Group.

==Geography==
Carine is bounded by Beach Road to the north, Mitchell Freeway to the east, North Beach Road to the south and Marmion Avenue to the west. Carine Regional Open Space sits between Duffy/Monyash Roads and Okely Road, and represents about one-third of the suburb. Reid Highway runs through the southern part of the suburb, and is the suburb&#x27;s outlet to the Mitchell Freeway and the city.

At the 2016 Australian census, Carine had a mostly middle-income white population of 6,479 people living in 2,425 dwellings, nearly all of which were detached houses on single lots. The ABS reported that nearly half of Carine&#x27;s workforce were managers or professionals. 65% of all people in Carine are married, and the suburb has a lot more families than the rest of Western Australia.

==Facilities==
Carine is a residential suburb, relying on the Carine Glades shopping centre on its northern boundary for basic commercial services, and nearby Karrinyup Shopping Centre and Centro Warwick for other services. The suburb is served by a primary school, and a high school (grades 7-12).

Carine Regional Open Space is a wetland reserve centred on the two large swamps, and is home to many rare waterbirds, frogs, turtles and other wildlife. They are served by walking and bicycle tracks. The northern end of the open space contains sports facilities, ovals and a skateboard ramp.

==Transport==
Carine is served by the Warwick railway station at its northeastern corner, linking the area to the Perth CBD. The suburb is also served by Transperth bus route 425 along Beach Road, Okely and Osmaston Roads and Everingham Street, the 424 along North Beach Road in Carine&#x27;s south, and other routes along Marmion Avenue and Beach Road.

===Bus===
* 424 Karrinyup Bus Station to Stirling Station – serves North Beach Road
* 425 Warwick Station to Stirling Station – serves Beach Road, Okely Road, Osmaston Road, Almadine Drive, Silica Road, Everingham Street and North Beach Road

Bus routes serving Beach Road:
* 423 Warwick Station to Stirling Station
* 441, 442, 443 and 444 Warwick Station to Whitfords Station

==Politics==
Carine is a reasonably affluent suburb with many &quot;mortgage belt&quot; families and socially liberal voters. It consistently supports the Liberal Party at both federal and state elections where it is located in the Division of Stirling and Electoral district of Carine respectively. Prior to the district of Carine being created in 1996, the suburb was in the Electoral district of Marmion, and before that Karrinyup.

<doc id="671539" wikidata="Q674931" url="?curid=671539" title="Albert I, Duke of Saxony">
<text>Albert I (; 1175 – 7 October 1260) was a Duke of Saxony, Angria, and Westphalia; Lord of Nordalbingia; Count of Anhalt; and Prince-elector and Archmarshal of the Holy Roman Empire. Even though his grandfather Albert the Bear had held the Saxon dukedom between 1138 and 1142, this Albert is counted as the first.

==Biography==
A member of the House of Ascania, Albert was a younger son of Bernard III, Duke of Saxony, and Judith (Jutta) of Poland, daughter of Mieszko III the Old. After his father&#x27;s death in 1212, the surviving sons of the late duke divided his lands according to the laws of the House of Ascania: The elder Henry received Anhalt and the younger Albert the Saxon duchy. Albert supported Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor, in his wars against the Hohenstaufen.

In 1218, Albert&#x27;s maternal uncle Prince-Archbishop Valdemar of Denmark, who had been deposed from his Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, found refuge in Saxony, before he joined the Loccum Abbey as monk.

On 22 July 1227, Albert I asserted as fellow victor in the Battle of Bornhöved, commanding the Holy Roman left flank, his earlier disputed rank as liege lord of the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein, a privilege, however, lost by his successor John V in 1474. After Bornhöved Albert reinforced and extended his fortress and castle in Lauenburg upon Elbe, which his father Bernard had erected in 1182.

Albert came into conflict with Ludolph I, Prince-Bishop of Ratzeburg, and duly imprisoned Ludolph, where he was badly beaten, and later sent into exile.

After Albert&#x27;s death at Lehnin Abbey, his sons, the elder John I and the younger Albert II, ruled together as Dukes of Saxony, with John succeeded by his three sons Albert III, Eric I and John II, until before 20 September 1296 they split Saxony into Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg, with the brothers jointly ruling the former, and Albert II ruling the latter.

== Marriages and issue ==

<doc id="671543" wikidata="Q5345077" url="?curid=671543" title="Edward Roberts (Canadian politician)">
<text>Edward Moxon Roberts (September 1, 1940 – January 14, 2022) was a Canadian lawyer and politician. He first served as a member of the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly (MHA) from 1966 to 1985 representing White Bay North, and again from 1992 to 1996 representing Naskaupi. He went on to serve as the eleventh lieutenant governor of Newfoundland and Labrador from 2002 until 2008.

==Early life==
Roberts was born in St. John&#x27;s, Dominion of Newfoundland, on September 1, 1940. His father, Harry Roberts, was a noted medical doctor in St. John&#x27;s who founded a major pharmaceutical distribution company in Newfoundland and was also the owner of the Battery Hotel. After attending Holloway School and Prince of Wales Collegiate in his hometown, Roberts completed his secondary education at St. Andrew&#x27;s College in Aurora, Ontario. He went on to study at the University of Toronto, first earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1960 before graduating with a Bachelor of Laws four years later.

Roberts subsequently articled with the Attorney General of Newfoundland and was called to the province&#x27;s bar in February 1965. He went into private practice in 1978 with Halley, Hickman, Hunt, and Adams. A year later, he was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1978. He was eventually elevated to Master of the Supreme Court in 1989.

==Legislative career==
===First stint===
Roberts served as the first executive assistant to premier Joey Smallwood starting in 1964. He entered provincial politics two years later, running in the 1966 Newfoundland general election for the provincial Liberals. He was elected to the House of Assembly, representing the riding of White Bay North. He was subsequently named first parliamentary assistant to Smallwood, before being appointed minister of public welfare in July 1968, and minister of health a year later. It was in that last role that Roberts presided over the implementation of Newfoundland&#x27;s healthcare system. Moreover, the Health Sciences Centre hospital in St. John&#x27;s was built and the Memorial University of Newfoundland Faculty of Medicine was established during his time in office.

During his tenure in the legislature, Roberts became noted as a &quot;sharp-tongued debater&quot;, gaining the nickname &quot;Scrap&quot; from his closest friends. He won leadership of the provincial Liberals on the first ballot in February 1972, after Smallwood initially left politics, and consequently became Leader of the Opposition. Two years later, he fended off a challenge from Smallwood for the party leadership, retaining it in two ballots. Smallwood then formed a breakaway party called the Newfoundland Reform Liberal Party, which led to the Liberal vote being split in the 1975 election and the Progressive Conservatives maintaining power. Two years later, Roberts lost the party leadership to Bill Rowe. Roberts continued to sit in the legislature and served as House Leader for a time, before leaving politics for the first time in 1985.

===Second stint===
Roberts initially declined a request by Liberal leader Clyde Wells before the 1989 election to return to politics. He eventually relented and was appointed Minister of Justice and Attorney General, as well as Government House Leader, in February 1992. Roberts was the last unelected individual to be appointed to the provincial cabinet until Judy Manning in 2014. He proceeded to run in the by-election for Naskaupi in Labrador four months later and won the seat, despite the fact that he did not reside in Labrador. He was subsequently returned in the general election the following year. He remained justice minister briefly under Brian Tobin until retiring from politics the second and final time in March 1996, two months after Wells&#x27; own retirement. Roberts was the only person to serve as a cabinet minister in the province&#x27;s first three Liberal governments, those of Smallwood, Wells, and Tobin, with a political career spanning thirty years.

After retiring from politics, Roberts served as chairman of the Board of Regents of Memorial University of Newfoundland from 1997 until his appointment as lieutenant governor in 2002. In that capacity, he pledged to expand the university&#x27;s infrastructure and innovative programs.

==Lieutenant governor==
Roberts was appointed lieutenant governor of Newfoundland and Labrador in November 2002 by governor general Adrienne Clarkson, on the advice of prime minister Jean Chrétien. During his tenure, he made Government House more accessible to the public and permitted media access. He also oversaw the inaugural installation of members of the Order of Newfoundland and Labrador through his appointment as Chancellor of the order. He became Honorary Chief of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary in February 2003, and Honorary Colonel of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in September that year. His term as lieutenant governor was due to expire in 2007, but he was asked by prime minister Stephen Harper in September 2007 to remain in his post for four more months. Roberts&#x27; term concluded on February 4, 2008, and he was succeeded by John Crosbie.

==Awards and honours==
Roberts was appointed a member of the Order of Canada in May 2009 and invested eleven months later in April 2010. This was in recognition of &quot;his contributions as a former cabinet minister and lieutenant governor of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador&quot;. He was granted an honorary Doctor of Law by Memorial University of Newfoundland in 2003.

==Personal life==
Roberts was married to Eve Roberts, who was also a lawyer, until his death on January 14, 2022, at their home in the St. John&#x27;s area, aged 81. They had two daughters, Catherine and Caroline.

<doc id="671557" wikidata="Q5271621" url="?curid=671557" title="Dianella, Western Australia">
<text>Dianella is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. It is within the local government area of the City of Stirling.

Dianella was named after the botanical title of a small blue lily, &quot;Dianella revoluta&quot;, a narrow-leafed plant that was plentiful in the area prior to residential development.

== History ==
Early development of the area was slow, as the sandy soil, part of the Banksia sandplain, was considered unsuitable for agriculture. Much of Dianella was subdivided in the 1880s by the Intercolonial Investment Company of Sydney, but growth was still slow and by 1919, the only development was along Walter Road, a track leading to dairy farms in the Morley area. Dianella comprised localities known as North Inglewood, East Yokine, Morley Park and Bedford Park. They were amalgamated into Dianella in 1958, which generated some growth.

Development progressed during the 1960s and housing construction first occurred north from Walter Road and Grand Promenade, with St Andrews, Montclair Rise and Dress Circle Estates being the last major areas to be developed in the early 2000s. The character of housing ranges from modest post-war homes to large, modern two storey dwellings.

Dianella was Perth and Western Australia&#x27;s media centre; with three of Perth&#x27;s major commercial television stations based there until Channel 7 relocated to Osborne Park in 2015. Channel 9 and Channel 10 left the suburb in 2016 and are now in St Georges Terrace and Subiaco, respectively.

== Recreation facilities ==
There are a number of small parks in Dianella and a large regional open space. Vicinity Centres Dianella is the major shopping centre in the suburb, with several smaller local stores. Education is provided by a number of primary schools as well as high schools in Mirrabooka and Morley.

Dianella Regional Open Space is at the junction of Alexander Drive and Morley Drive and provides a landscape feature for the suburb as well as sporting facilities. The area is home to a number of sporting codes, including lacrosse, football, little athletics, soccer and cricket as well as many more indoor sports..

== Demography ==
Dianella lies at the heart of Perth&#x27;s small Jewish community. Although this is the third largest Jewish community in Australia, numbers have never reached more than 6000 members (the most recent Australian census put Western Australia&#x27;s entire Jewish community at 5,300 members). Dianella itself is home to a number of community institutions such as a Jewish day school (Carmel), a sports club, an aged home (Maurice Zeffert Home) and a small synagogue known as &quot;Dianella Shul&quot;. A number of streets in the region are named after Jewish icons such as Menora, Maccabean and Golda Meir. Despite a small but steady stream of Jewish immigration from South Africa and China, specifically Kaifeng, the community in Dianella and surrounding suburbs is shrinking as many young people leave Perth, mainly heading to the larger Australian Jewish communities in Melbourne and Sydney.

Dianella is also part of Perth&#x27;s small Greek community, the second biggest hub for the Greek Orthodox Community in Perth, the biggest being in the centre of Northbridge. During the early 1990s, the Greek community of Perth wanted a Greek Orthodox College so that children of Greek origin could learn the Greek language and to be engaged in the Greek culture while going to school. Today, there is a Greek day school (St Andrew&#x27;s Grammar) which is located in the St Andrews Land Estate and a small Greek Orthodox Church (Agios Nectarios) located in the northern sector of the suburb just next to the Dress Circle Land Estate. Next to the Greek Orthodox College there is a Greek retirement home (Hellenic Community Aged Care). Some streets in the northern sector of the suburb have names of Greek origin such as Hellenic Drive in the St Andrews Land Estate.

<doc id="671562" wikidata="Q338300" url="?curid=671562" title="Fables of the Reconstruction">
<text>Fables of the Reconstruction (or Reconstruction of the Fables) is the third studio album by American alternative rock band R.E.M. It was released on June 10, 1985, through I.R.S. Records. It was the band&#x27;s first album recorded outside of the U.S., with sessions taking place at Livingston Studios in London with producer Joe Boyd. The record displays a darker, murkier sound than its predecessors, with lyrics drawing from Southern Gothic themes and characters. The album also utilizes more varied instrumentation, including string and brass arrangements and banjo.

Critical reception to &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; was positive, with many reviews noting its folk elements and murky tone. Retrospectively, it has also been viewed as a transitional album, retaining the sound and obscure themes of the band&#x27;s early work while hinting at the experimentation with acoustic instrumentation that would be present on their later albums. The album&#x27;s sales reflected R.E.M.&#x27;s growing popularity, with it becoming their second album to reach the top 30 in the US and first to make the top 40 in the UK. It was later certified Gold by the RIAA in 1991. While none of its singles achieved mainstream chart success, &quot;Driver 8&quot; has since become one of R.E.M.&#x27;s best-known and most-covered songs from their early period.

==Production==

After working with Don Dixon and Mitch Easter on their first two albums, &quot;Murmur&quot; (1983) and &quot;Reckoning&quot; (1984), R.E.M. decided to work with a different producer for their next album. Those considered to produce the album included Van Dyke Parks, Hugh Padgham (who had been achieving great success with his work with acts such as the Police and Genesis), Elliot Mazer (known for working with Neil Young), and Elvis Costello. Parks was lead vocalist Michael Stipe&#x27;s first choice; Parks had recently released the album &quot;Jump!&quot; (1984), which was based on the Uncle Remus folk tales which had been popular in the Southern United States during the post-Reconstruction era, and thus Stipe felt that Parks would be the right fit for the Southern Gothic-influenced material he was writing at the time.

The band ultimately chose to work with London-based producer Joe Boyd. Guitarist Peter Buck, particularly, wanted to work with Boyd, known for his work with folk rock acts such as Nick Drake, Fairport Convention, and Richard and Linda Thompson. After having recorded their first two albums in North Carolina, the band instead flew to England to record the album at Livingston Studios in Wood Green, London. Conditions were less than ideal, as the band had a long commute from their lodging in Mayfair to the studio and London was at the tail end of a rough winter; Buck recalled that &quot;It rained every day it wasn&#x27;t snowing&quot;. Boyd&#x27;s work ethic reportedly caused tensions with the band, as his precise attention to detail contrasted with the more spontaneous approach the band had utilized on the previous two albums. Dixon and Easter had worked quickly and encouraged the band to experiment; in contrast, Boyd spent hours mixing and remixing songs, which the band felt removed some of the energy and spontaneity of their performances.

Boyd would later describe the recording period as &quot;not the best time in my life&quot;, but recalled that &quot;[the band] seemed to get along better than most groups I’ve worked with&quot; even though their relationships were somewhat strained at the time. He described them as &quot;the most well-organized, professional group of people I’ve ever encountered.&quot; He felt that R.E.M.&#x27;s approach to mixing was unique in comparison to other acts: &quot;When you mix a record, traditionally the singer wants his voice louder, and the guitar player says, &#x27;Turn up the guitar,&#x27; and the bass player says, &#x27;Can’t you make the bass parts punchier?&#x27; With R.E.M., everyone wanted themselves turned down&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; mixes the band&#x27;s established style with folk elements and a darker sound. Writers have labeled the album as jangle pop, folk rock, alternative country, and Southern rock. Described by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine as &quot;creepy, rustic psychedelic folk&quot;, the album introduced new instrumentation for the band, including strings, brass, and banjo. Prior to the recording of the album, Stipe studied Appalachian music and took an interest in oral storytelling, both of which influenced the material. The combination of the album&#x27;s sound and the Southern focus of its lyrics have many critics to declare &quot;Fables&quot; R.E.M.&#x27;s most &quot;Southern&quot; album, as well as an example of Southern Gothic. Many of its songs describe eccentric, unusual characters; Matthew Perpetua of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the album&#x27;s aesthetic as &quot;evok[ing] images of railroads, small towns, eccentric locals, oppressive humidity, and a vague sense of time slowing to a crawl.&quot;

Opening track &quot;Feeling Gravitys Pull&quot; starts with a dark, chromatic guitar riff played by Buck. The song&#x27;s lyrics reference artist Man Ray and include imagery relating to lucid dreaming. The dreary tone of the song is augmented by the use of a string trio; in a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Parke Puterbaugh described the song&#x27;s cello part as &quot;seem[ing] to drag down and halt time&quot; and adding to its &quot;unnerving&quot; and &quot;dirgelike&quot; feel. Like many of R.E.M.&#x27;s songs, &quot;Maps and Legends&quot; uses bassist Mike Mills&#x27; backing vocals as counterpoint to Stipe during the chorus. Its lyrics were inspired by Howard Finster, a Baptist minister and outsider artist who had created the album art for &quot;Reckoning&quot; the previous year. Tyler Golsen of &quot;Far Out&quot; described &quot;Driver 8&quot; as a &quot;classic railroad song&quot; and a showcase for Buck&#x27;s playing as both an &quot;intricate picker&quot; and a &quot;folky rock star&quot;.

&quot;Life and How to Live It&quot; takes inspiration from a book entitled &quot;Life: How to Live&quot; by eccentric Athens–based author Brivs Mekis. Mekis split his house into two distinct halves and alternated between living in the two until he died. After his death, copies of the book were found; despite these copies being made none had ever been sold or given away. &quot;Old Man Kensey&quot; likewise &quot;celebrate[s] an eccentric individual living in the Deep South.&quot; Writing for &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;, Andrzej Lukowski describes the song as &quot;a nightmarish tale of a crazed old guy.&quot; Lead single &quot;Cant Get There from Here&quot; incorporates soul and funk influences and a horn section. Perpetua described the song as &quot;approximated Southern funk&quot;, while Puterbaugh felt it &quot;sets a tone of dislocation that pervades the entire record&quot;. &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot; was written as part of a pact between Stipe and 10,000 Maniacs frontwoman Natalie Merchant that both would write a song about the genocide of Native Americans; the 10,000 Maniacs song &quot;Among the Americans&quot;, from their 1985 album &quot;The Wishing Chair&quot;, was Merchant&#x27;s contribution.

&quot;Kohoutek&quot; features Stipe&#x27;s falsetto singing. According to Lukowski, Stipe&#x27;s lyrics on this song are more personal, and associate himself with the other outcast characters on the record. Tim Peacock of uDiscoverMusic describes &quot;Auctioneer (Another Engine)&quot; as &quot;atypically jagged and aggressive&quot; for the band, with its &quot;urgent, anthemic sound&quot; hinting at the direction the band would take with &quot;Lifes Rich Pageant&quot; the following year. Parke has described &quot;Good Advices&quot; (as well as &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot;) as &quot;Byrds-like balladry.&quot; Lukowski refers to its lyrics as &quot;paranoid but strangely reassuring old time wisdom.&quot; Closing track &quot;Wendell Gee&quot; features Buck playing banjo; continuing the album&#x27;s theme of eccentric characters, Puterbaugh considers its lyrics to be a &quot;surreal, lachrymose fable about some back-country oddball.&quot;

==Release==

Work on &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; finished in early April, and the album was released on June 10, 1985. The album&#x27;s packaging leaves it unclear as to whether its true title is &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; or &quot;Reconstruction of the Fables&quot;, with the sleeve featuring two &quot;front covers&quot; each displaying one of the two titles. This extends to the record label, where side one is referred to as &quot;a side&quot; and displays the album name as &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; whilst side two is labeled &quot;another side&quot; and displays &quot;Reconstruction of the Fables&quot;.
In the US, &quot;Fables&quot; peaked at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 (one spot lower than &quot;Reckoning&quot;). The album would be certified Gold by the RIAA for sales in excess of 500,000 copies on June 24, 1991. The album reached number 35 on the UK Albums Chart, making it the band&#x27;s first to reach the top 40 of that chart. It was also the band&#x27;s first record to chart in Canada, reaching number 40, while in New Zealand it peaked at number 29.

&quot;Cant Get There from Here&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single. While it failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, it did reach number 10 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100. The song achieved more success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Rock Tracks chart, peaking at number 14: their highest placement on that chart at the time. &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine described the single as having &quot;a fully rocking chorus and a typically steady and murky verse [which gives] this cut superior pop character as well as giving mainstream listeners a taste of what college radio has known about for years.&quot; Both 7&quot; and 12&quot; versions of the single were released; the 7&quot; was backed with the non-album track &quot;Bandwagon&quot;, while the 12&quot; version included both &quot;Bandwagon&quot; and another previously unreleased song, &quot;Burning Hell&quot;, on its B-side.

&quot;Driver 8&quot;, the album&#x27;s second single, also charted on the Top Rock Tracks chart, reaching a peak of number 22. The B-side of the single included a cover of &quot;Crazy&quot; by fellow Athens band Pylon. &quot;Driver 8&quot; has become one of R.E.M.&#x27;s most-covered songs, with versions being recorded by acts including Hootie &amp; the Blowfish and Jason Isbell. &quot;Wendell Gee&quot; was released as the third and final single in Europe only and became the first R.E.M. song to reach the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 91.

==Critical reception==

Contemporary critical reception for &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; was generally positive. In a review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Parke Puterbaugh awarded the album four stars out of five, referring to it as &quot;unretouched R.E.M. in all their rough-cut glory&quot;, and felt the band sounded &quot;surer than they did on &quot;Reckoning&quot;&quot;. He likened the album&#x27;s style to the &quot;insular mood weaving&quot; of &quot;Murmur&quot;. Robert Christgau declared that Boyd&#x27;s production confirmed that the band&#x27;s &quot;formal frame of reference is folk rock&quot; but that the band was able to &quot;defeat folk rock&#x27;s crippling stasis: they have a good beat, and you can boogie to them&quot;.

Retrospective reviews have also been positive. In a review for AllMusic, Erlewine states that despite finding the album to be less consistent than the band&#x27;s first two, it does &quot;demonstrate musical growth, particularly in how perfectly it evokes the strange rural legends of the South.&quot; He goes on to list &quot;Feeling Gravitys Pull&quot;, &quot;Maps and Legends&quot;, &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot;, &quot;Auctioneer (Another Engine)&quot;, and the first two singles as &quot;among the group&#x27;s best&quot; songs. Scott Gordon of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; feels that &quot;Fables&quot; is the record where R.E.M. &quot;mastered the art of effortlessly mismatching itself from album to album, and even song to song.&quot; He also highlights the eerie atmosphere of the album, stating that songs such as &quot;Green Grow the Rushes&quot; and &quot;Good Advices&quot; &quot;might have otherwise fit beautifully&quot; on the band&#x27;s first two records, but instead, in the context of &quot;Fables&quot;, &quot;trade some of the band&#x27;s early understatement for suspense.&quot;

Matthew Perpetua&#x27;s review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; describes the album as &quot;overlooked and transitional&quot;, and considers it to be a &quot;dark and murky set with a textural palette close to the muted earth tones of its packaging.&quot; Like Erlewine, he finds the album to be less consistent than its two predecessors, but still praises it as &quot;great&quot; and &quot;inspired&quot;. In a review for &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot;, Lukowski refers to &quot;Fables&quot; as a &quot;Southern Gothic masterpiece&quot;. She considers it an &quot;infinitely detailed&quot; album which &quot;rewards patience&quot;, while describing it as a &quot;dark, dissonant record&quot;. Jonathan Keefe of &quot;Slant&quot; feels that &quot;Fables&quot; is R.E.M.&#x27;s most thematically cohesive album. He considers its lyrics to not be &quot;simply a retelling of [its] myths or a hagiography for these men&quot;, referring to the characters featured throughout the album&#x27;s songs. Rather, he feels they display &quot;pointed, thoughtful consideration of what these stories mean and, specifically, of how Stipe perceives them.&quot;

===Band opinions===

The members of R.E.M. have expressed varying opinions on &quot;Fables&quot; since its release. In 1987, drummer Bill Berry bluntly stated that &quot;Fables&quot; &quot;sucked&quot;. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview from 1991, Buck was dismissive of &quot;Driver 8&quot;, saying, &quot;I can write that kind of stuff in my sleep. We all can.&quot; However, Stipe, who once infamously compared the album&#x27;s sound to &quot;two oranges being nailed together&quot;, stated in the same 1991 interview that he believed &quot;Fables&quot; contained the band&#x27;s strongest set of songs up to that point. Buck has since spoken positively about &quot;Fables&quot;, stating in the liner notes of the album&#x27;s 25th anniversary reissue: &quot;Over the years, a certain misapprehension about &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; has built up. For some reason, people have the impression that the members of R.E.M. don&#x27;t like the record. Nothing could be further from the truth. [...] It&#x27;s a personal favorite, and I&#x27;m really proud of how strange it is. Nobody but R.E.M. could have made that record.&quot;

<text>Gwelup is a suburb of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia 12 km north of Perth&#x27;s central business district (CBD) along the Mitchell Freeway. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

==History and environment==
The name &quot;Gwelup&quot; refers to a small swamp located within the southern portion of the suburb. It was derived from the Noongar word &quot;Gwelgannow&quot; meaning &quot;to shift position&quot;. Hence, Lake Gwelup was referred to as &quot;the lake that shifts position&quot;. The name first appears in Lands Department records in 1878 as &quot;Gwelup Swamp&quot;.

Situated on the western side of the suburb of Gwelup, lies the remainder of the once broader Lake Gwelup and accompanying bushland nature reserve. As one of the few wetlands that has a mostly intact native bushland, Lake Gwelup is home to a wide variety of local and visitor birds (waders, raptors, ducks etc.) as well many frogs (notably Moaning Frogs &quot;Heleioporus eyrei&quot;), reptile species (e.g. dugites, skinks and long necked turtles). Native flora in the bushland include Marri (&quot;Corymbia calophylla&quot;), Jarrah (&quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot;), Flooded Gum (&quot;E. rudis&quot;), Tuart (&quot;E. gomphocephela&quot;) as well as at least four species of Banksia, many annual wildflowers (incl. orchids) and fungi. One of the most spectacular species of visiting birds is the Rainbow Bee-eater (&quot;Merops ornatus&quot;).

Throughout the wetland regions, Aboriginal people hunted for kangaroo, emu, snakes, tortoise, mudfish, gilgies and water birds and their eggs, to name a few food sources. Aboriginal sites are known to have existed in a few locations in the Gwelup-Balcatta region.

Land near Lake Gwelup was first granted to Thomas Mews in 1831. It passed through several owners before being acquired by Henry Bull of Sydney in 1891. Gwelup was subdivided by Henry Bull during 1898 and 1899; however, development was relatively slow and the land was used mainly for market gardens in the early years. In the 1960s, the area which presently accommodates The Willows Estate also offered a 6 hectare peat deposit which was mined for local agriculture. From the 1970s, Gwelup transformed from a rural area to a modern residential suburb. Only a few market gardens along North Beach Road remain as a reminder of earlier times. The Mitchell Freeway&#x27;s extension to Erindale Road in 1984 and to Ocean Reef Road in 1986-87 facilitated the area&#x27;s development.

The triangle bounded by Lake Gwelup, Porter Street and North Beach Road is the oldest residential section, having been opened up by the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority in 1967 for urban development - other parts were built and settled in the late 1990s when the swamps were drained. Controversy has arisen as to the effect of both the draining and of some building practices on the groundwater in the catchment region.

==Geography and hydrography==
Gwelup is bounded by Lake Gwelup, the Mitchell Freeway to the east, Old Balcatta Road to the north (Reid Highway, accessible via Duffy Road, is located just a few hundred metres further north) and Karrinyup Road to the south. Due to Gwelup&#x27;s swampy nature and the Lake Gwelup Reserve, considerable tracts of land remain undeveloped. Peaty soils around the lake region that have been reclaimed, now feature the highest concentrations of dissolved arsenic in the world - some 25000 ug/L (some 400 times higher than that identified as safe levels for drinking water). It is well known among scientific communities that disturbance of acid sulphate soils causes the release of As, iron sulfides and other chemicals. In the previous 32 years prior to 2000, the lake was recorded to dry out twice, since that year the lake barely remained wet once over the summer in 2005/2006. The lowered water tables can be blamed on reduced rainfall and over consumption of regional scheme waters.

At the 2006 Australian census, Gwelup had a mostly white middle-income population of 3,239 people living in 1,102 dwellings. The type and style of residential dwellings contained within Gwelup varies considerably, ranging from early market garden cottages to recently designed two-storey developments. New subdivisions, including Karrinyup Waters, Settlers Green and The Willows, contain modern architecturally designed homes. Along North Beach Road, there are remnants of older, rural-style housing. These character homes are gradually being renovated or replaced by new developments.

==Facilities==
Gwelup is a residential suburb, with the Gwelup Plaza neighbourhood shopping centre which meets daily shopping needs. Nearby Karrinyup Shopping Centre provides other services. The suburb contains Lake Gwelup Primary School, originally opened in 1914 in two wooden school buildings which are now heritage-listed, and currently new buildings being built, Gwelup falls within Carine Senior High School&#x27;s catchment area.

Gwelup has significant areas of public open space scattered throughout the residential area, offering meeting places and recreational opportunities for the local and wider community. Lake Gwelup, a reserve vested in the City of Stirling and centred on the 25 hectare Lake Gwelup Wetland, preserves a significant part of the natural environment, while allowing passive recreation. There are also tennis courts and cycle paths located on the Lake Gwelup Reserve.

Careniup Swamp, the wetland which gave its name to nearby Karrinyup, was formerly bounded by Gribble Road, Balcatta Road, North Beach Road and the freeway. Much of it was drained for housing in the mid-1990s, but the northwestern section of it has been preserved as a wetland and recreation area.

A volunteer conservation group (&quot;The Friends of Lake Gwelup est. 1994&quot;) work closely with the local government and local residents on local environmental matter, develop a species list for flora, fauna and fungi in the area and produce a quarterly newsletter.

==Transport==
Gwelup&#x27;s northern and southern sections respectively are served by Transperth 424 and 427 bus routes from Stirling railway station, which is a nine-minute commute to Perth&#x27;s central business district. The 424 service links the suburb with Karrinyup Shopping Centre. All bus services are operated by Swan Transit.

In 1925, the North Beach Bus Company was started by Alf Lehman with crimson charabancs. It was taken over by the James family in 1928, in an era when REO buses drove over plank roads through the wetlands between modern-day Tuart Hill and North Beach. The company was taken over by the Metropolitan Transport Trust on 30 September 1961.

As part of the planning process for the Northern Suburbs Transit System, planners left themselves with a number of options for future stations along the line. One of these options included a location along the railway line near Wishart Street in the Mitchell Freeway reserve. This still remains as a long-term option for the line.

==Politics==
Gwelup is a reasonably affluent suburb with many &quot;mortgage belt&quot; families and socially liberal voters. It consistently supports the Liberal Party at both federal and state elections.

<text>Hamersley is a residential suburb north-northwest of the central business district of Perth, the capital of Western Australia, and six kilometres (4 mi) from the Indian Ocean. The suburb adjoins two major arterial roads—Mitchell Freeway to the west and Reid Highway to the south—and is within the City of Stirling local government area. It was built during the late 1960s and 1970s as part of the Government of Western Australia&#x27;s response to rapidly increasing land prices across the metropolitan area.

Before development, Hamersley was a remote district covered in jarrah, marri, banksia and other vegetation typical of the Swan Coastal Plain, with small areas cleared for small-scale agriculture such as market gardening and poultry farming. By 1974, six years after the first subdivision, Hamersley was home to the district&#x27;s first community hall, an annual parade and fair which were broadcast on Perth TV and radio, an active progress association, and its own newspaper, the &quot;Hamersley Gazette&quot;, a forerunner to today&#x27;s &quot;Stirling Times&quot;. Rapid growth further north removed the focus from Hamersley, which was completed in 1981 and has remained relatively stable since then.

Significant reserves of remnant bushland remain in parts of the suburb. The largest of these is an exclusion zone around the ABC radio tower in the suburb&#x27;s southeast, which broadcasts AM stations to the Perth metropolitan area. The guyed tower was built in 1939 and is a landmark in the region, although it has been a local political issue since the 1980s.

== Geography ==
Hamersley is in the northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia, within the City of Stirling, and from the Indian Ocean. Its borders are the Mitchell Freeway to the west, Reid Highway and the Balcatta industrial area to the south, Wanneroo Road to the east, and Beach Road and the City of Joondalup to the north. The suburb is divided into western and eastern portions by Erindale Road. Hamersley was one of the first Perth suburbs to be guided by the principles of cul-de-sac design.

Hamersley covers and averages above sea level, although portions of the loop formed by Rannoch Circle in the eastern portion are above sea level. A real estate magazine remarked in 1994 that &quot;homes around the Rannoch circle enjoy some spectacular views to the city and the hills&quot;, and that &quot;a few lucky householders... could even catch ocean glimpses, despite being more than six kilometres from the water.&quot;

The restricted-access bushland reserve surrounding the ABC radio tower in the suburb&#x27;s southeast covers 14.4% () of its area, while parks and areas of natural bushland are spread throughout. The largest of these are Aintree-Eglinton Reserve, a grassed reserve next to the community centre complex, and Rannoch-Tay-Earn Reserve, a reserve containing large areas of native bushland interspersed with grassed and paved walkways. A biodiversity site north of the community centre is recognised by the City of Stirling&#x27;s Green Plan 2.

Streets in western Hamersley are generally named after English towns, while eastern Hamersley uses the names of Scottish Highland and Perthshire towns and lochs. There are exceptions – the origins of Vickers Street precinct street names are unknown, while streets in the south-western corner are named after the &quot;Bentley Boys&quot;, a group of British racing drivers from the 1920s and 1930s, and their car designer Walter Owen Bentley.

=== Natural history ===
Hamersley&#x27;s soil is an infertile yellow-brown sand composed of fine to coarse quartz grains, with Tamala Limestone beneath. Locally known as Karrakatta Sand, it is almost certainly the leached remnants of coastal sand deposited by eolian processes in the late Pleistocene period, between 11,000 and 100,000 years ago. Below the sand are Paleozoic rocks of the Perth Basin. The sand contains an unconfined aquifer with large supplies of low-salinity potable groundwater which is recharged by rainfall.

As with other infertile areas of the Swan Coastal Plain, Hamersley would have supported open forests of &quot;Eucalyptus marginata&quot; (jarrah) with &quot;Corymbia calophylla&quot; (marri) or &quot;Eucalyptus gomphocephala&quot; (tuart), and an understorey of &quot;Banksia attenuata&quot; (candlestick banksia), &quot;B. menziesii&quot; (firewood banksia), &quot;B. grandis&quot; (bull banksia), &quot;Allocasuarina fraseriana&quot; (western sheoak) and &quot;Agonis flexuosa&quot; (Swan River peppermint). The main shrub species would have been &quot;Jacksonia sternbergiana&quot; (Stinkwood), &quot;J. furcellata&quot; (Grey Stinkwood), &quot;Acacia cyclops&quot; (Coastal Wattle), &quot;Acacia saligna&quot; (orange wattle), &quot;Hibbertia&quot; species, &quot;Allocasuarina humilis&quot; (dwarf sheoak), &quot;Calothamnus quadrifidus&quot; (one-sided bottlebrush) and &quot;Grevillea thelemanniana&quot; (spider net grevillea). Biodiversity surveys in 2006 have also identified a relatively rare species, &quot;Jacksonia sericea&quot; (waldjumi), in two eastern Hamersley reserves.

== History ==

=== Name ===
Hamersley was named after the Hamersley family who arrived in the colony of Western Australia in 1837 and established themselves at Guildford. There is no evidence they ever visited modern Hamersley, but in 1869 they built a summer home in what is now North Beach, to the west, and bought considerable holdings in the area over the following years.

The name first came into use to describe the north-western section of the Perth Road District in 1906. Hamersley Ward was a large area of land covering what is now Hamersley, Carine, Watermans Bay, North Beach, Gwelup and parts of Balcatta, Karrinyup and Trigg. The Hamersley townsite, consisting of Hamersley Ward, was gazetted in 1945. As a result, many facilities in North Beach, including a primary school, a golf course, several sporting clubs and residents&#x27; and seniors&#x27; associations, were called Hamersley. After the Hamersley Development Scheme started in 1968, confusion as to exactly what Hamersley referred to led to conflict between established organisations in North Beach and emerging ones in Hamersley – the &quot;Hamersley Gazette&quot; noted in 1973 that &quot;North Beach people have the prior claim but ours is more officially accepted&quot;.

The suburb was gazetted as a locality by the City of Stirling on 24 October 1975, although it had existed as a postal locality since 1971.

=== Early history ===

Before European settlement, Hamersley was part of a larger area of land that was occupied by the Mooro people, an Indigenous Australian people who traversed the lakes and wetlands running parallel to the coast between what is now Perth and Yanchep.

Soon after the establishment of the Swan River Colony, colonial authorities divided up the land into grants which were given to settlers who had brought capital into the new settlement. Southern Hamersley became part of Location K, a strip of land extending west from Caversham on the Swan River to Big Carine Swamp, which was granted to Robert Ansell Partridge in September 1829. The western part of this, first surveyed by P.L.S. Chauncy in 1843, remained fairly inaccessible, and the only development in the area was the construction of the Daviot Park cottage on Old Balcatta Road southwest of Hamersley. By the late 1930s, portions in the far west and south-east of the suburb had been cleared for small-scale agriculture such as market gardening, and in 1939 the Department of the Interior constructed a tower and other facilities for ABC AM and shortwave radio broadcasts on Wanneroo Road.

Northern Hamersley, meanwhile, became part of Swan Location 1315, which extended north to Lake Goollelal and west to the coast and was granted in the 1890s to the Midland Railway Company after being surveyed by Crossland &amp; Co. in 1892, and by N. Lymburner in 1894. It appears that no development occurred in northern Hamersley, other than the construction of Beach and Carine Roads in 1900, and the State Housing Commission resumed the land in November 1950. In 1962, a lucerne grower with a property on Duffy Road, Carine applied to use the northern half of the suburb as a sheep run. The Shire President, Herbert R. Robinson, refused to grant permission, saying that &quot;land might soon be needed for housing&quot;. &quot;The West Australian&quot; reported in 1967 that the area was still &quot;virtually untouched bushland&quot;.

=== Hamersley Development Scheme ===

In the late 1960s, concern about the growth of land prices in the Perth metropolitan area, which for several years had exceeded the consumer price index, led to the premier of Western Australia, David Brand, convening an inter-departmental committee to study the problem. One of the committee&#x27;s recommendations to Cabinet was to release of land owned by the State Housing Commission in Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood which was on a much larger area that had been designated as &quot;deferred urban&quot; land under the Metropolitan Region Scheme in 1963. On 13 December 1967, the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority decided to rezone as urban all land bounded by Hepburn Avenue, Marmion Avenue, North Perimeter Highway and Wanneroo Road, on the condition that subdivision would be approved when &quot;Town Planning (Development) Scheme(s) have been approved with the general object of serving the best possible development at the least cost to the community&quot;.

The shires of Perth and Wanneroo combined to prepare Town Planning Scheme No.26 (Hamersley Development Scheme), and by early March 1968, the scheme, which included provisions for water supply, sewerage, drainage, road construction and undergrounding of power mains, was presented to both councils for consideration. A time limit of years for developers to construct homes on released land was built into the scheme in an effort to prevent land speculation, which the inter-departmental committee believed was a key factor in spiralling prices in Perth. By July, however, negotiations between the councils broke down, and the Shire of Perth (now City of Stirling) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently. The scheme was divided into nine sections, with what is now the suburb of Hamersley being the first stage.

In April 1968 the R&amp;I Bank, a government-owned bank, was granted permission to subdivide a small area in northern Ardleigh Crescent in the suburb&#x27;s west. The first auction of 80 lots on Saturday, 14 December 1968 was anticipated on the front page of &quot;The West Australian&quot;, with Premier Brand advising intending buyers to be cautious about their bids. At the auction, 76 lots were sold at an average price of $4,784, compared to $6,700 at a recent R&amp;I Bank sale in the nearby suburb of Karrinyup, with newspapers agreeing that the Premier&#x27;s warning had been heeded by bidders.

The western portion of Hamersley grew steadily over the following months and years, with segments being released, auctioned and developed by the R&amp;I Bank, T&amp;S Plunkett Homes and Parkland Housing. The Hamersley Development Scheme, however, was doomed almost before it started. Disagreements over issues such as undergrounding of power and the time limit clauses between the Town Planning Board and the Shire of Perth had caused delays in the scheme&#x27;s approval. In July 1970, the Shire Planner reported that &quot;there is little point in proceeding with the Scheme, especially in view of the large areas already subdivided&quot;, and recommended the council agree &quot;that for all practical purposes, Town Planning Scheme No. 26. is defunct&quot;. By the February 1971 state election, over 1,000 eligible voters lived in the district.

=== Suburban development ===

In June 1970, the Metropolitan Region Planning Authority released land in the southwestern corner of Hamersley, which had previously been held in reserve under the Metropolitan Region Scheme for a large freeway interchange between the future Mitchell Freeway (then known as Stephenson Freeway) and Reid Highway (North Perimeter Freeway). The result of these changes was to allow the construction of Walter Way, Dutton Crescent and connecting streets, which were named after racing drivers from the 1920s and 1930s.

Between 1971 and 1973, reserves, public recreation areas and drainage sites were set aside in western Hamersley, and facilities were erected in quick succession – the 1st Hamersley Scout Group in 1973, the colonial-style Holy Cross Anglican Church in 1974, and a community hall at Aintree Street in 1975. Residents in the region were at this time on the fringe of Perth&#x27;s suburban area, relying on partly built main roads, distant shopping centres and overstretched local facilities for several years after the suburb&#x27;s construction. A locally produced fortnightly newspaper, the &quot;Hamersley Gazette&quot;, started in early 1973 by Peter Flanigan, from his home in Manton Court, covering the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood, with the open aim of helping to form community associations and campaign for better facilities. A July 1973 article, for example, lamented that &quot;work on Erindale Road appears to have come to a standstill... great piles of dirt and unmade road surfaces bear testimony to the fact that something is going on, or should be going on, but this one is taking a very long time.&quot;

However, there were also celebrations – the paper reported in detail on the annual Glendale Spring Fair, held between 1973 and 1976 by the Glendale P&amp;C Association on the second Saturday in November. It included activities for children, marching bands provided by The Salvation Army and the Australian 10th Light Horse Regiment, and a parade along Glendale Avenue and Beach Road at 10:30 am. Intended originally as a fundraiser for the school, the &quot;Gazette&quot; reported that it was &quot;a sort of glorified féte that rapidly outgrew its origins&quot;, with live coverage of the parade on ABC radio and on television station TVW-7 and personalities such as Jeff Newman in attendance. The fair, however, became the victim of a dispute over naming rights between the Glendale P&amp;C, community groups and commercial sponsors. Other events included the grand opening of Warwick Grove Shopping Centre on 13 November 1974, the greening of Aintree-Eglinton Reserve and the activities of the Hamersley Progress Association. The paper was acquired in February 1977 by Bill Marwick of the &quot;Wanneroo Times&quot;, and evolved into the &quot;Stirling Times&quot; in 1980.
Meanwhile, work was only starting in eastern Hamersley. In 1973 Project Homes acquired a poultry farm and agricultural holding, and completed the construction of Vickers Street and adjoining roads, with Don Place becoming a display village. In 1974 the City of Stirling agreed, after complex negotiations, to sell of land comprising Carine Road and Allen Street to the State Housing Commission and to the War Service Homes Commission in order to &quot;facilitate a satisfactory subdivisional design of adjoining land held by the State Housing Commission&quot; in the eastern portion of the suburb. All that remains of these two early roads are paved pathways within the Rannoch-Tay-Earn Reserve, which was gazetted in 1976. By July 1975, 200 defence service homes were under construction on land immediately to the east of Erindale Road, to be made available to veterans from March 1976. The rest of eastern Hamersley was built over the next few years, and by 1981 development was essentially complete. The community hall was redeveloped into a full-fledged community centre, which officially opened in 1990.

Despite Hamersley&#x27;s stability in the years since 1981 and its relatively low crime rate, it has periodically drawn the attention of the Perth media. In July 2000, a man bludgeoned his former girlfriend, mother-of-two Deborah Boyd, to death in a rented home in Brabant Way. He was subsequently sentenced to strict-security life imprisonment. On 23 January 2006, a large scrub fire caused the closure of Reid Highway and delays in rail line services during the afternoon rush hour.

== Demographics ==
Hamersley had a population of 5,209 at the 2021 census. This was an increase on the 4,982 recorded at the 2016 and 2011 censuses, and the 4,965 recorded at the 2006 census, but a decrease on the 5,233 recorded at the 2001 census.

== Amenities and facilities ==
Hamersley is a residential suburb, relying on the Warwick Grove shopping centre on its northern boundary for commercial services, and is by road from Karrinyup Shopping Centre. A light industrial area is to the south in Balcatta which includes a large Bunnings Warehouse on Erindale Road approximately south of Hamersley.

Aintree-Eglinton Reserve, a grassed area covering , contains a cricket pitch, several practice runs and night lights for Australian rules football, which are utilised by local amateur and junior clubs. Within the reserve is the Hamersley Community Recreation Centre, first built in the 1970s as a community hall and opened in its present form on 22 April 1990. The centre is a small village area consisting of a central pergola crossed with walking paths, flanked by four buildings: a sports hall with basketball courts and kiosk, an arts and crafts building, a community hall and function building hosting discos and other social events, and a purpose-built children&#x27;s centre. Near the centre are the 1st Hamersley Scout Group, a child health centre and the Holy Cross Anglican Church, a colonial-style building built in 1974 and consecrated on 14 December 1980 to serve the newly formed Balcatta-Hamersley Parish.

Numerous small parks are throughout all parts of Hamersley, usually joining the ends of several cul-de-sacs. 

The southeastern corner contains the ABC 50 kW radio tower which transmits ABC AM radio in Perth, including ABC Local Radio (6WF), Radio National and ABC NewsRadio. Several other towers, including a 20 kW and 10 kW tower, are also at the site. Some residents argue that electromagnetic interference from the towers is adversely affecting their television and telephone reception, with the issue taken up in Federal parliament by local MPs. An inquiry was held by ACMA in November 2010 into the situation, which found that apart from some disturbance to ABC2 signals, TV and radio signals in the area were of acceptable strength and quality.

== Education ==
Hamersley contains two state primary schools, each of which includes facilities for pre-primary students, and a teaching resource centre. Hamersley is within the catchment area for Warwick Senior High School for students from Years 8 to 12. 
 In 2016, the school provided for 248 primary students between Year 1 and Year 6, and 28 pre-primary students.

 In the 1990s, the West Coast Resource Centre, a specialist borrowing library for teachers of kindergarten, pre-primary and primary classes, was built on the East Hamersley site by the Department of Education (now Education and Training) to serve schools in the northern suburbs.

== Transport ==
Cars are the most common mode of transport for Hamersley residents. At the 2021 census, 69.6% of employed residents used a car to get to work, either as the driver or passenger. This figure is close to the state average of 68.8%. 8.0% of employed residents took public transport to work, slightly above the state average of 7.4%.

=== Public transport ===
At the 2011 census, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that 13.9% of Hamersley&#x27;s residents used public transport to get to work. This was a sizable jump from 8.5% in the 2006 census, and was higher than the north-western metropolitan average of 13.1%. Public transport usage was highest (16.8%) in the section of Hamersley closest to the train station, and lowest (8.3%) in the Vickers Street section to the southeast, where many residents live more than 10 minutes&#x27; walk from the nearest bus stop.

Currently, the only service in the suburb is the 387 daytime service between Warwick and Perth via Balcatta Road, which travels along Eglinton Crescent. Eastern Hamersley does not have a direct service, other than those along Erindale and Wanneroo Roads. However, service along Wanneroo Road is very limited outside standard weekday hours.

Originally, Hamersley was served by a shuttle service to Wanneroo Road, Nollamara, to connect with other routes to the Perth CBD. In September 1973, the Metropolitan Transport Trust introduced the 358 and 359 services, which linked Greenwood to Perth via Eglinton Crescent and Glendale Avenue/Aintree Street respectively, travelling along Blissett Way, then becoming limited-stops Wanneroo Road services. An after-hours service, the 369, was also introduced. In 1987, following the construction of the Warwick Transfer Station and the Mitchell Freeway, services along Glendale Avenue and through East Hamersley ceased, with two new routes – the 347 and the Freeway-bound 387 – being created to serve Eglinton Crescent.

On 21 March 1993, the Joondalup line (now known as the Yanchep line) came into operation as part of the Northern Suburbs Transit System, resulting in the creation of the 449 and 457 services to replace the 387 service. The 449 operated only during the morning and evening rush-hour, while the 457 operated after-hours and at weekends. These services operated virtually unchanged until 6 November 2011, when the 347 was replaced with the present-day 387, and the 457 and weekday evening services were withdrawn. On 31 January 2016, the 449 was also withdrawn, leaving Hamersley without weekend bus services.

== Politics ==
Hamersley has consistently favoured the centre-right Liberal Party at both federal and state elections throughout its history. However, in the 2001 and 2005 state elections and at the 1983 federal election, Hamersley booths recorded a majority for the centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP). Hamersley has also shown a higher preference than the regional average for progressive minor parties such as the Australian Greens and Australian Democrats. Hamersley is both socially and geographically between the safe Liberal suburbs west of the Mitchell Freeway such as Carine, Duncraig and North Beach, and the safe Labor suburbs east of Wanneroo Road such as Balga and Girrawheen.

At federal level, Hamersley is within the Division of Stirling, a marginal seat which historically has alternated between the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party. It has been held since 2004 by Michael Keenan of the Liberal Party. At polling place and subdivision level, Hamersley has supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1972, the only exception being the 1983 election. In the 2001 election, the booth at East Hamersley Primary School was only won by the Liberal Party with a 0.3% two-party-preferred majority. Hamersley was in the Division of Cowan for elections held between 1984 and 1996.

In the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, Hamersley is split between the electorates of Girrawheen and Balcatta, ordinarily both safe seats for the Australian Labor Party. At polling place level, Hamersley supported the Liberal Party at every election since its first in 1971 until the 1996 election. In both the 2001 and 2005 elections, polling places in Hamersley, as with those in many northern Perth suburbs, switched to the Australian Labor Party at state level. However, at the 2008 and 2013 elections, the suburb returned a majority for the Liberals.

At local level, Hamersley is represented within the City of Stirling by the two councillors of the Hamersley Ward, which covers the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Gwelup and northern Balcatta. At present, Samantha Jenkinson, whose term expires in October 2019, and Andrew Guilfoyle, whose term expires in October 2017, represent Hamersley Ward.

In the early 1970s, the Hamersley Progress Association was formed to represent the views of Hamersley residents to all levels of government. It was, however, fairly short-lived. In 1999, the Hamersley Reference Group was formed to advise then-Federal Member for Stirling Jann McFarlane MHR on issues related to the ABC radio transmission towers and their effect on local residents. It was renamed to Radio Interference Group – Hamersley Towers after it moved to complete community management, and lobbies the government and makes submissions to public inquiries on behalf of the community on the issue.

Polling place statistics are presented below combining the votes from the Glendale and East Hamersley polling places in the federal and state elections as indicated.

<text>Herdsman is the suburb of Perth, Western Australia where Herdsman Lake and the surrounding Herdsman Lake Regional Park are situated. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

In the earlier days of settlement, cattle were raised near the lake area. In 1928, the Herdsman Lake Suburban Area was gazetted adjacent to the lake, covering parts of what are now Churchlands and Woodlands as well as the modern suburb of Herdsman.

In the 1980s swamp-land to the north of the lake was reclaimed by dredging to build Jon Sanders Drive and establish a light industrial park around Walters Drive. Prior to this, companies along Scarborough Beach Road backed on to the swamp. That area is now part of the light industrial suburb of Osborne Park, although some areas adjacent to Herdsman Lake Regional Park are still colloquially referred to as &quot;Herdsman&quot;.

<text>Inglewood is an inner-city suburb of Perth, Western Australia, north-east of its central business district. It is located within the local government area of the City of Stirling.

==History==
With a name thought to have been derived from the Norwegian barque &quot;Inglewood&quot; (its late nineteenth century voyage was mentioned in &quot;The West Australian&quot; on 24 May 1904), the suburb of Inglewood began when land was first granted to John Gregory in 1831. It is also plausible to derive that the suburb was named after the Inglewood Gold rush region of California given the suburb was developed during the gold boom era of the 1890s by a company calling itself Gold Estates of Australia. E.W. Hammer named part of the estate &quot;Inglewood Estate&quot; in 1895.

Regarded as part of Maylands in the early years, Inglewood was initially developed by a company called Gold Estates of Australia and a section now referred to as The Avenues was the first to be subdivided. This development included land from the railway line to North Street and eventually through to Eleventh Avenue and Dundas Road; the later subdivision was named Inglewood Estate.

==Residential development==
Inglewood has experienced two distinct booms in residential growth: between 1904 and 1920 single residential housing was built to accommodate the blue-collar population while more development occurred around World War Two between 1935 and 1940.

The majority of residences in Inglewood are of pre-war vintage (many are of a Federation or Californian bungalow style) and towards Mount Lawley a typical lot size is , increasing to up to east of Beaufort Street.

Inglewood has a high heritage value with numerous places of cultural and historical significance and many of the older dwellings have been renovated and restored to their original styles. In addition to character housing, there are 1960s apartments and modern unit developments scattered throughout the suburb.

==Community development==

The main commercial area within Inglewood is centred on Beaufort Street and contains retail services, a library and a recreation centre and there are several small shops that cater for daily needs.

Inglewood contains many recreational facilities, including the Terry Tyzack Aquatic Centre, Mount Lawley Golf Course and Macaulay Park, and there are facilities to play tennis and soccer, as well as bocce. Inglewood Primary School meets the educational needs for younger students while the Home of Peace provides services for elderly residents.

==Significant landmarks==
Significant landmarks include the prominent clock tower on the corner of Beaufort Street and Dundas Road, highly visible to northbound traffic along Beaufort Street, and the Inglewood Civic Centre, opened in 1991, incorporating the local library, an autumn centre and children&#x27;s centre. Inglewood Primary School, the major school for the area, is located just off Beaufort Street. The clock tower was originally part of a picture theatre - the Civic - and shopping complex designed, built, and owned by Tom Snooks (1890–1958) a local picture-show man and builder-developer from the 1910s to the 1940s. This heritage building complex has recently (2006–2008) been redeveloped for residential purposes.

The suburb contains a number of heritage-listed sites, including the Inglewood Post Office.

==Demographics==
Inglewood&#x27;s population at the Australian Bureau of Statistics&#x27;s 2016 census was 5,674. This is an increase on the 5,503 recorded at the 2011 census, 5,045 recorded at the 2006 census, and the 4,708 recorded at the 2001 census. 48.1% of residents are male, and 51.9% are female. The median age is 38, which is above the Western Australian average of 36, and 44.9% of residents over the age of 15 are married, which is below the state average of 48.8%. Out of the suburb&#x27;s 2,536 dwellings, 2,282 were occupied and 254 were not. Out of the 2,282 occupied dwellings, 1,403 were detached houses, 373 were semi-detached and 497 were apartments or flats. The proportion of apartments or flats, 21.8%, is significantly higher than Western Australia&#x27;s average of 5.7%. 614 were owned outright, 816 were owned with a mortgage, 772 were rented and 68 were other or not stated.

The median weekly household income was $1,832, which is higher than the state and the country, which are at $1,595 and $1,438 respectively. Major industries that residents worked in were hospitals (4.4%), state government administration (3.3%), primary education (2.8%), cafes and restaurants (2.8%), and legal services (2.6%).

The population of Inglewood is predominantly Australian born, with 65.9% of residents born in Australia, similar to the state&#x27;s average of 60.3%. The next most common birthplaces are England (6.7%), New Zealand (1.9%), Italy (1.4%), India (1.4%), and Ireland (1.2%). 38.5% of residents had both parents born in Australia, and 37.8% of residents have neither parent born in Australia. The most popular religious affiliations were none (36.6%), Catholic (27.6%), Anglican (11.9%) and Eastern Orthodox (3.0%).

==Education==
Inglewood Primary School is public primary school on Normanby Road in Inglewood. It has approximately 600 students from Kindergarten to year 6. It was established in 1927 as North Maylands School. It was renamed North Inglewood State School in 1933. It was renamed again to its present name in 1985.

St Peter&#x27;s Primary School is a Catholic primary school located on Wood Street, on Inglewood&#x27;s boundary with Bedford. It has approximately 700 students in three streams from Kindergarten to Year 6. The school first opened in 1941, occupying a single house. The school moved down the street to a new site in 1942, that being its current site. Expansions occurred in the 1950s, and in 1957, a secondary school for girls named St Thomas Aquinas College opened on the same site. The two schools would undergo significant improvements and renovations over the decades that followed.

Meanwhile, St Mark’s College, a secondary school for boys, was established on Beaufort Street in Bedford. In 1989, St Thomas Aquinas College and St Mark&#x27;s College merged to form Chisholm Catholic College. St Thomas Aquinas became the campus for lower school students, and St Mark&#x27;s became the campus for senior school students. In 2003, the school was consolidated on the Beaufort Street site, and the Wood Street site in Inglewood became solely for St Peter&#x27;s Primary School.

==Governance==
Inglewood is part of the Inglewood ward of the City of Stirling. Elections are held on the third Saturday of October for every odd year, and councillors are elected to four year terms. Councillors for the Inglewood ward are David Lagan, whose term expires in 2023, and Bianca Sandri, who is also the deputy mayor and whose term expires in 2021.

For the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, Inglewood is part of the electoral district of Maylands east of Hamer Parade and Walter Road West, and part of the electoral district of Mount Lawley west, although no residents live in that part. Both these electoral districts are part of the East Metropolitan electoral region in the Western Australian Legislative Council. Maylands is a strong seat for the centre-left Labor Party, having held Maylands since 1968. Maylands&#x27; current member is Lisa Baker.

Inglewood is within the Division of Perth in the Australian Federal Government. It is a safe seat for the Australian Labor Party, and has been held by a Labor member since 1983. Its current member is Patrick Gorman.

Inglewood has two locations that are usually used as polling locations at elections. They are Inglewood Primary School and Inglewood Masonic Hall.

==Transport==
The suburb is served by a number of Transperth bus routes operated by Path Transit. The 360, 361, 362 (Alexander Heights-Perth) and 960 (Mirrabooka-Perth-Curtin University) cover Alexander Drive. The 66, 67, 68, 950 and 16 buses pass through Inglewood along Walter Road and Beaufort Street.

<doc id="671601" wikidata="Q6035243" url="?curid=671601" title="Innaloo, Western Australia">
<text>Innaloo is a suburb of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, 9 km (5.6 mi) from Perth&#x27;s central business district in the local government area of the City of Stirling.

Innaloo is an established residential suburb that is home to the Westfield Innaloo and Westfield Innaloo Megacentre shopping centres, and is adjacent to Perth&#x27;s largest cinema complex, the 18-cinema Event Cinemas.

==Name==
Innaloo was originally named Njookenbooroo (sometimes spelt Ngurgenboro, Noorgenbora or similar variants), believed to be derived from the local Noongar name for Herdsman Lake or a nearby wetland.

The spelling and pronunciation (e.g. &quot;ny-ooken-borra&quot;) were deemed to be difficult to those unfamiliar with the name; in 1927, the local progress association asked welfare worker and anthropologist Daisy Bates to compile a list of possible alternative names, drawn from various Aboriginal languages. Bates&#x27; rendering of the personal name of a woman, &quot;Innaloo&quot; (from Dongara) was chosen.

Nevertheless, some local landmarks are still named &quot;Nookenburra&quot; – another variation of the original name.

The similarity of the name Innaloo to the phrase &quot;in a &quot; soon made the suburb the butt of many jokes. However, campaigns aimed at changing the name have failed to gain significant support.

==History==
===From settlement to suburb===
Land near Innaloo was first granted to Thomas Mews in 1831. In 1898, Town Properties of WA subdivided the lands around Njookenbooroo Swamp for sale as market gardens, and drained the swamp into Herdsman Lake over the following years, digging channels through the area to facilitate agriculture. They offered rent-free lease of the lots, with an option to later purchase at £100 per hectare if the occupants cleared them and brought them into production. The area between Hertha Road, Oswald Street and King Edward Road and Herdsman Lake was gazetted as the Njookenbooroo Drainage District, and by 1912, local market gardeners were turning off 25 tonnes of produce each week.

The Njookenbooroo School on Odin Road (then called Government Road), linked to the city by a plank road, was built in 1915. Although subdivision for southern Innaloo was approved in 1916, by the 1920s only ten houses had been built, with the majority of the land used for grazing. Residential development accelerated during World War II, and in the 1950s, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) built a drive-in cinema in nearby Liege Street.

===Development of modern Innaloo===

Development of the suburb was essentially complete by 1970, and its status increased due to its proximity to Scarborough Beach and the light industrial and commercial centre of Osborne Park, the building of the Nookenburra Hotel (1962) and shopping centre (1967) and the nearby civic centre in Hertha Road (1966).

Innaloo is also the home for the first Hungry Jack&#x27;s in Australia since 1971.

The Mitchell Freeway was extended to Hutton Street in 1981 and to Karrinyup Road in 1984. The shopping centre also hosted the region&#x27;s main bus station until the construction of Stirling bus/train interchange about a kilometre away in 1992. In 1999, Ellen Stirling Boulevard, named after the wife of the first governor of Western Australia, was constructed on land purchased from the last market gardeners in the area to replace the increasingly hazardous Oswald Street as the main through link between the freeway and the shopping areas.

==Geography==
Innaloo is bounded by Karrinyup Road to the north, Huntriss Road to the west, Scarborough Beach Road to the south and Mitchell Freeway and the future line of Stephenson Avenue to the east. The majority of the suburb is residential, apart from the shopping areas in the south-east, several small parks and an undeveloped portion to the east of Ellen Stirling Boulevard. Some of the undeveloped area next to Stirling station has been developed as a commercial area centred on a new IKEA store.

At the 2006 census, Innaloo had a mostly middle-income population of 6,470 people.
Most homes are single detached homes of timber-frame construction built around World War II, but some duplexes and recently built units also exist. A number of elderly homes including Geneff Village, named for Sorrento businessman and philanthropist George Geneff (who also built the Nookenburra Hotel), are located within the suburb.

==Facilities==

Innaloo contains the Westfield Innaloo shopping centre. Next to Westfield Innaloo on Ellen Stirling Boulevard is the Westfield Innaloo Megacentre (acquired from Centro in August 2006), which contains 20 stores and a grocery. Across Scarborough Beach Road is the Event Cinemas megaplex. The northern part of the suburb also contains a small local shopping area in Morris Place. Opposite the Megacentre, an IKEA has been constructed, replacing the smaller store a kilometre away in the adjoining suburb of Osborne Park.

Innaloo&#x27;s southern border with Woodlands hosts Perth&#x27;s largest cinema complex, the 18-cinema Event Cinemas megaplex Innaloo, which contain cinemas as well as an arcade with numerous restaurants and dining speciality outlets and a game centre (centred on Timezone). It started off life as an MGM drive-in in the 1950s, then was rebuilt by Greater Union in 1990 with 8 screens, then expanded to a Megaplex - the first in Western Australia - in 1996. During the 2000s Greater Union was replaced with Event Cinemas.

==Transport==
Innaloo is served by bus links to Stirling train station on the Yanchep line, including the 410, 412, 421, 424 and the 998/999 CircleRoute, and the 423 and 425 along the Karrinyup Road boundary. Additionally, the 990 services link Scarborough and the Glendalough railway station along Innaloo&#x27;s southern boundary.

Prior to the construction of the Stirling railway station as part of the Northern Suburbs Transit System, a possible deviation of the rail alignment was considered to directly service the suburb and its shopping district including Westfield Innaloo. However, this idea was rejected by both the project and the public at large due to the significant cost, lack of identifiable benefits, and environmental impact grounds.

==Politics==
Innaloo is a mixed-wealth suburb with many &quot;mortgage belt&quot; families, as well as many elderly voters. The Yuluma booth is among the northern suburbs&#x27; few genuinely marginal booths at federal level. However, they strongly support the Australian Labor Party at state elections.

<doc id="671621" wikidata="Q1048381" url="?curid=671621" title="Shanhai Pass">
<text>Shanhai Pass or Shanhaiguan () is the eastern end of the Great Wall of China and one of its major passes. It commands the narrowest choke point in the strategic Liaoxi Corridor, a crucial coastal landway between the North and Northeast China. It is located in Shanhaiguan District, Qinhuangdao, Hebei province, on the east bank of the Shi River between the Yan Mountains and the coast of Liaodong Bay.

In 1961, the pass was selected as a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level by the State Council of China, and it was listed as a World Heritage Site as part of the Great Wall by UNESCO in 1987.

The pass is a popular tourist destination at the eastern terminus of the Ming Great Wall. The location where the wall meets the Bohai Sea is nicknamed &quot;Old Dragon&#x27;s Head&quot; (老龙头). The pass lies nearly east of Beijing and is linked via the Jingshen Expressway that runs northeastward to Shenyang.

Throughout Chinese history, the pass served as a frontline defensive outpost against ethnic groups from Northeast China (Manchuria), including the Khitan and Jurchen (Manchus). Shanhai Pass is the eastern end of the Great Wall, and is the first barrier for guarding the frontier, therefore it is called the &quot;First Pass Under Heaven&quot; (天下第一关).

==History==
Located south of Yan Mountain, and north of the Bohai Sea, for centuries the pass guarded the narrow passage between Northeast and Central East China. The Northern Qi dynasty, Sui dynasty and the Tang dynasty constructed passes here. The site was called Yuguan during the Tang dynasty and by 785, a garrison was established there. Eight more garrisons were established from Yuguan to Jinniukou. During the Later Tang and Five Dynasties periods, the territory was controlled by autonomous governors. No garrisons (except Yuguan) remained by the Five Dynasties period. The area and the passes were then controlled by the Liao dynasty. The Liao founded Qianmin County east of Yuguan in present-day Shanhaiguan. Garrisons were built in the area under the Jin and Yuan dynasties. In 1381, Ming general Xu Da and his soldiers were ordered to repair the old Yongping (永平) and Jieling (界岭) passes. From this, they constructed the present pass, which was named Shanhaiguan (literally &quot;mountain-sea-pass&quot;) because of its location between the mountains and the sea. In the late 16th century, Ming general Qi Jiguang began fortification and construction of a military city around the pass, building cities and forts to the east, south and north, making it one of the most heavily fortified passes in China.

During the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign under the Qing dynasty, Shanhai Pass became the seat of Linyu County (临榆县城) under the jurisdiction of Yongping Mansion (永平府). In the late Qing dynasty, many forts were built to strengthen coastal defense. During the period of the Republic of China, the pass was successively under the control of Zhang Zuolin&#x27;s Fengtian clique, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist government, the Imperial Japanese Army, and the Jireliao Military Region (冀热辽军区). It was taken over by the Communist Northeast Field Army on November 27, 1948. After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Shanhai Pass was first under the jurisdiction of Liaoxi Province, and later under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province.

Shanhai Pass is one of the best preserved passes in the Great Wall.

===Later history===

During the Qing era, the Shanhai Pass, situated between Shenyang and Beijing, was referred to as the &quot;Key to the Capitals&quot;. During the Republican era, as well as during the Eight-Nation Alliance and World War II, the pass witnessed many conflicts.

The 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica noted:
&quot;SHANHAI-KWAN, a garrison town in the extreme east of the province of Chih-li, China. Pop. about 30,000. It is situated at the point where the range of hills carrying the Great Wall of China dips to the sea, leaving a kwon or pass of limited extent between China proper and Manchuria. It is thus an important military station, and the thoroughfare of trade between Manchuria and the great plain of China. The Imperial Northern railway from Tientsin and Taku, 174 m. from the former, runs through the pass, and skirts the shore of the Gulf of Liao-tung as far as the treaty port of Niu-chwang, where it connects with the railways leading from Port Arthur to the Siberian main line. The pass formed the southern limit of the Russian sphere of influence as defined in the convention between Great Britain and Russia of the 28th of April 1899.&quot;

In July1900, 15,000 Imperial Japanese Army troops landed at Shanhai Pass as part of the Eight-Nation Alliance, prior to marching on Beijing to relieve the Siege of the International Legations by the Boxers. A pre-landing bombardment of the area was unnecessary as few Chinese troops were present. Inter-allied relations were dealt a blow when a drunken fracas occurred at the Shanhai Pass between Japanese and French troops. In the fighting three French and seven Japanese soldiers were killed, and five French and 12 Japanese were wounded.

In November 1945, the North Eastern People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) attempted to hold Shanhaiguan against Kuomintang forces attacking from the south. They sought to keep Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist government out of Manchuria. The People&#x27;s Liberation Army forces of 10,000 were under equipped and too few to defend the position and retreated to Siping. Later, after the Communist Party began to gain the upper hand in the Chinese Civil War, the city became a destination for refugees fleeing the Liaoshen campaign.

===Battle of Shanhai Pass===

In 1644, Li Zicheng led a rebel army into the Ming dynasty capital of Beijing, marking the end of the Ming dynasty. After occupying the capital, Li attempted to enlist the support of Ming general Wu Sangui, commander of the powerful Ningyuan garrison north of the Great Wall. Rather than submit to Li&#x27;s new Shun dynasty, Wu contacted the Manchu Qing dynasty, suggesting that they combine forces to drive the rebels from the capital. Dorgon, regent of the Qing, marched his army to Shanhai Pass to receive Wu&#x27;s surrender. Together, Wu and the Manchus defeated Li Zicheng&#x27;s army near the pass, and Li was forced to abandon the capital. The Qing victory enabled their army to enter Beijing unopposed, and established them as the dominant power in China.

== Climate ==
The climate is hot-summer humid continental with a monsoon pattern (&quot;Dwa&quot;). The annual average temperature is , with an average daily minimum temperature of and an average daily maximum temperature of . The average annual precipitation is .

== Structure ==

The Shanhai Pass is built as a square, with a perimeter of around . The walls reach a height of , and are thick. The east, south and north sides are surrounded by a deep, wide moat with drawbridges over it. In the middle of the pass stands a tall bell tower.

All four sides of the Shanhai Pass once possessed a gate (), with the Zhèndōng Gate () in the east wall, the Yíng&#x27;ēn Gate () in the west, the Wàngyáng Gate () in the south, and the Wēiyuǎn Gate () in the north. Due to lack of repairs over the centuries, only the Zhèndōng Gate remains today. This was the most important gate due to its position, which faces outside the pass towards Beijing.

== Transport ==
Shanhaiguan railway station on the Beijing–Harbin railway and the Tianjian–Shanhaiguan railway is the nearest railway station to Shanhai Pass.

<doc id="671629" wikidata="Q8072735" url="?curid=671629" title="Zircon (satellite)">
<text>Zircon was the codename for a British signals intelligence satellite, designed to intercept radio and other signals from the USSR, Europe and other areas. It was intended to be launched in 1988 on a NASA space shuttle. However, the project was cancelled in 1987 because of its cost. Secrecy about the project&#x27;s cost, hidden from the British Parliament, resulted in the Zircon affair.

==History==
During the Cold War, Britain&#x27;s GCHQ often used the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for communications interception from space. Concern heightened at the time of the 1982 Falklands War. GCHQ requested access to American signals intelligence satellites to assist in monitoring Argentine communications, but reportedly struggled with the NSA to gain appropriate tasking time, despite the special relationship between the two countries. The United States satellites were engaged in monitoring SIGINT traffic elsewhere in South America related to El Salvador. GCHQ therefore decided to produce a UK-designed-and-built signals intelligence satellite, to be called Zircon, a code-name derived from zirconium silicate, a diamond substitute. Its function was to intercept radio and other signals from the USSR, Europe and other areas. The satellite was to be built at Marconi Space and Defence Systems at Portsmouth Airport, at which a new high security building had been built. It was to be launched on a NASA Space Shuttle under the guise of &quot;Skynet IV&quot; one of the British Skynet military communications satellites. Launch on the Shuttle would have entitled a British national to fly as a payload specialist and a group of military pilots were presented to the press as candidates for &#x27;Britain&#x27;s first man in space&#x27;.

Zircon was cancelled by Chancellor Nigel Lawson on grounds of its cost in 1987. However, Duncan Campbell, an investigative journalist working for &quot;New Statesman&quot; magazine, planned to make a BBC television programme about the project, part of a six-part series called &quot;Secret Society&quot;. Campbell&#x27;s thesis was that the cost of the satellite had been hidden from the British Parliament, in particular the Public Accounts Committee.

==Zircon affair==
As a result of TV interviews that where filmed with officials, particularly Sir Ronald Mason, the government&#x27;s chief scientific adviser to the MoD, the government became aware that Campbell knew about the project. Shortly before the programme was due to be transmitted, in January 1987 the &quot;New Statesman&quot; published an account of Zircon. This triggered Special Branch police raids on the BBC offices in Glasgow, the offices of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and the homes of Campbell and his researchers, Jolyon Jenkins and Patrick Forbes. Master tapes were removed from the BBC, the government obtained an injunction preventing transmission of the programme, and the BBC postponed the transmission of the entire series. Four episodes were transmitted in April and May 1987, and the Zircon programme was transmitted separately in September 1988. The sixth episode, titled &quot;Cabinet&quot;, was held back indefinitely, and eventually remade and broadcast by Channel 4 in April 1991.

<text>Coleoptile is the pointed protective sheath covering the emerging shoot in monocotyledons such as grasses in which few leaf primordia and shoot apex of monocot embryo remain enclosed. The coleoptile protects the first leaf as well as the growing stem in seedlings and eventually, allows the first leaf to emerge. Coleoptiles have two vascular bundles, one on either side. Unlike the flag leaves rolled up within, the pre-emergent coleoptile does not accumulate significant protochlorophyll or carotenoids, and so it is generally very pale. Some preemergent coleoptiles do, however, accumulate purple anthocyanin pigments.

Coleoptiles consist of very similar cells that are all specialised to fast stretch growth. They do not divide, but increase in size as they accumulate more water. Coleoptiles also have water vessels (frequently two) along the axis to provide a water supply.

When a coleoptile reaches the surface, it stops growing and the flag leaves penetrate its top, continuing to grow along. The wheat coleoptile is most developed in the third day of the germination (if in the darkness).

Early experiments on phototropism using coleoptiles suggested that plants grow towards light because plant cells on the darker side elongate more than those on the lighter side. In 1880 Charles Darwin and his son Francis found that coleoptiles only bend towards the light when their tips are exposed. Therefore, the tips must contain the photoreceptor cells although the bending takes place lower down on the shoot. A chemical messenger or hormone called auxin moves down the dark side of the shoot and stimulates growth on that side. The natural plant hormone responsible for phototropism is now known to be indoleacetic acid (IAA).

The Cholodny–Went model is named after Frits Warmolt Went of the California Institute of Technology and the Ukrainian scientist Nikolai Cholodny, who reached the same conclusion independently in 1927. It describes the phototropic and gravitropic properties of emerging shoots of monocotyledons. The model proposes that auxin, a plant growth hormone, is synthesized in the coleoptile tip, which senses light or gravity and will send the auxin down the appropriate side of the shoot. This causes asymmetric growth of one side of the plant. As a result, the plant shoot will begin to bend toward a light source or toward the surface.

Coleoptiles also exhibit strong geotropic reaction, always growing upward and correcting direction after reorientation. Geotropic reaction is regulated by light (more exactly by phytochrome action).

== Physiology ==
The coleoptile acts as a hollow organ with stiff walls, surrounding the young plantlet and the primary source of the gravitropic response. It is ephemeral, resulting in rapid senescence after the shoot emerges. This process resembles the creation of aerenchyma in roots and other parts of the plant. The coleoptile will emerge first appearing yellowish-white from an imbibed seed before developing chlorophyll on the next day. By the seventh day, it will have withered following programmed cell death. The coleoptile grows and produces chlorophyll only for the first day, followed by degradation and water potential caused growth. The two vascular bundles are organized parallel longitudinally to one another with a crack forming perpendicularly. Greening mesophyll cells with chlorophyll are present 2 to 3 cell layers from epidermis on the outer region of the crack, while non-greening cells are present everywhere else. The inner region contains cells with large amyloplasts supporting germination as well as the most interior cells dying to form aerenchyma.

The length of the coleoptile can be divided into an irreversible fraction, length at turgor pressure 0, and reversible fraction, or elastic shrinking. Changes induced by white light increase water potential in epidermal cells and decrease osmotic pressure, which resulted in an increase in the length of the coleoptile. The presence of the expanding coleoptile has also been shown to support developing tissues in the seedling as a hydrostatic tube prior to its emergence through the coleoptile tip.

Adventitious roots initially derive from the coleoptile node, which quickly overtake the seminal root by volume. In addition to being more numerous, these roots will be thicker (0.3–0.7mm) than the seminal root (0.2–0.4mm). These roots will grow faster than the shoots at low temperatures and slower at high temperatures.

== Anaerobic germination ==
In a small number of plants, such as rice, anaerobic germination can occur in waterlogged conditions. The seed uses the coleoptile as a &#x27;snorkel&#x27;, providing the seed with access to oxygen.

<text>Guy Charles Clark (November 6, 1941 – May 17, 2016) was an American folk and country singer-songwriter and luthier. He released more than 20 albums, and his songs have been recorded by other artists, including Townes Van Zandt, Jerry Jeff Walker, Jimmy Buffett, Kathy Mattea, Lyle Lovett, Ricky Skaggs, Steve Wariner, Emmylou Harris, Rodney Crowell, Steve Earle, Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Nanci Griffith and Chris Stapleton. He won the 2014 Grammy Award for Best Folk Album: &quot;My Favorite Picture of You&quot;.

==Career==
Clark was born in Monahans, Texas. His family moved to Rockport, Texas in 1954. After he graduated from high school in 1960, he spent almost a decade living in Houston as part of the folk music revival in that city. His wife Susanna Talley Clark and he eventually settled in Nashville, where he helped create the Americana genre. His songs &quot;L.A. Freeway&quot; and &quot;Desperados Waiting for a Train&quot; helped launch his career and were covered by numerous performers, including Steve Earle, Jerry Jeff Walker, Nanci Griffith, and Brian Joens. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described him in its obituary as &quot;a king of the Texas troubadours&quot;, declaring his body of work &quot;as indelible as that of anyone working in the Americana idiom in the last decades of the 20th century&quot;.

Clark had been a mentor to such other singers as Noel McKay, Steve Earle and Rodney Crowell. He organized Earle&#x27;s first job as a writer in Nashville. In the 1970s, the Clarks&#x27; home in Nashville was an open house for songwriters and musicians, and it features in the film &quot;Heartworn Highways&quot;, an evocation of the songwriter scene in Nashville at that time.

Numerous artists have charted with Clark-penned tunes. &quot;The Last Gunfighter Ballad&quot; was the title song of Johnny Cash&#x27;s 1977 studio album. In 1982, Bobby Bare made it to the Country Top 20 with Clark&#x27;s &quot;New Cut Road&quot;. That same year, bluegrass leader Ricky Skaggs hit number one with Clark&#x27;s &quot;Heartbroke&quot;, a song that permanently established his reputation as an ingenious songwriter. Among the many others who have covered Clark&#x27;s songs are Vince Gill, who took &quot;Oklahoma Borderline&quot; to the Top 10 in 1985; The Highwaymen, who introduced &quot;Desperados Waiting for a Train&quot; to a new generation that same year; John Conlee, whose interpretation of &quot;The Carpenter&quot; rode into the Top 10 in 1987; and John Denver, who recorded Clark&#x27;s &quot;Homegrown Tomatoes&quot; in 1988. Clark is frequently referred to as the Fifth Highwayman.

Steve Wariner took his cover of Clark&#x27;s &quot;Baby I&#x27;m Yours&quot; to number one in 1988; Asleep at the Wheel charted with Clark&#x27;s &quot;Blowin&#x27; Like a Bandit&quot; the same year. Crowell was Clark&#x27;s co-writer on &quot;She&#x27;s Crazy for Leavin&#x27;&quot;, which in 1989 became the third of five straight number-one hits for Crowell. Brad Paisley and Alan Jackson covered Clark&#x27;s &quot;Out in the Parkin&#x27; Lot&quot;, co-written with Darrell Scott, on Paisley&#x27;s &quot;Time Well Wasted&quot; CD. Jimmy Buffett, obviously influenced by Jerry Jeff Walker&#x27;s earlier quality cover of &quot;Boats to Build&quot; on 1997&#x27;s &quot;Cowboy Boots &amp; Bathin Suits&quot;, then covered Clark&#x27;s &quot;Boats to Build&quot; and &quot;Cinco de Mayo in Memphis&quot;. Clark credits Townes Van Zandt as being a major influence on his songwriting. One of the most famous photos in country music history was taken on Clark&#x27;s porch in 1972 of Clark, wife Susanna, Van Zandt, and Daniel Antopolsky by photographer Al Clayton. Clark and Van Zandt were best friends for many years until Van Zandt&#x27;s death in 1997, and Clark has included a Van Zandt composition on most of his albums. In 1995, he recorded a live album with Van Zandt and Steve Earle, &quot;Together at the Bluebird Cafe&quot;, which was released in October 2001. Other live material can be found on his album &quot;Keepers&quot;. Earle released the tribute album &quot;Guy&quot; in 2019.

In 2006, Clark released &quot;Workbench Songs&quot;. The album was nominated for Best Contemporary Folk/Americana Album at the Grammy Awards. He also toured with Lyle Lovett, Joe Ely, and John Hiatt in 2004, 2005, and 2007. In May 2008, Clark canceled four concerts after breaking his leg. After two months on crutches, he began to perform again on July 4 at the Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, DC, where he appeared with Verlon Thompson. On June 20, 2009, Clark announced a new album titled &quot;Somedays the Song Writes You&quot;, which was released on September 22, 2009. It features originals along with a Townes Van Zandt song titled &quot;If I Needed You&quot;.

In December 2011, &quot;This One&#x27;s for Him: A Tribute to Guy Clark&quot; (a two-CD set) was released by Icehouse Music and produced by longtime fan Tamara Saviano. The CD won Americana Album of the Year at the 2012 Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards. Clark won the Grammy Award for Best Folk Album in 2014 for &quot;My Favorite Picture of You&quot;.

The final song that Clark completed was co-written with Angaleena Presley and titled &quot;Cheer Up Little Darling&quot;. It appeared on Presley&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Wrangled&quot;.

Texas country singer/songwriter Aaron Watson paid tribute to Clark in his song entitled &quot;Ghost of Guy Clark&quot;, released in June 2019. In the song, Clark&#x27;s ghost asks the protagonist to perform a song and is unimpressed; he then encourages the performer to write songs with greater passion.

Gillian Welch and David Rawlings&#x27; song &quot;Hashtag&quot;, from their 2024 album &quot;Woodland&quot;, is a tribute to Clark and refers to the moment Welch found out about his death on social media, when his name was accompanied by a hashtag.

==Personal life==
Clark had one son, Travis Carroll Clark (December 18, 1966 - October 12, 2017; aortic aneurysm), from his first marriage to folksinger Susan Spaw. He
was married to songwriter and artist Susanna Clark from 1972 until her death from cancer on June 27, 2012.

On May 17, 2016, Clark died in Nashville following a lengthy battle with lymphoma at the age of 74.

<text>The M687 was an American 155 mm binary sarin chemical artillery shell. The design was standardized in 1976 and production began on December 16, 1987 at Pine Bluff Arsenal, Pine Bluff, Arkansas. Production was halted three years later, following the 1990 Chemical Weapons Accord between the United States and the USSR, and the dismantling of existing stocks began in November 1997 at Hawthorne Army Depot, Nevada. America&#x27;s remaining stocks were stored at the Deseret Chemical Depot, Utah, and the Umatilla Chemical Depot (Umatilla County, Oregon).

The shell contained two canisters separated by a rupture disk. The compartments were filled with two liquid precursor chemicals for sarin (GB2): methylphosphonyl difluoride (denominated DF) and a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and isopropyl amine (denominated OPA) is in a second canister. The isopropyl amine binds the hydrogen fluoride generated during the chemical reaction. When the shell was fired the force of the acceleration would cause the disk between them to breach and the spinning of the projectile facilitated mixing. The two precursor chemicals would react in flight to produce sarin and when the shell reached its target the sarin would be released.

The shells were meant to be stored and transported with only the OPA compartment loaded; the fuze and the DF compartment would be inserted shortly before firing.

The M687 was never used in combat and, under the Chemical Weapons Convention, the U.S. destroyed the shells and the precursor chemical DF as part of its agreement to eliminate all chemical weapons. More than 258,000 of the shells were shipped to Hawthorne Army Depot from their storage at Deseret Chemical Depot, Utah, and the Umatilla Chemical Depot, Oregon and were destroyed by July 1999. The last of the U.S.&#x27;s stockpile of DF was destroyed on April 6, 2006.

<text>Robert Ferdinand Wagner I (June 8, 1877May 4, 1953) was a Prussian-born American attorney and Democratic Party politician who represented the state of New York in the United States Senate from 1927 to 1949.

Born in Prussia, Wagner immigrated to the United States with his family in 1885. After graduating from New York Law School, Wagner won election to the New York State Legislature, eventually becoming the Democratic leader of the New York State Senate. Working closely with fellow New York City Democrat Al Smith, Wagner and Smith embraced reform, especially to the benefit of their core constituency, the working class. They built a coalition for these reforms that embraced unions, social workers, some businessmen, and numerous middle-class activists and civic reform organizations across the state. Wagner left the state senate in 1918, and served as a justice of the New York Supreme Court until his election to the U.S. Senate in 1926.

As a Senator, Wagner was a leader of the New Deal Coalition, putting special emphasis on supporting the labor movement. He was a close associate and strong supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He sponsored three major laws: the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (also known as the Wagner Act), the Social Security Act of 1935, and the Housing Act of 1937. Wagner resigned from the Senate in 1949 due to ill health, and died in 1953. His son, Robert F. Wagner Jr., was mayor of New York City from 1954 through 1965.

==Early life and education==
Robert Ferdinand Wagner was born on June 8, 1877, in Nastätten, Hesse-Nassau, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire (now in Rhein-Lahn-Kreis, Rhineland-Palatinate, Federal Republic of Germany). The family immigrated to the United States in 1885 and settled in New York City&#x27;s Yorkville neighborhood, where Wagner attended the public schools. His father was a janitor.

He graduated from the College of the City of New York (now named City College of New York) in 1898, where he was a brother of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity and from New York Law School in 1900. He was admitted to the bar in 1900.

==Political career==
As a young lawyer he became part of the Tammany Hall Democratic machine in Manhattan. He was elected to New York State Assembly in 1905 (New York Co., 30th D.), 1907 and 1908 (both New York Co., 22nd D.).

===New York State Senate ===

He was a member of the New York State Senate (16th D.) from 1909 to 1918, sitting in the 132nd, 133rd, 134th, 135th, 136th, 137th, 138th, 139th, 140th and 141st New York State Legislatures. He was President pro tempore of the New York State Senate from 1911 to 1914. Wagner became Acting Lieutenant Governor of New York after the impeachment of Governor William Sulzer, and the succession of Lieutenant Governor Martin H. Glynn to the governorship. In 1914, while Wagner remained President pro tempore, John F. Murtaugh was chosen Majority Leader of the State Senate. That was the only time before 2009 that the two offices were not held by the same person. After the Democrats lost their Senate majority, Wagner was Senate Minority Leader from January 1915 until he retired in 1918.

In the aftermath of the horrible Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, he was Chairman of the State Factory Investigating Committee (1911–1915). His Vice Chairman was fellow Tammany Hall politician, Al Smith. They held a series of widely publicized investigations around the state, interviewing 222 witnesses and taking 3500 pages of testimony. They started with the issue of fire safety and moved on to broader issues of the risks of injury in the factory environment. Their findings led to 38 new laws regulating labor in New York State and gave each of them a reputation as leading progressive reformers working on behalf of the working class. In the process, they changed Tammany&#x27;s reputation from mere corruption to progressive endeavors to help workers.

Wagner was a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Conventions of 1915 and 1938 and a justice of the New York Supreme Court from 1919 to 1926.

===U.S. Senate===

Wagner was elected as a Democrat to the United States Senate in 1926 and re-elected in 1932, 1938, and 1944. He resigned on June 28, 1949, due to ill health. He was unable to attend any sessions of the 80th or 81st Congress from 1947 to 1949 because of a heart ailment. Wagner was the Chairman of the Committee on Patents in the 73rd Congress, of the Committee on Public Lands and Surveys in the 73rd and 74th Congresses, and of the Committee on Banking and Currency in the 75th through 79th Congresses. He was a delegate to the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, in 1944.

Wagner, who had known the future President when they were in the New York state legislature together, was a member of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Brain Trust. He was very involved in labor issues, fought for legal protection and rights for workers, and was a leader in crafting the New Deal.

In April 1943, a confidential analysis by British scholar Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office stated of Wagner:
:a veteran Liberal Tammany statesman, author of the United States labour code and devotee of the New Deal who is respected by the White House for his political acumen within his own State no less than for his political connexions. Greatest champion of the Liberal cause in the United States Senate since [George W.] Norris. A typical anti-Nazi German Democrat who has supported all the Administration measures, being usually well in advance of them.

His most important legislative achievements include the National Industrial Recovery Act in 1933 and the Wagner–Steagall Housing Act of 1937. After the Supreme Court ruled the National Industrial Recovery Act and the National Recovery Administration unconstitutional, Wagner helped pass the National Labor Relations Act (also known as the Wagner Act) in 1935, a similar but much more expansive bill. The National Labor Relations Act, perhaps Wagner&#x27;s greatest achievement, was a seminal event in the history of organized labor in the United States. It created the National Labor Relations Board, which mediated disputes between unions and corporations, and greatly expanded the rights of workers by banning many &quot;unfair labor practices&quot; and guaranteeing all workers the right to form a union. He also introduced the Railway Pension Law and cosponsored the Wagner–O&#x27;Day Act, the predecessor to the Javits–Wagner–O&#x27;Day Act.

Wagner was instrumental in writing the Social Security Act, and originally introduced it in the United States Senate.

The Wagner–Hatfield amendment to the Communications Act of 1934, aimed at turning over twenty-five percent of all radio channels to non-profit radio broadcasters, did not pass. In 1939 he co-sponsored with Representative Edith Nourse Rogers (R–MA) the Wagner–Rogers Bill to admit 20,000 Jewish refugees under the age of 14 to the United States from Nazi Germany, but the bill never passed.

Wagner and Edward P. Costigan sponsored a federal anti-lynching law in 1934. They tried to persuade President Roosevelt to support the bill but Roosevelt refused for fear of alienating Southern Democrats and losing their support for New Deal programs. There were 18 lynchings of blacks in the South in 1935, but after the threat of federal legislation, the number fell to eight in 1936 and to two in 1939.

On June 28, 1949, Wagner resigned from the Senate because of ill health; John Foster Dulles was appointed by Governor Thomas E. Dewey on July 7, 1949, to fill the vacancy temporarily.

==Personal life and death==

Wagner was raised as a Lutheran, but he became a Methodist in his college years and taught Sunday school; he converted to Roman Catholicism in 1946.

In 1908, Wagner married Margaret Marie McTague. She died in 1919. They had one son, Robert F. Wagner Jr.

In 1927, he received the first honorary citizenship of Nastaetten, his town of birth.

In the 1930s, Wagner dated the communist journalist Marguerite Young.

He died on May 4, 1953, in New York City, and was interred in Calvary Cemetery, Queens.

==Legacy==

His son Robert F. Wagner Jr. was Mayor of New York City from 1954 to 1965. His grandson, Robert (Bobby) Ferdinand Wagner III, was a Deputy Mayor, Director Urban Planning Commission and President of the New York City Board of Education in the 80s and 90s.

On September 14, 2004, a portrait of Wagner, along with one of Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg, was unveiled in the Senate Reception Room. The new portraits joined a group of distinguished former senators, including Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, Robert M. La Follette, and Robert A. Taft. Portraits of this group of senators, known as the &quot;Famous Five&quot;, were unveiled on March 12, 1959.

The public middle school located at 220 East 76th Street in New York City is named after him.

The former Wagner Hall on the campus of the City College of New York is named for him.

<text>Arthur Joyce Lunel Cary (7 December 1888 – 29 March 1957), known as Joyce Cary, was an Anglo-Irish novelist and colonial official. His most notable novels include &quot;Mister Johnson&quot; and &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Arthur Joyce Lunel Cary was born in 1888 in his grandparents&#x27; home, which was above the Belfast Bank on Shipquay Street in Derry in Ulster, the Northern province in Ireland. His family had been &#x27;Planter&#x27; landlords in neighbouring Inishowen, a peninsula on the north coast of County Donegal, also in Ulster, since the early years of the Plantation of Ulster in the early seventeenth century. However, the family had largely lost its Inishowen property on the western shores of Lough Foyle after the passage of the Irish Land Act in 1882. The family dispersed and Cary had uncles who served in the frontier US Cavalry and the Canadian North-West Mounted Police. Most of the Carys wound up in Great Britain. Arthur Cary, his father, moved to London in 1884 and trained as an engineer. He then married Charlotte Joyce, elder daughter of James John Joyce, manager of the Belfast Bank, Derry, in August 1887 and they settled in London. His mother died of pneumonia in October 1898.

Throughout his childhood, Cary spent many summers at his grandmother&#x27;s house in the north of Ireland and at Cromwell House in England, home of a great-uncle, which served as a base for all the Cary clan. Some of this upbringing is described in the fictionalised memoir &quot;A House of Children&quot; (1941) and the novel &quot;Castle Corner&quot; (1938) – i.e., Cary Castle, one of his family&#x27;s lost properties in Inishowen in Ulster. Although Cary remembered his West Ulster childhood with affection and wrote about it with great feeling, he was based in England for the rest of his life. The feeling of displacement and the idea that life&#x27;s tranquillity may be disturbed at any moment marked Cary and informs much of his writing. His health was poor as a child. He was subject to asthma, which recurred throughout his life, and was nearly blind in one eye, which caused him to wear a monocle when he was in his twenties. Cary was educated at Clifton College in Bristol, England, where he was a member of Dakyns House. His mother died during this period, leaving him a small legacy which served as his financial base until the 1930s.

In 1906, determined to be an artist, Cary travelled to Paris. Discovering that he needed more technical training, Cary then studied art in Edinburgh. Soon enough, he determined that he could never be more than a third rate painter and decided to apply himself to literature. He published a volume of poems which, by his own later account, was &quot;pretty bad,&quot; and then entered Trinity College, Oxford. There he became friends with fellow student John Middleton Murry and introduced Murry to Paris on a holiday together. He neglected his studies and graduated from Oxford with a fourth class degree.

==Nigeria and early writing==
Seeking adventure, in 1912 Cary left for the Kingdom of Montenegro and served as a Red Cross orderly during the Balkan Wars. Cary kept and illustrated a record of his experiences there, &quot;Memoir of the Bobotes&quot; (1964), that was not published until after his death.

Returning to Britain the next year, Cary sought a post with an Irish agricultural cooperative scheme, but the project fell through. Dissatisfied and believing that he lacked the education that would provide him with a good position in the United Kingdom, Cary joined the Nigerian political service. During the First World War, he served with a Nigerian regiment fighting in the German colony of Kamerun. The short story &quot;Umaru&quot; (1921) describes an incident from this period in which a British officer recognises the common humanity that connects him with his African sergeant.

Cary was wounded at the battle of Mount Mora in 1916. He returned to England on leave and proposed marriage to Gertrude Ogilvie, the sister of a friend, whom he had been courting for years. Three months later, Cary returned to service as a colonial officer, leaving a pregnant Gertrude in England. Cary held several posts in Nigeria including that of the magistrate and executive officer in Borgu. He began his African service as a stereotypical district officer, determined to bring order to the natives, but by the end of his service, he had come to see the Nigerians as individuals with hard lives.

By 1920, Cary was concentrating his energies on providing clean water and roads to connect remote villages with the larger world. A second leave had left Gertrude pregnant with their second child. She begged Cary to retire from the colonial service, so that they could live together in Britain. Cary had thought this impossible for financial reasons, but in 1920, he obtained a literary agent and some of the stories he had written while in Africa were sold to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, an American magazine, and published under the name &quot;Thomas Joyce&quot;. This provided Cary with enough incentive to resign from the Nigerian service and he and Gertrude took a house in Oxford on Parks Road opposite the University Parks (now marked with a blue plaque) for their growing family. They had four sons, including the composer, Tristram Cary, and the civil servant, Sir Michael Cary.

==As a novelist in the 1930s==
Cary worked hard on developing as a writer, but his brief economic success soon ended as the &quot;Post&quot; decided that his stories had become too &quot;literary&quot;. Cary worked on various novels and a play, but nothing sold, and the family soon had to take in tenants. Their plight worsened when the Depression wiped out the investments that provided them with income and, at one point, the family rented out their house and lived with family members. Finally, in 1932, Cary managed to publish &quot;Aissa Saved&quot;, a novel that drew on his Nigerian experience. The book was not particularly successful, but sold more than Cary&#x27;s next novel, &quot;An American Visitor&quot; (1933), even though that book had some critical success. &quot;The African Witch&quot; (1936) did a little better, and the Carys managed to move back into their home.

Although none of Cary&#x27;s first three novels was particularly successful critically or financially, they are progressively more ambitious and complex. Indeed, &quot;The African Witch&quot; (1936) is so rich in incident, character, and thematic possibility that it over-burdens its structure. Cary understood that he needed to find new ways to make the narrative form carry his ideas. George Orwell, on his return from Spain, recommended Cary to the Liberal Book Club, which requested Cary to put together a work outlining his ideas on freedom and liberty, a basic theme in all his novels. It was released as &quot;Power in Men&quot; (1939) [not Cary&#x27;s title], but the publisher seriously cut the manuscript without Cary&#x27;s approval and he was most unhappy with the book. Now Cary contemplated a trilogy of novels based on his Irish background. &quot;Castle Corner&quot; (1938) did not do well and Cary abandoned the idea. After this came one last African novel, &quot;Mister Johnson&quot; (1939), written entirely in the present tense. Although now regarded as one of Cary&#x27;s best novels, it sold poorly at the time. But &quot;Charley Is My Darling&quot; (1940), about displaced young people at the start of World War II, found a wider readership, and the memoir &quot;A House of Children&quot; (1941) won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for best novel.

==Final years==
Cary now undertook his great works examining historical and social change in England during his own lifetime. The First Trilogy (&quot;Herself Surprised&quot;, &quot;To Be a Pilgrim&quot;, and &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;) finally provided Cary with a reasonable income, and &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot; remains his most popular novel. Cary&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;The Case for African Freedom&quot; (1941), published by Orwell&#x27;s Searchlight Books series, had attracted some interest, and the film director Thorold Dickinson asked for Cary&#x27;s help in developing a wartime movie set partly in Africa. In 1943, while writing &quot;The Horse&#x27;s Mouth&quot;, Cary travelled to Africa with a film crew to work on &quot;Men of Two Worlds&quot;.

Cary travelled to India in 1946 on a second film project with Dickinson, but the struggle against the British for national independence made movie-making impossible, and the project was abandoned. &quot;The Moonlight&quot; (1946), a novel about the difficulties of women, ended a long period of intense creativity for Cary. Gertrude was suffering from cancer and his output slowed for a while. Gertrude died as &quot;A Fearful Joy&quot; (1949) was being published. Cary was now at the height of his fame and fortune. He began preparing a series of prefatory notes for the re-publication of all his works in a standard edition published by Michael Joseph.

He visited the United States, collaborated on a stage adaptation of &quot;Mister Johnson&quot;, and was offered an appointment as a CBE, which he refused. Meanwhile, he continued work on the three novels that make up the Second Trilogy (&quot;Prisoner of Grace&quot;, &quot;Except the Lord&quot;, and &quot;Not Honour More&quot;). In 1952, Cary had some muscle problems which were originally diagnosed as bursitis, but as more symptoms were noted over the next two years, the diagnosis was changed to that of motor neuron disease (known as Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease (ALS) in North America), a wasting and gradual paralysis that was terminal. As his physical powers failed, Cary had to have a pen tied to his hand and his arm supported by a rope to write. Finally, he resorted to dictation until unable to speak and then ceased writing for the first time since 1912. His last work, &quot;The Captive and the Free&quot; (1959), the first volume of a projected trilogy on religion, was unfinished at his death on 29 March 1957, aged 68.

==Legacy==

He had appointed his close friend Winnie Davin as his literary executor, and she supervised the transfer of his library to the Bodleian Library, posthumously published some unfinished works, and supported scholars who studied his papers. She also wrote Cary&#x27;s entry for the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;.

<text>Ightham Mote (), at Ightham, is a medieval moated manor house in Kent, England. The architectural writer John Newman describes it as &quot;the most complete small medieval manor house in the county&quot;. 

Ightham Mote and its gardens are owned by the National Trust and are open to the public. The house is a Grade I listed building, and parts of it are a Scheduled Ancient Monument.

==History==

===14th century–16th century===

The origins of the house date from circa 1340–1360. The earliest recorded owner is Sir Thomas Cawne, who fought in France with Edward the Black Prince and who acquired the Mote in the 1360s. He died in 1374 and there is a memorial to him in St Peter’s Church. In 1399 on the death of his son Robert the house passed by the marriage of Robert’s daughter Alice to Nicholas Haute and their descendants, their grandson Richard Haute being Sheriff of Kent in the late 15th century. It was then purchased in 1521 by the courtier Sir Richard Clement (d.1538). In 1591, Sir William Selby bought the estate.

===16th century-late 19th century===

The house remained in the Selby family for nearly 300 years. Sir William was succeeded by his nephew, also Sir William, who is notable for handing over the keys of Berwick-upon-Tweed to James I on his way south to succeed to the throne. He married Dorothy Bonham of West Malling but had no children. The Selbys continued until the mid-19th century when the line faltered with Elizabeth Selby, the widow of a Thomas who disinherited his only son. During her reclusive tenure, Joseph Nash drew the house for his multi-volume illustrated history &quot;Mansions of England in the Olden Time&quot;, published in the 1840s. A brownwash watercolour painting dated c.1828 by Samuel Palmer shows that part of the building had been converted to an oast house.

The house passed to a cousin, Prideaux John Selby, a distinguished naturalist, sportsman and scientist. On his death in 1867 he left the house to his daughter Lewis Marianne Bigge. Her second husband, Robert Luard (with whom she had two children, including the organist Bertram Luard-Selby, who had been born at Ightham Mote), changed his name to Luard-Selby. Ightham Mote was rented in 1887 to the American railway magnate William Jackson Palmer and his family and for three years became a centre for artists and writers of the Aesthetic Movement, with visitors including John Singer Sargent, Henry James and Ellen Terry. When Mrs Bigge died in 1889, the executors of her son Charles Selby-Bigge, a Shropshire land agent, put the house up for sale in July 1889.

===Late 19th century-21st century===

The Mote was purchased in 1889 by Sir Thomas Colyer-Fergusson. He and his wife brought up their six children at the Mote. In 1890–1891, he carried out much repair and restoration, which allowed the survival of the house after centuries of neglect. Ightham Mote was opened to the public one afternoon a week in the early 20th century.

Sir Thomas Colyer-Fergusson&#x27;s third son, Riversdale, died aged 21 in 1917 at the Third Battle of Ypres, and was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. A wooden cross in the New Chapel is in his memory. The oldest brother, Max, was killed at the age of 49 in a bombing raid on an army driving school near Tidworth in 1940 during World War II. One of the three daughters, Mary (called Polly) married Walter Monckton.

On Sir Thomas&#x27;s death in 1951, the property and the baronetcy passed to Max&#x27;s son, James. The high costs of upkeep and repair of the house led him to sell the house and auction most of the contents. The sale took place in October 1951 and lasted three days. It was suggested that the house be demolished to harvest the lead on the roofs, or that it be divided into flats. Three local men purchased the house: William Durling, John Goodwin and John Baldock. They paid £5,500 for the freehold, in the hope of being able to secure the future of the house.
In 1953, Ightham Mote was purchased by Charles Henry Robinson, an American of Portland, Maine, United States. He had known the property from vacations in England during the 1920s, and many years later happened to see the house for sale in &quot;Country Life&quot;. He lived there for only fourteen weeks a year for tax reasons. He made many urgent repairs, and partly refurnished the house with 17th-century English pieces. In 1965, he announced that he would give Ightham Mote and its contents to the National Trust. He died in 1985 and his ashes were immured just outside the crypt. The National Trust took possession in that year.

In 1989, the National Trust began an ambitious conservation project that involved dismantling much of the building and recording its construction methods before rebuilding it. During this process, the effects of centuries of ageing, weathering, and the destructive effect of the deathwatch beetle were highlighted. The project ended in 2004 after revealing numerous examples of structural and ornamental features which had been covered up by later additions.

==Architecture and description==

Originally dating to around 1320, the building is important because it has most of its original features; successive owners effected relatively few changes to the main structure, after the completion of the quadrangle with a new chapel in the 16th century. Pevsner described it as &quot;the most complete small medieval manor house in the county&quot;, and it remains an example that shows how such houses would have looked in the Middle Ages. Unlike most courtyard houses of its type which have had a range demolished so that the house looks outward, Nicholas Cooper observes that Ightham Mote wholly surrounds its courtyard and looks inward, into it, offering little information externally. The construction is of &quot;Kentish ragstone and dull red brick,&quot; the buildings of the courtyard having originally been built of timber and subsequently rebuilt in stone.
The house has more than 70 rooms, all arranged around a central courtyard, &quot;the confines circumscribed by the moat.&quot; The house is surrounded on all sides by a square moat, crossed by three bridges. The earliest surviving evidence is for a house of the early 14th century, with the great hall, to which were attached, at the high, or dais end, the chapel, crypt and two solars. The courtyard was completely enclosed by increments on its restricted moated site, and the battlemented tower was constructed in the 15th century. Very little of the 14th century survives on the exterior behind rebuilding and refacing of the 15th and 16th centuries.
The structures include unusual and distinctive elements, such as the porter&#x27;s squint, a narrow slit in the wall designed to enable a gatekeeper to examine a visitor&#x27;s credentials before opening the gate. An open loggia with a fifteenth-century gallery above, connects the main accommodations with the gatehouse range. The courtyard contains a large, 19th century dog kennel. The house contains two chapels; the New Chapel, of c.1520, having a barrel roof decorated with Tudor roses. Parts of the interior were remodelled by Richard Norman Shaw.

== In literature ==
Much of Anya Seton&#x27;s novel &quot;Green Darkness&quot; takes place at Ightham Mote. The novel was inspired by a visit Seton made in 1968. Charles Henry Robinson allowed Seton to access his library and notes for research.

<text>Permission culture is a term often employed by Lawrence Lessig and other copyright activists such as Luis Villa and Nina Paley to describe a society in which copyright restrictions are pervasive and enforced to the extent that any and all uses of copyrighted works need to be explicitly leased. This has both economic and social implications: in such a society, copyright holders could require payment for each use of a work and, perhaps more importantly, permission to make any sort of derivative work.

Lawrence Lessig describes permission culture in contrast with free culture. While permission culture describes a society in which previous creators or those with power must grant people permission to use material, free culture ensures that anyone is able to create without restrictions from the past. An example Lessig cites in his book, &quot;Free Culture&quot;, is photography. In this example, if the legal environment surrounding the early stages of photography had been stricter with what constituted ownership and leaned more towards permission culture, photography would have developed in a drastically different manner and would be limited.

An implication of permission culture is that creators are blocked by systemic procedures and this discourages innovation. Requiring permission in this sense means that creators will have to prove their usage of material is fair, even where legally unnecessary, which is a process that some would decide not to continue.

This term is often contrasted with remix culture.

<doc id="671658" wikidata="Q5342440" url="?curid=671658" title="Edward Craggs-Eliot, 1st Baron Eliot">
<text>Edward Craggs-Eliot, 1st Baron Eliot (London, 8 July 1727 – 17 February 1804, Port Eliot, Cornwall) was an English official and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1748 to 1784, when he was raised to the peerage as Baron Eliot.

==Life and career==
He was born to Richard Eliot (c.1694 – 19 November 1748) and Harriot Craggs (c.1704 – January 1769), the illegitimate daughter of the Privy Counsellor and Secretary of State, James Craggs (9 April 1686 – 2 March 1721) and the noted actress, Hester Santlow. His sister Anne, who married Captain Hugh Bonfoy, was a noted beauty who was painted twice by Sir Joshua Reynolds. Another sister, Elizabeth, married Charles Cocks, 1st Baron Somers.

In 1742, he matriculated at St Mary Hall, Oxford but did not graduate. During 1747–1748, he travelled in Continental Europe, principally the Dutch Republic, Germany and Switzerland. On 19 November 1748, he succeeded his father. From 1748 to 1768 he was Member of Parliament for St Germans, Cornwall, the place of his family estate Port Eliot. In succession, he became Member of Parliament (MP) for Liskeard (1768–1774), for St Germans (1774–1775), and for Cornwall (1775–1784).

In 1751, Edward was appointed Receiver General of the Duchy of Cornwall. From 1760 until 1776, Edward was one of the eight Commissioners of Trade and Plantations, and in 1775 he again became Receiver General of the Duchy. However, in 1776 he notably voted against the employment of Hessian Troops, and resigned from the Board of Trade and Plantations, and from the government.

On 13 January 1784, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Eliot, of St Germans in the County of Cornwall, and took his seat in the House of Lords on 2 February 1784. On 15 Apr 1789, according to the stipulation in his Craggs-estate inheritance, he changed his surname from Eliot to Craggs (on occasion using &quot;Craggs Eliot&quot; instead of Edward Craggs Lord Eliot). At the same time, the Eliot arms were quartered with those of the Craggs family and used by Edward and his sons.

Eliot was an acquaintance of Dr Samuel Johnson and a friend and patron of Sir Joshua Reynolds.

==Family==

On 25 September 1756, he married Catherine Elliston (September 1735 – 23 February 1804), daughter of Captain Edward Elliston and Catherine Gibbon, the aunt of Edward Gibbon, at St James&#x27; Church, Westminster.

Together, they had four children:
#Edward James Eliot (9 August 1757 – September 1757)
#Edward James Eliot (24 August 1758 – 17 September 1797)
#John Eliot, 1st Earl of St Germans (30 September 1761 – 17 November 1823)
#William Eliot, 2nd Earl of St Germans (1 April 1767 – 19 January 1845)

Eliot died at his Port Eliot estate on 17 February 1804, and he was buried at St Germans, Cornwall

<doc id="671660" wikidata="Q2374524" url="?curid=671660" title="Ightham">
<text>Ightham ( ) is a parish and village in Kent, England, located approximately four miles east of Sevenoaks and six miles north of Tonbridge. The parish includes the hamlet of Ivy Hatch.

Ightham is famous for the nearby medieval manor of Ightham Mote (National Trust), although the village itself is of greater antiquity. Ightham is not mentioned in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot;, but place-name evidence implies the name is derived from the Saxon &#x27;Ehtaham&#x27;. &#x27;Ehta&#x27; is a Jutish personal name, while &#x27;ham&#x27; means settlement.

==History==
===Stone Age===
The presence of flint workshops at Oldbury Hill, excavated by Benjamin Harrison in 1905 and at Rose Wood on Ightham Common are evidence of the presence of humans in the Palaeolithic period.
The earliest trackway crossing the parish runs mainly as a ridgeway on top of the North Downs from East Kent to Salisbury Plain.

===Iron Age===
The fortification of Oldbury is dated to the late Iron Age. Oldbury was in the centre of a series of forts running 70 miles from Holmbury in Surrey to the west to Bigberry near Canterbury to the east. Oldbury is the largest of all at 123 acres.

===Roman period===
Benjamin Harrison of Ightham excavated the site of a tile works and possible Roman villa at Patchgrove Wood on the northwest edge of Oldbury Hill, close outside the parish.

===Medieval period===
It is not known how the boundaries of the parish were established. There is no hard evidence for the establishment of a Saxon church, and Ightham was not mentioned in the Domesday Book. The inclusion of the church in the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; 1122-3 may reflect an older church as it may be a copy of an earlier Saxon list. The network of parishes has been relatively stable since Anglo-Saxon times. In North West Kent parishes are single townships and cover 1000-6000 acres. Originally Ightham had 2611 acres. Tithes were paid to a parish priest.

In 1336 Edward II granted a request for permission to hold an annual fair in the village.

===War Years===

During the First World War 50 men of the parish died in the fighting. A war memorial was erected in their honour opposite the George and Dragon and unveiled on 5 December 1920 by Major General Sir William Furse. The Bishop of Rochester unveiled a tablet in their honour in February 1921 in St Peter&#x27;s Church.

With Ightham close to West Malling and Biggie Hill airfields, local people had a good view of the Battle of Britain in 1940, retreating to shelters if the fighting came too close. During the Blitz in 1940-41 Ightham was directly under a route then by German bombers and rocket on their way to attack London. Ightham was hit by 450 high-explosive bombs and 20 flying bombs or rocket. Olgdbury Hatch was badly burnt by incendiary bombs and in September 1940 a bomb hit two houses in Jubilee Crescent and another in Copt Hall.

Although bombs were dropped in the village, the school continued its usual pattern. some of the children were evacuated to the West Country in 1941 but they soon returned. I June 1944 attacks by doodlebugs prompted the evacuation of Ightham children, as well as London evacuees in Ightham and a number of mothers to Devon and to Chard in Somerset. Petrol rationing was introduced early in the war and from January 1940, bacon, butter and sugar. By August 1942 all foods were regulated apart from bread, fish and vegetables. Each person had a ration book with exchangeable coupons. Everyone was encouraged to grow vegetables especially potatoes in their gardens and certain areas were set aside for allotments. Wartime meals included whale meat and rabbit.

==Other==

Ightham was famous for growing Kentish cob nuts. These seem to have been cultivated first by James Usherwood, who lived at Cob Tree Cottage. There was a public house nearby called the Cob Tree Inn, which has now reverted to a private house. There are still a number of cob trees in and around the village, but the work of pruning them and picking the nuts is labour-intensive, and the industry has fallen into decline.the local school has a cobnut as its logo.

Ightham also has its own football team, Ightham FC. Home games are played at the recreation ground adjoining the A25 motorway.
It also has a Scout group 1st Ightam scouts

==Main Manor Houses==

There were three Manor buildings House&#x27;s in the original parish - the St Clere estate, Ightham Court (Court/Ightham Lodge) and Ightham Mote in the far south of the parish, at the northernmost Kent Weald. All three have origins stretching back to at least the late 12th Century.
At the end of the 1400s the parish consisted of the village centre, several hamlets and a large number of dispersed farms.

==St Peter’s Church==
The earliest record of a church in Ightham is in the &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot;, a document commissioned by Earnulf, Bishop of Rochester in 1122/23, which lists the churches paying for blessed chrism oil on Thursday of Holy Week. Ightham was charged nine pence.

The position of St Peter&#x27;s Church on a knoll overlooking the village and with views over the parish is typically Saxon; however there is no trace of the earliest, perhaps wooden church. The fabric of the church is early Norman onwards. There are several fine monuments.
==Place Names==
The name Ightham derived from the name of &quot;Ehte&quot;, possibly a Jute and &quot;ham&quot; or homestead. Many place names in the parish are of Anglo-Saxon or Jutish origin. Places were named as these settlers found them. Oldbury had clearly been fortified so the Jutes called it Eald-byrig from the Anglo-Saxon eald (old) and byrig (fortified place).

==Geography==
The chalk North Downs have a layer of clay-with-flints in many places, including the finger of Ightham parish which reaches the crest of the Downs near Drane Farm. The highest point of the ancient parish in the north was near Drane Farm at over 700 feet above sea level. 
The Vale of Holmesdale runs through the parish south of the Downs. There is a steep drop to about 320 feet in the Vale of Holmesdale south of St Clere. Along the length of the Vale runs a band of Gault, blue-grey clay, a mile wide with some alluvial deposits. This was cultivated by the early settlers.
To the south the land climbs gradually towards the northern part of Oldbury Hill. This hill covers 123 acres and climbs from 400 to over 600 feet then drops and climbs to nearly 650n feet at the edge of the Chart at Beacon or Raspit Hill.In the southern part of the parish are the Chart Hills or Greensand Ridge.Ightham common is at the western end of the eastern end of the eastern part of the hills and was covered with woodland and ferns, often boggy, limiting agricultural use. To the South of the Chart Hills the parish edges into the Wealden forest. The land was more suitable for agriculture than on the chart Hills. The inhabitants of Ightham would have used the forest to fatten their pigs in autumn on acorns.

== Demographics ==

The estimated population of the parish of Ightham in 1660 was 325 and this approximately doubled to 709 by the first national census in 1801.

<doc id="671662" wikidata="Q1852204" url="?curid=671662" title="Tom Mann">
<text>Thomas Mann (15 April 1856 – 13 March 1941), was an English trade unionist and is widely recognised as a leading, pioneering figure for the early labour movement in Britain. Largely self-educated, Mann became a successful organiser and a popular public speaker in the British labour movement.

==Early years==
Mann was born on 15 April 1856, on Grange Road, Longford, Coventry. His birth house was previously maintained by Coventry City Council, but is now privately owned after being sold in 2004. The property still stands today. Mann was the son of a clerk who worked at a colliery. He attended school from the ages of six to nine, then began work doing odd jobs on the colliery farm. A year later he became a trapper, a labour-intensive job that involved clearing blockages from the narrow airways in the mining shafts.

In 1870, the colliery was forced to close and the family moved to Birmingham. Mann soon found work as an engineering apprentice. He attended public meetings addressed by Annie Besant and John Bright, and this began his political awareness. He completed his apprenticeship in 1877 and moved to London, however he was unable to find work as an engineer and took a series of unskilled jobs. 

In 1879, Mann found work in an engineering shop. Here he was introduced to socialism by the foreman, and decided to improve his own education. His reading included the works of William Morris, Henry George, and John Ruskin. In 1881 he joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and took part in his first strike. In 1884, he joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in Battersea. Here he met John Burns and Henry Hyde Champion, who encouraged him to publish a pamphlet calling for the working day to be limited to eight hours. Mann formed an organisation, the Eight Hour League, which successfully pressured the Trades Union Congress to adopt the eight-hour day as a key goal.

==Activist and leader==
After reading &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; in 1886, Mann became a communist. He now believed the main purpose of the labour movement should be to overthrow capitalism, rather than just to ameliorate the condition of workers under it. He moved to Newcastle in 1887 and organised the SDF in the north of England. He managed Keir Hardie&#x27;s electoral campaign in Lanark before returning to London in 1888, where he worked in support of the Bryant and May match factory strike. With Burns and Champion, he began producing a journal, the &quot;Labour Elector&quot;, in 1888.

Along with Burns and Ben Tillett, Mann was one of the leading figures in the London dock strike of 1889. He was responsible for organising relief for the strikers and their families. With the support of other unions and various organisations, the strike was successful. Following the strike, Mann was elected President of the newly formed Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers&#x27; Union, with Tillett as General Secretary. Tillett and Mann wrote a pamphlet called &quot;New Unionism&quot;, which advanced the utopian ideal of a co-operative commonwealth. Mann was also elected to the London Trades and Labour Council and as secretary of the National Reform Union, and was a member of the Royal Commission on Labour from 1891 to 1893. In 1894, he was a founding member of the Independent Labour Party and became the party Secretary in 1894. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the party in the 1895 general election. In 1896 he was beaten in the election for Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He helped create the International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation, and was its first President. He was deported from a number of European countries for organising trade unions.

Mann&#x27;s religious belief was as strong as his politics. He was an Anglican and organised support from Christian organisations like the Salvation Army during a number of strikes. In 1893 there were rumours that he intended to become a church minister. He advocated the co-operative model of economic organisation, but resisted alliance between the ILP and other socialist organisations in Britain, like the Fabians. In 1895, the Fabian Beatrice Webb criticised Mann&#x27;s absolutism and described his goal derogatorily as, &quot;a body of men all professing exactly the same creed and all working in exact uniformity to exactly the same end&quot;. Philip Snowden, a member of the ILP, liked Mann but was critical of his inability to stay with any one party or organisation for more than a few years.

==Australia and Liverpool==
In 1902, Mann emigrated to Australia, to see if that country&#x27;s broader electoral franchise would allow more &quot;drastic modification of capitalism&quot;. Settling in Melbourne, he was active in Australian trade unions and became an organiser for the Australian Labor Party. However, he grew disillusioned with the party, believing it was being corrupted by the nature of government and concerned only with winning elections. He felt that the federal Labor MPs were unable and unwilling to change society, and their prominence within the movement was stifling and over-shadowing organised labour. He resigned from the ALP and founded the Victorian Socialist Party.

Returning to Britain in 1910, Mann wrote &quot;The Way to Win&quot;, a pamphlet that argued that socialism could be achieved only through trade unionism and co-operation, and that parliamentary democracy was inherently corrupt. He founded the Industrial Syndicalist Education League, and worked as an organiser for Ben Tillett. He led the 1911 Liverpool General Transport Strike. In 1912 he was convicted under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 of publishing an article in &quot;The Syndicalist&quot;, as an &quot;Open Letter to British Soldiers&quot;, urging them to refuse to shoot at strikers (later reprinted as a leaflet, &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot&quot;); his prison sentence was quashed after public pressure. He was opposed to Britain&#x27;s involvement in World War I on socialist and religious grounds and addressed pacifist rallies.

On 10 June 1913 he spoke at Wednesbury Market Place in support of strikers in the Great Black Country Trades Dispute, which lasted for two months and threatened government preparations for World War I. Mann returned to the area again on 3 July.

In 1917, he joined the successor to the Social Democratic Federation, the British Socialist Party, which had affiliated to the Labour Party the previous year.

==Veteran campaigner==
In 1919, he again ran for election as Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, this time successfully. He held the post until 1921, when he retired at the age of sixty-five. He welcomed the Russian October Revolution in 1917 and the Communist government, and called for soviets to be formed in the United Kingdom. In 1920, he was one of many members of the British Socialist Party, inspired by the Revolution, who formed the Communist Party of Great Britain. Mann was chairman of the British Bureau of the Red International of Labor Unions and its successor, the National Minority Movement, from their formation in 1921 until 1929.

Tom Mann continued to actively champion socialism, communism, and co-operation, until his death in 1941. He published further pamphlets and regularly addressed public meetings, in Britain and abroad. He was arrested for sedition, on several occasions. He continued to be a popular figure in the labour movement, attracting large audiences to rallies and benefits. Mann advocated animal rights and was supportive of the Humanitarian League.

==Spanish Civil War==
On the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Mann became a member of the Spanish Medical Aid Committee, an organization that had been set-up by the Socialist Medical Association and other progressive groups. During the Spanish Civil War, he wanted to fight on the Republican side, but was by that time far too old. A unit of the International Brigade, the Tom Mann Centuria, was named in his honour.

== Death and legacy ==

Tom Mann died at age 84, on 13 March 1941 in Grassington, Northern Yorkshire. He was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium. A memorial stands in front of the cottage where he died. There is also a memorial on his birthplace in Coventry. As mentioned, in 1936 a unit of the International Brigade was named the Tom Mann Centuria in his honour. The Tom Mann Theatre in Sydney, Australia, was named after him. His great-grandson was Nicholas Bennett, Conservative MP for Pembroke from 1987 to 1992 and a Welsh Office minister from 1990 to 1992.

<doc id="671673" wikidata="Q1478678" url="?curid=671673" title="Anglican Use">
<text>The Anglican Use, also known as Divine Worship, is a use of the Roman Rite celebrated by the personal ordinariates, originally created for former Anglicans who converted to Catholicism while wishing to maintain &quot;aspects of the Anglican patrimony that are of particular value&quot; and includes former Methodist converts to Catholicism who wish to retain aspects of Anglican and Methodist heritage, liturgy, and tradition. Its most common occurrence is within parishes of the personal ordinariates which were erected in 2009. Upon the promulgation of &quot;Divine Worship: The Missal&quot;, the term &quot;Anglican Use&quot; was replaced by &quot;Divine Worship&quot; in the liturgical books and complementary norms, though &quot;Anglican Use&quot; is still used to describe these liturgies as they existed from the papacy of John Paul II to present.

== Definition ==
The Anglican Use was originally &quot;the liturgy of &quot;The Book of Divine Worship&quot; [...] formulated and authorized in response to Pope John Paul II&#x27;s 1980 Pastoral Provision that allowed Episcopalian priests and laity in the United States to join the Catholic church while preserving elements proper to their Anglican tradition.&quot; It gives the name &quot;Ordinariate Use&quot; to the liturgy, since December 2015, of the personal ordinariates for former Anglicans, which is that contained in &quot;Divine Worship: The Missal&quot; and &quot;Divine Worship: Occasional Services&quot;. At a time when a specific liturgy for the personal ordinariates was still under preparation, the Anglican Use community in Indianapolis applied the term &quot;Anglican Use&quot; to the &quot;Book of Divine Worship&quot; liturgy that was then the interim liturgy of the North American personal ordinariate. The Pasadena parish calls the present form &quot;the Ordinariate Form&quot; and adds that it is unofficially but popularly known as the &quot;Anglican Use&quot;. The American &quot;National Catholic Register&quot; has also distinguished between &quot;Anglican Use&quot; and &quot;Ordinariate Use&quot;. Other sources and commentators apply the term &#x27;Anglican Use&#x27; to all the books known by the &#x27;Divine Worship&#x27; appellation.

==History==
===Origins===
In 1977, some of those Anglicans and Episcopalians who desired union with the Catholic Church contacted individual Catholic bishops, the Apostolic Delegate (Archbishop Jean Jadot) and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome, to inquire about the possibility for married Anglican priests to be received into the Catholic Church and function as Catholic priests.

After the United States National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had reacted favorably to the proposals that had been put before them, a formal request for union was presented in Rome on 3 November 1979 for acceptance into the Catholic Church, for steps to be taken to eliminate any defects that might be found in their priestly orders, and that they be granted the oversight, direction, and governance of a Catholic bishop.

===Pastoral Provision===

The decision of the Holy See was officially communicated in a letter of 22 July 1980 from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to the president of the United States episcopal conference, who published it on 20 August 1980. Though admittance of the Episcopalians in question to the Catholic Church was considered as reconciliation of individuals, the pastoral provision gave them a common group identity. After a period of being subject to the local Latin Church bishop, the bishop could set up personal parishes for them, with the use, within the group, of a form of liturgy that retained certain elements of the Anglican liturgy; and married Episcopalian priests could on a case-by-case basis be ordained as Catholic priests, but not as bishops.

In 1983, the first Anglican Use parish, Our Lady of the Atonement, was established in San Antonio, Texas. Our Lady of Walsingham parish in Houston, Texas, followed the next year. 

===Personal ordinariates===

On 9 December 2009, Pope Benedict XVI issued the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Anglicanorum coetibus&quot;, authorizing the establishment of personal ordinariates for former Anglicans. The first to be established was the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham for England and Wales in January 2011, followed by the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter for the United States in January 2012 and the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross for Australia in June 2012. These &quot;Anglican Use ordinariates&quot; were a response to Anglicans outside the United States, and hence beyond the remit of the Pastoral Provision, but they also supplied some of the perceived needs of that previous provision.

Canonical differences between the Anglican Use parishes and the personal ordinariate are outlined in a study published in the 23 January 2012 issue of the &quot;National Catholic Reporter&quot;.

== Anglican Use liturgy ==

===Initial ===
====Book of Divine Worship====
The Congregation for Divine Worship gave provisional approval for the Anglican Use liturgy, the &quot;Book of Divine Worship&quot;, in 1984, an approval rendered definitive in 1987. This book incorporates elements of the 1928 American &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, but the Eucharistic liturgy is from the 1979 prayer book, with the eucharistic prayers taken from the Roman Missal and the ancient Sarum Rite (with the modern English Words of Institution inserted in the latter). New texts were promulgated by the congregation on 22 June 2012, the feast of English saints Thomas More and John Fisher, namely the Order for Funerals and the Order for the Celebration of Holy Matrimony.

The &quot;Book of Divine Worship&quot; was based closely on the United States Episcopal Church liturgy, which had developed in ways different from that of Anglican churches in England and Australia, making it unsuitable for imposing on all personal ordinariates for former Anglicans. Its Order of Mass drew elements also from the original &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, from different later versions of it, from the Tridentine Mass and from the Roman Rite as revised after the Second Vatican Council. The Holy See&#x27;s &#x27;Anglicanae Traditiones Commission&#x27; that developed the updated form of Anglican patrimonial liturgy used the &quot;Book of Divine Worship&quot; as its &quot;lead&quot; source. 

==== Customary ====
As an interim Divine Office, the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham in 2012 adopted the &quot;Customary of Our Lady of Walsingham&quot;. Combining elements from the most common Roman Rite books of hours–the &quot;Liturgia Horarum&quot; and the &quot;Breviarium Romanum&quot;–and both the 1549 and 1662 editions of the Church of England &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, the &quot;Customary&quot; contained the full psalter. It also contained &quot;Terce&quot;, &quot;Sext&quot;, and &quot;None&quot;–hours present in the Roman Rite but not in most Anglican prayer books.

===Current===
==== Divine Worship: the Missal ====
&quot;Divine Worship: The Missal&quot; is the current missal containing the complete expression of the Divine Worship Eucharistic liturgy for use in all three personal ordinariates for former Anglicans that had been established from 2011. It took effect on 29 November 2015. The Mass is a &quot;use&quot; of the Roman Rite requiring the Roman Canon on Sundays, augmented with Anglican features such as wording, the Prayer of Humble Access and the &quot;Comfortable Words&quot;. A number of these extra or optional features have equivalents in the Tridentine use, notably in the propers, the prayers at the foot of the altar, the offertory prayers and the Last Gospel.

In the new liturgical books for the personal ordinariates, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Congregation for Divine Worship retained the generic title &quot;Divine Worship&quot; for the entire liturgical provision for the personal ordinariates, dropping the &quot;Book of&quot; naming convention in favor of &quot;Divine Worship: The Missal&quot;. 

The earlier &quot;Book of Divine Worship&quot; has been phased out and is no longer authorized for use in public worship. The term &quot;Anglican Use&quot; has been replaced by &quot;Divine Worship&quot; in the liturgical books and complementary norms.

==== Divine Worship: Daily Office ====
&quot;Divine Worship: Daily Office&quot; is the Divine Office approved for Anglican Use Ordinariates. There are two editions: The &quot;North American Edition&quot;, printed by Newman House Press and released in late 2020, is used in the Personal Ordinariate of the Chair of Saint Peter in the United States and Canada. The &quot;Commonwealth Edition&quot;, printed by the Catholic Truth Society, is used in the Personal Ordinariates of Our Lady of Walsingham and Our Lady of the Southern Cross in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Oceania.

<text>Hildenborough is a village and rural parish in the borough of Tonbridge and Malling in Kent, England. It is located 2 miles (3.2 km) north-west of Tonbridge and 5 miles (8 km) south-east of Sevenoaks. The village lies in the River Medway valley, near the North Downs, in an area known as The Weald.

==Origin of name==

Hildenborough was originally just Hilden – or, in its 13th-century form, Hyldenn. The elements here are Old English &quot;hyll&quot; &#x27;hill&#x27; and &quot;denn&quot; &#x27;woodland pasture&#x27;, so the sense is of a &#x27;pasture on or by a hill&#x27;. By 1349 the name had become Hildenborough, since Hilden was one of the boroughs of the Lowy of Tunbridge.

== History ==

===World War II ===

At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939 Hildenborough was considered a quiet safe location, and children from London schools were evacuated to the Village School. In October 1939 there were 250 evacuees on the school roll. In the absence of air raids on London during this period of the &quot;phoney war&quot; many of these children returned home. The quiet was not to last.

In July 1940, the Battle of Britain got underway in the skies above Kent and the village became anything but quiet. Hildenborough is only ten miles from RAF Biggin Hill, an important airfield and a Sector headquarters co-ordinating airfields in Kent. Other airfields under Biggin Hill were at Gravesend some fifteen miles away and night fighters were at West Malling ten miles away. There were emergency landing strips in Stocks Green Road, Hildenborough less than a mile from the village centre and at Penshurst Airfield, Charcotte only 3 miles away. Most of the evacuees had left the village before the bombs started to fall. 

On 6 September a Hurricane piloted by Flying Officer Bowring attacked a Junkers Ju 88 Bomber and the pilot of the crippled plane ordered his radio operator to bail out. This was Corporal Heinrich Agel and he landed on the roof of the &quot;Boiling Kettle&quot; tea rooms. He was taken in by the owners and given tea and cakes while they waited for the Police to arrive. The plane went on to crash-land at Tanyard Farm in Hadlow Road, Tonbridge. The crew of five were reunited at Tonbridge Police station before being taken to a POW camp for the duration of the war.

On 11 September a twin-engine Heinkel He 111 bomber was shot down by two Hurricanes and crash-landed on the airstrip behind the Old Barn in Stocks Green Road. The Hurricanes circled to watch as the crew of five walked away from the wreckage and were captured by a group of soldiers. 
27 October, a Sunday, started with a Spitfire Mk 11 (P7539) diving to earth behind the Half Moon pub killing the Pilot John R.Mather. (Investigations of the crash site in the 1972 did not reveal any battle damage. The cause of the crash was probably mechanical failure). Later that same day a Messerschmitt Bf 109 was shot and forced to land on Penshurst airfield, a temporary air-strip near Penshurst. The pilot of the Spitfire was flying officer Peter Chesters.

After this busy spell the village did not suffer from the war until one day in 1942 bombs fell on the &quot;Grenadier Pub&quot; in Riding Lane. There were no injuries; the landlord was safe in his cellar tapping a new barrel.

The village and surrounding area played host to American troops who all left the area in the follow-up from D-Day. The war returned in June 1944 with the first of the flying bombs. On 29 June a flying bomb damaged School House and there are numerous records of the disturbance caused by the flying bombs. The window in the north transept of St John&#x27;s Church was blown out at this time. It became so dangerous in the village that in July children were evacuated in what was now called &quot;Buzz Bomb Alley&quot;. There were other V-1 and V-2 events in the village but these are not well documented as many of these fell in fields.

==Transport==

Hildenborough stood on the first road in Kent to be turnpiked in 1710: the highway from Sevenoaks through Tonbridge to Tunbridge Wells; carrying much traffic &quot;en route&quot; to &quot;the Wells&quot;. A number of inns sprang up to service this traffic, including the Hilden Manor and the Half Moon.

Today the village, along with Tonbridge and Sevenoaks, is by-passed by the modern A21 road.

The railway was late coming to Hildenborough: the South Eastern Railway did not open its direct line from London until 1 May 1868. The six-mile (ten-kilometre) gradient up to Sevenoaks takes its name from the village. The railway station was situated close to the existing houses at the time, which is now about one mile (one and a half kilometres) from the village centre. There are regular direct routes to London Bridge, London Waterloo East and London Charing Cross, taking approximately 30–45 minutes. In the opposite direction, direct trains go to Tonbridge, Tunbridge Wells and Hastings.

==Religion==

By the 1840s, the Parish of Tonbridge was approximately long and wide. A circular letter dated 26 September 1842 explained that, &quot;as the Parish was so large, a great many people were unable to attend the church [in nearby Tonbridge].&quot; It was proposed that, &quot;a new church should be built for the people living in the Hildenborough district.&quot; 
Dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, the church was consecrated on 9 July 1844.

In 1992 a &quot;church plant&quot; was established by St John&#x27;s at Stocks Green School, to serve the southern part of the village, initially meeting monthly until 1994 when weekly services started. The congregation moved back to the Church Centre (hall) at St John&#x27;s in 2008.

Hildenborough Gospel Hall, located in Mount Pleasant, was established some time around 1850.

The Soka Gakkai International and SGI-UK– a Buddhist group, meet in the Village Hall.

==Modern Hildenborough==

Sackville School, a private educational establishment, now occupies Foxbush House, built in 1866 for Charles Fitch Kemp, a London chartered accountant, who had an &quot;ambition to be a country landowner&quot;. The house was subsequently sold twice before the Second World War, when it was occupied by the military. It was used by various educational establishments from 1949; Sackville School was established in 1987 and its grounds are a Registered Historic Park.

Another private school, Fosse Bank, occupies a Grade II listed Victorian building known as Mountains Country House. The building and estate are also used as a wedding and event venue.

Commerce in the village is primarily based on small businesses. Fidelity Investments has been a major local employer, with its UK headquarters based in Hildenborough, however in 2017 the company announced that the site would be closing in 2020. GlaxoSmithKline was formerly a significant local employer, with a research factory at the Old Powder Mills, until the site was closed in 2010. Hildenborough is very much a commuter village with its good transport links with London. 

One of the village&#x27;s oldest buildings, the Hilden Manor restaurant owned by Whitbread, was burnt down by a fire caused by an electrical fault, and has now been restored and rebuilt by Oaklands. It was officially re-opened in 2006 with a Premier Inn hotel newly built next to it. 

The village&#x27;s GP practice can be traced back to 1879. The Hildenborough and Tonbridge Medical Group now has a large, purpose-built medical centre in Westwood which also houses a dispensary. The practice has over 16000 patients, with branch surgeries in the villages of Leigh and Weald, as well as the Trenchwood Medical Centre in north Tonbridge.

The Raphael Medical Centre in Coldharbour Lane offers Speech Therapy, Art &amp; Music Therapy to help patients regain mental and physical abilities lost through serious illness or accidents.

In 2014 Dame Kelly Holmes opened Cafe 1809 on the main road through Hildenborough. In 2018 she closed the cafe and reopened it as The 1809 Hub space for community events. 

Hildenborough has a weekly farmers&#x27; market which is held every Tuesday morning from 8:30am - 11am at the Hildenborough Village Hall in Riding Lane. The farmers&#x27; market opened in 2008 and as of 2024 hosts around 20 stalls each week.

== Education ==

There is one private primary school, Fosse Bank, one private secondary, Sackville, and two state primaries, Stocks Green school and Hildenborough CEP school. Hildenborough primary was the first school in the village, and is over 150 years old.

== Road Safety==

In 2015, after various anti speeding campaigns and to reduce fatalities and casualties in the village, the speed limit of the B245 Tonbridge Road and from Foxbush to the Hilden Manor&#x27; was reduced from 40 to 30mph. It was an historic moment as the speed limit had not been changed for 85 years The speed limit on parts of Stocks Green Road was reduced from 60mph to 40. There were also traffic calming alterations along Leigh Road by Stocks Green School. 

Hildenborough Community Speedwatch, part of Kent Community Speedwatch, started by road safety activists in 2016 after concern for speeding in the village. Volunteers run regular speed checks in the village and in particular speeding hotspots. Their purpose is to educate motorists not to enforce. 

Kent Police operate various road safety checks every so often in the village. In 2021, 21 motorists received speeding tickets. A Wanted male was caught by Foxbush.

==Activities==

There are several activities for children and teenagers, including those run by Hildenborough Church, and a Scout troop (8th Tonbridge). 
There are two football teams associated with Hildenborough Athletic FC, the reserves play in the local Sevenoaks &amp; District League and the first team playing football in the Kent County Division One league as of 2011–2012 season. 

Riding Farm Equestrian Centre on Riding Lane offers horse riding lessons, livery facilities and school holiday activities.

Action Medical Research have a regular charity cycling event, the &#x27;Castle 100&#x27; every year that runs through Riding Lane and Shipbourne http://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure-and-culture/explore-kent/cycling/Tonbridge-Castle-charity-ride.htm
On the first bank holiday Monday in May the Hildenborough Sports Association organises the Hildenborough Road Races Hildenborough Road Races. 2015 marks the 30th time the races have taken place.

Campaigners called for Hildenborough to have an outdoor gym in the Recreation Ground to encourage inexpensive exercise for adults including older and disabled people. It was opened by Dame Kelly Holmes on 31 October 2016. It was supported by local residents in a survey and funded by a Tesco grant and some local businesses and the Kent Police Property Fund. Extra equipment for the children&#x27;s playground was also funded including the zip wire that local children from the Cubs asked for. 

==Notable residents==

Hildenborough is the family home of Olympic double-gold medallist Dame Kelly Holmes. Other famous residents included the late Sir Henry Cooper.

Henry (real name Hyla) Stallard MBE (1901–73) lived in Mill Lane, he was an athlete in the 1924 Paris Olympics and represented Great Britain in the 800 and 1500m. He hurt his foot in one of the races but he picked himself up and carried on running. An actor played him in film Chariots of Fire. He became a pioneering eye surgeon at St Barts Hospital and Moorfields. He later moved with his wife Gywnneth to Forest Row in Sussex but used to spend Christmas in Hildenborough with his relatives.

World War I Victoria Cross recipient, William Allison White (1894–1974) has a memorial headstone in Hildenborough churchyard.

Andy Titterrell, England and British Lions rugby player lived in Hildenborough.

<text>Legal lexicography is the complex of activities concerned with the development of theories and principles for the design, compilation, use, and evaluation of dictionaries within the field of law, see e.g. Nielsen 1994.

== Overview ==

As a branch of the general discipline lexicography, legal lexicography may be divided into theoretical legal lexicography and practical legal lexicography. The result of practical legal lexicography is called a law dictionary. Law dictionaries are available in print and online.

Legal lexicography is not just about terms, but also about language and usage. Especially when making bilingual law dictionaries, the lexicographers need to take a broad view of what legal lexicography involves. Most users of bilingual law dictionaries need information about language and law, and the lexicographer&#x27;s task is to present the information as clearly and structured as possible. This involves various lexicographic analyses: user research, dictionary typology, and a clear structure for presenting and linking the information in the dictionary. The information must be presented in such a way that the user is not burdened with heavy lexicographic information costs.

As pointed out in Nielsen 1994, law dictionaries can serve different functions. The traditional law dictionary with definitions of legal terms serves to help users understand the legal texts they read (a communicative function) or to help users acquire knowledge about legal matters independent of any text ( a cognitive function) – such law dictionaries are usually monolingual. Bilingual law dictionaries may serve several functions. First, they may have entry words in one language and definitions in another language – these dictionaries give help to understand legal texts, usually written in a foreign language, and to acquire knowledge, usually about a foreign legal system. Second, bilingual law dictionaries with entry words in one language and equivalents in another language provide help to translate legal texts, into or from a foreign language, and sometimes also to produce legal texts, usually in a foreign language.

The aim of legal lexicography is to suggest principles and strategies that lead to good law dictionaries. A good monolingual law dictionary will contain relevant terms with appropriate definitions, and if the purpose of the dictionary is to facilitate legal translation, e.g. a bilingual law dictionary, it will contain definitions, translation equivalents and other relevant information such as collocation and phrases in the source language and in the target language, as described in Nielsen 1994.

==Important aspects==
Based on the discussion in Nielsen 1994, there are a number of aspects that lexicographers should take into account when working with legal lexicography. One of the important aspects of legal lexicography is to establish a profile of the intended dictionary users. This is particularly significant if the dictionary is to be used by other than &quot;native&quot; lawyers, for instance bilingual law dictionaries for translation. A user profile should focus on the following competencies: The users&#x27; legal competence in their &quot;native&quot; field of law; the users&#x27; legal competence in the foreign field of law; the users&#x27; legal-language competence in their native language; the users&#x27; legal-language competence in the foreign language. When lexicographers have thus profiled the intended user group they have a clear picture of what types of data to include in the dictionary so that it can be of the most help to the users. The profile will also help lexicographers presenting the necessary data, such as definitions, in the appropriate language so that, in particular, &quot;foreign&quot; users can benefit from the data. The typical example is where a European continental lawyer consults an English law dictionary.

Another important aspect is the scope of coverage of a dictionary. This refers to the extent to which a law dictionary covers the field of law. The basic distinction is between general-field dictionaries and sub-field dictionaries. A general-field dictionary of law is one whose purpose is to cover the entire field of law as represented by all its subfields, and a sub-field dictionary of law is one whose purpose is to cover one or few distinct sub-fields of law, for instance a dictionary of contract law and a dictionary of family law. It is obvious that more data about the law and legal language can be included in a sub-field dictionary than in a general-field dictionary of law of the same size. The result is that sub-field dictionaries can give a much more detailed description of the law and its language than other types of dictionary.

<doc id="671679" wikidata="Q214818" url="?curid=671679" title="Mýrdalsjökull">
<text>Mýrdalsjökull (pronounced , Icelandic for &quot;(the) mire dale glacier&quot; or &quot;(the) mire valley glacier&quot;) is an ice cap on the top of the Katla volcano in the south of Iceland. It is to the north of the town of Vík í Mýrdal and to the east of the smaller ice cap Eyjafjallajökull. Between these two glaciers is the Fimmvörðuháls pass.

The glacier contributes to the most serious natural hazard area of Iceland.

== Setting ==
The icecap of the glacier covers an active volcano. The caldera of Katla has a diameter of and the volcano erupts usually every 40–80 years. The last eruption took place in 1918. Scientists are actively monitoring the volcano, particularly after the eruption of nearby Eyjafjallajökull began in April 2010. There is a further historic relationship with Eyjafjallajökull as the two glaciers were continuous as a single ice cap at the end of the 19th century and only separated into the larger Mýrdalsjökull and smaller Eyjafjallajökull in the middle of the twentieth century. Since the year 930, 16 eruptions have been documented and in the last 8400 years about 300 explosive basalt eruptions are known to have originated from Katla. 

While Katla mountain is in diameter at its base, more relevant to the present ice cover is its diameter closer to at elevation. The lowest pass out of the caldera is at . This caldera is between deep and is surrounded by a rim of high mountains. Ice cauldrons are found within the caldera. The glacier&#x27;s recent peak ice cover has reached in height and in the year 1980 it covered an area of approximately . In 2016 the covered area of Mýrdalsjökull was believed to be . The area was in 2019. The volume of ice is about . 

The Eldgjá, a volcanic eruption fissure about long, which erupted in the year 939, is part of the same volcanic system.

Before the Hringvegur (the main ring road round the island) was built, people feared traversing the plains in front of the volcano because of the frequent jökulhlaups (glacial floods) and the deep rivers to be crossed, although the road is still vulnerable to major events. Especially dangerous was the glacial flood after the eruption of 1918 when the coastline was extended by by laharic flood deposits.

Mýrdalsjökull is an exceedingly high precipitation location, with models suggesting parts of it receive more than 10 metres of rainfall equivalent annually.

== Glaciation History ==
The last glacial period came to an end 11,500 years ago and was followed by the Holocene. Mýrdalsjökull is likely to have been present throughout the Holocene and definitely the last 8400 years as there is no evidence of degassed erupted tephra from Katla. Jökulhlaup&#x27;s 8000 to 6000 years ago took a path over the highest pass in the caldera wall which does not support a crater lake source but would happen with an ice cap.

Until the development of remote satellite imaging it was impossible to monitor to annual accuracy the mass balance of Mýrdalsjökull. Such techniques allowed it to be determined for Mýrdalsjökull that it is the summer temperatures that are the predominant driving factor in the recent recession of the glacier. However past proxy means of measurement such as outlet length of the Sólheimajökull outlet glacier were also consistent with this. Any such studies related to climate change have to be qualified as past volcanic processes have resulted in the loss of up to 5% of the ice cap on more than one occasion.

== Jökulhlaups ==
There is complexity with assigning the outlet glacier catchments, but from the point of view of hazard assessment related to the glaciers this is simplified considerably, as the hazard risk of jökulhlaups relates to water drainage sectors based upon the ice caps surface topography rather than ice flow. Such an approach creates three drainage sectors which do not reflect intracaldera bedrock topography or many of the outlet glaciers. 

The biggest Mýrdalsjökull jökulhlaups, as in the 1775 eruption, are massive floods by any standard with maximum discharges of the order of several ten to a hundred times other recent jökulhlaup&#x27;s in Iceland. Most recent jökulhlaup (17 out of the 20 since the year 874) have descended to the east through Kotlujökull onto the Mýrdalssandur plain with about two large floods a century (i.e. presently overdue). This Ko sector has about within the caldera rim but underlies about of the ice cap itself. However due to location factors of the original melt water, the Katla 934 and 1860 jökulhlaups also descended through Sólheimajökull to the Sólheimasandu flood plain. This So sector has about of its water drainage catchment within the caldera rim and a total ice cap catchment of . There have been 5 jökulhlaups since 874. It is perhaps not so significant from a hazard point of view as the water drainage catchment within the caldera rim northwest through Entujökull where a large jökulhlaup occurred in 874. This En sector with total ice cap catchment of about , has rare but very large jökulhlaups every 500 to 800 years down the fairly well populated and developed Markarfljótsaurar flood plain.

Jökulhlaup triggering can be complex (there are at least seven potential causes), and at Mýrdalsjökull results from geothermal processes, ice dams and their sudden removal by floating as well as eruptions which can be primary or secondary to the removal of overpressure. Björnsson originally described 12 geothermal ice cauldrons and three eruption sites since 1755 associated with Mýrdalsjökull. Later work clarified that these newly formed and could become inactive. Further work mapped at least 17 ice cauldrons, all associated with the caldera of Katla and three areas of increased seismic activity, that have been postulated to be likely jökulhlaup sources, being Austmannsbunga in the north-east of the caldera and the 1755 and 1823/1918 eruption sites to the west and south as noted by Björnsson. There are regular surveys now, with by 2019 twenty mapped ice cauldrons. Smaller and more frequent jökulhlaups tend to be associated with the geothermal ice caldron process. There is a warning system which uses in the case of geothermal events the increased conductivity of the river waters and can detect seismic flood tremor. 

The most likely next very disruptive volcanogenic jökulhlaup will almost certainly flow from Kotlujökull, over Mýrdalssandur to the sea. This has been assigned a 89% probability within 30 years, affecting possibly the town of Vík, likely associated with eruption of of tephra (so disruptive to air travel) and likely occurring in the months June to September. There is a lower probability of an Entujökull jökulhlaup of the same size which is expected to have far graver environmental, social and geomorphological consequences affecting the town of Hvolsvöllur and surrounds.

<text>Eyjafjallajökull (; &quot;glacier of (the mountain) Eyjafjöll&quot;), sometimes referred to by the numeronym E15, is one of the smaller ice caps of Iceland, north of Skógar and west of Mýrdalsjökull. The ice cap covers the caldera of a volcano with a summit elevation of . The volcano has erupted relatively frequently since the Last Glacial Period, most recently in 2010, when, although relatively small for a volcanic eruption, it caused enormous disruption to air travel across northern and western Europe for a week.

==Geography==
Eyjafjallajökull consists of a volcano completely covered by an ice cap. The retreating ice cap covered an area of in 2019, but was previously more than , with many outlet glaciers. The main outlet glaciers are to the north: Gígjökull, flowing into Lónið, and Steinsholtsjökull, flowing into Steinsholtslón. In 1967, there was a massive landslide on the Steinsholtsjökull glacial tongue. On 16 January 1967 at 13:47:55 there was an explosion on the glacier. It can be timed because the seismometers at Kirkjubæjarklaustur monitored the movement. When about of material hit the glacier a massive amount of air, ice, and water began to move out from under the glacier into the lagoon at the foot of the glacier.

The mountain itself, a stratovolcano, stands at its highest point, and has a crater in diameter, open to the north. The crater rim has three main peaks (clockwise from the north-east): Guðnasteinn (), ; Hámundur (), ; and Goðasteinn (), . The south face of the mountain was once part of Iceland&#x27;s coastline, from which, over thousands of years, the sea has retreated some . The former coastline now consists of sheer cliffs with many waterfalls, of which the best known is Skógafoss. In strong winds, the water of the smaller falls can even be blown up the mountain. The area between the mountain and the present coast is a relatively flat strand, wide.

==Etymology==

The name means &quot;glacier of Eyjafjöll&quot; (or more properly here &quot;ice cap&quot;). is the name of the southern side of the volcanic massif together with the small mountains which form the foot of the volcano. The word , meaning glacier or ice cap, is a cognate with the Middle English word surviving in the &quot;-icle&quot; of English &quot;&quot;.

The name is made up of the words (genitive plural of , meaning &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;), and the plural word , meaning &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;, and together literally means: &quot;the mountains of the islands&quot;. The name probably refers to the close by archipelago of Vestmannaeyjar.

The word is the genitive plural of , and so is the genitive form of and means: &quot;of the Eyjafjöll&quot;.
A literal part-by-part translation of would thus be &quot;Islands&#x27; Mountains&#x27; glacier&quot;.

Hence the southern slopes of the mountain Eyjafjöll result in the sea side strip of land beyond being called &quot;Undir Eyjafjöllum&quot;.

== Geology ==
The stratovolcano, whose vents follow an east–west trend, is composed of basalt to andesite lavas. Most of its historical eruptions have been explosive. However, fissure vents occur on both (mainly the west) sides of the volcano. The volcano is 800,000 years old.

The volcano is fed by a magma chamber under the mountain, which in turn derives from the tectonic divergence of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. It is part of a chain of volcanoes stretching across Iceland. Its nearest active neighbours are Katla, to the northeast, and Eldfell, on Heimaey, to the southwest.
The volcano is thought to be related to Katla geologically, in that eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull have generally been followed by eruptions of Katla.
Eyjafjallajökull erupted in the years 920, 1612, 1821, and 2010. The Skerin Ridge eruption in 920 was a VEI 3 radial fissure eruption while the subsequent 1612 and 1821 eruptions were VEI 2 small summit eruptions. In the case of the 1821 eruption, a short explosive phase in December 1821 was followed by a year of intermittent explosive to effusive activity.

===1821 to 1823 eruptions===
Some damage was caused by a minor eruption in 1821. Notably, the ash released from the eruption contained a large fraction of fluoride, which in high doses may damage the bone structure of cattle, horses, sheep and humans. The eruption also caused some small and medium glacier runs (jökulhlaups) and flooding in nearby rivers Markarfljót and Holtsá . The eruptive phase started on 19 and 20 December 1821 by a series of explosive eruptions and continued over the next several days. The sources describe heavy ash fall in the area around the volcano, especially to the south and west.

After that event the sequence of eruptions continued on a more subdued level until June 1822.

From the end of June until the beginning of August 1822, another sequence of explosive eruptions followed. The eruption columns were shot to considerable heights, with ashfall in both the far north of the country, in Eyjafjörður, and in the southwest, on the peninsula of Seltjarnarnes near Reykjavík.

The period from August to December 1822 seemed quieter, but farmers attributed the death of cattle and sheep in the Eyjafjörður area to poisoning from this eruption, which modern analysis identifies as fluoride poisoning. Some small glacier runs occurred in the river Holtsá. A bigger one flooded the plains near the river Markarfljót. (The sources do not indicate the exact date.).

In 1823, some men went hiking up on Eyjafjallajökull to inspect the craters. They discovered a fissure vent near the summit caldera a bit to the west of &quot;Guðnasteinn&quot;.

In early 1823, the nearby volcano Katla under the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap erupted and at the same time steam columns were seen on the summit of Eyjafjallajökull.

The ash of Eyjafjallajökull&#x27;s 1821 eruptions is to be found all over the south of Iceland. It is dark grey in colour, small-grained and dacitic intermediate rock containing about 28–40% silicon dioxide.

===2010 eruptions===

On 26 February 2010, unusual seismic activity along with rapid expansion of the Earth&#x27;s crust was registered by the Icelandic Meteorological Office. This gave geophysicists evidence that magma was pouring from underneath the crust into the magma chamber of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano and that pressure stemming from the process caused the huge crustal displacement at Þorvaldseyri farm. In March 2010, almost three thousand small earthquakes were detected near the volcano, all having a depth of . The seismic activity continued to increase and from 3–5 March, over a thousand earthquakes were measured at the epicenter of the volcano.

The eruption begun on 20 March 2010, about east of the top crater of the volcano, on Fimmvörðuháls, the high neck between Eyjafjallajökull and the neighbouring icecap, Mýrdalsjökull. This first eruption, in the form of a 300-meter-long radial fissure vent, did not occur under the glacier and was smaller in scale than had been expected by some geologists. The eruption consisted of 15 lava fountains reaching heights of up to 185 meters. The fissure opened on the north side of Fimmvörðuháls, directly across the popular hiking trail between Skógar, south of the pass, and Þórsmörk, immediately to the north.

On 14 April 2010 Eyjafjallajökull resumed erupting after a brief pause, this time from the top crater in the centre of the glacier, causing &quot;jökulhlaup&quot; (meltwater floods) to rush down the nearby rivers, and requiring 800 people to be evacuated. This eruption was explosive, due to meltwater getting into the volcanic vent. It was estimated to be ten to twenty times larger than the previous one in Fimmvörðuháls. Pulsating explosive activity on 17 April 2010 was later understood to be due to periodic clogging/plugging of the conduit associated with the rise and degassing of more magma. This second eruption threw volcanic ash several kilometres up in the atmosphere, which led to air travel disruption in northwest Europe for six days from 15 to 21 April 2010. This disruption affected over 20 countries and as many as 10 million air travelers. The volcano erupted again in May 2010, causing the closure of airspace over many parts of Europe. The eruptions also created electrical storms. The London Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre declared the eruption to have stopped on the 23rd of May 2010, but stated that they were continuing to monitor the volcano. As a direct result of this disruption being viewed by some as excessive, new standards for the closure of airspace as a result of air contamination by dust/ash were agreed internationally. The volcano continued to have several earthquakes daily, with volcanologists watching the volcano closely. As of August 2010, Eyjafjallajökull was considered dormant. Infrasound sensors have been installed around Eyjafjallajökull to monitor for future eruptions.

In total, the 2010 eruptions generated about 0.27 cubic km (270,000,000 cubic metres) of tephra, causing ash fallout over central southern Iceland and parts of continental Europe. Nearby areas saw an ash layer of up to several centimeters, and surrounding glaciers saw a significant albedo reduction due to the ash.
===Relationship to Katla===
Eyjafjallajökull lies west of another subglacial volcano, Katla, under the Mýrdalsjökull ice cap, which is much more active and known for its powerful subglacial eruptions and its large magma chamber. Each of the eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull in 920, 1612, and 1821–1823 has preceded an eruption of Katla. Katla did not display any unusual activity (such as expansion of the crust or seismic activity) during the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull, though geologists have been concerned about the general instability of Katla since 1999. Some geophysicists in Iceland believe that the Eyjafjallajökull eruption may trigger an eruption of Katla, which would cause major flooding due to melting of glacial ice and send up massive plumes of ash. On 20 April 2010, Icelandic President Ólafur Grímsson said &quot;the time for Katla to erupt is coming close...we [Iceland] have prepared...it is high time for European governments and airline authorities all over the world to start planning for the eventual Katla eruption&quot;.

Volcanologists continue to monitor Katla, aware that any eruption from Katla following an eruption from Eyjafjallajökull has historically occurred within months of an Eyjafjallajökull eruption. The Icelandic Meteorological Office updates its website with reports of quakes at both Eyjafjallajökull and Katla. On 8 July 2011 there was a jökulhlaup that destroyed a bridge on the Ring Road and caused cracks to appear on Katla&#x27;s glacier.

==Postage stamp ==

Icelandic Post issued three special stamps in 2010 for the eruption of the Eyjafjallajökull volcano. All stamps contain real volcanic ash which fell on 17 April 2010.

== Popular culture ==
The volcano was featured in the 2013 movie The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, where Walter had to flee from an eruption after pursuing photographer Sean O&#x27;Connell to Iceland.

Eyjafjallajökull was used in Season 5 Episode 6 of Madam Secretary which aired on 11 November 2018. It was used as the basis of the airport being closed in Ireland trapping Secretary of State Elizabeth McCord and her delegation and the Turkish foreign minister and his delegation.

It is mentioned in the JJ DOOM song, &quot;Guv&#x27;nor&quot;.

Valencian singer-songwriter Pau Alabajos released a song called &quot;Eyjafjallajökull&quot; on his 2011 album &quot;Una Amable, una Trista, una Petita Pàtria,&quot; drawing imagery from the travel disruptions following the 2010 eruption.

Emo band The World Is a Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid to Die released a song on their 2010 EP &quot;Formlessness&quot; called &quot;Eyjafjallajokull Dance.&quot;

An Operator in the mobile game &quot;Arknights&quot; is named after it.

In the season 1 episode 8 of Sense8, Will wants to see &quot;the volcano no one can pronounce the name of&quot;, and Riley responds with it.

If the corresponding DLC is owned, the volcano is a possible natural wonder that can spawn in Sid Meier&#x27;s Civilization VI. On Steam, the game has a related achievement that references the ensuing aviation shutdown due to the 2010 eruptions.

<text>Jia Dao () (779–843), courtesy name Langxian (), was a Chinese Buddhist monk and poet active during the Tang dynasty.

== Biography ==
Jia Dao was born near modern Beijing; after a period as a Buddhist monk, he went to Chang&#x27;an. He became one of Han Yu&#x27;s disciples, but failed the &quot;jinshi&quot; exam several times. He wrote both discursive &quot;gushi&quot; and lyric &quot;jintishi&quot;. His works were criticised as &quot;thin&quot; by Su Shi, and some other commentators have considered them limited and artificial.

According to Dr. James J.Y. Liu (1926–1986), a professor of Chinese and comparative literature, Jia&#x27;s poem &quot;The Swordsman&quot; () &quot;seems...to sum up the spirit of knight errantry in four lines.&quot; &quot;The Swordsman&quot; reads in Liu&#x27;s translation as follows:

A metric translation of the original Chinese poem with one iamb per Chinese character reads as follows:

The original Chinese:

劍客:
十年磨一劍,
霜刃未曾試.
今日把示君,
誰有不平事.

The opening line of &quot;The Swordsman&quot; is often used as a proverb to refer to a long and arduous undertaking.

<text>Bristol Grammar School (BGS) is a 4–18 mixed, private day school in Bristol, England. It was founded in 1532 by Royal Charter for the teaching of &#x27;good manners and literature&#x27;, endowed by wealthy Bristol merchants Robert Thorne and his brother Nicholas. Robert Thorne made much of his fortune in Seville, where he employed slaves in his soap factory. 

The school flourished in the early 20th century under headmaster Sir Cyril Norwood (1906–1916), embodying &quot;the ideals and experiences of a leading public school&quot;. Norwood went on to serve as the master at Marlborough College and Harrow, and as president of St John&#x27;s College, Oxford.

The headmaster, Jaideep Barot MA MSc, is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference (HMC) and was appointed in September 2018. The school was first cited in the &quot;Public Schools Year Book&quot; in 1907, and former headmaster John Mackay (1960–1975) served as the chairman of the HMC in 1970. Founded as an all-boys school, Bristol Grammar is now fully co-educational having first admitted girls in 1980. The school counts among its alumni prominent personalities including Nobel laureate Sir John Pople, former British ambassador to the US Lord Oliver Franks, and founder of Penguin Books Sir Allen Lane. It has educated members of both houses of the UK Parliament and has a strong legal tradition, having educated three present Lord Justices of Appeal (Sirs Rabinder Singh, Mark Warby and Timothy Holroyde).

The school is divided into four sections: the Infant School (ages 4–6), the Junior School (ages 6–11), the Senior School (ages 11–16) and Sixth Form (ages 16–18). The Junior School was ranked in 2016 by &quot;The Good Schools Guide&quot; as one of the best value prep schools in the UK. The Senior School and Sixth Form rank academically amongst the best performing independent schools in South West England.

==History==

The school was founded on 17 March 1532 by merchant brothers Robert and Nicholas Thorne. Robert lived primarily in Seville where he owned enslaved African people. The school at the time was based in the St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, as part of the new founding of schools after Henry VIII&#x27;s closure of the monasteries, where previously a large proportion of England&#x27;s education had occurred. The school motto &quot;Ex Spinis Uvas&quot;, which translates as &quot;Grapes From Thorns&quot;, is a play upon the names of the school founders Robert and Nicholas Thorne.

The Grammar Scole at Frome Gate was in the care of its first schoolmaster, Thomas Moffat, when good fortune stepped in to secure its future. The Thorne family were wealthy Bristol merchants, friends of men like John Cabot and known to royalty. They wished to endow a school where the sons of Bristol merchants and tradesmen could receive an education. On 17 March 1532, Henry VIII issued a Charter under which the Thornes could endow the Grammar School and establish it in larger premises at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital near the bottom of Christmas Steps. There the boys learnt Latin and Greek, Divinity and some Hebrew.

By 1767, the buildings were cramped. Charles Lee, the Master, persuaded the Corporation that the Grammar School should be allowed to exchange premises with the other City School, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital, which had a pleasant, new site on Unity Street, further up the hill. This exchange was carried out, and Charles Lee proceeded to enjoy his new school by greatly reducing the numbers of boys. The School was set to rights in 1812, but education was moving away from the classics and this caused further problems resulting in the school being closed in 1844. It received a new scheme in 1847 and re-opened in January 1848 with 300 pupils.
By 1870 the headmaster (Rev John William Caldicott) told the Endowed Schools Commission that the school was &quot;full to overflowing&quot; with 240 boys. However, it was significantly less well endowed than Bristol&#x27;s other secondary schools (Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s, Red Maids&#x27; and Colston&#x27;s), and its now dilapidated buildings were located in the wrong area of the city for pupils who mostly lived in Clifton and Redland. At that time, Bristol had substantial hospital endowments (second only to London and Edinburgh) but these were mostly spent on charity rather than education. The assistant charity commissioner proposed a scheme that would reorganise the objectives of the endowed schools and secure funding for the Grammar School and the new Clifton High School for Girls. After several years of debate and negotiation the initiative was approved in 1875, and in 1877 a new location in Tyndalls Park was agreed.

The first buildings in Tyndalls Park were occupied in 1879: the Big School, with its Great Hall, and the Headmaster&#x27;s House, a modest dwelling which is now the Junior School. Further classrooms were added, a Gymnasium and a Fives Court and a Rifle Range. These have been rebuilt as art rooms and rehearsal rooms, but the Winterstoke wing still houses the laboratories which were added in 1914. The Preparatory School began in 1900, and in 1928 moved into its own building on Elton Road, but this was destroyed on the night of 24 November 1940 by incendiary bombs.

The Prep Hall, which survived, is now the Mackay Theatre. The Elton Road ruin was rebuilt as classrooms under John Garrett, who added the University Road block and began to colonise the other side of Elton Road. Since then, the school has built yet more classroom accommodation and a new sports hall; Modern Languages, Classics, Geography and Art have their own Elton Road Houses, and the former playing field is now the Design and Technology Centre.

The school became a direct grant grammar school in 1946 as a result of the Education Act 1944 and chose to become independent in 1979 when direct grants were abolished by the 1974–9 Labour Government.

In 1980 the school became fully coeducational, having admitted girls to the Sixth Form for the previous two years.

===Houses===
There are six Houses in the Senior School, each named after its Head of House. Each student is placed in one of the six House groups at the beginning of their time in the Senior School, remaining in the House until they leave school. House activities include plays, music competitions and inter-House sporting tournaments.

The House names and colours are:
*Scott&#x27;s (black)
*Parratt&#x27;s (yellow)
*Edwards&#x27;s (blue)
*Glenn&#x27;s (red)
*Short&#x27;s (brown)
*Bramley&#x27;s (green)

Between 1894 and 1939 the school also had a boarding house, Thorne Lodge, situated on Oakfield Grove in Clifton. The boarding house masters were J. G. Holmes (1894-1911), F. G. Beauchamp (1911-28) and R. J. McGregor (1929-39).

====Colours====
House colours are awarded, given at the end of the term should that person perform well in an activity or sport.

School colours are awarded to pupils typically in their final year, who perform exceptionally well in sport or any other school activity. They would be expected to compete in a school team (such as Cricket, Rugby, Hockey or Football) and show continued commitment. This was extended to include performing arts, awarding several students colours for their contribution to concerts, plays and taking House assemblies.

==Tutors and teaching==
The size of teaching groups ranges from 25 students per teacher in lower years to occasionally one per teacher (for less popular subjects in the sixth form). Optional subjects include Russian and Economics. All students have access to computers with internet access as well as their own iPads provided by the school.

The school offers Ancient Greek as a subject from Year 9 onwards, and Classical Civilisation is also available now as a GCSE.

===Sport===
During the autumn term, the sport curriculum is dominated by rugby for the boys and hockey for the girls. During the spring term, it is dominated by hockey, football, and rugby for the boys and netball for the girls.

During the summer term, there is a division between cricket for the boys and for the girls. Both sexes may participate in sports such as tennis and athletics.

The school owns a large area of land in Failand which features two AstroTurf hockey pitches, tarmac tennis/netball courts, five cricket pitches, nine rugby pitches, two football pitches and a 3G astro pitch. There is an athletics track as well as shot and javelin areas. Full-time grounds staff are employed. Sport is compulsory one afternoon a week for every year-group up to, and including, year 11. A new pavilion has been built as part of the 475th anniversary expansion of the school, replacing the old pavilion. There is now a larger car park and better coach access. The new pavilion provides facilities for up to 350 pupils and staff at a time with improved showering and changing facilities as well as an attractive hospitality area for spectators. The total cost of the project was £2.4 million.

This is in addition to the sports hall on the Tyndall&#x27;s Park campus, which supplements the one afternoon a week pupils spend doing sport with around another hour or so a week of PE within the school day.

The school rugby team won the U15 1991 Daily Mail Cup and came runner-up in the same competition in 1995. Bristol Grammar has a sporting rivalry with fellow Bristol public school Clifton College.

===Model United Nations===
Bristol Grammar has been successful at Model United Nations for a number of years now, holding their own conference BGSMUN, in February, since 2007. These conferences, presided over by the school&#x27;s own Secretaries General, include chairing teams of BGS Sixth Form students. Various schools are invited to compete, with Exeter College winning the 2015 conference.
The school&#x27;s own team has been particularly successful in recent years, winning Best Delegation at both Exeter College MUN and MUNCH.

==Campus==
Bristol Grammar School occupies a triangle of land between the University of Bristol on the University Road side, what used to be Dingle&#x27;s department store on the lower side and a series of houses on the Elton Road side known as Tyndalls Park. The school has been expanding, and while it has always owned all the houses to one side of the main campus until recently only four (Barton&#x27;s, Norwood&#x27;s, Martin&#x27;s and Garrett&#x27;s) were occupied. Most of the houses have now had their leases relinquished and have been converted into teaching space.

===Great Hall===
The foundation stone was laid on 10 June 1877 and the school moved in during 1879. It is the largest first floor hall in the United Kingdom. In 1996, the old servery was removed and the hall was restored to its old layout; the roof was also renewed during this time. There is a full kitchen between the Great Hall and the Science Wing, as well as two classrooms and an office belonging to the history department. Underneath the Great Hall is the Staff Room, the Pople Room, and the school offices. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade II listed building.

To one side of the Great Hall, sitting separate from the Hall itself and the Junior School, is another building designed to blend in. During the 1940s/1950s, this was the woodworking department, and later a staff work room. It is now a Music room which is also used for House Assemblies.

The Great Hall foundation stone has never been found. Inside the foundation stone there is a time capsule, reported to contain &quot;Copies of The Times and of the Bristol newspapers and a parchment document containing an account of the ceremony&quot;. However, despite extensive searches of the outer walls, it has not been found. Two possibilities exist - that the foundation stone was placed at the far end of the building where the Science wing now is, and was destroyed or covered up when that building was erected; or that the stone is buried under tarmac towards the front of the building. The foundation stone was laid on 10 June 1877.
The Big School was designed in the late Perpendicular Gothic style, by the Bristol firm of Foster and Wood. Sometimes known as the Long Room, but now usually as the Great Hall, it was designed as a teaching room, and the Masters&#x27; stalls are still in place.

The room is long, wide and high. Downstairs there are now, as in 1879, the Headmaster&#x27;s Study, the Senior Common Room, offices and classrooms. Originally these would have accommodated the Sixth Form, while the rest of the school had lessons together in the Hall.

The organ, which was built by Vowles &amp; Son of St James&#x27; Square, was presented by William Wills, 1st Baron Winterstoke, in January 1880. It cost over £1,000 and it is still played for assemblies and concerts. Nowadays, the organ would cost at least £2 million.

The main stairs leading out of the Great Hall have been modified to fulfil fire and safety regulations and in preparation for the new library and Sixth Form building known as The Hub. When the whole school assembled in the Great Hall for the official opening of the new staircase, the invited guests included people who donated large sums of money to help get the project on its way and some of the OBs, including John Pople, who have supported the school. This work was permitted due to work done by the school&#x27;s archivist who demonstrated that this was the way that the original staircase was likely to have been. This satisfied the authorities sufficiently that they granted permission to make structural alterations to the Grade II listed building. The Hub project however, was cancelled by the, then, new Headmaster, Roderick MacKinnon, so the planned building, which was popular among students, was discarded. This was mainly due to financing issues as building the hub would be very expensive (at least £1 million).

The staircase was originally one big staircase which started at ground level, led up and split into two smaller ones which doubled back to reach the Great Hall. This has now been reversed; two smaller staircases lead up and merge into a larger one which doubles back to reach the Great Hall. This meant that the wall between the two smaller staircases could be knocked through to insert a modern automated double glass door allowing pupils to reach the Great Hall with greater ease from within the campus. The old entrance with the great wooden doors at the front still remains. Previously a small door to the campus side of the building was for visitors, teachers and Prefects only.

The School has re-purposed the Elton Road block, and changed the Mackay Theatre into a mixed use space for the music school. Most of the teaching rooms in this block are now used for this purpose. The block has been extended with a new 245 seat (standard layout) theatre, and additional rehearsal/teaching space, and is named the 1532 Performing Arts Centre. This centre fits between the Elton Road Block and the Princess Anne Block. This is one of the biggest building jobs on the main campus since 1994 when the Design &amp; Technology Centre was built in the centre of the site.

==School song==
Carmen Bristoliense (Song of the Bristolians) is the school song of Bristol Grammar School, which is sung in Latin. The song was written in 1909 by Headmaster Cyril Norwood, and set to music by the Director of Music, C. W. Stear. It is sung in the final school assembly each term, and at other school or related events such as the annual prize giving ceremony and old boys&#x27; (and girls&#x27;) dinners. The song consists of four verses and a chorus, although usually only the first verse and chorus are sung. The fifth line was updated from Norwood&#x27;s original on the 400th anniversary of the school&#x27;s founding.

==Headmasters==

Until the 19th century, the Headmaster was known simply as the &quot;Master&quot; and his assistants as &quot;Ushers&quot;. Little is known of those of the 16th century and nothing of any before Thomas Moffat, the &quot;scolemaster&quot; of the City Audit Book of 1532 who took the School to the Bartholomews. The first few dates are conjectural.

<text>A language-for-specific-purposes dictionary (LSP dictionary) is a reference work which defines the specialised vocabulary used by experts within a particular field, for example, architecture. The discipline that deals with these dictionaries is specialised lexicography. Medical dictionaries are well-known examples of the type.

==Users==
As described in Bergenholtz/Tarp 1995, LSP dictionaries are often made for users who are already specialists with a subject field (experts), but may also be made for semi-experts and laypeople. In contrast to LSP dictionaries, LGP (language for general purposes) dictionaries are made to be used by an average user. LSP dictionaries may have one or more functions. LSP dictionaries may have communicative functions, such as helping users to understand, translate and produce texts. Dictionaries may also have cognitive functions such as helping users to develop knowledge in general or about a specific topic, such as the birthday of a famous person and the inflectional paradigm of a specific verb.

==Different types==
According to Sandro Nielsen, LSP dictionaries may cover one language (monolingual) or two languages (bilingual), and occasionally more (multilingual). An LSP dictionary that attempts to cover as much of the vocabulary in a subject field as possible is classified by Nielsen as a maximizing dictionary, and one that attempts to cover a limited number of terms within a subject field is a minimizing dictionary.

Also, Nielsen 1994 distinguishes between the following types of dictionaries: An LSP dictionary that covers more than one subject field is called a multi-field dictionary, an LSP dictionary that covers one subject field (e.g. a dictionary of law) is called a single-field dictionary, and an LSP dictionary that covers part of a subject field (e.g. a dictionary of contract law) is called a sub-field dictionary.

=== Usage dictionaries ===

A common form of LSP dictionary is a usage dictionary for a particular field or genre, such as journalism, providing advice on words and phrases to prefer, and distinctions between easily confused usages. Probably the best known of these for news style writing is the &quot;AP Stylebook&quot;. Many such works also have elements of a style guide, though most of the latter are not in dictionary format, but arranged as a series of rules in sections, and more concerned with grammar and punctuation. Some usage dictionaries are intended for a general rather than specialized audience, and are therefore more comprehensive; two major ones are &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; and &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot;.

<text>Stephen Frank Altschul (born February 28, 1957) is an American mathematician who has designed algorithms that are used in the field of bioinformatics (the Karlin–Altschul algorithm and its successors). Altschul is the co-author of the BLAST algorithm used for sequence analysis of proteins and nucleotides.

==Education==
Altschul graduated summa cum laude from Harvard University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in mathematics and has a Ph.D. in the same field from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

==Research==
His research interest centers around sequence-alignment algorithms, statistics of sequence comparison, and measurement of sequence similarity.

==Background==
He is the son of Stephanie Rosemary (née Wagner) and Arthur Altschul, a former partner at Goldman Sachs. In 1994, he married Caroline Kershaw James, the daughter of Caroline James-Pritz of Cincinnati and Harry Keithan James of Dayton, Ohio. The Rev. Luther D. Miller Jr. performed the ceremony at St. David&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Washington.

His half-sister is journalist Serena Altschul, who is known for her tenure at MTV. On his father&#x27;s side, he is a member of the Lehman family.

He has two sons, James and William Altschul. William Altschul is a former college Ultimate player at Washington University in St. Louis.

==From mathematics to bioinformatics==
During his undergraduate years, Altschul developed an interest in biology. As a result, he started reading books about DNA. One of the books that he read was &quot;The Double Helix&quot; by Watson. Furthermore, he had also taken a course on Evolutionary Biology. Altschul had also spent two summers working in laboratories at Rockfeller University where he helped to write computer codes for an X-ray crystallography project.

Due to his interest, Altschul had considered trying to apply to graduate school in biology. He instead decided to apply to programs in applied mathematics, with the hope of finding some applications of mathematics to biology to work on.

==Notable appointments/positions held==
Upon graduation, Stephen Frank Altschul worked in the Mathematics Research Branch of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases as an IRTA postdoctoral fellowship. From 1990 to present, he has worked in the NCBI Computational Biology Branch, holding the position of senior investigator.

<text>Stephen John Hepworth, better known by his stage name Steve Zodiac is a guitarist and songwriter, who gained recognition in the early 1980s as frontman of new wave of British heavy metal band Vardis.

Born in Streethouse, Yorkshire, Zodiac rose to prominence after he formed Vardis in 1973, alongside bassist Tony Boulton and drummer Phil Medley
He is credited as writer of heavy metal songs &quot;If I Were King&quot;, &quot;Lets Go&quot;, and &quot;100mph&quot;; and had a Fender Telecaster. He also experimented with bagpipes on the track &quot;Police Patrol&quot; from the 1982 album &quot;Quo Vardis&quot;, worked with Jools Holland (Squeeze), Andy Bown (Status Quo &amp; Pink Floyd), Ron Asprey, Terry Horbury (Dirty Tricks) and Judd Lander. Steve is thought to have taken his last name from either Sylvia and Gerry Anderson&#x27;s astronaut in 1960s television show &quot;Fireball XL5&quot;, or his Selmer Zodiac 100-watt amplifier, which had to be used at full volume to get the distortion and sustain which was fundamental to his sound.

Zodiac&#x27;s work contributed greatly to modern heavy metal and inspired many heavy metal bands of today. He is directly quoted by giants like Metallica as a heavy influence. He prematurely quit Vardis in the mid-1980s (which resulted in outcry amongst rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll fans across Britain), due to mounting tensions between himself and several people within the music industry.

<doc id="671710" wikidata="Q5245467" url="?curid=671710" title="Dead ball">
<text>Dead ball is a term in many ball sports in which the ball is deemed temporarily not playable, and no movement may be made with it. Depending on the sport, this event may be quite routine, or more uncommon.

== Basketball ==
In basketball, most or any time play is stopped the ball is considered dead, such as when a foul has been committed and called by a referee, a foul shot has been attempted and another one is yet to be attempted, or the ball has gone out of bounds. Player substitutions may then be made.
Section IV of the NBA rule book contains the official definition of a dead ball.

== Bat and ball sports ==

=== Baseball ===
In baseball, when the ball is dead, no runners may advance beyond the respective bases they are entitled to, and no runners may be put out. The ball becomes dead when:
* A batter is touched by a pitch or a batted ball (&quot;hit by pitch&quot;)
* The plate umpire hinders a catcher&#x27;s throw attempt and the throw does not directly retire a runner
* A ball is illegally batted, such as when a batter hits the ball while outside of the batter&#x27;s box
* A foul ball is not caught
* A fair ball touches a runner or an umpire on fair territory before it touches an infielder (including the pitcher)
* A fair ball touches a runner or an umpire before it has passed an infielder other than the pitcher
* A live ball lodges in the umpire&#x27;s or catcher&#x27;s equipment or in a fence or in another object on the field
* Any legal pitch touches a runner trying to score
* A live ball passes out of the playing field (unless it hits or crosses over a base on the ground)
* A runner or spectator commits interference
* The defense leaves the field after the half inning or game ends
* The venue&#x27;s ground rules call for a dead ball ruling for a ball striking an above-ground obstruction (usually involving the roof of a domed or retractable-roofed stadium), such as the Tampa Bay Rays&#x27; Tropicana Field, regarding the catwalks and overhanging speakers above the field. In the past, overhead dead ball ground rules also existed for the Kingdome in Seattle and Minneapolis&#x27;s Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome
* An umpire calls time. Umpires typically call &quot;time&quot; after being asked to do so by a participant. An umpire in chief (plate umpire) will also call &quot;time&quot; when:
** Weather, darkness or similar conditions make play impossible or dangerous
** Light failure makes it difficult or impossible for the umpires to follow the play
** An accident incapacitates a player or an umpire
** The umpire wishes to examine the ball, to consult with either manager, or for any similar cause.
** An umpire orders a player or any other person removed from the playing field.
** A balk or obstruction is committed and immediate ensuing play ends
** The catcher interferes with the batter before the time of pitch
** An umpire declares &quot;no pitch&quot; after debris or a flying object (such as a bird) collides with the pitched ball.

In general, the ball does not automatically become dead after playing action ends. So, for example, although the recording of a third out generally winds down a half inning, the ball is not automatically dead. If it is to the advantage of the defense to attempt to record a fourth out for any reason, the ball is live and such a play is permitted.

After a dead ball, the ball becomes alive again when the pitcher stands on the pitcher&#x27;s plate ready to pitch, the batter, catcher and umpire are ready, and the umpire calls or signals &quot;Play.&quot;

Players and coaches may ask an umpire for &quot;time&quot;, but they themselves may not call &quot;time&quot; and cause the ball to become dead. Nevertheless, &quot;time&quot; is usually granted by the umpire when asked, and thus, colloquially, it is often said that players or coaches indeed can &quot;call time&quot;. Unlike sports which have clocks to time the play, the phrase &quot;time out&quot; is not used in baseball. Likewise, there is no limit to the number of times a team can &quot;call time&quot;.

In baseball, the term &quot;dead ball&quot; is also used in the context of the dead-ball era, a phase during the early history of the game in the early 1900s. In this context, the ball was not actually &quot;dead&quot; but for various reasons tended to be difficult to hit for distance, resulting in low scores and few home runs by modern standards.

=== Cricket ===
The term &quot;dead ball&quot; has been a fundamental part of cricket&#x27;s laws for centuries, though its formal introduction came in 1798. Before that, the concept existed implicitly in various [governing] the game. The 1798 law explicitly introduced &quot;dead ball&quot; when it imposed a penalty of five runs if a fielder stopped the ball with his hat. This rule reinforced fair play and prevented unfair advantages. Over time, the dead ball rule evolved to cover various stoppages in play, maintaining the integrity of the game.

&quot;The words &#x27;dead ball&#x27; were first used in the laws in 1798&quot;, in relation to a new law imposing a penalty of five runs if the fielder stopped the ball with his hat. &quot;Before 1798 the words &#x27;dead ball&#x27; were not used but the meaning was implicit in some of the other laws of the day.&quot;

The ball, referring to the cricket ball, becomes &quot;live&quot; when the bowler begins their run up in preparation to bowl at the batter. In the live state, play occurs with the batters able to score runs and get out.

The ball becomes dead when any of the following situations occur:
* The umpire is satisfied that, with adequate reason, the batter is not ready for the delivery of the ball.
* The ball is finally settled in the hands of the wicket-keeper or of the bowler and that this determination is at the sole discretion of the umpire.
* A boundary is scored
* A batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing the dismissal.
* A ball, whether played or not, becomes trapped between the bat and person of a batter or between items of his/her clothing or equipment or the clothing of an umpire.
* The ball lodges in a protective helmet worn by a fielder.
* The umpire intervenes in the occurrence of injury or unfair play.
* Additionally, Law 20.1.2 states that &quot;The ball shall be considered to be dead when it is clear to the bowler&#x27;s end umpire that the fielding side and both batters at the wicket have ceased to regard it as in play&quot;.

Umpires may also call dead ball at their discretion, in the case of a series for events for which there is no provision in either the Laws of Cricket or agreements made prior to the match. This happened on 9 October 2005, when Australian batter Michael Hussey hit the retracted roof at the Telstra Dome. What would have been six in an open stadium was ruled a dead ball, and no runs were awarded.

Note that the ball becomes dead as soon as a batter is out, so it is not possible to dismiss the other batter immediately. Thus the baseball concept of a double play cannot occur in cricket.

If necessary to make it clear to the players and scorers that the umpire considers the ball to be dead, the umpire signals &quot;dead ball&quot; by crossing and uncrossing his arms in front of his body.

== Football codes ==

=== Association football ===
In association football (soccer), the term &quot;dead ball&quot; refers to a situation when the ball is not in play, e.g. when play has not been restarted after the ball has gone out of bounds or a foul has been committed. It also applies before each kick-off, either at the start of each half or after a goal has been scored. In a dead ball situation, players can position the ball with their hands prior to restarting play. Furthermore, even though the ball is not in play, the referee may still issue cautions or ejections (yellow or red cards) for any incident that occurs off the ball. Fouls, on the other hand, can occur only while the ball is in play.

=== Gridiron football ===
In gridiron football, a dead ball is a condition that occurs between plays. Due to rule differences between leagues, the specific conditions which trigger a dead ball vary slightly, however &quot;in general&quot; a dead ball typically occurs after any of the following events:
* The player with the ball runs out of bounds.
* The player with the ball is declared down, either by being tackled, kneeling, or sliding.
* Forward progress of the player with the ball is stopped by the defense.
* A forward pass touches the ground or travels out of bounds without being caught (also known as an incomplete pass).
* The ball is fumbled and goes out of bounds.
* A kick travels out of bounds or hits the goal post or crossbar in flight.
* A punt or kickoff enters the endzone without being touched (known as a touchback).
* A punt or kickoff is fair caught by the receiving team. 
* A punt is downed by the kicking team before being touched by the receiving team.
* The helmet comes off of the player with the ball for any reason.
* Any scoring play (touchdown, field goal, or safety) occurs. In Canadian football this also includes the single.
* An official otherwise whistles the ball dead, even if inadvertently.

Depending on the league, there may be additional situations which trigger a dead ball. For example, in the CFL, the ball becomes dead if it makes contact with an official, while under NCAA rules, it does not.

During the time in which the ball is dead, the offensive team may not attempt to advance it. The ball remains dead until it is snapped to begin the next play. The clock may or may not be stopped during this time, depending on the specific conditions triggering the dead ball.

Various rule changes over time have altered when a ball may become dead. For example, in the NFL, the ball used to become dead if it came into the possession of the defense for any reason during a try after a touchdown. This rule was changed before the 2015 season, allowing the ball to remain live so that the defense could attempt to return it for a defensive two-point conversion.

=== Rugby league ===
Each end of a rugby league field has a dead ball line; when the ball (or player in possession) crosses or touches this line, the ball is said to have gone dead. This results in a goal line drop out if the defending team had caused the ball to go dead; otherwise, a 20-metre restart ensues.

== Pickleball ==
A dead ball is declared in the game of pickleball when any of the following occur; one of the players commits a fault, the ball hits a permanent object, or a hinder is declared. When a player commits a fault, the other side wins the point. If the ball strikes a permanent object, such as the net post, a referee, or fence, the ball is declared dead, but the point is awarded based on whether or not the ball bounced on the opposing side before hitting the permanent object. If the ball does not bounce on the opposing side&#x27;s court before hitting the permanent object, the opposing side wins the point. If the ball bounces on the opposing side&#x27;s court prior to hitting the permanent object, the side that last hit the ball wins the point. If a hindrance results in a dead ball, such as when a person, errant ball or other object enters the court, the serve is restarted with no penalty to either side.

<doc id="671711" wikidata="Q5761258" url="?curid=671711" title="Hilbert–Smith conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, the Hilbert–Smith conjecture is concerned with the transformation groups of manifolds; and in particular with the limitations on topological groups &quot;G&quot; that can act effectively (faithfully) on a (topological) manifold &quot;M&quot;. Restricting to groups &quot;G&quot; which are locally compact and have a continuous, faithful group action on &quot;M&quot;, the conjecture states that &quot;G&quot; must be a Lie group.

Because of known structural results on &quot;G&quot;, it is enough to deal with the case where &quot;G&quot; is the additive group formula_1 of p-adic integers, for some prime number &quot;p&quot;. An equivalent form of the conjecture is that formula_1 has no faithful group action on a topological manifold.

The naming of the conjecture is for David Hilbert, and the American topologist Paul A. Smith. It is considered by some to be a better formulation of Hilbert&#x27;s fifth problem, than the characterisation in the category of topological groups of the Lie groups often cited as a solution.

In 1997, Dušan Repovš and Evgenij Ščepin proved the Hilbert–Smith conjecture for groups acting by Lipschitz maps on a Riemannian manifold using covering, fractal, and cohomological dimension theory.

In 1999, Gaven Martin extended their dimension-theoretic argument to quasiconformal actions on a Riemannian manifold and gave applications concerning unique analytic continuation for Beltrami systems.

In 2013, John Pardon proved the three-dimensional case of the Hilbert–Smith conjecture.

<text>The Treaties of Stockholm were two treaties signed in 1719 and 1720 that ended the war between Sweden and an alliance of Hanover and Prussia.

Aspects of the conflict that remained unresolved would be dealt with by two further treaties, the Treaty of Frederiksborg between Sweden and Denmark-Norway in 1720 and the Treaty of Nystad between Sweden and Russia in 1721.

Frederick I began negotiating the Treaties of Stockholm following the death of Charles XII of Sweden in 1718. The death of the Swedish monarch heralded the impending conclusion of the Great Northern War.

==Treaty with Hanover==
In the treaty with Hanover on 9 November 1719, Sweden ceded the dominion of Bremen-Verden.

==Treaty with Prussia==
On 21 January 1720, Sweden ceded Swedish Pomerania south of the river Peene and east of the river Peenestrom to Prussia, including the islands of Usedom and Wollin, and the towns of Stettin, Damm and Gollnow. The treaty was formalized in 1720, and became effective when Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia issued a patent declaring the ceded area to be part of Prussia on 29 May 1720. The parts of Swedish Pomerania that were to remain with Sweden were then under Danish occupation, and were restored to Sweden in the Treaty of Frederiksborg on 3 July 1720.

<text>Carly Brook Schroeder (born October 18, 1990) is an American actress and U.S. Army officer. She is best known for playing Serena Baldwin, the daughter of Scotty Baldwin and Lucy Coe in the &quot;General Hospital&quot; spin-off &quot;Port Charles&quot;. She also had a recurring role on the Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. In 2007, she played the lead in &quot;Gracie&quot;, a film inspired by a real-life tragedy during the childhood of sibling actors Elisabeth and Andrew Shue.

In February 2019, Schroeder announced that she would be joining the United States Army. She attended Officer Candidate School, graduating with a commission as a Second Lieutenant on September 20, 2019. She is currently an Infantry Officer with the rank of Captain.

==Life and career==

Schroeder was born in Valparaiso, Indiana. Carly&#x27;s younger brother, Hunter Schroeder, is a former actor; he appeared with her in &quot;Gracie&quot; and &quot;Eye of the Dolphin&quot; prior to his current career in the U.S. Marine Corps. Her parents Paul and Kelli currently reside in Ventura County, California. In 1993, while accompanying a cousin to an acting audition, the casting director asked if the cute three-year-old would consider working for them. Initially, her mother was hesitant about the question, but things such as money for a college education began to appeal to her. After her first job as a child print model, she began doing print work in Chicago for Sears, Roebuck and Company, Kmart, Spiegel, Lands&#x27; End, Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s and many other print advertisers. Two years later in 1995, child director Bob Ebel asked her to do a few television commercials. One of her first commercials was for Birthday Party Barbie in 1998.

In 1997, American Broadcasting Company (ABC) hired Schroeder to play Serena Baldwin on &quot;Port Charles&quot;. She was twice nominated for a Young Artist Award for her work on the show; once in 1999 and again in 2000, as well as a Young Star Award nomination in 1999 for Best Performance by a Young Actress in a Daytime TV Program. Schroeder then appeared as Melina Bianco in The Disney Channel&#x27;s &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot;. Originally booked as a one-time appearance, she shot twelve episodes of the show and also appeared in &quot;The Lizzie McGuire Movie&quot; in 2003, in the same role.

In 2003, Schroeder auditioned for her first feature film and won the role of Millie in the thriller &quot;Mean Creek&quot;. The movie won wide acclaim for Schroeder and the rest of the cast, winning the Humanitas Prize at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, and also being awarded the 2005 Independent Spirit Festival Special Distinction Award for best ensemble cast.

&quot;Gracie&quot; was Shroeder&#x27;s next film role, in 2006. In order to win the role, she began an intense three-month work-out that included a daily regimen of not only physical fitness, but also of training in advanced soccer skills with professional athletes and trainers.
While &quot;Gracie&quot; was in theaters, Schroeder&#x27;s other movie, &quot;Eye of the Dolphin&quot;, was receiving attention, winning two awards from the 2007 International Family Film Festival: a Best Child Actor win for Schroeder, and a Drama Feature win for the movie. The movie has been well received and continues to receive honors, including being named as an Official Selection for the Tribeca Film Festival, Delray Beach Film Festival, Kids First! Film Festival, Tiburon Film Festival, USA Family Film Festival and the Worldfest Houston Film festival. At the 2007 Kids First Awards in October, Schroeder received the award for Best Emerging Actress, while the film received the Best Feature Award (ages 12–18).
Her other movies are &quot;Forget Me Not&quot; (2009), and &quot;Slightly Single in L.A.&quot;, which completed filming in 2009 and was released in 2012. She was also featured in &quot;Creepers&quot; (2011) and &quot;Prep School&quot; (2015).

Schroeder graduated from Thousand Oaks High School in June 2009, and graduated from California Lutheran University in 2014 with a double major in communications and psychology, and a minor in theater.

In early July 2017, it was announced that Schroeder would return as Serena Baldwin to &quot;General Hospital&quot; to honor the late Peter Hansen, who had died in April 2017, who had portrayed her grandfather, Lee Baldwin.

<doc id="671727" wikidata="Q61666718" url="?curid=671727" title="Oast house">
<text>An oast, oast house (or oasthouse) or hop kiln is a building designed for kilning (drying) hops as part of the brewing process. Oast houses can be found in most hop-growing (and former hop-growing) areas, and are often good examples of agricultural vernacular architecture. Many redundant oast houses have been converted into houses. The names &quot;oast&quot; and &quot;oast house&quot; are used interchangeably in Kent and Sussex, but in Surrey, Hampshire, Herefordshire and Worcestershire they are called &quot;hop kilns&quot;.

An oast house consists of a rectangular one- or two-storey building (the &quot;stowage&quot;) and one or more kilns in which the hops were spread out to be dried by hot air rising from a wood or charcoal fire below. The drying floors were thin and perforated to permit the heat to pass through and escape through a cowl in the roof which turned with the wind. The freshly picked hops from the fields were raked in to dry and then raked out to cool before being bagged up and sent to the brewery. The Kentish dialect word &quot;kell&quot; was sometimes used for kilns (&quot;The oast has three kells&quot;) and sometimes to mean the oast itself (&quot;Take this lunchbox to your father, he&#x27;s working in the kell&quot;). The word &quot;oast&quot; itself also means &quot;kiln&quot;.

The earliest surviving oast house is at Golford, Cranbrook near Tunbridge Wells. It dates from some time in the 17th century and closely mirrors the first documentary evidence on oasts soon after the introduction of hops into England in the mid-16th century. Early oast houses were simply adapted barns, but by the 18th century the distinctive tall buildings with conical roofs had been developed to increase the draught. At first, these were square, but around 1800 roundel kilns were developed in the belief that they were more efficient. Square kilns remained more popular in Herefordshire and Worcestershire and came back into fashion in the southeast in the later 19th century. In the 1930s, the cowls were replaced by louvred openings as electric fans and diesel oil ovens were employed.

Nowadays hops are dried industrially and the many oast houses on farms have now been converted into dwellings. One of the best-preserved oast house complexes is at the Hop Farm Country Park at Beltring.

==Hop drying==
The purpose of an oast is to dry hops. This is achieved by the use of a flow of heated air through the kiln, rather than a firing process.

Hops were picked in the hop gardens by gangs of pickers, who worked on a piece work basis and earned a fixed rate per bushel. The &quot;green hops&quot; were put into large hessian sacks called &quot;pokes&quot; (in Kent) or green sacks (West Midlands). These would be taken to the oast and brought into the stowage at first floor level. Some oasts had a man-powered hoist for this purpose, consisting of a pulley of some diameter on an axle to which a rope or chain was attached.

The green hops when freshly picked had a moisture content of approximately 80%. This needed to be reduced to 6%, although the moisture content would subsequently rise to 10% during storage.

The green hops were spread out in the kilns. The floors were generally of square battens nailed at right angles across the joists, placed so that there was a similar gap between each batten, and covered with a horsehair cloth. The hops would be spread some deep, the kiln doors closed and the furnace lit. When the hops were judged to be dried, the furnace would be extinguished and the hops removed from the kiln using a &quot;scuppet&quot;, which was a large wooden framed shovel with a hessian base. The hops would be spread out on the stowage floor to cool, and would then be pressed into large jute sacks called &quot;pockets&quot; with a &quot;hop press&quot;. Each pocket contained the produce of about of green hops. It weighed a hundredweight and a quarter () and was marked with the grower&#x27;s details, this being required under &quot;The Hop (Prevention of Fraud) Act, 1866&quot;.

The pockets were then sent to market, where the brewers would buy them and use the dried hops in the beer-making process to add flavour and act as a preservative.

Oasts sometimes caught fire, the damage sometimes being confined to the kilns (Castle Farm, Hadlow), or sometimes leading to the complete destruction of the oast (Stilstead Farm, East Peckham in September 1983, and Parsonage Farm, Bekesbourne in August 1996).

==Early oasts==

The earliest description of an oast dates from 1574. It was a small building of by in plan, with walls high. The central furnace was some long, high and internal width. The upper floor was the drying floor, and only some above the ground floor, hops being laid directly on the slatted floor rather than being laid on hessian cloth as was the later practice.

===Conversions to oasts===

In many cases, early oasts were adapted from barns or cottages. In 1779, St. Peter&#x27;s Chapel, Frindsbury was converted to an oast. A chapel at Horton, near Canterbury was also converted. Part of Hastings Priory was serving as an oast in 1823. The gatehouse to the Bishop&#x27;s Palace, Bosbury, Herefordshire was also converted.

This was done by building a kiln within the building, dividing it into three, the upper floor being used to receive the &quot;green&quot; hops, dry them and press the dried hops. Examples of this type of conversion can be seen at Catt&#x27;s place, Paddock Wood, and Great Dixter, Northiam.

Later conversions of barns and cottages would be by either building an integral kiln within one end of the building, as seen at Biddenden, Kent, or by adding kilns externally to the existing building, as seen at Barnhill Farm, Hunton, and also at Sutton Valence, or both, as seen at Ightham Mote.

===Purpose-built (custom) oasts===

An agreement for the building of an oast in Flimwell in East Sussex in 1667 gave the size of the building as and another to be built there was to be built in 1671 being or , having two kilns. The earliest surviving purpose-built oast is at Golford, Cranbrook, built in 1750. This small timber framed oast is in plan, and has a hipped tiled roof. It has one kiln, and a single cowl on the ridge of the roof.

==Traditional oasts==

In the early 19th century, the traditional oast as we now know it started to be built. A two- or three-storey stowage, with between one and eight circular kilns. Kiln sizes generally ranged from to diameter, with a conical roof. Towards the end of the 19th century, square kilns were constructed. These generally ranged in size from to square. An oast at Hawkhurst was built with two octagonal kilns, across the flats.

==Modern oasts==

In the 20th century, oasts reverted to the original form with internal kilns and cowls in the ridge of the roof (Bell 5, Beltring). These oasts were much larger and constructed of modern materials. Oasts were built as late as 1948 (Upper Fowle Hall, Paddock Wood), or 1950 (Hook Green, Lamberhurst).

Very modern oasts bear little resemblance to traditional oasts. These vast buildings can process hops from several farms, as at Norton near Teynham in Kent, built in 1982.

==Construction==

===South East===

Oasts were built of various materials, including bricks, timber, ragstone, and sandstone. Cladding could be timber weatherboards, corrugated iron or asbestos sheet.

;Stowage
Many oasts were timber-framed buildings, although some were built entirely in brick, or ragstone if this was available locally. Some oasts were entirely brick except the front and floors, which were timber.

;Kilns
Internal kilns were built of timber or bricks. External kilns were built from bricks, ragstone and bricks, flint, or sandstone. A rare material usage was at Tilden Farm, Headcorn where the kiln was built from Bethersden Marble. During the Second World War, a few kilns were built with a basic timber framing and clad in corrugated iron (Crittenden Farm, Matfield).

;Kiln roofs
Kiln roofs, where the kiln was external, were generally built of a timber frame and covered in either peg tiles or slate. Some oasts had conical kiln roofs built of brick, these were covered in tar or pitch to keep them weatherproof. A few oasts had square kilns with brick roofs, again covered in tar or pitch. The top of the roof was open, and carried a cowl or louvred vent.

===West Midlands===

Oasts were generally built of bricks or local stone.

;Stowage
Bricks were the usual material for building the stowage, wood only being used in floors. Stone was sometimes used too (Madley). Some oasts had a cider mill on the ground floor of the stowage (Little Cowarne Court, Little Cowarne).

;Kilns

Bricks were the usual material for building kilns. Stone was also used.

;Kiln roofs
Kiln roofs could be of timber, clad in tiles or slate, or bricks. Brick kiln roofs could be tarred (Little Cowarne Court, Bromyard) or left bare (The Farm, Brockhampton). The roofs would be topped with a cowl (Upper Lyde Farm, Pipe-cum-Lyde), or a ridge ventilator (Kidley, Acton Beauchamp).

==Locations==

Oasts can be found in the UK and abroad.

===South East England===
Oasts are generally associated with Kent, and the oasthouse is a symbol associated with the county. They are also found in Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire.

===West Midlands===

In the West Midlands, the main hop-growing areas are Worcestershire, Herefordshire and Gloucestershire. In Worcestershire and Herefordshire oast houses were known as hop kilns.

===Europe===

In Belgium, the main hop growing area is around Poperinghe and Ypres, West Flanders. Hops are also grown across the border in Nord, France. Hops are also grown around Aelst, north west of Brussels. Apart from Nord, the main hop growing area in France is around Haguenau, Bas-Rhin and around Dijon and Bèze, Côte-d&#x27;Or.

In Germany, hops are grown around Tettnang, Baden-Württemberg; around Hallertau, Hersbruck, Illschwang and Spalt, Bavaria. In the Czech Republic hops are grown around Roudnice, Hradec Králové Region and around Úštěk and Žatec, Ústí nad Labem Region. They are also grown around Olomouc, Olomouc Region. In Slovakia, hops are grown around Trenčín, Trenčín Region. Hops are also grown in Poland and Russia.

===Australia===
:&quot;See also John Terry&quot;

Oast houses are often called hop kilns in Australia. Tasmania is a major hop-growing area, as were parts of Victoria. During the 19th century, some of the Kentish hop growers emigrated, and took hops with them. Initially, Tasmanian oasts were converted from existing buildings (New Norfolk, Ranelagh) but later purpose-built oasts were built (Valley Field, Bushy Park). These oasts had louvred ventilators instead of a cowl. The New Norfolk oast was converted from a watermill and is now a museum. Another location that has oasts was Tyenna. A modern oast of was built at Bushy Park in 1982.

==Conversion==
With the increasing mechanisation of the hop-picking process, many oasts fell into disuse. Some were demolished and others became derelict. Increasing demand for housing has led to many oasts being converted into houses. Local councils nowadays are generally much stricter on the aesthetics of the conversions than was the case before the planning law came into being. Often kiln roofs have to be rebuilt, and cowls provided on converted oasts.

The earliest example of an oast being converted to a house is Millar&#x27;s Farm oast, Meopham, which was house-converted in 1903 by Sir Philip Waterlow.

Other conversions of oasts for non-residential purposes include a theatre (Oast Theatre, Tonbridge, Oast house Theatre Rainham), a Youth Hostel (Capstone Farm, Chatham, another at Lady Margaret Manor, Doddington – now a residential centre for people with learning difficulties), a school (Sturry), a bakery (Chartham), a visitor centre (Bough Beech reservoir), offices (Tatlingbury Farm, Five Oak Green), and a museum (Kent Museum of Rural Life, Sandling, Preston Street, Faversham, Wye College, Wye, and the former Whitbread Hop Farm at Beltring).

The National Trust owns an oast at Outridge, near Brasted Chart, which has very rare octagonal cowls, one at Castle Farm, Sissinghurst, converted to tea rooms, and another at Batemans, Burwash which has been converted to a shop, with the cowl being replaced by a dovecot.

===Fake oasts===

In recent years, a number of buildings have been erected to look as though they were oasts, although in fact, that is not the case. Examples of this are:
* Early Bird public house, Grove Green, Maidstone.
* Harrietsham, a group of offices.
* The Oast House public house, Normanton.
* The Oast House public house, Manchester.
* Langley Court, Beckenham, built by the Wellcome Foundation, now part of Glaxo Wellcome.
* Caring, Kent – Houses built in the form of oasts.
* South Harrow, London – a pub built in the form of an oast (now demolished and rebuilt as part of new housing).

* Malthouse - a similarly cowled building used for sprouting barley to make malt, also an ingredient in beer making.
* Chunche - a building for drying raisins (using the natural hot dry wind) in Xinjiang, China.

<doc id="671728" wikidata="Q6290138" url="?curid=671728" title="Joshua Pusey">
<text>Joshua Pusey (March 27, 1842 - May 8, 1906 (?)), was an American inventor and an attorney.

In 1827, an English pharmacist named John Walker produced his &quot;sulphuretted peroxide strikables,&quot; gigantic, yard-long sticks that can be considered the real precursor of today&#x27;s match. Small phosphorus matches were first marketed in Germany in 1832, but they were extremely hazardous. In 1836 in the United States, Alonzo D. Phillips of Springfield, Massachusetts, obtained a patent for &quot;manufacturing of friction matches&quot; and called them locofocos crazies. The danger problem was not resolved until the invention of amorphous (red) phosphorus in 1845. Carl Lundstrom of Sweden introduced the first red phosphorus &quot;safety&quot; matches in 1855. These type of matches were large and had to be carried in a wooden box, and Pusey didn&#x27;t like the bulkiness of this. He decided to make matches in a paper book that was easier to carry. In 1889 he finished and had created strike-able book matches.

Pusey was a Pennsylvanian attorney who was fond of smoking cigars. Fed up with carrying bulky boxes of wooden matches, he set to work to invent paper matches that would be lighter and smaller. His final design had matches secured to a thin paper wrapping with an attached striking surface. Unlike present-day matchbooks, Pusey positioned the striking surface on the inside of the paper fold. This allowed all 50 matches to be lit at once.
The Diamond Match Company later put the striking surface on the outside.

He received a patent for his invention of the paper matchbook (which he called &quot;flexibles&quot;) in 1889, but the idea did not catch on right away. Eight years later, in 1897, the Mendelssohn Opera Company distributed matchbooks with their logo emblazoned on them to advertise their New York City opening. After this promotion, demand for paper matchbooks soared.

Pusey later sold the invention to the Diamond Match Company for $4000 in 1896.

<doc id="671729" wikidata="Q1110159" url="?curid=671729" title="Cultural Christians">
<text>Cultural Christians are those who received Christian values or appreciate Christian culture. They may be non-practicing Christians, non-theists, apatheists, transtheists, deists, pantheists, or atheists. These individuals may identify as culturally Christian because of family background, personal experiences, or the social and cultural environment in which they grew up. 

Contrasting terms are &quot;practicing Christian&quot;, &quot;biblical Christian&quot;, &quot;committed Christian&quot;, or &quot;believing Christian&quot;.

The term &quot;cultural Christian&quot; may be specified further by Christian denomination, e.g. &quot;cultural Catholic&quot;, &quot;cultural Lutheran&quot;, and &quot;cultural Anglican&quot;.

==Usage==
===Belarus===
The President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, has identified as cultural Christian, calling himself an &quot;Orthodox atheist&quot; in one of his interviews.

===France===
French Deists of the 18th and early 19th centuries include Napoleon. The current President of France, Emmanuel Macron, identified himself as an &quot;Agnostic Catholic&quot;.

===China===
Traditionally, Christianity has been considered a &quot;foreign religion&quot; (, means non-local religions) in China, including all the negative connotations of foreignness common in China. This attitude only started to change at the end of the 20th century. In China, the term &quot;Cultural Christians&quot; () can refer to Chinese intellectuals devoted to the study of Christian theology, ethics, and literature, and often contribute to a movement known as Sino-Christian theology. Some of the earliest figures in this movement in the late-1980s and 1990s, such as Liu Xiaofeng and He Guanghu, were sympathetic to Christianity but chose not to associate with any local church. Since the 1990s, a newer generation of these Cultural Christians have been more willing to associate with local churches, and have often drawn on Calvinist theology.

===Italy===
The liberal writer Benedetto Croce, in his book (&#x27;Why we can&#x27;t not call ourselves &quot;Christians&quot;&#x27;), expressed the view that Roman Catholic traditions and values formed the basic culture of all Italians, believers and non-believers, and described Christianity primarily as a cultural revolution.

===United Kingdom===
Outspoken English atheist Richard Dawkins has described himself in several interviews as a &quot;cultural Christian&quot; and a &quot;cultural Anglican&quot;. In his book &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, he calls Jesus Christ praiseworthy for his ethics. Similarly, former prime minister Liz Truss described herself as saying &quot;I share the values of the Christian faith and the Church of England, but I&#x27;m not a regular practising religious person.&quot;

===United States===
Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father of the United States, considered himself part of Christian culture, despite his doubts about the divinity of Jesus.

== Demographics ==
===Western Europe===
European countries have a Christian cultural background, which was significant in inheriting European civilization, and Europe also came, in some contexts, to be seen as synonymous with &quot;Christendom&quot; (though properly speaking the term refers to the Christian world in its entirety). Today, many people in Western Europe remain &quot;culturally Christian&quot;. According to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center; Christianity is still the largest religion in Western Europe, where 71% of Western Europeans identified themselves as Christian. According to Pew Research Center &quot;most Christians in Western Europe today are non-practicing, but Christian identity still remains a meaningful religious, social and cultural marker&quot;, where 55% of Western Europeans identified themselves as non-practicing Christians, and 18% identified themselves as church-attending Christians.

====The Netherlands====
Forms of Christianity have dominated religious life in what is now the Netherlands for more than 1,200 years, and by the middle of the sixteenth century the country was strongly Protestant (Calvinist). The population of the Netherlands was predominantly Christian until the late 20th century, divided into a number of denominations. 

The provinces North Brabant and Limburg in the Netherlands are historically mostly Roman Catholic, therefore many of their people still use the term and some traditions as a base for their cultural identity rather than as a religious identity. Since the War of Independence the Catholics were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands.

From the Reformation to the 20th century, Dutch Catholics were largely confined to certain southern areas in the Netherlands, and they still tend to form a majority or large minority of the population in the southern provinces of the Netherlands, North Brabant and Limburg.

However, with modern population shifts and increasing secularization, these areas tend to have fewer and fewer religious Catholics. Since 1960 the emphasis on many Catholic concepts including hell, the devil, sinning and Catholic traditions like confession, kneeling, the teaching of catechism and having the host placed on the tongue by the priest rapidly disappeared, and these concepts are nowadays seldom or not at all found in modern Dutch Catholicism. The southern area still has original Catholic traditions including Carnival, pilgrimages, rituals like lighting candles for special occasions and field chapels and crucifixes in the landscape, giving the southern part of the Netherlands a distinctive Catholic atmosphere, with which the population identifies in contrast to the rest of the Netherlands. The vast majority of the (self-identifying) Catholic population in the Netherlands is now largely irreligious in practice. Research among Catholics in the Netherlands in 2007 shows that even among religious Dutch Catholics only 27% can be regarded as theist, 55% as ietsist, 17% as agnostic and 1% as atheist.

<doc id="671732" wikidata="Q312425" url="?curid=671732" title="Berossus">
<text>Berossus () or Berosus (; ; possibly derived from ) was an early-3rd-century BCE Hellenistic-era Babylonian writer, a priest of Bel Marduk and astronomer who wrote in the Koine Greek language. 

His original works, including the &quot;Babyloniaca&quot; (, have been lost but fragmentarily survive in some quotations, especially in the writings of the fourth-century CE Christian writer Eusebius.

Berossus has recently been identified with Bēl-reʾû-šunu, a high priest of the Esagila Temple mentioned in a document from 258 BCE.

== Name ==
The name &quot;Berossus&quot; likely originates from a theophoric name whose first component was Bel, meaning &quot;Lord,&quot; which was a common title for Marduk. The original name was either either Bēl-rē’ûšunu, meaning &quot;the god Bel is their shepherd,&quot; or Bēl-uṣuršu, meaning &quot;O Bel watch over him!&quot;

==Life and work==
Using ancient Babylonian records and texts that are now lost, Berossus published the &quot;Babyloniaca&quot; (hereafter, &quot;History of Babylonia&quot;) in three books some time around 290–278 BCE, by the patronage of the Macedonian/Seleucid king Antiochus I Soter (during the third year of his reign, according to Diodorus Siculus). Certain astrological fragments recorded by Pliny the Elder, Censorinus, Flavius Josephus, and Marcus Vitruvius Pollio are also attributed to Berossus, but are of unknown provenance, or indeed are uncertain as to where they might fit into his &quot;History&quot;. Vitruvius credits him with the invention of the semi-circular sundial hollowed out of a cubical block. A statue of him was erected in Athens, perhaps attesting to his fame and scholarship as historian and astronomer-astrologer.

A separate work, &quot;Procreatio&quot;, is attributed to him by the Latin commentaries on Aratus, &quot;Commentariorum in Aratum Reliquiae&quot;, but there is no proof of this connection. However, a direct citation (name and title) is rare in antiquity, and it may have referred to Book 1 of his &quot;History&quot;.

He was born during or before Alexander the Great&#x27;s reign over Babylon (330–323 BCE), with the earliest date suggested as 340 BCE. According to Vitruvius&#x27;s work &quot;de Architectura&quot;, he relocated eventually to the island of Kos off the coast of Asia Minor and established a school of astronomy there by the patronage of the king of Egypt. However, scholars have questioned whether it would have been possible to work under the Seleucids and then relocate to a region experiencing Ptolemaic control late in life. It is not known when he died.

==&quot;Babyloniaca&quot; (History of Babylonia)==

Versions at several removes of the remains of Berossos&#x27; lost &quot;Babyloniaca&quot; are given by two later Greek epitomes that were used by the Christian Eusebius of Caesarea for his &quot;Chronological Canons&quot;, the Greek manuscripts of which have been lost, but which can be largely recovered by the Latin translation and continuation of Jerome and a surviving Armenian translation. The reasons why Berossus wrote the &quot;History&quot; have not survived, though contemporaneous Greek historians generally did give reasons for the publication of their own histories. It is suggested that it was commissioned by Antiochus I, perhaps desiring a history of one of his newly acquired lands, or by the Great Temple priests, seeking justification for the worship of Marduk in Seleucid lands. Pure history writing &quot;per se&quot; was not a Babylonian concern, and Josephus testifies to Berossus&#x27; reputation as an astrologer. The excerpts quoted recount mythology and history that relate to Old Testament concerns. As historian and archaeologist W.G. Lambert observes: &quot;Of course Berossus may have written other works which are not quoted by Josephus and Eusebius because they lacked any Biblical interest&quot;. Lambert finds some statements in the Latin writers so clearly erroneous that it renders doubtful whether the writers had first-hand knowledge of Berossus&#x27; text.

===Sources and content===
The Armenian translations of Eusebius and Syncellus&#x27; transmissions (&quot;Chronicon&quot; and &quot;Ecloga Chronographica&quot;, respectively) both record Berossus&#x27; use of &quot;public records&quot; and it is possible that Berossus catalogued his sources. This did not make him reliable, only that he was careful with the sources and his access to priestly and sacred records allowed him to do what other Babylonians could not. What we have of ancient Mesopotamian myth is somewhat comparable with Berossus, though the exact integrity with which he transmitted his sources is unknown because much of the literature of Mesopotamia has not survived. What is clear is that the form of writing he used was dissimilar to actual Babylonian literature, writing as he did in Greek.

=== Book 1 ===
Book 1 fragments are preserved in Eusebius and Syncellus above, one of the main sources for knowledge about ancient near eastern cosmology in late antiquity due to its description of the Babylonian creation account and establishment of order, including the defeat of Thalatth (Tiamat) by Bel (Marduk). According to him, all knowledge was revealed to humans by the sea monster Oannes after the Creation, and so Verbrugghe and Wickersham (2000:17) have suggested that this is where the astrological fragments discussed above would fit, if at all.

=== Book 2 ===
Book 2 describes the history of the Babylonian kings from Alulim down to Nabonassar (747–734 BC). Eusebius reports that Apollodorus reports that Berossus recounts 432,000 years from the first king Aloros (Alulim) to the tenth king Xisouthros and the Babylonian Flood. From Berossus&#x27; genealogy, it is clear that he had access to king-lists in compiling this section of &quot;History&quot;, particularly in the kings before the Flood, and from the 7th century BC with Senakheirimos (Sennacherib, who ruled both Assyria and Babylon). His account of the Flood (preserved in Syncellus) is extremely similar to versions of the Epic of Gilgamesh that we have presently. However, in &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;, the main protagonist is Utnapishtim, while for Berossus, Xisouthros is probably a Greek transliteration of Ziusudra, the protagonist of the Sumerian version of the Flood.

Perhaps what Berossus omits to mention is also noteworthy. Much information on Sargon (c. 2300 BC) would have been available during his time (e.g., a birth legend preserved at El-Amarna and in an Assyrian fragment from 8th century BC, and two Neo-Babylonian fragments), but these were not mentioned. Similarly, the great Babylonian king Hammurabi (ca. 1750 BC) merits only passing mention. He did, however, mention that the queen Semiramis (probably Sammuramat, wife of Samshi-Adad V, 824–811 BC) was Assyrian. Perhaps it was in response to Greek writers mythologising her to the point where she was described as the founder of Babylon, daughter of the Syrian goddess Derketo, and married to Ninus (the legendary founder of Nineveh, according to Greek authors).

=== Book 3 ===
Book 3 relates the history of Babylon from Nabonassar to Antiochus I (presumably). Again, it is likely that he used king-lists, though it is not known which ones he used. The Mesopotamian documents known as &quot;King-List A&quot; (one copy from the 6th or 5th centuries BC) and &quot;Chronicle 1&quot; (3 copies with one confidently dated to 500 BC) are usually suggested as the ones he used, due to the synchronicity between those and his &quot;History&quot; (though there are some differences). A large part of his history around the time of Naboukhodonosoros (Nebuchadnezzar II, 604–562 BC) and Nabonnedos (Nabonidus, 556–539 BC) survives. Here we see his interpretation of history for the first time, moralising about the success and failure of kings based on their moral conduct. This is similar to another Babylonian history, &quot;Chronicle of Nabonidus&quot; (as well as to the Hebrew Bible), and differs from the rationalistic accounts of other Greek historians like Thucydides.

At the time of the Jewish historian Josephus (1st century AD), the historical records contained in Berossus&#x27; third book of his Chaldaic History were still extant and were used by Josephus in citing the regnal years of six Babylonian kings. Josephus&#x27; record of regnal years for these kings is also corroborated by Ptolemy of Alexandria in his &quot;Canon&quot;, excepting for the fact that the king that reigned between Neglissar and Nabonnedus is omitted by Ptolemy.

:Nabopolassar = reigned 21 years.
:Nebuchadnezzar b. Nabuchodonosor = reigned 43 years.
:Evil Merodach (also called Amel-Marduk) = reigned 2 years. (Josephus, elsewhere, contradicts Berossus, saying that Evil Merodach reigned 18 years).
:Neglissar (Neriglissoor) = reigned 4 years (Josephus, elsewhere, says that Neglissar reigned 40 years, which seems odd that it is a factor of 10). 
:Laborosoarchod (Labosordacus) = reigned 9 months.
:Nabonnedus (also known as Baltasar) = reigned 17 years, in which year, Cyrus king of Persia and Darius king of Media took Babel (Borsippus) from the Chaldaeans.

===Transmission and reception===
Berossus&#x27; work was not popular during the Hellenistic period. The usual account of Mesopotamian history was Ctesias of Cnidus&#x27;s &quot;Persica&quot;, while most of the value of Berossus was considered to be his astrological writings. Most pagan writers probably never read the &quot;History&quot; directly, and seem to have been dependent on Posidonius of Apamea (135–50 BC), who cited Berossos in his works. While Poseidonius&#x27;s accounts have not survived, the writings of these tertiary sources do: Vitruvius Pollio (a contemporary of Caesar Augustus), Pliny the Elder (d. 79 AD), and Seneca the Younger (d. 65 AD). Seven later pagan writers probably transmitted Berossus via Poseidonius through an additional intermediary. They were Aetius (1st or 2nd century AD), Cleomedes (second half of 2nd century AD), Pausanias (c. 150 AD), Athenaeus (c. 200 AD), Censorinus (3rd century AD), and an anonymous Latin commentator on the Greek poem &quot;Phaenomena&quot; by Aratus of Soloi (ca. 315–240/39 BC).

Jewish and Christian references to Berossus probably had a different source, either Alexander Polyhistor (c. 65 BC) or Juba II of Mauretania (c. 50 BC–20 AD). Polyhistor&#x27;s numerous works included a history of Assyria and Babylonia, while Juba wrote &quot;On the Assyrians&quot;, both using Berossus as their primary sources. Josephus&#x27; records of Berossus include some of the only extant narrative material, but he is probably dependent on Alexander Polyhistor, even if he did give the impression that he had direct access to Berossus. The fragments of the &quot;Babylonaica&quot; found in three Christian writers&#x27; works are probably dependent on Alexander or Juba (or both). They are Tatianus of Syria (2nd century AD), Theophilus Bishop of Antioch (180 AD), and Titus Flavius Clemens (c. 200 AD).

Like Poseidonius&#x27;, neither Alexander&#x27;s nor Juba&#x27;s works have survived. However, the material in Berossus was recorded by Abydenus (c. 200 BC) and Sextus Julius Africanus (early 3rd century AD). Both their works are also lost, possibly considered too long, but Eusebius Bishop of Caesaria (c. 260–340 AD), in his work the &quot;Chronicon&quot;, preserved some of their accounts. The Greek text of the &quot;Chronicon&quot; is also now lost to us but there is an ancient Armenian translation (500–800 AD) of it, and portions are quoted in Georgius Syncellus&#x27;s &quot;Ecloga Chronographica&quot; (c. 800–810 AD). Nothing of Berossus survives in Jerome&#x27;s Latin translation of Eusebius. Eusebius&#x27; other mentions of Berossus in &quot;Praeparatio Evangelica&quot; are derived from Josephus, Tatianus, and another inconsequential source (the last cite contains only, &quot;Berossus the Babylonian recorded Naboukhodonosoros in his history&quot;).

Christian writers after Eusebius are probably reliant on him, but include Pseudo-Justinus (3rd–5th century), Hesychius of Alexandria (5th century), Agathias (536–582), Moses of Chorene (8th century), an unknown geographer of unknown date, and the &quot;Suda&quot; (Byzantine dictionary from the 10th century). Thus, what little of Berossus remains is very fragmentary and indirect. The most direct source of material on Berossus is Josephus, received from Alexander Polyhistor. Most of the names in his king-lists and most of the potential narrative content have been lost or completely mangled as a result. Only Eusebius and Josephus preserve narrative material, and both had agendas. Eusebius was looking to construct a consistent chronology across different cultures, while Josephus was attempting to refute the charges that there was a civilization older than that of the Jews. However, the ten ante-diluvian kings were preserved by Christian apologists interested in how the long lifespans of the kings were similar to the long lifespans of the ante-diluvian ancestors in the story of Genesis.

== Memory ==
In later centuries, Berossus was remembered as a great astronomer, prophet, sage, and historiographer. For example, Pliny the Elder reports that a statue of Berossus was put up by the inhabitants of Athens due to the accuracy of his future-predictions. Another figure, Pausanias, says that Berossus was the father of the Hebrew Sibyl.

In an isolated report from Vitruvius, it is claimed that Berossus founded a school of astronomy at the Island of Kos, although this is typically dismissed as a later invention. Some historians have suggested that the tale originated to provide a story that creates continuity between Babylonian and Greek astronomy.

In 1498, Annius of Viterbo claimed to have discovered lost books of Berossus. These were in fact an elaborate forgery. However, they greatly influenced Renaissance ways of thinking about population and migration, because Annius provided a list of kings from Japhet onwards, filling a historical gap following the Biblical account of the Flood. Annius also introduced characters from classical sources into the biblical framework, publishing his account as &quot;Commentaria super opera diversorum auctorum de antiquitatibus loquentium&quot; (&quot;Commentaries on the Works of Various Authors Discussing Antiquity&quot;). One consequence was sophisticated theories about Celtic races with Druid priests in Western Europe.

The weekday simulcasts of the BBC One news bulletins and &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; continue to be shown on the channel and a simulcast of &quot;Newsnight&quot; is launched.
** 14 August – The BBC&#x27;s Maida Vale Studios, which have been the venue for performances by artists including The Beatles and Adele, are sold to a group led by composer Hans Zimmer.
** September – &quot;Test Match Special&quot; ends on Radio 4 long wave after 30 summer seasons of cricket commentary on that frequency.

**31 March – Radio 4&#x27;s long wave opt-outs end. &quot;Yesterday in Parliament&quot; and &quot;The Daily Service&quot; move to BBC Radio 4 Extra and Shipping Forecasts are reduced from four bulletins to two on weekdays and three at the weekend.

<text>Iceland is well suited for waterfalls (Icelandic: s. &quot;foss,&quot; pl. &quot;fossar&quot;). This Nordic island country lies along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which separates North America and Europe near where the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans meet. Frequent rain and snow impact its near-Arctic location. Large glaciers exist throughout the country whose summer melts feed many rivers. As a result, it is home to a number of large and powerful waterfalls. It is estimated that there are more than 10.000 waterfalls in Iceland.

<doc id="671736" wikidata="Q1045259" url="?curid=671736" title="Tall poppy syndrome">
<text>Tall poppy syndrome is a term which originated in Australia and New Zealand in the 1980s that refers to people with notable public success, who excessively promote their own achievements and opinions. Intense scrutiny and criticism of such a person is termed as &quot;cutting down the tall poppy&quot;. 

==Etymology==
The phrase &quot;tall poppies&quot; originates from Livy&#x27;s account of the tyrannical Roman king Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. He is said to have received a messenger from his son Sextus Tarquinius asking what he should do next in Gabii, since he had become all-powerful there. Rather than answering the messenger verbally, Tarquin went into his garden, took a stick and swept it across his garden, thus cutting off the heads of the tallest poppies that were growing there. The messenger returned to Gabii and told Sextus what he had seen. Sextus realised that his father wished him to put to death all of the most eminent people of Gabii, which he then did.

Earlier stories with the same theme are found in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot; (in which Periander, the tyrant of Corinth, makes the gesture to a herald of Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus) and in Herodotus&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot; (in which Thrasybulus makes the gesture to Periander&#x27;s herald). However, these Greek stories involve fields of grain; Livy&#x27;s Roman tale is the first to feature poppies.

==Australia and New Zealand==
In Australia and New Zealand, &quot;cutting down the tall poppy&quot; is sometimes used by business entrepreneurs to describe those who deliberately criticise other people for their success and achievements. It has been described as being the by-product of the Australian and New Zealand cultural value of egalitarianism.

In New Zealand, academic study concerning the prevalence of Tall Poppy Syndrome and its impact on the economy of New Zealand has become an area of increased focus. Interest in the effects of Tall Poppy Syndrome became reinvigorated in 2021 following the suicide of entrepreneur Jake Millar, who had received negative media coverage surrounding one of his start-up companies. While research is limited, a handfull of studies into the economic impact of Tall Poppy Syndrome conducted throughout the 2020s have shown a negative impact on entrepreneurship, risk-taking, and overall economic growth in New Zealand.

==In other countries==
In Japan, a similar common expression is &quot;the nail that sticks up gets hammered down&quot; (出る杭は打たれる). 

In the Netherlands, this expression is &quot;don&#x27;t put your head above ground level&quot; (), with the cultural phenomenon being named&quot; maaiveldcultuur&quot;.

In Chile, this expression is known as (&#x27;pull the jacket&#x27;). 

In Scandinavia, this expression is known as the Law of Jante. The Law of Jante originates from a 1933 novel by Aksel Sandemose. It contains rules and stipulations such as &quot;you&#x27;re not to think you are anything special&quot; and &quot;perhaps you don&#x27;t think &quot;we&quot; know a few things about &quot;you&quot;?&quot;.

In Canada, the term &quot;tall poppy syndrome&quot; is used in particular to refer to successful women being criticised for their success.

<text>Norwegians () are an ethnic group and nation native to Norway, where they form the vast majority of the population. They share a common culture and speak the Norwegian language. Norwegians are descended from the Norse of the Early Middle Ages who formed a unified Kingdom of Norway in the 9th century. During the Viking Age, Norwegians and other Norse peoples conquered, settled and ruled parts of the British Isles, the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Greenland. Norwegians are closely related to other descendants of the Norsemen such as Danes, Swedes, Icelanders and the Faroe Islanders, as well as groups such as the Scots whose nation they significantly settled and left a lasting impact in, particularly the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland).

The Norwegian language, with its two official standard forms, more specifically Bokmål and Nynorsk, is part of the larger Scandinavian dialect continuum of generally mutually intelligible languages in Scandinavia. Norwegian people and their descendants are found in migrant communities worldwide, notably in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom. Norwegians are traditionally Lutheran since the Reformation in Denmark–Norway and Holstein which made Lutheranism the only legal religion in the country, however large portions of the population are now either non-practicing, atheist or agnostic.

==History==

Towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC, Proto-Indo-European–speaking Battle-Axe peoples migrated to Norway bringing domesticated horses, agriculture, cattle and wheel technology to the region.

During the Viking Age, Harald Fairhair unified the Norse petty kingdoms after being victorious at the Battle of Hafrsfjord in the 880s. Two centuries of Viking expansion tapered off following the decline of Norse paganism with the adoption of Christianity in the 11th century. During The Black Death, approximately 60% of the population died and in 1397 Norway entered a union with Denmark.

In 1814, following Denmark–Norway&#x27;s defeat in the Napoleonic Wars, Norway entered a union with Sweden and adopted a new constitution. Rising nationalism throughout the 19th century led to a 1905 referendum granting Norway independence. Although Norway remained officially neutral in World War I, the country was unofficially allied with the Entente powers. In World War II, Norway proclaimed its neutrality, but was nonetheless occupied for five years by Nazi Germany (1940–45). In 1949, neutrality was abandoned and Norway became a member of NATO. Discovery of oil and gas in adjacent waters in the late 1960s boosted Norway&#x27;s economy but in referendums held in 1972 and 1994, Norway rejected joining the EU. Key domestic issues include integration of a fast-growing immigrant population, maintaining the country&#x27;s generous social safety net with an aging population, and preserving economic competitiveness.

==Geographic distribution==
===Viking Age===
Norwegian or Norse Vikings raided and settled in Shetland, Orkney, Ireland, Scotland, and northern England. In the United Kingdom, many names for places ending in -&quot;kirk&quot;, -&quot;ness&quot;, -&quot;thorpe&quot;, -&quot;toft&quot; and -&quot;by&quot; are likely Norse in origin. In 947, a new wave of Norwegian Vikings appeared in England when Erik Bloodaxe captured York. In the 8th century and onwards, Norwegian and Danish Vikings also settled in Normandy, most famously those led by Rollo; some of their Norman descendants would later expand to England, Sicily, and other Mediterranean islands.

Apart from Britain and Ireland, Norwegian Vikings established settlements in largely uninhabited regions. The first known permanent Norwegian settler in Iceland was Ingólfur Arnarson. In the year 874 he settled in Reykjavík.

After his expulsion from Iceland Erik the Red discovered Greenland, a name he chose in hope of attracting Icelandic settlers. Viking settlements were established in the sheltered fjords of the southern and western coast. Erik&#x27;s relative Leif Eriksson later discovered North America.

=== Netherlands ===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, many Norwegians emigrated to the Netherlands, particularly Amsterdam. The Netherlands was the second-most popular destination for Norwegian emigrants after Denmark. Loosely estimated, some 10% of the population may have emigrated, in a period when the entire Norwegian population consisted of some 800,000 people.

The Norwegians left with the Dutch trade ships that when in Norway traded for timber, hides, herring, and stockfish (dried codfish). Young women took employment as maids in Amsterdam, while young men took employment as sailors. Large parts of the Dutch merchant fleet and navy came to consist of Norwegians and Danes. Most took Dutch names, leaving no trace of Norwegian names in the later Dutch population.

The emigration to the Netherlands was so devastating to the homelands that the Danish-Norwegian king issued penalties of death for emigration, but repeatedly had to issue amnesties for those willing to return, announced by posters in the streets of Amsterdam. Increasingly, Dutchmen who search their genealogical roots turn to Norway. Many Norwegians who emigrated to the Netherlands, and often were employed in the Dutch merchant fleet, emigrated further to the many Dutch colonies such as New Amsterdam (New York).

=== North America ===


==== United States ====

Many Norwegians emigrated to the US between the 1850s and the 1920s. The descendants of these people are known as Norwegian Americans. Many Norwegian settlers traveled to and through Canada and Canadian ports while immigrating to the United States. In 1850, the year after Great Britain repealed its restrictive Navigation Acts in Canada, more emigrating Norwegians sailed the shorter route to the Ville de Québec (Quebec City) in Canada, to make their way to US cities like Chicago, Milwaukee, and Green Bay by steamship. For example, in the 1850s, 28,640 arrived at Quebec, Canada, en route to the US, and 8,351 at New York directly. According to the 2000 U.S. Census, three million Americans consider Norwegian to be their sole or primary ancestry. It is estimated that as many as a further 1.5 million more are of partial Norwegian ancestry. Norwegian Americans represent 2–3% of the non-Hispanic Euro-American population in the U.S. They mostly live in both the Upper Midwest and Pacific Northwest.

====Canada====

As early as 1814, a party of Norwegians was brought to Canada to build a winter road from York Factory on Hudson Bay to the infant Red River settlement at the site of present-day Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. Norway House is one of the oldest trading posts and Native-Canadian missions in the Canadian West. Willard Ferdinand Wentzel served the North West Company of Canada in the Athabasca and Mackenzie regions and accompanied Sir John Franklin on his overland expedition in 1819–20 to the Canadian Arctic.

Norwegian immigration to Canada lasted from the mid-1880s until 1930, although Norwegians were already working in Canada as early as 1814. It can be divided into three periods of roughly fifteen years each. In the first, to about 1900, thousands of Norwegians homesteaded on the Canadian prairies. In the second, from 1900 to 1914, there was a further heavy influx of Norwegians immigrating to Canada from the United States because of poor economic conditions in the US, and 18,790 from Norway. In the third, from 1919 to 1930, 21,874 people came directly from Norway, with the peak year in 1927, when 5,103 Norwegians arrived, spurred by severe depression at home. They came with limited means, many leaving dole queues.

From 1825 to 1900 some 500,000 Norwegians landed at Ville du Quebec in Canada (and other Canadian ports) for travelling through Canada was the shortest corridor to the United States&#x27; central states. In spite of efforts by the Government of Canada to retain these immigrants for Canada, very few remained because of Canada&#x27;s somewhat restrictive land policies at that time and negative stories being told about Canada from U.S. land agents deterring Norwegians from going to Canada. Not until the 1880s did Norwegians accept Canada as a land of opportunity. This was also true of the many Americans of Norwegian heritage who immigrated to Canada from the US with &quot;Canada Fever&quot; seeking homesteads and new economic opportunities. By 1921 one-third of all Norwegians in Canada had been born in the US.

These new Canadians became British subjects in Canada, and part of the British Empire. Canadian citizenship, as a status distinct from that of a British subject, was created on 1 January 1947, with Canada being the first Commonwealth country to create their own citizenship. Prior to that date, Canadians were British subjects and Canada&#x27;s nationality law closely mirrored that of the United Kingdom. On 1 January 1947, Canadian citizenship was conferred on most British subjects connected with Canada. Unlike the US, Canada was part of the British Empire and most Norwegians would have become Canadians and British subjects at the same time.

According to the 2011 Census, 452,705 Canadians reported Norwegian ancestry (Norwegian-Canadians).

===Australia===

As of 2011, there were 3,710 Norwegian-born Australians, and 23,037 Norwegians of Australian descent.

===Russia===

In the 19th century a community known as the Kola Norwegians settled in the environs of the Russian city of Murmansk. They have suffered persecution under Joseph Stalin and after 1992 were offered a chance to get back to Norway. There are very few of them left there today.

===Other===
==Genetics==
According to recent genetic analysis, both mtDNA (mitochondrial DNA) and Y-chromosome polymorphisms showed a noticeable genetic affinity between the Norwegian population and other ethnic groups in Northern and Central Europe, particularly with the Germans. This is due to a history of at least a thousand years of large-scale migration both in and out of Norway.

Norwegians, like most Europeans, largely descend from three distinct lineages: Mesolithic hunter-gatherers, descended from a Cro-Magnon population that arrived in Europe about 45,000 years ago, Neolithic farmers who migrated from Anatolia during the Neolithic Revolution 9,000 years ago, and Yamnaya steppe pastoralists who expanded into Europe from the Pontic–Caspian steppe in the context of Indo-European migrations 5000 years ago.

The Norwegian population is typical of the Northern European population with Haplogroup I1 being the most common Y-haplogroup, at about 37,3%. Norwegians also show the characteristic R1a genes of the paternal ancestorship at 17.9% to 30.8%. Such large frequencies of R1a have been found only in East Europe and India. R1b gene showing paternal descent is also widespread at 25.9% to 30.8%.

Norwegian genetic ancestry also exists in many locations where Norwegians immigrated. In particular, several northern states in the United States (Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Montana) show Scandinavian (which includes Norwegian) ancestry proportions among European descent (white) persons of 10 to 20%. Similarly, Norwegian ancestry has been found to account for about 25% of ancestry of the population of the Shetland Islands and Danish-Norwegian ancestry has been found to account for about 25% of ancestry of the population of Greenland.

=== Y-chromosome DNA ===
Y-Chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) represents the male lineage, The Norwegian Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows where haplogroups R1 &amp; I comprise generally more than 85% of the total chromosomes.

* I – 55%
* R1 – 35%
* NOP ~ 5%
* Other Haplogroups ~ 5%

=== Mitochondrial DNA ===
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) represents the female lineage, Haplogroup H represent about 40% of the Norwegian mitochondrial DNA lineages

* H ~ 40%
* JT ~ 23%
* UK ~ 22%
* IWX ~ 5%
* V ~ 5%
* Other lineages ~ 5%

== Language ==

Norwegian is a North Germanic language with approximately 5 million speakers, of whom most are located in Norway. There are also some speakers of Norwegian in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Britain, Spain, Canada, and the United States, where the largest community of speakers exists, with 55,311 speakers as of 2000; approximately half of the speakers live in Minnesota (8,060), California (5,865), Washington (5,460), New York (4,200), and Wisconsin (3,520).

As of 2006, in Canada, there are 7,710 Norwegian speakers, of whom 3,420 reside in British Columbia, 1,360 in Alberta, and 1,145 in Ontario.

== Culture ==

Norwegian culture is closely linked to the country&#x27;s history and geography. The unique Norwegian farm culture, sustained to this day, has resulted not only from scarce resources and a harsh climate but also from ancient property laws. In the 18th century, it brought about a strong romantic nationalistic movement, which is still visible in the Norwegian language and media. In the 19th century, Norwegian culture blossomed as efforts continued to achieve an independent identity in the areas of literature, art and music.

=== Cuisine ===

Norway&#x27;s culinary traditions show the influence of long seafaring and farming traditions with salmon (fresh and cured), herring (pickled or marinated), trout, codfish and other seafood balanced by cheeses, dairy products and excellent breads (predominantly dark/darker). Lefse is a common Norwegian potato flatbread, common around Christmas. For renowned Norwegian dishes, see lutefisk, smalahove, pinnekjøtt, Krotekake and fårikål.

=== Music ===

Along with the classical music of romantic composer Edvard Grieg and the modern music of Arne Nordheim, Norwegian black metal has become something of an export article in recent years.

Norway&#x27;s classical performers include Leif Ove Andsnes, one of the world&#x27;s more famous pianists, and Truls Mørk, an outstanding cellist.

The jazz scene in Norway is also thriving. Jan Garbarek, Mari Boine, Arild Andersen, and Bugge Wesseltoft are internationally recognised while Paal Nilssen-Love, Supersilent, Jaga Jazzist and Wibutee are becoming world-class artists of the younger generation.

Norway has a strong folk music tradition which remains popular to this day. Among the most prominent folk musicians are Hardanger fiddlers Andrea Een, Olav Jørgen Hegge, Vidar Lande and Annbjørg Lien, violinist Susanne Lundeng, and vocalists Agnes Buen Garnås, Kirsten Bråten Berg and Odd Nordstoga.

=== Celebrations ===

Norwegians celebrate their national day on 17 May, dedicated to the Constitution of Norway. Many people wear &quot;bunad&quot; (traditional costumes) and most participate in or watch the Norwegian Constitution Day
parade that day, consisting mostly of children, through the cities and towns. The national romanticist author Henrik Wergeland was the founder of the 17 May parade.
Common Christian holidays are also celebrated, the most important being Christmas (called &quot;Jul&quot; in Norway after the pagan and early Viking winter solstice) and Easter (Påske). In Norway, the Santa (called Nissen) comes at Christmas Eve, the 24 December, with the presents, not the morning after as in many English speaking countries. He usually comes late in the evening, after the Christmas dinner many children consider long, boring and unnecessary.

&quot;Jonsok&quot; (St. John&#x27;s Passing), or &quot;St. Hans&quot; (St. John&#x27;s Day), i.e. 24 June, is also a commonly revered holiday. It marks midsummer and the beginning of summer vacation, and is often celebrated by lighting bonfires the evening before. In Northern areas of Norway, this day has 24 hours of light, while southern areas have only 17.5 hours.

===Religion===
The conversion of Norway to Christianity from Norse paganism began in 1000. By the middle of the 11th century, Christianity had become well-established in Norway and had become dominant by the middle of the 12th century. The Norwegians were Catholics until the Danish king Christian III of Denmark forced them to convert to Lutheranism and established a state-governed church. The church undertook a program to convert the Sámi in the 16th and 17th century, with the program being largely successful.

In the 19th century, emigration from Norway for political and religious motives began and Lutheranism spread to the United States. As a result of this, many of the Norwegians remaining in Norway were religiously moderate; subsequently, church attendance declined throughout the 20th century, as reflected by 78% of the population stating that religion is unimportant in a Gallup poll and low weekly church attendance, at 2%, particularly when compared to that of North Dakota, the state in which Norwegians constitute approximately 30.4% of the population. Of all U.S. states, North Dakota has the lowest percentage of non-religious people and the largest number of churches per capita. It weekly church attendance is at 43%.

In Norway the Church of Norway and state are not entirely separated. An act approved in 2016 created the Church of Norway as an independent legal entity, effective from 1 January 2017. The Church of Norway was previously the country&#x27;s official religion, and its central administrative functions were carried out by the Royal Ministry of Government Administration, Reform and Church Affairs until 2017. The Lutheran Church is still mentioned in the constitution, for example, the King is still required to profess a Lutheran faith. When baptised, children are registered in the Church of Norway&#x27;s member register, leading to a large membership, although many people do not remain observant as adults. A majority of both ethnic Norwegians and Sámi are nominally Christian, but not necessarily observant. In Norway as of 2018, 70% of the population are members of the Lutheran Church, though only 47.1% answered &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; in a 2018 European Values Study.

==Other terms used==
The Norwegians are and have been referred to by other terms as well.

Some of them include:
* Nordmenn: a term used by Scandinavians to denote Norwegians. It translates as &quot;Northmen&quot;. (Singular: Nordmann)
* &quot;Northmen&quot;: old term used by other European peoples to denote the peoples originating in the northern regions of Europe.
* &quot;Norsemen&quot; or &quot;Norse&quot;: Viking Age peoples of Nordic origin.
* &quot;Vikings&quot;: used in the Nordic countries to denote people who went raiding, pillaging or &quot;slave catching&quot; during the Viking Age. Used in a similar way by other peoples but can also mean Scandinavians in general.
* &quot;Minnewegian&quot;: colloquial term for a Norwegian Minnesotan.
* &quot;Norski&quot;: common name for Northern American Norwegians.
* &quot;Norrbagge&quot;: a Swedish (derogatory) term for Norwegians (first attested use in 1257) of uncertain meaning. Some claim that it is based on the root &quot;bagge&quot; meaning sheep&#x27;s testicles in some Swedish dialects. Another explanation is that &quot;bagge&quot; refers to Bagaholm where Bohus Fortress lies, at an ancient border between Norway and Sweden. Nordbagge then means people who lives on the north (Swedish: norr) side of Bagaholm.

<text>The Highland (Icelandic: &quot;Hálendið)&quot; or The Central Highland is an area that comprises much of the interior land of Iceland. The Highland is situated above 300–400 meters (1000–1300 feet) and is mostly uninhabitable. The soil is primarily volcanic ash, and the terrain consists of basalt mountains and lava fields. Snow covers the Highland from October until the beginning of June. A few oasis-like areas, such as Herðubreiðarlindir and Þórsmörk, are also found in the Highland. The area has many notable natural features and hiking trails.

== Natural features in the Highland ==
The Highland encompasses various geological features, including Landmannalaugar, Torfajökull, Eldgjá, Þórsmörk, Herðubreið, Askja, Hveradalir, Lakagígar, and the Fagrifoss waterfall. Sites in the Highland are difficult to access and may be accessible only during the summer months. Most sites require all-wheel drive or all-terrain vehicles for access due to the unpaved dirt roads. 

== Glaciers and volcanoes in the Highland ==
The largest glaciers in the Highland are Vatnajökull, Langjökull, Eyjafjallajökull, Mýrdalsjökull, and Hofsjökull, with multiple outlet glaciers. Many glaciers occur atop volcanoes, some of which erupt regularly, such as the Bárðabunga volcano. The most famous of these volcanoes in recent times is Eyjafjallajökull, which erupted in 2010. In the sandy Highland, vegetation is found only at the edges of glaciers and near rivers and streams. There is a pervasive danger of glacial outburst floods, or &quot;glacier runs,&quot; at times of eruptions and volcanic activity. The radiating heat causes the underside of glaciers to melt, creating large pockets of water that accumulate until they burst. This phenomenon is unique to Iceland and is internationally known by the Icelandic term jökulhlaup.

== Recreation in the Highland==
There are several hiking trails in the Highland. A popular route is the 54 km Laugavegur hiking trail from Landmannalaugar to Þórsmörk. Other notable hikes are Fimmvörðuháls and old Kjalvegur. 

== Highland roads or F-Roads==
The Highland can be crossed only during the Icelandic summer. For the rest of the year, Highland roads are closed. Driving off-road is forbidden, to protect both drivers and environmental features.

The best-known Highland roads are Kaldidalur, Kjölur, Kjalvegur, Fjallabak syðri, Fjallabak nyrðri, Lakavegur, Kverkfjöll, and Sprengisandur. Most Highland roads require four-wheel drive vehicles, which also assist in crossing rivers. However, the Kjölur route can be traversed easily in an ordinary car and is therefore one of the more popular Highland roads.

<doc id="671768" wikidata="Q1391812" url="?curid=671768" title="Faddeev–Popov ghost">
<text>In physics, Faddeev–Popov ghosts (also called Faddeev–Popov gauge ghosts or Faddeev–Popov ghost fields) are extraneous fields which are introduced into gauge quantum field theories to maintain the consistency of the path integral formulation. They are named after Ludvig Faddeev and Victor Popov.

A more general meaning of the word &quot;ghost&quot; in theoretical physics is discussed in Ghost (physics).

==Overcounting in Feynman path integrals==
The necessity for Faddeev–Popov ghosts follows from the requirement that quantum field theories yield unambiguous, non-singular solutions. This is not possible in the path integral formulation when a gauge symmetry is present since there is no procedure for selecting among physically equivalent solutions related by gauge transformation. The path integrals overcount field configurations corresponding to the same physical state; the measure of the path integrals contains a factor which does not allow obtaining various results directly from the action.

===Faddeev–Popov procedure===
It is possible, however, to modify the action, such that methods such as Feynman diagrams will be applicable by adding &quot;ghost fields&quot; which break the gauge symmetry. The ghost fields do not correspond to any real particles in external states: they appear as virtual particles in Feynman diagrams – or as the &quot;absence&quot; of some gauge configurations. However, they are a necessary computational tool to preserve unitarity.

The exact form or formulation of ghosts is dependent on the particular gauge chosen, although the same physical results must be obtained with all gauges since the gauge one chooses to carry out calculations is an arbitrary choice. The Feynman–&#x27;t Hooft gauge is usually the simplest gauge for this purpose, and is assumed for the rest of this article.

Consider for example non-Abelian gauge theory with 
:formula_1
The integral needs to be constrained via gauge-fixing via formula_2 to integrate only over physically distinct configurations. Following Faddeev and Popov, this constraint can be applied by inserting 
:formula_3
into the integral. formula_4 denotes the gauge-fixed field.

==Spin–statistics relation violated==
The Faddeev–Popov ghosts violate the spin–statistics relation, which is another reason why they are often regarded as &quot;non-physical&quot; particles.

For example, in Yang–Mills theories (such as quantum chromodynamics) the ghosts are complex scalar fields (spin 0), but they anti-commute (like fermions).

In general, anti-commuting ghosts are associated with bosonic symmetries, while commuting ghosts are associated with fermionic symmetries.

==Gauge fields and associated ghost fields==
Every gauge field has an associated ghost, and where the gauge field acquires a mass via the Higgs mechanism, the associated ghost field acquires the same mass (in the Feynman–&#x27;t Hooft gauge only, not true for other gauges).

==Appearance in Feynman diagrams==
In Feynman diagrams, the ghosts appear as closed loops wholly composed of 3-vertices, attached to the rest of the diagram via a gauge particle at each 3-vertex. Their contribution to the S-matrix is exactly cancelled (in the Feynman–&#x27;t Hooft gauge) by a contribution from a similar loop of gauge particles with only 3-vertex couplings or gauge attachments to the rest of the diagram. (A loop of gauge particles not wholly composed of 3-vertex couplings is not cancelled by ghosts.) The opposite sign of the contribution of the ghost and gauge loops is due to them having opposite fermionic/bosonic natures. (Closed fermion loops have an extra −1 associated with them; bosonic loops don&#x27;t.)

==Ghost field Lagrangian==
The Lagrangian for the ghost fields formula_5 in Yang–Mills theories (where formula_6 is an index in the adjoint representation of the gauge group) is given by
:formula_7
The first term is a kinetic term like for regular complex scalar fields, and the second term describes the interaction with the gauge fields as well as the Higgs field. Note that in &quot;abelian&quot; gauge theories (such as quantum electrodynamics) the ghosts do not have any effect since the structure constants formula_8 vanish. Consequently, the ghost particles do not interact with abelian gauge fields.

<text>In operator theory, a bounded operator &quot;T&quot; on a Banach space is said to be [[nilpotent]] if &quot;Tn&quot; = 0 for some positive integer &quot;n&quot;. It is said to be quasinilpotent or topologically nilpotent if its spectrum &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) = {0}.

==Examples==
In the finite-dimensional case, i.e. when &quot;T&quot; is a square matrix (Nilpotent matrix) with complex entries, &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) = {0} if and only if
&quot;T&quot; is similar to a matrix whose only nonzero entries are on the superdiagonal(this fact is used to prove the existence of Jordan canonical form). In turn this is equivalent to &quot;Tn&quot; = 0 for some &quot;n&quot;. Therefore, for matrices, quasinilpotency coincides with nilpotency.

This is not true when &quot;H&quot; is infinite-dimensional. Consider the Volterra operator, defined as follows: consider the unit square &quot;X&quot; = [0,1] × [0,1] ⊂ R2, with the Lebesgue measure &quot;m&quot;. On &quot;X&quot;, define the kernel function &quot;K&quot; by

:formula_1 

The Volterra operator is the corresponding integral operator &quot;T&quot; on the Hilbert space &quot;L&quot;2(0,1) given by

:formula_2

The operator &quot;T&quot; is not nilpotent: take &quot;f&quot; to be the function that is 1 everywhere and direct calculation shows that 
&quot;Tn f&quot; ≠ 0 (in the sense of &quot;L&quot;2) for all &quot;n&quot;. However, &quot;T&quot; is quasinilpotent. First notice that &quot;K&quot; is in &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;m&quot;), therefore &quot;T&quot; is compact. By the spectral properties of compact operators, any nonzero &quot;λ&quot; in &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;T&quot;) is an eigenvalue. But it can be shown that &quot;T&quot; has no nonzero eigenvalues, therefore &quot;T&quot; is quasinilpotent.
