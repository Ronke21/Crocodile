<text>New York State Route 2 (NY 2) is a state highway in the Capital District of New York in the United States. It extends for from an interchange with Interstate 87 (I-87) and NY 7 in the town of Colonie to the Massachusetts state line in Petersburgh, where it continues to Boston as Massachusetts Route 2. The route passes through the cities of Watervliet and Troy, where it connects to NY 32 and U.S. Route 4, respectively. In Grafton, located midway between Troy and Massachusetts, NY 2 serves Grafton Lakes State Park.

Most of the route was originally designated as part of an unsigned legislative route in the 1910s. In 1924, the portion of modern NY 2 between the hamlet of Latham and downtown Troy became part of NY 9. The rest of the highway was designated as NY 96 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 96 was renumbered to NY 2 in 1942. From 1942 to 1970, NY 2 continued south along the Hudson River from Troy to Albany. It was extended to Latham in 1985, replacing a section of NY 7 that had been realigned onto a new parallel freeway to the north.

==Route description==
===Albany County and Troy===
NY 2 begins at I-87 (the Adirondack Northway) exit 6 in the hamlet of Latham, where NY 7 leaves Troy–Schenectady Road to join I-87. The route proceeds east on Troy–Schenectady Road, a four-lane boulevard in the town of Colonie. Passing south of the Latham Farms Shopping Center, and soon north of the Latham Circle Mall, the route enters Latham Circle, where it connects to US 9 (Loudon Road). Instead of directly intersecting US 9, NY 2 meets a series of ramps leading to and from the road while US 9 itself crosses under the circle, allowing for a continuous flow of traffic on US 9. East of US 9, NY 2 runs southeast through Colonie, serving residential neighborhoods and a short commercialized stretch on its way into the riverside city of Watervliet, where it becomes 19th Street. Two blocks into the city, maintenance of the route shifts from the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to the city highway department.
The highway initially serves three blocks of homes before entering a linear commercial district at a junction with 12th Avenue. From here, the road crosses a Canadian Pacific Railway line as it approaches downtown Watervliet, where state maintenance resumes one block west of an intersection with NY 32 (Second Avenue). Past NY 32, NY 2 crosses over I-787 and the Hudson River on the Congress Street Bridge, which links Watervliet to the city of Troy on the opposite bank. Just east of the bridge, the route enters a partial interchange with Front Street and splits into a one-way pair along Congress Street (westbound) and Ferry Street (eastbound), both two lanes wide. The couplet takes the route through the Central Troy Historic District, where NY 2 eastbound heads into a two-block tunnel that carries the highway underneath the campus of Russell Sage College.

Ferry Street returns to surface level at 3rd Street, where NY 2 meets the southbound half of US 4, which is also routed along a one-way pair through the city. A junction with US 4 northbound follows two blocks to the east at 4th Street. While most of NY 2 westbound is city-maintained in Troy, NY 2 eastbound is a state road up through its intersection with 5th Avenue. After 5th Avenue, the highway leaves downtown Troy and begins to climb the hills overlooking the city. Near the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Ferry and Congress streets merge to form a single two-lane road carrying the Congress Street name. The route runs southeastward from the merge, serving another commercial strip in the Eastside section of the city and connecting to the northern terminus of NY 66 (Pawling Avenue).

===East of Troy===
Past NY 66, NY 2 changes names to Brunswick Road and turns northeastward through a residential section of Troy. It loosely parallels the northern edge of Poesten Kill to the Troy city line, where the highway reaches the southern terminus of County Route 141 (CR 141 or South Lake Avenue). State maintenance of NY 2 resumes as the road heads into the town of Brunswick, where the homes along the highway become less frequent and more scattered. The route runs past occasional stretches of dense woods to reach the hamlet of Eagle Mills, where it intersects with the eastern terminus of CR 140 (Pinewoods Avenue) and the south end of CR 133 (Moonlawn Road). Outside of Eagle Mills, development along NY 2 continues to dwindle as it takes a more northerly track through the town. It bends back to the east near Clums Corners, the site of intersections with the southern terminus of NY 278 (Brick Church Road) and the northern terminus of NY 351 (Farm to Market Road).
East of Clums Corners, NY 2 loses the Brunswick Road name as it heads northeast through increasingly rural areas along the Quacken Kill. The route crosses the western terminus of CR 79 (Blue Factory Road) along this stretch before winding back to the southeast at the Grafton town line. It soon takes a more easterly track through Grafton, intersecting both ends of CR 84 (Old Road) on its way into the residential hamlet of Grafton. The route connects to Grafton Lakes State Park Way, the main road leading into Grafton Lakes State Park, and the northern terminus of CR 85 (South Road) before leaving the community. From the hamlet of Grafton, NY 2 winds southeast through rural sections of the town of Grafton, slowly heading downhill toward the Grafton–Petersburgh town line. In Petersburgh, the highway meets the southern terminus of CR 94 (Dill Brook Road) on its way into the hamlet of Petersburgh.

In the center of the community, NY 2 connects to NY 22 by way of Moses Road (eastbound) and Main Street (westbound), both designated as NY 914A, an unsigned reference route. NY 2 itself crosses over NY 22, taking on the Main Street name as it runs through the center of Petersburgh. Past the hamlet, the route changes names to Taconic Trail as it meanders southeastward through rural, mostly wooded sections of Petersburgh. NY 2 intersects both ends of CR 91 (East Hollow Road) before traversing dense woods in the Berkshire Mountains. The road takes a generally south-southeastward track to the Massachusetts state line, where it becomes Massachusetts Route 2 upon entering the town of Williamstown, Massachusetts.

==History==
Most of modern NY 2 east of 1st Street in Troy was originally designated by the New York State Legislature as Route 42, an unsigned legislative route, on July 7, 1911. East of Troy, however, Route 42 was routed on Pawling and Pinewoods avenues. Route 42 was extended west across the Hudson River to Schenectady in 1914 by way of what is now NY 2 and NY 7. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of Route 42 west of 1st Street became part of NY 9. The rest of Route 42 remained unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, when it was designated as NY 96. Near Troy, NY 96 bypassed Pawling and Pinewoods avenues to the north on Brunswick Road instead of following the path of Route 42.

In Petersburgh, NY 96 originally had a brief overlap with NY 22; however, it was eliminated in 1931 when NY 96 was reconfigured to pass over NY 22 by way of a new bridge built midway between NY 96&#x27;s original approaches to the route. The former alignments of NY 96 were subsequently repurposed as connectors between NY 22 and NY 96. Both roads, a combined in length, are now designated as NY 914A, an unsigned reference route. In 1942, the state of New York switched the alignments of NY 96 and NY 2, a highway extending from Owego to Rochester in the Finger Lakes region. The change placed NY 2 on the Troy–Massachusetts routing.

Around the same time as the designation swap, NY 2 was extended south to NY 5 in Albany by way of overlaps with US 4, then routed on 1st Street, and NY 32. In between the two routes, NY 2 was routed on modern NY 378 and crossed the Hudson River by way of the Troy–Menands Bridge. NY 2 was rerouted slightly in the early 1950s to leave NY 32 at the junction of Wolfert Avenue and Broadway and follow Broadway into downtown Albany, where it ended at Madison Avenue (US 9 and US 20). The route was truncated to the northern end of the NY 32 overlap in the mid-1960s, then to 3rd Street (US 4) in Troy on January 1, 1970. The former routing of NY 2 between NY 32 and US 4 became an extension of NY 378.

Construction on a new limited-access highway through the town of Colonie between I-87 and I-787 began in the early 1980s. The roadway, known as &quot;NY 7 Alternate&quot;, was built north of NY 7 on an alignment that paralleled the original surface route. However, when it opened in December 1985, it became a realignment of NY 7 instead. NY 7&#x27;s former surface routing from I-87 in Latham to US 4 in Troy became a westward extension of NY 2.

<doc id="675182" wikidata="Q117067484" url="?curid=675182" title="Nalgene">
<text>Nalgene is a brand of plastic products developed originally for laboratory use, including items such as jars, bottles, test tubes, and Petri dishes, that were shatterproof and lighter than glass. The properties of plastic products make them suitable for work with many substances in various temperature ranges.

Nalgene products are manufactured by Nalge Nunc International, which in 2004 became a subsidiary of Fisher Scientific, now Thermo Fisher Scientific. The name &quot;Nalgene&quot; is a registered trademark.

==Nalgene Outdoor==

In the 1970s, conservationists began discouraging the disposal of cans and glass bottles by burning and burial in wilderness and recreation areas, and some places began forbidding such materials by regulation. Nalgene products became popular replacements among backpackers for storing consumables; the light, wide-mouthed high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and polycarbonate bottles were more secure than plastic bags and were used for both liquids and solid foods.

Originally, wilderness travelers purchased Nalgene products from laboratory-equipment suppliers, or perhaps gained access to them in their workplaces. Company lore has it that Nalge Company president Marsh Hyman, based in Rochester, NY, discovered that his son&#x27;s Boy Scout troop was using Nalgene laboratory containers when camping. Since then, the company has re-packaged and marketed items for consumer sales through their line of Nalgene Outdoor products. By the late 1990s, the &quot;Nalgene&quot; trademark was recognized by many hikers, and sales of the 1-litre wide-mouth bottle of translucent polycarbonate (originally typically grey, but now commonly in bright colors, often with custom labels made for the bottle retailer) with a screw-on plastic top that stays attached when the bottle is open, began to increase. Today, many hikers and others recognize the distinctive appearance of Nalgene-branded bottles. Its laboratory pedigree is still suggested by the markings, in hundreds of millilitres, of the volume contained. The materials resist stains and odor absorption, and can be filled with boiling water. The wide-mouth bottle is more widely used and sold over the narrow-mouth bottles in sub-freezing conditions, since it is easier to break through ice with the wider mouth. Currently, Nalgene markets over twelve different sizes of bottles in many colours, including the classic Wide Mouth and Narrow Mouth.
A variety of products from other manufacturers are designed for compatibility with this item&#x27;s overall dimensions or its 2.5-inch neck; these include:
* Screw-on water-purifying filters.
* Stainless-steel collapsible-handle cups, for drinking and/or stove-top cooking, that store compactly with a Nalgene litre-bottle nested inside them.
* Insulated Nylon-fabric cases for Nalgene 1-litre bottles; features include stable attachment points and, in most cases, nesting for a cup.
* Snap-in plastic &quot;splash guards&quot; that narrow the neck opening to a size where drinking while in motion is less likely to cause spilling.
* Screw-in filters, which allow the user to add coffee grounds or tea, pour boiling water over the contents, seal the lid, and brew the beverage.
* Screw-on LED lights, creating a usable lantern with low power consumption.

Another widely available Nalgene Outdoor product is a 650 ml (22 fl oz) &quot;All-Terrain&quot; or &quot;bike&quot; bottle. The bottle is made from low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and its screw top has two moving parts—a drinking nozzle that seals until snapped open by pulling on it, and a hinged polycarbonate dome, that when closed both snaps the nozzle closed and protects the nozzle against contamination. Unlike traditional Nalgene containers, this item can be damaged and potentially ruined by filling it with very hot water.

Recently, Nalgene has added hydration systems to its cycling and wilderness product line. The line features 1- to 3-litre bladders with hose-and-bite-valve assemblies in small back-carried packs (mostly under 1000 cubic inches, or 16 L, of additional storage). Nalgene offers the option of two different bladder materials for a choice of superior taste and bacteria resistance versus improved durability. In addition, the bladder on these products can be quickly detached from the hose and pack by a self-sealing connector on the bladder. These features were intended to improve on perceived issues with existing hydration systems, including difficulty filling and/or leaking water into gear that shares the pack.

Increased awareness of the importance of hydration while exercising has led to the appearance of some Nalgene containers in urban and suburban settings like gyms, offices, and campuses. Many colleges give or sell Nalgene water bottles to their students, and Nalgene bottles are also customized and sold as retail promotions.

In October 2017, Nalgene launched a new line of colors for their water bottles.

==Bisphenol A (BPA) concerns==
In recent years, studies have suggested that polycarbonates, made from bisphenol A (BPA) and phosgene (), such as the ones Nalgene used, may leach endocrine disruptors including BPA. Nalgene denies that the quantity leached from their products posed a significant threat to health. Among the secreted chemicals, BPA is a concern, as it binds to estrogen receptors, thus altering gene expression. Other research has found that fixatives in polycarbonate plastics can cause chromosomal error in cell division called aneuploidy. Nalgene claims these chemicals are only potentially released from Nalgene products when used at temperatures outside of the designed range.

In November 2007, the national Canadian co-operative retailer Mountain Equipment Co-op removed all hard, clear polycarbonate plastic water bottles (including Nalgene-branded products) from their shelves and replaced them with BPA-free Nalgene bottles. In December 2007, Lululemon made a similar move. In May 2008, Recreational Equipment, Inc. removed Nalgene-branded polycarbonate water bottles and replaced them with BPA-free Nalgene bottles.

On April 18, 2008, Health Canada announced that bisphenol A is &quot;&#x27;toxic&#x27; to human health&quot;. On the same date, Nalgene announced it would phase out production of its Outdoor line of polycarbonate containers containing BPA. Nalgene subsequently adopted Tritan copolyester, a BPA-free copolyester made by Eastman Chemical, as a substitute.

Although unpublished studies in 2008 and 2009 by Oregon State students suggest that BPA does not leach from polycarbonate plastic under extreme conditions, BPA is not the only component of plastics which can mimic estrogen and act as an endocrine disruptor. Unfortunately, BPA-free Tritan plastics were later found to leach other estrogenic chemicals in a cell-based assay. Eastman Chemical, the manufacturer of Tritan, will not disclose precise information about the chemical structure of Tritan.

A study from CertiChem (a private lab in Austin, Texas dedicated to studying endocrine disruption) found that green-colored Nalgene bottles effectively block the effects of UV rays, thus rendering the specific model studied safe from specific BPA-leaching concerns. However, CertiChem&#x27;s founder and neuroscience professor at the University of Texas at Austin, George Bittner, cautioned that green Nalgene bottles found in stores &quot;aren&#x27;t guaranteed to be safe since minor change to the chemical formula can introduce estrogens&quot;. Bittner also published an article claiming most polymers, including Tritan, contained trace amounts of Bisphenol A. Eastman Chemical Company filed a lawsuit after these results were publicized in a brochure produced by PlastiPure, a sister company to CertiChem. Eastman maintained that the tests used by CertiChem, which were based around cultured estrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells, were not a definitive assay of endocrine activity &quot;in vivo&quot;. A jury ruled in Eastman&#x27;s favor, and as a result Bittner, PlastiPure, and CertiChem were barred from making claims about Tritan’s oestrogenic activity.

<doc id="675192" wikidata="Q1150924" url="?curid=675192" title="Sloped armour">
<text>Sloped armour is armour that is oriented neither vertically nor horizontally. Such angled armour is typically mounted on tanks and other armoured fighting vehicles (AFVs), as well as naval vessels such as battleships and cruisers. Sloping an armour plate makes it more difficult to penetrate by anti-tank weapons, such as armour-piercing shells, kinetic energy penetrators and rockets, if they follow a more or less horizontal trajectory to their target, as is often the case. The improved protection is caused by three main effects.

Firstly, a projectile hitting a plate at an angle other than 90° has to move through a greater thickness of armour, compared to hitting the same plate at a right-angle. In the latter case only the plate thickness (the normal to the surface of the armour) must be pierced. Increasing the armour slope improves, for a given plate thickness, the level of protection at the point of impact by increasing the thickness measured in the horizontal plane, the angle of attack of the projectile. The protection of an area, instead of just a single point, is indicated by the average horizontal thickness, which is identical to the area density (in this case relative to the horizontal): the relative armour mass used to protect that area.

If the horizontal thickness is increased by increasing the slope while keeping the plate thickness constant, a longer and thus heavier armour plate is required to protect a certain area. This improvement in protection is simply equivalent to the increase of area density and thus mass, and can offer no weight benefit. Therefore, in armoured vehicle design the two other main effects of sloping have been the motive to apply sloped armour.

One of these is the more efficient envelopment of a certain vehicle volume by armour. In general, more rounded shapes have a smaller surface area relative to their volume. In an armoured vehicle that surface must be covered by heavy armour, so a more efficient shape leads to either a substantial weight reduction or a thicker armour for the same weight. Sloping the armour leads to a better approximation of the ideal rounded shape.

The final effect is that of deflection, deforming and ricochet of a projectile. When it hits a plate under a steep angle, its path might be curved, causing it to move through more armour – or it might bounce off entirely. Also it can be bent, reducing its penetration. Shaped charge warheads may fail to penetrate or even detonate when striking armour at a highly oblique angle. However, these desired effects are critically dependent on the precise armour materials used in relation to the characteristics of the projectile hitting it: sloping might even lead to better penetration.

The sharpest angles are usually designed on the frontal glacis plate, because it is the hull direction most likely to be hit while facing an attack, and also because there is more room to slope in the longitudinal direction of the vehicle.

==Principle==

The cause for the increased protection of a certain point &quot;at a given normal thickness&quot; is the increased line-of-sight (&quot;LOS&quot;) thickness of the armour, which is the thickness along the horizontal plane, along a line describing the oncoming projectile&#x27;s general direction of travel. For a given thickness of armour plate, a projectile must travel through a greater thickness of armour to penetrate into the vehicle when it is sloped.
The mere fact that the LOS-thickness increases by angling the plate is not however the motive for applying sloped armour in armoured vehicle design. The reason for this is that this increase offers no weight benefit. To maintain a given mass of a vehicle, the area density would have to remain equal and this implies that the LOS-thickness would also have to remain constant while the slope increases, which again implies that the normal thickness decreases. In other words: to avoid increasing the weight of the vehicle, plates have to get proportionally thinner while their slope increases, a process equivalent to shearing the mass.

Sloped armour provides increased protection for armoured fighting vehicles through two primary mechanisms. The most important is based on the fact that to attain a certain protection level a certain volume has to be enclosed by a certain mass of armour and that sloping may reduce the surface to volume ratio and thus allow for either a lesser relative mass for a given volume or more protection for a given weight. If attack were equally likely from all directions, the ideal form would be a sphere; because horizontal attack is in fact to be expected the ideal becomes an oblate spheroid. Angling flat plates or curving cast armour allows designers to approach these ideals. For practical reasons this mechanism is most often applied on the front of the vehicle, where there is sufficient room to slope and much of the armour is concentrated, on the assumption that unidirectional frontal attack is the most likely. A simple wedge, such as can be seen in the hull design of the M1 Abrams, is already a good approximation that is often applied.

The second mechanism is that shots hitting sloped armour are more likely to be deflected, ricochet or shatter on impact. Modern weapon and armour technology has significantly reduced this second benefit which initially was the main motive sloped armour was incorporated into vehicle design in the Second World War.

===The cosine rule===

Even though the increased protection to a point, provided by angling a certain armour plate with a given normal thickness causing an increased line-of-sight (&quot;LOS&quot;) thickness, is of no consideration in armour vehicle design, it is of great importance when determining the level of protection of a designed vehicle. The LOS-thickness for a vehicle in a horizontal position can be calculated by a simple formula, applying the cosine rule: it is equal to the armour&#x27;s normal thickness divided by the cosine of the armour&#x27;s inclination from perpendicularity to the projectile&#x27;s travel (assumed to be in the horizontal plane) or:

:formula_1

where
* formula_2: Line of sight thickness
* formula_3: Normal thickness
* formula_4: Angle of the sloped armour plate from the vertical

For example, armour sloped sixty degrees back from the vertical presents to a projectile travelling horizontally a line-of-sight thickness twice the armour&#x27;s normal thickness, as the cosine of 60° is . When armour thickness or rolled homogeneous armour equivalency (RHAe) values for AFVs are provided without the slope of the armour, the figure provided generally takes into account this effect of the slope, while when the value is in the format of &quot;x units at y degrees&quot;, the effects of the slope are not taken into account.

==Deflection==
Sloping armour can increase protection by a mechanism such as shattering of a brittle kinetic energy penetrator (KEP) or a deflection of that penetrator away from the surface normal, even though the area density remains constant. These effects are strongest when the projectile has a low absolute weight and is short relative to its width. Armour piercing shells of World War II, certainly those of the early years, had these qualities and sloped armour was therefore rather efficient in that period. In the sixties however long-rod penetrators, such as armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot rounds, were introduced, projectiles that are both very elongated and very dense in mass. When hitting a sloped thick homogeneous plate, such a long-rod penetrator will, due to the incoming rear of the projectile acting as a lever, after initial penetration into the armour&#x27;s LOS thickness, bend toward the armour&#x27;s normal thickness and take a path with a length between the armour&#x27;s LOS and normal thicknesses. Also the deformed penetrator tends to act as a projectile of a very large diameter and this stretches out the remaining armour, causing it to fail more easily. If these latter effects occur strongly – for modern penetrators this is typically the case for a slope between 55° and 65° – better protection would be provided by vertically mounted armour of the same area density. Another development decreasing the importance of the principle of sloped armour has been the introduction of ceramic armour in the 1970s. At any given area density, ceramic armour is also best when mounted more vertically, as maintaining the same area density requires the armour be thinned as it is sloped and the ceramic fractures earlier because of its reduced normal thickness.

Sloped armour can also cause projectiles to ricochet, but this phenomenon is much more complicated and as yet not fully predictable. High rod density, impact velocity, and length-to-diameter ratio are factors that contribute to a high critical ricochet angle (the angle at which ricochet is expected to onset) for a long rod projectile, but different formulae may predict different critical ricochet angles for the same situation.

===Basic physical principles of deflection===


The behaviour of a real world projectile, and the armour plate it hits, depends on many effects and mechanisms, involving their material structure and continuum mechanics which are very difficult to predict. Using only a few basic principles will therefore not result in a model that is a good description of the full range of possible outcomes. However, in many conditions most of these factors have only a negligible effect while a few of them dominate the equation. Therefore, a very simplified model can be created providing a general idea and understanding of the basic physical principles behind these aspects of sloped armour design.

If the projectile travels very fast, and thus is in a state of hypervelocity, the strength of the armour material becomes negligible, because the energy of impact causes both projectile and armour to melt and behave like fluids, and only its area density is an important factor. In this limiting case, after the hit, the projectile continues to penetrate until it has stopped transferring its momentum to the target matter. In this ideal case, only momentum, area cross section, density and LOS-thickness are relevant. The situation of the penetrating metal jet caused by the explosion of the shaped charge of high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunition, forms a good approximation of this ideal. Therefore, if the angle is not too extreme, and the projectile is very dense and fast, sloping has little effect and no relevant deflection occurs.

On the other extreme, the more light and slow a projectile is, the more relevant sloping becomes. Typical World War II Armour-Piercing shells were bullet-shaped and had a much lower velocity than a shaped charge jet. An impact would not result in a complete melting of projectile and armour. In this condition the strength of the armour material becomes a relevant factor. If the projectile would be very light and slow, the strength of the armour might even cause the hit to result in just an elastic deformation, the projectile being defeated without damage to the target. Sloping will mean the projectile will have to attain a higher velocity to defeat the armour, because on impact on a sloped armour not all kinetic energy is transferred to the target, the ratio depending on the slope angle. The projectile in a process of elastic collision deflects at an angle of 2formula_5 (where formula_5 denotes the angle between the armour plate surface and the projectile&#x27;s initial direction), however the change of direction could be virtually divided into a deceleration part, when the projectile is halted when moving in a direction perpendicular to the plate (and will move along the plate after having been deflected at an angle of about formula_5), and a process of elastic acceleration, when the projectile accelerates out of the plate (velocity along the plate is considered as invariant because of negligible friction). Thus the maximum energy accumulated by the plate can be calculated from the deceleration phase of the collision event.

Under the assumption that only elastic deformation occurs and that a target is solid, while disregarding friction, it is easy to calculate the proportion of energy absorbed by a target if it is hit by a projectile, which, if also disregarding more complex deflection effects, after impact bounces off (elastic case) or slides along (idealised inelastic case) the armour plate.

In this very simple model the portion of the energy projected to the target depends on the angle of slope:

:formula_8

where
* formula_9: Energy transferred to the target
* formula_10: Incident kinetic energy of projectile
* formula_5: Angle of the sloped armour plate from the projectile&#x27;s initial direction

However, in practice the AP-shells were powerful enough that the forces involved reach the plastic deformation limit and the elasticity of the plate could accumulate only a small part of the energy. In that case the armour plate would yield and much of the energy and force be spent by the deformation. As such this means that approximately half the deflection can be assumed (just formula_5 rather than 2formula_5) and the projectile will groove into the plate before it slides along, rather than bounce off. Plasticity surface friction is also very low in comparison to the plastic deformation energy and can be neglected. This implies that the formula above is principally valid also for the plastic deformation case, but because of the gauge grooved into the plate a larger surface angle formula_5 should be taken into account.

Not only would this imply that the energy transferred to the target would thus be used to damage it; it would also mean that this energy would be higher because the effective angle formula_5 in the formula is now higher than the angle of the armour slope. The value of the appropriate real formula_5&#x27; which should be substituted cannot be derived from this simple principle and can only be determined by a more sophisticated model or simulation.

On the other hand, that very same deformation will also cause, in combination with the armour plate slope, an effect that diminishes armour penetration. Though the deflection is under conditions of plastic deformation smaller, it will nevertheless change the course of the grooving projectile which again will result in an increase of the angle between the new armour surface and the projectile&#x27;s initial direction. Thus the projectile has to work itself through more armour and, though in absolute terms thereby more energy could be absorbed by the target, it is more easily defeated, the process ideally ending in a complete ricochet.

==Historical application==

One of the earliest documented instances of the concept of sloped armour is in the drawing of Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s fighting vehicle. Sloped armour was actually used on nineteenth century early Confederate ironclads, such as CSS Virginia, and partially implemented on the first French tank, the Schneider CA1 in the First World War, but the first tanks to be completely fitted with sloped armour were the French SOMUA S35 and other contemporary French tanks like the Renault R35, which had fully cast hulls and turrets. It was also used to a greater effect on the famous Soviet T-34 battle tank by the Soviet tank design team of the Kharkov Locomotive Factory, led by Mikhail Koshkin. It was a technological response to the more effective anti-tank guns being put into service at this time.

The T-34 had profound impact on German WWII tank design. Pre- or early war designs like the Panzer IV and Tiger I differ clearly from post 1941 vehicles like for example the Panther, Tiger II, Hetzer, Jagdpanzer IV, Jagdpanther and Jagdtiger, which all had sloped armour. This is especially evident because German tank armour was generally not cast but consisted of welded plates.

Sloped armour became very much the fashion after World War II, its most pure expression being perhaps the British Chieftain. 
However, the latest main battle tanks use perforated and composite armour, which attempts to deform and abrade a penetrator rather than deflecting it, as deflecting a long rod penetrator is difficult. These tanks have a more blocky appearance. Examples include the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams. An exception is the Israeli Merkava.

<text>Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve is a U.S. National Monument and National Preserve, consisting of the region around the Aniakchak volcano on the Aleutian Range of south-western Alaska. It has erupted at least 40 times over the last 10,000 years. The monument is one of the least-visited places in the National Park System due to its remote location and difficult weather. The area was proclaimed a National Monument on December 1, 1978, and established as a National Monument and Preserve on December 2, 1980. The National Monument encompasses and the preserve . Visitation to Aniakchak is the lowest of all areas of the U.S. National Park System, according to the NPS, with only 100 documented recreational visits in 2017. Most visitors fly into Surprise Lake inside Aniakchak Crater, but the frequent fog and other adverse weather conditions make landing in the lake difficult. It is also possible to fly into the nearby village of Port Heiden and proceed overland to the Aniakchak Crater.

The core of the national monument lands encompasses the wide Aniakchak Crater. The high point on the caldera rim is Aniakchak Peak. The lake within the caldera, Surprise Lake, is the source of the Aniakchak River. Multiple streams and rivers within the caldera flow into Surprise Lake to form it. In addition to Surprise Lake, the other prominent feature inside the caldera is Vent Mountain, the site of the most recent (1931) eruption within the caldera. The preserve lands flank the monument on either side. Subsistence hunting is allowed in both the monument and preserve, and sport hunting is allowed in the preserve. The region was virtually unexplored until the 1920s, when exploration for oil brought reports of an un-described volcano. A moderate eruption in 1931 forming Vent Mountain resulted in significant publicity, spurring studies to declare the region a national monument. It was not until 1978 that a monument was proclaimed by President Jimmy Carter under the Antiquities Act. The monument and preserve were established within their final boundaries in 1980 with the passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act.

==Description==
Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve is located about southwest of Anchorage, Alaska, on the Alaska Peninsula. It is not accessible by road, except from Port Heiden, a nearby village, and then only to the outer flanks of the caldera. The only ways to reach the monument are by floatplane to lakes, particularly Surprise Lake, or sheltered coastal waters, or by boat or airplane to coastal towns near preserve lands followed by overland or overwater traverse. Notoriously bad weather makes access to Aniakchak unpredictable. Drop-offs and pick-ups may be significantly delayed. There are no permanent facilities in the monument and the NPS does not require visitor registration. Visitor services are provided by the interagency King Salmon Visitor Center in King Salmon, Alaska, shared with Lake Clark National Park, Katmai National Park and Preserve, and other National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service units and Alaska local and state agencies. The monument adjoins the Alaska Peninsula National Wildlife Refuge on its northeast and southwest sides. Monument lands amount to , and preserve lands .

The national monument is centered on the diameter crater of ancient Mount Aniakchak, which was destroyed and the resulting crater formed during a caldera collapse event about 3,700 years ago. The original mountain, about tall, collapsed into its magma chamber, leaving an approximate deep summit crater. (The elevation of the high point on the crater rim, Aniakchak Peak, is approximately 4,380 feet. The elevation of the low point of the caldera floor, at the mouth of Surprise Lake and the beginning of the Aniakchak River, is approximately 1,055 feet.) The monument and surrounding preserve include the volcanic feature, the wild Aniakchak River, the Bristol Bay coastal habitat, and portions of the coast of the Pacific Ocean.

Prominent features within Aniakchak crater include Surprise Lake and the Gates (the cleft in the caldera rim through which the Aniakchak River flows from Surprise lake to the Pacific Ocean) and Vent Mountain.

The Aniakchak River flows 30 miles to Aniakchak Bay on the coast and can be navigated by inflatable raft or kayak. Upper stretches of the river drop as much as 75 feet per mile and narrow to as little as 15 feet. Lower sections widen into meandering oxbows at sections within view of Cape Horn.

===Geology===
The monument and preserve include four major physiographic regions. The monument is centered on the mountains of the Aleutian Range and Aniakchak Crater. The volcano&#x27;s caldera presents an active volcanic and geothermal landscape and Surprise Lake, the source of the Aniakchak River. Extending outward from the mountains are the glacially altered river valleys. The coastline region extends for along the southeastern side of the peninsula where it faces the Pacific Ocean.

The mountain spine of the Aleutian Range consists of uplifted mountains of moderate height, reaching . The mountain environment is predominantly alpine tundra. Superimposed on the mountain chain are a series of volcanoes, the largest of which is the remnant of Mount Aniakchak, now largely collapsed into its caldera, the floor of which lies about above sea level. The caldera was once partly filled by a crater lake that covered about 50% of the crater. The caldera wall was eventually breached, leading to a catastrophic flood as the lake drained. Its remnant is Surprise Lake, the source of the Aniakchak River.

The river valley zones are subdivided into southeastern and northwestern areas. On the southeast side, the rivers fall steeply through volcanic ash deposits where vegetation has largely recolonized the areas devastated by the volcano&#x27;s eruption. On the northwest side, the rivers are more gently sloped and the land is boggy with lush vegetation. The southeast coastal region is deeply indented, with coastal cliffs, headlands and islands. Three large bays are the remnants of earlier volcanic craters. The two larger bays are Aniakchak and Amber Bays, and the smaller is Kejulik Bay. All have cinder-covered beaches between the sea and large freshwater lagoons.

==Ecology==
The Alaska Peninsula climate is cool and wet. Regular Pacific Ocean storms produce estimated annual precipitation exceeding along the coast, with more precipitation probable in the mountains. The weather is typically cloudy and windy, producing low ceilings and rough waters that make both aviation and boating hazardous.

Encompassing coastal and mountain habitats, Aniakchak is home to a wide variety of plants and animals. Large terrestrial animals include caribou, Alaskan moose, brown bears, wolf packs and wolverines. Marine mammals include harbor seals, sea lions and sea otters. The 1931 volcanic eruption at Vent Mountain within the crater disrupted plant communities around the volcano, which are now recovering and which are the subject of scientific research.

==History==
The prehistory of the Aniakchak area is only beginning to come to light as a result of recent archaeological surveys funded by the National Park Service. Present-day native residents consider themselves to be of Aleut ancestry, but linguistic studies indicate that they are related to the similarly named Alutiiq people of Peninsula Yup&#x27;ik ancestry. Currently, there is no evidence to suggest when Alutiiq-speaking people first arrived in the region. Archaeological data reveal that the entire central Alaska Peninsula was occupied, abandoned, and re-colonized numerous times, perhaps in response to recurrent catastrophic volcanism and subsequent processes of ecological succession. Nothing is known of the people who lived in the area prior to the 3,700 BP eruption of the Aniakchak volcano. Because there is ample evidence for human habitation in areas nearby, prior to the caldera-forming eruption, it is unlikely that the Aniakchak region was uninhabited. However, the eruption fundamentally altered the landscape, and likely buried the pre-eruption evidence for human activity under many meters of volcanic debris. Lands nearest the caldera were largely uninhabited for millennia: the Pacific Coast was re-colonized by approximately 2000 years ago while the Meshik River drainage was re-colonized approximately 1700 years ago. The cultural affiliations of these colonists have not yet been determined, however it is likely that different people moved into the area at different times.

Russian exploration of Alaska began in the mid-18th century, with fur traders arriving shortly afterwards to take advantage of the sea otters that populated the coast. Traders and native trappers took sea otters along both sides of the Aleutian peninsula. The first recorded mention of the Aniachak region appears in an 1827 atlas, which notes &quot;Baie Amah-chak&quot; and &quot;Cap Kumlik.&quot; In 1831 the coast was mapped by the Russian Navy and followed up by two more expeditions in the 1840s. The region was mostly avoided through the rest of the 19th century, apart from a few fur trappers who did not prosper.

The development of the salmon fishing industry in Alaska brought a cannery to Chignik Lagoon in 1882, about southwest of the future monument. The industry expanded, building fish traps in Aniakchak Bay by 1917. Other traps followed through 1937, some operating until 1949. The Alaska Packers&#x27; Association built a bunkhouse on Aniakchak Bay in the 1920s to house workers who maintained the trap and harvested fish during the summer months. At the same time, fur trappers arrived, this time to gather furs from inland mammals.

Reports of oil seeps on the peninsula and on the cape between Aniakchak and Amber Bays in the 1920s brought petroleum exploration and claims, some of which described the &quot;Aniakchak Field.&quot; Detailed surveys established that the seeps did not exist, and that much of the region was composed of non-oil-bearing igneous rock, ending speculation. The reports did provoke interest from the U.S. Geological Survey, and in 1922 and 1925 USGS parties surveyed the region. These surveys brought the first detailed accounts of what they described as an &quot;extinct volcano,&quot; of which fragmentary information had only emerged after 1919. However, in 1931 Half Cone, one of the cinder cones in the caldera, erupted throughout May of that year, causing ashfalls at distances up to .

Father Bernard R. Hubbard was a Jesuit priest and professor of geology at Santa Clara University in California, who had been exploring Alaska&#x27;s volcanoes and glaciers every summer season since 1927 and writing about them in best-selling books and in publications such as &quot;National Geographic&quot; and the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Intrigued by the Alaska Peninsula&#x27;s volcanoes, he first visited the Aniakchak region in 1930. Hubbard and four companions arrived at the mouth of the Aniakchak River in June 1930. They used a open motorboat to boat up the river, then explored the caldera, finding fumaroles in the crater. They returned in 1931 in time to document (somewhat inaccurately) the aftermath of the May eruption. In 1932 Hubbard and pilot Frank Dorbrandt flew into the caldera and landed on Surprise Lake. Hubbard&#x27;s dramatically written but mostly accurate descriptions of the region appeared in the &quot;New York Times&quot; and captured popular imaginations, publicizing the Aniakchak region for the first time. Hubbard described the area as a &quot;wonderland&quot;. A follow-up article by Barrett Willoughby in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; entitled &quot;The Moon Craters of Alaska&quot; discussed Hubbard&#x27;s expedition to Aniakchak and nearby Mount Veniaminof in greater detail. National Park Service director Horace M. Albright and his then-assistant Arno B. Cammerer saw the stories and started preparation of documents to proclaim a national monument under the Antiquities Act. After the proposed boundary was altered to exclude regions thought by the USGS to be potential oil sources, the proposed monument was circulated among other federal and territorial agencies for comment. Although there was no particular objection to the monument, there was no strong push for the designation, and the Aniakchak project was shunted aside in favor of a proclamation expanding Katmai National Monument.

In 1932, Aniakchak Bay and the lagoon behind were discovered to have rich beds of razor clams. A cannery was established that year, quickly exhausting the stocks. Over the next decades the region became largely deserted, frequented only by trappers and fishermen. A flurry of renewed interest in oil leases in the 1950s came to nothing. In the 1960s, sport hunters began to frequent the area, focusing primarily on bear and caribou.

===National monument===
Interest in a National Park Service unit at Aniakchak was renewed in the 1960s. In 1964, newly appointed Park Service director George B. Hartzog Jr. initialed a study of Alaskan lands titled &quot;Operation Great Land&quot;. The study recommended protection of Aniakchak. Further studies supported the report&#x27;s recommendations. In the interim, the Aniakchak caldera was designated a national natural landmark in August 1970. In 1971 the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was passed, which established a framework for the disposition of federal lands in Alaska. The process dictated by ANCSA required agencies to &quot;withdraw&quot; lands which they felt they should administer. The Park Service withdrew around Mount Aniakchak in 1973. The same year a Aniakchak Caldera National Recreation Area was proposed, extending to both sides of the peninsula and including Port Heiden on Bristol Bay. Opposition from native groups and the presence of mining claims on some lands forced a scaled-back plan for Aniakchak Caldera National Monument that, at , was close to the present area. At about the same time the Aniakchak River was nominated for the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System.

The proposal for a national recreation area was in part a response to concerns that national monument designation would prohibit sport hunting. An early version of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA), introduced in 1977, addressed the hunting issue by proposing a national monument in the core of the area around the caldera and a national preserve, which would allow sport hunting, in adjacent areas. By late 1978 the bill had become stalled in Congress. With a deadline approaching for the disposition of the lands, President Jimmy Carter was compelled to act.

Aniakchak National Monument was , by Carter using his authority under the Antiquities Act. The monument covered , excluding the area between the caldera and the coast. In 1980 the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) was finally passed, establishing the unit as a national monument surrounded by a larger national preserve that extended to the coast on the south side of the peninsula. The monument allows subsistence hunting by local residents in most areas and the preserve allows both subsistence and sport hunting. Sport hunting and trapping are therefore only permitted in Aniakchak National Preserve. The most common species hunted include moose and brown bear.

In 1989 the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill brought oil contamination to the Aniakchak coast. The spill took place on March 24, but oil did not reach the coast of the preserve until July 2. Roughly two thirds of the of coast were oiled, but not heavily. Cleanup continued from 1989 into 1990.

Aniakchak has the lowest visitor total of any publicly open national park unit in the United States. The number of people actually entering the area is certainly higher, the result of subsistence hunting policies which do not count subsistence hunters, and a few commercial hunting guides hold commercial use permits in the preserve. The National Park Service manages Aniakchak through Katmai National Park and its superintendent.

===Historic structures===

The Aniakchak Bay Historic Landscape District, also known as the Aniakchak Bay House Pits, surrounds the Aniakchak River from Aniakchak Crater to Aniakchak Bay. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The site includes the former Columbia River Packers Association cabin at the mouth of the river and surrounding lands, for a total of 10 contributing properties. Archaeological surveys of the area have turned up evidence of native occupation over the last 2000 years.

<text>Mandalay Pictures (formerly known as Mandalay Entertainment) is an American independent film production company founded on May 27, 1995, which is part of producer and businessman Peter Guber&#x27;s Mandalay Entertainment. From 1997 until 2002, Lions Gate Entertainment owned a stake in Mandalay Pictures before selling it. The company&#x27;s mascot is a tiger.

== History ==
Mandalay Pictures was formed at the same time as the parent company Mandalay Entertainment in 1995 by Peter Guber, who was formerly head of Sony Pictures Entertainment and The Guber-Peters Company. At first, it struck an exclusive film and television deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment, which was releasing its films through the Columbia and TriStar distribution labels.

In 1998, Mandalay Pictures moved over from Sony Pictures to Paramount Pictures. At the same time, Mandalay struck a partnership with Lions Gate Entertainment to acquire the assets of Mandalay Entertainment. The deal did not include the television division, which remained with Columbia TriStar Television. In September 1998, Mandalay signed a distribution deal with Canal+ and Pathé joint-venture C+P to handle distribution of Mandalay&#x27;s films in the United Kingdom, France and Belgium/Luxembourg.

In 2002, the deal was transferred from Paramount Pictures to Universal Pictures, and launched its international sales division. In November 2002, it was separated from Lions Gate Entertainment.

In 2004, Ori Marmur left Mandalay Pictures, and decided to join Original Film. Ironically Original Film is producing the &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; movies for Mandalay Pictures.

In 2007, it launched a division Mandalay Independent Pictures, and it was to focus on making independent pictures. In 2010, it became Mandalay Vision and Matthew Rhodes was appointed president in 2011.

<doc id="675213" wikidata="Q883213" url="?curid=675213" title="Young Guns II">
<text>Young Guns II is a 1990 American Western action film and a sequel to &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988). It stars Emilio Estevez, Kiefer Sutherland, Lou Diamond Phillips, and Christian Slater, and features William Petersen as Pat Garrett. It was written by John Fusco and directed by Geoff Murphy.

It follows the life of Billy the Kid, played by Emilio Estevez, in the years following the Lincoln County War in which Billy was part of &quot;The Regulators&quot; – a group of around six highly skilled gunmen avenging the death of John Tunstall – and the years leading up to Billy&#x27;s documented death. The film is told by Brushy Bill Roberts, a man who in 1950 appeared claiming to be the real Billy the Kid.

While the film takes some creative license, it does show some of the main events leading up to Billy&#x27;s documented death, including his talks with Governor Lew Wallace, his capture by friend-turned-foe Sheriff Pat Garrett, his trial and his subsequent escape in which he killed two deputies.

==Plot==
In 1950, attorney Charles Phalen is contacted by elderly &quot;Brushy Bill&quot; Roberts, who seeks a pardon he was promised 70 years earlier by the governor of the New Mexico Territory. Dismissing Bill&#x27;s claim that he is really William H. Bonney aka &quot;Billy The Kid&quot;, widely believed to have been killed in 1881, Phalen asks if Bill has any proof.

Bill&#x27;s story begins in 1879, as the famed outlaw has formed a new gang with &quot;Arkansas&quot; Dave Rudabaugh and Pat Garrett. In the wake of the Lincoln County War, New Mexico Governor Lew Wallace has issued warrants for the arrest of everyone involved. Billy&#x27;s former compatriot Doc Scurlock, now a schoolteacher in New York, is captured and imprisoned alongside fellow Regulator Jose Chavez y Chavez and their old enemies.

Now the most wanted man in New Mexico, Billy meets with Governor Wallace, who agrees to pardon him if he testifies against the Dolan-Murphy faction. Instead, Billy discovers he has been tricked into being arrested with no chance of testifying. He escapes, returning with Dave and Garrett and posing as a lynch mob to free Doc and Chavez, who reluctantly join them on the &quot;Mexican Blackbird&quot; trail to Mexico. Desperate for reinforcements, the gang accepts farmer Hendry William French and teenage Yankee Tom O&#x27;Folliard, while Garrett decides to stay behind to open a boarding house.

Billy demands a $500 debt from former ally John Chisum, leaving two of the cattle baron&#x27;s men dead. Furious, Chisum joins Wallace and they offer Garrett the job of Lincoln County sheriff and $1000 to hunt Bonney down. Forming a posse, Garrett recruits a journalist to document their pursuit. Billy leaves a taunting message for Garrett, and Rudabaugh tries to dig up an Apache burial ground, resulting in a knife fight with the Mexican-Indian Chavez.

Billy and the gang reach the town of White Oaks, spending the night at a bordello run by his former companion Jane Greathouse. A lynch mob gathers, and Deputy Carlyle offers to let the gang go in exchange for handing over Chavez, but Billy dresses the deputy as Chavez and pushes him outside, where he is shot dead by the mob. Garrett tracks the gang to the bordello and burns it down, while Jane strips naked to humiliate the townsfolk and rides away.

The gang is followed closely by Garrett&#x27;s posse and Tom is shot dead by Garrett, leading Billy to admit that the Mexican Blackbird was only a ruse to keep the gang together. Doc tries to leave for home, but is shot by one of Garrett&#x27;s men and sacrifices himself to enable his friends to escape, though Chavez is wounded and Billy is captured. Brought back to Lincoln, Billy is sentenced to death and is visited by Jane. She leaves him a pistol in the outhouse, which he uses to kill two guards and escape to Fort Sumner.

Billy finds his gang, but Dave has fled for Mexico, and a dying Chavez leaves to meet his fate alone. That night, an unarmed Billy is confronted by Garrett, and asks to be allowed to run to Mexico while Garrett tells the authorities that he killed him. Certain that Billy would not be able to resist coming back to the United States, Garrett refuses, and prepares to shoot Billy in the back. In the morning, a burial is held for Billy, but Garrett&#x27;s horse is taken by an unseen figure.

Back in 1950, Brushy Bill concludes his story, convincing Phalen that he is Billy the Kid. An epilogue reveals that Dave was beheaded in Mexico as a warning to other outlaws; Garrett&#x27;s book was a failure and he was shot and killed in 1908; Brushy Bill met with the governor of New Mexico, but despite corroboration from several surviving friends of the Kid, he was discredited and died less than a month later; whether or not he was Billy the Kid remains a mystery.

==Cast==
Jon Bon Jovi briefly appears in a nonspeaking role as a bandit who attempts escaping during the prison scene.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
Screenwriter-producer John Fusco culled much of Billy&#x27;s dialogue from actual newspaper interviews and reports between 1879 and 1881. Fusco appears as the &quot;Branded Man&quot; in the prison pit escape scene alongside Jon Bon Jovi. The cattle brand on Fusco&#x27;s face reads J.C. for cattle rancher John Chisum.

John Chisum, played by James Coburn, in the film convinces Pat Garrett to accept a job as the new Lincoln County Sheriff. Coburn played Garrett in Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s &quot;Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid&quot; (1973).

===Historical accuracy===
The historical Josiah &quot;Doc&quot; Scurlock lived to the age of 80 and died a respectable man in Eastland, Texas in 1929. The film&#x27;s original screenplay accurately portrays Scurlock as heading to Texas with his bride. It has been reported that Kiefer Sutherland, faced with scheduling conflicts, refused to return to the &quot;Young Guns&quot; franchise unless his character died in the movie&#x27;s Stinking Springs shoot-out. Writer John Fusco fought against this demand, but ultimately rewrote the scene to accommodate Sutherland&#x27;s schedule.

Similarly, José Chavez y Chavez&#x27;s death in the movie is an inaccurate portrayal. The real Chavez y Chavez lived to be an old man and died at the age of 72 in 1924. In both &quot;Young Guns&quot; and &quot;Young Guns II&quot;, he fights mainly with knives, but historical records show that he was as skilled a gunman as the others.

Although Tom O&#x27;Folliard was shot by Pat Garrett, he was not from Pennsylvania, and nor was he a young boy. He was played by a 14-year-old Balthazar Getty in the film, but in real life he was 20–21 years old when he died.

==Music==
===Soundtrack===
Emilio Estevez originally approached Jon Bon Jovi to ask him for permission to include the song &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; on the soundtrack. Bon Jovi didn&#x27;t feel the song&#x27;s lyrics were appropriate; however, he was inspired by the project and resolved to write a new song for the film that would be more in keeping with the period and setting. He quickly wrote the song &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, and performed it on acoustic guitar in the Utah desert for Estevez and John Fusco.

&quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; went on to reach No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Jon Bon Jovi named his debut solo album &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, released as &quot;Young Guns II: Blaze Of Glory&quot; in the UK, which included the eponymous single as well as other songs from and inspired by the film.

The album peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart.

Jon Bon Jovi made a cameo appearance in the film, as one of the prisoners in the pit with Doc and Chavez (he can be seen 28 minutes and 8 seconds into the movie).

===Score===
The film&#x27;s original score was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri, who provided string arrangements for the song &quot;Santa Fe&quot; and has one brief track on &quot;Blaze Of Glory&quot;. In September 2011 Intrada Records issued Silvestri&#x27;s score on its own CD.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Young Guns II&quot; opened on August 1, 1990, in the United States in 1,770 theaters, accumulating $8,017,438 over its opening weekend. It finished third for the weekend, behind &quot;Ghost&quot; (in its fourth week), and &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; (in its second week). The film grossed $44,143,410 in the United States and Canada. Internationally it grossed $15 million for a worldwide total of $59 million. The film was also successful on video rental.

===Critical response===
&quot;Young Guns II&quot; received mostly negative reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has received a 31% approval rating by critics based on 26 reviews. Metacritic gave the film a score of 47 out of 100, based on 18 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A-&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said: “Full of sound, gunfire, fury and scorchingly beautiful landscapes, &quot;Young Guns II&quot; generates more sheer visual excitement than any Western since Peckinpah and Leone were in their last &#x27;70s prime.&quot; Roger Ebert, who gave &quot;Young Guns II&quot; two stars out of four, stated that &quot;the screenplay feels unfinished, the direction is ambling, but the performances are interesting.&quot; Chris Hicks from &quot;Deseret News&quot; gave the film two out of four stars, stating that &quot;Young Guns II&quot; was &quot;sumptuously shot, very well-acted and full of potential.&quot;

===Accolades===
==Sequel==
In January 2021, a sequel was teased by screenwriter John Fusco who shared a mock poster for &quot;Young Guns 3: Alias Billy the Kid&quot;. In March, Estevez told &quot;Collider&quot; people were interested in seeing him play the character again and that a third film is &quot;definitely in the works.&quot;
In September 2021, more information came out about the sequel, including that Lou Diamond Phillips and Christian Slater would return to the franchise.

His breakthrough came when he starred as Ritchie Valens in the biographical drama film &quot;La Bamba&quot; (1987). For his performance as Angel David Guzman in &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; (1988), he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture and won an Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male.

Phillips made his Broadway debut with the 1996 revival of &quot;The King and I&quot;, earning a Tony Award nomination for his portrayal of King Mongkut of Siam. Phillips&#x27; other notable films include &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988), &quot;Young Guns II&quot; (1990), &quot;Courage Under Fire&quot; (1996), &quot;The Big Hit&quot; (1998), &quot;Brokedown Palace&quot; (1999), &quot;Che&quot; (2008), and &quot;The 33&quot; (2015). 

In the television series &quot;Longmire&quot;, he played a main character named Henry Standing Bear. He played New York City Police Lieutenant Gil Arroyo on &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; on FOX from 2019 to 2021.

==Early life==
Born Louis Diamond Upchurch on February 17, 1962, at the U.S. Naval Bay Subic Base in the Philippines, he is the son of Lucita Umayam Aranas and Gerald Amon Upchurch (1935–1963), a Marine KC-130 crew chief. His mother was Filipino, while his father was an American of Scots-Irish and Cherokee descent. Phillips has said &quot;I never claimed to be a Native actor, but I do have Native blood.&quot;

Phillips was named after US Marine Lou Diamond. 

Phillips&#x27;s father died when he was only a year old, after which his mother remarried and adopted the Phillips surname.

Phillips was raised in Texas. He graduated from Flour Bluff High School in Corpus Christi in 1980 and from the University of Texas at Arlington with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Drama.

==Career==
===1980s===
Phillips&#x27;s big break came with the starring role in &quot;La Bamba&quot; (1987) in which he played early rocker Ritchie Valens. Prior to his cinematic breakthrough, he starred in the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; episode &quot;Red Tape&quot; (March 13, 1987), portraying detective Bobby Diaz.

In 1988, Phillips co-starred with Edward James Olmos in the inner-city high school drama &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;, in a role for which he won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture. He plays Angel David Guzman, a &quot;cholo&quot; &quot;gangster&quot; who is inspired by his math teacher, Jaime Escalante, to excel at calculus. Working to master the subject, he develops a friendship with his teacher. &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot; was filmed before &quot;La Bamba&quot;, but it was released a year later.

In 1988 Phillips co-starred with Emilio Estevez and Kiefer Sutherland in the Western film &quot;Young Guns,&quot; in which he plays José Chávez y Chávez, a historical Old West outlaw.

He played the would-be commander of the &quot;Destiny&quot; expedition, who is left behind when an accident launches an unsuspecting crew into deep space. The commander works from Earth to bring the crew home, often coming into conflict with the shipborne command characters.

===2010s===
Phillips hosted the weekly series &quot;An Officer and a Movie&quot; (2011–2013) on American Heroes Channel.

Phillips played Henry Standing Bear, a Native American, who is a longtime friend of Longmire and has a saloon/restaurant.

In December 2006, he pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor count of disturbing the peace and was sentenced to three years of probation.

On November 3, 2017, Phillips was arrested in Portland, Texas, for DWI after stopping his vehicle to ask a police officer for directions. He was charged with reckless driving.

<doc id="675231" wikidata="Q1378376" url="?curid=675231" title="Line graph">
<text>In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the line graph of an undirected graph is another graph that represents the adjacencies between edges of . is constructed in the following way: for each edge in , make a vertex in ; for every two edges in that have a vertex in common, make an edge between their corresponding vertices in .

The name &quot;line graph&quot; comes from a paper by although both and used the construction before this. Other terms used for the line graph include the covering graph, the derivative, the edge-to-vertex dual, the conjugate, the representative graph, and the θ-obrazom, as well as the edge graph, the interchange graph, the adjoint graph, and the derived graph.

 proved that with one exceptional case the structure of a connected graph can be recovered completely from its line graph. Many other properties of line graphs follow by translating the properties of the underlying graph from vertices into edges, and by Whitney&#x27;s theorem the same translation can also be done in the other direction. Line graphs are claw-free, and the line graphs of bipartite graphs are perfect. Line graphs are characterized by nine forbidden subgraphs and can be recognized in linear time.

Various extensions of the concept of a line graph have been studied, including line graphs of line graphs, line graphs of multigraphs, line graphs of hypergraphs, and line graphs of weighted graphs.

==Formal definition==
Given a graph , its line graph is a graph such that
* each vertex of represents an edge of ; and
* two vertices of are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges share a common endpoint (&quot;are incident&quot;) in .
That is, it is the intersection graph of the edges of , representing each edge by the set of its two endpoints.

== Example ==

The following figures show a graph (left, with blue vertices) and its line graph (right, with green vertices). Each vertex of the line graph is shown labeled with the pair of endpoints of the corresponding edge in the original graph. For instance, the green vertex on the right labeled 1,3 corresponds to the edge on the left between the blue vertices 1 and 3. Green vertex 1,3 is adjacent to three other green vertices: 1,4 and 1,2 (corresponding to edges sharing the endpoint 1 in the blue graph) and 4,3 (corresponding to an edge sharing the endpoint 3 in the blue graph).

== Properties ==

===Translated properties of the underlying graph===
Properties of a graph that depend only on adjacency between edges may be translated into equivalent properties in that depend on adjacency between vertices. For instance, a matching in is a set of edges no two of which are adjacent, and corresponds to a set of vertices in no two of which are adjacent, that is, an independent set.

Thus,
* The line graph of a connected graph is connected. If is connected, it contains a path connecting any two of its edges, which translates into a path in containing any two of the vertices of . However, a graph that has some isolated vertices, and is therefore disconnected, may nevertheless have a connected line graph.
* A line graph has an articulation point if and only if the underlying graph has a bridge for which neither endpoint has degree one.
* For a graph with vertices and edges, the number of vertices of the line graph is , and the number of edges of is half the sum of the squares of the degrees of the vertices in , minus .
* An independent set in corresponds to a matching in . In particular, a maximum independent set in corresponds to maximum matching in . Since maximum matchings may be found in polynomial time, so may the maximum independent sets of line graphs, despite the hardness of the maximum independent set problem for more general families of graphs. Similarly, a rainbow-independent set in corresponds to a rainbow matching in .
* The edge chromatic number of a graph is equal to the vertex chromatic number of its line graph .
* The line graph of an edge-transitive graph is vertex-transitive. This property can be used to generate families of graphs that (like the Petersen graph) are vertex-transitive but are not Cayley graphs: if is an edge-transitive graph that has at least five vertices, is not bipartite, and has odd vertex degrees, then is a vertex-transitive non-Cayley graph.
* If a graph has an Euler cycle, that is, if is connected and has an even number of edges at each vertex, then the line graph of is Hamiltonian. However, not all Hamiltonian cycles in line graphs come from Euler cycles in this way; for instance, the line graph of a Hamiltonian graph is itself Hamiltonian, regardless of whether is also Eulerian.
* If two simple graphs are isomorphic then their line graphs are also isomorphic. The Whitney graph isomorphism theorem provides a converse to this for all but one pair of connected graphs.
* In the context of complex network theory, the line graph of a random network preserves many of the properties of the network such as the small-world property (the existence of short paths between all pairs of vertices) and the shape of its degree distribution. observe that any method for finding vertex clusters in a complex network can be applied to the line graph and used to cluster its edges instead.

===Whitney isomorphism theorem===

If the line graphs of two connected graphs are isomorphic, then the underlying graphs are isomorphic, except in the case of the triangle graph and the claw , which have isomorphic line graphs but are not themselves isomorphic.

As well as and , there are some other exceptional small graphs with the property that their line graph has a higher degree of symmetry than the graph itself. For instance, the diamond graph (two triangles sharing an edge) has four graph automorphisms but its line graph has eight. In the illustration of the diamond graph shown, rotating the graph by 90 degrees is not a symmetry of the graph, but is a symmetry of its line graph. However, all such exceptional cases have at most four vertices. A strengthened version of the Whitney isomorphism theorem states that, for connected graphs with more than four vertices, there is a one-to-one correspondence between isomorphisms of the graphs and isomorphisms of their line graphs.

Analogues of the Whitney isomorphism theorem have been proven for the line graphs of multigraphs, but are more complicated in this case.

===Strongly regular and perfect line graphs===

The line graph of the complete graph is also known as the triangular graph, the Johnson graph , or the complement of the Kneser graph . Triangular graphs are characterized by their spectra, except for . They may also be characterized (again with the exception of ) as the strongly regular graphs with parameters . The three strongly regular graphs with the same parameters and spectrum as are the Chang graphs, which may be obtained by graph switching from .

The line graph of a bipartite graph is perfect (see Kőnig&#x27;s theorem), but need not be bipartite as the example of the claw graph shows. The line graphs of bipartite graphs form one of the key building blocks of perfect graphs, used in the proof of the strong perfect graph theorem. A special case of these graphs are the rook&#x27;s graphs, line graphs of complete bipartite graphs. Like the line graphs of complete graphs, they can be characterized with one exception by their numbers of vertices, numbers of edges, and number of shared neighbors for adjacent and non-adjacent points. The one exceptional case is , which shares its parameters with the Shrikhande graph. When both sides of the bipartition have the same number of vertices, these graphs are again strongly regular. It has been shown that, except for , , and , all connected strongly regular graphs can be made non-strongly regular within two line graph transformations. The extension to disconnected graphs would require that the graph is not a disjoint union of .

More generally, a graph is said to be a line perfect graph if is a perfect graph. The line perfect graphs are exactly the graphs that do not contain a simple cycle of odd length greater than three. Equivalently, a graph is line perfect if and only if each of its biconnected components is either bipartite or of the form (the tetrahedron) or (a book of one or more triangles all sharing a common edge). Every line perfect graph is itself perfect.

===Other related graph families===
All line graphs are claw-free graphs, graphs without an induced subgraph in the form of a three-leaf tree. As with claw-free graphs more generally, every connected line graph with an even number of edges has a perfect matching; equivalently, this means that if the underlying graph has an even number of edges, its edges can be partitioned into two-edge paths.

The line graphs of trees are exactly the claw-free block graphs. These graphs have been used to solve a problem in extremal graph theory, of constructing a graph with a given number of edges and vertices whose largest tree induced as a subgraph is as small as possible.

All eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of a line graph are at least −2. The reason for this is that can be written as formula_1, where is the signless incidence matrix of the pre-line graph and is the identity. In particular, is the Gramian matrix of a system of vectors: all graphs with this property have been called generalized line graphs.

== Characterization and recognition ==

===Clique partition===

For an arbitrary graph , and an arbitrary vertex in , the set of edges incident to corresponds to a clique in the line graph . The cliques formed in this way partition the edges of . Each vertex of belongs to exactly two of them (the two cliques corresponding to the two endpoints of the corresponding edge in ).

The existence of such a partition into cliques can be used to characterize the line graphs: A graph is the line graph of some other graph or multigraph if and only if it is possible to find a collection of cliques in (allowing some of the cliques to be single vertices) that partition the edges of , such that each vertex of belongs to exactly two of the cliques. It is the line graph of a graph (rather than a multigraph) if this set of cliques satisfies the additional condition that no two vertices of are both in the same two cliques. Given such a family of cliques, the underlying graph for which is the line graph can be recovered by making one vertex in for each clique, and an edge in for each vertex in with its endpoints being the two cliques containing the vertex in . By the strong version of Whitney&#x27;s isomorphism theorem, if the underlying graph has more than four vertices, there can be only one partition of this type.

For example, this characterization can be used to show that the following graph is not a line graph:
In this example, the edges going upward, to the left, and to the right from the central degree-four vertex do not have any cliques in common. Therefore, any partition of the graph&#x27;s edges into cliques would have to have at least one clique for each of these three edges, and these three cliques would all intersect in that central vertex, violating the requirement that each vertex appear in exactly two cliques. Thus, the graph shown is not a line graph.

===Forbidden subgraphs===

Another characterization of line graphs was proven in (and reported earlier without proof by ). He showed that there are nine minimal graphs that are not line graphs, such that any graph that is not a line graph has one of these nine graphs as an induced subgraph. That is, a graph is a line graph if and only if no subset of its vertices induces one of these nine graphs. In the example above, the four topmost vertices induce a claw (that is, a complete bipartite graph ), shown on the top left of the illustration of forbidden subgraphs. Therefore, by Beineke&#x27;s characterization, this example cannot be a line graph. For graphs with minimum degree at least 5, only the six subgraphs in the left and right columns of the figure are needed in the characterization.

===Algorithms===
 and described linear time algorithms for recognizing line graphs and reconstructing their original graphs. generalized these methods to directed graphs. described an efficient data structure for maintaining a dynamic graph, subject to vertex insertions and deletions, and maintaining a representation of the input as a line graph (when it exists) in time proportional to the number of changed edges at each step.

The algorithms of and are based on characterizations of line graphs involving odd triangles (triangles in the line graph with the property that there exists another vertex adjacent to an odd number of triangle vertices). However, the algorithm of uses only Whitney&#x27;s isomorphism theorem. It is complicated by the need to recognize deletions that cause the remaining graph to become a line graph, but when specialized to the static recognition problem only insertions need to be performed, and the algorithm performs the following steps:
*Construct the input graph by adding vertices one at a time, at each step choosing a vertex to add that is adjacent to at least one previously-added vertex. While adding vertices to , maintain a graph for which ; if the algorithm ever fails to find an appropriate graph , then the input is not a line graph and the algorithm terminates.
*When adding a vertex to a graph for which has four or fewer vertices, it might be the case that the line graph representation is not unique. But in this case, the augmented graph is small enough that a representation of it as a line graph can be found by a brute force search in constant time.
*When adding a vertex to a larger graph that equals the line graph of another graph , let be the subgraph of formed by the edges that correspond to the neighbors of in . Check that has a vertex cover consisting of one vertex or two non-adjacent vertices. If there are two vertices in the cover, augment by adding an edge (corresponding to ) that connects these two vertices. If there is only one vertex in the cover, then add a new vertex to , adjacent to this vertex.
Each step either takes constant time, or involves finding a vertex cover of constant size within a graph whose size is proportional to the number of neighbors of . Thus, the total time for the whole algorithm is proportional to the sum of the numbers of neighbors of all vertices, which (by the handshaking lemma) is proportional to the number of input edges.

==Iterating the line graph operator==
 consider the sequence of graphs
:formula_2
They show that, when is a finite connected graph, only four behaviors are possible for this sequence:
*If is a cycle graph then and each subsequent graph in this sequence are isomorphic to itself. These are the only connected graphs for which is isomorphic to .
*If is a claw , then and all subsequent graphs in the sequence are triangles.
*If is a path graph then each subsequent graph in the sequence is a shorter path until eventually the sequence terminates with an empty graph.
*In all remaining cases, the sizes of the graphs in this sequence eventually increase without bound.
If is not connected, this classification applies separately to each component of .

For connected graphs that are not paths, all sufficiently high numbers of iteration of the line graph operation produce graphs that are Hamiltonian.

== Generalizations ==

=== Medial graphs and convex polyhedra ===

When a planar graph has maximum vertex degree three, its line graph is planar, and every planar embedding of can be extended to an embedding of . However, there exist planar graphs with higher degree whose line graphs are nonplanar. These include, for example, the 5-star , the gem graph formed by adding two non-crossing diagonals within a regular pentagon, and all convex polyhedra with a vertex of degree four or more.

An alternative construction, the medial graph, coincides with the line graph for planar graphs with maximum degree three, but is always planar. It has the same vertices as the line graph, but potentially fewer edges: two vertices of the medial graph are adjacent if and only if the corresponding two edges are consecutive on some face of the planar embedding. The medial graph of the dual graph of a plane graph is the same as the medial graph of the original plane graph.

For regular polyhedra or simple polyhedra, the medial graph operation can be represented geometrically by the operation of cutting off each vertex of the polyhedron by a plane through the midpoints of all its incident edges. This operation is known variously as the second truncation, degenerate truncation, or rectification.

===Total graphs===
The total graph of a graph has as its vertices the elements (vertices or edges) of , and has an edge between two elements whenever they are either incident or adjacent. The total graph may also be obtained by subdividing each edge of and then taking the square of the subdivided graph.

===Multigraphs===
The concept of the line graph of may naturally be extended to the case where is a multigraph. In this case, the characterizations of these graphs can be simplified: the characterization in terms of clique partitions no longer needs to prevent two vertices from belonging to the same to cliques, and the characterization by forbidden graphs has seven forbidden graphs instead of nine.

However, for multigraphs, there are larger numbers of pairs of non-isomorphic graphs that have the same line graphs. For instance a complete bipartite graph has the same line graph as the dipole graph and Shannon multigraph with the same number of edges. Nevertheless, analogues to Whitney&#x27;s isomorphism theorem can still be derived in this case.

===Line digraphs===

It is also possible to generalize line graphs to directed graphs. If is a directed graph, its directed line graph or line digraph has one vertex for each edge of . Two vertices representing directed edges from to and from to in are connected by an edge from to in the line digraph when . That is, each edge in the line digraph of represents a length-two directed path in . The de Bruijn graphs may be formed by repeating this process of forming directed line graphs, starting from a complete directed graph.

===Weighted line graphs===
In a line graph , each vertex of degree in the original graph creates edges in the line graph. For many types of analysis this means high-degree nodes in are over-represented in the line graph . For instance, consider a random walk on the vertices of the original graph . This will pass along some edge with some frequency . On the other hand, this edge is mapped to a unique vertex, say , in the line graph . If we now perform the same type of random walk on the vertices of the line graph, the frequency with which is visited can be completely different from &quot;f&quot;. If our edge in was connected to nodes of degree , it will be traversed more frequently in the line graph . Put another way, the Whitney graph isomorphism theorem guarantees that the line graph almost always encodes the topology of the original graph faithfully but it does not guarantee that dynamics on these two graphs have a simple relationship. One solution is to construct a weighted line graph, that is, a line graph with weighted edges. There are several natural ways to do this. For instance if edges and in the graph are incident at a vertex with degree , then in the line graph the edge connecting the two vertices and can be given weight . In this way every edge in (provided neither end is connected to a vertex of degree 1) will have strength 2 in the line graph corresponding to the two ends that the edge has in . It is straightforward to extend this definition of a weighted line graph to cases where the original graph was directed or even weighted. The principle in all cases is to ensure the line graph reflects the dynamics as well as the topology of the original graph .

===Line graphs of hypergraphs===

The edges of a hypergraph may form an arbitrary family of sets, so the line graph of a hypergraph is the same as the intersection graph of the sets from the family.

=== Disjointness graph ===
The disjointness graph of , denoted , is constructed in the following way: for each edge in , make a vertex in ; for every two edges in that do &quot;not&quot; have a vertex in common, make an edge between their corresponding vertices in . In other words, is the complement graph of . A clique in corresponds to an independent set in , and vice versa.

<text>Piano Magic was a musical collective formed in the summer of 1996 by Glen Johnson, Dominic Chennell, and Dick Rance in London, England. Their sound has been described as ambient pop, post-rock, indietronica, dark wave, &quot;arty baroque pop&quot; and &quot;English radiophonic soundscapers&quot;. While later releases saw them operating in a traditional band format, they originally intended to base their recordings around their small nucleus and whoever else would like to contribute. Glen Johnson was the only remaining member from the original trio when the group disbanded in 2017.

==History==

===Formation and early years: 1996–1998===
Piano Magic was formed in the summer of 1996 by Glen Johnson, Dominic Chennell, and Dick Rance in London, as a &#x27;bedroom-studio&#x27; project with the intention to base their recordings around their small nucleus and whoever else would like to contribute.

Originally reluctant to perform live, they gave way to label pressure when their first single proved popular on the BBC Radio 1 John Peel show and was awarded Single of the Week in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. While recruiting Paul Tornbohm to play drums at these gigs, they pointedly refused to play or sound like any of their released material.

&quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; appeared on I (label)/Ché Trading in 1997, a debut album which the press variously described as &quot;ethereal electro pop atmospheric soundscapes&quot; or &quot;simply delighting in... making silly noises&quot; and which the band thought of as &quot;Small Beat, pre-chip... radiophonics&quot;. It included vocals by Hazel Burfitt and Raechel Leigh but, with Rance having quit the band, combined two previous single releases with a set of new recordings by Johnson and Chennell.

The duo then briefly recruited American music students Alexander Perls, Jen Adam and Ezra Feinberg to complete the band, though Chennell too had departed by the time of the second album release &quot;Low Birth Weight&quot; in 1998, a record described as &quot;dreamy, trance and organic psychedelia&quot;. It introduced the vocals of Caroline Potter, who would sing on one further album.

===Mid-period: 1999–2004===
By 1999 only Johnson remained from the original trio, and the departure of Chennell left him free to lead the band into a much more conventional format and sound. A line-up of Glen Johnson, Miguel Marin, John Cheves and Paul Tornbohm recorded the third album, &quot;Artists&#x27; Rifles&quot;, with John A Rivers (producer of Dead Can Dance and Felt), and showcased its guitar-based sound, &quot;a mixture of chiming guitars and processional rhythms&quot;, at the Benicassim and BAM music festivals. By now, Piano Magic was proving more popular abroad than in their homeland, and the next few years&#x27; activity included mainly European tours.

The band, now minus Cheves, signed to 4AD Records in 2000 and released the soundtrack for Spanish director Bigas Lunas&#x27; film &quot;Son de Mar&quot; in 2001, described as &quot;ethereal, delayed guitar lines... accompanied by various ambient sounds.&quot;

Jerome Tcherneyan then replaced Miguel Marin on drums, and the second and last album with 4AD, &quot;Writers Without Homes&quot; in 2002, was released with mixed press reaction; &quot;exquisite, if a touch diffident.&quot; Its myriad guest artists imported talents from Cocteau Twins, The Czars, Tarwater, Life Without Buildings and Tram. It also featured the first vocal recording for thirty-three years of lost &#x27;60s/&#x27;70s folk heroine Vashti Bunyan.

With the addition of Franck Alba and Alasdair Steer, &quot;The Troubled Sleep of Piano Magic&quot; was released in 2003 on the Green Ufos label, soliciting comparisons with This Mortal Coil and Durutti Column.

===Final period: 2005-2017===
Cédric Pin joined Piano Magic in time for the 2005 album &quot;Disaffected&quot; with a melodic, nearly &quot;pop&quot; sound, featuring more guest vocal contributions from John Grant of The Czars and Angèle David-Guillou of Klima. It appeared to confirm a return to their &#x27;exile&#x27; status, gaining significant attention abroad (including, for example, a full feature in the French daily &quot;Liberation&quot;) but with no coverage in any UK broadsheet or music magazine.

The album &quot;Part Monster&quot; was released in 2007 produced by Guy Fixsen of Laika.

In 2008, Piano Magic moved to Make Mine Music, an artist-run, artist-owned label collective, and released a new EP, &quot;Dark Horses&quot;, the last release to feature Cédric Pin.

In 2009, Piano Magic released their 10th official album, &quot;Ovations&quot;, with contributions by Brendan Perry and Peter Ulrich of Dead Can Dance.

In June 2012, the album &quot;Life Has Not Finished With Me Yet&quot; was released. Among the guests is Irons&#x27; Josh Hight, who contributes vocals on &quot;The Animals&quot;, &quot;Judas&quot; and &quot;A Secret Never Told&quot;.

Piano Magic&#x27;s final album, &quot;Closure&quot;, was formally released by Second Language Music on 20 January 2017 worldwide on CD, 180 gm vinyl and digital download formats. The album features guest appearances from Peter Milton Walsh of The Apartments, Audrey Riley (go-to cellist for The Go-Betweens, Nick Cave, Virginia Astley and many more), Josh Hight (Irons) and Oliver Cherer (Dollboy).

The band&#x27;s final concert was at The Lexington, Islington, London in December 2016, exactly 20 years to the day of their first ever concert at The Wag Club, Soho, London. The band&#x27;s last line-up for recording and concerts was Franck Alba (guitar), Glen Johnson (guitar, voice), Alasdair Steer (bass), Paul Tornbohm (keyboards) and Jerome Tcherneyan (drums).

===Related projects===
Glen Johnson released a solo album, &quot;Details Not Recorded&quot;, under his own name in March 2009 on the Make Mine Music label. In 2014, he released a 3&quot; postcard EP, &quot;Same Sex&quot; (Hibernate) and featured prominently on the &quot;Silver Servants&quot; eponymous album by a collective of artists from the Second Language Music label. In 2015, Johnson collaborated on an album (&quot;My Heart Has Run Out of Breath&quot;) and audio-visual live performances with the London-based Macedonian artist, Kristina Pulejkova.

Cédric Pin and Glen Johnson have recorded as &quot;Future Conditional&quot;. In 2018, they released a collaborative album, &quot;The Burning Skull&quot; (Second Language Music). Glen Johnson has also recorded under the name, &quot;Textile Ranch.&quot;

Angèle David-Guillou has recorded two albums under the name Klima (&#x27;Klima&#x27;- Peacefrog, 2007 and &#x27;Serenades and Serinettes&#x27;- Second Language 2010). She has released two albums under her own name on the Village Green label : &#x27;Kourouma&#x27; (2013) and &#x27;En Mouvement&#x27; (2017).

Dominic Chennell has recorded as &#x27;Dominic de Nebo&#x27; and with the group &#x27;Carphology Collective&#x27;.

<doc id="675259" wikidata="Q6486651" url="?curid=675259" title="Language Freedom Movement">
<text>The Language Freedom Movement () was a political organisation founded in 1966 that was opposed to some aspects of the state-attempted revival of the Irish language in the Republic of Ireland. The organisation had the backing of several notable Irish-speaking writers including Séamus Ó Grianna (&quot;Máire&quot;) and John B. Keane.

==Concerns==
===Examinations===
At the time the organisation was formed, if a student failed the Irish paper in their Leaving Certificate, they were deemed to have failed the whole exam. This requirement was abolished in 1973, although students are still obliged to study Irish as part of the Leaving Certificate programme and a pass is required for Irish students entering almost all Irish universities (but not for foreign students). In 1974, Irish was removed as a requirement for entry to the civil service.

===Textbooks===
Significant changes in the Leaving Certificate maths curriculum were reflected in two new textbooks produced by the Irish Christian Brothers. However, material for the new honours (higher-level) syllabus was offered only in a government-subsidised book in Irish while the pass (lower-level) material was published in English. The situation continued for several years until affordable alternative textbooks eventually became available.

==Mansion House meeting==
The organisation held a meeting in the Mansion House in Dublin on 21 September 1966. It was advertised by a poster with a cartoon depicting the &quot;Gaelic language policy&quot; as a well-fed cow sitting atop the educational system. The meeting was chaired by broadcaster Gay Byrne. About 2000 people turned up, though most of them seemed opposed to the organisation. Opponents taunted the organisers by waving Union Jacks at them and singing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;. As John B. Keane got up to speak, one man seized an Irish Tricolour from the table used by the organisation, shouting that the flag should not be displayed at such a meeting. A fight involving ten men broke out and calm was only restored when the LFM agreed to four of their opponents speaking at the meeting.

The Gardaí were also present at the meeting. At the request of the organisers, Patrick Byrne TD had asked the Garda Commissioner to ensure law and order prevailed.

Irish language writer Máirtín Ó Cadhain and Mick Ryan (the IRA O/C of Dublin) were involved in the disruption of the meeting.

<text>This is a list of the most populous urban areas in the United Kingdom based on the 2011 census, as defined by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). 

==Definition==
The methodology used by ONS in 2011 is set out in &quot;2011 Built-up Areas – Methodology and Guidance&quot;, published in June 2013. When ONS reported the results of the 2011 UK census, it used the term &quot;built-up area&quot; rather than the term &quot;urban area&quot; as used in previous censuses. ONS states, however, that the criteria used to define &quot;built-up area&quot; have not changed:

In reporting the 2001 census, the ONS gave a clearer definition of the term &quot;built-up&quot; as follows:

<doc id="675270" wikidata="Q4060045" url="?curid=675270" title="House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975">
<text>The House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 (c. 24) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that prohibits certain categories of people from becoming members of the House of Commons. It is an updated version of similar older acts, known collectively by the stock short title House of Commons Disqualification Act.

The groups disqualified from all constituencies are:
* Lords Spiritual
* judges
* civil servants
* serving regular members of the armed forces, except Admirals of the Fleet, Field Marshals and Marshals of the Royal Air Force
* full-time police constables
* members of legislatures of non-Commonwealth countries, other than Ireland
* holders of certain administrative and diplomatic offices
* all members of certain bodies, such as tribunals and government departments, plus some statutory corporations such as Channel 4

Lords-lieutenant and high sheriffs are also disqualified from seats for constituencies within their area.

Section 2 limits the number of government officials (specifically, holders of offices listed in Schedule 2) in the House of Commons at any one time to 95. Any appointed above that limit are forbidden to vote until the number is reduced to 95.

Section 4 effectively adds the Crown Stewards and Bailiffs of the Chiltern Hundreds and of the Manor of Northstead to Part III to Schedule 1, thus naming them as offices whose holders are disqualified. These offices are sinecures, used in modern times to effect resignation from the House of Commons. Prior to 1926, this disqualification was due to them being &quot;offices of profit under the Crown&quot;, but that disqualification was abolished in 1926 and by s. 1(4) of this Act.

The election to the Commons of a disqualified person is invalid, and the seat of an MP who becomes disqualified is vacated immediately (triggering a by-election). The Privy Council has jurisdiction to determine whether a purported MP is disqualified; the issue may be tried in the High Court, Court of Session or High Court of Northern Ireland as appropriate for the constituency.

== Amendments ==
This Act was amended by subsequent legislation:
* The Disqualifications Act 2000, a consequence of the Good Friday Agreement, added the words &quot;other than Ireland&quot;, prior to which Irish legislators were disqualified just as any other foreign legislators are. This was to bring them in line with treatment of Commonwealth legislators; however, no one has taken advantage of this privilege.
* Previously, all ministers of the Church of Scotland, priests, and deacons were disqualified. The House of Commons (Removal of Clergy Disqualification) Act 2001 restricted this disqualification to only Lords Spiritual, i.e. the most senior Anglican bishops who already sit in the House of Lords &quot;ex officio&quot;.
* Various enactments have amended the lists of disqualified bodies and offices, particularly as they have come in or out of existence or fallen out of government control.
* The Representation of the People Act 1981 provides for the automatic disqualification of parliamentary candidates or expulsion of sitting MPs if they serve an imprisonment of over a year. The nomination of a disqualified candidate is voided. The election of such a candidate or the re-election of an MP thus imprisoned will also be voided, leading to a by-election in their constituency.
* The Wales Act 2014 and Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 respectively made members of Senedd Cymru (Welsh Parliament), formerly the National Assembly for Wales until May 2020, or the Northern Ireland Assembly ineligible for the House of Commons.

<doc id="675275" wikidata="Q3030775" url="?curid=675275" title="Distraction">
<text>Distraction is the process of diverting the attention of an individual or group from a desired area of focus and thereby blocking or diminishing the reception of desired information. Distraction is caused by: the lack of ability to pay attention; lack of interest in the object of attention; or the great intensity, novelty or attractiveness of something other than the object of attention. Distractions come from both external sources, and internal sources. External distractions include factors such as visual triggers, social interactions, music, text messages, and phone calls. There are also internal distractions such as hunger, fatigue, illness, worrying, and daydreaming. Both external and internal distractions contribute to the interference of focus.

== Driving ==
Distracted driving is a dangerous threat to road safety across the world. While drunk driving rates have been on the decline since 1983, distracted driving has been increasing in recent years. Many feel this incline is due to the widespread prevalence of cell phones. While distracted driving can be attributed to anything that diverts attention away from the road, it is often the cell phone that receives the blame for distracted driving incidents. Most of the recent studies have shown that cell phone usage while driving has striking similarities to the effects of drinking while driving; Cell phones tend to take the driver&#x27;s attention away from the road and onto itself. With drunk driving, drivers often experience the &quot;looking but not seeing&quot; phenomena. While their eyes do indeed view objects on the road, their brains do not comprehend the meaning behind the image. All levels of distraction while driving are dangerous, and potential drivers are cautioned to keep awareness of their surroundings.

== In education ==
Many psychological studies show that switching between tasks, use of technology, and overstimulation has increased levels of distraction in the school setting. At school, distraction is often viewed as a source of poor performance and misbehavior. Distraction makes focusing on singular, assigned tasks more difficult. Digital components of learning are an emerging component to classroom distraction. Parents, teachers, students, and scholars all have opinions about how technology either benefits or harms a students&#x27; focus in an academic setting. Research studies show that neuron circuits indicate a decrease in ability to be attentive to goal relative stimulus with the addition of distracting stimuli interference. School-aged students, with developing brains, are more apt to conflicting stimuli while trying to focus. Large classroom sizes, technology use in and outside the classroom, and less natural stimuli have been seen as contributing factors to deflating test scores and classroom participation.

==In the workplace==
Multitasking could also be considered as distraction in situations requiring full attention on a single object (e.g., sports, academic tests, performance). The issue of distraction in the workplace is studied in interruption science. According to Gloria Mark, a leader in interruption science, the average knowledge worker switches tasks every three minutes, and, once distracted, a worker takes nearly a half-hour to resume the original task.

==In fiction==
In works of fiction, distraction is often used as a source of comedy, whether the amusement comes from the gullibility of those distracted or the strangeness of whatever is utilized to create the distraction. Examples of comedic distraction, also called comic relief, can oftentimes be found in Shakespearean plays. In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Shakespeare includes a scene in which two gravediggers joke around about Ophelia&#x27;s death. While her death is by no means meant to be funny, a small break from the sadness helped to appease the groundlings in Shakespeare&#x27;s time, as well as allow the rest of the audience to take a break from the constant &quot;doom and gloom&quot; of his tragedies.

==In religion==
Rabbi Alan Lew in his book, &quot;This is Real and You are Completely Unprepared&quot;, writes, &quot;The thoughts that carry our attention away [during prayer or meditation] are never insignificant thoughts and they never arise at random. We lose our focus precisely because these thoughts need our attention and we refuse to give it to them. This is why they keep sneaking up on our attention and stealing it away. This is how it is that we come to know ourselves as we settle deeply into the act of prayer [or meditation]&quot;. According to philosopher Damon Young, distraction is chiefly an inability to identify, attend to or attain what is valuable, even when we are hard-working or content.

==In warfare==
Distraction was a key battle strategy in tales from the Trojan War. According to the legend, the Greeks seemed to have retreated by pretending to sail away. In their stead, they left a large wooden horse, which the Trojans then chose to bring back within their walls in order to celebrate their supposed victory. The Greeks used the Trojans&#x27; pride as a distraction, as they actually hid men within the Trojan Horse in order to let the rest of the army in during the cover of night. The Greeks then entered and destroyed the city of Troy, effectively ending the 10-year standoff that was the Trojan War.

Distraction can suggest fake targets. In open field with mass military strategy, sometimes a contingent of troops distracts the enemy army to expose their flank, or to draw them away from a key point or fortification. Flares can also divert enemy soldiers&#x27; attention.

==In medicine==

Distraction is useful in the management of pain and anxiety. Dentists, for example may intentionally hum an annoying tune or engage in small talk just to create a diversion from the dental surgery process. Topical ointments containing capsaicin, provide a superficial burning sensation that can momentarily distract a patient&#x27;s attention away from the more serious pain of arthritis or muscle strain. A similar effect is made by oil of cloves, which produces a burning sensation on the gums, and distracts from toothache.

Distraction is often used as a coping mechanism for short-term emotion regulation. When presented with an unpleasant reality, humans often choose to occupy their attention with some other reality in order to remain in a positive mental state. This is referred to as &#x27;procrastination&#x27; when the unpleasant reality is in the form of work. The natural human inclination to distract oneself was put to the test when the Department of Psychology at Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin (Humboldt University of Berlin) held an experiment to study distraction. The goal of the experiment was to examine whether the effects of distraction on where subjects held their attention during repeated picture processing is changed by regular emotional functions. Furthermore, they hypothesized that while distraction assists in short-term emotional regulation, it is actually harmful in the long term. In order to do so, the experimenters had subjects view 15 unpleasant pictures (Set A) and &quot;attend&quot; to them (meaning the subjects were asked to pay full attention to the pictures). Next, the subjects were shown 15 unpleasant pictures (Set B) and were asked to distract themselves from the pictures (meaning they were to think about anything other than the picture on the screen; their example was to think about &quot;the way to the supermarket&quot;). Finally, the subjects were shown 15 neutral pictures (Set C) and were asked to attend to them. After 10 minutes of rest, the subjects entered the &quot;re-exposure phase&quot;, which repeated the experiment- this time requiring the subjects to pay attention to all of the sets, including Set B. This experiment was performed on 3 separate blocks of participants. To examine the state of the subjects&#x27; brain, the subject was to wear &quot;Ag/AgCl-electrodes from 61 head sites using an EasyCap electrode system with an equidistant electrode montage. Additional external electrodes were placed below the left (IO1) and right eye (IO2), below T1 (ground), on the nasion, and on the neck.&quot; The subjects were also asked to rate the unpleasantness of the picture on the screen on a scale of 1-9. To test whether distraction in the first phase resulted in increased responsiveness during the re-exposure phase, experimenters &quot;compared mean unpleasantness ratings between unpleasant pictures that were previously presented in the attend (previous attention) versus distract (previous distraction) condition using a paired t-test&quot;. The end results of the experiment were as such:
* When presented with repeated neutral and unpleasant images, subjects had reduced unpleasant stimuli as reflected in their decreased LPP (late positive potential) amplitudes, but only when the participants were asked to attend to those pictures.
* When the subjects avoided confrontation with the unpleasant pictures through distraction, decrease in responsiveness was prevented as reflected in their constant LPP amplitudes.
Essentially, when exposed to an unpleasant image, the subject feels initial discomfort. However, after being exposed to it once with their full attention, the subject feels much less discomfort the second time they are exposed. When the subject distracts themselves from the initial unpleasant image, the subject feels more discomfort the second time when they are required to attend to the image. The experimenters&#x27; conclusion is thus: &quot;the obtained results suggest that distraction inhibits elaborate processing of the stimulus&#x27; meaning and adapting to it.&quot;

==In crime==
Con artists and shoplifters sometimes create a distraction to facilitate their crimes. Armed robbers may create a distraction after their robbery, such as pulling a fire alarm, to create confusion and aid in their getaway. In a more serious case of crime, the Columbine shooters used pipe bombs to distract from the shooting.

==In stage magic==
Magicians use distraction techniques to draw the audience&#x27;s attention away from whichever hand is engaged in sleight of hand. Magicians can accomplish this by encouraging the audience to look elsewhere or by having an assistant do or say something to draw the audience&#x27;s attention away.
Sleight of hand is often used in close-up magic, performed with the audience close to the magician, usually within three or four meters, possibly in physical contact. It often makes use of everyday items as props, such as cards and coins. The guiding principle of sleight-of-hand, articulated by legendary close-up magician Dai Vernon, is &quot;be natural&quot;. A well-performed sleight looks like an ordinary, natural and completely innocent gesture, change in hand-position or body posture.

It is commonly believed that sleight of hand works because &quot;the hand is quicker than the eye&quot; but this is usually not the case. In addition to manual dexterity, sleight of hand depends on the use of psychology, timing, misdirection, and natural choreography in accomplishing a magical effect. Misdirection is perhaps the most important component of the art of sleight of hand. The magician choreographs his actions so that all spectators are likely to look where he or she wants them to. More importantly, they do not look where the performer does not wish them to look. Two types of misdirection are timing and movement. Timing is simple: by allowing a small amount of time to pass after an action, events are skewed in the viewer&#x27;s mind. Movement is a little more complicated. A phrase often used is &quot;A larger action covers a smaller action&quot;. Care must be taken however to not make the larger action so big that it becomes suspicious.

==By media==
Propagandizing techniques of distraction are used in media manipulation. The idea is to encourage the public to focus on a topic or idea that the compliance professional feels is supportive of their cause. By focusing attention, a particular ideology can be made to seem the only reasonable choice. Oftentimes, media competition is the driving force for media bias, manipulation, and distraction. If a media company can find an audience with a united ideology, it then develops a loyal consumer base, as its consumers will be happy with the way media is presented. A so-called &quot;conservative&quot; media outlet would not hire a &quot;liberal&quot; reporter, as they would run the risk of alienating its viewership.

Distraction is also important in studies of media multitasking, or the simultaneous use of multiple media at once. This behavior has emerged as increasingly common since the 1990s, especially among younger media users. Studies show that while humans are predisposed to the desire to multitask, most people struggle to have legitimate productivity while multitasking. Instead of giving a task full attention, the split attention that multitasking necessitates can cause one task to be a distraction to another. On the other hand, some studies show that multitasking has the potential for a high-risk high-reward situation, leading to the idea that success can arise from multitasking if one is good at the activity.

Advertisers often seek to distract people and divert their attention to advertising content. This has been characterized as attention theft.

<text>Levonorgestrel is a hormonal medication which is used in a number of birth control methods. It is combined with an estrogen to make combination birth control pills. As an emergency birth control, sold under the brand names Plan B One-Step and Julie, among others, it is useful within 72 hours of unprotected sex. The more time that has passed since sex, the less effective the medication becomes, and it does not work after pregnancy (implantation) has occurred. Levonorgestrel works by preventing ovulation or fertilization from occurring. It decreases the chances of pregnancy by 57–93%. In an intrauterine device (IUD), such as Mirena among others, it is effective for the long-term prevention of pregnancy. A levonorgestrel-releasing implant is also available in some countries.
Common side effects include nausea, breast tenderness, headaches, and increased, decreased, or irregular menstrual bleeding. When used as an emergency contraceptive, if pregnancy occurs, there is no evidence that its use harms the fetus. It is safe to use during breastfeeding. Birth control that contains levonorgestrel will not change the risk of sexually transmitted infections. It is a progestin and has effects similar to those of the hormone progesterone. It works primarily by preventing ovulation and closing off the cervix to prevent the passage of sperm.
Levonorgestrel was patented in 1960 and introduced for medical use together with ethinylestradiol in 1970. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In the United States, levonorgestrel-containing emergency contraceptives are available over the counter (OTC) for all ages. In 2020, it was the 323rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 800thousand prescriptions.
==Medical uses==

===Birth control===
At low doses, levonorgestrel is used in monophasic and triphasic formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills, with available monophasic doses ranging from 100 to 250 μg, and triphasic doses of 50 μg, 75 μg, and 125 μg. It is combined with the estrogen ethinylestradiol in these formulations.

At very low daily dose of 30 μg, levonorgestrel is used in some progestogen-only pill formulations.

Levonorgestrel is the active ingredient in a number of intrauterine devices including Mirena and Skyla. It is also the active ingredient in the birth control implants Norplant and Jadelle.

One of the more common forms of contraception that contains only levonorgestrel is an IUD. One IUD, the Mirena, is a small hollow cylinder containing levonorgestrel and polydimethylsiloxane and covered with a release rate-controlling membrane.

===Emergency birth control===
Levonorgestrel is used in emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), both in a combined Yuzpe regimen which includes estrogen, and as a levonorgestrel-only method. The levonorgestrel-only method uses levonorgestrel 1.5 mg (as a single dose or as two 0.75 mg doses 12 hours apart) taken within three days of unprotected sex. One study indicated that beginning as late as 120 hours (5 days) after intercourse could be effective. However, taking more than one dose of emergency contraception does not increase the chance of pregnancy not happening. Planned Parenthood asserts &quot;Taking the morning-after pill (also known as emergency contraception) multiple times doesn&#x27;t change its effectiveness, and won&#x27;t cause any long-term side effects.&quot;

The primary mechanism of action of levonorgestrel as a progestogen-only emergency contraceptive pill is, according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), to prevent fertilization by inhibition of ovulation and thickening of cervical mucus. FIGO has stated that: &quot;review of the evidence suggests that LNG [levonorgestreol] ECPs cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg. Language on implantation should not be included in LNG ECP product labeling.&quot; In November 2013, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a change to the label saying it cannot prevent implantation of a fertilized egg.

Other studies still find the evidence to be unclear. While it is unlikely that emergency contraception affects implantation it is impossible to completely exclude the possibility of post-fertilization effect.

In November 2013, the EMA also approved a change to the label for HRA Pharma&#x27;s &quot;NorLevo&quot; saying: &quot;In clinical trials, contraceptive efficacy was reduced in women weighing 75 kg [165 pounds] or more, and levonorgestrel was not effective in women who weighed more than 80 kg [176 pounds].&quot; In November 2013 and January 2014, the FDA and the EMA said they were reviewing whether increased weight and body mass index (BMI) reduce the efficacy of emergency contraceptives.

An analysis of four WHO randomised clinical trials, published in January 2017, showed pregnancy rates of 1.25% (68/5428) in women with BMI under 25, 0.61% (7/1140) in women with BMI between 25 and 30, and 2.03% (6/295) in women with BMI over 30. These values yield an eight-fold reduction in efficacy for women with a BMI over 30 compared to women with a BMI under 25. However, emergency contraceptives remain effective regardless of BMI.

===Hormone therapy===
Levonorgestrel is used in combination with an estrogen in menopausal hormone therapy. It is used under the brand name &quot;Klimonorm&quot; as a combined oral tablet with estradiol valerate and under the brand name &quot;Climara Pro&quot; as a combined transdermal patch with estradiol.

===Available forms===
As a type of emergency contraception, levonorgestrel is used after unprotected intercourse to reduce the risk of pregnancy. However, it can serve different hormonal purposes in its different methods of delivery. It is available for use in a variety of forms:

====By mouth====
Levonorgestrel can be taken by mouth as a form of emergency birth control. The typical dosage is either 1.5 mg taken once or 0.75 mg taken 12–24 hours apart. The effectiveness in both methods is similar. The most widely used form of oral emergency contraception is the progestin-only pill, which contains a 1.5 mg dosage of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraceptive pills are reported to have an 89% effectiveness rate if taken within the recommended 72 hours after sex. The efficacy of the drug decreases by 50% for each 12-hour delay in taking the dose after the emergency contraceptive regimen has been started.

====Skin patch====
Estradiol with levonorgestrel in the form of a skin patch is used under the brand name Climara Pro for hormone replacement therapy in postmenstrual women, treating symptoms such as hot flashes or osteoporosis. The simultaneous delivery of a progestogen such as levonorgestrel is necessary for the protection of the endometrium.

====Intrauterine device====
The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) is a type of long-term birth control that releases the progestin into the uterine cavity. Levonorgestrel is released at a constant, gradual rate of 0.02 mg per day by the polydimethylsiloxane membrane of the device, which renders it effective for up to five years. Because it is inserted directly into the uterus, levonorgestrel is present in the endometrium in much higher concentrations that would result from a LNG-containing oral pill; the LNG-IUS delivers 391 ng of levonorgestrel to the inner uterine region while a comparable oral contraceptive delivers only 1.35 ng. This high level of levonorgestrel impedes the function of the endometrium, making it hostile for sperm transport, fertilization, and implantation of an ovum.

====Implant====
Subcutaneous implants of levonorgestrel have been marketed as birth control implants under the brand names Norplant and Jadelle and are available for use in some countries.

==Contraindications==
Known or suspected pregnancy is a contraindication of levonorgestrel as an emergency contraceptive.

==Side effects==
After an intake of 1.5 mg levonorgestrel in clinical trials, very common side effects (reported by 10% or more) included: hives, dizziness, hair loss, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, uterine pain, delayed menstruation, heavy menstruation, uterine bleeding, and fatigue; common side effects (reported by 1% to 10%) included diarrhea, vomiting, and painful menstruation; these side effects usually disappeared within 48 hours. However, the long term side effects common with oral contraceptives such as arterial disease are lower with levonorgestrel than in combination pills.

Levonorgestrel as a contraceptive intrauterine device has been associated with a slightly higher risk of breast cancer than with non-use in select studies. 

==Overdose==
Overdose of levonorgestrel as an emergency contraoceptive has not been described. Nausea and vomiting might be expected.

== Interactions ==

If taken together with drugs that induce the CYP3A4 cytochrome P450 liver enzyme, levonorgestrel may be metabolized faster and may have lower effectiveness. 
These include, but are not limited to barbiturates, bosentan, carbamazepine, felbamate, griseofulvin, oxcarbazepine, phenytoin, rifampin, St. John&#x27;s wort and topiramate.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Levonorgestrel is a progestogen with weak androgenic activity. It has no other important hormonal activity, including no estrogenic, glucocorticoid, or antimineralocorticoid activity. The lack of significant mineralocorticoid or antimineralocorticoid activity with levonorgestrel is in spite of it having relatively high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor, which is as much as 75% of that of aldosterone.

====Progestogenic activity====
Levonorgestrel is a progestogen; that is, an agonist of the progesterone receptor (PR), the main biological target of the progestogen sex hormone progesterone. It has effects similar to those of the hormone progesterone. As a contraceptive, it works primarily by preventing ovulation and closing off the cervix to prevent the passage of sperm. The endometrial transformation dose of levonorgestrel is 150 to 250μg/day or 2.5 to 6mg per cycle.

====Antigonadotropic effects====
Due to its progestogenic activity, levonorgestrel has antigonadotropic effects and is able to suppress the secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, from the pituitary gland. This in turn, results in suppression of gonadal activity, including reduction of fertility and gonadal sex hormone production in both women and men. The ovulation-inhibiting dose of levonorgestrel in premenopausal women is 50 to 60μg/day.

In men, levonorgestrel causes marked suppression of circulating testosterone levels secondary to its antigonadotropic effects. In healthy young men, levonorgestrel alone at a dose of 120 to 240 μg/day orally for 2 weeks suppressed testosterone levels from ~450 ng/dL to ~248 ng/dL (–45%). Because of its effects on testosterone levels, and due to its androgenic activity being only weak and hence insufficient for purposes of androgen replacement in males, levonorgestrel has potent functional antiandrogenic effects in men. Consequently, it can produce adverse effects like decreased libido and erectile dysfunction, among others. Levonorgestrel has been combined with an androgen like testosterone or dihydrotestosterone when it has been studied as a hormonal contraceptive in men.

====Androgenic activity====
Levonorgestrel is a weak agonist of the androgen receptor (AR), the main biological target of the androgen sex hormone testosterone. It is a weakly androgenic progestin and in women may cause androgenic biochemical changes and side effects such as decreased sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, decreased cholesterol levels, weight gain, and acne.

In combination with a potent estrogen like ethinylestradiol however, all contraceptives containing androgenic progestins are negligibly androgenic in practice and in fact can be used to treat androgen-dependent conditions like acne and hirsutism in women. This is because ethinylestradiol causes a marked increase in SHBG levels and thereby decreases levels of free and hence bioactive testosterone, acting as a functional antiandrogen. Nonetheless, contraceptives containing progestins that are less androgenic increase SHBG levels to a greater extent and may be more effective for such indications. Levonorgestrel is currently the most androgenic progestin that is used in contraceptives, and contraceptives containing levonorgestrel may be less effective for androgen-dependent conditions relative to those containing other progestins that are less androgenic.

====Other activity====
Levonorgestrel stimulates the proliferation of MCF-7 breast cancer cells &quot;in vitro&quot;, an action that is independent of the classical PRs and is instead mediated via the progesterone receptor membrane component-1 (PGRMC1). Certain other progestins act similarly in this assay, whereas progesterone acts neutrally. It is unclear if these findings may explain the different risks of breast cancer observed with progesterone and progestins in clinical studies.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The bioavailability of levonorgestrel is approximately 95% (range 85 to 100%). The plasma protein binding of levonorgestrel is about 98%. It is bound 50% to albumin and 48% to SHBG. Levonorgestrel is metabolized in the liver, via reduction, hydroxylation, and conjugation (specifically glucuronidation and sulfation). Oxidation occurs primarily at the C2α and C16β positions, while reduction occurs in the A ring. 5α-Dihydrolevonorgestrel is produced as an active metabolite of levonorgestrel by 5α-reductase. The elimination half-life of levonorgestrel is 24 to 32 hours, although values as short as 8 hours and as great as 45 hours have been reported. About 20 to 67% of a single oral dose of levonorgestrel is eliminated in urine and 21 to 34% in feces.

==Chemistry==
Levonorgestrel, also known as 17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone or as 17α-ethynyl-18-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is the C13β or levorotatory stereoisomer and enantiopure form of norgestrel, the C13α or dextrorotatory isomer being inactive. Levonorgestrel is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) and is the parent compound of the gonane (18-methylestrane or 13β-ethylgonane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. Besides levonorgestrel itself, this group includes desogestrel, dienogest, etonogestrel, gestodene, norelgestromin, norgestimate, and norgestrel. Levonorgestrel acetate and levonorgestrel butanoate are C17β esters of levonorgestrel. Levonorgestrel has a molecular weight of 312.45 g/mol and a partition coefficient (log &quot;P&quot;) of 3.8.

==History==
Norgestrel (&quot;rac&quot;-13-ethyl-17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone), the racemic mixture containing levonorgestrel and dextronorgestrel, was discovered by Hughes and colleagues at Wyeth in 1963 via structural modification of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone). It was the first progestogen to be manufactured via total chemical synthesis. Norgestrel was introduced for medical use as a combined birth control pill with ethinylestradiol under the brand name &quot;Eugynon&quot; in Germany in 1966 and under the brand name &quot;Ovral&quot; in the United States 1968, and as a progestogen-only pill under the brand name &quot;Ovrette&quot; in the United States in 1973. Following its discovery, norgestrel had been licensed by Wyeth to Schering AG, which separated the racemic mixture into its two optical isomers and identified levonorgestrel (13β-ethyl-17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) as the active component of the mixture. Levonorgestrel was first studied in humans by 1970, and was introduced for medical use in Germany as a combined birth control pill with ethinylestradiol under the brand name &quot;Neogynon&quot; in August 1970. A more widely used formulation, containing lower doses of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel, was introduced under the brand name &quot;Microgynon&quot; by 1973. In addition to combined formulations, levonorgestrel was introduced as a progestogen-only pill under the brand names &quot;Microlut&quot; by 1972 and &quot;Microval&quot; by 1974. Many other formulations and brand names of levonorgestrel-containing birth control pills have also been marketed.

Levonorgestrel, taken alone in a single high dose, was first evaluated as a form of emergency contraception in 1973. It was the second progestin to be evaluated for such purposes, following a study of quingestanol acetate in 1970. In 1974, the Yuzpe regimen, which consisted of high doses of a combined birth control pill containing ethinylestradiol and norgestrel, was described as a method of emergency contraception by A. Albert Yuzpe and colleagues, and saw widespread interest. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraception was introduced under the brand name &quot;Postinor&quot; by 1978. Ho and Kwan published the first study comparing levonorgestrel only and the Yuzpe regimen as methods of emergency contraception in 1993 and found that they had similar effectiveness but that levonorgestrel alone was better-tolerated. In relation to this, the Yuzpe regimen has largely been replaced as a method of emergency contraception by levonorgrestrel-only preparations. Levonorgestrel-only emergency contraception was approved in the United States under the brand name &quot;Plan B&quot; in 1999, and has also been marketed widely elsewhere throughout the world under other brand names such as &quot;Levonelle&quot; and &quot;NorLevo&quot; in addition to &quot;Postinor&quot;. In 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved &quot;Plan B One-Step&quot; for sale over-the-counter in the United States without a prescription or age restriction.

Levonorgestrel has also been introduced for use as a progestogen-only intrauterine device under the brand names &quot;Mirena&quot; and &quot;Skyla&quot; among others, as a progestogen-only birth control implant under the brand names &quot;Norplant&quot; and &quot;Jadelle&quot;, as a combined oral tablet with estradiol valerate for menopausal hormone therapy under the brand name &quot;Klimonorm&quot;, and as a combined transdermal patch with estradiol for menopausal hormone therapy under the brand name &quot;Climara Pro&quot;. Ester prodrugs of levonorgestrel such as levonorgestrel acetate and levonorgestrel butanoate have been developed and studied as other forms of birth control such as long-acting progestogen-only injectable contraceptives and contraceptive vaginal rings, but have not been marketed for medical use.

As an emergency contraceptive, levonorgestrel is often referred to colloquially as the &quot;morning-after pill&quot;.

===Availability===
Levonorgestrel is very widely marketed throughout the world and is available in almost every country.

===Accessibility===
Levonorgestrel-containing emergency contraception is available over-the-counter in some countries, such as the United States. On some college campuses, Plan B is available from vending machines.

A policy update in 2015, required all pharmacies, clinics, and emergency departments run by Indian Health Services (for Native Americans) to have Plan B One-Step in stock, to distribute it to any woman (or her representative) who asked for it without a prescription, age verification, registration or any other requirement, to provide orientation training to all staff regarding the medication, to provide unbiased and medically accurate information about emergency contraception, and to make someone available at all times to distribute the pill in case the primary staffer objected to providing it on religious or moral grounds.

==Research==
Levonorgestrel has been studied in combination with androgens such as testosterone and dihydrotestosterone as a hormonal contraceptive for men.

<text>A works council is a shop-floor organization representing workers that functions as a local/firm-level complement to trade unions but is independent of these at least in some countries. Works councils exist with different names in a variety of related forms in a number of European countries, including Great Britain (&quot;joint consultative committee&quot; or &quot;employees’ council&quot;); Germany and Austria (&quot;Betriebsrat&quot;); Luxembourg (&quot;comité mixte&quot;, &quot;délégation du personnel&quot;); the Netherlands (&quot;Dienstcommissie, Ondernemingsraad&quot;) and Flanders in Belgium (&quot;ondernemingsraad&quot;); Italy (&quot;comitato aziendale&quot;); France (&quot;comité social et économique&quot;); Wallonia in Belgium (&quot;conseil d&#x27;entreprise&quot;), Spain (&quot;comité de empresa&quot;) and Denmark (&quot;Samarbejdsudvalg&quot; or &quot;SU&quot;).

One of the most commonly examined (and arguably most successful) implementations of this institution is found in Germany. The model is basically as follows: general labour agreements are made at the national level by national unions (e.g. IG Metall) and German Employer Associations (e.g. ), and local plants and firms then meet with works councils to adjust these national agreements to local circumstances. Works council members are elected by the company workforce for a four-year term. They don&#x27;t have to be union members; works councils can also be formed in companies where neither the employer nor the employees are organized.

Works council representatives may also be appointed to the board of directors.

As with co-determination, there are three main views about why works councils primarily exist: to reduce workplace conflict by improving and systematising communication channels; to increase bargaining power of workers at the expense of owners by means of legislation; and to correct market failures by means of public policy.

== Europe ==

On 22 September 1994, the Council of the European Union passed a Directive (94/45/EC) on the establishment of a European Works Council (EWC) or similar procedure for the purposes of informing and consulting employees in companies which operate at European Union level.

The EWC Directive applies to companies with at least 1,000 employees within the EU and at least 150 employees in each of at least two EEA countries.

European Works Councils were created partly as a response to increased transnational restructuring brought about by the Single European Act. They give representatives of workers from all European countries in big multinational companies a direct line of communication to top management. They also make sure that workers in different countries are all told the same thing at the same time about transnational policies and plans. Lastly, they give workers’ representatives in unions and national works councils the opportunity to consult with each other and to develop a common European response to employers’ transnational plans, which management must then consider before those plans are implemented.

The EWC Directive was revised by the Council and the European Parliament in May 2009. The changes contained in the new (&quot;Recast&quot;) Directive must be transposed into national law by 5 June 2011, and have important implications for all companies in scope of the legislation, both those with an existing European Works Council and those yet to have set one up.

A similar transnational consultative body exists for employees of &quot;Societates Europaeae&quot;, called SE-Representative-Body or SE Works Council. This went into effect in 2004 with the Employee Involvement Directive (2001/86/EC). SE Works Councils are comparable with European Works Councils according to the European Trade Union Institute.

A (C.E. or works council) was mandatory in any company with 50 employees or more. It is being replaced by the (CSE or Business and Social Council) which must have been rolled out in all companies where applicable for 1 January 2020 the latest. Members of the CE are elected by all the employees, and have 20 hours of delegation per month. The main role of the CE or the CSE is being the interface between the employees and the members of the board which is constituted of the chairman and the HR director, mostly for collective issues, such as work organisation, training policy, benefits. Its consultation is compulsory in case of certain economic events, such as any company strategic moves, The number of members depends on the number of people in the company. All members of the CE or CSE have a monthly meeting with the board, in which very specific points are dealt with.

== Germany ==
Works councils (singular: &#x27;, plural: &#x27;) in Germany have a long history, with their origins in the early 1920s in the post World War I Weimar Republic, established by the Works Councils Act (&quot;Betriebsrätegesetz&quot;), later updated in 1952 with the establishment of the Works Constitution Act in West Germany. Initially, unions were very skeptical of works councils, seeing them as a way for management to negotiate with employees without collective bargaining, but eventually they developed clearly defined responsibilities with works councils forbidden from calling for strikes or negotiating wage increase. In recent years with a decline in union membership, works councils have come to be seen as a way for unions to recruit members, specifically by having works councils campaign for people to join them. In 2019, depending on sector, between 16% and 86% of employees worked at an employer with a works council.

While membership in a trade union is explicitly not required, according to the Hans Boeckler Stiftung analysis of year 2014 Works Council elections, depending on sector; between 60 and 80% of Works Councillors elected were members of affiliated trade unions in the German Trade Union Confederation. Unions can offer protections to works council members. For example, unions provide training courses to ensure legally compliant works council elections, which can preempt attacks from management bodies who are hostile to the founding of a works council.

In Germany, they serve two functions. The first is called co-determination, through which works councils elect members of the board of directors of German companies. The second is called participation, and means that works councils must be consulted about specific issues and have the right to make proposals to management. One of the most impressive achievements of the councils is producing harmonious relations between management and workers, leading to a situation with strong unions and a low strike rate.

Works councils in Germany have been correlated with a number of positive effects. They promote higher wages, even more than collective bargaining (although situations with both will promote wages the highest), they make firms more productive (although the degree to which they increase productivity can be hard to measure). and they don&#x27;t inhibit investment or innovation. Works councils have also been shown to help women, East German, and foreign workers. However, they are correlated lower profitability, likely since they tend to bring higher wages, and there may not be as much benefit in smaller companies as there is in larger ones.

Obstruction of the Works Council is a criminal offence.
=== History ===
Workers’ rights to codetermine working conditions in Germany began at least as far back as 1850, when four social-liberal entrepreneurs, led by Carl Degenkolb, joined forces in Eilenburg to introduce workers committees to their factories, in part to mitigate worker unrest and inoculate against socialist and union agitation. Statutory workers&#x27; committees (&quot;Arbeiterausschüsse&quot;) were first introduced in Germany in mining companies in Bavaria in 1900 and in Prussia in 1905. The Auxiliary Service Act of 1916, passed during the First World War, provided for the introduction of permanent workers&#x27; committees in all companies important to the war economy with at least 50 employees. These workers&#x27; committees only had advisory and consultation rights, but they could appeal to an arbitration committee with equal representation and a neutral chairman, to whose decision the employer had to submit.

The current structure and mandate of works councils can be traced to the soviet movement that swept through Europe in the early twentieth century. In Germany, self-governing workers’ (&quot;Arbeiter&quot;-) and soldiers’ councils (&quot;Soldatenräte&quot;) formed in 1918 in the November Revolution. Demands for a soviet-led German republic were eventually neutralized by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), with the Works Constitution Act (&quot;Betriebsrätegesetz&quot;) of 1920 emerging as a concession to the movement. This Act made works councils compulsory for all companies with over 20 employees. In the Weimar Republic, the ADGB unions discussed expanding the powers of the works councils to include production control in the name of economic democracy, thus initiating socialist transformation. However, this concept failed in the global economic crisis that began in 1929.

The rise of fascism brought a “revised, anti-Marxist version of socialism.” The Nazis launched ambitious “corporatist” policies that “rejected class struggle and replaced it with the idea of cooperation between employers and workers.” Works councils were banned by the 1934 Work Order Act and replaced by so-called councils of confidence (&quot;Vertrauensräte&quot;).

With the Allied Control Council Law No. 22 of April 10, 1946, works councils were permitted again in Germany. The first Works Constitution Act (BetrVG 1952) was passed on October 11, 1952. It followed the tradition of the Works Council Act of 1920, whose basic ideas were largely adopted. In 1972, after a controversial social debate, the Works Constitution Act (BetrVG 1972) was fundamentally revised, and it was reformed again in 2001.
Among other things, the working and organizational principles of the works councils were changed. The election procedure was simplified, an &quot;equality quota&quot; (minimum seats for the gender in the minority, see electoral regulations Works Constitution Act § 15 WO) was introduced, the separation between blue-collar and white-collar workers was abolished, the exemption thresholds for works council members were lowered and the works council&#x27;s involvement in the introduction of group work was made possible, as was the involvement of consultants in the event of operational changes.

<text>A Rose for Mary: The Hunt for the Real Boston Strangler is a 2003 book about Mary Sullivan, the last victim of confessed Boston Strangler Albert DeSalvo. Written by Sullivan&#x27;s nephew, Casey Sherman, the book presents DNA evidence that suggests DeSalvo was not the Boston Strangler.

On July 11, 2013, Boston Police Department released information stating that they had discovered DNA evidence linking DeSalvo to the murder of Mary Sullivan. DNA found at the scene was a &quot;near certain match&quot; to DNA taken from a nephew of DeSalvo. To determine conclusively that it was DeSalvo&#x27;s, a court ordered the exhumation of his body in order to test his DNA directly. On July 19, 2013 Suffolk County DA Daniel F. Conley, Mass. Attorney General Martha Coakley and Boston Police Commissioner Edward F. Davis announced the DNA test results proving Albert Henry DeSalvo was the source of seminal fluid recovered at the scene of Sullivan&#x27;s 1964 murder.

<doc id="675297" wikidata="Q5322218" url="?curid=675297" title="E. W. Scripps School of Journalism">
<text>The E. W. Scripps School of Journalism is the namesake school of the Scripps College of Communication at Ohio University seated in the Schoonover Center for Communication. Founded in 1924, the school has been recognized by The Associated Press and U.S. News &amp; World Report for excellence in instruction and research in the fields of journalism and mass communications. The program has attracted more than $54 million in grants, awards, and investments. The School of Journalism is accredited by the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. 

In 2013, the school relocated into the former Baker University Center building which was renovated to be the centerpiece of the Scripps College of Communication. The refurbished building features the latest in comms instruction technology and is designed in the form of a large news agency. The school&#x27;s current director as of March 2020, Edith Dashiell, joined Ohio University in 1992.

== Degree Programs ==
=== Undergraduate===
The new curriculum at the school features two tracks in the Bachelor of Science, Journalism degree:
* News &amp; Information, which combines the previous sequences of Broadcast News, Magazine Journalism, News Writing and Editing, and Online Journalism.
* Strategic Communication, which combines the previous sequences of Advertising and Public Relations.

Each track requires candidates to enroll in prerequisite journalism courses (&quot;core&quot; classes) and track-specific skills classes. Students, however, must also specialize in electives outside the school of journalism, and each student must complete an advisor-approved internship before graduating. Students may also build their own coursework through the &quot;Carr Van Anda&quot; Program.

===Graduate===
The school offers Master&#x27;s of Science programs in Journalism and a PhD in Mass Communication. Many students work toward their PhD in mass communication with an emphasis in either Media Studies or Journalism. Scripps students often publish their work in academic journals or present papers at academic conferences, such as the annual convention of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. In August 2014, seven graduate students are scheduled to present 11 papers at the AEJMC annual convention.

== Scripps Howard relationship ==
The E. W. Scripps School of Journalism, together with the Scripps College of Communication, is funded in part by numerous grants from the Scripps Howard Foundation. To date, the foundation has given approximately $20 million in funding to Ohio University&#x27;s communication programs. The foundation also funds the Scripps Howard Visiting Professionals program, which brings in well-known journalists to teach at the school. Recent visiting professionals have included Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Julia Keller, Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Miami Herald&quot; columnist Leonard Pitts, former &quot;The New York Times&quot; editor Mark Prendergast, former &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine senior editor Mark Tatge and former &quot;Associated Press&quot; Beirut bureau chief Terry Anderson. Notable alumni include NFL journalist Peter King of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune, Andy Alexander of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and Laura Landro of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

== Associated institutes and organizations ==
The Scripps School has a close relationship with the College of Arts &amp; Sciences and specifically the English Department which offers a variety of writing and rhetoric classes. The Schoonover Center for Communication houses the School of Journalism faculty suite, Lasher Learning Center, two research labs, the Scripps College Survey Center, the Scripps Survey Research Center, co-founded by Distinguished Professor Guido Stempel and Thomas K. Hargrove, as well as other schools in the Scripps College of Communication. The Institute for International Journalism is located within the E. W. Scripps School of Journalism, and is currently headed by Yusuf Kalyango, an associate professor in the school. The institute administers the John R. Wilhelm foreign correspondence program, which has placed more than 250 students with international internships in 30 countries since 1970. Many journalism students work for the independently run campus newspaper, &quot;The Post&quot;, and WOUB-TV and Radio. The online radio station, All Campus Radio Network (ACRN), is another popular option for journalists. Many students are also an active part of the city of Athens&#x27; main newspapers &quot;Athens Messenger&quot; and &quot;The Athens News&quot; as well as several student-run media, including &quot;Speakeasy Mag&quot;, a student-produced online magazine with more than 100 staff members, Backdrop (magazine), a quarterly arts and culture magazine, and , the university&#x27;s only fashion magazine.

<text>IG Metall (; IGM; German: , &quot;Industrial Union of Metalworkers&#x27;&quot;) is the dominant metalworkers&#x27; union in Germany, making it the country&#x27;s largest union as well as Europe&#x27;s largest industrial union. Analysts of German labor relations consider it a major trend-setter in national bargaining.

IG Metall and ver.di together account for around 15 percent of the German workforce, and other sectors tend to broadly follow their agreements.

== History ==
The name IG Metall refers to the union&#x27;s metalworkers roots dating back to the start of unions in imperial Germany in the 1890s, though this formal organization was founded post-war in 1949. Over the years the union has taken on representation in industries beyond mining of minerals to include manufacturing and industrial production, machinists, printing industry, which includes modern automobile manufacturing and steel production as part of its blue-collar root, but also includes more white-collar sectors such as electrical and other forms of engineering, information systems, and with the combining of formerly separate unions for workers in wood, plastics, textiles and clothing, includes non-metal blue-collar workers. On April 1, 1998, the Textile and Clothing Union (GTB) joined IG Metall. On January 1, 2000, the Wood and Plastic Union (GHK), also joined.

Deals agreed by IG Metall in the pilot region of Baden-Württemberg, an industrial and car-making hub and home to Daimler and Bosch, have traditionally been serving as a template for agreements across the country.

Major accomplishments of IG Metall in the German labor market include, applied to the regions/covered employees:
* Five-day work week (1959)
* Paid vacation time concessions (1962)
* 40 hr work week (1965–1967)
* Paid sick leave (1956)
* 35-hour work week (attempts not yet successful 1984)
* 35-hour work week in metal industry (1995)

Most recently, IG Metall agreed to a landmark deal with employers in 2016, giving 3.8 million workers in the metalworking sector a two-stage pay rise of 4.8 percent over 21 months. After a series of strikes, the union agreed a deal in 2018 to allow staff to cut their working week to 28 hours for up to two years to care for children or other relatives. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, IG Metall notably proposed negotiating for a move to a four-day week to help secure jobs against economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis and structural shifts in the automobile industry.

=== Major strikes ===
Strikes are rare in Germany, where companies and unions strive for consensus whenever possible. One of the first strikes of IG Metall lasted seven weeks in 1984 in the states of Baden-Württemberg and Hesse, which led to a reduction in the workweek to 35 hours from 37. Another major strike was organized by IG Metall in 1995, when up to 11,000 workers in Bavaria remained off the job for two weeks. In 2002, IG Metall called a wave of one-day strikes in a demand for a 6.5 percent increase in wages; German industry settled the dispute two weeks later by offering a raise of roughly 4 percent. In 2003, the union was forced to drop its campaign for a shorter workweek in the factories of eastern Germany after its hard-nosed negotiating tactics were repudiated by Germans across the political spectrum. In early 2018, more than 900,000 workers took part in industrial action in support of IG Metall&#x27;s demands for higher pay and the right to shortened working hours.

In autumn 2024, warning strikes of workers in electrical engineering and metal industries were held after collective bargaining negotiations fell short. In these negotiations, employers offered a 3.6% pay rise over a period of 27 months which was considerably lower than the 7% sought by IG Metall. Companies criticised IG Metall&#x27;s demands as unrealistic due to a general slowdown in German industry. IG Metall however pointed out high inflation and the failure to attract much-needed skilled labour.

Also in 2024, IG Metall agreed with Volkswagen on more than 35,000 job cuts and sharp capacity reductions after two separate strikes, the largest in Volkswagen&#x27;s history, protesting against cost-cutting plans, and 70 hours of negotiations, the longest in the company&#x27;s history.

== Membership ==
Today IG Metall mainly represents employees at major car makers, such as Daimler, BMW, Porsche, Volkswagen, Audi and industrial giants such as Siemens, ThyssenKrupp, Airbus, Salzgitter AG, ArcelorMittal, Bosch, ZF and smaller mechanic construction companies and car-mechanics. Its membership had been dropping in recent decades — it lost 250,000 members in 1993 alone —, yet the union managed to somewhat reverse that trend recently by gaining 30,000 members between 2010 and 2015. A record in wage deals, along with a push to recruit more women, young people (e.g. students) and white-collar workers, helped it boost 2015 membership by 121,000 to 2.3 million and income by 3.4 percent to 533 million euros ($582 million); this rise came against a backdrop of generally declining union in Germany.

=== Notable members ===

== Organisation structure ==
=== Regional districts ===
IG Metall consists of 7 (districts) which are subdivided in (administrative areas):
* Bezirk Baden-Württemberg headquarters located in Stuttgart; 28 Verwaltungstellen
* Bezirk Bayern (Bavaria) headquarters located in Munich; 21 Verwaltungstellen
* Bezirk Berlin-Brandenburg-Sachsen (Berlin + Brandenburg + Saxony) headquarters located in Berlin; 12 Verwaltungstellen
* Bezirk Frankfurt (Saarland + Rhineland-Palatinate + Hesse + Thuringia) headquarters located in Frankfurt/Main; 27 Verwaltungstellen
* Bezirk Küste (&quot;Küste&quot;= &quot;Sea Coast&quot;) (Bremen + Hamburg + Schleswig-Holstein + Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania + North Lower Saxony) headquarters located in Hamburg; 19 Verwaltungstellen
* Bezirk Niedersachsen und Sachsen-Anhalt (Middle/South Lower Saxony + Saxony-Anhalt) headquarters located in Hanover; 20 Verwaltungstellen
* Bezirk Nordrhein-Westfalen (North Rhine-Westphalia) headquarters located in Düsseldorf; 47 Verwaltungstellen

=== Chairs ===
*Until 1956, IGM had two co-equal chairpersons. Thereafter, the organization changed to a 1st Chair and 2nd Chair, with the 2nd Chair being traditionally promoted to 1st Chair upon the retirement of the 1st Chair. However, Alois Wöhrle (1969) and Karl-Heinz Janzen (1992) retired without advancing to 1st Chair, while Walter Riester (1998) became Federal Minister of Labour and therefore dropped out.

=== International relations ===
IG Metall is a member of the German Trade Union Confederation (Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund, DGB). IGM is also a member of some international union umbrella organisations, including the European Metalworkers&#x27; Federation (EMF) and the IndustriALL Global Union.

In 2015, IG Metall and the U.S. United Automobile Workers (UAW) announced that they would deepen their partnership and set up an office in Tennessee to boost labor rights at German automakers and their suppliers based in the United States.

== magazine ==
The IGM magazine, , has existed since 1949. In 2005 it had a circulation of over 2 million. There are 12 issues per year.

<doc id="675308" wikidata="Q2537221" url="?curid=675308" title="Forficula auricularia">
<text>Forficula auricularia is a species complex comprising the common [[earwig]]. It is also known as the European earwig. It is an omnivorous insect belonging to the family Forficulidae. The name &quot;earwig&quot; comes from the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique in their resemblance to human ears when unfolded. The species name of the common earwig, &quot;auricularia&quot;, is a specific reference to this feature. The European earwig survives in a variety of environments. It is also a common household insect in North America. They are often considered a household pest because of their tendency to invade crevices in homes and consume pantry foods, though they may also act as beneficial species depending on the circumstances.

&quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; is reddish-brown in color with a flattened elongated body and slender beaded antennae. Earwigs possess pairs of pincers or forceps at the tip of the flexible abdomen. Both sexes have these pincers. In males, they are large and curved, whereas in females, they are straight. Nymphs are similar to adults in appearance, though their wings are either absent or small.

==Morphology==
&quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; have elongated flattened brownish-colored bodies, with a shield-shaped pronotum, two pairs of wings, and a pair of forceps-like cerci. They are about long. The second tarsal segment, which is located on the leg, is lobed, extending distally below the third tarsal segment. The antenna consists of 11–14 segments, and the mouth parts are of the chewing type.

An anatomical diagram of the common earwig can be found to the right. Section A represents the head, B represents the thorax, and C represents the abdomen. The numbers correspond to different body parts. 1 is pointing to the pronotum (a plate-like structure that covers the thorax), and 2 is pointing to the elytra (tough outer wings used to protect the more delicate hind wings). 3 is pointing to the delicate hind wings peeking out, and 4 is pointing to the abdomen. 5 is pointing to the cerci (paired appendages on the abdomen of many insects).

== Taxonomy ==

A detailed analysis of mitochondial DNA from specimens across Europe has established that &quot;Forficula auriculata&quot; is a complex of several morphologically indistinguishable species. There are at least four species in the &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; complex: &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot;, &quot;Forficula dentata&quot;, &quot;Forficula mediterranea&quot;, and &quot;Forficula aeolica&quot;.

The name &quot;Forficula auriculata&quot; applies to those found in Scandinavia and Central Europe, whereas &quot;Forficula dentata&quot; is the usual species found in the British Isles and Western Europe. There are several other members of the complex distinguished based on mitochondrial haplotypes.In North America, European earwigs were found to comprise two sibling species, which are reproductively isolated. Populations in cold continental climates mostly have one clutch per year, forming &quot;Forficula auriculata&quot; whereas those in warmer climates have two clutches per year, forming &quot;Forficula&quot; &quot;dentata&quot;.

==Distribution==
Originating in Europe, western Asia and possibly North Africa, &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; was introduced to North America in the early twentieth century and has since spread throughout much of the continent. It was accidentally introduced into New Zealand by Early European settlers. European earwigs are most commonly found in temperate climates, since they were originally discovered in the Palearctic region, and are most active when the daily temperature has minimal fluctuation.

== Habitat ==
Thriving in cool, moist habitats, European earwigs exhibit optimal growth at a mean temperature of . Their daily abundance in a given year has been linked to factors such as temperature, wind velocity, and the prevalence of easterly winds. The development of European earwigs also depends on temperature. The occurrence of European earwigs can be predicted based on weather parameters. Hibernating adults can tolerate cool temperatures, but their survival is reduced in poorly drained soils such as clay. To avoid excessive moisture, they seek the southern side of well-drained slopes. Sometimes they also occupy the hollow stems of flowers where the soil is poorly drained. Their eggs are capable of resisting damage from cold and heat.

==Behavior==
European earwigs spend the daytime in cool, dark, inaccessible places, such as flowers, fruits, and wood crevices. They are primarily active at night, seeking out food ranging from plant matter to small insects. Though they are omnivorous, they are considered as scavengers rather than predators. Often they consume plant matter, though they have also been known to feed on aphids, spiders, insect eggs, and dead plants and insects, among other things. Their favorite plants include the common crucifer &quot;Sisymbrium officinale&quot;, the white clover &quot;Trifolium repens&quot;, and the dahlia &quot;Dahlia variabilis&quot;. They also like to feed on molasses, as well as on nonvascular plants, lichens and algae. They prefer meat or sugar to natural plant material even though plants are a major natural food source. European earwigs prefer aphids to plant material such as leaves and fruit slices of apple, cherry and pear. Adults eat more insects than do nymphs.

Although &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; have well-developed wings, they are fairly weak and are rarely, if ever, used. Instead, as their main form of transportation, earwigs are carried from one place to another on clothing or commercial products like lumber, ornamental shrubs and even newspaper bundles.

==Reproduction==

=== Courtship ===

Courtship in European common earwigs is unique in the sense that both males and females take active roles in courtship. Unlike most earwig species, detailed observations of the courtship and mating processes in &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; reveal complex sexual behaviors for both the males and females. The European earwig possesses sexually dimorphic cerci (forceps). Adult males are polymorphic in body weight and head width, as well as cercus length and width. The males have large, heavy, curved forceps that are very robust and broadened basally with teeth. Females have straight and slender forceps that are 3 mm long, and are less robust and straighter. Studies have demonstrated the significance of these cerci for use as displays in early courtship and as a tactile stimulus for the female during copulation, as well as feeding and self-defense purposes.

Early courtship typically consists of male displays in which they wave or bob the cerci. The common earwigs do not have a sex pheromone because they already have an aggregation pheromone which already brings the male and female insects into close proximity with one another.

Courtship will then progress to tactile stimulation by the males and sometimes females, if they are receptive. The males tend to use their cerci to stroke and encircle the female’s body. Both sexes participate in waving, bobbing, and stroking movements, but only males use their forceps to encircle the female. It is interesting to note that the cerci seem to be strictly used for courtship/stimulation and defense against any potential threats; the males do not ever use the forceps aggressively as claspers to hold the female in place during copulation.

The cerci stimulation is followed by abdomen arching, bobbing, and twisting before copulation occurs. Research suggests that male cerci are necessary for reproductive success because of their role as either secondary sexual characteristics for courtship or as weapons in altercations; males with their cerci removed were unable to successfully find a mate.

=== Copulation ===
A male finds prospective mates by olfaction. After a complex courtship performance by both the male and female, the male slips his cerci under the tip of the female&#x27;s abdomen so that his and her ventral abdominal surfaces are in contact with each other, while both face in opposite directions. If not disturbed, pairs can stay in this mating position for many hours. During copulation, the females often move around and feed. Because they provide brood care, female &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; have intensive nutritional requirements which likely motivates their activity during copulation—especially because female European earwigs rarely ever feed during oviposition (laying of the eggs), incubation, and brood care. Matings occurred frequently among clustered individuals particularly in locations that allow both partners to cling to a surface. Under laboratory conditions, the mating season peaked during August and September, and a single mating event enabled females to lay fertilized eggs.

== Maternal care ==
European earwig nymphs look very similar to their adult counterparts except that they are a lighter color. The young go through four nymphal stages and do not leave the nest until after the first moult.

European earwigs overwinter about below the surface of the ground. The female earwig lays a clutch of about 50 eggs in an underground nest in the autumn. She enters a dormant state and stays in the nest with the eggs.

Common earwigs exhibit varying levels of maternal care. Female earwigs typically show maternal care through behaviors such as guarding and tending to their eggs and nymphs. The female cares for her young by shifting the eggs about and continuously cleaning them with her mouth and forceps to avoid fungal growth and pathogens through careful extraction of fungal spores from the eggs. She protects the eggs by staying close to the nest, fiercely defending against predators, applying chemical protection against desiccation through egg grooming, and relocating the entire clutch under stressful conditions. Their protection of the eggs involves remaining close to the nest and defending against potential predators.

In the spring, she spreads them out into a single layer and the young emerge from the eggs. After the eggs hatch in the spring, the mother continues to care for the nymphs, providing protection, grooming, food, and sometimes even regulating the temperature in the nest. The mother provides food from the larval stage to the first instar (term for a developmental stage in insects) and will continue to defend the aggregated family group in the burrow and on nocturnal foraging excursions. She guards them until they reach maturity after about one month. It is possible for the female to lay a second brood in one season and by the end of August all of the young reach maturity.

== Life cycle ==

European common earwigs can produce either one or two broods per year. Females and males often hibernate together in pairs in underground nests. Females oviposit, or lay, their eggs at the end of winter/ beginning of spring and then expel the male from the nest. These eggs are pale yellow or cream colored and have an elliptical shape. 

The mother incubates and cares for the eggs until they hatch. After hatching, the nymphs go through four nymphal instars before reaching maturity and adulthood.

There are two distinct phases of the common earwig’s life: the nesting phase and the free-foraging phase. In the nesting phase, family units consist of the male and female pair and then just the female and her nymphs. They may leave the nest at night for foraging excursions, but the mother and her nymphs return to the nest and stay there during the daytime. In the free-foraging phase, different family units will interact, and the nymphs no longer return to their nests after foraging. Instead, they go on long foraging excursions and shelter in trees and crevices. At this point, females may produce a second brood since they have finished raising and tending to the first brood.

== Selfish vs. altruistic behavior ==
Maternal care can drastically increase the survival and development of young earwigs, contributing to their overall reproductive success. However, parental care can be costly as well. It is widely accepted that relations between parents and offspring are shaped by an intersection of selfish and altruistic tendencies that ultimately reflect a compromise of each individual’s evolutionary interests. The common earwigs, as well as any species, have to carefully weigh the increased offspring survival benefits and the potential parental fecundity costs associated with parental care. 

One explicit form of altruistic behavior in common earwigs is the fact that females do not reject foreign offspring or eggs and will exhibit the same level of care to foreign eggs as her own eggs. In many species, kin bias prevents parents from investing care and energy into any foreign offspring in order to allow them to more effectively invest in their own offspring thus ensuring that their own genes are passed on. Common earwig mothers, however, will not eliminate foreign eggs and will actually groom, defend, and provide for them to the same extent at which she cares for her own eggs. A likely explanation would be that common earwig mothers simply cannot differentiate between their own eggs and foreign eggs, but this is not the case. Common earwig mothers immediately and regularly apply a bouquet of cuticular hydrocarbons to the surface of their eggs. This bouquet is family specific and allows for differentiation between the mother&#x27;s own eggs and foreign eggs. This phenomenon indicates that there is limited selection pressures promoting female common earwigs to reject foreign eggs which allows them to display the altruistic behavior of caring for foreign offspring.

== Aggregation ==

European common earwigs aggregate in shelters during the day in groups ranging from 50 to 100 individuals per square meter. Common earwigs seek out dark and humid shelters for use, and they prefer shelters that have been occupied previously due to the presence of an aggregation pheromone. Unfortunately, they have become relatively harmful pests in residential areas—damaging fruits, vegetables, flowers, and some tree fruit crops. Scientists hope to uncover the necessary components of the European common earwig aggregation pheromone because this could allow them to manufacture synthetic aggregation pheromones to use as bait to draw them away from crops and gardens.

===Pheromones===
Males, females, and nymphs of the &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; species produce aggregation pheromones that trigger specific behavioral responses from members of the same species regardless of their sex or developmental stage. Research shows that common earwigs display significant behavioral responses to both physically accessible and physically inaccessible stimuli. This indicates that common earwigs detect and respond to this aggregation pheromone through olfaction rather than through a mechanism such as contact chemoreception. This helps the earwigs detect shelters to hide in during the daytime after their nocturnal foraging excursions.

Scientists believe that common earwigs produce this aggregation pheromone in their tibial glands, cuticular lipids, or fecal matter. Males, females, and nymphs all exhibit strong responses to the aggregation pheromone. However, there is mounting evidence that the aggregation pheromones are stage-specific meaning depending on the chemical contents of the particular pheromone, it will be more likely to attract either nymphs or adults. Benzoquinones are a component of the aggregation pheromone that attracts adult common earwigs. The same was not true for nymph-stage common earwigs which responded well to experimental aggregation pheromones with and without the benzoquinones.

== Coprophagy ==
Group living comes with many benefits but also many costs. One example is the accumulation of feces in a shared nesting site which can become a breeding ground for a wide variety of fungi and pathogenic bacteria or attract predators and help them locate the nest. Risks escalate in nest-dwelling species that aggregate in large groups such as &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot;. However, keeping feces in the nesting site has actually proved advantageous for &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; despite these concerns. Feces possess antimicrobial properties that can prevent the growth of certain dangerous pathogens. Keeping feces in the nest also fosters allo-coprophagy (consumption of the feces of other members of one’s species) which can have positive effects such as promoting the transfer of helpful gut bacteria and providing a food source when food is scarce. In fact, access to sibling feces significantly enhanced the survival rate of nymphs when food was scarce. However, regardless of the scarcity of regular food, nymphs always consume some maternal or nymphal feces which implies that this behavior in earwigs has evolved to have many incentives and is not just a desperate measure to prevent starvation in cases of food scarcity.

== Agricultural impact ==

&quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; has been known to cause significant damage to crops, flowers, and fruit orchards when at high population levels. Some of the commercially valuable vegetables it feeds upon include cabbage, cauliflower, chard, celery, lettuce, potato, beet, and cucumber among others. Earwigs readily consume corn (maize) silk and can damage the crop. Among fruits, they have been found to damage apple and pear orchards. On apple trees specifically, &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; feed on the fruits (primarily on parts where the fruit is already rotting or cracked) and contaminate the fruits with frass (powdery wood debris that is the result of insect foraging/ boring). They damage young plum and peach trees in early spring when other food is scarce by devouring blossoms and leaves at night. They are often found wedged among petals of fresh cut carnations, roses, dahlia and zinnia.

In addition to the agricultural problems caused, &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; emit a foul odor and have a tendency to aggregate together in or near human dwellings.

== Human interaction ==
Control of &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; has been attempted using some of its natural enemies, including the parasitoid fly &quot;Bigonicheta spinipenni&quot;, the fungi &quot;Erynia forficulae&quot; and &quot;Metarhizium anisopliae&quot;, as well as many species of birds. &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; are host to the nematode &quot;Mermis nigrescens&quot; which have the ability to manipulate their hosts to seek water. The tachinid flies &quot;Triarthria setipennis&quot; (Fallen) and &quot;Ocytata pallipes&quot; have been introduced in North America to control &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; in the 1920s.

Insecticides have also been successfully implemented, although commercial products are rarely targeted specifically towards earwigs. Multipurpose insecticides for control of earwigs, grasshoppers, sowbugs and other insects are more common. Diazinon, an organophosphate insecticide, has been known to continue killing &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; up to 17 days after initial spraying.

Humans have, however, found beneficial uses of &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; in the pest management of other insects. The European common earwig is an omnivore and is also referred to as a generalist predator or scavenger meaning they have many different forms of prey and will feed on whichever prey species is most available. The European earwig is a natural predator of a number of other agricultural pests, including the pear psyllid and several aphid species, and in this regard has been used to control outbreaks of such organisms. The common earwig is an important predator of many different orchard/ crop pests such as the wooly apple aphid (&quot;Eriosoma lanigerum&quot;) which is one of the most problematic pests in apple orchards. Research has repeatedly shown that low numbers of common earwigs are associated with wooly apple aphid infestations whereas high numbers of common earwigs lead to decreased aphid populations in orchards so much so that farmers sometimes do not even need to use chemicals or pesticides. Therefore, despite their potential adverse effects on some crops, European common earwigs play a crucial role in managing wooly aphid apple populations in apple orchards. Damage to crops by &quot;Forficula auricularia&quot; is limited as long as there are high population levels of their insect prey.

<text>Saint-Aubin-du-Pavail (; ) is a former commune in the Ille-et-Vilaine department in Brittany in northwestern France. On 1 January 2017, it was merged into the commune Châteaugiron.

The name Saint-Aubin-du-Pavail comes from Saint Aubin, bishop of Angers in the 6th century. The term &quot;Pavail&quot; indicates the paving stone of the Gallo-Roman way which crossed the commune.

==History==
The church of Saint-Aubin-du-Pavail is mentioned for the first time in the mid-11th century: Brient, seigneurs of Chateaubriant, gave the tithe church of Saint-Aubin to the Abbey of Marmoutier, at the time of the foundation of the priory of Béré. The donation was confirmed in 1217, but the parish of Saint-Aubin-du-Pavail is in reality attested only since 1245. It depended formerly on the old bishopric of Rennes. The seigneurie of Saint-Aubin-of-Pavail was the concern of the barony of Châteaugiron. It passes by alliance at the end of 15th century to the lords of Boisorcan, who linked it with their châtellenie in 1583.

==Sights==

The two chapels forming the transept were built in the north and the south of the building in respectively the 16th century and in 1607. The nave which shows the dates to be 1607 and 1620 was lengthened in 1853. Two sacristies were built in 1863 and 1864. The bell dates back to 1732. The baptismal font goes back to 1855

<doc id="675311" wikidata="Q1240482" url="?curid=675311" title="Donald Davies">
<text>Donald Watts Davies, (7 June 1924 – 28 May 2000) was a Welsh computer scientist and Internet pioneer who was employed at the UK National Physical Laboratory (NPL).

During 1965-67 he invented modern data communications, including packet switching, high-speed routers, layered communication protocols, hierarchical computer networks and the essence of the end-to-end principle, concepts that are used today in computer networks worldwide. He envisioned, in 1966, that there would be a &quot;single network&quot; for data and telephone communications. Davies proposed and studied a commercial national data network in the United Kingdom and designed and built the first implementation of packet switching in the local-area NPL network in 1966-69 to demonstrate the technology. Many of the wide-area packet-switched networks built in the late 1960s and 1970s were similar &quot;in nearly all respects&quot; to his original 1965 design. Davies&#x27; work influenced the ARPANET in the United States and the CYCLADES project in France, and was key to the development of the data communications technology used in Internet, which is a network of networks.

Davies&#x27; work was independent of the work of Paul Baran in the United States who had some similar ideas in the early 1960s, and who also provided input to the ARPANET project, after his work was highlighted by Davies&#x27; team.

==Early life==
Davies was born in Treorchy in the Rhondda Valley, Wales. His father, a clerk at a coalmine, died a few months later, and his mother took Donald and his twin sister back to her home town of Portsmouth, where he went to school. He attended the Southern Grammar School for Boys.

He received a BSc degree in physics (1943) at Imperial College London, and then joined the war effort working as an assistant to Klaus Fuchs on the nuclear weapons Tube Alloys project at Birmingham University. He then returned to Imperial taking a first class degree in mathematics (1947); he was also awarded the Lubbock memorial Prize as the outstanding mathematician of his year.

In 1955, he married Diane Burton; they had a daughter and two sons.

==Career history==

===National Physical Laboratory===
From 1947, he worked at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) at Teddington, just outside London, where Alan Turing was designing the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) computer. It is said that Davies spotted mistakes in Turing&#x27;s seminal 1936 paper &quot;On Computable Numbers&quot;, much to Turing&#x27;s annoyance. These were perhaps some of the first &quot;programming&quot; bugs in existence, even if they were for a theoretical computer, the universal Turing machine. The ACE project was overambitious and floundered, leading to Turing&#x27;s departure. Davies took over the project and concentrated on delivering the less ambitious Pilot ACE computer, which first worked in May 1950. A commercial spin-off, DEUCE was manufactured by English Electric Computers and became one of the best-selling machines of the 1950s.

Davies also worked on applications of traffic simulation and machine translation. In the early 1960s, he worked on government technology initiatives designed to stimulate the British computer industry.

===Packet switching===

In 1965, Davies became interested in data communications following a seminar he gave at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He saw that a significant problem with the new time-sharing computer systems was the cost of keeping a phone connection open for each user. Davies&#x27; key insight came in the realisation that computer network traffic was inherently &quot;bursty&quot; in nature with periods of silence, compared with relatively constant telephone traffic. He applied the principle of time-sharing to the data communications line as well as the computer to invent the concept of what he called packet switching. Davies forecast today&#x27;s &quot;killer app&quot; for his new communication service:

Davies proposed dividing computer messages into very &quot;short messages in fixed format&quot; that are routed independently across a network, with differing routes allowed for related packets, which are reassembled at the destination. Davies used the word &quot;packet&quot; after consulting with a linguist because it was capable of being translated into languages other than English without compromise.

The following year, he returned to work at the NPL, where he became Superintendent of the Computer Science Division and transformed its computing activity. He designed and proposed a commercial national data network based on packet switching in his 1966 &quot;Proposal for the Development of a National Communications Service for On-line Data Processing&quot;. This work was the first to describe the concept of high-speed &quot;switching nodes&quot;, today known as routers as well as &quot;interface computers&quot;. Davies applied queueing theory to show that &quot;there is an ample margin between the estimated performance of the [packet-switched] system and the stated requirement&quot; in terms of a satisfactory response time for a human user. This addressed a key question about the viability of computer networking. In this paper, he predicted there would be a &quot;single network&quot; for data and telephone communications:

Davies and his team were the first to write communication protocols in a modern data-commutation context in an April 1967 memorandum &quot;A Protocol for Use in the NPL Data Communications Network&quot; written by Roger Scantlebury and Keith Bartlett.

His work on packet switching, presented by Scantlebury, initially caught the attention of the developers of the ARPANET, a U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) network, at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967. The proposed network design was based on a hierarchical structure, with &quot;local networks&quot; communicating with a &quot;high level network&quot;. To deal with packet permutations (due to dynamically updated route preferences) and datagram losses (unavoidable when fast sources send to a slow destinations), he assumed that &quot;all users of the network will provide themselves with some kind of error control&quot;, thus inventing what came to be known as the end-to-end principle. In Scantlebury&#x27;s report following the conference, he noted &quot;It would appear that the ideas in the NPL paper at the moment are more advanced than any proposed in the USA&quot;. Larry Roberts, of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD), applied Davies&#x27; concepts of packet switching for the ARPANET, which went on to become a predecessor to the Internet. 

In July 1968, NPL put on a demonstration of real and simulated networks at an event organised by the Real Time Club at the Royal Festival Hall in London. Davies first presented his own ideas on packet switching at a conference in Edinburgh on 5 August 1968. In 1969, Davies was invited to Japan to lecture on packet switching. He gave a series of nine three-hour lectures, concluding with an intense discussion with around 80 people. 

During 1968-9, Davies directed the construction of the network, elements of which went live in early 1969, the first implementation of packet switching in the world. The local-area &quot;Mark I NPL network&quot;, became fully operational in January 1970. It was upgraded to the &quot;Mark II&quot; in 1973 with a layered protocol architecture, and remained in operation until 1986. The NPL team also carried out simulation work on packet networks, studying datagrams and network congestion in wide-area networks of a scale to facilitate data communications across the United Kingdom. These early years of computer resource sharing were documented in the 1972 film &quot;Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing&quot;. Davies&#x27; original ideas influenced other research around the world, including Louis Pouzin&#x27;s CYCLADES project in France. 

In a 1978 special edition of the Proceedings of the IEEE on packet switching, Bob Kahn, the guest editor, quoted Davies&#x27; reflections on ten years of experience with packet communication networks:

=== Internetworking ===
Davies, along with Derek Barber, his deputy, and Roger Scantlebury, conducted research into protocols for internetworking. They participated in the International Network Working Group from 1972, initially chaired by Vint Cerf and later by Barber. Davies and Scantlebury were acknowledged by Cerf and Bob Kahn in their seminal 1974 paper on internetworking, &quot;A Protocol for Packet Network Intercommunication&quot;.

Davies and Barber published &quot;Communication networks for computers&quot; in 1973. They spoke at the Data Communications Symposium in 1975 about the &quot;battle for access standards&quot; between datagrams and virtual circuits, with Barber saying the &quot;lack of standard access interfaces for emerging public packet-switched communication networks is creating &#x27;some kind of monster&#x27; for users&quot;.

Internetworking experiments at NPL under Davies included connecting with the European Informatics Network (EIN) by translating between two different host protocols and connecting with the Post Office Experimental Packet Switched Service (EPSS) using a common host protocol in both networks. Their research confirmed establishing a common host protocol would be more reliable and efficient than translating between different host protocols using a gateway. Davies published &quot;Computer networks and their protocols&quot; in 1979, in which he notes:

For a long period of time, the network engineering community was polarized over the implementation of competing protocol suites, a debate commonly called the &quot;Protocol Wars&quot;. It was unclear which type of protocol would result in the best and most robust computer networks.

===Computer network security===
Davies relinquished his management responsibilities in 1979 to return to research. He became particularly interested in computer network security and his research on cryptography led to a number of patents, including methods for providing secure communication to enable the use of smart cards.

He retired from NPL in 1984, becoming a leading consultant on data security to the banking industry and publishing a book on the topic that year. Together with David O. Clayden, he designed the Message Authenticator Algorithm (MAA) in 1983, one of the first message authentication code algorithms to gain widespread acceptance. It was adopted as international standard ISO 8731-2 in 1987.

=== Later career ===
In 1987, Davies became a visiting professor at Royal Holloway and Bedford New College.

=== Epilogue ===
Unbeknown to Davies at first, Paul Baran of the RAND Corporation in the United States had also worked on a similar concept in the early 1960s, although designed for voice communication using low-cost electronics without communication protocols. When Davies became aware of Baran&#x27;s work in 1966 he acknowledged that they both had equally discovered the concept of packet switching and Davies and his team referenced Baran&#x27;s earlier published work. 

Baran was happy to acknowledge that Davies had come up with the same idea as him independently. In an email to Davies, he wrote:

Leonard Kleinrock, a contemporary working on analysing message delays using queueing theory, developed a mathematical model for the operation of message switching networks in his PhD thesis during 1961-2, published as a book in 1964. However, Kleinrock&#x27;s later claim to have developed the theoretical basis of packet switching networks is disputed by other Internet pioneers, including by Robert Taylor, Baran and Davies.

== Legacy ==
Donald Davies and Paul Baran are recognized by historians and the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the Internet.

Larry Roberts said the computer networks built in the 1970s were similar &quot;in nearly all respects&quot; to Davies&#x27; original 1965 design. Davies&#x27; work on data communications and computer network design has been described as the &quot;cornerstone&quot; technology used in the development of the Internet, which is a global system of connected computer networks (a network of networks).

==Awards and honours==
Davies was appointed a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (BCS) in 1975 and was made a CBE in 1983, and later a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1987.

He received the John Player Award from the BCS in 1974. and was awarded a medal by the John von Neumann Computer Society in Hungary in 1985.

In 2000, Davies shared the inaugural IEEE Internet Award. In 2007, he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, and in 2012 Davies was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.

Davies received a lifetime achievement award in 2001 for his research into secure communications for smart cards.

NPL sponsors a gallery, opened in 2009, about the development of packet switching and &quot;Technology of the Internet&quot; at The National Museum of Computing.

A blue plaque commemorating Davies was unveiled in Treorchy in July 2013.

== Family ==
Davies was survived by his wife Diane, a daughter, two sons and four grandchildren.

<text>A bowling green is a finely laid, close-mown and rolled stretch of turf for playing the game of bowls.

Before 1830, when Edwin Beard Budding of Thrupp, near Stroud, UK, invented the lawnmower, lawns were often kept cropped by grazing sheep on them. The world&#x27;s oldest surviving bowling green is the Southampton Old Bowling Green, which was first used in 1299.

When the French adopted &quot;boulingrin&quot; in the 17th century, it was understood to mean a sunk geometrically shaped piece of perfect grass, framed in gravel walks, which often formed the centre of a regularly planted wood called a &quot;bosquet&quot;, somewhat like a highly formalized glade; it might have a central pool or fountain.

The diarist Samuel Pepys relates a conversation he had with the architect Hugh May:
==Dimensions and other specifications==
Bowling green specifications for the lawn bowls variation of the sport are stipulated in World Bowls&#x27; Laws of the Sport of Bowls. For the variant known as crown green bowls, no such stipulation is documented by the national governing body and bowls clubs are free to form the dimensions and other specifications as they feel fit. Generally a &quot;crown green&quot; has just that: a crown or raised centre section with the outer edges of the green dropping off towards the surrounding ditch.
Other greens are generally as level as possible.

Several games of bowls can be played on a bowling green at the same time. The number of games depends on the dimensions of the green. Each game is played on its own portion of the green. These divided portions of the green are called rinks.

The length of a green in the direction of play will be between 31 metres and 40 metres. The green should have a suitable level playing surface made of grass or of an approved synthetic material.

The green is surrounded by a ditch between 200 millimetres and 380 millimetres wide, and between 50 millimetres and 200 millimetres deep. The ditch has a bank against its outer edge. The top of the bank should be at least 230 millimetres about the surface level of the green.

Generally, greens are built in a square shape as close to 40 metres as possible. This allows for games to be played in either direction. The advantages of playing in different directions are that: the wear on the green is more even, and; the players do not need to face towards the sun when playing.

In cities, where outdoor space is limited, greens are rarely 40 metres in length (they are generally still square, however).

It is not unusual to find greens that are rectangular in shape. On rectangular greens games are played in one direction only. The length of a rectangular green is still between 31 metres and 40 metres. The width can vary from as little as 8 metres (enough for one rink) to as much as 60 metres or more.

The width of a rink for outdoor play will be between 4.3 metres and 5.8 metres (for indoor play the minimum width of a rink is 4.6 metres). The centre line of the rink can be marked along the surface of the green starting at 2 metres from each end ditch. The side boundaries of each rink are shown by boundary pegs. The side boundary of the outside rink (also called a ditch rink) should be at least 600 millimetres from the side ditch (460 millimetres for indoor greens).

<text>Immanuel Maurice Wallerstein (; September 28, 1930 – August 31, 2019) was an American sociologist and economic historian. He is perhaps best known for his development in sociology of world-systems approach. He was a Senior Research Scholar at Yale University from 2000 until his death in 2019, and published bimonthly syndicated commentaries through Agence Global on world affairs from October 1998 to July 2019.

He was the 13th president of International Sociological Association (1994–1998).

==Personal life and education==
His parents, Sara Günsberg (born in 1895) and Menachem Lazar Wallerstein (born in 1890), were Polish Jews from Galicia who moved to Berlin, because of World War I, where they married in 1919. Two years later, Sara gave birth to their first son, Solomon. In 1923, the Wallerstein family emigrated to New York, where Immanuel was born. On the &quot;list of alien passengers for the United States&quot; at the time of his family&#x27;s emigration, the nationality of his mother and brother was described as Polish.

Having grown up in a politically conscious family, Wallerstein first became interested in world affairs as a teenager. He received all three of his degrees from Columbia University: a BA in 1951, an MA in 1954, and a PhD in 1959, where he completed his dissertation under the supervision of Hans L. Zetterberg and Robert Staughton Lynd. However, throughout his life, Wallerstein also studied at other universities around the world, including Oxford University from 1955 to 1956, Université libre de Bruxelles, Universite Paris 7 Denis Diderot, and Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.

From 1951 to 1953 Wallerstein served in the U.S. Army. After his discharge, he wrote a master&#x27;s thesis on McCarthyism as a phenomenon of American political culture. The widely cited work, as Wallerstein himself later stated, &quot;confirmed my sense that I should consider myself, in the language of the 1950s, a &#x27;political sociologist.

Wallerstein married Beatrice Friedman in 1964, and had a daughter, Katharine Wallerstein, two years later. He was stepfather to Beatrice&#x27;s two children from a previous marriage, Susan Morgenstern and Robert Morgenstern. He and Beatrice had five grandchildren.

== Academic career ==
During his time at Columbia University he was a supporter of students who were active during Columbia University protests of 1968 opposing the university&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War.

Originally, Wallerstein&#x27;s principal sub-area of study was not American affairs, but the politics of the non-European world, specifically India and Africa. For two decades Wallerstein researched Africa, publishing numerous books and articles, and in 1973 he became president of the African Studies Association.

== Professional career ==
Wallerstein&#x27;s academic career began at Columbia University where he was an instructor and then associate professor of sociology from 1958 to 1971. From there he moved to McGill University, in Montreal where he taught from 1971 to 1976. His reputation preceded him became distinguished professor of sociology at SUNY Binghamton University from 1976 to 1999.

In 1976 Wallerstein was offered the unique opportunity to pursue a new avenue of research, and so became head of the Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems and Civilization at Binghamton University in New York, whose mission was &quot;to engage in the analysis of large-scale social change over long periods of historical time&quot;. The Center opened with the publishing support of a new journal, &quot;Review&quot;, (of which Wallerstein was the founding editor), and produced a body of work that &quot;went a long way toward invigorating sociology and its sister disciplines, especially history and political-economy&quot;. Wallerstein served as a distinguished professor of sociology at SUNY-Binghamton until his retirement in 1999.

During his career Wallerstein held visiting-professor posts in Hong Kong, British Columbia, and Amsterdam, among numerous others. He was awarded multiple honorary titles, intermittently served as Directeur d&#x27;études associé at the École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales in Paris, and served as president of the International Sociological Association between 1994 and 1998. At this time he also held a titled professorship at New York University and lectured at Columbia University. Similarly, during the 1990s he chaired the Gulbenkian Commission on the Restructuring of the Social Sciences, whose object was to indicate a direction for social scientific inquiry for the next 50 years.

Between 2000 and his death in 2019, Wallerstein worked as a senior research scholar at Yale University. He was also a member of the Advisory Editors Council of the &quot;Social Evolution &amp; History&quot; journal. In 2003, he received the &quot;Career of Distinguished Scholarship Award&quot; from the American Sociological Association, and in 2004 the International N. D. Kondratieff Foundation and the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (RAEN) awarded him the Gold Kondratieff Medal. Wallerstein died on August 31, 2019, from an infection, at the age of 88.

During his time as a lecturer some of the students in attendance recalled him as &quot;a calm, reserved, elegant man&quot;. When taking criticism for his thesis, he would usually be calm and collected. As well as hinting at the fact that he was almost disappointed for the people or audience for not fully comprehending what he wished to establish.

==Theory==
Wallerstein began as an expert on post-colonial African affairs, which he selected as the focus of his studies after attending international youth conferences in 1951 and 1952. His publications focused almost exclusively on this topic until the early 1970s, when he began to distinguish himself as a historian and theorist of the global capitalist economy on a macroscopic level. His early criticism of global capitalism and championship of &quot;anti-systemic movements&quot; made him an &quot;éminence grise&quot; with the anti-globalization movement within and outside of the academic community, along with Noam Chomsky (1928- ) and Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002).

Wallerstein&#x27;s most important work, &quot;The Modern World-System&quot;, appeared in four volumes between 1974 and 2011. In it, Wallerstein drew on several intellectual influences. From Karl Marx, Wallerstein took the underlying emphasis on economic factors and their dominance over ideological factors in global politics, and such ideas as the dichotomy between capital and labor, while criticizing deterministic or teleological Marxian views of world economic development through stages such as feudalism and capitalism. From dependency theory, he took the key concepts of &quot;core&quot; and &quot;periphery&quot;.

However, Wallerstein named Frantz Fanon (1925-1961), Fernand Braudel (1902-1985), and Ilya Prigogine (1917-2003) as the three individuals who exerted the greatest influence &quot;in modifying my line of argument (as opposed to deepening a parallel line of argument).&quot; In &quot;The Essential Wallerstein&quot;, he stated that: &quot;Fanon represented for me the expression of the insistence by those disenfranchised by the modern world‑system that they have a voice, a vision, and a claim not merely to justice but to intellectual valuation.&quot;; that Braudel, for his description of the development and political implications of extensive networks of economic exchange in the European world between 1400 and 1800, &quot;more than anyone else made me conscious of the central importance of the social construction of time and space and its impact on our analyses.&quot;; and that &quot;Prigogine forced me to face the implications of a world in which certainties did not exist – but knowledge still did.&quot;

Wallerstein also stated that another major influence on his work was the &quot;world revolution&quot; of 1968. A member of the faculty of Columbia University at the time of the student protests, he participated in a faculty committee that attempted to resolve the dispute. He argued in several works that this revolution marked the end of &quot;liberalism&quot; as a viable ideology in the modern world system. He also argued that the end of the Cold War, rather than marking a triumph for liberalism, indicates that the current system has entered its &#x27;end&#x27; phase: a period of crisis that will end only when it is replaced by another system. Wallerstein anticipated the growing importance of the North–South divide at a time when the main world conflict was the Cold War.

Wallerstein was often mocked for arguing since 1980 that the United States is a &quot;hegemon in decline&quot;, but since the Iraq War this argument has become more widespread. During this time, Wallerstein also argued that the development of the capitalist world economy was detrimental to a large proportion of the world&#x27;s population. Like Marx, Wallerstein predicted that capitalism will be replaced by a socialist economy, a view held in the 1970s, but reassessed in the 1980s. He concluded that the successor system(s) is unknowable.

Wallerstein both participated in and wrote about the World Social Forum.

===&quot;The Modern World-System&quot;===

Wallerstein&#x27;s first volume on world-systems theory (&quot;The Modern World System&quot;, 1974) was predominantly written during a year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (now affiliated with Stanford University). In it, he argues that the modern world system is distinguished from empires by its reliance on economic control of the world order by a dominating capitalist center (core) in systemic economic and political relation to peripheral and semi-peripheral world areas.

Wallerstein rejected the notion of a &quot;Third World&quot;, claiming that there is only one world connected by a complex network of economic exchange relationships — i.e., a &quot;world-economy&quot; or &quot;world-system&quot; in which the &quot;dichotomy of capital and labor&quot; and the endless &quot;accumulation of capital&quot; by competing agents (historically including, but not limited, to nation-states) account for frictions. This approach is known as the world-system theory.

Wallerstein located the origin of the modern world-system in 16th-century Western Europe and the Americas. An initially slight advance in capital accumulation in Britain, the Dutch Republic, and France, due to specific political circumstances at the end of the period of feudalism, set in motion a process of gradual expansion. As a result, only one global network or system of economic exchange exists in modern society. By the 19th century, virtually every area on earth was incorporated into the capitalist world-economy.

The capitalist world-system is far from homogeneous in cultural, political, and economic terms; instead, it is characterized by fundamental differences in social development, accumulation of political power, and capital. Contrary to affirmative theories of modernization and capitalism, Wallerstein did not conceive of these differences as mere residues or irregularities that can and will be overcome as the system evolves.

A lasting division of the world into &quot;core&quot;, &quot;semi-periphery&quot;, and &quot;periphery&quot; is an inherent feature of world-system theory. Other theories, partially drawn on by Wallerstein, leave out the semi-periphery and do not allow for a grayscale of development. Areas which have so far remained outside the reach of the world-system enter it at the stage of &quot;periphery&quot;. There is a fundamental and institutionally stabilized &quot;division of labor&quot; between core and periphery: while the core has a high level of technological development and manufactures complex products, the role of the periphery is to supply raw materials, agricultural products, and cheap labor for the expanding agents of the core. Economic exchange between core and periphery takes place on unequal terms: the periphery is forced to sell its products at low prices, but has to buy the core&#x27;s products at comparatively high prices. Once established, this unequal state tends to stabilize itself due to inherent, quasi-deterministic constraints. The statuses of core and periphery are not exclusive and fixed geographically, but are relative to each other. A zone defined as &quot;semi-periphery&quot; acts as a periphery to the core and as a core to the periphery. At the end of the 20th century, this zone would comprise Eastern Europe, China, Brazil, and Mexico. It is important to note that core and peripheral zones can co-exist in the same location.

One effect of the expansion of the world-system is the commodification of things, including human labor. Natural resources, land, labor, and human relationships are gradually being stripped of their &quot;intrinsic&quot; value and turned into commodities in a market which determines their exchange value.

In the last two decades of his life, Wallerstein increasingly focused on the intellectual foundations of the modern world-system and the pursuit of universal theories of human behavior. In addition, he showed interest in the &quot;structures of knowledge&quot; defined by the disciplinary division between sociology, anthropology, political science, economics, and the humanities, which he himself regarded as Eurocentric. In analyzing them, he was highly influenced by the &quot;new sciences&quot; of theorists like Ilya Prigogine.

===Criticism===
Wallerstein&#x27;s theory provoked harsh criticism, not only from neo-liberal or conservative circles but even from some historians who say that some of his assertions may be historically incorrect. Some critics suggest that Wallerstein tended to neglect the cultural dimension of the modern world-system, arguing that there is a world system of global culture which is independent from the economic processes of capitalism; this reduces it to what some call &quot;official&quot; ideologies of states which can then easily be revealed as mere agencies of economic interest. Nevertheless, his analytical approach, along with that of associated theorists such as Andre Gunder Frank, Terence Hopkins, Samir Amin, Christopher Chase-Dunn, Thomas D. Hall, Aníbal Quijano and Giovanni Arrighi, has made a significant impact on the field and has established an institutional base devoted to the general approach of intellectual inquiry. Their works has also attracted strong interest from the anti-globalization movement.

Arthur Stinchcombe was very critical of Wallerstein&#x27;s &quot;The Modern World-System&quot;, writing that the book presents no theoretical argument and no determinate mechanisms. Instead, the theory of the book &quot;reduces to a general imperative for the scholar to look for world system influences, perhaps wise advice but not very specific.&quot; Stinchcombe also argues that the book does not define its concepts independently of their effects, thus entailing tautologies regarding cores, peripheries and semi-peripheries.

==Terms and definitions==
===Capitalist world-system===
Wallerstein&#x27;s definition follows dependency theory, which intended to combine the developments of the different societies since the 16th century in different regions into one collective development. The main characteristic of his definition is the development of a global division of labour, including the existence of independent political units (in this case, states) at the same time. There is no political center, compared to global empires like the Roman Empire; instead, the capitalist world-system is identified by the global market economy. It is divided into core, semi-periphery, and periphery regions, and is ruled by the capitalist mode of production.

===Core/periphery===
Defines the difference between developed and developing countries, characterized e.g. by power or wealth. The core refers to developed countries, the periphery to the dependent developing countries. The main reason for the position of the developed countries is economic power. Wallerstein &quot;used the term &quot;core&quot; to suggest a multicentric region containing a group of states rather than the term &quot;center&quot;, which implies a hierarchy with a single peak.&quot;

===Semi-periphery===
Defines states that are located between core and periphery, and who benefit from the periphery through unequal exchange relations. At the same time, the core benefits from the semi-periphery through unequal exchange relations.

===Quasi-monopolies===
Defines a kind of monopoly where there is more than one service provider for a particular good/service. Wallerstein claims that quasi-monopolies are self-liquidating because new sellers go into the market by exerting political pressure to open markets to competition.

===Kondratiev waves===
A Kondratiev wave is defined as a cyclical tendency in the world&#x27;s economy. It is also known as a &quot;supercycle.&quot; Wallerstein argues that global wars are tied to Kondratiev waves. According to him, global conflicts occur as the summer phase of a wave begins, which is when production of goods and services around the world are on an upswing.

<text>Châteaubriant (; ; Gallo: &quot;Châtiaoberiant&quot;) is a town in western France, about southwest of Paris, and one of the three sous-préfectures of the Loire-Atlantique department. Châteaubriant is also situated in the historical and cultural region of Brittany, and it is the capital of the Pays de la Mée.

A part of the traditional province of Brittany, Châteaubriant also lies on the threshold of Anjou, and it was an important stronghold in northwestern France during the Middle Ages. The town appeared during the 11th century, around a castle and a priory. A fair, which still exists, was also founded in 1050. Châteaubriant played a certain role during the Mad War between France and Brittany and became a significant cultural centre in the 16th century, when the Renaissance château was built in the medieval fortress.

The town is situated between Nantes and Rennes, and tends to be economically oriented towards the latter. The medieval fair and cattle market are still important for the local economy, but Châteaubriant also developed a metallurgical industry during the 19th century, and then plastics manufacturing during the 20th century.

Châteaubriant is noteworthy for the Château de Châteaubriant, which combines a large medieval castle and a Renaissance palace. The town also has an 11th-century church and a medieval town centre, with half-timbered houses and remains of city walls. During the Second World War, Châteaubriant had a concentration camp, and it is known in France for the 27 hostages who were shot there in 1941.

==Geography==

===Location===

Châteaubriant lies at the north of the Loire-Atlantique département, in the middle of a triangle between Nantes, Angers and Rennes. The town is not situated on any of the roads that link the three cities, thus, it is somewhat isolated. The closest highway, linking Rennes to Nantes, is away.

Châteaubriant north of Ancenis, south of Rennes, north of Nantes, and west of Angers. The neighboring communes are Rougé, Saint-Aubin-des-Châteaux, Louisfert, Erbray, and Soudan.

According to the French statistical office, Châteaubriant is an urban commune, the only one in its urban unit. The metropolitan area, much wider, is made up of Châteaubriant plus several surrounding rural communes.

The commune of Châteaubriant itself encompasses not only the town, but also agricultural land and some hamlets. The main agricultural activities are forage and cereal growing, and cattle breeding (especially for beef and dairy production).

===Geology and hydrography===

The town is built in the small drainage basin of the river Chère. Several streams flow in the Chère in Châteaubriant: the Rollard, the Choisel and the Ruisseau du Pont-Pirraud. The basin is limited by several hills belonging to the central axis of the Armorican massif which forms the Breton peninsula. The highest hill is 107 metres high. Several ponds are supplied by the streams, like the Étang de Choisel and the Étang de Deil. Both were created by small dams.

The subsoil consists of old sedimentary deposits of schist and sandstone. These deposits came after the Cadomian Orogeny, and they were deformed by the tectonic activity.

===Climate===
Châteaubriant enjoys an oceanic climate with frequent but weak rain. Temperatures are mild with little variations.

===Transport===

Châteaubriant is connected to the regional major roads and to the surrounding villages by several minor roads, such as the RD 163 which connects the town to Rennes and Candé, the RD 178, which goes to Nantes, and the RD 771, linking Châteaubriant to Laval and Nozay.

Châteaubriant has its own bus company, the &quot;Castelbus&quot;. It operates a small network comprising 30 stops. The town also has a coach station served by the Loire-Atlantique coach network.

The railway station provides several departures a day to Rennes on a local line. The track continues south to Nantes, but this portion was closed in 1980. The reopening of the line to Nantes is scheduled for 2013, with a new tram-train.

==Toponymy==
Châteaubriant is a relatively young city for France, because it was not built before the 11th century. Thus, the name of the town is not mentioned before that period. &quot;Châteaubriant&quot; means &quot;Briant&#x27;s castle&quot;, and refers to Brient, the founder of the castle and of the town. Such origin is common among other French cities founded at the same period; it is for example visible on Château-Gontier, &quot;Gontier&#x27;s castle&quot;, Châteauroux, &quot;Raoul&#x27;s castle&quot;, and on Laval, which was first called &quot;Laval-Guyon&quot;, &quot;Guy&#x27;s valley&quot;. The town was first mentioned with the Latin &quot;Castrum Brieni&quot; or &quot;Castrum Brientii&quot;, and the first mention in French, in 1266, is &quot;Cheteau Brient&quot;. During the 15th century, the &quot;e&quot; of &quot;Brient&quot; became &quot;a&quot;, and the final &quot;t&quot; was often replaced with a &quot;d&quot; until the standardization of the name in the 19th century.

The standard Latin translation is &quot;Castrobriandum&quot; but the medieval forms &quot;Briandi Castrum&quot; and &quot;Brientii Castrum&quot; are still accepted. In Breton language, the town is called &quot;Kastell-Briant&quot;, and in Gallo language, the local dialect, it is called &quot;Châtiaoberiant&quot; (ABCD transcription, pronounced ).

During the French Revolution, many towns and villages which had a name with a reference to religion or feudalism had it changed. As &quot;Châteaubriant&quot; makes a reference to medieval lords, the town was renamed &quot;Montagne-sur-Chère&quot; (&quot;hill on the Chère River&quot;). The town did not keep this name for long, and it was called &quot;Châteaubriant&quot; again by 1801.

==History==

===Heraldry===

Châteaubriant has had at least three coats of arms: two primitive ones dating from the Middle Ages, and a modern one, adopted by the town council in 1890.

The lords of Châteaubriant originally bore the arms &quot;Gules, semy of pine cones Or&quot; (many yellow pine cones on a red field) or &quot;Gules, papelonny Or&quot; (red with yellow fish scales). During the battle of Al Mansurah, an episode of the Seventh Crusade, the lord of Châteaubriant saved Louis IX of France. The King permitted him to replace the pine cones with fleurs de lys, the royal French symbol. The coat of arms was henceforth &quot;Gules, semy of fleurs de lys Or&quot;.

The modern coat of arms, dating from 1890, is &quot;Party per pale, first Azure three fleurs de lys Or a baton Gules, second Ermine, overall an escutcheon Gules, semy of fleurs de lys Or&quot;. The left part, three fleurs de lys and a red baton, are the arms of the princes of Condé, who owned Châteaubriant from the 17th century until the French Revolution, and the right part is the arms of the duchy of Brittany.

===Origins===

Several menhirs are visible around Châteaubriant, notably on the communes of Rougé, Treffieux, Lusanger and Saint-Aubin-des-Châteaux. In Châteaubriant itself, Neolithic axes were found around the suburb of Béré. This suburb was probably founded by Gauls who exploited the small iron ore which can be found there. Their ethnicity is unknown, because the region is located at the border between several Gallic people, such as the Andecavi, the Redones and the Namnetes. Remains of Roman buildings were discovered in Béré in 1876, and the suburb was at the crossroads between the Roman roads linking Candé, Nantes and Rennes.

The region is invaded by the Breton people during the 6th century. It is then a part of the Breton kingdom. Béré remains an important location, with a mint, a Christian sanctuary, forges and a market.

===Foundation===

The history of Châteaubriant itself began in the 11th century when Brient (an envoy of the Count of Rennes) built a castle on a motte bordering the Chère and Rollard rivers. Later, he also founded the priory Saint-Sauveur-de-Béré and a fair in the Béré suburb.

The fortress of Châteaubriant was then a part of eastern Brittany&#x27;s defensive line, known as the Marches of Brittany, along with the other walled towns of Vitré and Fougères (both in Ille-et-Vilaine) and Ancenis and Clisson (both in Loire Atlantique), which formed the first line of defense against the French Kingdom. Later in the 12th century the town developed around the western flank of the castle. This new town overwhelmed the old Béré suburb, which nonetheless remained a distinct parish.

===Middle Ages===

As the castle was in a very strategic location, the town was subject to several battles and invasions during the Middle Ages. One of the largest sieges was commissioned by Louis IX of France in 1235. Insecurity led the lords to raise city walls during the 13th century. The walls were improved and extended several times and were finally completed in the 15th century. The moat was fed by the Chère on the north and by the Rollard on the south. This stream was also crossing the inner town by the east, until it was covered during the 19th century. The walls had five gates of which only one still exists today.

The primitive House of Châteaubriant , whose founder was Brient, became extinct in the 14th century. One of the best known family members was Jeanne Louise de Belleville, Jeanne de Clisson also known as the Lioness of Brittany who married her first husband, 19-year-old Geoffrey de Châteaubriant VIII and had two children.

The barony of Châteaubriant was inherited by the House of Dinan, another Breton noble family. After the Dinan became themselves extinct, the barony went to the House of Laval.

In 1486, the baroness of Châteaubriant, Françoise de Dinan, opposed Francis II of Brittany and signed the &quot;Châteaubriant treaty&quot; by which barons of Brittany asked the King of France to settle a Breton internal dispute. The treaty, which betrayed the authority of Francis II, was one of the reasons of the Mad War, and showed the weakness of the Duchy of Brittany as a political entity. Brittany and France went to war, Breton castles were taken one after the other by the French. Châteaubriant was besieged in 1488 and surrendered after one week.

===Renaissance===

After the war, the castle was upgraded to fit the new military techniques, and it was redecorated in the First Renaissance style. During the 16th century, Jean de Laval, governor of Brittany from 1531 to 1542, built a new Renaissance palace inside the old castle for his wife, Françoise de Foix. At his death, Jean de Laval went on to bequeath his barony to Anne de Montmorency. During the Renaissance, Brittany was annexed to France, and three Kings of France visited Châteaubriant: Francis I, Henry II and Charles IX.

During the French Wars of Religion, Châteaubriant was one of the headquarters of the Catholic League, because the Montmorency family which owned the barony was on the Catholic side. At the beginning of the 17th century, the last Montmorency was executed for betrayal and his possessions were given to the House of Condé.

===Revolution===
During the French Revolution, Châteaubriant was the scene of violent fighting between Republicans and Royalists. It is at this period that Victor Hugo&#x27;s parents met in the town. They were Brutus Hugo, a young Republican lieutenant, and a local, Sophie Trébuchet.

===19th century===

During the 19th century, the town was modernized. Most of the city walls were destroyed, new streets were built and the parish church was reconstructed. A new town hall and a covered market were also built, and the castle became a courthouse and the seat of the sous-préfecture. Several factories were founded in the suburbs, such as a foundry in 1856 and a plough manufacture. Several iron mines were opened in the region, for example in Rougé, Teillay and Sion. Three railroads were built between 1877 and 1887 linking Châteaubriant with Nantes, Sablé-sur-Sarthe, Redon, Rennes and Ancenis. A gas supply system was opened in 1876.

===Second World War===
The concentration camp of Choisel opened in 1940. Some 45,000 war prisoners, mainly French but also British, were interned there. In 1941, the prisoners were sent to Germany, and replaced by Gypsies, black market traffickers, prostitutes, and finally political activists, mostly Communists, treated as hostages. Following the death of Karl Hotz, Feldkommandant of the Feldgericht of Nantes, killed by Resistants, 27 hostages were shot in a stone-pit outside the town on 22 October 1941. 21 other hostages were executed outside Nantes the same day. Among the Châteaubriant hostages was Guy Môquet, a 17-year-old boy who became a symbol of the French Resistance.

In 1944, the town was bombed by the Allies. They were targeting the foundries, but the bombs also destroyed a part of the castle and the town centre.

After the war, Châteaubriant was quickly rebuilt and extended towards the southwest, with the construction of a new industrial zone during the 1960s.

==Administration==

Châteaubriant is located in the Pays de la Loire region, and in the sixth circonscription of the Loire-Atlantique département. It is a sous-préfecture, and the chief town of a canton.

The election results of Châteaubriant do not show a clear political orientation. The town has been governed by left and right-wing mayors and if the citizens favored Nicolas Sarkozy as President in 2007, they massively voted for François Hollande in 2012.

Châteaubriant had a court until 2009. Since then, the nearest court is in Nantes.

==Population==
In 2018, the functional area (&quot;aire d&#x27;attraction&quot;), which encompasses Châteaubriant plus 19 surrounding communes (636 km2 in total), had 33,961 inhabitants.

The population of Châteaubriant is aging, 29.1% of the population being older than 60 (22.7% on the French national level).
==Economy==
Châteaubriant, which is located in a vast rural area, offers many services not available in villages. The town centre comprises many shops and a vast shopping centre is located on the western outskirts. The town has 1105 firms, of which 76 specialise in industry, 96 in construction, 236 in trade and 697 in services. Industry is mainly represented by food processing, with the second biggest cattle market in France and an important slaughterhouse. Metallurgy is also important, with plough and rail-material production, but plastic production is replacing it.

The &quot;foire de Béré&quot;, which has taken place every September since 1050, is one of the oldest fairs in Europe. It is a big event for the region, with furniture, leisure and car displays, and agricultural shows. A funfair is always held at the entrance. The fair itself welcomes 55,000 visitors every year, but the funfair is more successful, with 100,000 visitors.

==Culture==

===Sights===

The château de Châteaubriant is an important testimony to French medieval and Renaissance architecture. It combines an upper and a lower bailey encircled by walls and towers mostly dating from the 13th century. In the upper bailey are located the 12th century chapel and the 14th century keep and two halls. These halls and keep, where the lord was living, are built on the location of the older motte-and-bailey castle. The Renaissance palace, made of three wings and a long gallery, is built in the lower ward.

The little town centre dates back to the Middle Ages, and several half-timbered houses are visible. They mostly date back to the 15th century. The city walls were destroyed during the 19th century, but the 16th century &quot;Porte Neuve&quot; (&quot;new gate&quot;) and some towers are preserved. The covered market, built in 1900, is an exhibition venue. The Saint-Nicolas parish church was rebuilt after 1850. It is a small replica of the Saint-Nicolas church in Nantes.

The &quot;Saint-Jean-de-Béré church&quot; is located outside the centre. The church was built around 1100, and still has its original wooden ceiling. Later, during the 16th century, the three baroque altarpieces were set in the choir. The bell-tower was destroyed by a storm in 1705 and only rebuilt in 1889. This monument is one of the rare medieval churches that are still visible in Loire-Atlantique. See The works of Jean Fréour Sculptor of statue of St Rita.

The quarry at the Sablière is where 27 hostages were executed in 1941. It is now a memorial.

===Performing arts===
The &quot;Théâtre de Verre&quot; (&quot;glass theatre&quot;) is the main venue for concerts and theatre. Châteaubriant also has a four-screen cinema and a school for music, dance and drama ().

The town has a Celtic circle and a bagad (Breton traditional band).

===Local legends===

Several legends are linked with Châteaubriant. The most famous one is the &quot;Bête de Béré&quot; (&quot;Béré beast&quot;), known in the whole Pays de la Mée. According to the legend, a beast, looking like a wolf, a pig or a big cat, prowls every night in the Béré suburb to protect a young maid who has been locked for centuries under the priory.

Another legend is built around Jean de Laval and his wife Françoise de Foix, mistress of Francis I of France, who died in 1537 in the castle. At that time, a rumour said that she was killed by her jealous husband, who did not approve of her relationship with the King. Since then, a ghostly procession would walk in the castle at the death anniversary, every 16 October at midnight.

==Twin cities==

Châteaubriant is twinned with:
* Radevormwald, Germany, since 1981
* Athlone, Ireland, since 1985
* Brabova, Romania, since 1990
* Tigzirt, Algeria (in process).

<text>Camarate () is a former civil parish in the municipality of Loures, Lisbon District, Portugal. In 2013, the parish merged into the new parish Camarate, Unhos e Apelação. With a population of 23,000 inhabitants in 2001, the parish of Camarate extends into an area of 5.52 km².

==History==

The probable origin of the local place name came from the historical cultivation of vineyards with a caste of grape called &quot;Camarate&quot;.

A Matriz Church was founded by the Bishop of Lisbon, Agapito Colona, in the 14th century, and later amplified and expanded. During the Portuguese Interregnum, the estate of Camarate, then property of the Jew David Negro, administrator of the Royal Customhouses of King Ferdinand I of León and Castile, was confiscated and delivered into the hands of Nuno Álvares Pereira, who lived there with his mother until joining the Carmelite Order. While there, the knight founded and consecrated a chapel to &quot;Nossa Senhora do Socorro&quot;, which he later offered, along with the estate, to the Carmelites, who founded a convent on the site. Much later, under Nuno Álvares Pereira stewardship, Camarate would be integrated (along with other neighbouring lands) into the patrimony of the House of Braganza.

The parish of Camarate separated from the administration of Sacavém across a foral issued by King Manuel I of Portugal, dated 1 May 1511.

After the 17th century, the region became a place of leisure sought after by the Lisboeta nobility. The region was famous for its agricultural, characterized by estates that supported the fiscal production of the parish until the 20th century.

It was part of Lisbon (until 1852), then Santa Maria dos Olivais (between 1852 and 1886). Later, it was re-annexed to Lisbon between 1886 and 1895, before being integrated into the municipality of Loures. On 4 June 1996, the community was elevated to the status of &quot;vila&quot; () by decree of the Assembly of the Republic.

After the 20th century, and owing to industrial development in the neighbouring parishes, the parish experienced a growth in population, accompanied by a comparable growth in illegal construction.

Camarate became infamous for the aircraft accident that befell Portuguese Social Democratic Prime Minister Francisco Sá Carneiro, his wife, and the Christian Democratic Defense Minister Adelino Amaro da Costa, on the evening of 4 December 1980. A few hours before the presidential elections, the aircraft was en route to Porto, when it crashed in the parish.

==Geography==
Situated in north of Lisbon, Camarate is a civil parish located in the eastern part of the municipality of Loure. It is fronted in the northwest by the Lourense parishes of Frielas and Unhos, southeast by Prior Velho and east by Sacavém; in the extreme southeast it borders Santa Maria dos Olivais, in the south Charneca (both parishes of Lisbon); and, finally southwest, with the Olival Basto in the municipality of Odivelas. Part of this configuration means that a portion of the International Airport of Lisbon lies within the borders of the parish.

The civil parish includes several bairros (neighborhoods), including the bairro of Angola, Boavista, Bogalheira, CAR, Esperança, Fetais de Baixo, Fetais de Cima, Fontaínhas, Grilo, Loureiras, Mira-Loures, Santiago, Santo António, São Benedito, São Francisco, dSão João, São José, São Lourenço, Sousas, Torre, Fonte da Pipa, Mucharros, Quinta de Marvila, Quinta do Paraíso, Quinta de Santa Rosa, Quinta do Galeão, in addition to the centre of the &quot;vila&quot; ().

==Economy==
It was well known for its local wine, produced in the fertile farms that characterized the parish until the mid-twentieth century. Since then, industrialization has transformed it into an urbanized town.

==Architecture==
===Civic===
* Estate of Encarnação ()
* Estate of Ribeirinha ()
* Estate of Portas de Ferro ()
* Estate of Santa Teresa ()
* Estate of Redondo ()
* Estate of Ulmeiro ()

===Religious===
* Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Vitória ()
* Church of Santiago Maior (), alternately the &quot;Church of Saint James of Camarate&quot;, located in the intersection between the &quot;Praça 1.º de Maio&quot; with the &quot;Ruas Avelino Salgado de Oliveira&quot; and &quot;Rua de Guilherme Gomes Fernandes&quot;, the parochial church was constructed in 1370 by the Bishop of Lisbon. Over time the building deteriorated to the point that, in 1511, a new church was reconstructed on the same site, at the same time that Camarate became an independent ecclesiastical parish. A similar reconstruction/remodelling occurred at the beginning of the 17th century.

==Notable citizens==

* Mário de Sá Carneiro (19 May 1890 — Paris; 26 April 1916), was a Portuguese poet and writer, member of the &quot;Geração D&#x27;Orpheu&quot;, who, along with Fernando Pessoa and Almada Negreiros, contributed poetry and artistic prose influenced by cosmopolitanism and the European Avant-Garde

<doc id="675338" wikidata="Q1083025" url="?curid=675338" title="Strap It On">
<text>Strap It On is the debut album by American alternative metal band Helmet. It was released in October 1990 through Amphetamine Reptile Records, and reissued in January 1993 through Interscope Records.

Critics considered the album innovative for its explosive, propulsive, and often staccato riff style which greatly exploited drop D tuning. It has since become a cult classic in the post-hardcore genre and even influential on the metal scene.

==Background and recording==
Helmet was formed in 1989 by vocalist/guitarist Page Hamilton after he left the alternative rock group Band of Susans. Hamilton would recruit guitarist Peter Mengede (originally from Australia), bassist Henry Bogdan, and drummer John Stanier. Having not settled on a name yet, Mengede&#x27;s then-wife Reyne Cuccuro suggested the Germanic name of &quot;helmuth&quot;. Having misinterpreted her, Hamilton thought she was referring to the helmet protective gear. Thinking it was &quot;a pretty cool name for a band&quot;, Hamilton went with the Anglicized spelling and the band was named Helmet.

The band was noticed by Halo of Flies guitarist Tom Hazelmyer, who signed Helmet to his label Amphetamine Reptile Records; the band would release its debut 7&quot; single, &quot;Born Annoying&quot;, later in 1989.

In total, the album cost $2,500 to make. The album was produced by Wharton Tiers and the band.

==Release==
&quot;Strap It On&quot; was released through the independent label Amphetamine Reptile Records in October 1990. In January 1993, it was re-released by their new label Interscope Records.

==Reception and legacy==

The album received positive reviews, with critics praising the band&#x27;s fresh, raw and innovative sound. In September 1992, the original Amphetamine Reptile release was estimated to have sold 10,000 copies. By February 1995, this figure had increased to 40,000. Amphetamine Reptile Records founder Tom Hazelmyer would later state that &quot;Strap It On&quot; kept the label going throughout the 1990s.

AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Birchmeier wrote in his review &quot;The nine-song album is a brief one, clocking in around a half-hour, but even such brevity proves wonderfully exhausting by the time you near the last couple songs. In fact, by the time you make it past &#x27;Sinatra&#x27;, one of the album&#x27;s highlights and also the halfway point, slow fatigue threatens as the riffs continue to hammer away unrelentingly and vocalist Page Hamilton&#x27;s sometimes-tuneful, oftentimes-bellowing shouting grows seemingly further agonized. The overall relentlessness should be a sheer pleasure to those who enjoy the intensity of metal without the clownish clichés yet, at the same time, enjoy the originality of alt-rock without the pansy passivity.&quot; In 1994, &quot;The New York Times&quot; labelled &quot;Strap It On&quot; as &quot;relentlessly noisy.&quot; In 2006, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; labelled it and &quot;Meantime&quot; as one of &quot;the metal band&#x27;s two triumphs.&quot;
Future guitarist Chris Traynor was a fan of the album, and considered it to be &quot;one of the most important rock records ever.&quot;

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked the album at No. 19 in their list of &quot;The 50 Best Albums From 1990&quot;, and stated that the album is &quot;balanced on the centre-point between alt.metal, noise rock and post-hardcore.&quot; &quot;Stereogum&quot; named the track &quot;Sinatra&quot; as one of the &quot;30 Essential Noise Rock Tracks&quot;, and the album as &quot;rough-hewn post-hardcore&quot; and groove metal.

In 2004, the songs &quot;Repetition&quot;, &quot;FBLA&quot;, &quot;Bad Mood&quot; and &quot;Sinatra&quot; appeared on the compilation album &quot;Unsung: The Best of Helmet 1991–1997&quot;. The track listing for the compilation was chosen by Page Hamilton. The Sacramento-based alternative metal group Deftones covered the song &quot;Sinatra&quot;, with it appearing on their 2005 compilation album &quot;B-Sides &amp; Rarities&quot;. The song was also covered by the band Livver on the 2016 Helmet tribute album &quot;Meantime (Redux)&quot;. The album further included covers of &quot;Bad Mood&quot; by Blackwolfgoat and &quot;Blacktop&quot; by Heads.

<text>Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun (25 November 1816–13 July 1889) was a French geographer and cartographer.

==Biography==

He was born in Paris, France, the son of Conrad Malte-Brun, another geographer of Danish origin, and founder of the &quot;Société de Géographie&quot;. After having been a professor of history in several colleges, he devoted himself especially to geographical studies.

In 1851, Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun became a member of the &quot;Société de Géographie&quot;, and quickly rose to be its secretary-general. He was also the principal editor of the &quot;Nouvelles Annales des Voyage&quot;.

He died in Marcoussis in the Essonne &quot;département&quot; and is buried in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris.

==Legacy==

His name was given to the street in Marcoussis where he once lived.

Mount Malte-Brun in New Zealand&#x27;s Southern Alps was named, by Sir Julius von Haast, after him.

<text>Fort Ashby is a historic stockade fort located in Fort Ashby, West Virginia, US. A military installation constructed during the French and Indian War, it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Origin==
On 26 October 1755, Colonel George Washington gave orders to build a stockade and fort on the east side of Pattersons Creek. The fort was completed about six weeks later, commanded by Captain John Ashby and his 2nd Company of Rangers. He had orders from Washington to remain quiet as long as he could and to hold the fort as long as possible, but if necessary, rather than surrender, he should burn it and try to escape to Fort Sellers on the east side of the mouth of Patterson&#x27;s Creek. The only major battle at Fort Ashby occurred in 1756, when Lieutenant Robert Rutherford and his Rangers were defeated by a band of French and Indians.

==Ownership==
The Friends of Ashby&#x27;s Fort own Fort Ashby. The museum is open Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays, March - November, and for special events. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

<text>Yevgeny Viktorovich Tarle (; – 6 January 1955) was a Soviet historian, Marxists scholar, and academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences who studied and published on topics such as the Napoleonic invasion of Russia and the Crimean War. Much of his work dealt with themes of Marxist historiography, imperialism, and Russian nationalism. Tarle spent much of his professional life disagreeing with state authorities over his scholarship and was also a founder of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Russia&#x27;s diplomatic university.

==Life==
=== Early life and education ===
Yevgeny Tarle was born Grigory Tarle in 1874 in Kyiv, Russia (modern-day Ukraine) into a prosperous Jewish family. He changed his name as a young man, before converting to the Orthodox Church. His father, Viktor Grigorievich Tarle, belonged to the Merchantry Social Estate and ran a shop in Kyiv. Viktor also translated books from Russian to German, including the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Viktor and his wife Rozalia Arnoldovna Tarle had four children.

===Early political activism ===
As a student, Tarle joined Marxist clubs and took an active part in the social democratic movement, frequently visiting Kyivan factory workers as a lecturer and agitator. On 1 May 1900, he was arrested during a secret meeting in the middle of Anatoly Lunacharsky&#x27;s speech. Tarle was sent to Kherson under police supervision and was banned from teaching at imperial universities and gymnasiums. In August, he and his wife moved to Warsaw, where he published articles on history in various magazines. In 1901, he was allowed a two-day visit to St. Petersburg to defend his master&#x27;s thesis on Thomas More. With the support of his colleagues, he was permitted to work as a Privatdozent at the University of St. Petersburg in 1903, a position he held until 1917.

In February 1905, Tarle was arrested again for participating in student protests and was excluded from the university. However, after the October Manifesto decriminalized Marxists, he returned and continued his teaching career. To achieve his doctoral degree, he completed a two-volume dissertation about France. From 1913 to 1918, he served as a professor at the University of Tartu. During this time, he completed another work on the economic history of France, published in 1916. 

===Foreign travel ===
From 1903 to 1914, Tarle traveled to France yearly. He researched in the libraries and archives of Western Europe for his early works and read a paper at the World Congress of Historical Studies held in London in 1913. The number of his works before the Revolution amounted to 211. His most notable publications before the revolution were:

*&quot;Kontinentalnaia blokada v. I: Issledovaniia po istorii promyshelennosti i vneshnei torgovli Frantsii v epokhu Napoleona&quot; [The Continental Blockade V. I: Studies in the History of French Industry and Trade under Napoleon] in 1913
*&quot;Ekonomicheskaia zhizn korolestva Italii v tsarstvovaniie Napoleona&quot; [The Economic Situation of Italy during the Napoleonic Era], which was first published in 1916 and in the following years also in French (1928) and Italian (1950).
*&quot;Pechat’vo Frantsii pri Napoleone&quot; [The French Press under Napoleon] published in 1913
*&quot;Rabochii klass vo Frantsii v epokhu revoliutsii&quot; [The French Working Class during the Revolution] (1909–1911)

===Soviet era and exile===
Russian historical scholarship was deeply affected by the October Revolution. Despite this, Tarle remained at the University of St. Petersburg. From 1918 on, he headed the Petrograd department of the Central Archives of RSFSR. He soon became a professor at Moscow University and moved to Moscow. In 1921, he became a corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, becoming a full member in 1927. He was also active in the Russian Association of Scientific Institutes for Research in the Social Sciences (RANION). From 1922 to 1924, he published an annual journal of general history along with Fyodor Uspensky.

During 1928–1931, Tarle was frequently criticized by his colleagues in articles published in &quot;Istorik-Marksist&quot; and in &quot;Borba Klassov&quot;. Between 1929 and 1931, a group of prominent historians were arrested by the State Political Directorate following the Academic Case (also known as The Case of Platonov). They were accused of hatching a plot to overthrow the Soviet government. On 8 August 1931, Tarle was exiled to Almaty where he spent the next four years.

===Post-exile===
After Tarle returned from exile, he resumed his academic work in Leningrad and wrote two works on the Napoleonic period: a biography of Napoleon (&quot;Napoleon&quot;) published in 1936, and &quot;Napoleon’s Invasion of Russia, 1812&quot; published in 1938.

Tarle&#x27;s description of the Napoleonic Empire in &quot;Napoleon&quot; (1936) has been perceived as a study in the classic Marxist tradition. He repeated the basic ideas of Mikhail Pokrovsky on the 1812 campaign and interpreted Napoleon from the viewpoint of class struggle. Like Pokrovsky, Tarle treated the Russian people&#x27;s patriotism and the talents of the Russian commanders as of lesser significance. 

The Battle of Borodino was not termed a victory in his work, and the resistance to Napoleon was claimed as &quot;never a popular, national war&quot;. He stated that &quot;there was no mass participation by the peasantry in the guerilla bands and in their activities, and their part in the campaign was strictly limited&quot;. According to Tarle, &quot;“... it is clear that if the Spanish guerilla warfare might justifiably be called a national war, it would be impossible to apply this term to any Russian movement in the war of 1812&quot;&quot;. Tarle supported his interpretation by &quot;denying that the peasants fought against the French and describing the burning of Smolensk and Moscow as systematic acts of the Russian army in retreat&quot;. Tarle also gave references to Lenin&#x27;s words on Napoleon in his book. According to Black, when first published in 1936 Tarle&#x27;s biography of Napoleon was accepted as &quot;the final word in the analysis of the 1812 campaign&quot; but was subject to criticism.

The same year brought a change to Soviet historiography: a critical approach toward the 1812 campaign was no longer permitted. Tarle prepared a new work in a comparatively shorter time and published it in 1938 under the title &quot;Napoleon’s Invasion of Russia, 1812&quot;. This book was translated into English and published in Great Britain in 1942. In his new book, Tarle mixed Marxist ideology and Russian nationalism. This time, the War of 1812 was not presented as unexceptional, and a strong emphasis was placed on Russian patriotism.

===Post-World War II===
Tarle spent the Great Patriotic War in Kazan. From 1941 to 1943, he worked as a professor in the historico-philological department of the Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin Kazan State University. Beginning in 1942, he was also a member of the Extraordinary State Commission that investigated Nazi war crimes.

In 1951, &quot;Bolshevik&quot; published an article written by Sergey Kozhukhov, the director of the War Museum in Borodino. Tarle was accused of using foreign sources to the detriment of Russian ones, emphasizing the passive character of Kutuzov&#x27;s maneuvers, and claiming that Kutuzov was continuing the tactics of Barclay de Tolly. In addition, Tarle was attacked for failing to evaluate the Battle of Borodino as a clear-cut Russian victory, stating that Moscow was burned by the Russians themselves, and assigning too much significance to the expanses of Russia, with cold and hunger being key factors in the defeat of the French army. According to Kozhukhov, &quot;Napoleon&#x27;s Invasion of Russia, 1812&quot;, indicated the influence of bourgeois historiography. Tarle had not been sufficiently critical of &quot;aristocratic-bourgeois&quot; historians and had distorted the history of the &quot;Fatherland War&quot;.

Tarle replied to Kozhukhov&#x27;s criticism, stating that he had already begun work on a new book of the Napoleonic period, which would contain different interpretations than his earlier works. Tarle wrote, &quot;In light of the recent victory over the Nazis, it was no longer possible to view Russian history, especially military history, in the same way. Valuable new materials and chiefly Stalin’s enormously significant and illuminating judgment had obliged Soviet historians to correct their errors and revise their interpretations of the war of 1812&quot;.

Among Tarle&#x27;s works, his interpretation of the Crimean War drew attention in the society of historians. Tarle began working on the history of the Crimean War in the late 1930s and was given access to otherwise inaccessible Russian archives for his work. The first volume, published in 1941, was awarded the Stalin Prize. The second volume appeared in 1943.

Tarle&#x27;s complete work was entitled &quot;The City of Russian Glory: Sevastopol in 1854–1855&quot; and was published in 1954 by the USSR Defense Ministry. The book was based on the two-volume study about the Crimean War, written by Tarle earlier. He compares the siege of 1854–1855 to the defense of Sevastopol in 1941–1942 while attacking Washington, Hitlerism, and West Germany. Tarle presented the Crimean War to the public as a war launched by the Western states.

===Death===
Yevgeny Viktorovich Tarle died on 6 January 1955 in Moscow, before he could fulfill his intention of writing another book on the War of 1812. He was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery. His wife, Olga Tarle (1874–1955), died just a month later and was buried near him; they had lived together for over 60 years. The couple had two adult children, both of which went on to work in mathematical economy.

<doc id="675364" wikidata="Q7940752" url="?curid=675364" title="Voltage regulation">
<text>In electrical engineering, particularly power engineering, voltage regulation is a measure of change in the voltage magnitude between the sending and receiving end of a component, such as a transmission or distribution line. Voltage regulation describes the ability of a system to provide near constant voltage over a wide range of load conditions. The term may refer to a passive property that results in more or less voltage drop under various load conditions, or to the active intervention with devices for the specific purpose of adjusting voltage.

==Electrical power systems==
In electrical power systems, voltage regulation is a dimensionless quantity defined at the receiving end of a transmission line as:
:formula_1
where
&quot;Vnl&quot; is voltage at no load and &quot;Vfl&quot; is voltage at full load. The percent voltage regulation of an ideal transmission line, as defined by a transmission line with zero resistance and reactance, would equal zero due to &quot;Vnl&quot; equaling &quot;Vfl&quot; as a result of there being no voltage drop along the line. This is why a smaller value of &quot;Voltage Regulation&quot; is usually beneficial, indicating that the line is closer to ideal.

The Voltage Regulation formula could be visualized with the following: &quot;Consider power being delivered to a load such that the voltage at the load is the load&#x27;s rated voltage &quot;VRated&quot;, if then the load disappears, the voltage at the point of the load will rise to &quot;Vnl&quot;.&quot;

Voltage regulation in transmission lines occurs due to the impedance of the line between its sending and receiving ends. Transmission lines intrinsically have some amount of resistance, inductance, and capacitance that all change the voltage continuously along the line. Both the magnitude and phase angle of voltage change along a real transmission line. The effects of line impedance can be modeled with simplified circuits such as the short line approximation (least accurate), the medium line approximation (more accurate), and the long line approximation (most accurate).

The short line approximation ignores capacitance of the transmission line and models the resistance and reactance of the transmission line as a simple series resistor and inductor. This combination has impedance R + jωL or R + jX. There is a single line current I = IS = IR in the short line approximation, different from the medium and long line. The medium length line approximation takes into account the shunt admittance, usually pure capacitance, by distributing half the admittance at the sending and receiving end of the line. This configuration is often referred to as a nominal - π. The long line approximation takes these lumped impedance and admittance values and distributes them uniformly along the length of the line. The long line approximation therefore requires the solving of differential equations and results in the highest degree of accuracy.

In the voltage regulation formula, Vno load is the voltage measured at the receiving end terminals when the receiving end is an open circuit. The entire short line model is an open circuit in this condition, and no current flows in an open circuit, so I = 0 A and the voltage drop across the line given by Ohm’s law Vline drop = IZline is 0 V. The sending and receiving end voltages are thus the same. This value is what the voltage at the receiving end would be if the transmission line had no impedance. The voltage would not be changed at all by the line, which is an ideal scenario in power transmission.

Vfull load is the voltage across the load at the receiving end when the load is connected and current flows in the transmission line. Now Vline drop = IZline is nonzero, so the voltages and the sending and receiving ends of the transmission line are not equal. The current I can be found by solving Ohm’s law using a combined line and load impedance: formula_2. Then the VR, full load is given by formula_3.

The effects of this modulation on voltage magnitude and phase angle is illustrated using phasor diagrams that map VR, VS, and the resistive and inductive components of Vline drop. Three power factor scenarios are shown, where (a) the line serves an inductive load so the current lags receiving end voltage, (b) the line serves a completely real load so the current and receiving end voltage are in phase, and (c) the line serves a capacitive load so the current leads receiving end voltage. In all cases the line resistance R causes a voltage drop that is in phase with current, and the reactance of the line X causes a voltage drop that leads current by 90 degrees. These successive voltage drops are summed to the receiving end voltage, tracing backward from VR to VS in the short line approximation circuit. The vector sum of VR and the voltage drops equals VS, and it is apparent in the diagrams that VS does not equal VR in magnitude or phase angle.

The diagrams show that the phase angle of current in the line affects voltage regulation significantly. Lagging current in (a) makes the required magnitude of sending end voltage quite large relative to the receiving end. The phase angle difference between sending and receiving end is minimized, however. Leading current in (c) actually allows the sending end voltage magnitude be smaller than the receiving end magnitude, so the voltage counterintuitively increases along the line. In-phase current in (b) does little to affect the magnitude of voltage between sending and receiving ends, but the phase angle shifts considerably.

Real transmission lines typically serve inductive loads, which are the motors that exist everywhere in modern electronics and machines. Transferring a large amount of reactive power Q to inductive loads makes the line current lag voltage, and the voltage regulation is characterized by decrease in voltage magnitude. In transferring a large amount of real power P to real loads, current is mostly in phase with voltage. The voltage regulation in this scenario is characterized by a decrease in phase angle rather than magnitude.

Sometimes, the term voltage regulation is used to describe processes by which the quantity &quot;VR&quot; is reduced, especially concerning special circuits and devices for this purpose (see below).

==Electronic power supply parameters==
The quality of a system&#x27;s voltage regulation is described by three main parameters:
== Distribution feeder regulation ==

Electric utilities aim to provide service to customers at a specific voltage level, for example, 220 V or 240 V. However, due to Kirchhoff&#x27;s Laws, the voltage magnitude and thus the service voltage to customers will in fact vary along the length of a conductor such as a distribution feeder (see Electric power distribution). Depending on law and local practice, actual service voltage within a tolerance band such as ±5% or ±10% may be considered acceptable. In order to maintain voltage within tolerance under changing load conditions, various types of devices are traditionally employed:

* a load tap changer (LTC) at the substation transformer, which changes the turns ratio in response to load current and thereby adjusts the voltage supplied at the sending end of the feeder;
* voltage regulators, which are essentially transformers with tap changers to adjust the voltage along the feeder, so as to compensate for the voltage drop over distance; and
* capacitors, which reduce the voltage drop along the feeder by reducing current flow to loads consuming reactive power.

A new generation of devices for voltage regulation based on solid-state technology are in the early commercialization stages.

Distribution regulation involves a &quot;regulation point&quot;: the point at which the equipment tries to maintain constant voltage. Customers further than this point observe an expected effect: higher voltage at light load, and lower voltage at high load. Customers closer than this point experience the opposite effect: higher voltage at high load, and lower voltage at light load.

== Complications due to distributed generation ==

Distributed generation, in particular photovoltaics connected at the distribution level, presents a number of significant challenges for voltage regulation.

Conventional voltage regulation equipment works under the assumption that line voltage changes predictably with distance along the feeder. Specifically, feeder voltage drops with increasing distance from the substation due to line impedance and the rate of voltage drop decreases farther away from the substation. However, this assumption may not hold when DG is present. For example, a long feeder with a high concentration of DG at the end will experience significant current injection at points where the voltage is normally lowest. If the load is sufficiently low, current will flow in the reverse direction (i.e. towards the substation), resulting in a voltage profile that increases with distance from the substation. This inverted voltage profile may confuse conventional controls. In one such scenario, load tap changers expecting voltage to decrease with distance from the substation may choose an operating point that in fact causes voltage down the line to exceed operating limits.

The voltage regulation issues caused by DG at the distribution level are complicated by lack of utility monitoring equipment along distribution feeders. The relative scarcity of information on distribution voltages and loads makes it difficult for utilities to make adjustments necessary to keep voltage levels within operating limits.

Although DG poses a number of significant challenges for distribution level voltage regulation, if combined with intelligent power electronics DG can actually serve to enhance voltage regulation efforts. One such example is PV connected to the grid through inverters with volt-VAR control. In a study conducted jointly by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), when volt-VAR control was added to a distribution feeder with 20% PV penetration, the diurnal voltage swings on the feeder were significantly reduced.

== Transformers ==

One case of voltage regulation is in a transformer. The unideal components of the transformer cause a change in voltage when current flows. Under no load, when no current flows through the secondary coils, &quot;Vnl&quot; is given by the ideal model, where &quot;VS = VP*NS/NP&quot;. Looking at the equivalent circuit and neglecting the shunt components, as is a reasonable approximation, one can refer all resistance and reactance to the secondary side and clearly see that the secondary voltage at no load will indeed be given by the ideal model. In contrast, when the transformer delivers full load, a voltage drop occurs over the winding resistance, causing the terminal voltage across the load to be lower than anticipated. By the definition above, this leads to a nonzero voltage regulation which must be considered in use of the transformer.

<text>Fort Branch was a fort built by the Confederate Army especially to defend against attacks from the Union Army along the Roanoke River in North Carolina.

The fort was originally built in 1862 along Rainbow Banks in Martin County, southeast of Hamilton, as a suitable location for defense of the Roanoke Valley. Twelve pieces of artillery were stationed at the fort to prevent Union access to the Wilmington-Weldon Railroad Bridge.

On December 12, 1864, members of the 2nd Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Heavy Artillery, 27th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, 9th New Jersey Volunteer Infantry, 16th Connecticut Volunteer Infantry, 176th Regiment Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, Battery A of the 3rd New York Heavy Artillery Regiment, and the 12th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry under the command of Colonel Jones Frankle advanced towards Fort Branch. The night was bitterly cold and quite dark, which enabled the Union contingent to move easily. Colonel John Hinton, commanding officer of the fort, was caught unawares and was captured easily by Captain Samuel P. Russell of Battery A of the 3rd New York. Despite this initial success, the decision to chase down Confederate soldiers of the Weldon Junior Reserves gave Hinton&#x27;s men time to regroup, and the fort was abandoned as Frankle and his men retreated back to Williamston, North Carolina.

<text>Conrad Malte-Brun (; born Malthe Conrad Bruun; 12 August 177514 December 1826), sometimes referred to simply as Malte-Brun, was a Dano-French geographer and journalist. His second son, Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun, was also a geographer. Today he is perhaps best remembered for coining the name for the geographic region Oceania (French ) around 1812, he also coined the name Indo-China.

==Biography==
Born in Thisted to an administrator of Danish crown lands, Malte-Brun was originally destined for a career as a pastor, but chose instead to attend classes at the University of Copenhagen, and became a supporter of the French Revolution and an activist in favor of freedom of the press. Following the harsh censorship laws instituted by the Danish ruler crown prince Frederick in September 1799, he was indicted because of his many pamphlets which contained outright criticism of the government, which the new censorship laws forbade. A particular cause for offence was a pamphlet he published in 1795 entitled &quot;Catechism of the Aristocrats.&quot;

The case of Peter Andreas Heiberg, who for similar crimes had been sentenced to exile at Christmas of 1799, did not make Malte-Brun optimistic about his prospects. Poul Skibsted acted as prosecutor in both trials. Bruun had already left the country prior to the court sentence (which was first carried late 1800) and had settled first in Sweden, later in the Free City of Hamburg.

At some point during his exile, he started using his Danish first name, Malthe, as part of his surname, Bruun.

Malte-Brun arrived in France in November 1799, and began work on a geography treatise meant as a gift to his adoptive country. A poem on the death of Andreas Peter Bernstorff which he published during his exile procured for him permission to return to Denmark. But another pamphlet against the aristocracy subjected him to a new prosecution, and he left his country, and finally took up his residence in Paris. In December 1800, the Danish courts pronounced sentence of perpetual banishment against him, which was rescinded about the time of his death. Malte-Brun&#x27;s geography treatise was written with the help of Edme Mentelle, a professor at the École Normale; together, they produced (6 vols., published between 1803 and 1812).

He was a regular contributor to &quot;Journal des Débats&quot;. He at first opposed the consular government, but subsequently became a zealous imperialist, and after the fall of Napoleon an equally zealous monarchist, publishing in 1824 .

Aside from his political writings, he devoted himself especially to geographical studies. He was the founder of &quot;Les Annales des Voyages&quot; (in 1807) and &quot;Les Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie et de l&#x27;Histoire&quot; (in 1819), which encouraged observations and reports as a basis for research. He became well known after contributing &quot;Tableau de la Pologne&quot;, a treatise on the geography of Poland (in 1807, as the First Empire troops established French tutelage in the region). In 1822–1824, he served as the first general secretary of the newly founded &quot;Société de Géographie&quot;. Malte-Brun was the first person to suggest importing camels into Australia.

The importance of Malte-Brun&#x27;s work can be seen also in Albanology. In his sixth volume of &quot;Universal Geography&quot; published in 1826 an original Albanian alphabet is mentioned (erroneously thought to be from the first millennium), that opened a whole new research perspective followed by Johann Georg von Hahn, Leopold Geitler, Gjergj Pekmezi and others. Seven original Albanian alphabets have been discovered since.

He died in Paris in 1826, as he was drafting the final version of his major work, the . This appeared in eight volumes (1810–1829), the last two volumes being by Huot. Malte-Brun&#x27;s name was given to streets in both Paris (20th arrondissement) and Thisted.

<text>Alexander James McLean (born January 9, 1978) is an American singer. He is a founding member of the pop vocal group Backstreet Boys.

== Early life ==
McLean was born on January 9, 1978, in West Palm Beach, Florida, to Denise (née Fernandez, now Solis), a hospital worker, author and motivation coach, and Robert Blue “Bob” McLean, a musician. Denise is of Cuban-Puerto Rican and German ancestry and Bob is of Scots-Irish and English descent. A DNA test described his genetic ancestry as Iberian, Central and South American, North, West and East European, North African, Nigerian and Ashkenazi Jewish. He is an only child. He was raised by his mother and grandparents as his parents divorced when he was two years old. He rarely saw his father but reunited with him in 1997. They have since kept in regular contact following their seventeen-year estrangement.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
As a child, McLean had a speech impediment, which gave him a lisp and a tendency to stutter.

He discovered his love for performing and started to pursue a career in acting, dancing, and singing. When he was four, McLean began to focus on his love for dance. His mother signed him up for two hours of dance lessons every day. He took ballet for four years, jazz, tap, hip hop, rhythm tap, rhythm hip-hop, contemporary, ballroom, salsa, merengue, and gymnastics. His mother got him into modeling when he was around five years old, and he was featured in J.C. Penney catalogs and runways. Aside from that, he took up fencing. His grandmother, who was like a second mother to him, taught him piano and took him to auditions while he was growing up. At age six, McLean was part of a school play, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, in which he played Dopey, at Unity of Delray Beach church and school. He also appeared in more traditional musicals such as &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, &quot;The King and I&quot;, and &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; before the age of 11. By age 12, he had performed in 27 classic school plays.

In addition to singing and acting, he was a serious dance student learning everything from jazz to ballet to hip hop. He stated in interviews that &quot;Dancing was really my thing in the early days. I wanted to be a dancer way above an actor or a singer.&quot; When he was 12, he started his first dance troupe and would go to dance competitions, which was a valuable experience even though they didn&#x27;t win.

In January 1986, at eight years old, McLean acted in his first role as Little Mike in the 1986 film &quot;Truth or Dare?&quot;. In 1990, McLean, his mother, and grandparents moved to Kissimmee, Florida to pursue his acting and singing career. For four years, he attended a private acting school, the Florida Academy of Dramatic Arts, acted in the drama club and small plays and modeled periodically. In 1991, McLean landed a role in the Nickelodeon comedy series &quot;Hi Honey, I&#x27;m Home!&quot; as Skunk. However, after the pilot, he was cut from the show due to being too tall, and Eric Kushnick was cast instead.

In 1989, at age 11, he saw an ad in the newspaper for a Latin festival. Since his grandfather had Latin roots, he decided to audition. He won first place and a $1,000 prize. The festival&#x27;s producer hired him to perform a 45-minute one-person show and did a puppet show, showcasing his singing, acting, and dancing. At the Latin festival, he met a young 16-year-old Howie Dorough (Tony Donetti at the time) through a mutual vocal coach. When he was 13 years old, McLean tried out for &quot;Star Search&quot;, but never received a call back from the show.

In junior high, McLean won a part in Nickelodeon&#x27;s series &quot;Welcome Freshmen&quot;, which began his ongoing work relationship with Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. He also appeared on the Nickelodeon show &quot;GUTS&quot; and a Muppets commercial. It was during one of his auditions for the former that he met Howie D. and Nick Carter, lacing together the roots of the group that was to become Backstreet Boys.

Due to his love of performing and not participating in the same sports as his peers, he was bullied, called names, and given a hard time. He described himself at this young age as a weirdo and &quot;wacky.&quot; He remarked that being made fun of had been very upsetting for him, but he felt it stemmed from others&#x27; jealousy of his talents and the subsequent attention that gave him.

=== Backstreet Boys ===
In March 1992, an ad was placed in a local newspaper seeking young men between the ages of 16-19 for an audition for a new music group. Despite being 14 years old, he auditioned for the group. By April 1992, McLean was officially the group&#x27;s first member to join the newly formed Backstreet Boys. After six months at Osceola High School, he finished the remaining three years of high school through correspondence courses with a tutor on the road after joining the Backstreet Boys.
McLean, Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, Kevin Richardson, and Richardson&#x27;s cousin Brian Littrell formed the vocal group Backstreet Boys in 1993. The group enjoyed extensive commercial success throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s.

=== Solo ventures ===
==== Johnny No Name (2000) ====
McLean created a character named &quot;Johnny No Name&quot; as his alter ego. He uses this as his name when not performing with other members of the Backstreet Boys. The character has similarities to McLean; for instance, both had single mothers and lived with their grandparents from a young age. There are also differences – Johnny has been to prison whereas McLean has not. McLean has occasionally performed as Johnny No Name in rock/metal clubs around New York. He established the JNN Foundation to fund diabetes research and other causes, such as keeping music programs in schools. McLean also performed a nine-city tour to support VH1 Save the Music as Johnny No Name. A source said he would release a solo album as Johnny No Name, but it never happened.

McLean&#x27;s alter ego was originally named Johnny Suede. This shared a name with a character played by Brad Pitt in a film of the same name, and when the film&#x27;s movie studio Miramax threatened to sue McLean, he changed the name to Johnny No Name.

==== &quot;Have It All&quot; (2010) ====
It was not until March 2008 when McLean finally started to perform his first two solo shows at the Anaheim House of Blues and The Roxy in Los Angeles. The show consisted of his solo material and a solo version of the Backstreet Boys hit, &quot;Incomplete.&quot; The solo tour continued through Europe in May and June, parallel to the Backstreet Boys tour. His solo album &quot;Have It All&quot; was released on January 20, 2010. On the Backstreet Boys cruise in December 2010, it was said that the US version would be released on February 8, 2011, but since then has not been released. While creating his solo project, McLean worked with the OneRepublic vocalist Ryan Tedder, producers Dan Muckala and Kristian Lundin, as well as former NSYNC member JC Chasez. The album was a mix of pop, rock, and some r&amp;b. The first and only single from the album, &quot;Teenage Wildlife,&quot; was co-written by Chasez. The album featured his co-written ten songs, including a personal song about his father, &quot;Sincerely Yours.&quot; In 2011, McLean had said he would release the album in 2012 in the US, featuring songs from his first solo album, but he eventually scrapped the idea.

In June 2012, McLean was working on a second solo original album. On July 23, 2012, he posted two new songs on Socialcam: &quot;Peach&quot; and &quot;P.L.A.R.S.&quot; The album was announced for release in 2012 but was pushed back.

Around early 2015, McLean said he was working on a new solo album with Jordan Omley of The Jam, who worked on several Backstreet Boys songs on the albums &quot;This Is Us&quot; and &quot;In A World Like This&quot;. The first single, &quot;Live Together,&quot; was named for a charitable foundation started by McLean and Omley; a music video was filmed to help raise money for Marshall Fundamental Secondary School in Pasadena, California, who had had their musical instruments stolen. McLean, along with singers Becky G, Omley, and Blake Lewis, visited, and some even performed at the school. &quot;Live Together&quot; premiered on People.com on May 12, 2015, and the video was released on October 5, 2015. Meanwhile, the album experienced delays, partly due to McLean recording new tracks and the Backstreet Boys&#x27; preparation and promotion for their 2017 Las Vegas residency Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life.

==== Collaborations (2013) ====
On May 22, 2013, a Finnish rapper Redrama released a single, &quot;Clouds,&quot; featuring McLean. It peaked at No. 4 on the singles chart in Finland.

==== &quot;Naked&quot; (2016) ====
A second solo album titled &quot;Naked&quot; was set to be released in September 2016 but was delayed. &quot;Live Together&quot; was released as the lead single on September 4, 2015, on iTunes.

==== &quot;Sex and Bodies&quot; (2018–present) ====
On April 15, 2018, at the 53rd annual Academy of Country Music Awards, during an interview with &quot;Billboard&quot;, McLean discussed his plans to &quot;disrupt country music&quot; for his next solo project. He also said that the Backstreet Boys&#x27; collaboration on Florida Georgia Line&#x27;s &quot;God, Your Mama, and Me&quot; inspired him to make a country album. On June 4, 2018, McLean released the single &quot;Back Porch Bottle Service&quot; from an upcoming album. McLean continued his foray into country-pop releasing the ballad &quot;Boy and a Man&quot; in March 2019 as a single from an upcoming album &quot;Long Road&quot;. The video was directed by René Elizondo Jr., best known for his work with Janet Jackson.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, McLean released &quot;Love Song Love&quot; on April 27, 2021, which showcased his support for the LGBT community and then put out a new single &quot;Smoke&quot; on July 15, 2022, that he recorded with his group ATCK. McLean also announced he was set to release his second solo album, his first in 12 years since, &quot;Have It All&quot; called &quot;Sex and Bodies&quot;.

On February 14, 2024, (Valentine&#x27;s Day), McLean released a new song called Electric under his full name, Alexander James. In March 2024, McLean announced that he and *NSYNC member Joey Fatone were coheadlining a tour together.

McLean was going to be hosting a brand-new Netflix reality TV competition series called &quot;Building the Band&quot;, but since the death of Liam Payne of One Direction, the show won&#x27;t air anytime soon. the show also included pcd Nicole Scherzinger, Destiny&#x27;s Child alum Kelly Rowland, and Payne as the judges.
== Personal life ==
After McLean&#x27;s grandmother died in 2001, he struggled with alcohol addiction. In 1999, the International Star Registry named a star in Aquila constellation after McLean. On June 7, 2021, McLean&#x27;s stepfather Tony Solis died.
=== Relationships ===
McLean has had several relationships during his career. After joining the Backstreet Boys in 1992, McLean began dating Marissa Jackson, daughter of former manager Donna Wright and stepdaughter of Johnny Wright; their relationship lasted for six years. She is seen in the music video for &quot;We&#x27;ve Got It Goin&#x27; On&quot; and helped out on the band&#x27;s first world tour with wardrobe and as a hairstylist. After their breakup, she wrote the book &quot;Loving A.J.: My 6-Year Romance with a Backstreet Boy&quot;. McLean dated Amanda Latona of Innosense for two years, one of the band&#x27;s dancers, Kristin denehy, for 3 months and was engaged to singer Sarah Martin in 2002 but they split up.

McLean met model and makeup artist/hairstylist Rochelle Deanna Karidis in October 2001, before the two reunited in 2006 and then began dating in 2009. On his birthday in 2010, McLean proposed to Karidis. He credits her with motivating him to get sober and overcome his years-long struggle with drug addiction. The couple got married on December 17, 2011, at the Beverly Hills Hotel with the rest of the Backstreet Boys in attendance. They have two daughters together. On New Year&#x27;s Day 2024, after 12 years of marriage, the couple announced their decision to divorce after temporarily separating. Since their divorce, McLean shared that he wanted to reconcile with Rochelle whenever they were co-parenting their daughters still spend as much time together as a family as possible due to the sudden fact that they&#x27;re the best of friends and their love for one another never changed.

=== Substance abuse ===
At the height of his Backstreet Boys career, McLean suffered from drug and alcohol addiction. He stated the first time he used cocaine was on the set of the video for &quot;The Call&quot; in 2000. His bandmate Richardson confronted him in July 2001. McLean threatened to quit the band but later broke down and arranged rehab for drug and alcohol abuse. On July 9, 2001, a press release was sent out stating that the remainder of the dates in Boston would be canceled due to Nick Carter injuring his hand. The rest of the group appeared on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Total Request Live&quot; to announce McLean was going into rehab for one month, after which the group resumed their Black &amp; Blue Tour.

He entered rehab once again in 2002. On January 10, 2011, he checked into rehab for the third time, stating it was for personal reasons. In preparation for the New Kids on the Block and Backstreet Boys&#x27; NKOTBSB tour, McLean said, &quot;I want to be healthy and perform and sing for people at my very best and happiest.&quot; His time in rehab did not affect the tour. He said he wanted to be healthy and sober before getting married. He originally planned to marry in May 2011 but had pushed back the date because of the NKOTBSB Tour. During an interview with New Zealand radio station ZM, McLean described addiction as the hardest thing he has ever had to go through, stating it is something he battles every day. McLean admitted in 2020 that he had relapsed at the end of 2019, but was working to stay sober to be a better husband and father.

Since his permanent recovery after 20 years, McLean now hosts 12-step Alcoholics Anonymous meetings at his place and stated he planned to continue attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings &quot;whenever I have a break&quot; when the band is in Cancún for &quot;Backstreet&#x27;s Back At The Beach&quot; on April 18–21, 2024. &quot;It just takes two for a meeting.&quot; He also stated he had divided his career (as AJ) from his personal life (as Alex) by setting healthy boundaries between work and family since his substance abuse and fame put a strain on his personal life. He told &quot;People&quot; that he &quot;battled self-esteem issues my entire life, and I’ve learned a lot. My sobriety is the most solid it’s ever been.&quot;

Two years sober permanently, McLean had asked his bandmates and those working with him to call him by his real name, Alex, as AJ is a character. “It doesn&#x27;t define who I am, and I now feel like I&#x27;m getting this healthy balance of when I&#x27;m done on stage and I walk off. I&#x27;m a dad, I&#x27;m a husband, I&#x27;m a friend, I&#x27;m a brother. That&#x27;s all that matters to me.” He is “just trying to continue to grow in my true, authentic self” as he moves forward in his health journey.
===Health and fitness===
In 2020, before his appearance on &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, McLean stated he was completely sober and following a strict diet: grain-free, gluten-free, plant-based, and sugar-free. Two years later, he reported success in losing excess weight, keeping a trim body and not having alcohol or fast food.

<text>Wald () is a municipality in the Bern-Mittelland administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland.

==History==
In January 2004 it incorporated the two independent municipalities of Zimmerwald and Englisberg.

*Englisberg, population: 201
*Zimmerwald, population: 870

Englisberg is first mentioned in 1166 as &quot;Endlisperc&quot;.

Zimmerwald was first mentioned in 1296 as &quot;Zymmerwalt&quot;. Until 1902 it was officially known as &quot;Obermuhlern und Zimmerwald&quot;.

===Englisberg===

Englisberg first appears in a historic record with the Kyburg Ministerialis (unfree knights in the service of a feudal overlord) family of Englisberg. By the 15th century Bernese patrician families owned the village and surrounding &quot;Herrschaft&quot;. The right to hold court in the &quot;Herrschaft&quot; was sold to the villagers in 1570 and then split into 70 shares. This situation remained until the 18th century, when Bernese patricians bought the majority of the shares back. It was originally part of the parish of Belp, but in 1699 became an independent parish.

The village economy always relied on agriculture. However, by 1900 fewer workers were needed on the farms and the population began to decline. A poorhouse opened in 1890 and eventually became the Kühlewil nursing home, which is now a major employer in the village.

===Zimmerwald===

The oldest trace of a settlement in the area are several neolithic artifacts found at Äppenacker. Roman era artifacts and a lime kiln have been discovered scattered around the municipal area. The village and surrounding lands were owned by several Bernese families as well as Interlaken Monastery, Köniz and Münchenbuchsee Commanderys and the Obere Spital in Bern. In 1528 Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation, secularized the monasteries and acquired their estates, including Zimmerwald. The village was combined to form the court of Obermuhlern and Zimmerwald in the Seftigen District. Until 1697 it was part of the large parish of Belp, then it formed an independent parish with the parish church in Zimmerwald.

In 1641 the wealthy Bernese Werdt family built a hunting lodge in the village. In 1860 the Pension Beau Séjour was built in the park near the lodge. The Pension became famous, when in 1915, the Zimmerwald Conference was held there. The Zimmerwald Conference was the first of three international socialist conferences convened by anti-militarist socialist parties from countries that were originally neutral during World War I. The Zimmerwald movement grew out of the conferences. The delegates included Lenin and Leon Trotsky. Eventually the Pension was demolished and no trace remains of the building.

In 1956 the University of Bern opened the Zimmerwald Observatory in the municipality. In 1988 a satellite monitoring station was added. Today, the village economy still relies mostly on farming and raising livestock.

<text>Kuda Bux (15 October 1905 – 5 February 1981, born Khudah Bukhsh) was a Kashmiri magician and firewalker.

==Biography==
Khudah Bukhsh was born in Akhnur, Kashmir in 1905, to an ethnic Kashmiri family. His father worked as a railway ticket inspector. Bukhsh later became a Pakistani citizen. When he was thirteen, he left home to learn magic from a performer named Professor Moor. 

After a few months, he joined a theater group as a magician. Three years later, Kuda went to Hardwar to study with a yogi. He pretended to be religious to be accepted as a disciple. The yogi taught Kuda to train his subconscious mind, which is how he claimed to be able to perform all of his feats.

In the mid-1930s, he arrived in the United States where he worked steadily as a magician. He was also known as DareDevil or The Man Who Can See Without His Eyes. In the 1950s, he had a short-lived TV show called &quot;Kuda Bux, Hindu Mystic&quot;.

He eventually lost his eyesight to glaucoma. Early in her career, Joan Rivers traveled to Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré with Kuda to perform as his assistant. They did the Indian basket trick, and Kuda sawed her in half. After Rivers started telling jokes during the illusions, Kuda fired her. The Magic Castle gave him a Performing Fellowship in 1970. In his old age, he was a nightly regular at the Castle where he would play cards with magicians Dai Vernon and Hy Berg. He died in 1981 in his sleep, aged 75.

==Career==
Kuda Bux was a skilled magician with a seven-decade career. His first job was attracting audiences for Professor Moor by performing the linking rings. Bux was a deft card magician and was described as &quot;a genius with silks&quot;. He generated publicity for his performances by seeking the scrutiny of scientists. 

===Blindfolds===
In one of his best known performances he would cover his eyes with soft dough balls, blindfold himself, swath his entire head in strips of cloth, and yet still be able to see. While blindfolded he would read the dates on coins which were held in a spectator&#x27;s hand, read the fine print of a magazine, thread a needle while covered in a wine barrel, duplicate words he had never seen written, shoot a can on children&#x27;s heads with a pellet gun and many other tricks. Bux once cycled with his eyes covered along Broadway in New York City.

Over the years, Bux gave differing accounts about how the trick worked. He told researcher Harry Price that he used his nostrils to see. He once said any piece of exposed skin was all he needed to perform the trick and read &quot;The Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; from behind a door with his hand. Fellow magician John Booth wrote that Bux was a dedicated showman who made a point of using reading glasses when he was not onstage. Booth befriended his colleague when he was a regular at the Magic Castle. 

Roald Dahl wrote a non-fiction story about Bux&#x27;s blindfold routine for &quot;Argosy&quot; in 1952. Twenty-five years later, he changed Bux&#x27;s name to Imhrat Khan and kept the bulk of his &quot;Argosy&quot; report intact as the framed story in &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar&quot;.

===Firewalking===
In 1935, Bux walked over hot coals in front of an audience of scientists from the University of London Council for Psychical Research and news reporters. On September 9, he made a test walk across a 25x3x1-foot trench. Bux felt the trench was too shallow and narrow. Eight days later, the trench was twice as wide but 3 inches shallower. Bux&#x27;s feet were checked before and after the firewalking demonstration to verify that no protective chemicals, topical creams or herbs were used. It was a very windy day and the surface temperature of the fire was over . The September 17th stunt was photographed and filmed. &quot;Time&quot; reported that Bux wept when he was asked to repeat the walk a third time and refused to do it.

Bux repeated his firewalk at NBC Radio City Studios in Manhattan on 2 August 1938. A hole was dug in the Radio City parking lot. Wooden logs and bags of charcoal were set on fire in it. Bux took four steps across the pit before exiting halfway across. After Bux walked through the coals, a cameraman who had missed some of the stunt asked for a retake. Bux obliged by repeating the firewalk. Again, his feet were checked before and after the firewalking demonstration. Robert Ripley said, &quot;Kuda Bux&#x27;s feet were not even warm.&quot; There is newsreel footage of this event in the TV biography &quot;The Incredible Life and Times of Robert Ripley: Believe It or Not!&quot;. It was the last time Bux would perform the stunt.

Harry Price suggested that the feat was performed by specific placement of the feet. Just days after Bux&#x27;s 1935 walk, Joseph Dunninger gave a more logical explanation to his Universal Council for Psychic Research. He pointed out that charcoal cools rapidly, and it also has a protective layer of ash. By walking quickly on it, one could avoid being burned. Dunniger reminded his audience that firewalking is an old Japanese trick known as &quot;hai-wattari&quot; (火渡).

<text>Juniper Networks, Inc. is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. The company develops and markets networking products, including routers, switches, network management software, network security products, and software-defined networking technology.

The company was founded in 1996 by Pradeep Sindhu, with Scott Kriens as the first CEO, who remained until September 2008. Kriens has been credited with much of Juniper&#x27;s early market success. It received several rounds of funding from venture capitalists and telecommunications companies before going public in 1999. Juniper grew to $673 million in annual revenues by 2000. By 2001 it had a 37% share of the core routers market, challenging Cisco&#x27;s once-dominant market-share. It grew to US$4 billion in revenues by 2004 and $4.63 billion in 2014. Juniper appointed Kevin Johnson as CEO in 2008, Shaygan Kheradpir in 2013 and Rami Rahim in 2014.

Juniper Networks originally focused on core routers, which are used by internet service providers (ISPs) to perform IP address lookups and direct internet traffic. Through the acquisition of Unisphere, in 2002, the company entered the market for edge routers, which are used by ISPs to route internet traffic to individual consumers. In 2003, Juniper entered the IT security market with its own JProtect security toolkit before acquiring security company NetScreen Technologies the following year. In the early 2000s, Juniper entered the enterprise segment, which accounted for one-third of its revenues by 2005. Since 2014, Juniper has been focused on developing new software-defined networking products. In early 2024, Juniper agreed to be bought out by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) for approximately $14 billion.

==History==

===Origins and funding===

Pradeep Sindhu, a scientist with Xerox&#x27;s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), conceived the idea for Juniper Networks while on vacation in 1995
and founded the company in February 1996. Sindhu wanted to create data packet-based routers that were optimized for Internet traffic (packet switching), whereby the routing and transferring of data occurs &quot;by means of addressed packets so that a channel is occupied during the transmission of the packet only, and upon completion of the transmission the channel is made available for the transfer of other traffic.&quot; He was joined by engineers Bjorn Liencres from Sun Microsystems and Dennis Ferguson from MCI Communications.

Sindhu started Juniper Networks with $2 million in seed funding, which was followed by $12 million in funding in the company&#x27;s first year of operations. About seven months after the company&#x27;s founding, Scott Kriens was appointed CEO to manage the business, while founder Sindhu became the Chief Technology Officer. By February 1997, Juniper had raised $8 million in venture funding. Later that year, Juniper Networks raised an additional $40 million in investments from a round that included four out of five of the largest telecommunications equipment manufacturers: Siemens, Ericsson, Nortel and 3Com. Juniper also received $2.5 million from Qwest and other investments from AT&amp;T.

===Growth and IPO===
Juniper Networks had $3.8 million in annual revenue in 1998. By the following year, its only product, the M40 router, was being used by 50 telecommunications companies. Juniper Networks signed agreements with Alcatel and Ericsson to distribute the M40 internationally. A European headquarters was established in the United Kingdom and an Asia-Pacific headquarters in Hong Kong. A subsidiary was created in Japan and offices were established in Korea in 1999. Juniper Networks&#x27;s market share for core routers grew from 6% in 1998 to 17.5% one year later, and 20% by April 2000.

Juniper Networks filed for an initial public offering in April 1999 and its first day on the NASDAQ was that June. The stock set a record in first-day trading in the technology sector by increasing 191% to a market capitalization of $4.9 billion. According to &quot;Telephony&quot;, Juniper Networks became the &quot;latest darling of Wall Street&quot;, reaching a $7 billion valuation by late July. Within a year, the company&#x27;s stock grew five-fold.

Juniper Networks&#x27;s revenues grew 600% in 2000 to $673 million. That same year, Juniper Networks moved its headquarters from Mountain View to Sunnyvale, California.

===Competition===
By 2001, Juniper controlled one-third of the market for high-end core routers, mostly at the expense of Cisco Systems sales. According to &quot;Businessweek&quot;, &quot;analysts unanimously agree[d] that Juniper&#x27;s boxes [were] technically superior to Cisco&#x27;s because the hardware does most of the data processing. Cisco routers still relied on software, which often results in slower speeds.&quot; However, Cisco provided a broader range of services and support and had an entrenched market position. The press often depicted Juniper and Cisco as a &quot;David versus Goliath&quot; story. Cisco had grown through acquisitions to be a large generalist vendor for routing equipment in homes, businesses and for ISPs, whereas Juniper was thought of as the &quot;anti-Cisco&quot; for being a small company with a narrow focus.

In January 2001, Cisco introduced a suite of router products that &quot;Businessweek&quot; said was intended to challenge Juniper&#x27;s increasing market-share. According to &quot;Businessweek&quot;, Juniper&#x27;s top-end router was four times as fast at only twice the cost of comparable Cisco products. Cisco&#x27;s routers were not expected to erode Juniper&#x27;s growing share of the market, but other companies such as Lucent, Alcatel, and startups Avici Systems and Pluris had announced plans to release products that would out-pace Juniper&#x27;s routers.

Juniper introduced a suite of routers for the network edge that allowed it to compete with Cisco. Juniper&#x27;s edge routers had a 9% market share two months after release. Both companies made exaggerated marketing claims; Juniper promoted its products as stable enough to make IT staff bored and Cisco announced lab tests from &quot;Light Reading&quot; proved its products were superior to Juniper, whereas the publication itself reached the opposite conclusion. By 2002, both companies were repeatedly announcing products with faster specifications than the other in what &quot;Network World&quot; called a &quot;&#x27;speeds-and-feeds&#x27; public relations contest&quot;.

By 2004, Juniper controlled 38% of the core router market. By 2007, it had a 5%, 18% and 30% share of the market for enterprise, edge and core routers respectively. Alcatel-Lucent was unsuccessful in challenging Juniper in the core router market but continued competing with Juniper in edge routers along with Cisco.

===Further development===
In late 2000, Juniper formed a joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network switches for internet traffic on mobile devices, and with Nortel for fiber optic technology. In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China. Juniper&#x27;s growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown and revenues fell by two-thirds during the dot-com bust. 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.

Juniper had rebounded by 2004, surpassing $1 billion in revenues for the first time that year and reaching $2 billion in revenue in 2005. Beginning in 2004, with the acquisition of NetScreen, Juniper Networks began developing and marketing products for the enterprise segment. Juniper had a reputation for serving ISPs, not enterprises, which it was trying to change. By 2005, enterprise customers accounted for one-third of the company&#x27;s revenues, but it had spent $5 billion in acquisitions and R&amp;D for the enterprise market.

In 2006, more than 200 US companies restated their financial results due to a series of investigations into stock backdating practices. Juniper stockholders alleged the company engaged in deceptive backdating practices that benefited its top executives unfairly. In December 2006, Juniper restated its financials, charging $900 million in expenses to correct backdated stock options from 1999 to 2003. This was followed by a $169 million settlement with stockholders in February 2010.

===2008–present===
In July 2008, Juniper&#x27;s first CEO, Scott Kriens, became chairman and former Microsoft executive Kevin Johnson was appointed CEO. Johnson focused the company more on software, creating a software solutions division headed by a former Microsoft colleague, Bob Muglia. Juniper also hired other former Microsoft executives to focus on the company&#x27;s software strategy and encourage developers to create software products that run on the Junos operating system. Juniper established partnerships with IBM, Microsoft and Oracle for software compatibility efforts. The SSL/VPN Pulse product family was launched in 2010, then later spun off to a private equity firm in 2014 for $250 million.

In 2012, Juniper laid off 5% of its staff and four of its high-ranking executives departed. The following year, CEO Kevin Johnson announced he was retiring once a replacement was found. In November 2013, Juniper Networks announced that Shaygan Kheradpir would be appointed as the new CEO. He started the position in January 2014.

In January 2014, hedge fund, activist investor and Juniper shareholder Elliott Associates advocated that Juniper reduce its cash reserves and cut costs, before Kheradpir was officially appointed. That February, Juniper reached an agreement with Elliott and other stakeholders for an Integrated Operating Plan (IOP) that involved repurchasing $2 billion in shares, reducing operating expenses by $160 million and appointing two new directors to its board. That April, 6% of the company&#x27;s staff were laid off to cut expenses. In November 2014, Kheradpir unexpectedly resigned following a review by Juniper&#x27;s board of directors regarding his conduct in a negotiation with an unnamed Juniper customer. An internal Juniper executive, Rami Rahim, took his place as CEO.

In May 2014, Palo Alto Networks agreed to pay a $175 million settlement for allegedly infringing on Juniper&#x27;s patents for application firewalls.

In 2015, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine reported that the company announced it had found unauthorized code that enabled backdoors into its ScreenOS products. The code was patched with updates from the company.

In January 2024, the company agreed to be purchased by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) for $14 billion in an all-cash deal to boost HPE&#x27;s networking and artificial intelligence resources. The acquisition was contested by the U.S. Department of Justice in January 2025, citing concerns about reduced competition and innovation, leading to higher prices for consumers.

==Acquisitions and investments==

By 2001, Juniper had made only a few acquisitions of smaller companies, due to the leadership&#x27;s preference for organic growth. The pace of acquisition picked up in 2001 and 2002 with the purchases of Pacific Broadband and Unisphere Networks. In 2004 Juniper made a $4 billion acquisition of network security company NetScreen Technologies. Juniper revised NetScreen&#x27;s channel program that year and used its reseller network to bring other products to market.

Juniper made five acquisitions in 2005, mostly of startups with deal values ranging from $8.7 to $337 million. It acquired application-acceleration vendor Redline Networks, VOIP company Kagoor Networks, as well as wide area network (WAN) company Peribit Networks. Peribit and Redline were incorporated into a new application products group and their technology was integrated into Juniper&#x27;s infranet framework. Afterwards, Juniper did not make any additional acquisitions until 2010.

From 2010 to September 2011, Juniper made six acquisitions and invested in eight companies. Often Juniper acquired early-stage startups, developing their technology, then selling it to pre-existing Juniper clients. Juniper acquired two digital video companies, Ankeena Networks and Blackwave Inc., as well as wireless LAN software company Trapeze Networks. In 2012, Juniper acquired Mykonos Software, which develops security software intended to deceive hackers already within the network perimeter. and a developer of software-defined network controllers, Contrail Systems. In 2014, Juniper acquired the software-defined networking (SDN) company WANDL.

In April 2016, Juniper closed its acquisition of BTI, a provider of cloud and metro network technology, in an effort to beef up its data center interconnect and metro packet optical transport technology and services. Juniper acquired cloud operations management and optimization startup AppFormix in December 2016. In 2017, Juniper bought Cyphort, a Silicon Valley startup that makes security analytics software. Juniper acquired cloud storage company HTBASE in November 2018. In April 2019, Juniper acquired wireless LAN (WLAN) startup Mist Systems to bolster its software-defined enterprise portfolio and multicloud offerings. In February 2022, it was announced Juniper had acquired WiteSand, a specialist cloud-native zero trust network access control (NAC) solutions company.

==Products==
Juniper Networks designs and markets IT networking products, such as routers, switches and IT security products. It started out selling core routers for ISPs, and expanded into edge routers, data centers, wireless networking, networking for branch offices and other access and aggregation devices.

Juniper is the third largest market-share holder overall for routers and switches used by ISPs. According to analyst firm Dell&#x27;Oro Group, it is the fourth largest for edge routers and second for core routers with 25% of the core market. It is also the second largest market share holder for firewall products with a 24.8% share of the firewall market. In data center security appliances, Juniper is the second-place market-share holder behind Cisco. Juniper provides technical support and services through the J-Care program.

As of February 2020, Juniper&#x27;s product families include the following:
===Routers and switches===
Juniper Networks&#x27; first product was the Junos router operating system, which was released on July 1, 1998. The first Juniper router was made available that September and was a core router for internet service providers called the M40. It incorporated specialized application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) for routing internet traffic that were developed in partnership with IBM. It had ten times the throughput of comparable contemporary Cisco products. The M40 was followed by the smaller M20 router in December 1999 and the M160 in March 2000.

By 2000, Juniper had developed five hardware systems and made seven new releases of its Junos operating system. That April, Juniper released the second generation of the internet processors embedded in its core routers. In April 2002, Juniper released the first of the T-series family (originally known under the code-name Gibson), which could perform four times as many route lookups per second as the M160. The first products of the TX Matrix family, which could be used to combine up to four T-series routers, was released in December 2004.

By 2003, Juniper had diversified into three major router applications: core routers, edge routers and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper&#x27;s first major diversification from core routers was when it entered the market for edge routers, by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on edge routers, because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper&#x27;s software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.

Juniper&#x27;s first enterprise switch product was the EX 4200, which was released in 2008. In a comparative technical test, &quot;Network World&quot; said the EX4200 was the top performer out of network switches they tested in latency and throughput, but its multicast features were &quot;newer and less robust&quot; than other aspects of the product. Juniper Networks announced the T1600 1.6 Terabits per second core router in 2007 and the newer T4000 4 Terabit router in 2010. In 2012, it released the ACX family of universal access routers. In 2013, the company made several new releases in the MX family of edge routers: it introduced a smaller version of its core routers called PTX3000, and several new enterprise routers were released. Seven months later, Juniper acquired WANDL, and its technology was integrated into the NorthStar WAN controller Juniper announced in February 2014.

In February 2011, Juniper introduced QFabric, a proprietary protocol methodology for transferring data over a network using a single network layer. Several individual products for the QFabric methodology were released throughout the year. In October 2013, Juniper introduced another network architecture called MetaFabric and a new set of switches, the QFX5100 family, as one of the foundations of the new architecture.

In February 2014, several software and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers. In December 2014, Juniper introduced a network switch, OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.

===Security===

Juniper Networks introduced the JProtect security toolkit in May 2003. It included firewalls, flow monitoring, filtering and Network Address Translation (NAT). Through the 2004 acquisition of NetScreen Technologies, Juniper acquired the Juniper Secure Meeting product line, as well as remote desktop access software. The NetScreen-5GT ADSL security appliance was the first new NetScreen product Juniper introduced after the acquisition and its first wireless product. The first Juniper product intended for small businesses was a remote access appliance that was released in August 2004. An open interface for the development of third-party tools for the appliance was made available that September.

In September 2004, Juniper entered the market for enterprise access routers with three routers that were the first of the J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market. Juniper released its first dedicated NAC product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches. According to a 2006 review in &quot;Network World&quot;, Juniper&#x27;s SSG 520 firewall and routing product was &quot;the first serious threat&quot; to competing products from Cisco. Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.

In August 2011, Juniper and AT&amp;T announced they would jointly develop the AT&amp;T Mobile Security application based on Juniper&#x27;s Pulse security software. In May 2012, Juniper released a series of new features for the web security software it acquired from Mykonos Software that February. Mykonos&#x27; software is focused on deceiving hackers by presenting fake vulnerabilities and tracking their activity. In January 2014, Juniper announced the Firefly Suite of security and switching products for virtual machines. The following month Juniper Networks released several products for &quot;intrusion deception&quot;, which create fake files, store incorrect passwords and change network maps in order to confuse hackers that have already penetrated the network perimeter.
An analysis of Juniper&#x27;s ScreenOS firmware code in December 2015 discovered a backdoor key using Dual EC DRBG allowing to passively decrypt the traffic encrypted by ScreenOS. This backdoor was inserted in the year 2008 into the versions of ScreenOS from 6.2.0r15 to 6.2.0r18 and from 6.3.0r12 to 6.3.0r20 and gives any user administrative access when using a special master password. Some analysts claim that this backdoor still exists in ScreenOS. Stephen Checkoway was quoted in Wired that &quot;If this backdoor was not intentional, then, in my opinion, it&#x27;s an amazing coincidence.&quot;

In December 2015, Juniper Systems announced that they had discovered &quot;unauthorized code&quot; in the ScreenOS software that underlies their NetScreen devices, present from 2012 onwards. There were two vulnerabilities: One was a simple root password backdoor, and the other one was changing a point in Dual_EC_DRBG so that the attackers presumably had the key to use the preexisting (intentional or unintentional) kleptographic backdoor in ScreenOS to passively decrypt traffic.

===Software defined networking===
According to a 2014 SWOT analysis by MarketLine, in recent history Juniper has been focusing on software-defined networking (SDN). It acquired SDN company Contrail Systems in December 2012. The following month Juniper announced its SDN strategy, which included a new licensing model based on usage and new features for the Junos operating system. In February 2013, Juniper released several SDN products, including the application provisioning software, Services Activation Director and the Mobile Control Gateway appliance.

In May 2013, Juniper announced an SDN controller called JunosV Contrail, using technology it acquired through Contrail Systems. A series of SDN products were released in February 2014, such as a network management software product, Junos Fusion, and an SDN controller called NorthStar. Northstar helps find the optimal path for data to travel through a network.

Every year, since 2009, Juniper holds SDN Throwdown competition to encourage students from universities across the world to access NorthStar Controller and build a solution around it to optimize network throughput. In the 2019 competition, team led by Sumit Maheshwari (Rutgers University) took first place. Jialu Sun (Santa Clara University) led his team to a second-place finish.

===Recent updates===
In March 2015, Juniper announced a series of updates to the PTX family of core routers, the QFX family of switches, as well as updates to its security portfolio. According to a report published by technology consulting firm LexInnova, as of June 2015 Juniper Networks was the third largest recipient of network security-related patents with portfolio of 2,926 security-related patents.

In October 2018, Juniper announced a new offering called EngNet, which is a set of developer tools and information meant to help companies move toward automation, and replace the typical command-line interface.

==Operations==
Juniper Networks has operations in more than 100 countries. Around 50% of its revenue is from the United States, 30% is from EMEA and 20% is from Asia. Juniper sells directly to businesses, as well as through resale and distribution partners, such as Ericsson, IBM, Nokia, IngramMicro and NEC. About 50% of Juniper&#x27;s revenues are derived from routers, 13% from switches, 12% comes from IT security and 25% from services.

According to a 2013 report by Glassdoor, Juniper Networks has the highest paid software engineers in the technology sector by a margin of about $24,000 per year. It operates the Juniper Networks Academic Alliance (JNAA) program, which scouts fresh college graduates.

According to a SWOT analysis by MarketLine, Juniper has &quot;a strong focus&quot; on research and development. R&amp;D expenses have been between 22 and 25% of revenue from 2011 to 2013. Most of the company&#x27;s manufacturing is outsourced to three manufacturing companies: Celestica, Flextronics and Accton Technology. Juniper operates the Junos Innovation Fund, which was started with $50 million in 2010 and invests in early-stage technology companies developing applications for the Junos operating system. As of 2011, Juniper Networks invested in 20 companies. This is estimated to be 1 to 2% of the companies it has evaluated for a potential investment.

== ScreenOS Backdoor ==
In December 2015, Juniper issued an emergency security patch for a backdoor in its security equipment. Together with another vulnerability it allowed to bypass authentication and decrypt VPN traffic on ScreenOS. Analysis showed that the mechanism of the backdoor was created by the NSA, but might later have been taken over by an unnamed national government.

<doc id="675429" wikidata="Q3378857" url="?curid=675429" title="Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters">
<text>Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters (PTC) is one of the oldest existing roller coaster manufacturing companies in the world. Based in Hatfield, Pennsylvania, it was established in 1904 by Henry B. Auchy and Chester Albright under the name Philadelphia Toboggan Company. The company manufactured carousels, wooden roller coasters, toboggans (roller coaster cars) and later, roller coaster trains.

== History ==
The Philadelphia Toboggan Company was incorporated on January 20, 1904.
It built and designed roller coasters until 1979. Notable designers included Joe McKee, John A. Miller, Herbert Schmeck, Frank Hoover, and John C. Allen. When Allen retired as president in 1976, the company stopped designing roller coasters but continued to work on coaster projects until 1979 when it exited the coaster-construction industry permanently.

The company manufactured carousels known for their elaborate carvings and decorations. It expanded with the acquisition of the inventory of the Dentzel Carousel Company in 1927. Lead carvers included Daniel Carl Muller, Leo Zoller, John Zalar, and Frank Caretta. Examples of the company&#x27;s carousels (manufactured 1904–1934) exist throughout the United States.

The Philadelphia Toboggan Company built the Rollo Coaster at Idlewild Park in 1938, and the carousel for the same amusement park in 1931. The company manufactured Skee Ball games from 1946 to 1977. In 1926, PTC was granted a trademark on a new name, Philtobco.

===Flying Turns===

Developed by J. Norman Bartlett and John Miller, the Flying Turns coasters came to the attention of PTC. Recognizing the ride&#x27;s potential, PTC signed a licensing agreement with Bartlett and Miller to market the ride in North America—with the exception of the state of California. With the arrival of the Great Depression, PTC built only one in 1931, at Rocky Point Amusement Park. The coaster was engineered by Herbert Schmeck, but experienced problems. The ride opened late in the summer and Schmeck stayed on site for some time before he was able to get the ride operating consistently. The ride was damaged beyond repair by a storm on September 21, 1938.

Schmeck engineered a second Flying Turns for Hershey Park in August 1941. Due to the entry of the United States into World War II, and the resulting rationing of building materials, the roller coaster was never built. It would have been located in the park next to what is now the Wave Swinger, and part of where Comet&#x27;s lift hill is located. Though Bartlett and Miller went on to build several more Flying Turns-type coasters, PTC never proposed another.

===1990s to present===

On November 27, 1991, Tom Rebbie and Bill Dauphinee purchased the Philadelphia Toboggan Company from Sam High (1934–2011), and incorporated a new company, Philadelphia Toboggan Coaster, shortly thereafter. Rebbie was appointed president. In 2007 he bought out Dauphinee to become the sole owner, and changed the company&#x27;s name to Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters, Inc. (PTCI). The company continues to manufacture roller coaster trains, queue gates and fin brakes.

==List of roller coasters==

As of 2019, Philadelphia Toboggan Coasters has built 127 roller coasters around the world.

== Carousels ==
Most PTC carousels were numbered, so they are easily identified. Most have been moved from their original opening locations. PTC carousels that are still operating or in restoration:

== Funhouse items ==

Beginning before World War II, PTC was involved with the booming dark ride and funhouse business. It spawned the company Funni-Frite Industries of Lancaster, Columbus, and (later) Pickerington, Ohio, which ceased manufacturing operations in 2000.

<doc id="675433" wikidata="Q203877" url="?curid=675433" title="Zimmerwald">
<text>Zimmerwald () was an independent municipality in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland until 31 December 2003. It is located on a hill in the proximity of the city of Bern in the Bernese Mittelland. On 1 January 2004 Zimmerwald united with the municipality of Englisberg to form the new municipality of Wald.

On 31 December 2002 the population was 870. The coat of arms is three fir trees on three green mountain peaks with a background that ranges from silver to green.



==History==
Zimmerwald was only settled in the late phase of the Germanic colonisation of Switzerland. Between 800 and 900, Ciberni entering Southern Germany first settled on the &quot;Längenberg&quot; (Long Mountain), the hill on which Zimmerwald lies. The town is first mentioned in documents in the later Middle Ages. In 1999, Zimmerwald celebrated its 700th anniversary.

Zimmerwald is remembered in world history for the Zimmerwald Conference held in September 1915. Prominent socialists met from across Europe, among them Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin. The conference was called by Robert Grimm of Bern. The international workers&#x27; movement split as a result of the conference into a social democratic and a revolutionary wing.

==Sites of interest==

===Wind instruments museum===
The collection of the Zimmerwald wind instruments museum covers some 1,000 wind instruments from all periods, as well as percussion instruments. They include rare pieces such as bull horns, old Germanic lures, serpents and flap trumpets, but also Swiss alphorns.

<doc id="675436" wikidata="Q4735040" url="?curid=675436" title="Alpha Gamma Omega">
<text>Alpha Gamma Omega (, or AGO) is an American Christian fraternity. It was founded in 1927 at University of California, Los Angeles and now has chapters at universities in California, Colorado, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Virginia. 

==History ==
Alpha Gamma Omega was founded in 1927 at University of California, Los Angeles as a Christ-centered fraternity. 

The preamble to the fraternity&#x27;s constitution is as follows:

Alpha Gamma Omega has chartered chapters across the United States. It maintains a close relationship with its Christian sorority counterpart, Alpha Delta Chi, considered the fraternity&#x27;s &quot;sister sorority.&quot; Its headquarters is located in Laguna Beach, California. 

== Symbols ==
Alpha and Omega represent the sovereign majesty of God and His dominion and lordship over all things. These letters come from the book of Revelation, where Jesus Christ says, &quot;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.&quot; The letter Gamma, the third letter in the Greek alphabet, represents Christ, which itself begins with &quot;C&quot;, the third letter of the English alphabet.

<text>Fort Donelson National Battlefield preserves Fort Donelson and Fort Heiman, two sites of the American Civil War Forts Henry and Donelson Campaign, in which Union Army Brigadier General Ulysses S. Grant and Flag Officer Andrew Hull Foote captured three Confederate forts and opened two rivers, the Tennessee River and the Cumberland River, to control by the Union Navy. The commanders received national recognition for their victories in February 1862, as they were the first major Union successes of the war. The capture of Fort Donelson and its garrison by the Union led to the capture of Tennessee&#x27;s capital and industrial center, Nashville, which remained in Union hands from February 25, 1862, until the end of the war, and gave the Union effective control over much of Tennessee. This struck a major blow to the Confederacy early in the war.

The main portion of the park, in Dover, Tennessee, commemorates the Battle of Fort Donelson (). Fort Heiman, in nearby Calloway County, Kentucky, was a Confederate battery in the Battle of Fort Henry.

== History ==

The most vulnerable area in the Confederate defensive line in the Western Theater was the state of Kentucky. The Tennessee and Cumberland rivers were potential avenues for a Union invasion of the South through Kentucky and into Tennessee and beyond. Since Kentucky had declared neutrality, the Confederacy could not build defensive works within the state without risking alienating the local population. The local population in western and central Kentucky was pro-Confederate. Kentucky&#x27;s westernmost (First) congressional district elected a secessionist and Lincoln proclaimed it to be in rebellion.
Adna Anderson and William F. Foster, two engineers detached from the Confederate 1st Tennessee Infantry, set to work on May 10, 1861, to find suitable ground just inside the Tennessee border to cover the two strategic rivers. They surveyed possible sites along the Cumberland River, noting the high ridges and deep hollows near the Kentucky border. In mid-May, on the west bank of the river not far below Dover, Anderson laid out the water battery of Fort Donelson, twelve miles (19 km) from the Kentucky line. The new fort was named in honor of the Confederate General Daniel S. Donelson who, along with Colonel Bushrod Johnson of the Corps of Engineers, approved of the site. Construction was begun by a large force of men brought from the nearby Cumberland Iron Works.
==Administrative history of the park==

The site was established as Fort Donelson National Military Park on March 26, 1928. The national military park and national cemetery were transferred from the War Department to the National Park Service on August 10, 1933. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It was redesignated a national battlefield on August 16, 1985. Public Law 108-367 (October 25, 2004) increased the authorized boundary of the national battlefield from 551.69 acres (2.23 km2) to 2,000 acres (8.09 km2). On October 30, 2006, Calloway County transferred the Fort Heiman site, which was purchased through the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves&#x27; Kentucky Heritage Land Conservation Fund, to the Park Service. Fort Heiman had been listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 12, 1976.

==Park today==
The park preserves much of the original battle site, including the river batteries and the eroded remains of the fort, but the area in which the Confederate States Army attacked on February 15, 1862, is largely in private hands and occupied by residential development. The Cumberland River was dammed in the 1960s; this area is currently referred to as Lake Barkley. It covers an area roughly similar to the original river while at flood stage, as it was during the battle. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield, most of which has been conveyed to the NPS and incorporated into the battlefield park.

==Cemetery==
The Fort Donelson National Cemetery, at 15.34 acres (62,080 m2) in Stewart County, contains 670 Union dead, reinterred in 1867. There are numerous veterans from later wars. The cemetery is presently unavailable for additional burials.

<text>WLKQ-FM (102.3 MHz &quot;La Raza 102.3/107.1&quot;) is a commercial radio station licensed to Buford, Georgia, and serving Metro Atlanta. It is owned by Davis Broadcasting and airs a Regional Mexican radio format. The programming is simulcast on 107.1 WTSH-FM in Aragon.

WLKQ-FM has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 4,200 watts. Its transmitter is off Radio Park Drive in Buford, near Interstate 985. WLKQ-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio hybrid format. Its HD2 subchannel carries a Christian Contemporary music format known as The JOY FM. Its programming is also heard on FM translator station W223CQ at 92.5 MHz in Lawrenceville.

==History==
On January 1, 1970, the station first signed on as WGCO. It was owned by the Buford Broadcasting Company, along with AM 1460 WDYX (now WXEM). The station aired a mix of country music and Christian radio programming.

In 1985, Buford Broadcasting was acquired by the Joseph Family. WCGO-FM&#x27;s call sign was changed to WLKQ-FM, using the moniker &quot;Lake 102 FM.&quot; It began playing an oldies format, and with members of the Joseph Family serving in various roles, &quot;Skipper Bob&quot; was president and general sales manager, his wife Jackie as office manager, son Mark as general manager, and daughter Kathleen, known by her air name as &quot;Kay Mackie.&quot;

During the 1990s, on-air personalities included Ron Lucas (Ron Lapann), a former tug boat captain, Rick Dennis, Mike Lindsey, Steve Nichols, Ron Ricks and Sue Ryder, who later became a traffic reporter for 750 WSB using the air name Robin Reese. In its final years as an oldies station, personalities included Huey Lewis (McKeller), Vic Andrews (Cuvo), &quot;Captain&quot; Craig Kelley, Randy Robins, Karl Phillips and Rick Bagley (Ryan Bagnal). Lake 102 covered the high school game of the week announced by Mark Blumen. Sideline reports were by Jeff Taves. The radio station sales department was led by Al Garner, once the manager of soul music icon James Brown. The radio station operated profitably for many years.

Eventually the Joseph Family was offered a large price to sell the station, to be targeted to the expanding Spanish-speaking population within the coverage area of the station&#x27;s former 6,000-watt signal. In 2003, Davis Broadcasting paid $5.25 million to acquire WLKQ-FM. The Oldies format ended in April 2004, as the station began broadcasting Regional Mexican music.

On September 24, 2018, WLKQ-FM began simulcasting on WTSH-FM (107.1) in Aragon, and rebranded as &quot;La Raza 102.3/107.1&quot;. Previously, WNSY (100.1 FM) in Talking Rock, had been WLKQ-FM&#x27;s simulcast partner. (That station now simulcasts the Smooth Jazz format of co-owned WWWE (1310 AM).)

<doc id="675449" wikidata="Q7084883" url="?curid=675449" title="Old Sacramento State Historic Park">
<text>Old Sacramento State Historic Park occupies around one third of the property within the Old Sacramento Historic District of Sacramento, California. The Old Sacramento Historic District is a U.S. National Historic Landmark District. The Historic District is sometimes abbreviated as Old Sacramento, or Old Sac, and since the 1960s has been restored and developed as a significant tourist attraction.

==History==
The city of Sacramento grew up in the mid-nineteenth century as a development from Sutter&#x27;s Fort. However, the Fort was some distance from the Sacramento River, which was the main means of transport to the coast of California, and the area that would become the modern city developed along the waterfront.

Before Sacramento&#x27;s extensive levee system was put in place, the area flooded quite regularly. Because of this, the city&#x27;s streets were raised a level. Most of the sidewalks and storefronts have been filled in; however, many tunnels still remain throughout Old Sacramento and the downtown area.

By the 1960s, the area had fallen into disrepair and disrepute. A large effort was made to secure the area&#x27;s future as an outdoor living history center similar to Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Several historically significant buildings were moved or reconstructed. Those that were beyond repair were demolished.

Today, the Old Sacramento Historic District covers the area between the river frontage and Interstate 5, between I Street and the Capitol Mall. The State Historic Park comprises about a third of the total acreage of the district including half of the waterfront, a large grassy area and railroad features. Virtually all the buildings in this area date from the 19th century, the most notable dating back to the period immediately after the disastrous fire of 1852, and show a reasonable approximation of their original appearance, though they have required varying degrees of reconstruction to restore to them to that state. However, few, if any, still serve their original purpose; most of them now house restaurants, gift shops, or other businesses catering to tourists.

Old Sacramento State Historic Park attracts over 5 million visitors annually. Regular events include the Sacramento Music Festival (formerly known as the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee), Gold Rush Days, New Year&#x27;s Eve events, the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade, the World Music and Dance Festival and Mardi Gras.

==Architecture==
While the architecture from this period is commonly attributed to Victorian gold miners, characteristics of West End, such as multi-storied buildings, large arched doorways, full-height balcony windows and the use of decorative wrought-iron balconies, were most ubiquitous in parts of Spain and the Spanish colonies. This influence may be attributed to the fact that the period of Spanish, then Mexican, rule in California enjoyed immigration from all over the Atlantic, including Spain and the Canary Islands, and the Spanish colonies.

The architecture of Old Town Sacramento (formerly known as West End) exhibits observable characteristics similar to that of San Juan (Puerto Rico), Havana (Cuba), Tampico (Mexico), Seville (Spain), Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Madrid (Spain).

While the architectural style of Old Sacramento, with its wrought iron balconies and evenly spaced full-height windows may remind one of Paris, Sacramento&#x27;s oldest buildings predate the Haussmann Projects that renovated large areas of Paris in that style.

==Memorials==

The district contains many memorials to the founders of the city and of the California and transcontinental railroad and other transport systems, including the Theodore Judah monument and the Pony Express Statue.

==Current attractions==
Old Sacramento is the site of the California State Railroad Museum, the California State Military Museum, the Sacramento History Museum, the Wells Fargo History Museum and the Old Sacramento Interpretive Center.

Other attractions available for visitors include rides in horse-drawn carriages, historic trains from the former Central Pacific Railroad passenger station, and cruises on historic riverboats. A historic sternwheel riverboat, the &quot;Delta King&quot;, is moored in the river and serves as a hotel, restaurant and theater. Riverfront Park, located north of J Street, allows access to the water&#x27;s edge.

The Sacramento Valley Rail Station is just a short walk away from Old Sacramento.

==Interpretive programs==

The Old Sacramento Historical Foundation manages several programs to highlight the history of the city, including historical reenactments by costumed docents, as well as tours of Old Sacramento&#x27;s underground level. During October, there is also a special Halloween themed ghost tour.

Every Labor Day weekend, Old Sacramento holds its annual Gold Rush Days. During this time, the paved streets are covered with several tons of dirt and automobile traffic is barred from the area. Old Sac&#x27;s regular corps of costumed docents is supplemented by extra volunteers and professional reenactors to recreate life in Sacramento as it was in the mid to late 1800s.

<doc id="675456" wikidata="Q5471267" url="?curid=675456" title="Fort Hall">
<text>Fort Hall was a fort in the Western United States that was built in 1834 as a fur trading post by Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth. It was located on the Snake River in the eastern Oregon Country, now part of present-day Bannock County in southeastern Idaho. Wyeth was an inventor and businessman from Boston, Massachusetts, who also founded a post at Fort William, in present-day Portland, Oregon, as part of a plan for a new trading and fisheries company. In 1837, unable to compete with the powerful British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, based at Fort Vancouver, Wyeth sold both posts to it. Great Britain and the United States both operated in the Oregon Country in these years.

After being included in United States territory in 1846 upon settlement of the northern boundary with Canada, Fort Hall developed as an important station for emigrants through the 1850s on the Oregon Trail; it was located at the end of the common stretch from the East shared by the three far west emigrant trails. Soon after Fort Hall, the Oregon and California Trails diverged in northwesterly and southwesterly directions. An estimated 270,000 emigrants reached Fort Hall on their way west. The town of Fort Hall later developed to the east, and Pocatello developed about south on the Portneuf River.

In the 1860s, Fort Hall was the key post for the overland stage, mail and freight lines to the towns and camps of the mining frontier in the Pacific Northwest. In 1870, a New Fort Hall was constructed to carry out that function; it was located about 25 miles to the northeast. It protected stagecoach, mail and travelers to the Northwest.

Fort Hall is considered the most important trading post in the Snake River Valley. It was included within the Fort Hall Indian Reservation under the treaty of 1867. No building remains at either of its sites. The Old Fort Hall site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and the New Fort Hall site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==
This area was long inhabited by varying cultures of indigenous peoples. By the time of European encounter, the historic Shoshone and Bannock peoples had been occupying the area for centuries. It was called Botoode in Shoshoni. They were among the Plains peoples who had adopted horses to use as part of their nomadic and seasonal movement associated with hunting game, particularly bison. French trappers and British traders from Canada had traded with them long before American explorers arrived.

===Oregon Country===
In the late 1820s, Hall J. Kelley of Boston was among men who became interested in commercial possibilities in the Oregon Country, described by a later historian as offering a &quot;field of exploitation for adventurous capital&quot;. He recruited Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth, an inventor and businessman who had made the ice industry successful in Boston, to his plan to invest in an expedition to the Northwest where they would make their fortunes. They planned a joint expedition in 1831, with intentions to establish a company for fur trading and developing a salmon fishery to rival New England&#x27;s cod fishery. Organizing the expedition suffered delays and it never took place.

In 1832 Wyeth decided to proceed on his own with an independent expedition. With a company of 70-100 men, he intended to establish a fishery and trading post on the Columbia River near its confluence with the Willamette River (part of present-day Portland, Oregon). Related plans were to supply trade goods to trappers in the Rocky Mountains and possibly slaughter and dry bison for export to Cuba. A major investor in the fishery/trading post enterprise was Henry Hall, a partner of the Boston firm Tucker &amp; Williams &amp; Henry Hall. In addition to fur trading, they planned to export salmon to New England and Hawaii.

In 1832, Benjamin Louis Eulalie de Bonneville and his party had first taken wagons over the South Pass of the Rocky Mountains. This route had been rediscovered by trappers in 1824. It led back to the North Platte River valley, which was being developed as a key route in connecting the East by a wagon road to the Oregon Country. The Platte Rivers were chief transportation corridors, and the river valleys provided level land for wagons. This was the route for from the Missouri River fur ports at Independence and St. Joseph, Missouri. Other emigrants went overland starting from St. Louis, Missouri, where the fur companies and emigrant suppliers were based.

The Native Americans had used South Pass, as well as a more northerly trail which they had guided the Lewis and Clark Expedition to follow during their 1804–1806 journey into Oregon and to the Pacific Coast. It had frequent obstacles, turns and switchbacks, making it difficult for wagon trains, mules and oxen, the common beasts of burden for the emigrants.

The 1834 trappers&#x27; rendezvous was held at a meadow around Hams Fork, (near present-day Granger, Wyoming); the annual events were occasions for sales between mountain men, who were independent trappers and traders, and agents of the fur companies, who bought the furs and supplied the traders with goods. The rendezvous were organized by the fur companies and were several-day affairs that were business, but festive in nature and oiled by alcohol.

===Old Fort Hall (1834–1856)===
In July 1834, Wyeth found that, despite his contract with Milton Sublette of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, its agents at the rendezvous refused to accept his goods. They paid only to cover the advance and the forfeit, claiming that they were dissolving the business. Wyeth notified Tucker &amp; Williams of the problems. As he was left with stocks of goods, he advised them of his intention to go west about to the Snake River country (present-day southeastern Idaho) and try to do business there. He was sending word in advance to Indian tribes to bring in buffalo robes for trading.

Wyeth and his party traveled west some to the Snake near the mouth of the Portneuf. They constructed the wooden storehouses at Fort Hall. Wyeth named the fort after a major expedition investor, Henry Hall. They finished a palisade around the fort on July 31, 1834; it was the only outpost of European Americans in that area of the Oregon Country.

Because of the Oregon boundary dispute between the United States and Great Britain, the region was open to settlement and economic activity, but not any formal claims. In practice, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company maintained an effective monopoly on trade in the region. The British company controlled the Columbia River&#x27;s watershed. It shut out the independent trapper-trader mountain men and cut severely into the profit margins of the larger American overland fur trading companiesmostly organized in St. Louis. Between the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and John Jacob Astor&#x27;s near-monopoly of American fur traders with the American Fur Company, new companies regularly failed in their first half decade. Most mountain men had started to work under contract to the big companies.

When Fort Hall was completed, Wyeth continued toward the Columbia River with members of his expedition. They encountered the Methodist missionary Jason Lee on his way to start the Methodist Mission in the Willamette Valley. Once Wyeth reached the lower Columbia, he built Fort William to serve as the &#x27;envisioned&#x27; &quot;regular rendezvous point&quot; on the Columbia.

The HBC had been trapping in the Snake country for years. Using its trading post at Fort Boise, it drove Wyeth&#x27;s company out of business, and he sold Fort Hall to the HBC. The peak of the fur market had already passed, as furs were becoming scarce due to over trapping and European demand had declined due to changes in taste.

Having struggled to keep workers and failed to make enough money, in August 1837, Wyeth sold both his forts to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC). It controlled most of the fur trade in the Oregon Country (which they called the Columbia District or the Columbia Department) from their headquarters at Fort Vancouver on the Columbia River. As the British did not want American pioneers in Oregon, the HBC managers newly installed at Fort Hall discouraged pioneers. They showed new emigrants the abandoned wagons of earlier emigrants who lost their oxen. They were forced to proceed on foot with any remaining domestic animals.

===Oregon migration===
In 1843, Marcus Whitman, a missionary who had established a mission near present-day Walla Walla, Washington, led a wagon train westward from Fort Hall, despite discouragement from the British. His reports, when received back east amidst the country-wide expansionist mindset of true believers in manifest destiny, started a growing flood of settlers increasing in numbers year by year.

The settlers were reinforced by the Presidential politics with Democrats demanding a settlement of the &quot;Oregon Question&quot; and proposing a border far to the north of today&#x27;s boundary between the United States and Canada. The election year&#x27;s slogans and bad press, Democratic hawks&#x27; control of the U.S. legislatures, the steep decrease in fur market demand, and finally the declaration of war by Mexico over the annexation of their rebel state of Texas all had an accelerating effect greasing the diplomatic wrangling and finally putting an Administration-sponsored treaty before the Senate which set the current boundary, where it was quickly adopted under the wartime congressional session. No one saw any reason to embarrass their own parties or President, and fighting two wars in widely different geographic theaters was nonsensical. The treaty triggered an explosion of settlers heading west in 1846, and the Mormon Exodus had already begun in Illinois and Missouri. U.S. Army forces were assigned to send patrols and safeguard the road.

In the following years, the number of emigrant wagon trains increased dramatically as the migration of people increased to the West. Fort Hall became a welcome stop along the trail for hundreds of thousands of emigrants. It continued as an important trading post for mountain men and the Native Americans of the region, in particular the Shoshone.

In 1846, the Oregon Treaty settled boundaries in the Northwest between Great Britain (Canada) and the United States; Fort Hall was included within the US and its territories. From 1849 to 1850, Cantonment Loring, a US military camp, was located downriver from Fort Hall. Its garrison was assigned to protect the Oregon Trail, but the camp was abandoned due to long-distance supply difficulties. Instead the Army dispatched expeditions from Oregon to guard the trail to Fort Hall during each summer after 1855, as the migrations continued.

===Civil War and after===
With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, emigrant traffic declined and the Army abandoned Fort Hall. It was briefly occupied by the Volunteer soldiers of the Union Army. Flood waters of the Snake River washed away the Old Fort Hall in 1863. Fort Hall was rebuilt in 1864, on Spring Creek just north of the original Fort Hall. The old fort was taken apart to construct the new fortified stage station. The following year, the site was abandoned. The Volunteer troops moved to Camp Lander until 1866. It was located southeast of the original Fort Hall, at the junction of the Salt Lake and Boise roads.

In 1867, the United States established the Fort Hall Indian Reservation for displaced Boise and Bruneau Shoshone, with local Shoshone and Bannock included under an 1868 treaty. They had suffered years of encroachment on their territory by European American settlers. The town of Fort Hall developed about east of the old trading post and fort; both are within the reservation. In 1961, the site of the original Fort Hall, which is marked by a memorial, was declared a National Historic Landmark.

A replica of the original Fort Hall was constructed in the 1960s in Pocatello, about away, and is operated as a public museum.

==New Fort Hall==
On May 27, 1870, the US Army built another military Fort Hall on Lincoln Creek, east of the Snake River and about northeast of the old Fort Hall. Captain James Edward Putnam and a company of soldiers built the new facility. Army soldiers were garrisoned to protect stagecoach travelers, the US mail, and workers going to mining areas in the Northwest. The Army abandoned the fort on June 11, 1883.

The federal government transferred the land and barracks to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), which adapted the buildings as an Indian boarding school. This was part of a late-nineteenth century movement to establish residential schools for immersion education of Native American children to learn the English language and European-American culture. The buildings were eventually relocated to Ross Fork Creek within the reservation.

None of the original buildings remains at either site; the 1870 site is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Fort Johnson was a U.S. Army post built on bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River in modern-day Warsaw, Illinois, during the War of 1812. The fort was established in September 1814 by Major Zachary Taylor, future 12th President of the United States (1849–1850). Troops retreating from the Battle of Credit Island constructed the fort after effectively surrendering control of the upper Mississippi to the British and allied Indian tribes, including the Sauk. The fort, which held a full company of men, was completed in just a few weeks, and had a commanding view of the Mississippi valley, the mouth of the Des Moines River, and the foot of the Des Moines Rapids. Because of the chaotic situation along the Mississippi River frontier, the fort was abandoned in late October 1814 after provisions ran out. The company retreated to Cap au Gris near St. Louis.

Black Hawk described the founding of the fort and a skirmish in his autobiography:

A party of braves followed to watch where they landed, but they did not stop until they got below the Des Moines Rapids, where they came ashore and commenced building a fort. I did not want a fort in our country, as we wished to go down to the Two River country in the fall and hunt, it being our choice hunting ground, and we concluded that if this fort was built, it would prevent us from going there. We arrived in the vicinity in the evening, and encamped on a high bluff for the night. We made no fire, for fear of being observed, and our young men kept watch by turns while others slept. I was very tired, and was soon asleep. The Great Spirit, during my slumber, told me to go down the bluff to a creek, that I would there find a hollow tree cut down, and by looking in at the top of it, I would see a large snake with head erect—to observe the direction he was looking, and I would see the enemy close by and unarmed. In the morning I communicated to my braves what the Great Spirit had said to me, took one of them and went down a ravine that led to the creek. I soon came in sight of the place where they were building the fort, which was on a hill at the opposite side of the creek. I saw a great many men. We crawled cautiously on our hands and knees until we got to the bottom land, then through the grass and weeds until we reached the bank of the creek. Here I found a tree that had been cut down; I looked in at the top of it and saw a large snake, with his head raised, looking across the creek. I raised myself cautiously, and discovered nearly opposite to me, two war chiefs walking arm in arm, without guns. They turned and walked back toward the place where the men were working at the fort. In a little while they returned, walking directly towards the spot where we lay concealed, but did not come so near as before. If they had they would have been killed, for each of us had a good rifle. We crossed the creek and crawled to a cluster of bushes. I again raised myself a little to see if they were coming; but they went into the fort, and by this they saved their lives.

We recrossed the creek and I returned alone, going up the same ravine I came down. My brave went down the creek, and I, on raising the brow of a hill to the left of the one we came down, could plainly see the men at work. I saw a sentinel walking in the bottom near the mouth of the creek. I watched him attentively, to see if he perceived my companion, who had gone toward him. The sentinel stopped for some time and looked toward where my brave was concealed. He walked first one way and then the other.

I observed my brave creeping towards him, at last he lay still for a while, not even moving the grass, and as the sentinel turned to walk away, my brave fired and he fell. I looked towards the fort, and saw the whites were in great confusion, running wildly in every direction, some down the steep bank toward a boat. My comrade joined me, we returned to the rest of the party and all hurried back to Rock River, where we arrived in safety at our village. I hung up my medicine bag, put away my rifle and spear, feeling as if I should want them no more, as I had no desire to raise other war parties against the whites unless they gave me provocation. Nothing happened worthy of note until spring, except that the fort below the rapids had been abandoned and burned by the Americans.

==Fort Edwards==
In October 1815, the fort site was reoccupied by the Americans and rebuilt, christened Cantonment Davis. Troops stationed at Cantonment Davis helped to construct Fort Edwards, an important military and trading post occupied until 1824 by the U.S. Army and by traders until about 1832. Recent archaeological survey has determined the probable location of Fort Johnson/Cantonment Davis. A a federal fur trade factory operated at the fort from 1818 until 1822 when it was removed to Fort Armstrong in 1822.

<text>The Minnesota Transportation Museum (MTM, reporting mark MNTX) is a transportation museum in Saint Paul, Minnesota, United States.

MTM operates several heritage transportation sites in Minnesota and one in Wisconsin. The museum is actively involved in preserving local railroad, bus, and streetcar history.

MTM was formed in 1962 to save a streetcar that had been built and operated by Twin City Rapid Transit (TCRT) in Minneapolis–St. Paul. Many of the museum&#x27;s early members were formerly part of the Minnesota Railfans Association, which had organized railfan trips from the 1940s to the 1960s.

In 2004–2005, the organization&#x27;s streetcar operations became the Minnesota Streetcar Museum, with the steamboat &quot;Minnehaha&quot;, originally built by TCRT in a style similar to its streetcars, becoming a major attraction of the Museum of Lake Minnetonka.

== Minnehaha Depot ==

After the first streetcar, TCRT  1300, was successfully restored, other projects were examined in the time before the streetcar could be put on its own set of rails.

The Minnehaha Depot was a former Milwaukee Road depot at Minnehaha Falls. The station, built in 1875, was nicknamed &quot;The Princess&quot; because of its delicate architecture. The depot is a contributing property to the Minnehaha Historic District. Trains running on special routes have sometimes stopped at the station, and it was eventually integrated into the area streetcar system.

The depot is owned by the Minnesota Historical Society and operated by the Minnesota Transportation Museum. In 1967, the depot became the first building to be restored by the museum and it was outfitted with exhibits. In 2004, the METRO Blue Line&#x27;s Minnehaha Park station opened across the road from the old depot.

==Classic buses==
Up until 2019, Several buses from the 1940s and 1950s were also operated by the museum. Most equipment in the bus collection were built by the GMC division of General Motors, and represented the vehicles that replaced the streetcars in the Twin Cities in the 1950s. The conversion from a streetcar to bus system required two years. The last trolley run was on Hennepin Avenue on June 18, 1954.

The collection consisted of buses that once operated in and across Minnesota. The Earliest is a 1942 Mack (occasionally used in conjunction with the Commemorative Air Force) which transported war workers to the B-24 final assembly point at what is now St Paul&#x27;s Holman Field, and a block of 1953/54 GMC transit units, two of which are painted in original Twin Cities Lines colors. The buses were used in regular charter service, and once formed a very visible part of the museum&#x27;s collection, often used in wedding and corporate charters, and on the museum&#x27;s city tours.

This part of the collection was sponsored by Richfield Bus Company, who had provided maintenance and licensing to operate them.

As the museum acquired much of its bus collection from Metro Transit, the bus company sometimes requested the use of the old buses for special events.

In 2019, the entire bus collection was donated to a private party. The museum currently has no plans on acquiring new buses to replace their former collection.

==Osceola and St. Croix Valley Railway==
MTM, in conjunction with the Historical Society of Osceola, Wisconsin, operates a heritage railroad called the Osceola and St. Croix Valley Railway. Excursion trains are operated on trackage formerly owned by Wisconsin Central Ltd., now part of Canadian National Railway.

Excursion trains operate from the historic Osceola Depot, north to Dresser, Wisconsin, and southbound to and through the scenic St. Croix River Valley. Regular schedules begin on the first weekend in May, continuing through the last week of October. Special Event trains operate through the season, including Wine Tasting, the Pumpkin Train (Halloween) and Fall Leaf Viewing trains through the River Valley.

At the Osceola service area, several locomotives and pieces of rolling stock are on display. All equipment has been reconditioned to standard operating condition, including classic 1920s open-window coaches, Great Northern express coaches and a refreshment car (Baggage car 265). Locomotives currently in running condition are classic diesel-electric.

In past years the classic steam engine, Northern Pacific No. 328 (4-6-0) was used to pull the trains, but has been placed in restoration status due to its age (107 yrs).

The regular service train route runs approximately 50 minutes to/from Dresser, Wisconsin, and 100 minutes to/from Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota.

The Museum also operates the Dresser Depot at the northeast terminus of the line in Dresser, WI. The Depot has been preserved exactly as if the staff stepped out for a break, down to calendars and railroad notices. It is also the site of Pumpkin Train Park, hosting several thousand visitors during the pre-Halloween weekend.

==Jackson Street Roundhouse==

The Jackson Street Roundhouse is MTM headquarters in St. Paul, as well as a fully functional railroad roundhouse, one of the last of its kind in the country. During winter months, the Roundhouse is a functioning work area for Museum rolling stock, often with the volunteer workforce welding, grinding and sending sparks flying.

Open Wednesday &amp; Saturday, year-round, and on Friday during the summer months it is a maintenance &amp; restorations base for the museum&#x27;s locomotives and rolling stock. It is highly interactive, offering train rides (Saturdays) as well as hands-on exhibits about surface transportation history of Minnesota and the upper Midwest.

The building was erected by the Great Northern Railway in 1907, replacing another, older roundhouse. The site has been used for rail transportation since the first railroad came to Minnesota (1860s). The Roundhouse and surrounding grounds are a near complete display of American industrial history from the 19th century through the mid-20th century.

The Roundhouse is base for equipment as varied as Pullman coaches, Northern Pacific RR mail &amp; baggage cars, an operating turntable, a 200-ton lifting crane, an F7A Freight engine (under long term restoration to operating status), a Brill Car (one of the last of its kind), and Rock Island Business Car &quot;Gritty Palace&quot; - donated by the late Art Pew&#x27;s family in 2022.

The roundhouse is also home to the famous Northern Pacific Railway steam engine No. 2156, known to many Twin Cities Gen X children as Casey Jones&#x27;s steam engine, from the popular children&#x27;s program &quot;Lunch With Casey&quot; starring Roger Awsumb as Casey Jones, in the 60&#x27;s &amp; 70&#x27;s. No. 2156, having been torn down for restoration for the last decade, is undergoing stabilization to become part of a &quot;Steam Bay&quot; exhibit, demonstrating the inner workings of steam locomotives. It will be displayed next to its sister engine No. 2153, restored cosmetically to original operating configuration.

<doc id="675480" wikidata="Q5155119" url="?curid=675480" title="Como-Harriet Streetcar Line">
<text>The Como-Harriet Streetcar Line (CHSL) is a heritage streetcar line in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which follows original streetcar right-of-way between Lake Harriet and Bde Maka Ska and is operated by the Minnesota Streetcar Museum. The heritage line was originally developed in the 1970s by the Minnesota Transportation Museum which spun off streetcar operations in the winter of 2004–2005.

== Heritage line history ==
When Twin City Rapid Transit ceased streetcar operations in 1954, it donated two of its locally-built wooden streetcars to railfan groups. One of the groups receiving a streetcar (TCRT No. 1300) was the Minnesota Railfans Association, which organized railfan trips from the 1940s to the 1960s. TCRT No. 1300 was stored outside until it was acquired by the Minnesota Transportation Museum in 1962, when restoration began. By 1963, the car had been restored to operational status. It originally made only short trips along track at and near a roundhouse in St. Paul owned by the Minnesota Transfer Railway. Because there were no overhead electric lines at this location, the streetcar was powered by an electric generator behind the car. Despite these challenges, the car was extremely popular with the public.

Since public interest was so high, the museum examined options for regular operation of No. 1300. The City of Minneapolis and the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board had acquired the original streetcar right-of-way between Lake Harriet and Lakewood Cemetery near Lake Calhoun (now known as Bde Maka Ska) and in 1970 the Minnesota Transportation Museum leased the land.

On August 28, 1971, after track had been laid and a small carbarn constructed under the Queen Avenue Bridge, which passed over the original right-of-way, public operations began. Because no overhead wires had been strung to provide electricity, the trailer-mounted electrical generator continued to be used until the overhead electrical system was completed in 1973.

Continued popularity of the heritage line allowed the museum to expand from about one city block of track in 1971 to more than one mile of track. By 2005 continuous use had taken its toll on the track and a rebuilding project funded by a federal TEA-21 grant took place. Over time more streetcars were acquired and restored by the museum. Three streetcars are operated on the Como-Harriet line, although only one or two are run at any given time. The line is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Linden Hills Station ==
 The original streetcar station at Linden Hills was built one block north of the intersection of Queen Ave and 42nd Street in 1900. As time progressed TCRT desired to make Lake Harriet an entertainment destination in an effort to increase recreational ridership. At this time the company built the original Lake Harriet Bandshell and began sponsoring concerts at the lake. Because of the larger crowds being drawn to the attraction, there was a need for a larger station, and in 1914 a larger chalet-style structure replaced the original building, which was moved closer to the lake and used for other purposes. The chalet station existed until 1954 when streetcar operations ceased, at which time it was torn down.

By the time the Minnesota Transportation Museum began construction of the heritage line, all that remained was the concrete slab used as a platform for loading and unloading passengers. In 1990, the museum built a recreation of the smaller original Linden Hills Station. Today, the station is used for purchasing tokens to ride the streetcars, souvenir sales and the display of Twin City Lines history.

== Rolling stock ==

=== TCRT No. 1300 ===

The first streetcar operated by the museum was Twin City Rapid Transit Company streetcar No. 1300. The car, which now appears much like it did in the 1930s-1950s era, was built by Twin City Rapid Transit as a fast interurban streetcar in 1908, with a top speed of about 35 miles per hour (56.35 km/h). When in operation for Twin City Lines TCRT No. 1300 was based at the East Minneapolis Station (carbarn) and often operated on the original Como-Harriet route.

In 2003, TCRT No. 1300 underwent extensive overhauling of its internal wiring, exterior, and internal wood and steel support structure as it hadn&#x27;t had a major overhaul/rebuilding since the late 1940s. This was done for preparation for its 100th birthday in 2008.

=== TCRT No. 1239 ===

TCRT No. 1239 was built at the 31st Street Shops in Minneapolis and has been restored to the configuration it had when it was constructed in 1907 with a private door to the motorman&#x27;s cab in the front and double (later triple) stream wire gates for passenger access in the rear. This configuration required &quot;two-man&quot; operation, with a motorman in front who operated the streetcar, including opening and closing the gates, and a conductor at the rear who collected fares and helped with backing when necessary.

Many TCRT streetcars were converted to one-man/two-man operation in the 1930s by adding double-stream folding front doors and replacing the rear gates with similar doors. This gave TCRT the option to operate the car with only a motorman (&quot;one man&quot; operation), or, on busier routes, with a conductor and a motorman (&quot;two man&quot; operation). Because streetcar ridership remained high on many routes until the end of service in 1954, many &quot;gate cars&quot; with single-stream front folding doors remained in service until the end. TCRT No. 1239 returned to service in September 2004.

=== TCRT PCC No. 322 ===

TCRT built most of its own streetcars in its own shops (31st Street in Minneapolis from 1898 through 1907 and Snelling in St. Paul from 1907 through the late 1920s). But a number of faster and more modern streamlined vehicles were purchased in the 1940s to better compete with the growing prevalence of the automobile. TCRT No. 322 was a Presidents&#x27; Conference Committee, or PCC streetcar built by the St. Louis Car Company in 1946. It operated in the Twin Cities until it was sold in 1953 to Public Service Coordinated Transit in New Jersey, one of thirty streetcars purchased for use in the Newark City Subway. It was later sold to the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit in Cleveland, Ohio in 1978 to replace two wreck-damaged cars. After the car was acquired by the museum in 1990, it underwent ten years of restoration, entering service in 2000.

<doc id="675481" wikidata="Q1413867" url="?curid=675481" title="Fort Devens">
<text>Fort Devens is a United States Army Reserve military installation in the towns of Ayer and Shirley, in Middlesex County and Harvard in Worcester County in the U.S. state of Massachusetts. Due to extensive environmental contamination it was listed as a superfund site in 1989. Most of the fort&#x27;s land was sold off in 1996, but the cantonment area of the post was retained by the Army as the Devens Reserve Forces Training Area (RFTA). Fort Devens was reactivated in May 2007, though no units of active Army have been located there. The Devens Range Complex operates on property in Lancaster, south of Route 2, for live-fire training with small arms, machine guns, grenades, and rockets.

In 2011, the fort had a population of 306 enlisted personnel, 2,151 reservists, 348 civilians, and 1,399 family members, and maintained 25 ranges, 21 training areas, and 15 maneuver areas on nearly of land. It was home to the United States Army Base Camp Systems Integration Laboratory as well as the United States Army System Integration Laboratory.

Part of the former area of the military base is now home to Federal Medical Center, Devens, a federal prison for male inmates requiring specialized or long-term medical or mental health care.

== History ==

===Establishment during World War I===
Camp Devens, named after jurist and Civil War general Charles Devens, was established on September 5, 1917, as a temporary cantonment for training soldiers during World War I. About of land was leased then later purchased from 112 owners who sold 230 parcels of land in the towns of Ayer, Harvard, Lancaster and Shirley by the federal government. Some was fine farmland along the Nashua River and other was &quot;sprout&quot; land where trees had been cut leaving stumps.

The Fort&#x27;s siting was due primarily to its location at a major hub of the rail network in New England. Construction, by the largest labor force assembled in the United States, to build an entire city for 10,000 requiring barracks, training buildings, water and sewer systems, raced at the rate of 10.4 new buildings every day. It was a reception center for war selectees and became a demobilization center after the war. As one of 16 temporary cantonments, Camp Devens processed and trained more than 100,000 soldiers. Three divisions (the 12th, the 26th and the 76th) were activated and trained at Devens during the war. 

In 1918, Camp Devens, was afflicted by the late 1918 deadly second wave of the 1918 flu pandemic. Approximately 850 soldiers, mostly privates, died at the camp during 1918 from the Spanish flu.

=== Between World Wars ===

In 1918, it became a separation center for over 150,000 troops upon their return from France. Put on inactive status, it served next as a summer training camp for National Guardsmen, Reservists and ROTC cadets.

In 1920, following years of debate regarding preparedness for another global war, passage of the National Defense Act established an important role for the citizen army. 

In 1927, appropriations were made for permanent construction of buildings, but the stock market crash nearly called a halt. Congresswoman Edith Nourse Rogers, of Lowell, recognized the economic significance of Camp Devens to this largely agricultural community. 

In 1929, Robert Goddard briefly used the post for his rocket operations. 

In 1931, through her efforts, Camp Devens became Fort Devens, a permanent US Army post in 1931. However, during the depression, construction was slow; most of the work was done by the Works Progress Administration. A few years later, Fort Devens Army Airfield was established.

===World War II===
In 1940, at the onset of World War II, Fort Devens was designated a reception center for all men in New England who would serve one year as draftees. A massive $25 million building project was begun, including more than 1200 wooden buildings and an airfield. The 1st, 32nd, and 45th Divisions trained at Devens during the war. Devens also housed a prisoner-of-war camp for German and Italian prisoners from 1944 to 1946. It was designated as early as 1942 for detaining enemy aliens of Italian, German and Japanese birth.

===Post World War II===
The 7th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division was located at Fort Devens from 1946 to 1950. Already at reduced strength, the regiment was further decimated when a battalion from Fort Devens was reflagged as the 3d Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, and sent to Korea to join the 1st Cavalry Division. The 7th Infantry deployed to San Francisco, California and sailed for Japan on 20 August 1950, arriving on 16 September 1950 to marry-up with the 15th Infantry Regiment and the division headquarters.

Fort Devens hosted the Army Security Agency Training Center &amp; School (ASATC&amp;S) from April 1951 to 1996.
In the 1950s or 1960s the fort was home to the 56th Air Defense Artillery Brigade, part of 1st Region, Army Air Defense Command.

On 15 February 1958 the 2d Infantry Brigade was reactivated at Fort Devens, Massachusetts as the Pentomic 2nd Infantry Brigade with its own shoulder sleeve insignia. It spent the next five years training in northern Massachusetts and Cape Cod. The Brigade was prepared to support the Marines landing in the 1958 Lebanon crisis but did not deploy.
* Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Company
* 1st Battle Group, 4th Infantry
* 2nd Battle Group, 60th Infantry
* 1st Battalion, 76th Artillery
* Company F, 34th Armor
* Company G, 34th Armor
* Troop F, 5th Cavalry
* Brigade Trains
* Two engineer companies

The 2d Infantry Brigade was inactivated on 19 February 1963 at Fort Devens; in 1962 when it was reflagged as 2d Brigade, 5th Infantry Division. It was reactivated on 23 October 1963 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2d Brigade, 1st Infantry Division and moved (with the rest of the Division) to Fort Riley, Kansas in January 1964.

From 1968 to 1995, Fort Devens was the home of the 10th Special Forces Group. It also served as a training center for members of the Army Reserve and National Guard.

===Units remaining near base closure===
Fort Devens was the home of the 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), less 1st Battalion based in (West) Germany, from 1968 until the Group&#x27;s move to Fort Carson, Colorado in 1995. It was also the home of the 39th Engineer Battalion (CBT) until the 39th was inactivated in 1992. The 39th Engineer (CBT) was reactivated in 2014 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The Army Security Agency Training Center &amp; School (ASATC&amp;S) was established at Devens in April 1951. In 1976 it became known as the U.S. Army Intelligence School, Devens, or USAISD, and was moved to Fort Huachuca, Arizona in 1996. The 36th Medical Battalion including the 595th Medical Company and the 46th Combat Support Hospital, the 46th CSH was inactivated July 15, 1994. Finally, the 624th Military Police Company was stationed until the post closed.
Headquarters, Army Readiness Region I and Readiness Group Devens were also located there in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The mission was to assist the training of reserve component units, state National Guard and Army Reserve units in New York and New England. Other subordinate Readiness Groups were located at Secena Army Depot and Fort Hamilton in NYC. Exact establishment dates and/or inactivation dates could not be found.

===Closure, 1996===

The U.S. Army post which resided at Fort Devens was officially closed in 1996 after 79 years of service.

The Base Realignment and Closure process for land distribution for all parcels on the former Fort Devens allowed the Federal Bureau of Prisons, Shriver Job Corps, Massachusetts National Guard, Massachusetts Veterans and MassDevelopment to acquire the land. The bulk of the land was purchased by MassDevelopment for $17 million with the aim of turning Devens into a residential and business community. The Bureau of Prisons used its land for the Federal Medical Center, Devens, a prison hospital.

Since the closing of the military base, many of the existing buildings have been renovated or reconstructed; housing developments now exist, along with a growing business park, a new hotel, restaurants, several public and private schools, a disc golf course, and a golf course. Veterans of the Army Security Agency have also expressed interest in building a museum there as Fort Devens was their principal training facility for nearly 25 years.

===More recent===
Devens became a United States Army Reserve installation under the command the Army Installation Management Command (IMCOM) with an Army Reserve, Massachusetts Army National Guard and Marine Corps Reserve presence. In 2007 the headquarters of the 94th Regional Readiness Command, which was responsible for the command and control of Army Reserve units throughout New England, as well as providing Army Reserve support for Federal Emergency Management Agency operations in the New England region, was disbanded under the consolidation of forces and buildings within the area came under the control of the 99th Regional Support Command, which is located at Fort Dix, New Jersey, and whose Commanding General serves as the Senior Commander for Ft. Devens. The units with the original 94th Regional Readiness Command were realigned with similar commands along the East Coast. The base still remained an active training site for Reserve and National Guard Forces as well as regional law enforcement agencies.

The Army announced in 2008 that it would build a new training center in the area. This was dedicated in 2011 as the David S. Connolly Armed Forces Reserve Center. The three buildings total 280,000 square feet and are on 57 acres. It also supported 650 Army Reserve and Army National Guard Soldiers and Marines, and included space to store nearly 800 military vehicles. The total cost was $100 million.

In January 2011 a group of Devens residents filed a citizens&#x27; petition for Devens to become a legally incorporated town. Efforts to make Devens the state&#x27;s 352nd town failed on the local level in 2006. As of 2018, Devens is &quot;a regional enterprise zone and census-designated place in the towns of Ayer and Shirley, in Middlesex County and Harvard in Worcester County,&quot; (see Fort Devens (CDP), Massachusetts).

In March 2021, Commonwealth Fusion Systems established a 47-acre commercial site within the former Fort Devens. This facility is to be used for development and manufacture of fusion power equipment and plants, none of which were yet in commercial use anywhere worldwide as of 2021.

==Environmental contamination==
On December 21, 1989, Fort Devens was listed as superfund because historic underground storage tanks/fuel depots had contaminated soils with heavy metals and petroleum products.

In 2016, the Army started looking for PFAS, which it detected in groundwater and in the municipal water supply wells for Devens and the Town of Ayer. 
In May 2021, Restoration Advisory Board community members were concerned about PFAs making their way into the Nashua River, especially with water from the river being used to irrigate crops in communities downstream. They also discussed progress of the pump and treat system to get dissolved arsenic and iron at the 84-acre Shepley&#x27;s Hill landfill site out of the groundwater remediation. As of 2022, there is ongoing groundwater remediation at the former Moore Army Airfield and the former Shepley&#x27;s Hill Landfill in addition to long-term groundwater monitoring at four petroleum contaminated sites.

==Cemetery==
Fort Devens has a cemetery which has the graves of U.S. military personnel, their dependents and about 20 German and Italian prisoners of war who died there either during or shortly after World War II. A number of graves predate the fort&#x27;s establishment as they were relocated after the closure of several coast defense forts in Boston Harbor after World War II.

The oldest grave is that of 1st Lieutenant Robert F. Massie of the Corps of Artillery, who was killed in a sword duel with First Lieutenant Gustavus S. Drane at Fort Independence, in Boston Harbor, on Christmas Day 1817. The legend that Lieutenant Drane mysteriously disappeared after the duel and his remains were later discovered in a walled off part of Fort Independence is not true. In reality, Drane was later promoted to captain and continued to serve in the Army until his death in 1846. Massie was originally buried at Fort Independence, and his remains were relocated to Fort Devens, along with others buried at Forts in Boston Harbor, in the 1950s after the forts were closed.

Lieutenant Edward John Kent Johnson of the Confederate States Navy died as a prisoner of war at Fort Warren in 1863. He was originally buried at Fort Warren but his remains were moved to Deer Island and Governors Island in Boston Harbor before being moved to Fort Devens in 1939. In 2002 his remains were finally returned to his home state of Florida.

==In media==
&quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; broadcast on December 20, 1942 was recorded at Fort Devens.

The fort is the setting for the play &quot;Court-Martial at Fort Devens&quot; by Jeffrey Sweet. Based on a true story, it tells of two Black WACs at the fort during World War II who went on strike after facing prejudicial treatment, and were subsequently court-martialed.

<doc id="675485" wikidata="Q177813" url="?curid=675485" title="Apollo et Hyacinthus">
<text>Apollo et Hyacinthus, K. 38, is an opera in three acts written in 1767 by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, who was 11 years old at the time. It is Mozart&#x27;s first true opera (when one considers that &quot;Die Schuldigkeit des ersten Gebots&quot; is simply a sacred drama). As is suggested by the name, the opera is based upon the Greek myth of Hyacinth and Apollo as told by Roman poet Ovid in his &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;. Interpreting this work, Rufinus Widl wrote the libretto in Latin.

== History ==
After notable success in other areas of Europe, Mozart was commissioned to compose a piece for the Benedictine University in his hometown of Salzburg where it was first performed on 13 May 1767. Mozart&#x27;s father, Leopold, was a notable name at the university, as many of his pupils were enrolled in the university high school, where theatre played a large role in the curriculum.

Mozart&#x27;s first encounter with the university was at the age of five on September 1 and 3, 1761, when he appeared as an extra in Jakob Anton Wimmer and Johann Ernst Eberlin&#x27;s Latin Drama &quot;Sigismundes Hungariae Rex&quot;. Though Mozart was often involved at the university, he was never enrolled as a student.

&quot;Apollo et Hyacinthus&quot; was part of a much larger work, which has caused debate as to whether this work can be considered Mozart&#x27;s first &#x27;operatic work&#x27;. Many historians consider it to be operatic because it is a secular drama composed of five arias, two duets, a chorus and a trio, connected with recitative. However, it was part of the annual end-of-term &#x27;final comoedia&#x27; and did not even receive a distinguishing name until Mozart&#x27;s sister Nannerl entered it into Leopold&#x27;s catalogue of his son&#x27;s early works with the name after the composer&#x27;s death. The custom at the university was to perform short musical dramas or &#x27;intermedia&#x27; interspersed between acts of the larger play. This particular performance was of the five-act tragedy &quot;Clementia Croesi&quot;, written by the university&#x27;s philosophy professor Rufinus Widl. The main work and Mozart&#x27;s intermedia were designed by Widl to share general motifs and themes. Widl&#x27;s tragedy dealt with the accidental death of the son of the King of Lydia by a misplaced spear throw. Mozart&#x27;s work paralleled this theme by mounting a story first told by Euripides. In the original story, Apollo accidentally kills his lover, a boy named Hyacinth, with one of his stray discus throws. The discus throw was encouraged by Apollo&#x27;s rival, Zephyrus, jealous of his affair with Hyacinth. A grief-stricken Apollo then causes a gorgeous flower to bloom from Hyacinth&#x27;s grave. Father Rufinus retained the outlined of this plot but removed the controversial themes of a homosexual love triangle by adding in two new characters: Hyacinth&#x27;s father Oebalus and his sister Melia, the new source of Apollo&#x27;s love and the jealousy of Zephyr. The performance was a great success but was only performed once during the composer&#x27;s lifetime.

== Roles ==

== Plot summary ==

Act 1 – Following the short intrada in D major, the work opens with the prologue where Hyacinth confides in Zephyr of the youth&#x27;s attachment to Apollo and of Zephyr&#x27;s jealousy. Next, King Oebalus and Melia appear at an altar where they are preparing a sacrifice to Apollo. A storm soon begins to brew and destroys the altar with lightning. Oebalus&#x27;s son assures him that they have done nothing to conjure the wrath of Apollo. Towards the end of the prologue, Apollo appears, disguised as a shepherd. He announces that Jupiter has banished him and he asks for Oebalus&#x27;s friendship, which he is quickly given. Soon, a mutual attraction is aroused between Melia and Apollo and he asks of evidence of her love for him.

Act 2 – Oebalus tells Melia that Apollo has requested her hand and Melia is overjoyed. However, Zephyr soon enters with the terrible news that, while sporting in the woods, Apollo threw a discus and fatally struck Hyacinth in the head. Oebalus, in a rage, orders Apollo to be banished from his kingdom. Zephyr, in an aside to the audience, confesses his guilt but eagerly obeys Oebalus&#x27;s order and then proceeds to make advances on Melia in Apollo&#x27;s absence. Melia refuses to consider Zephyr&#x27;s advances. While he is making these inappropriate advances on Melia, Apollo appears, professes his innocence and turns Zephyr into a wind. Melia still believes Apollo to be the murderer of her brother and now begins to deny Apollo&#x27;s advances.

Act 3 – The final act begins with the final breaths of Hyacinth where he describes the real cause of his murder to his father. Oebalus realizes Zephyr&#x27;s guilt while he watches his own son die. Melia then enters and tells her father that she has denied Apollo before she learns of Zephyr&#x27;s guilt as well. Oebalus and Melia wallow in their misfortune and the loss of the favor of their protecting god before Apollo again appears, claiming that love has compelled him to return to Melia. Beautiful flowers then rise from Hyacinth&#x27;s grave, Apollo and Melia are engaged and Apollo ensures that the kingdom will flourish forever under his protection.

== Musical characteristics ==

Most of the arias in this work embody emotional states, set up in the recitatives. The majority of these are da capo arias that repeat the text and music of the A-section, directly after a contrasting B-section. Sometimes, however Mozart removes the repeat; for example, Apollo&#x27;s short E major aria which concludes the prologue ends with the instrumental ritornello but no text repeat from the singer. The most impressive writings in this work, though, may be the ones featuring multiple characters. These pieces display a firm grasp of the techniques of 18th-century dramatic composition from the eleven-year old Mozart. The moving C major duet between Oebalus and Melia is an extraordinary composition featuring a through-composed style with enticing orchestral effects – such as muted violins, under which the rest of the strings play pizzicato. The scene that opens the second chorus is when Hyacinth dies in the presence of his father. This piece is a brilliant example of music&#x27;s dramatic function and is also the first example of accompanied recitative in all of Mozart&#x27;s music.

<text>Janet Evanovich (née Schneider; April 22, 1943) is an American writer. She began her career writing short contemporary romance novels under the pen name Steffie Hall, but gained fame authoring a series of contemporary mysteries featuring Stephanie Plum, a former lingerie buyer from Trenton, New Jersey, who becomes a bounty hunter to make ends meet after losing her job. The novels in this series have been on &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; and Amazon bestseller lists. Evanovich has had her last seventeen Plums debut at #1 on the &quot;NY Times&quot; Best Sellers list and eleven of them have hit #1 on &quot;USA Today&quot; Best-Selling Books list. She has over two hundred million books in print worldwide, and her books have been translated into over 40 languages.

== Early years ==
Evanovich is a second-generation American born in South River, New Jersey, to a machinist and a housewife. After attending South River High School, she became the first in her family to attend college when she enrolled at Douglass Residential College, part of Rutgers University, to study art.

When Evanovich had children, she chose to become a housewife like her mother. In her thirties, she began writing novels. To learn the art of writing dialog, Evanovich took lessons in improv acting. For ten years, she attempted to write the Great American Novel, finishing three manuscripts that she was unable to sell. After someone suggested she try writing romance novels, Evanovich read several romances and discovered that she enjoyed the genre. She wrote two romances and submitted them for publishing. Still unable to find a publisher, Evanovich stopped writing and signed with a temporary employment agency. Several months after beginning work for them, she received an offer to buy her second romance manuscript for $2,000, which she considered an &quot;astounding sum&quot;.

==Romance novels==
That novel, &quot;Hero at Large&quot;, was published in 1987 in the Second Chance Love category line under the pseudonym Steffie Hall. The following year she began writing for Bantam Loveswept under her own name. For the next five years she continued to write category romances for Loveswept. Her work within the romance novel genre helped her learn to create likable characters and attractive leading men. In this time, Evanovich also became known for the humor that filled her novels. She believes that &quot;it&#x27;s very important to take a comic approach. If we can laugh at something, we can face it.&quot;

After finishing her twelfth romance, however, Evanovich realized that she was more interested in writing the action sequences in her novels than the sex scenes. Her editors were not interested in her change of heart, so Evanovich took the next eighteen months to formulate a plan for what she actually wanted to write.

===Stephanie Plum Series===
She quickly decided that she wanted to write romantic adventure novels. She wanted to include humor, romance and adventure in her work and this fit into her style of mystery novel. Unlike the style of romance novels, her books would be told in first person narrative. Her new type of writing should contain heroes and heroines, as well as &quot;a sense of family and community&quot;. In that vein, she intended her new style of writing to be based on the TV sitcom model. Like Seinfeld, her new books would have a central character that the rest of the cast of characters revolve around.

Inspired by the Robert De Niro movie &quot;Midnight Run&quot;, Evanovich decided that her heroine would be a bounty hunter. This occupation provided more freedom for Evanovich as a writer, as bounty hunters do not have a set work schedule and are not forced to wear a uniform. The profession is also &quot;romanticised to some extent&quot;. To become acquainted with the demands of the career, Evanovich spent a great deal of time shadowing bond enforcement agents. She also researched more about the city of Trenton, where she wanted her books to be set.

In 1994, her initial romantic adventure, &quot;One for the Money&quot;, was published to good reviews. This was the first of a light-hearted series of mysteries starring barely competent bounty hunter Stephanie Plum. &quot;One for the Money&quot; was named a &quot;New York Times&quot; notable book, a &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; Best Book of 1994 and a &quot;USA Today&quot; Best Bet.

Evanovich has continued to write romantic adventures starring Plum. The sixth book in the series, &quot;Hot Six&quot;, was the first of her novels to reach number one on the New York Times Best Seller List. Her subsequent Plum novels have each debuted at number one. &quot;All About Romance&quot; has described her as the &quot;rare breed of romance author who has left the genre and yet not alienated her many romance fans&quot;.

The Plum novels have taken many attributes from Evanovich&#x27;s own life. Evanovich shares many commonalities with Plum. Both are from New Jersey, both devour Cheetos, both had owned a hamster, and both have shared &quot;similar embarrassing experiences&quot;. The character Grandma Mazur is loosely based on Evanovich&#x27;s Grandma Fanny and Aunt Lena. Evanovich claims the spirited elderly lady is &quot;who I want to be when I grow up&quot;.

Shortly before &quot;One for the Money&quot; was released, Evanovich sold the movie rights to Columbia TriStar for $1 million. Lions Gate Entertainment released &quot;One for the Money&quot; on January 27, 2012. The film stars Katherine Heigl as Stephanie Plum, Sherri Shepherd from &quot;The View&quot; as Lula, Debbie Reynolds as Grandma Mazur, Jason O&#x27;Mara as Joe Morelli, and Daniel Sunjata as Ranger. It was directed by Julie Anne Robinson.

===Knight &amp; Moon Series===
In 2016 Evanovich released the first book, &quot;Curious Minds&quot;, in her new Knight &amp; Moon mystery series. Co-authored with Phoef Sutton, the book introduces two new characters, Emerson Knight and Riley Moon. Emerson Knight is a rich, eccentric introvert with little-to-no sense of social etiquette. He is also brilliant and handsome. Riley Moon is a recent Harvard Law and Harvard Business graduate. Her aggressive Texas spitfire attitude helped her land her dream job as a junior analyst at Blane-Grunwald where Emerson is a client. Together this unlikely duo finds themselves thrust into solving the most difficult of mysteries.

&quot;Dangerous Minds&quot;, the second book in the series, was written by Evanovich and released in June 2017. 

===Wicked Series===
In 2010 Evanovich published &quot;Wicked Appetite&quot;, spinning off the character Diesel from the between the numbers Plum books. The heroine of &quot;Wicked Appetite&quot; is sweet cupcake baker Lizzie Tucker, who, unlike Stephanie Plum, can cook. The &quot;Wicked&quot; series is set in Salem, Massachusetts. In the series, Diesel &amp; Lizzie search for the seven stones of power, each representing a different deadly sin. Lizzie &amp; Diesel are &quot;Unmentionables&quot;, humans with additional powers. Their rivals for the stones are Diesel&#x27;s dark cousin, Gerwulf &quot;Wulf&quot; Grimoire, introduced in &quot;Plum Spooky&quot; and his medieval-esque minion Hatchet. Lizzie&#x27;s animal companions are one-eyed Cat 7143 and Carl the Monkey, from &quot;Fearless Fourteen&quot; and &quot;Plum Spooky&quot;. Her friends include Glo, a &quot;Questionable,&quot; and Clara Dazzle, an &quot;Unmentionable&quot; who lost her powers after congress with another &quot;Unmentionable.&quot; In &quot;Wicked Appetite&quot;, the stone sought is that incarnating the sin of gluttony.

In 2012 Evanovich published &quot;Wicked Business&quot;, the second in the series. In &quot;Wicked Business&quot;, the stone embodies the sin of lust. A new villain is introduced, deranged candy heiress Deirdre Early, or Anarchy. Lizzie, through a selfless act and exchange of body fluids with Wulf, converts the lust stone into the &quot;icky true love stone&quot;, implying that in the right circumstances, the stones of sin can be converted into stones of virtue.

In 2015 Evanovich teamed up with Phoef Sutton for the third novel in the series, &quot;Wicked Charms&quot;. The Stone of Avarice (Greed) is the focus of this installment.

===Fox and O&#x27;Hare Series===
In June 2013, Evanovich published the novella &quot;Pros &amp; Cons&quot; and the novel &quot;The Heist&quot;, the first two works in a new series co-written with Lee Goldberg. Since then the series has grown to six novels (The Heist, The Chase, The Job, The Scam, The Pursuit, and The Big Kahuna), two novellas (Pros &amp; Cons and The Shell Game) and one online short-story, The Caper.

The protagonist is FBI special agent Kate O’Hare who has devoted her career to taking down one of the FBI’s most wanted con men and master thieves, Nick Fox. That is until the FBI pairs Kate with the most unlikely person, Nick Fox, to take down criminals. Together they travel the globe skirting on the edge of what is legal and illegal. Kate’s father, Jake O’Hare, a retired Special Forces operative, often aids in their quest. In June 2016, the fifth novel in the series, The Pursuit, was released.

===Other novels===
Evanovich began a collaborative effort with Charlotte Hughes because she wanted to see some of her other ideas on paper but did not have the time to write them. This resulted in the &quot;Full&quot; series. The &quot;Full&quot; series is set in Beaumont, South Carolina and features Jamie Swift and Maximillian Holt, who meet in the second &quot;Full&quot; book, &quot;Full Tilt&quot;.

The &quot;Elsie Hawkins&quot; novels are stand alone romances with a supporting character Elsie Hawkins, who is a gun totin&#x27; retiree, with tight grey curls, who &quot;doesn&#x27;t take sass from no one.&quot; Elsie drives a 1957 powder blue Cadillac that never seems to sustain damage. In the Stephanie Plum series, Grandma Mazur and Stephanie drive Uncle Sandor&#x27;s 1953 powder blue Buick, which has similar indestructibility.

In 2004, Evanovich launched another series with &quot;Metro Girl.&quot; This book debuted at Number 2 on the New York Times Best Seller List. The heroine is Alexandra Barnaby, an auto mechanic. Her love interest is Sam Hooker, a hedonistic NASCAR driver. The &quot;Motor&quot; series is set in the southern U.S. states. Further books in the series include &quot;Motor Mouth&quot; and &quot;Troublemaker 1 &amp; 2&quot; (graphic novels).

Evanovich collaborated with Stephen J. Cannell, noted TV writer and producer (&quot;A Team, Rockford Files, Baretta, 21 Jump Street&quot;), on a book entitled &quot;No Chance&quot;, which was to be the first book in a new series. It was supposed to be released in October 2007. However, in July 2007, the book was canceled. Cannell died in 2010 of melanoma.

<doc id="675491" wikidata="Q8775715" url="?curid=675491" title="In the Time of the Butterflies">
<text>In the Time of the Butterflies is a historical fiction novel by Julia Alvarez, relating a fictionalized account of the Mirabal sisters during the time of the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic. The book is written in the first and third person, by and about the Mirabal sisters. First published in 1994, the story was adapted into a feature film in 2001.

==Characters==
Minerva: The third Mirabal sister, and certainly the most headstrong. She is focused on law school, and succeeds in completing it as an adult, although Trujillo withholds her law license as revenge. She has a brief romance with the revolutionary leader &quot;Lio&quot; before she meets Manolo in law school (also a revolutionary) and marries him. She has two children, a daughter Minou and a son Manolito.

Dedé: Dede is the second Mirabal sister. She is not as certain about the revolution as her sisters and feels weaker because of that fact. She doesn&#x27;t want to join the revolution because she believes that it will lead to death, so she doesn&#x27;t. She uses her husband, Jaimito, as the reason she doesn&#x27;t officially join. He doesn&#x27;t want her involved in the revolution, and the conflict almost destroys their marriage. She is constantly worried about her sisters, telling them they&#x27;ll be killed. She has children, all boys, Enrique, Rafael, and David. In the end, she is the only survivor of her four sisters. 
María Teresa: The youngest of the four Mirabal sisters, she is very materialistic. She marries Leandro and has one daughter, named Jacqueline. She joined the revolution while she was living with her sister Minerva. She joined because she wanted to feel worthy of Leandro. She writes in a diary form in her chapters.
Patria: The oldest of the Mirabal sisters, she is very religious. While looking for her calling from God, she instead finds her husband, Pedrito, whom she marries at age 16. Her faith wavers intensely as a young woman. She takes the miscarriage of her third child as God&#x27;s punishment towards her, which drives her further into a religious depression. She later regains her faith on a pilgrimage to Higüey that she takes with her mother and sisters. She has three children: Nelson, Noris, and Raul Ernesto. She is also a revolutionary, starting a Christian revolutionary group and merging it with her sister Minerva&#x27;s revolutionary group. Also, her tone went from being a little confusing in the beginning and losing her relationship with her family to becoming more connected to her family.

Trujillo: Rafael Leonidas Trujillo, also known as &quot;El Jefe&quot; (&quot;the Chief&quot;), is the main antagonist of the novel. He is the self-appointed dictator of the Dominican Republic. A harsh ruler, he demands complete obedience from everyone and commits many cruel and unjust acts against his people, such as imprisonment without trial, confiscating land, possessions, and torture. Though married, he has many affairs with young girls who he keeps in houses around the country. He is also identified as a rapist. As his regime falls apart, he becomes even more vicious and cruel and eventually has the Mirabal sisters (all except for Dede) killed when they become too much of an opposition to his decaying power.
Mamá: Mother to the Mirabal girls, and married to Papa. She takes care of the girls and is always worried about them. Despite being the matriarch of a plantation with servants, she is described as illiterate.

Papá: Father to the Mirabal girls, and married to Mama. He heads the family store.

Pedrito González: A farmer. He married Patria Mirabal when she was 16, on February 24, 1947. He and his wife eventually join the revolution, along with their son, Nelson. He is later imprisoned, along with his brothers-in-law, Leandro and Manolo, for participating in the revolution. He and Patria have three children: Nelson, Noris, and Raulito.
Manolo: A law student when he first arrives in the novel, Manolo is Minerva&#x27;s husband. Manolo emerges as a leader of the revolution and is chosen as president of the June 14 movement.

Fela: A worker for the Mirabal family who claims to be a fortune teller. After the girls die, she claims to be possessed by them. Minou goes to Fela for a time to &quot;talk&quot; to her mother after her death. 
Minou: One of Minerva&#x27;s children, Minou was born around 1956. Like her mother, she is strong-willed and independent.
Don Manuel: Trujillo&#x27;s right-hand man. Manuel is very &quot;tall and dapper&quot; (page 110). He is a corrupt politician, like many of Trujillo&#x27;s cronies. Manuel does many of Trujillo&#x27;s odd jobs, such as delivering messages and threats for him.
Virgilio: Virgilio Morales, nicknamed &quot;Lio&quot;. He is a revolutionary, but unlike most, he is not underground. He speaks out publicly against the government, which is considered suicide. Lio was forced into hiding because of his actions against the government. He was very close to Minerva before he fled the country. He asked her to flee with him but Minerva did not get the letter in time because Dede burned his first letter and Minerva&#x27;s father hid the following letters from her.
Jaimito: Jaimito is Dede&#x27;s husband and cousin. Jaimito and Dede live on his farm after they are married. He is opposed to his wife&#x27;s family&#x27;s involvement in the revolution and forbids her to join. When he and Dede were first married he was kind, but over the years he and Dede drift apart. He cares deeply for his boys. 
Sinita: Minerva&#x27;s good friend, whom she met at Inmaculada Catholic School for Girls. She later goes to Santo Domingo and becomes a revolutionary, just like Minerva. All the men in Sinita&#x27;s&#x27; family were killed by Trujillo, the last when she was a young girl, anchoring her deep-seated hatred of Trujillo. 
Rufino de la Cruz: The Mirabals&#x27; driver whenever they rented a car to go over the mountains to visit their husbands in prison, he was very loyal to the &quot;butterflies&quot;, and they trusted him wholeheartedly. He has a wife and one child. He was murdered along with the Mirabal girls.

==Reception==
The book was nominated for the 1994 National Book Critics Circle Award.

The Port Washington School District in Port Washington, NY banned this book because it has a detailed diagram depicting how to construct a bomb. &quot;We believe that the purpose of education is to expose students to all areas of reality so that we can make our own judgments. Isn&#x27;t that why we are able to read &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; without committing suicide, or &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; without being violent? We should not ban a powerful piece of literature just because of a diagram.&quot; stated a &quot;New York Times&quot; opinion piece written by two Schreiber High School students where the book was banned.

&quot;In the Time of the Butterflies&quot; is a selection of The Big Read, the National Endowment for the Arts&#x27; community-wide reading program, and of &quot;Readers Round Table&quot;(Algonquin).

==Connection to historical events==
The idea behind &quot;In the Time of the Butterflies&quot; originated in the 1960s when author Julia Alvarez was in the Dominican Republic. The Mirabal sisters had been murdered just three months after her father got involved with the underground against Trujillo.

<doc id="675492" wikidata="Q33322" url="?curid=675492" title="Hmong–Mien languages">
<text>The Hmong–Mien languages (also known as Miao–Yao and rarely as Yangtzean) are a highly tonal language family of southern China and northern Southeast Asia. They are spoken in mountainous areas of southern China, including Guizhou, Hunan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Hubei provinces; the speakers of these languages are predominantly &quot;hill people&quot;, in contrast to the neighboring Han Chinese, who have settled the more fertile river valleys.

==Relationships==

Hmongic (Miao) and Mienic (Yao) are closely related, but clearly distinct. For internal classifications, see Hmongic languages and Mienic languages. The largest differences are due to divergent developments in their phonological systems. The Hmongic languages appear to have kept the large set of initial consonants featured in the protolanguage but greatly reduced the distinctions in the syllable finals, in particular losing all glides and stop codas. The Mienic languages, on the other hand, have largely preserved syllable finals but reduced the number of initial consonants.

Early linguistic classifications placed the Hmong–Mien languages in the Sino-Tibetan family, where they remain in many Chinese classifications. The current consensus among Western linguists is that they constitute a family of their own, the lexical and typological similarities among Hmong–Mien and Sinitic languages being attributed to contact-induced influence.

Paul K. Benedict, an American scholar, extended the Austric theory to include the Hmong–Mien languages. The hypothesis never received much acceptance for Hmong–Mien, however. Kosaka (2002) argued specifically for a Miao–Dai family.

== Homeland ==
The most likely homeland of the Hmong–Mien languages is in Southern China between the Yangtze and Mekong rivers, but speakers of these languages might have migrated from Central China either as part of the Han Chinese expansion or as a result of exile from an original homeland by Han Chinese. Migration of people speaking these languages from South China to Southeast Asia took place during the 17th century (1600–1700). Ancient DNA evidence suggests that the ancestors of the speakers of the Hmong–Mien languages were a population genetically distinct from that of the Tai–Kadai and Austronesian language source populations at a location on the Yangtze River. Recent Y-DNA phylogeny evidence supports the proposition that people who speak the Hmong–Mien languages are descended from a population that is distantly related to those who now speak the Mon-Khmer languages.

The date of Proto-Hmong–Mien has been estimated to be about 2500 BP (500 BC) by Sagart, Blench, and Sanchez-Mazas using traditional methods employing many lines of evidence, and about 4243 BP (2250 BC) by the Automated Similarity Judgment Program (ASJP), an experimental algorithm for automatic generation of phonologically based phylogenies.

==Names==
The Mandarin names for these languages are &quot;Miáo&quot; and &quot;Yáo&quot;.

In Vietnamese, the name for Hmong is &quot;H&#x27;Mông&quot;, and the name for Mien is &quot;Dao&quot; (i.e., Yao), although &quot;Miền&quot; is also used.

&quot;Meo&quot;, &quot;Hmu&quot;, &quot;Mong&quot;, &quot;Hmao&quot;, and &quot;Hmong&quot; are local names for Miao, but since most Laotian refugees in the United States call themselves &quot;Hmong/Mong&quot;, this name has become better known in English than the others in recent decades. However, except for some scholars who prefer the word, the term &#x27;Hmong/Mong&#x27; is only used within certain Hmong/Miao language speaking communities in China, where the majority of the Miao speakers live. In Mandarin, despite the fact that it was once a derogatory term, the word &quot;Miao&quot; (Chinese: 苗; the tone varies according to the Sinitic dialect) is now commonly used by members of all nationalities to refer to the language and the ethnolinguistic group.

The Mandarin name Yao, on the other hand, is for the Yao nationality, which is a multicultural rather than ethnolinguistic group. It includes peoples speaking Mien, Kra–Dai, Yi, and Miao languages, the latter called &quot;Bùnǔ&quot; rather than &quot;Miáo&quot; when spoken by Yao. For this reason, the ethnonym &quot;Mien&quot; may be preferred as less ambiguous.

==Characteristics==
Like many languages in southern China, the Hmong–Mien languages tend to be monosyllabic and syntactically analytic. They are some of the most highly tonal languages in the world: Longmo and Zongdi Hmong have as many as twelve distinct tones. They are notable phonologically for the occurrence of voiceless sonorants and uvular consonants; otherwise their phonology is quite typical of the region.

They are SVO in word order but are not as rigidly right-branching as the Tai–Kadai languages or most Mon–Khmer languages, since they have genitives and numerals before the noun like Chinese. They are extremely poor in adpositions: serial verb constructions replace most functions of adpositions in languages like English. For example, a construction translating as &quot;be near&quot; would be used where in English prepositions like &quot;in&quot; or &quot;at&quot; would be used.

Besides their tonality and lack of adpositions, another striking feature is the abundance of numeral classifiers and their use where other languages use definite articles or demonstratives to modify nouns.

==Mixed languages==
Various unclassified Sinitic languages are spoken by ethnic Miao and Yao. These languages have variously been proposed as having Hmong-Mien substrata or as mixed languages, including languages such as She Chinese, Laba, Lingling, Maojia, Badong Yao, various Lowland Yao languages including Yeheni, Shaozhou Tuhua, and various Pinghua dialects.

<text>George Elliott ( 1636 – 1668 in Tangier) was the English surgeon to the Earl of Teviot&#x27;s Regiment.

Elliott was the illegitimate son of Catherine Killigrew (1618–1689) and Richard Eliot ( 1614-1660s), the wayward second son of Sir John Eliot. George Elliott&#x27;s grandson Granville Elliott spent much effort in seeking to prove that Richard had married Catherine Killigrew, but he was never able to do so formally. Indeed, visitations survive showing that Richard died a bachelor and her mother&#x27;s probate documents showing that Catherine was a spinster, aged 38, on 24 December 1656.

Little is known of Elliott&#x27;s early years until his marriage to Katherine Maxwell in 1654. By 4 May 1663, around the time of the baptism of his second daughter in London, he was recognized as &#x27;Doctor&#x27; to the Earl of Teviot&#x27;s Regiment. He reappeared at the Tangier Garrison in Morocco in May 1664 as the &#x27;Chirurgeon to the Earl of Teviot&#x27;s Regiment at Tangier&#x27;, where he lived at the &quot;Mole&quot;, a waterside fortification.

==Family==
On 18 January 1654 at St Olave Silver Street, London, Elliott married Katherine Maxwell ( 1638 – December 1709), the daughter of the Rev. William Maxwell of Minnigaff (d. 1655). They had at least two daughters and one son:
#Katherine Elliott (bapt 14 December 1660 St Mary Somerset, London – unknown)
#Margaret Elliott (bapt 3 May 1663 St Benet&#x27;s, Paul&#x27;s Wharf, London – unknown), who married firstly (before 7 March 1714) Richard Andrews, and secondly (after 7 March 1714) Richard Giles
#Roger Elliott ( 1665 – 15 May 1714 Barnes, Surrey), who married Charlotte Elliot at St Peter upon Cornhill, London on 4 March 1712

In 1668, Elliott died at Tangier, where he was succeeded as Chirurgeon by his assistant, Robert Spotswood (17 September 1637 – 1680), who also married Elliott&#x27;s widow.

<text>WFLA (970 kHz) is a commercial AM radio station in Tampa, Florida, and serving the Tampa Bay media market. The station airs a news/talk format and is owned and operated by iHeartMedia, Inc. The station&#x27;s studios and offices are on Gandy Boulevard in South Tampa.

WFLA broadcasts by day at 25,000 watts, reducing power to 11,000 watts at night. (For most of its history, from the 1940s to the early 2000s, it ran at 5,000 watts.) It uses a directional antenna at all times. The main transmitter site is off Montague Street in Town &#x27;n&#x27; Country, Florida. Programming is also heard on two FM translators, 94.5 MHz in Gulfport and 99.1 in Bayonet Point.

==Programming==
Weekdays on WFLA begin with a local morning program, &quot;The Ryan Gorman Show&quot; with co-host Dana McKay. The rest of the schedule features mostly nationally syndicated Premiere Networks talk shows including &quot;The Glenn Beck Radio Program, The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, The Sean Hannity Show, The Jesse Kelly Show, Our American Stories with Lee Habeeb&quot; and &quot;Coast to Coast AM with George Noory&quot;.

Weekends feature shows on money, health, boating and fishing. Some weekend shows are paid brokered programming. On weekends, WFLA carries &quot;Sunday Nights with Bill Cunningham, Armstrong &amp; Getty, The Ben Ferguson Show&quot; and &quot;This Morning, America&#x27;s First News with Gordon Deal&quot;. WFLA occasionally serves as an overflow outlet for sports programming from co-owned sports radio station 620 WDAE.

WFLA provides local newscasts on both weekdays and weekends. Evening and overnight newscasts are pre-recorded. National and world news is provided by Fox News Radio. WFLA provides news coverage for other iHeartMedia stations in the Tampa Bay market, and is a hub for the Florida News Network.

===Other stations carrying the WFLA brand===
Another Clear Channel radio station in Tallahassee took the call sign WFLA-FM. Its sister station in the Orlando area, WFLF (AM), uses &quot;WFLA&quot; as its branding. Both WFLA-FM and WFLF carries many of the same nationally syndicated programming as WFLA, but all three stations have their own local shows and news.

WFLF-FM also previously carried the WFLA brand and programming in Panama City until September 2021; since then, the WFLA brand has been carried by two FM translators in the area.

==History==
In 1925, the station first signed on as WGHB in Clearwater. In 1927, its call sign changed to WFHH, and later that year to WFLA at 1130 kHz.

===WSUN jointly licensed with WFLA as WFLA-WSUN===

WSUN was first authorized in October 1927, joining WFLA at 590 kHz, with this station now assigned a dual call sign of WFLA-WSUN, under shared ownership by the Clearwater and St. Petersburg Chambers of Commerce. WSUN made its debut broadcast on November 1, using the slogan &quot;Why Stay Up North&quot;.

In 1927 WFLA-WSUN moved to 580 kHz, then to 900 kHz the next year. In 1929, radio frequencies for stations in Florida were reallocated, and WFLA-WSUN moved to 620 kHz.

The station&#x27;s transmitter site was originally on the north side of the Courtney Campbell Causeway near Clearwater.

===First directional antenna in the United States===

WFLA-WSUN&#x27;s move to 620 kHz resulted in a nighttime interference complaint from another station on that frequency, WTMJ in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. WFLA-WSUN was ordered to reduce powers from 1,000 watts night and 2,500 watts day to 250 watts night and 500 watts day.

Station manager Walter Tison began an investigation into whether there was a way that WFLA-WSUN could increase its nighttime power to a more acceptable level. Working with 
T. A. M. Craven, a British engineer, Raymond M. Wilmotte, was engaged in 1932 to construct a then-theoretical antenna system that would reduce the signal sent toward Milwaukee. The idea that a directional antenna would resolve the issue was somewhat controversial, with some doubters stating that fluctuations in the ionosphere would cause issues, while others believed that instead of going directly to Milwaukee, the WFLA-WSUN signal was actually travelling west through the Gulf of Mexico, then turning north through the Mississippi valley.

The directional antenna installation, the first in the United States, consisting of two 200 foot (61 m) towers, was successful. As an example of its effectiveness, engineer Wilmotte noted that at one point a telegram was sent from regulators in Washington asking why WFLA-WSUN was off the air, because an inspector located in Atlanta was not receiving the station when it employed the directional antenna.

===WFLA and WSUN switch to separate licenses===

WFLA and WSUN were affiliates of the NBC Red Network, carrying dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts during the &quot;Golden Age of Radio&quot;.

In 1937, the joint ownership of WFLA-WSUN was severed, with the two stations continuing to operate on 620 kHz using a common transmitter, but separately licensed on a time-sharing basis. WFLA was allocated full-time use of Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and shared hours on Sundays.

===WFLA becomes full-time station after frequency change===

In 1940, The Tribune Company was given permission to construct a full-time station on 940 kHz. Because this was technically a new station, this authorization was initially given the call sign of WKGA. However, the authorization included shutting down WFLA on 620 kHz, so when operations began on 940 kHz, the historic WFLA call sign was transferred to the new frequency. WFLA&#x27;s owner also owned &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot;. The studios and offices were in the Seminole Building. WSUN stayed on 620 kHz, licensed to St. Petersburg (now WDAE).

From 1945 to 1949, WFLA carried a southern gospel show, which featured legendary bass singer J. D. Sumner and The Sunny South Quartet. WFLA and WSUN were owned by the Clearwater and St. Petersburg Chambers of Congress.

An advertisement in the 1950 edition of &quot;Broadcasting Yearbook&quot; said that WFLA-AM-FM were the &quot;most listened to&quot; stations in &quot;the heart of Florida&#x27;s most heavily populated trade area&quot;.

===FM and TV===
WFLA added an FM station in 1948, WFLA-FM (now WFLZ). In its early years, WFLA-FM largely simulcast its AM sister station. In the mid-to-late 1960s, it switched from Top 40 to beautiful music. A television station also went on the air in 1955, WFLA-TV, which is now owned by the Nexstar Media Group. Because WFLA-AM-FM carried NBC programming, WFLA-TV also joined the NBC Television Network.
Once network programming had shifted from radio to television, WFLA began a full service middle of the road format of popular adult music, news, and sports. It later tried Top 40 and Adult Contemporary music. In the 1980s, listeners shifted to FM to hear music, so WFLA increased the news and talk programming. In 1982, WFLA hired street reporter Sam Cardinale from WPLP to make the move toward news-oriented programming. Cardinale won multiple AP and UPI awards for the station for news coverage before joining WTVT. In 1986, WFLA made the full transition to all-talk. It has been the market leader in this format ever since, and usually is among the top five stations in the market, according to Arbitron ratings.

===Changes in ownership===
Media General acquired the Tribune Company in the 1970s. This meant one company controlled, in Tampa, a newspaper, TV station, AM station and FM station. However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) were discouraging one owner from controlling so much media in one market. In the 1980s, federal regulations forced Media General to divest the radio stations because of its other holdings. The radio stations were sold to Blair Broadcasting in late 1982. Sconnix Communications of Charleston, South Carolina, bought WFLA and what was then WPDS from Blair Broadcasting in 1987. Blair was divesting all of its English-language broadcasting properties to concentrate on its Spanish-language TV network, Telemundo. Jacor Communications purchased WFLA from Sconnix in 1988. In 1989, the station moved from Jackson Street in downtown Tampa to its present location at 4002 W. Gandy Blvd., in south Tampa. Clear Channel Communications, purchased Jacor in 1999, which included WFLA and WFLZ. Clear Channel was the forerunner of today&#x27;s iHeartMedia.

==Past personalities==
WFLA gave national hosts Glenn Beck and Lionel their starts in talk radio. For many years, Todd Schnitt hosted the nationally syndicated &quot;Schnitt Show&quot; at WFLA. Other prominent alumni, from the days when the station concentrated on local programming, include Bob Lassiter, Jay Marvin, Dick Norman, Jack Ellery and Freddy Mertz. Other former hosts include Al Gardner, Mark Larsen, Daniel Ruth, Mark Beiro, Paul Gonzalez and Mel Berman.

Over the years, AM Tampa Bay has had three female co-hosts; Sharon Taylor, who was let go after ten years, Allyson Turner, who left less than a year after she was hired, and Corey Dylan, who was promoted to her own show at sister station WMTX after four years on WFLA. Longtime news anchors and reporters Steve Hall and Sharon Parker were released in a 2019 iHeart round of layoffs. In March 2023, longtime AM Tampa Bay host Jack Harris was released from the station. Harris had been with WFLA off and on since 1970.

<text>Winterfresh is a wintergreen flavored variety of chewing gum made by the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company. Introduced in the United States in 1994 as an alternative to their Big Red brand (for the winter season market), it has had two packaging designs . Extra gum, a sugarless gum, introduced a Winterfresh flavor in 1988, while Freedent introduced a Winterfresh flavor around the same time the Winterfresh brand gum was introduced.

Each three-gram stick contains 10 calories (42 kilojoules).

== Cool Breath Power commercials ==
From 2006 to 2008, Winterfresh aired a series commercials called &quot;Cool Breath Power&quot;, as most of them were &quot;Attraction Chronicles&quot;. These commercials were targeted at the teen demographic, and typically featured a narrator giving bizarre love advice in a bizarre world. Its director, illustrator, and animator was Karl Ackermann and Newgrounds animator LoveMaestro21, done in an old style of Macromedia Flash by Milky Elephant, with some people believing that the animation is very similar to early seasons of &quot;South Park&quot;. 

Its creative directors were Bobby Pawar, Miles Turpin, and Sean Donohue, who also is the art director of the commercials.

<doc id="675522" wikidata="Q1347396" url="?curid=675522" title="Nils Dacke">
<text>Nils Dacke (died 1543) was a Swedish yeoman who was the leader of a mid-16th century peasant revolt in the historic province of Småland in southern Sweden. The resulting Dacke War () was fought against King Gustav I of Sweden of the Vasa family. It was the most widespread and serious civil war in Swedish history and almost toppled the king.

==Background==
King Gustav Vasa had come to power at the head of a peasant army in 1523. He had led Sweden out of the Danish-dominated Kalmar Union and made Protestantism the national religion. Småland found itself on the border between Sweden and Denmark and was hit hard by Vasa&#x27;s ban on cross-border trade. In addition, the heavy handed way in which the church was reformed and the increasing tax burden led to much dissatisfaction among the poor peasants.

==The Dacke War==

Already in 1536, Nils Dacke was tried at a local court for killing a sheriff; according to court records he was fined 10 oxen.
The uprising started in Södra Möre during June 1542 with the assassination of more sheriffs and tax collectors. Gustav Vasa underestimated the military prowess of the peasants and sent his German mercenaries (&quot;Landsknecht&quot;) to quell the revolt. The landsknechts were, however, unsuited for battle in the rugged forests and suffered heavy losses. Dacke had devised defensive tactics that allowed the peasants to use their steel crossbows with devastating effect. Dacke&#x27;s successes helped spread the revolt over all the southern provinces of Sweden. The situation was so serious that the king was forced to sue for peace, and a one-year ceasefire was signed on 8 November. During the ceasefire, Dacke was the de facto ruler of most of southern Sweden and received offers of foreign support from the Elector Palatine Frederick II (1482–1556), who was the son-in-law of King Christian II of Denmark, and Albrecht VII, Duke of Mecklenburg (1486–1547). He reinstated the ceremonies of the Roman Catholic Church and reopened the cross-border trade in the areas under his control. With Danish support, Gustav Vasa mounted an invasion of Mecklenburg which neutralised the German threat.

In the autumn of 1542, the king had to agree to a truce with Dacke. The king broke the ceasefire in January 1543 and sent a new and larger army into the rebellious area. His forces moved in from Östergötland and Västergötland. Royal propaganda had been spread to win over the population and turn them against Dacke. Dacke himself had become overconfident after earlier successes and met the Swedish Royal Army in a pitched battle in March. The trained soldiers fighting on their own terms shattered the peasant army, and Dacke was severely injured. After this defeat, the rebellion was effectively over and Dacke became an outlaw.

==Death==

Dacke was shot during the summer of 1543 in the forests of the parish of Virserum. According to contemporary sources, he had been injured in both legs by hits from the king&#x27;s crossbows during the decisive battle a few months earlier, his forces had been routed, and he was likely trying to escape from the king&#x27;s mercenaries. Dacke eventually fell in August 1543 at a farm in the parish of Gullabo in Södra Möre.

Dacke was executed posthumously, quartered, and his limbs were sent for public display in larger communities that had supported him during the rebellion. Gustav Vasa ordered the annihilation of Dacke&#x27;s entire family, but showed some leniency against those who had given themselves up. Dacke&#x27;s wife, brother-in-law and other relatives were executed. His son was taken to prison in Stockholm where he either starved to death or died from the plague. Thus, the unity of the realm was restored.

As a result of the war, the king was henceforth more careful when dealing with his subjects. The reliance on foreign mercenaries in the army was reduced in favour of soldiers of Swedish extraction (many of which were recruited in Småland), and this laid the foundation for Sweden&#x27;s military successes in later wars.

==Legacy==
Nils Dacke is commonly perceived as a Småland freedom hero. His name is often linked to an independent streak in Småland. Statues in memory of him have been erected, including one in Virserum, where the final battle allegedly took place during 1543. The () is a local political party in the township of Gnosjö.

&quot;&quot; is a vessel, owned by TT-Line serving the Trelleborg-Świnoujście route.

&quot;Dacke&quot;, a made-for-television film, was released in 1961 by Swedish director and screenwriter .

The asteroid 7217 Dacke is named after him.

<text>The Battle of Quatre Bras was fought on 16 June 1815, as a preliminary engagement to the decisive Battle of Waterloo that occurred two days later. The battle took place near the strategic crossroads of Quatre Bras and was contested between elements of the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-allied army and the left wing of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s French &quot;Armée du Nord&quot; under Marshal Michel Ney. The battle was a tactical victory for Wellington (as he possessed the field at dusk), but because Ney prevented him going to the aid of Blucher&#x27;s Prussians who were fighting a larger French army under the command of Napoleon Bonaparte at Ligny it was a strategic victory for the French.

== Prelude ==

Facing two armies (Wellington&#x27;s arriving from the west and the Prussians under Field Marshall von Blücher from the east), Napoleon&#x27;s overall strategy was to defeat each in turn, before these forces could join. Napoleon intended to cross the border into what is now Belgium (but was then part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands) without alerting the Coalition leaders and drive a wedge between their forces. He planned to defeat the Prussian army, forcing them to retreat eastward, and then turn to engage Wellington, driving his army back to the Channel coast.

Napoleon recognized that, if Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-allied army could join with the Prussians, the combined force would be larger than his French army. The crossroads at Quatre Bras therefore became a strategic position, since if the French held this interchange, they could prevent Wellington&#x27;s forces from moving south-eastward along the Nivelles-Namur road towards the Prussians, where Napoleon was planning to engage von Blücher on 16 June at Ligny.

Although the Coalition commanders were receiving intelligence, Napoleon&#x27;s planning was initially successful. Wellington remarked: &quot;Napoleon has humbugged me, by God; he has gained twenty-four hours&#x27; march on me.&quot;

While Wellington&#x27;s instructions at the start of the campaign were to defend Brussels from the French, he was not sure what route Napoleon&#x27;s army would follow; he also received (false) reports of a flanking maneuver through Mons to the southwest. Wellington first received reports of the outbreak of hostilities at around 15:00 on 15 June from the Prince of Orange, a Coalition commander. Within the next few hours, he received additional news that the French had skirmished early that morning with the Prussian First Corps under Lieutenant-General Graf von Zieten at Thuin (near Charleroi). These reports prompted Wellington at 18:00 to draft initial orders to concentrate his army. However, he was still uncertain precisely where to bring his forces together, and it was not until almost midnight, when he learned that the front near Mons was clear, that he ordered his army to move towards the Prussians.

This nine-hour delay meant it was too late for him to move his army in sufficient strength to provide von Blücher with support on 16 June at the Battle of Ligny. Wellington did not order his entire army to Quatre Bras on 16 June, still suspecting a flanking maneuver through Mons. The headquarters of the Anglo-allied First Corps (Prince of Orange&#x27;s), however, decided to ignore Wellington&#x27;s order that it should assemble in and around Nivelles, instead opting to take the initiative and converge on Quatre Bras.

Napoleon&#x27;s original plan for 16 June was based on the assumption that the Coalition forces, which had been caught off guard, would not attempt a risky forward concentration; he intended therefore to push an advanced guard as far as Gembloux, for the purpose of feeling for and warding off von Blücher. To assist in this operation, the reserve would move first to Fleurus to reinforce Marshal Grouchy who was tasked with driving back the Prussian troops. However, once the French were in possession of Sombreffe, Napoleon planned to swing the reserve westwards to join with Marshal Ney, who—it was supposed—would have by that time secured the Quatre Bras crossroad.

Accordingly Marshal Ney, to whom III Cavalry Corps (Kellermann) was now attached, was to mass at Quatre Bras and push an advance guard northward of that place, sending a connecting division at Marbais to link him with Grouchy. The center and left wing together would then make a night-march toward Brussels. The Coalition forces would thus be forcefully separated, and all that remained would be to destroy each in detail. Napoleon now awaited further information from his wing commanders at Charleroi, where he massed the VI Corps (Lobau&#x27;s), to save it, if possible, from a harassing countermarch, as it appeared likely that it would only be needed for the march to Brussels.

On 15 June as the Prussian I Corps withdrew towards Ligny, there was a danger for the Coalition forces that Ney would be able to advance through Quatre Bras and take his objectives with little or no Coalition opposition. At the headquarters of the I Corps at Genappe (about five kilometres (3 miles) from Quatre Bras), Major-General Jean Victor de Constant Rebecque, chief of staff to the Prince of Orange, realized the danger and ordered Lieutenant-General Hendrik George de Perponcher Sedlnitsky, the commander of the 2nd Dutch Division, to dispatch his 2nd Brigade (Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach) to occupy Quatre Bras. This brigade, consisting of two regiments from Nassau, arrived at about 14:00 on 15 June. Prince Bernhard was able to deploy prior to the arrival of the first French scouts, lancers of the Guard Light Cavalry Division (Lefebvre-Desnouettes) who approached Quatre Bras. These French lancers were engaged at Frasnes, after which the Nassauers retreated to the Bois de Bossu, a thick patch of forest near Quatre Bras. &quot;6:30 p.m. – some accounts say 5:30&quot; General Lefebvre-Desnouëtte requested infantry support, but as night was approaching, and his infantry was strung out along Brussels-Charleroi road, Ney declined the request, instead deciding to camp for the night and approach Quatre Bras in force the following day. Early on the evening of 15 June, instead of obeying Wellington&#x27;s order to concentrate the I Corps at Nivelles (which would have meant that the force occupying Quatre Bras would be abandoning the position), Rebecque ordered the 1st Brigade (Van Bylandt&#x27;s brigade) of the 2nd Dutch Division to reinforce Prince Bernhard&#x27;s 2nd Brigade.

By countermanding a direct order from Wellington and using his own initiative, Rebecque was responsible for the Battle being fought at Quatre Bras on the following day, thereby preventing the French from keeping the two coalition armies apart and destroying each of them in detail.

Ney spent the morning of 16 June massing his I and II corps, and reconnoitering the enemy at Quatre Bras, who, he was informed, had been reinforced. But up till noon he took no serious steps to capture the crossroads, which he could have done with relative ease. In the meantime, Grouchy reported from Fleurus that Prussians were coming up from Namur, but Napoleon does not appear to have attached much importance to this report. He was still at Charleroi when, between 09:00 and 10:00, further news reached him that hostile forces had concentrated at Quatre Bras. He at once wrote to Ney saying that these could only be some of Wellington&#x27;s troops, and that Ney was to concentrate his force and crush what was in front of him, adding that Ney was to send all reports to Fleurus. Then, leaving Marshal Lobau&#x27;s force provisionally at Charleroi, Napoleon hastened to Fleurus, arriving about 11:00.

===Meeting at the Windmill of Bussy===
Shortly after 11:00, Wellington observed that the French were not in any great force at Frasnes (south of Quatre Bras). At the same time, accounts reached him that the Prussians, in position at Ligny, were being menaced by the advance of a considerable French force. Wellington, accompanied by his staff and a small escort of cavalry, rode off to hold a conference with von Blücher, whom he met at the Windmill of Bussy (often referred to as the Windmill of Brye) between Ligny and Brye. Because this windmill was at the highest point of the Prussian position, the leaders were able to observe the French preparatory deployments prior to their attack.

These observations led Wellington to conclude that Napoleon was bringing the main force of his army to bear against the Prussians; he at once proposed to assist von Blücher by first advancing straight upon Frasnes and Gosselies, as soon as he was able to concentrate sufficient force, and then attacking the French from their left and rear, thus providing a powerful diversion to aid the Prussians, since von Blücher&#x27;s right wing was the weakest and most exposed, and considering Napoleon&#x27;s movements was the most likely to be attacked.

The primary sources do not agree on what was said at the meeting. They all agree that Wellington promised aid to Blücher, but they disagree on whether Wellington made an unequivocal promise of aid, or whether Wellington made it clear that his ability to give timely assistance to Blücher was only possible if his forces were not engaged before he could send aid.

Siborne, writing from eyewitness accounts, records it thus:
==Combatants==

At the beginning of the battle the left wing of the &quot;Armée du Nord&quot;, with 18,000 men (including 2,000 cavalry and 32 guns) under Marshal Michel Ney, faced 8,000 infantry and 16 guns, under the command of William, Prince of Orange. The Dutch (with the Nassauers of 2nd Brigade) were thinly deployed south of the crossroads of Quatre Bras. Fresh allied troops started to arrive two hours later, along with Wellington, who took over command of the allied forces. As the day wore on, fresh Dutch, British and Brunswickers arrived faster than fresh French troops (who eventually numbered about 24,000).

==Battle==

Fighting started late in the afternoon on 15 June, when the Elba squadron, a small Polish lancer unit consisting of only 109 men and officers, tried to attack the allied forces from the direction of Frasnes. These forces consisted of the II/2nd Nassau regiment and Bijlevelds horse artillery. The Dutch and Nassau commanders had taken precautions, however, and the Lancers were greeted by canister and volley fire, losing some men and horses before retiring to Frasnes. Patrols were sent out and the positions were kept until the next morning.

From 5 AM on 16 June there were continuous skirmishes between Allied and French forces, in which neither side managed to get an advantage. Some Prussian hussars, cut off from their main body, skirmished with the Red Lancers, but they disengaged after Bijleveld&#x27;s artillery once again drove the lancers back. Two companies of Nassau infantry advanced towards Frasnes, but this time the French pushed them back. Some time after 6 a.m., after the Prince of Orange arrived, the skirmishes stopped.
The real battle began with the French attack around 14:00 hours. Ney massed a battery of 22 guns and started bombarding the Coalition positions. Swarms of skirmishers preceded the French columns as they attacked. The Dutch picket line of the 2nd Division (Sedlnitsky) greeted them with musket volleys, but it was outnumbered and those east of the Brussels highway were at once forced back by the mass of men moved against them. The Nassauers of 2nd Brigade (Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar) retreated to Grand-Pierrepont farm and Dutch troops of the 1st Brigade (Bylandt) to Gemioncourt, but the allies managed, however, to hold the wood. Facing three infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade, the situation became desperate for the 2nd Division.
At around 15:00 the 5th British Infantry Division (Picton) and the 3rd Dutch Light Cavalry Brigade (Baron van Merlen) arrived. The Duke of Wellington came back from his meeting with Blücher and took command. He deployed Picton&#x27;s Division on the allied left flank where it stopped the French advance to the east of the road. The fresh French 6th Division (Prince Jérôme Bonaparte) arrived on the scene. A fierce fight now broke out all along the line. Picton, showing a dauntless front, maintained his position, while the French 6th Division were sent against Grand-Pierrepont. The Nassauers were forced to abandon the farm and were driven into the Bossu wood. There they fought from tree to tree, slowing the French advance. At Gemioncourt the Dutch troops were a thorn in the side of the French.
The defending battalion of Gemincourt Farm, the 5th National Militia, lost 62% of its original strength that day. It was driven out by the 4th light and 100th Line regiments, but regrouped north of the farm when the Dutchmen saw the 28th British Foot come to their aid. But this regiment thought the farmhouse was lost and retreated, while the 5th Militia, thinking they were going to get reinforced, charged the Farmhouse again and drove the French regiments from the surroundings of the farm, but were unable to take the farm itself. The 5th managed to take up position south of the farm, where their Prince joined them. With artillery support, they repulsed the 6th Chasseurs-Au-Cheval and a lancer regiment. The Dutch lost and retook the farm another time, but eventually lost it.

By 15:00, the French formed a line between Pierrepont through Gemioncourt to Piraumont. At 15:30 the Dutch 2nd Light Cavalry Brigade (van Merlen), led by the Prince of Orange, charged the French line; although they were met by French cavalry and were thrown back, this gave the battered Dutch infantry time to regroup. When the Dutch cavalry brigade disengaged and retired to friendly lines they were shot at by Scottish infantry because their uniforms looked like the French uniforms of the chasseurs à cheval. The Brunswick Corps, under the Duke of Brunswick, now reached the field, but their commander received a mortal wound while leading a charge and the attack failed. At 16:15 Ney received Napoleon&#x27;s order (despatched at 14:00), to attack vigorously. He sent an order to his II Corps (Honoré Reille) to attack with more force.

On Ney&#x27;s left, Prince Jérôme drove the allies out of the Bossu Wood. French mixed forces advanced almost all the way to the crossroads. Regiments of the British 9th Brigade (Pack) – 42nd (&quot;Black Watch&quot;, Macara), 44th (&quot;East Essex&quot;, Hamerton) and 92nd (&quot;Gordon Highlanders&quot;, John Cameron) – held up against the infantry. French of the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Cavalry Division (Piré) counter-attacked and severely mauled the 42nd and 44th before they were driven off.

At 17:00 the timely arrival of the British 3rd Division (Alten), coming in from Nivelles, tipped the numerical balance back in favour of the allies. At quarter past the hour Ney heard that the French I Corps (d&#x27;Erlon), without his direct order or knowledge, had moved eastwards to assist in the battle of Ligny. Fifteen minutes later at 17:30 he received an unclear order from Napoleon to seize Quatre Bras and then turn eastwards to crush Blücher, who was caught at Ligny. Due to the arrival of allied reinforcements, Ney realized that he could capture and hold Quatre Bras only with the support of the I Corps and he sent imperative orders to d&#x27;Erlon to return at once. To keep the pressure on Wellington, immediately after sending for d&#x27;Erlon, Ney ordered Kellermann to lead his one available cuirassier brigade and break through Wellington&#x27;s line.

Kellermann&#x27;s cuirassiers caught the British 5th Brigade (Halkett) – 33rd (&quot;West Riding&quot;, Lieutenant-Colonel William George Keith Elphinstone) 69th (&quot;South Lincolnshire&quot;, Morice) and the 73rd (Harris) – in line formation. The 69th were badly mauled, losing their King&#x27;s colour (the only battalion under Wellington&#x27;s direct command to do so); the 33rd and the 73rd were saved from a similar fate by running for the safety of Bossu Wood where they rallied quickly. The cuirassiers reached the crossroads but were driven back by close range artillery and musket fire.

The arrival of the British 1st Infantry Division (Guards Division, Cooke) gave Wellington sufficient strength to counter-attack and Jérôme, whose skirmishers were now west of Quatre Bras, was forced to retreat and give up possession of Bossu wood to the British Guards. When the Guards and other allied units emerged from the wood, they were met with heavy fire from French infantry and an attack by 6th Lancer Regiment (and possibly the 1st Chasseurs) of the 2nd Cavalry Division (Piré); the Guards were caught in line and forced to flee back into the wood. This cavalry attack and taking the Bossu wood caused high casualties among the British Guards. There was some further skirmishing between allied light companies and the French &quot;voltigeurs&quot; and cavalry screen, but the battle was over. By 21:00, when the fighting stopped, the French had been forced to give up all of their territorial gains.

==Aftermath==
The battle cost Ney 4,000 men to Wellington&#x27;s 4,800. Although the allies had won the field, the French prevented them from coming to the aid of the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny. Wellington&#x27;s Anglo-allied army, upon learning of the Prussian defeat, was forced to retreat north along the Brussels road further away from the Prussians, who retreated north-east towards Wavre. There has been much debate about what would have happened if d&#x27;Erlon&#x27;s I Corps had engaged at either Ligny or Quatre Bras. As he did not, Napoleon chose to follow Wellington with the bulk of his forces and two days later met him at Waterloo.

The allied victory at Quatre Bras did prevent Ney from controlling these strategic crossroads. This in turn slowed down the French advance, thereby allowing Wellington to take a position on the Waterloo battlegrounds, which would otherwise not be possible and would have led, as some believe, to an allied defeat.

After the Waterloo campaign, Wellington was given the title Prince of Waterloo by the Dutch King William I. Along with the title came lands, which encompassed a large area of the battlefield of Quatre Bras. As landowner, the Duke and his successors had a large part of the Bossu wood felled for timber.

<text>Benjamin Robbins Curtis (November 4, 1809 – September 15, 1874) was an American lawyer and judge who served as an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court from 1851 to 1857. Curtis was the first and only Whig justice of the Supreme Court, and he was the first Supreme Court justice to have a formal law degree. He is often remembered as one of the two dissenters in the Supreme Court&#x27;s infamous 1857 decision &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot;.

Curtis resigned from the Supreme Court in 1857 to return to private legal practice in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1868, Curtis was President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s defense lawyer during Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial.

==Early life and education==
Curtis was born November 4, 1809, in Watertown, Massachusetts, the son of Lois Robbins and Benjamin Curtis, the captain of a merchant vessel. Young Curtis attended common school in Newton and beginning in 1825 Harvard College, where he won an essay writing contest in his junior year. At Harvard, he became a member of the Porcellian Club. He graduated in 1829, and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated from Harvard Law School in 1832.

==First private practice==

Admitted to the Massachusetts bar later that year, Curtis began his legal career. In 1834, he moved to Boston and joined the law firm of Charles P. Curtis, where he developed expertise in admiralty law and also became known for his familiarity with patent law.

In 1836, Curtis participated in the Massachusetts &quot;freedom suit&quot; of &quot;Commonwealth v. Aves&quot; as one of the attorneys who unsuccessfully defended a slaveholding father. When New Orleans resident Mary Slater went to Boston to visit her father, Thomas Aves, she brought with her a young slave girl about six years of age, named Med. While Slater fell ill in Boston, she asked her father to take care of Med until she (Slater) recovered. The Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society and others sought a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; against Aves, contending that Med became free by virtue of her mistress&#x27;s having brought her voluntarily into Massachusetts. Aves responded to the writ, answering that Med was his daughter&#x27;s slave, and that he was holding Med as his daughter&#x27;s agent.

The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, through its Chief Justice, Lemuel Shaw, ruled that Med was free, and made her a ward of the court. The Massachusetts decision was considered revolutionary at the time. Previous decisions elsewhere had ruled that slaves voluntarily brought into a free state, and who resided there many years, became free. &quot;Commonwealth v. Aves&quot; was the first decision to hold that a slave voluntarily brought into a free state became free the moment he or she arrived. The decision in this freedom suit proved especially controversial in slaveholding southern states. As with his fellow Massachusettsan and Harvard graduate John Adams, Curtis&#x27;s willingness to serve as defense attorney for the Aves family did not necessarily reflect his personal or legal views, as shown by his later dissent in the 1857 Dred Scott decision.

Curtis became a member of the Harvard Corporation, one of the two governing boards of Harvard University, in February 1846. In 1849, he was elected to the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Appointed chairman of a committee to reform state judicial procedures, they presented the Massachusetts Practice Act of 1851. &quot;It was considered a model of judicial reform and was approved by the legislature without amendment.&quot;

At the time, Curtis was viewed as a rival to Rufus Choate and was thought to be the preeminent leader of the New England bar. Curtis came from a politically connected family, and had studied under Joseph Story and John Hooker Ashmun at Harvard Law School. His legal arguments were thought to be well-reasoned and persuasive. Curtis was a Whig and in tune with their politics, and Whigs were in power. As a potential young appointee, he was thought to be the seed of a long and productive judicial career. He was appointed by the president, approved by the Senate, elevated to the Supreme Court bench, but was gone in six years.

==Supreme Court service==

Curtis received a recess appointment to the United States Supreme Court on September 22, 1851, by President Millard Fillmore, filling the vacancy caused by the death of Levi Woodbury. Massachusetts Senator Daniel Webster persuaded Fillmore to nominate Curtis to the Supreme Court, and was his primary sponsor. Formally nominated on December 11, 1851, Curtis was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 20, 1851, and received his commission the same day. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1854.

He was the first Supreme Court Justice to have earned a law degree from a law school. His predecessors had either &quot;read law&quot; (a form of apprenticeship in a practicing firm) or attended a law school without receiving a degree.

His opinion in &quot;Cooley v. Board of Wardens&quot; 53 U.S. 299 (1852) held that the Commerce Power as provided in the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, extends to laws related to pilotage. State laws related to commerce powers can be valid so long as Congress is silent on the matter. That resolved a historic controversy over federal interstate commerce powers. To this day, it is an important precedent in Commerce Clause cases. The issue was whether states can regulate aspects of commerce or whether that power is exclusive to Congress. Curtis concluded that the federal government has exclusive power to regulate commerce only when national uniformity is required. Otherwise, states may regulate commerce.

Curtis was one of the two dissenters in the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; case, in which he disagreed with essentially every holding of the court. He argued against the majority&#x27;s denial of the bid for emancipation by the slave Dred Scott. Curtis stated that, because there were black citizens in both Southern and Northern states at the time of the drafting of the federal Constitution, black people thus were clearly among the &quot;people of the United States&quot; contemplated thereunder. Curtis also opined that because the majority had found that Scott lacked standing, the Court could not go further and rule on the merits of Scott&#x27;s case.

Curtis resigned from the court on September 30, 1857, in part because he was exasperated with the fraught atmosphere in the court engendered by the case. As one source puts it, &quot;a bitter disagreement and coercion by Roger Taney prompted Benjamin Curtis&#x27;s departure from the Court in 1857.&quot; However, others view the cause of his resignation as having been both temperamental and financial. He did not like &quot;riding the circuit,&quot; as Supreme Court Justices were then required to do. He was temperamentally estranged from the court and was not inclined to work with others. The acrimony over the &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision had blossomed into mutual distrust. He did not want to live on $6,500 per year, much less than his earnings in private practice.

==Return to private practice==
Upon his resignation, Curtis returned to his Boston law practice, becoming a &quot;leading lawyer&quot; in the nation. During the ensuing decade and a half, he argued several cases before the Supreme Court. Although Curtis initially supported Abraham Lincoln as president, by 1863 he was criticizing Lincoln’s &quot;utter incompetence&quot; and publicly argued that the Emancipation Proclamation was unconstitutional. This put Curtis out of the running when Lincoln had to choose a successor to Chief Justice Roger Taney, who died in October 1864. In the presidential campaign of that year, Curtis supported Democrat George B. McClellan against Lincoln.

In 1868, Curtis acted as defense counsel for President Andrew Johnson during Johnson&#x27;s impeachment trial. He read the answer to the articles of impeachment, which was &quot;largely his work&quot;. His opening statement lasted two days, and was commended for legal prescience and clarity. He successfully persuaded the Senate that an impeachment was a judicial act, not a political act, so that it required a full hearing of evidence. This precedent &quot;influenced every subsequent impeachment&quot;.

After the impeachment trial, Curtis declined President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s offer of the position of U.S. Attorney General. A highly recommended candidate for the Chief Justice position upon the death of Salmon P. Chase in 1873, Curtis was passed over by President Ulysses S. Grant. He was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for U.S. senator from Massachusetts in 1874. From his judicial retirement in 1857 to his death in 1874, his aggregate professional income was about $650,000.
==Personal life==
Curtis had 12 children and was married three times.

==Death and legacy==
Curtis died in Newport, Rhode Island, on September 15, 1874. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery, 580 Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. On October 23, 1874, Attorney General George Henry Williams presented in the Supreme Court the resolutions submitted by the bar on Curtis&#x27;s death and shared observations on Judge Curtis&#x27;s defense of President Andrew Johnson in the articles of impeachment against him.

Curtis&#x27;s daughter, Annie Wroe Scollay Curtis, married (on December 9, 1880) future Columbia University President and New York Mayor Seth Low. They had no children.

The magazine was founded in 1984 by Eric Utne as the &quot;Utne Reader&quot;. Its tagline was &quot;the best of the alternative press&quot;. For its first 20 years Jay Walljasper was editor; Julie Ristau was its publisher. During these years it was transformed &quot;from a tiny New Age newsletter to a thick, ad-rich magazine with more than 300,000 subscribers.&quot; Utne chaired the magazine until the late 1990s, when his then-wife Nina Rothschild Utne took over. The magazine was headquartered in Minneapolis.

The cover logo was changed to simply &quot;Utne&quot; in 2003, continuing until 2006, with the subtitle, &quot;A Different Read on Life&quot;.

In 2006 the magazine was purchased by Ogden Publications, publishers of &quot;Grit&quot;, &quot;Mother Earth News&quot;, &quot;Natural Home&quot;, and other magazines. The earlier title &quot;Utne Reader&quot; was brought back, and the magazine returned to and refocused on its original mission to reprint &quot;the best of the alternative press&quot;.

&quot;Utne Reader&quot; ceased physical publication in 2019 and is now a digital digest at utne.com. Eric Utne looked into re-acquiring the magazine in 2020 but was rebuffed by the publisher. &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s sad to see it go&#x27;, Utne said. &#x27;These times need something like this more than ever. Our editorial credo was to no particular point of view. No one has the sole proprietorship on good ideas. It takes multiple perspectives to come closer to the truth.&#x27;&quot;

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Utne Reader&quot; was a leader of the salon movement of the 1980s, devoted to debate on the issues of the day. &quot;Utne Reader&quot; was an early source of coverage of the mythopoetic men&#x27;s movement when it first surfaced in the early 1990s.

==Utne Independent Press Awards==
The magazine bestows annual Utne Independent Press Awards, which honor alternative and independent magazines from around the world. Past winners include the &quot;Wilson Quarterly&quot;, &quot;In These Times&quot;, &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;High Country News&quot;, &quot;Gnosis&quot; and &quot;New Internationalist&quot;.

==In popular culture==
*In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;King-Size Homer&quot;, Lisa Simpson receives a letter for a subscription to the &quot;Utne Reader&quot;. A later episode, &quot;Dad Behavior&quot;, again references Lisa&#x27;s collection of the magazines.
*In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;The Son Also Draws&quot;, Brian Griffin is seen reading the magazine.
*In &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; episode &quot;Zombie Nightmare&quot;, Tom Servo makes a reference to the magazine&#x27;s staff during a rather tame and well-dressed disco scene. 
*In the webcomic &quot;Narbonic&quot;, in one of the first few strips in the series, the lab&#x27;s intern is shown reading the magazine. Later in the comic series, another character makes a reference to the magazine.
*In the second chapter of the novel &quot;House of Leaves&quot;, the footnotes contain a reference to a fictitious 1993 article from &quot;Utne Reader&quot; authored by &quot;David Liddel&quot; (also fictitious).

<text>Peter Henry Salus is a linguist, computer scientist, historian of technology, author in many fields, and an editor of books and journals. He has conducted research in germanistics, language acquisition, and computer languages.

==Education and career==
Salus has a 1963 PhD in linguistics from New York University. His dissertation was &quot;The Compound Noun in Indo-European: A Survey&quot;.

After serving as professor and dean at University of North Florida, University of Toronto, University of Massachusetts where in 1967 he was involved in the founding of the Department of Linguistics, and Queens College, City University of New York, he is now largely retired.

He has also been executive director of both the USENIX Association and the Sun User Group, and Vice President of the Free Software Foundation. He was one of the organizers of the 1996 conference on Freely Redistributable Software in Cambridge. In addition, he has worked for several high tech startups. From 1987 to 1996, he was Managing Editor of the technical journal &quot;Computing Systems&quot; (MIT Press and the USENIX Association).

==Contributions==
In 1966, Salus worked with W. H. Auden on a translation of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. During his work he discovered that the &quot;Airman&#x27;s Alphabet&quot; in Auden&#x27;s work was derived from the Eddic poems or more likely the translation by Bruce Dickins. In December 1965 Salus attended a meeting of the Tolkien Society in New York. Auden and Salus&#x27; comments and intentions to write a book on J. R. R. Tolkien were reported by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. However, Tolkien disapproved of a book on himself and was critical of Auden&#x27;s reported remarks on his house and Salus&#x27; observations on the shape of Middle-earth.

He is best known for his books on the history of computing, particularly &quot;A Quarter Century of UNIX&quot; and &quot;Casting The Net&quot; (a history of the Internet up to 1995).

<text>Henri Nannen (25 December 1913 in Emden – 13 October 1996 in Hanover) was a German journalist and art collector. He became one of the most prominent journalists and magazine publishers in Germany.

His father was a police officer in Emden who was removed from his post by the NSDAP. After a one-year book dealer apprenticeship he studied the history of art at the University of Munich. In the 1930s he started working as a journalist. During the war he served in SS-Standarte Kurt Eggers, a propaganda unit in Italy. Being large, well-built and fair haired, he corresponded to the racial ideals of the time in Germany. This made him the speaker of the Olympic Oath during the 1936 event in Berlin – for Riefenstahl&#x27;s film, but not in reality. Many years after the war, he confessed that &quot;I knew what was happening ... but I was too cowardly to do something against it.&quot; He got back to journalism while working for the &quot;Hannoverschen Neusten Nachrichten&quot;, the daily newspaper &quot;Abendpost&quot; and the youth newspaper &quot;Zickzack&quot;.

He was the founder of Gruner + Jahr publishing house and the news magazine &quot;Der Stern&quot;. He led the magazine from 1948 to 1980 to become one of the strongest in Europe. Gruner + Jahr is the largest publisher in Europe as of 2014.

Nannen gained popularity as an art collector and benefactor of the in Emden, an art museum, that he built in 1983. The annual Henri Nannen Prizes are awarded in his honor by Gruner + Jahr. The Henri-Nannen-Schule (formerly ), is the journalist school of Gruner + Jahr and is considered one of the best schools of journalism in Germany, along with the German School of Journalism () in Munich.

He was married to Eske Nannen (born 1942), a former actress. Henri Nannen has a son Christian Nannen (born 1946), co-owner of Hamburg suitcase-producer Travelite.
