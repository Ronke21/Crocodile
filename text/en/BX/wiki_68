==Early life and education==
Nicholas Sparks was born on December 31, 1965, in Omaha, Nebraska. His father, Patrick Michael Sparks, was a business professor and his mother, Jill Emma Marie Sparks (née Thoene), was a homemaker and an optometrist&#x27;s assistant. Sparks is of German, Czech, English, and Irish ancestry. He was the middle of three children, with an older brother, Michael Earl &quot;Micah&quot; Sparks (born 1964), and a younger sister, Danielle &quot;Dana&quot; Sparks Lewis (1966–2000), who died at the age of 33 from a brain tumor, an event that inspired his novel &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot;. As a child, Sparks lived in Watertown, Minnesota; Inglewood, California; Playa Del Rey, California; and Grand Island, Nebraska, before the family settled in Fair Oaks, California in 1974.

In 1984, Sparks graduated valedictorian of Bella Vista High School. He began writing while attending the University of Notre Dame on a track and field scholarship, majoring in business finance and graduating magna cum laude. Sparks wrote his first, never published, novel, &quot;The Passing&quot; in 1985 and a second unpublished novel called &quot;The Royal Murders&quot; in 1989. He married Cathy Cote in 1989 and moved to New Bern, North Carolina.

==Literary career==
Sparks&#x27; first published book was &quot;Wokini: A Lakota Journey to Happiness and Self-Understanding&quot;, a nonfiction book co-written by Billy Mills about Lakota spiritual beliefs and practices, published by Feather Publishing. The book sold 50,000 copies in its first year after release.

In 1995, literary agent Theresa Park secured a $1 million advance for &quot;The Notebook&quot; from Time Warner Book Group, the book that became Spark&#x27;s breakthrough novel. Published in October 1996, the novel made &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list in its first week of release and eventually spent fifty-six weeks there.

In 1998, after the publication of &quot;The Notebook&quot;, Sparks wrote &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; which, in 1999, became the first of his novels to be adapted for film in 1999. In total, eleven of his novels have been adapted as films: &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; (1999), &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; (2002), &quot;The Notebook&quot; (2004), &quot;Nights in Rodanthe&quot; (2008), &quot; Dear John&quot; (2010), &quot;The Last Song&quot; (2010), &quot;The Lucky One&quot; (2012), &quot;Safe Haven&quot; (2013), &quot;The Best of Me&quot; (2014), &quot;The Longest Ride&quot; (2015), and &quot;The Choice&quot; (2016). He has also sold the screenplay adaptations of &quot;True Believer&quot; and &quot;At First Sight&quot;.

Including &quot;The Notebook&quot;, fifteen of Sparks&#x27;s novels have been No. 1 New York Times Best Sellers, and all of his novels have been both New York Times and international bestsellers. Sparks has also often been listed on &quot;Forbes&quot; annual highest-paid authors lists.

In September 2020, Sparks published his twenty-first novel &quot;The Return&quot; and followed that up with &quot;The Wish&quot; in 2021 and &quot;Dreamland&quot; in 2022, each of which were optioned as films.

==Personal life==
Sparks lives in New Bern, North Carolina. He has three sons and twin daughters. In 2015, he divorced Cathy Cote, his wife of 25 years.

=== Philanthropy ===
In 2008, Sparks donated nearly $900,000 for a new, all-weather tartan track to New Bern High School, where he has also volunteered to coach. The same year, he also donated &quot;close to $10 million&quot; to start a private school, The Epiphany School of Global Studies. Sparks has also funded scholarships, internships, and annual fellowships at the University of Notre Dame Creative Writing Program. In 2012, he founded The Nicholas Sparks Foundation, a nonprofit that funds global education experiences for students, which has donated more than $15 million to charities, scholarship programs, and other projects.

<text>The Avoca River, an inland intermittent river of the northcentral catchment, part of the Murray-Darling basin, is located in the lower Riverina bioregion and Central Highlands and Wimmera regions of the Australian state of Victoria. The headwaters of the Avoca River rise on the northern slopes of the Pyrenees Range and descend to flow into the ephemeral Kerang Lakes.

==Features and location==
The Avoca River drains a substantial part of central Victoria. It rises at the foot of Mount Lonarch, near the small town of Amphitheatre, and flows north for joined by thirteen minor tributaries, and through the towns of , and . Two major distributaries leave the Avoca River between Charlton and Quambatook: Tyrrell Creek, flowing to Lake Tyrrell, and Lalbert Creek flowing to Lake Lalbert.

Although the Avoca River basin is part of the Murray-Darling basin, the Avoca River does not empty into the Murray. Nowhere a large stream, it dwindles as it flows north, eventually terminating in the Kerang Lakes, a network of ephemeral swamps west of Kerang and about south of the Murray River.

Although the Avoca River has a substantial catchment area, the fifth-largest in Victoria, most of that area is on the northern plains where rainfall averages only about per year, and where there is little runoff because the terrain is very flat. The mean annual runoff of per annum accounts for only 0.67% of Victoria&#x27;s runoff. Most of the water flowing in the Avoca River originates in the small upper portion of the catchment area, where rainfall averages about per year, most of it falling in the winter and spring.

Of all the Victorian rivers in the Murray-Darling basin, the Avoca River is the most variable. The average annual flow is , but recorded actual flows have varied from almost five times the average figure in very wet years, when the river can flood, to 0.5% of the average in drought years, when the flow is less than per day. In dry years, the flow can stop for many months.

Although it is the only river of significance in the area, no major water storages have been constructed on it, but there are six weirs of only local significance. Little use of the river is made for irrigation because, during the peak demand periods of summer and autumn, it is often not flowing. During low-flow periods, the water is usually too saline to use on crops, but can still provide drinking water for sheep and cattle.

The river is crossed by the Pyrenees Highway at Avoca, and the Borung Highway and the Calder Highway at Charlton.

==Etymology==
As the river is relatively long, Aboriginal peoples from various cultural groups lived near the river course. In the Djadjawurrung, Wathawurrung, Wergaia, and Wembawemba languages, the river has several names, including &quot;Natte yaluk&quot; and &quot;Boca&quot;, both with no clearly defined meaning; &quot;Bangyeno Banip&quot;, meaning bunyip waterholes; &quot;Djub-djub-galg&quot;, meaning a place where melaleuca was abundant; &quot;Witchelliba&quot;, with &quot;witji&quot; meaning basket grass and &quot;bar&quot; meaning river; and &quot;Yangeba&quot;, with no clearly defined meaning.

<text>Nationwide Arena is a multi-purpose arena in the Arena District of Columbus, Ohio, United States. Since completion in 2000, the arena has served as the home of the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL). It is one of two facilities in Columbus, along with the Greater Columbus Convention Center, that hosts events during the annual Arnold Classic, a sports and fitness event hosted by actor, bodybuilder, and former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger.

==History==
Nationwide Arena was built near the site of the former Ohio Penitentiary, which had an eastern border of West Street. The arena itself is built over the prison&#x27;s former parking lot. The arena&#x27;s parking lot and an apartment complex are built where the prison formerly stood. The arena was constructed in 2000.

On March 16, 2002, 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil was struck in the head by a deflected puck during the Blue Jackets&#x27; game against the Calgary Flames at Nationwide Arena. She died two days later, becoming the only NHL fan to be killed in a game-related accident. As a result of her death, the NHL mandated safety netting in all its arenas.

In May 2012, Columbus Mayor Michael B. Coleman made a pitch to the National Basketball Association (NBA) requesting an expansion or relocated team be moved to Nationwide Arena.

==Ownership==

The venue is named for the arena&#x27;s original majority owner, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, whose world headquarters are located across the street. On March 30, 2012, arena owners Nationwide Insurance and the Dispatch Publishing Group sold the facility to the Franklin County Convention Facilities Authority (FCCFA). As part of the sale, Nationwide agreed to lend the FCCFA $43.3 million to finance the arena&#x27;s purchase which will be paid back by 2039 with casino tax revenue collected by both the City of Columbus and Franklin County. In addition, the Ohio Department of Development agreed to a 10-year, $10 million loan to the FCCFA to assist with the facilities purchase. If the Blue Jackets meet annual roster payroll requirement, $500,000 of this loan per year will be forgiven. Nationwide Insurance will also pay the Blue Jackets $28 million to retain the arena&#x27;s naming rights until 2022 as well as $58 million to purchase 30% ownership stake in the franchise. The Blue Jackets, in turn, agreed to remain in the city until 2039 or pay $36 million in damages.

==Management==
While the Blue Jackets held sole operational control of the arena from 2000 to 2012, the team contracted day-to-day operations and event booking to venue management corporation SMG from the arena&#x27;s opening until June 30, 2010. On May 12, 2010, the Blue Jackets announced that SMG would not be retained as arena managers and further announced that a one-year, annually renewable, management contract had been signed with Ohio State University. The contract called for the university to take over both day to day arena operations as well as booking non-athletic events, with the Blue Jackets booking athletic events and maintaining overall control of the arena. This arrangement made Nationwide Arena a sister venue to OSU&#x27;s on-campus arena, Value City Arena. The university started booking acts in May 2010 and assumed day to day control of the arena on July 1, 2010. As part of the 2012 sale of Nationwide Arena, the Blue Jackets and OSU joined with Nationwide Insurance and the FCCFA to form Columbus Arena Management (CAM). Columbus Arena Management currently operates both Nationwide Arena and Value City Arena and oversees budgeting and event booking at both arenas.

==Design==
The arena is of a brick design and serves as the center of an entertainment district located about one-half of a mile north of the Ohio Statehouse. Seating capacity is approximately 18,500 for hockey, 17,171 for arena football, 19,500 for basketball, and up to 21,000 for concerts. The death of Brittanie Cecil from injuries sustained from a hockey puck flying into the stands at a Blue Jackets game on March 16, 2002, led to the installation of nylon netting to catch pucks that fly over the acrylic glass at all professional ice hockey arenas in the NHL, AHL, IIHF, and ECHL.

==Location==
The area surrounding Nationwide Arena, called the Arena District, is a mixed-use neighborhood developed by Nationwide Realty Investors featuring restaurants, bars, offices and residential buildings. The Columbus Clippers, a Triple-A baseball team of the International League, play in Huntington Park, also located in the Arena District and developed by Nationwide Realty Investors. Columbus uses the arena as a drawing point for the city with the other establishments feeding off of the foot traffic. The KEMBA Live! concert venue adjacent to the Nationwide Arena property, completes the entertainment complex.

==Facilities==

Nationwide Arena includes a smaller ice rink called the OhioHealth IceHaus, which serves as the practice rink for the Blue Jackets and is also used for youth hockey games and open skating times for the public. This facility made Nationwide Arena the first NHL arena with an on-site practice facility and, as of 2019, one of only four such facilities in the NHL, along with KeyBank Center in Buffalo, New York, Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, and Little Caesars Arena in Detroit, Michigan.

<text>The &#x27; (; ; &#x27;County of Venaissin&#x27;), often called the &#x27; for short, was a part of the Papal States from 1274 to 1791, in what is now the region of Southern France.

The region was an enclave within the Kingdom of France, comprising the area around the city of Avignon (itself always a separate ) roughly between the Rhône, the Durance and , and a small exclave located to the north around the town of purchased by Pope John XXII. The also bordered (and mostly surrounded) the Principality of Orange. The region is still known informally as the , although this no longer has any political meaning.

==History==
In 1096, the Comtat was part of the Margraviate of Provence that was inherited by Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse from William Bertrand of Provence. These lands in the Holy Roman Empire belonged to Joan, Countess of Toulouse, and her husband, Alphonse, Count of Poitiers. Alphonse bequeathed it to the Holy See on his death in 1271. Since this happened during an interregnum, there was no Holy Roman Emperor to protect Joan&#x27;s rights.

The Comtat became a Papal territory in 1274. The region was named after its former capital, Venasque, which was replaced as capital by Carpentras in 1320.

Avignon was sold to the papacy by Joanna I, Queen of Naples and Countess of Provence, in 1348, whereupon the two &quot;comtats&quot; were joined to form a unified papal enclave geographically, though retaining their separate political identities.

The enclave&#x27;s inhabitants did not pay taxes and were not subject to military service, making life in the Comtat considerably more attractive than under the French Crown. It became a haven for French Jews, who received better treatment under papal rule than in the rest of France. The Carpentras synagogue, built in the 14th century, is the oldest in France, and until the French Revolution preserved a distinctive Provençal Jewish tradition.

Successive French rulers sought to annex the region to France. It was invaded by French troops in 1663, 1668 and 1768–1774 during disputes between the Crown and the Church. It was also subjected to trade and customs restrictions during the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV.

Papal control continued until 1791, when an unauthorized plebiscite, under pressure from French revolutionaries, was held and the inhabitants voted for annexation by France. The process was facilitated by Pierre-Antoine Antonelle, then mayor of Arles. A few years later, Vaucluse &quot;département&quot; was created based on &quot;Comtat Venaissin&quot; including the exclave of Valréas and a part of the Luberon for the southern half. The papacy did not recognise this formally until 1814.

===Administration===
Under the Counts of Toulouse, the chief officer of the Comtat Venaissin was the Seneschal.

From 1294 to 1791 the chief administrator of the Comtat Venaissin was the Rector, who was appointed directly by the Pope. Most of the incumbents were in fact prelates, either Archbishops or Bishops, and the Rector therefore had the right to wear a purple garb, similar to that of an Apostolic Chamberlain. His official residence was in Carpentras. He had no authority over Avignon, however, which was administered by a Cardinal Legate or a Vice-Legate, also appointed directly by the Pope. Gradually, however, the power of the Vice-Legate encroached on that of the Rector, until the Cardinal virtually held the position of a governor, and the Rector had the functions of a judge. In both cases their tenure was for a period of three years, renewable.

The Rector had the right to receive the feudal oaths of homage of all the papal vassals. He also had the right to receive the oaths of bishops who held property by virtue of their office which was in feudal tenure from the pope. The Rector named the Notaries of the Comtat. He presided at the negotiation and payment of revenues of the Apostolic Chamber. His court was the Supreme Court of the Comtat Venaissin, and he had both criminal and civil jurisdiction of the first instance, and appellate jurisdiction from the courts of the regular judges of the three judicial circuits.

The Rector was seconded by a Vice-Rector, named the Lieutenant of the Rector, also a papal appointee. He had judicial powers similar to those of the Rector.

The administration of the Comtat was in the hands of the Estates of the Comtat, which consisted of the Élu (a nobleman), the Bishop of Carpentras, the Bishop of Cavaillon, the Bishop of Vaison, and eighteen representatives of the three judicial districts into which the Comtat was divided. The Estates held their meetings at Carpentras.

The Apostolic Camera (Treasury of the Holy Roman Church) had a permanent office in Carpentras, with full jurisdiction in all financial matters concerning the rights of the Holy See in the Comtat. This included the obligations of bishops and other ecclesiastical persons to the papacy.

<text>John McDouall Stuart (7 September 18155 June 1866), often referred to as simply &quot;McDouall Stuart&quot;, was a Scottish explorer and one of the most accomplished of all Australia&#x27;s inland explorers.

Stuart led the first successful expedition to traverse the Australian mainland from south to north and return, through the centre of the continent. His experience and the care he showed for his team ensured he never lost a man, despite the harshness of the country he encountered.

The explorations of Stuart eventually resulted in the 1863 annexation of a huge area of country to the Government of South Australia. This area became known as the Northern Territory. In 1911 the Commonwealth of Australia assumed responsibility for that area. In 1871–72 the Australian Overland Telegraph Line was constructed along Stuart&#x27;s route. The principal road from Port Augusta to Darwin was also established essentially on his route and was in 1942 named the Stuart Highway in his honour, following a recommendation by Governor-General Gowrie.

== Early life ==
Born in Dysart, Fife, Scotland, Stuart was the youngest of nine children. His father William Stuart was a retired army captain serving as a customs officer. Stuart&#x27;s parents died in his early teens and so he came under the care of relatives. He graduated from the Scottish Naval and Military Academy as a civil engineer before emigrating to Australia at the age of 23. Stuart was a slight, delicately built young man, standing about 5&#x27; 6&quot; tall (168 cm) and weighing less than 9 stone (about 54 kg).

In January 1839 he arrived aboard the barque &quot;Indus&quot; at the barely two-year-old frontier colony of South Australia, at that time little more than a single crowded outpost of tents and dirt-floored wooden huts. Stuart soon found employment with the colony&#x27;s Surveyor-General, working in the semi-arid scrub of the newly settled districts marking out blocks for settlers and miners.

==Charles Sturt&#x27;s protégé==

The Surveyor General of South Australia, Stuart&#x27;s superior officer, was the famous explorer Captain Charles Sturt, who had already solved the mystery of the inland-flowing rivers of New South Wales, in the process reaching and naming the Darling River, travelling the full length of the Murrumbidgee, and tracing the Murray to the sea. Stuart remained with the Survey Department until 1842 and then worked in the Mount Lofty Ranges as a private surveyor.

In 1844 Captain Sturt embarked on an expedition into the arid interior, and engaged Stuart as a draughtsman. Sturt&#x27;s expedition penetrated further north than any previous attempt, at the cost of great hardship. Instead of the hoped-for inland sea, the explorers found two of the most fearsome arid areas anywhere in Australia: Sturt Stony Desert and the Simpson Desert. After his second-in-command James Poole died of scurvy, Sturt appointed Stuart in his place. Both men survived to return to Adelaide, but suffered greatly from scurvy. Sturt never really recovered and soon returned to England; the younger Stuart was unable to work or travel for a year.

Stuart returned to his trade as a private surveyor, spending more and more time in remote areas, and moving to Port Lincoln for several years before moving again to the northern Flinders Ranges where he worked for the wealthy pastoralists William Finke, James Chambers, and John Chambers, exploring, prospecting for minerals, and surveying pastoral leases.

It is claimed that he was a member of Stephen Hack&#x27;s expedition of May and June 1857 looking for grazing country north and west of Streaky Bay and a private expedition to Lake Gairdner with Anthony Forster (later to become editor of &quot;The Register&quot;) in 1858.

==First expedition==
On 14 May 1858, with financial backing from William Finke, Stuart set off on the first of his six major expeditions. His aim was to find minerals, a land which the local Aboriginal people called Wingillpinin, and new grazing land in the north-west of South Australia. Stuart set out from John Chambers&#x27; station Oratunga, taking as companions two of Chambers&#x27; employees (a white man named Forster and a young Aboriginal man), half a dozen horses, and rations for six weeks, all provided by Chambers, a pocket compass and a watch. From the Flinders Ranges, Stuart travelled west, passing to the south of Lake Torrens, then north along the western edge of Lake Torrens. He found an isolated chain of semi-permanent waterholes which he named Chambers&#x27; Creek (now called Stuart Creek). It later became crucially important as a staging post for expeditions to the arid centre of the continent.

Continuing to the north-west, Stuart reached the vicinity of Coober Pedy (not realising that there was a fantastically rich opal field underfoot) before shortage of provisions and lack of feed for the horses forced him to turn towards the sea 500 kilometres to the south. A difficult journey along the edge of the Great Victorian Desert brought Stuart to Miller&#x27;s Water (near present-day Ceduna) and from there back to civilisation after four months and 2,400 kilometres. This expedition made Stuart&#x27;s reputation and brought him the award of a gold watch from the Royal Geographical Society.

==Second expedition==

Soon after his return from his first expedition, Stuart applied for a pastoral lease at Chambers Creek. Considered the discoverer, he was already entitled to a lease, but wanted rights to a larger area. As a bargaining chip in the negotiation process, Stuart offered to do the surveying himself and in April 1859 he set off with a party of three men and 15 horses. This gained for him the firm support and confidence of the Governor of South Australia, Richard Graves MacDonnell, himself a keen explorer. The Chambers Creek survey complete, Stuart explored to the north again, aiming to reach the border between South Australia and what is now the Northern Territory (at that time still a part of New South Wales). Although still well supplied with rations and not short of water, the expedition turned back about 100 kilometres short of the border because they had no more horse shoes (an essential item in that arid, stony region). Importantly, however, Stuart had found another reliable water supply for future attempts: a &quot;beautiful spring&quot; fed by the then-unknown Great Artesian Basin. He wrote:
:I have named this &quot;The Spring of Hope&quot;. It is a little brackish, not from salt, but soda, and runs a good stream of water. I have lived upon far worse water than this: to me it is of the utmost importance, and keeps my retreat open. I can go from here to Adelaide any time of the year and in any sort of season.
He returned in July with reports of &quot;wonderful country&quot;an extraordinary description of territory that is now barely able to support a few cattle.

==Third expedition==
At around this time in Australia, exploration fever was reaching a peak. Several factors contributed. At &quot;home&quot; (as Australians still called Britain), public attention was focussed on the search for the source of the Nile, with the competing expeditions of Speke, Burton and Baker all contending for the honour of discovery. Like the interior of Africa, inland Australia remained an embarrassing blank area on the map and although the long-held dreams of a fertile inland sea had faded, there was an intense desire to see the continent crossed. This was the apex of the age of heroic exploration.

Additionally, there was the factor of the telegraph. Invented only a few decades earlier, the technology had matured rapidly and a global network of undersea and overland cables was taking shape. The line from England had already reached India and plans were being made to extend it to the major population centres of Australia in Victoria and New South Wales. Several of the mainland colonies were competing to host the Australian terminus of the telegraph: Western Australia and New South Wales proposed long undersea cables; South Australia proposed employing the shortest possible undersea cable and bringing the telegraph ashore in Australia&#x27;s Top End. From there it would run overland for 3,000 kilometres south to Adelaide. The difficulty was obvious: the proposed route was not only remote and (so far as European settlers were concerned) uninhabited, it was simply a vast blank space on the map.

At much the same time, the wealthy rival colony Victoria was preparing the biggest and most lavishly equipped expedition in Australia&#x27;s history; the Victorian Exploring Expedition, to be led by Robert O&#x27;Hara Burke. The South Australian government offered a reward of £2,000 to any person able to cross the continent through the centre and discover a suitable route for the telegraph from Adelaide to the north coast. Stuart&#x27;s friends and sponsors, James &amp; John Chambers and Finke, asked the government to put up £1,000 to equip an expedition to be led by Stuart. The South Australian government, however, ignored Stuart and instead sponsored an expedition led by Alexander Tolmer, which failed miserably, failing to travel beyond the settled districts.

Meanwhile, Stuart was entangled with other problems. Some of the land he had claimed and surveyed in the Chambers Creek district on his second trip had in fact already been explored and claimed by people attracted to the area by reports of Stuart&#x27;s first trip. Stuart needed to return to Chambers Creek to re-survey his claims. He left Adelaide with a small party in August 1859. Having surveyed his own claim and several new claims on behalf of his sponsors, Stuart spent the spring and summer exploring the area west of Lake Eyre, finding several more artesian springs. Working through the severe heat of summer, Stuart experienced trouble with his eyes because of the glare, and after some time enduring half rations, all but one of his men refused to leave camp. Contemptuously, Stuart sent them home.

William Kekwick, his remaining companion, was reputed for his steadfastness and would stay with Stuart for the remainder of his career, usually organising the supply bases while Stuart scouted ahead. Kekwick went south for provisions and more men, returning with 13 horses, rations for three months, however only a single man; Benjamin Head.

==Fourth expedition==
On 2 March 1860 the three men left Chambers Creek, aiming to find the centre of Australia. As always, Stuart travelled light, taking only as much as could be carried on a few pack horses. The secret to successful exploration, in Stuart&#x27;s view, was to travel fast and avoid the delays and complications that always attend a large supply train.

By the time they reached Neales River (near present-day Oodnadatta) unexpected rain had ruined most of their stores and they continued on half-rations – something that Head, who had started the trip as a big man and weighed twice as much as Stuart, found difficult to adjust to. Water became more and more difficult to find and scurvy began to set in. Stuart&#x27;s right eye was failing. Nevertheless, they found a major watercourse in early April which Stuart named the Finke River, and followed it north-west over the South Australian border to the MacDonnell Ranges, which he named after Sir Richard Graves MacDonnell, Governor of South Australia, on 12 April 1860.
On 22 April 1860, according to Stuart&#x27;s calculations, the party reached the centre of the continent. Stuart wrote:
:There is a high mount about two miles to the NNE which I hoped would be in the centre but on it tomorrow I will raise a cone of stones and plant the Flag there and will name it Mount Sturt after my excellent and esteemed commander of the expedition in 1844 and 45, Captain Sturt, as a mark of gratitude for the great kindness I received from him during that journey.
In fact the mountain became known as Central Mount Stuart after Stuart himself, not his mentor Sturt, and geographers no longer regard it as the true centre of Australia. Nevertheless, it retains its symbolic value.

The explorers were unable to progress much further north. Lack of water forced them back again and again. Stuart&#x27;s scurvy was growing worse, Head was now half his original weight, and only Kekwick remained capable of heavy work. Then, on 22 May, it rained. With water now available nearly every day, they made good mileage and by mid June were able to reach a riverbed which Stuart named Tennant&#x27;s Creek (now the site of the township Tennant Creek). The worst of the country was now behind them and they were only about 800 km from the coast.

From here, however, progress seemed impossible. A four-day excursion to the north-west found no water at all and they had to retreat. After giving the horses a week to recover, they tried heading due north. They found another creek (later named Attack Creek) but were blocked by heavy scrub. Unlike those further south, the Warramunga Aboriginal people defended their country from trespassers. On 26 June they raided the explorers&#x27; camp. One stole the shoeing rasp (which Stuart was able to recover); others threw boomerangs at the horses and set fire to the grass around the camp. Like Sturt (and unlike some of the other Australian explorers) Stuart generally got on well with the Aboriginal people he encountered but he was unable to negotiate with this group and considered it unsafe to continue. That night, with even the indefatigable Kekwick complaining of weakness, the explorers abandoned their attempt to reach the north coast and reluctantly turned south.

It was 2,400 kilometres to Adelaide, all three men had scurvy, supplies were very short, the horses were in poor condition, and the country was drying out. Nevertheless, the party pressed on at Stuart&#x27;s customary rapid pace. They reached the safety of Chambers Creek in August. A few days earlier, on 20 August 1860, the larger Burke and Wills expedition had finally left Melbourne.

Stuart reached Adelaide in October 1860. Although he had narrowly failed to cross the continent, his achievement in determining the centre was immense, ranked with John Hanning Speke&#x27;s discovery of the source of the Nile. Stuart had solved that which he attempted with Capt. Sturt 15 years earlier – the riddle of the nature of the centre of the great Australian continent. He was awarded the Royal Geographical Society&#x27;s Patron&#x27;s Medal – becoming only the second person to receive both the Patron&#x27;s Medal and a gold watch (the other was Dr Livingstone). Belatedly, even the South Australian government started to recognise Stuart&#x27;s abilities, and was honoured with a public breakfast at White&#x27;s Rooms in Adelaide.

==Fifth expedition==
James Chambers put forward a plan for Stuart and Kekwick to return north with a government-provided armed guard to see them past the difficulties at Attack Creek. The government prevaricated and quibbled about cost, personnel, and ultimate control of the expedition, but eventually agreed to contribute ten armed men and £2,500; and put Stuart in operational command. (In contrast, the Burke and Wills expedition had cost £9,000 to establish. That expedition had already reached the Darling River in northern New South Wales.)

Stuart left Chambers Creek with a dozen men, 49 horses and rations for 30 weeks on 1 January 1861. It was high summer in South Australia and the worst possible time for travelling. Stuart was soon forced to send two men and the five weakest horses back. The heat was extreme and the party often delayed while Stuart searched for fodder and water. They were still in northern South Australia on 11 February, the day that Burke and Wills reached the Gulf of Carpentaria. With difficulty, Stuart&#x27;s party had reached the MacDonnell Ranges when heavy rains came, allowing them to press on northwards at a much better pace. They reached Attack Creek on 24 April 1861, this time finding no sign of the hostile tribesmen that had blocked the last attempt. At about the same time – and unknown to Stuart&#x27;s party, of course – Burke, Wills and King reached their base camp at Cooper Creek only to find it deserted. The fourth member of their party, Charles Gray, was already dead; Wills and then Burke perished within a few more days, leaving only King to be sustained by the kindness of the local Aboriginal people.

Stuart still planned to march north-west towards the known region of Victoria River, which had been mapped by Augustus Charles Gregory in 1858. Leaving the main expedition to rest, he led a series of small parties in that direction, but was blocked by thick scrub and a complete lack of water. After a great deal of effort, the scouting parties managed to find another watering point further north and Stuart moved the main body up. Over the next two weeks Stuart made three more attempts to find a practicable route over the plains to the north-west, but without success. Finally, he decided to try heading due north. He was rewarded with the discovery of &quot;a splendid sheet of water&quot; wide and long which he named &quot;Newcastle Water, after his Grace the Duke of Newcastle, Secretary for the Colonies&quot;.

For five more weeks the party camped at Newcastle Waters while Stuart tried to find a north-westward route to take them to Victoria River and thus the sea. The local Aboriginal people were wary of trespassers on their land, lighting fires around the camp and spooking the horses, and Kekwick had to mount an armed sentry with instructions to fire warning shots whenever they came near. Provisions were running short and both men and horses were in poor condition. Finally, on 1 July 1861, exactly six months after they had left Chambers Creek, Stuart ordered a return. In the relative cool of the southern winter, they travelled fast, reaching the settled regions of South Australia in September.

When Stuart learned that Burke and Wills were missing he immediately offered to join the search for them. The first rescue teams had left some time earlier, however, and soon returned with the news that no less than 7 members of the largest and best-equipped expedition in Australia&#x27;s history had died.

Public exploration mania had cooled considerably. Although Stuart had now led five expeditions into the arid centre of Australia and crossed all but the last few hundred miles of the continent without losing a man, the South Australian government was initially reluctant to back a sixth effort. However, the prospect of establishing a route for an overland telegraph line became a significant factor. The government finally provided £2,000 at the last minute on condition that Stuart took a scientist with him. James &amp; John Chambers along with William Finke remained the principal private backers.

==Sixth expedition (Crossing of Australia)==

Stuart&#x27;s sixth expedition was officially launched at James Chambers&#x27; home at North Adelaide on 23 October 1861. Their first stop, before they had reached the town of Gawler, was forced by trouble with their horses. One reared, striking Stuart&#x27;s temple with its hoof, rendering him unconscious then trampling his right hand, dislocating two joints and tearing flesh and nail from the first finger. At first it was feared amputation would be necessary, but Stuart and Waterhouse (the naturalist, appointed by the Government) were able to catch up with the rest of the party at Moolooloo (one of the Chambers brothers&#x27; stations) five weeks later. 
However they did not leave Chambers Creek until 8 January 1862. 
One of the party, John W. Woodforde, son of the City Coroner, was dismissed by Stuart for insubordination, having refused to be parted with his greatcoat, and, contrary to Stuart&#x27;s instructions, for keeping a personal diary.
The party comprised 10 men and 71 horses. Benjamin Head, veteran of the fourth expedition, was still too ill to accompany them. The party made good time to Newcastle Waters, reaching that point on 5 April, and experiencing conflict with the local Aboriginal people once again. Here they rested for a week before Stuart led a scouting party north, finding good water for the main body to move up to. The next stage, however, proved more difficult. Five times Stuart and his scouts tried to find a route towards Victoria River without success. Finally he headed north rather than north-west and was rewarded with a series of small waterholes leading to Daly Waters, about 150 kilometres north of Newcastle Waters.
Stuart made one last attempt to reach Victoria River before continuing north into the Top End. On 9 June he reached territory that had already been mapped and on 1 July the Mary River, which hadn&#x27;t, presuming it to be the Adelaide River (without a chronometer, determination of longitude was impossible). On 24 July 1862 the expedition reached a muddy beach on Van Diemen Gulf, 100 km east of today&#x27;s Darwin, and there marked a tree &quot;JMDS&quot; and named a nearby watercourse &quot;Thrings Creek&quot;. He and his companions had crossed the continent from south to north. The following day Stuart found a sizable tree which he marked with an &quot;S&quot; and there raised the Union Jack presented to him by Elizabeth Chambers, and named the long stretch of beach which lay to the west, Chambers Bay in her honour.

The ten successful members of the party are listed here with their age on the day of the expedition&#x27;s departure from North Adelaide.


==Character and last days==

By current standards Stuart was physically a small, wiry man, but in fact he was of average build of western European men at that time. 
He had a full dark beard and sometimes wore moleskin trousers and an unfashionable long-tailed blue coat with brass buttons and cabbage-tree hat.
He was able to endure privations and possessed a fierce determination which overrode any thought of personal comfort. He was not particularly gregarious; he had some good friends but seemed happiest away from crowds. 
He was a Freemason, being initiated in the Lodge of Truth, Adelaide, No. 649 on 1 August 1859, and retained membership until shortly before he returned to England. Another reference has him being inducted into the Lodge of Truth, North Adelaide, No. 933, on 5 April 1860.

Many years of hard conditions combined with malnutrition, scurvy, trachoma and other illnesses had rendered him practically blind, in pain and in such poor health that he spent some (900 km) of the return journey of his last expedition (1861–1862) being carried on a litter between two horses. He never recovered his health. He prepared his diaries for publication and on 23 April 1864 left aboard &quot;Indus&quot; for Britain, initially to visit his sister in Scotland. He died in London two years later, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.

== Recognition ==

While Stuart was responsible for naming a large number of topographical features for friends, backers and fellow explorers, he was sparing in the use of his own name. Central Mount Stuart, which he reckoned to be the geographical centre of Australia, he had designated &quot;Central Mount Sturt&quot; to honour his friend Charles Sturt. Places named after Stuart include:
* McDouall Peak, a hill in South Australia
*Stuart Street, an arterial road in the Canberra suburb of Griffith
*the Stuart Highway,
*Stuart Park, an inner Darwin suburb,
*Central Mount Stuart,
*Stuart Creek in the far north of South Australia,
*McDouall Stuart Avenue, Whyalla Norrie, South Australia
*Stuart High School, Whyalla Stuart, South Australia 
*the Electoral division of Stuart in the Northern Territory,
*Electoral district of Stuart, an electoral division in South Australia,
*Stuart Range upland, close to the town of Stuart Range which was changed to Coober Pedy, and
*the town of Stuart, which was changed to Alice Springs in 1933.

A statue by James White honouring Stuart can be found in Victoria Square, Adelaide, while in Darwin, both a statue and a monument celebrate his achievements.

In March 2010, the McDouall Stuart Lodge of Freemasons in Alice Springs commissioned a 4-metre high ferro-concrete statue of Stuart for donation to the Alice Springs Town Council to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Stuart&#x27;s fourth expedition, during which he had reached the centre of the continent. The statue is located in a heritage precinct near the old hospital.

In England, Stuart is commemorated by a blue plaque on the house where he lived and died in Kensington, London, No. 9 Campden Hill Square. In 2011 his grave in Kensal Green cemetery, London, was refurbished to its former glory. In Dysart, Scotland there is also a blue plaque on the house where he was born. The property, John McDouall Stuart View, is available as a holiday let, restored and owned by Fife Historic Buildings Trust.

Stuart is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of Australian lizard, &quot;Ctenotus stuarti&quot;.

==Associates==
Among those who shared Stuart&#x27;s travails were:
*William Darton Kekwick (c. 1830 – 16 October 1872) arrived in South Australia with his widowed father and seven siblings in April 1840 aboard &quot;Warrior&quot;. He was second-in-command to Stuart on each of his expeditions from the third (1859). On 19 June 1860 Stuart named Kekwick Ponds in the Northern Territory for his trusted deputy.
:Kekwick married Marian Caroline Owen in 1864 and had four children. He was appointed mineral and botanical collector for William Gosse&#x27;s expedition to Central Australia, but fell ill before they set out, and died at Nuccaleena on the way back to Adelaide. His remains were buried at Blinman and a monument erected over the grave by the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia.
*Francis William Thring (1 May 1837 – 17 July 1908), born in Netherhampton, England, the son of a lawyer, he arrived in South Australia with his parents and three siblings in November 1849 aboard &quot;Duke of Wellington&quot;. He was a member of Stuart&#x27;s last two exploration parties, in 1860–61 and 1861–62.
:He was a member of one more brief but noteworthy exploration party, that of John McKinlay to the Top End in 1865–66. Government had grown impatient at Finniss&#x27;s lack of progress at Escape Cliffs and sent McKinlay to report, and to investigate alternative sites for the new settlement. The expedition proved a near-disaster but recommended Port Darwin as a better location. Thring served as manager of stations at Angaston and Two Wells. He opened a business in Adelaide as a stock and station agent.
:He married Clara Davey (28 January 1843 – 10 March 1934) in 1868 and had thirteen children. They had a home in Regent Street, Parkside, where he died. His remains were interred at the West Terrace Cemetery and a monument erected over the grave by the Royal Geographical Society of South Australia.
:Family
:Francis William Thring (1 May 1837 – 17 July 1908) married Clara (c. 1842 – 10 March 1934) in 1868. Among their children were:

<doc id="679421" wikidata="Q1349310" url="?curid=679421" title="William McChesney Martin">
<text>William McChesney Martin Jr. (December 17, 1906 – July 27, 1998) was an American business executive who served as the 9th chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1951 to 1970, making him the longest holder of that position. He was nominated to the post by President Harry S. Truman and reappointed by four of his successors. Martin, who once considered becoming a Presbyterian minister, was described by a Washington journalist as &quot;the happy Puritan&quot;.

==Early life==
William McChesney Martin Jr. was born in St. Louis to William McChesney Martin Sr. and Rebecca Woods. Martin&#x27;s connection to the Federal Reserve was forged through his family heritage. In 1913, Martin&#x27;s father was summoned by President Woodrow Wilson and Senator Carter Glass to help write the Federal Reserve Act that would establish the Federal Reserve System on December 23 of that year. His father later served as a governor and then president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Martin graduated from Yale University, where his formal education was in English and Latin rather than finance. However, he still maintained an intense interest in business through his father. His first job after graduation was at the St. Louis brokerage firm of A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, where he became a full partner after only two years. From there, Martin&#x27;s rapid rise in the financial world landed him in 1931 a seat on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), just two years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 at the outset of the Great Depression. Martin pursued graduate study in Economics at Columbia University from 1931 to 1937; however, he did not receive a degree. During the early part of that decade, Martin&#x27;s work towards increasing regulation of the stock market led to his election to the NYSE&#x27;s board of governors in 1935. There, he worked with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to reestablish confidence in the stock market and prevent future crashes. He eventually became president of the New York Stock Exchange at age 31, leading newspapers to label him the &quot;boy wonder of Wall Street.&quot; During his presidency, Martin worked with the SEC on regulatory measures for the stock exchange.

During World War II he was drafted into the United States Army as a private and rose to the rank of colonel. While in the service, he supervised the disposal of raw materials on the Munitions Allocation Board. He was also a liaison between the Army and Congress, as well as the supervisor of the lend-lease program with the Soviet Union.

==Career==

===Director of the Export-Import Bank===
Martin&#x27;s return to civilian life was also a return to the financial world, but this time it was in the Federal government. Harry S. Truman, a fellow Democrat, appointed Martin director of the Export-Import Bank, which he operated for three years (1946–1949). It was at this institution that he was publicly viewed as a &quot;hard banker.&quot; He insisted that loans be sound, secure investments; on that principle he opposed the State Department on multiple occasions for making loans that he saw as being politically motivated. On those grounds he would not permit the Export-Import Bank to be used as a fund for international relief.

Martin left the Export-Import bank when he was summoned to the Treasury to serve as assistant secretary for monetary affairs. Martin served at the Treasury for about two years when its conflict with the Federal Reserve Board reached its climax. During the period immediately preceding the final negotiations with the Fed, Secretary of the Treasury John W. Snyder was hospitalized. In this situation, Martin became the chief negotiator for the Treasury. From the Treasury&#x27;s perspective, Martin was a valuable representative, for he had a thorough understanding of the Federal Reserve System and of financial markets. Furthermore, he was viewed as an ally of Truman, who strongly opposed the Fed&#x27;s independence. During negotiations, Martin re-established communication between the Treasury and Fed, which had been forbidden by Snyder.

===Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board===
With Robert Rouse, Woodlief Thomas, and Winfield Riefler of the Fed, Martin negotiated the 1951 Accord. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Secretary Snyder accepted the Accord, and it was approved by both institutions. The chairman of the Board of Governors at the time of ratification was Thomas B. McCabe (1893–1982), who would officially resign from his position just six days after the statement of the Accord was released. The Truman Administration viewed McCabe&#x27;s resignation as an opportunity to influence Federal Reserve leadership. Truman appointed Martin to serve as the next chairman of the Board of Governors, and the Senate approved his appointment on March 21, 1951.

Contrary to Truman&#x27;s expectations, however, Martin guarded the Fed&#x27;s independence, not just through Truman&#x27;s administration but also through the four succeeding administrations. To the present day, his term as chairman is the longest term in the history of the Fed. For nearly two decades, Martin would achieve global recognition as the world&#x27;s most important central banker. He was able to pursue independent monetary policies while still paying heed to the desires of various presidential administrations. Martin&#x27;s monetary policies aimed at achieving low inflation and economic stability through a comprehensive analysis of multiple economic indicators (an example of oversimplification) and instead made policy decisions by examining a wide array of economic data. As chairman, he institutionalized this strategy in the proceedings of the FOMC, gathering the opinions of all governors and presidents within the System before making decisions. As a result, his decisions were often supported by unanimous votes on the FOMC. The task of the Federal Reserve, he famously said, is &quot;to take away the punch bowl just as the party gets going,&quot; that is, raise interest rates just when the economy reaches peak activity after a recession.

Martin was designated as administrator of the Emergency Stabilization Agency, an initiative established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1958 that would serve in the event of a national emergency, and that became known as the Eisenhower Ten.

After the presidential election of 1960, Republican Party candidate Richard Nixon blamed his defeat on Martin&#x27;s tight-money policies.

Martin was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963 and the American Philosophical Society in 1972.

In 1966 he underwent successful prostate surgery.

Martin was often viewed as a key decision-maker at the Fed, although some have debated the extent of his influence. Throughout his tenure, he defended the right of the Fed to take actions that would sometimes conflict with presidential goals. He regularly asserted that the Fed is responsible to the US Congress and not to the White House. Richard Nixon anticipated Martin&#x27;s resignation at the beginning of his administration in 1969, but Martin chose to remain in his post. Pursuing a tight-money policy to suppress inflation, by mid-1969 Martin ran afoul of Nixon&#x27;s concern that the Fed was in danger of pushing the nation into economic recession, a belief that had been publicly stated by conservative economist Milton Friedman. At a White House meeting on October 15, 1969, Nixon confronted Martin over his tight-money policy, but Martin declined to yield. Two days later, the White House announced that Arthur Burns would replace Martin as chairman of the Federal Reserve on Feb. 1, 1970. 
Martin ended his tenure as chairman of the Board of Governors on January 30, 1970. After his tenure at the Federal Reserve, Martin held directorships in various corporations and nonprofit organizations, such as the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.

Martin was an avid tennis player who played tennis nearly every day on the tennis court located outside the Federal Reserve Board Building in Washington, D.C. Martin would go on to serve as president of the National Tennis Foundation and chair of the International Tennis Hall of Fame after retiring from the Federal Reserve.

He died of a heart attack at his home in Washington, D.C., on July 28, 1998, at the age of 91.

<text>General Sir George Scovell, (21 March 1774 – 17 January 1861) was a member of the quartermaster&#x27;s staff of the British Army in Iberia during the Peninsular War.

==Military career==
Scovell&#x27;s parents were George Scovell of Cirencester and the daughter of John Fielding. He was commissioned as cornet and adjutant in the 4th Queen&#x27;s Own Dragoons in 1798.

He served as Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General at the 1809 Battle of Corunna. For his service in the Peninsular War, he received the gold cross with one clasp and the silver war medal with eight claps.

Scovell is most remembered for the crucial role he played in breaking the codes of the French forces during that war, their &quot;Grand Chiffre&quot;. A gifted linguist, he was put in charge of a motley crew of various nationalities recruited for their local knowledge and language skills and called the Army Guides. They developed a system for intercepting and deciphering French communiqués.

In the spring of 1811, the French began using a code based on a combination of 150 numbers known as the Army of Portugal Code. Scovell cracked the code within two days. At the end of 1811, a new code called the Great Paris Code was sent to all French army officers. It was based on 1400 numbers and derived from a mid-eighteenth century diplomatic code (&quot;Grand Chiffre&quot;) which added meaningless figures to the end of letters. By December 1812, when a letter from Joseph Bonaparte to Napoleon was intercepted, Scovell could decipher enough of it to read Joseph&#x27;s explicit account of French operations and plans. The information gained proved vital to Wellington&#x27;s victory over the French at Vitoria on 21 June 1813.

In 1813 Scovell was given the task of raising, then commanding, the Staff Corps of Cavalry, also known as the Staff Dragoons or the Corps of Gendarmerie. This formation, of four troops equipped as light dragoons (though in red uniforms), was the first formal unit of military police in the British army. The Staff Dragoons, in addition to their policing role, undertook escort and other staff-related duties and were also employed as combat cavalry on occasion.

For his service at Waterloo, he was awarded the 4th class of the Order of St Vladimir.

Scovell was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 2 January 1815 and a Knight Grand Cross (GCB) on 18 May 1860. In later life, Scovell became Lieutenant-Governor (1829–1837) and then Governor (1837–1856) of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

Scovell retired from the British Army as a general.

He died at Henley Park, Guildford and was buried in the cemetery of the Royal Military College, Sandhurst (now the RMAS).

==Family life==
Scovell married the daughter of Samuel Clowes of Broughton, Lancashire in 1805.

==Legacy==
The Memorials to Governors in the Chapel of the present-day Royal Military Academy Sandhurst includes:
&quot;In Memory of General Sir George Scovell, G.C.B., Colonel of the 4th Light Dragoons. Born 21st March 1774. Died 17th January 1861. He was on the Staff of the Duke of Wellington throughout the Peninsular War, and at Waterloo, and was Governor of this College from 1837 to 1856.&quot;

<text>Borgarfjörður () is a fjord in the west of Iceland near the town of Borgarnes. Although the waters of Borgarfjörður appear calm, the fjord has significant undercurrents and shallows. The many flat islands lying in the fjord are for the most part uninhabited.

Near Borgarnes, the &quot;hringvegur&quot; (road no.1 or &quot;ring road&quot;) passes over Borgarfjarðarbrú, a bridge of 0.5 km in length at the inland portion of the fjord.

The land around the fjord has been inhabited since the time of Icelandic settlement. Events in the Icelandic sagas such as that of Egill Skallagrímsson are situated here.

The name of the fjord seems to have come from the farm &quot;Borg&quot;, which according to the sagas was founded by Egill&#x27;s father Skallagrímur, who took the land around the fjord and accordingly gave the fjord the name of Borgarfjörður.

While serving as a synonym for the various townships, farms, natural attractions and areas in the region, the various parts of Borgarfjörður are now generally referred to as Borgarbyggð, a name that in Icelandic denotes residential areas, populated places, such as Borgarnes, tourist resorts and attractions, and less populated farms and more remote natural areas. The name Borgafjorður refers to the actual fjord and surrounding beaches as a natural habitat.

<text>Ski warfare is the use of ski-equipped troops in war.

==History==

===Early===

Ski warfare is first recorded by the Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in the 13th century. During the Battle of Oslo in 1161, Norwegian troops used skis for reconnoitering. They were also used in 1452 in Sweden, and in the 15th to 17th centuries by various other Scandinavian countries. Norwegian Captain Jens Emahusen wrote a military ski manual &quot;Skiloperegglement&quot; in 1733. In 1767, military ski competitions began. They evolved into the biathlon.

===Napoleonic Wars===
Denmark–Norway (though only Norwegian) ski troops were used against Sweden during the Gunboat War in the Napoleonic Wars.
===World War I===
Just prior and during World War I many combatants deployed ski troops as part of mountain infantry divisions. France created the Briançon military ski school in 1904. The Italian Army raised 88 Alpini Battalions. Their purpose was to fight summer and winter in the highest regions of the Alpine Arch. Most of the battalions were dissolved after World War I. Only nine Alpini regiments remain in service today, and only four still train every soldier in ski warfare: the 4th Alpini Parachutist Regiment, 5th Alpini Regiment, 6th Alpini Regiment and 7th Alpini Regiment. France&#x27;s Chasseurs Alpins, created in 1888, consisted of 12 battalions. Currently three remain. Romanian Mountain Corps consisted of three battalions. 
The Austro-Hungarian Army had the Kaiserjäger. German Alpenkorps was founded in 1915 with two brigades.

The Ottoman Empire deployed ski shock troops in the Caucasus Campaign of the WWI.

===World War II===

Ski troops played a key role in the successes of the Finnish war effort against the Soviet Union during the Winter War in 1939. Forested, rural terrain with no roads was used by Finnish ski troops with great success against the advancing mechanized Soviet troops. In the Battle of Suomussalmi, two Soviet mechanized divisions (45,000 men) were annihilated by three Finnish regiments (11,000 men).

Italian ski troops included the &quot;Arditi Alpieri&quot; formation, the &quot;Monte Bianco&quot; formation, the &quot;Monte Cervino&quot; battalion, and the &quot;Monte Rosa&quot; battalion. They were deployed in France, the Balkans, and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union deployed 11 ski battalions, among other troops, in November 1941 to reinforce their defenses in the Battle of Moscow.

The most common transportation for Norwegian soldiers during the Norwegian Campaign in 1940 was skis and sleds, and in &quot;Operation Gunnerside&quot;, paradropped Norwegian commandos covered a large distance using skis in order to reach and sabotage the heavy water plant &quot;Vemork&quot; at Rjukan in Telemark, Norway, which was being used by the Germans as part of their nuclear research programme.

Ski warfare even extended to the Middle East where the Australian Ski Corps were deployed against Vichy French forces in the mountains of Lebanon.

The United States Army 10th Mountain Division was established and trained for ski combat. They were deployed in Italy.

==Contemporary usage==

Swedish, Finnish and Norwegian defense forces use skis in cross country skiing but also by pulling squads of soldiers with tracked transport vehicles or snow mobiles. One or two ropes hang from the end of a tracked vehicle such as the famous Swedish Hägglunds Bandvagn 206 or the Finnish Sisu Nasu and troops hang onto the ropes with their hands and ski-poles.

Many nations train troops in skiing and winter warfare, including:
* Austrian Army — Certain soldiers are trained in ski combat.
* Canadian Army — Certain troops, such as Voltigeurs de Québec, are trained in winter warfare operation and skiing. Multiple units like the Voltigeurs form the Arctic Response Company Group.
* Danish Navy — Slædepatruljen Sirius (Sirius Arctic Patrol) patrols Northern and Eastern Greenland.
* Estonian Army — Conscripts routinely receive training in skiing and other winter warfare skills.
* Finnish Army — All soldiers are trained in ski combat, and skiing is a part of standard required training for conscripts.
* French Army — 27th &quot;Chasseurs Alpins&quot; Brigade
* German Bundeswehr — &quot;Gebirgsjäger&quot;

<text>Henry Ries (September 22, 1917 – May 24, 2004) was a photographer who worked for &quot;New York Times&quot;. His most famous photo was of &quot;The Berlin Air Lift&quot; which was later made into a U.S. Postage Stamp commemorative.

Ries was born in Berlin and grew up in Germany, but sensed the impending doom of Hitler&#x27;s political style and, as a Jew, emigrated to the United States in 1937. Immigration officials in New York sent him back to the Third Reich because of technical problems with his papers. Ries was permitted to enter America in January 1938, having crossed the Atlantic twice to do so.

When America entered World War II, Ries immediately joined the army and fought in the Asian Theater, humorously pointing out that he served in Asia due to his &quot;good German&quot; skills. He was stationed in India with an aerial reconnaissance unit. After the war, in August 1945, Ries, still a soldier, returned to Berlin. He soon resigned from the army in order to work for the OMGUS Observer as a photojournalist. Two years later, he begin to work for &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a European photographer, photographing many of the scenes of destroyed post-war Germany including the destruction and Berlin blockade which have become iconic images. In 1951, Ries returned to the US and eventually turned to commercial photography. In 1955, he opened his own studio in Manhattan.

When he returned to Berlin in 1945, he pronounced the city forever changed. In his book, &quot;Abschied meiner Generation&quot;, he said, &quot;Seeing all this devastation and desperation, confronted with hunger and fear, cripples and black-marketers – and with no Nazi in sight anywhere – I realized how fundamentally the seven years between emigration and occupation had changed Germany&#x27;s exterior and my own interior.&quot;

During his time with the &quot;Times&quot;, he met and photographed the famous and the infamous, such as artists Pablo Picasso and Pablo Casals, as well as Spanish General Francisco Franco.

In 2003 he was awarded Germany&#x27;s Officer Cross of the Order of Merit, the highest award for citizens of other countries.

<text>Qualification for the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004 UEFA European Championship]] took place between September 2002 and November 2003.

Fifty teams were divided into ten groups, with each team playing the others in their group twice, once at home and once away. The top team in each group automatically qualified for Euro 2004, and the ten group runners-up were paired off against each other to determine another five places in the finals.

Portugal qualified automatically as hosts of the event.

==Qualified teams==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Tiebreakers==
If two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria were applied to determine the rankings:
# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# If two or more teams still had an equal ranking, criteria 1) to 4) would be reapplied. If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 6) and 7) would apply.
# Results of all group matches: 1. Superior goal difference 2. Higher number of goals scored 3. Higher number of goals scored away from home 4. Fair play conduct.
# Drawing of lots.

==Seedings==
The draw occurred on 25 January 2002 in Santa Maria da Feira, Portugal. 50 teams were divided into five drawing pots based on the latest 2001-edition of the UEFA National Team Coefficient ranking, that had calculated an average of the team&#x27;s points per game achieved combined in the Euro 2000 qualifiers and 2002 World Cup qualifiers. The seeding list was however subject to some few minor modifications:
* France (ranked 11) were seeded first as the defending champions (title holders). Consequently, all teams ranked above them from 1 to 10 moved down one seeding place lower than their rankings.
* Portugal (ranked 4) was not seeded, as they did not participate in the qualifying tournament due to already having qualified automatically for the final tournament as hosts. Consequently, all teams ranked below them moved up one seeding place higher than their ranking position.

Ten groups were formed by drawing one team from each of the five pots.

It was shared by Charlton Athletic from 1985 to 1991 and Wimbledon from 1991 to 2003. 

==History==
In 1922, a former brickfield site was bought from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company for £2,750 by Crystal Palace F.C. The club had been pursuing a deal for the ground as early as 25 February 1919. The stadium was designed by Scottish architect Archibald Leitch, and constructed by Humphreys of Kensington (a firm regularly used by Leitch) for around £30,000. It was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of London on 30 August 1924. There was then only one stand, the present Main Stand, but this was unfinished due to industrial action. Crystal Palace played The Wednesday and lost 0–1 in front of 25,000 fans.

Two years later, on St David&#x27;s Day in 1926, England played Wales in an international match at the stadium. England amateur matches and various other finals were also staged there, as were other sports including boxing, bicycle polo (in the late 1940s), and cricket and music concerts (in the 1980s). In addition to this, it hosted two games for the 1948 Summer Olympics.

In 1953, the stadium&#x27;s first floodlights were installed, consisting of numerous poles around the 3 sides of terracing and four roof-mounted installations on the Main Stand. They were replaced nine years later by floodlights mounted on pylons in each corner, and six installations on the Main Stand roof. Real Madrid marked the occasion by playing under the new set of bulbs – a real footballing coup at the time for third division Palace, as it was Real&#x27;s first ever match in London.

The ground remained undeveloped until 1969, when Palace were promoted to Division One (then the highest tier of English football) for the first time. The Arthur Wait Stand was built, named after the club&#x27;s long-serving chairman, who was a builder by trade and was often seen working on the site himself. Arthur Wait was notable for overseeing Palace&#x27;s rise from the Fourth to the First Division, in the 1960s. The Whitehorse Lane end was given a new look when a &quot;second tier&quot; of terracing, brick-built refreshments and toilets were provided along the top.

The Safety of Grounds Act required the Holmesdale Road terrace (the preferred stand for the Crystal Palace supporters) to be split into three sections for safety reasons. The remaining poorer facilities were mainly where opposition supporters were situated. New facilities were subsequently built at the back of the Holmesdale Stand. In the summer of 1981, the Main Stand terraced enclosure was redesigned and refitted with seating. This year also saw Palace sell the back of the Whitehorse Lane terrace and adjacent land to supermarket retailer Sainsbury&#x27;s for £2m, to help their financial problems. The size of the terrace at this end was effectively halved.

Charlton Athletic moved into the stadium as temporary tenants in 1985, and became with Palace the first league clubs in England to agree such a ground-sharing scheme. The following year, Palace chairman Ron Noades purchased the stadium from the club as a means of raising revenue. In the summer of 1990, the lower half of the Arthur Wait Stand was converted to all-seater with the assistance of Football Trust Grant Aid, following the Taylor Report into the Hillsborough Disaster. Two rows of executive boxes (48 in total) were constructed above the Whitehorse Lane terrace (on the roof of Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket) in 1991, and this was subsequently roofed and made all-seater in the summer of 1993.

Charlton moved back to The Valley via West Ham&#x27;s Boleyn Ground, and Wimbledon F.C. replaced them as tenants in 1991. The Holmesdale terrace was demolished in 1994 and replaced a year later with a two-tiered 8,500 capacity stand. The roof cladding of the main stand was also replaced, the previous one having started to leak. Some 25 years on, this remains the most recent major work to be carried out at Selhurst Park.

When Mark Goldberg bought Crystal Palace, he bought just the club. Former Palace chairman Ron Noades retained ownership of the Selhurst Park stadium, having purchased it from the club in 1986. Simon Jordan took out a ten-year lease on the stadium upon his purchase of Crystal Palace in 2000, and Noades received rent from the club. When Wimbledon relocated to Milton Keynes in 2003, a section of their fans had already decamped to the newly established AFC Wimbledon in protest, when the old club were given permission by the FA to move in 2002.

Palace chairman Jordan stated that he had completed a purchase of the freehold of Selhurst Park from Altonwood Limited (Ron Noades&#x27; company) for £12m in October 2006. However, Jordan never owned the freehold or had any interest in it and his reasons for claiming he had bought it are unknown. Ownership was in fact held by Selhurst Park Limited, a joint venture between HBOS and the Rock property empire owned by Paul Kemsley, a former director of Tottenham Hotspur. In April 2008, a 25-year lease was granted to Crystal Palace at an annual rent of £1.2m.

The Rock Group went into administration in June 2009, the management of the freehold was taken on by PwC acting on behalf of Lloyds Bank, which now own HBOS. PwC expected to sell it within two years. The club and Selhurst Park stadium were purchased by the CPFC 2010 consortium in June 2010, leading to the stadium and Football Club being united in a company for the first time since 1998.

In 2011, the club announced proposals to move back to their original home at the National Stadium. In June 2012, Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish approached Rugby Union team London Welsh about a possible ground-share. London Welsh&#x27;s promotion to the English Premiership was in doubt, as their plans to play their matches at Kassam Stadium were deemed unsuitable by the RFU.

In 2018, the club announced that a £100m renovation of Selhurst Park was imminent, to bring it closer in terms of quality to modern Premier League grounds. However, the expansion was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and due the club&#x27;s focus on delivering its Academy upgrade at Beckenham completed in 2021. When the club finally focused again on the stand expansion, further delays occurred due to opposition to the demolition of houses in nearby Wooderson Close which was resolved when the club signed a legal agreement to provide replacement homes to relocate residents. In August 2024, the expansion was re-approved by Croydon Council and preliminary works commenced with proposed completion by summer 2027.

Selhurst Park was used in the Apple TV+ series &quot;Ted Lasso&quot; as Nelson Road, the fictional home stadium of AFC Richmond.

== The stands ==
=== Holmesdale Road Stand ===
Capacity of stand: 8,329

The Holmesdale is a double-tiered stand (Lower tier 5,510, Upper tier 2,819). Built in 1994, this is the newest stand in the stadium, replacing the previous terrace end. It forms the South East end of the stadium.

=== Arthur Wates Stand ===
Capacity of stand: 9,574

Part of this stand seats the away supporters (approx. 3,000). It was opened in 1969, and named after the then Palace chairman. It forms the North East side of the stadium.

=== Main Stand ===
Capacity of stand: 5,460 + Press Seats (63)

This original stand opened in 1924 and forms the South West side of the stadium. It includes the Directors Box, and offices/Main Entrance that were built at the rear of the stand during the 1990s. The exterior of the stand has been re-cladded in white replacing the old original blue painted corrugated iron. New seats were also installed during the summer of 2013, including several lounges/Bars and a restaurant situated within the stand. With new investment confirmed, the club put forward plans for this stand to be redeveloped into a three-tier structure (13,500-seater), building over then removing the current stand (extending overall stadium capacity to 34,000). The new stand will feature an all-glass frontage, inspired by the original Crystal Palace. It was approved at a Croydon Council meeting on 19 April 2018, and club had planned for the work to start in summer 2019, with the new stand to be ready in time for the 2021–22 season, but various delays put back the work, which eventually commenced in 2024, to be completed by the summer of 2027.

=== Whitehorse Lane Stand ===

Capacity of stand: 2,219 + seating for executive boxes (480)

Originally built as a standing terrace, it was redeveloped in the early 1980s. It is also known as the Family Stand for Crystal Palace supporters.

<text>Breiðafjörður (, &quot;wide fjord&quot;) is a large shallow bay, about wide and long, to the west of Iceland. It separates the region of the Westfjords (Vestfirðir) from the Snæfellsnes peninsula to the south. Breiðafjörður is encircled by mountains, including Kirkjufell and the glacier Snæfellsjökull on the Snæfellsnes peninsula, and the Látrabjarg bird cliffs at the tip of the Westfjords. Numerous smaller fjords extend inland from Breiðafjörður, the largest being Hvammsfjörður at its southeastern corner. An interesting feature of the bay is that the land to the north was formed about 15 million years ago, whereas the land to the south was formed less than half that time ago.. Breiðafjörður therefore was formed by tectonic movements and all the islands and skerries were made by volcanic eruptions to form ridges and craters that mostly line up in a east-west position. 

==Nature==

Breiðafjörður has a land and seascape consisting of shallow seas, small fjords and bays, and intertidal areas, dotted with about 3,000 islands, islets and skerries. The area contains about half of Iceland&#x27;s intertidal area and tides can be . The bedrock was formed during rift volcanism in the late Tertiary period. The area consists mainly of basaltic lava that was deeply eroded by glaciers during the quaternary age, creating a diverse landscape. There are several geothermal sites, some visible only at low tide.

==Plants and Animals==
The large intertidal zone is high in biodiversity and productivity and has extensive algal forests and other important habitats for fish and invertebrates. By far the most dominant species is Ascophyllum nodosum seaweed. The land-area supports 230 species of vascular plants and around 50 breeding bird species including the common shag, glaucous gull, white-tailed eagle, common eider, black guillemot and grey phalarope. The area is important staging area for brent goose and red knot. The common seal and the grey seal have their main haul-out on the islands and skerries.

Several species of cetaceans are commonly found including the common porpoise, white-beaked dolphin, killer whale and minke whale but also sharks.

==Islands==
The islands in Breiðafjörður have an unbroken history of human use, but now only Flatey is inhabited year-round. Many islands are used for summer residences and for harvesting of natural resources such as eiderdown and landowners decide wheteher to allow the harvest of Ascophyllum at their shores. Some of the islands include:
== Economy and ecology ==

Seaweed harvest, fisheries, tourism and algal harvesting are other major uses of the area. The largest seaweed harvester in Iceland, with a history of sustainable harvesting for about 50 years is Thorverk. Thorverk was first established in 1976 by the local farmers and the Icelandic state. During its history Ascophyllum has only been harvested at the same spot every 4 or 5 years. The Icelandic Marine Research Institute monitors the resource and allows a catch quota. All harvest is registered at the Fisheries directory. Just South of Reykhólar, on a small island offshore is also Norður &amp; Co. manufactures sea salt obtained by evaporation of seawater using geothermal energy. The process was first used in this region in 1753 and was chosen by Soren Røsenkilde when he established Norður in 2012.

Breiðafjörður is the spawning ground for some of Iceland&#x27;s most important economic fish species and a variety of invertebrates.

==Transport==
From the small port of Stykkishólmur on the Snæfellsnes peninsula, a ferry crosses Breiðafjörður to Brjánslækur in the Westfjords, stopping at the island of Flatey on the way. It is also possible to circle around Breiðafjörður overland, by car. If the weather is fine, it is possible to see the coastline of the Westfjords from the Snæfellsnes peninsula, at a distance of up to .

==Culture and history==
During the Middle Ages, especially in the 12th century, there was a monastery of Augustine monks on the island of Flatey which formed an important centre of Icelandic culture. The most extensive medieval manuscript, the &quot;Flateyjarbók&quot; was written there. Afterwards, the island was an important trading post and also home to a printing press.

<text>The Philadelphia Sphas, also stylized SPHAs or SPHAS, were an American basketball franchise that existed in professional, semi-professional, and exhibition forms. They played their home games in the ballroom of Philadelphia&#x27;s Broadwood Hotel. The team&#x27;s name is an acronym, derived from South Philadelphia Hebrew Association (the group that initially funded the team), and the team&#x27;s players, at least in its earlier years, were primarily Jewish. Future Philadelphia Warriors owner Eddie Gottlieb founded the team as an amateur group shortly after he and some close friends graduated from high school, and it later became a professional team. The Sphas played in many leagues around the Philadelphia area and the East Coast, most notably the Eastern Basketball League and the American Basketball League (ABL), between which the Sphas won 10 championships. The Sphas won a total of 12 championships, their first two coming from the early Philadelphia League and Philadelphia Basket Ball League.

==History==
===Origins as YMHA===
The Sphas&#x27; existence began in 1917 as an amateur team by neighborhood friends Eddie Gottlieb, Harry Passon, and Hughie Black, who wanted to keep their high school championship team together. The team&#x27;s first season took place in the American League of Philadelphia, a minor league that comprised six area teams. They were sponsored by the Young Men&#x27;s Hebrew Association of South Philadelphia and were called Philadelphia YMHA for that season. The team turned in a 4–11 record, tied for last in the league that year. After this season, each YMHA withdrew its support for the team, citing dissatisfaction with the game&#x27;s violent nature.

===Change to Sphas and &quot;Wandering Jews&quot; period===
After losing their sponsorship from the YMHA, Gottlieb, Passon, and Black approached the South Philadelphia Hebrew Association about sponsoring the team. The association agreed to sponsor the men and provided funding for uniforms to the team. The new uniforms featured the acronym SPHA in Hebrew (ספהא) across the front. Again, their sponsorial relationship was short-lived, as the SPHA withdrew their sponsorship shortly after for an unspecified reason. The men had better financial solvency this time around, as they opened a sporting goods store, calling it P.G.B. Sporting Goods. With the store, they created new uniforms, but kept the Sphas moniker as a way of paying tribute to their upbringing. Douglas Stark, author of &quot;The SPHAS: The Life and Times of Basketball&#x27;s Greatest Jewish Team&quot;, noted that &quot;[f]or a number of years, the team was known as the Wandering Jews, because the team did not have its own home court.&quot; 

The team continued to play in the American League of Philadelphia after losing their partnership with the SPHA, and played in two different leagues during 1922–23 season: The Manufacturer&#x27;s League, containing teams from area companies, and the Philadelphia League, which consisted of teams from the greater Philadelphia area, a number of them religious. In their single season in the Manufacturer&#x27;s League, the team (known as Philadelphia Passon, Gottlieb, Black since they competed through Passon and Black&#x27;s sporting goods store) turned in an overall 8–6 record, finishing 3rd in the first half of that season and 6th (out of 8) in the second half. Their first season in the Philadelphia League was a disappointing one, turning in an 8–11 record and finishing 2nd in the first half of the season, but last in the second half at 1–8. The Sphas&#x27; next season in the Philadelphia League would prove more fruitful (due in part to the increased number of games), as the Sphas turned in a 25–15 record, overcoming a first-half slump of 14–13 (5th out of 8) to finish first in the second half of the season with an 11–3 record. They went on that year to defeat the Tri-Council Caseys 2–0 for their first championship.

===Early championships, success against barnstorming teams, first ABL stint and name change===
For the 1924–25 season, the Philadelphia League reconstituted itself as the Philadelphia Basket Ball League, dropping the number of teams in the league to six. The Sphas continued a strong spate of play, finishing 1st in the first half of the season, and third in the second half. They would go on to be repeat champions that season, winning 2–1 again over Tri-Council. Due to the success of the Sphas against teams in the Philadelphia area, and frustration with playing in the &quot;poorly managed&quot; Eastern League in 1924–25, owner Eddie Gottlieb set up games against professional teams from the newly-formed American Basketball League. The Sphas played a six-game stretch against the Brooklyn Arcadians, Fort Wayne Caseys, Cleveland Rosenblums, Washington Palace Five, and a team from New York&#x27;s Metropolitan League, the Paterson Legionaires. The Sphas won five out of six games in this series, and Gottlieb subsequently scheduled games against two top barnstorming teams of the day, the Original Celtics and New York Renaissance. The Sphas defeated the Original Celtics 2–1 and swept the Rens, 2–0. The team&#x27;s victories over these top barnstorming teams gave them increased notability in the burgeoning professional basketball community. Riding the wave of victories his team achieved against the ABL and barnstorming teams, Gottlieb entered the Sphas in the ABL, rechristening them the Philadelphia Warriors. During their two years in the ABL as the Warriors, the team performed moderately well, finishing third (14–7) and then fourth (10–11) in the 1926–27 season. For the 1927–28 season, the ABL split into two divisions (Eastern and Western). The Warriors played in the Eastern Division and finished third with a 30–21 record. This allowed them entry into the playoffs, where they lost to the New York Celtics 2–0.

== Later years ==
With the 1946 advent of the Basketball Association of America, the immediate predecessor of the NBA, the ABL became a minor-league, and the Sphas would remain there as a semi-professional team until 1949. 1949 would be the last year the Sphas were affiliated with a league, but thanks to Gottlieb&#x27;s friendship with Abe Saperstein, president and owner of the Harlem Globetrotters, the Sphas lived on as one of the exhibition teams that the Globetrotters would play, although they would retain only the franchise name, not the Jewish makeup of the team.

Despite popular wisdom, the Sphas did not directly evolve into the Washington Generals. Instead, Saperstein had asked Red Klotz to create a separate exhibition team because the Sphas had beaten the Globetrotters on more than one occasion. After creating the Generals, Klotz sold the Sphas to one of his players, Pete Monska, who coached the team &quot;for a year or two until it disbanded [in October 1959.]&quot; The Sphas played their last game as the original team on October 17, 1959, losing to the Globetrotters in a double-header exhibition game. The Sphas were then reconstituted as the Baltimore Rockets, another Globetrotters exhibition team.

On 6 June, midfielder Johann Lonfat was withdrawn from the squad after suffering a back injury; he was originally going to be replaced by Juventus forward Davide Chiumiento, but he declined the selection in favour of waiting for a call-up by Italy, meaning that Tranquillo Barnetta replaced Lonfat instead.

<text>Source is a 3D game engine developed by Valve. It debuted as the successor to GoldSrc in 2004 with the releases of &quot;Half-Life: Source&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike: Source&quot;, and &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;. Valve used Source in many of their games in the following years, including &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, &quot;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&quot;, &quot;Dota 2&quot;, and the &quot;Portal&quot; and &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; franchises. Other notable third-party games using Source include most games in the &quot;Titanfall&quot; franchise, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dear Esther&quot;, &quot;The Stanley Parable&quot; and &quot;Garry’s Mod&quot;. Valve released incremental updates to the engine during its lifetime. Source was succeeded in 2015 by the release of Source 2.

== History ==
Source distantly originates from the GoldSrc engine, itself a heavily modified version of John Carmack&#x27;s Quake engine with some code from the Quake II engine. Carmack commented on his blog in 2004 that &quot;there are still bits of early &quot;Quake&quot; code in &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;&quot;. Valve employee Erik Johnson explained the engine&#x27;s nomenclature on the Valve Developer Community:

Source was developed part-by-part from this fork onwards, slowly replacing GoldSrc in Valve&#x27;s internal projects and, in part, explaining the reasons behind its unusually modular nature. Valve&#x27;s development of Source since has been a mixture of licensed middleware and in-house-developed code. Older versions of Source use Bink Video for video playback, however more recent releases of the Source engine use WebM videos for menu backgrounds, Full Motion Videos, and splash screens.

=== Modularity and notable updates ===
Source was created to evolve incrementally with new technology, as opposed to the backward compatibility-breaking &quot;version jumps&quot; of its competitors. Different systems within Source are represented by separate modules which can be updated independently. With Steam, Valve can distribute these updates automatically among its many users. In practice, however, there have been occasional breaks in this chain of compatibility. The release of &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot; and &quot;The Orange Box&quot; both introduced new versions of the engine that could not be used to run older games or mods without the developers performing upgrades to code and, in some cases, content. Both cases required markedly less work to update its version than competing engines.

==== Source 2006 ====
The Source 2006 branch was the term used for Valve&#x27;s games using technology that culminated with the release of &quot;Half-Life 2: Episode One&quot;. HDR rendering and color correction were first implemented in 2005 using &quot;Day of Defeat: Source&quot;, which required the engine&#x27;s shaders to be rewritten. The former, along with developer commentary tracks, were showcased in &quot;Half-Life 2: Lost Coast&quot;. &quot;Episode One&quot; introduced Phong shading and other smaller features. Image-based rendering technology had been in development for &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, but was cut from the engine before its release. It was mentioned again by Gabe Newell in 2006 as a piece of technology he would like to add to Source to implement support for much larger scenes that are impossible with strictly polygonal objects.

==== Source 2007 ====
The Source 2007 branch represented a full upgrade of the Source engine for the release of &quot;The Orange Box&quot;. An artist-driven, threaded particle system replaced previously hard-coded effects for all of the games within. An in-process tools framework was created to support it, which also supported the initial builds of Source Filmmaker. In addition, the facial animation system was made hardware-accelerated on modern video cards for &quot;feature film and broadcast television&quot; quality. The release of &quot;The Orange Box&quot; on multiple platforms allowed for a large code refactoring, which let the Source engine take advantage of multiple CPU cores. However, support on the PC was experimental and unstable until the release of &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot;. Multiprocessor support was later backported to &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; and &quot;Day of Defeat: Source&quot;. Valve created the Xbox 360 release of &quot;The Orange Box&quot; in-house, and support for the console is fully integrated into the main engine codeline. It includes asset converters, cross-platform play and Xbox Live integration. The PlayStation 3 release was outsourced to Electronic Arts, and was plagued with issues throughout the process. Gabe Newell cited these issues when criticizing the console during the release of &quot;The Orange Box&quot;.

==== &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; branch ====
The Left 4 Dead branch is an overhaul of many aspects of the Source engine through the development of the &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; series. Multiprocessor support was further expanded, allowing for features like split screen multiplayer, additional post-processing effects, event scripting with Squirrel, and the highly-dynamic AI Director. The menu interface was re-implemented with a new layout designed to be more console-oriented. This branch later fueled the releases of &quot;Alien Swarm&quot; and &quot;Portal 2&quot;, the former released with source code outlining many of the changes made since the branch began. &quot;Portal 2&quot;, in addition, served as the result of Valve taking the problem of porting to PlayStation 3 in-house, and in combination with Steamworks integration creating what they called &quot;the best console version of the game&quot;.

==== OS X, Linux, and Android support ====
In April 2010, Valve released all of their major Source games on OS X, coinciding with the release of the Steam client on the same platform. Valve announced that all their future games would be released simultaneously for Windows and Mac. The first of Valve&#x27;s games to support Linux was &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;, the port released in October 2012 along with the closed beta of the Linux version of Steam. Both the OS X and Linux ports of the engine take advantage of OpenGL and are powered by Simple DirectMedia Layer. During the process of porting, Valve rearranged most of the games released up to &quot;The Orange Box&quot; into separate, but parallel &quot;singleplayer&quot; and &quot;multiplayer&quot; branches. The game code to these branches was made public to mod developers in 2013, and they serve as the current stable release of Source designated for mods. Support for Valve&#x27;s internal Steam Pipe distribution system as well as the Oculus Rift are included. In May 2014, Nvidia released ports of &quot;Portal&quot; and &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; to their Tegra 4-based Android handheld game console Nvidia Shield.

=== Source 2 ===

Source 2 was announced by Valve as the successor to Source at the Game Developers Conference in March 2015. There, Valve stated that it would be free to use for developers, with support for the Vulkan graphical API, as well as using a new in-house physics engine called Rubikon. In June 2015, Valve announced that &quot;Dota 2&quot;, originally made in the Source engine, would be ported over to Source 2 in an update called &quot;Dota 2 Reborn&quot;. &quot;Reborn&quot; was first released to the public as an opt-in beta update that same month before officially replacing the original client in September 2015, making it the first game to use the engine. The engine had succeeded Source by the late 2010s.

== Tools and resources ==
=== Source SDK ===
Source SDK is the software development kit for the Source engine, and contains many of the tools used by Valve to develop assets for their games. It comes with several command-line programs designed for special functions within the asset pipeline, as well as a few GUI-based programs designed for handling more complex functions. Source SDK was launched as a free standalone toolset through Steam, and required a Source game to be purchased on the same account. Since the release of &quot;Left 4 Dead&quot; in late 2008, Valve began releasing &quot;Authoring Tools&quot; for individual games, which constitute the same programs adapted for each game&#x27;s engine build. After &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot; became free-to-play, Source SDK was effectively made open to all Steam users. When some Source games were updated to Source 2013, the older Source SDKs were phased out. The three applications mentioned below are now included in the install of each game.

There are three applications packaged in the Source SDK: Hammer Editor, Model Viewer, and Face Poser. The Model Viewer is a program that allows users to view models and can be used for a variety of different purposes, including development. Developers may use the program to view models and their corresponding animations, attachment points, bones, and so on. Face Poser is the tool used to access facial animations and choreography systems. This tool allows one to edit facial expressions, gestures and movements for characters, lip sync speech, and sequence expressions and other acting cues and preview what the scene will look like in the game engine. 

==== Hammer Editor ====
The Hammer Editor, the engine&#x27;s official level editor, uses rendering and compiling tools included in the SDK to create maps using the binary space partitioning (BSP) method. Level geometry is created with 3D polygons called brushes; each face can be assigned a texture which also defines the properties of the surface such as the sounds used for footsteps. Faces can also be converted into a displacement allowing for more natural shapes such as hills to be created.

Scenery objects or complex geometry can be imported as separate 3D models from the game directory. These models can also be used as physics objects or interactive props. The editor also features an in-depth logic I/O system that can be used to create complex interactive elements. Signals to trigger different responses or change the state of an entity can be sent between entities such as buttons, NPCs, intangible trigger brushes, and map props.

=== Source Dedicated Server ===
The Source Dedicated Server (SRCDS) is a standalone launcher for the Source engine that runs multiplayer game sessions without requiring a client. It can be launched through Windows or Linux and can allow for custom levels and assets. Most third-party servers additionally run Metamod:Source and SourceMod, which together provide a framework on top of SRCDS for custom modification of gameplay on existing titles.

=== Source Filmmaker ===

Source Filmmaker (SFM) is a 3D animation application that was built from within the Source engine. Developed by Valve, the tool was originally used to create movies for &quot;Day of Defeat: Source&quot; and &quot;Team Fortress 2&quot;. It was also used to create some trailers for Source Engine games. SFM was released to the public in 2012.

=== Destinations Workshop Tools ===
In June 2016, Valve released the Destinations Workshop Tools, a set of free virtual reality (VR) creation tools running using the Source 2 SDK.

=== Valve Developer Community ===
In June 2005, Valve opened the Valve Developer Community wiki. It replaced Valve&#x27;s static Source SDK documentation with a full MediaWiki-powered community site.

=== Academic papers ===
Valve staff have occasionally produced professional and/or academic papers for various events and publications, including SIGGRAPH, Game Developer Magazine and Game Developers Conference, explaining various aspects of Source engine&#x27;s development.

== Notable games using Source ==

&quot;Titanfall&quot;, &quot;Titanfall 2&quot;, and &quot;Apex Legends&quot; are not included because their engines, while originally based on the Source SDK, were modified to the point that they are effectively different engines.

<doc id="679491" wikidata="Q553528" url="?curid=679491" title="Alejandro Fernández">
<text>Alejandro Fernández Abarca (; born 24 April 1971) is a Mexican singer. Born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, he is the son of the Mexican singer Vicente Fernández. Nicknamed as &quot;El Potrillo&quot; by the media and his fans, he has sold over 20 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling Latin music artists. He originally specialized in traditional, earthy forms of Mexican folk, such as mariachi and charro, until he successfully branched out into pop music. Over the course of his career, he has been awarded four Latin Grammy Awards and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Career==

===Early years===
Alejandro Fernández was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco. His first appearance in the spectacular presentation was in 1976; in one of his father&#x27;s shows.

Fernández released his first album &quot;Alejandro Fernández&quot; under Sony Music. Its main hits were &quot;Necesito olvidarla&quot;, &quot;Brumas&quot; and &quot;Equivocadamente&quot;. With this material, Alejandro began a tour in Mexico and some cities of the United States. In 1993, he performed with his father in a concert at the Palacio de los Deportes, and he continued for a season at the Teatro Blanquita in Mexico City. The same year Alejandro released the successful &quot;Piel de Niña&quot;, produced by Pedro Ramírez. The songs &quot;Piel de Niña&quot;, &quot;A La Vera del Camino&quot;, and &quot;Cascos Ligeros&quot; were some of the main hits on the album. At the Lo Nuestro Awards of 1993 Fernández was nominated for Male Artist, New Artist and Regional Mexican Album of the Year for his debut album, winning none.

In 1994 he released the album &quot;Grandes Éxitos a la Manera de Alejandro Fernández&quot;, covering pieces from legendary composers such as Armando Manzanero, Luis Demetrio and Agustín Lara. At the 9th Lo Nuestro Awards, Fernández received a nomination for Regional Mexican Male Performer of the Year.

===1995–1998: &quot;Que Seas Muy Feliz&quot;, &quot;Me Estoy Enamorando&quot;===

In 1995, he released the album &quot;Que Seas Muy Feliz&quot;. The song &quot;Como Quien Pierde Una Estrella&quot; became his first international hit. It was heavily promoted on radio and television shows.

In 1996, his release &quot;Muy Dentro de Mi Corazón&quot; was an instant success. Songs like &quot;Moño Negro&quot;, &quot;Nube Viajera&quot; and &quot;Abrazame&quot; became hits in Mexico and several countries in Latin America. That same year he recorded &quot;Puedes Llegar&quot;, the theme song for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, with singers Gloria Estefan, Jon Secada and Ricky Martin, among others. In 1997, he recorded the album &quot;Me Estoy Enamorando&quot;, produced by Emilio Estefan, Jr. The album is a fusion of bolero, romantic ballad, orchestral arrangements and elements of Mexican mariachi that became popular in the Latin music sector. &quot;Si Tú Supieras&quot; was the most successful hit of that production, and it was chosen as the theme of the hit soap opera of the time, &quot;Maria Isabel&quot;. It also conquered the U.S. market, lasting seven weeks at the top of &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Tracks. He became the first Latin singer to hold first place with three hits: &quot;Si tu supieras&quot; was followed by &quot;En El Jardín&quot; (with Gloria Estefan) and &quot;No Sé Olvidar&quot;. &quot;Me Estoy Enamorando&quot; sold 2.2 million copies worldwide and was nominated for Best Latin Pop Performance at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards. In December 1998, he recorded &quot;Christmas in Vienna VI&quot; with the tenor Plácido Domingo and Patricia Kaas. His performance was praised by critics but it did not achieve much popularity among the audience.

===1999–2003: &quot;Mi Verdad&quot;, &quot;Entre Tus Brazos&quot;, &quot;Orígenes&quot;===
With the album &quot;Mi Verdad&quot; of 1999, Fernández returned to ranchera music. Mi Verdad was nominated for Best Mexican-American performance at the 42nd annual Grammy Awards. &quot;Si He Sabido Amor&quot; became a big hit and was the theme of the hit soap opera &quot;Infierno en el Paraíso&quot;.

In 2000, he released the album &quot;Entre tus brazos&quot;, the eighth in his career and the second one with Emilio Estefan, Jr. as the producer. &quot;Quiéreme&quot; was the first single, a fast-tempo pop song that showed his musical versatility. For the first time in his career, he included a song from his own inspiration: &quot;Entre Tus Brazos&quot;. The album contains mostly romantic ballads with energetic Latin rhythms. That same year, he and Julio Iglesias recorded the song &quot;Dos Corazones, Dos Historias;&quot; it appeared on Julio&#x27;s album &quot;Noche de Cuatro Lunas&quot;.

In 2001, he recorded &quot;Orígenes&quot;. The single &quot;Tantina Pena&quot; (a flamenco-style mariachi bolero) became an international hit. In 2002, he launched his production &quot;Un Canto De México&quot;, which contains twenty-two classic ranchera songs. It was recorded live at the Palacio de Bellas Artes. In 2003, Alejandro began a Latin American tour with his father Vicente, and recorded the show called &quot;En Vivo: Juntos Por Ultima Vez&quot;, which was witnessed by thousands of fans, culminating in Mexico City at the Foro Sol, with over five hours of music in front of nearly 60,000 spectators. That same year he recorded his next album &quot;Niña amada mía&quot;. The title song became a hit and the theme of a popular soap opera of the same name. That same year, Alejandro toured Latin America and the United States. Later he participated in the Christmas special &quot;En mi país&quot;, recorded in Puerto Rico and broadcast by Telemundo. Fernández and Ednita Nazario performed a duet of &quot;Triste Navidad&quot; (&quot;Sad Christmas&quot;).

===2004–2006: &quot;A Corazón Abierto, México – Madrid&quot;===
In 2004, he played the lead role in &quot;&quot;, a movie about the Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata by filmmaker Alfonso Arau. That same year, &quot;A Corazón Abierto&quot; reunited Alejandro with Grammy-winning producer and songwriter Kike Santander, who penned his greatest hits from &quot;Me Estoy Enamorando&quot;. He also recruited multiple talented younger songwriters, including Gian Marco, Leonel García (of pop duo Sin Bandera), Reyli Barba (former member of pop band Elefante) and Mexican group Tres De Copas.

&quot;Romanticism is something that will never die&quot;, declared Alejandro Fernández, explaining his choice of songs on &quot;A Corazón Abierto&quot;, his breakthrough recording about lost love, love that is never forgotten and the capacity to always love again. &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m super, ultra passionate. We&#x27;re releasing an album that&#x27;s an x-ray of myself. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s titled &quot;A Corazón Abierto&quot; (&quot;In Open Heart&quot;). It was something very honest. Not naked, but something deeper than that&quot;&quot;. The album released the singles: &quot;¿Que voy a hacer con mi amor?&quot;, &quot;Qué lastima&quot;, &quot;Me dediqué a perderte&quot; and the smash hit &quot;Canta corazón&quot;.

In 2005, Alejandro released &quot;México - Madrid: En Directo Y Sin Escalas&quot; (&quot;Mexico – Madrid: Nonstop&quot;), featuring 13 tracks including one new song. Produced by Aureo Baquiero and filmed in front of a live audience at Spain&#x27;s &quot;Palacio de Congresos IFEMA&quot;, the production features Fernández performing some of his biggest hits accompanied by a 28-piece orchestra and some of Spain&#x27;s most important voices on three of the songs: Amaia Montero from La Oreja de Van Gogh joins him on &quot;Me dediqué a perderte&quot;; Malú duets with him on &quot;Contigo aprendí&quot;, and with flamenco star Diego El Cigala perform a fast-tempo version of &quot;Como quien pierde una estrella&quot;, accompanied on cajón by famed flamenco guitarist Niño Josele. That same year, Alejandro was chosen to sing along with the tenors José Carreras and Plácido Domingo in a special concert celebrating the opening of the &quot;Forum Internacional de las Culturas&quot; in Monterrey. At first his father Vicente was invited but he turned it down. Alejandro showed his skilled vocals and operatic tenor range, singing pieces of opera such as &quot;Granada&quot;; his performance was praised by the audience. He also recorded a duet with the tenor Mario Frangoulis called &quot;Hay más&quot; from the album Follow Your Heart. After that, Alejandro went on tour with two Latin American stars: Marc Anthony and Chayanne, passing through several major U.S. cities. On 2 December 2005, Los Angeles, gave him a star on the legendary Hollywood Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard.

===2007–2010: &quot;Viento a Favor&quot;, &quot;Dos Mundos&quot;===
In 2007, he released &quot;Viento A Favor&quot; featuring tunes written by Leonel García and Noel Schajris (better known as emotive Latin-pop duo Sin Bandera) and Mexican singer Reyli Barba. The first two singles were &quot;Te Voy A Perder&quot;, and &quot;Amor Gitano&quot;, a duet with Beyoncé. After that &quot;Cuando Estamos Juntos&quot; and &quot;No Se Me Hace Fácil&quot;, became hits; &quot;Eres&quot; was the last single of the album.

In 2008, Alejandro started a tour in Spain, covering cities such as Madrid, Valencia and A Coruña. He released the album &quot;De Noche: Clásicos A Mi Manera&quot;; it features classic romantic ballads and boleros such as &quot;El Reloj&quot; and &quot;Regálame esta noche&quot;, songs that he recorded previously but never released.

In 2009, his voice was the theme of &quot;Mañana es para siempre&quot;, the most successful Mexican soap opera of the year. The Grammy-winning singer, composer and producer Nelly Furtado invited Alejandro to perform in a duet for her album &quot;Mi Plan&quot;. The song &quot;Sueños&quot; was recorded in Miami.

&quot;Dos Mundos&quot; (&quot;Two Worlds&quot;), is a double production, releasing two albums simultaneously: &quot;Dos Mundos: Evolución + Tradición&quot;. One of them is pop, produced by Aureo Baqueiro, and the other is ranchera and mariachi, produced by Joan Sebastian. No Latin artist had done anything similar before. On 11 November 2009 he simultaneously released the videos of the singles &quot;Estuve&quot; and &quot;Se Me Va la Voz&quot;. He released the videos of the singles &quot;Me Hace Tanto Bien&quot; and &quot;Bandida&quot;. On 22 November 2010, Alejandro released the live album &quot;Dos Mundos: Revolución&quot; that includes live versions of songs from his album &quot; Dos mundos: Evolución / Dos mundos: Tradición&quot;, two unreleased tracks &quot;Tu Sabes Quien&quot;, &quot;Felicidades&quot; and the song &quot;Vamos a darnos tiempo&quot; originally performed by the iconic singer José José.

===2011–2017: &quot;Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti&quot;, &quot;Confidencias, Rompiendo Fronteras&quot;===
Between June and August 2011, he went on his Dos Mundos: Revolucion Tour. On 1 August 2011, Alejandro released the song &quot;El mismo sol&quot;, which was released as the theme of the 2011 Pan American Games. He toured Latin America along with fellow singer Marc Anthony in a series of concerts named &quot;Dos Mundos, un Concierto&quot; &quot;(Two Worlds, one Concert)&quot;. Alejandro collaborated with Christina Aguilera on a cover of the song &quot;Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti&quot;, released as the theme song for the soap opera &quot;La tempestad&quot;. After only 17 days, the song was certified platinum in Mexico, with 65,000 sales from digital downloads. On 27 August 2013, he released the album &quot;Confidencias.&quot; It includes the duet with Christina Aguilera, along with duets with Vicente Fernández and Rod Stewart. In 2014, his song &quot;Te Amare&quot; was released as the theme song for the soap opera &quot;Hasta el fin del mundo&quot; replacing the original theme of Pedro Fernández. In 2015, Alejandro collaborated with Alejandro Sanz on a cover of the song &quot;A que no me dejas&quot;, released as the theme song for the soap opera &quot;A que no me dejas&quot;. In 2016, Fernández was inducted into the Billboard Latin Music Hall of Fame. In February 2017, he released the album &quot;Rompiendo Fronteras&quot; and the single &quot;Sé que te duele&quot; became an instant hit.

===2023: &quot;Amor y Patria&quot;===
In 2023 Fernandez announced the tour named &quot;Amor y Patria&quot; (Love and Country in Spanish). His tour started in California, and included performances in Texas.

===Sony Music controversy===
The international record label Sony Music was sued by Alejandro Fernández after they tried to release an album with some of his unreleased songs after his contract with the label had ended. Federal Police arrived at the Sony headquarters in Mexico City and seized about 6,000 copies of the album. The song &quot;Diferente&quot;, was released on the internet as the first single of the album.

==Artistry==
Following the steps of his father, Fernández began his musical career focusing on ranchera music. Since his 1997 album &quot;Me Estoy Enamorando&quot; he has branched out successfully into pop music. In his live presentations, he begins the show with his ranchera repertoire, then removes his charro outfit to perform pop songs.

Fernández has a baritone tessitura. His vocal ability and versatility have allowed him to perform romantic ballads, pop and ranchera music simultaneously. He has performed with artists such as Plácido Domingo, Marc Anthony, José Carreras, Chayanne, Amaia Montero, Joan Sebastian, Gloria Estefan, Malú, Ha*Ash, Julio Iglesias, Patricia Kaas, Miguel Bosé, Mario Frangoulis, Ednita Nazario, Yuri, Franco De Vita, Diego El Cigala, Nelly Furtado, Beyoncé, Christina Aguilera, Rod Stewart, Morat, Los Tigres del Norte, Sebastián Yatra, David Bisbal, Christian Nodal, Héctor Acosta, Calibre 50, Mon Laferte as well as family members; his father Vicente Fernández, his daughter Camila Fernández, and his son Alex Fernández.

==Personal life==

Fernández studied to become an architect, but turned to singing in 1991 with the encouragement of his father. He is the youngest son of his family. He has two older brothers, Vicente, Jr., and Gerardo, and a sister, Alejandra. He and his brothers are known in Mexico as &quot;Los tres potrillos&quot; (The three colts).

In the late 1990s, Fernández&#x27;s older brother Vicente, Jr., was kidnapped by a band of organized crime. The kidnappers cut off two of his fingers and sent them to his father as a warning. After Vicente Fernández allegedly paid a large sum of money, Vicente, Jr., was released. The exact amount was never announced.

Fernández is co-owner of a shopping center in Guadalajara called &quot;Unicenter&quot;, containing various businesses and employing around 170 people.
He collaborated with his family in the construction of Arena VFG, with a capacity for 11,000 people. The arena hosts mainly musical performances and charreria competitions. Fernández is an expert in horse riding and charreria. He is a supporter of the Mexican football team Atlas, and is good friends with iconic footballer Rafael Márquez.

Fernández has five children: three (Alejandro, Jr. and the twin girls América and Camila) with his ex-wife América Guinart, and two (Emiliano and Valentina) with Colombian model Ximena Díaz. In the mid-2000s, he claimed to have undergone a vasectomy.

<text>Denis the Carthusian (1402–1471), also known as Denys van Leeuwen, Denis Ryckel, Dionysius van Rijkel, Denys le Chartreux (or other combinations of these terms), was a Roman Catholic theologian and mystic.

==Life==
Denis was born in 1402 in that part of the present-day Belgian Province of Limburg which was formerly comprised in the County of Hesbaye. His birthplace was Rijkel, a small village a few miles from Sint-Truiden, whence ancient writers have often surnamed him &quot;Ryckel&quot; or &quot;à Ryckel&quot;. He first attended school at Sint-Truiden. In 1415 he went to another school at Zwolle (Overijssel), which was then of great repute and attracted many students from various parts of Germany. He there entered upon the study of philosophy and became acquainted with the principles and practice of religious life, which the rector, John Cele, himself taught. Shortly after the rector&#x27;s death (1417) Denis returned home. By the age of 18 he had decided to become a monk. He applied to the Carthusian monastery at Roermond only to be told he could not be admitted until he reached the minimum age of 20. The Prior at Roermond urged him to enter the University of Cologne to study philosophy and theology for the next two years. Having earned his Master of Arts degree, he entered the Carthusian monastery at Roermond (Dutch Limburg) in 1424.

Believing that the most perfect life was a blend of contemplation and action, he divided his day into two, devoting the first part to prayer and the second to study and writing, and this remained his pattern for almost 50 years. He is said to have devoted eight hours a day to reciting prayer and receiving mass, while only allotting three hours each night for sleep.

Denis only twice left Roermond for a significant amount of time. For seven months in 1451 Denis accompanied Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa in an attempt to reform the Church in Germany and to preach a crusade against the Turks. In July 1466, was appointed to superintend the building of a monastery at Hertogenbosch. A three-year struggle against the difficulties of the new foundation broke down his health, already impaired by work and privations, and he was obliged to return to Roermond in 1469.

Posterity has surnamed him Doctor ecstaticus. Fundamental to Denis the Carthusian&#x27;s teachings is his theory on contemplation. He proposes a division of life and wisdom into three parts. In the purgative stage the Christian is occupied with overcoming sin and growing in virtue. This stage is associated with what he calls natural wisdom, naturally acquired. In the illuminative stage the Christian&#x27;s mind is occupied with the contemplation of divine things. The illuminative stage concerns what Denis calls supernatural wisdom, naturally acquired, also known as scholastic theology. In the Unitive stage he experiences a vehement love from his contemplation of the divine. This type of experience can only come from supernatural wisdom, supernaturally bestowed. Denis the Carthusian was said to have reached the Unitive stage, being privileged to divine ecstatic experiences lasting hours at a time. While still a novice he had ecstasies which lasted two or three hours, and later on they lasted sometimes seven hours and more. During his ecstasies many things were revealed to him which he made known only when it could profit others, and the same may be said of what he learnt from the souls in purgatory, who appeared to him very frequently. In physical austerities, he was assisted by a strong constitution, for he was a man of athletic build and had, as he said, &quot;an iron head and a brazen stomach&quot;.

During the last two years of his life he suffered intensely from paralysis, the stone, and other infirmities. He had been a monk for forty-eight years when he died at the age of sixty-nine.

Upon his remains being disinterred one hundred and thirty-seven years after, day for day (12 March 1608), his skull was said to have emitted a sweet perfume and the fingers he had most used in writing, i.e. the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, were apparently found in a perfect state of preservation. Although the cause of his beatification has never yet been introduced in accordance with the Carthusian tradition of not seeking such recognition, St. Francis de Sales, St. Alphonsus Liguori, and other writers style him &quot;Blessed&quot;; his life is in the Acta Sanctorum of the Bollandists (12 March), and his name is to be found in many martyrologies.

==Works==
The main contribution of Denis the Carthusian was to synthesize all previous doctrine on the spiritual life and then to make an evaluation of the various conclusions. He wrote over 150 works, now presented as 43 volumes, which include commentaries on the entire Bible and over 900 sermons. He began by commenting on the Psalms in 1434 and then went on to comment on the whole of the Old and the New Testament. After seeing one of his commentaries Pope Eugene IV exclaimed: &quot;Let Mother Church rejoice to have such a son!&quot;

He commented on also the works of Boethius, Peter Lombard, John Climacus, as well as those of, or attributed to, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. He also translated Cassian into easier Latin. He wrote theological treatises, such as his &quot;Summa Fidei Orthodoxæ&quot;; &quot;Compendium Theologicum&quot;, &quot;De Lumine Christianæ Theoriæ&quot;, &quot;De Laudibus B. V. Mariæ&quot;, and &quot;De Præconio B. V. Mariæ&quot; (in both of which treatises he upholds the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception), &quot;De quatuor Novissimis&quot;, etc.; philosophical treatises, such as his &quot;Compendium philosophicum&quot;, &quot;De venustate mundi et pulchritudine Dei&quot; (a most remarkable æsthetic dissertation), &quot;De ente et essentia&quot;, etc.; a great many treatises relating to morals, asceticism, church discipline, liturgy, etc.; sermons and homilies for all the Sundays and festivals of the year, etc.

As a theologian and a philosopher he belongs to no particular school. Although an admirer of Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas, he is neither an Aristotelian nor a Thomist in the usual sense of the words, but seems inclined rather to the Christian Platonism of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, St. Augustine, and St. Bonaventure. As a mystical writer he is akin to Hugh and Richard of St. Victor, St. Bonaventure, and the writers of the Windesheim School, and in his treatises may be found summed up the doctrine of the Fathers of the Church, especially of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and of Meister Eckhart, Henry Suso, John van Ruysbroeck, and other writers of the German and Flemish Schools.

He has been called the last of the Schoolmen. He is so in the sense that he is the last important Scholastic writer, and that his works may be considered to form a vast encyclopedia, a complete summary of the Scholastic teaching of the Middle Ages; this is their primary characteristic and their chief merit.

He was consulted as an oracle by men of different social standing, from bishops and princes downwards; they flocked to his cell, and letters came to him from all parts of the Netherlands and Germany. The topic of such correspondence was often the grievous state of the Church in Europe, i.e. the evils ensuing from relaxed morals and discipline and from the invasion of Islam. Soon after the Fall of Constantinople (1453), impressed by revelations God made to him concerning the terrific woes threatening Christendom, he wrote a letter to all the princes of Europe, urging them to amend their lives, to cease their dissensions, and to join in war against their common enemy, the Turks. A general council being in his eyes the only means of procuring serious reform, he exhorted all prelates and others to unite their efforts to bring it about.

He wrote also a series of treatises, laying down rules of Christian living for churchmen and for laymen of every rank and profession. &quot;De doctrina et regulis vitæ Christianæ&quot;, the most important of these treatises, was written at the request, and for the use, of the Franciscan preacher John Brugman. These and others which he wrote of a similar import, inveighing against the vices and abuses of the time, insisting on the need of a general reform, and showing how it was to be effected, give an insight into the customs, the state of society, and ecclesiastical life of that period.

His treatise &quot;De Meditatione&quot; was the last that he wrote, in 1469.

<text>Skjálfandi (; also known as Skjálfandaflói ) is a bay in northern Iceland, with some of the characteristics of a fjord. The Icelandic word &quot;Skjálfandi&quot; literally translates to &quot;trembling&quot; which may refer to earthquakes in the area.

The bay, originally created by glacial activity, has two major rivers flowing into it: Skjálfandafljót, which is a glacier river, and Laxá, which is a freshwater river. The river Laxá (&quot;Salmon River&quot;) is famous for its salmon and part of the river is protected by the Ramsar Convention.
The only town in Skjálfandi Bay is Húsavík, facing the snow-covered Víknafjöll and Kinnarfjöll mountain ranges on the other side of the bay. The highest point reaches around .

The bay is known for its many different whale, dolphin and bird species.

There are two islands in Skjálfandi. The larger one is Flatey (&quot;flat island&quot;). It is situated close to the opposite side of the bay from Húsavík. There is a village on the island, no longer inhabited, composed of a few houses, a school and a church. There is no ferry serving Flatey. Skjálfandi&#x27;s smaller island is called Lundey. Its name means &quot;island of the puffins&quot; because of the great colony of puffins living on its cliffs during the summer. Lundey is located north from Húsavík.

Garðar Svavarsson was one of the first Scandinavians to settle in Iceland, doing so around 860 CE. He built a house in Skjálfandi, but spent only the following winter months there before leaving Iceland. His slave Náttfari was left behind and continued to live on the farm but was chased away from it later by a Norse settler, forcing Náttfari to build a new farm on poorer land in Náttfaravík (; Old Norse: ) by Skjálfandi.

<text>Gangotri is a town and a &quot;Nagar Panchayat&quot; (municipality) in Uttarkashi district in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is 99 km from Uttarkashi, the main district headquarter. It is a Hindu pilgrim town on the banks of the river Bhagirathi – the origin of the river Ganges. The town is located on the Greater Himalayan Range, at a height of . According to a popular Hindu legend, the goddess Ganga descended here when Shiva released the mighty river from the locks of his hair.
== Significance ==

=== Ganga River ===
Gangotri is one of the four sites in the Chota Char Dham pilgrimage circuit. It is also the origin of the Ganges river and, per Hinduism, the seat of the goddess Ganga. The source of the Ganges river is the Bhagirathi River, originating from the Gangotri Glacier. Once the river confluences with the Alakananda River at a town called Devprayag it finally acquires the name &quot;Ganga&quot;.

Near the river is a stone where King Bhagiratha performed penance to Shiva in order to bring the Ganga down to earth and absolve the sins of his ancestors. According to another legend, Pandavas performed the great &#x27;Deva Yajna&#x27; here to atone the deaths of their kinsmen in the epic battle of the Mahabharata. Hindus believe that performing the ancestral rites on the banks of Bhagirathi frees the spirit of the ancestor from the cycle of rebirth and a holy dip in its waters cleanses sins committed in the present also past births.

=== Gangotri Temple ===
The original Gangotri Temple was built by the Nepalese general Amar Singh Thapa and later restored in the 19th century. The temple is closed from Diwali day every year and is reopened on Akshaya Tritiya. During this time, the idol of the goddess is kept at Mukhba village, near Harsil. Ritual duties of the temple are supervised by the Semwal family of pujaris. These pujaris hail from Mukhba village.

==Demographics==
According to the 2011 census of India, there are total 47 families residing in Gangotri. The total population of Gangotri is 110 out of which 97 are males and 13 are females. The literacy rate of Gangotri is 99.1%. The entire population of Gangotri identifies as Hindu.

<text>Badrinath is a town and nagar panchayat in Chamoli district in the state of Uttarakhand, India. It is a Hindu holy place, and is one of the four sites in India&#x27;s Char Dham pilgrimage. It is also part of India&#x27;s Chota Char Dham pilgrimage circuit and gets its name from the Badrinath Temple.
== Etymology ==
Badrinath derives from the Sanskrit compound Badarīnātha, consisting of the terms &quot;badarī&quot; (jujube tree) and &quot;nātha&quot; (lord), an epithet of Vishnu. It is also known as Badarikashrama.

==History==
In earlier days, pilgrims used to walk hundreds of miles to visit the Badrinath temple. The temple has been repeatedly destroyed by earthquakes and avalanches. As late as the First World War, the town consisted only of the 20-odd huts used by the temple&#x27;s staff, but the site drew thousands each year and up to 50,000 on its festivals (every twelve years). In recent years its popularity has increased still more, with an estimated 600,000 pilgrims visiting during the 2006 season, compared to 90,676 in 1961. The temple in Badrinath is also a sacred pilgrimage site for Vaishnavites. Badrinath is also gateway to several mountaineering expeditions headed to mountains like Nilkantha.

==Temple==
The Badrinath temple is the main attraction in the town. According to the legend, Adi Shankaracharya discovered a black stone image of Lord Badrinarayan made of Shaligram stone in the Alaknanda River. He originally enshrined it in a cave near the Tapt Kund hot springs. In the sixteenth century, the King of Garhwal moved the murti to the present temple. The temple is approximately 50 ft (15 m) tall with a small cupola on top, covered with a gold gilt roof. The facade is built of stone, with arched windows. A broad stairway leads up to a tall arched gateway, which is the main entrance. The architecture resembles a Buddhist vihara (temple), with the brightly painted facade also more typical of Buddhist temples. Just inside is the mandapa, a large pillared hall that leads to the garbha grha, or main shrine area. The walls and pillars of the mandapa are covered with intricate carving.

==Legend==
According to the Bhagavata Purana, &quot;There in Badrikashram, the supreme being (Vishnu), in his incarnation as the sages Nara and Narayana, had been undergoing great penance since time immemorial for the welfare of all living entities&quot; (Bhagavata Purana 3.4.22).

The Badrinath area is referred to as Badari or Badarikaashram (बदरिकाश्रम) in Hindu scriptures. It is a place sacred to Vishnu, particularly in Vishnu&#x27;s dual form of Nara-Narayana. Thus, in the Mahabharata, Krishna, addressing Arjuna, says, &quot;Thou wast Nara in a former body, and, with Narayana for thy companion, didst perform dreadful austerity at Badari for many myriads of years.&quot;

As per one legend, when the goddess Ganga was requested to descend on earth to help the suffering humanity at the request of Bhagiratha, the earth was unable to withstand the force of her descent. Therefore, the mighty Ganga (Ganges) was split into two holy channels, with Alaknanda as one of them.

Another lore states that the area was full of Badari, a wild berry. Vishnu meditated here and Lakshmi took the form of the Badari tree to provide shade for him from scorching sun.

The mountains around Badrinath are mentioned in the Mahabharata, when the Pandavas were said to have died one by one, when ascending the slopes of a peak in western Garhwal called Swargarohini (literal meaning - the &#x27;Ascent to Heaven&#x27;). The Pandavas passed through Badrinath and the town of Mana, 4 km north of Badrinath, on their way to Svarga (heaven). There is also a cave in Mana where Vyasa, according to the legend, wrote the Mahabharata.

The area around Badrinath was celebrated in Padma Purana as abounding in spiritual treasures.

This place is considered holy in Jainism as well. In Jainism, Himalaya is also called Ashtapad because of its eight different mountain range Gaurishankar, Kailash, Badrinath, Nanda, Drongiri, Nara-Narayana and Trishuli. Rishabhanatha attained Nirvana on Mount Kailash situated in the Himalayan range and according to Jain faith (Nirvankand), from Badrinath numerous Jain Muni got Moksha by doing Tapsya. According to Shrimadbhagwat, at this place Rishabhdev&#x27;s father Nabhirai and mother Marudevi had done hard Tapa after Rishabhdev&#x27;s Rajyabhishek and taken Samadhi. Even today footprint of Nabhirai at Neelkanth mountain attracts everybody towards him.

==Geography==

Badrinath has an average elevation of 3,100 metres (10,170 feet). It is in the Garhwal Himalayas, on the banks of the Alaknanda River. The town lies between the Nar and Narayana mountain ranges 9 km east of Nilkantha peak (6,596m). Badrinath is located 62 km northwest of Nanda Devi peak and 301 km north of Rishikesh. From Gaurikund (near Kedarnath) to Badrinath by road is 233 km.

According to the Köppen climate system, Badrinath&#x27;s climate is humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;) bordering a subtropical highland climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Demographics==
As of 2011 Indian Census, Badrinath had a total population of 2,438, of which 2,054 were males and 384 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 68. The total number of literates in Badrinath was 2,265, which constituted 92.9% of the population with male literacy of 95.4% and female literacy of 79.7%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Badrinath was 95.6%, of which male literacy rate was 97.1% and female literacy rate was 86.9%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 113 and 22 respectively. Badrinath had 850 households in 2011.

<text>Kedarnath is a town and Nagar Panchayat in Rudraprayag district of Uttarakhand, India, known primarily for the Kedarnath Temple. It is approximately 86.5 kilometres from Rudraprayag, the district headquarters. Kedarnath is the most remote of the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites. It is located in the Himalayas, about above sea level near the Chorabari Glacier, which is the source of the Mandakini River. The town is flanked by snow-capped peaks, most prominently the Kedarnath Mountain. The nearest road head is at Gaurikund about 16 km away. The town suffered extensive destruction during June 2013 from the Flash Floods caused by torrential rains in Uttarakhand state.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kedarnath&quot; means &quot;the Lord of the Field&quot;. It is derived from the Sanskrit words &quot;kedara&quot; (&quot;field&quot;) and &quot;natha&quot; (&quot;lord&quot;). The text &quot;Kashi Kedara Mahatmya&quot; states that it is so-called because &quot;the crop of liberation&quot; grows here.

== History ==
Kedarnath is a pilgrimage site or &quot;tirtha&quot; dedicated to the Hindu deity Shiva. It is one of the four pilgrimage spots that form a part of the Uttarkhand Char Dham yatra or Chota Char Dham yatra. The temple&#x27;s construction is credited to the Pandava brothers mentioned in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. However, the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; does not mention any place called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot; (c. 7th-8th century), which names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released the holy waters of Ganga from his matted hair, resulting in the formation of the Ganges River.

The Acharyas rebuilt the Kedarnath temple in Uttarakhand under the guidance of Adi Shankaracharya. According to the hagiographies based on Madhava&#x27;s &quot;Sankshepa-Shankara-Vijaya&quot;, the 8th-century philosopher Adi Shankaracharya died near the Kedarnath mountains; although other hagiographies, based on Anandagiri&#x27;s &quot;Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya&quot;, state that he died at Kanchipuram. The ruins of a monument marking the purported resting place of Adi Shankaracharya are located at Kedarnath. Kedarnath was a prominent pilgrimage centre by the 12th century when it is mentioned in &quot;Kritya-kalpataru&quot; written by the Gahadavala minister Bhatta Lakshmidhara.

==Location==

Kedarnath is located at a distance of 223 km from Rishikesh in Uttarakhand and close to the source of the Mandakini River at the height of above sea level. The township is built on a barren stretch of land on the shores of Mandakini River. Behind the town and the Kedarnath Temple, stands Kedarnath peak at , the Kedar Dome at and other peaks of the range.

==Demographics==
As of the 2011 India census, Kedarnath has a population of 830. Males constitute 99% of the population and females 1%. Kedarnath has an average literacy rate of 63%: male literacy is 63%, and female literacy is 36%. Out of total population, 604 were engaged in work or business activity. Of this 601 were males while 3 were females. In Kedarnath, none of the population is under six years of age. The floating population from May to October every year is more than 5000 per day with the pilgrim influx rising up to 10 lakhs in 2022.

==Climate==
The Kedarnath Temple is closed during the winter months due to heavy snowfall. For six months, from November to April, the palanquin with the Utsava Murti (Idol) of Kedarnath and of the Madhyamaheshwar Temple is brought to the Omkareshwar Temple in Ukhimath, near Guptakashi. Priests and other summer-time residents also move to nearby villages to cope with the winter. Around 360 families of the Tirtha Purohit of 55 villages and other nearby villages are dependent on the town for livelihood.
According to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system, Kedarnath&#x27;s climate is monsoon-influenced subarctic climate (&quot;Dwc&quot;), bordering a uniform rainfall subarctic climate (&quot;Dfc&quot;) with mild, rainy summers and cold, snowy winters.

===2013 flash floods===

On 16 June 2013, at approximately 7:30 P.M., a landslide occurred near the Kedarnath Temple. On 17 June 2013 at approximately 6:40 a.m., water began to rush down from the Chorabari Tal or Gandhi Sarovar, bringing along with its flow, a huge amount of silt, rocks, and boulders. A large boulder got stuck behind the Kedarnath Temple, protecting it from the flood. The floodwater gushed on both sides of the temple, destroying everything in its path. Since it occurred in the middle of the pilgrimage season, the torrential rains, cloud bursts, and resulting flash floods nearly destroyed the town of Kedarnath. Thousands of people were killed, and thousands of others (mostly pilgrims) were reported missing or stranded due to landslides around Kedarnath. Although the surrounding area and compound of the Kedarnath Temple were destroyed, the temple itself survived.

The rescue operation resulted in more than 100,000 people being airlifted with the help of mainly the Private Helicopter Operators, who began the rescue mission voluntarily without any clear directives from the State Government or the Ministry of Defence. The Indian Army and Indian Air Force helicopters arrived much after the Private Helicopter Operators had already begun the massive air-rescue mission. The NDRF represented by a commandant, and another junior officer arrived at the &#x27;right-ridge&#x27; of the town bordering the Mandakini River with more men and supplies being brought in the next day. The Indian Army later launched a massive rescue effort. A Eurocopter AS350 B3 helicopter, each, of the private helicopter operators - Prabhatam Aviation &amp; Simm Samm Aviation, were lost during the rescue mission without any reported casualties. An Indian Air Force helicopter (Mil Mi-17) also crashed, killing all 20 people on board (all of them were soldiers involved in relief and rescue work). The Air Force dropped logs to build pyres for mass cremations of the victims. It was reported that previously uncollected bodies were still being found one year after the tragedy.

=== Flood-proof infrastructure plan ===
After the floods, the Government of India decided to provide a flood-free infrastructure plan for the town. This involves:
* Development of the retaining wall and ghats on the Mandakini River
* Development of the retaining wall and ghats on the Sarasvati River
* Construction of the main approach to the Kedarnath Temple
* Development of the Adi Shankaracharya Kutir and Museum
* Development of houses for the Kedarnath Teerth Purohits

The foundation stone for the plan was laid by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 20 October 2017.

==Places of interest==
Other than the Kedarnath Temple, on the eastern side of the town is Bhairavnath Temple, and the deity of this temple, Bhairavnath, is believed to protect the town during the winter months.
About 6 km upstream from the town, lies Chorabari Tal, a lake cum glacier also called Gandhi Sarovar. Near Kedarnath, there is a cliff called Bhairav Jhamp. Other places of interest include the Kedarnath Wildlife Sanctuary, Adi Shankaracharya Samadhi, and Rudra meditation cave.

<text>The Broadkill River is a river flowing to Delaware Bay in southern Delaware in the United States. It is long and drains an area of on the Atlantic Coastal Plain.

The Broadkill flows for its entire length in eastern Sussex County. It issues from Wagamons Pond in the town of Milton; the pond is fed by two tributaries known as Ingram Branch and Pemberton Branch. From Milton, the Broadkill River flows generally eastwardly, passing through wetlands and salt marshes in the Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge. After approaching to within of Delaware Bay, the river parallels the shoreline a short distance inland for approximately before flowing into the bay in northwest of Lewes. The United States Coast Guard maintains a station near the mouth of the Broadkill at Green Hill. The mouth is connected to Rehoboth Bay by the Lewes and Rehoboth Canal, which forms part of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway.

In the 19th century the river was the center of a regional shipbuilding industry, arising from the access it furnished to inland forests; the industry fell into decline in the 1890s.

A footpath known as the Governors Walk follows the Broadkill in central Milton. The Nature Conservancy established a preserve along the river downstream of Milton in 1998. , an annual canoe and kayak race was being held on the river in Milton.

==Variant names and spellings==
The United States Board on Geographic Names issued an opinion clarifying &quot;Broadkill River&quot; as the stream&#x27;s name in 1961. According to the Geographic Names Information System, it has also been known historically as:
*Broad Creek 
*Broad Kill
*Broad Kill Creek 
*Broadkill Creek 
*Broadkiln Creek
*Lewis Creek

The amending Regulation (EU) 2015/759 of 29 April 2015 clarifies that heads of NSIs coordinate national level activities for European statistics and decide on processes, methods, standards and procedures of their respective statistics.

Previous Eurostat regulations were a Decision on Eurostat (2012/504/EU), and the earlier Decision on Eurostat (97/281/EC).

===General statistical activities===
General statistical activities related to the European Statistical system are:

* Statistical methodological coordination and research
* Statistical quality and reporting

===Geographical scope===
;EU data
Currently, and since Brexit on February the first 2020, Eurostat data are aggregated at the EU-27 level, known as EU-27.
Before Brexit Eurostat data was aggregated at the EU-28 level, known as EU-28.

Since Brexit occurred on February the first 2020, data has to be computed for the EU-27 because by definition Brexit makes the UK a third country to the EU.

Nonetheless, to avoid confusion with the previous EU-27 group of 27 member states — which was used in the series of statistical data before the accession of member state number 28 — another name for the current EU 27 without the UK is defined as EU27_2019 in February 2019 and EU27_2020 since March 2020 according to Eurostat.

The name changed from EU27_2019 to EU27_2020 due to a British constitutional delay which resulted in Brexit being delivered in 2020 rather than the initially planned 2019.

The concept of the EU 28 has been used since 1 January 2014, also according to the Eurostat methodological manual on city statistics, 2017 edition.

Local data are also computed at the NUTS level.

; Statistical cooperation in and around Europe
Eurostat is also engaged in cooperation with third countries through the European Statistical System, Enlargement Policy, and European Neighbourhood Policy.

In 2021, European Statistical System includes 4 EFTA countries, that is 3 EEA countries and Switzerland.

EU Enlargement Policy includes &quot;candidate countries&quot; in the process of joining the EU and other potential candidates.

In 2021, European Neighbourhood Policy covers 16 countries such as 6 ENP-East countries — Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine — and 10 ENP-South countries — Algeria, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Syria and Tunisia.

The trade and cooperation agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom — since 1 January 2021 — includes a provision on statistical cooperation that foresees the establishment of a specific future arrangement.

==Access to Eurostat statistics==
The most important statistics are made available via press releases. They are placed on the Eurostat website at 11:00 in the morning. This is also the time that the press release content may be distributed to the public by press agencies.

Eurostat disseminates its statistics free of charge via its Internet and its statistical databases that are accessible via the Internet. The statistics are hierarchically ordered in a navigation tree. Tables are distinguished from multi-dimensional datasets from which the statistics are extracted via an interactive tool.

In addition various printed publications are available either in electronic form free on the internet or in printed form via the EU Bookshop. Only larger publications are charged for as printed copies.

Since September 2009 Eurostat has pioneered a fully electronical way of publishing, Statistics Explained, like Wikipedia based on Mediawiki open source software and with a largely similar structure and navigation. Statistics Explained is not only a dissemination format, however, but also a wiki working platform for producing flagship publications like the Eurostat Yearbook.

==Statistical data for research purposes==
Microdata, which in principle allows the identification of the statistical unit (e.g., a person in the labour force survey or a company for innovation statistics), is treated as strictly confidential. Under tight security procedures various anonymised datasets are provided to research institutions for validated research projects.

==Location==
Eurostat has been based in the Joseph Bech building, in the northeast of the Kirchberg quarter of Luxembourg City, since the building was opened in 1998. The Directorate-General will relocate to the Jean Monnet 2 building, in the Kirchberg&#x27;s European district, following the completion of the first phase of the building, expected in February 2023.

<doc id="679521" wikidata="Q894902" url="?curid=679521" title="Bottom-up parsing">
<text>In computer science, parsing reveals the grammatical structure of linear input text, as a first step in working out its meaning. Bottom-up parsing recognizes the text&#x27;s lowest-level small details first, before its mid-level structures, and leaves the highest-level overall structure to last.

==Bottom-up versus top-down==

The bottom-up name comes from the concept of a parse tree, in which the most detailed parts are at the bottom of the upside-down tree, and larger structures composed from them are in successively higher layers, until at the top or &quot;root&quot; of the tree a single unit describes the entire input stream. A bottom-up parse discovers and processes that tree starting from the bottom left end, and incrementally works its way upwards and rightwards. A parser may act on the structure hierarchy&#x27;s low, mid, and highest levels without ever creating an actual data tree; the tree is then merely implicit in the parser&#x27;s actions. Bottom-up parsing patiently waits until it has scanned and parsed all parts of some construct before committing to what the combined construct is.

The opposite of this is top-down parsing, in which the input&#x27;s overall structure is decided (or guessed at) first, before dealing with mid-level parts, leaving completion of all lowest-level details to last. A top-down parser discovers and processes the hierarchical tree starting from the top, and incrementally works its way first downwards and then rightwards. Top-down parsing eagerly decides what a construct is much earlier, when it has only scanned the leftmost symbol of that construct and has not yet parsed any of its parts. Left corner parsing is a hybrid method that works bottom-up along the left edges of each subtree, and top-down on the rest of the parse tree.

If a language grammar has multiple rules that may start with the same leftmost symbols but have different endings, then that grammar can be efficiently handled by a deterministic bottom-up parse but cannot be handled top-down without guesswork and backtracking. So bottom-up parsers in practice handle a somewhat larger range of computer language grammars than deterministic top-down parsers do.

Bottom-up parsing is sometimes done by backtracking. But much more commonly, bottom-up parsing is done by a shift-reduce parser such as a LALR parser.

==Examples==

Some of the parsers that use bottom-up parsing include:
* Precedence parser
** Simple precedence parser
** Operator-precedence parser
* Bounded-context parser (BC)
* LR parser (Left-to-right, Rightmost derivation in reverse)
** Simple LR parser (SLR)
** LALR parser (Look-Ahead)
** Canonical LR parser (LR(1))
** GLR parser (Generalized)
* CYK parser (Cocke–Younger–Kasami)
* Recursive ascent parser
* Shift-reduce parser

<doc id="679530" wikidata="Q420837" url="?curid=679530" title="Firestone Tire and Rubber Company">
<text>Firestone Tire and Rubber Company is an American tire company founded by Harvey S. Firestone (18681938) in 1900 initially to supply solid rubber side-wire tires for fire apparatus, and later, pneumatic tires for wagons, buggies, and other forms of wheeled transportation common in the era. Firestone soon saw the huge potential for marketing tires for automobiles, and the company was a pioneer in the mass production of tires. Harvey S. Firestone had a friendship with Henry Ford, and used this to become the original equipment supplier of Ford Motor Company automobiles, and was also active in the replacement market.

In 1988, the company was sold to the Japanese Bridgestone Corporation.

==History==
===Early to mid 20th century===
Firestone was originally based in Akron, Ohio, also the hometown of its archrival, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, and two other midsized competitors, General Tire and Rubber Company and B.F. Goodrich Company. Founded on August 3, 1900, the company initiated operations with 12 employees. Together, Firestone and Goodyear were the largest suppliers of automotive tires in North America for over 75 years. In 1906, Henry Ford chose Firestone to supply tires for its car models.

In 1918, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of Canada was incorporated in Hamilton, Ontario, and the first Canadian-made tire rolled off the line on September 15, 1922. During the 1920s, Firestone produced the Oldfield tire, named for racing driver Barney Oldfield.

In 1926, the company opened one of the world&#x27;s largest rubber plantations, extending over , in Liberia, West Africa. That year the company also opened its first Firestone Tire and Service Center (later renamed Firestone Complete Auto Care). Firestone Complete Auto Care is the division of Firestone that offers automotive maintenance and repair, including tires.

In 1927, Henry Ford and Harvey S. Firestone visited Southern California to select locations for new factories. His friends said Ford wanted to be near the ocean and picked Long Beach and suggested Firestone locate in South Gate, California a small community southeast of downtown Los Angeles that at the time was mostly farmland. There Firestone identified of beanfields for the site of his new manufacturing plant. Architects Curlett and Beelman designed a spectacular four-story Italianatestyle complex, with its own power plant and decorated with polychrome murals by Gladding, McBean depicting the tire and rubber-making process. A year after the plant opened in 1928, it expanded to double the initial size, and by 1954 grew to nearly . The town grew around Firestone, its main boulevard was named after Harvey, and Los Angeles became the number one tire market in the country. By the mid-1970s, Ford and General Motors had massive layoffs as Firestone and other manufacturers opened new plants in nonunion locales like Wilson, North Carolina. After considerable downsizing, the South Gate plant was closed in 1980 and 1,300 workers were laid off. East Los Angeles College has proposed a new satellite campus at the site.

In 1928, the company built a factory in Brentford, England, a longtime Art Deco landmark on a major route into the city; this closed in 1979. After its purchase by Trafalgar House, the building was demolished during the August 1980 bank holiday weekend, reportedly in anticipation of its becoming listed.

In 1936, the company opened a plant in Memphis, Tennessee. With a work force exceeding 3,000 employees, the Memphis plant was the largest tire manufacturer in the company&#x27;s worldwide operation. On July 1, 1963, the company celebrated the production of 100 million tires in Memphis. The Memphis plant closed in 1982, and most of the plant buildings were demolished. The EPA considers the tract a brownfield site, and the possible presence of hazardous substances or contaminants have deterred its redevelopment.

During World War II, the company was called on by the U.S. Government to make artillery shells, aluminum kegs for food transport, and rubberized military products. Barrage balloons were produced at Akron. Firestone ranked 55th among U.S. corporations in the value of wartime military production contracts. In the 1940s, Firestone was given a defense contract to produce plastic helmet liners; while outproduced by Westinghouse Electric, they still made a fair amount for the M1 Helmet.

On September 2, 1940, William Hoppmann, the General Manager of Firestone&#x27;s Havana office was discharged from his position under the suspicion of being a Nazi agent.

On October 11, 1941, a fire at the Firestone Rubber and Latex plant in Fall River, Massachusetts destroyed 5 out of its 8 buildings and destroyed at least 15,000 tons of rubber. The fire caused $12 million in damage (equivalent to $ in ).
In 1951, Firestone was given the defense contract for the MGM-5 Corporal missile. Firestone was given a total of US$6,888,796 (equivalent to $ in ) for the first 200 units. Known as the &quot;Embryo of the Army,&quot; it was a surfacetosurface guided missile which could deliver a highexplosive warhead up to . It was later modified to be able to carry a nuclear payload for use in the event of Cold War hostilities in Eastern Europe. Built in southern California, this missile was replaced in 1962 by the MGM-29 Sergeant system.

In 1961, Firestone acquired the Dayton Tire division from the Dayco Corporation. Dayco later sued both Firestone and Goodyear, alleging that the two companies conspired to monopolize the tire industry in the United States. The United States District Court dismissed the lawsuit.

In 1965 Firestone acquired the Seiberling Rubber Company.

===Restructuring and sale to Bridgestone===

In late 1979, Firestone brought in John Nevin, the exhead of Zenith Electronics, as president to save the hemorrhaging company from total collapse. It was more than a billion dollars in debt at the time and losing $250 million a year (equivalent respectively to $ and $ in ). Nevin closed nine of the company&#x27;s seventeen manufacturing plants, including six in one day, and relocated the company from its ancestral home in Akron, Ohio to He spun off nontire related businesses, including the Firestone Country Club; it was considered a deliberate plan to boost the stock price, and it paid off.

In 1988, after discussions with Pirelli, Nevin negotiated the sale of the company to the Japanese company Bridgestone, which was able to buy the company for much less than it had been worth a decade and a half earlier. The companies celebrated the 20th anniversary of the merger in 2008, and changed the name of the tire division to Bridgestone Americas Tire Operations, LLC.

In 1972, Firestone received a tenyear import &quot;concession&quot; by the Kenyan government to secure Firestone&#x27;s investment in a domestic tire plant, which gave it a virtual monopoly. This included both general price and foreign exchange controls. When the tenyear period came to an end in 1979, Firestone retaliated by increasing production, making entry less attractive. Headquarters eventually canceled expansion and failed negotiations led to no further investments.

Bridgestone Americas, which has served as the American branch of Japanbased Bridgestone since 1992, moved their corporate office to downtown Nashville in October 2017.

In April 2012, Bridgestone Americas opened up its new &quot;Bridgestone Americas Technical Center&quot; in Akron, Ohio. The $100 million facility, located near the former headquarters, tire plant, and technical center, houses 450 employees whose jobs are to develop innovative and advanced tire technologies for the company.

In June 2022, Bridgestone opened up its $21 million &quot;Advanced Tire Production Center&quot; which replaced the &quot;Firestone Advance Tire Works Plant&quot; at the original Firestone Tire and Rubber Company headquarters which opened in 1910. The new building is home of the company&#x27;s racing tire production for the NTT IndyCar Series. The plant manufactures all Firestone Firehawk racing tires. It is the first new tire plant in the city of Akron in more than 70 years. Bridgestone also opened up a $6 million test track adjacent to the &quot;Advanced Tire Production Center&quot; to support passenger tire testing and development. The test track opened in autumn 2022. Bridgestone has invested more than $125 million in its Akron operations since 2012, when the company opened the Bridgestone Americas Technology Center.

==Firestone Complete Auto Care==
Firestone Complete Auto Care is a chain of automotive maintenance shops founded in Nashville, Tennessee in 1926.

There are over 2,300 Complete Auto Care locations in the United States, all of them independently owned by Firestone, with about 20 million customers each year as of 2002. At the start of 2022 Bridgestone, parent company of Firestone, announced that it will expand its hybrid and electric vehicular services

==Motorsports==

The Indianapolis 500 auto race was won in 1911 by a car running Firestone tires, as did all winners of the race from 1920 to 1966. The company also provided tires to NASCAR from 1948 to 1974, and to Formula One from 1950 to 1974. Citing rising costs as the cause, Firestone announced its withdrawal from professional motorsports in August 1974 with the exception of Formula 5000 and Formula One. The change was forecast to reduce Firestone&#x27;s annual race testing budget from between $6 and $8 million to around $500,000 (in , roughly equivalent to a reduction from $–$ to $.) Shortly afterward, Firestone extended this to a complete withdrawal by the end of the 1974 season. The manufacturer returned in 1995 to the CART Series with technical assistance from Bridgestone. Firestone has been the sole supplier of tires for the IndyCar Series since 2000 and will run until the 2030 season.

== Corporate troubles ==

===Great American streetcar scandal===
In 1950, Firestone along with General Motors and Standard Oil, were charged and convicted of criminal conspiracy for their part in the Great American streetcar scandal. The scandal included purchasing streetcar systems throughout the United States and dismantling and replacing them with buses.

=== Firestone 500 tread separation problem ===
Radial tires were introduced to the U.S. market by rivals B.F. Goodrich and Michelin in the late 1960s, and Firestone lacked their own radial tire. The first radial tire developed and produced by Firestone was the illfated Firestone 500 radial. Manufacturing of the new tire was performed on equipment designed to manufacture biasply tires.

During the 1970s, Firestone experienced major problems with the Firestone 500 radial. The Firestone 500 steelbelted radials began to show signs of separation of the tread at high speeds. While the cause was never proved, it is believed that the failure of bonding cements, used by Firestone to hold the tread to the tire carcass, may have allowed water to penetrate the tire, which in turn may have caused the internal steel wire to corrode. In March 1978, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced publicly a formal investigation into defects of the Firestone 500. The NHTSA investigation found that the tread separation problem was most probably a design defect affecting all Firestone 500s.

In 1973, only two years after the 500&#x27;s debut, Thomas A. Robertson, Firestone&#x27;s director of development, wrote an internal memo stating &quot;We are making an inferior quality radial tire which will subject us to beltedge separation at high mileage&quot;. Firestone introduced strict quality control measures in an attempt to fix the inherent problems, however they were not successful in eliminating the basic faults. In 1977 a recall of 400,000 tires produced at the problematic Decatur, Illinois plant was initiated. Firestone blamed the problems on the consumer, stating underinflation and poor maintenance.

On October 20, 1978, Firestone recalled over 7 million Firestone 500 tires, the largest tire recall to date. Congressional hearings into the 500 also took place in 1978. The tire was found to be defective and the cause of 250 deaths. In May 1980 after finding that they knew the tires were defective, the NHTSA fined Firestone $500,000 (equivalent to $ in ), which at that time was the largest fine imposed on any U.S. corporation and the largest civil penalty imposed since passage of the 1966 National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Act. Multiple lawsuits were settled out of court and the constant negative publicity crippled the company&#x27;s sales and share price.

Harvard Business School and Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania taught classes and wrote papers on the issues of misjudgments and poor decision-making by the management of Firestone. After years of bad publicity and millions paid out in compensation to victims, Firestone was losing vast amounts of money, and its name was severely damaged.

=== Liberian rubber plantation ===

Firestone established the Firestone Natural Rubber plantation in Harbel, Liberia in 1926. From 1926 until the outbreak of the First Liberian Civil War in 1990, the Firestone Natural Rubber Company was the largest plantation of its kind in the world. It was originally envisioned for 350,000 people to be employed on the newly created plantations. However this was more than the number of ablebodied men in the entire nation at the time, which created intense pressure for labor. In the period between 1926 and 1946 Christine Whyte concluded that: The collusion between Firestone and government officials to keep wages low and coerce workers onto the plantations was at best substantially overlooked, at worst regarded as a form of &quot;development&quot; in itself.

In September 1990, rebel NPFL forces (led by Charles Taylor, who would later be convicted of war crimes) executed sitting Liberian president Samuel Doe and seized the Harbel plantation. Firestone had to evacuate its American workers as a result. In June 1991, Firestone sent a delegation to Monrovia in an attempt to restart operations in Harbel. After a month of waiting, the delegation was brought to meet Taylor, and after a further six months of negotiations the company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Patriotic Reconstruction Assembly Government&#x27;s Ministry of Finance in January 1992. This MOU provided for taxes to be paid by Firestone to the Taylor government, and for the Taylor government to provide protection to Firestone&#x27;s employees and assets in Liberia. Firestone resumed operations in March 1992, but once again had to halt in October that same year as hostilities escalated. Over this period, the company had paid $2.3 million in taxes to the Taylor government (equivalent to $ in ), which some say helped legitimize Taylor&#x27;s Greater Liberia government and finance and enable its attack on ECOMOG controlled Monrovia. Operations did not fully restart until 2003 at the conclusion of the Second Liberian Civil War. Since the end of the war, Firestone has invested over $100 million in restoring and rebuilding its facilities in Liberia.

The company&#x27;s ventures in Liberia have been the subject of considerable scrutiny and criticism, including a 2005 Alien Tort Claims Act case brought in California by the International Labor Rights Fund and a 2014 investigative report by ProPublica entitled &quot;Firestone and the Warlord&quot;, and a PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary by the same name.

=== Ford Explorer rollover problem ===
In 1996, several state agencies in Arizona began experiencing major issues with Firestone tires on Ford Explorers. According to news reports, various agencies demanded new tires, and Firestone conducted an investigation of the complaints, tested the tires and tried to assert that the tires had been abused or underinflated.

On September 6, 2000, in a statement before the U.S. Senate Appropriations Transportation subcommittee the president of the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, Joan Claybrook, stated:

The report went on to indicate that Ford also had been complicit, stating that The Ford Motor Company had instructed Firestone to add a nylon ply to the tires it manufactured in Venezuela for additional strength and that Ford had made suspension changes to the Explorer model available in Venezuela. Ford did not specify adding the nylon ply for U.S.made Firestone tires nor did it change the Explorer suspension on U.S. models at this time.

An abnormally high failure rate in Firestone&#x27;s Wilderness AT, Firestone ATX, and ATX II tires resulted in multiple lawsuits, as well as an eventual mandatory recall. In 2001 Bridgestone/Firestone severed its ties to Ford citing a lack of trust. The lack of trust stemmed from concerns that Ford had not heeded warnings by Bridgestone/Firestone relating to the design of the Ford Explorer. In 2006, Firestone announced renewed efforts to recall tires of the same model recalled in 2000 after the tires were linked to recent deaths and injuries. According to Firestone&#x27;s last filing with the National Highway Transportation Administration, only 90,259 of more than 2.5 million recalled tires were confirmed as removed from service. In November 2013, two recalled Wilderness AT tires were found in Atlanta, Georgia. One of the tires was offered for sale as new at a used tire retail shop.

Some outside observers have speculated about the blame worthiness of both parties. Firestone tires being prone to tread separation and failure, and the SUVs being especially prone to rolling over if a tire fails at speed compared to other vehicles. A subsequent NHTSA investigation of real world accident data showed that the Ford Explorer SUVs in question were no more likely to roll over after a tread separation than any other SUV.

Labour economists Alan Krueger and Alexandre Mas concluded that one of the main reasons for the high defect rate of Firestone tires was linked to a dispute between the unions and Firestone at the Decatur plant 19941996. They find that the tires manufactured at the plant in question around this time featured substantially increased defect rates, rising with the onset of the dispute and subsiding when the dispute was finally settled at the end of 1996. Other similar plants of Firestone did not report similar increases in the defect rate in this period.

==Television advertisement jingle==
&quot;Where the Rubber Meets the Road&quot; is an advertisement jingle that was frequently used in the 1960s and 1970s, especially on televised sporting events.
The jingle was sung by Don Rondo.

:Wherever wheels are turning,
:No matter what the load,
:The name that&#x27;s known is &quot;Firestone&quot;
:Where the rubber meets the road.

==Other brands==
Bridgestone/Firestone also produces tires under the Fuzion brand name. Fuzion is a tire manufactured in China for Bridgestone/ Firestone as a budget replacement tire.

Makes include the Fuzion UHP Sport A/S, SUV, and Touring.

<text>Ahmet Emuukha Rodan Zappa (born May 15, 1974) is an American musician and writer, and trustee of the Zappa Family Trust.

==Early life==
Ahmet Zappa was born in Los Angeles, California, the third of four children born to musician Frank Zappa and businesswoman Gail Zappa. His father was of Sicilian, Greek, Arab, and French descent, and his mother was of German and Portuguese ancestry. He is said to be named after music executive Ahmet Ertegun (co-founder and president of Atlantic Records), whom his father greatly admired. This is contradicted by Neil Slaven in &quot;Electric Don Quixote: The Definitive Story Of Frank Zappa&quot;, who notes:

His older brother and sister are Dweezil Zappa and Moon Zappa, and his younger sister is Diva Zappa.

==Career==
Ahmet Zappa has released several albums with his brother Dweezil, and wrote the song &quot;Frogs with Dirty Little Lips&quot; with his father.

He has appeared in several feature films and television programs. In the late 1990s, he appeared on Channel 4 UK&#x27;s &quot;The Adam and Joe Show&quot;, in a regular segment called &quot;Vinyl Justice&quot;, in which hosts Adam Buxton and Joe Cornish, dressed as policemen, examined his vinyl collection for &quot;criminal records&quot;. In 2000, he appeared in the film &quot;Ready to Rumble&quot;. With his brother Dweezil, he performed a cover of Britney Spears&#x27; song &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Other appearances include hosting the TV shows &quot;Robotica&quot; and &quot;But Can They Sing?&quot;.

In July 2006, Zappa saw the release of his debut novel, entitled &quot;The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless&quot;, aimed at younger readers. The rights to a movie were purchased by Bruckheimer Films and Disney. The movie is in production with screenwriter Tim Firth assisting; no release date has been announced.

On October 19, 2006, The Jim Henson Company announced it had hired Zappa to write a treatment for a feature film version of the hit 1980s television show &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;. He is also writing a sequel to &quot;The Monstrous Memoirs of a Mighty McFearless&quot;, which had also been optioned to adapt to a screenplay. Zappa proposed to Disney&#x27;s studio head Bob Iger that the company form a graphic novel-to-film division; the result was &quot;Disney&#x27;s Kingdom Comics.&quot; Zappa was also given a first-look deal at Walt Disney Studios for motion picture productions. His company is called Monsterfoot Productions. His first film, &quot;The Odd Life of Timothy Green&quot;, was released in 2012 by Walt Disney Pictures, and starred Jennifer Garner and Joel Edgerton.

Following the death of Zappa&#x27;s mother, Gail, in October 2015, it was revealed that Ahmet and his sister Diva were given control of the Zappa Family Trust with shares of 30% each, while his siblings Moon and Dweezil were given smaller shares of 20% each. As beneficiaries only, Moon and Dweezil will not see any money from the trust until it is profitable—in 2016, it was &quot;millions of dollars in debt&quot;—and must seek permission from Ahmet, the trustee, to make money from their father&#x27;s music or merchandise bearing his name. The uneven divide of the trust has resulted in several conflicts between Zappa&#x27;s children, including a feud between Dweezil and Ahmet over Dweezil&#x27;s use of his father&#x27;s music in live performances.

Under Ahmet&#x27;s direction, the trust proposed a trademark on the name &quot;Zappa&quot;, which would prevent Dweezil from using the name for commercial purposes without authorization. Since 2006, Dweezil toured with an act called Zappa Plays Zappa, playing his father&#x27;s music. The trust sought to collect a fee from Dweezil for continued use of the name, as well as proceeds from merchandise sold at Zappa Plays Zappa concerts. In response to the trust&#x27;s action, Dweezil renamed his performance series &quot;50 Years of Frank: Dweezil Zappa Plays Whatever the F@%k He Wants—the Cease and Desist Tour.&quot; In more recent times, the Zappa siblings have legally reconciled their differences with Dweezil noting &quot;It may be a bumpy road at times – we are a passionate Italian family – but we have decided to work toward privately discussing issues rather than using public forums and lawyers.&quot;

==Personal life==
Zappa married actress Selma Blair on January 24, 2004, at Carrie Fisher&#x27;s mansion in Beverly Hills, California. Blair filed for divorce at the Los Angeles Superior Court on June 21, 2006, citing irreconcilable differences.

Zappa is now married to Shana Muldoon. Together they have one daughter and one son.

<text>The 
World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the governing body for professional snooker, first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Before this, the defending champion was seeded first, and the previous year&#x27;s runner-up second, for each tournament.

For the 1977–78 season, players&#x27; performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1975, 1976, and 1977) contributed to their points total. For each of the three years, the World Champion was awarded five points, the runner-up received four, losing semi-finalists got three, players eliminated in the quarter-finals gained two, and losers in the last-16 round received a single point. If players were level on points, then those gained in the most recent event determined positioning. If this was still equal, then the losing margin on was taken into account.

Ray Reardon retained top place in the rankings from the 1976/1977 listing, with 12 points. John Spencer, the 1977 World Champion, was second, six places higher than in the previous season&#x27;s list, on 9 points. Doug Mountjoy, at 14th, was the highest-ranked one-season professional. The eight highest-ranked players were placed directly into the last-16 round of the 1978 World Snooker Championship, whilst all other entrants were required to participate in a qualifying competition to produce the eight players to play the exempted seeds. As defending champion, Spencer was seeded first for the 1978 tournament, with the other seeds based on the rankings.

==Rankings==

The professional world rankings for the snooker players on the main tour in the 1977–78 season are listed below. Points gained in each of the three World Snooker Championships are shown, with the total number of points given in the last column. A &quot;–&quot; symbol indicates that the player did not participate in that year&#x27;s championship. Some sources show Mans as placed 9th and Davis 10th, and Thorne 18th with Virgo 20th. It is unclear why three players with 0 points were included in the rankings.

<doc id="679550" wikidata="Q1277286" url="?curid=679550" title="Eddie Charlton">
<text>Edward Francis Charlton, (31 October 1929 – 7 November 2004) was an Australian professional snooker and billiards player. He remains the only player to have been world championship runner-up in both snooker and billiards without winning either title. He later became a successful marketer of sporting goods, launching a popular brand of billiard room equipment bearing his name.

==Early life==
Charlton was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia and came from a sporting family. His grandfather ran a billiards club in Swansea, New South Wales, and Charlton began playing cue sports when he was nine years old. At the age of eleven, he defeated fellow Australian Walter Lindrum in a wartime snooker exhibition match, and he made his first century break when he was seventeen.

He was involved in numerous other sports during his youth: he was a first-grade footballer and played in the Australian First Division Football (soccer) for ten years; he was a champion surfer, and played state-level rugby league and competitive cricket; he also excelled in speed roller skating, rowing, boxing and tennis. In 1956, he was chosen to carry the Olympic torch on part of its journey to the Melbourne Games.

Charlton worked as a coal miner until the age of 31. After winning four amateur snooker titles, he decided to turn professional in 1963 on the advice of Fred Davis. His brother Jim was also a professional snooker player but never joined the world ranks.

==Career==
Charlton became a professional player in 1963 at the age of 34 and won his first Australian Professional Championship the following season. For the next ten years he won the title annually and made at least the semi-finals in every subsequent meeting through its last edition in 1988. He unsuccessfully challenged Rex Williams for the World Billiards Championship title in 1974 and 1976. His third appearance was in 1984 when he lost by a handful of points to Mark Wildman. Four years later, he lost to two-time champion Norman Dagley in his last World Billiards final.

Charlton was the most successful Australian snooker player until the emergence of Neil Robertson. From the first year of the snooker world rankings in 1976/77, he was ranked number three in the world for the next five consecutive seasons.

Charlton, who was known for his focused and dogged performances, challenged for the World Championship in 1968 and was the runner-up in the final of the World Championship in 1973 and 1975, losing the 1975 world final by just one frame (30–31) to Ray Reardon. He won the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Pot Black&quot; competition in 1972, 1973 and 1980. He also recorded the first century break (110) on &quot;Pot Black&quot;.

In the final of the 1973 World Snooker Championship, played as the best-of-75-frames, Charlton led Ray Reardon 10–5 and 12–10, before the pair were on level terms at both 12–12 and 13–13. Reardon moved into a 17–13 lead, and was 27–25 up after seven sessions of play. At the start of the eighth session, Reardon was affected by the bright lighting that had been installed for the purposes of television coverage, and he lost the first three frames. He complained about the lighting, and two large lights that were focused on the audience were switched off. From 27–28 behind, Reardon won four of the next five frames in the session, and sustained the momentum for an eventual 38–32 victory. According to snooker historian Clive Everton, &quot;Charlton&#x27;s dogged consistency proved no match for Reardon&#x27;s flair and wider range of shots.&quot;

Charlton faced Reardon in the final of the 1975 World Snooker Championship in a match of 61 frames. Reardon led 16–8, but Charlton then won the next nine frames to take the lead. Reardon was ahead at 22–20, but Charlton won nine of the following ten frames to lead 29–23. Reardon produced a seven-frame winning streak to leave himself needing one further frame at 30–29, then Charlton won the 60th frame. In the , Reardon made a 62 break, and secured his victory at 31–30.

He reached the final of the 1991 World Seniors Championship and was a frame away from clinching the title when he led Cliff Wilson 4–2. According to the match report in &quot;Snooker Scene&quot; magazine, Charlton then &quot;started to falter in a fashion all too familiar with his failures on the brink of other world titles&quot;, and he lost 4-5.

His last major achievement at the World Championship was his 10–9 first round win over Cliff Thorburn at the 1989 World Championship. He qualified for the 1990 and 1991 World Championships but lost in the first round on both occasions. Charlton&#x27;s final appearance at the Crucible came in 1992, where he was defeated 10–0 by defending champion John Parrott in the first round, the only recorded in the World Championship until 2019.

Charlton was known for playing with a very straight cue action and rarely hitting the ball with any , when a less conservative approach might have paid dividends. In retirement from professional snooker Charlton often commentated during the BBC&#x27;s world championship coverage.

==Personal life==
Always active in the organisation and promotion of the game, Charlton was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in 1980.

<text>Wilhelm Karmann GmbH, commonly known as Karmann, was a German automobile manufacturer and contract manufacturer based in Osnabrück, Germany. Founded by Wilhelm Karmann in 1901, the company specialised in various automotive roles, including design, production and assembly of components for a wide variety of automobile manufacturers, including Chrysler, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen Group.

The company was broken up in 2010, after filing for bankruptcy the previous year. Its convertible roof components were purchased by Webasto, Magna Steyr and Valmet Automotive, while the Osnabrück assembly plant, vehicle development, tools and assembly systems were transferred to Volkswagen.

==History==

Karmann was established in 1901 when Wilhelm Karmann purchased Klages, a coachbuilder founded in 1874, and renamed the business. The company then grew together with the expanding automobile industry. Karmann became known for its work on convertibles, coupés, and other niche models.

After World War II and the reconstruction of the plant destroyed in the war, Karmann turned its focus on contract manufacturing and development for Volkswagen. As early as 1935/36, Ferdinand Porsche had asked Karmann to investigate the possibilities of developing a prototype for a Volkswagen convertible. The chaos of the war prevented the idea from being pushed forward, as well as the cooperation with Volkswagen from starting 15 years earlier. On 1 August 1949, Wilhelm Karmann signed an order from Volkswagen for 1,000 &quot;four-seater, four-wing convertible Type 15&quot; - the Volkswagen Beetle Cabriolet. Over the next 50 years, a total of 2,548,765 Beetle Cabriolets would be produced for Volkswagen.

In addition to the Beetle Cabriolet and Karmann Ghia, all cabriolet variants of the VW Golf as well as the Scirocco, and Corrado were built by Karmann. The 1960s saw the expansion of the company and further vehicle plants were set up in São Bernardo do Campo (Brazil) and Rheine. In the years after 1965, complete vehicles and bodies of the BMW New Class Coupé, and its successor, the larger E9, were produced in Rheine. Installation of the engine and final assembly were handled by BMW at the Munich plant. Karmann also built complete cars for Porsche to increase production of the 912 and 911 models. In 1969 they started to manufacture the Porsche 914 and all four cylinder cars were made by them. In the late 1970s and 1980s, Karmann produced the body shell of the BMW 6 Series Coupé and the convertible models of the Ford Escort as complete vehicles. From the beginning of the 1990s, the Ford Escort RS Cosworth, European-market Kia Sportages and from 1997 the Audi Cabriolet (type 89) and the Audi A4 Cabriolet (from 2002), as well as the Chrysler Crossfire (2003) and Mercedes-Benz CLK Cabriolet (A209, 2003) were produced as complete vehicles. Production of VW&#x27;s Vento/Jetta (1992/93) and the Golf Variant A3 (1997/99) also shifted from Volkswagen in Wolfsburg to Karmann in Osnabrück.

From 1985 to 1989, Karmann produced the Merkur XR4Ti (an American-market version of the Ford Sierra for the Merkur brand); and from 2003 to 2007, the Chrysler Crossfire coupe and convertible for Chrysler, at the time DaimlerChrysler. Many Karmann-built vehicles feature a small wagon wheel emblem, the coat of arms of Osnabrück, where the company was founded. A large part of the development of the Crossfire was done independently by Karmann, and the vehicle was produced at their Osnabrück facility. Karmann U.S. also supplied the top sub-assemblies for the convertible variants of both the third-generation Chrysler Sebring and Ford Mustang.

Karmann assembled complete knock down (CKD) kits in an agreement with American Motors (AMC). In 1968, AMC introduced the Javelin, a new competitor in the U.S. &quot;pony car&quot; segment. AMC did not have a manufacturing subsidiary in Europe, therefore, Karmann assembled the American-designed car for distribution in Europe. Karmann built the cars in Rheine with V8 engines. About 90% of the necessary components were shipped by boat from the U.S. All were SST trim versions and their name, Javelin 79-K stood for AMC&#x27;s &quot;79&quot; model number and the &quot;K&quot; for Karmann.

A small number of vehicles were also produced in Brazil (São Bernardo do Campo). The Osnabrück facility also produced the chassis and body panels of the Spyker C8 Spyder.

The production facilities in Osnabrück, Chorzów, Poland, Yokohama, Japan, Sunderland, UK, Puebla, Mexico, and Plymouth Township, U.S. manufactured roof systems for convertibles including the Mercedes-Benz CLK, the Renault Mégane CC, the Nissan Micra C+C, the Pontiac G6, the Chrysler Sebring, the Ford Mustang, the Bentley Continental, the BMW 1 Series, and the Volkswagen New Beetle Cabriolet.

=== The Karmann Ghia ===
The VW Karmann Ghia Type 14 is Karmann&#x27;s best-known vehicle. Wilhelm Karmann Jr. conceived the idea in 1953, one year after taking over his father&#x27;s car body company in Osnabrück. Karmann wanted to produce a sporty and open two-seater on the technical basis of the VW Beetle. Volkswagen was also interested in a sporty roadster that would be loved by American soldiers stationed in Europe and taken to the USA.

Luigi Segre, the boss of Carrozzeria Ghia in Turin, was included in the plan on the occasion of the Geneva Automobile Salon. A chassis of the beetle was shipped from Osnabrück to Italy and Segre put a self-designed body on the chassis. To Karmann&#x27;s amazement, Segre presented him in Paris not a roadster, but a coupé.

Shortly afterwards, the automobile artwork was presented to the VW General Director back in Osnabrück. VW boss Heinrich Nordhoff liked the coupé with its flowing lines and rounded shapes, so he agreed to build the car on the same day. In the first year of production, a total of 10,000 coupés were delivered instead of the planned 3,000 units.

The VW Karmann Ghia became a sales success with over 360,000 units, even if the performance of the car with only 30 HP and 115 km/h top speed did not correspond to the sporty appearance. 1957 followed the Karmann Ghia Cabriolet and 1961 the bigger Type 34, the Karmann Ghia 1550, the design of which also came from Carrozzeria Ghia.

In the quantities produced by Karmann, the Karmann Ghia coupés and convertibles were later slightly surpassed by both the Golf Cabriolet and the Scirocco; only when the first Karmann Ghia types were added together via the coupé and convertible was the Karmann Ghia the most successful Karmann vehicle.

Since its beginning in 1901, Karmann built more than three million complete vehicles of the models as follows, exceptions as indicated:

===Motorhomes===
The first Karmann motorhomes were launched in 1974 based on the Volkswagen Type 2 &#x27;Bay Window&#x27; chassis. The bodies were of a sandwich structure. These motorhomes had two beds, kitchen, shower, waste water tank, rear body supports, leisure battery, toilet, water heater and gas heating. Options included the luggage rack over the driver&#x27;s cab. Approximately 1,000 units were produced through 1979.

With the introduction of the Volkswagen T2/3 - also known as the (T3/Vanagon/Transporter/T25) in 1979, the motorhomes received a permanent overhead area with a bed for two people. Called Karmann Gipsy, 741 were made between 1980 and 1992. This number excludes 30 or more Type 3 Syncro models made between 1986 and 1989, and 7 Syncro 16&quot; models made between 1991 and 1992. In addition 113 Cheetah T2/3&#x27;s were manufactured between 1986 and 1990 to make a total 891 Volkswagen T3 Karmann Coachbuilt Motorhomes - all produced in Karmann Rheine factory and not at Osnabruck as commonly believed.

From 1978 to 1996, a total of 3,103 Volkswagen LT-based models were produced. These included the LT &quot;M&quot;, LT &quot;L 1&quot;, LT &quot;L 2&quot;, LT &quot;L Distance Wide&quot;, LT &quot;L Distance-Wide Gold&quot;, LT &quot;H Distance-Wide&quot;, LT &quot;H Distance-Wide Gold&quot;, LT &quot;S Distance-Wide&quot; and the top-of-the-line LT &quot;Distance-Wide Autovilla&quot;.

In 1991, the Karmann motorhome design was updated and based on the Volkswagen T4. The Gipsy and Cheetah models names were retained in the form of the Gipsy I (SWB) and Cheetah (LWB). In 1996 two new models were introduced namely the Colorado and Missouri. The Volkswagen Transporter (T5)-based versions were introduced in 2003.

==Insolvency proceedings==
On 8 April 2009, Karmann filed for insolvency proceedings due to the sharp decline in demand for cars, and the company&#x27;s financial obligations. The employment protection contracts of the large OEMs with the unions and the technological progress in vehicle construction led to the fact that the production of niche vehicles was no longer outsourced, but rather carried out within the OEM production network. Volkswagen, Karmann&#x27;s longtime partner, revealed on 24 October that it had made an offer to acquire the company.

On 20 November, Volkswagen took over the factory buildings, machinery, plant and land from the Karmann insolvent estate. With the exception of roof systems, Volkswagen Osnabrück encompasses former Karmann divisions: production systems (metal group), press shop, body shop, paint shop, assembly and technical development.

On 4 November 2010, Finland&#x27;s Valmet Automotive signed an agreement to buy Karmann&#x27;s roof-component sections in Osnabrück and Żary, Poland. Karmann&#x27;s North American operations were sold in August 2010 to Webasto Group. Effective 25 February 2010, the Japanese production site of Karmann was acquired by Magna International. Magna Steyr also manufactured the roof system for the Infiniti G37 Convertible in addition to the roof system for the Nissan 370Z Roadster.

== Production after 2010 ==
The Volkswagen-owned operations have produced the following:

<text>Alfredo Sinclair (8 December 1914 – 2 February 2014) was a Panamanian artist. He was born in Panama City. He studied with Humberto Ivaldi at the National School of Painting and later in Argentina, between 1947 and 1951. 

He had his first contact with the painting in the studio of painter Humberto Ivaldy. He studied painting at the School of Fine Arts in Buenos Aires, Argentina between 1947 and 1951, under the tutelage of Jorge Soto Acebal. He taught drawing and painting at the School of Architecture and was a founder of the School of Fine Arts at the University of Panama. Since 1950 he has been conducting various art exhibitions in Panama and around the world. 

As a painter he worked light in collage and mixed media applied by bright colors. He entered the figurative but was known as the father of abstract painting in Panama. He began his career using semi-abstract references to urban congestion, as well as fish, insects and other animals. In the 1970s he changed his style to one of almost complete abstraction, with evocative paintings of biblical tables or walls cave paintings. Later, he took as a resource the faces of children, becoming an essential feature of his works.

He was named &quot;Exemplary Citizen of Panama&quot; by civic clubs in 1986. In 1991 he received the Order Vasco Nunez de Balboa in rank of Commander. In 2000 he received the Award in the Arts Excellencies, by the Museum of Contemporary Art. In 2004 he received the Medal Andrés Bello Convention, the first Panamanian to receive such an award.
In spite of the fact that the Panamanian public did not understand much of his art, in 1955 he was awarded a prize for a piece that included bits of glass. With the passage of time Sinclair&#x27;s painting followed the lines of a lyrical abstraction that went from collages to soft and luminous compositions. One of his most famous works is &quot;Mancha&quot;. Sinclair died on 2 February 2014 from heart failure at the age of 99. His daughter Olga Sinclair is also a renowned Panamanian artist.

<doc id="679559" wikidata="Q4602997" url="?curid=679559" title="2003–2004 Liberal Party of Canada infighting">
<text>The period between Paul Martin&#x27;s assumption of the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada (November 14, 2003) and the announcement of the 2004 federal election (May 23, 2004) saw a considerable amount of infighting within the party. The divisions in the Liberal Party, the party&#x27;s embroilment in the Sponsorship Scandal, and a united Conservative opposition, all combined to end 12 years of Liberal rule in the 2006 federal election.

==1990 Convention==
Jean Chrétien and Martin squared off in the 1990 leadership convention after Turner announced his pending resignation.

The Meech Lake Accord had been a potentially divisive issue for the Liberals. Trudeau came out of retirement to campaign against the Accord, while Turner and Martin declared their support for it. While Turner had privately opposed many of Trudeau&#x27;s policies while in Cabinet, Meech Lake was seen as one of the signs of open disagreement among both factions.

Chrétien himself said that he never forgave Martin for some of the &quot;wounds&quot; that the latter inflicted; the most notable was during a leadership debate when Martin supporters shouted &quot;vendu&quot;, a French insult meaning sellout.

Although Chrétien won on the first ballot, Martin had a strong second-place showing, which allowed him to force concessions. Martin played a major role in drafting policy during the 1993 federal election. The Liberals, as it turned out, won a landslide majority government, and Martin was appointed to the key post of Minister of Finance.

==Chrétien government==
The Liberals were re-elected with a razor-thin majority in the 1997 campaign, although they were still by far the largest party in the House of Commons. Several MPs such as Reg Alcock had opposed the timing of the vote, in wake of the devastating Red River Flood in Manitoba. Others felt that it was too early to call an election, since the government had only been in power for three and a half years, and the resulting drop in Liberal support likely undermined confidence in Chrétien&#x27;s leadership of the party.

Rumours of a division between Chrétien and Martin intensified around the 2000 election, with Martin&#x27;s supporters wanting to take over before the campaign. However, the party managed to win almost as many seats as in 1993 (at the expense of all the other political parties) persuading Chrétien to stay on. Around this time, Martin had worked throughout this time to position himself as the clear successor to Chrétien, ensuring that most of the institutions of the Liberal Party were controlled by his allies.

===Chrétien-Martin split===
The dispute between the two men came to a head in the summer of 2002, when Chrétien tried to curtail Martin&#x27;s open campaigning for the leadership. What ensued is of some debate. Martin claims that he was fired from cabinet by Chrétien, which is what was widely reported in the media, while Chrétien claims that Martin had resigned. In either case, Martin&#x27;s departure from cabinet aided his leadership campaign since he did not have to disclose donors, unlike Martin&#x27;s rivals (John Manley, Allan Rock, and Sheila Copps) who were still in cabinet and were thus obliged to follow the rules. Martin&#x27;s influence and the backlash from his dismissal compelled Chrétien to set a date for his retirement. After Martin&#x27;s dismissal/resignation, he toured the country campaigning for the leadership while his Liberal organizers prepared to challenge Chrétien during a review vote in January 2003. During the fall, Chrétien announced that he would step down in February 2004 after less than half of caucus agreed to sign a commitment supporting him.

Shortly before Chrétien stepped down, Parliament passed a law that banned parties from accepting campaign contributions from corporations, as well as granting parties a subsidy based on their share of popular vote from the most recent election. While viewed positively among the public as an electoral reform after some early revelations of the sponsorship scandal, Bill C-24 was opposed by many of his own MPs who saw it as a poison pill since it effectively cut off the main source of funding for the Liberals; they had enjoyed the majority of company donations for the last decade due to a fragmented opposition. Party president Stephen LeDrew famously derided Bill C-24 as &quot;dumb as a bag of hammers&quot;. While the opposition parties were well poised to reap the benefits of Bill C-24 due to their established grassroots fund raising, the Liberals were caught unprepared for this change. This would hamper them in the 2004 and 2006 campaigns, leaving them in heavy debt.

==Martin&#x27;s Cabinet==
In November 2003, Martin was elected as Liberal leader by capturing 3,242 of 3,455 delegates. He had won the leadership almost unopposed, due to his hold on the party machinery, and because Chrétien supporters did not rally around either of Martin&#x27;s leadership opponents (with Martin&#x27;s large lead, even most Chrétien supporters grudgingly voted for Martin). Potential contenders Brian Tobin and Allan Rock never formally entered the race, while John Manley dropped out and Sheila Copps received at most marginal support. Martin was sworn in as Prime Minister in December.

While the issue of the party leadership was settled, at the lower levels unprecedented intraparty warfare began. Martin replaced half of Chrétien&#x27;s ministers, one of the largest cabinet turnovers in Canadian history for a ruling party undergoing a leadership change. Ministers such as John Manley, Allan Rock, Don Boudria, David Collenette, and Sheila Copps, who had played key roles during Chrétien&#x27;s decade in power, were reduced to minor roles or compelled to take patronage appointments, and many of them decided to retire from politics.

Besides excluding experienced Chrétien supporters from cabinet, Martin also outraged many of them by guaranteeing his star candidates powerful cabinet posts, despite many being newcomers to federal politics.

Several Chrétien loyalists wanted to remain as backbenchers. In some cases, they were defeated in the riding nomination process, with widespread allegations of tampering by Martin supporters. Unlike in previous elections, incumbent Liberals were not automatically granted their local nomination.

==Sponsorship Scandal==
Chrétien&#x27;s supporters have suggested that Martin had used the sponsorship scandal as a pretense to remove many Chrétien supporters, such as André Ouellet, Alfonso Gagliano, and Jean Pelletier, from their positions in government, crown corporations, and the party. The Chrétien camp contends that the Gomery commission was set up to make them look bad, and that it was not a fair investigation. The scandal also cast skepticism on Martin&#x27;s cabinet appointments, prompting speculation Martin was simply ridding the government of Chrétien&#x27;s supporters to distance the Liberals from the scandal.

The first volume of the Gomery Report, released on November 1, 2005, cleared Martin of any wrongdoing while placing blame for the scandal on Chrétien. However, many have criticized the Gomery Inquiry as not having the scope to assign criminal responsibility for the Scandal or to investigate Martin&#x27;s role, and indeed some have accused Martin of purposely &quot;tying Gomery&#x27;s hands.&quot; While the Gomery Report: Phase 1 exonerated Martin from responsibility and liability for the misspending of public funds, Chrétien has decided to take an action in Federal Court to review the commission report on the grounds that Gomery showed a &quot;reasonable apprehension of bias&quot;, and that some conclusions didn&#x27;t have an &quot;evidentiary&quot; basis.

The controversy over responsibility for Chrétien&#x27;s legal fees also proved another potentially divisive issue. Many of Martin&#x27;s ministers wanted to deny Chrétien and his supporters further federal aid, as it would be criticized by opposition parties and the public alike, though such a position would anger many Chrétien loyalists.

Outgoing minister Reg Alcock did approve a payment of up to $40,000 to assist Jean Pelletier with legal fees in a court challenge against the Gomery Commission after the Liberals were defeated in the 2006 federal election. Representatives of other parties criticized this payment, though Pelletier&#x27;s lawyer argued that it followed a long-standing government policy for high-ranking functionaries in judicial proceedings.

==Public==
Formally, Chrétien and Martin have remained publicly respectful of each other; while much of the verbal sparring was between their supporters. After being dismissed or resigning from cabinet, Martin did not comment on the government, as he was focused upon leadership campaigning. At the November 2003 Liberal leadership convention, Chrétien pledged that he would help Martin to win the Liberals&#x27; fourth consecutive majority government, while Martin said that many of his initiatives as Finance Minister were credited to Chrétien&#x27;s support.

At the 2006 leadership convention in Montreal, Martin&#x27;s final speech as outgoing leader paid tribute to Chrétien, but the latter was not present for the event.

==Nomination battles==
In Canadian federal politics, would-be electoral candidates will generally seek the nomination of their chosen party within the local constituency. The nominee is chosen by members of the party within the constituency, and consequently the candidates attempt to sign up as many new members as possible to support them prior to the nomination meeting. In previous elections, incumbent Liberal Members of Parliament (MPs) were protected from nomination challenges; this rule was not applied in 2004, especially towards Chrétien supporters. Martin claimed that he wanted to make the process more democratic, but he was heavily criticized when he overruled the new process to parachute in his handpicked star candidates, often against the wishes of the local riding association.

The highest profile battle was in the riding of Hamilton East—Stoney Creek between former Deputy Prime Minister and leadership candidate Sheila Copps and Martin loyalist and newly appointed Minister of Transport Tony Valeri. Copps had been one of the most noted representatives of the party&#x27;s left wing for over two decades, dating to the party&#x27;s nadir in the mid-1980s. However, Elections Canada had merged her riding with Valeri&#x27;s in a way that slightly favoured Valeri. Copps lost the nomination battle, which she blamed on dirty tricks.

In several ridings, the nomination battles resulted in the splitting of the Liberal vote, as disgruntled party members supported the Conservatives, NDP or Bloc, costing the Liberals several otherwise safe seats.

Other battles happened across the country:
*Charles Caccia, the longest serving MP, was forced out by Martin loyalist Mario Silva; Caccia initially planned to run as an independent candidate against Silva, but bowed out of the race before the election because his candidacy may have split the Liberal vote.
*In the merged riding of Mississauga—Erindale, Chrétien loyalist Steve Mahoney lost to supposed Martinite Carolyn Parrish. Parrish, contrary to what many believed was &quot;not&quot; a staunch Martin supporter; Mahoney had initially supported Martin but later opposed the backroom campaigning. He was rewarded with a junior cabinet post near the end of Chrétien&#x27;s tenure, severing his relations with the Martin camp who then rallied to Parrish&#x27;s cause. Parrish&#x27;s anti-US comments endured her to Muslims in her riding, while the Jewish community supported Mahoney. Parrish was later kicked out of the Liberal caucus for further anti-US remarks and she did not seek re-election in 2006.
*In Ottawa Centre, Penny Collenette chose to not run for the Liberal Party nomination. Martin advisor Richard Mahoney won the nomination and went on to lose to former NDP leader Ed Broadbent.
*Ottawa South opponents of David McGuinty, brother of Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty, were allegedly given only three days to recruit voters. This proved less controversial since outgoing MP John Manley was a close friend of Premier McGuinty.
*Incumbent Eugène Bellemare lost the Ottawa—Orléans nomination to Marc Godbout. Godbout won the general election but was defeated in his 2006 reelection bid.
*Incumbent Ivan Grose lost the Oshawa nomination to Louise Parkes. Parkes finished third, behind eventual winner Conservative Colin Carrie and the NDP&#x27;s Sid Ryan
*In the merged riding of Welland, Tony Tirabassi was defeated by John Maloney.
*In Burnaby—Douglas, Martin supporter Bill Cunningham, a former president of the Liberal Party of Canada (British Columbia), was directly appointed by the party leader without allowing a vote; the entire riding association executive resigned in protest. Cunningham was defeated by NDP&#x27;s Bill Siksay.
*Steven Hogue, a Chrétien supporter, was disallowed from running in Chrétien&#x27;s former riding of Saint-Maurice—Champlain purportedly because Martin wanted women to be nominated in winnable ridings in Quebec. Martin&#x27;s Quebec lieutenant Jean Lapierre described Hogue as not being a &quot;loyal Liberal&quot;. The eventual nominee, Marie-Eve Bilodeau, received support from Chrétien, in one of his few campaign appearances, but Bilodeau was defeated by the Bloc.
*Lisette Lepage was forced to run in a stronghold of the &quot;Bloc Québécois&quot;, Charlevoix—Montmorency, because she (as well as two other women) were denied the chance to run in the safe Liberal riding of Beauport as it was reserved for Martin loyalist and former MP Dennis Dawson. Dawson was defeated by a two to one margin.
*Robert Bertrand who lost to David Smith in the Pontiac riding.
*After Martin appointed Ruby Dhalla over local candidates in Brampton—Springdale, the Liberal riding association decided to back New Democratic Party candidate Kathy Pounder.
*In Charleswood—St. James—Assiniboia, Martin star-candidate and former Winnipeg mayor Glen Murray was defeated by Conservative Steven Fletcher following the resignation of the popular Liberal MP John Harvard. Harvard was persuaded to step aside and was appointed lieutenant-governor of Manitoba.

<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the governing body for professional snooker, first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Before this, the defending champion was seeded first, and the previous year&#x27;s runner-up second, for each tournament.

For the 1978–79 season, players&#x27; performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1976, 1977, and 1978) contributed to their points total. For each of the three years, the World Champion was awarded five points, the runner-up received four, losing semi-finalists got three, players eliminated in the quarter-finals gained two, and losers in the last-16 round received a single point. If players were level on points, then those gained in the most recent event determined positioning. If this was still equal, then the losing margin on was taken into account.

Ray Reardon retained top place in the rankings from the 1977/1978 listing, with 12 points. Perrie Mans, the 1978 World Championship runner-up, was second, eight places higher than in the previous season&#x27;s list, on 8 points. Eddie Charlton, who retained third place from the previous year&#x27;s rankings, and John Spencer, who dropped from second to fourth, also had 8 points. The eight highest-ranked players were placed directly into the last-16 round of the 1979 World Snooker Championship, whilst all other entrants were required to participate in a qualifying competition to produce the eight players to play the exempted seeds.

<text>Shape tables are a feature of the Apple II ROMs which allows for manipulation of small images encoded as a series of vectors. An image (or &quot;shape&quot;) can be drawn in the high-resolution graphics mode—with scaling and rotation—via software routines in the ROM. Shape tables are supported via Applesoft BASIC and from machine code in the &quot;Programmer&#x27;s Aid&quot; package that was bundled with the original Integer BASIC ROMs for that computer.

Applesoft&#x27;s high-resolution graphics routines were not optimized for speed, so shape tables were not typically used for performance-critical software such as games, which were typically written in assembly language and used pre-shifted bitmap shapes. Shape tables were used primarily for static shapes and sometimes for fancy text; Beagle Bros offered a number of fonts in &quot;Font Mechanic&quot; as Applesoft shape tables.

==Technical details==
The vectors of a two-dimensional graphic, each encoding a direction from the previous pixel along with a flag indicating whether the new pixel should be illuminated or not, were encoded up to three in a byte. These were stored in a table via the Monitor or the codice_1 command. From there, the graphic could be referenced by number (a table could contain up to 255 shapes), and built-in Applesoft routines permitted scaling, rotating, and drawing or erasing the shape. An XOR mode was also available to allow the shape to be visible on any color background; this had the advantage, also, of allowing the shape to be easily erased by redrawing it.

Apple did not provide any utilities for creating shape tables; they had to be created by hand, usually by plotting on graph paper, then calculating the hexadecimal values and entering them into the computer. Beagle Bros created a shape table editing program, which eliminated the &quot;number crunching&quot;, called &quot;Apple Mechanic&quot;, and a related program, &quot;Font Mechanic&quot;.

<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Before this, for each tournament the defending champion was seeded first, and the previous year&#x27;s runner-up second.

For the 1979/1980 ranking list, players&#x27; performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1977, 1978 and 1979) contributed to their points total. For each of the three years, the World Champion gained five points, the runner-up received four, losing semi-finalists got three, losing quarter-finalists got two, and losers in the last-16 round received a single point. Ray Reardon retained top place in the rankings from the 1978/1979 listing, with 12 points.

The day following the 1979 World Championship, on 29 April, the WPBSA voted that only two players would receive direct entry into the last 16 of the 1980 World Championship: the 1979 champion Terry Griffiths and runner-up Dennis Taylor. This resolution was poorly received by the BBC, who televised the championship, and by tournament sponsors Embassy; both organisations were concerned that star players could be eliminated before the televised stage. The Professional Snooker Association (PSA), formed soon after the meeting, challenged the decision. The PSA included many leading players, and had Reardon, John Spencer and snooker agent Del Simmonds as directors. According to Griffiths, both he and Taylor joined the PSA in &quot;solidarity&quot;. Within weeks, the next meeting of the WPBSA voted to revert to the previous system, where the top eight players in the rankings were exempted to the last 16 of the world championship, and the players ranked nine to 16 would each be exempted to the first round (last 24) where they would each face a player from the qualifying competition. At the meeting which backed reverting to the previous system for the world championship, the WPBSA also determined that the world champion would be the top seed for the UK Championship, with the defending UK champion as second seed. A subsequent WPBSA decision to seed all players for the 1979 UK Championship except the world champion based on the results from the 1977 and 1978 UK championships was reversed at the request of the tournament sponsors, Coral.

<doc id="679577" wikidata="Q180008" url="?curid=679577" title="Canadian Bacon">
<text>Canadian Bacon is a 1995 comedy film written, produced, and directed by Michael Moore which satirizes Canada–United States relations along the Canada–United States border. The film stars an ensemble cast featuring Alan Alda, John Candy (in his final film role), Bill Nunn, Kevin J. O&#x27;Connor, Rhea Perlman, Kevin Pollak, G. D. Spradlin, and Rip Torn. It tells the story of a struggling President who is persuaded by his confidants to fight with Canada when a local sheriff and his friends get involved.

The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, and was the final film released starring John Candy, though it was shot before the earlier-released &quot;Wagons East&quot; as both films are dedicated in memory of him. It is also Moore&#x27;s only non-documentary film to date.

==Plot==
In Niagara Falls, New York, thousands of former employees are outraged with military businessman R. J. Hacker having closed down his weapons manufacturing plant, Hacker Dynamics. Local sheriff Bud Boomer and his deputy/girlfriend Honey then prevent the despondent former Hacker employee Roy Boy from committing suicide at Niagara Falls.

At a conference held at Hacker Dynamics, Hacker pins the blame for the shutdown of his business on the President of the United States, who has just arrived. The President defends his own belief that the future of the children is more important than war which has caused major decline in his approval rating.

After the press conference where Boomer saved the President from an assassination attempt, the President confides in General Dick Panzer and National Security Advisor Stuart Smiley (who is revealed to have ties with Hacker) that he&#x27;s unhappy about not having an enemy to engage with. An attempted negotiation with Russian President Vladimir Kruschkin to start a new cold war with Russia fails and the President&#x27;s suggestion of a war on international terrorism is deemed too absurd.

Later that night, Boomer offensively criticizes Canadian beer while attending a hockey game with Honey, Roy Boy, and deputy sheriff Kabral Jabar between the neighboring nations in Niagara Falls, Ontario causing a brawl to break out. The ensuing riot ends up on the news the next day and catches Stuart&#x27;s attention which led to everyone getting detained overnight. In turn, Stuart collects more information about Canada from a CIA agent named Gus and suggests Canada as their new enemy during a cabinet meeting.

Before long, U.S. television channels are littered with anti-Canada propaganda which Boomer believes wholeheartedly. He prepares for war by distributing guns to his fellow sheriffs, Honey, Roy Boy, and Kabral. He also helps form a local militia. After they apprehend a group of Americans &quot;dressed as Canadians&quot; attempting to destroy a hydroelectric plant despite Gus&#x27;s protests that they are just Americans, they sneak across the border to litter on Canadian lands which leads to Honey being left behind and arrested by the Mounties. In a rescue attempt, Boomer, Roy Boy, and Kabral sneak into a Canadian power plant and cause a countrywide blackout. When the President learns of this, Stuart orders the Omega Force to remove Boomer from Canada before it is too late as Boomer gets separated from Kabral and Roy Boy.

Seeking revenge on the President for shutting down his business, Hacker uses a software program (&quot;Hacker Hellstorm&quot;) to activate missile silos across the country. The President learns that the signal causing the activation of the silos originated from Canada. As Stuart tells the President that the information is classified, the President summons Hacker for some answers. Hacker offers to sell a program to the President that can cancel out the Hellstorm—for $1 trillion. Fed up with the President being too busy to give Hacker the money, Stuart realizes that a departing Hacker is the one controlling the silos, not Canada. After storming up, Stuart takes the operating codes from him required to stop the Hellstorm while accidentally killing Hacker in the process. The still busy President orders Stuart&#x27;s arrest despite his protests that he is now able to give the codes to the President so they could deactivate the missiles which are aimed at Moscow. As the US government loses contact with Omega Force and as the launch time approaches, the President pleads with Canadian Prime Minister Clark MacDonald over the phone to stop the launch.

Meanwhile, Honey was taken to a hospital upon her capture and escaped all the way to the CN Tower. She discovers the central computer for the Hellstorm and destroys it with a machine gun, aborting the launch sequence. Honey then reunites with Boomer and they return to the United States on a speedboat. Before the final shot of Boomer and Honey&#x27;s speedboat unknowingly heading towards the waterfall is shown, an epilogue reveals the characters&#x27; fates:

* Boomer realizes his dream of appearing on &quot;Cops&quot;.
* Honey is named &quot;Humanitarian of the Year&quot; by the National Rifle Association of America.
* The President was defeated in the next election by a landslide and now hosts &quot;Get Up, Cleveland&quot;.
* Stuart served eight months in prison, but was pardoned by the new President Oliver North.
* General Panzer committed suicide by gunshot after learning that &quot;Hogan&#x27;s Heroes&quot; was fictional.
* Hacker&#x27;s body has been viewed daily at the Republican National Headquarters from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM.
* Gus was last spotted heading to Mexico in a tank.
* Kabral has become a hockey star, winning the Hart Memorial Trophy three years in a row. It was then shown that it was ironically for the Toronto Maple Leafs as his hockey card shows him playing for them.
* Roy Boy&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown.
* MacDonald is &quot;still ruling with an iron fist&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
Moore was inspired by the pro-war sentiment and 90% approval rating for President George H. W. Bush at the time of the Gulf War and wondered if the president could gain public support for war on any country, even Canada.

The film was shot in fall 1993, in Toronto, Hamilton, and Niagara Falls, Ontario; and Buffalo and Niagara Falls, New York. Scenes depicting the rapids of the Niagara River were actually filmed at Twelve Mile Creek in St. Catharines. Parkwood Estate in Oshawa was the site for the White House, and Dofasco in Hamilton was the site for Hacker Dynamics. The scene where the American characters look longingly home at the US across the putative Niagara River is them looking across Burlington Bay at Stelco steelworks in Hamilton, Ontario.

The hockey game and riot were shot at the Niagara Falls Memorial Arena in Niagara Falls, Ontario, and the actors portraying the police officers (who eventually join in the riot upon hearing &quot;Canadian beer sucks&quot;) are wearing authentic Niagara Regional Police uniforms.

Originally, PolyGram Filmed Entertainment had arranged for the film to be released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in the fall of 1994. However, PolyGram later started its own distribution company, Gramercy Pictures, with Universal Pictures in the summer of 1993, and battled with MGM to get the distribution rights back from them. Gramercy ultimately gave the film a limited release in 1995 before essentially taking it straight to video. Today, MGM now owns the film through their acquisition of the pre-1996 PolyGram library.

The film has numerous cameos by Canadian actors, including Dan Aykroyd, who appears uncredited as an Ontario Provincial Police officer who pulls Candy over (not for the crude anti-Canadian graffiti on his truck, but its lack of a French translation; Boomer dutifully sprays his truck in French graffiti). Moore himself appears as an American gun nut. Cameo pictures of Canadian-American American actors in Propaganda are Michael J. Fox; Lorne Greene and Alex Trebek.

==Reception==
&quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; received unfavorable reviews by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 17% based on reviews from 18 critics.

&quot;The A.V. Club&quot;&#x27;s Nathan Rabin in a 2009 review concluded, &quot;After generating solid laughs during its first hour, &quot;Canadian Bacon&quot; falls apart in its third act,&quot; lamenting the film &quot;was perceived as too lowbrow for the highbrows, and too highbrow for the lowbrows.&quot;

<text>David Taylor (born 29 July 1943) is an English former professional snooker player. He won the English Amateur Championship 11–6 against Chris Ross in 1968 and the 1968 World Amateur Snooker Championship 8–7 against Max Williams later that year. Those wins encouraged him to turn professional. He was nicknamed &quot;The Silver Fox&quot; because of his prematurely grey hair.

Taylor reached three major professional finals, the 1978 UK Championship, 1981 Yamaha Organs Trophy and the 1982 Jameson International, but lost them all. Together with his team-mates Steve Davis and John Spencer, he won the 1981 World Team Classic, representing England. His best performance at the World Snooker Championship was in 1980 event, when he reached the semi-finals. He was also a losing quarter-finals in three editions. Taylor was a member of the elite top 16 of the world rankings for ten consecutive years until the 1985–86 snooker season, reaching a high of number 7 in the 1981–82 season.

==Early life and career==
David Taylor was born on 29 July 1943 in Bowdon, Greater Manchester, and grew up in Manchester. He started playing snooker aged 14. He had been banned from fencing at a local youth club for dangerous behaviour and looking for an alternative pastime, he played on the smaller-scale tables there before moving on to use full-size tables. After leaving school, he took up a career as a hairdresser.

In 1968 he defeated Chris Ross 11–6 to win the English Amateur Championship. At the 1968 World Amateur Snooker Championship in Australia he won all four of his group matches, then beat Paddy Morgan in the semi-final before securing the title with an 8–7 victory against Max Williams. He also recorded the highest of the tournament, 96. He turned professional on his return to the UK. Alongside his snooker career, he changed profession from hairdresser to swimming coach to allow more time for snooker practice. There were few professional tournaments in the early 1970s, and Taylor accepted an offer to play exhibition matches at holiday camps.

In his first world championship match, at the 1970 event, he finished the first day of his match against Bernard Bennett 3–4 behind, but progressed to the quarter-finals by securing a winning margin at 11–8. A match report in &quot;Billiards and Snooker&quot; magazine was critical of the standard of play by both players, and in particular about Taylor &quot;carelessly&quot; missing s. Facing John Pulman, Tayor was on level terms at 12–12, but Pulman proceeded to win 31–20. In 1971 he lost 2–5 against reigning world champion John Spencer for the Stratford Professional title. He was seeded into the quarter-finals of the 1972 World Championship and lost 25–31 to Eddie Charlton.

In 1978, Taylor and fellow professional players John Virgo and Jim Meadowcroft were featured discussing their careers in the television programme &quot;This England&quot;. Taylor was a commentator when Steve Davis made the first televised maximum break at the 1982 Lada Classic. He appeared in &quot;Pro-celebrity Snooker&quot;, partnering Mike Burton (1980), Brian Close (1981), Duggie Brown (1983), and Bill Maynard (1984). In the 1990s he featured several times on the snooker-themed game show &quot;Big Break&quot;.

==Professional finals and later career==
Taylor reached three major professional finals, but lost them all. His first major final was the 1978 UK Championship, where after progressing past Maurice Parkin, he eliminated defending champion Patsy Fagan 9–7. He then defeated both Virgo and Alex Higgins, but in the final against Doug Mountjoy he lost ten of the last twelve s as Mountjoy won 15–9. He lost 6–9 to Davis in the 1981 Yamaha Organs Trophy final after winning four consecutive frames from 2–8 behind. Earlier in the tournament he had topped the round-robin group that also included Ray Reardon, Mountjoy and Graham Miles, then defeated Kirk Stevens 5–3 in the semi-finals. After the tournament, he commented that he felt like he had been a professional player &quot;in name only until 1977&quot; but could now go on to win a title. In 1978 he made three consecutive s of 130, 140 and 139 Butlin&#x27;s Minehead, an achievement that was recognised in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. By 1980 he was known as &quot;The Silver Fox&quot; because of his prematurely grey hair, the nickname having been coined by commentator Ted Lowe.

He was a member of the England team that won the 1981 World Team Classic, alongside Davis and Spencer. In the group match against Australia, Taylor lost against Morgan and Ian Anderson, and against Northern Ireland he lost against Higgins but defeated Tommy Murphy. England won both group matches by four matches to three, and progresses. In the semi-finals, he defeated Bill Werbeniuk 2–1 but then lost to Stevens by the same margin, and England won by four matches to two. Although Taylor lost both of his matches in the final, 1–2 against Terry Griffiths and 0–2 to Mountjoy, England took the title when Davis won the tiebreak match against Reardon leaving the score at four matches to three.

In the 1982 Jameson International final, he was 3–5 behind Knowles after the first , after the pair had been level at 2–2. Knowles compiled a break of 114, the highest of the tournament, to win the ninth frame, before Taylor claimed the next two frames to leave Knowles one ahead at 6–5. Breaks of 63 and 43 in the next two frames saw Knowles restore a three-frame advantage. Taylor made a break of 74 to win the 14th frame, but Knowles secured his first major title by claiming the 15th frame with a break of 76. It was the first tournament apart from the World Snooker Championship to count in the snooker world rankings. In the quarter-finals of this event Taylor beat the then World Champion, Steve Davis 5–3.

Taylor was a member of the elite Top 16 World Rankings for ten consecutive years until the 1985–86 snooker season, reaching a high of number 7 in the 1981–82 season. His best performance in the World Championship was at the 1980 event, when he lost to Cliff Thorburn 7–16 in the semi-final having beaten the six-time World Champion Reardon 13–11 in the quarter-final. He also reached the World Championship quarter-finals in 1981 and the quarter-finals at the 1981 International Open and the 1987 British Open.

In the 1988–89 snooker season, the WPBSA held three non-ranking tournaments for players who has been eliminated in the early rounds of specific ranking events. Taylor won the third of these, defeating Craig Edwards, Martin Smith, Jon Wright, and David Roe to reach the final against Steve Meakin, who Taylor beat 9–1 to win the title. At the end of the 1996–97 snooker season he was ranked 151st, and therefore did not qualify to automatically continue as a professional. In January 1998 he was co-opted as a board member of the WPBSA, but he lost his place in elections in December that year.

Taylor played at the 2000 World Seniors Masters and defeated Miles in the single-frame format competition, before losing to Willie Thorne in the semi-finals. He entered the 2010 World Snooker Championship qualifying rounds, aged 66 and playing in first competitive match for 13 years, but lost 1–5 to Paul Wykes.

Virgo wrote that &quot;Taylor, in practice, was one of the best players I&#x27;d ever seen, second perhaps only to [Alex] Higgins.&quot; Thorburn commented that Taylor did not seem able to bring his ability in practice into tournament play, and that he probably overthought during matches. Reardon made a similar observation, saying that although Taylor &quot;look[ed] so good in practice&quot;, he failed to match him nickname: &quot;A fox is a hungry, crafty fighter, but David displays little of those characteristics.&quot;

==Outside snooker==
Taylor had two sons from his first marriage to Francine. As of 1984 he was married to Janice, who he met at a holiday camp in the early 1970s and had a two-year-old son with her. In 1981, after he had earned the largest prize money of his career to date, £5000 for reaching the final of the Yamaha Organs Trophy, he told Alexander Clyde of &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; that he was grateful for the encouragement and support that Janice had provided for his career and that for an earlier period of about three years they had lived almost entirely from her income.

Taylor had entered the property business using money from a winning bet on John Spencer to win the world championship. Soon after he had made his last appearance in the televised stages of the world championship in 1987, Taylor and his wife decided to purchase a guest house in Little Bollington near Altrincham in Cheshire. They were still running the business as of 2021 He had the table used for the 1987 Masters installed at the premises for his use.

<doc id="679582" wikidata="Q107410" url="?curid=679582" title="Hypocenter">
<text>A hypocenter or hypocentre (), also called ground zero or surface zero, is the point on the Earth&#x27;s surface directly below a nuclear explosion, meteor air burst, or other mid-air explosion. In seismology, the hypocenter of an earthquake is its point of origin below ground; a synonym is the focus of an earthquake.

Generally, the terms &quot;ground zero&quot; and &quot;surface zero&quot; are also used in relation to epidemics, and other disasters to mark the point of the most severe damage or destruction. The term is distinguished from the term zero point in that the latter can also be located in the air, underground, or underwater.

==Trinity, Hiroshima and Nagasaki==
The term &quot;ground zero&quot; originally referred to the hypocenter of the Trinity test in Jornada del Muerto desert near Socorro, New Mexico, and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. The United States Strategic Bombing Survey of the atomic attacks, released in June 1946, used the term liberally, defining it as:

William Laurence, an embedded reporter with the Manhattan Project, reported that &quot;Zero&quot; was &quot;the code name given to the spot chosen for the [Trinity] test&quot; in 1945.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, citing the use of the term in a 1946 &quot;New York Times&quot; report on the destroyed city of Hiroshima, defines &quot;ground zero&quot; as &quot;that part of the ground situated immediately under an exploding bomb, especially an atomic one.&quot;
The term was military slang, used at the Trinity site where the weapon tower for the first nuclear weapon was at &quot;point zero&quot;, and moved into general use very shortly after the end of World War II. At Hiroshima, the hypocenter of the attack was Shima Hospital, approximately away from the intended aiming point at Aioi Bridge.

==The Pentagon==

During the Cold War, the Pentagon (headquarters of United States Department of Defense in Arlington County, Virginia) was an assured target in the event of nuclear war. The open space in the center of the Pentagon became known informally as ground zero. A snack bar that used to be located at the center of this open space was nicknamed &quot;Cafe Ground Zero&quot;.

==World Trade Center==
During the September 11 attacks in 2001, two aircraft were hijacked by 10 al-Qaeda terrorists and were flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York City, causing massive damage and starting fires that caused the weakened 110-story skyscrapers to collapse. The destroyed World Trade Center site soon became known as &quot;ground zero&quot;. Rescue workers also used the term &quot;The Big Momma!&quot;, referring to the pile of rubble that was left after the buildings collapsed.

Even after the site was cleaned up and construction on the new One World Trade Center and the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum were well under way, the term was still frequently used to refer to the site, as when opponents of the Park51 project that was to be located two blocks away from the site labeled it the &quot;Ground Zero mosque&quot;.

In advance of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg urged that the &quot;ground zero&quot; moniker be retired, saying, &quot;…the time has come to call those what they are: The World Trade Center and the National September 11th Memorial and Museum.&quot;

==Meteor air bursts==
The hypocenter of a meteor air burst, an asteroid or comet that explodes in the atmosphere rather than strike the surface, is the closest point on the surface to the explosion. The Tunguska event occurred in Siberia in 1908 and flattened an estimated 80 million trees over an area of of forest. The trees at the hypocenter of the blast were left standing, but all their limbs had been blown off by the shockwave. The 2013 Chelyabinsk meteor&#x27;s hypocenter in Russia was more populated than that of Tunguska, resulting in civil damage and injury, mostly from flying glass shards from broken windows.

==Earthquakes==
An earthquake&#x27;s hypocenter or focus is the position where the strain energy stored in the rock is first released, marking the point where the fault begins to rupture. This occurs directly beneath the epicenter, at a distance known as the &quot;hypocentral depth&quot; or &quot;focal depth&quot;.

The focal depth can be calculated from measurements based on seismic wave phenomena. As with all wave phenomena in physics, there is uncertainty in such measurements that grows with the wavelength so the focal depth of the source of these long-wavelength (low frequency) waves is difficult to determine exactly. Very strong earthquakes radiate a large fraction of their released energy in seismic waves with very long wavelengths and therefore a stronger earthquake involves the release of energy from a larger mass of rock.

Computing the hypocenters of foreshocks, main shock, and aftershocks of earthquakes allows the three-dimensional plotting of the fault along which movement is occurring. The expanding wavefront from the earthquake&#x27;s rupture propagates at a speed of several kilometers per second; this seismic wave is what is measured at various surface points in order to geometrically determine an initial guess as to the hypocenter. The wave reaches each station based upon how far away it was from the hypocenter. A number of things need to be taken into account, most importantly variations in the waves speed based upon the materials that it is passing through. With adjustments for velocity changes, the initial estimate of the hypocenter is made, then a series of linear equations is set up, one for each station. The equations express the difference between the observed arrival times and those calculated from the initial estimated hypocenter. These equations are solved by the method of least squares which minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed and calculated arrival times, and a new estimated hypocenter is computed. The system iterates until the location is pinpointed within the margin of error for the velocity computations.

<doc id="679585" wikidata="Q926308" url="?curid=679585" title="Henri Gaudier-Brzeska">
<text>Henri Gaudier-Brzeska (né Gaudier; 4 October 1891 – 5 June 1915) was a French artist and sculptor who developed a rough-hewn, primitive style of direct carving.

==Biography==
Henri Gaudier was born in Saint-Jean-de-Braye near Orléans. In 1910, he moved to London to become an artist, even though he had no formal training. With him came Sophie Brzeska, a Polish writer over twice his age whom he had met at the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris, and with whom he began an intense relationship, annexing her surname although they never married. (According to Jim Ede the linking of their names was never more than a personal arrangement.) During this time his conflicting attitudes towards art are exemplified in what he wrote to Dr. Uhlmayr, with whom he had lived the previous year:

&quot;When I face the beauty of nature, I am no longer sensitive to art, but in the town I appreciate its myriad benefits—the more I go into the woods and the fields the more distrustful I become of art and wish all civilization to the devil; the more I wander about amidst filth and sweat the better I understand art and love it; the desire for it becomes my crying need.&quot;
He resolved these reservations by taking up sculpture, having been inspired by his carpenter father. Once in England Gaudier-Brzeska fell in with the Vorticism movement of Ezra Pound and Wyndham Lewis, becoming a founding member of the London Group. After coming under the influence of Jacob Epstein in 1912, he began to believe that sculpture should leave behind the highly finished, polished style of ancient Greece and embrace a more earthy direct carving, in which the tool marks are left visible on the final work as a fingerprint of the artist. Abandoning his early fascination for Auguste Rodin, he began to study instead extra-European artworks located in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum. As he was unable to afford the raw materials necessary to attempt projects on the scale of Epstein&#x27;s Indian and Assyrian influenced pieces, he concentrated initially on miniaturist sculpture genres such as Japanese netsuke before developing an interest in work from West Africa and the Pacific Islands.

In 1913, he assisted with the illustrations of Haldane MacFall&#x27;s book &quot;The Splendid Wayfaring&quot; along with Claud Lovat Fraser and Edward Gordon Craig.
In 1913 Henri Gaudier-Brzeska met Alfred Wolmark, the Jewish artist and modelled a bronze bust of the young artist, and the two remained close friends.

Gaudier-Brzeska&#x27;s drawing style was influenced by the Chinese calligraphy and poetry which he discovered at the &quot;Ezuversity&quot;, Ezra Pound&#x27;s unofficial locus of teaching. Pound&#x27;s interaction with Ernest Fenollosa&#x27;s work on the Chinese brought the young sculptor to the galleries of Eastern art, where he studied the ideogram and applied it to his art. Gaudier-Brzeska had the ability to imply, with a few deft strokes, the being of a subject. His drawings also show the influence of Cubism.

At the start of the First World War, Gaudier-Brzeska enlisted with the French army. He appears to have fought with little regard for his own safety, receiving a decoration for bravery before being killed in the trenches at Neuville-St.-Vaast. During his time in the army, he sculpted a figure out of the butt of a rifle taken from a German soldier, &quot;to express a gentler order of feeling&quot;. He was killed in action during the war.

===Relationship with Sophie Brzeska===

Gaudier met Sophie Brzeska, a Polish ex-governess twice his age, when he was only 18. Gaudier was an artist and Brzeska a novelist. Several books about Gaudier&#x27;s work have been produced, but only the 1931 book &quot;Savage Messiah&quot; by H. S. Ede (Jim Ede) focuses on the relationship. A 1985 play by Una Flett, entitled &quot;Zosienka&quot;, explored their relationship and age differences. In Ede&#x27;s work, Brzeska was presented as more of a companion and her relationship with Gaudier resembled a co-dependency, since both suffered from clear mental health issues. Henri was devoted to Sophie, even taking her last name as his, but Sophie was often dismissive and cold towards Henri&#x27;s romantic overtures (indeed, according to Ede they either never had sex, only did once or twice, or rarely did). They were often apart and Sophie would hire Henri prostitutes for his enjoyment instead of having relations with him.

Brzeska is often left out of accounts of Gaudier&#x27;s life. Even &quot;Savage Messiah&quot; itself focuses on the artist and Brzeska is regarded with very little interest. Ken Russell&#x27;s 1972 film of the book, however, changes the focus to Sophie and Henri Gaudier&#x27;s relationship.

Following his death Sophie Brzeska became distraught, eventually dying in an asylum in 1925.

==Legacy==

Jim Ede bought a sizeable portion of Gaudier-Brzeska&#x27;s work from Sophie Brzeska&#x27;s estate after she died intestate. Her estate included numerous letters sent between Henri and Sophie. Ede used these as the basis for his book &quot;Savage Messiah&quot; on the life and work of Gaudier-Brzeska, which in turn became the basis of Ken Russell&#x27;s film of the same name. The conclusion of the film peruses many of his sculptures and fully demonstrates what great art he produced in his short lifetime.

Despite the fact that he had only four years to develop his art, Gaudier-Brzeska has had a surprisingly strong influence on 20th-century modernist sculpture in England and France. His work is in the permanent collections at the Tate Gallery, Kettle&#x27;s Yard, the Princeton University Art Museum, the Harvard Art Museums, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Huntington Library, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris, and the Musée des Beaux-Arts d&#x27;Orléans, among others. 

The Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University held an exhibition entitled &quot;The Vorticists: Rebel Artists in London and New York, 1914–18&quot; from 30 September 2010 through 2 January 2011, which included his work.

The relationship between Henri Gaudier and Sophie Brzeska was fictionalised in the stage play &quot;The Laughing Woman&quot;.

<text>The Eastern Hemisphere is the half of the planet Earth which is east of the prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, London, United Kingdom) and west of the antimeridian (which crosses the Pacific Ocean and relatively little land from pole to pole). It is also used to refer to Afro-Eurasia (Africa and Eurasia) and Australia, in contrast with the Western Hemisphere, which includes mainly North and South America. The Eastern Hemisphere may also be called the &quot;Oriental Hemisphere&quot;, and may in addition be used in a cultural or geopolitical sense as a synonym for the European term, &quot;Old World.&quot;

== Geography ==
The almost perfect circle (the earth is an oblate spheroid that is wider around the equator), drawn with a line, demarcating the Eastern and Western Hemispheres must be an arbitrarily decided and published convention, unlike the equator (an imaginary line encircling Earth, equidistant from its poles), which divides the Northern and Southern hemispheres. The prime meridian at 0° longitude and the antimeridian, at 180° longitude, are the conventionally accepted boundaries, since they divide eastern longitudes from western longitudes. This convention was established in 1884 at the International Meridian Conference held in Washington, D.C. where the standard time concepts of Canadian railroad engineer Sir Sandford Fleming were adopted. The Hemispheres agreed do not correspond with exact continents. Portions of Western Europe, West Africa, Oceania, and extreme northeastern Russia are in the Western Hemisphere, divorcing it from the continents which form the touchstone for most geopolitical constructs of &quot;the East&quot; and &quot;the West&quot;.

Consequently, meridians of 20°W and the diametrically opposed 160°E are often used outside of matters of physics and navigation, which includes all of the European and African mainlands, but also includes a small portion of northeast Greenland (typically reckoned as part of North America) and excludes more of eastern Russia and Oceania (e.g., New Zealand). Prior to the global adoption of standard time, numerous prime meridians were decreed by various countries where time was defined by local noon (thereby, local).

The centre of the Eastern Hemisphere is located in the Indian Ocean at the intersection of the equator and the 90th meridian east, 910 km west of Indonesia in the Ninety East Ridge. The nearest land is Simeulue Island at .

The land mass of the Eastern Hemisphere is larger than that of the Western Hemisphere and has a wide variety of habitats.

== Sovereign states in both hemispheres ==
Below is a list of the sovereign states in both the Western and Eastern hemispheres on the IERS Reference Meridian, in order from north to south:

* Denmark, due to the entirety of &quot;Greenland&quot; and the &quot;Faroe Islands&quot;. Denmark proper lies entirely within the Eastern Hemisphere.
* Norway, due only to Jan Mayen. Mainland Norway, &quot;Svalbard&quot; and &quot;Bouvet Island&quot; lie entirely within the Eastern Hemisphere.
* United Kingdom, passing through Greenwich, London. Most of the country lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* The Netherlands has overseas islands that lie entirely within the Western Hemisphere, while mainland Netherlands lies entirely within the Eastern Hemisphere.

* France, passing through Puynormand (Gironde). About 1/3 of the country, including cities like Nantes or Bordeaux, as well as the overseas regions of Guadeloupe, Martinique, and French Guiana lie within the Western Hemisphere.
* Spain, passing through Castellón de la Plana (Valencian Community). Most of Spain, including the capital Madrid, the Canary Islands and the southern half of its Mediterranean territorial waters, lies within the Western Hemisphere. Spanish, Moroccan and Algerian Mediterranean waters are the only part of the Mediterranean Sea located in the Western Hemisphere.
* Algeria, passing through Stidia. About 1/4 of the country, including Oran, Algeria&#x27;s second-largest city, lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* Mali, passing through the municipal area of Gao. Most of Mali, including the capital Bamako, lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* Burkina Faso, passing through Lalgaye. Most of the country, including the capital Ouagadougou, lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* Ghana, passing through Tema. Most of Ghana, including the capital Accra, lies within the Western Hemisphere.
* Togo, passing near Tami (Tône Prefecture in Savanes Region).

Below is a list of additional sovereign states which are in both the Western and Eastern hemispheres along the 180th meridian, in order from north to south. (France is not listed below due to its inclusion above, though the meridian does pass Wallis and Futuna.) With the exception of the United States (due to &quot;Wake Island&quot;, &quot;Guam&quot; and the &quot;Northern Mariana Islands&quot;), all of them are located on just one side of the International Date Line, which curves around them.

* Russia, passing through Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. Its portion lying east of the 180th meridian is the only part of the country lying in the Western Hemisphere.
* United States, passing through the Aleutian Islands (Alaska). Except for the portion of Aleutian Islands and waters lying west of the 180th meridian, &quot;Guam&quot;, the &quot;Northern Mariana Islands&quot;, and &quot;Wake Island&quot;, most of the country lies east of the 180th meridian.
* Kiribati, passing close to Arorae. The country has both the Equator and the 180th meridian (antimeridian) crossing through its territory. It is the only country located in four hemispheres.
* Tuvalu, passing close to its capital, Funafuti.
* Fiji, passing close to its dependency &quot;Rotuma&quot; and passing through Taveuni.
* Most of New Zealand proper lies within the Eastern Hemisphere; but Chatham Islands and Kermadec Islands, as well as the self-governing states of the &quot;Cook Islands&quot; and &quot;Niue&quot; and the dependent territory of &quot;Tokelau,&quot; lie east of the 180th meridian.

== Countries, dependencies and other territories in the Eastern Hemisphere but not in Europe, Africa, Asia, or Oceania ==
The following countries and territories lie outside Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania and are entirely, mostly, or partially within the Western Hemisphere

== Demographics ==
82% of humans live in the Eastern Hemisphere, and 18% in the Western Hemisphere.

<text>Desmond Rex Williams (born 20 July 1933) is an English retired professional billiards and snooker player. He was the second player to make an official maximum break in snooker, achieving this in an exhibition match in December 1965. Williams won the World Professional Billiards Championship from Clark McConachy in 1968, the first time that the title had been contested since 1951. Williams retained the title in several challenge matches in the 1970s and, after losing it to Fred Davis in 1980, regained it from 1982 to 1983.

He played a leading role in the re-establishment of the World Snooker Championship on a challenge basis in 1964, and lost twice to John Pulman, once in a single match and once in a series of matches played in South Africa. When the Championship reverted to being a knockout from 1969, he reached the semi-finals three times. In 1968 he initiated the revival of the Professional Billiards Players Association (known as the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association from 1970). He chaired the association, barring a few weeks in 1983, until 1987, and again from 1997 to 1999.

Williams was a successful junior player in both snooker and billiards, and became a professional in 1951 at the age of 18. At the 1986 Grand Prix, aged 53, he became the oldest player to reach a ranking tournament final. He lost the match 6–10 to Jimmy White after leading 6–4. He retired from competitive snooker in 1995, having achieved his highest ranking, 6th, in 1976/77.

==Career==
===Junior career===
Williams was born in Halesowen on 20 July 1933. He started playing on a full-size billiard table at the age of 13 on a table installed at his father&#x27;s printing works, and was coached by Kingsley Kennerley. He won the Midlands Boys Titles in both billiards and snooker. In 1948 he won the British Boys&#x27; (under-16) Championships at both snooker and billiards, and in 1950 he was the National Under-19 Billiards champion. He played an exhibition match against Joe Davis in 1949, winning the one 85–51 after receiving 21 start. In 1951, at 17 years old, he became the youngest winner of the English Amateur Snooker Championship (until Jimmy White in 1979), beating the 1939 champion Percy Bendon 6–1 in the final. He also won the 1951 National Under-19 Championships at both snooker and billiards.

===Early professional career===
Williams turned professional in 1951 at the age of 18, and entered the 1952 World Professional Match-play Championship. He met Alec Brown in the first round in a match over 61 frames played from 17 to 22 December 1951 at Darlaston, Staffordshire. Brown won comfortably, taking a winning 33–17 lead after the fifth day and eventually winning 39–22. Williams made his debut at Leicester Square Hall in early 1952, playing John Pulman in an exhibition match on level terms. Pulman won the six-day match 42–31. Williams then beat John Barrie 40–33 in another exhibition match, receiving 10 points each frame in the handicapped match.

In May and early June 1952, Williams played in the qualifying competition for the 1952/1953 News of the World Snooker Tournament. In his first match he played 66-year-old Willie Smith and won 22–15. The qualifying was won by Jackie Rea who advanced to the main event. Williams met Kingsley Kennerley in the first qualifying round for the World Championship. Kennerley had already beaten him 23–14 in the News of the World qualifying and beat him again, this time 25–12. Albert Brown was ill for two of his matches in the News of the World Tournament and Williams played Fred Davis in a three-day exhibition match, in place of the planned second contest. Williams received a 14-point start but Fred Davis won the match 23–14. In March 1953, Williams played Joe Davis in an exhibition match. Williams received a 21-point handicap but Joe Davis won 43–30, scoring 4 centuries on the final day.

Williams met Harry Stokes in the 31-frame qualifying round of the World Championship in early October 1953 and led 3–2 after the first session. Williams was then ill and the match was rearranged for a later date. The match was, however, later cancelled and Stokes advanced to the next round.

===1960s revival of snooker===
In 1964, the Conayes £200 Professional Tournament was staged at the Rex Williams Snooker Centre in Blackheath, being the first commercially sponsored professional snooker event since 1960. Williams was one of the four competitors, along with Fred Davis, John Pulman and Jackie Rea. Pulman won the event. Williams was instrumental in the revival of the World Snooker Championship in 1964, obtaining sanction for the competition after taking the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC) chairman Harold Phillips out to lunch. The championship was staged on a challenge basis, with the first match being scheduled between Pulman, the winner of the 1957 World Professional Match-play Championship, and Fred Davis. Pulman beat Davis 19–16.

Later in 1964, Williams challenged Pulman for the title. The match was over 73 frames, played over 6 days from 12 to 17 October at Burroughes Hall. Williams led 8–4 at the end of the first day but Pulman won 11 of the 12 frames on the second day to lead 15–9. Pulman extended his lead to 31–17 after four days and won the match on the fifth day, taking a 37–23 winning lead. Pulman made a break of 109 in frame 57. The remaining 13 &quot;dead&quot; frames were played on the final day with Pulman finishing 40–33 ahead. Williams and Pulman met again in late 1965 in a series of short matches in South Africa, but Williams was unsuccessful again, losing 25 matches to 22. In one of these matches in East London in the Eastern Cape, Williams made a break of 142, breaking the World Championship record of 136 set by Joe Davis in 1946. This stood as the world championship record break until 1981, when Doug Mountjoy compiled a 145. In December 1965, during an exhibition match in Cape Town against Mannie Francisco, Williams followed Joe Davis as the second man to make a recognised 147 break.

In 1967, Williams and Fred Davis played a 51 match series that was billed as the World Open Matchplay Snooker Challenge, even though no other entries were solicited. The following year, Williams convened a meeting of players at his house that led to the revival of the Professional Billiard Players Association (PBPA), with Williams as chairman.

===World professional billiards championship and the WPBSA===
Williams won the World Professional Billiards Championship seven times from 1968 to 1983, including a reign as champion from 1968 to 1980. In 1968, Williams was on a trip to Australia, and decided to travel to Auckland in New Zealand to play the reigning champion Clark McConachy for the billiards title, which had not been contested since McConachy&#x27;s 1951 win. By this time, McConachy was 73, and his play was affected by his Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Williams won the title 5,499–5,234, and made the match&#x27;s highest break, 293.

Leslie Driffield was nominated as the BA&amp;CC challenger to Williams for the professional Billiards Championship. Williams declined to play Driffield within the five months time limit that the BA&amp;CC had set, which expired on 7 July 1970, and forfeited the title, which was then contested between Driffield and Jack Karnehm in June 1971. On 1 October 1970, the PBPA disaffiliated from the BA&amp;CC. The PBPA changed its name to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association on 12 December 1970, and declared itself the governing body for the professional game, recognising Williams as champion. Driffield and Karnehm were, at first, the only two professionals to recognise the BA&amp;CC as continuing to have authority over the game. During the 1970s, Williams made four successful defences of his title, against Bernard Bennett in 1971, Karnehm in 1973, and Eddie Charlton in 1974 and 1976. He also won the 1979 UK Championship, which was the first time the event had been held since Fred Davis won in 1951. Williams beat Karnehm in the semi-final and John Barrie 2,952–2,116 in the final. He reached the 1980 and 1981 UK finals, both against Karnehm, losing 2,423–2,518 in 1980 and winning 1,592–1,112 in 1981.

Williams lost the world title to Fred Davis in May 1980. Davis made a break of 583, the highest in the world championship for 46 years, in beating Williams 5,978–4,452. The championship then reverted to a knockout format, and was held in November 1980, with Williams losing to Mark Wildman in the semi-final. At the next staging, in 1982, Williams regained the title by beating Wildman 3,000–1,785 in the final; he retained it in 1983 with a 1,500–605 victory over Davis in the final. Unhappy at not being allowed to use a practice table near another match at the 1983 tournament, Williams had left the venue and returned late for his semi-final against Ray Edmonds, causing the match to start 48 minutes late. There were no rules in place for penalties for late arrivals, but following complaints to the WPBSA, Williams was fined £500 by the association, and resigned as chairman, but remained on the board. Three weeks later, he accepted the board&#x27;s invitation to become chairman again. He continued as chairman until 1987, and took the role again from 1997 to 1999. In 2001, he was expelled from the Association following alleged fiduciary irregularities and asked to repay legal costs of £28,268, but was reinstated as a full member the following year. The Association apologised for its actions &quot;unequivocally&quot;.

===Later professional career===
Williams reached the semi-final of the World Snooker Championship three times, losing to John Spencer in 1969, in 1972 to Alex Higgins 30–31 (having been four frames ahead with five left to play) and, in 1974, 7–15 to Graham Miles. He never won a World Championship match at the Crucible Theatre after it became the World Snooker Championship&#x27;s venue in 1977, despite playing at the venue on eight occasions (a record he shares with Cliff Wilson). He recovered from 8–2 down to win 9–8 against Terry Griffiths in the first round of the 1978 UK Championship, in the future World Champion Griffiths&#x27; first match as a professional. Williams was the 1973 Pot Black runner-up, losing 33–99 to Charlton in the one-frame final.

In the 1985–86 snooker season, Williams reached the semi-finals of the 1986 Classic and the last sixteen of two other ranking events, and after some years outside the elite top 16 ranked players, was ranked 16th for 1986/1987. This meant that he earnt a place in the Masters for the first time since 1977. He was beaten 1–5 by Cliff Thorburn in the first round of the 1987 event. During the 1986–87 snooker season, Williams became the oldest player to reach a world-ranking final when, aged 53, he lost 6–10 to Jimmy White at the 1986 Grand Prix, after having led 6–4. His run to the Grand Prix final included 5–1 wins over both Higgins and Steve Davis, and a 9–8 semi-final defeat of Neal Foulds. He finished the season ranked 12th.

His last tournament as a professional snooker player was the 1995 World Championship, where he beat Steve Day and Chris O&#x27;Sullivan, before losing in the fourth qualifying round 3–10 to Nick Walker. His highest world ranking was 6th, in 1976/1977.

He founded a cue-making company, Power Glide Cues, and in 1975 established Rex Williams Leisure, a snooker and pool table manufacturing and hire business. Stephen Hendry bought a Rex Williams signature cue for £40 when he was aged 13, and used it until it was broken in 2003, including during his seven world snooker championship wins. Williams was a commentator for snooker television broadcasts for the BBC from 1978 to 1984, and after that for ITV. His book &quot;Snooker : How to become a Champion&quot; was published in 1975, and republished with some amendments as &quot;How to play Snooker&quot; in 1982 and 1988, and as &quot;Snooker&quot; in 1984.

Williams was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 2020 Birthday Honours for services to snooker and billiards.

<text>Eric Robert Wolf (February 1, 1923 – March 6, 1999) was an anthropologist, best known for his studies of peasants, Latin America, and his advocacy of Marxist perspectives within anthropology.

== Early life ==
=== Life in Vienna ===
Wolf was born in Vienna, Austria to a Jewish family. Wolf has described his family as nonreligious, and said that he had little experience of a Jewish community while growing up. His father worked for a corporation and was a Freemason. Wolf described his mother, who had studied medicine in Russia, as a feminist—&quot;not in terms of declarations, but in terms of her stand on human possibilities.&quot; In 1933, his father&#x27;s work moved the family to Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia, where Wolf attended German Gymnasium. He describes his life in the 1920s and 30s in segregated Vienna and then in proletarianizing Czechoslovakia as attuning him early on to questions surrounding class, ethnicity, and political power. The social divisions in Vienna and conflicts in the region in the 1930s influenced Wolf&#x27;s later scholarly work.

=== Studying and living in other countries ===
Wolf and his family moved to England and then to the United States to escape Nazism. He attended the Forest School, in Walthamstow, Essex, for two years, where he learned English and became interested in science, in part because of the strong emphasis on science of the school&#x27;s Canadian headmaster. Despite learning English only when he arrived at the school as a teenager, he won the school&#x27;s English essay prize. Moving to England also made him aware of cultural difference in a new way. In 1940, Wolf was interned in an alien detention camp in Huyton, near Liverpool, England. The detention camp was a high stress environment. It was there that Wolf became exposed to the organizational possibilities of socialism and communism. Through seminars organized by intellectuals in the camp, he was also exposed to the social sciences. Wolf was especially influenced by the German Jewish sociologist Norbert Elias who was also interned there.

Later in 1940, Wolf emigrated to the United States—the same period that 300,000 Jews emigrated to the U.S. from Germany. He enrolled in Queens College in New York City and also spent a summer at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee in 1941. Spending time in the South allowed Wolf to see a different side of the United States than he was familiar with from New York. Wolf was in the army and fought overseas in World War II, serving in Italy with the 10th Mountain Division. After returning from Europe, Wolf finished college at Queens College. There, he became interested in anthropology, and later went on to study anthropology at Columbia University.

== Career ==

Columbia had been the home of Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict for many years, and was the central location for the spread of anthropology in America. By the time Wolf had arrived Boas had died and his anthropological style, which was suspicious of generalization and preferred detailed studies of particular subjects, was also out of fashion. The new chair of the anthropology department was Julian Steward, a student of Robert Lowie and Alfred Kroeber. Steward was interested in creating a scientific anthropology which explained how societies evolved and adapted to their physical environment.

Wolf was one of the coterie of students who developed around Steward. Older students&#x27; leftist beliefs, Marxist in orientation, worked well with Steward&#x27;s less politicized evolutionism. Many anthropologists prominent in the 1980s such as Sidney Mintz, Morton Fried, Elman Service, Stanley Diamond, and Robert F. Murphy were among this group.

Wolf&#x27;s dissertation research was carried out as part of Steward&#x27;s &#x27;People of Puerto Rico&#x27; project. Soon after, in 1961, Wolf began teaching at the University of Michigan, holding a position as a Distinguished Professor of Anthropology and Chair of the Department of Anthropology at Lehman College, CUNY before moving in 1971 to the CUNY Graduate Center, where he spent the remainder of his career. In addition to his Latin American work, Wolf also did fieldwork in Europe. With his student, John W. Cole, he conducted fieldwork on the culture, history, and settlement pattern of the Tyrol region, which was later published in their book The Hidden Frontier.

Wolf&#x27;s key contributions to anthropology are related to his focus on issues of power, politics, and colonialism during the 1970s and 1980s when these topics were moving to the center of disciplinary concerns. His most well-known book, &quot;Europe and the People Without History&quot;, is famous for critiquing popular European history for largely ignoring historical actors outside the ruling classes. He also demonstrates that non-Europeans were active participants in global processes like the fur and slave trades and so were not &#x27;frozen in time&#x27; or &#x27;isolated&#x27; but had always been deeply implicated in world history.

In his Distinguished Lecture for the 1989 American Anthropological Association annual meeting, he warned that anthropologists are involved in &#x27;continuously slaying paradigms, only to see them return to life, as if discovered for the first time.&#x27; This results in anthropology &#x27;resembling a project in intellectual deforestation.&#x27; He argued that anthropology can be cumulative rather than continuous re-invention. Anthropologists, rather than focusing on high-flown theory, should aim for explanatory anthropology focused on the realities of life and fieldwork. Wolf struggled with colon cancer later in life. He died in 1999 in Irvington, New York.

== Work and ideas ==

=== Disciplinary imperialism ===
As a social scientist, already fighting from a less than ideal position in the wider academy, Eric Wolf criticized what he called &quot;disciplinary imperialism&quot; within social sciences, and between social sciences on one hand, and the natural sciences on another, banishing certain topics, such as history, as not academic enough. An example within social sciences is cultural anthropology winning over social anthropology (established in British academia), over sociology, and over history in the American and Americanized global academic community, since sociology was left with studying social mobility and social class, categories which neoliberals argue to be irrelevant, cultural anthropologists on the other hand proved useful for colonialist rule over &quot;peoples without history&quot;, studying their myths, values, etc. This can be seen in mobilization of anthropologists for work with the U.S. military and Pentagon worldwide. His 1982 &quot;Europe and the People Without History&quot; reflected a turn away from, or fight against the disciplinary imperialism by dismantling ideas such as historical vs. non-historical people and societies, focusing on the relationship between European expansion and historical processes in the rest of the world—charting a global history, beginning in the 15th century. As reflected in the title of the book, he is interested in demonstrating ways in which societies written out of European histories were and are deeply involved in global historical systems and changes 

=== Power ===
Much of Wolf&#x27;s work deals with issues of power. In his book &quot;Envisioning Power: Ideologies of Dominance and Crisis&quot; (1999), Wolf deals with the relationship between power and ideas. He distinguishes between four modalities of power: 1. Power inherent in an individual; 2. Power as capacity of ego to impose one&#x27;s will on alter; 3. Power as control over the contexts in which people interact; 4. Structural power: &quot;By this I mean the power manifest in relationships that not only operates within settings and domains but also organizes and orchestrates the settings themselves, and that specifies the direction and distribution of energy flows&quot;. Based on Wolf&#x27;s previous experience and later studies, he rejects the concept of culture that emerged from the counter-Enlightenment. Instead, he proposes a redefinition of culture that emphasizes power, diversity, ambiguity, contradiction and imperfectly shared meaning and knowledge.

=== Marxism ===
Wolf, known for his interest in and contributions to Marxist thought in anthropology, says that Marxism must be understood in the context of kinship and local culture. Culture and power are integrated, and mediated by ideology and property relations. There are two branches of Marxism, as defined by Wolf: Systems Marxism and Promethean Marxism. Systems Marxism is the discipline of postulates that could be used to frame general laws or patterns of social development. Promethean Marxism symbolized optimism for freedom from economic and political mistreatment and renowned reforming as the fashion to a more desirable future.

==Activism==
Wolf was involved in the protests against the Vietnam War. During his time at the University of Michigan he organized one of the first teach-ins against the war. He also was critical of the close relationship between some anthropologists of Southeast Asia and the US government, and led an ultimately successful attempt to re-write the code of ethics of the American Anthropological Association to prevent anthropological data from knowingly being used in military campaigns.

==Personal==
Wolf had two children from his first marriage, David and Daniel. Wolf later married the anthropologist Sydel Silverman. in the 1960s his best friend was the anthropologist Robert Burns Jr., father of the documentarian Ken Burns. While Ken Burns&#x27;s mother was dying, he was cared for by Wolf&#x27;s family.

<text>Ardrishaig () is a coastal village on Loch Gilp, at the southern (eastern) entrance to the Crinan Canal in Argyll and Bute in the west of Scotland. It lies immediately to the south of Lochgilphead, with the nearest larger town being Oban.

==History==
&quot;Àird Driseig&quot; or &quot;Rubha Àird Driseig&quot;, the Scottish Gaelic versions of the name, mean &quot;height of the small bramble&quot; or &quot;promontory of the small bramble&quot;.

Ardrishaig harbour&#x27;s first pier was built in 1873.

In the 1970s, the village was significantly altered when a row of old houses and shops on the lochside of the main street was demolished to make way for a car park. Most trading now takes place in the neighbouring town Lochgilphead.

The village was a filming location for the television series &quot;A Mug&#x27;s Game&quot;.

==Governance==
Ardrishaig historically fell within the South Knapdale parish, and is now served by Ardrishaig Community Council. It has been administered since 1996 by Argyll and Bute Council, falling within the Mid Argyll ward, which is represented by three councillors. The Scottish Parliament constituency is Argyll and Bute, which is represented by Michael Russell. The UK Parliament constituency is Argyll and Bute, which is represented by Brendan O&#x27;Hara.

==Geography==
Ardrishaig lies on the side of a hill (the Cruach nam Bonnach face of Cruach Breacain) bordering the west side of Loch Gilp, just north of where it joins Loch Fyne. The linear settlement stretches southwards along the A83 (Chalmers Street) from around south of the junction with the A816, on the southwest side of Lochgilphead. The Crinan Canal runs north–south through Ardrishaig, with locks and a basin at its southern terminus.

Ardrishaig Community Council is part-owner of the wind farm at Allt Dearg on the hill above Inverneill to the south of the town.

==Demography==
Ardrishaig had 1,283 inhabitants in 2001.

==Landmarks==
===Crinan Canal and harbour===
There are two piers, a lighthouse, slipway and breakwater along the seafront. Scottish Canals has an office by the canal basin. To the north side of the old pier is the Crinan Canal sea lock and to the south are pontoons and anchorage for boats. About 30,000 tonnes of timber pass through the harbour annually but it has the capacity for 150,000 tonnes.

===Other landmarks===
Facilities in the village include a hotel, public houses, a church, school, post office and antiques shops. There are two public telephone boxes and a public lavatory.

==Education==
Ardrishaig Primary School is located in the village, and serves the area between Erins and Millers Bridge. The present building dates from 1986. For secondary education, the village falls within the catchment area of Lochgilphead Joint Campus.

==Notable people==
John Smith, former Labour MP and Leader of the Opposition, was born in Ardrishaig.

James Chalmers, pioneering missionary, was born and lived in Ardrishaig until he was seven years old.

Sir St Clair Thomson, Surgeon educated at the village school at Ardrishaig until he was ten years old.

<text>The Gothic Archies are an American indie rock/gothic rock band established by Stephin Merritt of The Magnetic Fields. In 1997, Merritt released &quot;The New Despair&quot;. The EP featured the song &quot;Your Long White Fingers&quot;, which appeared frequently in the Nickelodeon series &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;.

The band later became more prominent when Merritt wrote, performed and recorded songs for the audiobook versions of Lemony Snicket&#x27;s &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. A collection of thirteen songs based on each book and two additional tracks was released as &quot;The Tragic Treasury&quot; on October 10, 2006, to coincide with the release of the final book in the series. The Gothic Archies briefly toured to promote the album featuring Merritt on ukulele and Daniel Handler on accordion. In 2002, The Gothic Archies composed original music for the audiobook version of Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Coraline&quot;.

<text>The first USS &quot;Whipple&quot; (DD-15) was a in the United States Navy, named for Abraham Whipple.

==Built in Sparrows Point, Maryland==
She was laid down on 13 November 1899, at Sparrows Point, Maryland, by the Maryland Steel Company; launched on 15 August 1901; sponsored by Miss Elsie Pope; and commissioned on 17 February 1903, Lieutenant Jehu V. Chase in command.

==Pre-World War I==
After training in Chesapeake Bay, &quot;Whipple&quot; was assigned to the 2nd Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet, and was based at Norfolk. The destroyer periodically served as flagship of the flotilla and operated off the east coast and in the Caribbean until she was placed in reserve at Norfolk on 5 September 1905.

Returning to active service on 16 July 1906, the ship conducted tactical exercises and routine training operations through November 1907, apart from taking part in relief operations after the 1907 Kingston earthquake in Jamaica. On 2 December, &quot;Whipple&quot; stood out of Hampton Roads and headed south toward the Caribbean for goodwill visits — &quot;showing the flag.&quot;

Subsequently, following in the wake of the 16 battleships of the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot;, &quot;Whipple&quot; and her flotilla-mates called at Rio de Janeiro; rounded Cape Horn for ports on the Chilean and Peruvian coasts; and conducted target practice at Magdalena Bay, Mexico. After participating in a fleet review at San Francisco on 8 May 1908, &quot;Whipple&quot; remained on the west coast, based at San Diego, as a unit of the Pacific Torpedo Flotilla.

Departing San Francisco at the end of a towline on 24 August, the destroyer subsequently took part in fleet battle problems in Hawaiian waters. Upon completion of the exercises, she steamed back to the west coast via Samoa and Magdalena Bay, Baja California, before arriving at San Diego on 1 December.

For the next six years, the destroyer operated off the west coast between San Diego and Magdalena Bay and made one cruise to Alaskan waters for maneuvers. The ship received the Mexican Service Medal for service off the Mexican coast in 1914 and 1916. While that country suffered in the throes of revolution and civil strife, the destroyer conducted patrols and stood ready to protect American lives and property.

==World War I==
On 6 April 1917, America entered World War I on the side of Britain, France, and Italy. &quot;Whipple&quot; soon commenced patrols off the approaches to the vital Panama Canal before departing the Panama Canal Zone on 5 July.

Refitted for &quot;distant service&quot;, the destroyer put to sea on 28 August, bound for the Atlantic war zone, and put into the Azores on 17 September. &quot;Whipple&quot; operated on escort duties, convoying ships to and from the strategic islands for the next three months.

She then received orders to report at Brest, France. Anti-submarine patrols and convoy escort duties occupied &quot;Whipple&quot; through the early spring of 1918. On 17 April, munition ship &quot;Florence H.&quot; blew up off Quiberon Bay. Braving flying debris from the exploding ship, &quot;Whipple&quot; joined and in rescuing 32 men of the 77-man crew of that doomed vessel.

&quot;Whipple&quot; carried out her routine wartime patrol duties through the end of hostilities. On 9 December, the destroyer departed the French coast and headed homeward, touching at the Azores and Bermuda before making port at Philadelphia on 3 January 1919.

The destroyer was decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 7 July, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September. On 3 January 1920, Henry A. Hitner&#x27;s Sons Company, of Philadelphia, purchased the ship for scrapping.

==Noteworthy commanding officers==

* Lieutenant Frank H. Brumby (8 August 1906 – 25 August 1906) (Later Admiral)

<doc id="679596" wikidata="Q2622756" url="?curid=679596" title="Continuous wavelet transform">
<text>In mathematics, the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is a formal (i.e., non-numerical) tool that provides an overcomplete representation of a signal by letting the translation and scale parameter of the wavelets vary continuously.

==Definition==
The continuous wavelet transform of a function formula_1 at a scale formula_2 and translational value formula_3 is expressed by the following integral

:formula_4
Traditionally, this constant is called wavelet admissible constant. A wavelet whose admissible constant satisfies 
:formula_5
is called an admissible wavelet. To recover the original signal formula_1, the second inverse continuous wavelet transform can be exploited.
:formula_7
This inverse transform suggests that a wavelet should be defined as
:formula_8
where formula_9 is a window. Such defined wavelet can be called as an analyzing wavelet, because it admits to time-frequency analysis. An analyzing wavelet is unnecessary to be admissible.

==Scale factor==

The scale factor formula_10 either dilates or compresses a signal. When the scale factor is relatively low, the signal is more contracted which in turn results in a more detailed resulting graph. However, the drawback is that low scale factor does not last for the entire duration of the signal. On the other hand, when the scale factor is high, the signal is stretched out which means that the resulting graph will be presented in less detail. Nevertheless, it usually lasts the entire duration of the signal.

==Continuous wavelet transform properties==
In definition, the continuous wavelet transform is a convolution of the input data sequence with a set of functions generated by the mother wavelet. The convolution can be computed by using a fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. Normally, the output formula_11 is a real valued function except when the mother wavelet is complex. A complex mother wavelet will convert the continuous wavelet transform to a complex valued function. The power spectrum of the continuous wavelet transform can be represented by formula_12.
==Applications of the wavelet transform==
One of the most popular applications of wavelet transform is image compression. The advantage of using wavelet-based coding in image compression is that it provides significant improvements in picture quality at higher compression ratios over conventional techniques. Since wavelet transform has the ability to decompose complex information and patterns into elementary forms, it is commonly used in acoustics processing and pattern recognition, but it has been also proposed as an instantaneous frequency estimator. Moreover, wavelet transforms can be applied to the following scientific research areas: edge and corner detection, partial differential equation solving, transient detection, filter design, electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, texture analysis, business information analysis and gait analysis. Wavelet transforms can also be used in Electroencephalography (EEG) data analysis to identify epileptic spikes resulting from epilepsy. Wavelet transform has been also successfully used for the interpretation of time series of landslides and land subsidence, and for calculating the changing periodicities of epidemics.

Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is very efficient in determining the damping ratio of oscillating signals (e.g. identification of damping in dynamic systems). CWT is also very resistant to the noise in the signal.

<doc id="679597" wikidata="Q22335" url="?curid=679597" title="Vajont Dam">
<text>The Vajont Dam or Vaiont Dam is a disused hydro-electric dam in northern Italy. It is one of the tallest dams in the world, with a height of . It is in the valley of the Vajont (river) under Monte Toc, in the municipality of Erto e Casso, north of Venice.

The dam was conceived in the 1920s and eventually built between 1957 and 1960 by Società Adriatica di Elettricità, at the time the electricity supply and distribution monopoly in northeastern Italy. The engineer was Carlo Semenza (1893–1961). In 1962, the dam was nationalized and came under the control of ENEL as part of the Italian Ministry of Public Works.

On 9 October 1963, during initial filling of the lake, a landslide caused a megatsunami in which of water overtopped the dam in a wave of , bringing massive flooding and destruction to the Piave Valley below, destroying several villages and towns, causing an estimated 1,900 to 2,500 deaths. The dam itself remained almost intact and two-thirds of the water was retained behind it.

This event occurred after ENEL and the Italian government concealed reports and dismissed evidence that Monte Toc, on the southern side of the lake, was geologically unstable. They had disregarded numerous warnings, danger signals, and negative appraisals. Underestimating the size of the landslide, ENEL&#x27;s attempt to safely mitigate any landslide by lowering the level of the lake came too late, when disaster was almost imminent.

==Construction==
The dam was built by Società Adriatica di Elettricità (SADE), the electricity supply and distribution monopoly in northeastern Italy. The owner, Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata, had been Mussolini&#x27;s minister of finance for several years. The &quot;tallest dam in the world&quot;, across the Vajont Gorge, was conceived in the 1920s to harness the Piave, Mae, and Boite Rivers, to meet the growing demand for power generation and industrialization. The project was not authorized until 15 October 1943, after the confusion following Mussolini&#x27;s fall during World War II was resolved.

The dam wall had a volume of and held up to of water. The dam and basin were intended to be at the centre of a complex water-management system in which water would have been channeled from nearby valleys and artificial basins at higher levels. Tens of kilometres of concrete pipes and pipe bridges across valleys were planned.

In the 1950s, SADE&#x27;s monopoly was confirmed by post-fascist governments, and it bought the land despite opposition from the communities of Erto and Casso in the valley, which was overcome by government and police support. SADE stated that the geology of the gorge had been studied, including analysis of previous landslides, and that the mountain was held to be sufficiently stable.

Construction work on the dam started in 1957. By 1959, shifts and fractures in the ground were noticed while building a new road on the side of Monte Toc. This led to further studies in which three experts separately told SADE that the entire side of Monte Toc was unstable and was likely to collapse into the basin if the filling were completed, due to the raised water level increasing the instability. SADE took no notice and construction was completed in October 1959. In February 1960, SADE was authorised to start filling the lake. In 1962, the dam was nationalized and came under the control of ENEL as part of the Italian Ministry for Public Works.

==Early signs of disaster==
On 22 March 1959, during construction of the Vajont Dam, a landslide at the nearby Pontesei Dam created a wave that killed one person. Throughout the summer of 1960, minor landslides and earth movements were noticed. Instead of heeding these warning signs, the Italian government chose to sue the handful of journalists reporting the problems for &quot;undermining the social order&quot;.

On 4 November 1960, with the water level in the reservoir at about of the planned , a landslide of about collapsed into the lake. SADE stopped the filling, lowered the water level by about , and started to build an artificial gallery in the basin in front of Monte Toc to keep the basin usable even if additional landslides (which were expected) divided it into two parts.

In October 1961, after the completion of the gallery, SADE resumed filling the reservoir under controlled monitoring. In April and May 1962, with the basin water level at , the people of Erto and Casso reported five &quot;grade five&quot; Mercalli intensity scale earthquakes. SADE downplayed the importance of these quakes, and was then authorized to fill the reservoir to the maximum level.

In July 1962, SADE&#x27;s own engineers reported the results of model-based experiments on the effects of further landslides from Monte Toc into the lake. The tests indicated that a wave generated by a landslide could overtop the crest of the dam if the water level was or less from the dam crest. SADE therefore decided that a reduced level below the crest would prevent any displacement wave from over-topping the dam.

In March 1963, the dam was transferred to the newly constituted government service for electricity, ENEL. During the following summer, with the reservoir almost completely filled, landslips, shakes, and movements of the ground were repeatedly reported by the alarmed population. On 15 September 1963, the entire side of the mountain slid by . On 26 September 1963, ENEL decided to slowly empty the basin to . By early October 1963, the collapse of the mountain&#x27;s south side looked unavoidable; in one day, it moved almost .

== Tests of the hydraulic model of the Vajont tank ==
After the discovery of the landslide on the northern slopes of Monte Toc, it was decided to deepen the studies on these effects:
* Dynamic actions on the dam
* Wave effects in the reservoir and possible dangers for nearby locations, with particular attention to the town of Erto
* Hypothesis of a partial breakage of the dam and consequent examination of the rout wave and its propagation along the last stretch of the Vajont and along the Piave, up to Soverzene and beyond

The study of point 1 was performed at the Experimental Institute for Models and Structures (ISMES) of Bergamo, while for the others, the SADE decided to build a physical-hydraulic model of the basin, in which to perform some experiments on the effects of a landslide fall in a reservoir.

The 1: 200 scale model of the basin, which can still be visited today, was set up at the SADE hydroelectric plant in Nove (Borgo Botteon di Vittorio Veneto), and became the Hydraulic Models Centre. The experiments were entrusted to professors Ghetti and Marzolo, university professors of the Institute of Hydraulics and Hydraulic Constructions of the University of Padua, and were carried out with funding of SADE, under the control of the study office of the company itself.

The study aimed to verify the hydraulic effects on the dam and on the banks of the landslide reservoir, so was directed in this sense rather than reproducing the natural phenomenon of the landslide. The experiments were carried out in two different series (August–September 1961 and January–April 1962), of which the first served substantially to refine the model.

=== First set of experiments ===
The first series of five experiments began on 30 August 1961, with a sliding surface of the flat landslide inclined by 30°, consisting of a wooden plank covered with a sheet. The sliding mass was simulated with gravel, held in place by flexible metal nets, which were initially held in position by ropes that were then suddenly released. At the beginning of September, another four tests were carried out intended for orientation purposes. The first always with a 30° inclined plane, the following three with a 42° inclined plane. Having found it impossible to reproduce the natural geological phenomenon of the landslide in the model, the model was elaborated by modifying the movement surface of the landslide, which was replaced with a masonry one (the relative profiles were elaborated by Semenza, who also used the surveys that had already been carried out and that had provided sufficient elements of judgment in this sense), to make it possible to vary the speed of the landslide fall into the reservoir (made difficult by the new &quot;back&quot; shape of the movement surface). To simulate the compactness of the moving material (which in the model remained the gravel), rigid sectors were inserted that were towed by ropes pulled by a tractor.

=== Second set of experiments ===
In the second set of 17 experiments, conducted from 3 January 1962, to 24 April 1962, the &quot;collapsing&quot; material was still gravel, this time held in place by hemp nets and cords. Starting from the Muller hypothesis relating to the different characteristics of the mass moving between the downstream part of the Massalezza stream (west) and the upstream part of the same (east), all the experiments were performed by making those two hypothetical parts of the landslide descend separately. In the model, however, the two landslides were initially made to descend at different times, so that their effects were totally separate, and subsequently, when the wave produced by the first came back, so as to obtain a total increase in the water of the even greater lake.

=== Final Ghetti report ===
The total increase of the water in the tank (measured by means of special instruments) was broken down into &quot;static increase&quot;, which was the nontransient effect of increasing the level of the water left in the tank after the landslide due to the immersion of the landslide in the tank (once the state of rest is reached again), and in &quot;dynamic boost&quot;, due to the temporary wave motion produced by the landslide. The static increase depended on the volume of the landslide that remained immersed in the tank, while the dynamic boost depended almost exclusively on the speed of the landslide fall (while it was negligibly linked to the volume of the same).

Based on this simulation (following the disaster object of criticism, as considered approximate by some), placing a reservoir limit at an altitude of predicted that no damage would occur above above mean sea level along the banks of the reservoir, while a minimum quantity of water would have exceeded the edge of the dam (), causing negligible damage downstream of the same.

:With the reported experiences, carried out on a 1:200 scale model of the Vajont lake-reservoir, we tried to provide an evaluation of the effects that will be caused by a landslide, which is possible to occur on the left bank upstream of the dam. . Given that the extreme limit downstream of the landslide is more than 75 m from the embankment of the dam, and that the formation of this embankment is of compact and consistent rock and well distinct, even geologically, from the aforementioned mass, it is absolutely not to be fear of any static perturbation to the dam with the occurrence of the landslide, and therefore only the effects of the wave rise in the lake and in the overflow on the dam crest as a consequence of the fall are to be considered.
==Landslide and wave==


The alarming rate of movement of the landslide had not slowed as a result of lowering the water level, although the water had been lowered to what SADE believed was a safe level to contain the displacement wave should a catastrophic landslide occur. On 9 October 1963, engineers witnessed trees falling and rocks rolling down into the reservoir where the predicted landslide would take place. With a major landslide now seeming imminent, engineers gathered at the site that evening to witness the tsunami which, when it happened, killed 60 workers.

At 10:39 pm, a massive landslide, with around of trees, earth, and rock, collapsed from the northern flank of Monte Toc into the lake below at up to (another source gives ), generating a seismic shock. In 20 seconds it reached the water level; by 45 seconds the landslide (now at rest) had completely filled the Vajont reservoir. The impact displaced of water in about 25 seconds, of which overtopped the dam in a wave.

Impact of the landslip with the water generated three waves. One went upwards, reached the houses of Casso, fell back onto the landslide, and travelled onwards to dig the basin of the pond of Massalezza. Another wave headed toward the shores of the lake, and by washout action, destroyed some localities in the municipality of Erto e Casso. The third wave (containing about of water) rose over the edge of the dam, which remained intact except for the roadway that led to the left side of the Vajont, and fell into the narrow valley below the dam.

The roughly of water that climbed over the dam reached the stony shore of the Piave Valley and swept up substantial debris, which poured into the southern sector of Longarone and destroyed the town except for the town hall, the houses north of it, and other neighboring towns. The death toll was about 2,000 people (official data speak of 1,917 victims, but determining an accurate number with certainty is impossible).

Firefighters who set out from Belluno, after reports of the raising of the level of the Piave, could not reach the location, since from a certain point onwards, the road coming from the valley had been completely swept away. Longarone was reached by firefighters who departed Pieve di Cadore, who were the first to realize what had happened and were able to communicate it. At 5:30 am on 10 October 1963, the first soldiers of the Italian Army arrived to bring relief and recover the dead. The soldiers involved were mostly Alpini, some of whom belonged to the combat engineers, who dug by hand to seek the bodies of the missing. They also found safes of the banks of the country, no longer able to be opened with normal keys, as they were damaged. The firefighters from 46 Provincial Commands also participated in the rescue, with 850 men, including divers, land and helicopter teams, and many vehicles and equipment. The Nucleo Sommozzatori of Genoa, with eight personnel, were used in the basin in front of the Busche Dam, to dredge for bodies and drums of toxic substances (61 cyanide drums), with subsequent patrol by immersion and final removal of sludge when the basin was dry. Of the nearly 2,000 fatalities, only 1,500 bodies were recovered and recomposed, of which half were beyond identification.

In the Piave Valley the wave destroyed the villages of Longarone, Pirago, Rivalta, Villanova, and Faè, killing approximately 2,000 people and turning the land below the dam into a flat expanse of mud with an impact crater deep and wide. Many small villages near the landslide along the lakefront suffered damage from a giant displacement wave. Villages in the territory of Erto e Casso and the village of , near Castellavazzo, were largely destroyed.

Estimates of the dead range from the official estimate of 1,917 to 2,500 people. About 350 families lost all family members. Most of the survivors had lost relatives and friends along with their homes and belongings. The dam itself was largely undamaged. The top or so of masonry was washed away, but the basic structure remained intact and is standing today.

==Causes and responsibility==

Immediately after the disaster, the government (which owned the dam), politicians, and public authorities insisted on attributing the tragedy to an unexpected and unavoidable natural event. The debate in the newspapers was heavily influenced by politics. The paper &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot;, the mouthpiece of the Partito Comunista Italiano (PCI), was the first to denounce the actions of the management and government, as it had previously carried a number of articles by addressing the behaviour of the SADE management in the Vajont project and elsewhere. Indro Montanelli, then the most influential Italian journalist and a vocal anticommunist, attacked &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; and denied any human responsibility; &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot; and the PCI were dubbed &quot;jackals, speculating on pain and on the dead&quot; in many articles by &quot;La Domenica del Corriere&quot; and a national campaign poster paid for by the Christian Democracy, the party of Prime Minister Giovanni Leone. They attributed the catastrophe only to natural causes and God&#x27;s will.

The campaign accused the PCI of sending agitprops into the refugee communities, as relief personnel; most of them were partisans from Emilia Romagna who fought on Mount Toc in the Second World War and often had friends in the stricken area. The Christian Democracy accused the Communist Party of &quot;political profiteering&quot; from the tragedy. Leone promised to bring justice to the people killed in the disaster. A few months after he lost the premiership, he became the head of SADE&#x27;s team of lawyers, who significantly reduced the amount of compensation for the survivors and ruled out payment for at least 600 victims.
The DC&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;La Discussione&quot;, called the disaster &quot;a mysterious act of God&#x27;s love&quot;, in an article that drew sharp criticism from &quot;l&#x27;Unità&quot;. Apart from journalistic attacks and the attempted cover-up from news sources aligned with the government, flaws in the geological assessments have been proven, with disregard of warnings about the likelihood of a disaster by SADE, ENEL, and the government. The trial was moved to L&#x27;Aquila, in Abruzzo, by the judges who heard the preliminary trial, thus preventing public participation, and resulted in lenient sentencing for a handful of the SADE and ENEL engineers. One SADE engineer (Mario Pancini) committed suicide in 1968. The government never sued SADE for damage compensation.

Subsequent engineering analysis has focused on the cause of the landslide, and debate continues about the contribution of rainfall, dam level changes, and earthquakes as triggers of the landslide, as well as differing views about whether it was an old landslide that slipped further or a completely new one. A number of problems existed with the choice of site for the dam and reservoir; the canyon was steep-sided, the river had undercut its banks, and the limestone and claystone rocks that made up the walls of the canyon were interbedded with the slippery, clay-like Lias and Dogger Jurassic-period horizons and the Cretaceous-period Malm horizon, all of which were inclined towards the axis of the canyon. In addition, the limestone layers contained many solution caverns that became only more saturated because of rains in September. Prior to the landslide that caused the overtopping flood, the downhill creep of the regolith had been per week. In September, this creep reached per day until finally, the day before the landslide, the creep was measured at .

==Reconstruction==
Most of the survivors were moved into a newly built village, Vajont, southeast on the Tagliamento River plain. Those who insisted on returning to their mountain life in Erto e Casso were strongly discouraged. Longarone and other villages in the Piave Valley were rebuilt with modern houses and farms. The government used the disaster to promote the industrialization of northeastern Italy. Survivors were entitled to &quot;business start-up&quot; loans, public subsidies, and 10 years of tax exemption, all of which they could &quot;sell on&quot; to major companies from the Venice region. These concessions were then converted into millions of lira for industrial plants elsewhere. Among the corporations were Zanussi (now owned by Electrolux), Ceramica Dolomite (now owned by American Standard), Confezioni SanRemo, and SAVIC (now owned by Italcementi).

Compensation measures did not clearly differentiate between victims and people who lived nearby; thus, much of the compensation went to people who had suffered little damage, creating a negative public image. A pumping station was installed in the dam basin to keep the lake at a constant level, and the bypass gallery was lengthened beyond the dam to let the water flow down to the Piave Valley. The dam wall is still in place and maintained, but no plans exist to exploit it for electric power. The reservoir behind the dam, now dry and filled with landslip, has been open to visitors since 2002.

==The dam today and memorials==
In recent years, revival of interest has occurred both by researchers with specialist interest and sightseers. The dam, now owned by ENEL, was partially opened to the public in 2002 with guided tours and access to the walkway along the top and other locations. In September 2006, an annual noncompetitive track event, called &quot;Paths of Remembrance&quot;, was inaugurated, which allows participants to access some locations inside the mountain. On 12 February 2008, in launching the International Year of Planet Earth, UNESCO cited the Vajont Dam tragedy as one of five &quot;cautionary tales&quot; caused by &quot;the failure of engineers and geologists&quot;.

For 2013, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the disaster, the region of Venice set aside one million euros for safety works and recovery of tunnels inside the mountain, which were part of the Colomber Road (the old national road 251). The memorial church in Longarone—constructed in spite of the strong opposition of the surviving parish priest — was built by architect Giovanni Michelucci.

==In the media==
After the initial worldwide reporting, the tragedy became regarded as part of the price of economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s. Interest was rejuvenated by a 1997 television program by Marco Paolini and , &quot;Il racconto del Vajont&quot;. In 2001, a docudrama about the disaster was released. A joint production of Italian and French companies, it was titled &quot;Vajont—La diga del disonore&quot; (&quot;Vajont—The Dam of Dishonour&quot;) in Italy, and &quot;La Folie des hommes&quot; (&quot;The Madness of Men&quot;) in France. It stars Michel Serrault and Daniel Auteuil. The tragedy was included in the 2008 documentary series &quot;Disasters of the Century&quot;.

The TV show &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; featured the event in episode two, &quot;Mountain Tsunami&quot;, of its fifth season in 2012. In 2013, the 11th stage of the Giro d&#x27;Italia finished in Vajont to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the disaster. In March 2018, the dam and the disaster were also covered in season two, episode one (&quot;Armageddon Highway&quot;) of Science Channel&#x27;s &quot;Mysteries of the Abandoned.&quot;

<text>The Kulin nation is an alliance of five Aboriginal nations in the south of Australia - up into the Great Dividing Range and the Loddon and Goulburn River valleys - which shares Culture and Language.

==History==
Before British colonisation, the tribes spoke five related languages. These languages are spoken by two groups: the eastern Kulin group of Woiwurrung–Taungurung, Boonwurrung and Ngurai-illam-wurrung; and the western language group of just Wadawurrung.

The central Victoria area has been inhabited for an estimated 42,000 years before European settlement. At the time of British settlement in the 1830s, the collective populations of the Woiwurrung, Boonwurrung and Wadawurrung tribes of the Kulin nation was estimated to be under 20,000. The Kulin lived by fishing, cultivating murnong (also called yam daisy; &quot;Microseris&quot;) as well as hunting and gathering, and made a sustainable living from the rich food sources of Port Phillip and the surrounding grasslands.

Due to the upheaval and disturbances from British settlement from the 1830s on, there is limited physical evidence of the Kulin peoples&#x27; collective past. However, there is a small number of registered sites of cultural and spiritual significance in the Melbourne area.

==People==
* Woiwurrung (Woy-wur-rung) – the Wurundjeri people
* Boonwurrung – the Boonwurrung people
* Wathaurong (Wath-er-rung) – the Wathaurong people
* Taungurung (Tung-ger-rung) – the Taungurung people
* Dja Dja Wurrung (Jar-Jar-Wur-rung) – the Djadjawurrung or Djaara people

At certain times of the year, these nations would meet at Yarra Falls to settle disputes, to trade, and to hold corroborees.

===Diplomacy===
When foreign people passed through or were invited onto tribal lands, the ceremony of tanderrum – freedom of the bush – was performed. This was intended to allow for safe passage and temporary access and use of land and resources by foreign people. It was a diplomatic rite involving the landholder&#x27;s hospitality and a ritual exchange of gifts.

<doc id="679602" wikidata="Q2409697" url="?curid=679602" title="The Beautiful Game (musical)">
<text>The Beautiful Game (sometimes performed as The Boys in the Photograph) is a musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber and Ben Elton about a group of teenagers growing up during The Troubles in Belfast, Northern Ireland in 1969.

The title of the musical (&quot;The Beautiful Game&quot;) is a commonly used reference to association football, the origins of which are disputed. The plot, which is centred on a local football (soccer) team, focuses on the attempt to overcome the violence that has engulfed their community. The Catholic team has one atheist player, Del (who comes from a Protestant family) and the coach is a priest. The musical chronicles some of the key players during the emerging political and religious violence. Some of the players become IRA volunteers, and another is knee-capped. The musical also chronicles the emotional change in the protagonist from political ambivalence to becoming an IRA volunteer.

The most successful song from the score was &quot;Our Kind of Love&quot;, which had originally been performed by Kiri Te Kanawa as &quot;The Heart Is Slow to Learn&quot;. It was cut from the re-worked version of the show in 2008, and used as the title song to Lloyd Webber&#x27;s sequel to &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, &quot;Love Never Dies&quot;.

==Production history==
In 1998, Lloyd Webber invited Elton to dinner to discuss the possibility of the latter working on a rewrite of the script for &quot;Starlight Express&quot;, updating the humour of the original. Elton declined but suggested the possibility of a new musical, with an entirely original storyline, having observed that most musicals were based upon existing ideas. The two writers settled upon the idea of setting a story amid The Troubles in Belfast.

The world premiere of &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; opened on 26 September 2000 at the Cambridge Theatre in London and closed 1 September 2001, after a total run of slightly more than 11 months. The production featured Josie Walker, David Shannon, Ben Goddard, Hannah Waddingham, Alex Sharpe and Michael Shaeffer in leading roles. Dianne Pilkington and Shonagh Daly were ensemble members. It was directed by Robert Carsen with choreography by Australian choreographer Meryl Tankard. 

The show was met with a mixed reception from the critics: while the production and Lloyd Webber&#x27;s score were largely praised, Elton&#x27;s book and lyrics came under fire for being crass, predictable and undistinguished although John Peter in his review in The Sunday Times wrote &quot;Elton&#x27;s book and lyrics burst with energy, indignation and intelligence. Brave and bitterly truthful...this show...need not fear comparison with &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Offhand, I cannot think of greater praise&quot;. The show never made it to Broadway.

A rewrite by Lloyd-Webber and Elton, with the new title &quot;The Boys in the Photograph&quot;, received a workshop production by students at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts in April 2008, directed by Nick Phillips. Subsequently, in April 2009 a full-scale production was presented at the Manitoba Theatre Centre in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. This production transferred to the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in September 2009. The rewrite gave a more uplifting ending than in the original production.

In February 2012, Northern Ireland youth group Fusion Theatre produced the show for the first time in its native Northern Ireland. Directed by Ian Milford with choreography by Rebecca Leonard, the cross-community youth chorus performed it for a week-long run. The show was attended by representatives of Lloyd Webber&#x27;s Really Useful Group. The company took the show to compete at the Waterford Festival of Light Opera in Ireland in May 2012.

The original production&#x27;s choreographer, Meryl Tankard, directed and choreographed the Australian premiere at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts in August 2016, performed by 3rd year students there.

A new production performed by the National Youth Music Theatre students had a limited run at the Other Palace in London on 15–18 August 2018. 

In September 2019, Manilla Street Productions staged the professional Australian premiere in Melbourne at Chapel Off Chapel. Directed by Karen Jemison, it starred Stephanie Wall and Stephen Mahy.

Although being based in Northern Ireland, &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; has only been performed there twice, by two amateur theatre companies, the first being Fusion Theatre Lisburn in 2012 and the second time being Belvoir Players in 2023.

==Synopsis==

===&quot;The Beautiful Game&quot;===
Act One

Football is part of everyday life in 1960s and 1970s Northern Ireland, as the overture and opening number (&quot;The Beautiful Game&quot;) demonstrate. It is especially important for Father O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s team, who are having their first practice on the first day of the season. The star player, John Kelly, seems to be a little more interested in one of the girls on the sidelines than he is in the priest, and as a punishment is forced to stay behind and take care of the equipment (&quot;Clean the Kit&quot;). Meanwhile, Thomas, a fervent Irish Catholic nationalist leads a group of thugs to force Del off the team. Mary, the girl John had been noticing during the practice, comes to the locker room to talk to him. Although they initially fight their attraction (Don&#x27;t Like You), they soon decide to give it a try.

Time passes. John and Mary are quite serious with each other now. She asks him one evening to join her in a civil rights march but he is more interested in going drinking with his friends. Left alone, Mary is unable to understand why anyone would not love Ireland and want to make it better. Her sentiments are echoed - almost - by a girl with the rival Protestant team (&quot;God&#x27;s Own Country&quot;). John changes his mind and returns to go to the march with Mary, because she is more important to him (&quot;God&#x27;s Own Country&quot;, &quot;Protestant March&quot;).

The team makes it to the final, but their celebration is cut short when a group of Protestants trash the locker room. Christine and Del emerge to find the wreckage - they had been making love in hiding during the raid. Surveying the mess, they both wish all the fighting would stop so they could get on with their lives (&quot;Let Us Love in Peace&quot;).

It comes down to the final. After the other team tied the goal on a penalty shot, John scores the winning goal (&quot;The Final&quot;). The boys celebrate at a local pub (&quot;Off to the Party, The Craic&quot;). Del comes to see Christine, but Thomas and his friends quickly remind him that he isn&#x27;t welcome. Rather than causing any more unpleasantness, he leaves. Meanwhile, Ginger has finally got up the nerve to speak to Bernadette, who returns his affection (&quot;Don&#x27;t Like You Reprise&quot;). They have a first, small kiss, and then she has to go, and Ginger helps Daniel home. After seeing him to his door, Ginger is about to head home himself when he&#x27;s confronted by a gang of Protestant thugs. He attempts, unsuccessfully, to escape.

Christine and Mary are discussing the previous evening at Mary&#x27;s house. Mary disapproves of the relationship with Del until Christine convinces her that love knows no boundaries (&quot;Our Kind of Love&quot;). They are interrupted by John who brings the horrible news - Ginger is dead. Thomas arrives and asks John to go with them to get revenge, but he refuses - more violence won&#x27;t do any good. As they comfort each other and go to the funeral, they all long for an end to the division and for a chance to live a normal life (&quot;Let Us Love in Peace Reprise&quot;).

Act Two

John and Mary are getting married, and there are some nerves on all sides (&quot;The Happiest Day&quot;). When the time comes to make their vows though, there are no doubts (&quot;To Have and to Hold&quot;). Finally, they are left alone in their hotel room for their first night together. Both are nervous, but together they work it out (&quot;The First Time&quot;).

In the middle of the night, the phone rings. It&#x27;s Thomas, in trouble. He asks for John&#x27;s help. Mary doesn&#x27;t want him to go, but John feels he owes it to his friend even though he doesn&#x27;t agree with what he&#x27;s doing. He finally finds Thomas and tells him it&#x27;s the only time he&#x27;ll ever do something like this. Thomas tries to explain to him why he has to do what he does (&quot;I&#x27;d Rather Die on My Feet Than Live on My Knees&quot;). John is finally going to get his big break at the football trials. On her way to watch, Mary says goodbye to Christine and Del, who are moving to New York to escape the situation there. Mary figures she and John will go to England, and they talk about leaving their home (&quot;God&#x27;s Own Country Reprise&quot;). John makes a great impression and the coaches want him, but someone else wants him too - the police. Someone has tipped them off and he is taken to prison, before Mary even has a chance to tell him that she&#x27;s pregnant (&quot;The Selection&quot;).

John is put with the other IRA prisoners. He tries to stay apart from them, but they work away at him and eventually he begins to think like them. Even Mary has trouble getting through to him. (&quot;Dead Zone&quot;). She has her baby, a boy named Sean, and Daniel comes over to visit. While he&#x27;s there, Thomas and two other IRA agents barge in and accuse Daniel of betraying John. They shoot him in the knee, crippling him. Mary is horrified and wonders if any good could possibly come out of all this violence (&quot;If This is What We&#x27;re Fighting For&quot;). John is finally released, and his first stop is to see Thomas, because he has realized that it was Thomas who turned him over to the police. After confronting him, John kills him.

Mary enters. She tries to find the man within John that she fell in love with, but he is buried too deep. John is going to England to work for the IRA. He leaves his soccer jersey and a picture of the championship team for his son (&quot;All the Love I Have&quot;). As Father O&#x27;Donnell comes to collect Sean for the football practice, Mary hopes that the cycle of hate can be stopped with her son (&quot;Finale&quot;).

===&quot;The Boys in the Photograph&quot;===
Act One

&quot;The Boys in the Photograph&quot; begins with Mary, Christine and Bernadette singing the titular number (&quot;The Boys in the Photograph&quot;) in front of a monochrome photograph of the Belfast soccer team that is the focus of the play. After this the majority of the casts join in a number about the importance of soccer or football in the lives of the young people of Belfast, Northern Ireland which is currently on the brink of a cultural war. After this Father O&#x27;Donnell begins the roll call for the football team including: John Kelly, the team&#x27;s star player who is more interested in showing off in front of girls than practicing seriously; Thomas Malloy, John&#x27;s best friend, who is more driven, a fervent Catholic nationalist who wears glasses (which need to be taped to his head while playing and are referred to multiple times during the play); Del Copeland, the only Protestant on the team (who states he is an atheist); Daniel Gillen, who has a reputation of stealing radios from cars (though he argues that with so many riots taking place it only makes sense to steal the radios before the cars are burnt), and Ginger O&#x27;Shaughnessy, who wants the conflicts between Protestants and Catholics to end and to be called by his real name (Gregory). We also meet Mary a bright out-spoken young woman who believes that the conflict can be resolved through peaceful protests; Bernadette, a very religious and prudent girl who has been in love with Ginger since they were children; and Christine, who defies her Catholic up-bringing not only by going with several boys but also by the man she marries later on.

After the practice Father O&#x27;Donnell gives each member of the team a copy of the team photograph along with the lecture to &quot;…Never forget the promise of your youth. This picture is who you are, who you become is up to you&quot;. He puts John on equipment cleaning duty, much to John&#x27;s annoyance (&quot;Cleaning Kit&quot;). While John is imagining his future as the star player for a national team, Mary walks in and tells him that he&#x27;ll never make a national team since he spends too much time chasing girls. Father O&#x27;Donnell then enters the locker room and tells John that the reason he&#x27;s harder on him is because he believes that John could be great if he focuses on his game and that there will be plenty of time for girls once he&#x27;s famous and can have any kind of girl he wants (to the disgust of Mary, who is hiding nearby as girls aren&#x27;t allowed in the locker room). John and Mary further argue with each other (&quot;Don&#x27;t Like You&quot;) and eventually grow close and fall in love. Meanwhile, Thomas, along with a couple of nameless teammates, threaten Del with violence if he comes to practice again. (Thomas has no tolerance for Protestants after one beat up his sister; this also provides a hint of things to come).

Eventually Mary and John are in a steady relationship with one another and although at first he does not want to join her in civil rights demonstrations, being more interested in having fun with his teammates leaving Mary disappointed, not only with John but with her neighbours&#x27; defeatist attitude (&quot;God&#x27;s Own Country/God&#x27;s Own Country&quot;, &quot;Protestant March&quot;). John eventually comes around and decides that he at least should be there for Mary. Meanwhile, Christine and Del have had their own romantic encounter having both taken shelter in an abandoned car during a raid and discovering that despite their different backgrounds that they have a lot in common (&quot;Born In Belfast&quot;).

Eventually the final game of the season comes and the team has a chance to win the championship (&quot;The Final&quot;), and despite Thomas being caught by the referee for tripping a member of the other team giving them a penalty kick, John manages to score the winning goal. After their victory the team and their supporters go celebrate at the local pub (&quot;Off To The Party&quot;/&quot;The Craic&quot;). Del and Christine also go to the party though Thomas makes it clear that they aren&#x27;t welcome while John wonders where he&#x27;s been all season and despite Christine&#x27;s insistence that Del has as much of a right to be there as any other member of the team, Del insists that they should leave to avoid causing any trouble. At the same time Ginger and Bernadette begin to realize their feelings for each other, their shared wishes for peace and kiss for the first time (&quot;Let Us Love In Peace&quot;). However, after the party Ginger helps Daniel home and on the way back to his own home, is mortally wounded by a gang of young Protestants and is unable to get away.

Meanwhile, the girls are gathered at one of their homes and discussing the evening and their relationships when they receive news that Ginger has been killed and was found miles away from where he went missing. At the funeral Thomas wants to go get revenge for Ginger&#x27;s death but is talked out of it when he is reminded that he does not know which Protestant boys are to blame and that if he were to attack some random boys that he would be no better than they are.

Act Two

The second act begins with John and Mary&#x27;s wedding day and both are nervous about committing to marry (&quot;The Happiest Day of Our Lives&quot;) but manage to get through the ceremony. Later the two are alone and spending their first night alone together in a hotel and looking back on their relationship so far (&quot;All The Love I Have&quot;/&quot;Don&#x27;t Like You&quot; - reprise) and are nervous to be having their first intercourse, but eventually do manage to overcome the feelings of awkwardness (&quot;The First Time&quot;). Later that night they receive a phone call from Thomas who is wanted for his IRA activities, and while trying to reach a safe house has lost his glasses. Although Mary protests that he could be arrested also for helping Thomas or even killed, John insists that he can&#x27;t leave his friend and that this will be the only time he does this. John eventually finds Thomas and drives him to the safe house while the two make it clear to the other that they don&#x27;t understand their stance on the issue (&quot;I&#x27;d Rather Die On My Feet Than Live On My Knees&quot;).

Some time later John is finally getting the chance to try out for a national team and is making a great impression on the team scouts. Meanwhile, Mary is saying good bye to Christine, Del and their baby son Hendrix who are moving overseas (God&#x27;s Own Country-Reprise) and reveals to Christine that she is going to have a child of her own soon, but is waiting until after John&#x27;s tryouts to tell him. Unfortunately she doesn&#x27;t get the chance to tell him until much later as he&#x27;s arrested after the tryouts for helping Thomas escape. John is then sent to prison after other IRA prisoners act as if he were one of them. He explains that he is not an IRA volunteer and was only arrested because he tried to help a friend while the other agents tell him the only friends he has now are his prison-mates. As John adjusts to prison life while waiting to be released, he becomes more and more frustrated with the world that has failed him (&quot;The Dead Zone&quot;).

Eventually Mary has her child, a son Sean. One night Thomas (whom Mary recognizes immediately, due to his glasses) enters her home with other IRA members and tells her that Daniel, who is sitting in the living room, is the one who reported John to the authorities. Daniel argues that he would never do such a thing, but despite support from Mary and Bernadette, is still taken outside and kneecapped (&quot;If This Is What We&#x27;re Fighting For&quot;). Eventually John is released from prison, but has been radicalized and wants to go to England on an IRA mission. After John gives her his football jersey for their son, Mary gives John a copy of the team photograph telling him that before he goes to England to remember that his true self was his first victim.

Although he still goes to &quot;take care of some business&quot;, John does remember what Father O&#x27;Donnell said when he gave them the photo but still tracks down Thomas, having noticed while in jail how suspicious it was that Thomas wasn&#x27;t arrested. Thomas then reveals that he has managed to stay out of jail by reporting others and that he no longer cares if he dies or not since the cycle of violence is endless and he has more than replaced himself with angry men (&quot;It Will Never End&quot;). John is poised to shoot Thomas but in the end he takes Mary&#x27;s comment to heart and puts his gun away telling the other man &quot;I could shoot the man you&#x27;ve become, but I can&#x27;t shoot the man you were&quot; and leaves. Thomas bids his last farewell to John, knowing that he probably won&#x27;t live long. As John leaves a gunshot is heard off stage.

Meanwhile, Mary is sitting at home, looking at her copy of the team photograph and looking back on the fates of most of the boys, when John arrives having remembered who he really is (&quot;All The Love I Have&quot;). Then the finale begins (&quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; finale) and the screen that had been used throughout the play reveals the bright futures that awaited everyone including John, who, despite his not making the national team did become the coach of his school&#x27;s team. Sean grew up hating football and went into fine arts while his younger sister did make a national team and that the division did eventually end after 30 years.

<text>Walter Weir Wilson Donaldson (2 February 1907 – 24 May 1973) was a Scottish professional snooker and billiards player. He contested eight consecutive world championship finals against Fred Davis from 1947 to 1954, and won the title in 1947 and 1950. Donaldson was known for his long and his consistency when playing, and had an aversion to the use of . In 2012, he was inducted posthumously into the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association&#x27;s World Snooker Hall of Fame.

Donaldson became a professional player shortly after winning the under-16&#x27;s British Junior English Billiards Championship in 1922 and won the Scottish professional billiards title six times. He first competed in the World Snooker Championship in 1933, but after a heavy defeat by Joe Davis did not enter again until 1939. After serving in the Fourth Indian Division during World War II, Donaldson entered the 1946 World Championship, where he lost to Davis in his first match. As a player that did not reach the championship final, he was eligible to enter the 1946 Albany Club Professional Snooker Tournament, which he won. Following Joe Davis&#x27;s retirement from the World Championship in 1946, Donaldson practised intensively and won the 1947 Championship by defeating Fred Davis in the final. Davis won the following two championships, with Donaldson taking the next and then being runner-up to Davis for the next four years. Donaldson then retired from World Championship competition, although he continued to play in the &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament until 1959.

==Early life==
Walter Weir Wilson Donaldson was born in Edinburgh, on 2 February 1907, the son of a billiard hall manager. The family moved to Coatbridge when Donaldson was five. His father coached him in English billiards from age five, having constructed a platform around one of the billiard tables so that the younger Donaldson could reach the table to play. Donaldson told an interviewer for &quot;The Billiard Player&quot; in 1939 that starting to play at a young age was a common feature among many professional players, as &quot;when a kiddie is brought up like that, the game gets fairly into his bones, and he has much more chance than other people of becoming a good player&quot;. His father also trained Margaret Lennan, who became the unofficial &quot;British Isles Champion&quot; of women&#x27;s billiards in 1928. Donaldson won the under-16 division of the British Junior English Billiards Championship in 1922 at the age of 15, and turned professional the following year.

==Career==
===Early professional career===
Donaldson moved to Rotherham in South Yorkshire, where he managed a billiard hall, and travelled to Glasgow to win the Scottish professional billiards and snooker championships in the 1928/1929 season. He later became the owner of a billiard hall in New Ollerton, Nottinghamshire. He first entered the World Snooker Championship in 1933 defeating Willie Leigh 13 to 11 before losing 1–13 in the semi-finals to Joe Davis. In 1939, Donaldson said he realised from watching Davis &quot;annihilate&quot; him that &quot;there was far more in the game than I had ever dreamt of&quot;. He did not participate in the championship again until 1939. His six-year absence has been attributed to a commitment to practise and improve his standard of play following the resounding defeat by Davis. In 1939, he defeated Herbert Holt and Dickie Laws in the qualifying competition, both 18–13, then Claude Falkiner 21–10 in the first round, before losing 15–16 to Sidney Smith in the quarter-finals. He finished fourth of seven players in the 1939/1940 &quot;Daily Mail&quot; Gold Cup. The BBC World Service radio station broadcast part of his match against Fred Davis.

Donaldson spoke about his playing philosophy in 1939, saying he avoided playing risky shots because he believed matches were typically lost by one player making errors: &quot;It isn&#x27;t so much that one man wins the game but that the other man loses it.&quot; Asked by the interviewer for hints for &quot;The Billiard Player&quot;″s readers to help them improve their standard of play, Donaldson advised against the use of as &quot;it spoils the shot in at least 90 per cent of cases when it&#x27;s applied by any but a first class player. And generally it really isn&#x27;t necessary.&quot; He also said he had claimed the title of Scottish snooker champion because despite issuing an invitation to any challenger to play for that title, no-one had taken up the challenge.

In the 1940 World Championship, he eliminated Holt 24–7 in the first round; Joe Davis then defeated him 9–22 in the semi-final. The championship was suspended for the remainder of World War II. Donaldson was called up in 1940, and served in Canada, North Africa, Greece and Italy as a sergeant in the Royal Corps of Signals attached to the Fourth Indian Division, which was an original component of the Eighth Army when it was formed in September 1941.

The championship resumed in 1946, with Joe Davis winning again, including a 21–10 victory over Donaldson in the quarter-finals. The professional players that did not reach the 1946 final were invited to participate in the 1946 Albany Club Professional Snooker Tournament. Donaldson won, some six months after being demobilised, by defeating Alec Brown 20–11 in the final. Following his 1946 World Championship win, Davis retired from the event. In November 1946, Donaldson compiled what would have been a new world record for the highest break, 142, against John Pulman, but as the billiard table being used was not of the standard type required for a record, it was not recognised as such.

===World championship finals and later professional career===
Donaldson practised intensively in preparation for the 1947 World Snooker Championship, using a billiard table in a neighbour&#x27;s attic. He defeated Stanley Newman 46–25 and then eliminated Horace Lindrum 39–32 to reach the final. Building refurbishment delays postponed the final, held at Leicester Square Hall, for several weeks. Donaldson used the time to continue practising. In a two-week final over 145 frames against Fred Davis, Donaldson led 4–2 after the first and 7–5 after the second, later extending his lead to sixteen frames at 35–19. After this, Davis won six successive frames to reduce the lead to 35–25. Donaldson secured victory at 73–49 and finished the match at 82–63. His tactics during the championship involved compiling breaks of around 30 to 50 points, and playing rather than attempting difficult . Davis became frustrated with the lack of scoring chances Donaldson left for him, and missed a number of difficult pot attempts allowing Donaldson chances to win frames. There were three century breaks during the match&#x27;s 145 frames, all made by Davis. Joe Davis commented after the match that, &quot;Donaldson&#x27;s long potting at present is the equal of anything seen in snooker history,&quot; whilst Fred Davis said &quot;he is playing the best snooker I have ever seen&quot;. In his book &quot;Talking Snooker&quot;, first published in 1979, Fred Davis reflected that he had probably been &quot;perhaps overconfident&quot; and also had not expected Donaldson&#x27;s standard to have improved so much as a result of his many hours of practice. This was the first of eight consecutive finals, from 1947 to 1954, featuring the two players.

Two wins by Joe Davis in challenge matches against Donaldson after the 1947 championship reinforced the public perception that the 15-time champion Davis was still the best player. Donaldson took a playing break of several months on medical advice, having been diagnosed with conjunctivitis after experiencing headaches. In the 1948 World Snooker Championship, held only six months after the 1947 tournament, Donaldson reached the final with wins against Kingsley Kennerley and Albert Brown. Fred Davis won 84–61 against Donaldson, having reached a winning margin at 73–52. In &quot;Talking Snooker&quot;, Davis wrote that he had consciously used the same risk-averse tactics that had paid off for Donaldson in 1947. At the 1948 &quot;Sunday Empire News&quot; Tournament, which was a round-robin event with handicaps applied, Donaldson finished fourth of five players.

In the 1949 World Snooker Championship final, Fred Davis won 80–65 against Donaldson, having taken a winning lead of 73–58 on the previous day. The score had been 63–58 before Davis won 10 frames in a row to take the title. Donaldson made the highest break of the tournament with 115 on the last day of his semi-final match against Pulman. In the handicapped 1949/1950 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament, Donaldson won only two of his seven round-robin matches and placed seventh out of the eight participants.

Donaldson defeated Kennerley and Albert Brown to reach the 1950 world final against Fred Davis. the final was played over 97 frames. Davis led 8–4 after the first day, but after two more days Donaldson levelled the match at 18–18, including winning five of the last six that day. He took a four-frame lead the following day, and maintained it for several days, eventually extending it to six frames at 45–39 on the penultimate day. Donaldson&#x27;s victory was confirmed on the last day when the score was 49–32, with the match ending at 51–46. Almost 3,000 spectators watched one session of the match in Blackpool. &quot;The Billiard Player&quot; magazine attributed Donaldson&#x27;s success to his strong safety play and a below-par performance from Davis. The highest break Donaldson achieved during the match was 80, with Davis&#x27;s highest break 79. A column in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, after the final, commented that, &quot;So afraid were Fred Davis and Walter Donaldson ... of making any rash move which would cost them a frame that play was painfully slow at times.&quot;

With only one win from seven matches in the 1950/1951 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament, Donaldson finished joint-last. Donaldson and Fred Davis played the 1951 world final in Blackpool, again over 97 frames, in front of a record crowd for a World Snooker Championship match. From 6–6, Davis moved into a 12–6 lead, reaching a winning margin at 49–36 before the match concluded 58–39. Donaldson won half of his matches at the 1951/1952 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament, leading to a sixth-place ranking out of the nine players.

Following a dispute between the Professional Billiards Players&#x27; Association (PBPA) and the Billiards Association and Control Council (BA&amp;CC), which derived partly from the PBPA members feeling that the BA&amp;CC was taking too large a share of the income from tournaments, most professional players boycotted the 1952 World Snooker Championship and competed instead in their own 1952 World Professional Match-play Championship. As this event included most of the leading players, the public perceived it as the real world championship. The World Professional Match-play Championships are now accepted by snooker historians as part of the World Snooker Championship series. The 1952 World Professional Match-play Championship final featured Fred Davis and Donaldson and was contested across 73 frames. Davis won six of the eight frames in their first session, and led 7–5 after the first day. Donaldson had compiled a break of 104. Donaldson recorded another century break of 106 in the twentieth frame, but Davis increased his lead over him to 14–10 by the end of the second day. On the third day, Davis achieved a break of 140, a new World Championship record, and Donaldson made a 111. Davis finished the day 21–15 ahead. After another day&#x27;s play, Davis was 29–19 ahead, after which Donaldson won eight of the next twelve frames. Davis won the title, finishing the last day at 38–35.

The 1952/1953 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament finished in January 1953, with Donaldson&#x27;s three wins in eight matches enough to see him finish third. The 1953 World Professional Match-play Championship final in March saw Donaldson and Davis even at 6–6 after the first day of the 71-frame match. Donaldson took a 13–11 lead after day two, despite a break of 107 by Davis. Donaldson was ahead 20–16 after day three, but Davis tied the match at 24–24 after the fourth day which included a century of 102. Davis led 28–26, but Donaldson took a 31–29 lead at the end of the fifth day. The match was again level at 33–33 after the final afternoon session, before Davis won 37–34.

Donaldson placed seventh in the 1953/1954 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament, having lost five of his eight matches. In the 1954 World Professional Match-play Championship, Fred Davis and Donaldson met in their eighth successive final. It was the most one-sided of the finals, with Davis leading 33–15 after four days in the 71-frame contest. Even before losing the match, Donaldson said he would not enter the World Championship again because he could not give enough time to the practice he felt was necessary. Davis secured victory by winning the first three frames on the fifth day to lead 36–15. The final score was 45–26 with Donaldson making a break of 121 on the final day.

After the 1954 World Match-play final, Donaldson announced that he would not be playing in any future World Snooker Championships, as he wanted to focus more on the management of his smallholding, although he stated his intention to continue to play in other tournaments and in exhibition matches. With three wins at the 1954/1955 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament, he failed to gain a high placing. He finished third in 1955/1956, and last in 1956/1957. Donaldson inflicted Fred Davis&#x27;s only defeat in the 1957/1958 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament (21–16), before finishing third of five players in the final table. Earlier in the same tournament he defeated Joe Davis, also by 21–16, but had received a 14-point start. He did, however, make the highest break of the season, 141. He finished bottom of four players in the 1958 &quot;News of the World&quot; Snooker Tournament table, with one win in nine matches. In 1960, he retired completely from competitive play.

==Retirement and legacy==
Donaldson was married to Ida, whom he met whilst working in Rotherham in the 1920s. After retiring from the sport, he converted his snooker room into a , breaking up the slates from his billiard table to make a path, and preferred to play bowls rather than snooker. In 1971, he stood as a Conservative Party candidate for the Newport Pagnell Urban District council and was elected. He died in an ambulance on his way to hospital after suffering a heart attack at his home in Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, on 24 May 1973.

He was considered one of the greatest long potters of all time, and a very consistent player, partly due to his avoidance of the use of side. Joe Davis wrote of Donaldson in 1948 that: 

Fred Davis praised Donaldson&#x27;s potting ability and described him as a &quot;fierce competitor&quot; although &quot;very limited technically&quot;. In noting that Fred Davis and Donaldson dominated the game of snooker for several years, Lindrum described their &quot;new approach&quot; to snooker of &quot;extensive safety tactics&quot;, recalling that the pair once shared 32 strokes on a single , and suggesting that although safety play demanded skill, &quot;if safety had continued to be used without regard to audience appreciation, it may eventually have brought about a sharp decline in popularity&quot;.

Donaldson&#x27;s obituary in &quot;Snooker Scene&quot; highlighted his &quot;imperturbability&quot; as a playing strength and claimed &quot;his long potting was the best the game has ever seen&quot;, whilst noting that his aversion to applying side was probably the reason that he did not achieve more century breaks, as it limited his . The 2005 book &quot;Masters of the Baize&quot; describes Donaldson as &quot;one of the most underrated [world professional snooker] champions&quot;, who &quot;redefined the standards of long potting&quot;, while a 1989 book by Ian Morrison describes him as &quot;the first great Scottish snooker professional&quot;. In 2012, Donaldson was inducted into the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association&#x27;s World Snooker Hall of Fame.

<doc id="679619" wikidata="Q8028248" url="?curid=679619" title="Without Warning (1994 film)">
<text>Without Warning (also known as &quot;July 13th&quot;) is an American television film directed by Robert Iscove. It follows a duo of real-life reporters covering breaking news about three meteor fragments crashing into the Northern Hemisphere. It aired on CBS on October 30, 1994, and is presented as if it were an actual breaking news event, complete with remote reports from reporters. The executive producer was David L. Wolper, who produced a number of mockumentary-style films since the 1960s. The movie was heavily influenced by Orson Welles&#x27; 1938 &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast, but just like said broadcast, &quot;Without Warning&quot; caused a nationwide panic.

==Plot==
Broadcast of a murder mystery film starring Loni Anderson, titled &quot;Without Warning&quot;, is interrupted with a news bulletin of a series of three earthquakes, one of them located in the Thunder Basin National Grassland area of Wyoming. The film resumes but a few moments later is interrupted for good as coverage, led by Sander Vanocur and Dr. Caroline Jaffe, begins of a worldwide impact event. Three impacts were observed, all along the 45th parallel north in remote areas: one in Wyoming, one in southern France, and one in the Gobi Desert in China. Lone survivors are found at the Wyoming and France impact sites, a girl and a young man, respectively. Both survivors are badly burned and their speech is unintelligible.

NASA determines the three impacts originated from 6645 Venturi, an asteroid that approached Earth directly over the North Pole before fragmenting in 45-degree separations. The three impact sites begin broadcasting an ear-piercing radio signal that cripples aircraft flying near the 45th parallel. Another large asteroid is detected moving towards the North Pole in an identical trajectory to 6645 Venturi. The United States, with consent from world leaders but disagreement from scientists, orders two F-16s to destroy the asteroid with low-yield nuclear weapons. The destruction is successful, though the attacking aircraft are brought down by another radio signal shortly before the asteroid&#x27;s destruction. All of the mysterious radio signals suddenly cease. At the same time, a power surge is detected in the devoutly religious community of Faith, Wyoming, less than 50 miles from the Thunder Basin impact site. Repair crews sent to investigate discover that the citizens have all vanished without a trace.

Scientist Dr. Avram Mandel, who has been studying the impacts, is flown by an F-16 to NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center in Houston, where reporters are being briefed on the latest incident. He reveals his determinations: the impacts were an attempt at first contact by an extraterrestrial species; the radio signal was a transponder to help steer a follow-up vehicle; and, by destroying the follow-up vehicle, Earth has declared war. The two survivors, Kimberly Hastings and Jean-Paul Chounard, succumb to their wounds. A colleague of Mandel, Dr. Robert Pearlman, links 6645 Venturi&#x27;s fragmentation pattern to an identical shape present on &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;″s pioneer plaque.

Mandel resigns from NASA and reveals to reporters that three more asteroids, each at least two miles wide, will soon impact Washington, D.C., Moscow, and Beijing, the capital cities of the only three nations capable of first-strike nuclear warfare. The radio signals begin again. Two nuclear weapons are launched from the USS &quot;Ohio&quot; to intercept the Beijing and Moscow asteroids, while a third nuclear weapon is launched from F.E. Warren Air Force Base to destroy the D.C. asteroid. All three are successful and celebrations break out, but the radio signals do not cease.

Chounard and Hastings&#x27; speech is aired on the broadcast in stereo, and Vanocur recognizes the combined speech as &quot;one hundred and forty seven member states,&quot; a recital of the message from the U.N. Secretary General included on the Voyager Golden Record aboard &quot;Voyager 2&quot;. The celebrations halt as, moments later, NASA detects hundreds more asteroids heading towards Earth all at once. As a stunned Vanocur and Jaffe react to reports of cities being destroyed worldwide, Vanocur solemnly quotes from William Shakespeare, &quot;The fault, dear Brutus, lies not in our stars, but in ourselves,&quot; before a rumble is heard and the picture cuts to static.

==Production==
The film employed &quot;accelerated time&quot; (i.e. events said to have taken place an hour apart actually take place a few minutes apart), among other storytelling devices to make it clear to viewers paying attention that it was not real, including the mention of the year&#x27;s G7 Summit, which had already come and gone three months before the film released. This, combined with the casting of Jane Kaczmarek, a recognizable actress, as well as several other well-known performers in secondary roles (&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; guest star John de Lancie as a reporter and Philip Baker Hall as one of the doctors in the space station), was expected to alleviate any concerns that the story being shown was actually happening. Ron Canada, who appeared in the film as a science author being interviewed by Sander Vanocur, had previously worked as a television news reporter for stations in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. during the 1970s before becoming an actor. However, the casting of noted (albeit retired) news anchor Vanocur and noted journalist Bree Walker (who had previously anchored for Los Angeles CBS O&amp;O station KCBS-TV) in major roles portraying themselves, plus a faux interview with noted author Arthur C. Clarke, still left some viewers wondering.

==Broadcast==
During the film&#x27;s broadcast, CBS had warnings during the commercial breaks stating that the film was completely fictional, and that the events were not actually happening. Some CBS affiliates, such as KHOU in Houston, had similar warnings in the form of a news ticker &quot;crawl&quot; during the broadcast. The producers used actual CBS News graphics to help accentuate the feeling that it was real (though they used a different network logo, a sphere within an outline of a TV screen), however, leading to at least one uproar over the events. In Fort Smith, Arkansas, the CBS affiliate (KFSM-TV) reported that they had received dozens of calls regarding the incident and whether it was actually happening. The area&#x27;s ABC, Fox, and NBC affiliates (respectively KHBS, KPBI and KPOM-TV) were also flooded with complaints, asking them why they were not covering this event at the same time that CBS was covering it. In several other markets, including Detroit, Michigan, and San Diego, California, the local CBS affiliates (respectively, WJBK, which would switch to Fox six weeks later, and KFMB-TV) refused to air this TV movie.

Some accused CBS of being irresponsible in showing the movie during the primetime hours, when some children were still out trick-or-treating (even though the movie actually aired &quot;the night before&quot; Halloween). Indeed, the film explicitly takes place on October 31, with trick or treaters featured in several news reports within, but very few occasions have happened since Orson Welles&#x27; 1938 &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast (which also aired on October 30) that so many people have been taken in by a production such as &quot;Without Warning&quot;. The film borrowed one of the locations from Welles&#x27; broadcast. Welles used the village of Grover&#x27;s Mill, New Jersey, as the first landing site of the Martians in his tale. &quot;Without Warning&quot; uses the fictional town of Grover&#x27;s Mill, Wyoming, as a homage to Welles&#x27; broadcast, and the original broadcast was preceded by a brief prologue referencing the &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; broadcast, with the narrator reiterating that the film about to be shown was fiction and presented in the same spirit.

==Other releases and home media==
The film was released on DVD on July 8, 2003, nearly nine years after its initial, and only, showing on CBS.

<text>The Workplace Shell (WPS) is an object-oriented desktop shell (also called desktop environment) produced by IBM&#x27;s Boca Raton development lab for OS/2 2.0. It is based on Common User Access and made a radical shift away from the Program Manager type interface that earlier versions of OS/2 shared with Windows 3.x or the application-oriented WIMP interface of the Apple Macintosh. The Workplace Shell was also used in OS/2 Warp 3 and Warp 4, and the OS/2-based operating systems eComStation and ArcaOS.

IBM originally intended to deliver the Workplace Shell as part of the OfficeVision/2 LAN product, but in 1991 announced plans to release it as part of OS/2 2.0 instead.

Although mostly written in C, under the covers the Workplace Shell is implemented as an object-oriented class library, basing on the System Object Model (SOM). The WPS classes are glued together with an interface definition language (IDL). SOM and its IDL was developed by IBM in their Austin, Texas lab.
The classes can easily be manipulated by sending simple settings strings (like &quot;KEYWORD=VALUE;&quot;) to them both via a C and a Rexx API.&lt;ref name=&quot;OS/2WorkplaceShellAPI&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

When implementing a new WPS class, it is derived from an existing class from within the WPS class hierarchy. For modifying, extending or removing certain functionality of the parent class, often only a few methods of the parent class need to be overwritten by the developer. All other functionality of the parent class can safely remain unchanged, ensuring the seamless integration of the added or modified functionality and with that the consistency of the remaining user interface.

The resulting object class is shipped in DLL form. Once the new object class implemented by it is registered with the Workplace Shell and an instance of this class is created, it can be acted on by the user or other programs as every other Workplace Shell object. 

A part of the WPS design allows for the developer of a class Y which extends or modifies a class X to execute an additional API on installation which will let the WPS &#x27;replace&#x27; class X by class Y. This will make even all existing instances of class X behave as instances of the modified class Y; i.e., almost a retroactive inheritance. This allows for many useful third-party desktop utilities that add or modify functionality to or of existing objects without access to IBM&#x27;s source code. Where the IDL and class headers also of derived classes are published, these classes can as well be extended in turn in the same way.

<doc id="679633" wikidata="Q3142998" url="?curid=679633" title="William Alexander Smith (Boys' Brigade)">
<text>Sir William Alexander Smith (27 October 1854 – 10 May 1914), the founder of the Boys&#x27; Brigade, was born in Pennyland House, Thurso, Scotland. He was the eldest son of Major David Smith and his wife Harriet. He had one sister and two brothers.

== Education ==
Smith was educated at the Miller Institution, known as the &quot;Thurso Academy&quot;. There is now a building at Boys&#x27; Brigade Headquarters in Hemel Hempstead called the Thurso Centre.

Following his father&#x27;s death, his family moved to Glasgow. In early January 1869, he became a pupil in a private school, The Western Educational Institution, more widely known as &quot;Burns&#x27; and Sutherland’s School&quot;. In his first and only term there, he took seven prizes. His time in the institution was short-lived as he ended his school days late in May, aged 14.

Nonetheless, Smith did not cease his education altogether. His writings in a notebook indicated that he continued to take French classes after joining his uncle&#x27;s business.

== Late adolescence and adulthood ==
In October 1869, a few days before his 15th birthday, be began working in his uncle&#x27;s business. Alex. Fraser &amp; Co. were wholesale dealers in &quot;soft goods&quot;, shawls being one of their chief markets.

He later joined the 1st Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers, part of the local Volunteer Force, and at the age of 19, he was promoted to the rank Lance-Corporal. He also joined the Church of Scotland in that same year.

Smith was commissioned into the Rifle Volunteers in 1877 and promoted to Lieutenant later the same year. He also became a Sunday School teacher. It was a combination of these two activities that led him to found the Boys&#x27; Brigade on 4 October 1883 at Free Church Mission Hall, North Woodside Road, Glasgow. In 1909 he was knighted by King Edward VII for his services to children. He reached the rank of Honorary Colonel in the Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers.

He died on 10 May 1914 in London. He was buried in Glasgow Western Necropolis. There is a memorial stone in honour of him in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, and in St Giles&#x27; Cathedral, Edinburgh. There is also a Memorial Plaque in Glasgow Cathedral, it is at the Northwest corner of the Nave.

<doc id="679636" wikidata="Q1136400" url="?curid=679636" title="Open Your Eyes (1997 film)">
<text>Open Your Eyes () is a 1997 Spanish film directed and co-scored by Alejandro Amenábar &amp; written by Amenábar and Mateo Gil. It stars Eduardo Noriega, Penélope Cruz, Chete Lera, Fele Martínez and Najwa Nimri. In 2002, &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; was ranked no. 84 in the Top 100 Sci-Fi List by the Online Film Critics Society.

The film&#x27;s intersecting planes of dream and reality have prompted some critics to suggest comparisons to Calderón de la Barca&#x27;s 1635 play &quot;Life Is a Dream&quot;. An American remake entitled &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot;, directed by Cameron Crowe, was released in 2001, with Penélope Cruz reprising her role.

==Plot==
A handsome young man wakes up to a female voice telling him to open his eyes. He drives to an empty city. He wakes again, this time to a woman in his bed. He tells her not to leave him messages on his alarm clock.

From a prison cell in Madrid, the 25-year-old man, César (Eduardo Noriega), tells his story to psychiatrist Antonio (Chete Lera) while wearing a prosthetic mask. Flashbacks reveal the following events: good-looking César is attractive to women. At his birthday party, he flirts with Sofía (Penélope Cruz), his best friend Pelayo&#x27;s (Fele Martínez) date. Later, he takes her home and stays the night, but they do not sleep together. The next morning, César&#x27;s obsessive ex-lover Nuria (Najwa Nimri) pulls up outside Sofía&#x27;s flat, offering him a ride and sex. On the way to her house, however, she crashes the car with the intent to kill them both. César survives the crash but is horribly disfigured, beyond the help of cosmetic surgery, so he decides to wear a mask to conceal his face. Sofía cannot bear to see him and tries to keep her distance.

After César&#x27;s disfigurement, he begins to have a series of disorienting experiences. Drunk, César falls asleep in the street. On awakening, everything has changed: Sofía now claims to love him and the surgeons restore his lost looks. But as he makes love to Sofía one night, she suddenly changes into Nuria. Horrified, César smothers her to death with a pillow. Yet everyone else believes Nuria is indeed the woman everyone else calls Sofía, and he is imprisoned for her murder.

While he is confined to the prison, fragments of his past return to him as if in a dream. It is revealed that, shortly after falling asleep drunk on the street, César signed a contract with Life Extension, a company specializing in cryonics, to be cryogenically preserved and to experience extremely lucid and lifelike virtual reality dreams. Returning to their headquarters, under supervision by prison officers, he discovers they specialize in cryonics with a twist: &quot;artificial perception&quot; or the provision of a fantasy based on the past to clients who are reborn in the future. He committed suicide at home shortly after signing the contract and was placed in cryonic suspension. Duvernois, the L.E. representative who explains César&#x27;s experiences to him while dreaming, reveals that the era is 150 years in the future and César&#x27;s time from his awakening in the street onward has been a dream, spliced retroactively into his actual life and replacing his true memories. At the end of the film, César decides to wake and be resurrected by committing suicide. Convinced his life since the drunken night in the street has been a nightmarish vision created by Life Extension, he leaps from the roof of the company&#x27;s high-rise headquarters, and the film ends, apparently ambiguously, on a black screen with a woman telling him to open his eyes.

==Cast==
* Eduardo Noriega as César, a confident and wealthy young man who has money and is successful with women
* Fele Martínez as Pelayo, César&#x27;s best friend, whose personality is marked by his inferiority complex when it comes to meeting women

* Najwa Nimri as Nuria, César&#x27;s former lover, who still has feelings for him
* Tristán Ulloa as Camarero
* Chete Lera as Antonio, a psychologist who tries to help
* Gérard Barray as Duvernois, a representative of the L.E. company

== Release ==
The film was theatrically released on 19 December 1997.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; received mostly positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an 85% approval rating based on reviews from 47 critics, with a weighted average score of 7.39 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states: &quot;Director Alejandro Amenábar tackles some heady issues with finesse and clarity in &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;, a gripping exploration of existentialism and the human spirit&quot;. James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars (out of four), writing that movies &quot;of this intelligence, audacity, and complexity come along so rarely that it&#x27;s mandatory to cry out their arrival&quot; and that &quot;those who see it will not quickly forget the experience&quot;. Rob Blackwelder of SplicedWire gave the film four stars (out of four), calling it &quot;a jaw-dropping psychological thriller&quot; that&#x27;s &quot;beautifully orchestrated&quot;.

Richard Scheib of &quot;The Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film Review&quot; also gave &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; four stars, writing that it is &quot;quite a remarkable film&quot;. Holly E. Ordway of DVD Active wrote &quot;I don’t give out “perfect 10” ratings lightly, but &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; earns one by all accounts&quot;. However, Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk gave a more lukewarm review, writing that he &quot;found most of &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; interesting&quot; but remarked that &quot;there&#x27;s something about the picture that kept me from being completely involved&quot;.

In 2016, Alejandro Amenábar said in a retrospective that &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot; was his worst film, saying that it had been written by teenagers, who did not know anything about life.

===Box office===
In Spain, the film was the second highest-grossing Spanish film of the year behind &quot;Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley&quot; with a gross of $7.8 million. In the United States and Canada it grossed $370,720. Elsewhere it grossed $0.7 million.

==American remake==
Director Cameron Crowe&#x27;s film &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; (2001) is a remake of &quot;Open Your Eyes&quot;. It stars Tom Cruise in the lead role (renamed David Aames), Penélope Cruz reprising her role as Sofia, Cameron Diaz as the woman who disfigures David (renamed Julianna Gianni), Jason Lee as the friend (renamed Brian Shelby), and Kurt Russell as the psychiatrist (renamed Curtis McCabe). Transporting the action from Madrid to New York City, &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; follows its source material&#x27;s plot very closely, but makes several changes to the ending.

<doc id="679642" wikidata="Q7561732" url="?curid=679642" title="Sonia Manzano">
<text>Sonia Manzano (born June 12, 1950) is an American actress, screenwriter, and author. She is best known for playing Maria on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 1971 to 2015. She received a Lifetime Achievement Daytime Emmy Award in 2016.

Her memoir, &quot;Becoming Maria: Love and Chaos in the South Bronx&quot; was published in 2015, and her works include the novel &quot;The Revolution of Evelyn Serrano&quot; as well as several children&#x27;s books. She is the creator of the animated children&#x27;s television series &quot;Alma&#x27;s Way&quot;, from Fred Rogers Productions, and serves as an executive producer, writer and voice actor for the show. 

== Early life and education ==
Manzano was born and raised in the South Bronx in New York City. Her parents came from Puerto Rico. Manzano attended the High School of Performing Arts, where she began her acting career. She attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh on a scholarship. In her junior year, she came to New York to star in the original production of the off-Broadway show &quot;Godspell&quot;.

== Career ==
Manzano joined the production of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1971, where she eventually began writing scripts for the series. On June 29, 2015, it was announced that Manzano would be retiring from the show after 44 years. Manzano did, however, later reprise the role of Maria in the 2019 television special &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Celebration&quot;.

She has performed on the New York stage, in &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; and &quot;The Exonerated&quot;. She has written for the Peabody Award-winning children&#x27;s series &quot;Little Bill&quot;, and has written a parenting column for the Sesame Workshop web site called &quot;Talking Outloud&quot;. She has also appeared in multiple films, including &quot;Death Wish&quot;, &quot;Firepower&quot;, &quot;Night Flowers&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman in Cheetah on the Prowl&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland&quot;, &quot;The Guitar&quot;, &quot;Dumped!&quot;, &quot;Missing Grandma&quot;, and &quot;Godmothered&quot;, and television programs, including &quot;BJ and the Bear&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, and &quot;Law &amp; Order: SVU&quot;.

Manzano is the author of a novel, children&#x27;s books, and a memoir. Her children&#x27;s book &quot;No Dogs Allowed&quot; was published by Simon &amp; Schuster Children&#x27;s Publishing in 2004. The book has been adapted as a stage play. She is also the author of the novel &quot;The Revolution of Evelyn Serrano&quot; (2014). In 2015, her memoir, &quot;Becoming Maria: Love and Chaos in the South Bronx&quot;, was published. In 2022, her novel for children &quot;Coming Up Cuban&quot; was published, as part of a contract with Scholastic to publish two novels and two picture books for children.

She has served on the March of Dimes Board; the board of the George Foster Peabody Awards; and the board of a New York City theatrical institution, Symphony Space. She is a member of the board of advisors of the Project Sunshine Book Club. She was featured in the Learning Leaders (volunteers helping students succeed) poster, designed to encourage reading in NYC public schools.

In several episodes of the animated Nickelodeon series &quot;The Loud House&quot;, Manzano provides the voice of Bobby and Ronnie Anne Santiago&#x27;s grandmother, Rosa Casagrande, a role she reprises in the spinoff &quot;The Casagrandes&quot;. She also portrays Judge Gloria Pepitone in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. She also provided the voice-over narration in several animated segments in the English version of the Swedish television show &quot;Fem myror är fler än fyra elefanter&quot;.

On December 3, 2020, &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that Manzano would return to PBS to create a new animated children&#x27;s television series titled &quot;Alma&#x27;s Way&quot;. In &quot;Alma&#x27;s Way&quot;, which was launched by PBS in October 2021, she is the creator, as well as an executive producer, writer, and voice actor.

== Honors and awards ==
Manzano was nominated twice for the Emmy Award as Outstanding Performer in a Children&#x27;s Series. As a writer for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, Manzano won 15 Emmy Awards.

In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Manzano&#x27;s name and picture. In 2004, she was added to the Bronx Walk of Fame.

Manzano has received awards from the Association of Hispanic Arts, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, the Committee for Hispanic Children and Families, the Hispanic Heritage Award for Education in 2003, and the &quot;Groundbreaking Latina Lifetime Achievement&quot; award from the National Association of Latina Leaders in 2005. In 2005, she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from University of Notre Dame. The Dream Big Initiative of the Bronx Children&#x27;s Museum honored Manzano in 2014. 

On May 1, 2016, she received the Lifetime Achievement Emmy Award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presented to her by Rita Moreno and Mario Lopez, with a special introduction by Lin-Manuel Miranda and a retrospective of her career on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; featuring a montage of clips of her most iconic moments including Maria&#x27;s classic Charlie Chaplin routine, her marriage to Luis, the birth of her daughter Gabi, coping with the death of Mr. Hooper, and appearances by fellow cast and guests including Emilio Delgado, Bob McGrath, Alan Muraoka, Loretta Long, Big Bird, Rosita, Elmo, and Sonia&#x27;s real life friend Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.

<doc id="679644" wikidata="Q937230" url="?curid=679644" title="1980–81 snooker world rankings">
<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Before this, for each tournament the defending champion was seeded first, and the previous year&#x27;s runner-up second.

Players&#x27; performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1978, 1979 and 1980) contributed to their points total. For each of the three years, the World Champion gained five points, the runner-up received four, losing semi-finalists got three, losing quarter-finalists got two, and losers in the last-16 round received a single point. Ray Reardon, who had not won a major title for two years, retained the number one ranking that he had held since the inception of the rankings, despite only reaching the quarter-finals of the 1979 and 1980 championships. The 1980 World Champion, Cliff Thorburn, was ranked second, and Eddie Charlton was placed third, as he had been for each year since the 1976/1977 list. John Spencer, the 1977 champion, dropped from fourth place to 15th. Player and commentator Jack Karnehm remarked that in the 1976/1977 rankings Reardon was ten points ahead of the player ranked tenth, but in the 1980/1981 list there were only four points between the first and tenth-ranked places, which Karnehm considered showed a greater parity between the top players.

The eight highest-ranked players were placed directly into the last-16 round of the 1981 World Snooker Championship, with defending champion Thorburn as the top seed. The next eight from the list were placed into the first round and would face a player from the qualifying competition. Karnehm criticised the ranking system for not taking into consideration players&#x27; performances at tournaments other than the world championship and, because the points were accumulated over three years, having a bias against new players. The article in &quot;Snooker Scene&quot; magazine discussing the ranking list for 1980/1981 also contained concerns about the advantage to established players, whilst arguing that no better alternative system had been proposed.

==Rankings==
The professional world rankings for snooker players in the 1980–81 season are listed below. Points gained in each of the three World Snooker Championships are shown, with the total number of points given in the last column. A &quot;–&quot; symbol indicates that the player did not participate in that year&#x27;s championship.

<doc id="679646" wikidata="Q1507239" url="?curid=679646" title="George Dowty">
<text>Sir George Herbert Dowty (27 March 1901 – 7 December 1975) was an English inventor and businessman.

He founded Dowty Aviation in the 1930s producing aircraft components such as hydraulic systems, undercarriage units, and warning devices.

==Early life==
Dowty was born in Pershore, Worcestershire in 1901. He was sent to the Royal Grammar School Worcester after losing his right eye at the age of 12 making a firework.

He left in 1916 to take up a job as an apprentice for Heenan &amp; Froude at a factory in Worcester. He later moved to Cheltenham to become a draughtsman for the same company. In 1918 Dowty became a draughtsman with the British Aerial Transport Company in London. He then joined the design office of the A. V. Roe &amp; Company at Hamble near Southampton. In 1924 he went to the Gloster Aircraft Company where he worked on undercarriage design.

==Aircraft equipment==
In 1931 he set up his own company in Cheltenham making aircraft equipment: for this purpose he leased a factory and bought Arle Court in Cheltenham. Dowty invented the first internally sprung aircraft wheel (used on the Gloster Gladiator) and by the time World War II had broken out the company was known as &quot;Dowty Aviation&quot; and was making the hydraulic systems in planes in Britain, Canada and the United States. His equipment was also used in the Concorde supersonic airliners.

== Dowty retarder == 

He also invented the &quot;Dowty retarder&quot; for use in railway classification yards, a hydraulic device that regulates the speed of rail cars as they roll down an inclined track. The devices are built for a specified speed, set at the factory. If the rail car is below the set speed, the device offers no resistance. If the car speed is at or greater than the speed setting, an internal valve is activated to provide a resistance to the wheel, thus slowing the car. This keeps cars rolling within a relatively narrow range of speeds.

==Honours==
In 1956 he was knighted for his services to the industry.

In 1961 he became the President of the Worcester Old Elizabethans&#x27; Association and amongst his other awards he was President of the Royal Aeronautical Society, winning the RAeS &quot;British Gold Medal&quot; in 1955, and President of the Worcestershire County Cricket Club. He was given the Freedom of the Borough of Cheltenham and Tewkesbury and was a Deputy Lieutenant of Gloucestershire. He received an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Science) from the University of Bath in 1966.

He died in 1975 in the Isle of Man and although his company was acquired by TI Group in 1992, an element of it still remains as Messier-Dowty, a subsidiary of the Safran Group and Dowty Propellers, a subsidiary of GE Aviation.

==Family==
His first wife was Edith Dowty.
In 1948 he married Marguerite Anne Gowans. She died on March 24, 2012, at age 87.

<doc id="679654" wikidata="Q1413685" url="?curid=679654" title="Filipino Americans">
<text>Filipino Americans () are Americans of Filipino ancestry. Filipinos in North America were first documented in the 16th century and other small settlements beginning in the 18th century. Mass migration did not begin until after the end of the Spanish–American War at the end of the 19th century, when the Philippines was ceded from Spain to the United States in the Treaty of Paris.

As of 2022, there were almost 4.5 million Filipino Americans in the United States with large communities in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and the New York metropolitan area. Around one third of Filipino Americans identify as multiracial or multiethnic, with 3 million reporting only Filipino ancestry and 1.5 million reporting Filipino in combination with another group.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;Filipino American&quot; is sometimes shortened to &quot;Fil-Am&quot; or &quot;Pinoy&quot;. Another term which has been used is &quot;Philippine Americans&quot;. The earliest appearance of the term &quot;Pinoy&quot; (feminine &quot;Pinay&quot;), was in a 1926 issue of the &quot;Filipino Student Bulletin&quot;. Some Filipinos believe that the term &quot;Pinoy&quot; was coined by Filipinos who came to the United States to distinguish themselves from Filipinos living in the Philippines. Beginning in 2017, started by individuals who identify with the LGBT+ Filipino-American population, there is an effort to adopt the term &quot;FilipinX&quot;; this new term has faced opposition within the broader overseas Filipino diaspora, within the Philippines, and in the United States, with some who are in opposition believing it is an attempt of a &quot;colonial imposition&quot;.

==Background==


Filipino sailors were the first Asians in North America. The first documented presence of Filipinos in what is now the United States dates back to October 1587 around Morro Bay, California, with the first permanent settlement in Saint Malo, Spanish Louisiana, in 1763, the settlers there were called &quot;Manilamen&quot; and they served in the Battle of New Orleans during the closing stages of the War of 1812, after the Treaty of Ghent had already been signed. There were then small settlements of Filipinos beginning in the 18th century, and Filipinos worked as cowboys and ranch hands in the 1800s. There was also a settlement in Plaquemines Parish, which became known as &quot;Manila Village&quot;. This area was the center of the shrimp drying industry in Louisiana, and its workforce was composed predominantly of Filipino migrants. Mass migration began in the early 20th century when, for a period following the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the Philippines was a territory of the United States. By 1904, Filipino peoples of different ethnic backgrounds were imported by the U.S. government onto the Americas and were displayed at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition as part of a human zoo. During the 1920s, many Filipinos immigrated to the United States as unskilled labor, to provide better opportunities for their families back at home.

Philippine independence was recognized by the United States on July 4, 1946. After independence in 1946, Filipino-American numbers continued to grow. Immigration was reduced significantly during the 1930s, except for those who served in the United States Navy, and increased following immigration reform in the 1960s. The majority of Filipinos who immigrated after the passage of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 were skilled professionals and technicians.

The 2010 census counted 3.4 million Filipino Americans; the United States Department of State in 2011 estimated the total at 4 million, or 1.1% of the U.S. population. They are the country&#x27;s second-largest self-reported Asian ancestry group after Chinese Americans according to 2010 American Community Survey. They are also the largest population of Overseas Filipinos. Significant populations of Filipino Americans can be found in California, Florida, Texas, Hawaii, the New York metropolitan area, and Illinois.

==Culture==
The history of Spanish and American rule and contact with merchants and traders culminated in a unique blend of Eastern and Western cultures in the Philippines. Filipino-American cultural identity has been described as fluid, adopting aspects from various cultures; that said, there has not been significant research into the culture of Filipino Americans. Fashion, dance, music, theater and arts have all had roles in building Filipino-American cultural identities and communities.

In areas of sparse Filipino population, they often form loosely-knit social organizations aimed at maintaining a &quot;sense of family&quot;, which is a key feature of Filipino culture. These organizations generally arrange social events, especially of a charitable nature, and keep members up-to-date with local events. Organizations are often organized into regional associations. The associations are a small part of Filipino-American life. Filipino Americans formed close-knit neighborhoods, notably in California and Hawaii. A few communities have &quot;Little Manilas&quot;, civic and business districts tailored for the Filipino-American community. In a Filipino party, shoes should be left in the front of the house and greet everyone with a hi or hello. When greeting older relatives, &quot;po&quot; and &quot;opo&quot; must be said in every sentence to show respect.

Some Filipinos have traditional Philippine surnames, such as Bacdayan or Macapagal, while others have surnames derived from Japanese, Indian, and Chinese and reflect centuries of trade with these merchants preceding European and American rule. Reflecting its 333 years of Spanish rule, many Filipinos adopted Hispanic surnames, and celebrate &quot;fiestas&quot;.

Despite being from Asia, Filipinos are sometimes called &quot;Latinos&quot; due to their historical relationship to Spanish colonialism; this view is not universally accepted. The Philippines experienced both Spanish and American colonial territorial status, with its population seen through each nation&#x27;s racial constructs. This shared history may also contribute to why some Filipinos choose to also identify as Hispanic or Latino, while others may not and identify more as Asian Americans. In a 2017 Pew Research Survey, only 1% of immigrants from the Philippines identified as Hispanic.

Due to history, the Philippines and the United States are connected culturally. In 2016, there was $16.5 billion worth of trade between the two countries, with the United States being the largest foreign investor in the Philippines, and more than 40% of remittances came from (or through) the United States. In 2004, the amount of remittances coming from the United States was $5 billion; this is an increase from the $1.16 billion sent in 1991 (then about 80% of total remittances being sent to the Philippines), and the $324 million sent in 1988. Some Filipino Americans have chosen to retire in the Philippines, buying real estate. Filipino Americans, continue to travel back and forth between the United States and the Philippines, making up more than a tenth of all foreign travelers to the Philippines in 2010; when traveling back to the Philippines they often bring cargo boxes known as a balikbayan box.

===Language===
Filipino and English are constitutionally established as official languages in the Philippines, and Filipino is designated as the national language, with English in wide use. Many Filipinos speak Philippine English, a dialect derived from American English due to American colonial influence in the country&#x27;s education system and due to limited Spanish education. Among Asian Americans in 1990, Filipino Americans had the smallest percentage of individuals who had problems with English. In 2000, among U.S.-born Filipino Americans, three quarters responded that English is their primary language; nearly half of Filipino Americans speak English exclusively.

In 2003, Tagalog was the fifth-most-spoken language in the United States, with 1.262 million speakers; by 2011, it was the fourth most-spoken language in the United States. Tagalog usage is significant in California, Nevada, and Washington, while Ilocano usage is significant in Hawaii. Many of California&#x27;s public announcements and documents are translated into Tagalog. Tagalog is also taught in some public schools in the United States, as well as at some colleges. Other significant Filipino languages are Ilocano and Cebuano. Other languages spoken in Filipino-American households include Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Hiligaynon, Bicolano and Waray. However, fluency in Philippine languages tends to be lost among second- and third-generation Filipino Americans. Other languages of the community include Spanish and Chinese (Hokkien and Mandarin). The demonym, &quot;Filipinx&quot;, is a gender-neutral term that is applied only to those of Filipino heritage in the diaspora, specifically Filipino Americans. The term is not applied to Filipinos in the Philippines.

===Religion===

The Philippines is 90% Christian, one of only two predominantly Christian countries in Southeast Asia, along with East Timor. Following the European arrival to the Philippines by Ferdinand Magellan, Spaniards made a concerted effort to convert Filipinos to Catholicism; outside of the Muslim sultanates and animist societies, missionaries were able to convert large numbers of Filipinos. and the majority are Roman Catholic, giving Catholicism a major impact on Filipino culture. Other Christian denominations include Protestants (Aglipayan, Episcopalian, and others), and nontrinitarians (Iglesia ni Cristo and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses). Additionally there are those Filipinos who are Muslims, Buddhist or nonreligious; religion has served as a dividing factor within the Philippines and Filipino-American communities.

During the early part of the United States governance in the Philippines, there was a concerted effort to convert Filipinos into Protestants, and the results came with varying success. As Filipinos began to migrate to the United States, Filipino Roman Catholics were often not embraced by their American Catholic brethren, nor were they sympathetic to a Filipino-ized Catholicism, in the early 20th century. This led to creation of ethnic-specific parishes; one such parish was St. Columban&#x27;s Church in Los Angeles. In 1997, the Filipino oratory was dedicated at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception, owing to increased diversity within the congregations of American Catholic parishes. The first-ever American Church for Filipinos, San Lorenzo Ruiz Church in New York City, is named after the first saint from the Philippines, San Lorenzo Ruiz. This was officially designated as a church for Filipinos in July 2005, the first in the United States, and the second in the world, after a church in Rome.

In 2010, Filipino American Catholics were the largest population of Asian American Catholics, making up more than three fourths of Asian American Catholics. In 2015, a majority (65%) of Filipino Americans identify as Catholic; this is down slightly from 2004 (68%). Filipino Americans, who are first-generation immigrants were more likely to attend mass weekly, and tended to be more conservative, than those who were born in the United States. Culturally, some traditions and beliefs rooted from the original indigenous religions of Filipinos are still known among the Filipino diaspora.

===Cuisine===


The number of Filipino restaurants does not reflect the size of the population. Due to the restaurant business not being a major source of income for the community, few non-Filipinos are familiar with the cuisine. Although American cuisine influenced Filipino cuisine, it has been criticized by non-Filipinos. Even on Oahu where there is a significant Filipino-American population, Filipino cuisine is not as noticeable as other Asian cuisines. One study found that Filipino cuisine was not often listed in food frequency questionnaires. On television, Filipino cuisine has been criticized, such as on &quot;Fear Factor&quot;, and praised, such as on &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot;, and &quot;Bizarre Foods America&quot;.

While &quot;new&quot; Filipino restaurants and fusion-type places have been opening up, traditionally, &quot;native cuisine proved itself strong and resistant to &#x27;fraternization&#x27; with foreign invaders. The original dishes have retained their ingredients, cooking methods, and spirit.&quot;

Filipino cuisine is much like its culture, a blend of many influences through the years of colonization. Popular Filipino dishes such as &quot;pancit&quot; has Hokkien roots, &quot;adobo&quot; from Spain and Mexico, and the use of &quot;bagoong&quot; and &quot;patis&quot;, fermented sauces that stem from Malay origins.

Filipino-American chefs cook in many fine dining restaurants, including Cristeta Comerford who is the executive chef in the White House, though many do not serve Filipino cuisine in their restaurants. Reasons given for the lack of Filipino cuisine in the U.S. include colonial mentality, lack of a clear identity, a preference for cooking at home, a continuing preference of Filipino Americans for cuisines other than their own, and the nebulous nature of Filipino cuisine itself due to its historical influences. Filipino cuisine remains prevalent among Filipino immigrants, with restaurants and grocery stores catering to the Filipino-American community, including Jollibee, a Philippines-based fast-food chain.

In the 2010s, successful and critically reviewed Filipino-American restaurants were featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. That same decade began a Filipino Food movement in the United States; it has been criticized for gentrification of the cuisine. &quot;Bon Appetit&quot; named Bad Saint in Washington, D.C. &quot;the second best new restaurant in the United States&quot; in 2016. &quot;Food &amp; Wine&quot; named Lasa, in Los Angeles, one of its restaurants of the year in 2018. With this emergence of Filipino-American restaurants, food critics like Andrew Zimmern have predicted that Filipino food will be &quot;the next big thing&quot; in American cuisine. Yet in 2017, &quot;Vogue&quot; described the cuisine as &quot;misunderstood and neglected&quot;; &quot;SF Weekly&quot; in 2019, later described the cuisine as &quot;marginal, underappreciated, and prone to weird booms-and-busts&quot;.

===Family===
Filipino Americans undergo experiences that are unique to their own identities. These experiences derive from both the Filipino culture and American cultures individually and the dueling of these identities as well. These stressors, if great enough, can lead Filipino Americans into suicidal behaviors. Members of the Filipino community learn early on about &quot;kapwa&quot;, which is defined as &quot;interpersonal connectedness or togetherness&quot;.

With &quot;kapwa&quot;, many Filipino Americans have a strong sense of needing to repay their family members for the opportunities that they have been able to receive. An example of this is a new college graduate feeling the need to find a job that will allow them to financially support their family and themselves. This notion comes from &quot;utang na loob&quot;, defined as a debt that must be repaid to those who have supported the individual.

With &quot;kapwa&quot; and &quot;utang na loob&quot; as strong forces enacting on the individual, there is an &quot;all or nothing&quot; mentality that is being played out. In order to bring success back to one&#x27;s family, there is a desire to succeed for one&#x27;s family through living out a family&#x27;s wants as opposed to one&#x27;s own true desires. This can manifest as one entering a career path that they are not passionate in, but select in order to help support their family.

Despite many of the stressors for these students deriving from family, it also becomes apparent that these are the reasons that these students are resilient. When family conflict rises in Filipino-American families, there is a negative association with suicide attempts. This suggests that though family is a presenting stressor in a Filipino American&#x27;s life, it also plays a role for their resilience. In a study conducted by Yusuke Kuroki, family connectedness, whether defined as positive or negative to each individual, served as one means of lowering suicide attempts.

===Media===
Beginning in the late 1800s, Filipino Americans began publishing books in the United States. The growth of publications for the masses in the Philippines accelerated during the American period. Ethnic media serving Filipino Americans dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. In 1905, pensionados at University of California, Berkeley published &quot;The Filipino Students&#x27; Magazine&quot;. One of the earliest Filipino-American newspapers published in the United States, was the &quot;Philippine Independent&quot; of Salinas, California, which began publishing in 1921. Newspapers from the Philippines, to include &quot;The Manila Times&quot;, also served the Filipino diaspora in the United States. In 1961, the &quot;Philippine News&quot; was started by Alex Esclamado, which by the 1980s had a national reach and at the time was the largest English-language Filipino newspaper. While many areas with Filipino Americans have local Filipino newspapers, one of the largest concentrations of these newspapers occur in Southern California. Beginning in 1992, &quot;Filipinas&quot; began publication, and was unique in that it focused on American-born Filipino Americans of the second and third generations. &quot;Filipinas&quot; ended its run in 2010, however it was succeeded by &quot;Positively Filipino&quot; in 2012 which included some of the staff from &quot;Filipinas&quot;. The Filipino diaspora in the United States are able to watch programming from the Philippines on television through GMA Pinoy TV and The Filipino Channel.

=== Politics ===

Filipino Americans have traditionally been socially conservative, particularly with &quot;second wave&quot; immigrants; the first Filipino American elected to office was Peter Aduja. In the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election Republican president George W. Bush won the Filipino-American vote over John Kerry by nearly a two-to-one ratio, which followed strong support in the 2000 election. However, during the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election, Filipino Americans voted majority Democratic, with 50% to 58% of the community voting for President Barack Obama and 42% to 46% voting for Senator John McCain. The 2008 election marked the first time that a majority of Filipino Americans voted for a Democratic presidential candidate. 

According to the 2012 National Asian American Survey, conducted in September 2012, 45% of Filipinos were independent or nonpartisan, 27% were Republican, and 24% were Democrats. Additionally, Filipino Americans had the largest proportions of Republicans among Asian Americans polled, a position normally held by Vietnamese Americans, leading up to the 2012 election, and had the lowest job approval opinion of Obama among Asian Americans. In a survey of Asian Americans from thirty-seven cities conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, it found that of the Filipino-American respondents, 65% voted for Obama. According to an exit poll conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, it found that 71% of responding Filipino Americans voted for Hillary Clinton during the 2016 general election.

In a survey conducted by the advocacy group Asian Americans Advancing Justice in September 2020, of the 263 Filipino American respondents, 46% identified as Democrats, 28% identified as Republicans, and 16% as independent. According to interviews conducted by academic Anthony Ocampo, Filipino American supporters of Donald Trump cited their support for the former President based on support for building a border wall, tax cuts to businesses, legal immigration, school choice, opposition to abortion, opposition to affirmative action, antagonism towards the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and viewing Trump as a non-racist. There was an age divide among Filipino Americans, with older Filipino Americans more likely to support Trump or be Republicans, and younger Filipino Americans more likely to support Biden or be Democrats. In the 2020 presidential election, Philippines Ambassador Jose Manuel Romualdez alleged that 60% of Filipino Americans reportedly voted for Joe Biden. Filipino Americans were among those who were at the 2021 United States Capitol attack. The news site Rappler reported the next day that Filipino-American media has heavily repeated QAnon conspiracies. Rappler further reported that many Filipino Americans who voted for Trump and adhere to QAnon cite similar political opinions in the Philippines regarding Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and anti-Chinese sentiment since China has been building artificial reefs in the South China Sea near the Philippines in the 2010s, and have recently seen the Republican Party as more hardline against the Chinese government&#x27;s actions. Filipino Americans have also been more receptive to gun rights compared to other Asian-American ethnic groups. This is in part due to the lax gun laws in the Philippines. 

In the 2024 election, most Filipino Americans have responded to a survey indicating 59% of them found Vice President Kamala Harris more favorably, while 29% found former President Donald Trump favorable.

Due to scattered living patterns, it is nearly impossible for Filipino American candidates to win an election solely based on the Filipino-American vote. Filipino-American politicians have increased their visibility over the past few decades. Ben Cayetano (Democrat), former governor of Hawaii, became the first governor of Filipino descent in the United States. The number of Congressional members of Filipino descent doubled to numbers not reached since 1937, two when the Philippine Islands were represented by non-voting Resident Commissioners, due to the 2000 senatorial election. In 2009 three Congress-members claimed at least one-eighth Filipino ethnicity; the largest number to date. Since the resignation of Senator John Ensign in 2011 (the only Filipino American to have been a member of the Senate), and Representative Steve Austria (the only Asian Pacific American Republican in the 112th Congress) choosing not to seek reelection and retire, Representative Robert C. Scott was the only Filipino American in the 113th Congress. In the 116th United States Congress, Scott was joined by Rep. TJ Cox, bringing the number of Filipino Americans in Congress to two. In the 117th United States Congress, Scott once again became the sole Filipino-American Representative after Cox was defeated in a rematch against David Valadao.

Most Filipino-American registered voters identify with or lean to the Democratic Party. About two-thirds of Filipino-American voters (68%) are Democrats or lean Democratic, while 31% are Republicans or lean Republican.

==Socioeconomic demographics==

===Economics===
Filipino Americans are largely middle class with 62% of households being middle income. However, only 21% of Filipino-American households are Upper Income compared to 27% for all Asian households. They are less likely to be Upper Income than all Asians. Filipino Americans have high labor force participation rates and 67% of Filipino Americans are employed.

Filipino Americans are more likely to live in larger, overcrowded (8.7% of Filipino housing units compared to 3.5% of total population), multi-generational (34%) households compared to the general population. The average household size for Filipino Americans in 2023 was 2.99 compared to 2.49 for the general population.

The impressive annual median household income and low poverty rates must be approached with caution, for median household income represents the combined earnings of several family or household members often living in crowded and less than adequate houses.

While the median household income for Filipino alone was high, per capita income for Filipino Americans was $47,819 which was significantly lower than for all Asians ($55,561) and Non-Hispanic Whites ($50,675). Individual earnings for both Filipino males and females were significantly lower than all Asians, suggesting multiple earners in a household. Filipino-American full-time, year-round workers were paid lower than the U.S. average and had a lower average hourly wage of $29.35 than the U.S. average of $29.95 and AAPI average of $30.73 

Only 39% of Filipino American men (ages 25-34) had attained a Bachelor’s degree, in comparison to 87% of Asian Indian American men, 69% of Chinese American men, 63% of Japanese American men, 62% of Korean American men, and 42 percent of Vietnamese American men. The same study showed that Filipino, Korean and Cambodian men with Bachelor&#x27;s degrees have lower median wages of $30 an hour compared to Chinese and Indian immigrant men who had median wages of $40 an hour 

Filipino American households in Los Angeles had a net worth of $243,000 with $5,000 in debts compared to a net worth of $355,000 for White households, $595,000 for Japanese households, $408,500 for Chinese households and $460,000 for Indian American households.

Filipino Americans had a significantly higher rate of food insecurity (11%) than all Asians and White Americans (6%).

Filipino Americans had a lower poverty rate (7%) than the total population, this correlates with the Filipino-American unemployment rate being only 3% and a high labor force participation rate of 67%.

There is a trend of second-generation Filipino Americans moving back to the Philippines, finding the American Dream more and more unattainable. They cite lower cost of living as the main reasons they would move back to the Philippines. There is also a trend of Filipino Americans relocating from Hawaii and California to Nevada due to rising cost of living and housing prices.

===Industry and jobs===
The representation of Filipino Americans employed in health care is high. Other sectors of the economy where Filipino Americans have significant representation are in the public sector, and in the service sector. Compared to Asian-American women of other ethnicities, and women in the United States in general, Filipina Americans are more likely to be part of the work force; a large population, nearly one fifth (18%), of Filipina Americans worked as registered nurses. There is also a large number of Filipino domestic workers and care-givers in the U.S. More than 60% of Filipino Americans work in more than 60% work in low-wage and/or service-sector work.

Filipino Americans own a variety of businesses, making up 10.5% of all Asian owned businesses in the United States in 2007. In 2002, according to the Survey of Business Owners, there were over 125,000 Filipino-owned businesses; this increased by 30.4% to over 163,000 in 2007. By then, 25.4% of these businesses were in the retail industry, 23% were in the health care and social assistance industries, and they employed more than 142,000 people and generated almost $15.8 billion in revenue. Of those, just under three thousand (1.8% of all Filipino-owned businesses) were million dollar or more businesses. This means Filipino-owned businesses are significantly less likely to be million dollar or more than all Asians (5%). California had the largest number of Filipino-owned businesses, with the Los Angeles metropolitan area having the largest number of any metropolitan area in the United States.

The Philippines is the largest exporters of Nurses and this is something that can be traced back to U.S. colonialism. America has been relying on Filipino nurses on the frontlines since the AIDs pandemic. Despite making up only 4% of Registered Nurses in the U.S., the make up nearly a third of Covid-related deaths among registered nurses.

American schools have also hired and sponsored the immigration of Filipino teachers and instructors. Some of these teachers were forced into labor outside the field of education, and mistreated by their recruiters.

Among Overseas Filipinos, Filipino Americans are the largest remitters of U.S. dollars to the Philippines. In 2005, their combined dollar remittances reached a record-high of almost $6.5 billion. In 2006, Filipino Americans sent more than $8 billion, which represents 57% of the total foreign remittances received by the Philippines. By 2012, this amount had reached $10.6 billion, but made up only 43% of total remittances. In 2021, the United States was the largest source of remittances to the Philippines, making up 40.5% of the $31.4 billion remittances received by the Philippines.

==Community issues==
===Immigration===


The Citizenship Retention and Re-Acquisition Act of 2003 (Republic Act No. 9225) made Filipino Americans eligible for dual citizenship in the United States and the Philippines. Overseas suffrage was first employed in the May 2004 elections in which Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was reelected to a second term.

By 2005, about 6,000 Filipino Americans had become dual citizens of the two countries. One effect of this act was to allow Filipino Americans to invest in the Philippines through land purchases, which are limited to Filipino citizens, and, with some limitations, former citizens.), vote in Philippine elections, retire in the Philippines, and participate in representing the Philippine flag. In 2013, for the Philippine general election there were 125,604 registered Filipino voters in the United States and Caribbean, of which only 13,976 voted.

Dual citizens have been recruited to participate in international sports events including athletes representing the Philippines who competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, and the Olympic Games in Beijing 2008.

The Philippine government actively encourages Filipino Americans to visit or return permanently to the Philippines via the &quot;Balikbayan&quot; program and to invest in the country.

Filipinos remain one of the largest immigrant groups to date with over 40,000 arriving annually since 1979. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has a preference system for issuing visas to non-citizen family members of U.S. citizens, with preference based generally on familial closeness. Some non-citizen relatives of U.S. citizens spend long periods on waiting lists. Petitions for immigrant visas, particularly for siblings of previously naturalized Filipinos that date back to 1984, were not granted until 2006. , over 380 thousand Filipinos were on the visa wait list, second only to Mexico and ahead of India, Vietnam and China. Filipinos have the longest waiting times for family reunification visas, as Filipinos disproportionately apply for family visas; this has led to visa petitions filed in July 1989 still waiting to be processed in March 2013.

====Illegal immigration====
It has been documented that Filipinos were among those naturalized due to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. In 2009, the Department of Homeland Security estimated that 270,000 Filipino were &quot;unauthorized immigrants&quot;. This was an increase of 70,000 from a previous estimate in 2000. In both years, Filipinos accounted for 2% of the total. , Filipinos were the fifth-largest community of illegal immigrants behind Mexico (6.65 million, 62%), El Salvador (530,000, 5%), Guatemala (480,000, 4%), and Honduras (320,000, 3%). In January 2011, the Department of Homeland Security estimate of &quot;unauthorized immigrants&quot; from the Philippines remained at 270,000. By 2017, the number of Filipinos who were in the United States illegally increased to 310,000. Filipinos who reside in the United States illegally are known within the Filipino community as &quot;TnT&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;tago nang tago&quot; &#x27;hide and hide&#x27;).

===Health===

Filipino Americans experience significant health disparities and are more likely to have diabetes, heart disease, high blood preasure and other issues. Filipino Americans also experience food insecurity at a significantly higher rate then other Asian-American groups. In Hawaii the rate of low food security and very low food security for Filipino people were 11.7% and 22.3%.

====Identity====

Filipino Americans may be mistaken for members of other racial/ethnic groups, such as Latinos or Pacific Islanders; this may lead to &quot;mistaken&quot; discrimination that is not specific to Asian Americans. Filipino Americans, additionally, have had difficulty being categorized, termed by one source as being in &quot;perpetual absence&quot;.

In the period, prior to 1946, Filipinos were taught that they were American, and presented with an idealized America. They had official status as United States nationals. When ill-treated and discriminated by other Americans, Filipinos were faced with the racism of that period, which undermined these ideals. Carlos Bulosan later wrote about this experience in &quot;America is in the Heart&quot;. Even &quot;pensionados&quot;, who immigrated on government scholarships, were treated poorly.

In Hawaii, Filipino Americans often have little identification with their heritage, and it has been documented that many disclaim their ethnicity. This may be due to the &quot;colonial mentality&quot;, or the idea that Western ideals and physical characteristics are superior to their own. Although categorized as Asian Americans, Filipino Americans have not fully embraced being part of this racial category due to marginalization by other Asian-American groups and or the dominant American society. This created a struggle within Filipino American communities over how far to assimilate. The term &quot;white-washed&quot; has been applied to those seeking to further assimilate. Those who disclaim their ethnicity lose the positive adjustment to outcomes that are found in those who have a strong, positive, ethnic identity.

Of the ten largest immigrant groups, Filipino Americans have the highest rate of assimilation, with the exception of cuisine. Filipino Americans have been described as the most &quot;Americanized&quot; of the Asian-American ethnicities. However, even though Filipino Americans are the second-largest group among Asian Americans, community activists have described the ethnicity as &quot;invisible&quot;, claiming that the group is virtually unknown to the American public, and is often not seen as significant even among its members. Another term for this status is &quot;forgotten minority&quot;.

This description has also been used in the political arena, given the lack of political mobilization. In the mid-1990s it was estimated that some one hundred Filipino Americans have been elected or appointed to public office. This lack of political representation contributes to the perception that Filipino Americans are invisible.

The concept is also used to describe how the ethnicity has assimilated. Few affirmative action programs target the group although affirmative action programs rarely target Asian Americans in general. Assimilation was easier given that the group is majority religiously Christian, fluent in English, and have high levels of education. The concept was in greater use in the past, before the post-1965 wave of arrivals.

The term &quot;invisible minority&quot; has been used for Asian Americans as a whole, and the term &quot;model minority&quot; has been applied to Filipinos as well as other Asian-American groups. Filipino critics allege that Filipino Americans are ignored in immigration literature and studies.

As with fellow Asian Americans, Filipino Americans are viewed as &quot;perpetual foreigners&quot;, even for those born in the United States. This has resulted in physical attacks on Filipino Americans, as well as non-violent forms of discrimination.

In college and high school campuses, many Filipino-American student organizations put on annual Pilipino Culture Nights to showcase dances, perform skits, and comment on issues such as identity and lack of cultural awareness due to assimilation and colonization.

Filipino-American gay, lesbian, transgender, and bisexual identities are often shaped by immigration status, generation, religion, and racial formation.

====Suicide ideation and depression====
Mental health is a topic that is seldom spoken about among the Filipino-American community because of the stigma that is attached to it. In the documentary &quot;Silent Sacrifices: Voices of the Filipino American Family&quot; Patricia Heras points out that a lack of communication between first-generation and second-generation Filipino-American immigrants can lead to family members not understanding the personal hardships that each one goes through. Some of the main topics of discussion in this documentary are depression and suicide ideation experienced by the second-generation youth. These topics are supported by a study that was conducted in 1997 by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that revealed that 45.6% of Filipina American teenage students in San Diego public schools had seriously thought about committing suicide. Half of those students had actually attempted suicide. Although depression cannot be said to cause suicide, the high scores of depression and low self-esteem show a relation to the high scores of suicidal thoughts among Filipinos.

Depression in Filipinos can sometimes be difficult to notice without digging deeper into their feelings. Filipinos can display their depression in many ways such as showing extreme suffering or smiling even when it may not seem authentic. Some of the common causes of depression include: financial worries, family separation during the immigration process, and cultural conflict. One of these cultural conflicts is the belief that one must base decisions on what will &quot;save face&quot; for the family. A study was published in 2018 by Janet Chang and Frank Samson about Filipino American youth and their non-Filipino friends. They had found that Filipino American youth with three or more close non-Filipino friends were more likely to experience depression and anxiety more so than Filipino American youth with two or less non-Filipino friends that they considered to be close. Although having friends of diverse backgrounds gave these Filipinos a sense of inclusion among their peers, they also gained a heightened awareness of discrimination.

===Veterans===

During World War II, some 250,000 to 400,000 Filipinos served in the United States Military, in units including the Philippine Scouts, Philippine Commonwealth Army under U.S. Command, and recognized guerrillas during the Japanese Occupation. In January 2013, ten thousand surviving Filipino-American veterans of World War II lived in the United States, and a further fourteen thousand in the Philippines, although some estimates found eighteen thousand or fewer surviving veterans.

The U.S. government promised these soldiers all of the benefits afforded to other veterans. However, in 1946, the United States Congress passed the Rescission Act of 1946 which stripped Filipino veterans of the promised benefits. One estimate claims that monies due to these veterans for back pay and other benefits exceeds one billion dollars. Of the sixty-six countries allied with the United States during the war, the Philippines is the only country that did not receive military benefits from the United States. The phrase &quot;Second Class Veterans&quot; has been used to describe their status.

Many Filipino veterans traveled to the United States to lobby Congress for these benefits. Since 1993, numerous bills have been introduced in Congress to pay the benefits, but all died in committee. As recently as 2018, these bills have received bipartisan support.

Representative Hanabusa submitted legislation to award Filipino Veterans with a Congressional Gold Medal. Known as the Filipino Veterans of World War II Congressional Gold Medal Act, it was referred to the Committee on Financial Services and the Committee on House Administration. As of February 2012 had attracted 41 cosponsors. In January 2017, the medal was approved.

There was a proposed lawsuit to be filed in 2011 by The Justice for Filipino American Veterans against the Department of Veterans Affairs.

In the late 1980s, efforts towards reinstating benefits first succeeded with the incorporation of Filipino veteran naturalization in the Immigration Act of 1990. Over 30,000 such veterans had immigrated, with mostly American citizens, receiving benefits relating to their service.

Similar language to those bills was inserted by the Senate into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 which provided a one time payment of at least 9,000 USD to eligible non-US Citizens and US$15,000 to eligible US Citizens via the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund. These payments went to those recognized as soldiers or guerrillas or their spouses. The list of eligibles is smaller than the list recognized by the Philippines. Additionally, recipients had to waive all rights to possible future benefits. As of March 2011, 42 percent (24,385) of claims had been rejected; By 2017, more than 22,000 people received about $226 million in one time payments.

In the 113th Congress, Representative Joe Heck reintroduced his legislation to allow documents from the Philippine government and the U.S. Army to be accepted as proof of eligibility. Known as H.R. 481, it was referred to the Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs. In 2013, the U.S. released a previously classified report detailing guerrilla activities, including guerrilla units not on the &quot;Missouri list&quot;.

In September 2012, the Social Security Administration announced that non-resident Filipino World War II veterans were eligible for certain social security benefits; however an eligible veteran would lose those benefits if they visited for more than one month in a year, or immigrated.

Beginning in 2008, a bipartisan effort started by Mike Thompson and Tom Udall an effort began to recognize the contributions of Filipinos during World War 2; by the time Barack Obama signed the effort into law in 2016, a mere fifteen thousand of those veterans were estimated to be alive. Of those living Filipino veterans of World War II, there were an estimated 6,000 living in the United States. Finally in October 2017, the recognition occurred with the awarding of a Congressional Gold Medal. When the medal was presented by the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, several surviving veterans were at the ceremony. The medal now resides in the National Museum of American History.

==Holidays==
Congress established Asian Pacific American Heritage Month in May to commemorate Filipino American and other Asian American cultures. Upon becoming the largest Asian American group in California, October was established as Filipino American History Month to acknowledge the first landing of Filipinos on October 18, 1587 in Morro Bay, California. It is widely celebrated by Filipino Americans.

<text>Kirk Stevens (born August 17, 1958) is a Canadian former professional snooker player.

==Career==
Stevens started playing young, achieving his first aged just 12. He turned professional aged 20, and reached the semi-finals of the World Championship aged 21. In 1984 he achieved a maximum 147 break in a televised match against Jimmy White in the Benson &amp; Hedges Masters, which remained the only such break ever made in the competition until Ding Junhui achieved the same feat in 2007. His stylish choice of attire (he often appeared at major tournaments wearing an all-white suit, as opposed to the traditional black suit with a white shirt) and his youthful &#x27;popstar&#x27; good looks made him a ladies&#x27; favourite.

In 1985 he was wrongfully accused of taking stimulants before the final of the Dulux British Open Snooker Championship by South African Silvino Francisco. Stevens lost 9–12. Francisco was subsequently fined by the world governing body of snooker, the WPBSA, for the comments. The WPBSA, accepted that the accusation was false and it is on record that Stevens has never failed a drugs test in the history of his career. Shortly after the comments were made public, Stevens admitted to an addiction to cocaine in his personal life.

Although he underwent treatment, his career never really recovered. He dropped out of the top 16 in 1986/87, but continued to play on until 1992/93, before returning home to Canada and retiring from professional tournament play on the world circuit.

After returning to Canada Stevens won the Canadian Amateur Championship in 1997, 1998, 2000, 2002, and 2008. In 2011 he returned to the Crucible Theatre for the first time since 1988 to play in a &quot;Snooker Legends&quot; exhibition event.

On September 23, 2019, Jimmy White published an apology to Stevens on White&#x27;s official Facebook page stating that in his autobiography &quot;Second Wind&quot; he misremembered a few stories as occurring with Stevens that in fact did not. These events were widely broadcast in the media and White wanted to make the apology public to prevent them from being repeated. White further stated that he did not intend his words to be interpreted as meaning that Stevens introduced him to crack cocaine or that Stevens ever played WPBSA snooker under the influence of drugs.

<doc id="679656" wikidata="Q708554" url="?curid=679656" title="Vincent J. McMahon">
<text>Vincent James McMahon (July 6, 1914 – May 24, 1984), also referred to as Vince McMahon Sr., was an American professional wrestling promoter. He is best known for running the Capitol Wrestling Corporation, later known as the World Wide Wrestling Federation and the World Wrestling Federation (and now known as WWE). His father, Jess McMahon, and his son Vince McMahon were also professional wrestling promoters.

==Early life==
Vincent James McMahon was born on July 6, 1914, in Harlem, New York to Rose (née Davis) and Roderick James &quot;Jess&quot; McMahon, a successful boxing, wrestling and concert promoter, who had worked with legendary Madison Square Garden promoter Tex Rickard. His parents were both of Irish descent. He had an older brother, Roderick James Jr., and a younger sister, Dorothy.

== Professional wrestling ==
McMahon saw the tremendous potential for growth that the professional wrestling industry had in the era following World War II, especially with the development of television and its need for new programming. Similar to boxing, wrestling took place primarily within a small ring and could be covered adequately by one or two cameras, and venues for it could readily be assembled in television studios, lessening production costs.
McMahon&#x27;s group, the Capitol Wrestling Corporation, which was later renamed World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) and the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), came to dominate professional wrestling in the 1950s and 1960s in the nation&#x27;s most populous area, the Northeast. His control was primarily in Baltimore, New York, and New Jersey. Despite its name, the WWWF was, like all professional wrestling promotions of that era, mostly a regional operation. It was however the one that came to dominate the most lucrative region. In 1956, McMahon began airing his matches on television on Wednesday nights on the DuMont Network. The telecast originated from an old barn in Washington, D.C. It was one of the struggling network&#x27;s last live sports telecasts before it went out of business the following year; however, WABD, DuMont&#x27;s flagship station in New York (Now Fox-owned WNYW), kept the show after becoming an independent station, airing wrestling on Saturday nights until 1971.

In her biography, wrestler The Fabulous Moolah claimed that McMahon was one of the first promoters to split gate proceeds with his wrestlers. Unlike his son, McMahon believed that the job of a promoter should be kept backstage or behind the scenes and should never interfere with the action in the ring. As a result, McMahon almost never came down to the squared circle. He can however clearly be seen standing ringside during the infamous Madison Square Garden &quot;Alley Fight&quot; between Sgt. Slaughter and Pat Patterson. Though McMahon appeared in the movie &quot;The Wrestler&quot; in a cast that was dominated by contemporary wrestlers, he believed that wrestlers should remain wrestlers and not branch off into other forms of media. Accordingly, he disapproved of Hulk Hogan&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Rocky III&quot; in 1982, leading to Hogan&#x27;s temporary departure from the WWF for Verne Gagne&#x27;s American Wrestling Association. When his son purchased the WWF, he felt differently than his father on the issue. He rehired Hogan as his top star and avidly supported wrestlers branching out into other fields, as well as cross-promotions with various musicians, actors, and other personalities outside of wrestling.

In 1982, McMahon sold the parent company of the World Wrestling Federation to his son Vincent K. McMahon and his company Titan Sports, Inc. His son, much to his father&#x27;s initial concern, set out to make the WWF national and eventually worldwide in scope. &quot;Had my father known what I was going to do&quot;, the younger McMahon told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in 1991, &quot;he never would have sold his stock to me.&quot; The younger McMahon&#x27;s competitive tactics were successful, and the WWF quickly became the most prominent exponent of &quot;sports entertainment&quot;. His son Vince has been at the helm of the McMahon family promotion, which since 2002 has been called World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). McMahon&#x27;s grandchildren Shane and Stephanie used to work for the WWF/E. McMahon was posthumously inducted into the WWF Hall of Fame Class of 1996, by his grandson, Shane.

==Personal life and death==
McMahon had two sons with his first wife Victoria &quot;Vicky&quot; H. Askew (née Hanner; 1920–2022): Roderick James &quot;Rod&quot; McMahon III (1943–2021) and Vincent K. McMahon (born 1945). He married his second wife, Juanita Wynne Johnston (1916–1998), and the couple retired to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. McMahon would not live to see his company grow from a territorial promotion to what is now a worldwide organization. On May 24, 1984, McMahon died at age 69 from pancreatic cancer. McMahon and his wife Juanita are buried at Our Lady Queen of Heaven Catholic Cemetery in Fort Lauderdale.

<doc id="679657" wikidata="Q7344852" url="?curid=679657" title="Robert Gordon's College">
<text>Robert Gordon&#x27;s College is a co-educational private school for day pupils in Aberdeen, Scotland. The school caters for pupils from Nursery through to S6.

==History==
===Background===
Robert Gordon, an Aberdeen merchant, made his fortune in 18th century Poland trading from the Baltic port of Danzig, (Gdansk). Upon his death in 1731, he left his entire estate in a &quot;&#x27;Deed of Mortification&quot;&#x27;, dated 13 December 1729, for the foundation of Robert Gordon&#x27;s Hospital, a residential school for poor boys. The building, designed by William Adam, was completed by 1732, but lay empty until the Governors had sufficient funds to complete the interior. A statue of the Founder was added in 1753 in a niche above the door. During the Jacobite Rising in 1746, the building was requisitioned by Hanoverian troops under the command of the Duke of Cumberland and was known as Fort Cumberland. 

The hospital opened its doors to its first 14 pupils in July 1750. East and West wings with classical colonnades, designed by the architect John Smith, were added in 1830–33, partly funded by the generous bequest of Alexander Simpson of Collyhill.

===Establishment===

Robert Gordon&#x27;s intention was to found &quot;“an Hospital for the maintenance, aliment, entertainment and education of young boys, whose parents are poor and indigent and not able to maintain them at schools and put them to trades and employment&quot;”, in other words, to give poor boys of Aberdeen a solid education and foundation for life. Until 1881, the pupils received their education, board and lodging and a uniform free of charge but in 1881, the status of the institution changed and it became a fee-paying day school with the new name of Robert Gordon&#x27;s College. The charitable aspect continued, with Foundations and Bursaries being available for boys whose parents could not afford to send them to be educated there.

In 1882, evening and day classes in vocational subjects were instituted and made available to adults who were seeking to further their education. In 1903, the vocational arm was designated a Central Institution. Its name changed in 1910 to Robert Gordon&#x27;s Technical College and, in 1965, to Robert Gordon&#x27;s Institute of Technology. 

===Recent history===

Boarding facilities for pupils returned in 1937 with the establishment of Sillerton House in the west end of Aberdeen. It closed in 1995. In 1989, RGC became a co-educational school. In 2010, the new Junior School was officially opened and six years later, the Wood Centre for Science and Technology and the Craig Centre for Performing Arts were officially opened by HRH The Princess Royal.

In 1992, RGIT gained university status and became the Robert Gordon University. The school has continued to be known as Robert Gordon&#x27;s College.

Robert Gordon&#x27;s College consists of a Nursery, Junior School and Senior School for children aged 3 to 18 years. Robert Gordon&#x27;s College follows the Scottish curriculum.

==Overview==
===Arms and motto===
The coat of arms shows the boar of the Gordon family, and a fort or keep on a red background, similar to the towers on a red background on the coat of arms of Aberdeen.

The current coat of arms dates from 1917. They were changed when it was discovered that the college had not registered the coat of arms that were previously in use as was legally required. A new college seal was produced once new arms had been approved by the Lord Lyon.

The Latin motto of the college, &quot;Omni nunc arte magistra&quot; translates to &quot;Now is the time for all your masterly skill&quot;; it is more commonly presented as &quot;Be The Best That You Can Be&quot;. It dates from 1882, after the school had been converted into a day school and a new coat of arms and seal came into use. The motto was suggested by William Geddes, a professor of Greek at Aberdeen University, and comes from the Aeneid, reporting the words of the god Vulcan. The original seal of the hospital contained the motto &quot;Imperat hoc natura potens&quot;, translating as &quot;by nature&#x27;s sovereign command&quot;, which was taken from the Satires of Horace.

===House system===
The school has four houses, to one of which each student is allocated upon entering the school. The houses compete in various activities (such as netball, football, mathematics, cross country, poetry, and various other events) throughout the year and gain points which contribute to the annual John Reid Trophy award. The house system was introduced at Christmas 1928 to encourage competition in various sports.

The four houses are:
*Blackfriars – named for the Dominican friars (or black friars due to their garb), that once had a convent adjacent to the school grounds.
*Collyhill – named for Alexander Simpson of Collyhill who bequeathed a large sum of money to the school, which allowed for more boys to join the school.
*Sillerton – The origin of the Sillerton house name is not clear, but it is believed that, in Robert Gordon&#x27;s lifetime, he was known as Gordon of Silverton (&quot;siller&quot; being Scots for &quot;silver&quot;), and on a 1746 map, the school is identified as Sillerton Hospital.
*Straloch – named for Robert Gordon of Straloch, one of the first graduates of Marischal College, studying humanities, mathematics and philosophy.

<doc id="679660" wikidata="Q4921296" url="?curid=679660" title="Black Mischief">
<text>Black Mischief is Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s third novel, published in 1932. Expanded from a novella, &#x27;Seth&#x27;, the novel chronicles the efforts of the British-educated Emperor Seth, assisted by a fellow Oxford University graduate, Basil Seal, to modernise his Empire, the fictional African island of Azania, located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.

The novel was written while Waugh was as a house guest at Madresfield Court in Worcestershire. The old nursery had been converted into a writing room for Waugh. The novel is dedicated to the Lygon sisters, who had the run of the place (their father, William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp, having been forced into exile in 1931 under threat of prosecution for his homosexuality), and posed for some of the drawings Waugh did for the first edition.

When &quot;Black Mischief&quot; was published in 1932, the editor of the Catholic journal &quot;The Tablet&quot;, Ernest Oldmeadow, launched a violent attack on the book and its author, stating that the novel was &quot;a disgrace to anybody professing the Catholic name&quot;. Waugh, wrote Oldmeadow, &quot;was intent on elaborating a work outrageous not only to Catholic but to ordinary standards of modesty&quot;. Waugh made no public rebuttal of these charges; an open letter to the Cardinal Archbishop of Westminster was prepared, but on the advice of Waugh&#x27;s friends was not sent.

The novel has been published in the United Kingdom by Penguin Classics (), and in the United States by Back Bay Books ().

==Plot synopsis==
After winning a civil war against his late father Seyid (who is unfortunately eaten by his own soldiers), Seth, Oxford-educated emperor of the fictional nation of Azania, makes it his goal to modernise his country. He recruits Basil Seal, a shiftless college friend and heir to an English political family in the country after stealing his mother’s jewellery to pay for his ticket, to preside over the newly established Ministry of Modernization, with the help of Krikor Yokoumian, a successful Armenian shopkeeper and fixer. Basil enters into the society of the capital, Debra Dowa. This consists mainly of various heads of society and government, including the head of the Army, General Connolly. Connolly was a former Irish game-warden who had taken a local wife, whom he refers to as &quot;Black Bitch&quot;, as the Duke &amp; Duchess of Ukaka; the Minister of the Interior Viscount Boaz, and the Earl of Ngumo; the representatives of the British diplomatic corps, interested only in the legation garden and gossip from home at the expense of any interest in local affairs, headed by a failed career diplomat Sir Samson Courteney; Monsieur Ballon, the French freemason consul, determined that all actions on the part of the British are in fact coded pieces of a great master plan and his wife, generally believed to be having an affair with General Connolly after French agents overhear a game of consequences at a party; and two members of the RSPCA, Dame Mildred Porch and Miss Sarah Tin, who the Azanians believe are there to assist in creating more efficient ways to be cruel to animals.

After a period of rapid but haphazard modernisation, including renaming the street the Anglican Cathedral is on &quot;Place Marie Stopes&quot;, Emperor Seth launches his own currency. This last act is the start of his downfall. Unbeknownst to Seth and the Ministry, the French consul Ballon plans a coup d&#x27;état. At a &quot;Birth Control Parade&quot; organised by Seth, Ballon and several religious leaders overthrow the Emperor and install his senile uncle Achon. The British nationals in Debra Dowa flee the town to impose on Sir Samson’s grudging hospitality. Blind, senile Achon dies upon coronation, having spent 50 years in prison after supposedly being eaten by lions, and Seth dies in hiding, killed by his own Minister, who is in turn killed on Basil’s orders. Basil attends Seth&#x27;s funeral feast and discovers afterwards that he has eaten the stewed remains of his girlfriend Prudence Courteney, the coddled daughter of the British Minister, whose plane had vanished after the evacuation of the British compound. With no heir to the monarchy, the League of Nations steps in and claims the country as a League of Nations Mandate. Basil returns to England and disturbs his old friends because he has become serious.

<doc id="679662" wikidata="Q17514388" url="?curid=679662" title="Capitol Wrestling Corporation">
<text>Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was an American sports promotion company. Run by Vincent J. McMahon from the 1950s until the 1980s, the company was originally a professional wrestling and boxing promotion and later became the holding company for the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), later the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). In 1982, the CWC was acquired by Titan Sports, Inc., owned by Vincent J.&#x27;s son Vincent K. McMahon. The CWC was the precursor to today&#x27;s WWE, currently run by Nick Khan as president and owned by TKO Group Holdings.

==History==
===Early history (1953–1963)===
Jess McMahon was a successful professional boxing promoter who began working with Tex Rickard in 1926. With the help of Rickard, he began promoting boxing at the third Madison Square Garden. McMahon would later take over the wrestling side of Rickard&#x27;s promotional business; Rickard was noted for disliking wrestling and prevented wrestling events from being held at Madison Square Garden. A few years prior to 1926, professional wrestler Toots Mondt had created a new style of professional wrestling that he called “Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling”. The advent of Slam Bang Western Style Wrestling ultimately transformed professional wrestling from a legitimate combat sport into a series of predetermined pseudo-competitive exhibitions. Mondt convinced wrestler Ed Lewis, who then held the World Heavyweight Wrestling Championship, and his manager Billy Sandow to embrace this new predetermined style of wrestling, with the three men forming a business partnership dubbed the &quot;Gold Dust Trio&quot;. The Gold Dust Trio formed what is considered the first modern promotion in professional wrestling history and were successful in getting many wrestlers of the time to sign contracts with their promotion. After much success, a power struggle amongst its members caused the trio to dissolve and, with it, their promotion. Mondt later formed partnerships with several other promoters, including Jack Curley in New York City. Curley&#x27;s ill health led to Mondt, aided by Jess McMahon and others, taking over the New York City wrestling scene. Mondt&#x27;s control over wrestling in New York City ended after promoter Jack Pfefer revealed the predetermined nature of wrestling to the area&#x27;s sports writers, harming wrestling&#x27;s popularity in the city. Mondt additionally had major disagreements with his top star Antonino Rocca, which led to Mondt&#x27;s partner Ray Fabiani aligning with other promoters to appease Rocca.

On January 7, 1953, the first show under the Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) banner was produced. It is not certain who the founder of the CWC was. Some sources state that it was Jess&#x27; son Vincent J. McMahon while other sources (including the website of the CWC&#x27;s successor, WWE) credit Jess himself as the founder of the CWC. Shortly after its founding, the CWC joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and Mondt soon after joined the CWC. Together, Vincent J. McMahon and Toots Mondt were very successful and controlled approximately 70% of the NWA board&#x27;s booking decisions, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated northeastern United States.

===World Wide Wrestling Federation (1963–1979)===
In early 1963, the CWC pulled out of the NWA and transformed into the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF), the precursor to current-day WWE, following a dispute over CWC wrestler Buddy Rogers being booked to lose the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Lou Thesz. McMahon and Mondt continued to promote Rogers as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, despite his loss to Thesz, until April 11 when they awarded him the inaugural WWWF World Heavyweight Championship. Rogers lost the WWWF title to Bruno Sammartino on May 17. Despite the change in the promotion&#x27;s trade name, the company was still known legally as Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd., which served as the holding company for the WWWF and later the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) until 1982. 

The WWWF operated in a conservative manner compared to other wrestling promotions of its time; it ran its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or bi-weekly, usually featuring a babyface champion wrestling various heels in programs that consisted of one to three matches. After gaining a television deal and turning the well-known tag team wrestler Lou Albano into a manager for Sammartino&#x27;s heel opponents, the WWWF began doing sell out business and, by 1970, became one of the largest promotions of wrestling&#x27;s territorial era.

After disagreements over television deals which were compounded by issues caused by his gambling addiction, Mondt was &quot;muscled out&quot; of the leadership of the WWWF and ultimately sold off his shares to McMahon in the mid-1960s. McMahon later made Mondt a salaried employee of the WWWF, an arrangement that continued until Mondt&#x27;s death on June 11, 1976. The WWWF rejoined the NWA in 1971.

===Rebranding and sale to Titan Sports (1979–1982)===
By March 1979, for marketing purposes, the World Wide Wrestling Federation was renamed the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). The following year, Vincent J. McMahon&#x27;s son, Vincent K. McMahon, founded Titan Sports, Inc., which incorporated on February 21, 1980, originally in Massachusetts. Vincent K. McMahon had served as a ring announcer and commentator for WWWF television programs since 1969. Beginning in 1971, he began promoting events for his father in isolated regions of the WWWF territory, primarily in Maine.

In 1982, Titan Sports, Inc. acquired Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd., effectively relocating its headquarters from New York City to Greenwich, Connecticut. At the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and WWF employee Jim Barnett all withdrew from the organization. In 1984, in an attempt to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the world, McMahon began a national (and later international) expansion that fundamentally changed the wrestling industry and brought an end to its territorial era. By 1985, Titan Sports moved its headquarters to Titan Towers in Stamford, Connecticut and, in 1987, reincorporated itself under Delaware General Corporation Law. Titan Sports later changed its name to World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. in 1999, and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE) in 2002. Vincent J. McMahon would not live to see his company transform from a territorial Northeast-based wrestling promotion into a worldwide entertainment organization. He died from pancreatic cancer at 69 years old on May 24, 1984.

==Legacy==
In October 2020, WWE&#x27;s NXT brand introduced the &quot;Capitol Wrestling Center&quot;, a new home studio in Orlando, Florida within the WWE Performance Center training facility, which was named as a tribute to the CWC.

<doc id="679665" wikidata="Q5361582" url="?curid=679665" title="Élisabeth de Rothschild">
<text>Élisabeth, Baroness de Rothschild (née Pelletier de Chambure; a.k.a. Lili; 9 March 190223 March 1945) was a member by marriage of the wine-making branch of the Rothschild family and Holocaust victim.

==Biography==
Born in Paris as Élisabeth Pelletier de Chambure, into a wealthy Catholic family whose roots were in the Burgundy region. Her ancestors included the Napoleonic general Laurent Augustin Pelletier de Chambure. Known as Lily, she was the daughter of Auguste Pelletier de Chambure, a mayor of Escrignelles, and his wife, née Camille Marie Courtois Desquibes.

In 1923, Élisabeth Pelletier de Chambure married Jonkheer , a Belgian aristocrat. They had a son, Edouard Jacques Marie Augustin (1924-1984), and a daughter, Philippine Mathilde Camille (1933-2014), though the latter&#x27;s biological father was French baron Philippe de Rothschild. Rothschild was a member of the prominent banking family and the owner of one of France&#x27;s most famous vineyards, Château Mouton Rothschild in Pauillac in the Médoc; he was also a cousin by marriage of her husband.

On 22 January 1934, immediately after her divorce from Becker-Rémy, Élisabeth married Philippe de Rothschild. She converted to Judaism from Catholicism, and the religious ceremony was conducted by Julien Weill, the grand rabbi of Paris. In addition to their daughter, the Rothschilds had a son, Charles Henri (born and died in 1938). Philippe&#x27;s memoirs (&quot;Milady Vine&quot;, written in collaboration with British director Joan Littlewood) describe his marriage to Élisabeth as one of great passion but also enormous tempestuousness and despair. The couple&#x27;s difficulties increased when their son was born deformed and soon died. They eventually separated acrimoniously, and by 1939, the baroness reverted to using her maiden name of Pelletier de Chambure.

Following the German occupation of France in World War II, she and her estranged husband were arrested by the Vichy government and the vineyard property seized. They were then released, whereupon Philippe left France, moving to England, to join the Free French Forces and support General Charles de Gaulle. In 1941, the Gestapo arrested Élisabeth on charges of attempting to cross the line of demarcation with a forged permit and sent her to the Ravensbrück concentration camp, located about 50 miles north of Berlin, where she died.

Meryle Secrest tells a story in his biography of Elsa Schiaparelli that suggests Rothschild&#x27;s death in a Nazi concentration camp was linked to her changing seats at Schiaparelli&#x27;s fashion show to avoid the German Ambassador to the Vichy government, Heinrich Otto Abetz and not to the fact that she had converted to Judaism or tried to escape.

On his return to France following the Allies&#x27; liberation, Philippe de Rothschild learned that the Gestapo had, on charges of attempting to cross a line of demarcation with a forged permit, deported his estranged wife in 1941 to Ravensbrück concentration camp where she diedthe cause of her death remains unresolvedon 23 March 1945. Élisabeth reportedly died of epidemic typhus on 23 March 1945 at Ravensbrück, though Philippe&#x27;s memoir states that she was thrown into a concentration-camp oven, alive.

<doc id="679668" wikidata="Q233905" url="?curid=679668" title="Linda McMahon">
<text>Linda Marie McMahon (; née Edwards; born October 4, 1948) is an American politician, business executive, and former professional wrestling performer. She was the 25th administrator of the Small Business Administration from 2017 to 2019. McMahon has been nominated to lead the Department of Education under the second Trump administration. Her confirmation hearing took place on February 13.

McMahon, along with her husband, Vince McMahon, founded sports entertainment company Titan Sports, Inc. (later World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.) where she worked as the president and later CEO from 1980 to 2009. During this time, the company grew from a regional business in the northeast to a large multinational corporation. Among other things, she initiated the company&#x27;s civic programs, &quot;Get R.E.A.L.&quot; and &quot;SmackDown! Your Vote&quot;. She made occasional on-screen performances, most notably in a feud with her husband that culminated at WrestleMania X-Seven. In 2009, she left World Wrestling Entertainment to run for a seat in the United States Senate from Connecticut as a Republican, but lost to Democrat Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 general election. She was the Republican nominee for Connecticut&#x27;s other Senate seat in the 2012 race, but lost to Democrat Chris Murphy.

On December 7, 2016, Donald Trump (president-elect at the time) announced that he would nominate McMahon to be administrator of the Small Business Administration. The Senate confirmation hearing began on January 24, 2017, and on February 1, her nomination was approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship with an 18–1 vote and confirmed by the full Senate on February 14, by a vote of 81–19. On March 29, 2019, the Trump administration announced McMahon would step down as the administrator of the Small Business Administration to assume new responsibilities within President Trump&#x27;s reelection campaign, and the resignation took effect on April 12. On April 15, she was named chairwoman of America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC.

On November 19, 2024, McMahon was nominated by Donald Trump to serve as Secretary of Education.

==Early life==
McMahon was born Linda Marie Edwards in New Bern, North Carolina, in a Welsh-American family, the daughter of Evelyn and Henry Edwards. She was an only child and grew up as a &quot;tomboy&quot; playing basketball and baseball. Her parents were both employees at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, a military base. She grew up in a conservative Baptist family, but converted to Roman Catholicism in her later years.

Linda M. Edwards, at the age of 13, met Vince McMahon, then age 16. Her mother worked in the same building as McMahon&#x27;s mother, but they had not met.

Vince&#x27;s mother became good friends with the Edwards family, and Vince, who had lived with several abusive stepfathers, enjoyed the feeling of stability that he felt at their home. Edwards and McMahon dated throughout their high school years; she attended Havelock High School and he attended Fishburne Military School in Virginia. During this time, Vince was a &quot;permanent fixture&quot; at her home, and spent hours with Linda and her family.

Shortly after her high school graduation, Vince asked her to marry him. They married on August 26, 1966, when she was 17, and he was 21. She enrolled at East Carolina University in 1966, where she obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in French. The academic program she completed was designed to prepare teachers for instruction. From 1968 to 1971, Vince worked as a traveling cup salesman before joining his father&#x27;s company, the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). Their son Shane was born in 1970, followed by daughter Stephanie in 1976.

==Early career==
In 1969, the McMahons moved to Gaithersburg, Maryland. McMahon worked as a receptionist at the corporate law firm of Covington &amp; Burling; she translated French documents, trained as a paralegal in the probate department, and studied intellectual property rights.

Financially, the couple fared poorly for several years and, despite her husband working at a quarry, briefly received food stamps. In 1976, after a series of failed business ventures including financing stunt performer Evel Knievel&#x27;s Snake River Canyon Jump, and while pregnant with Stephanie, McMahon and her husband filed for bankruptcy.

By 1979, Vince decided to start promoting wrestling events at the Cape Cod Coliseum. He purchased the Coliseum in Massachusetts and founded Titan Sports, Inc. in 1980. The McMahons held small hockey and other sporting events in addition to wrestling at the Cape Cod Coliseum. At one point, Linda cooked meatball sandwiches to feed the fans at these sporting events. As the company grew, Linda assisted Vince with administration and used her knowledge of intellectual property law to assist in trademark protection for the company. During much of those early years, she had little interest in professional wrestling.

In 1982, Vince McMahon&#x27;s Titan Sports, Inc. purchased Capitol Wrestling, better known as the parent company of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), from his father. He later expanded his market by airing WWF shows on national television.

In 1983, the McMahons moved to Greenwich, Connecticut. They have six grandchildren.

==World Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Entertainment==

===Corporate roles===

Linda McMahon co-founded Titan Sports, Inc. in 1980. Many workers in the company referred to her as the &quot;co-chief executive&quot;. McMahon became president in 1993 and CEO of the company in 1997. The company&#x27;s explosive growth and the way it transformed the wrestling industry caused some observers to label her and Vince &quot;business geniuses&quot;.

One of her major interests in WWF and WWE was product merchandising. She negotiated many of the company&#x27;s business deals with outside vendors and established the company&#x27;s first line of action figures, Wrestling Superstars, in 1984. It was a first in the wrestling industry and helped expand the company&#x27;s popularity with children. She was also the primary negotiator for the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s 2000 TV deal with Viacom.

During an interview with &quot;The Detroit News&quot;, when asked what it was like being CEO in a &quot;testosterone-charged industry,&quot; McMahon replied, &quot;It&#x27;s lots of fun. I&#x27;m an only child, so I grew up as my father&#x27;s son and mother&#x27;s daughter. I was quite a jock. I played baseball, basketball—I think that background made Vince and I very compatible. I really have a very good understanding of the male psyche—I&#x27;m very comfortable in a guy environment. I have to say that there are very strong women in this company as well. Our human resources division and our consumer goods division are headed by women—It&#x27;s still a testosterone business, and I like it.&quot;

On September 16, 2009, Linda McMahon resigned from her position as CEO of WWE and left WWE to run as a Republican for a seat in the United States Senate from Connecticut. However, she still remains a minority owner of WWE.

====McMahon&#x27;s memorandum to Pat Patterson====
In a 1989 memo to the company&#x27;s vice president, Pat Patterson, McMahon directed Patterson to fire on-call physician George Zahorian and inform him of imminent legal charges charging him with steroid distribution.

This memo became known publicly as the &quot;Tip-Off Memo&quot; during her campaign for Senate in 2010. It became a political liability used against her in both the nomination and general election campaigns.

====Federal steroids investigation====
Following the murder-suicide of Chris Benoit in 2007, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee investigated steroid usage in the wrestling industry. The Committee investigated WWE and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), asking for documentation of their companies&#x27; drug policies. The McMahons both testified. The documents stated that 75 wrestlers—roughly 40 percent—had tested positive for drug use since 2006, most commonly for steroids.

McMahon was asked why there had been no follow-up during a televised interview with &quot;CBS Face the State&quot; on January 20, 2010, and responded: &quot;There&#x27;s not been any follow-up from any of the inquiries that were made because I believe we had furnished thousands of documents and testimony for them, and I think if they looked at our policy and really delved into it, they would be very satisfied.&quot;

====PG rating====

In July 2008, WWE changed its TV parental guidelines rating from TV-14 to TV-PG. In December 2008, at a UBS Media Conference, McMahon described the new rating as a marketing strategy to attract a young generation of wrestling fans and create loyalty to the brand. Due to the TV-PG rating, chair shots to the head were banned, as well as sex scenes, blood, and vulgar language.

====Company legacy====
During the 1980s, the WWF successfully overcame considerable opposition and some media ridicule in lobbying for deregulation in Connecticut, Delaware, Michigan, New Jersey, California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and Texas. By 2000, fewer than half of the 50 states had athletic regulations on the wrestling industry.

Following common practice in professional sports, WWE classifies its wrestlers as independent contractors rather than employees. The classification allowed the company to avoid paying Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance for wrestlers. McMahon stated the WWE wrestlers had lucrative contracts, merchandising deals, royalty payments, and appearance fees. She noted that many of the wrestlers had agents and considered them to be on par with &quot;singers, golfers, or tennis players&quot;. The company offered seminars to help wrestlers select health insurance plans.

Under McMahon&#x27;s tenure, WWE became one of the largest recipients of special tax credits for film and TV production granted by the state of Connecticut.

During her 2010 campaign, Blumenthal&#x27;s campaign criticized her and WWE for accepting the tax credits while laying off workers in 2009.

===On-screen roles===
McMahon often referred to the creative side of WWE as Vince&#x27;s specialty, stating that she was primarily in the management team, although she appeared in several storylines. McMahon debuted on WWF TV during the Corporate Ministry storyline, on the May 3, 1999, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; during the Attitude Era. During an interview with Fox News, she said that she often did not know what the storylines were in advance and watched events unfold as the general public did.

===Charitable work through WWE=== 
====Donations and achievements====
Through WWE, the McMahons were major donors to The Donald J. Trump Foundation, giving $4 million in 2007 and $5 million in 2009. The McMahons donated over $8 million in 2008 to the Fishburne Military School, Sacred Heart University, and East Carolina University. &quot;Nonprofit Quarterly&quot; noted the majority of the McMahons&#x27; donations were towards capital expenditures. In 2006, they paid $2.5 million for construction of a tennis facility in Ebensburg, Pennsylvania. As of 2010, she served on the board of the Close Up Foundation, a nonprofit which offers youth field trips to Washington, D.C.

McMahon became a member of the board of trustees of Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut in November 2004. She supported many organizations, including the USO, the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation, the Starlight Foundation, and Community Mayors. In 2005, she won appointment to The Make-A-Wish Foundation of America National Advisory Council and received the Arthur M. Sackler Award from the Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra for WWE&#x27;s support of its arts education program.

On January 29, 2007, Multichannel News named McMahon to its class of &quot;Wonder Women&quot; for 2007. The award recognized her outstanding contributions to the cable and telecommunications industries. In May 2007, she appeared as the keynote speaker at the Girl Scout Council of Southwestern Connecticut&#x27;s Women of Achievement Leadership Breakfast. McMahon was a Girl Scout.

Under her leadership, WWE was the recipient of the USO of Metropolitan Washington&#x27;s first ever &quot;Legacy of Hope&quot; award for its extensive support of U.S. troops and the USO&#x27;s Operation Care Package program. In 2007, the company received the Secretary of Defense Exceptional Public Service Award for its support of deployed service members in Iraq and Afghanistan. In 2008, the company received the GI Film Festival&#x27;s Corporate Patriot Award.

On April 13, 2012, Sacred Heart University officially dedicated and opened the Linda E. McMahon Commons Building on its main campus in Fairfield, Connecticut.

====Get R.E.A.L.====
McMahon launched the company&#x27;s Get R.E.A.L. program to deliver positive messages about education to young adults. The program encouraged literacy through public service announcements, posters, and bookmarks featuring wrestling superstars. In 2000, the American Library Association reported the WWF&#x27;s Know Your Role poster was its highest-selling poster for two straight months. Since 2006, thousands of posters featuring WWE superstars have been distributed to libraries and reading facilities.

====SmackDown! Your Vote campaign====
McMahon initiated WWE&#x27;s non-partisan voter registration campaign, &quot;SmackDown! Your Vote&quot;, in August 2000. The campaign targeted the 18-to-30 voter demographic, and made use of online marketing, public service announcements, and youth voting partnerships. The campaign, which registered 150,000 new voters during the 2000 election, was started in coalition with MTV&#x27;s Choose or Lose, Project Vote Smart, and Youth Vote 2000. As of the 2008 election, it listed 14 voter registration partner organizations. During the 2008 presidential election, Smackdown your Vote! registered many voters online, often in affiliation with Rock the Vote.

====Special Olympics====
The McMahons began supporting the Special Olympics in 1986. McMahon first developed an interest in the Olympics from her friendship with NBC producer Dick Ebersol and Susan Saint James, who encouraged them to participate in the mid-1980s.

She met Lowell Weicker, whose son is developmentally-disabled, through the Special Olympics. In 1995, as Connecticut Governor, Weicker appointed Linda McMahon to the Governor&#x27;s Council for the World Special Olympics.

=== Sexual abuse lawsuit ===

In October 2024, McMahon was named as a defendant in a lawsuit, accusing her, her husband, and WWE of negligence with regards to the &quot;ring boys&quot; scandal, in which multiple WWE personnel, including ring announcer Mel Phillips and executives Pat Patterson and Terry Garvin, either resigned or were dismissed in 1992 after being accused of sexually assaulting young boys; in particular, Phillips had already been dismissed in 1988 for sexual misconduct, but had been rehired several weeks afterwards under the condition that he &quot;stop chasing after kids&quot;. McMahon&#x27;s possible involvement in the ring boys scandal was known prior to her tenure as Small Business Administrator; a vetting document from Trump&#x27;s first transition team, leaked in 2019 and cited in the lawsuit, listed the scandal as a possible &quot;red flag&quot; against her. The lawsuit also alleges the McMahons fostered a culture of sexual abuse within the WWE, additionally citing the concurrent sex trafficking lawsuit and federal investigation against Vince and other allegations highlighted by the Netflix documentary series &quot;Mr. McMahon&quot;.

==Political career==
===Connecticut Board of Education===
McMahon was appointed to the Connecticut State Board of Education by Governor Jodi Rell in January 2009.

McMahon also sat on the Connecticut Board of Education for one year starting in 2009. She told lawmakers at the time that she had a lifelong interest in education and once planned to become a teacher.However, she filled out a vetting questionnaire for the board position stating that she had a degree in education from East Carolina University in 1969, when her degree was actually in French. According to a 2010 article in the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;:McMahon&#x27;s resignation from the board Thursday came a day after &quot;The Courant&quot; indicated it would be writing about her questionnaire answers, but she said one had nothing to do with the other.

She went through a confirmation process in the Connecticut State Assembly where she was questioned on her record as CEO of WWE. The State Senate approved her nomination by a vote of 34–1 and the House by 96–45 with some opponents expressing concerns that the nature of her WWE activities would send the wrong message. State representative Bruce Morris claimed she lacked &quot;depth of knowledge regarding education&quot;. However, state representative John Hetherington said it &quot;would be good to have someone outside the establishment on the board&quot;.

On April 1, 2010, McMahon resigned from the State Board of Education, because state law does not allow board members to solicit campaign contributions. Days after her resignation, the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; reported that McMahon had falsely filled out a questionnaire from the governor&#x27;s office on which she claimed to have received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in education from East Carolina University in 1969; her degree was actually in French. At the time, she claimed she thought her degree was in education because she had completed a semester of student teaching.

===Campaigns for Senate===
====2010 U.S. Senate campaign====

On September 16, 2009, McMahon announced her candidacy for U.S. senator to represent the state of Connecticut. She announced she would spend up to $50 million of her own money to finance her campaign and refused outside donations, the third most ever spent on a senatorial campaign. She ran for the Republican nomination, campaigning on promises of lower taxes, fiscal conservatism, and job creation. She campaigned as socially moderate, and identified herself as pro-choice while also opposing partial-birth abortion and federal funding for abortions.

McMahon&#x27;s spending became a key argument of one of her rivals, former congressman Rob Simmons, who accused her of &quot;buying the election&quot;. McMahon and Simmons engaged in a frequently bitter contest. At the party convention, McMahon received the most support, but Simmons received enough votes to qualify for the ballot for the August 10 primary, although he was not actively campaigning. In late July—two weeks before the primary—Simmons relaunched his campaign by airing ads on TV reminding voters that his name would be on the ballot, participating in debates, and accepting interviews with editorial boards. A third candidate, Peter Schiff, qualified for the ballot by submitting petition signatures. McMahon defeated her opponents and faced Richard Blumenthal in the general election, losing by 11.8 percentage points.

====2012 U.S. Senate campaign====

Immediately after her loss to Blumenthal, McMahon hinted she would run again for Senate in 2012. McMahon maintained a high profile following the election, running television ads, campaigning for politicians, and making frequent media appearances. When Joe Lieberman announced he would retire from the U.S. Senate, she became the Republican Party favorite for the 2012 election.

On September 20, 2011, in Southington, Connecticut, McMahon officially announced her candidacy. On May 18, 2012, McMahon earned the endorsement of the state Republican Party at the Connecticut State Republican Convention by a delegate vote of 658 to 351 over the next-highest candidate, former congressman Chris Shays. The two were the only candidates to qualify for the primary, which took place on August 14, 2012. McMahon defeated Shays by a three-to-one margin, spending $15.7 million of her money on the campaign. She lost to Democratic U.S. representative Chris Murphy in the general election, marking her second consecutive defeat.

===Political contributions===
Following her election defeats, McMahon committed herself to becoming a major Republican fundraiser and donor. She donated to groups such as American Crossroads and Ending Spending Fund, and associated with fellow mega donor Paul Singer.

As the 2016 Republican nomination process began to gear up in early 2015, McMahon, Singer, and Charles R. Schwab were among donors and prospective-candidate representatives who attended a daylong meeting near Jackson, Wyoming, that was hosted by TD Ameritrade founder Joe Ricketts and his son Todd, and featured &quot;several Republican donors who favor[ed] same-sex marriage and immigration reform&quot;.

After Donald Trump made an appearance at WrestleMania 23 in 2007, the McMahons donated $5 million to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in addition to the payment for the appearance. In 2016, McMahon donated $6 million to Rebuilding America Now, a Super PAC with the purpose of electing Donald Trump as US president, and in 2015 and 2016 combined, $1.2 million to Future 45, a Super PAC which funded anti-Bernie Sanders advertisements.

===Small Business Administration===
On December 7, 2016, President-elect Donald Trump announced that he would nominate McMahon to be the administrator of the Small Business Administration (SBA).

With her pending nomination to become administrator of the SBA, examination of McMahon&#x27;s record in preparation for her facing United States Senate confirmation began. In December &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; noted that &quot;[a]s part of her 2012 campaign, [the nominee&#x27;s] economic plan called for getting rid of &#x27;outdated/ineffective and duplicative programs&#x27;, and expressed support for a 2012 proposal by President Barack Obama to merge the SBA, the Commerce Department&#x27;s core functions and four other entities into one unit&quot;. The merger proposal, which did not proceed far toward approval at the time, would have eliminated the Cabinet-level post to which McMahon was nominated. The &quot;Connecticut Post&quot; examined issues of potential conflicts of interest from remaining WWE stock holdings and other financial assets, as well as of the relationship between WWE and smaller businesses in the wrestling world, with critics and supporters cited.

The Senate confirmation hearing began on January 24, 2017; her nomination was approved by the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship on February 1 with an 18–1 vote, and confirmed by the full Senate on February 14 by a vote of 81–19. She was officially sworn in as administrator of the SBA on the same day.

On June 17, 2017, in an interview with CNBC, McMahon stated in her role as administrator of SBA that she is &quot;[l]earning how to develop business plans, how to grow, how to pitch [one&#x27;s] business when [one is] trying to get investors, or to move into a different market and those are aspects of SBA that are not as well known&quot;, as the main goals of the SBA are capital, counseling, contracts and disaster relief. She also stated that the goals were being challenged, as the agency faced a five percent budget cut and future restructuring. &quot;What we have done is look inside SBA, and what I have found is there are some duplicative programs that we are going to be merging.&quot;

Later in 2017, she visited 68 cities to hear from small business owners and to support the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 backed by President Trump. On McMahon&#x27;s first anniversary as head of the SBA, on January 29, 2018, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the SBA&#x27;s progress under McMahon had been &quot;so far, so good&quot; and credited her with improving the SBA&#x27;s offices&#x27; emergency call centers in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, hiring an additional 3,000 people to work them, and revamping the administration&#x27;s online presence.

On March 29, 2019, McMahon announced her resignation as administrator of the SBA to chair America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC. The resignation took effect on April 12, 2019.

===Campaign finance and second Trump transition===
America First Action, a pro-Trump Super PAC chaired by McMahon, helped raise $83 million for Trump&#x27;s reelection campaign in 2020. McMahon also serves as chair of the board for the America First Policy Institute, along with Vice Chair Larry Kudlow, former director of the National Economic Council under Trump and Fox Business host. McMahon went on to join Howard Lutnick as co-chair of Trump&#x27;s second transition team.

====Secretary of Education nomination====
As part of her role in the transition team, Trump would nominate her to head the Department of Education within his second administration on November 19, 2024. Trump previously claimed the department had been infiltrated by &quot;radicals, zealots and Marxists&quot; during his campaign. Her nomination was criticized by professionals in the field of education, including by National Education Association president Rebecca S. Pringle, who cited Trump&#x27;s and her own position in support of eliminating the very department she&#x27;d be leading, as well as McMahon lacking strong qualifications more generally.

In late November 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; carried an article bearing the headline, &quot;Her Wrestling Empire Was Said to Harm Children. Trump Chose Her for Education&quot;, and the subheading, &quot;Linda McMahon, whose résumé mainly rests on running World Wrestling Entertainment, has faced questions for years over whether she is suitable for important education posts.&quot; In it Andrew Fleischmann, then-chairperson for the House Education Committee of Connecticut&#x27;s House of Representatives which dealt in 2009 with the proposed appointment of McMahon to the State Board of Education, was quoted as stating in 2024:She had no involvement whatsoever in education... She&#x27;s made tens or hundreds of millions of dollars pushing violence and sexualization of young women. She was a real force for doing ill to kids in our country.

Regarding her views on education, McMahon has expressed support for school choice and charter schools in the United States.

On January 20, 2025, the nomination was received in the U.S. Senate and referred to the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP). The nomination hearing is scheduled for February 13, 2025. On January 30, 2025, corporate filings stated McMahon had received 25,946 restricted shares of Trump Media (more than $800,000 when reported). McMahon is an independent director of the social media corporation&#x27;s board of directors. Approximately $200,000 (25% of the benefit) is accessible immediately, and the remainder of the restricted stock becoming available in a vesting schedule of installments from March 2025 through March 2027.

The committee advanced her nomination in a 12–11 vote on February 20.

==Philanthropy==
In 2012 McMahon donated $5 million to Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, which then opened a new student commons building and named it the Linda E. McMahon Student Commons. As of 2023, she had also sat for over 14 years on the Board of Trustees of the university.

Following McMahon&#x27;s contributions to its institution, in April 2023 Sacred Heart University acknowledged McMahon at its Pioneer Scholarship Gala, at which funds for scholarships were also raised.

Reflecting her respect for books and especially for bookmarks, it was reported on the internet site &quot;Education Week&quot;, &quot;[h]er interest in education did appear through her work at WWE. In 2000, she launched &#x27;GET REAL&#x27;, a campaign aimed at delivering positive messages about education and literacy to young adults through public service announcements, posters, and bookmarks featuring WWE stars.&quot;

<text>Noël Mamère (; born 25 December 1948) is a French journalist and former politician. He was the mayor of Bègles in Gironde from 1989 to 2017, as well as deputy to the French National Assembly for Gironde&#x27;s 3rd constituency from 1997 to 2017. He also served as a Member of the European Parliament from 1994 to 1997.

==Biography==
Noël Mamère rose to fame in the 1980s as a journalist and anchorman, in particular on Antenne 2.

In 1992, he became president of Brice Lalonde&#x27;s &quot;Ecology Generation&quot; party, from which he was expelled in 1994. He then founded &quot;Ecology-Solidarity Convergences&quot;, of which he was president, before joining &quot;Les Verts&quot; in 1998.

In 2002, he was a presidential candidate and garnered 5.25% of the votes.

On 5 June 2004, whilst mayor of Bègles, he stirred up controversy by conducting a marriage ceremony for a male homosexual couple, nine years before same-sex marriage became legal in France. The marriage was annulled by the courts on 27 July 2004. The couple appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, who ultimately upheld the annulment in 2016, but acknowledged that, by then, it was now legal for them to get married.

==Political career==
Member of European Parliament : 1994–1997 (Resignation, elected in the National Assembly of France). Elected in 1994.

Member of the National Assembly of France for Gironde : 1997–2017. Elected in 1997, reelected in 2002, 2007, 2012.

<doc id="679680" wikidata="Q1549382" url="?curid=679680" title="Asymptomatic carrier">
<text>An asymptomatic carrier is a person or other organism that has become infected with a pathogen, but shows no signs or symptoms.

Although unaffected by the pathogen, carriers can transmit it to others or develop symptoms in later stages of the disease. Asymptomatic carriers play a critical role in the transmission of common infectious diseases such as typhoid, HIV, &quot;C. difficile&quot;, influenzas, cholera, tuberculosis, and COVID-19, although the latter is often associated with &quot;robust T-cell immunity&quot; in more than a quarter of patients studied. While the mechanism of disease-carrying is still unknown, researchers have made progress towards understanding how certain pathogens can remain dormant in a human for a period of time. A better understanding of asymptomatic disease carriers is crucial to the fields of medicine and public health as they work towards mitigating the spread of common infectious diseases.

== Types of asymptomatic carriers ==
Asymptomatic carriers can be categorized by their current disease state. When an individual transmits pathogens immediately following infection but prior to developing symptoms, they are known as an incubatory carrier. Humans are also capable of spreading disease following a period of illness. Typically thinking themselves cured of the disease, these individuals are known as convalescent carriers. Viral diseases such as hepatitis and poliomyelitis are frequently transmitted in this manner. &quot;Healthy carriers&quot; never exhibit signs or symptoms of the disease, yet are capable of infecting others, and are often considered to be the &quot;classic&quot; asymptomatic carriers.
While the mechanism of disease carrying is still unknown, researchers have made progress towards understanding how certain pathogens can remain dormant in a human for a period of time.

== Significance in disease transmission ==
The limited information on the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers creates a considerable difficulty when planning public health initiatives. Given that disease surveillance is dependent on estimates for both the asymptomatic rates and symptomatic rates of disease, the lack of information on the prevalence of carriers can lead to insufficient initiatives for the mitigation of common public health concerns such as &quot;C. difficile&quot; or influenza.

Researchers have expressed the desire to better predict transmission methods in order to determine the appropriate public health response. For example, a disease with a known low asymptomatic rate may lead to increased surveillance of symptomatic cases, whereas a higher asymptomatic rate could lead to more aggressive methods such as travel bans and compulsory quarantines, since the number of infectious, asymptomatic cases would be unknown.

== Possible explanations ==
While an exact explanation for asymptomatic carriage is unknown, researchers have been dedicating their efforts towards understanding how specific bacteria thrive in human hosts in the hopes of determining a universal understanding of asymptomatic transmission.

=== A biological mechanism utilizing &quot;Salmonella&quot; ===
Numerous research publications have demonstrated how salmonella is able to remain in immune cells and alter their metabolic systems in order to further transmit the disease. Utilizing a closely related strand of bacterium (&quot;S. typhimurium&quot;), scientists have been able to create a mouse model that mimics the persistent salmonella cases seen in carriers of typhoid. Knowing that the bacterium can reside in mice for their entire lives, researchers have been able to determine that the bacterium tends to reside in macrophages. Further examination of the gut lymph nodes of the mice reveals that &quot;S. typhimurium&quot; changes the inflammatory response of the macrophages. Instead of eliciting an inflammatory response from the attack cells, the bacterium is able to convert them into an anti-inflammatory macrophage, allowing for optimal survival conditions. In the words of lead scientist Denise Monack, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that inflammatory macrophages were invulnerable to infection, but rather that, having infected a macrophage, &quot;S. typhimurium&quot; was much more able to replicate in the anti-inflammatory type&quot;.

Investigators have also found that the presence of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) correlated to the presence of salmonella bacterium. PPARs, thought of as roaming genetic switches, are responsible for the fat metabolism needed to sustain anti-inflammatory macrophages in which &quot;S. typhimurium&quot; hides.

== Asymptomatic bacteriuria ==

Asymptomatic bacteriuria is a condition that typically impacts 3–5% of women, with the most vulnerable populations being the elderly and those diagnosed with diabetes. Within the female population, the risk of bacteriuria increases with age. &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; is the most common organism found during urine analysis, though the variety of potentially infectious organisms is diverse and can include Enterobacteriaceae, &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, Enterococcus species, and group B streptococcus. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality has issued a set of screening recommendations as well as offered some insight into the mechanism of bacteriuria. Results of the meta-analysis produced no clear explanation for asymptomatic carriage, but did yield new evidence that strengthened the support for screening for asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnant women only.

== Infectious diseases ==
Asymptomatic carriers have furthered the spread of many infectious diseases. A common principle in epidemiology, the 80–20 rule, speculates that 80% of the disease transmission is conducted by only 20% of people in a population.

=== Typhoid fever ===
Typhoid fever is an ailment caused by the bacterium &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; ser. Typhi. An individual can acquire this infection from consuming risky foods or drinks, or by consuming foods or drinks prepared by an infected individual. Those who recover from this infection can still carry the bacteria in their cells, and therefore be asymptomatic.

==== Typhoid Mary ====

Mary Mallon, known as &quot;Typhoid Mary&quot;, was an asymptomatic carrier of &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; serovar typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever. She was a cook for several families and soldiers in New York City during the late 1800s, and several cases of typhoid fever were traced to her by the Health Department. At the time, there was no way of eradicating the disease, and it was spread primarily through fecal-oral transmission. Most of Mary Mallon&#x27;s transmission risk was thought to arise from her continued involvement in occupations involving food preparation and handling. New York City&#x27;s public health officials initially sought to merely restrict her from such employment rather than permanently quarantining her. When she continued to be non-compliant, the Health Commission ordered that she be quarantined on one of the islands surrounding Manhattan. She remained there until her death.

Despite appearing perfectly healthy, it is estimated that Mallon infected about 50 people before she was quarantined on North Brother Island. Scientists calculate that between 1% and 6% of individuals infected with &quot;Salmonella typhi&quot; become chronic, asymptomatic carriers like Mary.

===HIV===

HIV infection has a long period during which the person is asymptomatic. Although the host may not be experiencing symptoms, the virus can still be passed on to others. It is also possible for the infection to become symptomatic after this incubation period. Whether the host is showing symptoms or not, opportunistic infections can take advantage of the weakened immune system and cause further complications.

===Epstein–Barr virus===
Many carriers are infected with persistent viruses such as Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), a member of the herpes virus family. Studies show that about 95% of adults have antibodies against EBV, which means they were infected with the virus at some point in their life.

===&quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot;===
&quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; has also been shown to be spread by asymptomatic carriers, and poses significant problems in home-care settings. Reports indicating that over 50% of long-term patients present with fecal contamination despite a lack of symptoms have led many hospitals to extend the period of contact precautions until discharge.

===Cholera===
For cholera the estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100.

===Chlamydia===
Chlamydia, an STI that affects both men and women, can also be asymptomatic in most individuals. Although the infection may not yield any obvious symptoms, it can still damage the reproductive system. If the infection goes unnoticed for a long time, infected individuals are at risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Like chlamydia, PID can also be asymptomatic.

===Poliomyelitis===
A small number of asymptomatic carriers of polio (referred to as &quot;chronic excretors&quot;) continue to produce active virus for years (or even decades) after their initial exposure to the oral Sabin vaccine. Carriers of the attenuated virus unintentionally spread the attenuated virus, inoculating others, giving them contact immunity; however some adults with weak immune systems have contracted paralytic polio from contact with recently immunized children. Carriers of virulent strains spread polio, increasing the difficulty of poliomyelitis eradication.

=== Tuberculosis ===
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease usually caused by the bacterium &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Active or symptomatic tuberculosis is spread from person to person through the air through bacterium spores that are released into the air following a cough or sneeze. Some individuals may be infected with the tuberculosis mycobacterium but never display symptoms. Called latent tuberculosis, these cases, while uncontagious, are particularly problematic from a public health perspective, since approximately 10% of those diagnosed with latent TB will go on to develop an active (and contagious) case.

=== COVID-19 ===
A 2021 paper estimated that at least 50% of SARS-CoV-2 infections were a result of exposure to asymptomatic carriers.

<text>The Akimel O&#x27;odham (O&#x27;odham for &quot;river people&quot;), also called the Pima, are an Indigenous people of the Americas living in the United States in central and southern Arizona and northwestern Mexico in the states of Sonora and Chihuahua. The majority population of the two current bands of the Akimel O&#x27;odham in the United States is based in two reservations: the Keli Akimel Oʼodham on the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) and the On&#x27;k Akimel O&#x27;odham on the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC).

The Akimel O&#x27;odham are closely related to the Ak-Chin O&#x27;odham, now forming the Ak-Chin Indian Community. They are also related to the Sobaipuri, whose descendants reside on the San Xavier Indian Reservation or Wa꞉k (together with the Tohono O&#x27;odham), and in the Salt River Indian Community. Together with the related Tohono O&#x27;odham (&quot;Desert People&quot;) and the Hia C-ed O&#x27;odham (&quot;Sand Dune People&quot;), the Akimel O&#x27;odham form the Upper O&#x27;odham.

== Name ==
The short name, &quot;Pima&quot;, is believed to have come from the phrase &quot;pi &#x27;añi mac&quot; or &quot;pi mac,&quot; meaning &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; which they used repeatedly in their initial meetings with Spanish colonists. The Spanish referred to them as the Pima. English-speaking traders, explorers, and settlers adopted this term.

The Akimel O&#x27;odham called themselves &quot;Othama&quot; until the first account of interaction with non-Native Americans was recorded.

==History prior to 1688==

Spanish missionaries recorded Pima villages known as Kina, Equituni, and Uturituc. European Americans later corrupted the miscommunication into Pimos, which was adapted to Pima river people. The Akimel Oʼodham people today call their villages:

* District #1 – U&#x27;s kehk (Blackwater)
* District #2 – Hashan Kehk (Saguaro Stand)
* District #3 – Gu꞉U Ki (Sacaton)
* District #4 – Santan
* District #5 – Vah Ki (Casa Blanca)
* District #6 – Komatke (Sierra Estrella Mountains)
* District #7 – Maricopa Colony

The territory of the Upper O&#x27;odham, also called Upper Pima or Pima Alto, was called Pimería Alta by the Spanish.

The Akimel O&#x27;odham had lived along the Gila, Salt, Yaqui, and Sonora rivers in ranchería-style villages. The villages were set up as a loose group of houses with familial groups sharing a central ramada and kitchen area. Brush &quot;Olas Ki:ki&quot; (round houses) were built around this central area. The Oʼodham are matrilocal, with daughters and their husbands living with and near the daughter&#x27;s mother. Familial groups tended to consist of extended families. The Akimel Oʼodham also lived seasonally in temporary field houses in order to tend their crops.

The O&#x27;odham language, variously called &quot;O&#x27;odham ñeʼokĭ&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;odham ñiʼokĭ&quot; or &quot;Oʼotham ñiok,&quot; is spoken by all O&#x27;odham groups. There are certain dialectal differences, but they are mutually intelligible and all O&#x27;odham groups can understand one another. Lexicographical differences have arisen among the different groups, especially in reference to newer technologies and innovations.

The ancient economy of the Akimel O&#x27;odham was primarily subsistence, based on farming, hunting and gathering. They also conducted extensive trading. The prehistoric peoples built an extensive irrigation system to compensate for arid conditions. It remains in use today. Over time the communities built and altered canal systems according to their changing needs.

The Akimel Oʼodham were experts in the area of textiles and produced intricate baskets as well as woven cloth. Prior to the arrival of Europeans, their primary military rivals were the Apache and Yavapai, who raided their villages at times due to competition for resources. The latter tribes were more nomadic, depending primarily on hunting and gathering, and would raid the more settled groups who cultivated foods. They established some friendly relations with the Apache.

==History after 1694==
Initially, the Akimel O&#x27;odham experienced little intensive colonial contact. Early encounters were limited to parties traveling through the territory or community members visiting settlements to the south. The Hispanic era (AD 1694–1853) of the Historic period began with the first visit by Father Kino to their villages in 1694. The Pima Revolt, also known as the O&#x27;odham Uprising or the Pima Outbreak, was a revolt of Akimel O&#x27;odham people in 1751 against colonial forces in Spanish Arizona and one of the major northern frontier conflicts in early New Spain.

Contact was infrequent with the Mexicans during their rule of southern Arizona between 1821 and 1853. The Akimel Oʼodham were affected by introduced European elements, such as infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, new crops (such as wheat), livestock, and use of metal tools and trade goods.

Euroamerican contacts with the Akimel Oʼodham in the middle Gila Valley increased after 1846 as a result of the Mexican–American War. The Akimel Oʼodham traded and gave aid to the expeditions of Stephen Watts Kearny and Philip St. George Cooke on their way to California. After Mexico&#x27;s defeat, it ceded the territory of what is now Arizona to the United States, with the exception of the land south of the Gila River. Soon thereafter the California Gold Rush began, drawing Americans to travel to California through the Mexican territory between Mesilla and the Colorado River crossings near Yuma, on what became known as the Southern Emigrant Trail. Travelers used the villages of the Akimel Oʼodham as oases to recover from the crossing of unfamiliar deserts. They also bought new supplies and livestock to support the journey across the remaining deserts to the west.

The American era (A.D. 1853–1950), began in 1853 with the Gadsden Purchase, when the US acquired southern Arizona. New markets were developed, initially to supply immigrants heading for California. Grain was needed for horses of the Butterfield Overland Mail and for the military during the American Civil War. As a result, the Akimel Oʼodham experienced a period of prosperity. The Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) was established in 1859. The 1860 census records the Akimel O&#x27;odham villages as Agua Raiz, Arenal, Casa Blanca, Cachanillo, Cerrito, Cerro Chiquito, El Llano, and Hormiguero.

After the American Civil War, numerous Euroamerican migrants came to settle upstream locations along the Gila, as well as along the lower Salt River. Due to their encroachment and competition for scarce resources, interaction between Native American groups and the Euro-American settlers became increasingly tense. The U.S. government adopted a policy of pacification and confinement of Native Americans to reservations. Uncertainty and variable crop yields led to major settlement reorganizations. The establishment of agency headquarters, churches and schools, and trading posts at Vahki (Casa Blanca) and Gu U ki (Sacaton) during the 1870s and 1880s led to the growth of these towns as administrative and commercial centers, at the expense of others.

By 1898 agriculture had nearly ceased within the GRIC. Although some Akimel Oʼodham drew rations, their principal means of livelihood was woodcutting. The first allotments of land within Gila River were established in 1914, in an attempt to break up communal land. Each individual was assigned a parcel of irrigable land located within districts irrigated by the Santan, Agency, Blackwater, and Casa Blanca projects on the eastern half of the reservation. In 1917, the allotment size was doubled to include a primary lot of irrigable land and a secondary, usually non-contiguous tract of grazing land.

The most ambitious effort to rectify the economic plight of the Akimel Oʼodham was the San Carlos Project Act of 1924, which authorized the construction of a water storage dam on the Gila River. It provided for the irrigation of of Indian and of non-Indian land. For a variety of reasons, the San Carlos Project failed to revitalize the Oʼodham farming economy. In effect the project halted the Gila river waters, and the Akimel O&#x27;odham no longer had a source of water for farming. This began the famine years. Many Oʼodham have believed these wrong and misguided government policies were an attempt of mass genocide.

Over the decades, the U.S. government promoted assimilation, forcing changes on to the Akimel Oʼodham in nearly every aspect of their lives. Since World War II, however, the Akimel Oʼodham have experienced a resurgence of interest in tribal sovereignty and economic development. The community has regained its self-government and are recognized as a tribe. In addition, they have developed several profitable enterprises in fields such as agriculture and telecommunications, and built several gaming casinos to generate revenues. They have begun to construct a water delivery system across the reservation in order to revive their farming economy.

==Akimel O&#x27;odham and the Salt River==
The Akimel O&#x27;odham (&quot;River People&quot;) have lived on the banks of the Gila and Salt Rivers since long before European contact.

Their way of life (&quot;himdagĭ&quot;, sometimes rendered in English as &quot;Him-dag&quot;) was and is centered on the river, which is holy. The term Him-dag should be clarified, as it does not have a direct translation into the English language, and is not limited to reverence of the river. It encompasses a great deal because O&#x27;odham him-dag intertwines religion, morals, values, philosophy, and general world view which are all interconnected. Their worldview and religious beliefs focus on the natural world.

The Gila and Salt Rivers are currently dry, due to the (San Carlos Irrigation project) upstream dams that block the flow and the diversion of water by non-native farmers. This has been a cause of great upset among all of the Oʼodham. The upstream diversion in combination with periods of drought, led to lengthy periods of famine that were a devastating change from the documented prosperity the people had experienced until non-native settlers engaged in more aggressive farming in areas that were traditionally used by the Akimel Oʼodham and Apache in Eastern Arizona. This abuse of water rights was the impetus for a nearly century long legal battle between the Gila River Indian Community and the United States government, which was settled in favor of the Akimel Oʼodham and signed into law by George W. Bush in December 2005. As a side note, at times during the monsoon season the Salt River runs, albeit at low levels. In the weeks after December 29, 2004, when an unexpected winter rainstorm flooded areas much further upstream (in Northern Arizona), water was released through dams on the river at rates higher than at any time since the filling of Tempe Town Lake in 1998, and was a cause for minor celebration in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community. The diversion of the water and the introduction of non-native diet is said to have been the leading contributing factor in the high rate of diabetes among the Akimel Oʼodham tribe.

==Modern life==
As of 2014, the majority of the population lives in the federally recognized Gila River Indian Community (GRIC). In historic times a large number of Akimel O&#x27;odham migrated north to occupy the banks of the Salt River, where they formed the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC). Both tribes are confederations of two distinct ethnicities, which include the Maricopa.

Within the O&#x27;odham people, four federally recognized tribes in the Southwest speak the same language: they are called the Gila River Indian Community (&quot;Keli Akimel O&#x27;odham&quot; – &quot;Gila River People&quot;); the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (&quot;Onk Akimel O&#x27;odham&quot; – &quot;Salt River People&quot;); the Ak-Chin Indian Community (&quot;Ak-Chin O&#x27;odham&quot;); and the Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation (&quot;Tohono O&#x27;odham&quot; – &quot;Desert People&quot;). The remaining band, the Hia C-ed O&#x27;odham (&quot;Sand Dune People&quot;), are not federally recognized, but reside throughout southwestern Arizona.

Today the GRIC is a sovereign tribe residing on more than of land in central Arizona. The community is divided into seven districts (similar to states) with a council representing individual subgovernments. It is self-governed by an elected Governor (currently Gregory Mendoza), Lieutenant Governor (currently Stephen Roe-Lewis) and 18-member Tribal Council. The council is elected by district with the number of electees determined by district population. There are more than 19,000 enrolled members overall.

The Gila River Indian Community is involved in various economic development enterprises that provide entertainment and recreation: three gaming casinos, associated golf courses, a luxury resort, and a western-themed amusement park. In addition, they manage various industrial parks, landfills, and construction supply. The GRIC is also involved in agriculture and runs its own farms and other agricultural projects. The Gila River Indian Reservation is home of Maricopa (&quot;Piipaa, Piipaash&quot; or &quot;Pee-Posh&quot; – &quot;People&quot;) and &quot;Keli Akimel O&#x27;odham&quot; (also &quot;Keli Akimel Au-Authm&quot; – &quot;Gila River People&quot;, a division of the Akimel O&#x27;odham – &quot;River People&quot;).

The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is smaller in size. It also has a government of an elected President and tribal council. They operate tribal gaming, industrial projects, landfills and construction supply. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC) is home of the &quot;Onk Akimel O&#x27;odham&quot; (also &quot;On&#x27;k Akimel Au-Authm&quot; – &quot;Salt River People&quot;, a division of the Akimel O&#x27;odham – &quot;River People&quot;), the &quot;Maricopa of Lehi&quot; (call themselves &quot;Xalychidom Piipaa or Xalychidom Piipaash&quot; – &quot;People who live toward the water&quot;, descendants of the refugee Halchidhoma), the Tohono O&#x27;odham (&quot;Desert People&quot;) and some &quot;Keli Akimel O&#x27;odham&quot; (also &quot;Keli Akimel Au-Authm&quot; – &quot;Gila River People&quot;, another division of the Akimel O&#x27;odham – &quot;River People&quot;).

The Ak-Chin Indian Community is located in the Santa Cruz Valley in Arizona. The community is composed mainly of Ak-Chin O&#x27;odham (&quot;Ak-Chin Au-Authm&quot;, also called &quot;Pima&quot;, another division of the Akimel O&#x27;odham – &quot;River People&quot;) and Tohono O&#x27;odham, as well as some Yoeme. As of 2000, the population living in the community was 742. Ak-Chin is an O&#x27;odham word that means the &quot;mouth of the arroyo&quot; or &quot;place where the wash loses itself in the sand or ground.&quot;

The Keli Akimel O&#x27;odham and the Onk Akimel O&#x27;odham have various environmentally based health issues related to the decline of their traditional economy and farming. They have the highest prevalence of type 2 diabetes in the world, much more than is observed in other U.S. populations. While they do not have a greater risk than other tribes, the Akimel O&#x27;odham people have been the subject of intensive study of diabetes, in part because they form a homogeneous group.

The general increased diabetes prevalence among Native Americans has been hypothesized as the result of the interaction of genetic predisposition (the thrifty phenotype or thrifty genotype), as suggested by anthropologist Robert Ferrell in 1984 and a sudden shift in diet during the last century from traditional agricultural crops to processed foods, together with a decline in physical activity. For comparison, genetically similar O&#x27;odham in Mexico have only a slighter higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes than non-O&#x27;odham Mexicans.

== Customs ==
Personal names are particularly important in Akimel O&#x27;odham society. From age ten until the time of marriage, neither boys nor girls were allowed to speak their own names out loud. Doing so can invoke bad luck to the children and their future. Similarly, people in the tribe do not say aloud the names of deceased people, in order to allow them to move on and to call their spirits back among the living.

The people gave their children careful verbal instruction in moral, religious, and other matters. Akimel O&#x27;odham ceremonies often included set speeches, in which the speaker would recite portions of their cosmic myth. Such a recounting was especially important in the preparation for war. These speeches were adapted for each occasion but the general context was the same.

Traditionally, the Akimel O&#x27;odham lived in a thatched wattle-and-daub houses, as seen by the early European-American settlers who ventured into their country:

<text>Peter Soyer Beagle (born April 20, 1939) is an American novelist and screenwriter, especially of fantasy fiction. His best-known work is &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; (1968) which &quot;Locus&quot; subscribers voted the number five &quot;All-Time Best Fantasy Novel&quot; in 1987. During the last twenty-five years he has won several literary awards, including a World Fantasy Award for Life Achievement in 2011. He was named Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master by SFWA in 2018.

==Early life==
Beagle was born in Manhattan on April 20, 1939, the son of Simon Beagle and Rebecca Soyer. Three of his uncles were noted painters: Moses, Raphael, and Isaac Soyer.

Beagle has said that &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;, a classic of children&#x27;s literature by Kenneth Grahame, originally attracted him to the genre of fantasy.

==Career==

Beagle was raised in Bronx, New York, and graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1955. He garnered early recognition from The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards, winning a scholarship to University of Pittsburgh for a poem he submitted as a high school senior. He went on to graduate from the university with a degree in creative writing. Following a year overseas, Beagle held the graduate Stegner Fellowship in creative writing at Stanford University, where he overlapped with Ken Kesey, Gurney Norman, and Larry McMurtry.

Beagle wrote his first novel, &quot;A Fine and Private Place&quot;, when he was 19 years old, following it with a memoir, &quot;I See by My Outfit&quot;, in 1965. 

He wrote an introduction for an American print edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He and Chris Conkling co-wrote the screenplay for the 1978 Ralph Bakshi-animated version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Two decades later he wrote the teleplay for &quot;Sarek&quot;, episode 71 of the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.

With David Carlson as composer Beagle adapted his story &quot;Come, Lady Death&quot; into the libretto for an opera, &quot;The Midnight Angel&quot;, which premiered at the Opera Theatre of Saint Louis in 1993.

In 2005, Beagle published a coda to &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;, a novelette entitled &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, and began work on a full-novel sequel. &quot;Two Hearts&quot; won the Hugo Award for Best Novelette in 2006 and the parallel Nebula Award in 2007. It was also nominated as a short fiction finalist for the World Fantasy Award. Beagle also received a special Inkpot Award in 2006 for Outstanding Achievement in Science Fiction and Fantasy, and in 2007 the inaugural WSFA Small Press Award for &quot;El Regalo&quot;, published in &quot;The Line Between&quot; (Tachyon Publications). 

He is also a winner of the Jack Trevor Story Cup, also known as the Prix du Goncourt, awarded to an outstanding humorous writer.

IDW Publishing released a six-issue comic book adaptation of &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; beginning in April 2010. The collected hardcover edition was released in January 2011, premiering at #2 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Hardcover Graphic Novel bestseller list.

Beagle&#x27;s 2009 collection of short fiction, &quot;We Never Talk About My Brother&quot;, was nominated for a World Fantasy Award.

In 2013, he collaborated with the musician Phildel on a new track &quot;Dark Water Down&quot;, mixing poetry and music. They then appeared together at a gig at Cafe Du Nord in San Francisco.

===Dispute with Granada media===
Beagle&#x27;s book &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; was made into an animated film of the same name in 1982, based on a screenplay written by Beagle himself. In 1979, Beagle had a contract with ITC Entertainment, which entitled Beagle to 5% of the net profits in the animated property, and 5% of the gross revenues from any film-related merchandising. Since 1999 this film has been controlled by a British company, Granada Media International (a subsidiary of ITV plc). 

From 2003 through 2011, Beagle was involved in a financial dispute with Granada over nonpayment of contractually due profit and merchandising shares. On July 29, 2011, Beagle announced at his Otakon appearance that he and ITV had reached an agreement that was beneficial to all parties, and should please fans of &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot;. On October 14, 2011, at his New York Comic Con appearance, he announced the first results of the deal.

===Dispute with Connor Cochran===
Beagle sued his former manager Connor Cochran in 2015 for $52 million. The Alameda County Superior Court judge Michael M. Markman found Cochran liable for financial elder abuse, fraud, and breach of fiduciary duty, awarding Beagle $325,000, as well as an additional $7500 for defamation, and an undetermined amount in attorney&#x27;s fees.

Cochran declared bankruptcy sixteen hours before the trial was due to begin. Beagle was unable to collect the money Cochran owed, and the rights to Beagle&#x27;s work were left in legal limbo. In February 2021, Beagle regained the intellectual property rights.
