<text>Juno ( ; Latin ) was an ancient Roman goddess, the protector and special counsellor of the state. She was equated to Hera, queen of the gods in Greek mythology and a goddess of love and marriage. A daughter of Saturn and Ops, she was the sister and wife of Jupiter and the mother of Mars, Vulcan, Bellona, Lucina and Juventas. Like Hera, her sacred animal was the peacock. Her Etruscan counterpart was Uni, and she was said to also watch over the women of Rome. As the patron goddess of Rome and the Roman Empire, Juno was called (&quot;Queen&quot;) and was a member of the Capitoline Triad (&quot;Juno Capitolina&quot;), centered on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, and also including Jupiter, and Minerva, goddess of wisdom.
Juno&#x27;s own warlike aspect among the Romans is apparent in her attire. She was often shown armed and wearing a goatskin cloak. The traditional depiction of this warlike aspect was assimilated from the Greek goddess Athena, who bore a goatskin, or a goatskin shield, called the Aegis. Juno was also shown wearing a diadem.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Juno&quot; was once popularly thought to be connected to &quot;Iove&quot; (Jove), originally as &quot;Diuno&quot; and &quot;Diove&quot; from &quot;*Diovona&quot;. Although this etymology still receives some support, a derivation was later proposed from &quot;iuven-&quot; (as in Latin &quot;iuvenis&quot;, &quot;youth&quot;), through a syncopated form &quot;iūn-&quot; (as in &quot;iūnix&quot;, &quot;heifer&quot;, and &quot;iūnior&quot;, &quot;younger&quot;). This etymology became widely accepted after it was endorsed by Georg Wissowa.

&quot;Iuuen-&quot; is related to Latin &quot;aevum&quot; and Greek &quot;aion&quot; (αἰών) through a common Indo-European root referring to a concept of vital energy or &quot;fertile time&quot;. The &quot;iuvenis&quot; is he who has the fullness of vital force. In some inscriptions Jupiter himself is called &quot;Iuuntus&quot;, and one of the epithets of Jupiter is &quot;Ioviste&quot;, a superlative form of &quot;iuuen-&quot; meaning &quot;the youngest&quot;. Iuventas, &quot;Youth&quot;, was one of two deities who &quot;refused&quot; to leave the Capitol when the building of the new Temple of Capitoline Jove required the exauguration of deities who already occupied the site. 

Ancient etymologies associated Juno&#x27;s name with &quot;iuvare&quot;, &quot;to aid, benefit&quot;, and &quot;iuvenescere&quot;, &quot;rejuvenate&quot;, sometimes connecting it to the renewal of the new and waxing moon, perhaps implying the idea of a moon goddess.
==Roles and epithets==

Juno&#x27;s theology is one of the most complex and disputed issues in Roman religion. Even more than other major Roman deities, Juno held a large number of significant and diverse epithets, names and titles representing various aspects and roles of the goddess. In accordance with her central role as a goddess of marriage, these included &quot;Pronuba&quot; and &quot;Cinxia&quot; (&quot;she who looses the bride&#x27;s girdle&quot;). However, other epithets of Juno have wider implications and are less thematically linked.

While her connection with the idea of vital force, the fullness of vital energy, and eternal youthfulness is now generally acknowledged, the multiplicity and complexity of her personality have given rise to various and sometimes irreconcilable interpretations among modern scholars.

Juno is certainly the divine protectress of the community, who shows both a sovereign and a fertility character, often associated with a military one. She was present in many towns of ancient Italy: at Lanuvium as Sespeis Mater Regina, Laurentum, Tibur, Falerii, Veii as Regina, at Tibur and Falerii as Regina and Curitis, Tusculum and Norba as Lucina. She is also attested at Praeneste, Aricia, Ardea, Gabii. In five Latin towns a month was named after Juno (Aricia, Lanuvium, Laurentum, Praeneste, Tibur). Outside Latium in Campania at Teanum she was Populona (she who increase the number of the people or, in K. Latte&#x27;s understanding of the &quot;iuvenes&quot;, the army), in Umbria at Pisaurum Lucina, at Terventum in Samnium Regina, at Pisarum Regina Matrona, at Aesernia in Samnium Regina Populona. In Rome she was since the most ancient times named Lucina, Mater and Regina. It is debated whether she was also known as Curitis before the evocatio of the Juno of Falerii: this though seems probable.

Other epithets of hers that were in use at Rome include Moneta and Caprotina, Tutula, Fluonia or Fluviona, Februalis, the last ones associated with the rites of purification and fertility of February.

Her various epithets thus show a complex of mutually interrelated functions that in the view of Georges Dumézil and Vsevolod Basanoff (author of &quot;Les dieux Romains&quot;) can be traced back to the Indoeuropean trifunctional ideology: as Regina and Moneta she is a sovereign deity, as Sespeis, Curitis (spear holder) and Moneta (again) she is an armed protectress, as Mater and Curitis (again) she is a goddess of the fertility and wealth of the community in her association with the curiae.

The epithet &quot;Lucina&quot; is particularly revealing since it reflects two interrelated aspects of the function of Juno: cyclical renewal of time in the waning and waxing of the moon and protection of delivery and birth (as she who brings to light the newborn as vigour, vital force). The ancient called her &quot;Covella&quot; in her function of helper in the &quot;labours&quot; of the new moon. The view that she was also a Moon goddess though is no longer accepted by scholars, as such a role belongs to Diana &quot;Lucifera&quot;: through her association with the moon she governed the feminine physiological functions, menstrual cycle and pregnancy: as a rule all lunar deities are deities of childbirth. These aspects of Juno mark the heavenly and worldly sides of her function. She is thus associated to all beginnings and hers are the kalendae of every month: at Laurentum she was known as &quot;Kalendaris Iuno&quot; (Juno of the Kalends). At Rome on the Kalends of every month the &quot;pontifex minor&quot; invoked her, under the epithet &quot;Covella&quot;, when from the &quot;curia Calabra&quot; he announced the date of the &quot;nonae&quot;. On the same day the &quot;regina sacrorum&quot; sacrificed to Juno a white sow or lamb in the Regia. She is closely associated with Janus, the god of passages and beginnings who after her is often named &quot;Iunonius&quot;.

Some scholars view this concentration of multiple functions as a typical and structural feature of the goddess, inherent to her being an expression of the nature of femininity. Others though prefer to dismiss her aspects of femininity and fertility and stress only her quality of being the spirit of youthfulness, liveliness and strength, regardless of sexual connexions, which would then change according to circumstances: thus in men she incarnates the &quot;iuvenes&quot;, a word often used to designate soldiers, hence resulting in a tutelary deity of the sovereignty of peoples; in women capable of bearing children, from puberty on she oversees childbirth and marriage. Thence she would be a &quot;poliad&quot; goddess related to politics, power and war. Others think her military and poliadic qualities arise from her being a fertility goddess who through her function of increasing the numbers of the community became also associated to political and military functions.
===Juno Sospita and Lucina===

The rites of the month of February and the &quot;Nonae Caprotinae&quot; of July 5 offer a depiction of Juno&#x27;s roles in the spheres of fertility, war, and regality.

In the Roman calendar, February is a month of universal purification, and begins the new year. In book II of his &quot;Fasti&quot;, Ovid derives the month&#x27;s name from &quot;februae&quot; (expiations); lustrations designed to remove spiritual contamination or ritual pollution accumulated in the previous year. On the 1st of the month, a black ox was sacrificed to Helernus, a minor underworld deity whom Dumézil takes as a god of vegetation related to the cult of Carna/Crane, a nymph who may be an image of Juno Sospita. On the same day, Juno&#x27;s &quot;dies natalis&quot; (&quot;birthday&quot;) as Juno Sospita was celebrated at her Palatine temple. On February 15 the Lupercalia festival was held, in which Juno was involved as &quot;Juno Lucina&quot;. This is usually understood to be a rite of purification and fertility. A goat was sacrificed and its hide cut into strips, used to make whips known as and , wielded by the Luperci. The Juno of this day bears the epithet of &quot;Februalis&quot;, &quot;Februata&quot;, &quot;Februa&quot;. On the last day of the month, leading into March 1, she was celebrated as protectress of matrons and marriages. The new year began on March 1. The same was celebrated as the birthday of Rome&#x27;s founder and first king, Romulus, and the peaceful union of Romans and Sabine peoples through treaty and marriage after their war, which was ended by the intervention of women.

After Wissowa many scholars have remarked the similarity between the Juno of the Lupercalia and the Juno of Lanuvium &quot;Seispes Mater Regina&quot; as both are associated with the goat, symbol of fertility. But in essence there is unity between fertility, regality and purification. This unity is underlined by the role of Faunus in the aetiologic story told by Ovid and the symbolic relevance of the Lupercal: asked by the Roman couples at her &quot;lucus&quot; how to overcome the sterility that ensued the abduction of the Sabine women, Juno answered through a murmuring of leaves &quot;Italidas matres sacer hircus inito&quot; &quot;That a sacred ram cover the Italic mothers&quot;.

&quot;Februlis&quot; oversees the secundament of the placenta and is strictly associated to &quot;Fluvonia, Fluonia&quot;, goddess who retains the blood inside the body during pregnancy. While the protection of pregnancy is stressed by Duval, Palmer sees in Fluonia only the Juno of lustration in river water. Ovid devotes an &quot;excursus&quot; to the lustrative function of river water in the same place in which he explains the etymology of February.

A temple () of Juno Lucina was built in 375 BC in the grove sacred to the goddess from early times. It stood precisely on the Cispius near the sixth shrine of the Argei. probably not far west of the church of S. Prassede, where inscriptions relating to her cult have been found. The grove should have extended down the slope south of the temple. As Servius Tullius ordered the gifts for the newborn to be placed in the treasury of the temple though it looks that another shrine stood there before 375 BC. In 190 BC the temple was struck by lightning, its gable and doors injured. The annual festival of the Matronalia was celebrated here on March 1, day of the dedication of the temple.

One temple of Juno Sospita was located near the Temple of Cybele northwest of the Palatine Hill within the Pomerium. This was located near or under the site of the 6th century church of San Teodoro, which has an unusual circular shape similar to that of the nymphaeum later misnamed the Temple of Minerva Medica. In his early 1st-century poem , Ovid states that by his time this temple had become so dilapidated that it was no longer discernible &quot;because of the injuries of time&quot;. A later Temple of Juno Sospita was vowed by the consul G. Cornelius Cethegus in and consecrated and opened in This temple was located at the Roman vegetable market () beside Temples of Hope and Piety and near the Carmental Gate. It was apparently this temple that was later reported as having fallen into disrepute by , when it was stained by episodes of prostitution and a bitch delivered her puppies beneath the temple&#x27;s statue of the goddess. The consul L. Julius Caesar secured its restoration with a Senatorial decree and relics from the temple remain today.

===Juno Caprotina===
The alliance of the three aspects of Juno finds a strictly related parallel to the Lupercalia in the festival of the &quot;Nonae Caprotinae&quot;. On that day the Roman free and slave women picnicked and had fun together near the site of the wild fig (&quot;caprificus&quot;): the custom implied runs, mock battles with fists and stones, obscene language and finally the sacrifice of a male goat to Juno &quot;Caprotina&quot; under a wildfig tree and with the using of its lymph.

This festival had a legendary aetiology in a particularly delicate episode of Roman history and also recurs at (or shortly after) a particular time of the year, that of the so-called &quot;caprificatio&quot; when branches of wild fig trees were fastened to cultivated ones to promote insemination. The historical episode narrated by ancient sources concerns the siege of Rome by the Latin peoples that followed the Gallic sack. The dictator of the Latins Livius Postumius from Fidenae would have requested the Roman senate that the &quot;matronae&quot; and daughters of the most prominent families be surrendered to the Latins as hostages. While the senate was debating the issue a slave girl, whose Greek name was Philotis and Latin Tutela or Tutula proposed that she together with other slave girls would render herself up to the enemy camp pretending to be the wives and daughters of the Roman families. Upon agreement of the senate, the women dressed up elegantly and wearing golden jewellery reached the Latin camp. There they seduced the Latins into fooling and drinking: after they had fallen asleep, they stole their swords. Then Tutela gave the convened signal to the Romans brandishing an ignited branch after climbing on the wild fig (&quot;caprificus&quot;) and hiding the fire with her mantle. The Romans then irrupted into the Latin camp killing the enemies in their sleep. The women were rewarded with freedom and a dowry at public expenses. 

Dumézil in his &quot;Archaic Roman Religion&quot; had been unable to interpret the myth underlying this legendary event, later though he accepted the interpretation given by P. Drossart and published it in his &quot;Fêtes romaines d&#x27;été et d&#x27;automne, suivi par dix questions romaines&quot; in 1975 as &quot;Question IX&quot;. In folklore the wild fig tree is universally associated with sex because of its fertilising power, the shape of its fruits and the white viscous juice of the tree.

Basanoff has argued that the legend not only alludes to sex and fertility in its association with wildfig and goat but is in fact a summary of sort of all the qualities of Juno. As Juno Sespeis of Lanuvium Juno Caprotina is a warrior, a fertiliser and a sovereign protectress. In fact, the legend presents a heroine, Tutela, who is a slightly disguised representation of the goddess: the request of the Latin dictator would mask an attempted evocatio of the tutelary goddess of Rome. Tutela indeed shows regal, military and protective traits, apart from the sexual ones. Moreover, according to Basanoff these too (breasts, milky juice, &quot;genitalia&quot;, present or symbolised in the fig and the goat) in general, and here in particular, have an inherently apotropaic value directly related to the nature of Juno. The occasion of the &quot;feria&quot;, shortly after the poplifugia, i.e. when the community is in its direst straits, needs the intervention of a divine tutelary goddess, a divine queen, since the king (divine or human) has failed to appear or has fled. Hence the customary battles under the wild figs, the scurrilous language that bring together the second and third function. This festival would thus show a ritual that can prove the trifunctional nature of Juno.

Other scholars limit their interpretation of Caprotina to the sexual implications of the goat, the &quot;caprificus&quot; and the obscene words and plays of the festival.

===Juno Curitis===
Under this epithet Juno is attested in many places, notably at Falerii and Tibur. Dumézil remarked that Juno Curitis &quot;is represented and invoked at Rome under conditions very close to those we know about for &quot;Juno Seispes&quot; of Lanuvium&quot;. Martianus Capella states she must be invoked by those who are involved in war. The hunt of the goat by stonethrowing at Falerii is described in Ovid &quot;Amores&quot; III 13, 16 ff. In fact the Juno Curritis of Falerii shows a complex articulated structure closely allied to the threefold Juno Seispes of Lanuvium.

Ancient etymologies associated the epithet with Cures, with the Sabine word for spear &quot;curis&quot;, with &quot;currus&quot; cart, with &quot;Quirites&quot;, with the &quot;curiae&quot;, as king Titus Tatius dedicated a table to Juno in every curia, that Dionysius still saw.

Modern scholars have proposed the town of Currium or Curria, Quirinus, &quot;*quir(i)s&quot; or &quot;*quiru&quot;, the Sabine word for spear and curia. The *quiru- would design the sacred spear that gave the name to the primitive curiae. The discovery at Sulmona of a sanctuary of Hercules &quot;Curinus&quot; lends support to a Sabine origin of the epithet and of the cult of Juno in the curiae. The spear could also be the &quot;celibataris hasta&quot; (bridal spear) that in the marriage ceremonies was used to comb the bridegroom&#x27;s hair as a good omen. Palmer views the rituals of the curiae devoted to her as a reminiscence of the origin of the curiae themselves in rites of &quot;evocatio&quot;, a practice the Romans continued to use for Juno or her equivalent at later times as for Falerii, Veii and Carthage. Juno Curitis would then be the deity evoked after her admission into the curiae.

Juno Curitis had a temple on the Campus Martius. Excavations in Largo di Torre Argentina have revealed four temple structures, one of whom (temple D or A) could be the temple of Juno Curitis. She shared her anniversary day with Juppiter Fulgur, who had an altar nearby.

===Juno Moneta===

This Juno is placed by ancient sources in a warring context. Dumézil thinks the third, military, aspect of Juno is reflected in Juno Curitis and Moneta. Palmer too sees in her a military aspect.

As for the etymology, Cicero gives the verb &quot;monēre&quot; warn, hence &quot;the Warner&quot;. Palmer accepts Cicero&#x27;s etymology as a possibility while adding &quot;mons&quot; mount, hill, verb &quot;e-mineo&quot; and noun &quot;monile&quot; referred to the Capitol, place of her cult. Also perhaps a cultic term or even, as in her temple were kept the &quot;Libri Lintei&quot;, &quot;monere&quot; would thence have the meaning of recording: Livius Andronicus identifies her as Mnemosyne.

Her &quot;dies natalis&quot; was on the kalendae of June. Her Temple on the summit of the Capitol was dedicated only in 348 BC by dictator L. Furius Camillus, presumably a son of the great Furius. Livy states he vowed the temple during a war against the Aurunci. Modern scholars agree that the origins of the cult and of the temple were much more ancient. M. Guarducci considers her cult very ancient, identifying her with Mnemosyne as &quot;the Warner&quot; because of her presence near the auguraculum, her oracular character, her announcement of perils: she considers her as an introduction into Rome of the Hera of Cuma dating to the 8th century. L. A. Mac Kay considers the goddess more ancient than her etymology on the testimony of Valerius Maximus who states she was the Juno of Veii. The sacred geese of the Capitol were lodged in her temple: as they are recorded in the episode of the Gallic siege (ca. 396-390 BC) by Livy, the temple should have existed before Furius&#x27;s dedication. Basanoff considers her to go back to the regal period: she would be the Sabine Juno who arrived at Rome through Cures. At Cures she was the tutelary deity of the military chief: as such she is never to be found among Latins. This new quality is apparent in the location of her &quot;fanum&quot;, her name, her role: 1. her altar is located in the regia of Titus Tatius; 2. Moneta is, from &quot;monere&quot;, &quot;the Adviser&quot;: like Egeria with Numa (Tatius&#x27;s son in law) she is associated to a Sabine king; 3. In Dionysius of Halicarnassus the altar-tables of the curiae are consecrated to Juno Curitis to justify the false etymology of Curitis from curiae: the tables would assure the presence of the tutelary &quot;numen&quot; of the king as an adviser within each curia, as the epithet itself implies. It can be assumed thence that Juno Moneta intervenes under warlike circumstances as associated to the sacral power of the king. Since coins were later made near her temple, her epithet, &quot;moneta&quot; became the Latin term for both the place where coins were made, but also for the currency itself (and the Latin word ultimately yielded in English both &quot;mint&quot; and &quot;money&quot;). 

===Juno Regina===
Juno Regina is perhaps the epithet most fraught with questions. While some scholars maintain she was known as such at Rome since the most ancient times as paredra (consort) of Jupiter in the Capitoline Triad others think she is a new acquisition introduced to Rome after her evocatio from Veii.

Palmer thinks she is to be identified with Juno Populona of later inscriptions, a political and military poliadic (guardian) deity who had in fact a place in the Capitoline temple and was intended to represent the &quot;Regina&quot; of the king. The date of her introduction, though ancient, would be uncertain; she should perhaps be identified with Hera Basilea or as the queen of Jupiter Rex. The actual epithet Regina could though come from Veii. At Rome this epithet may have been applied to a Juno other than that of the temple on the Aventine built to lodge the evocated Veian Juno as the rex sacrorum and his wife-queen were to offer a monthly sacrifice to Juno in the Regia. This might imply that the prerepublican Juno was royal.

J. Gagé dismisses these assumptions as groundless speculations as no Jupiter Rex is attested and in accord with Roe D&#x27;Albret stresses that at Rome no presence of a Juno Regina is mentioned before Marcus Furius Camillus, while she is attested in many Etruscan and Latin towns. Before that time her Roman equivalent was Juno Moneta. Marcel Renard for his part considers her an ancient Roman figure since the title of the Veian Juno expresses a cultic reality that is close to and indeed presupposes the existence at Rome of an analogous character: as a rule it is the presence of an original local figure that may allow the introduction of the new one through evocatio. He agrees with Dumézil that we ignore whether the translation of the epithet is exhaustive and what Etruscan notion corresponded to the name &quot;Regina&quot; which itself is certainly an Italic title. This is the only instance of evocatio recorded by the annalistic tradition. However Renard considers Macrobius&#x27;s authority reliable in his long list of &quot;evocationes&quot; on the grounds of an archaeological find at Isaura. Roe D&#x27;Albret underlines the role played by Camillus and sees a personal link between the deity and her magistrate. Similarly Dumézil has remarked the link of Camillus with Mater Matuta. In his relationship to the goddess he takes the place of the king of Veii. Camillus&#x27;s devotion to female deities Mater Matuta and Fortuna and his contemporary vow of a new temple to both Matuta and Iuno Regina hint to a degree of identity between them: this assumption has by chance been supported by the discovery at Pyrgi of a bronze lamella which mentions together Uni and Thesan, the Etruscan Juno and Aurora, i.e. Mater Matuta. One can then suppose Camillus&#x27;s simultaneous vow of the temples of the two goddesses should be seen in the light of their intrinsic association. Octavianus will repeat the same translation with the statue of the Juno of Perusia in consequence of a dream

That a goddess evoked in war and for political reasons receive the homage of women and that women continue to have a role in her cult is explained by Palmer as a foreign cult of feminine sexuality of Etruscan derivation. The persistence of a female presence in her cult through the centuries down to the lectisternium of 217 BC, when the &quot;matronae&quot; collected money for the service, and to the times of Augustus during the ludi saeculares in the sacrifices to Capitoline Juno are proof of the resilience of this foreign tradition.

Gagé and D&#x27;Albret remark an accentuation of the matronal aspect of Juno Regina that led her to be the most matronal of the Roman goddesses by the time of the end of the republic. This fact raises the question of understanding why she was able of attracting the devotion of the &quot;matronae&quot;. Gagé traces back the phenomenon to the nature of the cult rendered to the Juno Regina of the Aventine in which Camillus played a role in person. The original devotion of the &quot;matronae&quot; was directed to Fortuna. Camillus was devout to her and to Matuta, both matronal deities. When he brought Juno Regina from Veii the Roman women were already acquainted with many Junos, while the ancient rites of Fortuna were falling off. Camillus would have then made a political use of the cult of Juno Regina to subdue the social conflicts of his times by attributing to her the role of primordial mother.

Juno Regina had two temples (&quot;aedes&quot;) in Rome. The one dedicated by Furius Camillus in 392 BC stood on the Aventine: it lodged the wooden statue of the Juno transvected from Veii. It is mentioned several times by Livy in connexion with sacrifices offered in atonement of prodigia. It was restored by Augustus. Two inscriptions found near the church of S. Sabina indicate the approximate site of the temple, which corresponds with its place in the lustral procession of 207 BC, near the upper end of the Clivus Publicius. The day of the dedication and of her festival was September 1.

Another temple stood near the circus Flaminius, vowed by consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus in 187 BC during the war against the Ligures and dedicated by himself as censor in 179 on December 23. It was connected by a porch with a temple of Fortuna, perhaps that of Fortuna Equestris. Its probable site according to Platner is just south of the porticus Pompeiana on the west end of circus Flaminius.

The Carthaginian goddess Tanit was evoked at the defeat of Carthage in 146 BC, and romanized as Juno Caelestis (Heavenly Juno). One of her symbols was of the crescent moon. She did not receive a temple in Rome: presumably her image was deposited in another temple of Juno (Moneta or Regina) and later transferred to the Colonia Junonia founded by Caius Gracchus. The goddess was once again transferred to Rome by emperor Elagabalus. A surviving temple to Juno Caelestis was built between 222 and 235 AD in the town of Dougga.

===Juno in the Capitoline triad===
The first mention of a Capitoline triad refers to the &quot;Capitolium Vetus&quot;. The only ancient source who refers to the presence of this divine triad in Greece is Pausanias X 5, 1–2, who mentions its existence in describing the Φωκικόν in Phocis. The Capitoline triad poses difficult interpretative problems. It looks peculiarly Roman, since there is no sure document of its existence elsewhere either in Latium or Etruria. A direct Greek influence is possible but it would be also plausible to consider it a local creation. Dumézil advanced the hypothesis it could be an ideological construction of the Tarquins to oppose new Latin nationalism, as it included the three gods that in the Iliad are enemies of Troy. It is probable Latins had already accepted the legend of Aeneas as their ancestor. Among ancient sources indeed Servius states that according to the Etrusca Disciplina towns should have the three temples of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva at the end of three roads leading to three gates. Vitruvius writes that the temples of these three gods should be located on the most elevated site, isolated from the other. To his Etruscan founders the meaning of this triad might have been related to peculiarly Etruscan ideas on the association of the three gods with the birth of Herakles and the siege of Troy, in which Minerva plays a decisive role as a goddess of destiny along with the sovereign couple Uni Tinia.

===Junos of Latium===
The cults of the Italic Junos reflected remarkable theological complexes: regality, military protection and fertility.

In Latium are relatively well known the instances of Tibur, Falerii, Laurentum and Lanuvium.

At Tibur and Falerii their &quot;sacerdos&quot; was a male, called &quot;pontifex sacrarius&quot;, a fact that has been seen as a proof of the relevance of the goddess to the whole society. In both towns she was known as &quot;Curitis&quot;, the spearholder, an armed protectress. The martial aspect of these Junos is conspicuous, quite as much as that of fecundity and regality: the first two look strictly interconnected: fertility guaranteed the survival of the community, peaceful and armed. Iuno Curitis is also the tutelary goddess of the &quot;curiae&quot; and of the new brides, whose hair was combed with the spear called &quot;caelibataris hasta&quot; as in Rome. In her annual rites at Falerii youths and maiden clad in white bore in procession gifts to the goddess whose image was escorted by her priestesses. The idea of purity and virginity is stressed in Ovid&#x27;s description. A she goat is sacrificed to her after a ritual hunting. She is then the patroness of the young soldiers and of brides.

At Lanuvium the goddess is known under the epithet Seispes Mater Regina. The titles themselves are a theological definition: she was a sovereign goddess, a martial goddess and a fertility goddess. Hence her flamen was chosen by the highest local magistrate, the dictator, and since 388 BC the Roman consuls were required to offer sacrifices to her. Her sanctuary was famous, rich and powerful.

Her cult included the annual feeding of a sacred snake with barley cakes by virgin maidens. The snake dwelt in a deep cave within the precinct of the temple, on the &quot;arx&quot; of the city: the maidens approached the lair blindfolded. The snake was supposed to feed only on the cakes offered by chaste girls. The rite was aimed at ensuring agricultural fertility. The site of the temple as well as the presence of the snake show she was the tutelary goddess of the city, as Athena at Athens and Hera at Argos. The motif of the snake of the palace as guardian goddess of the city is shared by Iuno Seispes with Athena, as well as its periodic feeding. This religious pattern moreover includes armour, goatskin dress, sacred birds and a concern with virginity in cult. Virginity is connected to regality: the existence and welfare of the community was protected by virgin goddesses or the virgin attendants of a goddess. This theme shows a connexion with the fundamental theological character of Iuno, that of incarnating vital force: virginity is the condition of unspoilt, unspent vital energy that can ensure communion with nature and its rhythm, symbolised in the fire of Vesta. It is a decisive factor in ensuring the safety of the community and the growth of crops. The role of Iuno is at the crossing point of civil and natural life, expressing their interdependence.

At Laurentum she was known as Kalendaris Iuno and was honoured as such ritually at the kalendae of each month from March to December, i.e. the months of the pre-Numan ten-month year, a fact which is a testimony to the antiquity of the custom.

A Greek influence in their cults looks probable. It is noteworthy though that Cicero remarked the existence of a stark difference between the Latin Iuno Seispes and the Argolic Hera (as well the Roman Iuno) in his work De natura deorum. Claudius Helianus later wrote &quot;...she has much new of Hera Argolis&quot; The iconography of Argive Hera, matronal and regal, looks quite far away from the warlike and savage character of Iuno Seispes, especially considering that it is uncertain whether the former was an armed Hera.

After the definitive subjugation of the Latin League in 338 BC the Romans required as a condition of peace the condominium of the Roman people on the sanctuary and the sacred grove of Juno Seispes in Lanuvium, while bestowing Roman citizenry on the Lanuvians. Consequently, the &quot;prodigia&quot; (supernatural or unearthly phenomena) which happened in her temple were referred to Rome and accordingly expiated there. Many occurred during the presence of Hannibal in Italy. Perhaps the Romans were not completely satisfied with this solution as in 194 BC consul C. Cornelius Cethegus erected a temple to the &quot;Juno Sospita&quot; of Lanuvium in the Forum Holitorium (vowed three years earlier in a war with the Galli Insubri); in it the goddess was honoured in military garb. The flamen or special priest belonging to Juno Seispes continued to be a Lanuvian, specially nominated by the town to take care of the goddess even though she was housed in her temple at Rome (in the Forum Holitorium). At the time of Cicero, Milo, who served as the city&#x27;s dictator and highest magistrate in 52 BC (Cic. Mil. 27), and of course was also a Roman citizen (he had been tribune of the plebs in 57 BC), resided in Rome. When he fatally met Clodius near Bovillae (Milo&#x27;s slaves killed Clodius in that encounter), he was on his way to Lanuvium in order to nominate the flamen of Juno Seispes.

==Theological and comparative study==
The complexity of the figure of Juno has caused much uncertainty and debate among modern scholars. Some emphasize one aspect or character of the goddess, considering it as primary: the other ones would then be the natural and even necessary development of the first. Palmer and Harmon consider it to be the natural vital force of youthfulness, Latte women&#x27;s fecundity. These original characters would have led to the formation of the complex theology of Juno as a sovereign and an armed tutelary deity.

Georges Dumézil on the other hand proposed the theory of the irreducibility and interdependence of the three aspects (sovereignty, war, fertility) in goddesses that he interprets as an original, irreducible structure as hypothesised in his hypothesis of the trifunctional ideology of the Indoeuropeans. While Dumézil&#x27;s refusal of seeing a Greek influence in Italic Junos looks difficult to maintain in the light of the contributions of archaeology, his comparative analysis of the divine structure is supported by many scholars, as M. Renard and J. Poucet. His theory purports that while male gods incarnated one single function, there are female goddesses who make up a synthesis of the three functions, as a reflection of the ideal of woman&#x27;s role in society. Even though such a deity has a peculiar affinity for one function, generally fertility, i. e. the third, she is nevertheless equally competent in each of the three.

As concrete instances Dumézil makes that of Vedic goddess Sarasvatī and Avestic Anāhīta. Sarasvati as river goddess is first a goddess of the third function, of vitality and fertility associated to the deities of the third function as the Aśvin and of propagation as Sinīvalī. She is &quot;the mother&quot; and on her rely all vital forces. But at the same time she belongs to the first function as a religious sovereign: she is pure, she is the means of purifications and helps the conceiving and realisation of pious thoughts. Lastly she is also a warrior: allied with the Maruts she annihilates the enemies and, sole among female goddesses, bears the epithet of the warrior god Indra, vṛtraghnỉ, &quot;destroyer of oppositions&quot;. She is the common spouse of all the heroes of the Mahābhārata, sons and heirs of the Vedic gods Dharma, Vāyu, Indra and of the Aśvin twins. Though in hymns and rites her threefold nature is never expressed conjointly (except in Ṛg Veda VI 61, 12:: &quot;triṣadásthā&quot; having three seats).

Only in her Avestic equivalent Anahita, the great mythic river, does she bear the same three valences explicitly: her Yašt states she is invoked by warriors, by clerics and by deliverers. She bestows on females an easy delivery and timely milking. She bestowed on heroes the vigour by which they defeated their demonic adversaries. She is the great purifier, &quot;she who puts the worshipper in the ritual, pure condition&quot; (&quot;yaož dā&quot;). Her complete name too is threefold: &quot;The Wet (&quot;Arədvī&quot;), The Strong (&quot;Sūrā&quot;), The Immaculate (&quot;Anāhitā&quot;)&quot;.

Dumézil remarks these titles match perfectly those of Latin Junos, especially the Juno Seispes Mater Regina of Lanuvium, the only difference being in the religious orientation of the first function. Compare also the epithet Fluonia, Fluviona of Roman Juno, discussed by G. Radke. However D. P. Harmon has remarked that the meaning of Seispes cannot be seen as limited to the warrior aspect, as it implies a more complex, comprehensive function, i. e. of Saviour.

Among Germanic peoples the homologous goddess was bivalent, as a rule the military function was subsumed into the sovereign: goddess *Frīy(y)o- was at the same time sovereign, wife of the great god, and Venus (thence *Friy(y)a-dagaz &quot;Freitag for Veneris dies). However the internal tension of the character led to a duplication in Scandinavian religion: Frigg resulted in a merely sovereign goddess, the spouse of wizard god Óðinn, while from the name of Freyr, typical god of the third function, was extracted a second character, Freyja, confined as a Vani to the sphere of pleasure and wealth.

Dumézil opines that the theologies of ancient Latium could have preserved a composite image of the goddess and this fact, notably her feature of being &quot;Regina&quot;, would in turn have rendered possible her &quot;interpretatio&quot; as Hera.

==Associations with other deities==

===Juno and Jupiter===

The divine couple received from Greece its matrimonial implications, thence bestowing on Juno the role of tutelary goddess of marriage (&quot;Iuno Pronuba&quot;).

The association of Juno and Jupiter is of the most ancient Latin theology. Praeneste offers a glimpse into original Latin mythology: the local goddess Fortuna is represented as nursing two infants, one male and one female, namely Jove (Jupiter) and Juno. It seems fairly safe to assume that from the earliest times they were identified by their own proper names and since they got them they were never changed through the course of history: they were called Jupiter and Juno. These gods were the most ancient deities of every Latin town. Praeneste preserved divine filiation and infancy as the sovereign god and his paredra Juno have a mother who is the primordial goddess Fortuna Primigenia. Many terracotta statuettes have been discovered which represent a woman with a child: one of them represents exactly the scene described by Cicero of a woman with two children of different sex who touch her breast. Two of the votive inscriptions to Fortuna associate her and Jupiter: &quot; Fortunae Iovi puero...&quot; and &quot;Fortunae Iovis puero...&quot;

However, in 1882 R. Mowat published an inscription in which Fortuna is called &quot;daughter of Jupiter&quot;, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in the theology of Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this contradiction would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the &quot;Not-Bound&quot; or &quot;Enemy of Bondage&quot;, that shows that there is no question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign who represents the &quot;Creative Energy&quot;, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs.

===Juno and Janus===
The relationship of the female sovereign deity with the god of beginnings and passages is reflected mainly in their association with the kalendae of every month, which belong to both, and in the festival of the Tigillum Sororium of October 1.

Janus as gatekeeper of the gates connecting Heaven and Earth and guardian of all passages is particularly related to time and motion. He holds the first place in ritual invocations and prayers, in order to ensure the communication between the worshipper and the gods. He enjoys the privilege of receiving the first sacrifice of the new year, which is offered by the &quot;rex&quot; on the day of the Agonium of January as well as at the kalendae of each month: These rites show he is considered the patron of the cosmic year. Ovid in his &quot;Fasti&quot; has Janus say that he is the original Chaos and also the first era of the world, which got organised only afterwards. He preserves a tutelary function on this universe as the gatekeeper of Heaven. His nature, qualities and role are reflected in the myth of him being the first to reign in Latium, on the banks of the Tiber, and there receiving the god Saturn, in the age when the Earth could still bear gods. The theology of Janus is also presented in the carmen Saliare. According to Johannes Lydus the Etruscans called him Heaven. His epithets are numerous &quot;Iunonius&quot; is particularly relevant, as the god of the kalendae who cooperates with and is the source of the youthful vigour of Juno in the birth of the new lunar month. His other epithet &quot;Consivius&quot; hints to his role in the generative function.

The role of the two gods at the kalendae of every month is that of presiding over the birth of the new moon. Janus and Juno cooperate as the first looks after the passage from the previous to the ensuing month while the second helps it through the strength of her vitality. The rites of the kalendae included the invocations to Juno Covella, giving the number of days to the &quot;nonae&quot;, a sacrifice to Janus by the rex sacrorum and the pontifex minor at the &quot;curia Calabra&quot; and one to Juno by the regina sacrorum in the Regia: originally when the month was still lunar the &quot;pontifex minor&quot; had the task of signalling the appearance of the new moon. While the meaning of the epithet Covella is unknown and debated, that of the rituals is clear as the divine couple is supposed to oversee, protect and help the moon during the particularly dangerous time of her darkness and her &quot;labours&quot;: the role of Juno Covella is hence the same as that of Lucina for women during parturition. The association of the two gods is reflected on the human level at the difficult time of labours as is apparent in the custom of putting a key, symbol of Janus, in the hand of the woman with the aim of ensuring an easy delivery, while she had to invoke Juno Lucina. At the nonae Caprotinae similarly Juno had the function of aiding and strengthening the moon as the nocturnal light, at the time when her force was supposed to be at its lowest, after the Summer solstice.

The Tigillum Sororium was a rite (sacrum) of the gens Horatia and later of the State. In it &quot;Janus Curiatius&quot; was associated to &quot;Juno Sororia&quot;: they had their altars on opposite sides of the alley behind the Tigillum Sororium. Physically this consisted of a beam spanning the space over two posts. It was kept in good condition down to the time of Livy at public expenses. According to tradition it was a rite of purification that served at the expiation of Publius Horatius who had murdered his own sister when he saw her mourning the death of her betrothed Curiatius. Dumézil has shown in his &quot;Les Horaces et les Curiaces&quot; that this story is in fact the historical transcription of rites of reintegration into civil life of the young warriors, in the myth symbolised by the hero, freed from their &quot;furor&quot; (wrath), indispensable at war but dangerous in social life. What is known of the rites of October 1 shows at Rome the legend has been used as an aetiological myth for the yearly purification ceremonies which allowed the &quot;desacralisation&quot; of soldiers at the end of the warring season, i.e. their cleansing from the religious pollution contracted at war. The story finds parallels in Irish and Indian mythologies. These rites took place in October, the month that at Rome saw the celebration of the end of the yearly military activity. Janus would then be the patron of the &quot;feria&quot; as god of transitions, Juno for her affinities to Janus, especially on the day of the kalendae. It is also possible though that she took part as the tutelary goddess of young people, the &quot;iuniores&quot;, etymologically identical to her. Modern scholars are divided on the interpretation of J. Curiatius and J. Sororia. Renard citing Capdeville opines that the wisest choice is to adhere to tradition and consider the legend itself as the source of the epithets.

M. Renard advanced the view that Janus and not Jupiter was the original paredra or consort of Juno, on the grounds of their many common features, functions and appearance in myth or rites as is shown by their cross coupled epithets Janus Curiatius and Juno Sororia: Janus shares the epithet of Juno Curitis and Juno the epithet Janus Geminus, as &quot;sororius&quot; means paired, double. Renard&#x27;s theory has been rejected by G. Capdeville as not being in accord with the level of sovereign gods in Dumézil&#x27;s trifunctional structure. The theology of Janus would show features typically belonging to the order of the gods of the beginning. In Capdeville&#x27;s view it is only natural that a god of beginnings and a sovereign mother deity have common features, as all births can be seen as beginnings, Juno is invoked by deliverers, who by custom hold a key, symbol of Janus.

===Juno and Hercules===
Even though the origins of Hercules are undoubtedly Greek his figure underwent an early assimilation into Italic local religions and might even preserve traces of an association to Indoiranian deity Trita Apya that in Greece have not survived. Among other roles that Juno and Hercules share there is the protection of the newborn. Jean Bayet, author of &quot;Les origines de l&#x27;Arcadisme romain&quot;, has argued that such a function must be a later development as it looks to have superseded that of the two original Latin gods Picumnus and Pilumnus.

The two gods are mentioned together in a dedicatory inscription found in the ruins of the temple of Hercules at Lanuvium, whose cult was ancient and second in importance only to that of Juno Sospita. In the cults of this temple just like in those at the Ara maxima in Rome women were not allowed. The exclusion of one sex is a characteristic practice in the cults of deities of fertility. Even though no text links the cults of the Ara maxima with Juno Sospita, one of her temples was located in the Forum Olitorium near the Carmental Gate, one of the sites of the legend of Hercules in Rome. The feria of the goddess coincides with a &quot;Birthday of Hercules&quot; (), which was celebrated with , games in the circus. In Bayet&#x27;s view Juno and Hercules did supersede Pilumnus and Picumnus in the role of tutelary deities of the newborn not only because of their own features as goddess of the deliverers and as apotropaic tutelary god of infants but also because of their common quality as gods of fertility. This was the case in Rome and at Tusculum where a cult of Juno Lucina and Hercules was known. At Lanuvium and perhaps Rome though their most ancient association rests on their common fertility and military characters. The Latin Junos certainly possessed a marked warlike character (at Lanuvium, Falerii, Tibur, Rome). Such a character might suggest a comparison with the Greek armed Heras one finds in the South of Italy at Cape Lacinion and at the mouth of river Sele, military goddesses close to the Heras of Elis and Argos known as &quot;Argivae&quot;. In the cult this Hera received at Cape Lacinion she was associated with Heracles, supposed to be the founder of the sanctuary. Contacts with Central Italy and similarity would have favoured a certain assimilation between Latin warlike Junos and Argive Heras and the association with Heracles of Latin Junos. Some scholars, mostly Italians, recognize in the Junos of Falerii, Tibur and Lavinium the Greek Hera, rejecting the theory of an indigenous original cult of a military Juno. Renard thinks Dumézil&#x27;s opposition to such a view is to be upheld: Bayet&#x27;s words though did not deny the existence of local warlike Junos, but only imply that at a certain time they received the influence of the Heras of Lacinion and Sele, a fact that earned them the epithet of &quot;Argive&quot; and a Greek connotation. However Bayet recognized the quality of mother and of fertility deity as being primitive among the three purported by the epithets of the Juno of Lanuvium (Seispes, Mater, Regina).

Magna Graecia and Lanuvium mixed their influence in the formation of the Roman Hercules and perhaps there was a Sabine element too as is testified by Varro, supported by the find of the sanctuary of Hercules Curinus at Sulmona and by the existence of a Juno Curitis in Latium.

The mythical theme of the suckling of the adult Heracles by Hera, though being of Greek origin, is considered by scholars as having received its full acknowledgement and development in Etruria: Heracles has become a bearded adult on the mirrors of the 4th and 3rd centuries BC. Most scholars view the fact as an initiation, i.e. the accession of Heracles to the condition of immortal. Even though the two versions coexisted in Greece and that of Heracles infant is attested earlier Renard suggests a process more in line with the evolution of the myth: the suckling of the adult Heracles should be regarded as more ancient and reflecting its original true meaning.

===Juno and Genius===
The view that Juno was the feminine counterpart to Genius, i.e. that as men possess a tutelary entity or &quot;double&quot; named genius, so women have their own one named &quot;juno&quot;, has been maintained by many scholars, lastly Kurt Latte. In the past it has also been argued that goddess Juno herself would be the issue of a process of abstraction from the individual &quot;junos&quot; of every woman. According to Georg Wissowa and K. Latte, Genius (from the root &quot;gen-&quot;, whence &quot;gigno&quot; bear or be born, archaic also &quot;geno&quot;) would designate the specific virile generative potency, as opposed to feminine nature, reflected in conception and delivery, under the tutelage of Juno Lucina. Such an interpretation has been critically reviewed by Walter F. Otto.

While there are some correspondences between the ideas about genius and &quot;juno&quot;, especially in the imperial age, the relevant documentation is rather late (Tibullus mentions it first). Dumézil also remarks that from these passages one could infer that every woman has a Venus too. As evidence of the antiquity of the concept of a &quot;juno&quot; of women, homologous to the &quot;genius&quot; of men, is the Arval sacrifice of two sheep to the Juno Deae Diae (&quot;the juno of goddesses named Dea Dia&quot;), in contrast to their sacrifice of two cows sacrificed to Juno (singular). However both G. Wissowa and K. Latte allow that this ritual could have been adapted to fit theology of the Augustan restoration. While the concept of a Juno of goddesses is not attested in the inscriptions of 58 BC from Furfo, that of a Genius of gods is, and even of a Genius of a goddess, Victoria. On this point it looks remarkable that also in Martianus Capella&#x27;s division of Heaven a &quot;Juno Hospitae Genius&quot; is mentioned in region IX, and not a &quot;Juno&quot;: the sex of this Genius is feminine.

Romans believed the genius of somebody was an entity that embodied his essential character, personality, and also originally his vital, generative force and &quot;raison d&#x27; être&quot;. However the genius had no direct relationship with sex, at least in the conceptions of the classical period, even though the nuptial bed was named &quot;lectus genialis&quot; in honour of the Genius and brides on the day of marriage invoked the genius of their grooms. This seems to hint to a significance of the &quot;Genius&quot; as the propagative spirit of the &quot;gens&quot;, of whom every human individual is an incarnation: Censorinus states: &quot;Genius is the god under whose tutelage everyone is born and lives on&quot;, and that &quot;many ancient authors, among whom Granius Flaccus in his &quot;De Indigitamentis&quot;, maintain that he is one and the same with the Lar&quot;, meaning the Lar Familiaris. Festus calls him &quot;a god endowed with the power of doing everything&quot;, then citing an Aufustius: &quot;Genius is the son of the gods and the parent of men, from whom men receive life. Thence is he named my genius, because he begot me&quot;. Festus&#x27;s quotation goes on saying: &quot;Other think he is the special god of every place&quot;, a notion that reflects a different idea. In classic age literature and iconography he is often represented as a snake, that may appear in the conjugal bed, this conception being perhaps the result of a Greek influence. It was easy for the Roman concept of Genius to expand annexing other similar religious figures as the Lares and the Greek δαίμων ἀγαθός.

The genius was believed to be associated with the forehead of each man, while goddess Juno, not the &quot;juno&quot; of every woman, was supposed to have under her jurisdiction the eyebrows of women or to be the tutelary goddess of the eyebrows of everybody, irrespective of one&#x27;s sex.

===Juno and the Penates===
According to one interpretation of the Di Penates, Juno, along with Jupiter and Minerva, is one of the Penates of man. This view is ascribed by Macrobius to the mystic religion of Samothrace, imported to Rome by Tarquinius Priscus, himself an initiate, who thereby created the Roman Capitoline Triad. Juno is the god by whom man gets his body.

===Heries Junonis===
Among the female entities that in the pontifical invocations accompanied the naming of gods, Juno was associated to Heries, which she shared with Mars (&quot;Heres Martea&quot;).

==Festivals==
All festivals of Juno were held on the kalendae of a month except two (or, perhaps, three): the &quot;Nonae Caprotinae&quot; on the nonae of July, the festival of &quot;Juno Capitolina&quot; on September 13, because the date of these two was determined by the preeminence of Jupiter. Perhaps a second festival of &quot;Juno Moneta&quot; was held on October 10, possibly the date of the dedication of her temple. This fact reflects the strict association of the goddess with the beginning of each lunar month.

Every year, on the first of March, women held a festival in honour of Juno Lucina called the Matronalia. Lucina was an epithet for Juno as &quot;she who brings children into light&quot;. On this day, lambs and cattle were sacrificed in her honor in the temple of her sacred grove on the Cispius.

The second festival was devoted to &quot;Juno Moneta&quot; on June 1.

After this was the festival of the &quot;Nonae Caprotinae&quot; (&quot;The Nones of the Wild Fig&quot;) held on July 7.

The festival of &quot;Juno Regina&quot; fell on September 1, followed on the 13th of the same month by that of &quot;Juno Regina Capitolina&quot;.

October 1 was the date of the &quot;Tigillum Sororium&quot; in which the goddess was honoured as &quot;Juno Sororia&quot;.

The last of her yearly festivals was that of &quot;Juno Sospita&quot; on February 1. It was an appropriate date for her celebration since the month of February was considered a perilous time of passage, the cosmic year then coming to an end and the limits between the world of the living and the underworld being no longer safely defined. Hence the community invoked the protection (&quot;tutela&quot;) of the warlike &quot;Juno Sospita&quot;, &quot;The Saviour&quot;.

Juno is the patroness of marriage, and many people believe that the most favorable time to marry is June, the month named after the goddess.

==Etrurian Uni, Hera, Astarte and Juno==
The Etruscans were a people who maintained extensive (if often conflicting) contacts with the other peoples of the Mediterranean: the Greeks, the Phoenicians, and the Carthaginians.

Evidence of intense cultural exchanges with the Greeks has been found in 1969 at the sanctuary of the port of Gravisca near Tarquinia. Renard thinks the cult of Hera in great emporia such as Croton, Posidonia, Pyrgi might be a counter to Aphrodite&#x27;s, linked to sacred prostitution in ports, as the sovereign of legitimate marriage and family and of their sacrality. Hera&#x27;s presence had already been attested at Caere in the sanctuary of Manganello. In the 18th century a dedication to Iuno Historia was discovered at Castrum Novum (Santa Marinella). The cult of Iuno and Hera is generally attested in Etruria.

The relationship between Uni and the Phoenician goddess Astarte has been brought to light by the discovery of the Pyrgi Tablets in 1964. At Pyrgi, one of the ports of Caere, excavations had since 1956 revealed the existence of a sacred area, intensely active from the last quarter of the 4th century, yielding two documents of a cult of Uni. Scholars had long believed the Etruscan goddess Uni was strongly influenced by the Argive Heras and had her Punic counterpart in the Carthaginian goddess Tanit, identified by the Romans as Juno Caelestis. Nonetheless Augustine of Hippo had already stated that Juno was named Astarte in the Punic language, a notion that the discovery of the Pyrgi lamellae has proved correct. It is debated whether such an identification was linked to a transient political stage corresponding with Tefarie Velianas&#x27;s Carthaginian-backed tyranny on Caere as the sanctuary does not show any other trait proper to Phoenician ones. The mention of the goddess of the sanctuary as being named locally Eileitheia and Leucothea by different Greek authors narrating its destruction by the Syracusean fleet in 384 BC, made the picture even more complex. R. Bloch has proposed a two-stage interpretation: the first theonym Eilethya corresponds to Juno Lucina, the second Leucothea to Mater Matuta. However, the local theonym is Uni and one would legitimately expect it to be translated as Hera. A fragmentary bronze lamella discovered on the same site and mentioning both theonym Uni and Thesan (i. e. Latin Juno and Aurora-Mater Matuta) would then allow the inference of the integration of the two deities at Pyrgi: the local Uni-Thesan matronal and auroral, would have become the Iuno Lucina and the Mater Matuta of Rome. The Greek assimilation would reflect this process as not direct but subsequent to a process of distinction. Renard rejects this hypothesis since he sees in Uni and Thesan two distinct deities, though associated in cult. However the entire picture should have been familiar in Italian and Roman religious lore as is shown by the complexity and ambivalence of the relationship of Juno with Rome and Romans in Virgil&#x27;s Aeneid, who has Latin, Greek and Punic traits, result of a plurisaecular process of amalgamation. Also remarkable in this sense is the &quot;Fanum Iunonis&quot; of Malta (of the Hellenistic period) which has yielded dedicatory inscriptions to Astarte and Tanit.

===Juno in Martianus Capella&#x27;s division of Heaven===
Martianus Capella&#x27;s collocation of gods into sixteen different regions of Heaven is supposed to be based on and to reflect Etruscan religious lore, at least in part. It is thence comparable with the theonyms found in the sixteen cases of the outer rim of the Piacenza Liver. Juno is to be found in region II, along with Quirinus Mars, Lars militaris, Fons, Lymphae and the dii Novensiles. This position is reflected on the Piacenza Liver by the situation of Uni in case IV, owing to a threefold location of Tinia in the first three cases that determines an equivalent shift.

An entity named Juno Hospitae Genius is to be found alone in region IX. Since Grotius (1599) many editors have proposed the correction of Hospitae into Sospitae. S. Weinstock has proposed to identify this entity with one of the spouses of Neptune, as the epithet recurs below (I 81) used in this sense.

In region XIV is located Juno Caelestis along with Saturn. This deity is the Punic Astarte/Tanit, usually associated with Saturn in Africa. Iuno Caelestis is thence in turn assimilated to Ops and Greek Rhea. Uni is here the Punic goddess, in accord with the identification of Pyrgi. Her paredra was the Phoenician god Ba&#x27;al, interpreted as Saturn. Capdeville admits of being unable to explain the collocation of Juno Caelestis among the underworld gods, which looks to be determined mainly by her condition as spouse of Saturn.

==Juno Caelestis==
Juno became the subject of major cult worship in North Africa, where she was merged with the indigenous Goddess Tanit.

The temple of Juno Caelestis, dedicated to the City Protector Goddess Juno Caelestis, was one of the biggest building monuments of Carthage, and became a holy site for pilgrims from all Northern Africa and Spain. 
This was one of the biggest holy sites in the Roman Empire.

== Temple at Samos ==
The Ionian Greeks of the island of Samos built a sanctuary to the goddess Hera, beginning perhaps in the 8th century BC. Herodotus described the temple within the sanctuary as one of Samos&#x27; three marvels of engineering, the other two being the Tunnel of Eupalinos and the harbor works of the island capital. Hera being equated with Juno, the temple is also associated with the Roman goddess, for example in Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s fanciful yet vivid description of the temple ruins in his &quot;Genealogia Deorum.&quot;

== In literature ==
Perhaps Juno&#x27;s most prominent appearance in Roman literature is as the primary antagonistic force in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, where she is depicted as a cruel and savage goddess intent upon supporting first Dido and then Turnus and the Rutulians against Aeneas&#x27; attempt to found a new Troy in Italy. Servius the Grammarian, commenting on some of her several roles in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, supposes her as a conflation of Hera with the Carthaginian storm-goddess Tanit. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; offers a story accounting for her sacred association with the peacock. She is remembered in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot;, a collection of biographies of historical and mythological women by the Florentine author Giovanni Boccaccio, composed in 136162. It is notable as the first collection devoted exclusively to biographies of women in Western literature. William Shakespeare briefly employs Juno as a masque character in &quot;The Tempest&quot; (Act IV, Scene I).

== Modern reception ==

=== Spaceflight ===

In spaceflight, NASA launched a space probe to Jupiter in 2011, and named it Juno in reference to her relationship to the god Jupiter in mythology.

<doc id="668601" wikidata="Q688785" url="?curid=668601" title="Sea Launch">
<text>Sea Launch was a multinational—Norway, Russia, Ukraine, United States—spacecraft launch company founded in 1995 that provided orbital launch services from 1999 to 2014. The company used a mobile maritime launch platform for equatorial launches of commercial payloads on specialized Zenit-3SL rockets from a former mobile/floating oil drilling rig renamed &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

By 2014, it had assembled and launched thirty-two rockets, with an additional three failures and one partial failure. All commercial payloads were communications satellites intended for geostationary transfer orbit with such customers as EchoStar, DirecTV, XM Satellite Radio, PanAmSat, and Thuraya.

The approach Sea Launch LLC used was to assemble the launcher on a purpose-built ship &quot;Sea Launch Commander&quot; in Nimitz Rd., Long Beach, California, USA. The assembled spacecraft was then positioned on top of the self-propelled &quot;Odyssey&quot; floating launch platform and moved to the equatorial Pacific Ocean for launch, with the &quot;Sea Launch Commander&quot; serving as tracking, command &amp; telemetry (TCT) center. The movable system means the rocket can travel to the equator for launch, which increases payload capacity.

Sea Launch mothballed its ships and put operations on long-term hiatus in 2014, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By 2015, discussions on disposition of company assets were underway, and the Sea Launch partners were in a court-administered dispute about unpaid expenses that Boeing claims it incurred.

In September 2016, S7 Group, owner of S7 Airlines, purchased the assets of Sea Launch. Launch services were to potentially be provided by S7 Sea Launch, a US subsidiary. However, after moving the two former Sea Launch ships from California to Vladivostok, the S7 Group chairman stated that the program was indefinitely suspended. As of 2020, a replacement for the Zenit launch vehicle, with its Ukrainian first stage, was expected to be years away.

==History==
Sea Launch was established in 1995 as a consortium of four companies from Norway, Russia, Ukraine and the United States, managed by Boeing with participation from the other shareholders. The first rocket was launched in March 1999.

On March 17, 2006, it was announced that Jim Maser, the President and General Manager of Sea Launch, would leave the company to join SpaceX as President and Chief Operating Officer.

In June 2009, the provider of the Sea Launch service, Sea Launch Co. LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Sea Launch asserted that it would &quot;continue to maintain all normal business operations after the filing for reorganization.&quot; On August 6, 2010, Energia, which already owned 25% of Sea Launch, announced it planned to acquire a controlling interest of 85% in the company. As a result, the company planned to begin land-based launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in early 2011, while sea-based launches to be resumed in September 2011.

Sea Launch emerged from bankruptcy effective October 27, 2010. Energia Overseas Limited, a Russian corporation, is majority owner of the reorganized entity, with Boeing and other American companies retaining minority shares.

In 2013, Boeing sued RSC Energia, PO Yuzhnoye and KB Yuzhnoye. According to Boeing the companies refused to pay more than $350 million following the joint venture&#x27;s bankruptcy filing in 2009.

In mid-2014, following the 2014 Russian military invasion in Ukraine and the subsequent unrest in the eastern part of the country, there were a number of Russian media reports that indicated Sea Launch may be planning to inactivate the &quot;Odyssey&quot; launch platform. The company formally denied those reports in June 2014, indicating it is continuing to buy Zenit rockets from Ukraine, and is still promoting its launch services to the international market, even in August 2014. However, in August 2014, Sea Launch conducted a reduction of their staff and removed from operating status both the &quot;Commander&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot; vessels in order to reduce operating costs during a period where they have no launches scheduled until late 2015.

In July 2015, industry experts stated that the Chinese government was considering the purchase of the Sea Launch command ship and launch platform assets, but this was not confirmed by either company or Chinese government officials.

In September 2015, Boeing won a court judgement against the Russian and Ukrainian partners within Sea Launch. The decision set up a court trial planned for November 2015 where Boeing would argue that it was not properly reimbursed for of expenses incurred while operating the Sea Launch launch system. This litigation was decided in favor of Boeing on May 12, 2016.

As of December 2015, Roscosmos and Energia were attempting to find a buyer for the Sea Launch assets, due to the high cost of infrastructure maintenance of approximately per year.

In September 2016, S7 Group, owner of S7 Airlines announced they were purchasing Sea Launch. The launch and assembly ship &quot;Sea Launch Commander&quot; arrived in Russia on March 17, 2020, and was moored at the Slavyanka Shipyard after customs procedures. The launch platform &quot;Odyssey&quot; arrived at the shipyard on March 30.

In August 2020, Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov told the media on the sidelines of the Army-2020 forum that the floating spaceport Sea Launch, currently based at Russia’s Slavyanka port in the Primorye Territory, will be restored. The news release indicated it would require about 35 billion rubles (roughly $470 million) to restore the platform. Funding was not confirmed at the time of the release.

Borisov indicated that before the floating spaceport left its port Long Beach, California, the United States in accordance with its laws removed all equipment from the command ship and the floating platform. &quot;It’s mostly equipment responsible for positioning, based on GPS technologies. We will be able to replace it with GLONASS solutions. As for the launch system itself, in other words, the equipment needed for bringing the rocket to and placing it at the launch pad and automatically fueling the tanks, all this is done through Russian technologies,&quot; Borisov said.

In June 2020, the CEO of Russia’s space corporation Roscosmos, Dmitry Rogozin, said in his column in Forbes magazine that Russian specialists would have to exert considerable efforts to restore the floating spaceport Sea Launch to operation. He said that before its handover to the company S7 all space launch control equipment was dismantled.

==Ownership and business==
Sea Launch was founded by four companies from four countries, which shared the original ownership of offshore Cayman Islands-registered Sea Launch. Ship &quot;Sea Launch&quot; registered Monrovia after reorganising from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010, a majority share of the company was acquired by Russian interests.

The project was helped by Hughes Space and Communications, which in 1995 signed the first contract for 10 launches and 10 options, valued at $1 billion, and Space Systems/Loral, which then signed a five-launch contract.

Total cost of the project has been reported at $583 million in 1996. Chase Manhattan arranged about $400 million in loans in 1996. Loans were later guaranteed against political instability in Russia and Ukraine through 2012 by the World Bank (up to $175 million, of these up to $100 million in Russia and up to $75 million in Ukraine) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (up to $65 million).

Sea Launch has a reciprocal agreement with Arianespace and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries through the Launch Services Alliance, providing assurance in case either company&#x27;s system is not able to launch a payload for reasons of reliability, capacity, backlog, or otherwise. This was used for the first time in 2004 when Arianespace&#x27;s Ariane 5 had to reschedule a group of launches for reliability reasons.

In 1999, shortly after the company was founded, the Sea Launch consortium claimed that their launch-related operating costs would be lower than a land-based equivalent due in part to reduced staff requirements. The platform and command ship have 310 crew members.

==Launches==

The first demonstration satellite was launched on March 27, 1999, and the first commercial satellite on October 9, 1999. Sea Launch has launched 36 rockets with 32 successes and 1 partial success as of March 2019. The first failure, of a Hughes-built communications satellite owned by ICO Global Communications, occurred on the second commercial launch on March 12, 2000, and was blamed on a software error that failed to close a valve in the second stage of the rocket.

A second rocket failed to launch on January 30, 2007, when Zenit-3SL exploded on the launch pad with the Boeing 702 NSS-8 satellite on board, seconds after engine ignition.

All Sea Launch missions to date have used the custom-designed three-stage Zenit-3SL launch vehicle, capable of placing up to of payload into geosynchronous transfer orbit. Sea Launch rocket components are manufactured by SDO Yuzhnoye / PO Yuzhmash in Dnepropetrovsk, USSR (Dnipro, Ukraine) — Zenit rocket for the first and second stages; by Energia in Kaliningrad, USSR (Moscow, Russia) — Block DM-SL for third stage); and by Boeing in Seattle, United States — payload fairing and interstage structure.

Sea Launch rockets were assembled in Long Beach, California. The typical assembly was done on board the Assembly and Command Ship (the payload is first tested, fueled and encapsulated in the nearby Payload Processing Facility). The rocket is then transferred to a horizontal hangar on the self-propelled launch platform.

Following rocket tests, both ships then sail about to the equator at 154° West Longitude, , in international&quot; waters about from Kiritimati, Kiribati. The platform travels the distance in about 11 days, the command ship in about eight days.

With the platform ballasted to its launch depth of , the hangar is opened, the rocket is mechanically moved to a vertical position, and the launch platform crew evacuates to the command ship which moves about away. Then, with the launch platform unmanned, the rocket is fueled and launched. The final ten seconds before launch are called out simultaneously in English and Russian.

==NSS-8 launch failure==
On January 30, 2007, the Sea Launch Zenit-3SL rocket carrying NSS-8 and 500 tons of fuel exploded on (flight) launch. Available imagery shows a fireball much larger than the launch platform at sea level.

Since the launch pad platform is vacated by all engineers during the automated launch process, there were no injuries. On February 1, 2007, Sea Launch released a statement detailing its status.

It is believed that the failure was caused by a foreign object being ingested by the engine turbopump, causing the rocket to crash immediately.

On February 3, 2007, photographs of the damage were posted on internet forums. The launch platform damage is mostly superficial, though blast deflectors underneath the launch platform were knocked loose and were lost when they fell into the sea.

In March 2007, shortly after the NSS-8 launch failure, Hughes Network Systems switched the launch of SPACEWAY-3 from a Sea Launch Zenit-3SL to an Ariane 5.

Repairs of the launch platform were completed in September 2007. The Sea Launch platform underwent repairs in Canada, docked near CFB Esquimalt, just west of Victoria, British Columbia, and departed on July 31, 2007. Both vessels returned to their home Nimitz military port in Long Beach, California, U.S.

==Concerns and investigations==
During project development in 1998 Boeing was fined US$10 million by the United States Department of State for technical violations of the Arms Export Control Act in handling of missile technology while dealing with its foreign Sea Launch partners. This is the largest civil penalty of its kind, although it could have been as much as US$102 million. The Sea Launch project was suspended for two months during the investigation.

The Department of State found that between January 1994 and January 1998 Boeing illegally exported &quot;defense articles&quot; and &quot;defense services&quot;, although no national security breaches were determined. The violations were uncovered by Boeing&#x27;s internal investigation.

At about the same time United States Customs Service attempted to block Sea Launch from bringing Zenit-3SL rockets (classified as missiles) into California for assembly without a munitions import licence. The matter was settled in the company&#x27;s favour.

Also in 1998, 16 member states of the South Pacific Forum issued a communiqué asking the United States to suspend the project indefinitely until and unless their environmental concerns are remedied. It was mostly criticized by the island nation of Kiribati.

The project was criticized in 1997 by International Transport Workers&#x27; Federation (ITWF) for registering its ocean vessels in Liberia. In May 1999 Sea Launch reached an agreement with the ITWF, which allows crew members to use ITWF inspectors.

In Russia, since 2014, a criminal investigation has been ongoing against the former president of RSC Energia, Vitaly Lopota. Investigators accuse him of illegally repaying Sea Launch’s debts and purchasing its shares to the detriment of the corporation’s core activities in 2010-2013. Lopota does not admit guilt, and the Russian Prosecutor General&#x27;s Office has already twice rejected charges against him. In November 2023, the Investigative Committee again brought charges, this time reducing the amount from 9 billion rubles to 4.2 billion rubles.

==Land launch==

Using existing Zenit infrastructure at the military Baikonur Cosmodrome, the &quot;Land Launch&quot; system is based on a modified version of the Sea Launch vehicle, the three stage Zenit-3SL mod.B rocket. Land Launch&#x27;s Zenit 3SLB vehicle addresses the launch needs of Block DM (syncom, U.S.), Block Boeing witch TDRSS, commercial satellites weighing up to . The two stage Zenit 2 (first stage LV &quot;Energia) is also available for lifting payloads up to to LEO low Earth orbits.

The first launch was on April 28, 2008, (04.28.2008) when a Zenit-3SLB launched Spacecom Ltd&#x27;s AMOS-3 spacecraft from LC 45/1 (launch pad) at Baikonur.

==Advantages of equatorial ocean-platform based launches==

Advantages of equatorial launch site:
*The rotational speed of the Earth is greatest at the equator, providing an extra launch &quot;boost&quot;.
*The need for a &quot;plane change&quot; to the zero degree inclination of geostationary orbit is eliminated, providing a major extra launch &quot;boost&quot;. This allows 17.5–25% more mass to be launched to geostationary orbit than the same rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, which is at 28.5 degrees north latitude. 
*Any orbital inclination could be reached, thus (for example) combining in one launch site the attainable inclinations of both Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg.

Advantages of ocean-based over a conventional land-based launch platform:
*An ocean launch reduces risks related to launching over populated areas, providing better safety to third parties.
*Absence of range conflicts with other launch systems and a near total absence of ship or overhead air traffic that would constrain launch.

<text>:&quot;See Mizrahi Jews for more information about the Eastern Jews.&quot;

Maghrebi Jews ( or , &quot;Maghrebim&quot;), are a Jewish diaspora group with a long history in the Maghreb region of North Africa, which includes present-day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. These communities were established long before the Arab conquest, and continued to develop under Muslim rule during the Middle Ages. Maghrebi Jews represent the second-largest Jewish diaspora group, with their descendants forming a major part of the global Jewish population.

Maghrebi Jews lived in multiple communities in North Africa for over 2,000 years, with the oldest Jewish communities present during Roman times and possibly as early as within Punic colonies of the Ancient Carthage period. Under early Muslim rule, Jews flourished in major urban centers across the region. However, they also faced periods of persecution, notably under the Almohads. Before and after the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492, many Sephardic Jews fleeing persecution settled in North Africa. Over time, Maghrebi Jews largely mixed with the newly arrived Sephardic Jews, and in most cases, they adopted the Sephardic Jewish identity.

The mixed Maghrebi-Sephardic Jewish communities collapsed in the mid-20th century as part of the Jewish exodus from Arab countries, moving mostly to Israel, France, Canada and Venezuela. Today, descendants of Maghrebi-Sephardic Jews in Israel have largely embraced the modern Israeli Jewish identity and in many cases intermix with Ashkenazi and Mizrahi Jewish communities there. Most of the Maghrebi-Sephardic Jews (&quot;Western&quot; Jews) also consider themselves as part of Mizrahi Jewish community (&quot;Eastern&quot;, or Babylonian Jews), even though there is no direct link between the two communities. They have similar histories of Arabic-speaking background and a parallel exodus and expulsion from Arab and Muslim countries: the Mizrahim left nations of the Middle East, and the Maghrebi-Sephardics left nations of North Africa in the mid-20th century. Among Arab countries, the largest Jewish community now exists in Morocco with about 2,000 Jews and in Tunisia about 1,000.

The term Maghrebi Jews often refers to communities such as Moroccan Jews, Algerian Jews, Tunisian Jews, and Libyan Jews. The term Musta&#x27;arabi was also used by medieval Jewish authors to refer to Jews who had traditionally lived in the Maghreb. Due to proximity, the term &#x27;Maghrebi Jews&#x27; sometimes refers to Egyptian Jews as well, though there are important cultural differences between the history of Egyptian and Maghrebi Jews.

==Early history==

=== Antiquity ===
The earliest known Jewish communities in North Africa, excluding Egypt, emerged in Cyrenaica (modern-day eastern Libya) as early as the third century BCE. Originally colonized by Greeks, this region became home to a significant Jewish population under Ptolemy I of Egypt. Ptolemy, who governed a major diaspora center in Egypt where Jews had been migrating from Judah since the sixth century BCE, sent Jews to Cyrene and other cities in Cyrenaica to secure these territories for his kingdom. By 95 BCE, when Cyrenaica came under Roman control, the Jewish population remained substantial. The geographer Strabo, writing in the early first century BCE, described Cyrene as comprising four groups, including Jews, indicating the community&#x27;s size and importance at the time. A notable figure among the Cyrenaic Jews was Simon of Cyrene, referenced in the New Testament.

After Jewish defeat in the First Jewish-Roman War in 70 CE, Roman General Titus deported many Jews to Mauretania, which roughly corresponds to the modern Maghreb, and many of them settled in what is now Tunisia. These settlers engaged in agriculture, cattle-raising, and trade. They were divided into clans, or tribes, governed by their respective heads, and had to pay the Romans a capitation tax of 2 shekels.

The Jewish diaspora uprising of 116–117 CE led to a major defeat for the Jews, resulting in the near-total destruction of Jewish communities in Cyrenaica and Egypt. By the third century, Jewish communities began to re-establish themselves in Cyrenaica and Egypt, primarily through immigration from the Land of Israel. 

In the area of Carthage, in modern-day Tunisia, the earliest evidence of Jews is found in inscriptions from the second century CE. Although some theories suggest a Jewish presence during the Punic period, there is no archaeological or literary support for this earlier timeline. A Jewish necropolis, possibly dating to the third century, was discovered at Gamart, north of Carthage, including numerous burial chambers and features Hebrew inscriptions and Jewish symbols such as the &quot;menorah&quot; and &quot;shofar&quot;. The oldest known synagogue in western North Africa, found in Hammam-Lif, in modern Tunisia, dates to the late fourth or early fifth century. In Morocco, Hebrew-language epitaphs and menorah-decorated lamps from late antiquity have been found in the Roman city of Volubilis. 

After 429 CE, with the fairly tolerant Vandals, the Jewish residents of the North African province increased and prospered to such a degree that African Church councils decided to enact restrictive laws against them. Berber lands east of Alexandria were relatively tolerant and were historically very welcoming for Christians and Jews during the Roman Empire notably. After the overthrow of the Vandals by Belisarius in 534 CE, Justinian I issued his edict of persecution, in which the Jews were classed with the Arians and s.

A community settled in Djerba island off the coast of southern Tunisia during the Roman period. Mainly composed of Cohanim, they notably built the Ghriba synagogue with stones coming directly from Jerusalem. &#x27;La Ghriba&#x27; is still to this day annually visited by many North African Jews.

=== Early Muslim rule ===

Under Muslim domination Jewish communities developed in important urban centers such as Kairouan and coastal cities of Tunisia, in Tlemcen, Béjaïa and Algiers in the Central Maghreb and as far as in the extreme Maghreb (modern Morocco) especially Fes and in the Atlas Mountains among the Berber populations. The relationships between Muslims and Jews in the Maghreb were relatively good thanks to the Al Andalus peaceful era, until the ascension of the Almohades, who persecuted non-Muslims to a large extent during their early reign. Later Jews were relatively well treated by the Berber Muslim dynasties, namely the Merinids, Zianides and Zirides.

In the seventh century, the Jewish population was augmented by Iberian Jewish immigrants, who, fleeing from the persecutions of the Visigothic king Sisebut and his successors, escaped to the Maghreb and settled in the local Byzantine Empire. 

Fez and Tunis, respectively in Morocco and Tunisia, became important Sephardic rabbinical centers, well until the early 20th century, when most Jewish populations emigrated to Israel, France, Canada and Latin America.

Following the massacre of 1391 in Spain, a significant migration of Jews and &quot;conversos&quot; moved from Iberia and Mallorca to North Africa, including notable rabbis like Isaac ben Sheshet and Simon ben Zemach Duran. This migration increased in the latter part of the 15th century due to anti-Converso violence in 1473 and the intensification of the Spanish Inquisition in the 1480s, which led to the expulsion of Jews from Andalusia. As Spanish military forces advanced into Málaga and Granada, many Jews from these regions sought refuge in Morocco and Algiers.

=== Expulsion from Spain after 1492 ===

North Africa became a primary refuge for Jews expelled from Spain in 1492, along with other destinations such as Portugal, Italy, and the Ottoman Empire. Contemporary accounts describe the severe hardships initially faced by these refugees in North African lands. Solomon ibn Verga recorded instances of starvation so extreme that people resorted to eating grass, while Judah ibn Hayyat described seeking refuge from the cold by burrowing into garbage heaps. Jewish refugees from Spain were later joined by those fleeing Portugal, especially after the mass forced conversions of 1497.

Upon arrival, Spanish and Portuguese Jews found North African cities already home to Jewish communities of diverse backgrounds. These included both long-established Jewish populations (&quot;&quot;Toshavim&quot;) and recent arrivals from earlier expulsions (&quot;Megorashim&quot;&quot;). The newcomers often faced integration issues, leading to the formation of distinct communities. Key areas of settlement included major cities in coastal areas like Tlemçen and Oran, as well as inland centers such as Fez. Sephardi Jews quickly dominated Jewish communal life in Morocco due to their scholarly and mercantile elite status. Some newcomers integrated into existing communities, while others remained separate due to cultural and leadership differences. The reception of these exiles was shaped more by local conditions and less by religious ideology. Political protection and social status were often precarious, with frequent outbreaks of violence and economic pressures impacting both Jews and Muslims.

Around the time of the Spanish Inquisition the Counter-Reformation was taking place. The Counter-Reformation was the Catholic response to the Protestant Reformation, a movement in Europe that strived to popularize the newer sect of Christianity, Protestantism, throughout Europe. The Counter-Reformation mostly took place in Southern Europe, which is a large reason as to why Southern Europe is, for the most part, far more Catholic and far less Protestant than the majority of Northern Europe. The Counter-Reformation, being a movement to preserve and strengthen the Catholic influence on society, was opposed not only to Protestantism but to any non-Catholic belief that was seen as a threat to the Catholic society. Thus, the Jews of Spain overwhelmingly moved directly south to the Maghreb Region of North Africa and quickly prospered.

== Recent history ==

=== World War II and the Holocaust ===
On the eve of World War II, 400,000 Jews resided in the Maghreb; throughout this time, each country differed in its treatment of its respective Jewish population.

Algerian Jews (approximately 35,000) had been granted French citizenship by the Cremieux Decree in 1870. France&#x27;s Vichy Regime, then, oversaw the Jewish community in Algeria during World War II and imposed anti-Semitic measures such as stripping Jews of their civil rights, forcing them to wear identification markers, and putting quotas on their admission to primary schools.

Tunisia was the only country with direct contact with the German army; Germany occupied the country for six months from 1942 to 1943 until it was recaptured by the Allied forces. Under German occupation, the Jewish population, then 89,000, endured the Nazi regime and were subjected to harsh mistreatment.

In Morocco, there were anti-Jewish laws put into effect and at least 2,100 Jews were forcibly interned in work camps.

=== Emigration ===
The creation of the state of Israel in 1948 led to many countries promoting anti-Jewish behavior especially in Muslim-majority areas. This contributed significantly to the emigration of Jews from the countries of the Maghreb. This exodus was a combination of push and pull, augmented with the independence of the Maghreb countries in the 1950s and early 1960s, as Jews were seen as being supportive of the previous colonial French.

Tunisia was a French protectorate since 1881, and the country fought for independence from 1952 to 1956, after which many of the 105,000 Jews within the community emigrated. In recent decades, the Jewish community has continued to shrink as many emigrated to Israel, France, and other countries.

After Morocco declared independence in 1956, most of the 225,000 Jews in Morocco emigrated to Israel, France and Canada.

In Algeria, the National Liberation Front fought and won independence from France in 1961. After Algeria won independence, the Jewish population of 140,000 began a massive and definitive exodus mainly to France due to increased animosity towards Jews.

=== Maghrebi Jews in Israel ===
The early Zionists were majority Ashkenazi Jews who affiliated themselves strongly with Theodor Herzl, the founder of modern Zionism. Maghrebi Jews, along with other Mizrahi Jews and Sephardi Jews, did not begin to arrive in masses, though some of the Maghrebi Jews were already in Israel by the 18th century and onwards, like who had laid the foundations to Tel-Aviv; in Israel until after Israel was established as a state. The early Zionists tended to be secular, as Zionism (as Herzl founded it) was a secular nationalist movement that recognized Jews as a whole Nation, and saw the Land of Israel as the ancestral homeland of the Jews.

In the mid 20th Century, the Arab World (in this case North Africa) began to undergo some vast internal changes. The notion of Pan-Arabism came about in the earlier years of the 20th Century, and the cultural, linguistic, and political influences of European colonial powers in the region began to sharply decline. As Arab unity increased, so did the opposition to any form of colonialism. With this new sentiment, the 20th century North African and Arab countries heavily opposed Zionism and many Arab leaders saw the movement as simply a continuation of European colonialism, due to the vast majority of early Zionist migrants coming from Europe.

Maghrebi Jews have an enormous cultural influence in Israel. Falafel is widely known as the National Food of Israel, and due to falafel&#x27;s origins in the Middle East and North Africa, Maghrebi Jews, along with other Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews from the Middle East and North Africa, played an enormous role in making falafel an Israeli staple. Mizrahi music, one of Israel&#x27;s most popular genres, carries a lot of influence from Maghrebi Jews. Some popular Mizrahi music singers of Maghrebi descent include: Eyal Golan, Sarit Hadad, Moshe Peretz, Dana International, Zehava Ben, and Kobi Peretz, all of Moroccan descent.

Religiously, Maghrebi Jews (along with Sephardic/Mizrahi Jews as a whole) are heavily classified as Masortim, contrasting Israelis of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, whom are more secular. Politically, Maghrebi Jews tend to vote Likud.

== Communities ==

=== Morocco ===
Morocco, the North African nation with the largest Jewish population both at the start of the 20th Century and today, had a Jewish population of ~275,000 at its peak around the time of the establishment of Israel. A significant number of Moroccan Jews are descendants of the Berber-speaking Jews who once lived in the Atlas Mountains. Today, the Jewish population in Morocco is estimated to be just about 2,000. Since the expulsion from Spain after 1492, Moroccan Jews shared many customs of everyday life and a common spoken language (Berber or Moroccan Arabic) with their Muslim neighbours, which led to a rich mutual cultural heritage of music, poetry, food and crafts.

After the establishment of Israel, a mass exodus of the Jewish population began and the vast majority of Moroccan Jews emigrated to Israel, as very few Moroccan Jews had left before to Mandatory Palestine. Israel launched a series of operations to bring Jews, who were facing persecution, to Israel from various Middle Eastern and North African countries. A famous operation that brought nearly 100,000 Moroccan Jews to Israel from 1961 to 1964 was Operation Yachin.

Today, Jews of Moroccan descent in Israel tend to identify with their background and remain in touch with their traditional culture. A part of Moroccan Jewish culture revolves around Sephardic music and food. Shakshouka, a traditional Maghrebi dish, has become popular in Israel through the influence of Moroccan Jews.

=== Algeria ===

Algerian Jews are quite similar to Moroccan Jews in many regards due to the proximity of Algeria and Morocco. Both communities were intertwined linguistically, culturally, and historically. A Jewish presence in Algeria existed since before the Roman-era, but most Algerian Jews trace a significant amount of their history back to the culture of al-Andalus.

Since 1848, Algeria had been part of the French motherland, and with the 1870 Crémieux Decree Algerian Jews were granted French citizenship. Meanwhile, the indigenous Muslim Arab and Berber populations remained under second-class status, giving rise to Muslim friction that culminated in the 1934 Constantine riots. After the German invasion of France, Algeria came under Vichy rule: Jews had their French citizens’ rights taken away, were sacked from public service jobs and subject to quotas and restrictions.

The Crémieux Decree and thereby Jewish citizenship were reinstated after World War II, keeping Algerian Jews committed to their French status throughout the Algerian War, in which an estimated 1.5 million Algerians were killed. In the wake of the war, while most Algerian Muslims supported the independence, the majority of the Algerian Jews tied their fate to France with many of them supporting and even joining the OAS. In the last 15 months of the war, over 130 attacks against Jews or Jewish establishments occurred; the two most symbolically significant being the looting of the Great Synagogue of Algiers in December 1960, and the assassination of popular singer Cheikh Raymond on a public market in Constantine in June 1961. These two incidents in particular gave the impetus for Jewish immigration from Algeria, albeit subsumed into the great mass of pieds-noirs leaving Algeria for France.

At the time of World War II, there were around 130,000 Jews living in Algeria. More recently, their number is estimated by the United States Department of State at less than 200. Algerian Jews are unique in that they are the only community of North African Jews that did not overwhelmingly emigrate to Israel during the Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries; instead, the majority of Algerian Jews chose France as their destination. Their &quot;repatriation&quot; represents a unique case in the history of Jewish migration given that even though they were psychologically uprooted, they &quot;returned&quot; to France as citizens and not as refugees.

=== Tunisia ===
Like its neighboring Algeria, Tunesia came under Vichy rule in July 1940, subjecting Tunesian Jews to the same antisemitic Statut des Juifs as in mainland France which restricted Jews in the public service, in educational institutions and journalism, and in liberal professions. In May 1941, the worst outbreak of violence against Jews in North Africa during World War II occurred in Gabès in a riot that killed seven Jews and wounding twenty.

After the Allied invasion of North Africa, Tunisia was directly occupied by German forces in November 1942. The Nazis immediately arrested Moise Borgel, the president of the Tunis Jewish community, along with other prominent Jews, before implementing a regime of forced-labor, property confiscation, hostage-taking, mass extortion, deportations, and executions. Thousands of countryside Jews were forced to wear the yellow badge, but none were transported to the extermination camps in Eastern Europe due to the distance from Tunisia as well as the short time span of the German occupation, which ended in May 1943.

The population of Tunisian Jews stood at around 105,000 in 1948. Shortly after independence in 1956, a government decree meant to eliminate all confessional tribunals, including courts based on Sharia law, also abolished rabbinical tribunal and Jewish community councils, which the Jewish community understood as a curtailment of their autonomy. While Habib Bourguiba continuously worked to reassure the Jews of their safe and equal position within Tunisian society, going so far as to include a Jewish nationalist, Albert Bessis, in his first cabinet, he failed to curb the increasing instances of violent anti-Jewish outburst, particularly following the Six-Day War in 1967, when the Grand Synagogue of Tunis was looted and burned to the ground. The number of Tunisian Jews decreased to around 20,000 by 1967. A further 7,000 Jews immigrated to France. As of 2021, the population of Jews in Tunisia is numbered at around 1,000.

In 2018, the first Jewish minister since Bessis, René Trabelsi, was appointed to lead the Ministry of Tourism.

=== Libya ===

Libyan Jews are the smallest community of all Maghrebi Jews, yet the community is still rich in history, tradition, and culture. The history of Libyan Jews is one that is approximately 2,300 years old, and the population of Jews in Libya peaked at around 40,000 in 1945.

As Libya was occupied by Italy throughout most of the first half of the 20th century, the racial laws that targeted Jews and minimized their freedoms were enacted in Libya. As the Italians enacted laws that directly exploited and suppressed Jews, the Jews of Libya were more welcoming to the arrival of the Allies of World War II&#x27;s entering Libya. Italy saw the Jews as enemies, and Mussolini sought to cleanse Libya of its Jewish population, a movement called Sfollamento. Through the movement of Sfollamento, Libyan Jews were sent to concentration camps; the location of those camps depended on if they had British, French, or Libyan-Italian citizenship.

Libya was liberated by the Allies in January 1943, but even with the eradication of the racial laws, the conditions for Jews did not improve a whole lot. Anti-semitism was widespread amongst a Libyan culture that had just been heavily influenced by fascism; as a result, the vast majority of Libyan Jews emigrated, primarily to Israel once it was established as a state. The 1945 Anti-Jewish riots in Tripolitania sparked a pogrom that killed 140 Jews. Riots and antisemitic violence did not subside, leaving the Jews of Libya with very little choice but to leave. Today, there are no more Jews living in Libya.

== Genetics ==

In 2012, a study by Campbel et al. found that North African Jews were more closely related to each other and to European and Middle Eastern Jews than to their non-Jewish host populations.The genome-wide ancestry of North African Jewish groups was compared with respect to European (Basque), Maghrebi (Tunisian non-Jewish), and Middle Eastern (Levant) origins. The Middle Eastern component was found to be comparable across all North African Jewish and non-Jewish groups (around 40%), while North African Jewish groups showed increased European (35-40%) and decreased level of North African (Maghrebi) ancestry (20%) with Moroccan and Algerian Jews tending to be genetically closer to Europeans than Djerban Jews, the latter being a highly endogamous group.

<doc id="668610" wikidata="Q2400788" url="?curid=668610" title="University of the Third Age">
<text>The u3a movement (u3a) is an international movement whose aims are the education and stimulation of mainly retired members of the community — those in their third &#x27;age&#x27; of life. Formerly known as University of the Third Age this was altered in a rebrand during 2020.

There is no universally accepted model for the u3a. Its original conception in France as an extramural university activity was significantly modified in the United Kingdom where it was recognised that most people of retirement age have something to contribute and the emphasis has been on sharing, without formal educational links.

Many English-speaking countries have followed this geragogic model, whereas continental European countries have mostly followed the French model. 

A British u3a website reports this about membership eligibility: &quot;There is no minimum age, but a focus on people who are no longer in full-time employment or raising a family.&quot;

== History ==

=== France ===
u3a started in France at the Faculty of Social Sciences in Toulouse in 1973. It was started by Prof. Pierre Vellas. In France, each University of the Third Age University group is mostly associated with a local university. This academic model is used in many other countries, in particular in continental Europe. The university affiliation generates various opportunities such as highly qualified teaching personnel, a variety of subject choices, opportunity for students and faculty to conduct research based on the professional, cultural or historical experiences of the elderly, etc. U3As do not issue diplomas but rather certificates and teach in many fields according to the interests of the groups of older students (usually 55+) such as computer skills, languages, entrepreneurship, hereditary law, religion, politics, etc. Sometimes U3As provide groups with vocational training and formal continuous education opportunities.

In the 1990s the concept was broadened in France to the notion of the University of All Ages (UTA - université tous âges) or University of Free Time (UTL - université du temps libre). The UFUTA changed its name to &quot;Union Française des Universités de Tous Ages&quot; (retaining the acronym). Some French university departments have adopted the title of &quot;Université du Temps Libre&quot;.

AIUTA (&quot;Association Internationale des Universités du Troisième Âge&quot;) is the global international organization and network of Universities of the Third Age, including such institutions from most continental European countries, Central and East Europe, China, Russia, Latin America, etc., including Mauritius and other destinations.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1981, the concept reached the United Kingdom, where its nature was radically changed to be more a self-help organisation under the influence of its founders, Peter Laslett, Michael Young and Eric Midwinter.

The UK network comprises in excess of 1,000 groups, in towns and cities; as of January 2020 total membership exceeded 450,000.

Each u3a is formally structured as an independent self-financing and self-managing charity with links to the Third Age Trust, a national coordinating body. Each individual u3a comprises a number of activity groups which may cover a wide range of different topics - e.g. arts, languages, physical activity, discussion, and games. Most u3as are centred on a particular town or region and their activity groups meet in a hired hall or small groups meet in a member&#x27;s house. Although primarily for the retired, many u3as open their membership to any people not in full-time employment.

In 2009 the Virtual University of the Third Age (vu3a) was launched with the intention of offering the same friendship, support and learning enjoyed by off-line groups. vU3A is affiliated to the Third Age Trust in the UK. vU3A is open to anyone, in particular those who, by circumstances of isolation, health problems or other restrictions, cannot get to a U3A group.

Some groups in other countries affiliate to the Third Age Trust. For example, in Cyprus there are C3A (Cyprus Third Age) and P3A (Paphos Third Age).

=== Central and Eastern Europe ===
Some Central (and Eastern) European countries were introduced to the U3A quite early: Poland, Czech Republic (formerly part of Czechoslovakia) and Slovenia. The Slovenian University of the Third Age was started by two university professors in 1984 and has developed into a network of 40 universities over the entire country. The Italian University of the Third Age is called Università delle Tre Età (UNITRE) with several locations in the country. &quot;UNITRE Milano&quot;, the university of the third age in Milan, provides courses as well as educational content such as on line courses and peer-reviewed journal articles.

There is an online University of the Third Age in Russia.

=== Spain ===
With a large numbers of immigrants (aka expats) from the UK, the U3A is well represented in Spain. Most groups are centred around coastal areas known for english speaking populations.

Each U3A operates independently, as there is not a single organisation overseeing U3A in Spain. Each U3A usually offer a range of special interest groups to members. 

=== Australia ===
U3A began in Australia in 1984 and as of 2023, has grown to 250 U3As with approximately 100,000 members. These are based in metropolitan, regional and rural areas, and follow the British self-help model of teaching and learning over a wide range of subject areas, dependent upon the membership&#x27;s own expertise, knowledge and skills.

Each U3A operates independently and takes the needs and interests of their members into consideration when deciding which classes/activities they will offer. U3As offer membership at very low cost so that anyone in their third age (nearing retirement and beyond) can become a member. Each U3A is also a member of a state/territory Network (where available), and can share ideas/tutors and resources.

U3AA (U3A Australia) is the national body formed by state networks to support all U3As in their state or territory with a range of resources.

=== Canada ===
The Third Age Network (TAN) is active in Canada, however currently only within the province of Ontario. The head office is located at the G. Raymond Chang School of Continuing Education at Toronto Metropolitan University in Toronto. The network started in 2007 and has grown to 21 groups by 2018. Simon Fraser University was the first university in North America to create a series of courses for seniors at the post-secondary level. Its mandate was to provide educational programs for older adults that were responsive to their psychological and physiological characteristics.

The Third Age Mission: &quot;To foster Third Age Learning and share issues and solutions to common organizational challenges. We do this by promoting the establishment of organizations that provide opportunities for older adults to learn in a friendly, social setting and by supporting adult learning organizations in this process by sharing strategies and techniques to accomplish this goal.&quot;

TAN runs a newsletter and hosts organization-wide symposiums and forums. It also provides support to local groups with things like information on speakers, networking with colleagues, data on member operations, including honoraria paid to speakers, board make up, rental costs, affordable group insurance, a regular newsletter, conferences and workshop, guidance for creating a website, internal and external communication.

=== Turkey ===

Ege 3rd University (U3A) is a social responsibility project initiated in 2016 at Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Geriatrics in Izmir. Trainings are carried out entirely on a voluntary basis, nearly 300 teachers teach. In addition to the weekday classes, public seminars are also held in Ege U3A training.

U3A students carry out projects in cooperation with non-governmental organizations for community service and intergenerational communication

== Courses ==

Typical courses include Art, Classical Studies, Conversation, Computers, Crafts, Debate, Drama, Film/Cinema Studies, History, Languages, Literature, Music, Sciences, Social Sciences, and Philosophy.

There are also many less educationally-focused activities, such as Games (including bridge tuition and duplicate bridge playing groups), Health, Fitness &amp; Leisure (including countryside walks), Theatre/Concert Clubs, Travel Clubs, and Dance in all its forms.

Some study groups work to a formal syllabus, but others draw on current affairs or specific interests of group members. Some groups are designed to cross disciplinary boundaries, for example, combining Society, Technology and Science in a fashion not practical in more formal academic environments.

U3A groups are well positioned to conduct serious research into local history and genealogy.

<text>Cats Don&#x27;t Dance is a 1997 American animated musical comedy film directed by Mark Dindal. The film features the voices of Scott Bakula, Jasmine Guy, Matthew Herried, Ashley Peldon, John Rhys-Davies, Kathy Najimy, Don Knotts, Hal Holbrook, Betty Lou Gerson (in her final film role), René Auberjonois, Dindal, and George Kennedy.

The film&#x27;s musical numbers were written by Randy Newman and includes the contributions of Gene Kelly as choreographer, before his death in 1996. The film was Kelly&#x27;s final film project and is dedicated to his memory. It is the only fully animated feature produced by Turner Feature Animation, which was merged during the post-production of &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; into Warner Bros. Feature Animation after the merger of Time Warner with Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.

&quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; was released in the United States and Canada on March 26, 1997, by Warner Bros. under its Family Entertainment label. It was a box-office failure, grossing $3.5 million domestically due to lack of promotion. Despite this, the film received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for its animation, humor, characters, voice performances, and musical numbers.

== Plot ==

In an alternate 1939, in a world where humans and anthropomorphic animals coexist, Daniel &quot;Danny&quot; T. Cat, an optimistic orange tabby cat from Kokomo, Indiana, travels to Hollywood in hopes of starting an acting career there. After meeting a young penguin named Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film that is in production at Mammoth Pictures called &quot;Lil&#x27; Ark Angel&quot;, alongside Wink&#x27;s secretary, a cynical Turkish Angora named Sawyer. Upon joining fellow animals—Tilly the hippo, Cranston the goat, Frances the fish, and T.W the tortoise—Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries weaseling his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny unwittingly angers Darla Dimple, a popular yet spoiled child actress and star of the film; she promptly has her gigantic gorilla-like butler Max intimidate Danny against further attempts to enlarge his part.

Danny learns from the studio&#x27;s mascot Woolie the elephant that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals, whereas animals themselves end up getting minor and often thankless roles to the point of having little to no leverage in show business. The next day, Danny reminds the other animals of their past aspirations by instigating a mass musical performance in an alleyway, which draws Darla&#x27;s attention. Overhearing Danny&#x27;s intention to make an appeal to Mammoth Pictures head L.B. Mammoth, Darla invites Danny to her mansion and grants him and the animals full use of the &quot;Li&#x27;l Ark Angel&quot; stage on the day of a press conference held by Mammoth, on the condition that Danny not reveal her involvement in this ostensibly charitable act. Danny happily accepts the offer, unaware that Darla is secretly setting the animals up for failure to prevent them from stealing her spotlight. As the animals prepare their performance on the ark, Darla and Max create a catastrophic flood that washes through Mammoth studios, for which Mammoth blames and dismisses the animals. When the satisfied Darla arrives to thank Danny, he is admonished for his naivety and advised by Woolie to return to Kokomo.

That night, Sawyer takes to heart Danny&#x27;s attempts to keep the animals&#x27; dreams alive and tries catching him at the bus stop, but narrowly misses him. However, after a comment from the bus driver and seeing Pudge wander the streets, Danny stops the bus and secretly invites Sawyer, Woolie, Tillie, Cranston, Frances and T.W. to the &quot;Lil&#x27; Ark Angel&quot; premiere. After the screening, Danny battles Max and sends him flying away by deflating Darla&#x27;s parade balloon, then calls the audience&#x27;s attention, only to be mocked by Darla, but Sawyer brings the others backstage to help Danny and Pudge. After Danny convinces them not to give up on their dreams no matter what the humans have said or done, the eight animals put on a musical performance that entertains and impresses the viewers. Meanwhile, Darla&#x27;s attempts to sabotage the performance drastically enhance it, bringing a standing ovation from the audience. A frustrated Darla admits responsibility for the flood, inadvertently exposing herself to the public and Mammoth in the process. Darla tries hiding her true colors, but Pudge pulls a lever, which causes her to fall into a trapdoor. Danny and Sawyer admit their feelings for each other and the animals achieve their dreams for larger roles.

== Voice cast ==
* Scott Bakula as Danny, an ambitious, optimistically naïve orange tabby from Kokomo, Indiana, who wishes to become a famous Hollywood star.
* Jasmine Guy as Sawyer, a disenchanted sarcastic white persian/siamese mix cat secretary of Farley Wink and Danny&#x27;s love interest, later girlfriend.
** Natalie Cole provides her singing vocals.
* Matthew Herried as Peabo &quot;Pudge&quot; Pudgemyer, a little penguin and Danny&#x27;s first friend who looks up to him as a big brother. Herried was cast after he asked the animators for directions at a cafe, because of which they instantly thought he was perfect for the role.
* Ashley Peldon as Darla Dimple, the villainous human child star of Hollywood. She conceals her anger and sinister nature from her fans and superiors through a facade of sweetness and innocence, and is willing to do anything to maintain her star status. She is referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s sweetheart, lover of children and animals!&quot; Darla is based on Shirley Temple and Norma Desmond.
** Lindsay Ridgeway provides her singing vocals.
* Kathy Najimy as Tillie Hippo, an optimistic hippopotamus who tries to find the best in every situation.
* John Rhys-Davies as Woolie the Mammoth, the aging Asian elephant who portrays the mascot for Mammoth Pictures. He originally came to Hollywood to write and perform music where he acts as a mentor to Danny upon befriending him. Woolie is a parody of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s mascot Leo the Lion.
* Betty Lou Gerson as Frances Albacore, a sarcastic fish who is together with Cranston Goat.
* Hal Holbrook as Cranston Goat, an elderly, cranky goat. He and Frances are both passionate on dancing.
* Don Knotts as T.W. Turtle, a neurotic, superstitious turtle.
** Rick Logan provides his singing vocals.
* George Kennedy as L.B. Mammoth, the human head of Mammoth Pictures. He is a parody of Louis B. Mayer. 
* René Auberjonois as Flanigan, the human film director of &quot;Li&#x27;l Ark Angel&quot;.
* Mark Dindal as Max, Darla&#x27;s gargantuan valet who obeys her every command and will not hesitate to punish anyone who crosses her, serving as the direct force that Darla physically lacks as a child. 
* Frank Welker as Farley Wink, a human agent for animals and Sawyer&#x27;s boss.
* David Johansen as Bus Driver, a man whose insults towards the animals getting fired from Mammoth Studios inspire Danny with his last plan to give the animals their long-awaited stardom.
* Dee Bradley Baker as Kong, a gorilla who appears while Danny and Sawyer are going to the set of &quot;Li&#x27;l Ark Angel&quot; at Mammoth Studios.
* Tony Pope as Alligator
* Peter Renaday as Narrator
* Amick Byram/Bobbi Page/Susan Boyd/Carmen Twillie/Sally Stevens/Bob Joyce/Oren Waters/Andrea Robinson/Terry Wood as &quot;Nothing Is Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; chorus

== Production ==
=== Development ===
The film was launched in 1993 as a vehicle for Michael Jackson, who would produce, star, and be a consultant in the music and choreography. It would have been a hybrid live-action/CGI film, but by 1994, Jackson had ceased to be involved in the film. In its earlier stages, the film concerned less anthropomorphic stray cats that live among the sets and studio backlots. At one point, David Shire and Richard Maltby Jr. composed songs for the film before Randy Newman was hired.

Turner Animation was run by David Kirschner, and had originated as the feature division of Hanna-Barbera, where Kirschner was CEO. The Turner Animation writing department added cat characters based on stories about the filming of Warner Bros. Studios productions like &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955), and &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1962); stagehands would feed feral cats, which dominated the back lot for decades. Producers David Kirschner and Paul Gertz then decided to have dance numbers in the vein of classic musical films like &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952). Kershner felt the style would appeal to a wide audience. The 1930s Hollywood backdrop also inspired the premise of anthropomorphic animals being allegories of those who did not look and/or sound mainstream struggling to gain attention in Hollywood in the late 1930s.

Kirschner contacted Mark Dindal to be director of the project a year after the two met and while Dindal was working on &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (1991). Around the same time, Brian McEntee joined as art director, Randy Newman joined as composer, and Gene Kelly joined as dance consultant. Dindal, Kirschner, and McEntee noticed the improving animation technology and were excited to see how it would be incorporated with traditional animation in &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;; McEntee himself worked on the computer-animated ballroom scene in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1991). The team watched old musical films for reference before asking Kelly, who instantly joined due to his interest in the story. One meeting took place at Kelly&#x27;s house between him and Dindal, and he vividly remembered how the films he starred in were choreographed.

During production, management at Turner Feature Animation changed repeatedly and each head that came in attempted to take drastic revisions, including updating the setting to the 1950s rock-and-roll era. Dindal said: &quot;It&#x27;s pretty hard to try and keep what you have finished so far, and then suddenly transition into a different period of time or introduce a different character or have a completely different ending that doesn&#x27;t seem to fit the beginning you have&quot;.

Dindal&#x27;s portrayal of Max was initially a scratch track and was never intended to be heard on the film. Dindal wanted Max to be voiced by a professional actor, but as the film started running out of money, he kept his own vocals in.

=== Music ===
Steve Goldstein composed much of the score. For the film, Randy Newman composed songs inspired by the classic songs of the Golden Age of Hollywood, including &quot;Danny&#x27;s Arrival Song&quot;, &quot;Little Boat On The Sea&quot;, &quot;Animal Jam Session&quot;, &quot;Big and Loud&quot;, &quot;Tell Me Lies&quot;, and &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot;, while the opening and ending pop song &quot;Our Time Has Come&quot; was written by Martin Page and the end credits song &quot;I Do Believe&quot; was written by Simon Climie and Will Downing. Goldstein and Newman gathered a couple of nominations at the Annie Awards, with the latter winning the award for the musical numbers written and composed by him.

Original songs performed in the film include:

== Release ==
New Line Cinema, which was a sister company to Turner Feature Animation at the time, expressed interest in distributing the film, but when Turner Broadcasting merged with Time Warner in 1996, the film fell into the ownership of Warner Bros. Pictures. &quot;Pullet Surprise&quot;, a newly produced &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; short film featuring Foghorn Leghorn, preceded the film&#x27;s theatrical release, and &quot;The Big Sister&quot;, a &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot; &quot;What a Cartoon!&quot; short, followed the film in its original home video release.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; had its first home video release by Warner Home Video, on VHS and LaserDisc on August 19, 1997, only four months and twenty-four days after its theatrical release. To promote the release, Warner partnered with Continental Airlines, in which the buyer received an in-pack coupon worth $125 in savings on a Continental flight. A $2 instant savings coupon with the additional purchase of either &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993), &quot;&quot;, &quot;Richie Rich&quot; (1994), or the 25th anniversary edition of &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot; was also included.

The film had also its first DVD release on September 3, 2002 in a pan-and-scan format with bonus features. A re-release of the same DVD, but bundled with &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot;, was released on May 2, 2006. Internationally, in July 2008, &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; was released on DVD in widescreen in Germany, Spain, and the Benelux countries. A widescreen DVD was released for the first time in North America on November 1, 2016 via the Warner Archive Collection. The original widescreen presentation is also available digitally for rental or purchase through Google Play and also through Amazon Video. The film was officially released on Blu-ray via the Warner Archive Collection on September 26, 2023.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; became a casualty of the merger between Turner and Time Warner. It received a traditional theatrical release on March 26, 1997, but without fanfare and did not draw an audience. The film grossed $3.5 million in the United States and Canada against its $32 million production budget. Dindal and Kirschner told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that they were both frustrated with Warner Bros. over the lack of advertising and the failed marketing campaign.

=== Critical reaction ===
&quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; received a 71% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;, but they should easily entertain all-ages audiences thanks to some colorful animation, sharp humor, and a catchy soundtrack&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Decked out with sharp and colorful design work, some well-drawn characters and six snappy Randy Newman tunes, this first entry from Turner Feature Animation goes down very easily but lacks a hook&quot;. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four. He wrote the film &quot;is not compelling and it&#x27;s not a breakthrough, but on its own terms, it works well. Whether this will appeal to kids is debatable; the story involves a time and a subject they&#x27;re not much interested in. But the songs by Randy Newman are catchy, the look is bright, the spirits are high and fans of Hollywood&#x27;s golden age might find it engaging&quot;. John Petrakis, reviewing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, noted &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; would appeal more for adults than children, but provided a good moral lesson on prejudice. He further wrote the film has &quot;the sharp irreverence of the brilliant &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. There are plenty of clever asides and witty one-liners, not to mention a few terrific supporting characters&quot;.

Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; summarized in his review: &quot;While the animated characters, bright colors and an appealing Randy Newman score may keep the children content, &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot; is no saccharine fantasy. Its Hollywood references and dark satire constitute its real strengths&quot;. Jack Mathews, reviewing for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, described the film as a &quot;startling miscalculation&quot;. He next wrote: &quot;It has lots of cute animals, some jaunty Randy Newman songs and solid, if uninspired, animation work. But blending parody and nostalgia about an era half a century removed from the lives of the core audience seems a foolish indulgence&quot;. Rita Kempley of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote the film was &quot;colorful, but unimaginatively drawn&quot;. Also from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Jane Horwitz felt children &quot;won&#x27;t get the references to old movies or stars like Bette Davis and Clark Gable. Still, the action (however confusing), the music and the characters should hold even toddlers for a while&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
Despite mostly positive reception, the Stinkers filed the film under the Founders Award in 1997 (which lamented the year&#x27;s biggest studio disgraces), citing it as &quot;loud, unfunny, and completely over the heads of its intended audience&quot;. On the other hand, when it comes to positive accolades, although failing in gathering any Oscar nominations, it became historically the first non-Disney animated film to win the Best Animated Feature at the Annie Awards.

<doc id="668627" wikidata="Q183347" url="?curid=668627" title="Lloyd Kaufman">
<text>Stanley Lloyd Kaufman Jr. (born December 30, 1945) is an American film director, screenwriter, producer and actor. Alongside producer Michael Herz, he is the co-founder of Troma Entertainment film studio, and the director of many of their feature films, such as &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; (1984) and &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot; (1996). Many of the strategies employed by him at Troma have been credited with making the film industry significantly more accessible and decentralized.

==Early life==
Kaufman was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Ruth (&quot;née&quot; Fried) and Stanley Lloyd Kaufman Sr., a lawyer.

==Career==
===Early career===

Kaufman graduated from Yale University with the class of 1968, where he majored in Chinese studies. His fellow Yale classmates included Oliver Stone and George W. Bush. Originally intending to become a social worker, he became fast friends with student filmmaker Robert Edelstein and Eric Sherman (son of filmmaker Vincent Sherman), who introduced him to his future lifelong obsession, cinema. Some of Lloyd&#x27;s favorite filmmakers include John Ford, Kenji Mizoguchi, Ernst Lubitsch, Stan Brakhage and Franklin Schaffner.

In 1966, Lloyd went on a hiatus from his studies and spent a year in Chad for USAID as a pathfinder for the Peace Corps.

Returning to Yale, he produced Robert Edelstein&#x27;s low-budget film &quot;Rappaccini&quot; and directed his own first feature film, an experimental black and white film titled &quot;The Girl Who Returned&quot; (1969). The film was presented at film societies at Yale, Harvard, and other east coast institutions. Following his graduation, Kaufman went on to work for Cannon Films, where he met John G. Avildsen (future Academy Award-winning director of &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;). The two collaborated for several years, making low-budget films including &quot;Joe&quot; (1970) and &quot;Cry Uncle!&quot; (1971). During this period, Kaufman also directed and starred in his second feature film, &quot;The Battle of Love&#x27;s Return&quot; (1971), which garnered positive reviews in publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;; wrote and co-produced the lesbian thriller &quot;Sugar Cookies&quot; (1973) with Oliver Stone; and wrote and directed the Israeli comedy flop &quot;Big Gus, What&#x27;s the Fuss?&quot; (1973). Kaufman also served as executive in charge of locations for &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977), and was influential in choosing 2001 Odyssey as the nightclub in the film.

From 1973 to 1979, Kaufman produced and directed a handful of adult films in New York under the pseudonym &quot;Louis Su&quot;. He directed at least three movies: &quot;The Divine Obsession&quot;, &quot;The Newcomers&quot; and &quot;Sweet &amp; Sour&quot;, and has been credited for producing at least three more.

===Troma Studios===
In 1974, Kaufman and his business partner Michael Herz founded Troma Entertainment and began producing and distributing independent action and comedy films. In order to pay the bills, Kaufman did some freelance work for major Hollywood productions, including &quot;Rocky&quot; (edited on Troma&#x27;s flatbed machines), &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, and &quot;The Final Countdown&quot;, which he also produced (Kaufman has said that it was his experience on this film that made him never want to deal with a major studio again). From 1979 to 1981, the two wrote, produced and directed a series of profitable &quot;sexy comedies&quot; including &quot;Squeeze Play!&quot;, &quot;Waitress!&quot;, &quot;Stuck on You!&quot; and &quot;The First Turn-On!&quot;. On most of these early films, Kaufman is credited as &quot;Samuel Weil.&quot; Kaufman also made a small appearance in &quot;Rocky&quot; and served as the production manager on Louis Malle&#x27;s &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;.

In 1985, Troma experienced mainstream success with the violent, darkly comic superhero film &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot;. &quot;Toxic&quot; went on to become Troma&#x27;s most popular movie, inspiring two sequels, a fourth independent film sequel, a Saturday morning children&#x27;s television show, comic books and tons of merchandise. The Toxic Avenger, or &quot;Toxie&quot;, is now Troma&#x27;s official mascot.

Kaufman&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; was &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot;, which he co-directed with Richard W. Haines. Riding on the success of the &quot;Toxic Avenger&quot;, &quot;Nuke &#x27;Em&quot; inspired two sequels, a fourth independent film sequel, and a healthy run on late night cable shows such as &quot;USA Up All Night&quot;. At one time, &quot;Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High&quot; was the highest-selling VHS for Troma.

Troma&#x27;s popularity waned after the box office failure of &quot;Troma&#x27;s War&quot;, a contributing factor to the company&#x27;s collapse as a major film studio, forcing the Kaufman to eventually downsize his business into an independent film studio. Kaufman attributed the film&#x27;s lack of success to cuts made to the movie after the MPAA refused to release it with an R-rating in its intended form. Troma&#x27;s attempt to regain its popularity with the superhero satire &quot;Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D.&quot; was unsuccessful, failing to make an impression at the box office. From 1995 to 2000, Kaufman retrofitted the studio into an independent film company, finding success amongst cult movie fans and critics with the independent film &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot; (1996), a loose parody of Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Other independent films that followed were the less successful and poorly reviewed. &quot;Terror Firmer&quot; (1999), a slasher film set on the set of a Troma movie (with Kaufman playing a caricature of himself), and the fourth installment, &quot;Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV&quot;, which proved to be an ultimately unsuccessful revival of the series, both films failing to make an impression at the box office.

It would not be long, however, before Troma would once again experience financial hardship, this time after the expensive botched funding of a low-budget video feature titled &quot;Tales from the Crapper&quot;, which cost $250,000 despite most of the footage being unusable. Lloyd supervised a reshoot in an attempt to salvage the film, dividing the footage into two parts, and recasting the film as a double-feature. &quot;Tales from the Crapper&quot; was released on DVD in September 2004.

Troma still produces and acquires independent films. Troma Films has distributed many films from third parties including Trey Parker&#x27;s &quot;Cannibal! The Musical&quot;. Lloyd himself encourages independent filmmaking, making cameo appearances in low-budget horror films, often for free. Appearances include screen time in former collaborator James Gunn&#x27;s directing debut, &quot;Slither&quot;, as well as Gunn&#x27;s &quot;Super&quot;; and Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Gamer&quot;.

Kaufman&#x27;s long-time editor Gabriel Friedman co-directed and wrote the screenplay to his follow-up film, &quot;&quot;, a musical zom-com which made its official New York premiere on May 9, 2008 (although the film had previewed numerous times on single screens for over a year). The film opened to positive reviews from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Poultrygeist&quot; grossed $22,623 in the United States and Canada.

In September 2008, a staged musical version of &quot;The Toxic Avenger&quot; opened at the George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Directed by Tony Award winner John Rando, &quot;The Toxic Avenger Musical&quot; features music from Bon Jovi founding member, David Bryan. On September 17, 2009, Kaufman announced he would have a cameo in the remake of the Charles Kaufman/Troma movie &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; alongside his brother Charles.

Kaufman is the subject of the book &quot;Toxic Schlock: Conversations with Lloyd Kaufman&quot; by Andrew J. Rausch and Chris Watson. An author himself, Kaufman has most recently been working on adding to his &quot;Your Own Damn Movie!&quot; series. Having completed &quot;Make Your Own Damn Movie!&quot;, &quot;Direct Your Own Damn Movie!&quot; and &quot;Produce Your Own Damn Movie!&quot;, he is now working on &quot;Sell Your Own Damn Movie!&quot;. Kaufman is the subject of the book &quot;Lloyd Kaufman: Interviews&quot; by Mathew Klickstein, an installment of the University Press of Mississippi&#x27;s long-running Conversations with Filmmakers Series.

In 2010, Troma produced &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;, a shocking film from Canadian powerhouse Astron-6. Kaufman appeared on the Discovery Channel series, &quot;Oddities&quot;, on season 3 episode ten.

In 2012, Kaufman starred in the anthology horror film &quot;Horror House&quot;, playing Joe the Real Estate Agent in each of the film&#x27;s five story scenarios.

On April 30, 2013, Kaufman appeared on an episode of &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd&quot;, reviewing the video game &quot;Toxic Crusaders&quot; on various consoles. Kaufman also appears in &quot;Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie&quot; as himself, and was interviewed by James Rolfe.

In December 2013, Lloyd Kaufman revealed on the podcast Chimichanga Talk that he found lost behind-the-scenes footage of the film &quot;Rocky&quot;. Kaufman directed this footage and it was shot on Super-8. He also stated that he has completed a commentary of the footage and that it will be included in the 40th Anniversary release of &quot;Rocky&quot; on Blu-ray and DVD.

In 2013, Troma premiered &quot;Return to Class of Nuke &#x27;Em High Vol.1&quot; (2013) at the Cannes Film Festival. &quot;Return to Nuke &#x27;Em High: Vol. 1&quot; was a collaboration between Troma and Starz/Anchor Bay, it is also the first film Kaufman has directed on digital. The film has been well received premiering all over the world picking up awards and critical praise along the way. &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated &quot;Powered by ribald bursts of bad taste and bodily fluids... The overall effect is [sic] joyous.&quot; Fangoria said &quot;&quot;Return to Nuke &#x27;Em High: Vol. 1&quot; is undeniably funny, brave and so unlike anything else being put out today that it practically demands respect.&quot;

The Museum of Modern Art selected &quot;Return to Nuke &#x27;Em High: Vol. 1&quot; as part of its prestigious &quot;Contenders&quot; series - a collection of influential, innovative films made in the past 12 months that are believed will stand the test of time - honoring Kaufman along with fellow directors David Lynch, Woody Allen, the Coen Brothers, and Sofia Coppola.

In 2020, Kaufman released &quot;#ShakespearesSh*tstorm&quot;, his iteration of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot;, a spiritual sequel to &quot;Tromeo and Juliet&quot;.

In 2021, Kaufman served as producer on the Troma films, Brandon Bassham&#x27;s Slashening: The Final Beginning &amp; Mercedes The Muses&#x27;s Divide &amp; Conquer.

<text>Window coverings are considered any type of materials used to cover a window to manage sunlight, privacy, additional weatherproofing or for purely decorative purposes.

== Description and design ==
Window coverings comprise materials used to cover a window to manage sunlight, privacy, additional weatherproofing or for purely decorative purposes. Window coverings are typically used on the interior side of windows, but exterior solutions are also available.

Window coverings may be used to manage overheating and glare issues due to sunlight. Designers may consider these variables in the context of visual comfort indices, which include light quantity (sufficient light to perform tasks), direct sunlight (which may lead to overheating), light uniformity (light distribution over the task plane), and glare. Window coverings can provide a sense of privacy. It is important to consider both privacy in terms of the view from the outside in and from the inside out. Poor privacy is often caused when windows are located on the ground floor, or face nearby neighboring high-rise buildings. Nonetheless, if occupants are not satisfied with the privacy the window provides, window coverings will be used to avoid it. Window coverings can also be applied temporarily to protect windows in storm conditions (such as hurricane shutters) or for extra thermal performance in winter to protect against heat loss through windows (such as insulated blinds or window inserts). Window coverings may be selected by building usage and occupant activity in the room. The amount of daylight needed in the room will differ depending on room type. For information on daylighting metrics that may be affected by window covering use, please reference the daylighting page. Aesthetic qualities of window coverings should also be considered, such as how the color, material, and style match the rest of the interior space.

Window coverings can also affect view quality through the windows. View quality can be expressed through three main variables: content (what an occupant sees), access (how much view can be seen from the occupant&#x27;s position), and clarity (how clearly an occupant can see the content). Partially closing curtains or pulling shades down part-way would affect view quality by limiting view access. Using small aperture shades such as fabric roller shades would primarily affect view quality through a change in view clarity. View clarity can be assessed by visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and color perception. The color, as well as aperture size, known as Openness Factor, or OF, are two variables of fabric shades that can change view clarity perception. Darker fabric shades with larger openness factors generally achieve higher view clarity.

The impact of window coverings on view quality is of interest for designers, manufacturers, and researchers. However, there is limited research available on the topic of view quality, “due to its complex nature, insufficient funding, and a lack of coordinated effort to move the field forward.”

== Types ==
Types of coverings include:
*Curtains and drapes
*Window blinds, including:
**Venetian blinds: Natural wood, Faux wood, Vinyl, Aluminum
**Vertical blinds
**Mini blinds: Vinyl, Aluminum, Micro blinds
*Window shutters, including:
**traditional Colonial style &amp; plantation shutters with larger louver sizes
*Window shades, including:
**Roman shades
**Roller shades
**Pleated shades
**Sheer shades
**Cellular shades
*Solar screens
*Various types of boarding, nailed or screwed to the window casing, can be used as temporary window covering.

=== Dynamic window coverings ===
Window coverings can be static or dynamic. Static window coverings are fixed in place while dynamic window coverings can change their status manually or automatically. Dynamic window coverings can control daylight and solar energy entering the building. Dynamic window coverings are effective in adapting to changing outdoor and indoor conditions. Optimal control of window coverings can increase occupant comfort (visual and thermal comfort) while saving building energy use (lighting, cooling, and heating energy). Typical dynamic window coverings include automated blinds and automatic shades.

Window blinds and shades can be controlled to avoid glare while introducing daylight to the building. The height of the blind and the angle of the slat can be determined by daylighting demand and solar positions (azimuth, altitude). By controlling the height of shades or blinds, the optimal amount of sunlight can be introduced to meet the target horizontal illuminance (work plane illuminance). The optimal angle of the blind slats can protect occupants from direct sunlight (cut-off angle strategy). Glare can also be controlled by glare index-based models, such as discomfort glare probability (DGP).

Window coverings can be controlled to minimize overheating. When the sunlight is strong, fully closed window coverings can decrease the cooling load while maintaining occupants’ thermal comfort. When the outdoor temperature is extremely low, fully closed drapes or curtains can reduce the heating load.

Control of window coverings can also be determined by occupants’ personal preferences. The occupant may prefer to close the window coverings due to privacy issues. Indoor conditions, such as furniture configuration or occupant position, may also affect the shade or blind control.

Dynamic window coverings are important in the area of building automation.

==Alternatives==
*Smart glass is used with high-rise buildings.
*Window film can be applied to tint glass.

<doc id="668634" wikidata="Q419383" url="?curid=668634" title="Desflurane">
<text>Desflurane (1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) is a highly fluorinated methyl ethyl ether used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Like halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane, it is a racemic mixture of (&quot;R&quot;) and (&quot;S&quot;) optical isomers (enantiomers). Together with sevoflurane, it is gradually replacing isoflurane for human use, except in economically undeveloped areas, where its high cost precludes its use. It has the most rapid onset and offset of the volatile anesthetic drugs used for general anesthesia due to its low solubility in blood.

Some drawbacks of desflurane are its low potency, its pungency and its high cost (though at low flow fresh gas rates, the cost difference between desflurane and isoflurane appears to be insignificant). It may cause tachycardia and airway irritability when administered at concentrations greater than 10% by volume. Due to this airway irritability, desflurane is infrequently used to induce anesthesia via inhalation techniques.

Though it vaporizes very readily, it is a liquid at room temperature. Anaesthetic machines are fitted with a specialized anaesthetic vaporiser unit that heats liquid desflurane to a constant temperature. This enables the agent to be available at a constant vapor pressure, negating the effects fluctuating ambient temperatures would otherwise have on its concentration imparted into the fresh gas flow of the anesthesia machine.

Desflurane, along with enflurane and to a lesser extent isoflurane, has been shown to react with the carbon dioxide absorbent in anesthesia circuits to produce detectable levels of carbon monoxide through degradation of the anesthetic agent. The absorbent Baralyme, when dried, is most culpable for the production of carbon monoxide from desflurane degradation, although it is also seen with soda lime absorbent as well. Dry conditions in the carbon dioxide absorbent are conducive to this phenomenon, such as those resulting from high fresh gas flows.

==Pharmacology==
 the exact mechanism of the action of general anaesthetics has not been delineated. Desflurane is known to act as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA and glycine receptors, and as a negative allosteric modulator of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, as well as affecting other ligand-gated ion channels.

== Stereochemistry ==

Desflurane medications are a racemate of two enantiomers.
==Physical properties==
==Physiologic effects==
Desflurane induces a dose dependent reduction in blood pressure due to reduced systemic vascular resistance. However, rapid increases in desflurane may induce a transient sympathetic response secondary to catecholamine release. Even though it is highly pungent, it is still a bronchodilator. It reduces the ventilatory response to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Like sevoflurane, desflurane vasodilatory properties also cause it to increase intracranial pressure and cerebral blood flow. However, it reduces cerebral metabolic rate. It also promotes muscle relaxation and potentiate neuromuscular blockade at a greater level than sevoflurane. 
==Contraindications==
It is contraindicated for induction of general anesthesia in the non-intubated pediatric population due to the high risk of laryngospasm. It should not be used in patients with known or suspected susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia. It is also contraindicated in patients with elevated intracranial pressure. 

==Global-warming potential==
Desflurane is a greenhouse gas. The twenty-year global-warming potential, GWP(20), for desflurane is 3714, meaning that one tonne of desflurane emitted is equivalent to 3714 tonnes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, much higher than sevoflurane or isoflurane. In addition to global warming potentials, drug potency and fresh gas flow rates must be considered for meaningful comparisons between anesthetic gases. When a steady state hourly amount of anesthetic necessary for 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) at 2 liters per minute (LPM) for Sevoflurane, and 1 LPM for Desflurane and Isoflurane is weighted by the GWP, the clinically relevant quantities of each anesthetic can then be compared. On a per-MAC-hour basis, the total life cycle GHG impact of desflurane is more than 20 times higher than Isoflurane and Sevoflurane (1 minimal alveolar concentration-hour). One paper finds anesthesia gases used globally contribute the equivalent of 1 million cars to global warming. This estimate is commonly cited as a reason to neglect pollution prevention by anesthesiologists. However, this is problematic. This estimate is extrapolated from only one U.S. institution&#x27;s anesthetic practices, and this institution uses virtually no Desflurane. Researchers neglected to include nitrous oxide in their calculations, and reported an erroneous average of 17 kg CO2e per anesthetic. However, institutions that utilize some Desflurane and account for nitrous oxide have reported an average of 175–220 kg CO2e per anesthetic. Sulbaek-Anderson&#x27;s group therefore likely underestimated the total worldwide contribution of inhaled anesthetics, and yet still advocates for inhaled anesthetic emissions prevention.

In March 2023, Scotland became the first country to ban its use due to its environmental impact.

<text>DSRFLOW, the Flow-State extensions to Dynamic Source Routing (DSR), are a set of extensions that provide all of the benefits of source routing, without most of the per-packet overhead that is associated with source routing. It works by allowing most packets to be sent without a source route header, thus substantially reducing overhead. Indeed, one of the disadvantages of DSR was that the longer the source route of the packet was, the bigger the packet header became. The technique used is called implicit source routing. Flow state extensions to DSR were first described in &quot;Implicit Source Routes for On-Demand Ad Hoc Network Routing&quot; by Yih-Chun Hu and David B. Johnson (2001).

The implicit source routing mechanism is now included in the DSR Internet Draft.

The main idea of DSRFLOW is to introduce a so-called &quot;flow table&quot; for each network node and thus making DSRFLOW a stateful routing protocol. For each &quot;flow&quot; a node forwards there is one entry in the flow table which minimally must record the next hop address.

<text>A German Requiem, to Words of the Holy Scriptures, Op. 45 () by Johannes Brahms, is a large-scale work for chorus, orchestra, and soprano and baritone soloists, composed between 1865 and 1868. It comprises seven movements, which together last 65 to 80 minutes, making this work both Brahms&#x27;s longest composition and largest ensemble-work. &quot;A German Requiem&quot; is sacred but non-liturgical, and unlike a long tradition of the Latin Requiem, &quot;A German Requiem&quot;, as its title states, is a &quot;Requiem&quot; in the German language.

==History==

Brahms&#x27;s mother died in February 1865, a loss that caused him much grief and may well have inspired &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot;. Brahms&#x27;s lingering feelings over Robert Schumann&#x27;s death in July 1856 may also have been a motivation, though his reticence about such matters makes this uncertain.

His original conception was for a work of six movements; according to their eventual places in the final version, these were movements I–IV and VI–VII. By the end of April 1865, Brahms had completed the first, second, and fourth movements. The second movement used some previously abandoned musical material written in 1854, the year of Schumann&#x27;s mental collapse and attempted suicide, and of Brahms&#x27;s move to Düsseldorf to assist Clara Schumann and her young children.

Brahms completed all but what is now the fifth movement by August 1866. Johann Herbeck conducted the first three movements in Vienna on 1 December 1867. This partial premiere went poorly due to a misunderstanding in the timpanist&#x27;s score. Sections marked as (loud, then soft) were played as (loud) or (very loud), essentially drowning out the rest of the ensemble in the fugal section of the third movement. The first performance of the six movements premiered in the Bremen Cathedral six months later on Good Friday, 10 April 1868, with Brahms conducting and Julius Stockhausen as the baritone soloist. The performance was a great success and marked a turning point in Brahms&#x27;s career.

In May 1868 Brahms composed an additional movement, which became the fifth movement within the final work. The new movement, which was scored for soprano soloist and choir, was first sung in Zürich on 12 September 1868 by Ida Suter-Weber, with Friedrich Hegar conducting the Tonhalle Orchester Zürich. The final, seven-movement version of &quot;A German Requiem&quot; was premiered in Leipzig on 18 February 1869 with Carl Reinecke conducting the Gewandhaus Orchestra and Chorus, and soloists Emilie Bellingrath-Wagner and Franz Krückl.

==Text==
Brahms assembled the libretto himself. In contrast to the traditional Roman Catholic Requiem Mass, which employs a standardized text in Latin, the text is derived from the German Luther Bible.

Brahms&#x27;s first known use of the title &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot; was in an 1865 letter to Clara Schumann in which he wrote that he intended the piece to be &quot;&quot;eine Art deutsches Requiem&quot; (a sort of German Requiem). Brahms was quite moved when he found out years later that Robert Schumann had planned a work of the same name. &quot;German&quot; refers primarily to the language rather than the intended audience. Brahms told Carl Martin Reinthaler, director of music at the Bremen Cathedral, that he would have gladly called the work &quot;Ein menschliches Requiem&quot;&quot; (A human Requiem).

Although the Requiem Mass in the Roman Catholic liturgy begins with prayers for the dead (&quot;Grant them eternal rest, O Lord&quot;), &quot;A German Requiem&quot; focuses on the living, beginning with the text &quot;Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.&quot; from the Beatitudes. This theme—transition from anxiety to comfort—recurs in all the following movements except movements IV and VII, the central one and the final one. Although the idea of the Lord is the source of the comfort, the sympathetic humanism persists through the work.

Brahms purposely omitted Christian dogma. In his correspondence with Carl Reinthaler, when Reinthaler expressed concern over this, Brahms refused to add references to &quot;the redeeming death of the Lord&quot;, as Reinthaler described it, such as John 3:16. In the Bremen performance of the piece, Reinthaler took the liberty of inserting the aria &quot;I know that my Redeemer liveth&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot; to satisfy the clergy.

==Instrumentation==
In addition to soprano and baritone soloists and mixed chorus, &quot;A German Requiem&quot; is scored for:

*woodwind: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons and contrabassoon (&quot;ad libitum&quot;)
*brass: 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba
*percussion: timpani
*strings and harp (one part, preferably doubled)
*organ (&quot;ad libitum&quot;)

==Structure==
Since Brahms inserted the fifth movement, the work shows symmetry around the fourth movement, which describes the &quot;lovely dwellings&quot; of the Lord. Movements I and VII begin &quot;&quot;Selig sind&quot; (Blessed are), taken from the Beatitudes of the Sermon on the Mount in I, from Revelation in VII. These two slow movements also share musical elements, especially in their ending. Movements II and VI are both dramatic, II dealing with the transient nature of life, VI with the resurrection of the dead, told as a secret about a change. Movements III and V are begun by a solo voice. In the third movement, the baritone requests &quot;Herr, lehre doch mich&quot;&quot; (&quot;Lord, teach me&quot;); the choir repeats his words several times, making the personal prayer more general. In the fifth movement, the soprano and chorus sing different text, corresponding to each other. As opposed to Baroque oratorios, the soloists do not sing any arias, but are part of the structure of the movements. Almost all movements, with the exception of IV and VII, connect different Bible verses, which lead from suffering and mourning to consolation. The last word of the work is the same as the first: &quot;selig&quot; (blessed).

===Movements===

The following table is organized first by movement, then within a movement by Bible quotation (where appropriate), which generally also causes a change in mood, expressed by tempo, key and orchestration. The title of each movement is bolded. The choir is in four parts, with the exception of a few chords. The choir is not especially mentioned in the table because it is present throughout the work. The translation is close to the original. Links to the King James Version of the Bible are supplied. Brahms marked some sections in German for tempo and character, trying to be more precise than the common Italian tempo markings.
==Composition==

Notable orchestration devices include the first movement&#x27;s lack of violins, the use of a piccolo, clarinets, one pair of horns, trumpets, a tuba, and timpani throughout the work, as well as the use of harps at the close of both the first and seventh movements, most striking in the latter because at that point they have not played since the middle of the second movement.

&quot;A German Requiem&quot; is unified compositionally by a three-note motif of a leap of a major third, usually followed by a half-step in the same direction. The first exposed choral entry presents the motif in the soprano voice (F–A–B). This motif pervades every movement and much of the thematic material in the piece.

==Critical reception==

Most critics have commented on the high level of craftsmanship displayed in the work, and have appreciated its quasi-Classical structures (e.g. the second, third, and sixth movements have fugues at their climax). But not all critics responded favourably to the work. George Bernard Shaw, an avowed Wagnerite, wrote that &quot;it could only have come from the establishment of a first-class undertaker.&quot; Some commentators have also been puzzled by its lack of overt Christian content, though it seems clear that for Brahms this was a humanist rather than a Christian work.

==Versions and arrangements==
In 1866 Brahms made an arrangement for piano solo of the six-movement version of the Requiem, which he revealed to Clara Schumann at Christmas of that year.

Brahms prepared an alternative version of the full seven-movement work to be performed with piano duet accompaniment, making it an acceptable substitute accompaniment for choir and soloists in circumstances where a full orchestra is unavailable. The vocal parts can also be omitted, suggesting that it was also intended as a self-contained version probably for at-home use. The alternative version was used, sung in English, for the first complete British performance of the Requiem on 10 July 1871 at 35 Wimpole Street, London, the home of Sir Henry Thompson and his wife, the pianist Kate Loder (Lady Thompson). The pianists were Kate Loder and Cipriani Potter. This piano-duet accompaniment version of the Requiem has become known as the &quot;London Version&quot; ().

An arrangement of the first movement for concert band by Barbara Buehlman, under the title &quot;Blessed Are They&quot;, has been a standard part of that ensemble&#x27;s literature for many years.

==Notable recordings==
==In other works==
&quot;A German Requiem&quot; inspired the titles of Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; 1949 short story &quot;Deutsches Requiem&quot; and Philip Kerr&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;A German Requiem&quot;.

The start of the piece&#x27;s second movement, &quot;Denn alles Fleisch, es ist wie Gras&quot; (&quot;For all flesh, is as grass&quot;), is used in the opening credits of the BBC documentary film series &quot;The Nazis: A Warning from History&quot;, with various sections of this part of the movement being used for the closing credits.

<text>Urinetown: The Musical is a satirical comedy musical that premiered in 2001, with music by Mark Hollmann, lyrics by Hollmann and Greg Kotis, and book by Kotis. It satirizes the legal system, capitalism, social irresponsibility, populism, bureaucracy, corporate mismanagement, and municipal politics. The show also parodies musicals such as &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot; and &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, and the Broadway musical itself as a form.

==Productions==
&quot;Urinetown&quot; debuted at the New York International Fringe Festival, and then was produced Off-Broadway at the American Theatre for Actors from May 6, 2001, to June 25, 2001. The musical then opened on Broadway at Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre, running from September 20, 2001, through January 18, 2004, totaling 25 previews and 965 performances. It was nominated for 10 Tony Awards and won three.

It was directed by John Rando and featured music and lyrics by Mark Hollman, book and lyrics by Greg Kotis, and choreography by John Carrafa. The original cast included Hunter Foster (as Bobby Strong, later replaced by Tom Cavanagh), Jeff McCarthy (as Officer Lockstock), Nancy Opel (as Penelope Pennywise), John Cullum (as Caldwell B. Cladwell), Jennifer Laura Thompson (as Hope Cladwell), Spencer Kayden (as Little Sally), John Deyle (as Senator Fipp), and Ken Jennings (as Old Man Strong/Hot Blades Harry). Principal cast changes included James Barbour as Officer Lockstock, Carolee Carmello and Victoria Clark as Penelope Pennywise and Charles Shaughnessy as Caldwell B. Cladwell as well as Amy Spanger as Hope Cladwell.

A national tour starring Christiane Noll and Tom Hewitt began in San Francisco, California, on June 13, 2003. A production began performances at Chicago&#x27;s Mercury Theater in March 2006 and closed in May 2006, followed by New Line Theatre in St. Louis in 2007.

The characters of Officer Lockstock and Little Sally are featured in what has become a yearly tradition at the Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS annual Gypsy of the Year benefit concert, in which the characters – portrayed by actors Jennifer Cody and Don Richard, both of whom understudied the roles in the original cast – perform a short comedy sketch making fun of current Broadway shows.

An Australian production directed by Simon Phillips for the Melbourne Theatre Company was staged at the Playhouse in April–May 2004. The cast featured Kane Alexander (Bobby Strong), Shane Bourne (Officer Lockstock), Lisa McCune (Hope Cladwell), Rhonda Burchmore (Penelope Pennywise) and Gerry Connolly (Caldwell B. Cladwell). The production transferred to Sydney for the Sydney Theatre Company at the Sydney Theatre in June–July 2006. The Sydney season retained the principal cast from Melbourne, with the exception of David Campbell taking over the role of Bobby.

The UK premiere directed by Jamie Lloyd opened at London&#x27;s St. James Theatre in April 2014, transferred to the Apollo Theatre in September 2014, and ended its run on 3 January 2015.

In 2015, a production of the show opened in São Paulo, Brazil, at the Teatro do Nucleo Experimental. In 2019, Urinetown opened in Singapore, produced by Pangdemonium Theatre Company. 

In 2019, the first Danish production of Urinetown opened at Fredericia Teater. 

In 2023, the Turkish production of Urinetown opened at the Zorlu Performance Arts Center, and is still continuing performances.

In 2024, another Danish production opened March 22 at Østre Gasværk Teater, Copenhagen, notably starring Kurt Ravn as Caldwell B. Cladwell.

In February 2025, the show was revived as a part of New York City Center&#x27;s Encores! series. The production featured Jordan Fisher as Bobby, Christopher Fitzgerald as Barrel, Greg Hildreth as Lockstock, Keala Settle as Pennywise, Stephanie Styles as Hope, and Rainn Wilson as Cladwell. Taran Killam had originally been cast as Lockstock but had to drop out of the show due to his Pacific Palisades home burning down during the January 2025 Southern California wildfires. 

==History==
Greg Kotis had the idea for &quot;Urinetown&quot; while traveling in Europe. A traveling student on a budget, he encountered a pay toilet and began writing shortly thereafter, joining with Mark Hollmann for the journey to Broadway. Initially, no production companies were interested in optioning the musical, but finally the Neo-Futurists, an experimental theatre group from Chicago, agreed to produce &quot;Urinetown&quot; for their 1999–2000 season. Kotis, his wife, and original cast member Spencer Kayden belonged to the group. Plans with the Neo-Futurists later fell through, so John Clancy of the New York Fringe Festival accepted the show into the festival. Playwright David Auburn, a friend of Kotis and Hollmann, came to see the show and immediately called the production company The Araca Group. The company optioned the musical, and it opened off-Broadway at the American Theatre for Actors, transferring to Broadway in September 2001. Originally planned to open on September 13, the show contained several references which, after the September 11 attacks, would prove offensive. Ultimately, only one line was removed from the script, and the show opened September 20, 2001.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Officer Lockstock, a policeman, grimly welcomes the audience, assisted by the street urchin Little Sally. According to the pair, a twenty-year drought has caused a terrible water shortage, making private toilets unthinkable. All restroom activities are done in public toilets controlled by a megacorporation called &quot;Urine Good Company&quot; (or UGC). To control water consumption, people have to pay to use the amenities (&quot;Too Much Exposition&quot;). There are harsh laws ensuring that people pay to urinate, and if the laws are broken, the offender is sent to a place called &quot;Urinetown,&quot; never to return.

The oppressed masses huddle in line at the poorest, filthiest urinal in town, Public Amenity #9, which is run by the rigid, harshly authoritarian Penelope Pennywise and her assistant, dashing young everyman Bobby Strong. Trouble ensues when Bobby&#x27;s father Joseph &quot;Old Man&quot; Strong, unable to afford his daily urinal admission, asks Pennywise to let him go free &quot;just this once.&quot; After Old Man Strong&#x27;s plea is dismissed (&quot;It&#x27;s a Privilege to Pee&quot;), he urinates on the street, and Officers Lockstock and Barrel soon arrest him and escort him off to Urinetown (&quot;It&#x27;s a Privilege to Pee (Reprise)&quot;).

Later that day, in the corporate offices of Urine Good Company, CEO Caldwell B. Cladwell is discussing the new fee hikes with Senator Fipp, a politician firmly in Cladwell&#x27;s pocket, when Cladwell&#x27;s beautiful daughter, Hope Cladwell, arrives as the UGC&#x27;s new fax/copy girl. As an introduction, the UGC staff sing a song praising their leader (&quot;Mr. Cladwell&quot;).

Officers Lockstock and Barrel discuss the journey to Urinetown and how it reduces everyone, even the toughest, to screams (&quot;The Cop Song&quot;). Hope enters and encounters Bobby Strong. Bobby, distraught over his father&#x27;s arrest and wondering if he could have done something, tells Hope that his heart feels either cold or empty. Hope tells Bobby that the only answer is to follow his heart. The two realize that they both want a new world where people can be happy and pee for free. United by their belief, they fall in love (&quot;Follow Your Heart&quot;). Little Sally asks Officer Lockstock what Urinetown is like, but Lockstock replies that its power lies in its mystery and he cannot flippantly reveal that &quot;there is no Urinetown, we just kill people&quot;, and that the reveal will not come until Act II, &quot;with everybody singing and things like that.&quot;

The next day, Cladwell&#x27;s assistant, Mr. McQueen, announces the new fee hikes set upon the urinals. Bobby concludes that the laws are wrong. Opening the doors of the urinal, despite Ms. Pennywise&#x27;s protests, he begins a pee-for-free rebellion (&quot;Look at the Sky&quot;).

Pennywise rushes to the offices of UGC, where she informs Cladwell of the revolution. The two give each other long, meaningful looks, but they are interrupted by the situation at hand. Cladwell vows to crush the rebellion, frightening Hope, then uses a series of increasingly convoluted metaphors involving killing a bunny to tell Hope that their privilege and responsibility is to stomp on the poor (&quot;Don&#x27;t Be the Bunny&quot;).

Cladwell, McQueen, Fipp, Pennywise, Lockstock and Barrel arrive at Amenity #9 to snuff out the uprising. Learning that Hope is Cladwell&#x27;s daughter, Bobby realizes that the only way out of the trap is to kidnap Hope to use as leverage against Cladwell. The rebel poor escape with Hope as their hostage. The police give chase, but the slow-motion choreography makes it impossible for the police to catch them. Lockstock vows to catch the poor as he tells the audience to enjoy intermission (&quot;Act I Finale&quot;).

===Act II===
Lockstock welcomes everyone back, updates the audience on the situation, and tells them that the rebel poor are holed up in a secret hideout somewhere, gesturing to a large sign that reads &quot;Secret Hideout.&quot; The sign leads to the sewers, where the rebels are holding Hope hostage. The rebels wonder what Urinetown is, and two of them, Little Becky Two-Shoes and Hot Blades Harry, explain their theories. Cladwell orders Lockstock to search harder for the rebels, threatening to send everyone to Urinetown if Hope is not found. Bobby and his mother Josephine hand out memos to the other Assistant Custodians, hoping that they will join them. Bobby is sure that Urinetown is nothing but a lie designed to scare the poor people. Lockstock catches Little Sally, but his threat of Urinetown doesn&#x27;t work, because according to her, they are already there; it &quot;isn&#x27;t so much a place as it is a metaphysical place&quot; that they are all in, including Lockstock. She escapes before Lockstock can ask her what &quot;metaphysical&quot; means. (&quot;What is Urinetown?&quot;).

Convinced that Bobby, Josephine, and Little Sally have been captured, the rebels, particularly Hot Blades Harry and Little Becky Two-Shoes, decide that the best way to get revenge on Cladwell is to kill Hope (&quot;Snuff That Girl&quot;). They are about to kill her when Bobby bursts in and reminds the rebels that their purpose is more than just revenge. He explains that he made a promise to free all the people of the land. One of the rebels reminds Bobby that the only words he said were &quot;Run, everybody, run for your lives, run.&quot; Bobby explains that in the heat of battle the cry of freedom sounds something like (&quot;Run, Freedom, Run!&quot;). Invigorated, the poor rally around Bobby, but balk at his statement that the violent fight could take decades. Just then, Pennywise bursts into the secret hideout telling Bobby that Cladwell wants him to come to the UGC headquarters. Bobby goes, but only after the impatient rebels remind him that if anything happens to him, Hope will be killed. Pennywise fiercely swears that if any of the rebels harm Hope, she will have Bobby sent off to Urinetown. Bobby says goodbye to Hope, apologizes, and tells her to think of what they have (&quot;Follow Your Heart (Reprise)&quot;).

At the UGC headquarters, Bobby is offered a suitcase full of cash and full amnesty to the rebels as long as Hope is returned and the people agree to the new fee hikes. Bobby refuses, and demands free access for the people. Cladwell orders the cops to escort Bobby to Urinetown—even if it means that the rebel poor will kill Hope. Horrified, Pennywise marvels at the depth of Cladwell&#x27;s evil. Cladwell has her arrested as well. She, Hope, and Fipp sing of their regrets of falling for Cladwell&#x27;s schemes. Meanwhile, Bobby is led to the top of the UGC building, and learns the truth: Urinetown is death. He regrets having ever listened to his heart. Lockstock and Barrel throw him off the building (&quot;Why Did I Listen To That Man?&quot;), killing him.

Little Sally returns to the hideout in a shocked daze, having just heard Bobby&#x27;s last words. The ghost of Bobby sings, along with Little Sally, his last words, which are directed to Hope (&quot;Tell Her I Love Her&quot;). His last words encourage the rebels &quot;to fight for what they know is right,&quot; and that &quot;the time is always now.&quot; Just as the rebels are about to murder Hope in revenge, Pennywise enters and offers herself instead, proclaiming herself to be Hope&#x27;s mother. The poor reel back, shocked by this unexpected twist. Hope convinces the rebels to let her lead them, and she, Penny, and the poor march to the UGC offices. En route, they kill Officer Barrel (who had just confessed his love to Officer Lockstock), Senator Fipp, and Mrs. Millennium (&quot;We&#x27;re Not Sorry&quot;).

Hope reveals to her father that she is still alive. Cladwell is overjoyed, until the rest of the poor reveal themselves. Hope tells him that his reign of terror is over, and that he will &quot;be sent to the same place he sent Bobby and all those who wouldn&#x27;t—or couldn&#x27;t—meet his criminal fee hikes&quot;. Cladwell unsuccessfully pleads to the people that he is their only chance at seeing tomorrow. After he and Pennywise reminisce about their past romance (&quot;We&#x27;re Not Sorry (Reprise)&quot;), he is led to the roof, shouting that he regrets nothing, and however cruel he might have been, he &quot;kept the pee off the street and the water in the ground&quot;, before being thrown off.

With the town finally at peace, the age of fear is over and the people look forward to a bright new day. The Urine Good Company is renamed &quot;The Bobby Strong Memorial Toilet Authority&quot; and the people are henceforth allowed &quot;to pee whenever they like, as much as they like, for as long as they like, and with whomever they like&quot; (&quot;I See A River&quot;).

However, the town&#x27;s newfound urinary bliss is short-lived, as its limited water supply quickly disappears. Lockstock tells the audience that, as draconian as the UGC&#x27;s rules were, they kept the people from squandering the limited water supply; now, much of the population dies of thirst. It is insinuated that Hope suffers a terrible death and &quot;Joins her father&quot; at the hand of the people for her actions in depleting the water supply, but the remaining townsfolk will wage on, declaring that &quot;This [the town] is Urinetown! Always has been Urinetown!&quot; Some of the final words of the musical are &quot;Hail Malthus!&quot;

<text>The Shot Tower located in Dubuque, Iowa, is one of the last remaining shot towers in the United States. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and remains a recognized symbol of the city. The tower stands tall. At its location near the Mississippi River, the tower can be seen from the riverwalk. It underwent extensive renovations beginning in 2004.

==History==
The tower was built in 1856 to provide lead shot. The invention of the shot tower enabled economical production of many nearly perfect lead spheres of the right size to fit in a shot gun. To make the shot, molten lead was poured through a grate at the top of the tower. The droplets that fell from the grate were of relatively uniform size, and the fall provided enough time for the liquid-metal droplet to form into a sphere before landing in the water below. The water cooled the lead to its solid state, retaining the spherical shape.

The shot tower struggled almost immediately due to economic downturn from the Panic of 1857. A St. Louis company, Chadbourne &amp; Co., purchased the Dubuque tower, but did not use it. After the war, the Standard Lumber Company used it as a fire watchtower.

The tower was abandoned after a series of fires in 1911 destroyed the local lumber industry and damaged the tower&#x27;s wooden interior. The fire was determined to be arson, but no one was ever arrested. In 1976, the tower was listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Tuckpointing and repairs soon followed, and in 2004, the Shot Tower became part of ongoing riverfront renovations.

<text>William Dargan (28 February 1799 – 7 February 1867) was arguably the most important Irish engineer of the 19th century and certainly the most important figure in railway construction. Dargan designed and built Ireland&#x27;s first railway line from Dublin to Dún Laoghaire in 1833. In total he constructed over 1,300 km (800 miles) of railway to important urban centres of Ireland. He was a member of the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) and also helped establish the National Gallery of Ireland. He was also responsible for the Great Dublin Exhibition held at Leinster lawn in 1853. His achievements were honoured in 1995, when the Dargan Railway Bridge in Belfast was opened, and again in 2004 when the Dargan Bridge, Dublin a new cable stayed bridge for Dublin&#x27;s Light Railway Luas were both named after him.

==Biography==

Dargan was born on 28 February 1799, in rural Queen&#x27;s County (Laois) not far from Carlow town. He was the eldest in a large family of tenant farmers on the Earl of Portarlington&#x27;s estate. His father, possibly also called William, was a tenant farmer, and there is nothing known about his mother. It is thought that he attended a local hedge school in Graiguecullen Queen&#x27;s County, where he excelled in mathematics and accounting. He subsequently worked on his father&#x27;s 101-acre farm before securing a position in a surveyor&#x27;s office in Carlow. With the assistance of prominent local people, particularly John Alexander, a prominent Carlow miller, and Henry Parnell MP for Queen&#x27;s County, Dargan began working with the Scottish engineer Thomas Telford on the Holyhead side of the London-Holyhead road. He worked there between 1819 and 1824. In 1824 Telford asked Dargan to begin work on Howth Road, from Raheny to Sutton in Dublin. The young Dargan earned the relatively large sum of £300 for his work on this road and this provided the capital for future public works investments. Henry Parnell MP described this road as &quot;a model for other roads in the vicinity of Dublin&quot;. Around the same time Dargan contributed roads in Dublin, Carlow and Louth as a surveyor. Dargan also served as assistant manager for about three years on the Birmingham &amp; Liverpool Junction Canal and the Middlewich Branch, which are two canals in the English midlands.

On 13 October 1828, William Dargan married Jane Arkinstall in the Anglican Church of St Michael &amp; All Angels, Adbaston, Staffordshire. He and Jane did not produce any offspring.

When Dargan came back to Ireland, he was occupied by minor construction projects, including rebuilding the main street of Banbridge and the 13 kilometers long Kilbeggan branch of the Grand Canal. After Irish parliament decided to launch a plan for the very first railway, the Dublin &amp; Kingstown Railway in 1825, Dargan had become increasingly invested in this project. To fight against the skepticism of any railway program in Ireland, Dargan spent a considerable amount of unpaid time promoting this first railway of Ireland, working along with engineer Charles Vignoles to plan the route. After a persistent effort of Dargan, Dublin &amp; Kingstown Railway was able to be opened on 17 December 1834, with eight trains in each direction, at full capacity. He next constructed the water communication between Lough Erne and Belfast, afterwards known as the Ulster Canal, a signal triumph of engineering and constructive ability.

Other great works followed – the Dublin and Drogheda Railway, the Great Southern and Western Railway and the Midland Great Western Railway. By 1853 he had constructed over six hundred miles of railway, and he had then contracts for two hundred more. He paid the highest wages with the greatest punctuality, and his credit was unbounded. At one time he was the largest railway projector in Ireland and one of its greatest capitalists.

Dargan had a strong sense of patriotism to Ireland. He was offered a knighthood by the British Viceroy in Ireland, but declined. Following this, Britain&#x27;s Queen Victoria visited Dargan at his residence, Dargan Villa, Mount Annville on 29 August 1853. She offered him a baronetcy, but he declined this also. Wishing to encourage the growth of flax, he then took a tract of land whose culture he devoted himself to, but owing to some mismanagement the enterprise entailed a heavy loss. He also became a manufacturer, and set some mills working in Chapelizod, in the neighbourhood of Dublin, but that business did not prosper.

In 1860, continuing his branching out into different business ventures, Dargan brought the International Hotel in Bray from John Quin. Another hotel named Hayes Royal Hotel in Kingstown was also subsequently bought in 1863 by Dargan with elaborate plans for extension. Financial issues meant that these plans were abandoned, and the original hotel was simply remodelled to fit Dargan&#x27;s original purpose. From the original design envisioned, the only pieces realised were the centrepiece and south wing. Architect John McCurdy had originally intended to add a right-hand wing to the hotel but none of this came to be. The hotel was rechristened as the Royal Marine Hotel and opened in September 1865. It is understood that the financial difficulties encountered during the purchasing and building of the hotel exacerbated Dargan&#x27;s financial issues, eventually leading to economic ruin.

Latterly he devoted himself chiefly to the working and extension of the Dublin, Wicklow and Wexford Railway, of which he was chairman. In 1866 he was seriously injured by a fall from his horse. He died at 2 Fitzwilliam Square East, Dublin, on 7 February 1867, and was buried in Glasnevin cemetery. His widow, Jane, was granted a civil list pension of £100 on 18 June 1870.

== William Dargan and 1853 Dublin Exhibition ==

The Royal Dublin Society elected Dargan as a life member in November 1851. After attending the Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851, William Dargan proposed to the society with an extended exhibition, with an offer of £20,000 of funding.

As the committee of the 1853 Exhibition believed that this event would be self-financing, mainly relying on Dargan&#x27;s contribution of £20,000, it was announced that there would be no cash donations taken. After the building costs had risen by the autumn of 1852, the committee was forced to make a public subscription, but Dargan offered another £6,000 as patronage. It eventually reached to the point that Dargan personally funded this exhibition with a considerable amount of £88,000. Dublin Exhibition received many visitors. Although there were only 400 people on the first two days, this number rose to 4,000 a week later, and to 5,000 on the following day. The British royal party arrived at Dun Laoghaire on 29 August 1853 at the purpose to attend the exhibition, and Queen Victoria personally met William Dargan.

Prince Albert commented both on Dargan and the Dublin Exhibition, &quot;Mr Dargan is the man of the people. He is a simple, unobtrusive, retiring man, a thorough Irishman, not always quite sober of an evening, industrious, kind to his workmen, but the only man who has by his own determination &amp; courage put a stop to every strike or combination of workmen, of which the Irish are so fond. All he has done has been done on the field of Industry &amp; not of politics or Religion, without the Priest or factious conspiracy, without the promise of distant extraordinary advantages but with immediate apparent benefit. The &quot;Exhibition&quot;, which must be pronounced to be very successful, has done wonders in this respect. A private undertaking, unaided by Govt, or any Commission with Royal Authority, made and erected at the sole expense of a single Individual, &amp; this an Irish Road contractor, not long ago a &quot;common labourer&quot; himself, who had raised himself solely by his own industry &amp; energy, - it deserves the greatest credit &amp; is looked upon by the Irish with infinite self-satisfaction as an emblem of national hope&quot;.

William Dargan ultimately lost £20,000 on the venture. At the close of the exhibition, the Irish National Gallery was built on Leinster Lawn, as a monument to Dargan, with a fine bronze statue of him in front of it, looking out upon Merrion Square.

<text>An Admiral of the Fleet of the Soviet Union () was the highest naval rank of the Soviet Union.

==Overview==
The rank was largely honorary and could be considered equivalent to admiral of the fleet in other nations. It was formally established by the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on March 3, 1955, and replaced a similarly named rank, Fleet Admiral/Admiral of the Fleet (&quot;адмирал флота&quot;) that had been equivalent to marshal of the Soviet Union since 1945. The holders were entitled to a marshal&#x27;s star.

Upon its creation, the only two admirals of the fleet, Nikolai Kuznetsov and Ivan Isakov, were &quot;promoted&quot; to this rank. Less than a year later Kuznetsov was demoted to vice admiral for political reasons in 1956 and Isakov remained the only admiral of the fleet of the Soviet Union until his death in 1967. Then, in October 1967, Fleet Admiral Sergei Gorshkov became the third and final admiral of the fleet of the Soviet Union. Gorshkov died in 1988 and no further appointments were made before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the elimination of the rank.

From 1962 onwards, it was one grade higher than Fleet Admiral, which was recreated as an intermediate rank, equivalent to Army General.

<doc id="668670" wikidata="Q256875" url="?curid=668670" title="Kevin Phillips (English footballer)">
<text>Kevin Mark Phillips (born 25 July 1973) is an English former professional footballer who was most recently the head coach of club AFC Fylde.

A striker, Phillips started his career with Southampton but failed to make the first team and was released. He then signed for non-League side Baldock Town where he impressed, earning a move to Watford in 1994. In 1997, Phillips signed for First Division club Sunderland. In his first season he scored 35 goals in all competitions, the most goals in a season for a Sunderland player since the Second World War as well as being the league&#x27;s top goalscorer. Phillips scored 23 goals in 26 league games in the following season as Sunderland were crowned champions of the First Division. He received his first call up to the England national team in 1999. In the 1999–2000 season, Phillips scored 30 Premier League goals to earn himself a place in the PFA Team of the Year. This goal tally earned him the Golden Boot award as well as the European Golden Shoe. He was the first Englishman to have won the award and remains the only one to achieve it in the Premier League. Phillips was named in the squad for UEFA Euro 2000 although he made no appearances at the finals. He made his eighth and final appearance for England in 2002. Phillips spent a further three seasons with the Wearside club, making 235 appearances and scoring 130 goals before departing for Southampton in 2003 following Sunderland&#x27;s relegation. 

After two seasons with Southampton and one with Aston Villa, Phillips signed for Championship club West Bromwich Albion. In his second season with West Brom, Phillips was a member of the team that won the league with him being named as the Championship Player of the Season. In 2008, he signed for fellow West Midlands club Birmingham City where he won the League Cup in his third season. He spent two seasons with Championship club Blackpool before moving to Crystal Palace initially on loan. With Palace, Phillips scored the winning penalty in the play-off final against his former club Watford to earn promotion to the Premier League. In January 2014, Phillips signed for Leicester City who won the Championship title. He retired at the end of the 2013–14 season.

He began his coaching career with his last club Leicester City as their assistant first team coach. After other coaching roles with Derby County and Stoke City, he began his managerial career with South Shields. With South Shields, he won the Northern Premier League title in his second season before leaving at the end of the season. In January 2024, he was confirmed as the new manager of Hartlepool United.

==Club career==

===Early career===
Phillips was born in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. He started his footballing career as a trainee with Southampton, where he spent six years, four as a schoolboy, before being taken on as an apprentice in 1989. As a youth, Phillips was considered to be too small to play up front and was played at right back, in which position he made two reserve team appearances in 1990. He failed to make the grade at Southampton and was released by manager Chris Nicholl, and returned to Hertfordshire where he signed for non-League semi-professional side Baldock Town in the summer of 1991.

At Baldock Town, he was initially played as a defender until an injury crisis resulted in manager Ian Allinson playing Phillips as a striker, scoring twice in his first match in his new role. He was signed by Watford in December 1994 for an initial £10,000, plus four additional payments of £5,000.

===Watford===
Phillips established himself in the squad during the second half of the 1994–95 season, and played regularly before suffering a foot injury in March 1996, initially diagnosed as a hairline fracture and later discovered to be a hole in a ligament in his foot, that kept him out for a year. Watford were relegated from Division One in 1995–96, and by the time Phillips returned to the team, they were in the top half of Division Two, and went on to finish 13th. In July 1997, Phillips signed for Sunderland for a fee of £325,000, potentially rising to more than £600,000.

===Sunderland===

Phillips signed for Sunderland just after their relegation from the Premiership. Fifteen matches into the Division One season, the club were in mid-table and Phillips had four goals. In the remainder of the season, Phillips set or equalled club records by scoring in seven consecutive matches and in nine consecutive home matches, became the first Sunderland player since Brian Clough in 1961–62 to score 30 goals in a season, and finished the campaign with 35 goals in all competitions, the most by any Sunderland player in one season since the Second World War. His tally included a four-goal haul in the third round of the FA Cup at Rotherham United and two goals in the play-off campaign. After scoring Sunderland&#x27;s second goal in the play-off final, Phillips was substituted after 73 minutes with an injury, so missed the remainder of the 4–4 draw with Charlton Athletic which Sunderland lost 7–6 on penalties. Phillips later described the final as his &quot;most disappointing day in football&quot;, but also as the best match he had ever played in.

Phillips scored eight goals in the opening weeks of the 1998–99 season as Sunderland reached the top of the Division One table. A broken toe sustained in a League Cup tie against Chester City in mid-September kept him out for nearly four months, but his goalscoring resumed immediately upon his return, with a &quot;screaming volley&quot; away to Queens Park Rangers. Promotion was confirmed in April as Phillips scored four of Sunderland&#x27;s five goals in an away game against Bury, and he ended the season with 23 goals from only 26 league games, and 25 goals in all competitions. His form earned him an international call-up for England, and he made his debut in the starting eleven in a friendly against Hungary.

In the run-up to the start of the 1999–2000 FA Premier League season, pundit Rodney Marsh predicted that Phillips would struggle to get more than five or six goals at the higher level. Forming a potent &quot;little and large&quot; strike pairing with veteran target-man Niall Quinn, Phillips scored his sixth goal on 18 September – the first of a hat-trick against Derby County – and was named Premier League Player of the Month for October. His goal tally was 20 by mid-January and 30 by the season&#x27;s end, a total that earned him not only the Premier League Golden Boot but also the European Golden Shoe award – he was the first Englishman to have won the latter and held the distinction until Harry Kane won the honour in 2024 – and with a 14-goal return from Quinn contributed to Sunderland&#x27;s seventh-place finish, just missing out on a UEFA Cup place.

In January 2001, Phillips scored his 104th goal for Sunderland, breaking the club&#x27;s post-war goalscoring record. As the season wore on, Phillips suffered both a lack of form and disciplinary problems: he scored only once between mid-January and May, and came in for criticism from fans and local press. He finished the season with 18 goals in all competitions, 14 in the league, as Sunderland again finished seventh and missed out on UEFA Cup qualification.

Phillips&#x27; goals contribution to Sunderland&#x27;s 2001–02 season fell to 13, of which 11 came in the league. He relinquished his penalty-taking duties, after three consecutive spot-kicks were saved, but his goal on the final day of the season, in a 1–1 draw with Derby County, was enough to ensure 17th place and Premier League survival. He played the last months of the campaign despite a groin problem which required surgery over the 2002 close season.

Amid interest from clubs including Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, Phillips &quot;pledged his future&quot; to Sunderland ahead of the 2002–03 season, though he later confirmed he had submitted a transfer request in August. Manager Peter Reid brought in strikers Tore André Flo and Marcus Stewart, and warned Phillips he was no longer an automatic first choice. Phillips in fact started 32 of the 38 league matches, but scored only 6 goals as the club were relegated with just four wins and what were then Premier League record lows of 19 points and 21 goals. A second transfer request was rejected in January, but at the end of the season Phillips confirmed that the club&#x27;s need to reduce its expenditure in light of relegation meant that he would be leaving. He had played in 235 matches for Sunderland, and scored 130 goals at an average of better than a goal every two games.

===Southampton===
In August 2003, following Sunderland&#x27;s relegation from the Premier League, Phillips moved to the south coast to join Southampton for a fee of £3.25 million, with Phillips signing a four-year contract, while taking a substantial cut in his salary.

He made his debut on 16 August, coming on as a substitute away to Leicester City and scoring with a long-range strike in a 2–2 draw. His next goal came at White Hart Lane on 20 September when the ball ricocheted in off him from an attempted clearance by Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s Anthony Gardner. This was followed in mid-week by the equalising goal in a 1–1 draw with Steaua Bucharest in the UEFA Cup First round. On the following Saturday, Phillips was sent off in the final minute of a bad-tempered 1–0 defeat to Middlesbrough, after he kicked out at Boro defender Franck Queudrue.

Phillips then failed to score for over three months until his fourth goal of the season came in a 2–1 victory over Leeds United on 17 January 2004. There then followed a rich run of form with Phillips netting ten further goals in the final four months of the season including two goals in the matches at Manchester United, Wolverhampton Wanderers and Manchester City. Phillips ended the 2003–04 season with 13 goals in total, from 37 appearances.

In March 2004, manager Gordon Strachan had resigned to be replaced by Paul Sturrock who was dismissed shortly after the start of the 2004–05 season, to be replaced in turn by Steve Wigley who spent just three months in charge before the arrival of Harry Redknapp from local rivals Portsmouth in December. Phillips had now played under four managers within a year.

Despite the frequent changes in manager, Phillips continued to score regularly in his partnership with new signing Peter Crouch. He managed ten league goals in 2004–05, including two in a 3–3 draw with Fulham on 5 January. Despite Phillips&#x27;s goals, the club finished at the bottom of the table and were relegated after 27 years in the top flight. On 29 June 2005, Phillips departed from Southampton after two years and 22 league goals to join Aston Villa in a £1 million deal.

===Aston Villa===
Phillips signed a two-year contract with Premier League club Aston Villa for a fee of £1 million on 29 June 2005. He scored just four minutes into his Villa debut, and then returned from injury to seal Villa&#x27;s first Premier League defeat of local rivals Birmingham City in seven attempts. Phillips shared front-man duties with Juan Pablo Ángel and fellow new signing Milan Baroš, but illness and further injuries disrupted his season, in which he contributed only five goals. He began the 2006–07 season with Villa, but on 22 August, he signed for West Bromwich Albion of the Championship for a £700,000 fee.

===West Bromwich Albion===

Phillips joined West Bromwich Albion despite strong interest from Sunderland, where his former strike partner Niall Quinn had recently become both chairman and manager. He cited a reluctance to move his family and home for a third time in three years as a major factor in his decision. He scored 22 goals in his first season with West Brom, including two hat-tricks, one in a 5–1 win at Ipswich Town and the second in a 7–0 defeat of Barnsley on the final day of the regular season that confirmed Albion&#x27;s place in the play-offs. Phillips scored twice in the first leg of the play-off semi-final against Wolverhampton Wanderers, and headed the only goal of the second leg to ensure their progression to the final, in which they lost 1–0 to Derby County.

He missed six weeks of the 2007–08 season because of a knee injury sustained in early November, but rediscovered his goalscoring form on his return to win the Championship player-of-the-month award for December. Described by Albion manager Tony Mowbray as &quot;a natural goal-scorer with great awareness and vision&quot;, Phillips scored his 200th League goal in a 1–1 draw with Crystal Palace on 13 March 2008. For the last match of the season, away to Queens Park Rangers, fans of West Bromwich Albion chose to dress up as superheroes in honour of Phillips, who is nicknamed &quot;Super Kev&quot;; Albion won the match 2–0 to win promotion to the Premier League as champions. Phillips won numerous awards over the season. He received Player-of-the-Year awards from both the West Bromwich Albion Supporters Club and from the club itself, after scoring 24 goals from 30 starts and finishing as the Championship&#x27;s second top goalscorer. At national level, he was chosen Championship Player of the Year at the annual Football League Awards, ahead of Andy Gray of Charlton Athletic and Michael Kightly of Wolverhampton Wanderers, and, together with teammates Paul Robinson and Jonathan Greening, was named in the PFA Championship Team of the Year.

===Birmingham City===
When his contract with West Bromwich Albion expired at the end of the 2007–08 season, the club offered Phillips a one-year deal, with an additional second year if he made 19 or more league appearances. He rejected the offer, preferring to sign a two-year contract with Birmingham City, newly relegated from the Premier League. He made his debut on the opening day of the 2008–09 season against Sheffield United, coming on as a substitute to score a stoppage time winner in a 1–0 victory. Phillips continued his scoring run with goals in his next two games, against Southampton and Barnsley, &quot;lashed in a stinging low drive&quot; against Reading that earned him the club&#x27;s Goal of the Season award, and finished the season with 14 goals in all competitions. His 14th, to take a two-goal lead in a 2–1 win against promotion rivals Reading on the last day of the season, ensured Birmingham&#x27;s return to the Premier League after just one season in the Championship.

At 36, Phillips recognised he would play a reduced role at the higher level. In a season when manager Alex McLeish relied on consistency in team selection – Birmingham set a Premier League record of nine consecutive matches with the same starting eleven, and a club record twelve-match unbeaten run in the top flight – he started only twice, but came on as substitute in 17 games. He scored only four goals, but those goals contributed four points to the club&#x27;s highest finish for more than 50 years. Against Wolverhampton Wanderers, he came off the bench to score twice in the last ten minutes and win the game, and on 27 March 2010, 1–0 down at home to Arsenal, a 92nd-minute clearance by Bacary Sagna deflected off Phillips&#x27; face via the goalkeeper into the net for his 250th career goal.

He signed a one-year contract extension ahead of the 2010–11 season, but missed the start through injury. He went on to make five league starts, but his major contribution came in the League Cup. Facing League One club Brentford, Phillips scored a stoppage-time equaliser and converted his penalty in the shootout by which Birmingham progressed to the quarter-final. They went on to reach the final, where Phillips received his first winners&#x27; medal in a cup competition, albeit as an unused substitute, as Birmingham defeated favourites Arsenal 2–1. Birmingham finished 18th in the League, so were relegated to the Championship, and Phillips was one of several players to leave the club when their contracts expired at the end of the season.

===Blackpool===
On 10 July 2011, Phillips signed a one-year deal with Football League Championship club Blackpool. On 14 August, he scored both of Blackpool&#x27;s goals in their 2–1 league victory over Peterborough United, on his home debut. He again scored twice a few days later, including a last-minute equaliser, in a 2–2 draw away at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. On 5 November, Phillips scored the only goal of the game against Millwall within three minutes of coming on as a substitute. In a five-game spell in January and February 2012, he came off the bench to score late equalising goals in three league matches, two of which Blackpool went on to win, and, in his first start for three months, converted a 93rd-minute penalty against Sheffield Wednesday in the fourth round of the FA Cup to force a replay. Phillips finished the season as the club&#x27;s top scorer, with 17 goals in all competitions, and won their goal of the season for his equaliser against Cardiff City, described in &quot;The Observer&quot; as &quot;a lovely lob punishing [goalkeeper] David Marshall for a punched clearance that lacked the required distance. Phillips took the ball down on his chest, picked his spot and scored with consummate skill and accuracy&quot;.

Phillips took up the option to extend his Blackpool contract for a further year, but scored only twice from 18 appearances before following manager Ian Holloway to Championship rivals Crystal Palace.

===Crystal Palace===
On the last day of the January 2013 transfer window, Phillips signed on loan to Crystal Palace until the end of the 2012–13 season. He made his debut as a half-time substitute in the 2–1 win at home to Charlton Athletic, after being 1–0 down prior to his introduction, and scored his first goal for the Eagles in their next game, against his former club Watford at Vicarage Road. Palace were again trailing when he came off the bench, 2–0 down with half an hour remaining, and Phillips scored the equaliser as the side fought back to achieve a 2–2 draw. Phillips&#x27; hat-trick, scored in eight minutes either side of half-time in a 4–2 defeat of Hull City, made him the oldest scorer in Palace&#x27;s history at 39 years 7 months. This is also the club&#x27;s fastest ever hat-trick in the league, beating the previous record set by Dougie Freedman in 11 minutes in a 5–0 win against Grimsby Town exactly 17 years before. On 27 May, he came on as a substitute in the play-off final and converted an extra-time penalty, after Wilfried Zaha had been fouled by Marco Cassetti, to secure Palace&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League at the expense of former club Watford. Steve Parish indicated in the &quot;Croydon Advertiser&quot; that Phillips had agreed to a one-year deal with Palace in July 2013.

On 20 July, Palace confirmed that Phillips had joined the club on a one-year deal. On 31 December, Palace announced that Phillips would leave the club by mutual consent in January.

===Leicester City===
On 15 January 2014, Leicester City confirmed that they had signed Phillips on a short-term contract until the end of the season. The striker made his debut on 18 January against Leeds United, coming on as a substitute for Jamie Vardy, helping create the opportunity that saw fellow former England international David Nugent score the winning goal of the game. On 1 February, Phillips scored his first goal for the club against AFC Bournemouth, heading in winger Anthony Knockaert&#x27;s cross. Phillips&#x27; second goal for Leicester, his first at home, came in the 3–1 victory over former club Blackpool on 15 March. On 28 April, he announced his intention to retire from football at the conclusion of the 2013–14 season. With Leicester already confirmed as champions, Phillips played his final career game in the last match of the season, against Doncaster Rovers on 3 May, and was substituted in the 65th minute.

==Coaching career==
===Leicester City===
Following his retirement from football, Phillips was offered a coaching role and remained at Leicester City as assistant first team coach for the club&#x27;s first season back in the Premier League.

===Derby County===
On 17 September 2015, Phillips was appointed as assistant coach to Paul Clement at Derby County.

===Stoke City===
In June 2018, Phillips joined as first-team coach to Gary Rowett at Stoke City. He left Stoke on 8 January 2019.

===South Shields===
On 16 January 2022, Phillips was appointed as manager of Northern Premier League Premier Division club South Shields. Despite being favourites to win the league, South Shields finished second and lost in the play-off semi-finals to Warrington Town in Phillips&#x27; first season as manager.

Phillips secured promotion in his second season with the club, winning the league title with two games to spare with a 1–0 victory at Whitby Town. He departed the club by mutual consent on 22 April 2023.

===Hartlepool United===
On 20 January 2024, Phillips was appointed as head coach of National League club Hartlepool United. Hartlepool had been relegated from League Two in the previous season and were in 16th position, four points above the relegation zone prior to Phillips&#x27; appointment. His first match with Hartlepool was a 2–1 home win against York City on 27 January. Hartlepool finished the season in 12th position. On 27 April 2024, Phillips&#x27; departure was confirmed after his contract expired. Following his departure from Hartlepool, a statement from Phillips&#x27; representatives said that the club had offered him a two-year contract before later withdrawing their offer of a new contract. Phillips himself added that: &quot;I have thoroughly enjoyed working at Hartlepool United and with all the existing staff there&quot;. Hartlepool won 7 games from 16 during his tenure.

===AFC Fylde===
On 8 October 2024, Phillips was appointed head coach of National League side AFC Fylde.
On 19 February 2025, four months after taking charge, Phillips was relieved of his duties. 

==International career==
Between April 1999 and February 2002, Phillips made eight appearances for England but failed to score. His debut came when he was one of five international debutants selected by manager Kevin Keegan for the friendly match away to Hungary. Phillips had an opportunity to score in the first half, but his shot hit Gábor Király&#x27;s legs. In the 74th minute, Phillips was replaced by fellow debutant Emile Heskey.

In the final warm-up match before the Euro 2000 tournament, Phillips failed to score in a 2–1 victory against Malta, with the BBC describing him as having &quot;that slightly desperate look of all fringe players who have been left precious little time to impress&quot;. Despite this, Phillips was selected by Keegan as part of the England squad for Euro 2000, but he remained an unused substitute.

In his final appearance for England, he came on as a half-time substitute in a friendly against the Netherlands on 13 February 2002, in which he had a chance to equalise when he forced keeper Edwin van der Sar into an error; Van der Sar then produced a point-blank save from David Beckham&#x27;s follow-up.

==Personal life==
Phillips is married to Julie. They have four children.

Phillips&#x27; cousin-in-law is Labour politician Jess Phillips.

<text>Highway 5 is a north–south route in southern British Columbia, Canada. Highway 5 connects the southern Trans-Canada route (Highway 1) with the northern Trans-Canada/Yellowhead route (Highway 16), providing the shortest land connection between Vancouver and Edmonton. Despite the entire route being signed as part of the Yellowhead Highway, the portion of Highway 5 south of Kamloops is also known as the Coquihalla Highway, while the northern portion is known as the Southern Yellowhead Highway. The Coquihalla section was a toll road until 2008.

Although the Yellowhead Highway system is considered part of the Trans-Canada Highway network, Highway 5 is not represented with a Trans-Canada marker. Regardless, Highway 5 is designated as a core route of Canada&#x27;s National Highway System.

==Route description==

=== Coquihalla Highway ===
Between Hope and Kamloops, Highway 5 is known as the Coquihalla Highway (colloquially &quot;the Coq&quot;, pronounced &quot;coke&quot;). It is a freeway, varying between four and six lanes with a speed limit of for most of its length. The Coquihalla approximately traces through the Cascade Mountains the route of the former Kettle Valley Railway, which existed between 1912 and 1958. It is so named because near Hope, it generally follows the Coquihalla River, for about , and uses the Coquihalla Pass. The pass is named in the Halq̓eméylem language used by the Stó꞉lō, which means &quot;stingy container&quot; and refers specifically to a fishing rock near the mouth of what is now known as the Coquihalla River. According to Stó꞉lō oral history, the (water babies, underwater people) who inhabit a pool close to the rock would swim out and pull the salmon off the spears, allowing only certain fisherman to catch the salmon.&quot;

Highway 5 begins south at the junction with Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) at uninhabited Othello, east of Hope (named after a nearby siding on the Kettle Valley Railway, which used many Shakespearean names). Exit numbers on the Coquihalla are a continuation of those on Highway 1 west of Hope, as it is an extension of the freeway that starts in Horseshoe Bay. north of Othello, after passing through five interchanges, Highway 5 reaches the landmark Great Bear snow shed. The location of the former toll booth is north of the snow shed, passing through another interchange and the 
 Coquihalla Pass. Highway 5 is the only highway in British Columbia to have had tolls; a typical passenger vehicle toll was $10. Now free to drive, at the Coquihalla Lakes junction, the highway crosses from the Fraser Valley Regional District into the Thompson-Nicola Regional District. and five interchanges north of the former toll plaza. The Coquihalla Highway then enters the city of Merritt, which is accessed by two interchanges, both of which also provide access to Highway 5A, Highway 97C, and Highway 8.
The section of highway, between Merritt and Kamloops, is long. After exiting Merritt, the highway climbs up a long, steep hill toward another high point, the Surrey Lake Summit. It passes through three interchanges along this section. A diamond interchange at Exit 336 provides an important turnoff to Logan Lake on Highway 97D and Lac le Jeune. Shortly after the junction, the highway descends into the city of Kamloops, where it meets Highways 1 and 97 at a trumpet interchange.

=== Kamloops ===
Highway 5 continues east for concurrently with Highways 1 and 97, through Kamloops. This stretch of road, which carries 97 &quot;South&quot; and 5 &quot;North&quot; on the same lanes (and vice versa), is the only wrong-way concurrency in British Columbia. This section is mostly an urban freeway with a speed limit of . It passes through five interchanges, connecting to the core area of Kamloops, before the concurrency splits and Highway 5 exits off the road to the north in a complex five-way interchange.

After separating from Highways 1 and 97, Highway 5 proceeds north for approximately . For most of this section, it is a four-lane divided highway with several signalized intersections and a speed limit of . After leaving the concurrency it immediately crosses the South Thompson River and enters a First Nations Reserve, temporarily leaving Kamloops city limits. A particularly important intersection is the signal lights at Halston Drive, which is one of only two access points to the north half of Kamloops. Highway 5 re-enters the city at the Rayleigh community, where it passes two busy at-grade, but not signalized intersections; traffic volumes steadily decrease as it gets farther from the core area of Kamloops. Heffley Creek indicates the northern boundary of Kamloops; the exit to Sun Peaks resort is at the same turnoff. Traffic volumes thin out at that exit, and shortly afterward Highway 5 narrows to a two-lane undivided road.

=== Southern Yellowhead Highway ===
The Southern Yellowhead highway is the northern section of Highway 5. This section is long. It is largely a two-lane undivided road, with some rare three- or four-lane sections for passing, although work has been constantly underway (especially in the Heffley Creek–Clearwater section) to create more passing opportunities. The speed limit is for the most part except in towns, where it can drop as low as . Traffic volume on this section of highway is low compared to the Coquihalla and Kamloops sections of Highway 5. In its whole length there is only one traffic signal, which is in the town of Valemount. Services for drivers are provided in the major towns.

Highway 5 follows the North Thompson River north from Kamloops and Heffley Creek for approximately , along a parallel course with the Canadian National Railway&#x27;s main line. It passes an important junction for Adams Lake in the settlement of Louis Creek before entering the town Barriere. North of Barriere, it encounters a junction with Highway 24 in the village of Little Fort. north of Little Fort, while continuing to follow the North Thompson and the CN Railway, Highway 5 reaches the resort community of Clearwater, where a roundabout provides access to Wells Gray Provincial Park. Highway 5 proceeds northeast for another , passing Vavenby and Avola to the community of Blue River, a popular heliskiing location. From there it proceeds farther north through the heart of the Columbia Mountains. It crosses a low divide between the Thompson River and Fraser River drainages, entering the Regional District of Fraser-Fort George. It soon passes through the community of Valemount, where a traffic signal is located. Next it passes Tête Jaune Cache and crosses the Fraser River, after which it immediately meets Highway 16 in a partial interchange, marking its northern terminus.

==History==
The current Highway 5 is not the first highway in B.C. to have this designation. From 1941 to 1953, the section of present-day Highway 97, Highway 97A, and Highway 97B, between Kaleden, just south of Penticton, and Salmon Arm, was formerly Highway 5. In 1953, the &#x27;5&#x27; designation was moved to designate Princeton-Merritt-Kamloops Highway (present-day Highway 5A) to north of Kamloops; by 1960, Highway 5 was extended north to Tête Jaune Cache and subsequently paved. In 1970, Highway 5 between Kamloops and Tête Jaune Cache was designated as the South Yellowhead Highway and signed with the Yellowhead Highway shield, while the section south of Kamloops was still signed with the standard British Columbia highway shield.

In the 1960s, the Merritt Board of Trade began lobbying the B.C. government for a new highway route to Hope, including a vehicle caravan that was staged eight times starting in 1963, over the abandoned Kettle Valley Railway grade, in order draw attention to the potential of this route. Surveying commenced in 1973, and in 1979 the first construction contract was issued for a section of highway between Nicolum Creek and Peers Creek near Hope; however, work progressed slowly until 1984, when Premier Bill Bennett announced that the project would be fast-tracked so it could be completed to coincide with Expo 86. To ensure the project was completed on time, more than 10,000 workers were needed, and more than 1,000 pieces of heavy equipment worked non-stop every day during the summer of 1985. The project was divided into three phases, with Phase 1 being the section between Hope and Merritt, Phase 2 being the section between Merritt and Kamloops, and Phase 3 being a branch between Merritt and Peachland, south of Kelowna. To offset the cost of fast-tracking construction, Phase 1 was made a toll highway, with a toll plaza constructed at the summit of Coquihalla Summit; it was designed to accommodate 13 toll booths for 14 lanes of traffic.

On May 16, 1986, Phase 1 was officially opened, and Highway 5 was re-routed between Hope and Merritt; its construction required 31 bridges and underpasses and over of gravel. The opening celebrations featured a ceremony in Hope followed by a convoy led by Premier Bennett in an open-air convertible that smashed through paper banners strung across the new highway lanes, stopped at the Coquihalla Summit to dedicate a time capsule, and continued to Merritt for further celebrations. The total cost for the highway between Hope and Merritt was approximately $848 million. Phase 2, between Merritt and Kamloops, opened in September 1987, re-routing Highway 5, while Phase 3 was opened in October 1990 and designated as Highway 97C. The three phases have been credited with transforming Merritt into an important transportation hub between the coast and interior, as well as significant growth in both Kamloops and the Okanagan due to improved accessibility.

In 2003, Premier Gordon Campbell announced the Liberal government would turn over toll revenue to a private operator, along with responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the Coquihalla Highway. In response to strong opposition from the public and numerous businesses in the Interior of British Columbia, the provincial government shelved the move three months later.

On September 26, 2008, the provincial government permanently lifted the Coquihalla tolls, effective 1:00 pm that day. Subsequently, the toll station and signs were dismantled.

In 2011, the British Columbia government replaced the standard British Columbia Highway 5 shields with Yellowhead Highway 5 shields south of Kamloops, which at the time drew some concern that the Coquihalla Highway would be officially renamed.

Effective July 2, 2014, the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure increased the speed limit on the Coquihalla Highway from to after conducting an engineering assessment and province-wide speed review. In June 2016, the province implemented a variable speed limit corridor around the Coquihalla Summit Park to increase safety during adverse conditions.

== Accidents and weather ==
Signs along the Coquihalla Highway frequently warn drivers to be aware of sudden changes in weather. The highway is particularly dangerous during winter seasons, with extreme snowfall that can exceed more than per hour. While road maintenance strives to keep the roads as clear as possible, it is not unheard of for the highway to shut down, sometimes with travellers forced to stay overnight in their cars.

According to ICBC, there were 32 fatal crashes between 2004 and 2013, and an estimated 400–500 accidents occur during the winter seasons. Global News listed the stretch between Merritt and Hope as one of the deadliest highways in BC. DriveBC provides up-to-date reports on Coquihalla Highway conditions, including live webcams in several locations.

Owing to its reputation, Highway 5 is featured predominantly in the reality docuseries &quot;Highway Thru Hell,&quot; which follows a group of towing companies that operate in the Interior and Highway 5.&#x27;

On November 14, 2021, a major storm in southern British Columbia damaged sections of the Coquihalla Highway and other routes in the area. Over the course of November 14 and 15, of rain fell along the Coquihalla route. The heavy rain eventually caused several large washouts at multiple points along the highway, including the destruction of multiple bridges. Initial repair estimates included temporary reopenings consisting of temporary bridges, operational for early 2022, with full repair completed in September 2022. After the washouts, Canadian Forces Cormorant helicopters evacuated stranded motorists on the highway. On December 20, the Coquihalla Highway was reopened to essential traffic, with non-essential traffic being diverted toward Highway 99. On January 19, 2022, the Coquihalla Highway was reopened to non-essential traffic from Hope to Merritt. The highway has since been fully reopened, allowing full traffic from Hope to Kamloops.

<doc id="668678" wikidata="Q6112285" url="?curid=668678" title="Jack Eckerd">
<text>Jack Eckerd (May 16, 1913 – May 19, 2004) was an American businessman and the second generation owner of Eckerd chain of drugstores.

==Early life==
Eckerd was born in Wilmington, Delaware, and graduated from Culver Military Academy and the Boeing School of Aeronautics. He was a pilot for the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II, in which capacity he received three Air Medals and the Presidential Unit Citation. He was also involved in politics and served in both state and national governments for 30 years. In 1968, he developed the first residential adolescent treatment program for troubled boys, founded in Brooksville, Florida.

==Career==
Starting in the 1950s, he transformed his family&#x27;s retail drugstore business into one of the leading self-service drugstore chains in the United States, Eckerd Drugs. His personal finances were estimated in 1975 by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine at $150 million.

The Eckerd chain, oldest of the major drugstore companies in the U.S., was founded by Jack&#x27;s father, J. Milton Eckerd, in Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1898. After serving as a pilot in World War II, Jack Eckerd started a phenomenal expansion of the chain by buying three stores in Florida in 1952. The company went public as Jack Eckerd Corp. in 1961 and when Eckerd sold his shares in 1986, there were about 1,500 stores.

The chain was later sold to J.C. Penney, who built the number of stores to 2,600 before selling to rivals CVS and Jean Coutu. Stores in ten states from Florida west to Arizona became CVS; the stores from Georgia north to New York continued as Eckerd Corporation, run by Jean Coutu&#x27;s US arm along with its New England–based Brooks chain.

In July 2007 Coutu&#x27;s 1,549 Eckerd stores across the Mid-Atlantic and New England became part of the Rite Aid drugstore chain, finally ending more than a century of the Eckerd name in drug retailing.

==Family and death==
Eckerd&#x27;s family included seven children—two from a previous marriage, plus three adopted and two of his own after his marriage to Ruth Eckerd (1922 – July 18, 2006). He died of pneumonia in 2004, aged 91.

==Public service==
In 1975 Eckerd was appointed administrator of the General Services Administration by U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. During his confirmation hearing, Eckerd said that President Ford instructed him (Eckerd) to &quot;...run this agency as clean as a hound&#x27;s tooth.&quot; Ford also named Eckerd to serve on the U.S.O. Board of Governors. President Ronald Reagan later named him to the Grace Commission&#x27;s private sector panel on government cost control. In 1981 Governor Bob Graham named Eckerd chairman of Florida&#x27;s Prison Rehabilitative Industries &amp; Diversified Enterprises, Inc. (PRIDE), a unique private sector board that operates all Florida Prison industries.

==Political campaigns==

In 1970, Eckerd entered the Republican gubernatorial primary to challenge incumbent Governor Claude R. Kirk, Jr. A third candidate, State Senator L. A. &quot;Skip&quot; Bafalis of Palm Beach, later a U.S. representative, also entered the primary. Eckerd warned that the renomination of Kirk would produce a Republican fiasco in the fall campaign. In a primary endorsement, the &quot;Miami Herald&quot; depicted Eckerd as &quot;an efficient campaigner with the ability to bring people together constructively. ... [Eckerd has] a common touch, dedication to high principle, and organizing genius.&quot;

William C. Cramer, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in 1970, was also at odds with Kirk but was attempting to preserve party unity at the same time. Though he voted in the primary for Eckerd, Cramer took no public position. Kirk received 172,888 primary ballots, but Bafalis&#x27;s 48,378 votes were sufficient to require a runoff with Eckerd, who received 137,731. Kirk then prevailed in the runoff, 199,943 to Eckerd&#x27;s 152,327, after he obtained Bafalis&#x27;s reluctant endorsement.
Distraught that Kirk&#x27;s antics had led to a fratricidal primary, Cramer said that he &quot;customarily&quot; avoided involvement in primaries outside of his own race. Kirk claimed that Cramer assisted Eckerd, whom Kirk assailed as &quot;notorious for his ability to change the scope of the truth. He has an ego problem.&quot; In the campaign rhetoric, Kirk denounced Eckerd for having previously contributed to Democratic candidates, for allegedly running down a Cuban fisherman in a yacht race, and for spending lavishly from his personal fortune in the 1970 primary campaign. Though he defeated Eckerd, Kirk was then unseated, 57-43 percent, by the Democrat Reubin Askew, a state senator from Pensacola.

Eckerd said that though he had supported Kirk in 1966, he became disappointed and embarrassed with the governor: &quot;I was offended by his public behavior and chagrined that he was a Republican.&quot; Despite Kirk&#x27;s tactics, Eckerd said &quot;time heals all wounds, and now I chuckle about it.&quot; He added that his primary runoff defeat in 1970 probably prolonged his life.&quot;
In 1974, Eckerd was the unsuccessful Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate against the Democrat Richard Stone. The conservative vote was divided that year with Dr. John Grady, nominee of George C. Wallace&#x27;s former American Independent Party siphoning votes from Eckerd. Grady ran again in 1976 as the Republican nominee but lost to the Democratic incumbent Lawton Chiles of Lakeland, who had defeated Cramer in 1970.

In 1978, Eckerd defeated U.S. Representative Louis Frey, Jr., of Winter Park to win the Republican gubernatorial nomination, but he lost in the fall to the Democrat Bob Graham of Miami, later a U.S. senator. Kirk ran unsuccessfully for governor again that year, too, but as a Democrat after he failed to qualify as an Independent.

==Philanthropy==
With the millions he made, Eckerd became a philanthropist.
*Ruth Eckerd Hall, a 2,100-seat regional performing arts venue for concerts, plays and civic events in Clearwater, Florida, was named for his wife Ruth Eckerd. It was designed by the Arizona-based Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and opened in 1983.
*Florida Presbyterian College in St. Petersburg, Florida, changed its name to Eckerd College in 1972 following a $12.5 million contribution from Jack, who also served for a time as its interim president.
*In 1968, Jack and Ruth Eckerd founded Eckerd Youth Alternatives (known simply as &quot;Eckerd Kids&quot;), a private, not-for-profit organization dedicated to strengthening children, families and communities, using an Outdoor Therapeutic Program model that included opening the first OTP in the state of Florida for boys in 1968 and the first OTP for girls in the southeastern United States. The organization&#x27;s success with outdoor therapeutic programming soon expanded beyond Florida to several states. Today, Eckerd serves more than 18,500 children and families annually through a continuum of over 30 behavioral health and child welfare services, ranging from early intervention &amp; prevention to community-based interventions, out-of-home care, and workforce development. Affiliate Programs include Paxen Learning and CARING for Children.
*National Foundation for Youth, a philanthropic organization underwritten by Jack and Ruth Eckerd in 1994 to support programs benefiting troubled young people, was later merged into the work of Eckerd.

==Writing==
In 1987, Jack wrote his autobiography with Paul Conn, &quot;Eckerd: Finding the Right Prescription.&quot; This was followed in 1990 by &quot;Enough is Enough,&quot; a booklet offering solutions to the nation&#x27;s severe prison overcrowding crisis. In 1991 he co-authored &quot;Why America Doesn&#x27;t Work&quot; with Charles Colson, analyzing the decline of the work ethic in America and offering solutions.

<doc id="668680" wikidata="Q6641938" url="?curid=668680" title="List of supermarket chains in the United Kingdom">
<text>As of November 2024, there are 17 supermarket chains currently operating in the United Kingdom. The food retail market has been dominated by the &#x27;big four&#x27; supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury&#x27;s, Asda and Morrisons – who made up over three quarters of sector market share in 2010. Tesco is the largest retailer in Great Britain, with a market share of 28.5% at the start of 2025.

However, discounters Lidl and Aldi have grown rapidly. A number of sources reported that in September 2022, Aldi overtook Morrisons to become Great Britain&#x27;s fourth largest grocery retailer. At the end of 2022, Morrisons and Aldi both remained at 9.1%. Collectively, the big four accounted for two thirds and the big four and discounters combined for five sixths of the grocery market share at the start of 2025.

Northern Ireland has similar major chains. In 2022, Tesco was the largest retailer in NI, followed by Sainsbury&#x27;s, Asda and Lidl. However, the market is different because some chains are not shared between the different parts of the UK. For example, Aldi and Morrisons do not operate there.

==Historical background==
Before 1932, British grocery stores operated as counter service, however that year David Greig opened the first self-service grocery store in the UK at Turnpike Lane, Hornsey, but the store although a success, was closed down after eight months of the experiment. The first permanent self-service grocery store in the United Kingdom was opened 12 January 1948 in Manor Park, London by the Co-op, with Tesco opening their first self-service grocery store and Marks &amp; Spencer starting a trial of self-service in the same year. Sainsbury’s opened their first self-service branch in Croydon in 1950. By 1951, the Co-op had 604 self-service stores. In the same year, Express Dairies opened Britain&#x27;s first supermarket under the Premier Supermarket brand in Streatham, South London, while the first Fine Fare was opened as a single supermarket later that year, as an offshoot of the Welwyn Department Store. Waitrose opened their first supermarket in Streatham during 1955, although their first self service store had opened at their subsidiary Schofield &amp; Martin in 1951. Tesco though did not open their first supermarket until 1956 in Maldon, Essex, while Morrisons was not until 1961, and Asda was not until 1963. By 1959, multiple grocery retailers only accounted for 10% of grocery outlets and 25% of the British market, however by a decade later the expansion of supermarkets had seen them take 41% of all grocery turnover. The growth of the supermarket is also shown in store numbers, with Britain only having 175 supermarkets in 1958 but had expanded to 2,803 by 1967. Britain&#x27;s first out of town supermarket was opened by American retailer GEM in West Bridgford, Nottinghamshire by in November 1964.

These supermarkets are either no longer trading, have been renamed, or have been taken over and rebranded.


==Waitrose effect==
Proximity to a supermarket has been widely reported to be an amenity that can have a significant effect on residential property prices in Britain. Beginning under Andy Hulme and continuing under Mike Songer, the home mortgage unit of Lloyds Bank has published pricing research that examines the premiums commanded by homes in a given neighbourhood against comparables in the same post-code and correlates the difference in price with convenience of access to the various supermarkets. The following table averages information from neighbourhoods across England and Wales, compiled by Lloyds Bank for their 2016 report using supermarket location information from CACI Datalab and house price information from the UK Land Registry.

<doc id="668688" wikidata="Q4850880" url="?curid=668688" title="Baligant">
<text>In &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;, Baligant is the Emir of Babylon (i.e., Cairo, not the Mesopotamian Babylon), who brings an immense army to aid his vassal King Marsile (a.k.a. &quot;Marsillion&quot;) in defending Zaragoza (sometimes spelled &quot;Saragossa&quot;) from Charlemagne but is killed in the ensuing battle. He is sometimes described as a man from ancient times and is often seen as the parallel of Charlemagne, both being old, handsome and skillful with a sword. One might say they were equals, except that Charlemagne had the help of Saint Gabriel. The name &quot;Baligant&quot; is likely a folk-etymological rendering of Arabic or Turkish antroponymy.

Baligant&#x27;s banner is a dragon, and he also rides into battle with the banners of Tervagant and Apollo. These standards are guarded, it seems, by ten men of Canileu. In the midst of the battle, he cries out to these deities to succour him against Charles.

Baligant and Charles meet on the field as the day of battle turns to evening. They unhorse one another and rise with swords drawn to battle again, each sending blow after mighty blow upon the other&#x27;s shield. In the midst of their combat each advises the other to repent: Baligant requests Charles&#x27; servitude, while Charles tries to convert the admiral to Christianity. Baligant then strikes Charles&#x27; helm, exposing his skull. Charles, however, hearing the voice of St. Gabriel, finds the strength to strike back, dealing Baligant a deathblow to the helm. 

It has been suggested that the tale of the battle between Baligant and Charlemagne was inspired by tales of returning Norman mercenaries about the battle of Manzikert, reflecting the new danger arising in the East.

He carried a sword named Précieuse.

<text>Sara Moulton (born February 19, 1952) is an American cookbook author and television personality. In an article for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Kim Severson described Moulton as &quot;one of the nation’s most enduring recipe writers and cooking teachers...and a dean of food television and magazines&quot;.

Moulton was the on-air food editor for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, a morning news-and-talk show broadcast on the ABC television network, from 1997 through 2012. She was the chef of the executive dining room at &quot;Gourmet&quot; for 20 years, a stint that ended when the magazine ceased publication in 2009.

Between 1996 and 2005, Moulton hosted &quot;Cooking Live&quot; (1997–2002), &quot;Cooking Live Primetime&quot; (1999), and &quot;Sara&#x27;s Secrets&quot; (2002–2005) on the Food Network, becoming one of the original stars of that cable-and-satellite-television channel during its first decade. Her career in television and cooking has spanned nearly 40 years.

Moulton is the author of several cookbooks and videos, notably &quot;Sara Moulton Cooks at Home&quot; (2002), &quot;Sara&#x27;s Secrets for Weeknight Meals&quot; (2005), and &quot;Sara Moulton&#x27;s Everyday Family Dinners&quot; (2010).

In 1982, Moulton co-founded the New York Women&#x27;s Culinary Alliance.

Since 2008, Moulton has been the host of &quot;Sara&#x27;s Weeknight Meals&quot;, a cooking show distributed by American Public Television. From August 2012 through October 2018, Moulton was the author of a weekly cooking column for the Associated Press.

In October 2016, Moulton joined Christopher Kimball&#x27;s &quot;Milk Street Radio,&quot; a weekly show broadcast by National Public Radio, as a cohost.

Moulton was born in New York City, and attended The Brearley School in New York City.

The idea of channeling her childhood passion for food into a career did not occur to Moulton until after she graduated from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, with a major in the history of ideas.

Moulton enrolled at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, New York, in 1975 and graduated with highest honors in 1977, winning a scholarship from Les Dames d&#x27;Escoffier in the process.

==Career==
Her first restaurant job was as an intern under Chef Lydia Shire at the Harvest Restaurant in Cambridge, MA during the summer of 1976. After graduating from the CIA in the spring of 1977, Moulton returned to the Harvest as its sous chef, a job she held for nine months. In 1979, at the suggestion of Julia Child, Moulton undertook a postgraduate apprenticeship with Master Chef Maurice Cazalis of the Henri IV Restaurant in Chartres, France. From 1979 till 1981, she was the chef at Cybele&#x27;s, a Boston restaurant. 

After moving to New York in 1981, Moulton was hired as the &quot;chef tournant&quot; at La Tulipe, a three-star restaurant.

In the interest of starting a family, she left restaurant work and began devoting herself instead to recipe testing and development. Moulton worked for two years as an instructor at Peter Kump&#x27;s New York Cooking School (now known as the Institute of Culinary Education), where she discovered her love of teaching.

In 1984, she took a job in the test kitchen at &quot;Gourmet&quot;. Four years later she became chef of the magazine&#x27;s executive dining room.

===Television===
In 1979, Moulton&#x27;s television career began when she was hired to work behind the scenes on &quot;Julia Child &amp; More Company,&quot; a cooking program on PBS. Her friendship with Ms. Child led eventually to Moulton&#x27;s job at &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, where what started as another behind-the-scenes position ripened in 1997 into on-camera work.

By then, she had begun hosting the Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Cooking Live&quot;. Six years and over 1,200 hour-long shows later, that show ended on March 31, 2002. &quot;Sara&#x27;s Secrets,&quot; which began the next day, ran until 2007. “Sara Moulton is a chef, and one of the few people knowledgeable enough to field live phone-in queries, the basis of her show,&quot; wrote The New Yorker&#x27;s Bill Buford. &quot;Cooking Live&quot; was nominated as the James Beard Awards&#x27; Best National Television Cooking Show in 1999 and 2000.

The thirteenth season of &quot;Sara&#x27;s Weeknight Meals&quot; began airing on American Public Television in October 2024. The show was nominated for a James Beard Award in 2013 and 2015, while Moulton herself has been nominated three times as Outstanding Personality/Host, most recently in 2014.

=== Cookbooks and cooking columns ===
Her first cookbook, &quot;Sara Moulton Cooks at Home,&quot; was published by Broadway Books in October 2002, and was meant to counter America&#x27;s disastrous love affair with fast food by encouraging everyone to cook delicious and healthy food at home and to dine with family and friends. &quot;While rooted in classic French technique, the book also accommodates the American hunger for convenience, novelty and freshness,&quot; wrote Mike Dunne for &quot;The Sacramento Bee&quot;.

Moulton&#x27;s second cookbook, &quot;Sara&#x27;s Secrets for Weeknight Meals&quot;, was published by Broadway Books in October 2005. It was reviewed by Michelle Green in &quot;People&quot; magazine, who wrote: &quot;Sara has a gift for creating quick, accessible fine cuisine. Why suffer to make a gorgeous meal?&quot;

Her third cookbook, &quot;Sara Moulton&#x27;s Everyday Family Dinners&quot;, was published by Simon &amp; Schuster in April 2010. Blogging for &quot;StoveTop Readings&quot; in November 2010, Greg Mowery wrote: &quot;If there is a less pretentious, more accessible, and creative cookbook that gets great food on the table in good time with the least amount of fuss, I haven&#x27;t seen it this year….This new book belongs in every family kitchen.&quot;

Moulton&#x27;s fourth cookbook, &quot;Home Cooking 101: How to Make Everything Taste Better,&quot; was published by Oxmoor House in March 2016. Diana K. Rice, in The Huffington Post, described it as &quot;extremely useful to the home cook. [Looks] like a textbook, albeit...with fabulous food photos and enticing recipes.&quot;

In August 2012 Moulton began writing a weekly column entitled &quot;The Healthy Plate&quot; for the Associated Press. In January 2015, she replaced it with a new column called &quot;KitchenWise,&quot; which ran through October 2018. Between November 2016 and September 2018, Moulton contributed a monthly column called &quot;Sunday Supper&quot; to The Washington Post Magazine. From January 2018 through June 2021, Moulton contributed a quarterly column entitled &quot;Maize Graze&quot; to the University of Michigan&#x27;s Alumnus Magazine.

<doc id="668691" wikidata="Q6634946" url="?curid=668691" title="List of prisons in the United Kingdom">
<text>List of prisons in the United Kingdom is a list of all 141 current prisons as of 2024 in the United Kingdom spread across the three UK legal systems of England and Wales (122 prisons), Scotland, (15 prisons) and Northern Ireland (4 prisons). Also included are a number of historical prisons no longer in current use.

==Prisons, prison services, prison population and prisoner categories==
===England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland===
Public Sector prisons in England and Wales are managed by His Majesty&#x27;s Prison Service (HMPPS), which is part of the His Majesty&#x27;s Prison and Probation Service, an executive agency of the United Kingdom government. In addition, since the 1990s the day-to-day running of a number of previously existing prisons, as well as several new facilities, has been &quot;contracted out&quot; to private companies, such as Serco and G4S. All prisons in England and Wales, whether publicly or privately run, are inspected by His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Prisons. Prisons in Scotland are run by the Scottish Prison Service and prisons in Northern Ireland are run by the Northern Ireland Prison Service.

The following tables below list all current and some historical prisons and Young Offender Institutions in use in the three UK legal systems of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland as of 2022. The majority house adult males, and are operated by each legal systems respective public prison service, although a small number are operated by private prison companies. There are also a small number of adult female prisons and youth prisons/secure children&#x27;s units for those under 18.

===Population===

As of 2021, the total prison population of the UK (England &amp; Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland combined) stands at roughly 87,000, one of the largest in the Western world. With the increasing population, law changes resulting in longer prison sentences and a national government prison building program to build 20,000 more prison spaces by the mid 2020s the total UK prison population is expected to increase to almost 110,000 by 2026. 

===United Kingdom prisoner categories and establishment types===
In the UK adult prisoners are divided into 4 security categories (though male and female categories are slightly different) depending on certain factors such as the offences they have been convicted or accused of, their likelihood of attempting an escape, the threat they would pose if they escaped, their length of sentence, and any of their previous criminal convictions, if any. Male categories are as follows,

Category A – &#x27;Those whose escape would be highly dangerous to the public or national security&#x27;. Typically for example those convicted of offences such as murder, manslaughter, terrorism, rape, wounding with intent (GBH), robbery, serious firearm and explosives offences, offences against the state, those sentenced under the Official Secrets Act, or any attempts of those offences. There are a total of ten Category A prisons in the UK, eight are located in England and Wales, one in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. HM Prison Belmarsh is an example of a Category A prison. They are the equivalent of a supermax/maximum security prison in the United States for example.

Category B – &#x27;Those who do not require maximum security, but for whom escape still needs to be made very difficult&#x27;. Typically for those convicted of the same types offences as category A prisoners, but who are not judged to be as high risk or those who have served a long time as a category A prisoner with good behaviour/rehabilitation are sometimes downgraded to category B. HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs is an example of a Category B prison. They are the equivalent of a medium security prison in the United States for example.

Category C – &#x27;Those who cannot be trusted in open conditions but who are unlikely to try to escape&#x27;. Typically for those convicted of minor offences and who are serving shorter sentences no more than a few years in length. Also category B prisoners coming to the end of their sentence are sometimes downgraded to category C to prepare them for release. HM Prison Berwyn is an example of a Category C prison. They are the equivalent of a minimum security prison in the United States for example.

 Category D – &#x27;Those who can be reasonably trusted not to try to escape, and are given the privilege of an open prison&#x27;. Category D prisoners are held in &quot;Open Prisons&quot; in which they are trusted to be able to move freely around the prison without risk and who after completing a risk assessment may be allowed to work outside of the prison in the community or allowed short home visits for a set number of hours a week. Also category C prisoners coming to the end of their sentence are sometimes downgraded to category D to prepare them for release. HM Prison Ford is an example of a Category D prison. They are the equivalent of a minimum security work release prison or local jail in the United States for example.

Adult women in England and Wales are categorised with four slightly different types of security levels, from lowest to highest being Open, Closed, Restricted Status and Category A &#x27;. However Category A for women is rarely used due to the fairly low number of women being held for such serious offences, meaning most are held either in Closed or Restricted Status conditions. Northern Ireland operates a similar system to England and Wales. Scotland operates a separate three category system, from lowest to highest being Low, Medium and High Supervision (High Supervision being similar to Category A for adults in England, Wales and Northern Ireland).

Additionally whereas males and females aged 18 or over are held in dedicated adult prisons, those under 18 (and sometimes under 21) are held in one of three types of establishments across the country that are run by either the public prison service, private companies (such as G4S or Serco), local council authorities and in rare cases some charity providers. They are,

 Young Offender Institutions (YOIs) which are prison based establishments very similar to adult prisons that hold those convicted and remanded for offences but that only hold males aged 15-20 (ages 15-17 and ages 18-20 are housed separately) and who are not classed as vulnerable.

 Secure Training Centres (STCs) which are secure custody establishments but that focus more on things such as education, welfare, health and support rather than traditional prison style punishment. They hold convicted males aged 12-14 and females aged 12–17 in separate accommodation. Though males aged 15-17 can be held also if they are classed as vulnerable.

 Secure Children&#x27;s Homes (SCHs) which are similar to STC&#x27;s in that they mainly focus on things like education, welfare, health and support rather than traditional prison style punishment. They hold very young males and females aged 10–11 convicted or remanded usually for only serious offences. Though males and females aged 12-14 can be held also if they are classed as vulnerable. Additionally males and females all the way up to the age of 17 can be held if they are refused bail and remanded (but not yet convicted) to be held by local children&#x27;s authorities (and not the prison service) usually if they are more vulnerable, at risk or a YOI is not suitable. It should also be noted that not all children held in SCHs have necessarily been convicted, remanded or accused of crimes, some are held by court orders on safety grounds under legislation such as the Children Act 1989 due to things like their history of absconding from regular open children&#x27;s care homes, risk of committing harm to themselves or others, or those at high risk of vulnerability from things such as forms of abuse, illicit drugs use and child prostitution.

<text>Kollikodon is an extinct species of mammal, considered to be an early monotreme. It is known only from an opalised dentary fragment, with one premolar and two molars &quot;in situ&quot;, as well as a referred maxillary fragment containing the last premolar and all four molars. The fossils were found in the Griman Creek Formation at Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia. &quot;Kollikodon&quot; lived in the Late Cretaceous period, during the Cenomanian age (99–96 million years ago). Several other monotremes are known from the Griman Creek Formation, including &quot;Dharragarra&quot;, &quot;Opalios&quot;, &quot;Parvopalus&quot;, &quot;Steropodon&quot;, and &quot;Stirtodon&quot;.

==Etymology==
&quot;Kollix&quot; is an ancient Greek word (κολλίξ) for a bread roll. The strange teeth of &quot;Kollikodon&quot;, when seen from above, resemble hot cross buns, traditionally toasted and eaten on Good Friday. Originally, Michael Archer wanted to name it &quot;Hotcrossbunodon&quot;, but met disapproval from his associates.

== Description ==
Like &quot;Steropodon&quot;, &quot;Kollikodon&quot; was a relatively large mammal for the Mesozoic. The molars have a length of around 5.5 mm and a width of between about 4 and 6 mm. Based upon these data, the potential body length could be up to a metre. Assuming the accuracy of such a guess, &quot;Kollikodon&quot; would be a contender for the largest Mesozoic mammal known, along with other possible giants such as &quot;Repenomamus&quot;, &quot;Schowalteria&quot;, and &quot;Bubodens&quot;.

Aside from its size, it is difficult to say what &quot;Kollikodon&quot; looked like. It is certain that its teeth were specialised to crush food, being perhaps a shellfish-eater or herbivore. The description of the upper jaw showed that it was strongly specialised, with molars being subdivided into numerous rounded cuspules, some of which exhibit pits, possibly the result of crushing hard items.

== In museums ==
Both &quot;Kollikodon&quot; and &quot;Steropodon&quot; can be found at the Australian Museum in Sydney, along with Eric, the opalised pliosaur.

<text>The Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College is the graduate business school of Dartmouth College, a private Ivy League research university in Hanover, New Hampshire. The school offers only a Master of Business Administration degree program.

Founded in 1900, the Tuck School was the first institution in the world to offer a master&#x27;s degree in business administration, and is the second oldest Ivy League business school.

The Tuck School awards only one degree, the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree, through a full-time, residential program. Tuck is known for its rural setting and small class size — each MBA class consists of about 280 students. As such, both factors, combined with Tuck&#x27;s commitment to the full-time MBA program, contribute to its high giving rate among the 10,300 Tuck alumni across 73 countries. Almost 70% of all Tuck alumni regularly give to the school, the highest rate among business schools worldwide.

Graduates of the Tuck School of Business earn some of the highest salaries of MBA programs in the United States. MBA graduates of Tuck earned an average $170,000 first year compensation, not including performance-based bonuses or equity-based compensation, the third highest of all US-based MBA programs. Tuck&#x27;s MBA program ties for 9th place with MIT for the highest average GMAT score of 722 for its entering class.

== History ==
===Founding===

At the turn of the 20th century, Dartmouth College president William Jewett Tucker decided to explore the possibility of establishing a school of business to educate the growing number of Dartmouth alumni entering the commercial world. Additionally, Tucker was concerned about business leadership in a broad social sense, or, as he put it, &quot;training commensurate with the larger meaning of business&quot;, and so began soliciting interest among Dartmouth alumni.

Through a renewed friendship, Tucker enlisted the support of his former roommate from his undergraduate years at Dartmouth, Edward Tuck, who had since become a wealthy banker and philanthropist. Enthusiastically agreeing to help, on September 8, 1899, Edward Tuck donated an initial grant of $300,000 — in the form of 1,700 shares of preferred stock in the Great Northern Railway Company of Minnesota — to found and endow the Amos Tuck School of Administration and Finance, which was named in memory of Tuck&#x27;s father and Dartmouth alumnus, Amos Tuck. In January 1900, the Dartmouth Board of Trustees passed a vote to formally establish the school.

===The Tuck Pattern===
The new school&#x27;s tuition fee cost $100 for the few students who enrolled in the first year; graduates of the two-year program received a Master of Commercial Science degree (MCS). The curriculum involved both traditional liberal arts fields as well as economic and finance education. Specifically, the first-years were required to take Modern History, Economics, Political Science, Sociology, Foreign Language, and English Composition and Speaking; second-year courses included Modern History and Diplomacy, Finance, Transportation, Insurance, Law, Municipal Administration, Demography and Social Institutions, Language, and Practice Organizations.

Undergraduate Dartmouth professors taught most of the first-year courses at Tuck, while outside guest instructors and business-people, such as an export merchant, an attorney, an insurance company president, and an accountant, educated the second-year students. Edward Tuck, pleased with the breadth of experience found in the school&#x27;s instructors, wrote to Dartmouth president Tucker in February 1902, &quot;I am glad that it will be the aim of the school to bring students in touch with practical businessmen.&quot;

While other business programs tended to offer specialized technical courses linked neither to the liberal arts tradition nor to the broader purposes of business, Tuck maintained itself as a school of general management in the broadest liberal sense, to which a study by the Carnegie Corporation observed, &quot;The Tuck School probably went further than any other institution in the pre-war period in putting its work on a demanding intellectual level.&quot; Thus, the Tuck School&#x27;s emphasis on a broad education in general management was adopted by many other emerging business schools, and was dubbed the &quot;Tuck Pattern.&quot;

===Succession of leadership and expansion===
Students of the first class held their studies in the Hubbard House, located on North Main Street across the College Green. A year later, in 1901, Tuck donated an additional $100,000 to build the original Tuck Hall (now McNutt Hall). The school grew and prospered under the leadership of Frank H. Dixon, who served as the school&#x27;s first secretary and later left to join the Dartmouth economics department full-time in 1904, followed by Harlow Person, Tuck&#x27;s first dean, from 1904 through 1919. Person, in 1911, invited 300 leaders of industry, including Frederick Winslow Taylor — who later became a professor at Tuck — and Lillian Gilbreth, to a major conference on scientific management, which business historians consider the kick-off for what later became the worldwide scientific management movement.

Afterward, the school was led by a Tuck alumnus, William R. Gray, from 1919 through 1937. During this period of growth, Dartmouth president Ernest Martin Hopkins wrote often to Edward Tuck reflecting on the school&#x27;s flourishing alumni and faculty. In the late 1920s, Hopkins sought to unify the Tuck School by establishing a central campus, uniting the school&#x27;s academic and residential facilities. In order to do so, however, Hopkins had to receive permission to do so from Edward Tuck, as the documents of incorporation stipulated that the original Tuck Hall be used exclusively for a business school. Hopkins wrote to Tuck in July 1928, then 85 years old and living in France, outlining his reasons for the proposed move and asking permission to release Dartmouth from the stipulation regarding the use of the original Tuck Hall.

Edward Tuck, going above merely granting his permission, wrote back in August 1928, &quot;The success and growth of the school have gone far beyond our original expectations, and we have every reason to be proud of it. It would be a satisfaction to me to do it [that is, donate the funds] if I could, rather than have outside capital contribute to a work which thus far I have taken care of financially myself.&quot;

Tuck donated 600 shares of Chase National Bank, which was sold for $567,766 a couple months before the Black Tuesday crash at the start of the Great Depression. On the west side of the campus, Edward Tuck Hall was completed in 1930 and was flanked by two dormitories, Chase Hall and Woodbury Hall — named for two Dartmouth alumni, Salmon P. Chase and Levi Woodbury, respectively. Stell Hall, the dining facility adjacent to Chase Hall, was named after Tuck&#x27;s wife, Julia Stell. With the completion of the project, Tuck students now lived together and took classes together.

===Post-World War II changes===
In 1937, Herluf V. Olsen succeeded Gray as the dean of Tuck and led the school until 1951. During his tenure, Olsen created the joint Tuck-Thayer program between the business school and engineering school. In 1942, the school&#x27;s name changed to the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration, and under Dean Arthur P. Upgren&#x27;s leadership, who ran Tuck from 1952 to 1957, the degree program changed from the MCS to the modern Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1953.

Until the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Tuck School catered primarily to Dartmouth students, accepting undergraduates during their third year. Such students made up 90 percent of each class at Tuck. Under Dean Karl Hill, who led the school from 1957 to 1968, Tuck shifted its focus to soliciting a national student body to create a more diverse student body. In addition, Hill created the Tuck Associates program in 1964 to foster relationships between Tuck and the business community. By securing grants from the Sloan Foundation, Hill also brought in additional faculty to the school by setting up funding for summer research.

The expansion under Hill culminated in the creation of the school&#x27;s board of overseers as well as a full-time admissions office in the early 1960s. The resulting expansion in the late 1960s saw additional growth of the campus with the construction of a new dormitory and, through a generous donation made by Thomas G. Murdough, founder of Little Tikes, the Murdough Center, which contains the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library.

John Hennessey, who succeeded Hill as dean in 1968, continued to revamp the curriculum and recruit new faculty members. The Ford Foundation&#x27;s Gorden-Howell report and Carnegie Corporation&#x27;s Pierson report both singled out the Tuck School as having a serious academic curriculum, including newly emerging disciplines in quantitative and behavioral sciences, as well as organizational behavior and business policy.

Perhaps Hennessey&#x27;s most significant changes were his efforts to recruit minority students for the Tuck program. He served as the founding chairman of the Council for Opportunity in Graduate Management Education and visited dozens of schools to recruit minority students to Tuck. In 1964, Tuck admitted its first minority student and, in 1968, its first woman student.

===1970s to present day===
In 1971, Hennessey established the Tuck Annual Giving program, which, in its first year, drew $71,000 from the 27 percent of alumni who donated. In the same year, &quot;Tuck Today&quot;, the school&#x27;s alumni magazine was founded. By 1972, Tuck alumni clubs were established in major cities across the country, which helped establish Tuck&#x27;s role in Dartmouth&#x27;s first capital campaign. Hennessey also oversaw the founding of the Tuck Executive Program in 1974 alongside professor Kenneth Davis.

Under Deans Richard West, who served from 1976 to 1983, and Colin Blaydon (1983–1990), the school&#x27;s curriculum and faculty expanded extensively, and applications increased by one-third. Since the late 1980s, Tuck has continued to expand in student body and faculty size, and has seen the establishment of two new campus buildings as well as several research centers and non-degree business programs.

== Academics ==
===MBA Program===
The Tuck School offers a single degree: the two-year, full-time Master of Business Administration (MBA). Students may specialize within the MBA in fields such as finance or marketing, but a specialization is not required for graduation. First-year MBA students at Tuck undertake a 32-week core curriculum in general management and a specialized First Year Project. During their second year, students take 12 elective courses and design their own focused field of study. The school stresses a collaborative and teamwork-based approach to learning, which it touts as one of its assets for &quot;building the interpersonal skills required for business leadership.&quot; However, this emphasis on cooperative group learning has been criticized as too &quot;touchy-feely&quot; for students entering the competitive business world, and the emphasis on consensus-building as detrimental to students&#x27; ability to make quick, independent decisions.

In the past, The MBA program has held a top-10 ranking in multiple publications, including &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;Bloomberg&quot;, &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Business Insider&quot;, and &quot;Vault&quot;.

===Dual and Joint Degrees===
Students seeking other degrees can engage in one of many dual-degree or joint-degree programs offered in conjunction with other academic institutions:
* MBA/Master of Arts in Law and Diplomacy from The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University
* MBA/Master of Public Policy or Master of Public Administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University
* MBA/Master of Studies in Environmental Law from the Vermont Law School
* MBA/Master of Arts from the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University
* MD/MBA from the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth
* Master of Public Health/MBA from the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice
* Master of Engineering Management/MBA from the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth

The school also offers a variety of second-year exchange programs at other institutions such as the Handelshochschule Leipzig in Germany, the HEC School of Management in Paris, IESE Business School in Barcelona, and the London Business School.

Within Dartmouth, faculty from Tuck and The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice are partnering to offer a Master of Health Care Delivery Science degree from Dartmouth College. Moreover, Tuck partners with the Thayer School of Engineering to teach management courses through a Master of Engineering Management program offered by Thayer School of Engineering.

===Employment statistics===
95% of the Tuck MBA class of 2017 had jobs offers three months post graduation and 100% of those students found internships during the summer following the first year. The most popular career industries for graduates are management consulting (33%), financial services (20%), and technology (20%) with graduates&#x27; first year annual base salaries averaging $127,986 with a mean signing bonus of $30,208. According to the 2018 Financial Times M.B.A. report, Tuck currently ranks 10th in the world for average three year post-graduation salary at $172,735. This figure does not including bonuses or other forms of compensation.

According to Tuck&#x27;s published 2017 employment report, the top hiring companies for full time students in the class of 2016 were McKinsey &amp; Company (21), Bain &amp; Company (18), and Amazon (11). Similarly, the top hiring companies for the class of 2017 internships were McKinsey &amp; Company (16), Bain &amp; Company (11), and Amazon (10).

===Non-degree programs===
In addition to the MBA program, the school offers an array of executive education and other non-degree programs. In particular, Tuck offers the Tuck Business Bridge Program, a 4-week, intensive program for current and recently graduated university students seeking to build a foundation in core business concepts. There is also a Leadership Education and Development (LEAD) program for high school students. Tuck offers an Advanced Management Program for executives, which spans either one or two weeks depending on the course.

=== Organization and research ===

Like the undergraduate portion of Dartmouth College, the Tuck School operates on a quarter system. As part of the larger institution, the Tuck School is ultimately administered by Dartmouth&#x27;s President and Board of Trustees. The school is directly managed by a Dean (currently Matthew Slaughter) who is advised by a Board of Overseers that was established in 1951.

Since the Tuck School offers only one degree, it does not contain formal academic departments as do other institutions. Instead, faculty are generally grouped in one or more of seven &quot;academic areas&quot;: accounting, finance and economics, marketing, operations management and management science, strategy and management, international business, and management communication. Tuck is also home to five research centers which organize research in different fields of business administration. The centers are meant to promote faculty research, establish liaisons between the Tuck School and the corporate world, and sponsor programs for Tuck as a whole; MBA students are occasionally invited to participate as fellows and research associates. The five research centers are the William F. Achtmeyer Center for Global Leadership, the Center for Corporate Governance, the Center for International Business, the Center for Private Equity and Entrepreneurship, and the Glassmeyer/McNamee Center for Digital Strategies.

== Campus ==
The Tuck School is located on the campus of Dartmouth College, which is situated in the rural, Upper Valley New England town of Hanover, New Hampshire. The campus of the Tuck School sits in a complex on the west side of Dartmouth&#x27;s campus, near the Connecticut River. Shortly after being founded in 1900, Tuck was housed in a single building across from the Green at the center of the campus. In 1930, the institution moved into Stell, Chase, Tuck, and Woodbury Halls in its present location along the Tuck Mall. Today, these original structures serve as four of Tuck&#x27;s six academic and administrative buildings.

Tuck emphasizes its residential character, describing residential life as &quot;a foundation of the Tuck culture&quot; and crediting it as &quot;a reason that Tuck alumni are among the most loyal of all the business school [sic] in the world.&quot; Tuck&#x27;s isolated location has been described as an &quot;image problem&quot; for attracting successful applicants and faculty to its rural campus, although some students cite the insular location as a positive trait for fostering intimacy and friendship.

Currently, Tuck has five residential facilities: Buchanan Hall (constructed 1968), Whittemore Hall (constructed 2000), and Pineau-Valencienne Hall, Achtmeyer Hall, and Raether Hall (2008). The last three make up the new complex called the Tuck Living and Learning Complex that houses 95 additional students as well as classrooms and study space serves as the home for nearly half of first-year Tuck students. It was constructed in 2008 for around $27.2 million. The Tuck School shares the Murdough Center (containing the Feldberg Business and Engineering Library) with the adjacent Thayer School of Engineering. The Tuck campus is serviced by Byrne Hall, a dining facility operated by Dartmouth Dining Services.

== People ==

=== Students ===
Tuck students, known as &quot;Tuckies&quot;, typically number about 560 students in total — 280 per class — with international students making up about 37% of the student body. The school has a high percentage of women (44% vs. Harvard&#x27;s 41% and Columbia&#x27;s 41%) and has been recognized as having &quot;the best representation of women among top-tier M.B.A. programs&quot; alongside Wharton&#x27;s MBA program. This marks an 11% increase in female representation at Tuck from 2013. 23% of Tuck&#x27;s student body are domestic U.S. minorities, a relatively average figure when compared to HBS (28%) and MIT Sloan (15%). Tuck has addressed previous diversity shortcomings by offering additional scholarships to minority applicants and by promoting such programs as the annual Tuck Diversity Conference and participation in the Forté Foundation for women in business.

Like many other business schools, Tuck encourages its students to have post-undergraduate work experience before applying to the MBA program. The average incoming student has five years of full-time work experience, and the average student age is 28, ranging from 25 to 32 years.

=== Alumni ===

Tuck reports that they have approximately 10,300 living alumni living across 74 different countries. Tuck also claims the highest percentage of alumni donors of any business school in the world at about a 70% giving rate among its alumni. 2017 was the eleventh consecutive year in which greater than two thirds of all alumni have contributed to the school.

<doc id="668698" wikidata="Q3529500" url="?curid=668698" title="Graeme Hick">
<text>Graeme Ashley Hick (born 23 May 1966) is a Zimbabwean-born former England cricketer who played 65 Test matches and 120 One Day Internationals for England. He was born in Rhodesia, and as a young man played international cricket for Zimbabwe. He played English county cricket for Worcestershire for his entire English domestic career, a period of well over twenty years, and in 2008 surpassed Graham Gooch&#x27;s record for the most matches in all forms of the game combined. He was a part of the English squad which finished as runners-up at the 1992 Cricket World Cup.

He scored more than 40,000 first-class runs, mostly from number three in the order, and he is one of only three players to have passed 20,000 runs in List A cricket (Graham Gooch and Sachin Tendulkar are the others) and is one of only twenty-five players to have scored 100 centuries in first-class cricket. He is the only cricketer who scored first-class triple hundreds in three different decades (1988, 1997 and 2002). He is the second highest run scorer of all time after Graham Gooch, and the second highest century scorer after Jack Hobbs. Despite these achievements, he is commonly held to have underachieved in international cricket, a view based on comparison of Hick&#x27;s overall first-class batting average of 52.23 &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; his Test average of 31.32.

At one time Hick&#x27;s bowling was a significant force, and his off-spin claimed more than 200 first-class wickets. However, after 2001 he rarely bowled, and took only one first-class and two List A wickets; indeed, after the 2004 season he did not bowl a single ball in either form of the game. Throughout his career he was an outstanding slip fielder: Gooch wrote in his autobiography that his ideal slip cordon would comprise Mark Taylor, Ian Botham and Hick.

Hick was granted a benefit season by Worcestershire in 1999, which raised over £345,000;
he was also awarded a testimonial in 2006. Hick retired from county cricket at the end of the 2008 season, to take up a coaching post at Malvern College. For the remaining part of the season, he joined Chandigarh Lions of the Indian Cricket League.

==Early life==
Born in Salisbury, Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe) into a tobacco-farming family, Hick was at first more interested in hockey than cricket, and indeed went on to play for the national schools hockey team. He was also more of a bowler than a batsman, but in 1979 he began to make big scores regularly, averaging 185 for the school side. He suffered from a mild form of meningitis in 1980, but he nevertheless progressed to become captain of the national Junior Schools team, and before long to play for the Senior Schools side. He attended Prince Edward School.

Aged just 16, Hick played three minor one-day games for Zimbabwe Colts and Zimbabwe Country Districts against Young Australia in 1982–83. He had no success with the bat, being dismissed for 0, 2 and 1, although he did bowl Dean Jones in the second match at Mutare. Hick was included in the Zimbabwean squad for the 1983 World Cup, the youngest player ever to achieve such a status,
but was not selected to play in the tournament. The following Zimbabwean season, on 7 October 1983, Hick made his first-class debut for Zimbabwe against Young West Indies at Harare. Coming in at number eight in the first innings, he hit 28 not out to help set up a narrow three-wicket victory. Eight days later Hick made his List A debut against the same opponents, batting one place lower still and making 16* in a game decided (in Zimbabwe&#x27;s favour) on run rate.

On 7 December 1983, Hick took his maiden first-class wicket, bowling Sri Lanka Test batsman Susil Fernando while playing for Zimbabwe against a Sri Lanka Board President&#x27;s XI. Four days later, Hick made his maiden first-class fifty when he scored 57 against a Sri Lankan XI, and in March 1984 he achieved the same in a one-day match by hitting 62* against Young India – a performance for which he was named Man of the Match for the first time.
Looking back on this period two decades later, Steve Waugh considered that at 18 Hick was as good a player as anyone of that age in the history of cricket.

==Domestic career==

In 1984, Hick came to England on a scholarship from the Zimbabwe Cricket Union. For Worcestershire&#x27;s Second XI he was impressive: he twice took five wickets in an innings, and a prolific sequence of 195, 0, 170 and 186 gained him a first-team debut against Surrey in the last match of the 1984 County Championship. Worcestershire declared in their first innings, and Hick did not get to bat, but in the second – coming in at nine – he made 82*. He also played club cricket for Kidderminster in the Birmingham League. He hit 1,234 runs for the club that year, a Kidderminster record.

Hick spent the winter playing for Zimbabwe, his highest scores being 95 and 88 in separate matches against Young New Zealand. Hick&#x27;s good year in 1984 encouraged him to continue playing in England,
and in the English summer that followed, Zimbabwe toured England, and Hick played both for them and for his county. He enjoyed a successful season, ending with a batting average of 52.70, and scoring his first century: 230 for the Zimbabweans against Oxford University. This was to be the first of six successive English seasons in which Hick averaged more than fifty in first-class cricket.

Playing that winter in Zimbabwe, he made 309 in under seven hours in a minor match against Ireland, the highest score ever made in any form of cricket for either Zimbabwe or its predecessor Rhodesia.
The 1986 English season was the first year in which Hick was notably successful in the one-day game: he hit 889 List A runs that year at an average slightly over forty. 1986 also saw the 20-year-old Hick – newly capped by Worcestershire – become the youngest player to make 2,000 first-class runs in a season,
while in 1987, he was named as one of Wisden&#x27;s five Cricketers of the Year. He also had a highly successful season in one-day cricket as Worcestershire won the Refuge Assurance League, passing 1,000 List A runs for the only time, averaging over seventy in such games and making a one-day career-best 172* against Devon in the NatWest Trophy. By now Hick&#x27;s career first-class average was well over sixty, and excitement about his run-scoring ability was becoming enormous.

The following summer, Hick made a major contribution to his county&#x27;s first County Championship title since 1974. He became the first man since Glenn Turner, and only the eighth in history, to hit 1,000 first-class runs before the end of May,
with 410 of those runs coming in April alone, a record for that month until Ian Bell scored 480 in April 2005. In the first week of May he made his highest first-class score, 405 not out against Somerset, and at that point the thousand seemed almost inevitable. However, Hick&#x27;s next four innings totalled a mere 32, leaving him with the daunting task of making 153 runs in the last match of the month, against the touring West Indians at New Road. Hick did it on the first day, ending 172 not out and scoring a total of 1,019 runs before the end of May. In all that season he scored a career-best aggregate of 2,713 runs including ten first-class hundreds, matching the Worcestershire record set by Glenn Turner in 1970.
One of these, a 79-ball knock against Surrey in August, won the Walter Lawrence Trophy for the fastest century of the season. To cap it all, he was also named Player of the Year by the Professional Cricketers&#x27; Association.

In both 1987–88 and 1988–89 Hick spent his winters playing in New Zealand for Northern Districts. He was a great success, hitting ten centuries in all and averaging 63.61 in the former season and a startling 94.46 in the latter; in one game against Auckland he scored a first-class record 173 runs between tea and close of play. It was at this time that John Bracewell called him a &quot;flat-track bully&quot;, a comment which was to dog Hick throughout his England career.
Back in England, the 1989 season when Worcestershire retained the Championship (with Hick&#x27;s 26 wickets at under 20 the best return of his career) and, especially, the &quot;batsmen&#x27;s paradise&quot; 1990 season saw Hick continue to pile up the big scores. He scored well over 4,000 first-class runs in the two years combined and averaged 90.46 in 1990, his highest average in any English summer and overall second only to his aforementioned New Zealand season. He followed that up with a reasonably successful winter playing for Queensland, and in March 1991 scored 91 for Worcestershire against Zimbabwe at Harare, but already the public&#x27;s mind was firmly on the summer, when he would qualify to play for England.

By the time of his final matches for the England team in 2000–01, Hick had already spent one summer as captain of Worcestershire, a post which he held for three seasons (2000 to 2002 inclusive). He enjoyed the responsibility of captaincy, and was &quot;surprised and disappointed&quot; to be relieved of the position in favour of Ben Smith for the 2003 season.

Hick&#x27;s personal form during his captaincy was generally good, although his overall statistics in 2000 – the first time he had failed to reach 1,000 runs since 1984 – were depressed by his England travails; in the County Championship alone in those three summers he averaged 43.41, 60.43 and 52.58, and by making 200* at Durham he completed the set of having made first-class hundreds against all 17 other counties, both home and away. In one-day games the picture was somewhat more mixed, though in June 2001 he did make 155, his highest List A score for 14 years, against Hertfordshire in the C&amp;G Trophy.

Hick suffered badly from injuries at this time. He had missed the very end of the 2002 season with a broken thumb, and newly returned to the ranks for 2003 he endured a summer to forget. He began solidly enough, with two centuries and four fifties in his first 14 innings in all cricket, but in early June he broke his hand and was unable to play for six weeks.

At this point Hick was averaging 53 in first-class cricket, but the 13 innings he played after his return in late July produced only 246 runs, leaving him with a season&#x27;s average of just 33.50, his worst showing since the dark days of 1991. 2004, however, saw him return to form with a vengeance, his 1,589 first-class runs (at 63.56) his best aggregate since 1990 and the lowest of his four centuries being 158, and he was picked for the FICA World XI team in three one-day games against New Zealand in January 2005, these matches having List A but not ODI status.

The 2005 season saw Hick return to earth with a bump, enduring another very mixed year. A 176 and four further fifties in eight innings near the start of the summer was followed by an awful trot in which he batted 17 times without reaching 40, only 107 against Essex in the very last innings of the season saving his average from dropping below thirty for the first time ever. The following summer was much better, and he had the satisfaction first of scoring his hundredth century for Worcestershire, only the second man (after Boycott) since the war to achieve the feat for a single county;
and then of helping Worcestershire to promotion in the last game of the Championship season – his 500th first-class match – scores of 70 and 30* against Northamptonshire taking him past 1,000 runs for the season. The previous month he had signed a one-year extension to his county contract, having turned down an offer from Derbyshire. Hick commented: &quot;My heart has always been with Worcestershire and I very much look forward to the next 12 months.&quot;

In April 2007, just before Worcestershire&#x27;s 2007 campaign got underway, Hick said that despite being contracted only for the season, he did not want to retire at the end of the summer. He said, &quot;I am not looking at it as my last season ... a lot of people say you are a long time retired ... I am still one of the fitter members of the side and I love and enjoy what I do ... Why should I pack it in if I am contributing?&quot;

In June he became the 16th player to score 40,000 first-class runs,
and the following month he agreed another extension to his contract to keep him at New Road for the 2008 season. In 2008, he became the first player to play in more than 1200 games. When he caught Oliver Newby off Kabir Ali at Cheltenham on 30 July, he achieved the rare feat of 1000 catches in a career. He retired at the end of the 2008 season to take up a coaching post at Malvern College. During the following winter, he played for the Chandigarh Lions in the rebel Indian Cricket League.

==International career==
===Early days===
By the time the 1986 season was out, the possibility of Hick&#x27;s playing at Test level was being taken seriously, and the debate was shifting from whether he would play international cricket to which country he would represent. At the time, Zimbabwe seemed a long way from Test status, so he set himself instead to fulfil the residency requirements for England qualification, and despite an offer of a four-year qualification period from New Zealand he opted to take the longer path of a seven-year wait to play for his newly adopted home. By the time he became eligible, public interest in his seeming destiny as a great batsman for country as well as county was intense; David Lloyd was later to write that he doubted &quot;any cricketer [had] ever come into the international game burdened by such impossible expectations&quot;.
Hick&#x27;s Worcestershire teammate Graham Dilley had been in no doubt that he would succeed, perhaps ironically given what was to follow writing that Hick exerted &quot;psychological pressure on the bowlers, like Viv Richards or Javed Miandad.&quot;
Hick made his first appearances as an England batsman in a three-match One Day International series against West Indies, the first being played at Edgbaston on 23 May 1991. He made only 14 in a low-scoring game, but a few days later, in the third and final match of the series, he hit 86* and shared in a match-winning stand of 213 with Neil Fairbrother. The stage seemed set for Hick&#x27;s Test debut at Headingley on 6 June, and Hick was even pictured on the cover of the &quot;Radio Times&quot;.

He was given a hero&#x27;s reception by the crowd as he came out to bat, but a tortured 51 minutes later he was back in the pavilion having made only six, and he could do no better in the second innings. After further innings of 0, 43, 0, 19 and 1 he was dropped before the last match of the series. Although Worcestershire did win the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup (Hick&#x27;s 88 and three catches winning him the man of the match award in the final), and the Refuge Assurance Cup, in first-class cricket Hick finished with an average for the season of just 32.91, which remains his lowest in any English summer.

He then played all three Tests in New Zealand, but apart from a marathon bowling performance in the first innings at Wellington where he and Phil Tufnell shared 140 overs almost equally (Hick&#x27;s 69–27–126–4 was to be his best in Tests), he again had little to smile about. Considerably more enjoyable for him was the 1992 World Cup which immediately followed: England reached the final, thanks in no small part to Hick&#x27;s three half-centuries. The most important of these came in the semi-final against South Africa at the SCG. Although this game is now more often remembered for the rain-related fiasco which left South Africa needing an impossible 22 runs from one ball, it was Hick&#x27;s Man-of-the-Match-winning knock of 83 (in an innings where the second top score was 33) which made England&#x27;s victory possible in the first place. He could not replicate it in the final, being lbw to Mushtaq Ahmed for 17.
In 1992 Hick finally made a Test half-century, 51 against Pakistan, but as with the West Indian series he was dropped before the end of the summer. This time at least he scored heavily for Worcestershire, averaging nearly seventy for his county. This domestic form, together with his ability against spin bowling, secured Hick a place on the 1992–93 tour of India, and in a generally disastrous tour for England (they lost two Tests by an innings and the other by eight wickets) he was one of the very few bright spots; indeed, he topped both batting and bowling averages for his country, as well as scoring 249 runs in the six ODIs. The personal highlight for Hick was his long-awaited maiden Test hundred: 178 in the third Test at Bombay; he added another 47 in the second innings. He then scored 68 and 26 in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka which immediately followed. For his achievements in the subcontinent, he was named one of &quot;Indian Cricket&quot;″s five Cricketers of the Year in 1993.
===Successful years===
The Indian tour proved to be the start of by far the most successful period of Hick&#x27;s Test career. At the end of 1992 his average was a mere 18.06, but by the end of the South African series just over three years later it had improved to a very respectable 38.66; his average over those three years alone was an impressive 46.44. In the first ODI of 1993 Hick made 85, but in the first Ashes Test at Old Trafford, he was famously sledged by Merv Hughes, leading umpire Dickie Bird to ask him: &quot;What has that nice Mr Hick ever done to you?&quot; Hughes later commented that although he had been &quot;a bit OTT with Hick&quot;; he &quot;only sledged batsmen [he] respected&quot;.
Despite scores of 34, 22, 20 and 64, Hick – along with Mike Gatting – was dropped after the second Test at Lord&#x27;s; the decision amazed Shane Warne.
Hick was recalled for the sixth Test at The Oval and hit 80 and 36 in a 161-run England victory, giving him a series average of 42.66, behind only Gooch, Atherton and Thorpe among England&#x27;s specialist batsmen in a series in which England used 24 players.

A reasonable tour of the West Indies followed, although Hick narrowly failed to make a maiden hundred against this opposition when he was dismissed for 96 in the Jamaican Test, and did not make a fifty in five ODI innings. Then came two short series against New Zealand and South Africa; he played in all six Tests and reached double figures in all ten innings, although he was not particularly successful against New Zealand, with a top score of only 58. Against the South Africans, however, he averaged over sixty, making 110 in the Second Test and a match-winning 81* (at a run a ball) in England&#x27;s dash to victory in the Third. He played in three of the four ODIs and failed in two of them, but made another 81 against South Africa. He also helped Worcestershire to win the 1994 NatWest Trophy, sharing an unbroken partnership of 198 with Tom Moody in the final against a Warwickshire side which had swept the board with all the other domestic honours that year.

The 1994–95 Ashes series came to be known for one incident in particular. In the third Test at Sydney, England captain Mike Atherton had let it be known to his players that he intended to declare. Hick was nearing what would have been his first Ashes century, but Atherton felt he was scoring too slowly and that as a result the team were &quot;dawdling&quot;.
He took the decision to call the players in with Hick 98 not out. Hick was surprised and hurt not to be allowed to reach his hundred: Alec Stewart wrote later that his teammates &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe&quot; the decision, and he felt that it &quot;cost [England] dearly&quot;.
Atherton admitted in his autobiography that although he still felt the declaration had been justified in strictly cricketing terms, he would not have taken such a decision again.
Phil Tufnell felt similarly, saying that while there was a match to win, &quot;a few of [the team] were also very sorry for Hick.&quot;
Jonathan Agnew&#x27;s sympathies, however, lay with the captain, telling Atherton that his &quot;conscience should be clear&quot;.

Hick seemed to be overcoming his disappointment over the next few days, making a match-winning 91 in a World Series Cup ODI – a performance which lifted him to second behind only Brian Lara in the world rankings 
— and following up with 143 in a four-day game against Victoria. But he did not get a chance to make that Ashes century: a slipped disc ended his tour just before the fourth Test.
He never came so close to one again. Hick&#x27;s injury and the declaration affair overshadowed what up to that point had been a somewhat mixed series as far as the Tests had been concerned: in his other five innings he had been dismissed cheaply three times, but he had also made 80 at Brisbane.

West Indies visited in 1995, and Hick – an &quot;automatic pick&quot; for Atherton at this point in his career – enjoyed a good summer, averaging just over 50 in the Tests (despite being dropped for the fourth Test at Old Trafford), 
with the highlights being 118* at Trent Bridge (he had been told the previous day by Ray Illingworth that he had a &quot;soft centre&quot;) and then 96 and 51* in the final Test at The Oval. He also averaged over 50 in the County Championship, and took a career-best 5–18 against Leicestershire in early July. In the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, he scored three hundreds in five matches as Worcestershire reached the semi-final. In that game, Hick made 109 and took two wickets, but Lancashire won a close contest with four balls to spare.

That winter&#x27;s tour was to South Africa, and Hick made a superb hundred on the first day of the first Test at Centurion Park; Allan Donald later conceded that &quot;he hammered us&quot;.
He advanced his score to 141 the next day before falling lbw to Pollock, but appalling weather washed out the last three days of the game and the match was drawn. Hick, having reached his highest ever Test ranking of seventh, 
played in all five Tests and seven ODIs on that tour, but passed fifty only twice. The 1996 World Cup in the subcontinent immediately followed, but 85 against New Zealand was his only major contribution against top-class opposition.

===Back to the struggle===
Hick seemed set fair for another productive season in 1996, especially after making 215 for Worcestershire against the Indians in May, but it was not to be. His form completely deserted him as he could manage just 35 runs in four innings against India, and when he was dismissed cheaply twice in the first Test against Pakistan the selectors had had enough and he was dropped from both Test and ODI teams, not to be selected again for a year and a half. Back at Worcestershire, he scored unevenly: immediately after his being dropped by England he made 148 and 86 against Kent, but he then endured a run of ten innings in all cricket without making more than 30, before hitting 54 and 106 against Gloucestershire in the penultimate Championship game of the season.

For the first time since becoming eligible to play for England, Hick was omitted from the winter tour parties altogether, an omission particularly painful as the programme was to include not only a return to New Zealand but the first ever Tests between Zimbabwe and England. In the event Hick did play in the country, but only as part of Worcestershire&#x27;s own tour; he took six wickets in their match against a Matabeleland Invitation XI in what must have been a bittersweet experience. The 1997 English season was the first for seven years in which Hick had no international duties to perform, and he averaged 69 in scoring over 1,500 first-class runs, the highlight being an unbeaten 303 in the final match of the season against Hampshire, sharing in an unbroken third-wicket partnership of 438 with Tom Moody, an English record for that wicket
and a Worcestershire record for any wicket.
Hick was recalled to England duties for the Singer-Akai Champions Trophy ODI series at Sharjah in December 1997, and in April 1998 for just the ODI portion of the West Indies series. He played in nine games altogether, but though he got starts on several occasions he never reached fifty.

Hick began the 1998 season slowly and was left out of the England team at the start of the year, but he responded with four hundreds in successive first-class innings in late May and early June. Although this form left him somewhat thereafter, he was nevertheless selected for the final two Tests against South Africa. A total of nine runs from three innings left his hopes of a place on the Ashes tour looking extremely shaky, but after two half-centuries in ODIs and then 107 in the one-off Test against Sri Lanka it seemed he might have done just enough. However, his century was outshone by John Crawley&#x27;s 156 in the same innings and in the end it was the Lancashire man who got the nod. Hick was left at home, to console himself with the memory of the adulation of the Worcestershire crowd: in May at New Road he had made his hundredth first-class century. 

Just before the first Test, however, Hick received an emergency call-up – officially as &quot;reinforcement&quot; rather than a replacement – as Atherton was in severe pain from a chronic back problem (ankylosing spondylitis).
Hick ended up playing in four Tests, but he had a rather poor series overall, averaging 25, although his defiant 68 in a losing cause at Perth stuck in the memory and his 39 and 60 contributed significantly to England&#x27;s 12-run win at Melbourne (even if Dean Headley&#x27;s 6–60 was more remarked upon). In the ODIs against both Australia and Sri Lanka Hick did much better, making more than 500 runs – including a fine run of 108, 66*, 126* and 109 in successive innings – and being named England&#x27;s Man of the Series.

The 1999 World Cup was held in England, and after Hick&#x27;s ODI achievements in Australia Allan Donald felt he would be the home team&#x27;s danger man.
David Lloyd also &quot;strongly fancied [Hick] to have a serious influence&quot; on the competition, but he was frustrated by Hick&#x27;s reluctance to accept a flexible batting order, only with considerable difficulty at a &quot;frosty team meeting&quot; getting him to agree to drop down from three when required.
Despite Hick&#x27;s uneasiness over the issue, and England&#x27;s general incompetence in the tournament, he averaged 53 – second only to Nasser Hussain, the only one of his teammates to average more than 30. Frustratingly for Hick, the series against New Zealand that followed contained no one-dayers at all, and he was picked for only the third of the four Tests, making 12 in his only innings. It was no real surprise that he was picked for only the ODI part of the winter tour to South Africa and the short ODI series in Zimbabwe which followed. He failed badly in South Africa (averaging a desperate 12.40) and by the time the Zimbabwe leg of the tour began he had not reached 30 in nine successive innings, by far the worst run of his ODI career, but 87*, 13 and 80 (as well as an international career-best 5–33 in the last game) against the Zimbabweans rescued his winter.

The 2000 Test series against West Indies began with humiliation both for England, who lost by an innings inside three days at Edgbaston, and for Hick, who made his only Test pair. Things improved for the team thereafter, with England recovering to win the series 3–1, but Hick&#x27;s real influence was limited to the fourth Test at Headingley, where his 59 (from number eight, as Andy Caddick had come in ahead of him as night-watchman) and his stand of 98 with Michael Vaughan rescued England from 124/6 and paved the way for Caddick&#x27;s extraordinary burst of 5–14 and England&#x27;s own victory inside two days. In the ODIs Hick had a very mixed summer, sharing in two century partnerships but averaging barely 25 with a top score of 50 in seven games. It was the beginning of the end for his international career.

===Retirement===
On what was to prove his last winter tours for England, of Kenya, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Hick played five Tests and six ODIs, but only twice were his contributions of real value. In an ODI at Karachi he came in at 13/2 and put on 114 with Hussain, then in the deciding Test at the same venue his 40 gave vital support to Graham Thorpe (64*) as England clinched a nail-biting win in the face of Pakistani delaying tactics and light so bad that Alec Stewart said they &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have played in light like that for club games&quot;.
Despite these bright spots, overall Hick&#x27;s winter had been far from a success, and the Test series ended in early March with scores of 0 and 16 at Kandy. He took the field in Colombo only as a substitute, but still managed to incur a one-match suspended ban for sledging.
It was irrelevant: he never played Test cricket again. Later that month he played in the three ODIs against Sri Lanka, and in the last of them he top scored with 46. England, though, were crushed by ten wickets, and Hick&#x27;s international playing days were at an end.

==Post retirement==
Hick was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. He said, &quot;I am very honoured with the award. It was not something I expected or set out to achieve. You dream of things and after 25 years it is nice to have that sort of recognition.&quot;

In January 2014, Hick was appointed high performance coach at Cricket Australia&#x27;s centre of excellence. 
In September 2016, Hick was promoted to the role of Batting Coach of the Australian side. In June 2020, Hick was made redundant as batting coach, a result of cost-cutting measures made by Cricket Australia due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Assessment==

Hick&#x27;s inability to replicate in Test cricket on a consistent basis the form which he had shown for his county was and remains the subject of much debate. Steve Waugh, in his autobiography, theorised that county cricket attacks, which Hick regularly &quot;carved up&quot;, &quot;were (in fact) a dangerous impediment to his improvement, because any technical weakness went largely untested&quot;, due to these attacks being of a &quot;largely innocuous&quot; nature. Indeed, much of the criticism aimed at him has been on the subject of perceived technical flaws in his game: Atherton felt as early as 1991 that Hick was &quot;good, but not in the Lara or Tendulkar class&quot;, and that his technique was flawed, allowing &quot;little give in his hands and no touch in his shots&quot;, although by the mid-1990s he had adjusted to an &quot;altogether more fluid and natural&quot; style.
Many writers adjudged Hick, in Christopher Martin-Jenkins&#x27; words, &quot;suspect against the short ball&quot;,
and Allan Lamb felt that the one-bouncer-per-over regulation in force in county cricket in the early 1990s hindered Hick too,
despite the fact that Wasim Akram believed that the introduction of a similar rule in Test cricket had been specifically for Hick&#x27;s benefit.
(Hick&#x27;s performance in Tests against Pakistan was far worse than against any other nation.)
Alec Stewart&#x27;s analysis was that Hick &quot;didn&#x27;t get out all that much&quot; to the short ball, but nevertheless &quot;didn&#x27;t play it as confidently as other shots&quot;, because his height (6&#x27;3&quot;) made him uncertain as to whether to duck or attack the bouncers.
Dickie Bird&#x27;s opinion was that &quot;the positioning of his feet [was] all wrong ... and that [threw] his head and eyes off line&quot;.

Hick&#x27;s mental approach to the game is the other main weapon in his critics&#x27; armoury, and indeed Hick himself admitted to seeking psychological help after having failed. 
Prior to Hick&#x27;s England debut Graham Dilley was bullish, claiming that Hick was &quot;a lot tougher than people realise&quot;,
but Ian Botham, another Worcestershire teammate, noticed &quot;the amount of reassurance [Hick] seemed to need from others around him&quot;
and Peter Roebuck, in a famous piece in the 1999 &quot;Wisden&quot;, said that it was &quot;Hick&#x27;s fate to be given an ability that did not suit his temperament&quot;.

Jonathan Agnew felt his body language against Curtly Ambrose back in 1991 had been poor, and had almost invited his dismissal,
and Atherton wrote that if Hick had indeed failed to do justice to his talent, it was surely &quot;down to a vital missing ingredient in his mental make-up&quot;. Waugh appears to link this &#x27;missing ingredient&#x27; to his dominance in county cricket, stating that &quot;prior to his Test debut his capacity to overcome hardship was never called upon&quot;. Waugh also cites the aforementioned 1995 declaration by Michael Atherton as a possible reason for Hick&#x27;s lack of success in Test cricket, stating that &quot;just as Hick&#x27;s ... gifts were about to re-emerge, in stepped ... Atherton to extinguish the flame.&quot;
George Dobell was tougher, stating bluntly that Hick &quot;should have been strong enough to cope&quot;.

Some felt that Hick was the victim of poor man-management, and Hick himself let his feelings slip in 2002, when asked who had been his best coach. &quot;That&#x27;s the trouble,&quot; he replied. &quot;There haven&#x27;t been any.&quot;
Shane Warne felt he was &quot;a classic example of a player who [had] really been messed around&quot;,
and Ian Botham complained that when England had failed it always seemed to be &quot;Hicky&#x27;s neck [that was] the first on the line&quot;,
although the journalist Leo McKinstry criticised Botham&#x27;s &quot;noisy advocacy of Hick in the face of all the evidence&quot;.

Ray Illingworth&#x27;s treatment of Hick has also come under considerable scrutiny. Botham considered Illingworth to be &quot;totally out of touch with the modern game&quot;,
while the 1995 incident mentioned briefly above, when Illingworth told Hick he had &quot;a soft centre&quot; because of his &quot;mollycoddled upbringing&quot;, made even Atherton wince at his bluntness.
(Hick, told by Illingworth to &quot;go out and prove [him] wrong&quot;, went on to score 118* against West Indies the following day.) However, Illingworth himself, while considering that Hick, along with Mark Ramprakash, was &quot;intense, too much so for [his] liking&quot;, did allow that the length of time Hick had had to wait to qualify for England was a factor in his becoming &quot;much more set in his ways than an inexperienced batsman.&quot;
Hick&#x27;s ODI statistics are considerably better than his equivalent Test figures, and his eventual career average of 37.33 is higher than any of Gooch, Thorpe and Gower. Indeed, for a period of more than two years from February 1994 Hick was never ranked lower than tenth in the world ODI rankings, and at the time of his omission from the one-day team halfway through 1996 he was rated number six. Even for the final two years of his ODI career, he was always ranked in the top twenty.

In this form of the game, he could destroy even the best: Andrew Flintoff recalled an innings of 65 against Pakistan at Sharjah in 1999 when Hick &quot;was murdering&quot; the &quot;seriously rapid&quot; Shoaib Akhtar: &quot;If he dropped short, he pulled him and if [he] bowled full, he was driven.&quot;
Calls for Hick&#x27;s recall to the one-day team continued long after his Test career had been given up as a lost cause: Kent captain Matthew Fleming said in September 2001 that Hick was &quot;still the best one-day batsman in the country&quot;
and as late as 2004 Andrew Miller would write: &quot;whisper it softly, there is &quot;still&quot; a case for his inclusion in the one-day squad&quot;.
Hick himself still felt in early 2002 that he could &quot;offer more in the one-day environment than the majority of people playing in the side&quot;.

Despite his difficulties, Hick&#x27;s cricketing contemporaries have generally been quite complimentary about him. Atherton &quot;liked and respected&quot; him,
while Andrew Flintoff, as a newcomer to the England side, remembered Hick as &quot;being good to [him] during those early stages [of Flintoff&#x27;s Test career]&quot;.
As a batsman, Allan Donald wrote that Hick was &quot;highly rated by the South African guys&quot;.
and Warne called him &quot;purely and simply a quality player&quot;. Steve Waugh said that Hick &quot;had as much talent as any player I ever came across.&quot;
David Lloyd noted, not altogether with approval, that other players would rally around Hick protectively, and that &quot;in Alec Stewart he had a man who would champion his cause endlessly&quot;.
Stewart himself wrote that Hick was &quot;someone whose talents [he] admire[d] greatly&quot;.

Botham summed up the unending nature of the debate when he wrote: &quot;I have no answers. All I can do is wonder how much more English cricket might have got out of Graeme Hick had he been handled differently. I know he does as well.&quot;
As for Hick himself, he was asked after the end of his England career whether he considered himself a success or a failure. His answer: &quot;a bit of both&quot;.

<text>The Free Choice 2008 Committee is an entity chaired by chess champion Garry Kasparov and dedicated to an unconditional adherence to fundamental democratic values.

To this end, they have issued a declaration protesting what they see as a drift toward autocracy by the presidential regime of Vladimir Putin.
...the presidential regime has reduced both chambers of the Russian parliament to the condition of puppets, and has turned the prosecutor’s office and court into an instrument of blackmail and political repressions. For the sake of power the Kremlin has trampled the principle of inviolability of private property, imposed illegal taxes on business, and divided entrepreneurs into &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;good&quot; depending on their submission and readiness to support the president’s political projects.

<doc id="668700" wikidata="Q421873" url="?curid=668700" title="Erythritol">
<text>Erythritol (, ) is an organic compound, the naturally occurring achiral meso four-carbon sugar alcohol (or polyol). It is the reduced form of either D- or L-erythrose and one of the two reduced forms of erythrulose. It is used as a food additive and sugar substitute. It is synthesized from corn using enzymes and fermentation. Its formula is , or HO(CH2)(CHOH)2(CH2)OH.

Erythritol is 60–70% as sweet as table sugar. However, erythritol is almost completely noncaloric and does not affect blood sugar or cause tooth decay. Japanese companies pioneered the commercial development of erythritol as a sweetener in the 1990s.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;erythritol&quot; derives from the Greek word for the color red (&quot;erythros&quot; or ). That is the case even though erythritol is almost always found in the form of white crystals or powder, and chemical reactions do not turn it red. The name &quot;erythritol&quot; is adapted from a closely-related compound, erythrin, which turns red upon oxidation.

==History==
Erythritol was discovered in 1848 by the Scottish chemist John Stenhouse and first isolated in 1852.

Starting from 1945, American chemists applied newly-developed techniques of chromatography to sugarcane juice and blackstrap molasses, finding in 1950 that erythritol was present in molasses fermented by yeast.

It was first approved and marketed as a sweetener in Japan in 1990, and in the US in 1997.

==Occurrence==
Erythritol occurs naturally in some fruit and fermented foods.

==Uses==

Since 1990, erythritol has had a history of safe use as a sweetener and flavor-enhancer in food and beverage products and is approved for use by government regulatory agencies in more than 60 countries.

Beverage categories for its use are coffee and tea, liquid dietary supplements, juice blends, soft drinks, and flavored water product variations, with foods including confections, biscuits and cookies, tabletop sweeteners, and sugar-free chewing gum. The mild sweetness of erythritol allows for a volume-for-volume replacement of sugar, whereas sweeter sugar substitutes need fillers that result in a noticeably different texture in baked products.

==Absorption and excretion==
Erythritol is absorbed rapidly into the blood, with peak amounts occurring in under two hours; the majority of an oral dose (80 to 90%) is excreted unchanged in the urine within 24 hours.

==Safety==

In 2023, the European Food Safety Authority reassessed the safety of erythritol and lowered the recommended daily intake limit to 0.5 grams per kg body weight, which equates to 35 g for an average adult (70 kg). The lower limit was set to &quot;safeguard against its laxative effect and to mitigate against long-term effects, such as electrolyte imbalance arising from prolonged exposure to erythritol-induced diarrhea.&quot;

Previously, in 2015, scientists assessed doses for erythritol where symptoms of mild gastrointestinal upset occurred, such as nausea, excess flatus, abdominal bloating or pain, and stool frequency. At a content of 1.6% in beverages, it was not considered to have a laxative effect. The upper limit of tolerance was 0.78 and 0.71g/kg body weight in adults and children respectively.

In the United States, erythritol is among several sugar alcohols that are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for food manufacturing.

==Dietary and metabolic aspects==
===Caloric value and labeling===
Nutritional labeling of erythritol in food products varies from country to country. Some places, such as Japan and the European Union (EU), label it as zero-calorie.

Under Food and Drug Administration (FDA) labeling requirements in the United States, erythritol has a caloric value of 0.2 calories per gram (95% less than sugar and other carbohydrates).

===Human digestion===
In the body, most erythritol is absorbed into the bloodstream in the small intestine and then for the most part excreted unchanged in the urine. About 10% enters the colon. 

In small doses, erythritol does not normally cause laxative effects and gas or bloating, as are often experienced after consumption of other sugar alcohols (such as maltitol, sorbitol, xylitol, and lactitol). About 90% is absorbed before it enters the large intestine, and since erythritol is not digested by intestinal bacteria, the remaining 10% is excreted in the feces.

Large doses can cause nausea, stomach rumbling, and watery feces. Doses greater than 0.66 g/kg body weight in males and greater than 0.8 g/kg body weight in females cause laxation, and doses over cause diarrhea. Rarely, erythritol can cause allergic hives (urticaria).

===Blood sugar and insulin levels===
Erythritol has no effect on blood sugar or blood insulin levels, and therefore may be used as a sugar substitute by people with type 2 diabetes. The glycemic index (GI) of erythritol is 0% of the GI for glucose and the insulin index (II) is 2% of the II for glucose.

===Oral bacteria===
Erythritol is tooth-friendly; since it cannot be metabolized by oral bacteria, it does not contribute to tooth decay. In addition, erythritol, like xylitol, has antibacterial effects against streptococci bacteria, reduces dental plaque, and may be protective against tooth decay.

==Manufacturing==
Erythritol is manufactured by using enzymatic hydrolysis of the starch from corn to generate glucose. Glucose is then fermented with yeast or another fungus to produce erythritol. A genetically-engineered form of the yeast &quot;Yarrowia lipolytica&quot; has been optimized for erythritol production by fermentation by using glycerol as a carbon source and high osmotic pressure to increase yields up to 62%.

==Chemical properties==
===Heat of solution===
Erythritol has a strong cooling effect (endothermic, or positive heat of solution) when it dissolves in water, which is often compared with the cooling effect of mint flavors. The cooling effect is present only when erythritol is not already dissolved in water, a situation that might be experienced in an erythritol-sweetened frosting, chocolate bar, chewing gum, or hard candy. The cooling effect of erythritol is very similar to that of xylitol and among the strongest cooling effects of all sugar alcohols. Erythritol has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 13.903 at 18 °C.

==Biological properties==
According to a 2014 study, erythritol functions as an insecticide toxic to the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, impairing motor ability and reducing longevity even when nutritive sugars were available.

Erythritol is preferentially used by the &quot;Brucella&quot; spp. The presence of erythritol in the placentas of goats, cattle, and pigs has been proposed as an explanation for the accumulation of &quot;Brucella&quot; bacteria found at these sites.

==Synonyms==
In the 19th and the early 20th centuries, several synonyms were in use for erythritol: erythrol, erythrite, erythoglucin, eryglucin, erythromannite and phycite. Zerose is a tradename for erythritol.

<doc id="668703" wikidata="Q6738242" url="?curid=668703" title="Major Major Major Major">
<text>Major Major Major Major is a fictional character in Joseph Heller&#x27;s 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot;. He was named &quot;Major Major Major&quot; by his father, as a joke – passing up such lesser possibilities as &quot;Drum Major, Minor Major, Sergeant Major, or C Sharp Major&quot;. Once he joined the army during World War II, he was quickly promoted to the rank of Major due to &quot;an I.B.M. machine with a sense of humor almost as keen as his father&#x27;s&quot;. His full name and rank are the title of chapter 9. He has an uncanny resemblance to real-life actor Henry Fonda, which scholar Philip D. Beidler calls &quot;one of the novel&#x27;s great absurd jokes&quot;.

==In the novel==
Heller echoes the eponymous character in Edwin Arlington Robinson&#x27;s 1910 poem &quot;Miniver Cheevy&quot; in his initial description of Maj. Major as &quot;born too late and too mediocre&quot;. The character is further described as having &quot;three strikes against him from the beginning – his mother, his father, and Henry Fonda, to whom he bore a sickly resemblance almost from the moment of his birth. Long before he even suspected who Henry Fonda was, he found himself the subject of unflattering comparisons everywhere he went. Total strangers saw fit to deprecate him, with the result that he was stricken early with a guilty fear of people and an obsequious impulse to apologize to society for the fact that he was not Henry Fonda.&quot; After his promotion to squadron commander by Colonel Cathcart, &quot;People who had hardly noticed his resemblance to Henry Fonda before now never ceased discussing it, and there were even those who hinted sinisterly that Major Major had been elevated to squadron commander because he resembled Henry Fonda. Captain Black, who had aspired to the position himself, maintained that Major Major really was Henry Fonda &quot;but was too chickenshit to admit it.&quot;

==Inspiration==
Working from the basis of a resemblance to Henry Fonda, and from the thesis that people in the novel were, contrary to Heller&#x27;s claims, heavily inspired by people and events from his own wartime experiences, Daniel Setzer deduces that the real-world inspiration for the character of Maj. Major was Randall C. Casada, who was Heller&#x27;s squadron commander when he was stationed on Corsica.

Whether intentionally or not, Maj. Major&#x27;s wartime career resembles Henry Fonda&#x27;s own, in that Fonda, after transferring to service HQ in New York City, was abruptly promoted to Lieutenant Junior Grade in a style similar to that of Maj. Major&#x27;s promotion. 

==In other media==
Maj. Major was portrayed by Bob Newhart in Mike Nichols&#x27; 1970 film adaptation of the novel. Beidler asks, rhetorically, what to make of this, given that Newhart&#x27;s lack of any resemblance to Fonda eliminates the entire joke. He provides one answer, namely that the joke was simply discarded because Henry Fonda himself no longer physically resembled the Henry Fonda of the 1955 film &quot;Mister Roberts&quot;, let alone the Fonda of World War II.

Maj. Major was portrayed by Lewis Pullman in the 2019 miniseries based on the novel. His promotion was to enable his attendance at the Group Leaders&#x27; Allocation and Requisition Procedural Advisory Board (GLARPAB) meetings.

==Literary analysis==
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Professor of Literature Alan Nadel observes that Maj. Major is &quot;perhaps the exemplary null set in the novel&quot;. Everything about the character, he states, signifies nothing: The character&#x27;s name is an empty repetition of &quot;the name of authority&quot;. The character&#x27;s promotion to squadron commander is meaningless. (&quot;&#x27;You&#x27;re the new squadron commander,&#x27; Colonel Cathcart had shouted rudely across the railroad ditch to him. &#x27;But don&#x27;t think it means anything, because it doesn&#x27;t. All it means is that you&#x27;re the new squadron commander.&#x27;&quot;) Even the character&#x27;s physical identity is not his own, but rather that of Henry Fonda. Beidler describes him as &quot;the ultimate product &quot;of&quot; and operational cog &quot;in&quot; the &quot;Catch-22&quot; machine&quot; and &quot;the definitive good Joe in a bad situation&quot;.

Relating &quot;Catch-22&quot; characters to William J. Goode&#x27;s sociological definition of ineptitude, Jerry M. Lewis and Stanford W. Gregory describe Maj. Major as the &quot;clearest portrayal of an inept role&quot; in the novel. They give three reasons for this: Maj. Major &quot;always followed the rules, yet no-one liked him or trusted him&quot;; his swift promotion to the rank of Major where he then remains is &quot;a clear foreshadowing of the Peter Principle&quot;; and the anathema to Maj. Major of being identified with Fonda, a symbol of competence, causes Maj. Major to retreat from everyone around him, making efforts to hide and to become, in the novel&#x27;s words, a recluse in &quot;the midst of a few foreign acres teeming with more than two hundred people&quot;. Lewis and Gregory state that &quot;Catch-22&quot; supports a thesis that goes beyond Goode&#x27;s, namely that the inept can identify their own ineptitude, and become active participants in its own institutionalization; whereas Goode asserts that the inept only ever have a passive role and can do little but accept their lot in life.

Stephen W. Potts, a lecturer in literature, describes chapter 9 of the novel as making &quot;broad use of the rhetorical motifs of contradiction, negation, and deflation&quot;, from the echolalia of the chapter title (&quot;Major Major Major Major&quot;) onwards. Potts also discusses Maj. Major&#x27;s father.

<text>Cheryl Lau Sang (born 5 August 1951), known professionally as Samantha Sang, is an Australian singer. She had an earlier career as a teenage singer under the stage name Cheryl Gray, before adopting the stage name she is more widely known as in 1969. She first received nationwide recognition in Australia in 1967, after releasing the top ten single &quot;You Made Me What I Am&quot;.

By 1969, Sang relocated to the United Kingdom, where she worked with the Bee Gees, before returning to Australia in 1975. She reconnected with the Bee Gees in 1977 and had an international hit with their song &quot;Emotion&quot;, peaking at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number two in Australia and number eleven in the United Kingdom. The single&#x27;s parent album, &quot;Emotion&quot; (1978), reached the top thirty on &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and included two other singles.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Sang was born to Reg and Joan (née Clarke) Sang in Melbourne, Australia, the great-great-granddaughter of a Chinese herbalist and surgeon. Both parents were 1940s &quot;Radio Revue&quot; singers. Her father ran a singing school and performed professionally as Reg Gray. Sang began her career at the age of eight, as Cheryl Gray, by singing on Australian radio and entered and won talent contests. Her first performance on television was at the age of eleven.

===1966-1974: First recordings===
In December 1966, she released her debut single, &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (not to be confused with fellow Australian Russell Morris&#x27; 1969 hit song &quot;The Real Thing&quot;), under the name &quot;Cheryl Gray&quot;. It was issued by EMI Records on its HMV label and was quickly followed by her second single, &quot;In a Woman&#x27;s Eyes&quot;.

Her third single, &quot;You Made Me What I Am&quot;, was released in May 1967 and reached number eight on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; Top 40. Teen magazine, &quot;Go-Set&quot; ran a poll in August for pop performers and Gray was voted third in the &#x27;Top Girl Singer&#x27; category behind Lynne Randell and Bev Harrell. Sang released three more singles on HMV but none charted. She became a singer on Australian television, but she felt her career was limited if she remained in Australia. In 1969, Sang travelled to the United Kingdom where Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees heard her singing and urged his manager, Robert Stigwood, to sign her. Under Stigwood&#x27;s management she changed her name to &quot;Samantha Sang&quot;. Gibb co-wrote &quot;Love of a Woman&quot; with his brother Maurice. Sang&#x27;s version – with Barry Gibb supplying backing vocals, guitar and producing – was released in August. It was a minor hit in some European countries.

Sang followed with &quot;Nothing in the World Like Love&quot; written by UK pop singer-songwriter Labi Siffre. Visa restrictions forced her out of the UK and she returned to Australia.

===1975-1990s: Mainstream success===
By 1975, Sang had changed management and signed with Polydor which released three singles and her debut album, &quot;Samantha Sang and Rocked the World&quot;.

In 1977, she recorded &quot;When Love Is Gone&quot;, the theme song for French drama film &quot;Bilitis&quot;.

She visited Barry Gibb in France whilst the Bee Gees were recording songs for the &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; soundtrack. A new song, &quot;Emotion&quot;, was written for her by Barry and Robin Gibb. The single was co-produced by Barry with the Bee Gees&#x27; production team of Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson. Released in 1978, with backing vocals by Barry, it showcased a softer style and became a major hit worldwide. It reached number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in March 1978, and earned a platinum record. It peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart and at number two on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart.

Her following album, &quot;Emotion&quot;, although not produced by Barry Gibb, included a version of &quot;Charade&quot;, a little-known Bee Gees&#x27; song from their 1974 album &quot;Mr. Natural&quot;. &quot;Emotion&quot; peaked at No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and achieved a gold record in March 1978. Determined to succeed on her own merits, Sang did not record another Gibb song to capitalise on her success, but chose a disco track, &quot;You Keep Me Dancing&quot;, as her next single. It peaked at No. 56 on the US Hot 100 (NZ # 21, Canada AC #10) and was followed into the charts by her cover of Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;In the Midnight Hour&quot;.

She recorded a cover of Eric Carmen&#x27;s Top 20 single, &quot;Change of Heart&quot;, featured as the B-side of &quot;You Keep Me Dancing&quot;. Her third album, &quot;From Dance to Love&quot;, was released by United Artists in 1979.

===1999-present: Later years===
In 1999, residing again in Melbourne, Sang made a short return to live performing, with her father Reg as guest vocalist. In 2004, Sang&#x27;s three albums were released for the first time on CD in a two-piece set as the compilation &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;.

<text>The River des Peres (French: &quot;rivière des Pères&quot;) () is a metropolitan river in St. Louis, Missouri. It is the backbone of sanitary and storm water systems in the city of St. Louis and portions of St. Louis County. Its largest tributaries are Deer Creek and Gravois Creek. At St. Louis, the river has a mean annual discharge of 79 cubic feet per second.

==Location==

;Mouth: Confluence with the Mississippi River near River City Casino, St. Louis: 
;Source: Creve Coeur, Missouri: The River Des Peres is sourced by Lake Sherwood in Overland, MO, a man-made, spring-sourced lake.

==History==
The name, meaning &quot;River of the Fathers,&quot; is of French origin, and was given by locals because a mission of Jesuit Catholic priests resided near the confluence of the river with the Mississippi in the early 1700s. In the late 1600s, a group of Kaskaskias Indians crossed the Mississippi and established a settlement near the river&#x27;s confluence with the Mississippi. In 1702, French missionaries, following French practice, established their own settlement adjacent to the Kaskaskia&#x27;s settlement. The French settlement, like others in the region, was dedicated to missionary work and trade with Native Americans. In 1703, the Kaskaskia abandoned their settlement; the following year, the French traders and priests followed. There is also a city of the same name, Des Peres, located in west St. Louis County.

In preparation for the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair, the portion of the river that flows through Forest Park was disguised by temporary wooden channels. Shortly thereafter, that portion was placed entirely underground. The River des Peres has functioned as a combined sanitary sewer and storm drain for over 100 years. In the early 1930s, following high demand for preventive safety measures brought on by a series of fatal floods, the river was channelized, with its upper sections redirected underground in large sewage pipes. Design and construction was led by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, Horner &amp; Shifrin, and the Works Progress Administration. The lower banks of the river, most notably along Willmore Park and the River des Peres Greenway, were lined with quarried limestone, producing a distinct, lasting landmark. &quot;Safety First / W.P.A.&quot; is written in mosaics along the eastern banks. This southern length of the river now has a sewer beneath it, and fills only as a result of heavy rains.

In 1988, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated the River des Peres Sewage &amp; Drainage Works as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark for the calculations involved, the large-scale trench dewatering methods, and the soil stabilization procedures.

Some of the worst flooding of the Great Flood of 1993 occurred near where the river flows into the Mississippi River.

==Current condition==
River des Peres enters underground culverts from north of Forest Park, emerges south of the park into concrete channels, and debouches into the Mississippi.

An artificial water flow that emulates the river was created through Forest Park, using the city&#x27;s water supply. This is often mistakenly considered a re-creation of the original River des Peres. However, the water flow here is deliberately produced, not derived from rainfall, or runoff, etc., and cannot be considered a re-creation of the river. The resemblance of the water feature to a picturesque river scene was an attempt to maintain continuity with the appearance of the rest of Forest Park&#x27;s landscape, which for the most part, excepting significantly recent additions to the Art Museum (by Peter Walker), upholds the original, early twentieth century pastoral design intentions of George Kessler. The design received notable objections due to its generous use of resources to present the appearance of a healthy river.

The river is currently part of the combined sewer and stormwater system of its watershed, which includes large portions of St. Louis City and County. It is administered by the St. Louis Metropolitan Sewer District (MSD), which concerns itself primarily with sanitary and storm water management; and the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which handles general flood and safety concerns. MSD is working to separate the sanitary and stormwater systems, which will enable more recreational use of the river.

The planned River des Peres Greenway Project created an linear park along the river from Forest Park to the Mississippi. It is part of a larger system of works as part of the River Ring project by The Great Rivers Greenway District.

<text>The fire point, or combustion point, of a fuel is the lowest temperature at which the liquid fuel will continue to burn for at least five seconds after ignition by an open flame of standard dimension. At the flash point, a lower temperature, a substance will ignite briefly, but vapour might not be produced at a rate to sustain the fire. Most tables of material properties will only list material flash points. In general, the fire point can be assumed to be about 10 °C higher than the flash point, although this is no substitute for testing if the fire point is safety critical. 

Testing of the fire point is done by open cup apparatus.

<text>Sir Harold Matthew Evans (28 June 192823 September 2020) was a British-American journalist and writer. In his career in his native Britain, he was editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; from 1967 to 1981, and its sister title &quot;The Times&quot; for a year from 1981, before being forced out of the latter post by Rupert Murdoch. While at &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, he led the newspaper&#x27;s campaign to seek compensation for mothers who had taken the morning sickness drug thalidomide, which led to their children having severely deformed limbs.

In 1984, he and his wife Tina Brown moved to the United States where he became an American citizen, retaining dual nationality. He held positions in journalism with &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and the New York &quot;Daily News&quot;. In 1986, he founded &quot;Condé Nast Traveller&quot;. He wrote books on history and journalism, such as &quot;The American Century&quot; (1998). In 2000, he retired from positions in journalism to spend more time on his writing. From 2001, he served as editor-at-large of &quot;The Week&quot; magazine and, from 2005, he was a contributor to &quot;The Guardian&quot; and BBC Radio 4. Evans was invested as a Knight Bachelor in 2004, for services to journalism. On 13 June 2011, Evans was appointed editor-at-large of the Reuters news agency. From 2013 until 2019, he served as chairman of the European Press Prize jury panel.

==Early life and education==
Evans, the eldest of four sons, was born at 39 Renshaw Street, Patricroft, Eccles, to Welsh parents, Frederick and Mary Evans (&quot;née&quot; Haselum), whom he described in his 2009 memoir as &quot;the self-consciously respectable working class&quot;. His father was an engine driver, while his mother ran a shop in their front room to enable the family to buy a car. He failed the eleven-plus, needed to gain entry to grammar schools, and attended St Mary&#x27;s Central School in Manchester and a business school for a year to learn shorthand, a requirement to become a journalist.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
Evans began his career as a reporter for a weekly newspaper in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, at 16. During his national service in the Royal Air Force (1946–1949), he passed an intelligence test to become an officer, but did not hear anything further and served as a clerk. He entered University College, Durham University, after contacting every one of the fourteen universities in Great Britain at the time. While a student, he edited the university&#x27;s independent newspaper, &quot;Palatinate&quot;. After studying economics and politics, he graduated in 1952.

Following his appointment as a sub-editor on the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;, he was chosen by the International Press Institute to teach newspaper technique in India. Evans won a Harkness Fellowship in 1956–1957 to travel and study in the United States, spending periods at the universities of Chicago and Stanford. After his return, to the UK, he became an assistant editor on the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot;. Nicholas Lemann observed that he &quot;joined a long line of British journalists&quot; who did similar studies, from Alistair Cooke to Andrew Sullivan. Evans was appointed editor of a regional daily, &quot;The Northern Echo&quot;, in 1961. While at the Darlington title, Evans successfully campaigned for cervical smear tests to be remedied so that he could be more available for journalistic work, and he campaigned tirelessly to pardon of Timothy Evans, wrongly convicted and hanged for murders in Notting Hill, London. &quot;The Northern Echo&quot; was able to demonstrate that there had been a miscarriage of justice.

In 1966, Harold Evans moved to London to become assistant to the editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The owners of the newspaper, the Thomson Organisation, acquired &quot;The Times&quot; not long afterwards, and Evans&#x27; editor, Denis Hamilton was promoted to editor-in-chief of the Times group. He recommended Evans to the board as the next editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;.

===&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot;===
====Reporting====
Evans became editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 1967. Early on during his period as editor came the title&#x27;s exposure of Kim Philby in that year as a member of the Cambridge Spy ring who had been involved in espionage on behalf of Russia from 1933. Previously it had been claimed that Philby was a low-level diplomat at the time he fled to Moscow in 1963, whereas in actuality, he had been in charge of anti-Soviet intelligence and the chief officer responsible for maintaining contacts with the CIA. Evans was warned the revelations risked national security, receiving a D-notice requesting he should not publish at the beginning of September. Despite this, he went ahead with publication believing the D-notice had been issued to inoculate the government against bad publicity, rather than to maintain the country&#x27;s security. The official complaint was later withdrawn.

A long-running issue during his tenure was thalidomide, a drug prescribed to expectant mothers suffering from morning sickness, which led to thousands of children in Britain having deformed limbs. They had not received compensation from the drug manufacturers, who in the United Kingdom were the Distillers Company. He organised a campaign by the newspaper&#x27;s &quot;Insight&quot; investigative team, appointing Phillip Knightley to run the investigation. Evans took on the drug companies responsible for the manufacture of thalidomide, pursuing them through the English courts and eventually gaining victory in the European Court of Human Rights in 1979. The British government was compelled to change the law on contempt of court which had inhibited the reporting of civil cases. While it was legal for the newspaper to campaign, it was not possible for the journalists to report its factual basis. After the ruling in the European Court, the British media was now able to report such cases without restraint. The families of thalidomide victims eventually won compensation of £32.5 million as a consequence of Evans&#x27; &quot;Sunday Times&quot; campaign. A documentary about Evans and the thalidomide campaign, &quot;Attacking The Devil: Harold Evans and the Last Nazi War Crime&quot;, appeared in 2016.

The British government attempted in 1974 to prevent Evans from publishing extracts from the diaries of former Labour cabinet minister Richard Crossman, shortly after Crossman had died and ahead of the diaries publication in book form. Evans risked prosecution under the Official Secrets Act 1911 for breaking the thirty-year rule preventing disclosures of government business. Lord Chief Justice Widgery ruled that publication would not be against the public interest.

====Murdoch takeover====
When Rupert Murdoch acquired Times Newspapers Limited in 1981, he appointed Evans as editor of &quot;The Times&quot;. He remained with the paper only a year, during which time &quot;The Times&quot; was critical of Margaret Thatcher. Over 50 journalists resigned in the first six months of Murdoch&#x27;s takeover, a number of them known to dislike Evans. In March 1982, a group of &quot;Times&quot; journalists called for Evans to resign, despite the paper&#x27;s increase in circulation, claiming that he had overseen an &quot;erosion of editorial standards&quot;. Evans resigned shortly afterwards, citing policy differences with Murdoch relating to editorial independence. Evans included an account of the episode in his book &quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot; (1984). In the introduction to the 1994 edition, Evans wrote of Murdoch: &quot;When I come across him socially in New York I find I am without any residual emotional hostility ... I have to remind myself ... that Lucifer is the most arresting character in Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;.&quot;

On leaving &quot;The Times&quot;, Evans became director of Goldcrest Films and Television.

===Move to the United States===
In 1984, Evans moved to the United States, where he taught at Duke University in North Carolina and Yale University. He was appointed editor-in-chief of The Atlantic Monthly Press and became editorial director of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; and worked for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;. In 1986, he was the founding editor of &quot;Conde Nast Traveller&quot; where, unlike other publications, the staff were barred from receiving any free travel or hospitality from the organisations they wrote about. Evans was appointed president and publisher of Random House from 1990 to 1997. He acquired rights for $40,000 to the memoir, &quot;Dreams from My Father&quot;, by Barack Obama, then at the start of his political career.

Evans was editorial director and vice-chairman of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, and &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; from 1997 to January 2000, when he resigned. His work &quot;The American Century&quot; was published in 1998. The sequel, &quot;They Made America&quot; (2004), described the lives of some of the country&#x27;s most important inventors and innovators. &quot;Fortune&quot; characterised it as one of the best books in the 75 years of that magazine&#x27;s publication. The book was adapted as a four-part television mini-series that same year and as a National Public Radio special in the US in 2005.

Evans became a naturalised United States citizen in 1993. On 13 June 2011, he became editor-at-large at Reuters.

==Personal life and death==
In 1953, Evans married fellow Durham graduate Enid Parker, with whom he had a son and two daughters; the marriage was dissolved in 1978. The couple remained on good terms; Enid Evans died in 2013. In 1973, Evans met Tina Brown, a journalist 25 years his junior. In 1974, she was given freelance assignments with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in the UK, and in the U.S. by its &quot;Colour magazine&quot;. When a sexual affair emerged between the married Evans and Brown, she resigned and joined the rival &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;. On 20 August 1981, Evans and Brown married at Grey Gardens, in East Hampton, New York, the home of Ben Bradlee, then &quot;The Washington Post&quot; executive editor, and Sally Quinn. Evans and Brown had a son and daughter.

Evans died in New York City on 23 September 2020 at the age of 92. The cause of death given was congestive heart failure.

<text>Steropodon is a genus of prehistoric platypus-like monotreme, or egg-laying mammal. It contains a single species, Steropodon galmani, that lived about 100.2–96.6 million years ago during the Cretaceous period, from early to middle Cenomanian. It is one of the oldest monotremes discovered, and is one of the oldest Australian mammal discoveries. Several other monotremes are known from the Griman Creek Formation, including &quot;Dharragarra&quot;, &quot;Kollikodon&quot;, &quot;Opalios&quot;, &quot;Parvopalus&quot;, and &quot;Stirtodon&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The dentition of &quot;Steropodon&quot; is somewhat similar to that of therians—the placentals and the marsupials—specifically the presence of the tribosphenic molar tooth which was thought to be exclusive to therians since the Cretaceous. This, along with the tribosphenic molar discoveries of monotreme-relatives &quot;Ausktribosphenos&quot; and &quot;Ambondro mahabo&quot; of which the latter evolved in the Jurassic, led to the conclusion that the molar evolved independently in the two lineages. This inspired the creation of the subclasses Australosphenida—the monotremes and extinct relatives—and Tribosphenida—placentals and marsupials. However, given this classification is based only on jaw and lower-tooth remains, insufficient evidence may exist to definitively make this conclusion.

It may be only described member of the family Steropodontidae. Another proposed member is &quot;Teinolophos&quot; that was moved into its own family, Teinolophidae, by Flannery &quot;et al.&quot; (2022). Edentulous partial mandible from the Finch Clay facies of the Griman Creek Formation was attributed to undescribed steropodontid by Musser (2013). On other side, Flannery &quot;et al.&quot; assumed that this mandible may belong to a new genus and species of stem ornithorhynchid.

The specific epithet is derived from the surname of the jaw&#x27;s collectors, when combined with the genus name &quot;Steropodon&quot; is intended to translate as &quot;Galman&#x27;s lightning tooth&quot;.

==Description==
&quot;Steropodon&quot; is known only from a single opalised jaw with three molars, discovered at the Griman Creek Formation, Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia, by brothers David and Alan Galman. It was a large mammal for the Mesozoic, being long. The lower molars are in length, with a width of . A length of is more typical for Mesozoic mammals.

Woodburne (2003, p. 212) reports that the holotype is a right mandible named AM F66763. The preserved molars are m1–m3. Examination of the jaw fragment revealed a mandibular canal, which has been proposed to indicate the presence of a bill, similar to those of the extinct species &quot;Obdurodon dicksoni&quot; and the modern platypus &quot;Ornithorhynchus anatinus&quot;.

<text>OC Transpo is the primary public transport agency for the city of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, operating bus rapid transit, light rail, conventional bus routes, and door-to-door paratransit in the nation&#x27;s capital region.

OC Transpo was established in 1948 as the Ottawa Transportation Commission, and currently operates three urban rail lines, 11 bus rapid transit (BRT) lines, and 170 regular bus routes. OC Transpo serves 25 light rail (O-Train) stations, and 43 BRT (Transitway) stations. OC Transpo achieved a total ridership of 110,596,700 in 2023.

Ottawa is notable for its Transitway system, a network of grade separated busways linking outer suburbs to the downtown core which originally opened with five stations in 1983, and continued substantial expansion into the late 2000s. Much of the Transitway infrastructure has been, and is currently being, converted to light rail since the opening of the Confederation Line (Line 1) in 2019.

Some OC Transpo routes also serve Gatineau in Quebec during peak periods. In addition, many Société de transport de l&#x27;Outaouais routes serving Gatineau also operate into downtown Ottawa.
== System overview ==
Ottawa&#x27;s transportation system is built around the rapid transit spines of the O-Train and Transitway networks. This rapid transit system is fed, and augmented by, frequent, express, and local bus routes.

The rapid transit network is primarily oriented around downtown and the nearby government offices therein, whereas the non-rapid network of frequent routes provide orbital coverage in the suburbs. The majority of Ottawa&#x27;s busiest routes are orbital routes, including frequent routes 88, 6, and 7, despite not being rapid transit. Express routes parallel rapid corridors with limited stops during peak periods, while local routes are comparatively infrequent with closely spaced stops. Six rapid bus routes (57, 61, 75, 39, 45, and 97) have 24 hour service.

O-Train Line 1 forms the core of the network, accounting for a quarter of all transit trips in the city in 2023. It has three major Transitway interchanges, one O-Train Line 2 interchange, and one intercity Via rail station across its length. It is a 100% low floor, electric light rail line, and it is notable for being fully grade separated its entire length, which is uncommon for light rail services. The ongoing Stage 2 O-Train expansion will replace portions of the existing Transitway bus rapid transit network with extensions of the Line 1 and a new Line 3, which will interline Line 1 and add additional service to the west end of Ottawa.

O-Train Line 2 (also known as the Trillium Line) is one of the three primary north–south rapid transit corridors in the city, and duplicates the southeastern Transitway for part of its length. The primary trip generator on the line is Carleton University, and the line interchanges with Line 1 at Bayview, O-Train Line 4 (the Airport Link) at South Keys, and the southwestern Transitway rapid route 74 at Limebank station. The Trillium Line was closed for Stage 2 expansion on May 3, 2020, re-opening alongside the Line 4 on 6 January 2025. It was originally constructed as a low cost ($21 million) rail pilot project, using a disused mainline freight line. It operates diesel trains on single and double track at a frequency of every 12 minutes.

The Transitway fans out from the city centre in four directions: east, southeast, southwest, and west, extending past the greenbelt and entering the outer ring suburbs of Kanata, Barrhaven, and Orléans. Many of the rapid bus routes that operate on the Transitway share the same route in the inner city, and then branch out in the suburbs to provide coverage. In addition to the BRT lines, the Transitway is also partly used by other, non-rapid transit routes, as well as emergency vehicles. The Transitway is mostly grade separated.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Ottawa&#x27;s first public transportation system began in 1886 with the operation of a horsecar system. The horse-drawn streetcars travelled back and forth from New Edinburgh to the Chaudière Bridge. The horsecar would remain a staple means of public transportation until 1891 after Thomas Ahearn founded the Ottawa Electric Railway Company. This private enterprise eventually provided heated streetcar service covering the downtown core. Electricity had been employed in a few places in Ottawa since the first demonstration of the incandescent bulb in 1883; the earliest were Parliament Hill and LeBreton Flats. In May 1885, electric lighting commenced in the city. In 1885 council contracted Ottawa Electric Light Company to install arc lamps on the city&#x27;s streets.

=== 1970s: Formation, early Transitway and first strike ===
Transit in Ottawa was provided by the Ottawa Transportation Commission until 1973 when transit service in the city and its suburbs was transferred under the auspices of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. Its formal name was the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Transit Commission, but the service was promoted in both English and French under the OC Transpo name, whose OC initials are derived from Ottawa-Carleton. This renaming to OC Transpo was a break from the practice of simply retaining the central cities&#x27; (when they existed per se) transit system&#x27;s name following regionalization as was the case for Toronto&#x27;s Toronto Transit Commission and Hamilton&#x27;s Hamilton Street Railway.

The 20-day 1979 strike was fought over a wage difference of a nickel and became known as &quot;the five-cent bus strike&quot;. A pay increase of 16.5% was rejected by the union.

=== 1980s: Transitway ===

In the early 1980s, OC Transpo began planning for a bus rapid transit system, the Transitway. Construction of its various stations and segments followed over many years. The first segments were from Baseline to Lincoln Fields in the west end and from Lees to Hurdman (two immediate stations) in the east end.

=== 1990s: Second strike and shooting ===

The second strike for OC Transpo ran from 25 November to 16 December 1996. The strike ended under arbitration.

On Tuesday, 6 April 1999, former OC Transpo employee Pierre Lebrun, armed with a Remington Model 760 pump-action rifle, shot six people, killing four, in a shooting spree at OC Transpo&#x27;s St. Laurent Boulevard garage, before killing himself. Lebrun was fired in August 1997 but later reinstated, and quit in 1998.

An inquest into the shooting revealed Lebrun was the subject of teasing for his speech impediment, and that his complaints to management were not investigated. The inquest revealed an &quot;atmosphere of bullying&quot;, described as a &quot;poisoned&quot; environment by an employment equity manager. In response, OC Transpo instigated zero-tolerance policies regarding workplace harassment, a new employee-management communications program, and increased training on workplace respect. However, studies in 2003 and 2004 found there to be lingering elements of a negative work environment, and employee-management communication was reported to be strained following the 1996 strike.

=== 2000s: Trillium Line, expansions and third strike ===
OC Transpo launched the O-Train diesel light rail transit (DLRT) service on 15 October 2001, as a pilot project. The service consists of one north–south line, with major points of interest including Carleton University and the South Keys Shopping Centre. In late 2014, this line became known as Trillium Line, or O-Train Line 2, to allow for expansion of the O-Train brand.

The province of Ontario ordered the amalgamation of the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton and its component municipalities into a single City of Ottawa municipality. When the new local governance took effect in 2001, OC Transpo became a department of the new city.

Following amalgamation, a bilingual replacement backronym for &quot;OC&quot; was sought, but no suitable candidates have been found. The anachronistic acronym has been kept, instead of the costly task of replacing the decals on all buses, bus stops, bus stations, and promotional material. Thus, &quot;OC&quot; is an orphan initialism.

A new section of the southwest Transitway opened on 12 December 2005, between the Nepean Sportsplex and Fallowfield Station. The new section runs parallel to Woodroffe Avenue and was built at a cost of $10 million. The new section has no stations and has replaced service along Woodroffe Avenue between the Nepean Sportsplex and Fallowfield. The Transitway was further expanded south into Barrhaven with Strandherd opened on 2 January 2007. There are also long range plans for other extensions in the Orleans and Kanata areas to keep up with more growing communities.

Following the 2006 municipal election campaign, Larry O&#x27;Brien was elected as mayor and cancelled the light rail expansion project, per a campaign promise. City Council decided to annul the project by a margin of 13–11 on 14 December 2006. The proposed northbound expansions from Bayview onward were later revived with the Confederation Line project, contracted in December 2012.

OC Transpo drivers, dispatchers, and maintenance workers under Amalgamated Transit Union local 279 went on strike 10 December 2008, at 12:01am. The main causes of the strike were disagreements between the City of Ottawa and the union regarding scheduling, payroll and seniority. Rona Ambrose, the Federal Minister of Labour ordered a union membership vote on 8 January 2009, on the city&#x27;s contract proposal in response to a request from mayor Larry O&#x27;Brien. Both the city and the union published their positions on respective websites. Vote results released on 9 January 2009, revealed that of those eligible to vote, 64% rejected the offer.

Meetings were held with a mediator throughout the month, but talks were repeatedly broken off. The ATU had requested to send all issues not related to scheduling to arbitration, which the city refused as it requested all issues to be sent to an arbitrator. As the strike entered the 50th day, Ambrose, who had initially refused to table back-to-work legislation, announced that such legislation would be introduced. However, on 29 January, the city and the ATU reached a deal that sent every issue to binding arbitration, thus ending the 51-day-long strike. On 2 February 2009, the O-Train Trillium Line started service after being out of service due to the strike. Buses followed the following Monday, 9 February 2009. Not all buses returned at once and OC Transpo said that all buses and routes were due to return by 6 April 2009. OC Transpo offered free transit for a week. December pass holders could either use their December passes until March or could get a refund. December pass holders were also subject to a 60% discount on March passes in order to win back transit users.

=== 2010s: Confederation Line and bus collisions ===
In December 2012, Ottawa City Council approved a major infrastructure project to build a 12.5 km east–west light metro line, the Confederation Line through the downtown. Construction of the line began in 2013.

On 18 September 2013, a double-decker OC Transpo bus, running on Route 76 from Barrhaven to downtown at 8:48 a.m., collided with a Toronto-bound Via Rail passenger train at a level crossing, equipped with active warning systems, near Fallowfield Station in Ottawa&#x27;s southwest end. Six people on the bus (including the driver) were killed and at least 30 others were injured, of which at least eight were critically injured. There were no injuries or fatalities to passengers or crew of the train. The cause of the accident is unknown at this time. It was announced the following year that Route 76 would be retired and changed to route 72 in recognition of those who died in the accident.
Incidentally, this route was spotted under a crossing gate at the Barrhaven Crossing Plaza on 6 November 2014; although no accident occurred, it sparked a lot of fear and questions in Barrhaven on whether these crossings are safe.

On 11 January 2019, another accident involving a double decker occurred, this time at Westboro station. The bus, operating Route 269, collided with the station&#x27;s shelter shearing off part of the roof. Three people were killed (initially reported as two passengers, and one bystander from the platform. Later corrected to all three deaths were passengers) and 23 people were injured.

After several delays, the Confederation Line opened to the public on 14 September 2019. This line is also marketed as O-Train Line 1.

=== 2020s: O-Train maintenance and COVID-19 intervention ===
The Confederation Line continued to suffer from reliability issues throughout the first quarter of 2020. This is in contrast to the Trillium Line, which had a lower ridership and different technology, but generally better reliability. In response to this, and due to lower ridership in 2020, OC Transpo scheduled several temporary closures of Line 1, allowing Rideau Transit Maintenance to work on the line and improve its reliability. During maintenance, the R1 bus route replaced train service.

On 16 March 2020, as a preventative measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, OC Transpo began limiting front door boarding and seating to riders with accessibility needs. All other customers were required to board at the back of the bus. As a result, cash fares were neither accepted nor enforced on buses, but a valid fare was required to begin a trip at an O-Train station. Hand sanitizer was installed on all Line 1 stations, and later installed at most Transitway stations. From 15 June 2020, to 10 June 2022, the agency required employees and riders to wear face masks while riding busses and trains, and inside all stations.

On 3 May 2020, the Trillium Line was shut down for construction and expansion. Bus replacement service is provided by Route 2 from Bayview to South Keys.

On 8 August 2021, an empty train on the Confederation Line derailed while switching tracks after leaving Tunney&#x27;s Pasture after one of the ten axles derailed. There were no injuries.

On 19 September 2021, a train with passengers on the Confederation Line derailed before entering Tremblay station after two axles became dislodged from the second car. After leaving Tremblay station in a derailed state, the train increased speed to about 35 km/h, crossed a bridge over Riverside Drive, struck a signal mast and switch heater and finally came to a stop between Tremblay and Hurdman station using train-initiated emergency braking. There were no injuries.

The city of Ottawa&#x27;s public transport system has historically catered to exclusively 9 to 5 public employees, a population that largely switched to remote work during COVID-19. This, combined with decades of underinvestment and thinned resources, has led to OC Transpo having a poor ridership recovery rate from before COVID; sitting at only 70% as of 2023. Council estimates that ridership will return to pre pandemic levels by 2030.

The low ridership recovery rate put OC Transpo into a difficult financial position. Despite this, city staff remain hopeful for the future of the project, with current mayor, Mark Sutcliffe, pointing out that the project would have always require funding from the federal or provincial governments anyway, and so OC Transpo budget shortfalls shouldn&#x27;t affect it. City staff have proposed further funding through raising taxes, increasing fares, or lobbying higher levels of government. On 13 November 2024, OC Transpo announced an increase in fares for all passengers, with a larger increase for seniors and youth riders.

On 6 December 2024, OC Transpo announced a phased re-opening of the Trillium Line &amp; Line 4, beginning with 5-day service that expands to 6- and then 7-day service over the following weeks. The expanded line includes six new stations along the Line 2, with two additional stations connecting to Ottawa International Airport. The Line 2 &amp; 4 opened as scheduled on January 6, 2025.

== Features ==
OC Transpo has a fleet of 944 buses that run on regular streets, all of which are fully accessible low-floor buses. OC Transpo uses many articulated buses to provide service. Some of the routes that run on the Transitway, including the city&#x27;s most-used bus routes, are served almost exclusively by articulated buses (e.g., routes 57, 61, 62, and 75). Peak hour connexion routes are served primarily by Double Decker buses.

In 2001, a pilot diesel-powered light rail service project, the original O-Train known today as the Trillium Line, was introduced. The local government announced expansion plans for the light rail to other parts of Ottawa, including a possible link to the Ottawa International Airport. Service to Gatineau would have also been possible, over the nearby Prince of Wales railway bridge over the Ottawa River. However, on 14 December 2006, City Council led by Mayor Larry O&#x27;Brien cancelled the north-south light rail expansion project. A new model of the project, to have a citywide integrated light rail system, was made, with work beginning in 2013 and will be completed in 2023. This new project envisions fully grade separated rapid transit service on the original Transitways from Baseline station or Moodie dr. in the west to Trim Park and Ride in the east. The gap between the east end west branches of Transitway will be replaced by a new downtown Subway tunnel under Queen and Rideau streets with three underground stations. The O-Train Trillium Line will be extended to Riverside South and will include a spur to the Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport, thus creating direct airport to downtown service. As for the suburbs, they will be served by 65 km of new Transitways. The first phase of the project, called the Confederation Line includes 12.5 km of rail between Tunney&#x27;s Pasture and Blair, including the downtown subway.

Ottawa has a relatively extensive rapid transport network compared to other North American cities of its size, and relatively high ridership. This was initially seen on the Transitway, a bus rapid transit system where buses travel on dedicated roadways and lanes. The Transitway lines that converged onto the city centre created a transportation bottleneck, with buses bunching heavily on city streets, with this in turn constricting the effective capacity and frequency of the entire Transitway network. From 2014 until the opening of the Confederation Line in 2019, the core of the central Transitway was decommissioned and converted to light rail, including a downtown rail tunnel to increase the system&#x27;s capacity, also allowing OC Transpo to reallocate its limited bus fleet to provide service elsewhere. The decision to convert the BRT network to rail was chosen due to trains being significantly more cost effective for the capacity needed, and an underground bus tunnel being completely impractical for the scale of service required.

For a number of years, OC Transpo has carried bicycle racks on some routes as a part of the &quot;Rack &amp; Roll&quot; campaign. These racks carry up to two bicycles at the front of the bus and fold up against the bus when not in use. As of 2021, all buses in the fleet are equipped with bike racks. Cyclists may use the racks at any time of day, provided there is room for the cyclist on board the bus. Traditionally, the racks have been available only between April and October, and there has been much debate over continuing the program throughout the year. Bicycles can be brought on board O-Train at all times of the year. As of 2023, though, a permanent winter pilot has been introduced.

There are four bus depots located throughout the city. The largest and headquarters is located at 1500 St. Laurent Boulevard, with two other smaller but frequently used depots being located at 168 Colonnade Road (Merivale Garage) and the other on Queensview Drive (Pinecrest Garage). A major new maintenance depot which opened its doors in 2010 is located on Industrial Avenue.

== Routes ==

OC Transpo has 170 bus routes (as of 6 October 2019) that are grouped both by their number and the colour with which they are represented on system maps and on bus stop flags.

A major route overhaul and changes in the network will occur in the second quarter of 2025, following opening of lines 2 and 4. Most existing routes will see changes, with some routes being taken out completely. There will also be many new routes to accommodate these changes.

== Fleet ==

Ottawa&#x27;s public transport network primarily relies on 18.5m long articulated buses, which bend in the middle. They are considered the workhorses of the system, and can carry up to 110 people. The city also uses double decker Alexander Dennis Enviro500 MMC buses, which have similar overall capacity to the articulated buses, but with much more seating. The city also has a slightly smaller fleet of lower capacity regular buses, which are 12.5m long. All buses are mostly, but not entirely, low floor, and have two or three sets of doors.

The O-Train has three kinds of rolling stock. Ottawa uses custom Alstom Citadis Spirit electric light rail vehicles on line 1. On line 2, stock European train models are used, with the Alstom Coradia LINT and Stadler FLIRT. Despite being referred to locally as light rail, the line 2 trains are actually heavy rail vehicles. The O-Train vehicles have significantly higher capacity than the bus fleet, with the line 1 trains having a capacity for 672 passengers.

=== Issues ===
Ottawa&#x27;s articulated buses are rear wheel drive, meaning the back portion of the bus &quot;pushes&quot; the rest of the bus forward. This in contrast to articulated buses where the middle axle is power, which &quot;pull&quot; the bendy section along.

Pusher style articulated buses have the ability to kink themselves when there is poor traction, and this can be seen in Ottawa in the winter, where a large part of the articulated fleet traps themselves on the road, unable to move. In 2022, OC Transpo began a pilot project where it would pre-emptively pull articulated buses out of service, if 30 cm of snow or another severe weather event was predicted.

Line 1&#x27;s Citadis Spirit trains, custom built by the French rolling stock manufacturer Alstom, have been riddled with issues, and have garnered a bad reputation by both media and the public. In the first two years of service, they suffered repeated faults, including, among other things, derailments, computer failures, and cracked wheels.

The Ottawa Light Rail Transit Public Inquiry report found that there were several causes for the vehicles&#x27; poor reliability. The vehicles push what an LRT can do, and are treated more like heavy rail subway vehicles on line 1, rather than like the light rail vehicles they are in reality. In addition to this, the OC Transpo workforce was inexperienced operating the vehicles, and the construction and testing of line 1, as well as the trains that run on it, was heavily rushed. Tied together with human error, and an unrealistically low budget for the project, all contributing to the vehicles faults.

=== Bus fleet ===

The New Flyer D60LFR was chosen for the bus network because of a deal New Flyer made to the city in August 2010, replacing 226 of its older underpowered 60-foot D60LF articulated buses (purchased between 2001 and 2004) with brand new D60LFR models. The bus exchange was completed in March 2011. OC Transpo was given incentives as part of the deal, including rebates on the trading-in of the old buses and a credit on new parts. Eighty new D60LFR articulated buses were also purchased from New Flyer, bringing the combined total to 306 buses. All of the 2001–2004 D60LFs are now retired. Some of the older New Flyer D60LF sixty-foot articulated buses have caught on fire during the summer of 2006 and the Summer/Fall of 2010, due to overheating engines, effectively putting them out of service.

On 12 July 2011, OC Transpo announced that all remaining high floor buses were retired and thus all OC Transpo buses now have low floors, can be further lowered for strollers and walkers, and have flip-out ramps for wheelchairs. The full fleet is air-conditioned for Ottawa&#x27;s short hot and humid summers.

Ottawa announced that it would be adding 75 double-decker buses to its fleet on 24 August 2012, and were put in service in October. They were previously trialed in 2006 and 2007 citation. They were added to the fleet primarily for their higher seated capacity compared to the articulated buses in use (86 versus 55), and are employed mainly on commuter oriented &quot;Connexion&quot; routes. Part of their introduction was also due to them being seen as spectacle that could increase system ridership, and in practice, 41 percent of riders and drivers say they prefer the bilevels, while 30 percent prefer single deck buses. The decision to purchase double decker buses was also supported by them being less expensive to run than articulated buses, and taking up less road space.

The maintenance of the fleet was complicated by adding buses from another manufacturer (OC Transpo already had buses from New Flyer and Orion before purchasing the double-deckers from Alexander Dennis). In cold and wet weather, condensation is prone to collecting on the roof of the upper deck, dripping on passengers below.

Two of the new double-decker buses were in service as of 10 September 2012, and were temporarily used on peak period routes 22 and 30 (serving Orleans). This lasted until a sinkhole on Regional Road 174 was fixed in mid-September.

, OC Transpo has a fleet consisting of 740 buses, made up of 7 bus models:

==== Electric buses ====

OC Transpo has purchased 4 electric New Flyer XE40 buses, which were delivered in November 2021, and entered service in early 2022. On 7 June 2021, a plan was announced that, if approved, would see 450 electric buses purchased by 2027, and full fleet electrification by 2036.

=== Rail fleet ===
==== Expansion fleet ====
OC Transpo currently has seven four-car DEMU Stadler FLIRT from Stadler Rail for use when the Stage 2 improvements of the Trillium Line are completed. When these trains are introduced, the Alstom LINT DMU trains will be used on the Airport spur, between South Keys and Airport stations.

An expansion fleet of 38 Alstom Citadis Spirit LRVs will also be built for the Stage 2 vehicle additional requirements for use on Line 1.

=== Garages ===
OC Transpo currently has 5 bus garages and two rail yards that house the fleet, and are also where vehicle maintenance is carried out. The garages are as follows:

* St. Laurent Garage. Opened in 1959, capacity of 275 buses. OC Transpo headquarters are also located on property.
* St. Laurent North Garage. Opened in 1987 and has a capacity of 207 buses. Located adjacent to St. Laurent Garage.
* Industrial Garage. Opened in 2010 as a purpose-built garage for 167 double-decker and articulated buses.
* Pinecrest Garage. Opened 1976 and has a capacity of 193 buses. Located near Pinecrest Rd. and Highway 417.
* Merivale (Colonnade) Garage. Opened in 1978 and has a capacity of 215 buses. Located in Nepean between Merivale Rd. and Prince of Wales Dr. Formerly known as the Colonnade Garage, as it is located on Colonnade Rd. South.
* Walkley Yard. Houses the Trillium Line DMU fleet. Located in the CNR Walkley Yard, off of Albion Rd. North. Opened 2001.
* Belfast Yard. Constructed to house the Confederation Line LRV fleet. Complete in 2018. Located on Belfast Road, with the rail access in between Tremblay and St Laurent Stations.

== Fares ==

OC Transpo fares can be paid with cash, a Presto card, debit card, credit card, or mobile wallet, since the introduction of O-Payment. Reduced fares and pass subscriptions can only be loaded onto a Presto card, whereas on bank cards and phone wallets, fare charges are automatically capped when reaching the daily and monthly pass rates. Transfers are free, and last between 90 and 105 minutes from tapping on.

The STO Multi-Card is also accepted only if it has one of the following loaded onto it:

* A transfer issued from a STO bus, valid for two hours
* A monthly pass (may be regular, student, senior, or ECO)
* The Fidélité Annual Pass
* The Cam-Puce university pass
* One-day, three-day, or seven-day pass

Transfers are printed for passengers upon boarding by the driver (cash only). Transfers are integrated in the Presto cards when using the e-wallet. As of 24 January 2025, such transfers are valid for:
* On a weekday:
** 105 minutes when issued from 2:45 am to 6:30 am
** 90 minutes when issued from 6:30am to 6:00pm
** 105 minutes when issued from 6:00 pm to 10:30 pm
** until 4:30 am when issued from 10:30 pm to 2:45 am
* On a Saturday:
** 105 minutes when issued from 2:45 am to 10:00 am
** 90 minutes when issued from 10:00am to 6:00pm
** 105 minutes when issued from 6:00 pm to 10:30 pm
** until 4:30 am when issued from 10:30 pm to 2:45 am
* On a Sunday:
** 105 minutes when issued from 2:45 am to 10:30 pm
** until 4:30 am when issued from 10:30 pm to 2:45 am

In 1951, OC Transpo had a fare of 10 cents, equivalent to $1.22 in 2024 dollars. The fares have since increased on a regular basis, although discounted fares were previously available with tickets. In 2012, a senior fare of $2.00 was introduced, although it was increased in subsequent years.

Current fares as of 24 January 2025 are:
* $4.00 for adults 18+ (this fare applies to O-Payment as well)
* $4.00 for youth 13–17 
* $3.20 for seniors (ages 65 and up)
* $2.00 for pre-teen (ages 11–12)
* $1.75 for EquiPass and Community
* Free for children 10 and under

The fares listed above only apply if the rider is using their Presto card to pay. All riders who pay cash, regardless of their age or condition, will pay a fare of $4.05. To benefit from a discount, a Presto card with the discount loaded must be used.

Seniors ride free Wednesdays and Sundays. Proof of age may be required.

=== DayPass and multi-day passes ===

The monthly pass, introduced in 1976, offers the lowest price per day for unlimited rides on OC Transpo. Paper passes were discontinued by 2017, with Presto monthly passes being the sole option.

OC Transpo introduced the DayPass at $5 ($7.16 in 2017 dollars) per voucher or $6 ($8.60 in 2017 dollars) cash on 1 July 1998. By 2000, the cash price matched the $5 voucher price. The price for both increased to $6 ($7.64 in 2017 dollars) in 2003, and since then, DayPass fares were gradually increased to reach $10.25 in 2017. DayPass vouchers were no longer sold since 1 July 2009, leaving only cash and tickets on the bus as a method of payment.

The Family DayPass was launched concurrently with the DayPass. At launch, it was available on Sundays and statutory holidays, allowing up to two adults and youth (age 12 or older) to ride the bus with up to four children (age 11 or younger) at the same price of a DayPass. With the discontinuation of DayPass vouchers on 1 July 2009, the Family DayPass was also made available on Saturdays.

On 1 January 2018, OC Transpo launched multi-day passes (3, 5, or 7 days). This allows multiple days of DayPass service, up to a week, to be purchased in advanced at a lower cost. Multi-day passes cannot be used as a Family DayPass, cannot be loaded on a Presto card and are emitted as a paper transfer. Passes are activated immediately upon purchase.

=== Discontinued fares ===
Express fares were premium peak period bus routes, treated as a second fare zone by OC Transpo. Express bus passes for adults and students, and regular senior bus passes, were also accepted. On 1 January 2017, the Express fare was discontinued, and Express routes were rebranded as Connexion routes. Since this change, the entire OC Transpo network is treated as a single fare zone. The agency also cited the Confederation Line (Line 1), which opened in September 2019, as a reason for discontinuing the Express fare.

Rural Express fares were introduced on six routes on 2 July 2002, as a third fare zone. The cash fare was $4.75 (equivalent to $6.48 in 2020 dollars), while the ticket fare was $3.40 (equivalent to $4.64 in 2020 dollars) by using four tickets. Rural Express bus passes for adults and students, and regular senior bus passes, were also accepted. The cash fare increased to $5 in 2006, and later to $5.25. On 2 July 2012, the Rural Express fare was discontinued, with all Rural Express routes being repurposed as Express routes. Para Transpo continues to operate a rural fare zone.

=== Other prices ===
Tickets for the O-Train light rail line were initially sold for $2 each at ticket vending machines in 2002 ($2.60 in 2016 dollars) when paying cash, lower than the $2.50 bus cash fare but pricier than the $1.70 ($2.21 in 2016 dollars) ticket fare at the time. Train tickets can be exchanged for a bus transfer on board of an OC Transpo bus. O-Train ticket prices increased over time, but remained lower compared to bus cash fares until July 2013, when OC Transpo increased O-Train ticket prices from $2.85 to $3.40 to match the bus cash fare. This represents an increase of over 19% and happened after the Presto card launch completed. This card is accepted at O-Train stations for a lower train fare. Bus tickets and DayPass vouchers cannot be used on the O-Train. Bus transfers, however, are accepted.

Monthly and annual passes are also available for all route classes with cost differences for adults, students, and seniors. Passes require an OC Transpo photo ID card, which is available at extra cost. Additionally, Ecopasses (reduced-rate monthly passes) are available through participating employers in the city, providing applicable OC Transpo riders with single-card indefinite passes in exchange for a flat bi-weekly, semi-monthly or monthly payroll deduction.

In July 2008, fares were increased by 7.5% because of a shortage in funding for the City of Ottawa. This fare hike was supposed to be in effect until 2010 including a 6.5% hike in 2009. This meant Ottawa residents saw regular adult passes rise from $73 a month to $81 and adult express passes from $90 to $101 a month. However, cash fares remained the same.

On 18 January 2013, OC Transpo starting the final testing of its Presto Card deployment as part of the NEXT-ON program. Ten thousand customers were able to order a Presto Card online or pick one up at select OC Transpo transitway stations, activate it, and use it for OC Transpo&#x27;s final testing of the loadable cards. As of January 2013, over 10,000 Presto cards have been distributed. A limited number of Presto cards were available at Baseline Station on 22 January 2013, and at Fallowfield Station on 24 January 2013. The final full release date for Presto in Ottawa was on 18 May 2013. Cards can be either loaded with cash and used like tickets, or loaded with as a monthly pass, which unlike the photo pass, is usable by family and friends. As of 2017, yearly and monthly photo passes have been discontinued, as they are not accepted at the new fare gates being installed along the O-Train.

The Province is encouraging all Ontario transit systems to adopt Presto, and the OC Transpo installation has been complex, requiring installation of readers at the front doors of all buses and all doors of articulated and double-decker buses, as well as a computer with a Presto fare database on each bus. The database was originally refreshed every night with updates of the day&#x27;s Presto fare purchases when the buses return to the garages; this required users to wait up to 24 hours before cash loaded onto their card accounts is recognized by the readers. In 2014, the readers were upgraded to refresh up to 6 times a day using cellular data. There are now new fare gates and ticket vending machines at all O-Train stations. Unlike the TTC and GO Transit facilities, OC Transpo did not launch full Presto ticket machines until November 2017, when all O-Train Line 2 stations except for Bayview featured a new fare gate system. The full machines allow riders to check and reload a card prior to boarding.

In January 2021, OC Transpo launched the Bikesecure program which allows secure bike parking spots at a select number of transit stations to be reserved for a monthly fee.

== Para Transpo ==
Para Transpo is an accessible paratransit service available to Ottawa patrons who find it extremely difficult or impossible to use the conventional OC Transpo routes. Service is provided directly to the residences of eligible users who book trip appointments with a call centre at least one day in advance. Para Transpo drivers will provide some assistance to passengers to board designated vehicle and to access building entrances.

Para Transpo operations were contracted to First Student Canada, previously operated by Laidlaw. On 1 January 2008, the City of Ottawa assumed complete control of this service.

The transit strike of 2008 did not interrupt Para Transpo service. However, Para Transpo service did encounter delays, facing the traffic increase due to the strike.

== Safety and security ==
All major stations are equipped with various safety and security features for the public, including callboxes, payphones, CCTV cameras around the stations, along with well lit and heated shelters. On train platforms, there are warning strips and barriers to keep passengers at a safe distance from the tracks. On vehicles, the newer D60lfr models were installed with passenger assistance alarms (PAAs) at the rear of the bus. They were also added on double decker busses toward the upper deck. When pressed, it will notify the operator of an emergency, incident, and/or someone in need of assistance. Other safety features on transit busses include handrails for holding when standing, and CCTV cameras providing surveillance. After 9 pm, Nightstop can be used to request the operator to stop at a closer location than that of a specific bus stop. OC Transpo also employs many Special Constables to patrol stations and respond to calls involving OC Transpo vehicles, stations, or stops, and work in close partnership with the Ottawa Police Service.

== Advertising ==
Advertising on OC Transpo buses is contracted to Pattison Outdoor Advertising. Advertising on bus shelters is contracted to Branded Cities.

== Amalgamated Transit Union – Local 279 ==
The Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 279 is the OC Transpo employees&#x27; union with of over 1800 members consisting of bus and rail operators as well as other staffing positions within the company, including mechanics located at various garage depots throughout the city.

<doc id="668752" wikidata="Q1807798" url="?curid=668752" title="Plok!">
<text>Plok! is a platform game developed by the British studio Software Creations for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It was released in late 1993 by Tradewest in North America, Nintendo in Europe, and Activision in Japan. Players control the hood-headed titular protagonist, the king of the island Akrillic, who is defending it from fleas spawned by the Flea Queen, hidden beneath the island&#x27;s surface, as well as other bosses attempting to usurp Plok&#x27;s power. His versatility lies in his four detachable limbs, which can be used to attack targets and enemies, along with various power-ups scattered throughout the game&#x27;s colorful stages, referred to as &quot;presents.&quot;

The history of &quot;Plok!&quot; began in the late 1980s as a self-funded coin-op project by Ste and John Pickford called &quot;Fleapit&quot;. They developed it while working at Zippo Games and programmed it for Rare&#x27;s &#x27;Razz Board&#x27; hardware. The project was canceled in 1990 following the closure of Zippo Games but was later revived as an SNES game developed at Software Creations after the Pickfords were promoted to higher positions, with Ste becoming an art director and John a producer. Software Creations self-funded the game, with the Pickfords retaining ownership of its intellectual property rights. A port for the Sega Genesis was planned but was canceled for unknown reasons.

&quot;Plok!&quot; received positive reviews from critics, who praised its innovative ideas, variety, music, presentation, versatile protagonist, and level design. However, some critics noted skepticism about its similarity to other colorful platform games of the era. The Pickfords attributed its underwhelming sales to the market saturation of mascot-driven platformers.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Plok!&quot; offers two difficulty modes: &quot;Normal,&quot; which includes the entire game, and &quot;Child&#x27;s Play,&quot; which removes the harder stages and reduces both the speed and hit points of enemies. Players can earn &quot;Plokontinues&quot; by collecting four P-L-O-K tokens, with one token awarded for completing a level without losing a life. If a Game Over occurs, the player restarts with a score of 0, three lives, and at the most recent Plokontinue checkpoint. Saving is limited to two &quot;Permanent Continue Positions,&quot; which are unlocked after defeating the Bobbins Brothers and Rockyfella bosses. These allow the player to resume from specific points even after resetting the game. The game does not include a password feature.

Plok can launch any of his four limbs—two arms and two legs—as projectiles to attack enemies. If a limb hits an enemy, it returns immediately to Plok, but if it misses, it takes longer to come back. Limbs can pass through specific obstacles, such as rock pillars. However, Plok cannot fire limbs while somersaulting. In later levels, certain puzzles require Plok to &quot;sacrifice&quot; a limb to activate scenery-changing switches. When a limb strikes a target, it is placed on a hanger near the switch. Some targets require specific limbs, and when Plok loses all his limbs, he moves by bouncing, which makes him harder to control.

Plok&#x27;s secondary attack, the &quot;Speed Blade,&quot; is a buzzsaw-like move that enhances his speed and delivers maximum damage to enemies. He can collect shells, which grant extra lives and serve as ammunition for a special amulet obtained partway through the game. The amulet converts shells into energy for his secondary attack. Players can also find &quot;Magic Fruits,&quot; which heal Plok&#x27;s health. The more he punches a fruit, the larger it grows, restoring additional health. Rare &quot;Golden Fruits&quot; fully replenish his energy. In certain stages, some fruits transport Plok to bonus areas where he must complete timed challenges or collect all shells to progress. Successfully completing these sections may allow Plok to skip certain levels or boss fights.

&quot;Presents&quot; temporarily transform Plok into characters inspired by his favorite movies, such as &quot;Plocky,&quot; which equips him with boxing gloves; &quot;Vigilante Plok,&quot; a flamethrower-wielding character resembling the &quot;Ploxterminator&quot;; the Deerstalker-wearing &quot;Squire Plok,&quot; armed with a blunderbuss; &quot;Cowboy Plok,&quot; a gun-slinging character inspired by westerns; and &quot;Rocket Plok,&quot; equipped with multiple rocket launchers. Presents found in the Fleapit grant access to high-tech, futuristic vehicles equipped with weapons. These include a unicycle with a water cannon, an &quot;off-road truck&quot; with a rocket launcher, a jetpack with lasers, a motorbike armed with grenades, a tank, a bomb-dropping helicopter, a flying saucer with plasma cannons, and a pair of spring pogo shoes.

Players face various enemies throughout the game, including the recurring fleas. In most levels (excluding Cotton Island, Legacy Island, and Fleapit), Plok must eliminate all fleas to complete the stage. The final flea in each level drops a flag, which levitates to its flagpole, signaling that the player can proceed.

==Plot==
As king, Plok resides on Akrillic, a large island in the fictional archipelago of Polyesta. One morning, Plok discovers that the big square flag atop the pole on his house&#x27;s rooftop has been stolen, prompting him to set out in search of it. He spots the flag on Cotton Island from afar and sails there to retrieve it. However, during his search, Plok encounters several impostor flags, including a pair of underpants and a striped scarf, which only frustrate him further.

Eventually, Plok encounters the culprits responsible for the fake flags—the Bobbins Brothers, two giant creatures his grandpappy had warned him about. Plok battles the brothers to retrieve his flag.

After defeating the Bobbins Brothers and reclaiming his big square flag, Plok sails back to Akrillic, only to find the island overrun by &quot;fleas&quot;—two-legged blue insects that hatch from eggs and hop around. He learns that the flag theft was merely a ruse to lure him away from his island. Determined to reclaim his home, Plok travels across Akrillic, defeating every flea on the island&#x27;s surface to restore his kingdom.

Partway through the game, Plok places the big square flag back where it belongs outside his home and takes a break, sitting on the foot of a statue of his grandfather, Grandpappy Plok. Reflecting on the situation, Plok wishes he had found an amulet to help him deal with the fleas. He falls asleep and dreams of his grandfather&#x27;s quest for an amulet 50 years earlier.

In the dream, the player assumes the role of Grandpappy Plok, who sails from Akrillic to Legacy Island. Much like his grandson, Grandpappy faces bizarre obstacles, discovers artifacts (including Rockyfella), and encounters the Bobbin Brothers along with their third sibling, Irving.

After defeating the Bobbin Brothers and Irving, Grandpappy finally uncovers the amulet he had been seeking. He returns triumphantly to Akrillic. Back in the present, Plok wakes up and discovers that the amulet is hidden at the base of Grandpappy&#x27;s statue.

Equipped with the amulet, Plok gains the ability to &quot;charge&quot; his buzzsaw jump attack by sacrificing the shells he has collected. With his newfound power, Plok&#x27;s mission to reclaim Akrillic from the fleas resumes with greater determination.

Plok then ventures into various locations around the island, confronting creatures attempting to overthrow Akrillic: Penkinos, a group of inflatable, floating magicians of mysterious origin living in the northern part of the island; Womack, a spider residing in the island&#x27;s center whose long legs serve as its weak points; and Rockyfella, the spirit of the island&#x27;s soil, who resides beneath the mountains in the island&#x27;s southeast and harbors resentment toward Plok for planting flagpoles in the ground.

After eliminating all the enemies on the island, Plok journeys to the Fleapit, the source of the fleas, where he utilizes various weaponized vehicles. He confronts the Flea Queen, the leader who hatched the fleas, using a high-tech &quot;secret Super-Vehicle&quot; equipped with bug spray to defeat her. Following the battle, Plok returns home to rest on his green chair.

== Development ==
=== 1988: Rare hires Zippo Games ===
In the summer of 1988, Ste and John Pickford, employees at Zippo Games—owned by John and their friend Steve Hughes—were struggling to complete games for 16-bit Atari ST and Amiga computers, with many projects being canceled. They learned that Rare was seeking developers for Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) titles. At the time, the console had yet to gain popularity in the United Kingdom. Despite viewing the 8-bit system as &quot;horribly overpriced and terribly underpowered,&quot; the Pickfords accepted the offer due to financial necessity and their admiration for the work of Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper during their time at Ultimate Play the Game. Zippo Games became the only company Rare consulted for NES development.

Although initially skeptical of the NES, the Pickfords&#x27; experience working on &quot;Ironsword&quot;—along with the Stamper brothers’ requirement that they play Mario and Zelda games on the console—gave them a newfound appreciation for the system. This shifted their development priorities from focusing on technical sophistication to emphasizing the player&#x27;s experience. This design philosophy ultimately shaped their approach to &quot;Plok!&quot;.

=== 1988–1989: &quot;Fleapit&quot; ===
While Ste was designing the shop screen for &quot;Ironsword,&quot; John conceived a character with a hangman&#x27;s hood. Ste sketched the concept in the margin of the layout. The idea of detachable limbs also emerged in this sketch, depicted with an arrow pointing to a pile of the character&#x27;s parts below it. John then envisioned a game where players captured jumping fleas, deciding to make the hangman character the protagonist. The name &quot;Plok&quot; was spontaneously coined when John placed letters from a cassette tape cover on his computer mouse. His full name, &quot;Plok the Exploding Man,&quot; highlighted his separable limbs. With John&#x27;s encouragement, Ste moved to clean sheets of paper to develop further sketches, where he refined Plok&#x27;s colors, poses, size (32x40), and expressive features, such as his wide-open mouth.

After these ideas were formed, Chris Stamper visited Zippo Games to introduce the Razz Board, a coin-op hardware system he had designed. The Pickfords were impressed by the hardware&#x27;s advanced graphics capabilities and saw an opportunity to create a &quot;real arcade game,&quot; akin to those they had admired in their youth. While they had previously worked on an Amiga-based coin-op system for &quot;World Darts,&quot; they had never developed a &quot;true&quot; arcade title. They struck a deal with Rare to use the Razz Board for their dream project, with ownership of the game property and a significant share of board sales revenue. However, the agreement also required the brothers to self-fund the project. The game was titled &quot;Fleapit&quot;.

Ste vaguely recalled &quot;Fleapit&quot; in a 2014 interview, comparing its gameplay to &quot;&quot; (2009), where the player had to catch one of several flying footballs to score a touchdown in the middle of a level. He described the game as only slightly more &quot;primitive&quot; than &quot;Plok!&quot;, with stages that scrolled horizontally and vertically, featuring more &quot;set pieces or one-off levels.&quot; The backgrounds included food items like sausages and doughnuts, along with a space level.

As development continued, Rare was primarily profiting from selling NES titles, which led them to focus less on Razz Board games like &quot;Fleapit.&quot; In 1989, Rare became the first company outside of Japan to obtain a Game Boy, instructing Zippo Games to develop a game for the handheld console. This shift in focus meant that &quot;Fleapit&quot;&#x27;s development had to be halted. The relationship between Rare and Zippo Games deteriorated after Zippo failed to complete a Game Boy title as directed, and in 1990, Rare bought out Zippo Games, renaming it Rare Manchester, which was subsequently shut down. As a result of Zippo Games&#x27; closure and dwindling funds, &quot;Fleapit&quot; was canceled half-completed in 1990. Ste admitted in 2014 that their desire to produce a coin-op led to poor business decisions, including rejecting more financially lucrative console projects.

Late in &quot;Fleapit&quot;&#x27;s development, the Pickfords secured comedian Chris Sievey to voice Plok. They contacted him in 1990 through the number listed on one of his songs, &quot;969 1909.&quot; The Pickfords met Sievey in his Frank Sidebottom costume at The Ritz venue, offering to work for free. However, shortly after, &quot;Fleapit&quot; was canceled, and Sievey never voiced the character.

=== 1990–1993: From Zippo to Software Creations ===
After leaving Zippo, John contacted Richard Hay, the head of Software Creations, the first company outside of Japan to possess a development kit for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). Hay hired the Pickfords immediately to use the kit to design and program &quot;Equinox&quot; (1993), a sequel to the NES title &quot;Solstice&quot; (1990). The Pickfords were eventually promoted to higher positions, with Ste becoming an art director and John a producer.

Meanwhile, the Pickfords continued working on &quot;Fleapit&quot;, developing new characters and locations, and creating additional pitch illustrations. Near the completion of &quot;Equinox&quot;, the Pickfords presented &quot;Fleapit&quot; to Hay, pitching it under a new name: &quot;Plok!&quot; Although the brothers and Hay considered several consoles, including the NES, Super NES, and Game Boy, only a Super NES version of the game came to fruition. Development once again required self-funding, but this time it was provided by Software Creations rather than just the Pickfords.

The &quot;Plok!&quot; team included the two brothers as producers, art directors, and designers; John Buckley as programmer; Lyndon Brooke as graphic artist; Tim and Geoff Follin as music and sound developers; Kevin Edwards and Stephen Ruddy as compressors; Dan Whitworth, who created additional graphics; and 18-year-old Chun Wah Kong, who joined in spring 1993 as a tester. Software Creations hired animators recently laid off from a Manchester studio for some of their games, including Whitworth. He animated the title screen (where Plok plays a harmonica to the theme song) while Ste was on a two-week holiday, and Whitworth&#x27;s work was enthusiastically received by the staff.

&quot;Plok!&quot; was the Pickford brothers&#x27; first experience as project managers, as well as the first time they collaborated with other developers to turn their ideas into a finished product. Buckley later admitted that &quot;Plok!&quot; was his most &quot;proud&quot; work. Kong also admitted that his experience as the game&#x27;s tester prepared him for his role as lead designer on Team Soho&#x27;s PlayStation 2 title &quot;The Getaway&quot; (2002): &quot;QA is great grounding for designers. It makes you think critically about how players approach your level; how to reward curiosity if the player wanders off the beaten track; how different approaches could break the game.&quot;

Although the Pickfords allowed Buckley and Brooke to contribute many ideas, development was not without conflict. The biggest argument occurred late in development over the game&#x27;s difficulty. While Buckley and Brooks felt the difficulty was appropriate, the Pickfords found it too overbearing. To settle the dispute, the first eight stages, originally meant for Cotton Island, were moved to the later Grandpappy Plok dream stages, and eight new, easier Cotton Island stages were created. According to Buckley, the dream levels were conceived to vary the pacing, particularly with the Amulet. Kong also reported that one of the publishers wanted the difficulty of the first level decreased, so the staff reduced the bouncing sprouts&#x27; hit points from two to one. However, in the tutorial segment of the final game, the sprouts take two hits as Plok fires an extra arm. While Software Creations did include collectible continues (called &quot;Plokontinues&quot;) for &quot;Plok!&quot;, it did not include a save battery due to the cost, and passwords were scrapped out of fear that gaming magazines would spread them.

Kong recalled that most of the game was completed near the end of &quot;Equinox&quot;″s testing.

=== Graphics and art ===
Many of &quot;Plok!&quot;″s visuals were formulated during its &quot;Fleapit&quot; stage, when it was being programmed for the Razz Board. The hardware had an unusual system that executed higher-depth graphics and performed better with fewer data. Unlike other hardware that used bitmap grids to encode colors and transparency through binary numbers, the Razz Board hardware stored pixels as bytes, with the first six bits determining color, the seventh bit setting its vertical position relative to its predecessor, and the eighth determining its horizontal position. For instance, using a bitmap system to create a 32-pixel line requires a grid of 1,024 pixels (32x32) with 992 of them being transparent, whereas making the same line took only 32 bytes in Razz Board. This meant sprites weren&#x27;t restricted to perfectly square sizes, which Ste took advantage of when creating the text font, although he set an arbitrary limit of 22x29. For the SNES game, Brooke designed two new fonts for 16x16 and 8x8 bitmap grids: one based on Ste&#x27;s font for &quot;Fleapit&quot;, which in turn was based on his lettering in concept drawings, and another for the silent movie-esque screens in the Legacy Island levels. Software Creations&#x27; leader and &quot;Plok!&quot; executive producer Mike Webb reported compressing 50% of the game&#x27;s 16-megabit graphics data (equivalent to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;) down to eight megabits.

&quot;Fleapit&quot; was the Pickfords&#x27; first game in which Ste created concept art, aiming to appear more professional and adapt to an increased focus on presentation for buyers in the industry. According to Ste, this shift changed the process of green-lighting a game, moving beyond simply starting programming: &quot;Everyone in the industry was self-taught, and there were no standards or expectations of how a new game should progress. I remember it being a struggle to justify spending work time drawing pretty pictures which wouldn&#x27;t actually contribute to the game.&quot; Ste added shades to the concept art using Letratone as an easy method to achieve a businesslike aesthetic. He drew the illustrations in black and white, focusing more on shape than on color, as photocopying technology at the time only allowed monochrome prints. The color scheme was initially designed for an 8-bit arcade title; to achieve a &quot;natural&quot; look, colors were concentrated into extreme areas of the RGB color wheel. When the project evolved into a 16-bit SNES game, the color scheme—though generally the same—became more detailed with a wider palette, and Ste used magic markers to color the concept art. This art was used not only for the game but also for other titles and potential franchise products, as well as illustrations for the instruction manual.

John&#x27;s first plan for maximizing the use of the Razz Board was through Plok&#x27;s animation; since he had separable limbs, all six parts were animated as independently-moving static sprites. The separated limbs made Plok easier to animate and reduced the graphical data required, as static parts could be coded to move and rotate instead of creating multiple frames. Ste also designed Plok&#x27;s boots and gloves to be oversized, maximizing the potential of the detachable-limb design. The fleas, though animated traditionally with frames, had only two legs to simplify animating extreme poses and prevent the sprite from becoming too busy. Ste reported using &quot;5 or 6&quot; frames for all of the fleas&#x27; movements. For the SNES console, Brooke only slightly altered the design of Plok and the fleas, but Plok&#x27;s animation method was transformed. The SNES, using the traditional bitmap method to execute pixels, required Brooke to animate Plok frame-by-frame.

=== Concepts and design ===
&quot;Fleapit&quot; characters not included in &quot;Plok!&quot; include Armstrong, a &quot;mini-version&quot; of Rockyfella; and Suki, a manga-style character who ran an item shop. The Bobbins Brothers and Womack were carried over from &quot;Fleapit&quot; (although Womack underwent a major redesign by Brooke, which Ste appreciated) while the Penkinos were originally conceived for &quot;Plok!&quot;.

The &quot;floating&quot; limb movements were coded in John&#x27;s first prototype of &quot;Fleapit&quot;, with the idea of removing limbs incorporated later as the Pickfords experimented. The concept of costume and vehicle power-ups also originated in &quot;Fleapit&quot;, although the set of power-ups changed, with only the helicopter carrying over; &quot;Fleapit&quot;-exclusive power-ups included &quot;Robo Plok,&quot; a robot form that improved maneuverability and was inspired by Ro-Jaws from the &quot;2000 AD&quot; comics; &quot;Ninja Plok,&quot; which armed him with an endless supply of throwing stars; and &quot;Super Plok,&quot; a superhero form with flying abilities. Plok also had the &quot;smart bomb,&quot; an ability in which he enraged himself to the point of exploding and wiping out all enemies on screen (as well as his own limbs).

By the time development of the SNES game began, the code for &quot;Fleapit&quot; had been lost. As a result, Buckley started programming based on what he saw in VHS footage of the game, including Plok attacking fleas with his limbs and skidding down slanted platforms. Brooke conceived the idea of triggering parts of the scenery with limbs, reasoning that the scenery &quot;looked a bit rough&quot; when constantly looping. However, executing this idea proved difficult, as it affected the collision detection and caused Plok&#x27;s movements to be jerky. He came up with the limb-holding coat hangers two weeks later. The vehicles were left for the final stages, as incorporating them into earlier levels would have required too much work to &quot;balance&quot; them with the other aspects of those stages.

=== Audio ===


When it came to NES and SNES titles, Software Creations was notable for pushing the limits of a hardware&#x27;s sound, including with &quot;Plok!&quot;. Work on &quot;Plok!&quot;″s soundtrack, composed by Tim and Geoff Follin, began halfway through development. It was categorized by &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; as typical of other kid-friendly platform games, though &quot;a bit manic, deceptively bombastic, and diverse in tone&quot;. Ste reported that Geoff did around 75% of the work and was far more open to discussion with the team, while Tim was more &quot;elusive&quot;.

&quot;Plok!&quot; continues the Follin brothers&#x27; incorporation of old rock music influences. For instance, &quot;A Line in the Sand&quot; was inspired by the works of Stevie Wonder, with its guitar solo influenced by Queen guitarist Brian May. Tim Follin composed the title song using a two-chord progression from &quot;Tequila&quot; by rock and roll group The Champs, as two guitar chord samples could fit within the memory limitations. &quot;Lead&quot; instruments, such as an electric guitar and harmonicas, were made from simple waveforms, with the guitar&#x27;s waveform being identical to a square. A breathing sample in the boss theme was also used in &quot;Equinox&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man and the X-Men in Arcade&#x27;s Revenge&quot; (1992).

The soundtrack has been released on physical formats twice. On July 27, 2019, it was issued on cassette by CANVAS Ltd. It was also released as a limited-edition 500-copy double vinyl on Record Store Day (April 18) 2020 by Respawned Records; Respawned&#x27;s release featured official song titles, liner notes, and artwork by the Pickfords, with both 180-gram vinyl records colored red and yellow. Rare composer David Wise has expressed admiration for &quot;Plok!&quot;, claiming his work on &quot;Donkey Kong Country&quot; was inspired by the Follin brothers&#x27; soundtrack.

== Release ==
=== Publishing ===
Software Creations was so confident in &quot;Plok!&quot; that the developer tried to persuade Nintendo to publish it. Reception from the corporation&#x27;s Japan and American branches was positive. Shigeru Miyamoto expressed strong interest in working on the game; when &quot;Plok!&quot; was only half-finished, he wrote a letter to Hay claiming it was the third-best platform game, below Sonic and Mario, and that he would make it the second-greatest in the genre, above Sonic but below Mario. Tony Harman, product acquisitions and development manager at Nintendo of America, also visited the studio to play &quot;Plok!&quot; four weeks into its development, and told Kay that Miyamoto was amazed by the game&#x27;s audio, to the point of analyzing it. However, Nintendo only published &quot;Plok!&quot; in Europe, while Tradewest and Activision published it in North America and Japan, respectively. While Nintendo&#x27;s reasons for this remain undisclosed, Ste believes that Miyamoto found the game, particularly its mini-race levels, too similar to the then-in-development first-party title &quot;Super Mario World 2: Yoshi&#x27;s Island&quot;.

A port for the Sega Genesis was planned but ultimately cancelled for unknown reasons.

=== Promotion ===
The Pickfords, despite owning the IP and developing &quot;Plok!&quot;, were never consulted on its promotion. Tradewest set &quot;Plok!&quot;″s primary demographic at gamers aged six to fourteen. Although published by Tradewest in the United States, &quot;Plok!&quot; still received promotion from Nintendo of America; a complete guide and review was published in the October 1993 issue of its magazine &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;, and a two-page section in a &quot;Nintendo Player&#x27;s Guide&quot; book for &quot;Mario Paint&quot; (1993) included templates of body part stamps to animate Plok and the flea enemies, along with a background painting based on one of the Cotton Island levels. In the United Kingdom, Nintendo released a VHS tape, &quot;Super Mario All-Stars Video&quot; (1993); hosted by Craig Charles, the video features a segment of testers at Nintendo UK promoting upcoming games, including &quot;Plok!&quot; &quot;Club Nintendo&quot;, Germany&#x27;s official Nintendo magazine, ran a comic strip where Plok races with Mario at an Olympic match in space.

Some print advertising was later criticized by Ste for not showcasing enough of the game itself. Tradewest&#x27;s US print advertisement depicted the top half taken up by &quot;Double Dragon&quot; and &quot;Battletoads&quot;, with the bottom half showing an image of the Plok character; the only information revealed was that &quot;Plok!&quot; was published by the two other franchises. Nintendo&#x27;s UK print ad depicted a faux desktop screenshot with an image of an angry old lady in the house as the wallpaper; the only &quot;Plok!&quot; visual depicted was its box art, placed in the bottom right and very small-sized.

However, other print advertisements were much more true to the game, such as Tradewest&#x27;s series of comic book panel ads named &quot;The Adventures of Plok&quot;, which explored Plok&#x27;s origins within the storyline.

&quot;Plok!&quot; was first announced in June 1993; upon its announcement, an &quot;N-Force&quot; journalist called it one of the most &quot;surreal&quot; games in the September 1993 line-up. Tradewest presented &quot;Plok!&quot; at the summer 1993 Consumer Electronics Show; a &quot;GameFan&quot; writer called Tradewest &quot;one of the [show&#x27;s] most impressive third-party line-ups,&quot; highlighting &quot;Plok!&quot; as &quot;a colorful new action title with a lead character that hurls his arms and legs at attackers.&quot;

== Reception ==
=== Contemporaneous reviews ===
Upon release, some critics declared &quot;Plok!&quot; the best Nintendo release of 1993, as well as another classic by the company, the best platform game of the year, and one of the all-time best in the genre. However, &quot;Plok!&quot; was often compared to many other games of its kind, and even the most favorable reviewers expressed skepticism about playing yet another average, colorful, cutesy platform game. Some critics ultimately thought it was and criticized its lack of depth. A frequent comparison was made to &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; (1991), particularly in its &quot;sugary&quot; tone and Plok&#x27;s speed ball attack; &quot;GameStar&quot;″s FI derogatorily labeled the titular character as &quot;a puny version&quot; of the Sega franchise&#x27;s blue hedgehog, criticizing his weird design and calling him names such as &quot;hot pink reddy coloured duck penguin thing&quot; and &quot;freaky pork chop.&quot;

However, other reviewers opined that &quot;Plok!&quot; was distinguished in the genre, noting innovative aspects such as the costume and weapon power-ups and limb mechanics. Reviews also enjoyed its humor, such as with Plok&#x27;s limbless movements, his power-ups, and nonsensical story; Humphreys felt it would help the game be enjoyed by even the biggest detractors of kid-friendly platformers. The hero was applauded for being charming, more lovable than other mascots of its kind, and versatile, particularly with his limbs and his costume and weapon power-ups. Trenton Webb found the limb mechanic &quot;quite fun to mess around with uselessly,&quot; and an &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; critic called it &quot;catchy&quot; with &quot;plenty of situations to test it.&quot; &quot;Superjuegos&quot; writer The Elf called his vehicle power-ups &quot;fantastic and fun,&quot; and &quot;Hyper&quot; magazine&#x27;s Jason Humphreys claimed the cowboy power-up was his favorite.

Some critics were addicted to &quot;Plok!&quot;s gameplay and eulogized its playability, perfect control, and variety. &quot;Super Play&quot;s Jonathan Davies felt it kept adding new concepts as the game went on, and praised some of them, such as patterns of item placements directing the player to off-camera platforms and bouncing off water instead of drowning to death.

&quot;Plok!&quot;&#x27;s difficulty was also highlighted, mostly attributed to the lack of a password system, save feature, and the requirement for continues to be earned. Other contributors to the challenge included long stage lengths and sudden obstacles such as rolling logs. One &quot;Total!&quot; journalist reported being confused about what action to take next in some stages, and another from &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot; disclosed getting lost in levels and being unable to locate targets and fleas required to complete levels. While some reviewers approved of the game&#x27;s difficulty, others disliked not being able to save or use passwords, reasoning it was annoying to replay earlier stages repeatedly.

The cartoony graphics were praised as colorful, surreal, adorable, and featuring &quot;vivid backgrounds&quot;;. One reviewer called them some of the best on the Super Nintendo, while another compared them to &quot;Equinox&quot;. FI appreciated the detail, such as Plok&#x27;s breathing animation when standing still and the many &quot;little colored flowers everywhere, looking like real flower power stuff.&quot; The music was highlighted (by one critic as the game&#x27;s best aspect) and noted for pushing the hardware limitations, and sound effects were praised.

=== Commercial performance and plans for a franchise ===
John Pickford and Kay had faith in &quot;Plok!&quot; being commercially successful. The Pickford brothers secured IP ownership of the Plok character, a practice common in other media industries but rare in the video game industry; and they planned a franchise around it, including sequels, ports, and merchandise. A Mega Drive version was planned using software created by a Software Creations employee to automatically convert SNES titles into Mega Drive games; 80% of the code was automatically converted, according to Ste, with the remaining 20% requiring manual work. However, despite Webb announcing the port&#x27;s completion in an April 1994 interview, it was never released for unknown reasons.

Ste, using magic markers, created artwork for future sequels and merchandise, such as style guides for the characters and illustrations of scenes. The Pickfords planned for sequels to involve Plok searching for the fleas&#x27; home, introduce a setting named Tower Island, and make Plok&#x27;s comfy chair (which he sleeps on in the end credits of &quot;Plok!&quot;) a more significant part of the gameplay. The Pickfords also created concepts for toys used to pitch the SNES game, including a doll where limbs were attached and detached with velcro. During marketing, a Plok model was created in 3D Studio 4 for a promotional photo by Software Creations.

However, in 1992, late in &quot;Plok!&quot;″s development, the market saw a saturation of colorful platform games starring cute mascots, such as &quot;Bubsy&quot; and &quot;Zool&quot;. Ste, in 2004, publicly stated that developers and producers with more financial backing were aware of previews of the &quot;Fleapit&quot; coin-op, which may have influenced them to produce similar games; though there are no other reports verifying this. Although the game sold decently over time, none of the revenue went to the Pickfords, and Ste suggested that the market saturation significantly hindered its commercial performance; this, combined with Software Creations constantly changing publishers between projects, made the &quot;Plok!&quot; franchise impossible for several years.

== Legacy ==
In 2009, North American company Super Fighter Team released &quot;Zaku&quot;, a horizontal shooter for the Atari Lynx, which features a special guest appearance by Plok.

The Pickfords later launched a Plok webcomic. The webcomic takes place 20 years after the game, featuring new characters as well as returning ones like Rockyfella. The comic occasionally used pop-culture references from other games and media, along with in-jokes and commentaries on the game&#x27;s development and future.

In later years, &quot;Plok&quot; was ranked the 26th best SNES title of all time (and the best platformer produced in the United Kingdom) in 1996, the 19th best platform game by &quot;Gamereactor&quot; in 2014, and was listed in &quot;Edge&quot; editor Tony Mott&#x27;s &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot; in its 2013 edition. Video game elements introduced in &quot;Plok!&quot; were noted by retrospective journalists as being present in more popular platformers released in later years. Games starring characters with floating body parts used as weapons, such as &quot;Dynamite Headdy&quot; (1994) and &quot;Rayman&quot; (1995), were released shortly afterward and garnered much wider exposure. When listing &quot;Plok!&quot; on a list of &quot;The Most Unappreciated Platformers of the &#x27;90s&quot; for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, Ben Bertoli wrote it was &quot;influential for portraying a world, named Akrill[ic], based on craft supplies and cloth, a concept that Nintendo itself has come to rely on for many games. The game also provided players with power-ups and vehicles, such as flamethrowers and jetpacks, the likes of which had not been seen in a single game.&quot; Sepia-toned flashback stages also featured prominently in &quot;Mickey Mania&quot; (1994).

<text>In Gamilaraay mythology, Bahloo is a male spirit representing the moon. The most known tale about him is a story about the origin of death.

== Myths ==
Bahloo and the Daens

The most notable myth seeks to explain both man&#x27;s mortality and the hatred between snakes and men, much as does the Judeo-Christian story of the Garden of Eden. In the tale, Bahloo takes his snakes (calling them his &#x27;dogs&#x27;) out for a walk at night. He comes upon a group of men and asks them to carry the snakes across a river for him. They were afraid, and refused, so he did it himself, with two snakes coiled around each arm and one around his neck. He threw a piece of bark on the water, which floated, and a stone, which sank. He declared that he was like the bark, always rising again, but that the men would be like the stone, and sink to the bottom when they were dead. The men, who had always feared the snakes, now hated them and killed them whenever they saw one. Bahloo always sent more, to remind the people that they had not done what he asked.

Bahloo and Wahn

One Aboriginal legend tells of how Bahloo was once a clever man who lived with Wahn, the Crow, and Buumayamayal, the fly catcher lizard, creating the babies of the world. One day, Wahn asks Bahloo, in addition to making new babies, that they resurrect the dead as well. Bahloo refused this request, making Wahn very upset. Upon seeing a large gum tree, Wahn asks to Bahloo climb the tree for grubs. He then breathed on the gum tree, causing it to grow into the sky. This is where Bahloo stayed, explaining why the Moon travels across the sky.

Bahloo and Yhi

During Bahloo’s travels, Yhi, the Sun, courts Bahloo, but he refused her advances. The myth says that this is why the Sun chased the Moon across the sky. Yhi threatened the spirits who held up the sky that if they let him escape down to Earth, she would plunge the world into darkness.

Nevertheless, Bahloo is sometimes seen walking on the Earth in Gamilaraay myth. He does so by disguising himself as the spirit emu, tricking the spirits and going back to Earth to once again reclaim his post of creating baby girls.

<doc id="668755" wikidata="Q133024" url="?curid=668755" title="Teinolophos">
<text>Teinolophos is a prehistoric species of monotreme, or egg-laying mammal, from the Teinolophidae. It is known from four specimens, each consisting of a partial lower jawbone collected from the Wonthaggi Formation at Flat Rocks, Victoria, Australia. It lived during the late Barremian age of the Lower Cretaceous.

The species name honours the artist Peter Trusler. The genus name, &quot;Teinolophos&quot;, means &quot;extended ridge&quot;, a reference to its tooth structure.

Originally, &quot;Teinolophos&quot; was thought to be a eupantothere. Further research revealed similarities to &quot;Steropodon&quot;, except in size: the animal was around 10 cm long. It is often listed as a steropodontid, though it may be more basal. &quot;Teinolophos&quot; is deeply divergent within monotreme evolution, so in 2022 it was proposed to move it into its own family, Teinolophidae. &quot;Stirtodon&quot; may be a close relative of &quot;Steropodon&quot; within Teinolophidae.

The holotype is a partial left dentary known as NMV P208231. An age of approximately 123 million years makes this the earliest known monotreme. The lower molar is broadly similar in morphology to the m2 of &quot;Steropodon&quot;. The trigonid is compressed and the talonid has no basin. The dentary is about one sixth the size of &quot;Steropodon&quot;, and wear facets indicate an &quot;orthal&quot; occlusion with the upper molars.

==Description==

===Jaw===
The construction of the lower jaw differs from existing monotremes. Among the contrasts are the condyle, which is well above the tooth row (instead of at about the same height); and the ascending ramus, which is also higher. Also different is that &quot;Teinolophos&quot; probably had a strong bite. A unique feature for known toothed monotremes is that the trigonid is tall, while the talonid is set much lower. This is more like the general mammalian arrangement. The molar is double-rooted, which is plesiomorphic when compared to ornithorhynchids, but is a shared characteristic with &quot;Steropodon&quot; and &quot;Kollikodon&quot;. Subsequent monotreme molars are multi-rooted.

Unlike modern monotremes, &quot;Teinolophos&quot; lacked a beak.

===Ears===
Unlike modern monotremes, which have suspended ear bones much like placentals and marsupials, &quot;Teinolophos&quot; still had them connected to the jaw via the Meckel&#x27;s cartilage. This reinforces the idea that the modern ear condition evolved independently among monotremes and therians.

===Evolution===
One study interpreted &quot;Teinolophos&quot; as a basal platypus.

<text>Jack Kracken, born Emil Ecklund, was a Norwegian–American boxer of the 1930s. He was the first person to ever fight Joe Louis as a professional.

==Biography==
Emil Ecklund was born on August 13, 1899, in Lillehammer in Oppland county, Norway. Ecklund emigrated from Gudbrandsdal to the United States. Emil Ecklund climbed into the ring under his real name and as Jack Kracken in a journeyman&#x27;s career that lasted 17 professional boxing matches between 1930 and 1934.

In 1930, Ecklund dropped three consecutive matches in Illinois. On April 1, in Springfield, Illinois, he was knocked out in round three by George Kutulis, lost a six-round decision to Fred Caldori on April 25 in Chicago and suffered a technical knockout at the hands of King Levinsky on August 29 in Chicago. The losing streak stretched to four when Ecklund was KO&#x27;d by Walter Pickard on March 30, 1931, in Louisville, Kentucky.

From November 30, 1931, to November 2, 1932, Ecklund toured four Washington cities and Vancouver, British Columbia for a pair of wins over Sam Eisman and a victory over Jack Yenter. On December 2, 1932, in Bremerton, Washington, Battling Mix knocked down Ecklund five times. On February 13, 1933, Ecklund defeated Chick McBride in rounds two and three at the Bremerton Athletic Club and subsequently in Silverdale, Washington, on February 23, 1933. 
Jack Kracken is best remembered as the first boxer defeated by Joe Louis on July 4, 1934, in the first round of a scheduled six-round bout at Bacon Casino on Chicago&#x27;s South Side. Kracken was one of Chicago&#x27;s top heavyweights at the time he fought Louis. It was Kracken&#x27;s last appearance in the ring. Jack Kracken finished his career with 10 wins (all by knockout) and 7 losses.

<text>A town crier, also called a bellman, is an officer of a royal court or public authority who makes public pronouncements as required.

==Duties and functions==
The town crier was used to make public announcements in the streets. Criers often dressed elaborately, by a tradition dating to the 18th century, in a red and gold coat, white breeches, black boots and a tricorne hat.

In English-speaking countries, they carried a handbell to attract people&#x27;s attention, as they shouted the words &quot;Oyez, Oyez, Oyez!&quot; before making their announcements. The word &quot;Oyez&quot; means &quot;hear ye,&quot; which is a call for silence and attention. &quot;Oyez&quot; derives from the Anglo-Norman word for &quot;listen&quot; (modern French, &quot;oyez&quot;, infinitive, &quot;ouïr&quot;, but has been largely replaced by the verb &quot;écouter&quot;). The proclamations book in Chester from the early 19th century records this as &quot;O Yes, O Yes!&quot;.

==History==

===Europe===
Prior to widespread literacy, town criers were the means of communication with the people of the town since many people could not read or write. Proclamations, local bylaws, market days, advertisements, were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier.

In ancient Rome, they typically proclaimed public business during the market days that formed a kind of weekend every eight days.

In Goslar, Germany, a crier was employed to remind the local populace not to urinate or defecate in the river the day before water was drawn for brewing beer.

Bells were frequently used to attract attention, but not always – in the Netherlands, a gong was the instrument of choice for many, and a drum or a hunting horn was used in France.

In the observance of Allhallowtide, &quot;it was customary for criers dressed in black to parade the streets, ringing a bell of mournful sound and calling on all good Christians to remember the poor souls.&quot;

====Britain====
In order to gain the attention of the crowd, the crier would yell, &quot;Hear ye&quot; – &quot;Oyez&quot;.

In medieval England, town criers were the chief means of news communication with the townspeople, since many were illiterate in a period before the moveable type was invented. Royal proclamations, local bylaws, market days, advertisements, even selling loaves of sugar were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier throughout the centuries—at Christmas 1798, the Chester Canal Company sold some sugar damaged in their packet boat and this was to be advertised by the bellman.

The crier also escorted the destitute to the workhouse, installed minor criminals in the stocks and administered floggings. During public hangings he read out why the person was being hanged, and helped to cut him or her down.

Chester records of 1540 show fees due to the bellman included:
In 1620, there was a fight at the Chester cross between the butchers and the bakers where the &quot;Cryer brake his Mace in peeces Amonge them&quot;. In 1607, one public notice read by George Tunnall, the bellman, forbade tipping rubbish in the river.

In 1715, a local man recorded that the:
Salmon fishing season was also closed by the bellman.

The term &quot;Posting A Notice&quot; comes from the act of the town crier, who having read his message to the townspeople, would attach it to the door post of the local inn. Some newspapers took the name &quot;The Post&quot; for this reason.

Town criers were protected by law, as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases. Anything done by the town crier was done in the name of the ruling monarch and harming a town crier was considered to be treason. The phrase &quot;don&#x27;t shoot the messenger&quot; was a real command.

There are two organisations representing town criers including the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers and Loyal Company of Town Criers.

A copy of a royal proclamation announcing the dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom is delivered by hand from the Privy Council Office to Mansion House in the City of London. It is then read out by the Common Crier of the City on the steps of the Royal Exchange in the heart of the City, having been handed to him by the Common Serjeant of the City, ahead of the proclamation also being read out in the London boroughs.

Beetty Dick (1693-1773) was a woman town crier in Dalkeith, Midlothian, Scotland in the mid 18th century, succeeded by three further women town criers.

===North America===
There have been town criers in North America ever since Europeans have been coming to the continent, and the First Nations peoples including the Nakota and Comanches have had the eyapaha (village crier). There are records throughout the 16th century of town criers in Mexico, Peru, and Panama. During the 1830s and 40s Halifax, Nova Scotia had as many as four in the city. All through the American Colonies and beyond, such as Santa Fe, New Mexico; Boston, Massachusetts and Stamford, Connecticut had criers during the mid 17th century. In some places, the office of town crier persisted into the early 20th century. At least as recently as 1904, Los Angeles and several adjacent towns had official town criers. The town of Provincetown, Massachusetts, has had an active Town Crier from the 1840s up to the present day.

===Asia===

====India====
In many parts of India, the village crier traditionally carried a rustic drum to call public attention, following up with the message. 

====Nepal====
In Nepal, the town crier is called a &quot;katuwal&quot; which derives from local Tibetic, &quot;kat&quot; &#x27;voice&#x27; + an Indic suffix &quot;-wal&quot; &#x27;kind of a person

====Sri Lanka====
In Sri Lanka, traditionally criers would carry a specific drum to call public attention (called tom-tom beating), following up with the message. The practice dates back from ancient times as it was used by Sri Lankan kingdoms through the colonial period up on to the modern times and was known as &quot;Ana Bera&quot; (Announcement drum beating). The practice was used by municipal or village councils until the late ninetieth century when the practice was replaced by modern communication mediums. The use of a tom-tom beating announcer is still defined in legal statutes for situations for public notification in situations such as partition of lands. It is however not practiced.

===Africa===

Town criers were prominent in the precolonial and colonial eras of Igboland, a West African region in the present-day Nigeria. They served as the major means of information dissemination in their respective communities.

==Modern town criers==

When the need for a town crier disappeared, the position passed into local folklore. Informal and later formal town crier competitions were held from the early 20th century. Subsequently, some cities and towns reinstated the post purely for ceremonial purposes.

Many local councils in England and Wales reinstated the post of town crier from the mid-1990s onwards (e.g. Chester). Many are honorary appointments or employed part-time by the council. In October 2010, there were 144 towns in England and Wales with town criers registered with the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers. They mainly perform ceremonial duties at civic functions. Local councils with a paid town crier often make them available for charity events.

In the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, the town crier is also appointed the tipstaff, an appointment which exists in no other local council.
In England, town criers still announce the births of royal heirs and occasionally the arrival of the royal family. Tony Appleton, an octogenarian and self-proclaimed “royalist crier,” took it upon himself to announce, as loudly as he can, important news about the royal family. Appleton has served as town crier for the nearby town of Romford, but he does not represent the royal family. Appleton admitted as much in 2013, when news outlets were confused by his presence.

There are several town crier guilds in both Canada and the United States. These include the Ontario Guild of Town Criers, the Nova Scotia Guild of Town Criers and the American Guild of Town Criers. In 2016, the town of Burlingame, California added a town crier.

In Australia, as of October 2010, the City of Sydney, City of Hobart, City of Greater Geelong, City of Portland, City of Ipswich, City of Gosford, City of Salisbury, City of Gold Coast and 22 other local councils had an official town crier.

===Competitions and records===

European, Canadian, American, North American and Australian championships are held in alternating years with the World Championships.

The best dressed town crier at the World Championships in 2008 was Daniel Richer dit La Flêche representing the cities of Ottawa and Gatineau, in Canada.

The Best Dressed Couple were Peter and Maureen Taunton from the county town of Stafford, in Staffordshire, England. Richard Riddell of Anacortes, in the state of Washington in the United States, was the 2008 American Champion and winner of the 2009 Bermuda International Town Crier Competition. He was awarded Best Dressed and tied for First Runner-up at the 2010 World Tournament at Chester in England and Overall Winner at the 2013 World Invitational Town Crier Competition held in Kingston, in Ontario, Canada.

Peter Moore, the London Town Crier, held the position for more than 30 years. He was Town Crier to the Mayor of London, the City of Westminster, and London boroughs, and was also a freeman and liveryman of the City of London. He died on 20 December 2009.

Alan Myatt holds two Guinness World Records. As well as being the loudest crier (recording a cry of 112.8 decibels), he also set the record for vocal endurance, issuing a one-hundred word proclamation every 15 minutes for a period of 48 hours.

Daniel Richer dit La Flêche, who is a member of the First Nations Abenaki tribe, is a full-time bilingual town crier. David Hinde, Bridlington Town Crier, was measured at 114.8 decibels.

Taking place from the 20th to 23 August 2014, Chris Whyman from Kingston, Ontario, Canada, was declared the winner of the 2014 World Town Crier Tournament in Chester.

<text>Pocky &amp; Rocky is a 1992 scrolling shooter video game developed and published by Natsume for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (Super NES). It is the sequel to Taito&#x27;s 1986 arcade game &quot;KiKi KaiKai&quot;. &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; follows the adventures of a young Shinto shrine maiden, Pocky, and her new tanuki companion, Rocky, as they attempt to save a group of goblins from evil forces. Gameplay takes place from a top-down perspective and features both single-player and cooperative modes.

The game was generally well-received by critics. It was followed by &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky 2&quot; (1994) and &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky with Becky&quot; (2001). A new entry, &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrined&quot;, released in 2022.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; is a scrolling shooter video game that takes place from a top-down perspective. The screen can move either horizontally or vertically and the player-controlled characters can move in eight directions. The game features six levels and allows its players to continue indefinitely. In single-player mode, the player can choose to play as either Pocky or Rocky. In two-player cooperative mode, both characters are on the screen at the same time.

Pocky can use her to hit enemies from afar or swing her gohei to damage enemies close up. Likewise, Rocky can throw leaves across the screen or quickly turn his backside and swing his tail. Both characters can slide across the ground to cover the area quickly. If a player bumps into the other while sliding in a two-player game, it will cause the other player to spin out of control across the screen, damaging any enemies they come in contact with. A limited-use special bomb attack can be used to hit several or all the enemies present on the screen. There are some differences between both characters. Pocky moves and slides slightly faster than Rocky does. However, Rocky&#x27;s slide attack goes a long distance. Pocky&#x27;s bomb attack is more powerful than Rocky&#x27;s, although Rocky&#x27;s bombs cover a wider area. Pocky can also perform a spinning attack, whereas Rocky is able to transform into an invulnerable and immobile statue for a short time.

Various power-ups can be acquired that will increase the effectiveness of either Pocky or Rocky&#x27;s attacks, such as making their projectiles larger or giving them the ability to throw multiple ones at once. Others include a shield that absorbs enemy attacks, and a power-up that replenishes hit points, giving Pocky and Rocky more endurance. A floating being called &quot;Help man&quot; is hidden in each level that will drop power-ups when found.

==Plot==
Set in a Far East-themed world, &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; is about a young miko girl named Pocky (known in Japan as ) who is tending to a Shinto shrine when she is visited by Rocky the Tanuki, or raccoon dog (known in Japan as ). Rocky is a member of a group of creatures known as the Nopino Goblins. Some time ago, the Nopino Goblins (Yōkai in Japan) went insane, but were stopped and cured by Pocky. Rocky tells Pocky that the Nopino Goblins have gone insane yet again and that she must help them. Suddenly, Pocky and Rocky are ambushed by the Nopino Goblins, which appear to be under a spell. Together, Pocky and Rocky must unravel the mystery of who is controlling the Nopino Goblins. Throughout the game, they battle a number of creatures from Japanese mythology, including kappas.

==Release==
&quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; was licensed by Taito to Natsume, who developed and published the game for release in Japan in 1992 and the rest of the world in 1993. It is the sequel to the 1986 arcade game &quot;KiKi KaiKai&quot;. In Japan, &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; was broadcast on the Satellaview service on June 6, 1997.

==Reception==
&quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; was generally well-received by critics, with some calling the gameplay addictive. The two-player mode was considered by some reviewers to add a lot of value to the game. In addition, the controls were considered easy to pick up and play. On the other hand, some reviewers experienced slowdowns in frame rate. The graphics of the game, especially the backgrounds and enemies, received praise for being colorful and well-animated, many comparing it to &quot;The Legend of the Mystical Ninja&quot; in graphical style. The special effects and weather effects in the game were also well received by reviewers. However, some critics commented on the lack of parallax scrolling and Mode 7 effects. The music and sound were positively received, and many critics thought it fit the theme and setting of the game well. In 1996, Super Play ranked the game 91st on their Top 100 SNES Games of All Time.
==Sequels==
&quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; spawned three official sequels and one spiritual successor. In &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky 2&quot; (1994) for SNES, Pocky and Rocky must work together once again to stop a forced marriage between a princess and a tyrant. In the second sequel, &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky with Becky&quot; (2001) for Game Boy Advance, the duo are joined by their friend Becky to stop a hydra dragon. The latest entry, &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky Reshrined&quot;, was released for the PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in 2022, and on Windows in 2023.

UFO Interactive Games released a spiritual successor to the series, &quot;Heavenly Guardian&quot; (2007), developed by Starfish for the PlayStation 2 and Wii.

<doc id="668766" wikidata="Q575780" url="?curid=668766" title="Upington">
<text>Upington () is a town founded in 1873 and located in the Northern Cape province of South Africa, on the banks of the Orange River. The town was originally called Olijvenhoutsdrift (&#x27;Olive wood drift&#x27;), due to the abundance of olive wood trees in the area, but later renamed after Sir Thomas Upington, Attorney-General and then Prime Minister of the Cape. It originated as a mission station established in 1871 and run by Reverend Christiaan Schröder. The mission station now houses the Kalahari Orange Museum. The museum is also the home of a donkey statue, which recognises the enormous contribution that this animal made to the development of the region during the pioneering days of the 19th century.

The elevation of Upington is 2,742 feet (835 metres). It is the closest large centre to the Augrabies Falls (arguably the greatest of South African waterfalls) and the Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park. The landscape is very arid but the soil is fertile and crops such as fruit are grown in irrigated fields. The area is best known for its export-quality grapes, raisins and wines, which are cultivated on the rich flood plains of the Orange River.

==The Upington 26==
On 13 November 1985, a black policeman was killed following a disturbance at a political meeting in Paballelo, a black township on the outskirts of Upington. Twenty-six people were charged with the killing, of whom twenty-five were convicted of murder on the basis of common purpose, and one convicted of attempted murder. Fourteen were sentenced to death, although the death sentences were later overturned on appeal. In 2011, a memorial in honour of the Upington 26 was unveiled in Upington by Hazel Jenkins, the Premier of the Northern Cape. In 2014, the Australian film &quot;A Common Purpose&quot; was made about the case.

== Wine industry ==
Upington&#x27;s most famous wines are produced by an organisation known as Orange River Cellars. The organisation has six depots in the area (all of them on the banks of the Orange River) at Upington, Kanoneiland, Grootdrink, Kakamas, Keimoes and Groblershoop. Their wines are exported, &quot;inter alia&quot;, to Europe and the USA.

== Transportation ==

Upington Airport has scheduled flights provided by SA Airlink. Due to the combination of high elevation and temperature, one of the airport&#x27;s runways is 4,900 m long (the fourth longest in the world), and thus allows Boeing 747 and other heavy aircraft to use the airport without limitations on take-off weight.

In the first half of the 20th century, there was a passenger train service from Cape Town to Upington. Until the 1950s, a narrow-gauge railway line (two-foot gauge) ran from Upington to Kakamas and Keimoes, two nearby towns. The trains carried passengers and freight, being mainly dried fruit. The line to Kakamas was still in use during the November 2010 grape harvest season.

== Public institutions ==
There are four libraries that serve the community in Upington, viz, Rosedale Library, Upington Library, Korrektiewe and Forum Library.

== Geography and climate ==

Upington is located on the northern banks of the Orange River and is surrounded by irrigated vineyards. The hottest month of the year is January, with average daily temperatures swinging from to , while in the coolest month of July temperatures range between and . Also the driest month of the year, July sees an average rainfall of only , while the wettest month of March sees .
Upington has been noted as being the sunniest location on the planet for three months of the year, from November through January.

Upington has a hot desert climate (BWh) with long, hot summers and short, mild winters. Precipitation peaks during late summertime.

<doc id="668769" wikidata="Q1699423" url="?curid=668769" title="John Broome (politician)">
<text>John Broome (July 19, 1738 – August 8, 1810) was an American merchant and politician who was the lieutenant governor of New York, from 1804 to 1810.

==Early life==
Broome was born on Staten Island in the Province of New York on July 19, 1738. He was the youngest of four children born to Samuel Broome (1685/93–1771), a staunch Presbyterian, and Marie (née LaTourette) Broome (1693–1774). His maternal grandparents were Jean LaTourette and Marie Mercereau, who were French Huguenots.

Broome studied law with William Livingston, but about 1762 abandoned a legal career to join his brother Samuel in a partnership to import British goods.

==Career==
In 1775, Broome joined the military for the American Revolution when he was appointed lieutenant colonel of the Second New York City Regiment of Militia, which was commanded by John Jay.

He was a member of the New York Provincial Congress from 1775 to 1777, and a delegate to the New York State Constitutional Convention in 1777.

===Post-Revolutionary War===
He was an Alderman in 1783-84 and 1785–86, and New York City Treasurer in 1784. He was the president of the New York City Chamber of Commerce from 1785 to 1794 and was engaged in trade with India and China at that time. He is said to have launched the importation of tea from China with an initial shipment of 2 million pounds.

In August 1795, during an outbreak of yellow fever, he was the chairman of the city&#x27;s Health Committee, appointed by Governor George Clinton the previous year, and kept on by Clinton&#x27;s rival John Jay despite Broome&#x27;s prominence at a partisan rally to oppose the treaty Jay had just negotiated with the British since health was not considered a partisan issue. The health committee denied there was an epidemic and played down the number of deaths, attributing them to other causes.

Broome twice ran unsuccessfully for U.S. Congress; first in March 1789 against Federalist candidate John Laurance, and then again in April 1802 against Federalist candidate Joshua Sands. Broome was a member of New York County of the New York State Assembly in 1800-01 and 1802, and a member of the New York State Senate in 1804.

===Lieutenant Governor of New York===
Broome was elected Lieutenant Governor of New York three times, serving from July 1804 until he died in office in August 1810. He initially defeated Oliver Phelps in 1804 and then won re-election over Thomas Storm in 1807 and Nicholas Fish in 1810. He served under two Governors of New York—first under Morgan Lewis (1804–1807), and then under Daniel D. Tompkins (1807–1810). Broome&#x27;s death occurred a month into his third term, so that at first the President pro tempore of the State Senate John Tayler became acting lieutenant governor, and in April 1811 DeWitt Clinton won a special election to serve for the remainder of the term.

==Personal life==
On October 19, 1769, he married Rebecca Lloyd (1747–1800) and they had several children, including:

* John Lloyd Broome (d. 1836), who was the father of U.S. Navy officer John L. Broome (1824–1898).
* Julia Adel Broome (1776–1844), who married John Walter Livingston (1778–1860), great-grandson of Philip Livingston.
* Caroline Matilda Broome (1783–1861), who married Darby Noon (1783–1823)

On July 9, 1806, Broome married Ruth Hunter (c.1757–1840), the widow of auctioneer Robert Hunter (c.1735–1800) and mother of State Senator John Hunter (1778–1852).

Like a very large number of New York City residents, Broome held people as slaves.

Broome&#x27;s remains were initially buried in the churchyard of the First Presbyterian Church in New York on Wall Street in New York City. However, they were moved in the 1840s when the church relocated to Fifth Avenue between 11th and 12th Streets in Greenwich Village in Manhattan.

===Descendants===
Through his son John, he was the grandfather of Marine Corps officer John Lloyd Broome (1824–1898).

Through his daughter Julia, he was the grandfather of Adele Caroline Livingston (1810/3–1841), who married New York merchant Joseph Sampson (1793–1872), themselves the parents of Adele Livingston Sampson (wife of Frederic W. Stevens and Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord) and grandparents of Adele Livingston &quot;Daisy&quot; Stevens (1864–1939), who was married to Frederick Hobbes Allen (1858–1937), a prominent international lawyer who was the son of Elisha Hunt Allen (1804–1883), former U.S. Representative from Maine and the United States Minister to the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1856 until he died in 1883, and the grandson of Samuel Clesson Allen (1772–1842), a Senator from Massachusetts.

===Legacy===
Broome County, New York, and the Town of Broome in Schoharie County, New York are named after him, as well as Broome Street in Manhattan in New York City.

<text>A card sharp (also card shark, sometimes hyphenated or spelled as a single word) is a person who uses skill and/or deception to win at card games (such as poker). &quot;Sharp&quot; and &quot;shark&quot; spellings have varied over time and by region.

The label is not always intended as pejorative, and is sometimes used to refer to practitioners of card tricks for entertainment purposes. In general usage, principally in American English and more commonly with the &quot;shark&quot; spelling, the term has also taken on the meaning of an expert card gambler who takes advantage of less-skilled players, also called an &quot;advantage player&quot;, without any implication of actual cheating at cards, in much the same way that &quot;&quot; or &quot;pool hustler&quot; can (especially when used by non-players) be intended to refer to a skilled player rather than a cheater or swindler. The synonym to &quot;card sharp&quot;, &quot;&quot;, when used with reference to card-playing and swindlers, has pejorative connotations.

A card sharp or shark (by either of the gambling-related definitions) may be a &quot;rounder&quot; who travels, seeking out high-stakes games in which to gamble.

==Etymology and usage==

According to the prevailing etymological theory, the term &quot;shark&quot;, originally meaning &quot;parasite&quot; or &quot;one who preys upon others&quot; derives from German &#x27; or &#x27; (&#x27;rogue&#x27; or &#x27;rascal&#x27;), as did the English word &quot;shirk[er]&quot;. &quot;Sharp&quot; developed in the 17th century from this meaning of &quot;shark&quot; (as apparently did the use of &quot;shark&quot; as a name for the fish), but the phrase &quot;card sharp&quot; predates the variant &quot;card shark&quot;. The original connotation was negative, meaning &quot;swindler&quot; or &quot;cheat&quot;, regardless of spelling, with the more positive connotations of &quot;expert&quot; or &quot;skilled player&quot; arising later, and not supplanting the negative ones. &quot;Card sharp&quot; and &quot;card shark&quot; are synonymous, although American English is somewhat, but informally, beginning to favor &quot;shark&quot; as a positive term versus &quot;sharp&quot; as a negative one. (However, not &quot;all&quot; American dictionaries agree with this, and some suggest the opposite.)

Phrasefinder puts &quot;card sharp&quot; (or &quot;-sharper&quot;) as the slightly earlier usage, with an 1859 citation for &quot;card-sharper&quot; and &quot;card-sharp&quot; in both Britain and in the US, while &quot;card-shark&quot; is cited to 1893 in the US.

==Methods==

Card sharps who cheat or perform tricks use methods to keep control of the order of the cards or sometimes to control one specific card. Many of these methods employ sleight of hand. Essential skills are &quot;false shuffles&quot; and &quot;false cuts&quot; that appear to mix the deck but actually leave the cards in the same order. More advanced techniques include &quot;culling&quot; (manipulating desired cards to the top or bottom of the deck), and &quot;stacking&quot; (putting desired cards in position to be dealt).

Dealing the cards can also be manipulated. Once a desired card or cards are located they can be controlled and dealt as the cheater wishes. This is called a false dealing; if a card is dealt from the bottom it is called &quot;bottom dealing&quot; and if it is second from the top it is called &quot;second dealing&quot;. Two cards could be dealt as one or the second card from the bottom could be dealt, hence the Greek deal and double deals. Dealing may also be done from the middle of the deck, known as the &quot;middle deal&quot; or &quot;center deal&quot;, but is almost always performed as a display of skill rather than actual cheating.

<text>The Bororo are indigenous people of Brazil, living in the state of Mato Grosso. They also extended into Bolivia and the Brazilian state of Goiás. The Western Bororo live around the Jauru and Cabaçal rivers. The Eastern Bororo (Orarimogodoge) live in the region of the São Lourenço, Garças, and Vermelho Rivers. The Bororo live in eight villages. The Bororo (or even Coroados, Boe, Orarimogodo) are an ethnic group in Brazil that has an estimated population of just under two thousand. They speak the Borôro language (code ISO 639 : BOR) and are mainly of animistic belief. They live in eight villages in the central areas of Mato Grosso. A famous exponent of this group is Cândido Rondon, a Brazilian army official and founder of Fundação Nacional do Índio (or FUNAI). Bororo&#x27;s culture was closely studied by French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss during his expedition to Amazonia and Mato Grosso (1935–1936), described in his famous book &quot;Tristes Tropiques&quot; (1955).

== Names ==
The Bororo, whose name means &quot;village court&quot; in their language, are also known as the Araés, Araripoconé, Boe, Coroados, Coxiponé, Cuiabá, and Porrudos people.

== History ==
The first contact with the European colonizers took place in the seventeenth century with the arrival of the Jesuit missionaries. In the 18th century, mining sites for the extraction of gold began in Mato Grosso. Due to the pressure of the garimpeiros, the gold seekers, Bororo divided into two groups, those of the East (Coroados) and those of the West (Campanhas), which once separated never returned to be united. The Bororo of the West disappeared in the second half of the 20th century in Bolivia. The Eastern Bororo, however, remained isolated from the world until the middle of the nineteenth century when a road was built connecting the Mato Grosso region to São Paulo and Minas Gerais. This road passed through the São Lourenço valley, where Bororo lived. This was the reason why the most violent conflict was triggered in the history of the conquest of Mato Grosso. After fifty years of war, Bororo surrendered to the state and after that apparent truce came the diamond seekers who also exploited and severely damaged the territory. After these conflicts, the Bororo people saw some peace with the mission of pacifying the Salesian missionaries. Their &quot;Christianization&quot; was, in any case, another event that contributed to almost completely extinguishing their linguistic and cultural heritage. Obviously today the situation of Bororo seems less critical than in the past.

== Culture ==

While searching for missing explorer Percy Fawcett in 1930, a wayward party including Aloha Wanderwell filmed the daily activities of the Bororo. A 32-minute silent film from the trip survives as part of the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Human Studies Film Archives and documents a ceremonial dance, a first contact scenario with Boboré villagers, and Bororo men experiencing sympathetic labor pains. Anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss lived for some time among the Bororo during his first stay in Brazil (1935–1939). Their mythology features extensively in his book &quot;The Raw and the Cooked&quot;.

Marshal Cândido Rondon (1865–1956), who was to become the first director of Brazil&#x27;s Indians Protection Bureau (SPI/FUNAI) and creator of the Xingu National Park, was the son of a Bororo woman. His first major success after joining the Army was the installation of a telegraph line to Mato Grosso. He not only was able to pacify the Bororo, who had blocked previous attempts to set up that line, but even recruited their help to complete it.

The Bororo associate body odor with a person&#x27;s life force, and breath odor with the person&#x27;s soul.

=== Language ===
The Bororo people speak Bororo Proper, which belongs to the Bororo language family in the Macro-Ge language family. Literacy rates are under 30%. The language is written in the Latin script.

The Bororo people call their original language &quot;Boe Wadáru&quot;. The majority of the population today speaks Portuguese and the Bororo language.

This language is spoken by about a thousand individuals who constitute a small ethnic group of the Amazon named Bororo people; Its diffusion area is mainly found in the Brazilian region of Mato Grosso. In 1976, there was recorded a very low native number (four people) in the Bolivian district of Santa Cruz, in the province of Angel Sandoval, near the border with Brazil. However, today it is supposed that the Bororo language is extinct in Bolivia since it is thought to have been incorporated by other predominant linguistic realities. Today the Bororo language is spoken in Brazil in the state of Mato Grosso, mainly in the villages of Meruri, Sangradouro and Perigera. Even in Brazil, this language risked being extinct forever. Towards the end of the 1960s the use of the Bororo language was forbidden in the towns of Merai and Sangradouro where the Salesian mission was operating, but with the passing of time it was restored, and the bilingual education was put into practice. All this led to a moderate revitalization of the language, but since then it is still spoken by just 1024 individuals, making it a so-called &quot;extinct language&quot; or threatened.

=== Social structure ===
The Bororo are a small people in the Amazon rainforest living in the southwest of the Brazilian region of Mato Grosso. The literal translation of the word &quot;boror&quot; is &quot;village courtyard&quot;. It&#x27;s no coincidence that Bororo&#x27;s homes are traditionally arranged in a circle that will be a kind of spatiotis or patio for them, which will act as the main space of Bororo&#x27;s life. This square, if so called, is so important that it has given the same name to this group of people as it is within that typical courtyard that the Bororo people concentrate most of the social phenomena and spirit-Religious. In the complex social organization of Bororo, the classification of individuals is governed by several number of factors including clan membership, blood descent, and group of residence (referring to where a family lives in the village). This last detail is important because in the spatial distribution of homes each clan occupies a precise role. The aldeia (village) is divided into two exogamic half-Exerae and Tugarége-each divided into four clans, consisting of several families. A curious aspect for a people that may sometimes seem primitive is that woman has a very particular role in the concept of Bororo society, and indeed the rule of the offspring predicts that this is matriarchal, and that the infant then receives a name that Join the mother clan. The importance of these rules is also noted in marriage. After a Bororo wedding, the man will have to live in the house of his bride and will also have obligations to his family, such as fishing, hunting, working and, if necessary, making ornamental items for his bride&#x27;s brother. Although it seems that man is totally devoted and devoted entirely to his wife after marriage, it is this complexity of conjugal relationships that is the cause of frequent separations, making it possible for a man to live in multiple homes throughout his life. Despite everything that has so far been explained, it may lead to thinking that the husband&#x27;s obligations to his wife are at the top of the pyramid because of their importance, another truth of the Bororo culture is that a man always maintains a bond with his much more important family Of what binds her to her bride. It is true that an adult male, although married, maintains a number of obligations to the women of his family, namely his sisters. For example, it is their custom that a man is more concerned with his grandchildren, &quot;iwagedu&quot; in Bororo, than his own children; The only obligation of a father to his children is to banish them, a physical and non-cultural obligation. The complex organization of their lives also reflects on how one lives in the home. In fact, although two families of different nuclei (having blood ties even outside that exact space) live under the same roof, they can divide the interior spaces of the house; It is not by chance that the ends of the house are more private areas where you can put this division into practice, and the center of the house is a shared space devoted to visits, small daily rituals, and eating meals. The Bororo home is usually left with doors and windows open to allow it to be able to control what is inside (in the center), except when rituals are held inside which women cannot attend or during mourning. One last interesting thing to consider is that, in mourning, the house becomes a space between the domestic domain and the public-legal domain (as Sylvia Caiuby Novaes observes) since the end of funerals must be destroyed after it has been completely empty throughout the mourning period.

=== Lifestyle ===

Traditionally hunters and gatherers, under the influence of the missionaries and then of the Brazilian authorities more recently, were put into agriculture, which now ensures their subsistence. Men hunt and women, especially in the Rio Vermelho region, plant and harvest recently introduced cassava, maize and rice. Since agriculture is practiced only by women, they are becoming increasingly important, particularly as a result of the scarcity of game. The Bororos practice many rituals including:
* Corn Festival, a celebration of cereal gathering, important food in Indian food;
* The piercing of the ears and the lips;
* The funeral ritual is a sacred celebration for all those who consider themselves Indians.
The rites of passage (in which individuals pass from one social category to another) the most important are:
* The naming ceremony;
* The initiation;
* The funerary rites, which can last up to 2 months and which have attracted the attention of ethnologists by their complexity.

== Biology ==
The Bororo all share the same blood type: Type O blood, like most Native Americans.

== Totemism ==
Lucien Lévy-Bruhl quotes Karl von den Steinen (1894) and comments: &quot;The Trumai (a tribe of northern Brazil) say that they are aquatic animals. The Bororo (neighboring tribe) boast of being araras red). &#x27;This does not only mean that after their death they become araras, nor that the araras are metamorphosed Bororó, and must be treated as such. Den Steinen, who did not want to believe it, but who had to surrender to their formal assertion, the Bororó coldly say that they are now araras, exactly as if a caterpillar said it was a butterfly. (K. von den Steinen, &quot;Unter der Natürvölker Zentralbräsiliens&quot;, p. 305-306). It is not a name they give; it is not a relationship they proclaim. What they want to convey is an essential identity ... For a mentality governed by the law of participation, there is no difficulty there. All societies of the totemic form include collective representations of the same kind, implying a similar identity between the individuals of a totemic group and their totem. &quot;(Lucien Levy-Bruhl, &quot;Mental functions in lower societies&quot; , Paris, Alcan, 1910, Pp. 61-62.) 4 For Claude Lévi-Strauss (&quot;Totemism today&quot;, 1962)

<doc id="668789" wikidata="Q725964" url="?curid=668789" title="Dan Hartman">
<text>Daniel Earl Hartman (December 8, 1950 – March 22, 1994) was an American pop rock musician, multi-instrumentalist, producer, singer, and songwriter and original frontman for several bands, including The Soploids, Mak and the Turnarounds, Our Wringer, Last Wing, and Orion. Among songs he wrote and recorded were &quot;Free Ride&quot; as a member of the Edgar Winter Group, and the solo hits &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;, &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot;, &quot;We Are the Young&quot; and &quot;Second Nature&quot;. &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot;, his most successful US hit, reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1984 in 1985. The James Brown song &quot;Living in America&quot;, which Hartman co-wrote and produced, reached No. 4 on March 1, 1986.

Hartman wrote the 1980 disco song &quot;Love Sensation&quot; recorded by Loleatta Holloway, which has been sampled on numerous records, including the 1989 Black Box track &quot;Ride on Time&quot;.

== Early life ==

Hartman was born on December 8, 1950, to Carl Hartman (1921–2006) and Pauline Angeloff (1925–1999) near Pennsylvania&#x27;s capital, Harrisburg, in West Hanover Township, Dauphin County. His father served as an aerial gunner during World War II before eventually working for the U.S. Postal Service. His maternal side of the family originated from Yugoslavia and were likely of Russian or Bulgarian descent. Hartman was a child prodigy and studied classical piano. He attended John Harris High School, where he sang for the John Harris Choir and partook in journalism and theater as extracurricular activities.

== Career ==

=== The Legends and the Edgar Winter Band ===

Hartman joined his first band the Legends at the age of 13 in 1964 at the request of his older brother David (Dave) who asked him to play keyboards. Hartman was initially reluctant to join, as he gravitated towards Motown rather than the Beatles-esque sound that the band members favored. The original lineup consisted of Hartman (keyboards), Dave (guitar and vocals), Denny Woolridge (bass) and Ralph Swartz (drums). A later member was Dave Cope on bass. From its inception, the Legends played at various spots throughout Central Pennsylvania, including local churches, dances, rock shows and outdoor concerts. The Legends initially started out as a soul group, but transitioned from a psychedelic rock to hard rock band by the early 1970s.

By the early 1970s, Dave had left the Legends and Hartman became the band leader with Larry Sadler on drums and Joe Caloiero on bass. Hartman&#x27;s role further expanded in that he wrote much of the band&#x27;s music (as well as played electric piano, organ, and guitar), but despite the release of a number of recordings, none turned out to be widespread hits. Their first record release was a recording of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Baby Get Your Head Screwed on Right&quot; on the Up label. They next released a two-sider with the Bridge Society label consisting of the songs &quot;Keep On Running&quot; (a song popularized by the Spencer Davis Group) and &quot;Cheating&quot; (originally recorded by the Animals). Their third release was the Hartman-penned songs &quot;High Towers&quot;/&quot;Fever Games&quot; on Railroad House Records. The band also recorded &quot;Sometimes I Can&#x27;t Help It&quot; and &quot;Jefferson Strongbox&quot;. While part of the Legends, Hartman worked as a banker for a time and wore a fake mustache in the promos so that his employers would not recognize him.

Hartman began sending demo tapes of the Legends&#x27; original material to gain national attention. He enlisted the help of Ronnie G. Shaeffer, a major radio personality in Central Pennsylvania who not only listened to the works and provided honest criticism to Hartman but also offered record label connections. In 1971, upon listening to the 13-song demo tape, Steve Paul, President of Blue Sky Records, introduced Hartman to Edgar Winter—who had recently disbanded White Trash and was seeking new members for his next musical venture. Hartman subsequently spent a period of time backing the Johnny Winter Band (Edgar Winter was Johnny Winter&#x27;s younger brother) and left the Legends to join Edgar Winter&#x27;s lineup. The Legends continued to record with Larry Swartzwelder on guitar and later Dean Lescallette and Gene Brenner on rhythm guitar. They released &quot;Rock n Roll Woman&quot; (written by Hartman) and &quot;Problems&quot; (written by Caloiero) on Hartman&#x27;s Heart label. The Legends disbanded by the mid-1970s.

By 1972, Hartman joined the Edgar Winter Group, where he played bass, wrote or co-wrote many of their songs, and sang on three of their albums: &quot;They Only Come Out at Night&quot;, &quot;Shock Treatment&quot;, and &quot;The Edgar Winter Group with Rick Derringer&quot;. He wrote and sang the band&#x27;s second biggest pop hit, &quot;Free Ride&quot;, in 1972. The ballad &quot;Autumn&quot; on Edgar&#x27;s LP &quot;They Only Come Out at Night&quot; was a regional radio hit in New England. Hartman also wrote the band&#x27;s charting singles &quot;Easy Street&quot; and &quot;River&#x27;s Risin&quot; from the &quot;Shock Treatment&quot; album. He became known for wearing the Bass Suit, which he designed with Los Angeles couturier Bill Witten out of a rubbery fabric that allowed Hartman to insert a bass guitar in a pelvic pocket.

=== Solo career ===

==== Albums and unreleased work ====

Upon launching a solo career in 1976, he released a promotional album titled &quot;Who Is Dan Hartman and Why Is Everyone Saying Wonderful Things About Him?&quot; It was a compilation disc including songs from Johnny Winter and the Edgar Winter Group. His second release, &quot;Images&quot;, was his first true album and featured ex-Edgar Winter Group members Edgar Winter, Ronnie Montrose and Rick Derringer and guests Clarence Clemons and Randy Brecker.

In late 1978, partly due to being introduced by the Studio 54 sound system, Hartman reached No. 1 on the Dance Charts with the disco single &quot;Instant Replay&quot; (the title track of his third full-length album &quot;Instant Replay&quot;) which crossed over to No. 29 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1979 and also reached the Top 10 on the UK charts. Musicians Hartman worked with on the associated album included Vinnie Vincent and G. E. Smith. This was followed by his second chart topper, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Relight My Fire&quot; (the title track of his fourth full-length album &quot;Relight My Fire&quot;), which featured friend Loleatta Holloway on vocals. An instrumental version of the song later became the theme for the NBC talk show &quot;Tomorrow&quot;.

Hartman was back on the charts again with the single &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot;, which was featured on his album of the same name, as well as the &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; soundtrack in 1984. The tune reached No. 6 on the U.S. charts, and (on re-release in 1985) No. 12 in the UK. Hartman was featured as a bartender in one of the two videos that were released for the single, which received heavy rotation on MTV. (Note that the single and album version of &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot; is sung by Hartman; within the film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot;, the song is performed by a fictional vocal group called the Sorels, whose lead singer is played by Stoney Jackson; the actual vocal in the film was performed by Winston Ford). In 1985, Hartman scored a third Number 1 single on the Dance Music charts, &quot;We Are the Young&quot;. The single &quot;Second Nature&quot; also charted during this period. He toured with Toto in 1985.

In 1985 and 1986, Hartman worked on what was planned as his subsequent studio album, &quot;White Boy&quot;; he wanted the album to have a darker and more mature sound than his previous work. The album was completed in 1986, but the record label, MCA, thought it was too dissimilar to Hartman&#x27;s previous work, especially &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot;, and refused to release it. &quot;White Boy&quot; has never been released, though some test pressings of the album were made that are now held by collectors, and some of the songs from the album are available on the internet. One song from the album, &quot;Waiting to See You&quot;, was used in the 1986 film &quot;Ruthless People&quot; and its accompanying soundtrack album and was subsequently released as a single. &quot;First Impression&quot;, another song that was to appear on the unreleased album, was sung by Nancy Martinez on her 1989 album &quot;Unpredictable&quot;.

In 1989, he released his last studio album &quot;New Green Clear Blue&quot;, an instrumental new age-styled album.

==== Producing, songwriting, and other collaborations ====

Hartman worked as a songwriter, producer, and collaborated with such artists as Peter Brown (&quot;Stargazer&quot;, 1979)&quot;,&quot; the Plasmatics (Hartman produced 1981&#x27;s &quot;Metal Priestess&quot;; he also produced a demo version of &quot;Coup d&#x27;Etat&quot; in 1982, which was released as &quot;Coup de Grace&quot; in 2000), Nona Hendryx (she even co-wrote the song &quot;Electricity&quot; with Hartman, which was featured on his 1984 &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot; album), James Brown (&quot;Gravity&quot;; 1986), Steve Winwood (Hartman provided backing vocals on &quot;The Finer Things&quot;, which was featured on Winwood&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Back in the High Life&quot;), Jenny Burton (&quot;Souvenirs&quot;; 1986), Jackie Chan (Hartman&#x27;s song &quot;Only For Your Love&quot; was featured on the album &quot;Shangri-La&quot;; 1986), Time Bandits (&quot;Can&#x27;t Wait for Another World&quot;, 1987; co-produced with Midnight), John Waite (the song &quot;Sometimes&quot;, cowritten by Hartman and Midnight, was featured on the 1987 album &quot;Rover&#x27;s Return&quot;), Paul King (&quot;Joy&quot;; 1987), D-Project (&quot;Prototype&quot;; 1988), Tina Turner (&quot;Foreign Affair&quot;; 1989), Joe Cocker (&quot;Unchain My Heart&quot; and &quot;One Night of Sin&quot;; 1987 and 1989 respectively), Holly Johnson (&quot;Blast&quot;; 1989), Living in a Box (&quot;Gatecrashing&quot;; 1989), Dusty Springfield (&quot;Reputation&quot;; 1990), Tom Robinson (&quot;We Never Had It So Good&quot; – later re-released as &quot;Blood Brother&quot;; 1990), Bonnie Tyler (&quot;Bitterblue&quot;; 1991), &quot;The Fabulous Pop Tarts&quot; - a musical duo composed of Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato (1992; Hartman produced the song &quot;Smile&quot;), and Valerie&#x27;s Garten (&quot;Valerie&#x27;s Garten&quot;; 1992).

In an interview snipped from Portzline (2014), Hartman stated that he started producing at an early age:I started producing before I even joined the Legends—around 1962... I produced some local R&amp;B, rock and gospel acts at Baldwin Sound in Mechanicsburg [Pennsylvania]. People would hear what I&#x27;d done on someone else&#x27;s record and call me up and ask if I&#x27;d produce them, too. I even wrote and recorded an advertising jingle for Sutliff Chevrolet out on Paxton Street when I was 16. So it&#x27;s always been something that I could fall back on throughout my career—to keep my mind going, to keep me musically inspired, and to keep me moving without having to make statements of my own.Hartman served as a producer for the Legends. Around 1976, Hartman began using one of the rooms of a colonial home in Westport, Connecticut (dubbed &quot;The Schoolhouse&quot;) to serve as a recording studio. The rest of the house&#x27;s rooms were wired for recording and to allow for different sounds by the artists. He did not charge exorbitant rates, so that new acts at the time such as the Outsets could record demos. Hartman produced albums for artists such as .38 Special, Foghat, David Johansen and Rick Derringer. During late 1977, blues legend Muddy Waters used &quot;The Schoolhouse&quot; to record his album &quot;I&#x27;m Ready&quot;. Hartman ran the recording board for the sessions and Johnny Winter served as the producer. In 1971, Hartman produced the Hydraulic Peach for Arpeggio Records. Hartman wrote and produced the 1980 disco hit &quot;Love Sensation&quot; performed by Holloway.

In 1981, Hartman was among the lineup for Hilly Michaels&#x27; albums &quot;Calling All Girls&quot; and &quot;Lumia&quot;. Hartman wrote the song &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late&quot;, which was sung by Diana Ross and featured on her 1981 album &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot;. In 1982, Hartman produced Average White Band&#x27;s album &quot;Cupid&#x27;s in Fashion&quot;. The album was recorded at Sigma Sound Studios in New York with additional recordings done at &quot;The Schoolhouse&quot;. In a 2016 interview, Hartman&#x27;s close friend Blanche Napoleon—who provided backing vocals for &quot;Instant Replay&quot; and his other early albums—revealed that he created music for Gillette commercials around 1982 (she even provided background harmonies for one of the commercials). She worked with him on some of his other commercial work. In 1983, Hartman played bass on the song &quot;Speechless&quot; featured on Ian Hunter&#x27;s album &quot;All of the Good Ones Are Taken&quot;. Hartman co-wrote the song &quot;Heart Skip Too Many Beats&quot; with Janis Ian and it was featured on her 1984 album &quot;Uncle Wonderful&quot; (Hartman performed with Ian on the track). Around 1984, Hartman also worked as a lyricist and producer for Rugsted &amp; Kreutzfeldt&#x27;s album &quot;Sold Out&quot; (also referred to as &quot;R&#x27;n&#x27;K Band&quot;).

Aside from focusing on his solo career in 1984, Hartman provided background vocals for John Jarrett&#x27;s Tribe&#x27;s self-titled album. More so, in 1984, Hartman arranged and engineered Neil Sedaka&#x27;s album &quot;Come See About Me&quot;. Hartman last worked as an engineer for Sedaka on the musician&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;Neil Sedaka: Now&quot;. Hartman produced the song &quot;I Won&#x27;t Steal Away&quot; (which he co-wrote with Midnight and Alides Hidding) for the band Time Bandits, which appeared on their 1985 album &quot;Fiction&quot;. Hartman also produced Time Bandits&#x27; B-side track &quot;Cool World&quot;, which was unreleased on any album. In 1986, Hartman was reported to be producing Lou Gramm&#x27;s first solo album (Gramm was then the lead singer of Foreigner), though the opportunity did not materialize. In 1990, Hartman and Midnight wrote and produced the theme song for the television show &quot;Guys Next Door&quot;.

==== Soundtracks ====

In 1984, Hartman also performed &quot;Heart of the Beat&quot; under the band name 3V with Charlie Midnight for the soundtrack of &quot;Breakin&#x27; (&quot;directed by Joel Silberg). According to Midnight, the fictional 3V was created because nobody else wanted to do the song. The song resulted in Midnight receiving a publishing deal, and he and Hartman even performed the song during a spring break festival in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. In 1985, Hartman&#x27;s song &quot;Talking To The Wall&quot; was featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Perfect&quot; starring Jamie Lee Curtis and John Travolta. Hartman&#x27;s song &quot;Get Outta Town&quot; (co-written with Midnight and co-produced with Richard Landis) was featured on the &quot;Fletch&quot; soundtrack.&quot; He closed the year cowriting &quot;(Krush Groove) Can&#x27;t Stop the Street&quot; with Charlie Midnight for the film &quot;Krush Groove&quot; and the song was performed by Chaka Khan.

He also co-produced a version of the song &quot;Great Gosh O Mighty&quot; for the film &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;. For his 1986 album &quot;Lifetime Friend&quot;, Little Richard (who performed the song in the aforementioned film) used a different version.

Hartman produced and co-wrote &quot;Living in America&quot;, a No. 4 hit for James Brown which appeared on the soundtrack of the feature film &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985). The song was the last of Brown&#x27;s 44 hit recordings to appear on the Billboard top 40 charts. The track also appeared on the Hartman produced album &quot;Gravity&quot;. In 1987, Hartman and Charlie Midnight were nominated for a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song. Brown won a Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance.

In 1988, Hartman co-wrote the song &quot;Why Should I Worry?&quot; with Charlie Midnight for the Walt Disney Animation Studios film &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;. The work &quot;Behind Your Eyes&quot; (which Hartman cowrote with Midnight) appeared on the soundtrack for 1988&#x27;s &quot;Casual Sex?&quot; Also, in 1988, Hartman dueted with Denise Lopez on &quot;Scrooged&quot; soundtrack song &quot;The Love You Take&quot;. In 1990, he co-wrote with longtime collaborator Charlie Midnight &quot;9.95&quot; (performed by Spunkadelic) for &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie&quot;. In 1991, Hartman recorded &quot;(That&#x27;s Your) Consciousness&quot; for the soundtrack to &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze&quot;.

== Covers and sampling of his work ==

In 1976, Sérgio Mendes &amp; Brasil &#x27;77 did an arrangement of the song &quot;Tell Me in a Whisper&quot; (which had been co-written by Hartman and Winter) on the &quot;Homecooking&quot; album. In 1984, &quot;Relight My Fire&quot; was covered by Costa Anadiotis&#x27; band Café Society. Eric Martin covered Hartman&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Only Foolin&#x27; Myself&quot; (a song he featured on the unreleased &quot;White Boy&quot; album) on his self-titled 1986 album &quot;Eric Martin&quot;. &quot;Love Sensation&quot; was sampled in 1989 Black Box track &quot;Ride on Time&quot; and 1991&#x27;s &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch; Holloway even appeared in the music video during the chorus portion). In January 1990, a cover version of &quot;Instant Replay&quot; recorded by the British duo Yell! became a top 10 hit. In 1991, Paul Young featured a cover version of &quot;I&#x27;m Only Foolin&#x27; Myself&quot; on his compilation album &quot;From Time to Time – The Singles Collection&quot;. Additionally, in 1991, Marc Anthony covered the song &quot;Name of the Game&quot; (featured on Hartman&#x27;s &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot; album) on his collaboration album with Little Louie Vega entitled &quot;When the Night Is Over&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==

Hartman was never married and had no children. He died on March 22, 1994, at his Westport, Connecticut, home from a brain tumor, at the age of 43. A closeted gay man, he was diagnosed with HIV in the late 1980s. He kept his HIV status a secret and did not seek treatment, even after friend and intermittent collaborator Holly Johnson (formerly of the band Frankie Goes to Hollywood) announced his own HIV status in 1991.

In May 1994, the &quot;Dan Hartman: A Celebration of His Life and Music&quot; memorial concert was performed at New York&#x27;s Sound Factory Bar. Nona Hendryx, Loleatta Holloway, and producer Frankie Knuckles were among the participants.

== Legacy ==

Hartman has been renowned for his musical versatility. In his last will and testament, Hartman created the Dan Hartman Arts and Music Foundation (located in Los Angeles, California) with Charlie Midnight as his sole trustee. At the time of his death, Hartman was recording a solo album for CHAOS/Columbia. The record label had no immediate plans to release Hartman&#x27;s unfinished work. In 1996, it was announced that EMI Music Publishing purchased Hartman&#x27;s complete catalog. During the same year, Tom Robinson released the song &quot;Connecticut&quot; in memory of Hartman. The song appears on Robinson&#x27;s album &quot;Having It Both Ways&quot;. Years after Robinson&#x27;s tribute, Kathy Hartman—as frontwoman of the band Signal 30—released &quot;A Song for Dan&quot; in memory of her brother. She has also released the song &quot;Bad Movies&quot;, which she had co-written with her late brother.

At the time of his death, Hartman&#x27;s music was enjoying a revival of sorts: a cover version of &quot;Relight My Fire&quot; became a British number-one hit for Take That and Lulu in 1993. Sales of Hartman&#x27;s solo recordings, group efforts, production, songwriting and compilation inclusions had exceeded 50 million records worldwide. In October 1994, Joni Mitchell covered &quot;How Do You Stop&quot; on her &quot;Turbulent Indigo&quot; album, which later won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Around December 1994, the album &quot;Keep the Fire Burnin&#x27;&quot; was posthumously released – a compilation featuring remixes of earlier hits and previously unreleased material. The album spawned two singles; &quot;The Love in Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Keep the Fire Burnin&#x27;&quot;, the latter featuring Holloway. Hartman&#x27;s version of &quot;Free Ride&quot; was featured in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie&quot; the year after his death. T.M. Stevens released his album &quot;Out of Control&quot; in 1995, which featured the song &quot;The Gift&quot; (written by Hartman and Midnight). In 1996, Audio Adrenaline included a cover version of &quot;Free Ride&quot; on their album &quot;Bloom&quot;. In 2003, Ricky Martin covered &quot;Relight My Fire&quot; with two versions: one featuring Holloway&#x27;s original vocals and another with Anastacia singing Holloway&#x27;s portion.

In 2006, twelve years after Hartman&#x27;s death, &quot;I Can Dream About You&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;; &quot;Relight My Fire&quot; was also featured in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: The Ballad of Gay Tony&quot;. In 2010, folk rockers Louis Barabbas &amp; the Bedlam Six turned &quot;Relight My Fire&quot; into an ode to whiskey.

In 2020, Hartman was inducted into the Central Pennsylvania Music Hall of Fame with Kathy Hartman accepting the honor on his behalf. Other inductees included Poison, Bobby Troup, and The Sharks.

In honor of Pride Month 2021, Hiro Clark—in collaboration with Scissor Sisters member Ana Matronic—launched the &quot;Cowley Hartman Russell&quot; T-shirt to honor Hartman and other legendary disco producers Patrick Cowley and Arthur Russell.
&quot;I Can Dream About You&quot; was also featured in the episode &quot;Ruminations: Big And Little Bullys&quot; of the HBO television series &quot;Euphoria&quot; in 2022.

<text>Takanini is a southern suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. It is located on the shores of the Pahurehure Inlet, 28 kilometres southeast of the Auckland CBD.

The suburb is home to a Fonterra milk plant, the Addison housing development, as well as international horse breeding facilities throughout the area. The two major shopping centres in Takanini are Takanini Town Centre and Southgate Shopping Centre.

==History==

The suburb is named after Ihaka Takaanini, a 19th-century Māori chief of the area.

An old highway, the Great South Road, runs through Takanini, forming its main street. The road was constructed during the New Zealand Wars to transport supplies to the Waikato campaign. It was guarded by armed constabulary and was a designated military road.

The first successful aeroplane flights in New Zealand were made in Takanini in February 1911, when Vivian Walsh and his brother Leo flew a Howard Wright 1910 Biplane named the &quot;Manurewa&quot; at Glenora Park (an area near the modern-day Southgate Shopping Centre).

During the major reformation of local government in 1989, Takanini was included into the Papakura District boundaries.

From October 2010, after a review of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, the entire Auckland Region was amalgamated into a single city authority. As well as Papakura District, other territorial authorities such as North Shore City, Rodney District, Waitakere City, Auckland City, Manukau City and the Franklin District were abolished and the entire area amalgamated into a single Auckland city council. The suburb of Takanini is now in the Manurewa-Papakura Ward of the Auckland Council.

===Housing===
Similar to Dannemora, and Howick, Takanini has several suburban styled housing complexes throughout the area. Addison, Longford Park, and McLennan are three of the major housing projects which have increased local property values; smaller projects include Waiata Shores, Kauri Flats and Kauri Landing. The Takanini area contains a highly ethnically diverse population. A major Kiwibuild building project is being realised on surplus Defence Force land, east of Great South Road. The McLennan housing development next to Bruce Pulman Park was built on the former army base, made much smaller in the 2010s.

<text>William Broome (&quot;c.&quot; April 1689 – 16 November 1745) was an English poet and translator. He was born in Bromsgrove, near Birmingham, Cheshire and died in Bath.

==Education==
He was educated at Eton and Cambridge, entered the Church, and became rector of Sturston and later Pulham in Norfolk and Eye in Suffolk.

==Translations==
Broome translated the &quot;Iliad&quot; in prose along with others, and was employed by Alexander Pope, whom he excelled as a Greek scholar, in translating the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, of which he Englished the 2nd, 6th, 8th, 11th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 23rd books, catching the style of his master so exactly as almost to defy identification, and thus annoying him so as to earn a niche in The Dunciad. He also translated the Odes of Anacreon.

The verses of his own that he published had very moderate poetical merit. He became friendly with a younger poet whom Pope admired, Joseph Thurston.

<doc id="668806" wikidata="Q784836" url="?curid=668806" title="Long-beaked echidna">
<text>The long-beaked echidnas (genus Zaglossus) make up one of the two extant genera of echidnas: there are three extant species, all living in New Guinea. They are medium-sized, solitary mammals covered with coarse hair and spines made of keratin. They have short, strong limbs with large claws, and are powerful diggers. They forage in leaf litter on the forest floor, eating earthworms and insects.

The extant species are:
*Western long-beaked echidna (&quot;Z. bruijni&quot;), of the highland forests;
*Attenborough&#x27;s long-beaked echidna (&quot;Z. attenboroughi&quot;), discovered by Western science in 1961 (described in 1998) and preferring a still higher habitat;
*Eastern long-beaked echidna (&quot;Z. bartoni&quot;), of which four distinct subspecies have been identified.

The Eastern species is listed as vulnerable, while the Attenborough&#x27;s and western long-beaked echidna species are listed as Critically Endangered by the IUCN.

A number of extinct species were known in the genus, but they are currently treated as members of their own genera, such as &quot;Murrayglossus&quot; and &quot;Megalibgwilia&quot;.

==General information==
The long-beaked echidna is larger-bodied than the short-beaked and has fewer, shorter spines scattered among its coarse hairs. The snout is two-thirds of the head&#x27;s length and curves slightly downward. There are five digits on both hind and forefeet, but on the former, only the three middle toes are equipped with claws. Like the other species of echidna, long-beaked echidnas have spurs on their hind legs. These spurs are vestigial; part of a repressed venom system akin to the one on the platypus. Male spurs are nonfunctional and females usually lose their spurs as they age. 

===Basal traits===
The breeding female develops a temporary abdominal brood patch, in which her egg is incubated and in which the newborn young (or puggle) remains in safety as it feeds and develops. Since they reproduce by laying eggs which are incubated outside of the mother&#x27;s body it is accompanied by the prototherian lactation process, which shows that they are basal mammals. The long-beaked echidna has a short weaning period. During this time milk is their only source of nutrition and protection for the hatchlings; they are altricial and immunologically naive. 

The long-beaked echidna&#x27;s limb posture is sprawled, similar to extant reptiles like lizards and crocodilians. Although the stances between the animal groups are similar, the way the limbs move are very different between the clades. The echidna swings its limbs at a 45 degree angle while a lizard&#x27;s is more horizontal. They walk with two legs on one side of the body moving in unison.
The long-beaked echidna&#x27;s walk presents multiple differences from a lizard&#x27;s. An echidna&#x27;s walking pattern is more upright than a lizard&#x27;s, this represents a pattern closer to a parasagittal kind of therian. Echidnas and therians both have a dynamic equilibration rather than a static one. 

===Behavior===
These echidnas are primarily nocturnal; foraging for its insect food on the forest floor. These animals are not usually found foraging in the daylight. The long-beaked echidna establish and are commonly found in dens or burrows. 

A study published in 2015 shows that &quot;Zaglossus spp.&quot; in captivity exhibited &quot;handedness&quot; when performing certain behaviors related to foraging, locomotion, and male-female interactions. The results of this study suggest that handedness in mammals is a basal trait rather than one derived several times in extant mammals.

Little is known about the life of these rarely seen animals, but it is believed to have habits similar to those of the short-beaked echidna; unlike them, however, the long-beaked echidnas feed primarily on earthworms rather than ants, as they live in much more humid environments than the smaller &quot;Tachyglossus&quot; echidna. The population of echidnas in New Guinea is declining because of forest clearing and overhunting, and the animal is much in need of protection. In November 2023, a &quot;Zaglossus attenboroughi&quot; was first recorded alive on video in Indonesia&#x27;s Cyclops Mountains, the first confirmed sightings of an individual in 62 years.

<text>The batzen is a historical Swiss, south German and Austrian coin. It was first produced in Bern, Switzerland, from 1492 and continued in use there until the mid-19th century.

== Name ==
Bernese chronicler Valerius Anshelm explained the word from a folk etymology perspective saying that it came from &quot;Bëtz&quot; (&quot;bear&quot;), the heraldic animal of the Swiss canton, which was embossed on the reverse of the coin. The word probably goes back to Upper German (particularly Bavarian) &quot;batzen&quot; (&quot;stick together&quot;) or &quot;Batzen&quot; (&quot;lump, thick piece&quot;), since it referred to a &quot;Dickpfennig&quot; (&quot;fat pfennig&quot;).

== History ==
A double &quot;Plappart&quot;, which soon became known as a &quot;Batzen&quot;, was minted in Bern from 1492. The minting of &quot;Batzen&quot; in Salzburg is also attested early on, in 1495.

The &quot;Batzen&quot; was originally minted in silver, but from the 17th century in billon. The value of the &quot;Batzen&quot; varied over time depending on where it was minted. The value of a Bernese &quot;Batzen&quot; initially corresponded to four &quot;Kreuzer&quot;. Since the &quot;Gulden&quot; was worth 60 &quot;Kreuzer&quot;, 1 &quot;Batzen&quot; in Bern, Freiburg and Solothurn also corresponded to one fifteenth of a &quot;Gulden&quot;. Later there were also &quot;Grossi&quot; (&quot;thick ones&quot;, i.e. &quot;Groschen&quot;) worth 5 &quot;Batzen&quot;. Other places of the Old Confederation and some southern German states soon followed Bern&#x27;s example. Zürich minted 16 &quot;Batzen&quot; to the &quot;Gulden&quot; from 1500 onwards. In 1564, a Thaler was worth 16 Constance &quot;Batzen&quot;. Around 1600, 1 &quot;Bocksthaler&quot; (Schaffhausen &quot;Thaler&quot;) was worth 17 &quot;Batzen&quot; or 68 &quot;Kreuzer&quot;, so 1 &quot;Batzen&quot; = &quot;Thaler&quot; = 4 &quot;Kreuzer&quot;. In the early 18th century the &quot;Hohlbatzen&quot; (&quot;hollow &quot;Batzen&quot;&quot;) was worth five &quot;Kreuzer&quot; (1/12 &quot;Reichsgulden&quot;), the regular &quot;Batzen&quot; four &quot;Kreuzer&quot;, the Basel and Zürich &quot;Batzen&quot; were valued at  &quot;Gulden&quot;, the St. Gallen &quot;Batzen&quot; at  &quot;Gulden&quot;. In the second half of the 18th century, 1 &quot;Reichsbatzen&quot; was worth 16 &quot;Pfennigs&quot;, 1 Zürich &quot;Batzen&quot; was 15 &quot;Pfennigs&quot;, 1 Bernese or 1 Chur &quot;Batzen&quot; was 14 &quot;Pfennigs&quot;.

The &quot;Batzen&quot; became a widespread intermediate currency between the numerous large and small silver coins circulating in Europe. Since some of the South German &quot;Batzen&quot; were of very different quality, the Reichstag in 1522 and 1524 spoke out against these coins. In southern Germany they were minted until 1536, but were banned by the Imperial Minting Ordinance of 1559. However it was still, for example in Nuremberg, in 1564 in use as a currency designation. In Switzerland, on the other hand, the &quot;Batzen&quot; went unchallenged.

In the case of some so-called Kipper coins, however, the &quot;Batzen&quot; was used to name these interim coins. In the time of counterfeiting, the Kipper and Wipper period, for example in Thuringia &quot;inter alia&quot; in the mints of Gotha (1621–1623) and Weimar (1619–1622), other Kipper coins worth three and six &quot;Batzen&quot; were minted (the &quot;Dreibätzner&quot; and &quot;Sechsbätzner&quot;). The coins could not be objected to, because they were state coins, not &quot;Thaler&quot; coins or divisions of them, which had to conform to imperial coinage regulations.

Even after the Munich Coinage Treaty of 1837, &quot;Batzen&quot; were minted as &quot;Scheidemünzen&quot; to the value of four &quot;Kreuzers&quot; in some member states, for example in the Free City of Frankfurt. The coins were in use until the introduction of the &quot;Mark&quot; in 1871. As late as 1873, the increase in the price of beer by the Frankfurt breweries from 4 to 4½ &quot;Kreuzer&quot; triggered the Frankfurt beer riot, which began with the demand &quot;I want Batzen beer&quot; (&quot;Mir wolle Batzebier&quot;) and led to serious social unrest.
When a Swiss single currency was introduced for the first time in 1798–1803 by the Helvetic Republic, the &quot;Batzen&quot; was also integrated into the system. One franc was worth ten &quot;Batzen&quot;, one &quot;Batzen&quot; in turn ten centimes, with 10 Swiss francs being equivalent to a Louis d&#x27;or. After the end of the single currency, coin sovereignty was returned to the cantons, some of which retained the decimal Franc-Batzen-Rappen division (Aargau, city of Basel, Bern, Freiburg, Lucerne, Solothurn, Unterwalden, Uri, Vaud, Valais, Zug). Only in the canton of Neuchâtel was a franc worth 10½ &quot;Batzen&quot;. The other cantons introduced currencies with a &quot;Gulden-Schilling&quot; or Florin-Livre system. The era of the &quot;Batzen&quot; ended in 1850 with the introduction of the new Swiss franc as the single Swiss currency. An old franc did not correspond to a new franc. Seven &quot;Batzen&quot; could be exchanged for a new franc in 1850. Meanwhile, the &quot;Batzen&quot; became a colloquial term for the 10 &quot;Rappen&quot; (10 cent) coin.

<text>Clifton was a street car stop within the towns of Swampscott and Marblehead in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States. It includes Clifton Avenue.

The area was named by Benjamin Ware, a hotelier who developed Clifton with the intention of creating a resort area. His hotel, &quot;Clifton House&quot;, was regaled as one of the finest lodgings in the county. In 1884, Ware attempted to subjugate all of Marblehead Neck, and the southeastern coastline of the town, along with his resort community, and form the Town of Clifton Village. The Committee on Towns eventually denied his proposal. Attractions in the area included the Clifton House. There has been no mention as Clifton as a place, and it is not known as a village, formally or informally, by any of the residents in the area.
In 1908 the Clifton Conference, addressing the education of African Americans, was held in Clifton at the home of William N. Hartshorn. A branch of the Portland division of the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad had a station in Clifton in the 1920s. The site of the station can be seen from Clifton Avenue and the track bed is now a bike path that extends from neighboring Swampscott station in the south to Salem in the north.

Theoretically but incorrectly, Clifton feigns to encompass the whole of the southeastern ocean front of Marblehead and incorporates the areas known as Greystone, Clifton Heights (Peabody Camp), Clifton and Rockaway. However, there is no place known as Clifton. There are a number of associations that serve to preserve and improve these neighborhoods: Clifton Improvement Association and Clifton Heights Improvement Association are of particular note for the work they have done.
