<text>Midget cars, also Speedcars in Australia, is a class of racing cars. The cars are very small with a very high power-to-weight ratio and typically use four cylinder engines. They originated in the United States in the 1930s and are raced on most continents. There is a worldwide tour and national midget tours in the United States, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand.

== Cars ==

Typically, these four-cylinder-engine cars have to and weigh . The high power and small size of the cars combine to make midget racing quite dangerous; for this reason, modern midget cars are fully equipped with roll cages and other safety features. Some early major midget car manufacturers include Kurtis Kraft (1930s to 1950s) and Solar (1944–46). Midgets are intended to be driven for races of relatively short distances, usually 2.5 to 25 miles (4 to 40 km). Some events are staged inside arenas, like the Chili Bowl held in early January at the Tulsa Expo Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. There are midget races in dirt track racing and in asphalt (paved tracks).

There are three-quarter (TQ) midgets which developed from &quot;midget midget&quot; cars of the late 1940s. Quarter midgets are one-quarter the size of a full midget car.

== History ==


The first organized Midget car race happened on June 4, 1933. The sports&#x27; first regular weekly program began on August 10, 1933 at the Loyola High School Stadium in Los Angeles under the control of the first official governing body, the Midget Auto Racing Association (MARA). After spreading across the country, the sport traveled around the world; first to Australia in 1934 at Melbourne&#x27;s Olympic Park on December 15, and to New Zealand in 1937. Early midget races were held on board tracks previously used for bicycle racing. When the purpose-built speedway at Gilmore Stadium was completed, racing ended at the school stadium, and hundreds of tracks began to spring up across the United States. Angell Park Speedway in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin (near Madison) is another major track in the United States operating since the first half of the twentieth century.

The AAA Contest Board soon started sanctioning midget races across the country, facing opposition from independent drivers and racetracks. After the AAA withdrew from sanctioning races in 1955, the United States Auto Club took over as the major sanctioning body of midget car racing in the United States. NASCAR had a midget division from 1952 to 1968.

Soon after in Australia, Speedcar racing became popular with the first Australian Speedcar Championship being contested in Melbourne in 1935, its popularity running through the country&#x27;s &quot;golden era&quot; of the 1950s and 1960s. Australian promoters such as Adelaide&#x27;s Kym Bonython who ran the Rowley Park Speedway, and Empire Speedways who ran the Brisbane Exhibition Ground and the famous Sydney Showground Speedway, often imported drivers from the US, such as the popular Jimmy Davies. Promoters in Australia during this period often staged races billed as either a &quot;World Speedcar Championship&quot; or &quot;World Speedcar Derby&quot;. During this time Speedcars were arguably the most popular category in Australian speedway with crowds of up to 30,000 attending meetings at the Sydney Showground and over 10,000 in Adelaide and Brisbane.

Speedcars continue to race across Australia, with the major events being the annual Australian Speedcar Championship, state championships (held in QLD, NSW, VIC, TAS, SA, WA, and ACT), and blue ribbon events including the Australian Speedcar Grand Prix (first held in 1938), the $20k to win Australasian 50 Lap Speedcar Championship (first held in 1946)(SA), the Sydney 50 Lapper (NSW), Ultimate Speedcar Championship (QLD), the John Day Speedcar Classic (WA), the Beasley Family Memorial (VIC) and more. 

In December 2013, POWRi Midget Racing began a 16-event Lucas Oil POWRi Midget World Championship that ran until June 2014. Drivers competed in New Zealand and Australia at the beginning of the 2013–14 season and ended in the United States.

Midget car racing also grew in popularity in the Northeast of the United States, in part due to racers like Bill Schindler and events at tracks like that at Hinchcliffe Stadium.

== Stepping stone to high profile divisions ==

Many IndyCar and NASCAR drivers use midget car racing as an intermediate stepping stone on their way to more high-profile divisions, including Tony Stewart, Sarah Fisher, Rodger Ward, A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Johnnie Parsons, Ryan Newman, Kyle Larson, Jeff Gordon, Christopher Bell, Bill Vukovich, and others. Events are sometimes held on weeknights so that popular and famous drivers from other, higher-profiled types of motor racing (who race in those higher-profiled types of racing on the weekends) will be available to compete, and so that it does not conflict with drivers&#x27; home tracks.

Australia&#x27;s Triple Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Champion Sir Jack Brabham got his motor racing start in Speedcars on the dirt track ovals in his home town of Sydney. Before going on to become the , and World Champion, Brabham was a multiple Australian national and state title winner from 1948 until he turned full time to road racing in 1953.

== Notable midget car races ==

In 1959, Lime Rock Park held a famous Formula Libre race, where Rodger Ward shocked the expensive and exotic sports cars by beating them on the road course in an Offenhauser powered midget car, usually used on oval tracks. Ward used an advantageous power-to-weight ratio and dirt-track cornering abilities to steal the win.

<text>In mathematics, SO(8) is the special orthogonal group acting on eight-dimensional Euclidean space. It could be either a real or complex simple Lie group of rank 4 and dimension 28.

==Spin(8)==
Like all special orthogonal groups SO(n) with n ≥ 2, SO(8) is not simply connected. And all like all SO(n) with n &gt; 2, the fundamental group of SO(8) is isomorphic to Z2. The universal cover of SO(8) is the spin group Spin(8).

==Center==
The center of SO(8) is Z2, the diagonal matrices {±I} (as for all SO(2&quot;n&quot;) with 2&quot;n&quot; ≥ 4), while the center of Spin(8) is Z2×Z2 (as for all Spin(4&quot;n&quot;), 4&quot;n&quot; ≥ 4).

==Triality==
SO(8) is unique among the simple Lie groups in that its Dynkin diagram, (D4 under the Dynkin classification), possesses a three-fold symmetry. This gives rise to peculiar feature of Spin(8) known as triality. Related to this is the fact that the two spinor representations, as well as the fundamental vector representation, of Spin(8) are all eight-dimensional (for all other spin groups the spinor representation is either smaller or larger than the vector representation). The triality automorphism of Spin(8) lives in the outer automorphism group of Spin(8) which is isomorphic to the symmetric group S3 that permutes these three representations. The automorphism group acts on the center Z2 x Z2 (which also has automorphism group isomorphic to &quot;S&quot;3 which may also be considered as the general linear group over the finite field with two elements, &quot;S&quot;3 ≅GL(2,2)). When one quotients Spin(8) by one central Z2, breaking this symmetry and obtaining SO(8), the remaining outer automorphism group is only Z2. The triality symmetry acts again on the further quotient SO(8)/Z2.

Sometimes Spin(8) appears naturally in an &quot;enlarged&quot; form, as the automorphism group of Spin(8), which breaks up as a semidirect product: Aut(Spin(8)) ≅ PSO (8) ⋊ &quot;S&quot;3.

==Unit octonions==
Elements of SO(8) can be described with unit octonions, analogously to how elements of SO(2) can be described with unit complex numbers and elements of SO(4) can be described with unit quaternions. However the relationship is more complicated, partly due to the non-associativity of the octonions. A general element in SO(8) can be described as the product of 7 left-multiplications, 7 right-multiplications and also 7 bimultiplications by unit octonions (a bimultiplication being the composition of a left-multiplication and a right-multiplication by the same octonion and is unambiguously defined due to octonions obeying the Moufang identities).

It can be shown that an element of SO(8) can be constructed with bimultiplications, by first showing that pairs of reflections through the origin in 8-dimensional space correspond to pairs of bimultiplications by unit octonions. The triality automorphism of Spin(8) described below provides similar constructions with left multiplications and right multiplications.

===Octonions and triality===
If formula_1 and formula_2, it can be shown that this is equivalent to formula_3, meaning that formula_4 without ambiguity. A triple of maps formula_5 that preserve this identity, so that formula_6 is called an isotopy. If the three maps of an isotopy are in formula_7, the isotopy is called an orthogonal isotopy. If formula_8, then following the above formula_9 can be described as the product of bimultiplications of unit octonions, say formula_10. Let formula_11 be the corresponding products of left and right multiplications by the conjugates (i.e., the multiplicative inverses) of the same unit octonions, so formula_12, formula_13. A simple calculation shows that formula_5 is an isotopy. As a result of the non-associativity of the octonions, the only other orthogonal isotopy for formula_9 is formula_16. As the set of orthogonal isotopies produce a 2-to-1 cover of formula_17, they must in fact be formula_18.

Multiplicative inverses of octonions are two-sided, which means that formula_4 is equivalent to formula_20. This means that a given isotopy formula_5 can be permuted cyclically to give two further isotopies formula_22 and formula_23. This produces an order 3 outer automorphism of formula_18. This &quot;triality&quot; automorphism is exceptional among spin groups. There is no triality automorphism of formula_17, as for a given formula_9 the corresponding maps formula_27 are only uniquely determined up to sign.

==Root system==

==Weyl group==
Its Weyl/Coxeter group has 4! × 8 = 192 elements.

<doc id="683122" wikidata="Q43051" url="?curid=683122" title="Bambi">
<text>Bambi is a 1942 American animated coming-of-age drama film produced by Walt Disney Productions and released by RKO Radio Pictures. Loosely based on Felix Salten&#x27;s 1923 novel &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot;, the production was supervised by David D. Hand, and was directed by a team of sequence directors, including James Algar, Bill Roberts, Norman Wright, Sam Armstrong, Paul Satterfield, and Graham Heid.

The main characters are Bambi, a white-tailed deer; his parents (the Great Prince of the forest and his unnamed mother); his friends Thumper (a pink-nosed rabbit); and Flower (a skunk); and his childhood friend and future mate, Faline. In the original book, Bambi was a roe deer, a species native to Europe; but Disney decided to base the character on a mule deer from Arrowhead, California. Illustrator Maurice &quot;Jake&quot; Day convinced Disney that the mule deer had large &quot;mule-like&quot; ears and were more common to western North America; but that the white-tail deer was more recognized throughout the United States.

The film received three Academy Award nominations: Best Sound (Sam Slyfield), Best Song (for &quot;Love Is a Song&quot; sung by Donald Novis) and Original Music Score.

In June 2008, the American Film Institute presented a list of its &quot;10 Top 10&quot;—the best ten films in each of ten classic American film genres—after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Bambi&quot; attained third in animation. In December 2011, the film was added to the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically and aesthetically significant&quot;.

In January 2020, it was announced that a photorealistic computer-animated remake was in development.

==Plot==

In a Maine forest, a doe gives birth to a male fawn named Bambi, who will one day take over the position of Great Prince of the Forest, who guards the woodland creatures and (unbeknownst to Bambi himself) is his father. Bambi grows up very attached to his mother, with whom he spends most of his time. The fawn is befriended by an eager, energetic male rabbit named Thumper, who helps to teach him to walk and speak, a young male skunk he mistakenly calls &quot;Flower&quot; (who is so flattered, he keeps the name) and a female fawn named Faline. Curious and inquisitive, Bambi frequently asks about the world around him and is cautioned about the dangers of life as a forest creature by his loving mother.

One day out in a meadow, Bambi briefly sees the Great Prince but does not know that he is his father. As the Great Prince wanders uphill, he discovers the human hunter, named &quot;Man&quot; by all the animals, is coming and rushes down to the meadow to get everyone to safety. Bambi is briefly separated from his mother during that time but is escorted to her by the Great Prince as the three of them make it back in the forest just as Man fires his gun. During Bambi&#x27;s first winter, he and Thumper play in the snow while Flower hibernates. One day his mother takes him to find food when Man shows up again. As they run off, his mother is shot and killed by the hunter, leaving the little fawn mournful and alone. Taking pity on his abandoned son, the Great Prince leads Bambi home as he reveals to him that he is his father.

Next year, Bambi has matured into a young stag, and his childhood friends have also entered young adulthood. They are warned about becoming &quot;twitterpated&quot; by Friend Owl and that they will eventually fall in love, but the trio views the concept of romance with scorn. Thumper and Flower soon encounter their beautiful romantic counterparts and abandon their former thoughts on love. Bambi himself encounters Faline as a beautiful doe. Their courtship is quickly interrupted by a belligerent older stag named Ronno, who attempts to force Faline away from Bambi. Bambi successfully manages to defeat Ronno in battle and earn the rights to the doe&#x27;s affections.

Bambi is awakened afterward by the smell of smoke; he follows it and discovers it leads to a hunter camp. His father warns Bambi that Man has returned with more hunters. Bambi is separated from Faline in the turmoil, but finds her cornered by Man&#x27;s vicious hunting dogs, which he manages to ward off. Bambi escapes them and is shot by Man, but survives. Meanwhile, at the &quot;Man&#x27;s&quot; camp, their campfire suddenly spreads into the forest, resulting in a wildfire from which the forest residents flee in fear. Bambi, his father, Faline, and the forest animals manage to reach shelter on a riverbank. The following spring, Faline gives birth to twins under Bambi&#x27;s watchful eye as the new Great Prince of the Forest.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1933, Sidney Franklin purchased the rights to Felix Salten&#x27;s novel &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot; (1923) to produce a live-action film for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but soon realized that it would be too difficult to achieve. Joseph M. Schenck of United Artists suggested he make an animated version in alliance with Walt Disney, who was contemplating the idea of his first full-length feature at the time, with &quot;Bambi&quot; as one of the possible choices. Later that year, Franklin approached him with the idea, but Disney eventually refused, feeling that his animation studio was unprepared for the technical difficulties that &quot;Bambi&quot; would have presented. Franklin sold the film rights to Walt Disney in April 1937. Disney began work on crafting an animated adaptation immediately, intending it to be the company&#x27;s second feature-length animated film and their first to be based on a specific, recent work. However, the original novel was written for an adult audience, and was considered too &quot;grim&quot; and &quot;somber&quot; for a regular light-hearted Disney film. The artists also discovered that it would be challenging to animate deer realistically. These difficulties resulted in Disney putting production on hold while the studio worked on several other projects, and eventually &quot;Pinocchio&quot; became the studio&#x27;s second film. In 1938, Disney assigned Perce Pearce and Carl Fallberg to work on the film&#x27;s storyboards, but attention was soon drawn away as the studio began working on &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Finally, on August 17, 1939, production on &quot;Bambi&quot; began in earnest, but progressed slowly owing to changes in the studio personnel, location, and methodology of handling animation at the time.

===Writing===
There were many interpretations of the story. As writer and animator Mel Shaw recalled: 

Originally the film was intended to have six individual bunny characters, similar to the dwarfs in &quot;Snow White&quot;. However Perce Pearce suggested that they could instead have five generic rabbits and one rabbit with a different color than the rest, with one tooth, would have a very distinct personality. This character later became known as Thumper.

There originally was a brief shot in the scene where Bambi&#x27;s mother dies after jumping over a log and getting shot by a man. Larry Morey, however, felt the scene was too dramatic, and that it was emotional enough to justify having her death occur off screen. Walt Disney was also eager to show the man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started, but this was discarded when it was decided not to show the man at all. There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing like an old married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground, but Disney found that talking flora did not work in the context of the film, and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead. Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of a squirrel and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. However, after years of experimentation, Walt felt that the story should focus on the three principal characters: Bambi, Thumper and Flower. The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film.

The writing was completed in July 1940, by which time the film&#x27;s budget had increased to $858,000.

===Animation===
Although the animators had animated deer in &quot;Snow White&quot;, they were animated, in the words of Eric Larson, &quot;like big flour sacks&quot;. Disney wanted the animals in &quot;Bambi&quot; to be more realistic and expressive than those in &quot;Snow White&quot;. He had Rico LeBrun, a painter of animals, come and lecture to the animators on the structure and movement of animals. The animators visited the Los Angeles Zoo and Disney set up a small zoo at the studio with animals such as rabbits, ducks, owls, and skunks, and a pair of fawns named Bambi and Faline so that the artists could see first-hand the movement of these animals. LeBrun&#x27;s sketches depicted realistic animals, but as characters they lacked personality. Marc Davis created the final design of Bambi by incorporating LeBrun&#x27;s realistic study of deer anatomy but exaggerating the character&#x27;s face by making his proportions baby-like (short snout, big eyes, etc.). Although there were no humans in &quot;Bambi&quot;, live-action footage of humans was used for one scene: actress Jane Randolph and Ice Capades star Donna Atwood acted as live-action references for the scene where Bambi and Thumper are on the icy pond. The animators learned a lot about animals during the film&#x27;s production, giving them a broader spectrum of animation styles to use in future projects.

The backgrounds for the film were inspired by the Eastern American woodlands. One of the earliest and best-known artists for the Disney studio, Maurice &quot;Jake&quot; Day, spent several weeks in the Vermont and Maine forests, sketching and photographing deer, fawns, and the surrounding wilderness areas. However his first sketches were too &quot;busy&quot; as the eye did not know where to focus. Tyrus Wong, a Chinese animator, showed Day some of his impressionistic paintings of a forest. Day liked the paintings and appointed him art director of the film. Wong&#x27;s backgrounds were revolutionary since they had more detail around the center and less around the edges, thus leading a viewer&#x27;s eye to the characters.

Due to World War II, which began in Europe in 1939, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; failed at the box office. Facing financial difficulty, Disney was forced to cut 12 minutes from the film before final animation to save production costs.

== Music ==


==Release==
===Original theatrical run===

&quot;Bambi&quot; premiered in London on August 8, 1942, as the first Disney film to premiere abroad. It was released in theaters in United States five days later, on August 13. The film was released during World War II and did not perform as well as hoped. Roy O. Disney sent a telegram to his brother Walt after the New York opening of the film that read: &quot;Fell short of our holdover figure by $4,000. Just came from Music Hall. Unable to make any deal to stay third week ... Night business is our problem.&quot; The film earned RKO theatrical rentals of $1,270,000 in the United States and Canada in its initial release.

Disney lacked access to much of the European market during the war, however, the film earned rentals of $1,685,000 internationally for an initial worldwide total of $2,955,000, Disney&#x27;s third highest, behind &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937) with $7.8 million and &quot;Pinocchio&quot; (1940) with $3.2 million.

===Re-releases===
The film was re-released to theatres in the United States in 1947, 1957, 1966, 1975, 1982 and 1988. In its first reissue in the United States in 1947, the film earned additional domestic rentals of $900,000 but did much better 10 years later, more than doubling the domestic rental total with a further $2.5 million taking its total domestic rental earnings to $4.7 million.

The film earned $14 million in domestic rentals from its reissues in 1966 and 1975 giving it a total domestic rental of $18,735,000, which equates to a gross of around $40 million. In 1982, it grossed another $23 million in the United States and Canada and in 1988, a further $39 million, taking its total in the United States and Canada to $102 million, making it (at the time) the second highest-grossing animated movie of all-time after &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. With grosses from international reissues, the film has a worldwide gross of $267 million.

===Home media===
Prior to &quot;Bambi&quot;″s initial release on home video on September 28, 1989, initial orders placed in the United States and Canada up to the end of August totaled 9.8 million units, the second largest number of orders for a video at the time, behind &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;, with a wholesale value of $167 million. Even in home video, it has seen multiple releases, including three VHS releases — in 1989 (Classics Version), 1997 (Masterpiece Collection Version), and 2005 (Platinum Edition version), one Betamax release in 1989 (Classics version), two Laserdisc releases in 1989 (Classics version) and 1997 (Masterpiece Collection version). In 2005, a digitally remastered and restored Platinum Edition DVD was released; it went on moratorium on January 31, 2007.

&quot;Bambi&quot; was released as a Diamond Edition on March 1, 2011, consisting of a Blu-ray and DVD combo pack. This release included multiple bonus features not previously included in &quot;Bambi&quot; home releases: a documentary entitled &quot;Inside Walt&#x27;s Story Meetings – Enhanced Edition&quot;, two deleted scenes, a deleted song, an image gallery, and a game entitled &quot;Disney&#x27;s Big Book of Knowledge: Bambi Edition&quot;. This release also marked the first use of &quot;Disney Second Screen&quot;, a feature which is accessed via a computer or iPad app download that syncs with the Blu-ray disc, allowing the viewer to follow along by interacting with animated flip-books, galleries and trivia while watching the movie. A UK version of Diamond Edition was released on February 7, 2011.

In honor of the film&#x27;s 75th anniversary, &quot;Bambi&quot; was released as part of the Walt Disney Signature Collection on May 23, 2017 (digital) and June 6, 2017 (Blu-ray/DVD/digital combo pack).

On August 18, 2023, &quot;Bambi&quot; was re-released in cinemas across the UK only for one week as part of Disney&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

===Localization===
On the initiative of Stephen Greymoming, professor of Native American studies and anthropology at the University of Montana, an Arapaho-language dubbing of the movie was produced in 1994, in collaboration with the Northern Plains Educational Foundation. The final product was, however, only a partial dubbing, as the spoken parts were dubbed in Arapaho, but all the songs were left in English. The dubbed version of the movie premiered on November 3 the same year, and Disney later provided the Arapaho Nation with 2000 VHS tapes of the movie. The dubbing was never issued again in any other forms, until it was uploaded on the streaming platform Disney+ in October 2022. &quot;Bambi&quot; was the first of three Disney movies to receive a dubbing in a Native American language. The next such instance had to wait until 2016, when Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; received a dubbing in Navajo, and then Disney&#x27;s &quot;Moana&quot; in Hawaiian two years later. While the first was also made available on Disney+, the latter was only distributed for free in schools in Hawaii, and never received any home media release form.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
At the time of the film&#x27;s release, &quot;Bambi&quot; received mixed reviews from the critics, mainly because of the lack of fantasy elements in the film and objection towards a dramatic story of animals and their struggle to survive in the woods and avoid the threat of humans. &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed that &quot;In the search for perfection, Mr. Disney has come perilously close to tossing away his whole world of cartoon fantasy.&quot; Manny Farber of &quot;The New Republic&quot; wrote that &quot;Bambi is interesting because it&#x27;s the first one that&#x27;s been entirely unpleasant…Mickey wouldn&#x27;t be caught dead in this.&quot;

Farber added that &quot;In an attempt to ape the trumped-up realism of flesh and blood movies, he has given up fantasy, which was pretty much the magic element.&quot; Even Disney&#x27;s daughter Diane complained, saying that Bambi&#x27;s mother did not need to die. When Walt claimed that he was only following the book, Diane protested, saying that he had taken other liberties before and that Walt Disney could do whatever he wanted.

Today, however, &quot;Bambi&quot; is viewed much more favorably. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 91% based on 53 reviews with an average rating of . The website consensus reads: &quot;Elegantly animated and deeply touching, &quot;Bambi&quot; is an enduring, endearing, and moving Disney classic.&quot; Critics Mick Martin and Marsha Porter call the film &quot;the crowning achievement of Walt Disney&#x27;s animation studio&quot;. English film historian Leslie Halliwell wrote that &quot;Bambi&quot; was &quot;one of Disney&#x27;s most memorable and brilliant achievements with a great comic character in Thumper and a climactic forest fire sequence that is genuinely thrilling.&quot; He concluded that it was &quot;a triumph of the animator&#x27;s arts&quot;.

===Accolades===
In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its &quot;10 Top 10&quot; – the best ten films in ten classic American film genres – after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. &quot;Bambi&quot; was acknowledged as the third best film in the animation genre. It is also listed in the Top 25 Horror Movies of All Time by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; states, &quot;has a primal shock that still haunts oldsters who saw it 40, 50, 65 years ago.&quot;

==Legacy==
The off-screen villain &quot;Man&quot; has been placed No. 20 on AFI&#x27;s List of Heroes and Villains.

Some critics have cited parallels between Frank Churchill&#x27;s theme music for &quot;Man&quot; (which consisted of three simple notes) and John Williams&#x27;s theme music in &quot;Jaws&quot; (which consists of two notes).

Paul McCartney has credited the shooting death of Bambi&#x27;s mother for his initial interest in animal rights.

Soon after the film&#x27;s release, Walt Disney allowed his characters to appear in fire prevention public service campaigns. However, Bambi was only loaned to the government for a year, so a new symbol was needed, leading to the creation of Smokey Bear. Bambi and his mother also make a cameo appearance in the satirical 1955 Donald Duck short &quot;No Hunting&quot;: drinking from a forest stream, the deer are startled by a sudden trickle of beer cans and other debris, and Bambi&#x27;s mother tells him, &quot;Man is in the forest. Let&#x27;s dig out.&quot;

In 2006, the Ad Council, in partnership with the United States Forest Service, started a series of Public Service Announcements that feature footage from &quot;Bambi&quot; and &quot;Bambi II&quot; for wildfire prevention. During the ads, as the &quot;Bambi&quot; footage is shown, the screen will momentarily fade into black with the text &quot;Don&#x27;t let our forests...become once upon a time&quot;, and usually (but not always) ending the ads with Bambi&#x27;s line &quot;Mother, what we gonna do today?&quot; followed by Smokey Bear saying &quot;Only you can prevent wildfires&quot; as the Smokey logo is shown on the screen. Bambi had previously been the Forest Service&#x27;s advertising icon beginning in 1942, but was only allowed by Disney to use the character for a year.

In December 2011, &quot;Bambi&quot; was among the films selected for preservation in the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry. In its induction, the Registry said that the film was one of Walt Disney&#x27;s favorites and that it has been &quot;recognized for its eloquent message of nature conservation.&quot;

Characters of the film appear in several other Disney media, such as guest appearances in the animated television series &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, Bambi being a character to summon in the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and its sequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, and Bambi, Thumper, Flower, Faline and Great Prince of the Forest being playable characters in &quot;Disney Magic Kingdoms&quot;.

On December 17, 2018, a prison sentence passed against a man, in what is considered the biggest deer poaching case in Missouri history, contained the stipulation that the prisoner must view the film at least once each month during his one-year prison sentence.

==Media and merchandise==
===Comic adaptation===
The &quot;Silly Symphony&quot; Sunday comic strip ran a three-month-long adaptation of &quot;Bambi&quot; from July 19 to October 4, 1942.

===Sequel===

Set in the middle of &quot;Bambi&quot;, &quot;Bambi II&quot; shows the Great Prince of the Forest struggling to raise the motherless Bambi, and Bambi&#x27;s doubts about his father&#x27;s love. The film was released direct-to-video on February 7, 2006. While the film was a direct-to-video release in the United States and other countries, including Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan, it was a theatrical release in some countries, including Australia, Austria, Brazil, Dominican Republic, France, Mexico, the United Kingdom and some other European countries.

===CGI remake===
On January 28, 2020, it was announced that a photorealistic CGI feature-length remake is in development with a script co-written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Lindsey Beer. Paul Weitz, Chris Weitz, and Andrew Miano will produce the film; a joint-venture production between Walt Disney Pictures, Depth of Field Studios, and Known Universe Productions. Disney described the film as a &quot;companion piece&quot; to &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (2019), as the three films feature wildlife that requires extensive CGI and special effects. On June 13, 2023, it was revealed that Sarah Polley is in talks to direct the film, which is said to be a musical that will feature music from six-time Grammy-winning country star Kacey Musgraves. Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster wrote the most recent draft of the script. As of March 2024, Polley was reportedly no longer attached as director.

==Copyright==
The copyrights for &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot; were inherited by Anna Wyler, Salten&#x27;s daughter, who renewed them in 1954. After her death, Wyler&#x27;s husband sold the rights to Twin Books, a publishing company which subsequently filed a lawsuit against Disney, claiming Disney owed it money for the continued licensing for the use of the book. Disney countered by claiming that Salten had published the story in 1923 without a copyright notice, thus it immediately entered into the public domain. Disney also argued that if the claimed 1923 publication date was accurate, then the copyright renewal filed in 1954 had been registered after the deadline and was thus invalid. The courts initially upheld Disney&#x27;s view; however, in 1996, the Ninth Circuit Court reversed the decision on appeal in &quot;Twin Books Corp. v. Walt Disney Co.&quot;, 83 F.3d 1162 (1996).

The American copyright of the novel expired on January 1, 2022.

<text>The Iron Ring is a ring worn by many Canadian engineers as a symbol and reminder of the obligations and ethics associated with their profession. The ring is presented in a private ceremony known as the Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer. Qualification for the obligation ceremony is either completion of a CEAB accredited engineering program or meeting the academic standard for licensure with a provincial engineering regulator. The concept of the ritual and the rings originated from H. E. T. Haultain in 1922, with assistance from Rudyard Kipling, who crafted the ritual at Haultain&#x27;s request.

==Symbolism==
The ring symbolizes the pride engineers have in their profession, while simultaneously reminding them of their humility. The ring serves as a reminder to the engineer and others of the engineer&#x27;s obligation to live by a high standard of professional conduct. However, the ring is not a symbol of qualification as an engineer; engineering qualifications are determined by provincial and territorial licensing bodies.

==History==

The Iron Ring originated from H. E. T. Haultain, a mining engineering professor at the University of Toronto. On 25 January 1922, Haultain proposed that engineers take an ethical oath. From 1922 to 1925, the structure that would administer the oaths, or &quot;callings,&quot; was organized. Known as the Corporation of the Seven Wardens, the organization was named in honour of the first seven presidents of the Canadian Society for Civil Engineers.

The text of the calling was written by English poet Rudyard Kipling, at the request of Haultain. Haultain asked Kipling to author the calling partly because of Kipling&#x27;s poem &quot;The Sons of Martha&quot;, which paid tribute to an engineer. Kipling&#x27;s calling sought to emphasize the responsibilities of an engineer, affirming their responsibility to &quot;not henceforward suffer or pass, or be privy to the passing of, Bad Workmanship or Faulty Material.&quot; Kipling&#x27;s calling also affirmed that an engineer must not compromise their work, in spite of external pressures; and was a call for professional unity between engineers.

On the 25 April 1925, Haultain administered the first Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer in the University Club in Montreal. A second ritual was administered in Toronto on 1 May 1925. Iron Rings are awarded to engineers during the ritual, in reference to &quot;[their] Honour and Cold Iron,&quot; a phrase used in the calling. A myth persists that the initial batch of Iron Rings was made from the beams of the first Quebec Bridge, a bridge that collapsed during construction in 1907 due to poor planning and design by the overseeing engineers. However, the initial batch of Iron Rings were actually produced by World War I veterans at Christie Street Military Hospital in Toronto.

The Wardens originally considered expanding the ritual to the United States. However, they later ruled against expansion, fearing a loss of control over the ritual. Efforts to secure control of the ritual were made in 1935, when the obligation was copyrighted, and the Corporation of the Seven Wardens formally incorporated in 1938.

==Design==

The Iron Ring is made from either iron or stainless steel. It is intended to be worn on the little finger of the working (dominant) hand. There, the facets act as a sharp reminder of one&#x27;s obligation while the engineer works, because it could drag on the writing surface while the engineer is drawing or writing. This is particularly true of recently obligated engineers, whose rings bear sharp, unworn, facets. Protocol dictates that the rings should be returned by retired engineers or by the families of deceased engineers. Some camps offer previously obligated or &quot;experienced&quot; rings, but they are now rare due to medical and practical complications.

The Iron Ring is small and understated, and was designed as a constant reminder, rather than a piece of jewelry. The Rings were originally hammered manually with a rough outer surface. The modern machined ring shares a similar design as a reminder of the manual process. Twelve half-circle facets are carved into the top and bottom of the outer surface, with the two sets of facets offset rotationally by fifteen degrees.

==Presentation ceremony==
The Ritual of the Calling of an Engineer is the ceremony where graduating engineers participate in the &quot;calling,&quot; and receive their Iron Rings. The ritual is intended to invoke the moral, ethical and professional commitment of an engineer, with the ring provided as a reminder of this obligation. The ceremonies are private affairs with no publicity. Invitations to attend are extended to local engineering alumni and professional engineers by those who are scheduled to participate. Some universities extend an invitation to witness the ceremony to anyone in the engineering profession; however, engineers that have not undergone the ritual are not permitted to participate in it. Some graduating engineers choose to receive a ring passed on from a relative or mentor, giving the ceremony a personal touch.

The rings are given during the ceremony held at individual universities, each assigned one of 28 camps of the Corporation of the Seven Wardens. Because iron deteriorates turning the finger black and making the ring fit more loosely, all camps except Toronto have stopped conferring rings made of iron and have switched to stainless steel rings. At the Toronto camp, the individual ceremonies held at the University of Toronto, Toronto Metropolitan University, Ontario Tech University, and York University continue to provide recipients with a choice of rings made of iron or stainless steel.

==Similar practices==
Based upon the success of the Iron Ring in Canada, a similar program was created in the United States, where the Order of the Engineer was founded in 1970. The organization conducts similar ring ceremonies at a number of U.S. colleges, in which the recipient signs an &quot;Obligation of the Engineer&quot; and receives a stainless steel Engineer&#x27;s Ring (which, unlike the Canadian Iron Ring, can be smooth and not faceted). The first such ceremony occurred on June 4, 1970, at the Cleveland State University under the supervision of Lloyd Chancy.

The NTH Ring is a ring awarded by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, formerly Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH), to graduates of their Masters of Science in architecture or engineering programs.

<text>The Karlovy Vary Region () is an administrative unit () of the Czech Republic, located in the westernmost part of the country. It is named after its capital Karlovy Vary. It is known for spas, which include Karlovy Vary and Mariánské Lázně.

The Karlovy Vary Region, as a higher territorial self-governing unit, was created in 2000 in the northern part of the West Bohemian Region. The seat of the region is Karlovy Vary. In terms of size, number of municipalities, and population, it ranks among the smaller regions of the Czech Republic. Its area (3,314 km²) covers 4.25% of the territory of the Czech Republic. The Karlovy Vary Region is the third smallest region by area, right after Prague and the Liberec Region. By population, the Karlovy Vary Region is the smallest region in the Czech Republic, with approximately 279,000 inhabitants.

==Administrative divisions==
The Karlovy Vary Region is divided into three districts:

At a lower level, the region has 134 municipalities, comprising 56 in the Karlovy Vary District, 40 in the Cheb District and 38 in the Sokolov District.
Since 1 January 2003, Karlovy Vary Region has been administratively divided into 7 administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers (AD MEP):
==Population==
Karlovy Vary Region is the smallest region in the Czech Republic with a population of less than 300,000. Only 11 municipalities have populations greater than 5,000. The largest municipality of the region is Karlovy Vary with a population of around 50,000. The table below shows the municipalities in Karlovy Vary Region with the largest population (as of 1 January 2024):

Other significant towns in Karlovy Vary Region are Nejdek, Kraslice, Františkovy Lázně and Horní Slavkov.

==Economy==
===Spas===
The region is responsible over half of the county&#x27;s spa industry. Twelve spas are in the city of Karlovy Vary. Other spa towns in the region include Františkovy Lázně, Mariánské Lázně, Lázně Kynžvart and Jáchymov. The spas are visited by Czechs as well as by people from the rest of Europe, Russia, Israel and North America. The Karlovy Vary spa wafer, a local food item, was awarded protected designation of origin (PDO) status by the European Commission in 2011.

The water from the region is used in locally produced beverages including Mattoni from Karlovy Vary and Aquila from the village of Kyselka.

===Black Triangle===
The region is the home of two power stations, Vřesová and Tisová, both in the Sokolov District. The region is also part of the so-called Black Triangle, an area of heavy industrialization and environmental damage on the three-way border of Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic.

==Transport==
The Karlovy Region is served by Karlovy Vary Airport, which handled more than 100,000 passengers in 2012. The region is also home to two other airports, neither of which are used for passenger flights. These are Cheb Airport, the oldest airport in the country, and Mariánské Lázně Airport.

The region lacks any motorways. The unfinished R6 expressway passes through the region, linking Cheb and Karlovy Vary to Prague. The length of operated railway lines in the region is .

==Education==
The Czech University of Life Sciences Prague opened a centre in the village of Dalovice in the Karlovy Vary District in 2007. The private College of Karlovy Vary is also located in the region, in addition to regional centres of the Banking Institute / College of Banking in Karlovy Vary and the University of West Bohemia in Cheb and Sokolov.

==Career==
===1991–2003: Early work===
Bell started acting at the age of five, encouraged by his father who attempted to put him into Little League Baseball and other sports with no success before finding Bell&#x27;s talent in public speaking and his confidence when impersonating people he would watch on television. Bell stated, &quot;I was five, and my dad kind of said, &#x27;Hey, you wanna be an actor?&#x27; and I said, &#x27;Sure,&#x27; that kind of thing, you know? I was kind of put into it by my dad but, you know, good. I really love it, and I still do it.&quot; Bell&#x27;s first televised commercial was for Whirlpool Appliances. &quot;I had to sit under a tree and eat a Popsicle,&quot; Bell later stated, &quot;I thought, &#x27;I could get used to this.&#x27;&quot; His first television show appearance was on a 1994 episode of &quot;Home Improvement&quot;. He appeared in the 1996 film &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, and had a small role in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Frogger&quot; in 1998.

The song was featured in the &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot; series finale &quot;Really Big Shrimp&quot;. The song also made an appearance on the Pop 100 at number 67 and on the Hot Digital Songs chart at number 45. Because of the song&#x27;s popularity, on October 16, 2007, the Radio Disney single edit version of his song &quot;Makes Me Happy&quot; was released on iTunes.

He also featured on the theme song for the show &quot;iCarly&quot;, &quot;Leave It All to Me&quot;, with his Drake &amp; Josh co-star Miranda Cosgrove. The music video for the song was released on Cosgrove&#x27;s Vevo YouTube channel on September 28, 2010. The song took the lowest position on the Hot 100, peaking at number 100. It also peaked on the Pop 100 at number 83.

==Personal life==
===Childhood assault and health problems===
In 2024, Bell revealed that dialogue coach Brian Peck (of no relation to Josh Peck) repeatedly sexually assaulted him when he was 15, during the period after filming of the last season of &quot;The Amanda Show&quot; and before filming the first season for &quot;Drake &amp; Josh&quot;. Peck was arrested on August 19, 2003, later being convicted for lewd conduct with a minor. Because of his age, Bell&#x27;s identity as the victim was not publicly revealed in the court records. Bell first revealed his identity and shared his experience in the 2024 documentary &quot;Quiet on Set&quot;. On &quot;The Sarah Fraser Show&quot; podcast on March 22, 2024, Bell revealed that he went to rehab after his interview for the documentary. 

On December 29, 2005, Bell, then 19 years old, and a friend of his were driving from Malibu to Los Angeles when, while stopped at a red light on California State Route 1, the two were struck by an oncoming vehicle. Though Bell&#x27;s passenger suffered only bruises, Bell suffered more severe injuries, including a cervical fracture of his neck vertebrae, a broken jaw, the loss of seven teeth, and deep facial lacerations. As part of his recovery, Bell required more than 70 facial stitches, had to have his jaw wired shut for two months, and underwent surgery on his chin and mouth.

===Family===
In July 2021, Bell revealed that in 2018 he had married his girlfriend of five years and that they had a son. After separating in September 2022, Bell&#x27;s wife filed for divorce on April 20, 2023, citing irreconcilable differences.

In 2007, Bell purchased a house in Los Feliz for $2,050,000. After Bell filed for bankruptcy in California in early 2014, the house was taken in foreclosure.

As of March 2024, Bell primarily resides in Mexico City. In an interview with Yordi Rosado on March 24, 2024, Bell revealed that he wanted to move to Mexico, telling Rosado &quot;I feel more at home when I&#x27;m here. I have more friends here cause a lot of my friends from Los Angeles have moved to Florida, Texas, Louisiana, and so my relationship with them is on the phone anyway&quot;.

== Legal issues ==
=== Driving under the influence ===
Bell was arrested on December 21, 2015, for driving under the influence in Glendale, California, at 2:45 am after police officers witnessed him swerving and driving well over the speed limit. He was subsequently released on $20,000 bond and pleaded not guilty. In September 2016 Bell pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four days in jail and four years&#x27; probation and would be required to attend an alcohol education program; Bell served only one day for good behavior. Bell was previously charged with driving under the influence in 2010 in relation to an incident in San Diego in 2009.

=== Child endangerment conviction ===
In August 2020, his former girlfriend Melissa Lingafelt accused him of verbal and physical abuse during their three-year relationship in the late 2000s. Lingafelt also accused Bell of inappropriate behavior regarding underage girls. Bell has denied the allegations.

On June 4, 2021, Bell was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio, on charges relating to &quot;attempted endangering [of] children and disseminating matter harmful to juveniles.&quot; A public information officer with the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor&#x27;s Office, said &quot;the 15-year-old victim, who had established a relationship with Bell several years prior, attended his concert in December 2017 ... While there, Bell violated his duty of care and, in doing so, created a risk of harm to the victim.&quot; The Cleveland Police also found that Bell had sent the minor &quot;inappropriate social media messages&quot; for &quot;months leading up to the concert&quot;. Bell was 31 at the time of the alleged incident. Bell pleaded not guilty, and was freed on a $2,500 personal bond, and was ordered to provide a DNA sample. He agreed to have no contact with the accuser in the case with a pretrial hearing scheduled for June 23.

On June 23, 2021, Bell pleaded guilty to both charges. On July 12, 2021, Bell&#x27;s accuser, then 19, made a public appearance and statement accusing him of sexually assaulting her while she was underage, in addition to the endangerment charges. Bell was sentenced to two years of probation and 200 hours of community service, which he was permitted to complete in California. He also is not allowed to have any contact with his victim.

Bell claimed in a video that he ceased texting his accuser when her age came to light, and that no images of a sexual matter were exchanged. He also stated that he accepted a plea deal because &quot;I felt that this was the best way to get this over quickly, and for everyone involved to be able to move on.&quot;

<doc id="683154" wikidata="Q1035095" url="?curid=683154" title="Captain Beyond">
<text>Captain Beyond is an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 1971. Consisting of former Deep Purple singer Rod Evans, former Johnny Winter drummer Bobby Caldwell, former Iron Butterfly guitarist Larry Reinhardt and former Iron Butterfly bassist Lee Dorman, the band had an eclectic style bridging elements of hard rock, progressive rock and jazz fusion with space rock. They released three albums between 1972 and 1977. 

The band was plagued from its inception with significant problems, including lawsuits involving Evans, Reinhardt and Dorman with their former bands, and a dispute over musical style with their record label, Capricorn Records. Although the band performed well together, relationships among the various band members were strained. In particular, singer Rod Evans left and rejoined the band several times beginning in 1971, and made his departure permanent in late 1973, after the release of the band&#x27;s second album.

==History==

The original line-up for Captain Beyond included former Deep Purple singer Rod Evans, former Johnny Winter drummer Bobby Caldwell, former Iron Butterfly guitarist Larry &quot;Rhino&quot; Reinhardt and former Iron Butterfly bassist Lee Dorman alongside keyboardist Lewie Gold. Gold left for personal reasons before the first album was recorded. The remaining line-up recorded the self-titled debut album, released in 1972 by Capricorn Records, a Macon, Georgia-based independent label primarily known for cultivating such Southern rock groups as The Allman Brothers Band and Wet Willie.

Following that album, Caldwell left the band to join Derringer and was replaced by Brian Glascock. Also joining the band around that time were keyboardist Reese Wynans and conguero Guille Garcia. The record company&#x27;s chosen producer, Giorgio Gomelsky, did not like Glascock&#x27;s drumming and requested a new drummer. Glascock was released and Marty Rodriguez was brought in on drums on the recommendation of Garcia. This six-man lineup recorded the group&#x27;s second album, &quot;Sufficiently Breathless&quot;, with producer and Capricorn Records co-founder Phil Walden. Tension during the recording led to Evans quitting, and the band splitting consequently. The original lineup with Caldwell reformed later in 1973 for gigs in the US and Canada. However, Evans left the band permanently around Christmas of 1973 and the band broke up.

The band reformed in 1976 with Caldwell, Dorman, and Rhino, being joined first by Jason Cahoon and later with Willy Daffern as vocalist. They recorded the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Dawn Explosion&quot; on Warner Bros., but broke up in 1978.

Caldwell and Rhino reformed Captain Beyond in 1998, with Jimi Interval on vocals, Dan Frye on keyboards, and Jeff Artabasy on bass. In 1999, Swedish record label Record Heaven released a tribute to Captain Beyond entitled &quot;Thousand Days of Yesterday&quot;. The album features fellow 1970s rockers Pentagram playing &quot;Dancing Madly Backwards&quot;. In 2000 they released a four track EP entitled &quot;Night Train Calling&quot;. Shortly thereafter they were joined briefly by guitarist Steve Petrey.

Captain Beyond once again disbanded in 2003 when lead guitarist Larry Reinhardt developed cancer. Following treatment, Reinhardt continued to perform music until late 2011, when he again fell ill. He died on January 2, 2012. Bassist Lee Dorman died on December 21, 2012. Rod Evans has retired from performing, partly due to legal troubles with his original Deep Purple bandmates, and his current residence is still unknown. However, Caldwell mentioned in a 2015 interview that Evans was doing just fine and was working in the field of respiratory therapy.

Caldwell resurrected the band in 2013, with a lineup consisting of Don Bonzi, Jeff &quot;Boday&quot; Christensen, and Jamie Holka, bassist Allen Carmen, and guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist Simon Lind. In 2015 Carmen and Christensen departed the band and Artabasy returned as bassist. The reformed group began touring in 2015.

<doc id="683156" wikidata="Q193307" url="?curid=683156" title="Olomouc Region">
<text>Olomouc Region (; , ; ) is an administrative unit () of the Czech Republic, located in the north-western and central part of its historical region of Moravia (&quot;Morava&quot;) and in a small part of the historical region of Czech Silesia (&quot;České Slezsko&quot;). It is named for its capital Olomouc.

Olomouc region borders with the Moravian-Silesian Region (in the east), Zlín Region (in the south-east), South Moravian Region (in the south-west) and Pardubice Region (in the west). Furthermore, the region shares a 104 km long border with Poland (in the north).

==Administrative divisions==
The Olomouc Region is divided into 5 districts:
On the territory of the region there are 13 administrative districts of municipalities with extended powers and 20 administrative districts of municipalities with authorized local authority.

==Population==
In January 2024 the population of the Olomouc Region totalled 632,864 inhabitants. As of 2019, 50.3% of region&#x27;s population lived in municipalities with more than 4,000. Out of 402 municipalities located in the region (including one military area), 30 had a status of town. Region&#x27;s capital Olomouc is with approximately 100 thousand inhabitants the largest city. With 120.1 inhabitants per km2 the region was close to the national average of 135 inhabitants per km2. There were, of course, differences within the region: the lowest population density was in the Jeseník District.
In the long term, the population of the region has been aging. The average age of population in 2019 is 42.8, which is the 4th highest among regions in the Czech Republic.

===Cities and towns===
The table below provides the list of region&#x27;s most populous cities and towns as of 1 January 2024:


==Geography==

The total area of the region amounts to 5,267 km2, which is 6.7% of the entire area of the Czech Republic.
The northern part of the region is of mountainous nature. The Jeseníky mountains are located here, including Praděd, which is the highest point of the region (1,492 m above sea level). The southern part of the region consists of the Hanakian lowland. The lowest point of the region is situated on the water level of the Morava River near to Kojetín in the Přerov District (190 m above sea level).
The Morava river flows through the region and the majority of the region&#x27;s territory belongs to Morava&#x27;s drainage basin. A small northern part of the region belongs to the drainage basin of Odra River, which flows to the Baltic Sea.
The Olomouc Region offers a great variety of natural points of interest. Protected landscape area of the Jeseníky mountains offers a number of scenic places such as the largest Moravian peatbog Rejvíz and the 45m high Vysoký Waterfall. Another scenic place is Dlouhé Stráně water reservoir situated on the top of a hill. Protected landscape area Litovelské Pomoraví offers floodplain forests with many endangered species of plants and animals. Finally, many caves can be found in the region: Javoříčko Caves (), Mladeč Caves () and Zbrašov aragonite caves ().

==Economy==

The region&#x27;s economy focuses on traditional agriculture, processing industry and
services. Conditions for further development of the region are its attractive location, transport accessibility, developed infrastructure, enough qualified labour force and entry of foreign investors. 
In 2011, the total economically active population of the Olomouc Region was 307.2 thousand people, of which 283.9 thousand were employed and 23.3 thousand unemployed. The unemployment rate in 12/2022 was 3,6%. 
The Olomouc Region is an industrial area with developed services. The economy of the
Hanakian districts is more stable and diverse than the economy of the Jeseník District and northern part of the Šumperk District. The latter two districts belong to economically weaker regions due to their position, transport accessibility and disturbance of social and economic life after the Second World War (displacement of German population).
The gross domestic product of the Olomouc Region amounted to 4.7% of the nation GDP in 2021. The GDP per capita of the region reaches 79.4% of the national average. The average monthly wage of employees in the region reached 36,481 CZK (EUR 1520) in 3Q/2022.
Significant sectors of the region&#x27;s economy are agriculture, food industry, textile and clothing industry, manufacture of machinery, optics and optical equipment.
In 2011, there were 138,970 businesses, organisations and entrepreneurs based in the region. Most of them were private entrepreneurs registered according to the trade law (76.6%) and business companies (8.4%). 157 industrial enterprises had 100 or more employees, employing in total 41,222 employees.

===Agriculture===
The share of arable land was 39.4% in 2011 but was showing a decreasing trend over past years while the share of non-agricultural land has been increasing and reached 46.9% in 2011.
Southern and central parts of the region belong to areas with the most fertile land. Crop yields (barley, wheat, rape and industrial sugar beet) reach the highest amounts of the entire country.

===Transport===
Transport accessibility of the region is provided by 3,582 km of roads, of which only 12.3% are first class roads. The motorways with two lanes connect Olomouc with Brno (I/46), Ostrava (I/35 followed by D1) and the Pardubice Region (I/35). Once finished, the d1 motorway will connect Brno with Ostrava and will cross the southern part of Olomouc Region.
There is 601 km of railways in the region. Important rail junctions are in Olomouc and Přerov. The railway network is spread equally all over the Region´s territory. Road network is denser in the southern flat part of the Region.
Near to the city of Olomouc there is an airport for small airliners, which obtained status of an international airport.

===Tourism===
The Olomouc Region belongs to regions with the smallest number of accommodation establishments. In 2009 there were 338 collective accommodation establishments. These were placed primarily in the Jeseník District and the Šumperk District that are most visited by tourists.

==Quality of life==
In 2011, 14,347 crimes were committed in the region, of which 6,744 (47%) were solved.
Compared to other regions of the Czech Republic, the environment of Olomouc Region can be marked as relatively less damaged. The values of specific emissions do not reach the average national values. Mountain areas and foothills have excellent air quality and are important sources of drinking water.

===Health care===
In 2011 the region counted 9 hospitals, 16 specialized therapeutic institutions and other health establishments by 2,897 physicians and 6,466 paramedical workers.

<text>William Blair (October 17, 1921 – April 20, 2014) was a Negro league pitcher.

Blair graduated Booker T. Washington High School in Dallas and briefly attended Prairie View A&amp;M University. He began his baseball career at the age of 16, playing for a barnstorming team in Mineola, Texas, and went on to join the United States Army, where he became the youngest African American to serve as a first sergeant in the Army during World War II.

He pitched from 1946 to 1951, for teams including the Indianapolis Clowns, Cincinnati Crescents, and was a player-manager for the Dallas Black Giants. He played against players such as Cool Papa Bell, Satchel Paige, and Hilton Smith. After retiring from baseball, he became a fixture in the community, running a local newspaper, the &quot;Elite News&quot;, and organizing golf tournaments and parades. He died in Campbell, Texas in 2014.

William Blair Park in South Dallas, formerly Rochester Park, was named after him.

<text>The small minivet (Pericrocotus cinnamomeus) is a small passerine bird. This minivet is found in tropical southern Asia from the Indian subcontinent east to Indonesia.

==Description==
The small minivet is 16 cm long with a strong dark beak and long wings. The male differs from most other common minivets by having grey, not glossy black, upperparts and head, and orange underparts, fading to yellow on the belly, orange tail edges, rump and wing patches.

The female is grey above, with yellow underparts (including the face), tail edges, rump and wing patches.

There is much racial variation. The male &quot;P. c. pallidus&quot; of the northwest Indian subcontinent is pale grey above, with the underparts whitish except on the throat and flanks, whereas the male &quot;P. c. malabaricus&quot; of peninsular and southern India is darker above, has more extensive scarlet below. The female of the southern race is also brighter yellow below.

==Behaviour==
The small minivet is a widespread and common resident breeding bird in thorn jungle and scrub. The nest is a cup-like structure into which two to four spotted eggs are laid and incubated by the female.

This minivet catches insects in trees by flycatching or while perched. The small minivet will form small flocks. Its call is a high, thin &quot;swee swee swee&quot;.

<doc id="683176" wikidata="Q2494198" url="?curid=683176" title="Alphonse James de Rothschild">
<text>Mayer Alphonse James Rothschild (1 February 1827 – 26 May 1905), was a French financier, vineyard owner, art collector, philanthropist, racehorse owner/breeder and a member of the
Rothschild banking family of France.

==Biography==
Known as Alphonse, he was the eldest son of James Mayer de Rothschild (1792–1868). His mother was Betty de Rothschild (1805–1886), the daughter of Salomon Mayer von Rothschild from the Austrian branch of the family. Alphonse was educated to take his place at the head of France&#x27;s de Rothschild Frères bank, training in the other Rothschild banking houses in Europe. In France he soon became a major force in the financial world and in 1855 was appointed a regent of the Banque de France, a position he held for the remainder of his life.

In 1857 Alphonse de Rothschild married a cousin, Leonora &quot;Laure&quot; de Rothschild (1837–1911), the daughter of Lionel de Rothschild (1808–1879) of the English branch of the family. They had four children. Their firstborn, Bettina Caroline (1858–1892), married Albert Salomon von Rothschild.

==As a vineyard operator==
Alphonse and his brother Gustave developed somewhat of a rivalry with their English cousin Nathaniel de Rothschild who had moved to Paris after marrying their sister Charlotte. Nathaniel worked at de Rothschild Frères bank and in 1853 he purchased the Château Brane Mouton vineyard in Pauillac in the Médoc wine growing region. Nathaniel&#x27;s Mouton vineyard received a second-growth ranking in the Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855. Just three months before their father died in 1868, Alphonse and Gustave convinced him to buy the more prestigious First Growth Château Lafite vineyard in Pauillac when it came up for sale.

On the death of their father in 1868, Alphonse and Gustave inherited the Château Lafite-Rothschild vineyard. However, they lived in Paris and the vineyard was not significant relative to their massive investments in banking and other business ventures. As such, they only visited the Pauillac vineyard occasionally, maintaining little more than an arms-length interest. On their deaths, the Rothschild brothers willed the property to a son and it remains in family hands to this day.

==As financier and investor==

Alphonse de Rothschild inherited a large fortune on the death of his father in 1868, including share positions in de Rothschild Frères bank and the Chemin de Fer du Nord company. He began his training in finance at a young age and his father put him in charge of the bank&#x27;s gold bullion operations.

During the 1860s, great debates raged across Europe and the United States as to an appropriate monetary system for the changing times. In France, the prominent Péreire brothers bankers were proponents of paper money in contrast to Alphonse de Rothschild who defended preservation of France&#x27;s bimetallism system. Initially, Alphonse had an influential supporter for his position through his long friendship with statesman Léon Say, a former employee of the Rothschild&#x27;s Chemin de Fer du Nord who became the French Minister of Finance in 1872. However, as part of the Latin Monetary Union France joined most of the rest of Europe and adopted the gold standard by 1873. In 1880, Alphonse de Rothschild put together the deal that saw the family take control of Société Le Nickel (SLN), a nickel mining business in New Caledonia.

During the Franco-Prussian War, Alphonse de Rothschild had guarded the ramparts of Paris on the eve of the Prussian siege. When a peace treaty was finally agreed to in January 1871, his bank would play a major role, not only in raising the five billion francs France was obliged to pay in reparations to the new German Empire, but in helping bring about economic stability. France made a dramatic financial recovery and repaid the reparations bill ahead of schedule which, under terms of the armistice, brought about an end to the German occupation of northern French territory in 1873. In contrast though, that same year, both the Berlin and Vienna stock markets crashed, plunging all of Central Europe into an economic depression. However, in less than a decade Alphonse de Rothschild would witness considerable economic upheaval in France. The collapse of the investment bank Société de l&#x27;Union Générale precipitated the 1882 stock market crash that triggered a downturn in the economy.

In 1883, he founded the Caspian and Black Sea Oil Company (Bnito) to compete with US oil exports. The enterprise became a competitor of Standard Oil as he tried to supply Russian oil on international markets. In 1889, the Comptoir d&#x27;Escompte de Paris bank went into receivership and shortly thereafter the Panama scandals erupted, culminating in an official enquiry into the matter conducted in 1893 by the French parliament.

His intense pressure pushed back the abrogation project of the &quot;décret Crémieux&quot; filed by the chief of the provisional government, Adolphe Thiers in 1871.

Already made a member of the Legion of Honor, for his contributions to the French economy at a time of crisis, in 1896 Alphonse de Rothschild was elevated to the Grand Cross, the highest class of the Legion of Honor.

==Thoroughbred racing==
Alphonse de Rothschild was an enthusiastic supporter of thoroughbred horse racing who in 1852 at the age of twenty-four became a member of the Paris Jockey Club. He eventually purchased a rural property near Touques, Calvados in the Lower Normandy region where he built the Haras de Meautry horse breeding farm. There, he laid the foundation for a breeding operation that would prove highly successful for more than one hundred years and one that under the guidance of his descendants remains in operation today. Alphonse de Rothschild raced in an era before the creation of the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe. Among the major races which his horses won were:
*Grand Prix de Paris - (1) - &quot;Le Roi Soleil (1898)&quot;
*Prix de Diane - (3) - &quot;Brie (1878), Crinière (1889) Brisk (1894)&quot;
*Poule d&#x27;Essai des Poulains - (3) - &quot;Brio (1887), Heaume (1890) et Le Nicham II (1893)&quot;
*Prix du Jockey Club - (2) - &quot;Kilt (1876) Heaume (1890)&quot;
*Prix de la Forêt - (2) - &quot;Kilt (1876) Le Nord (1891)&quot;
*Prix Morny - (4) - &quot;Louis d&#x27;Or (1879), Strelitz (1880), Fresca (1893) Thélème (1903)&quot;

==As an art collector==
Over his lifetime Alphonse de Rothschild put together a massive collection of artworks. He was an avid collector of the Dutch Masters as well as an important assembler of Islamic works of art. In 1885 he was made a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts and would donate and/or bequeath approximately 2,000 pieces to many different museums.

==Residences==
As part of his father&#x27;s estate, Alphonse de Rothschild inherited a large residence in Paris at 2 rue Saint-Florentin on Place de la Concorde which today is part of the American Embassy complex. In addition, he also received the Château de Ferrières, an enormous mansion and woodlands in the country about 26 km east of Paris.

==Assassination attempt==
In August 1895, a crude letter bomb addressed to Alphonse de Rothschild was delivered to his Paris residence. Not at home, a member of the house staff had it forwarded to the de Rothschild Frères offices where it detonated, seriously injuring the chief clerk.

On his death in 1905, Alphonse&#x27;s son Edouard took over as head of the family business.

<doc id="683178" wikidata="Q1538093" url="?curid=683178" title="Wolf River (Tennessee)">
<text>The Wolf River is a alluvial river in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi, whose confluence with the Mississippi River was the site of various Chickasaw, French, Spanish and American communities that eventually became Memphis, Tennessee. It is estimated to be about 12,000 years old, formed by glacier runoff carving into the region&#x27;s soft alluvial soil. It should not be confused with The Wolf River (Middle Tennessee) which flows primarily in Middle Tennessee and southern Kentucky. The Wolf River rises in the Holly Springs National Forest at Baker&#x27;s Pond in Benton County, Mississippi, and flows northwest into Tennessee, before entering the Mississippi River north of downtown Memphis.

In 1985, the Wolf River Conservancy was formed in opposition to plans for additional channel dredging. In 1995 the &quot;Ghost River&quot; section of the Wolf was saved from timber auction by a coordinated effort of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, local conservation activists, and the Wolf River Conservancy. In 1997 the river was designated an American Heritage River by presidential proclamation under a special United States Environmental Protection Agency program. In that same year, musician Jeff Buckley accidentally drowned in the Wolf River while swimming in Memphis. In 2005 the Wolf River Restoration Project was commenced to stop rapid erosion at Collierville, Tennessee. The river serves to mitigate flooding and erosion, as habitat for wildlife, as a recreational area, as well as supplying clean water to an underground aquifer.


==Hydrography==
The Wolf River rises in the Holly Springs National Forest at Baker&#x27;s Pond in Benton County, Mississippi, north of Ashland, and flows northwest into Tennessee, draining a large portion of Memphis and northern and eastern Shelby County, Tennessee, before entering the Mississippi River near the northern end of Mud Island, north of downtown Memphis.

==Wildlife==
The Wolf River area is home to deer, otter, mink, bobcat, fox, coyote, wild turkey, and a wide variety of waterfowl, reptiles, amphibians, and aquatic life. Migrating osprey, great egret, and bald eagle have been spotted along this river as well.

There are Tennessee state record trees located in its bottomland forests, including a Tupelo Gum that is in circumference. Other hardwoods include green ash, red maple, swamp chestnut oak, blackgum, and the majestic bald cypress. Native flowering plants include cardinal flower, ironweed, swamp iris, false loosestrife, spatterdock, swamp rose, blue phlox and spring cress.

Twenty-five species of freshwater mussels (&quot;unionidae&quot;) have been documented. Their dependence on good water quality makes them vulnerable to pollution.

A growing number of these species of plants and animals can be found in the urban reaches of the Wolf in Memphis, as the legacy of community action and the Clean Water Act slowly heals the degraded downstream section.

On 27 March 2018, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) reported that its personnel had videoed a alligator at the Wolf River Wildlife Management Area in Fayette County, Tennessee, one in a series of confirmed recent sightings of the reptile in West Tennessee. The reptiles are moving into Tennessee across its southern state line; TWRA has not stocked alligators in Tennessee.

==History==
Wolf River is a alluvial stream in western Tennessee and northern Mississippi, whose confluence with the Mississippi River was the site of various Chickasaw, French, Spanish and American communities and forts that eventually became Memphis, Tennessee. 
The Wolf River is estimated to be about 12,000 years old, formed by glacier runoff carving the region&#x27;s soft alluvial soil. It is one of many rivers in West Tennessee and Mississippi that prompted the Chickasaw to call the region &quot;the land that leaks.&quot;

About 400 AD, a massive seismic event in the Ellendale Fault (part of the New Madrid Fault system) raised a low ridge across present-day east Memphis, diverting Nonconnah Creek away from the Wolf, causing it to flow directly into the Mississippi River several miles south of the Wolf&#x27;s mouth. The lowermost section of the Nonconnah that continued to flow into the Wolf eventually became known as Cypress Creek.

The Mississippian culture thrived in this area until about the 16th century, as evidenced by mound sites and accounts by Hernando de Soto. Shortly afterwards, the Chickasaw nation settled northern Mississippi, western Tennessee, and eastern Arkansas.

In 1682, French explorer Robert Cavelier de La Salle claimed the region near the mouth of the Wolf River. The French alternately called the river Rivière de Mayot (or Margot), Blackbird River, and Rivière du Loup. The original Loup was rumored to be a Mahican Indian guide who disappeared along the river while guiding the French. The Mahicans were also known as &quot;Les Loups&quot; or &quot;The Wolves.&quot; According to one account, both the English and Chickasaw afterwards called the river &quot;Loup&quot; in their respective languages: &quot;Wolf&quot; and &quot;Nashoba.&quot;

During a multi-river voyage from Chicago, Illinois, to Biloxi, Mississippi, Jesuit priest Jacques Gravier made the following journal entry for 26 October 1700, after reaching the mouth of the Wolf:

We passed the Riviere a Mayot [Wolf] on the south, from the name of a savage of the Mahican nation who was of Mr. de la Salle&#x27;s party. This river does not seem to be very large, but is said to be a good hunting ground, and that the Chickacha come to its mouth, from which they are only three days‚ journey, cutting south inland.

Concerned about American activities in their territory along the east bank of the Mississippi River, the Spanish colonial government erected Fort San Fernando de las Barrancas in 1795 near the Chickasaw Bluffs at the mouth of the Wolf River. The fort was dismantled in 1797 in accordance with Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty.

Spanish documents referred to the river as Las Casas.


In the early 19th century, the Wolf River was declared navigable, from Memphis to La Grange, by the Tennessee General Assembly, which appropriated funds to remove obstructions for keel boat travel. In 1888, Memphis stopped using the Wolf River as its principal source of drinking water, switching to artesian wells, which are still used and which are replenished by the Wolf&#x27;s watershed.

Because of its foul odor, the Wolf was dammed in 1960 near its mouth and diverted into the Mississippi north of Mud Island. The section of the Wolf downstream of this channel diversion became a slackwater harbor of the Mississippi known today as Wolf River Harbor, which separates Mud Island (actually a peninsula) from the Memphis &quot;mainland.&quot; Completion of channelization of the Wolf from the Mississippi upstream to Gray&#x27;s Creek, east of Germantown, Tennessee, resulted in a lowered riverbed and diminished wetland habitat. In 1970, surface drainage, sewage, and industrial pollution caused a group of scientists and environmentalists to pronounce the river &quot;dead&quot; around Memphis.

In 1977 Mary Winslow Chapman published &quot;I Remember Raleigh,&quot; which included vivid descriptions of a pre-channelized Wolf River.
In 1985, the Wolf River Conservancy was founded by an alliance of conservation-minded real estate executives and local environmental advocates, united in opposition to plans for additional channel dredging. In 1995 the &quot;Ghost River&quot; section of the Wolf was saved from timber auction by a coordinated effort of the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, local conservation activists Lucius Burch and W.S. &quot;Babe&quot; Howard, and the Wolf River Conservancy. The Ghost River section is located at: .

In 1997 the river was designated an American Heritage River by presidential proclamation under a special United States Environmental Protection Agency program. In that same year musician Jeff Buckley accidentally drowned in the Wolf River while swimming in Memphis.

In 2005 the Wolf River Restoration Project was commenced by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Memphis Office to stop rapid erosion known as &quot;headcutting&quot; at Collierville, Tennessee.

In 2007 the &quot;Middle Wolf&quot; Campaign attempted sprawl-proofing of the western Fayette County section. Completion of the Collierville-Arlington Parkway segment of Tenn-385 and I-269 outer loop expressway, including two (and potentially five) interchanges poised to become major drivers of suburban growth into forested sections of the Wolf River&#x27;s floodplain and the surface-exposed sections of the Memphis Sands aquifer.

==Identified public benefits==
According to the Wolf River Conservancy, the Wolf River serves the Mid-South in four distinct ways:

* Flood/Erosion Control: During heavy rains, the Wolf&#x27;s floodplain and wetlands temporarily store floodwaters. When these are filled in for development, the river loses these natural release valves, causing increases in river velocity and flood height. Without an adequate floodplain, floodwaters and the erosion caused by them threaten property, transportation, and lives.
* Water Quality: The Memphis metropolitan area and other Mid-South communities receive drinking water from a pure underground aquifer beneath the Wolf River Basin. The Wolf&#x27;s fragile wetlands hold water long enough for it to be absorbed into the ground and serve as natural filters to cleanse polluted waters before they reach the aquifer.
* Wildlife Habitat: The Wolf River supports a variety of animals and waterfowl. Migrating osprey, great egret, and bald eagle have been spotted along the river as well.
* Low-Impact Recreation: While civilization has long surrounded the Wolf River&#x27;s floodplain, its wetland and bottomland trails provide Mid-Southerners with scenic wilderness experiences from the Holly Springs National Forest all the way to downtown Memphis. Hikers, runners, sportsmen, cyclists and paddlers experience nature on or near the river every day.

<text>Zlín Region () is an administrative unit () of the Czech Republic, located in the south-eastern part of the historical region of Moravia. It is named after its capital Zlín. Together with the Olomouc Region it forms a cohesion area of Central Moravia. It is located in the eastern part of the Czech Republic, where the borders with Slovakia (Trenčín and Žilina Regions) are formed by its eastern edge. It borders the South Moravian Region in the southwest, the Olomouc Region in the northwest and the Moravian-Silesian Region in the north. Culturally, the region is composed of parts of three traditional Moravian regions: Haná, the Moravian Slovakia and the Moravian Wallachia, as the city of Zlín lies roughly at their tripoint.

==Administrative divisions==
The Zlín Region is divided into 4 districts:
The Zlín Region was established on 1 January 2000 on the basis of the constitutional act No. 347 from 3 December 1997 on foundation of higher self-governing units. It was formed by a merger of parts of Jihomoravský Region (the Zlín District, the Kroměříž District and the Uherské Hradiště District), and the Severomoravský Region (the Vsetín District. The region has in total 307 municipalities of which 30 are towns. There are 13 municipalities with extended powers and 25 territorial districts of municipalities with authorized municipal office.
According to government statistics, the Zlín Region is the safest region in the Czech Republic; it has the lowest number of assaults, rapes, suicides and road accidents in the country.

==Geography==
With its area of 3,964 km2, Zlín Region is the fourth smallest region of the Czech Republic. The character of the region&#x27;s territory is very diverse. While parts of the region are hilly, flat fertile areas of Haná and Slovácko stretch in the Kroměříž District and the Uherské Hradiště District. The Moravian-Silesian Beskids with its highest peak Čertův mlýn mountain (1,206 m) is situated in the northern part of the region and the Maple Mountains mountain range with its highest peak of Velký Javorník (1,071 m) is located in the east. Towards the south, forming the border with Slovakia, there is the White Carpathians mountain range (in Czech: Bílé Karpaty) with its highest mountain of Velká Javořina (970 m). The Hostýn-Vsetín Mountains and Vizovice Highlands pass south of the Moravian-Silesian Beskids mountain range. On the south-western part of the region, there are the Chřiby highlands with the highest point Brdo (587 m). The Upper Morava Valley passes through from the west among the highlands of Chřiby highlands and above mentioned hilly countries through the Kroměříž District up to the Zlín District. The Lower Morava Valley passes through along the Morava River in the Uherské Hradiště District to South Moravian Region.

Most of the streams in the area flow to Morava River. The most important ones are the Bečva River in the northern part and the Olšava River in the southern part. The Morava River is the biggest river of the Region flowing through both the vales from west to the south.

The region&#x27;s climate is rather favourable. The average temperature of air was 9.8 °C in 2012 and the total amount of precipitation was 598.6 mm/m2.

Most of the soils in the region are poor in minerals (with the exception of potassium and magnesium) and humus. These are the brown earth of the highlands and the podzolic soils that locally pass to brown earth of the lower locations towards the south. In the vales, there are very fertile brown earth and chernozem. High-quality floodplain soils surround the Morava River. It is rather difficult to cultivate soil in a large part of the Region due to the steep land and variety of the terrain.

==History==
Regional representatives voted in 2001 on a proposed name change to the region. The alternative &quot;&quot; (&quot;East Moravian Region&quot;) was proposed, however a majority of voters elected to retain the region&#x27;s existing name.

==Population==

<doc id="683190" wikidata="Q1402038" url="?curid=683190" title="Tuisto">
<text>According to Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; (AD 98), Tuisto (or Tuisco) is the legendary divine ancestor of the Germanic peoples. The figure remains the subject of some scholarly discussion, largely focused upon etymological connections and comparisons to figures in later (particularly Norse) Germanic mythology.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Germania&quot; manuscript corpus contains two primary variant readings of the name. The most frequently occurring, Tuisto, is commonly connected to the Proto-Germanic root &quot;*twai&quot; – &quot;two&quot; and its derivative &quot;*twis&quot; – &quot;twice&quot; or &quot;doubled&quot;, thus giving Tuisto the core meaning &quot;double&quot;. Any assumption of a gender inference is entirely conjectural, as the tvia / tvis roots are also the roots of any number of other concepts / words in the Germanic languages. Take for instance the Germanic &quot;twist&quot;, which, in all but the English has the primary meaning of &quot;dispute / conflict&quot;.

The second variant of the name, occurring originally in manuscript &quot;E&quot;, reads Tuisco. One proposed etymology for this variant reconstructs a Proto-Germanic &quot;*tiwisko&quot; and connects this with Proto-Germanic &quot;*Tiwaz&quot;, giving the meaning &quot;son of Tiu&quot;. This interpretation would thus make Tuisco the son of the sky-god (Proto-Indo-European *&quot;Dyeus&quot;) and the earth-goddess.

===Tuisto, Tvastar, and Ymir===
Connections have been proposed between the 1st-century figure of Tuisto and the primeval being Ymir in later Norse mythology, attested in 13th-century sources, based upon etymological and functional similarity. Meyer (1907) sees the connection as so strong, that he considers the two to be identical. Lindow (2001), while mindful of the possible semantic connection between Tuisto and Ymir, notes an essential functional difference: while Ymir is portrayed as an &quot;essentially ... negative figure&quot; – Tuisto is described as being &quot;celebrated&quot; (&quot;celebrant&quot;) by the early Germanic peoples in song, with Tacitus reporting nothing negative about Tuisto.

Jacob (2005) attempts to establish a genealogical relationship between Tuisto and Ymir based on etymology and a comparison with Vedic Indian mythology: as Tvastr, through his daughter Saranyū and her husband Vivaswān, is said to have been the grandfather of the twins Yama and Yami, so Jacob argues that the Germanic Tuisto (assuming a connection with Tvastr) must originally have been the grandfather of Ymir (cognate to Yama). Incidentally, Indian mythology also places Manu (cognate to Germanic Mannus), the Vedic progenitor of mankind, as a son of Vivaswān, thus making him the brother of Yama/Ymir.

==Attestation==
Tacitus relates that &quot;ancient songs&quot; (Latin &quot;carminibus antiquis&quot;) of the Germanic peoples celebrated Tuisto as &quot;a god, born of the earth&quot; (&quot;deum terra editum&quot;). These songs further attributed to him a son, Mannus, who in turn had three sons, the offspring of whom were referred to as Ingaevones, Herminones and Istaevones, living near the Ocean (&quot;proximi Oceano&quot;), in the interior (&quot;medii&quot;), and the remaining parts (&quot;ceteri&quot;) of the geographical region of Germania, respectively.

==Theories and interpretations==

Tacitus&#x27;s report falls squarely within the ethnographic tradition of the classical world, which often fused anthropogony, ethnogony, and together into a synthetic whole. The succession of father-son-three sons parallels occurs in both Germanic and non-Germanic Indo-European areas. The essential characteristics of the myth have been theorized as ultimately originating in Proto-Indo-European society around 2,000 BCE.

According to Rives (1999), the fact that the ancient Germanic peoples claimed descent from an earth-born god was used by Tacitus to support his contention that they were an indigenous population: the Latin word was often used in the same sense as the Greek , meaning literally &#x27;[born from] the land itself&#x27;. Lindauer (1975) notes that although this claim is to be judged as one made out of simple ignorance of the facts on the part of Tacitus, he was not entirely wrong, as he made the judgement based on a comparison with the relatively turbulent Mediterranean region of his day.

The name &quot;Tuisto&quot; is also given as &quot;Tuitsch&quot; or &quot;Teutsch&quot; in its alternative versions and made to derive from the same founding figure called &quot;Tuisco&quot; (merely as alternate spellings of the same name) who was claimed to have led the Germans from the incident of the Tower of Babel into Europe and from whom the Germans themselves derived their name: and as a consequence that of their land.

==Later influence==
In 1498, a monk named Annio da Viterbo published fragments known as &quot;Pseudo-Berossus&quot;, now considered a forgery, claiming that Babylonian records had shown that Tuiscon or Tuisto, the fourth son of Noah, had been the first ruler of Scythia and Germany following the dispersion of peoples, with him being succeeded by his son Mannus as the second king. Later historians (e.g. Johannes Aventinus) managed to furnish numerous further details, including the assertion by James Anderson that this Tuiscon was in fact none other than the biblical Ashkenaz, son of Gomer.

<text>Jarbidge is an unincorporated community in Elko County, Nevada, United States. Located at the bottom of the Jarbidge River&#x27;s canyon near the north end of the Jarbidge Mountains, it lies within the Jarbidge Ranger District of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest and is near the northwest edge of the Jarbidge Wilderness, approximately south of the Idaho–Nevada border.

Jarbidge, along with the rest of Nevada except for the city of West Wendover, is legally in the Pacific Time Zone, but, along with other Idaho border towns such as Jackpot, Mountain City and Owyhee, unofficially observes the Mountain Time Zone due to closer proximity to and greater connections with towns in southern Idaho. Jarbidge is popular locally with hunters and campers with many campsites available in the area and high populations of elk.

==History==
&quot;Jarbidge&quot; is a name derived from the Shoshone language meaning &quot;devil&quot;. Natives believed the nearby hills were haunted.

Gold was discovered near Jarbidge in 1909, making it the site of one of the last gold rushes in the Old West and, incidentally, was the site of the last stagecoach robbery in 1916. Its population swelled to near 2,000 in 1911; however, it began a slow decline thereafter, when the mining facilities were largely cannibalized for the war effort during World War I. Mining operations ceased completely in 1932. However, in 2013 permits for the removal of the gold were re-issued and the mine is reopening.

Jazz musician Ralph Peña was born in Jarbidge in 1927.

==Geography==
Noted locally for its extreme remoteness, no paved roads exist within almost of Jarbidge. The community is usually and most easily accessed using a motor vehicle by way of Three Creek Road, which originates along U.S. Route 93 in Rogerson, Twin Falls County, Idaho; the final of this route are unimproved but usually open all year. From Elko, the easiest access is by proceeding north along Nevada State Route 225, then east along Elko County Road 746, the North Fork-Charleston Road (signed for Charleston and Jarbidge), and finally north along Elko County Road 748, the Charleston-Jarbidge Road. The latter two segments of this route are unimproved, at points, present serious road hazards, and receive no winter maintenance. They are often closed from as early as October or November to as late as June or July due to heavy snowfall.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Jarbidge has a warm-summer mediterranean continental climate, abbreviated &quot;Dsb&quot; on climate maps. The hottest temperature recorded in Jarbidge was on July 14, 2002, while the coldest temperature recorded was on December 22, 1990.

<doc id="683194" wikidata="Q192702" url="?curid=683194" title="Ústí nad Labem Region">
<text>Ústí nad Labem Region or Ústecký Region () is an administrative unit () of the Czech Republic, located in the north-western part of the historical land of Bohemia, and named after the capital, Ústí nad Labem. It covers the majority of the former North Bohemia province () and is part of the broader area of North Bohemia.

The region borders the regions of Liberec (east), Central Bohemia (south), Plzeň (southwest), Karlovy Vary (west) and the German region of Saxony to the north.

The Ústí nad Labem Region comprises a range of very different types of landscape. Between the high escarpment of the Ore Mountains range and the Bohemian Central Uplands with many volcanic hills, there are vast areas devastated by surface coal mining (the Most Basin), partly being recultivated into an artificial landscape with ponds, plains and groves. The Elbe river runs through the Central Uplands in a winding gorge of the Porta Bohemica. The southern part of the region, Polabí, is flat and fertile, while in the northeast are the sandstone formations of Bohemian Switzerland, including the monumental Pravčická brána, a natural sandstone arch.

The geographical location of the area, between Prague and Germany, has been a significant factor in the region&#x27;s development.

==Administrative divisions==
The Ústí nad Labem Region is divided into 7 districts:
The districts are further subdivided into 16 administrative district of municipalities with extended competence.

==Population==
, the region had 820,789 inhabitants, the fifth most populous in the Czech Republic. The population density is higher than the national average, and the region is the fourth most densely populated in the country. The most densely populated areas of the region are the areas on the brown coal basin while areas with a lower population density are the Ore Mountains and the Louny District and Litoměřice District, which predominantly contain smaller country settlements. The largest municipality is Ústí nad Labem, the region&#x27;s seat, with 92,952 inhabitants.

The Ústí nad Labem region has the third youngest population; the average age is 42.0 years. The Ústí nad Labem Region ranks second-highest in the Czech Republic in the number of live births per 1,000 inhabitants, alongside the Liberec Region (11.5), but also has one of the highest mortality rates (10.6 deaths per 1,000 inhabitants). The Ústí nad Labem Region ranks second nationally in the number of divorces per 1,000 inhabitants (3.4) and first in the number of abortions per 100 live births (47.5).

The region has 46 cities and towns, in which 80.7% of its inhabitants reside, and 354 villages. 54% of the region&#x27;s villages have a population greater than 500, but only 5.8% of the region&#x27;s inhabitants live there.

The composition of the population according to nationality is:
*Czech: 92.12%
*Slovak: 2.71%
*German: 1.25%
*Romani: 0.23%
*Polish: 0.2%
*Moravian: 0.13%
*Other: 3.45%

===Cities and towns===
The table shows cities and towns in the region that had more than 10,000 inhabitants (as of 1 January 2024). The five cities in the region belongs to the Ústí nad Labem-Chomutov agglomeration.

Other significant towns and villages of the Ústí nad Labem Region
* Česká Kamenice;
* Lovosice;
* Račice, international rowing and flatwater canoeing venue;
* Srbská Kamenice, site of JAT Yugoslav Flight 364 crash in 1972;
* Štětí;
* Terezín, a former military fortress.

==Geography==

The total area of the region is 5,335 km2, 6.8% of the territory of the Czech Republic. The region&#x27;s geography is very diverse.

The area along the German borders is dominated by the Ore Mountains, the Elbe Sandstone Mountains and the Lusatian Mountains. The Ore Mountains are very old and formed of volcanic rocks or Palaeozoic schist.

In contrast, the south-eastern part of the region is formed by the plains that originate from Mesozoic era (Czech Cretaceous Formation, ). The Bohemian Central Uplands and Říp Mountain (which is, according to legend, associated with the earliest Czech ancestors arriving in Bohemia) are both located in this area. The Bohemian Central Uplands originated from volcanic activity in the Tertiary.

The highest point of the region (1225 m) lies on the hillside of Klínovec, which is the highest peak of the Ore Mountains. However, the top of the mountain is located in the territory of the Karlovy Vary Region. Not taking into account the bottoms of surface mines, the lowest point of the region, and the whole country, is the surface of the Elbe River at Hřensko, at 115 metres above sea level .

The Elbe River is the largest watercourse in the region. Other main rivers in the region include Ohře, Bílina, Ploučnice and Kamenice, all tributaries of the Elbe. The largest water area is the Nechranice reservoir built on the Ohře River in the western part of the region. The region also contains a number of mineral and thermal springs.

==Economy==

In 2010, the region&#x27;s gross domestic product accounted for 6.6% of the national GDP. The regional GDP per capita was 83.4% of the national average. The regional employment is approximately 362,000 people. In 2013, the average wage in the region was CZK 22,172 (EUR 870). The unemployment rate was 11%.

The Ústecký Region is one of the most industrialized areas in Central Europe. The economy used to be based on metallurgy and the chemical industry, though is now more diverse. The region&#x27;s traditional branches of industry are chemicals and petrochemicals, engineering and thermal energy. Historically, the economic importance of the Ústí nad Labem Region lay in its reserves of raw materials, especially deposits of brown coal, quality glass and foundry sands and building stone. The brown coal basin stretches under the hillsides of the Ore Mountains from Ústí nad Labem to Kadaň.

The region is part of the Black Triangle, an area of heavily industrialization and environmental damage on the three-way border of Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic.

The region contains a number of distinct economic regions. An area with highly developed industrial production is concentrated in the foothills of the Ore Mountains (the Chomutov, Most, and Teplice Districts, and part of the Ústí nad Labem District). Important economic sectors include the energy industry, coal mining, mechanical engineering, and chemical and glass industry. The area around Litoměřice and Louny is known for the production of hops and vegetables. The areas along the Elbe River and Ohře River are well-known fruit growing regions and are sometimes referred to as the Garden of Bohemia. Recently, the area around Most has become known as a wine-growing region, in which wine is grown mainly on lands that were reclaimed after brown coal mining. The sparsely-populated area of the Ore Mountains has limited economic activities. Similarly, the area of Děčín is neither a heavy industrial nor an agricultural area.

In recent years the region has been experiencing an influx of foreign investment in various sectors, including the automotive, chemical, engineering, electrical engineering and food industries. The focus is shifting towards light industry and is becoming more environmentally friendly.

Among the largest employers of the region are coal-mining companies Mostecká uhelná společnost and Severočeské doly, Chemopetrol (a petrochemical company), and Krajská zdravotní, a.s. (a healthcare provider).

Agricultural land covers nearly 52% of the region’s area, forests 30% and water areas 2%. Agricultural production is focused on hops, fruits and vegetables.

===Transportation===
Ústí nad Labem Region is crossed by railway lines connecting Berlin via Prague to Vienna or Budapest, as well as the Elbe water way. The region is also crossed by the D8 motorway, which connects Prague with the German border, and the I/13, connecting Karlovy Vary with Chomutov, Most, Teplice, Ústí nad Labem, Děčín and Liberec.

<doc id="683195" wikidata="Q7726978" url="?curid=683195" title="The Commercial Appeal">
<text>The Commercial Appeal (also known as the Memphis Commercial Appeal) is a daily newspaper of Memphis, Tennessee, and its surrounding metropolitan area. It is owned by the Gannett Company; its former owner, the E. W. Scripps Company, also owned the former afternoon paper, the &quot;Memphis Press-Scimitar&quot;, which it folded in 1983. The 2016 purchase by Gannett of Journal Media Group (Scripps&#x27; direct successor) effectively gave it control of the two major papers in western and central Tennessee, uniting the &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; with Nashville&#x27;s &quot;The Tennessean&quot;.

&quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; is a seven-day morning paper. It is distributed primarily in Greater Memphis, including Shelby, Fayette, and Tipton counties in Tennessee; DeSoto, Tate, and Tunica counties in Mississippi; and in Crittenden County in Arkansas. These are the contiguous counties to the city of Memphis.

&quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; won the 1923 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for its opposition of the Ku Klux Klan&#x27;s operations in the region. In 1994, the newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning by Michael Ramirez.

==History==
The paper&#x27;s name comes from a 19th-century merger between two predecessors, the &quot;Memphis Commercial&quot; and the &quot;Appeal&quot;.

===&quot;The Appeal&quot;===
&quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; traces its heritage to the 1839 publication, &quot;The Western World &amp; Memphis Banner of the Constitution&quot;. Bought by Col. Henry Van Pelt in 1840, it was renamed &quot;The Memphis Appeal&quot;. During the American Civil War the &quot;Appeal&quot; was one of the major newspapers serving the Southern cause, and its editor Benjamin Dill was one of the most wanted confederates of the war. On June 6, 1862, the presses and plates were loaded into a boxcar and published from Grenada, Mississippi. The &quot;Appeal&quot; later journeyed on to Jackson, Mississippi, Meridian, Mississippi, Atlanta, Georgia, Montgomery, Alabama and finally Columbus, Georgia, where the plates were destroyed on April 16, 1865, temporarily halting publication days before the Confederate surrender. The press was hidden and saved, and publication resumed in Memphis, using it, on November 5, 1865.

===History===
Another early paper, &quot;The Avalanche&quot;, was incorporated in 1894, publishing as &quot;The Appeal-Avalanche&quot; until an 1894 merger created &quot;The Commercial Appeal.&quot; The name is properly &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; and not the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot; as it is often called, although the predecessor &quot;Appeal&quot; was formally the &quot;Memphis Daily Appeal&quot;. From the late 19th century through the first quarter of the 20th century, &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; was led by editor C. P. J. Mooney, &quot;tireless, combative and a devoutly Catholic teetotaler&quot;.

In 1932, the newspaper moved into a disused Ford Motor Company assembly plant at 495 Union Avenue, where it stayed until 1977, when a new building was completed adjacent.

In 1936, &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; was purchased by the Scripps Howard newspaper chain. Its sister afternoon paper, the &quot;Press-Scimitar&quot;, was discontinued in 1983.

&quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; was folded into the Journal Media Group by successor E. W. Scripps Company in 2015 after Scripps purchased Milwaukee&#x27;s Journal Communications and chose to spin off its newspaper assets to expand its broadcasting operations. Gannett then purchased Journal Media Group several months later, taking control of the &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; in April 2016. Gannett then closed the &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot;″s Memphis printing plant after taking control, laying off 19 full-time employees, with the paper then printed at Gannett&#x27;s existing newspaper in nearby Jackson, the &quot;Sun&quot;. The company&#x27;s west Tennessee printing operations then were consolidated out-of-state in February 2021, when the plant for Jackson, Mississippi&#x27;s &quot;The Clarion-Ledger&quot; began to print the &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; and &quot;Sun&quot;.

===Sale of real estate assets===
In April 2018, &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; sold its longtime offices and plant at 495 Union Avenue in Memphis for $3.8 million, indicating plans to move to another Memphis site. At the time of sale, the property, comprised a 125,000-square-foot office building, a 150,000-square-foot printing and production plant, and adjacent real estate. A New York-based real estate company, Twenty Lake Holdings LLC, bought the 6.5 acres with the five-story office building and attached printing/production building. Twenty Lake Holdings is a division of a hedge fund that has been accused of a &quot;mercenary strategy&quot; of buying newspapers, slashing jobs, and selling the buildings and other assets.

===Columnists===
The paper in the 1940s had a well known columnist named Paul Flowers who wrote &quot;The Greenhouse&quot; column.

Lydel Sims was a columnist for the &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; from 1949 until his death in 1995.

===Civil rights===
&quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; has had a mixed record on civil rights. In 1868, it published an article by former confederate general Albert Pike that was critical of the methods of the Ku Klux Klan, but lauded their aims of white supremacy. In 1917, the paper published the scheduled time and place for the upcoming Lynching of Ell Persons.

Despite its Confederate background the paper won a Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for its coverage and editorial opposition to the resurgent Ku Klux Klan.

From 1916 to 1968, the paper published a cartoon called &quot;Hambone&#x27;s Meditations&quot;. The cartoon featured a black man, Hambone, that many African Americans came to regard as a racist caricature.

During the Civil Rights Movement, the paper generally avoided coverage of the topic. It did take a stance against pro-segregation rioters during the Ole Miss riot of 1962. However, its owner, Scripps-Howard, exerted a generally conservative and anti-union influence.

The paper opposed the Memphis sanitation strike, portraying both labor organizers and Martin Luther King Jr. as outside meddlers.

During the late 1960s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) leaked &quot;information of a derogatory nature regarding the Invaders and other black nationalist militants,&quot; some of which may have been fabricated by the FBI itself, to a &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; reporter who then used that information to write articles critical of the Invaders. This manipulation of &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; was part of the FBI&#x27;s counterintelligence program (COINTELPRO) against black nationalists in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

===Monetization controversy===

In the fall of 2007, the &quot;Appeal&quot; attempted to launch a native advertising effort that would have linked specific stories to specific advertisers who paid for what would be considered an advertorial. The proposal was greeted by outrage among media analysts, so the authors of the so-called &quot;monetization memo&quot;—the &quot;Appeal&quot;″s editor and its sales manager—quietly withdrew the effort.

===Guns database===
At the end of 2008, &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; posted a controversial database listing Tennessee residents with permits to carry handguns. The database is a public record in Tennessee but had not been posted online. After a permit-to-carry holder shot and killed a man in Memphis for parking too close to his SUV and vandalizing it, the gun database suddenly came to the attention of pro-gun groups, including the NRA and the Tennessee Firearms Association. Legislators who supported gun groups quickly drafted a bill to close the permit-to-carry database. The Tennessee Coalition for Open Government lobbied to keep the database public and the bill to close the database did not pass in the 2009 legislative session.

In a February 15, 2009 editorial, the newspaper defended publication of the handgun permit list and suggested it could protect permit holders by steering criminals away from armed households. An independent study released in 2011 found &quot;[Memphis] ZIP Codes with the highest concentration of permits experienced roughly 1.7 fewer burglaries per week/per ZIP Code in the 15 weeks following the publicization of the database, and those with the lowest concentration experienced on average 1.5 more burglaries.&quot;

The &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; website for the database currently notes that on April 25, 2013, a law was signed that classified information contained in handgun carry permit applications as &quot;confidential&quot; available only to the court or to law enforcement. The State Attorney General did not restrict publication of existing copies of the database; the &quot;Commercial Appeal&quot; has indicated that it will maintain its April 19, 2013 updated database &quot;until the newspaper determines the information is too outdated and no longer serves the public&#x27;s interests.&quot;

<doc id="683202" wikidata="Q2567489" url="?curid=683202" title="Wichita Thunder">
<text>The Wichita Thunder are a minor league hockey team based in Wichita, Kansas. The team played in the Central Hockey League from 1992 until 2014, and then in the ECHL since the 2014–15 season. From 1992 until December 2009, the Thunder played in the Britt Brown Arena located in the northern Wichita suburb of Park City. In January 2010 (the second half of the 2009–10 season), the team began playing its home games at the newly built Intrust Bank Arena. The Thunder are currently the ECHL affiliate of the San Jose Sharks.

==Franchise history==

===Central Hockey League===
The Thunder was one of the first six original teams of the second iteration of the Central Hockey League, along with the Oklahoma City Blazers, Tulsa Oilers, Memphis RiverKings, Dallas Freeze and the Fort Worth Fire. Wichita played its first home game at Britt Brown Arena on November 4, 1992, in front of a crowd of 5,486. In the same season, the Thunder had its first sellout in team history when the crowd of 9,686 fans watched the Thunder defeat Oklahoma City 4–3.

The Thunder was originally coached by Gary Fay, but after a 6–20 start, he was replaced by Doug Shedden. The season was quickly turned around by Shedden, and it finished its first season with a 25–32–2 record. On April 5, 1993, the Thunder goaltender Robert Desjardins was named the first CHL Rookie of the Year. In the following two seasons, the Thunder was the regular season champion (Adams Cup) and playoff champion (William Levins Memorial Cup). Ron Handy was the Playoff Most Valuable Player for both seasons and was the only player in Central Hockey League history to win the award on multiple occasions. In the 1993–94 season, Doug Shedden won the Coach of the Year award, Robert Desjardins won the Regular Season Most Valuable Player award and Paul Jackson won the Scoring Champion award.

On May 14, 1995, Shedden resigned to become coach of the Louisiana IceGators of the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). Don Jackson was hired as the new head coach on July 21, 1995. He led the Thunder to a 22–39–3 record and missed the playoffs for the second time in franchise history. On July 19, 1996, Jackson resigned to become head coach of the Kansas City Blades of the International Hockey League (IHL). Jackson was replaced by Bryan Wells to become the Thunder&#x27;s fourth head coach in franchise history. Wells went on to coach the Thunder for five seasons, making the playoffs in four out of the five seasons he coached. On May 2, 2001, Wells was dismissed as head coach.

After the dismissal of Wells, the Thunder announced that James Latos would be the new head coach. In Latos&#x27; first season coaching, the team went 24–34–6 and was out of the playoffs. Latos was fired the following season after a disappointing start of 8–19–7. Five days after his dismissal, the Thunder announced that Derek Laxdal would become the team&#x27;s new head coach. Laxdal went on to coach the Thunder for two seasons to an 87–58–8 record while securing two separate playoff places. On August 3, 2005, Laxdal announced his resignation to become the head coach of the ECHL&#x27;s Idaho Steelheads.

Mark French took over as head coach from 2005 to 2007. During his tenure, he compiled a record of 70–59–16. He was fired mid-season in December 2007 with a 4–13 record. He went on to become the assistant coach of the AHL&#x27;s Hershey Bears and the following season took them to a championship as head coach. The Thunder then named former player Rob Weingartner to lead the team. Weingartner played for the Thunder from 1992 to 1996 when he was a member of two championship teams. Weingartner compiled a record of 16–29–2 during his tenure. He has since become the head coach of the Western States Hockey League&#x27;s Wichita Jr. Thunder.

Brent Bilodeau was hired during the 2008 off-season and led the team for two seasons and a record of 22–48–0. He was fired early in his second season and became the assistant coach of the Western Hockey League&#x27;s Tri-City Americans for two seasons. After the Thunder fired Bilodeau nine games into the 2009–10 season, Jason Duda was given the job on an interim basis while on injured reserve. Duda owns several franchise records from his Thunder career, scoring 870 points in 14 seasons. He finished the season with a 7–43–5 record and became an assistant coach under the next head coach, Kevin McClelland.

===ECHL===
On October 7, 2014, soon before the 2014–15 CHL season was set to begin, it was announced that the Central Hockey League had ceased operations and the Thunder, along with the Allen Americans, Brampton Beast, Quad City Mallards, Missouri Mavericks, Rapid City Rush and Tulsa Oilers, were all approved for membership into the ECHL for the 2014–15 season. The team finished fifth out of seven teams in the Central Division, scoring 73 points out of 144.

On April 16, 2016, the Thunder announced that the team would not renew McClelland&#x27;s contract for the 2016–17 season. He had been with the Thunder since 2010 and guided the team for six seasons becoming the longest tenured coach in Thunder history, leading the team for 408 games. During his time in Wichita, McClelland compiled a record of 194–166–48, earning a playoff spot in his first season and taking the team to the playoff finals in the following two seasons while still in the CHL. However, he failed to lead the team into the ECHL playoffs in his two seasons leading the team in the ECHL and the Thunder finished last in the overall standings in the 2015–16 season.

Malcolm Cameron was announced as the new head coach on May 20, 2016. One of his stated intentions in his opening press conference was to establish the Thunder&#x27;s first NHL affiliation for the upcoming season. On July 4, 2016, the Ottawa Senators&#x27; assistant general manager, Randy Lee, said that his team was in negotiations for an affiliation with the Thunder for the 2016–17 season. The affiliation with the Senators and their American Hockey League affiliate, the Binghamton Senators, was finally confirmed on July 14. After one season, the Thunder changed affiliations to the Edmonton Oilers (NHL) and Bakersfield Condors (AHL). After three seasons, and one playoff appearance, Cameron was not offered an extension.

On May 15, 2019, the Thunder announced that the former Tulsa Oilers&#x27; head coach Bruce Ramsay would be Cameron&#x27;s replacement.

<doc id="683219" wikidata="Q535972" url="?curid=683219" title="Big Daddy Kane">
<text>Antonio Hardy (born September 10, 1968), better known by his stage name Big Daddy Kane, is an American rapper, producer and actor who began his career in 1986 as a member of the Juice Crew. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential and skilled MCs in hip hop. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked his song &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Half-Steppin&quot; number 25 on its list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time&quot;, calling him &quot;a master wordsmith of rap&#x27;s ... golden age and a huge influence on a generation of MCs.&quot;

==Early life==
Antonio Hardy was born on September 10, 1968, in Brooklyn.

==Biography==

===1980s===
In high school, Kane met Mister Cee, who would later play an integral role in Kane&#x27;s career when he served as his DJ. In 1984, Kane became friends with Biz Markie, and he would co-write some of Biz&#x27;s best-known lyrics. Both eventually became important members of the Queens-based Juice Crew, a collective headed by renowned producer Marley Marl. Kane signed with Tyrone Williams&#x27;s (Marl&#x27;s manager) and Len Fichtelberg&#x27;s Cold Chillin&#x27; Records label in 1987 and debuted the same year with the 12&quot; single &quot;Raw&quot;, which was an underground hit. The name Big Daddy Kane came from a variation on Caine, David Carradine&#x27;s character from the TV show &quot;Kung Fu&quot; (1972–1975), and a character called &quot;Big Daddy&quot; whom Vincent Price played in the film &quot;Beach Party&quot; (1963).

Kane is known for his ability to syncopate over faster hip hop beats, and despite his asthmatic condition, he is acknowledged as one of the pioneering masters of fast rhyming. His sense of style is renowned and set a number of late-1980s and early-1990s hip hop trends (high-top fades hairstyles, velour suits, and four-finger rings). The backronym &quot;King Asiatic Nobody&#x27;s Equal&quot; is often applied to his moniker.

He released his debut album on Cold Chillin&#x27; Records in the early summer of 1988 called &quot;Long Live the Kane&quot;, which featured the hit &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Half Steppin&quot;. The following year, Kane released his second album and biggest hit to date, &quot;It&#x27;s a Big Daddy Thing&quot;, which included 1970s sample throwbacks like &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; and the Teddy Riley-produced track &quot;I Get the Job Done&quot;, which hit the R&amp;B top 40 during the closing of the 1980s. He also had a memorable verse on the Marley Marl-produced track &quot;The Symphony&quot; released in late 1988, which included Juice Crew members Craig G, Masta Ace, and Kool G Rap.

===1990s===

In 1990, Big Daddy Kane was featured on Public Enemy&#x27;s Fear of a Black Planet on the song Burn Hollywood Burn in which he discussed the depiction of African-American characters particularly in the Jim Crow Era. Big Daddy Kane also referenced Aunt Jemima as an example of the way Black women where characterised and given low status roles, with the lyrics &quot;And Black women in this profession / As for playing a lawyer, out of the question / For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term&quot;. Big Daddy Kane&#x27;s lyrics can be seen to still having contemporary meaning after the company which produced the character removed Aunt Jemima from packaging 30 years after Burn Hollywood Burn was released.

Big Daddy Kane appeared on Patti LaBelle&#x27;s 1991 effort, &quot;Burnin. He provided the rap chorus to the single &quot;Feels Like Another One&quot;. He also appeared on the video release &quot;Live in New York&quot;.

He contributed the song &quot;&#x27;Nuff Respect&quot; to the soundtrack of Ernest Dickerson&#x27;s feature film debut &quot;Juice&quot;, which starred Omar Epps and Tupac Shakur, further demonstrating his fast lyrical delivery.

In 1991, Kane won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for his performance on the Quincy Jones collaborative track &quot;Back on the Block&quot; from the album of the same name.

Widely regarded as one of the greatest rappers during the golden age of hip hop, Kane&#x27;s experimentation with R&amp;B beats and his alignment to the Five Percent Nation drew criticism. Later albums, such as &quot;Looks Like a Job For...&quot;, were acclaimed, but he was never able to return to the commercial and artistic success of &quot;It&#x27;s a Big Daddy Thing&quot;. However, he still tours extensively.

As an actor, he debuted in Mario Van Peebles&#x27; 1993 western &quot;Posse&quot;, and appeared in Robert Townsend&#x27;s 1993 film &quot;The Meteor Man&quot;. He also posed for &quot;Playgirl&quot; and Madonna&#x27;s book &quot;Sex&quot; during the 1990s.

During the early 1990s, Jay-Z toured with Kane, and Kane helped him early on in his career. Ice-T says: &quot;I actually met Jay-Z with Kane. Kane brought Jay-Z over to my house.&quot;
Kane himself says that Jay-Z was not technically his hypeman in the true sense of the term: &quot;he wasn&#x27;t a hypeman, he basically made cameo appearances on stage. When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.&quot;
Jay-Z was also featured on Big Daddy Kane&#x27;s track &quot;Show &amp; Prove&quot; from &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Home&quot; (1994), as well as in the video.

In 1995, Kane recorded with MC Hammer and Tupac Shakur on the rap song &quot;Too Late Playa&quot; (along with Danny Boy). He was also mentioned to signing with Death Row East in 1996. In 1997, Kane teamed up with Frankie Cutlass on his third single title &quot;The Cypher Part 3&quot; and some of Marley Marl Juice Crew veterans. In 1998, he released his final solo album to date, &quot;Veteranz&#x27; Day&quot;. It received mixed reviews and did not sell well. However, Kane did not give up rapping and made many appearances in the 2000s.

===2000s===
In 2000, Big Daddy Kane appeared on Tony Touch&#x27;s &quot;The Piece Maker&quot; mixtape alongside Kool G Rap and KRS-One. A rejuvenated Kane occasionally collaborated with a variety of hip-hop artists, including A Tribe Called Quest, Jurassic 5, Little Brother, and DJ Babu of the Beat Junkies. He released two singles, the Alchemist-produced &quot;The Man, The Icon&quot;, and the DJ Premier-produced &quot;Any Type of Way&quot; (on which he discusses urban collapse in post-9/11 New York City (&quot;Giuliani got New York lookin&#x27; like it&#x27;s Amistad&quot;) and the erosion of the middle class.

Big Daddy Kane appeared on the trip hop group Morcheeba&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;What&#x27;s Your Name&quot;.

In 2005, Big Daddy Kane was honored during the VH1 Hip-Hop Honors. After a medley of hits performed by T.I., Black Thought, and Common, he came out to perform &quot;Warm It Up, Kane&quot; with his old dancers, Scoob and Scrap. Kane and Kool G Rap can both be seen briefly in &quot;Dave Chappelle&#x27;s Block Party&quot;.

In 2006, he appeared as a guest MC on the track &quot;Get Wild Off This&quot;, produced by the Stanton Warriors for their &quot;Stanton Sessions Vol. 2&quot; breaks mix. He also appeared alongside the Wu-Tang Clan, Rakim, and his longtime friends Busta Rhymes and Q-Tip in a segment of the 2006 Summer Jam concert (June 7, 2006), as part of an initiative by Busta Rhymes to honor the legacy of New York City hip-hop.

In 2007, a new track, &quot;BK Mentality&quot;, was released on the mixtape compilation &quot;Official Joints&quot;. Kane also appeared on Joell Ortiz&#x27;s &quot;The Brick: Bodega Chronicles&quot; mixtape.

Big Daddy Kane made a cameo in the 2008 video for &quot;Game&#x27;s Pain&quot;, a track by rapper The Game. The video also featured appearances by Raekwon, Three 6 Mafia and Ice Cube. Kane also appeared on the remix of &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch Me&quot; by Busta Rhymes.
Also in 2009, Kane played the role of Clay in the film &quot;Just Another Day&quot;. The film is the tale of two rappers, one poor and young, one older and successful. The movie follows them through a day of their lives.

===2010s===
Big Daddy Kane appears on one track on &quot;MA Doom: Son of Yvonne&quot;—the collaboration between MF Doom and former Juice Crew member Masta Ace.
As of 2013, Kane was recruited by New York City power group Lifted Crew and R&amp;B singer Showtyme to form a band called &quot;Las Supper&quot;. The album, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, was released on March 26, 2013.

On November 24, 2014, Big Daddy Kane discussed his upbringing, childhood influences, relationships, sexual experiences and Madonna&#x27;s 1992 book &quot;Sex&quot; in an interview on the &quot;Dr. Zoe Today&quot; show. In 2016, he was featured on Tito Jackson&#x27;s single &quot;Get It Baby&quot; in addition to appearing in the documentary &quot;Hip-Hop Evolution&quot;.

===2020s===
In June 2020, Kane released the single &quot;Enough&quot;, aimed at addressing issues surrounding police brutality.

==Legacy==
Big Daddy Kane is regarded as one of the most influential and skilled golden age rappers.
MTV put him at No. 7 in their &quot;Greatest MCs of All Time&quot; list. He is placed at No. 4 in Kool Moe Dee&#x27;s book &quot;There&#x27;s a God on the Mic: The True 50 Greatest MCs&quot;. About.com ranked him No. 3 on its list of the &quot;Top 50 MCs of Our Time&quot;, and RZA listed him as one of his &quot;Top 5 best MCs&quot;. In 2012, &quot;The Source&quot; ranked him No. 8 on their list of the &quot;Top 50 Lyricists of All Time&quot;.
AllMusic says &quot;his best material ranks among the finest hip-hop of its era, and his sex-drenched persona was enormously influential on countless future would-be players&quot;, and describes him as &quot;an enormously talented battle MC&quot;, &quot;one of rap&#x27;s major talents&quot;, refers to his &quot;near-peerless technique&quot; and &quot;first-rate technique and rhyming skills&quot;, and says he &quot;had the sheer verbal facility and razor-clean dexterity to ambush any MC and exhilarate anyone who witnessed or heard him perform&quot;.
Kool Moe Dee describes him as &quot;one of the most imitated emcees ever in the game&quot; and &quot;one of the true greatest emcees ever&quot;. Ice-T stated:
To me, Big Daddy Kane is still today one of the best rappers. I would put Big Daddy Kane against any rapper in a battle. Jay-Z, Nas, Eminem, any of them. I could take his &#x27;Raw&#x27; &quot;swagger&quot; from 88 and put it up against any record [from today]. Kane is one of the most incredible lyricists... and he will devour you on the mic. I don&#x27;t want to try to out-rap Big Daddy Kane. Big Daddy Kane can rap circles around cats.
His first two albums are also considered hip hop classics and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; says, &quot;he has received consistent critical kudos&quot;.
In the book &quot;Rap-Up: The Ultimate Guide to Hip-Hop and R&amp;B&quot;, Cameron and Devin Lazerine say Big Daddy Kane is &quot;widely seen as one of the best lyricists of his time and even today regularly gets name-checked by younger dudes&quot;, and music journalist Peter Shapiro says Kane is &quot;perhaps the most complete MC ever&quot;.
Eminem references Big Daddy Kane in the lyrics to his song &quot;Yellow Brick Road&quot; from his album &quot;Encore&quot;, saying, &quot;we (Eminem and Proof) was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit, where compound syllables sound combined&quot;, and he quotes the same lines in his book &quot;The Way I Am&quot;—this illustrates how Big Daddy Kane had an influence on both Eminem&#x27;s and Proof&#x27;s rhyme technique.

<text>Grímr Kveldúlfsson, usually called Skalla-Grímr, was a Norwegian who lived in the ninth and tenth centuries. He is an important character in &quot;Egils saga&quot; and is mentioned in the &quot;Landnámabók&quot;.

==Biography==

===Family===
Skalla-Grímr was the son of Kveldúlfr Bjálfason and Salbjörg Káradóttir. He had one brother, Þorolfr, and was related to Ketil Trout on his father&#x27;s side and Eyvind Lambi on his mother&#x27;s. He was married to Bera Yngvarsdóttir and had two sons, Þorolfr and Egill, and two daughters, Sæunn and Þórunn. His ancestor, Hallbjorn, was Norwegian-Sami.

===Feud with King Harald===
Skalla-Grímr&#x27;s brother Þorolfr was a member of King Haraldr Fairhair&#x27;s retinue, although Kveldúlfr refused to swear allegiance to the king. When Haraldr had Þorolfr killed, Skalla-Grímr and Kveldulfr attacked a ship, this belonging to the brothers Sigtryggr and Hallvarðr, these brothers had been the cause of Haraldr&#x27;s distrust with Þorolfr, spreading lies and rumors to convince their king to let them take Þorolfr&#x27;s land. Skalla-Grimr knew of this and saw their ship flying their banner not far from the coast. Skalla-Grimr took the chance and set out for the brothers with his father and other warriors, and killed all but two of those on the ship, including two of the King&#x27;s cousins.

===Settlement in Iceland===
Following these killings, Skalla-Grímr and Kveldúlfr set out for Iceland. Kveldúlfr fell sick due to his berserkr rage in the former battle as his body was becoming too old to fight. He died early in the voyage, however, before he died, he commanded his ship&#x27;s Captain (There were two ships, Skalla-Grimr was not on this one.) to throw overboard his casket, and wherever it may come to the shore is where the ships will settle. The Ship Captain did as Kvedulfr directed, and when he arrived in Iceland, he discovered the casket had come ashore in the Mýrar district, near Borg. When they arrived at Iceland they found Skalla-Grimr and told him of his father&#x27;s death, and of his wish. Skalla-Grímr and the settlers built his house at Borg, and settled the entire region.

Skalla-Grímr lived to an old age and died at Borg.

==Poetry==

Skalla-Grímr was a prolific poet, and composed this stanza:
&lt;poem&gt;&quot;Nú&#x27;s hersis hefnd
við hilmi efnd;
gengr ulfr ok örn
of ynglings börn.
Flugu höggvin hræ
Hallvarðs á sæ.
Grár slítr undir
ari Snarfara.&quot;

Now the nobleman (Kveldúlfr) has exacted revenge upon the king (Harald Fairhair); 
now wolf and eagle tread on the king&#x27;s children. 
The hewn corpses of Hallvarðr (Hallvarðr Harðfari and his people, that is the enemies) flew into the sea; 
the grey eagle tears the wounds of Snarfari (Sigtryggr Snarfari was the brother of Hallvarðr Harðfari).
&lt;/poem&gt;

According to the late scholar Bjarni Einarsson this poem, by using end rhyme, &quot;if authentic&quot; is a unique phenomenon in late ninth-century Old Norse poetry.

<doc id="683249" wikidata="Q5130738" url="?curid=683249" title="Clear Lake (region)">
<text>Clear Lake, or the Clear Lake Area, is a region in parts of Harris and Galveston County in Texas, United States. It is part of the Galveston Bay Area, which itself is a section of the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area. The area is geographically characterized by the bodies of water in it and around it, including Clear Lake, Taylor Lake, Clear Creek, and Galveston Bay.

Clear Lake is relatively affluent with a thriving business community. The area&#x27;s most important business sectors are aerospace and tourism. It is home to the Johnson Space Center and numerous aerospace contracting firms. The lake itself is home to one of the largest concentrations of recreational boats and marinas in the nation.

==Name==
The Clear Lake region is named, as it implies, for Clear Lake, a brackish lake, fed by Clear Creek, that empties into Galveston Bay.

The name &quot;Clear Lake&quot; is often used in a variety of ways depending on the source. Apart from referring to the lake itself or the region defined by the chamber of commerce, the name can refer to the Clear Lake City residential development, the Clear Lake area of Houston (a Houston &quot;superneighborhood&quot; including Clear Lake City, Johnson Space Center, and surrounding areas), the Clear Lake area of Pasadena, and other geographies as well.

==Boundaries==
 the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, established in 1962, provides the following definition for the area.

These communities lie on or near the lake. They occupy a compact area lying between Houston and the bay. Clear Lake City is itself a composite community within the Clear Lake Area that spans parts of Houston, Webster, and Seabrook.

==History==

At the time Europeans arrived the area around Galveston Bay was largely inhabited by Akokisa and Karankawa tribes. The first substantial European presence in the area came as a result of the pirate kingdom established by Jean Lafitte in the early 19th century from his base on Galveston Island. One of the earliest settlers in the region was Anson Taylor, namesake of Taylor Lake, who supplied Lafitte&#x27;s Galveston colony with produce and game from around Armand Bayou (though his homestead was actually near the Trinity River).

During most of the 19th century the Clear Lake Area remained largely undeveloped. Ranches such as the famed Allen Ranch used much of the area as a cattle range. Toward the end of the century small farming and fishing communities developed. Railroads grew up near the area as well connecting the nearby commercial centers of Galveston, Harrisburg, and Houston spawning new communities such as Clear Creek (League City) and Webster.

In 1901 the oil gusher at Spindletop launched the Texas Oil Boom. Soon oil wells and refineries were built in nearby Goose Creek (modern Baytown) and Texas City. Houston rapidly became established as the main commercial center in the area for the oil industry. The Clear Lake Area became an attractive recreational destination for the new class of wealthy oil businessmen. Much of the area was developed as retreats for the wealthy including a large ranch estate owned by Houston businessman James West. The population increased rapidly including significant immigration from overseas. The Maceo crime syndicate, which ran Galveston at that time, created casino districts in Kemah and other areas of Galveston County (though they were shut down in the mid-20th century).

In 1963 NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center (JSC) was established in the area. That and the explosive growth of neighboring Houston in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 80s, caused significant urbanization. The Clear Lake City community was created by the Friendswood Development Company, a venture of Humble Oil and Dell E. Webb Corporation, to support residential growth near the new NASA facility. Some of the communities around Clear Lake reoriented toward aerospace-related industries. Still tourism and recreation remain core industries of the area today.

==Economy==
The area&#x27;s most important employment sectors are aerospace, high-tech (software, biotechnology, electronics, etc.), and tourism. Most other employment in the region is supported by these industries. Also, a significant number of petrochemical and refining industry employees who work at near-by facilities live in the area.

NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center (JSC) is an important pillar of the area economy. the center itself employs 3,000 civil servants and 12,000 engineering contractors. Businesses around this core include a broad range of high-tech development enterprises. JSC manages more than $4 billion annually in aerospace contracts, and together with numerous private companies involved in space programs and related ventures gives the area one of the highest concentrations of aerospace businesses and expertise in the nation.

The tourism industry attracts millions of visitors each year with attractions ranging from Space Center Houston to the bay itself. Ecotourism, in particular, is a growing sector with destinations such as the Armand Bayou Nature Center, one of the largest urban wilderness preserves in the nation, and the Seabrook Trail System (part of the Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail). Biotechnology, which already employs nearly 3000 workers in the area, is a smaller but growing industry in the area enabled in large part by JSC and the Texas Medical Center in Houston. Commercial fishing is one of the older industries in the region and is still a significant economic sector.

==Demographics==
The Clear Lake Area contains diverse communities. Based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the City of Houston the area had following demographic statistics in 2000. The total population of the area was approximately 141,980. The median household income was approximately $64,742 (US). The population was 81.6% white, 4.4% African-American, and 6.1% Asian. The comparable statistics for nearby Houston were a median household income of $36,616, 49.3% white, 25.3% African American, and 5.3% Asian. The comparable U.S. statistics were a median household income of $41,994, 75.1% white, 12.3% African American, and 3.6% Asian.

Apart from Houston, which is only partially within the Clear Lake area, League City is the area&#x27;s largest community. Taylor Lake Village has the highest median household income in the area and Webster has the lowest.
==Education==
The primary institution of higher learning in the area is the University of Houston–Clear Lake (UHCL). UHCL is separate and distinct from the University of Houston (UH), but it is part of the larger University of Houston System. The university offers a wide spectrum of programs including what it touts as the most complete biotechnology graduate programs in the state. Additionally San Jacinto College has extension centers in the area.

Primary and secondary education are provided by Clear Creek Independent School District, which serves most of the area&#x27;s communities with the exception of outlying parts of League City. Clear Creek ISD was ranked as a &quot;recognized&quot; district (the second-highest ranking) by the Texas Education Agency. 25 (65%) of the district&#x27;s schools were ranked as &quot;exemplary&quot; (the highest ranking) and the rest were ranked as &quot;recognized&quot;. For comparison, 29% of all schools in Texas rated by the TEA were ranked as &quot;exemplary&quot;.
==Culture and recreation==
In terms of the restaurants in the region, Katharine Shilcutt of the &quot;Houston Press&quot; said in 2010 &quot;there&#x27;s also more to the area than overly-fancy eateries like Cullen&#x27;s or old mainstays like Villa Capri and the Seabrook Classic Cafe. (Not that we don&#x27;t cling to nostalgic memories of those last two places, but there&#x27;s better food to be found in Clear Lake now.)&quot;

===Festivals and events===
Many annual events take place in the Clear Lake Area. The Blessing of the Fleet boat parade in Kemah is an annual event that celebrates Kemah&#x27;s history as a shrimp fishing town. The Gulf Coast Film Festival annually showcases independent films from local, regional and international artists in various categories ranging from short films to documentaries. Other annual events include the Wings over Houston Air Fest (Ellington Field), the Ballunar Liftoff Festival, the Oak Tree Festival (League City), and the South Shore Dockside Food &amp; Wine Festival (League City). The Galveston Bay Cruising Association holds regular regatta events on the bay such as the Bay Cup (Lakewood Yacht Club, Seabrook) and the Performance Cup.

===Artistic programs===
The region offers various artistic programs. The Bay Area Houston Ballet and Theatre group and the League City Ballet offer performances in genres ranging from ballet to American musicals. The Clear Lake Symphony offers multiple performances each year ranging from classical to &quot;pops&quot; performances. The Arts Alliance at Clear Lake, a group of 50 area arts organizations, regularly schedules arts exhibits, musical performances, and other arts programs. The Clear Creek Country Theatre (Nassau Bay) offers regular community theater performances. Additionally various free concerts and other cultural events take place in venues such as League Park Plaza (League City).

===Parks and attractions===
The Armand Bayou Nature Center is one of the largest urban wilderness preserve in the nation. It features a boardwalk through the marshes, numerous nature trails, and boat tours offering views of natural habitats for animals ranging from bison to seagulls to butterflies. The Texas Armand Bayou Coastal Preserve features one of region&#x27;s most popular paddling trails. The Seabrook Trail System, which includes Robinson and Pine Gully Parks, offers primitive access to natural habitats for numerous species. These sites are all part of the larger Great Texas Coastal Birding Trail. Other major area parks include Harris County Clear Lake and Bay Area parks, Clear Creek Nature Park (League City) and Challenger 7 Memorial Park (Webster).

Space Center Houston is the tourist arm of the Johnson Space Center and one of the most visited tourist attractions in Texas. Visitors can tour the Space Center grounds, view space capsules and artifacts, and find numerous educational activities including an IMAX theater. The Kemah Boardwalk is a waterfront attraction featuring a variety of rides, restaurants, shops, and other entertainment venues. It is next to the Kemah Marina and hosts annual events such as the Boardwalk Wine Festival. Museums in the area include the Bay Area Museum (Seabrook) and the Butler Longhorn Museum (League City).

Farmers markets in the area, including the Nassau Bay Farmers Market and the Farmers Market at Clear Lake Shores, provide opportunities for area residents to connect with local growers, producers, and other businesses. The League City Historic District provides views of early area architecture in addition to unique shopping venues.

The area contains many marinas for boating and fishing enthusiasts such as the Watergate Yachting Center (Clear Lake Shores) and Marina Bay Harbor Marina. The shoreline of Clear Lake itself has the greatest concentration of recreational boats in Texas and ranks third nationwide (Watergate even claims to be the nation&#x27;s largest). 

===Religion===
There is one Coptic Orthodox church in the area, Archangel Raphael Coptic Orthodox Church in Clear Lake City.

The Clear Lake Islamic Center Inc. (CLIC) is the largest mosque in the Clear Lake area. It was established in 1996. In addition, the Al-Noor Society of Greater Houston operates the Clear Lake Jama Masjid.

<text>Pasargadae (; ) was the capital of the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great (559–530 BC). Today it is an archaeological site located just north of the town of Madar-e-Soleyman and about to the northeast of the modern city of Shiraz. It is one of Iran&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is considered to be the location of the Tomb of Cyrus, a tomb previously attributed to &quot;Madar-e-Soleyman&quot;, the &quot;Mother of Solomon&quot;. Currently it is a national tourist site administered by the Iranian culture of world heritage.

==History==
Pasargadae was founded in the 6th century BCE as the first capital of the Achaemenid Empire by Cyrus the Great, near the site of his victory over the Median king Astyages in 550 BCE. The city remained the Achaemenid capital until Darius moved it to Persepolis.

The archaeological site covers and includes a structure commonly believed to be the mausoleum of Cyrus, the fortress of Toll-e Takht sitting on top of a nearby hill, and the remains of two royal palaces and gardens. Pasargadae Persian Gardens provide the earliest known example of the Persian &quot;chahar bagh&quot;, or fourfold garden design (see Persian Gardens).

The remains of the tomb of Cyrus&#x27; son and successor Cambyses II have been found in Pasargadae, near the fortress of Toll-e Takht, and identified in 2006.

The Gate R, located at the eastern edge of the palace area, is the oldest known freestanding propylaeum. It may have been the architectural predecessor of the Gate of All Nations at Persepolis.

==Tomb of Cyrus the Great==

The most important monument in Pasargadae is the tomb of Cyrus the Great. It has six broad steps leading to the sepulchre, the chamber of which measures long by wide by high and has a low and narrow entrance. Though there is no firm evidence identifying the tomb as that of Cyrus, Greek historians say that Alexander believed it was. When Alexander looted and destroyed Persepolis, he paid a visit to the tomb of Cyrus. Arrian, writing in the second century CE, recorded that Alexander commanded Aristobulus, one of his warriors, to enter the monument. Inside he found a golden bed, a table set with drinking vessels, a gold coffin, some ornaments studded with precious stones and an inscription on the tomb. No trace of any such inscription survives, and there is considerable disagreement about the exact wording of the text. Strabo and Arrian report that it reads:

The design of Cyrus&#x27; tomb is credited to Mesopotamian or Elamite ziggurats, but the cella is usually attributed to Urartu tombs of an earlier period. In particular, the tomb at Pasargadae has almost exactly the same dimensions as the tomb of Alyattes, father of the Lydian King Croesus; however, some have refused the claim (according to Herodotus, Croesus was spared by Cyrus during the conquest of Lydia, and became a member of Cyrus&#x27; court). The main decoration on the tomb is a rosette design over the door within the gable. In general, the art and architecture found at Pasargadae exemplified the Persian synthesis of various traditions, drawing on precedents from Elam, Babylon, Assyria, and ancient Egypt, with the addition of some Anatolian influences.

==Archaeology==
The first capital of the Achaemenid Empire, Pasargadae lies in ruins 40 kilometers from Persepolis, in present-day Fars province of Iran. Gardens were of great significance in Persian culture, and the palace complex was constituted by an extensive pattern of gardens stretching from the Tomb of Cyrus to a fortress known as the Tall-i Takht, about three kilometres away, and containing various palaces and other buildings. The architecture showed elements of Elamite and Egyptian or Phoenician decoration as well as Ionian Greek building techniques, suggesting a desire by Cyrus to reflect his imperial rather than simply national kingship.

Pasargadae was first archaeologically explored by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld in 1905, and in one excavation season in 1928, together with his assistant . Since 1946, the original documents, notebooks, photographs, fragments of wall paintings and pottery from the early excavations are preserved in the Freer Gallery of Art, Smithsonian Institution, in Washington, DC. After Herzfeld, Sir Aurel Stein completed a site plan for Pasargadae in 1934. In 1935, Erich F. Schmidt produced a series of aerial photographs of the entire complex.

From 1949 to 1955, an Iranian team led by Ali Sami worked there. A British Institute of Persian Studies team led by David Stronach resumed excavation from 1961 to 1963. It was during the 1960s that a pot-hoard known as the Pasargadae Treasure was excavated near the foundations of &#x27;Pavilion B&#x27; at the site. Dating to the 5th-4th centuries BC, the treasure consists of ornate Achaemenid jewellery made from gold and precious gems and is now housed in the National Museum of Iran and the British Museum. It has been suggested that the treasure was buried as a subsequent action once Alexander the Great approached with his army, then remained buried, hinting at violence.

After a gap, work was resumed by the Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization and the Maison de l&#x27;Orient et de la Méditerranée of the University of Lyon in 2000. The complex is one of the key cultural heritage sites for tourism in Iran.

==Sivand Dam controversy==
There has been growing concern regarding the proposed Sivand Dam, named after the nearby town of Sivand. Despite planning that has stretched over 10 years, Iran&#x27;s own Iranian Cultural Heritage Organization was not aware of the broader areas of flooding during much of this time.

Its placement between both the ruins of Pasargadae and Persepolis has many archaeologists and Iranians worried that the dam will flood these UNESCO World Heritage sites, although scientists involved with the construction say this is not obvious because the sites sit above the planned waterline. Of the two sites, Pasargadae is the one considered to be more threatened. Experts agree that the planning of future dam projects in Iran will merit an earlier examination of the risks to cultural resource properties.

Of broadly shared concern to archaeologists is the effect of the increase in humidity caused by the lake. All agree that the humidity created by it will speed up the destruction of Pasargadae, yet experts from the Ministry of Energy believe it could be partially compensated for by controlling the water level of the reservoir.

Construction of the dam began on 19 April 2007, with the height of the waterline limited so as to mitigate damage to the ruins.

==In popular culture==

In 1930, the Brazilian poet Manuel Bandeira published a poem called &quot;Vou-me embora pra Pasárgada&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m off to Pasargadae&quot; in Portuguese), in a book entitled &quot;Libertinagem&quot;. It tells the story of a man who wants to go to Pasargadae, described in the poem as a utopian city, having the children learned in the school about this &quot;utopic city created by Manuel Bandeira&quot;. Manuel Bandeira heard the name Pasargadae for the first time when he was 16 years old, reading a book by a Greek author. The name of the field of the Persians reminded him of good things, of a place of tranquillity and beauties. Years later, in his apartment, during a moment of sadness and anxiety, he had the idea of &quot;vou-me embora pra Pasárgada&quot; (I&#x27;m off to Pasargadae) and then created the poem, which surrounds the great part of the Brazilian population&#x27;s imagination to this day.

<doc id="683260" wikidata="Q5073199" url="?curid=683260" title="Chaplain Tappman">
<text>[[Chaplain]] [[Captain (land)|Captain]] Albert Taylor Tappman (A.T. Tappman) (usually referred to as &quot;the Chaplain&quot;) is a fictional character in Joseph Heller&#x27;s 1961 novel &quot;Catch-22&quot; and its 1994 sequel &quot;Closing Time&quot;. In earlier editions he was called Chaplain Robert Oliver Shipman, but this was changed to Albert Taylor Tappman. Editions published in some other territories, notably Britain, have continued to use the original name. Heller named the character after Charles Allan Tapman, a Penn State University boxer and Class of 1938 graduate that Heller met socially in the early 1950s.

== Character overview ==
He is a naïve Anabaptist minister from Kenosha, Wisconsin, who is tormented throughout the novel by his atheist assistant, Corporal Whitcomb. While easily intimidated by the cruelty of others, the chaplain is a kind, gentle and sensitive man who worries constantly about his wife and children at home. He is the only character in the book Yossarian truly trusts, and the novel opens with:

:It was love at first sight. The first time Yossarian saw the chaplain he fell madly in love with him.

He is timid and shy, and only through his friendship with Yossarian does he feel comfortable. In particular he enjoys the company of Yossarian and his friends at the staff club, until he is thrown out by Colonel Cathcart after General Dreedle is embarrassed by him.

Also of note is that the Chaplain and Yossarian have the first characteristic Heller-like circular dialogue in the novel, on page 13:

:&quot;You&#x27;re a chaplain,&quot; he exclaimed ecstatically. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know you were a chaplain.&quot;
:&quot;Why, yes,&quot; the chaplain answered. &quot;Didn&#x27;t you know I was a chaplain?&quot;
:&quot;Why, no. I didn&#x27;t know you were a chaplain.&quot;

== Name versions ==
In the original version of the book, Chaplain Tappman was called &quot;Robert Oliver Shipman&quot;. In the late spring of 1962, a man who shared Shipman&#x27;s name and other personal characteristics threatened a lawsuit. Heller had never met the real Shipman and was initially concerned that changing the character&#x27;s name could confuse readers. Nevertheless, the author agreed to change the name to &quot;Albert Taylor Tappman&quot; beginning with the sixth Simon &amp; Schuster printing, the fall 1962 Dell paperback edition, and later printings of Jonathan Cape&#x27;s British first edition. In the 1970 film, the character is identified as &quot;Chaplain Tappman&quot; and is apparently embarrassed by the unfortunate rhyme. British editions by Transworld retain the name &quot;R.O. Shipman&quot;.

== C.I.D. investigation ==
The C.I.D. investigators that have been dispatched to the squadron are convinced that the Chaplain has been intercepting Major Major Major Major&#x27;s mail and signing documents Washington Irving or Irving Washington. Yossarian has been abusing his duty of censoring letters sent home by the enlisted men, and signing those names to the letters he vandalises, except once where he signs &quot;I yearn for you tragically. A. T. Tappman, Chaplain, U.S. Army&quot;. (Note that Yossarian&#x27;s duties involve censoring enlisted men&#x27;s letters; the chaplain is an officer.) This vandalism brings the C.I.D. down to the base.

Later on, Major Major Major Major begins signing those names to official documents, after he discovers that when he does, he never sees them again. Before they would always return with more attached documents to deal with.

These suspected acts of protest result in the Chaplain being interrogated at length by the C.I.D. investigators in the final chapters of the book. They find him guilty of all his &quot;crimes&quot;; since they&#x27;re his crimes, he must have committed them; they also find him guilty of all the charges against him that they haven&#x27;t thought of yet. Then they release him. This is actually worse than being jailed, because he never knows when he will be grabbed again.

When Yossarian tells the Chaplain that someone came into his hospital room to torment him with the words &quot;We&#x27;ve got your pal!&quot; the Chaplain replies. &quot;Well, I&#x27;m your pal and they&#x27;ve certainly got me.&quot; At the end of the novel, all Yossarian&#x27;s other friends are dead, missing, or, like Doc Daneeka, reduced to bureaucratic zombies. Only the Chaplain remains, and he has definitely been got (although in the last paragraphs he announces his intent to &quot;stay here and persevere&quot;). At the end of the play version, buoyed by Yossarian&#x27;s escape, he happily writes home to his wife that he has punched Colonel Cathcart in the nose, is cheerfully awaiting his trial and following consequences, and that they think he is crazy.

== Film ==
Chaplain Tappman was portrayed by Anthony Perkins in the 1970 film adaptation of the novel directed by Mike Nichols.

Chaplain Tappman was portrayed by Jay Paulson in the 2019 miniseries directed by George Clooney, Grant Heslov, and Ellen Kuras.

<text>Michael Leonard Brecker (March 29, 1949 – January 13, 2007) was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. He was awarded 15 Grammy Awards as a performer and composer, received an honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music in 2004, and was inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame in 2007.

==Early life and education==
Brecker was born in Philadelphia and raised in the local suburb of Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania. He was raised in a Jewish, and artistic, family: his father, Bob (Bobby), was a lawyer who played jazz piano and his mother, Sylvia, was a portrait artist. Michael was exposed to jazz at an early age by his father. He began studying clarinet at age 6, then moved to the alto saxophone in the eighth grade, settling on the tenor saxophone as his primary instrument in his sophomore year of high school.

He graduated from Cheltenham High School in 1967 and spent that summer at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. In Fall 1967, he followed his older brother, Randy, to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana, where he formed a jazz rock group with trumpet player Randy Sandke and others called Mrs. Seamon&#x27;s Sound Band, named after a dormitory official who disliked longhaired students.

==Career==
Mrs. Seamon&#x27;s Sound Band were finalists in the competition at the Spring 1968 Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival, but were disqualified for their interpretation of The Doors song &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. The band also performed outdoors on campus in a benefit for presidential candidate Eugene McCarthy in that year’s presidential election. Following that semester, the band accepted a management offer and moved to Chicago, where drugs and a love triangle led to a suicide, which brought Chicago police to the manager&#x27;s apartment, where all of the band except Sandke and Brecker, neither of whom were at the scene, were arrested. More trauma followed, and according to Randy Sandke, these events had an adverse psychological impact on Brecker which led to later substance abuse.

During the fall 1968 semester at Indiana University, Brecker formed a trio, which included the drummer from Mrs. Seamon&#x27;s Sound Band, and played gigs at a church basement club called The Owl. Some of that was recorded. He dropped out before the end of the semester, spent a month in Mexico City, then returned to Philadelphia, where he played with Eric Gravatt, Billy Paul, and others.

Brecker moved to New York City in 1969, where he carved out a niche for himself as a dynamic and exciting jazz soloist. He first made his mark at age 20 as a member of the jazz-rock band Dreams, a band that included his older brother, trumpeter Randy Brecker, trombonist Barry Rogers, drummer Billy Cobham, keyboardist Jeff Kent and bassist Doug Lubahn. Dreams was short-lived, lasting only from 1969 through 1972, but Miles Davis was seen at some gigs prior to his recording &quot;Jack Johnson&quot;.

Most of Brecker&#x27;s early work is marked by an approach informed as much by rock guitar as by R&amp;B saxophone. After Dreams, he worked with Horace Silver and then Billy Cobham before once again teaming up with his brother Randy to form the Brecker Brothers. The band followed jazz-funk trends of the time, but with more attention to structured arrangements, a heavier backbeat, and a stronger rock influence. The band stayed together from 1975 to 1982, with consistent success and musicality. In 1977 he founded the Seventh Avenue South jazz club with his brother Randy.

===Sideman and leader===
Brecker was in great demand as a soloist, sideman and session musician. He performed with bands whose styles ranged from mainstream jazz to mainstream rock. Altogether, he appeared on nearly 900 albums, either as a band member or a guest soloist. He put his stamp on numerous pop and rock recordings as a soloist, including notable work with James Taylor and Paul Simon. Other sessions included albums with Steely Dan, Lou Reed, Donald Fagen, Dire Straits, Joni Mitchell, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, Billy Joel, John Lennon, Aerosmith, Dan Fogelberg, Kenny Loggins, Frank Sinatra, Frank Zappa, Bruce Springsteen, Roger Daltrey, Parliament-Funkadelic, Cameo, Yoko Ono, Todd Rundgren, Chaka Khan, Orleans, Blue Öyster Cult, The Manhattan Transfer, Average White Band, Players Association, Everything but the Girl, Patti Austin, Art Garfunkel, Carly Simon, The Brothers Johnson, Karen Carpenter, and T-Square.

Brecker also recorded (or performed) with many leading jazz musicians of his era, including Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Hal Galper, Chet Baker, Jan Akkerman, George Benson, Quincy Jones, Charles Mingus, Jaco Pastorius, McCoy Tyner, Pat Metheny, Elvin Jones, Claus Ogerman, Billy Cobham, Horace Silver, Mike Stern, Mike Mainieri, Max Roach, Steps Ahead, Dave Holland, Joey Calderazzo, Kenny Kirkland, Bob James, Grant Green, Don Cherry, Hubert Laws, Don Alias, Larry Goldings, Bob Mintzer, Gary Burton, Yusef Lateef, Steve Gadd, Richard Tee, Dave Brubeck, Charlie Haden, John Abercrombie, Vince Mendoza, Roy Hargrove, and Spyro Gyra, as wel as for French zeuhl-band Magma.

Brecker played tenor saxophone on two Billy Joel albums. In 1983, Brecker played on three tracks on the album &quot;An Innocent Man&quot; (&quot;Careless Talk&quot;, &quot;Tell Her About It&quot; and &quot;Keeping The Faith&quot;). In 1986, he played on &quot;Big Man on Mulberry Street&quot; on the album &quot;The Bridge&quot;.

During the early 1980s, he was also a member of NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night Live Band. Brecker can be seen in the background sporting sunglasses during Eddie Murphy&#x27;s James Brown parody. After a stint co-leading the all-star group Steps Ahead with Mike Mainieri, Brecker recorded a solo album in 1987. That eponymously titled debut album marked his return to a more traditional jazz setting, highlighting his compositional talents and featuring the EWI (Electronic Wind Instrument), which Brecker had previously played with Steps Ahead. In 1987 he featured his new solo album at the JVC Newport Jazz Festival, incorporating the EWI.
Brecker continued to record albums as a leader throughout the 1990s and 2000s, winning multiple Grammy Awards.

He went on tour in 2001 with a collaborative group, Hancock-Brecker-Hargrove. This tour was dedicated to jazz pioneers John Coltrane and Miles Davis. Brecker paid homage to Coltrane by performing Coltrane&#x27;s signature piece, &quot;Naima&quot;. The concert CD from the tour, &quot;Directions in Music: Live At Massey Hall&quot; (2002), won a Grammy in 2003.

===Illness and death===
While performing at the Mount Fuji Jazz Festival in 2004, Brecker experienced a sharp pain in his back. Shortly thereafter in 2005, he was diagnosed with the blood disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Despite a widely publicized worldwide search, Brecker was unable to find a matching stem cell donor. In late 2005, he was the recipient of an experimental partial matching stem cell transplant. By late 2006, he appeared to be recovering, but the treatment proved not to be a cure. He made his final public performance on June 23, 2006, playing with Herbie Hancock at Carnegie Hall. Brecker died from complications of leukemia in a Manhattan hospital. His funeral was held on January 15, 2007, in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

==Instruments==
Early in his career, Brecker played a Selmer Super Balanced Action saxophone, later moving to a lacquer-finished Selmer Mark VI tenor saxophone with silver-plated neck, fitted with a Dave Guardala MB1 mouthpiece and LaVoz medium reeds. His earlier mouthpieces included a metal Otto Link &#x27;New York&#x27; STM (during the mid-1970s) and a metal Dukoff in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Brecker also played the drums as he often talked about time, or rhythm, being musically the most important. He displayed his drum prowess during shows with his own ensembles or accompanying students during masterclasses.

==Legacy==

On February 11, 2007, Brecker was awarded two posthumous Grammy awards for his involvement on his brother Randy&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Some Skunk Funk&quot;.

On May 22, 2007, his final recording, &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;, was released and received a good critical response. It was recorded in August 2006 with Pat Metheny on guitar, John Patitucci on bass, Jack DeJohnette on drums and Herbie Hancock and Brad Mehldau on piano. Brecker was critically ill when it was recorded, but the other musicians involved praised the standard of his musicianship. Brecker was again posthumously awarded two additional Grammy Awards for this album in the categories of Best Jazz Instrumental Solo and Best Jazz Instrumental Album, Individual or Group, bringing his Grammy total to 15.

Brecker&#x27;s search in the International Bone Marrow Registry for a match prompted his wife and manager to organize a series of bone marrow drives throughout the world, including the Red Sea, Monterey, and Newport Jazz Festivals. Brecker was subsequently featured in a film directed by Noah Hutton (son of Debra Winger and Timothy Hutton), named &quot;More to Live For&quot;. It documents Brecker&#x27;s battle with leukemia, and the production of his final recording. By going public with his illness, Brecker raised tens of thousands of dollars for testing, and signed up many thousands of donors, but was unable to find a match for himself.

Herbie Hancock said that around nine months before his death, Brecker had started practicing Buddhism and three months later joined Soka Gakkai International, a group associated with Nichiren Buddhism. At Brecker&#x27;s memorial service, Hancock, Wayne Shorter and Buster Williams (who all practice the same form of Buddhism) as well as Brecker&#x27;s son, Sam, sat in a line with their backs to the audience while facing an inscribed scroll (Gohonzon) hanging in a wooden shrine (Butsudan) and chanted, &quot;Nam myoho renge kyo&quot; for five minutes.

Brecker&#x27;s widow Susan organized two benefit concerts, the first in 2015 and the latter in 2017. The events were dubbed &quot;The Nearness of You&quot; concert and were held at Jazz at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Appel Room. The concerts aimed to support cancer research at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) and the work of doctors Azra Raza and Siddhartha Mukherjee. Guest performers included James Taylor, Paul Simon, Chaka Khan, Randy Brecker, Dianne Reeves, Bobby McFerrin, Diana Krall, Wynton Marsalis, Will Lee, Gil Goldstein, Antonio Sanchez, John Patitucci, Adam Rogers, Mike Mainieri, Andy Snitzer, Jack DeJohnette, Chase Baird, Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts, Robert Glasper, Dave Liebman, Joe Lovano, Ravi Coltrane, Nir Felder, Eli Degibri and others.
The Michael Brecker Archive was established in 2013 at William Paterson University in Wayne, New Jersey, in collaboration with Susan Brecker, and Randy Brecker acting as advisor. The archive contains: original pencil and ink tune manuscripts covering Brecker&#x27;s solo career and collaborations with Elvin Jones, Pat Metheny, Paul Simon, Horace Silver, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and others; three EWIs; mouthpieces, reeds and other equipment; over 250 commercially released LPs and CDs; over 1200 hours of unreleased live recordings and studio mixes on cassettes, DATs and other digital media; nine practice journals spanning from Brecker&#x27;s time at Indiana University to the late 1990s; music books from his personal collection; an extensive clippings file; business materials; tour itineraries and record company/tour promotional materials; and over 1500 unreleased photo images.

<doc id="683269" wikidata="Q488503" url="?curid=683269" title="Blading (professional wrestling)">
<text>In professional wrestling, blading is the practice of intentionally cutting oneself to provoke bleeding. It is also known as &quot;juicing&quot;, &quot;gigging&quot;, or &quot;getting color&quot;. Similarly, a blade is an object used for blading, and a bladejob is a specific act of blading. The act is usually done a good length into the match, as the blood will mix with the flowing sweat on a wrestler&#x27;s brow to make it look like much more blood is flowing from the wound than there actually is. The preferred area for blading is usually the forehead, as scalp wounds bleed profusely and heal easily. Legitimate, unplanned bleeding which occurs outside the storyline is called &quot;juicing the hard way&quot;.

==History==
===Origin===
Prior to the advent of blading, most storyline blood in wrestling came from one wrestler deliberately splitting the flesh over their opponent&#x27;s eyebrow bone with a hard well placed and forceful punch. In his third autobiography, &quot;The Hardcore Diaries&quot;, Mick Foley cited Terry Funk as one of the few remaining active wrestlers who knew how to &quot;bust an eyebrow open&quot; in this way before funk’s passing in August of 2023. However, on a very rare occasion, in the 2012 Extreme Rules event, Brock Lesnar caused John Cena to bleed without blading with a vicious elbow to his head and further hard strikes to Cena&#x27;s body, though Cena ultimately won the match, and the match was critically acclaimed. The forehead has always been the preferred blading surface, due to the abundance of blood vessels. A cut in this area will bleed freely for a length of time and will heal quickly. A cut in this location will allow the blood to mix in with the sweat on the wrestler&#x27;s face, giving them a &quot;crimson mask&quot; effect.

===Contemporary history===
Popularity of blading declined during the mid-2000&#x27;s. The wrestler always runs the risk of cutting too deeply and slicing an artery in the forehead. In 2004, Eddie Guerrero accidentally did this during his match with JBL at Judgment Day, resulting in a rush of blood pouring from the bladed area. Guerrero lost so much blood because of the cut that he felt the effects from it for two weeks.

In the past North American professional wrestling, blading was almost exclusively performed by and on male performers. However in promotions that allow blading in the 2020s such as All Elite Wrestling (AEW), women have bladed as well. For example, in a match between Britt Baker and Thunder Rosa in 2021, Baker underwent excessive bleeding because of blading during the match.

Some wrestlers like Abdullah the Butcher, Dusty Rhodes, New Jack, Bruiser Brody, King Curtis Iaukea, Carlos Colón Sr., Perro Aguayo, Devon Hughes (Brother Devon/D-Von Dudley), Steve Corino, Tarzan Goto, Balls Mahoney, Kintaro Kanemura, Jun Kasai, Masashi Takeda, Corporal Robinson, Villano III, Ian Rotten, Sabu, The Sheik, and Manny Fernandez, have disfiguring scars on their heads from frequently blading throughout their careers. According to Mick Foley, the scars in Abdullah&#x27;s forehead are so deep that he enjoys holding coins or gambling chips in them as a macabre party trick.

Presently, blading is a lot less popular than in the past, due to the prevalence and heightened awareness of AIDS and hepatitis. In the 1980s, the willingness to blade was seen as an advantage for new wrestlers. From July 2008 onward, due to its TV-PG rating, WWE has not allowed wrestlers to blade themselves. In most cases, any blood coming from the wrestlers is unintentional. To maintain their TV-PG rating, when a wrestler bleeds on live television, WWE tends to attempt to stop the bleeding mid-match or use different camera angles to avoid showing excessive blood. During repeats of said footage, WWE television programs often shift to black-and-white. However, beginning in 2024, following the end of the PG era, WWE has once again permitted wrestlers to blade during matches and angles. 

Impact Wrestling, formerly known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), used blading frequently until adopting a new no-blood policy in 2014. Wrestlers Abyss and Raven were famed for their matches involving a lot of blood in TNA before the new policy in 2014.

In the past several years, however, All Elite Wrestling has used blading semi-frequently by way of specific wrestlers like Jon Moxley and Adam Page. AEW also has been known for promoting hardcore and death matches involving barbed wire, thumbtacks, and broken glass, giving more of an incentive for the wrestlers to blade to give the appearance of being wounded by the various weapons. One infamous instance involved Nick Gage cutting Chris Jericho&#x27;s forehead with a pizza cutter during a picture-in-picture advertisement that coincedentally was promoting Domino&#x27;s Pizza at the same time.

==Examples==
One of the most famous such incidents was a bladejob performed by Japanese wrestler The Great Muta in a 1992 match with Hiroshi Hase; the amount of blood Muta lost was so great that many people to this day judge the severity of bladejobs on the &quot;Muta Scale&quot;.

Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) was famous for their hardcore style wrestling employing excessive usage of blading. By far the most controversial incident relating to blading was the Mass Transit incident at an ECW house show on November 23, 1996. During a scheduled tag team match between the team of Axl Rotten and D-Von Dudley versus the team of New Jack and Mustafa Saed, Axl Rotten could not make the show and was replaced by 17-year-old fan Erich Kulas, who lied about both his age (claiming to be 21) and wrestling experience. Before the match, Kulas asked New Jack, who was notorious for his stiff hardcore wrestling style and for shooting on opponents, to blade him, since he never had done it himself, and New Jack agreed. New Jack bladed Kulas with a surgical scalpel but cut too deeply and severed two arteries in Kulas&#x27; forehead. Kulas screamed in pain, then passed out as blood poured from his head, and was later hospitalized. The incident generated much negative publicity and a lawsuit by Kulas&#x27;s family, where New Jack was charged but the Jury dropped all charges as the blading was done per Kulas&#x27;s request and Kulas had lied about his age. Erich Kulas later died on May 12, 2002, but no connection was made between his death and the incident.

During an interview on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Mickey Rourke spoke about his experience with gigging himself for a scene in the 2008 movie &quot;The Wrestler&quot;. Rourke agreed to gig at the initial request of director Darren Aronofsky in hopes that he would revoke the demand come production time. Indeed, later during filming, Aronofsky admitted that Rourke needn&#x27;t actually gig; however, by his own will, Rourke decided to go through with it anyway. In the film itself, Rourke&#x27;s character is seen preparing for a match by wrapping a razor blade inside his wrist tape.

There is one notable incident of blading in association football. In 1989, Chile national team goalkeeper Roberto Rojas bladed himself to prevent a loss, by blaming the injury on fireworks thrown by opposing fans. FIFA saw through the ruse and ended up banning Rojas for life and banning Chile from the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Rojas&#x27;s ban was lifted in 2001.

Canadian wrestler Devon Nicholson pressed charges against Abdullah the Butcher, claiming that he contracted hepatitis C after Abdullah bladed him without consent. An Ontario court ruled in favor of Nicholson and ordered Abdullah to pay $2.3 million.

During their King of the Road match at Uncensored 1995, Dustin Rhodes and The Blacktop Bully bladed, which was against the policy of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) at the time, and they were both fired as a result.

<text>The Janjaweed (; also transliterated &quot;Janjaweed&quot;) are an Arab nomad militia group operating in the Sahel region that operates in Sudan, particularly in Darfur and eastern Chad. They have also been speculated to be active in Yemen. According to the United Nations definition, Janjaweed membership consists of Arab nomad tribes from the Sahel, the core of whom are Abbala Arabs, traditionally employed in camel herding, with significant recruitment from the Baggara. 

Janjaweed nomads were initially at odds with Darfur&#x27;s sedentary population due to competition over natural grazing grounds and farmland, a conflict exacerbated by dwindling rainfall and drought. The Janjaweed were a major player in the Darfur conflict between 2003 and 2020, in opposition to the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and the Justice and Equality Movement rebels. In 2013, the Rapid Support Forces grew out of the Janjaweed.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the word &quot;Janjaweed&quot; is unclear. It may derive from the Arabic words &quot;jinn&quot; () and &quot;ʾajāwīd&quot; (), and thus has been translated into English by some sources as &quot;devils on horseback&quot;. Other sources suggest it may derive from the Persian word &quot;jangavi&quot; (), or a portmanteau of three words: (&quot;jan&quot;) from English &quot;gun&quot;; &quot;jinn&quot;; and &quot;ʾajāwīd.&quot; According to Darfuris, &quot;Janjaweed&quot; is a word from the Chadian dialect of Arabic that is used for criminals, naughty people, unruly children, etc. The word &quot;Janjaweed&quot; was used by François Tombalbaye, the Christian President of Chad, to marginalize his Muslim political opponents.

==History==

In Darfur, a western state in Sudan, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi supported the creation of the Tajammu al-Arabi (Arab Gathering) militia, which was described by Gérard Prunier as &quot;a militantly racist and pan-Arabist organization which stressed the &#x27;Arab&#x27; character of the province&quot;. The Arab Gathering shared members and a source of support with the Islamic Legion, and the distinction between the two is often ambiguous.

The nearly continuous cross-border raids contributed to a separate ethnic conflict within Darfur that killed about 9,000 people between 1985 and 1988. The Janjaweed leadership has some background in Gaddafi&#x27;s mercenary forces.

The Janjaweed first appeared in 1988 after Chadian president Hissène Habré, backed by France and the United States, defeated the Libyan army. Gaddafi&#x27;s Chadian protégé, Acheikh Ibn-Oumar, retreated with his partisan forces to Darfur, where they were hosted by Sheikh Musa Hilal, the newly elevated chief of the Rizeigat Arab tribes of north Darfur. Hilal&#x27;s tribesmen had earlier smuggled Libyan weapons to Ibn-Oumar&#x27;s forces. A French-Chadian incursion destroyed Ibn-Oumar&#x27;s camp, but his weapons remained with his Mahamid hosts.

Throughout the 1990s, the Janjaweed were Arab partisans who pursued a local agenda of controlling land, and were tolerated by the Sudan Government. The majority of Darfur&#x27;s Arabs, the Baggara, became involved in the war over grazing territory. In 1999–2000, faced with threats of insurgency in Western and Northern Darfur, Khartoum&#x27;s security armed the Janjaweed forces.
As the insurgency escalated in February 2003, spearheaded by the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army and the Justice and Equality Movement, the Sudanese government responded by using the Janjaweed as its main counter-insurgency force. Janjaweed forces were ordered to attack and recover the rebel-held areas of Darfur, conducting a campaign against rebels in Darfur. In 2004, the U.S. State Department and others named leading Janjaweed commanders, including Musa Hilal, as genocide suspects. By early 2006, many Janjaweed had been absorbed into the Sudan Armed Forces including the Popular Defense Forces and Border Guards. Meanwhile, the Janjaweed expanded to include some Arab tribes in eastern Darfur who were not historically associated with the original Janjaweed. A political base was also reestablished in Chad as part of the United Front for Democratic Change (FUC) coalition.

By October 2007, only the United States government had declared the Janjaweed killings in Darfur to be genocide, since they had killed an estimated 200,000–400,000 civilians over the previous three years. The UN Security Council called for the Janjaweed to be disarmed. On 14 July 2008, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court filed genocide charges against Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, accusing him of masterminding attempts to wipe out African tribes in Darfur with a campaign of murder, rape and deportation.

In 2013, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were formed from the Janjaweed to fight against rebel groups in Darfur, South Kordofan, and Blue Nile.
=== Civil war ===
In 2023, international diplomats insisted that the RSF merge into the Sudanese Army as part of the Sudanese transition to democracy. By April 2023, power struggles developed between Sudan&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; national leader, army commander Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the leader of the RSF, Hemedti. On 15 April 2023, clashes between RSF and army forces erupted across the country. 

By the second day of the conflict, 78 people had been reported killed. Among the dead were three World Food Programme (WFP) workers, triggering the organization to suspend its work in Sudan, where it had been a principal force in alleviating hunger. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres demanded immediate justice for the killings and called for an end to the conflict.

Diplomats from the African Union and Saudi Arabia mediated a three-hour humanitarian ceasefire to permit the evacuation of the injured. Despite this, the battles continued, as both sides claimed to have seized control of key sites in and around the capital city.

<text>Bernhard &quot;Bernd&quot; Becher (; 20 August 1931 – 22 June 2007), and [[Hilla Becher]], née Wobeser (2 September 1934 – 10 October 2015), were German conceptual artists and photographers working as a collaborative duo. They are best known for their extensive series of photographic images, or typologies, of industrial buildings and structures, often organised in grids. As the founders of what has come to be known as the &#x27;Becher school&#x27; or the Düsseldorf School of Photography, they influenced generations of documentary photographers and artists in Germany and abroad. They were awarded the Erasmus Prize and the Hasselblad Award.

==Biography==
Bernd Becher was born in Siegen. He studied painting at the Staatliche Akademie der Bildenden Künste Stuttgart from 1953 to 1956, then typography under Karl Rössing at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1959 to 1961. Hilla Becher was born in Potsdam. Prior to Hilla&#x27;s time studying photography at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf from 1958 to 1961, she had completed an apprenticeship as a photographer in her native Potsdam. Both began working as freelance photographers for the Troost Advertising Agency in Düsseldorf, concentrating on product photography. They got married in 1961. The German-American photographer Max Becher (born 1964) is their son.

==Work==
Meeting as students at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in 1957, Bernd and Hilla Becher first collaborated on photographing and documenting the disappearing German industrial architecture in 1959. The Ruhr Valley, where Becher&#x27;s family had worked in the steel and mining industries, was their initial focus. They were fascinated by the similar shapes in which certain buildings were designed. After collating thousands of pictures of individual structures, they noticed that the various edifices – of cooling towers, gas tanks and coal bunkers, for instance – shared many distinctive formal qualities. In addition, they were intrigued by the fact that so many of these industrial buildings seemed to have been built with a great deal of attention toward design.

Together, the Bechers first photographed with a 6x9cm camera and then (after 1961) mostly with a large format Plaubel Peco 13x18-centimeter (5x7-inch) monorail camera. They photographed these buildings from a number of different angles, but always with a straightforward &quot;objective&quot; point of view. The adjustable standards of the monorail camera enabled them perspective control to maintain parallel lines in their photographs. They used a range of optics from 90mm wide-angle lenses to 600mm telephoto lenses to make similar subjects appear similarly sized despite not being able to always photograph from the same distances. They chose to work in black and white both because of its capacity to capture three-dimensional volume without the distraction of color, and its reliability and cost in relation to the sensitized color materials at the time. After working with 13x18-centimeter glass photographic plates, they shifted to 25 ASA film speed negative sheet film around 1970. They typically made two exposures for each view, with a range of exposure times from 10 seconds to a minute. The Bechers shared darkroom tasks, with Bernd developing the negatives, and Hilla making the prints. To make the sky appear white in their prints, they often photographed on overcast days but optimized their lighting for each subject (using a blue filter when the sky was blue), or photographed early in the morning during the seasons of spring and fall. Their subjects included framework houses (timber framing), barns, water towers, coal tipples, cooling towers, grain elevators, coal bunkers, coke ovens, oil refineries, blast furnaces, gas tanks, storage silos, and warehouses. At each site the Bechers also created overall landscape photographs of the entire plant, which set the structures in their context and show how they relate to each other. They excluded any details that would detract from the central theme and instead set up comparisons of viewpoint and lighting through which the eye is led to the basic structural pattern of the images being compared. This principle, which is allied to the philosophy underlying the New Topographics movement, is most obvious in the two published series, 
&quot;Anonyme Skulpturen: Eine Typologie technischer Bauten&quot; and &quot;Typologien, Industrieller Bau, 1963–1975&quot;, in which the images are contrasted in groups of three. Another early project, which they pursued for nearly two decades, was published as &quot;Framework Houses&quot; (Schirmer/Mosel) in 1977, a visual catalog of types of structures, an approach that characterized much of their work.

In drawing attention to the cultural dimension of industrial architecture, their work also highlighted the need for preservation of these buildings. On the couple&#x27;s initiative the Zollern II/IV Colliery at Dortmund-Bovinghausen in the Ruhr, a historicism structure with the exception of the machine hall (Art Nouveau), was designated a protected landmark.

The Bechers also photographed outside Germany, including from 1965 buildings in Great Britain, France, Belgium and later in the United States. In 1966, they undertook a six-month journey through England and south Wales, taking hundreds of photographs of the coal industry around Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, Nottingham and the Rhondda Valley. In 1974, they traveled to North America for the first time, touring sites in New Jersey, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and southern Ontario, depicting a range of industrial structures, from coal breakers to wooden winding towers.

The Bechers exhibited and published their single-image gelatin silver prints, grouped by subject, in a grid of six, nine, or fifteen. By the mid-1960s the Bechers had settled on a preferred presentational mode: the images of structures with similar functions are then displayed side by side to invite viewers to compare their forms and designs based on function, regional idiosyncrasies, or the age of the structures. The Bechers used the term &quot;typology&quot; to describe these ordered sets of photographs. The works&#x27; titles are pithy and captions note only time and location. In 1989–91, for an exhibition at the Dia Art Foundation in New York, the Bechers introduced a second format into their oeuvre: single images that are larger in size — twenty-four by twenty inches — and presented individually, rather than as gridded tableaux.

In 1976, Bernd Becher started teaching photography at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf (policy matters prevented Hilla&#x27;s simultaneous appointment), where he remained on the faculty until 1996. Before him, photography had been excluded from what was largely a school for painters. He influenced students that later made a name for themselves in the photography world. Former students of Bernd&#x27;s included Andreas Gursky, Thomas Ruff, Thomas Struth, Candida Höfer, Axel Hütte and Elger Esser. Bernd died in Rostock.

After Bernd Becher&#x27;s death, his widow Hilla continued to reassemble their works, mostly using existing photographs.

==Exhibitions==
The Bechers had their first gallery exhibition in 1963 at the Galerie Ruth Nohl in Siegen. Their work became better known in the United States with the publication of their book &quot;Anonyme Skulpturen&quot; (Anonymous Sculptures) in 1970. The Bechers were shown at the George Eastman House and in solo exhibitions at Sonnabend Gallery, New York, in 1972. In 1974, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London, organized an exhibition of their work, which toured the United Kingdom. The couple was invited to participate in Documenta 5, 6, 7, and 11 in Kassel in 1972, 1977, 1982 and 2002, and at the Bienal de São Paulo in 1977. The Stedelijk Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven, organized a retrospective of the artists&#x27; work in 1981. In 1985 the artists had a major museum exhibition, which traveled to the Museum Folkwang, Essen, Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Liège, Belgium. In 1991 the artists won the Leone d&#x27;Oro award for sculpture at the Venice Biennale. The Venice installation was reworked later in 1991, in a retrospective exhibition at the Kölnischer Kunstverein, Cologne. The Typologies installation was exhibited in 1994 at the Ydessa Hendeles Art Foundation, Toronto, and at the Westfälisches Landesmuseum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte in Münster. Other retrospectives of the couple&#x27;s work have been organized by the Photographische Sammlung/SK Stiftung Kulture in Cologne (1999 and 2003), Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris (2005) and Museum of Modern Art in New York (2008).

In 2014, Hilla Becher curated &quot;August Sander/Bernd and Hilla Becher: &#x27;A Dialogue at Bruce Silverstein Gallery in New York. Unlike previous displays, the Bechers&#x27; architectural images were displayed as singular &quot;portraits&quot; while Sander&#x27;s photographs of people were represented as typological grids. In 2022, the Metropolitan Museum of Art held a major retrospective of their photographic oeuvre, which received &quot;blockbuster&quot; reviews from major art critics.

==Legacy==
The Becher school has influenced a number of (mainly) German photographers including Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth, Thomas Ruff, Candida Höfer, Laurenz Berges, Bernhard Fuchs, Axel Hütte, Simone Nieweg, and Petra Wunderlich. The Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky also drews inspiration from the duo and works in a similar mode. Aside from its vital documentary and analytical qualities, the Bechers&#x27; long-term project has also had a considerable impact on Minimalism and Conceptual Art since the 1970s.

The highest price reached by one of the duo&#x27;s works was when &quot;Water Towers&quot; (1972), a grid of nine photographs, sold by $441,940, at Sotheby&#x27;s Paris, on 15 November 2015.

<text>6to4 is an Internet transition mechanism for migrating from Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) to version 6 (IPv6) and a system that allows IPv6 packets to be transmitted over an IPv4 network (generally the IPv4 Internet) without the need to configure explicit tunnels. Special relay servers are also in place that allow 6to4 networks to communicate with native IPv6 networks.

6to4 is especially relevant during the initial phases of deployment to full, native IPv6 connectivity, since IPv6 is not required on nodes between the host and the destination. However, it is intended only as a transition mechanism and is not meant to be used permanently.

6to4 may be used by an individual host, or by a local IPv6 network. When used by a host, it must have a global IPv4 address connected, and the host is responsible for encapsulation of outgoing IPv6 packets and decapsulation of incoming 6to4 packets. If the host is configured to forward packets for other clients, often a local network, it is then a router.

Most IPv6 networks use autoconfiguration, which requires the last 64 bits of the address for the host. The first 64 bits are the IPv6 prefix. The first 16 bits of the prefix are always :, the next 32 bits are the IPv4 address, and the last 16 bits of the prefix are available for addressing multiple IPv6 subnets behind the same 6to4 router. Since the IPv6 hosts using autoconfiguration already have determined the unique 64 bit host portion of their address, they must simply wait for a Router Advertisement indicating the first 64 bits of prefix to have a complete IPv6 address. A 6to4 router will know to send an encapsulated packet directly over IPv4 if the first 16 bits are , using the next 32 as the destination, or otherwise send the packet to a well-known relay server, which has access to native IPv6.

6to4 &quot;does not&quot; facilitate interoperation between IPv4-only hosts and IPv6-only hosts (for that, see NAT64). 6to4 is simply a transparent mechanism used as a transport layer between IPv6 nodes.

Due to the high levels of misconfigured hosts and poor performance observed, an advisory about how 6to4 should be deployed was published in August 2011. Due to unsolvable operational problems using the 6to4 anycast prefix, that part of the standard was deprecated in 2015.

==How 6to4 works==

6to4 performs three functions:

* Assigns a block of IPv6 address space to any host or network that has a global IPv4 address.
* Encapsulates IPv6 packets inside IPv4 packets for transmission over an IPv4 network using 6in4.
* Routes traffic between 6to4 and &quot;native&quot; IPv6 networks.

===Address block allocation===

For any 32-bit global IPv4 address that is assigned to a host, a 48-bit 6to4 IPv6 prefix can be constructed for use by that host (and if applicable the network behind it) by appending the IPv4 address to .

For example, the global IPv4 address has the corresponding 6to4 prefix . This gives a prefix length of 48 bits, which leaves room for a 16-bit subnet field and 64 bit host addresses within the subnets.

Any IPv6 address that begins with the prefix (in other words, any address with the first two octets of 2002 hexadecimal) is known as a 6to4 address, as opposed to a &quot;native IPv6 address&quot; which does not systematically use transition technologies.

Note that using a reserved IPv4 address, such as those provided by , is undefined, since these networks are disallowed from being routed on the public Internet. For example, using as the router&#x27;s WAN address would be invalid since a return packet would not be able to determine the destination IPv4 address of the actual sender.

===Encapsulation and transmission===
6to4 embeds an IPv6 packet in the payload portion of an IPv4 packet with protocol type 41. To send an IPv6 packet over an IPv4 network to a 6to4 destination address, an IPv4 header with protocol type 41 is prepended to the IPv6 packet. The IPv4 destination address for the prepended packet header is derived from the IPv6 destination address of the inner packet (which is in the format of a 6to4 address), by extracting the 32 bits immediately following the IPv6 destination address&#x27;s prefix. The IPv4 source address in the prepended packet header is the IPv4 address of the host or router which is sending the packet over IPv4. The resulting IPv4 packet is then routed to its IPv4 destination address just like any other IPv4 packet.

===Routing between 6to4 and native IPv6===
To allow hosts and networks using 6to4 addresses to exchange traffic with hosts using &quot;native&quot; IPv6 addresses, &quot;relay routers&quot; have been established. A relay router connects to an IPv4 network and an IPv6 network. 6to4 packets arriving on an IPv4 interface will have their IPv6 payloads routed to the IPv6 network, while packets arriving on the IPv6 interface with a destination address prefix of will be encapsulated and forwarded over the IPv4 network.

There is a difference between a &quot;relay router&quot; and a &quot;border router&quot; (also known as a &quot;6to4 border router&quot;). A 6to4 border router is an IPv6 router supporting a 6to4 pseudo-interface. It is normally the border router between an IPv6 site and a wide-area IPv4 network, where the IPv6 site uses co-related to the IPv4 address used later on. On the other hand, a &quot;relay router&quot; is a 6to4 router configured to support transit routing between 6to4 addresses and pure native IPv6 addresses.

To allow a 6to4 host to communicate with the native IPv6 Internet, it must have its IPv6 default gateway set to a 6to4 address which contains the IPv4 address of a 6to4 relay router. To avoid the need for users to set this up manually, the anycast address used to be allocated. It could be assigned to any number of 6to4 relay routers, so that IPv4 routing would take care of routing the encapsulated IPv6 packets to the one closest-by for forwarding onto IPv6 Internet. Due to unsolvable operational problems, this use has been deprecated.

Packets from the IPv6 Internet to 6to4 systems must be sent to a 6to4 relay router by normal IPv6 routing methods. The specification states that such relay routers must only advertise and not subdivisions of it to prevent IPv4 routes polluting the routing tables of IPv6 routers. From here they can then be sent over the IPv4 Internet to the destination.

For a 6to4 host to have fast and reliable connectivity with a host natively using the IPv6 Internet, both the 6to4 host and the native IPv6 host must have a route to a fast, reliable and correctly configured relay server. The 6to4 host&#x27;s ISP can ensure that outgoing packets go to such a relay, but they have no control over the relay used for the responses from the native IPv6 host. A variant called IPv6 rapid deployment (&quot;6rd&quot;) uses the same basic principles as 6to4 but uses a relay operated by the 6rd user&#x27;s ISP for traffic in both directions. To achieve this an address block allocated by the user&#x27;s ISP is used instead of .

==Reverse DNS delegation==
When a site using 6to4 has a fixed global IPv4 address, its 6to4 IPv6 prefix is also fixed. It is then possible to request reverse DNS delegation for an individual 6to4 48-bits prefix inside the codice_1 DNS zone from the Number Resource Organization at 6to4.nro.net. The process is entirely automatic.

==Security considerations==
According to , 6to4 routers and relays should ensure that:

* either or both the source and destination addresses of any encapsulated packet is within the 6to4 IPv6 prefix ,
* if the source IPv6 address is a 6to4 IPv6 address, its corresponding 6to4 router IPv4 address matches the IPv4 source address in the IPv4 encapsulation header,
* similarly, if the destination IPv6 address is a 6to4 IPv6 address, its corresponding 6to4 router IPv4 address matches the IPv4 destination address in the IPv4 encapsulation header,
* any embedded 6to4 router IPv4 address is global unicast.

== Software support ==
=== Microsoft Windows ===
6to4 has been default disabled since the Anniversary Update. It is no longer being actively supported and might be removed in a future release.

In the opening phase of the Wars of the Roses he raised troops from his estates in Cheshire, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Derbyshire and commanded the Lancastrian force that moved to block the Yorkist Earl of Salisbury&#x27;s route to Ludlow where he intended linking up with the rest of the Yorkist army.

The two forces clashed in the Battle of Blore Heath on 23 September 1459 and Audley was killed by Sir Roger Kynaston of Stocks near Ellesmere (Kynaston incorporated emblems of the Audley coat-of-arms into his own). Audley&#x27;s Cross still stands on the battlefield marking the spot where he died.

Audley was buried in Darley Abbey, north of Derby, about away from Blore Heath. The Abbey no longer stands, so his final resting place is no longer marked.

==Marriages and children==
Audley married twice:
*Firstly, having obtained a marriage licence dated 24 February 1415, to Margaret de Ros (c. 1400 - before 14 February 1430), daughter of Margaret FitzAlan (D&#x27;Arundel) and her husband William de Ros, 6th Baron de Ros. They were granted a Papal Dispensation for being related in the 3rd and 4th degrees of kindred. Together they had three children: 
**John Tuchet, 6th Baron Audley (c. 1426 - 26 September 1490), son and heir.
**Elizabeth Touchet (c. 1420 - before 8 November 1464), who married Edward Brooke, 6th Baron Cobham. 
**Anne Touchet (c. 1424 - 1503), who married Sir Thomas Dutton, who died at the Battle of Blore Heath (1459) along with his father-in-law. 
*Secondly, having obtained a marriage licence on 14 September 1430, he married Eleanor de Holland, an illegitimate daughter of Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent and his mistress Constance of York, daughter of Infanta Isabella of Castile and Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York. They too were granted a Papal Dispensation, as they were related in the 3rd and 3rd degrees of affinity. With Eleanor de Holland he had a further seven children as follows: 
**Sir Humphrey Touchet (c. 1434 - 6 May 1471), who married Elizabeth Courtenay, widow of Sir James Luttrell (1426/7-1461) of Dunster Castle in Somerset, feudal baron of Dunster, (who died fighting for the Lancastrian cause at the Battle of St Albans in 1461) and a daughter of Sir Philip Courtenay (1404–1463) of Powderham in Devon. Like his father, he supported the House of Lancaster. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Tewkesbury and tried before Richard, Duke of Gloucester and the Duke of Norfolk. Executed with other Lancastrian leaders in the Market Square he was buried under the pavement in the Chapel of St Nicolas, in the Abbey Church of St Mary the Virgin.
**Thomas Touchet (c. 1440 - June 1507), who married a certain Catherine.
**Edmund Audley (c. 1443 - 23 August 1524), who served successively Bishop of Rochester, Bishop of Hereford and Bishop of Salisbury. 
**Margaret Touchet (c. 1431 - before 2 February 1481), who at some time before 12 January 1459 married Richard Grey, 3rd Earl of Tankerville, son of Sir Henry Grey, 2nd Earl of Tankerville and Antigone Plantagenet. 
**Constance Touchet (born c. 1432), who in 1464 married (as his second wife) Sir Robert Whitney (born 1436 - aft. 1467), an active participant in the Wars of the Roses, son of Eustace Whitney and Jennet Trussell and widower of Alice Vaughn, daughter of Thomas Vaughn.
**Eleanor Touchet (born circa 1442), who married Humphrey Grey, son of Sir Henry Grey, 2nd Earl of Tankerville and Antigone Plantagenet, in 1460. 
**Anne Touchet (born circa 1446), who married Sir Richard Delabere.

<text>Fuck is an American indie rock band, formed in Oakland, California in 1993. It consists of Timothy Prudhomme, Geoff Soule, Kyle Statham and Theodore Ellison. They have recorded for a number of labels including Matador Records and Homesleep Records of Italy.

==History==
Fuck was formed in Oakland, California in 1993. The members met while stuck in a police holding cell over the weekend, and wrote a few songs while in jail. They released a self-titled cassette called &quot;Fuck&quot;, and a single, &quot;MonkeyBeautyShotgun&quot; on their own imprint, Rhesus Records, in 1994. (The songs from the cassette would eventually find their way onto later releases.) They released their second full-length album, &quot;Pretty...Slow,&quot; in 1996. It was subsequently released on three different labels. Their third album, &quot;Baby Loves a Funny Bunny&quot;, was also released in 1996.

They then signed to Matador Records, who released the albums &quot;Pardon My French&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Conduct&quot; in 1998. According to Timothy Prudhomme, a Matador marketing director told them that they needed to change the band&#x27;s name, but they refused.

After &quot;Conduct&quot;, the band left Matador and drifted between labels. In 2001, they released two albums on two different labels: &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Cactus,&quot; on Steve Shelley&#x27;s independent label Smells Like Records; and &quot;Gold Bricks,&quot; on Homesleep Records in 2001. &quot;Those Are Not My Bongos&quot; was released in 2003 on both Homesleep and Future Farmer Records; the latter re released it the U.S. in 2004.

The song &quot;Laundry Shop&quot; from &quot;Conduct&quot; was featured (uncredited) in a 2006 episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;.

In November 2008, the band participated with other similarly named bands, including Holy Fuck, Fucked Up, and Fuck Buttons in the &quot;Festival of the Fuck Bands&quot; music festival in the village of Fucking, Austria.

In 2018, Fuck released &quot;The Band&quot;, their first LP in 14 years.

To date, Fuck has performed over 400 live shows and recorded on nine labels. Prudhomme currently lives in Memphis and the rest of the band lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<text>Conway&#x27;s LUX method for magic squares is an algorithm by John Horton Conway for creating magic squares of order 4&quot;n&quot;+2, where &quot;n&quot; is a natural number.

==Method==
Start by creating a (2&quot;n&quot;+1)-by-(2&quot;n&quot;+1) square array consisting of 
* &quot;n&quot;+1 rows of Ls,
* 1 row of Us, and
* &quot;n&quot;-1 rows of Xs,
and then exchange the U in the middle with the L above it.

Each letter represents a 2x2 block of numbers in the finished square.

Now replace each letter by four consecutive numbers, starting with 1, 2, 3, 4 in the centre square of the top row, and moving from block to block in the manner of the Siamese method: move up and right, wrapping around the edges, and move down whenever you are obstructed. Fill each 2x2 block according to the order prescribed by the letter:

:formula_1

==Example==
Let &quot;n&quot; = 2, so that the array is 5x5 and the final square is 10x10.

Start with the L in the middle of the top row, move to the 4th X in the bottom row, then to the U at the end of the 4th row, then the L at the beginning of the 3rd row, etc.

<text>Wonder What&#x27;s Next is the second studio album by American rock band Chevelle, released on October 8, 2002 by Epic Records. Spawning the singles &quot;The Red&quot;, &quot;Send the Pain Below&quot;, and &quot;Closure&quot;, it proved to be Chevelle&#x27;s breakthrough album, landing them high-profile tour slots including the main stage of Ozzfest 2003. Having sold over two million copies in the United States alone, &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; remains the band&#x27;s most successful album.

==Background and recording==
After experiencing label troubles, Chevelle&#x27;s management set up a showcase in New York. The group received three offers, ultimately choosing Epic. After debating between GGGarth and Ben Gross, they enlisted Garth to produce their sophomore album. Recording was scheduled at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver to begin the day following the September 11 attacks. With a tragic event having just taken place in the band&#x27;s home country, they were met with an unsettling start to the recording process. The band spent nine weeks at the spacious studio.

&quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; would feature a heavier, more textured sound than its predecessor, which, according to frontman Pete Loeffler, was &quot;more indie&quot; and didn&#x27;t effectively capture the band&#x27;s intensity. While Chevelle&#x27;s debut album was recorded in standard D tuning, the band switched to drop B, with some songs written in standard D♭ tuning. The band also spent much more time adjusting tones and preparing before recording, as opposed to the less refined studio process of working with Steve Albini. Ben Kaplan, the Pro Tools editor, also took a liberal approach to adding textures underneath much of the music. The band was at first uneasy with this approach but came to appreciate the influence it had on the overall sound. However, the track &quot;One Lonely Visitor&quot; breaks from this with its bare-bones approach; a demo was recorded in a home studio, but after rerecording it with Garth in Vancouver, Loeffler still favored the original, less-produced version for its more natural feel and convinced the label to use it. The same method would be used on the final track of their follow-up album in 2004.

==Touring and promotion==
&quot;The Red&quot; served as the album&#x27;s lead single. It had an accompanying music video depicting an anger management seminar and gained heavy rotation on MTV2. &quot;Send the Pain Below&quot; provided an even more successful follow-up single by reaching No. 1 on two charts. It, too, had an accompanying video revolving around a snowboarder. A final single was released in September 2003 with &quot;Closure.&quot; The moody track landed spots in the top 20 of both aforementioned charts and had a video featuring concert footage from live version of the song.

Leading up to the album&#x27;s release, Chevelle toured the United States with Local H and Burning Brides from March through May 2002. They then joined Ozzfest from July through September. For the remainder of the year, Chevelle continued touring the US with Stone Sour and Sinch. Chevelle also performed &quot;The Red&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn&quot; on November 8.

The band toured Europe with Audioslave in early 2003 before returning to the US. In the spring, they played on Music as a Weapon II with fellow Chicago-based headliners Disturbed. Chevelle later appeared on the tour compilation album &quot;Music as a Weapon II&quot;, featuring the songs &quot;The Red&quot; and &quot;Forfeit.&quot; The band appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; to perform &quot;Send the Pain Below&quot; on May 20.

From June through August, Chevelle performed on the main stage of Ozzfest, where they recorded and later released the live album &quot;Live from the Road&quot; and the live DVD &quot;Live from the Norva&quot;. Starting in November, the band performed radio gigs until the end of the year, when they took a several-month break from touring to begin writing their next album.

==Critical reception==
Reviews for &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; were generally positive. Brian O&#x27;Neill of Allmusic noted how the band demonstrates an &quot;indie rock mindset&quot; in spite of the album&#x27;s slick production. He added &quot;Chevelle managed to retain its credibility yet still put out 11 tracks that, while still catchy, offer uniqueness not often heard in more commercial fare, no mean feat.&quot; MusicOMH&#x27;s Tom Day described the band&#x27;s sound as comparable to the likes of Helmet, Tool, and Deftones and summed up by stating, &quot;there are no qualms with the high calibre, heavy rock that Chevelle have served up here.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album&#x27;s first single &quot;The Red&quot; was released far in advance in July 2002. It met with significant radio airplay and charted highly on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts. Its music video also gained significant TV rotation. In October, the album debuted at number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Its second single &quot;Send the Pain Below&quot; attained even greater success than its predecessor in January 2003, reaching number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks and Modern Rock Tracks charts. To round off promotion of &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot;, &quot;Closure&quot; was released as the third and final single far later in September to substantial success.

By mid-2003, &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; had sold over one million copies in the US alone. The following year, it had reached 1.3 million. By mid-2020, it has sold over two million copies.

<doc id="683295" wikidata="Q4578161" url="?curid=683295" title="1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention">
<text>The 1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention is considered the watershed political event in the modern State of Hawaii. It was convened on July 5, 1978. The convention established term limits for state office holders, provided a requirement for an annual balanced budget, laid the groundwork for the return of federal land such as the island of Kahoolawe, and created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs in an effort to right the wrongs done towards native Hawaiians since the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893. The event also created an ambitious project of preservation of the Hawaiian culture including the adoption of Hawaiian diacritical marks for official usage, use of Hawaiian names, etc. The Hawaiian language became the official state language of Hawaii for the first time since the overthrow.

Based upon language the US Supreme Court had used to legalize abortion and birth control, the convention added the text: &quot;the right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.&quot; This text makes the state constitution one of only five in the US that explicitly define a right to privacy.

== Political legacy ==
A major outgrowth of the constitutional convention was the launching of the political careers of those who would later dominate Hawaiian politics. Delegates to the convention included:

* Carol Fukunaga, future legislative leader
* Gerald T. Hagino, future legislator
* Helene Hale, future legislative leader
* Thomas H. Hamilton, president of the University of Hawaii
* Jeremy Harris, future Mayor of Honolulu
* Clarice Y. Hashimoto, future legislator
* Charlene Hoe, founder of Hakipuʻu Learning Center
* Les Ihara, Jr., future legislative leader
* Barbara Marumoto, future legislative leader
* Lehua Fernandes Salling, future legislator
* Joseph M. Souki, future Speaker of the House
* Jim Shon, future legislator
* John David Waiheʻe III, future Governor

<text>In Manx folklore, a (or &quot;boagane&quot;) was a huge ogre-like creature native to the Isle of Man. Some have considered them akin to the Scandinavian troll.

==Manx folklore==

A shapeshifter, the buggane is generally described as a malevolent being that can appear as a large black calf or human with ears or hooves of a horse. It was large enough to tear the roof off a church. Its natural form is described as &quot;covered with a mane of coarse, black hair; it had eyes like torches, and glittering sharp tusks&quot;. Another tale describes it as a huge man with bull&#x27;s horns, glowing eyes and large teeth.

As magical creatures, bugganes were unable to cross water or stand on hallowed ground.

===St Trinian&#x27;s Church===

The most famous story recounts a buggane who found himself an inadvertent stowaway on a ship bound for Ireland. Determined to return to the Isle of Man, he caused a storm and guided the ship towards the rocky coast of Contrary Head. His plan was interdicted through the intervention of St. Trinian. Invoked by the captain with a promise to build a chapel in his honour, the saint guided the ship safely into Peel Harbour. Incensed, the buggane screamed, &quot;St. Trinian should never have a whole church in Ellan Vannin.&quot; When the chapel came to be built, three times the local people put a roof on, and three times the buggane tore it off.

The &quot;Buggan ny Hushtey&quot; lived in a large cave near the sea and was known for having no liking for lazy people. However, it should not be confused with the Cabbyl-ushtey, the Manx water horse.

Bugganes were occasionally called upon by the fairies to punish people that had offended them. The buggane of Glen Maye would have pitched a lazy housewife into a waterfall for putting off baking until after sunset, had she not cut loose the strings of her apron to escape. The buggane from Gob-na-Scuit was known for tearing the thatch off the haystacks, puffing the smoke down chimneys, and pushing sheep over the edge of the brooghs (a steep bank or grassy cliff).

===Finn MacCool and the Buggane===
In Manx legend, the Irish giant Fionn mac Cumhaill (Finn MacCool) crossed over to Mann and settled near Cregneash. The buggane from Barrule came to do battle, but Fionn did not want to fight. Fionn&#x27;s wife, Oonagh, disguised Fionn as a baby and tucked him into a cradle. When the buggane saw the size of the &#x27;baby&#x27;, he thought that its father, Fionn, must be a giant among giants, and so he left. They eventually met near Kirk Christ Rushen and fought from sunrise to sunset. Fionn had one foot in the Big Sound, and so made the channel between the Calf of Man and Kitterland, and the other foot was in the Little Sound, and so he made the narrow channel between Kitterland and the main island. The buggane was standing at Port Erin. He came off victorious and slashed Fionn awfully, so that he had to run to Ireland. Fionn could walk on the sea, but the buggane could not, so he tore out a tooth and threw it at Fionn. It hit him on the back of the head, and then it fell into the sea and became what is now called Chicken Rock. Fionn turned round and roared a mighty curse, &quot;My seven swearings of a curse on it!&quot; &quot;Let it lie there for a vexation to the sons of men while water runs and grass grows!&quot;
And so it has. The Irish version of the story has Fionn&#x27;s adversary a giant from Scotland.

<doc id="683318" wikidata="Q847680" url="?curid=683318" title="Brokopondo District">
<text>Brokopondo is a district of Suriname. Its capital city is Brokopondo; other towns include Brownsweg and Kwakoegron.

The district has a population of 15,909, and an area of 7,364 square kilometres.

==History==
The Brokopondo district was established in 1959 out of the former Suriname District. The establishment of the district was related to the 1958 Brokopondo Agreement between the Government of Suriname and Alcoa for the creation of the Brokopondo Reservoir. The Brokopondo Reservoir is a large reservoir near Afobaka which was built between 1961 and 1964, and produces hydroelectric power that provides approximately half of the domestic electrical need.

The plan was very controversial, and involved transmigrating many villages that were located in the area and flooded after the construction of the Afobaka Dam. The transmigration concerned 5,000 people which were almost exclusively Maroons. In 1960, the Avobakaweg was constructed to link the reservoir with Paramaribo and the rest of the country. In 1983, the Districts were redrawn, and most of the tribal interior of Suriname was moved into the Sipaliwini District.

The Brokopondo Development Plan has designated the town of Brokopondo and Brownsweg as the two major centres in the region with a focus on tourism. Both towns lack a proper city centre, and will be redevelopment in the early 21st century.

==Nature==

The district has several waterfalls, including the Irene Falls and Leo Falls. In the rainforest of Brokopondo, there are large reserves where a diverse variety of wildlife exists. Brownsberg Nature Park is a 12,250 hectares nature park in the area which was founded in 1969. About 8,400 hectares are allocated for scientific research. The 60 square km Brinckheuvel Nature Reserve is also located in the District and was established in 1966. Berg en Dal is a former wood plantation located near the Avobakaweg. In 2008 the plantation was transformed into the &quot;Berg en Dal Eco &amp; Cultural Resort,&quot; a luxury holiday resort for ecotourism. Berg en Dal is home to the Blauwe Berg, a mountain overlooking the Suriname River.

==Agricultural==
Most of the District is not suitable for large scale agriculture. The main crops are maize, soya, pineapples, and peanuts. The former plantation Phedra is the agricultural centre of the resort. In 1960, a palm oil plantation was based in Phedra, however the Surinamese Interior War and lethal yellowing resulted in the closure of the factory in Victoria, Klaaskreek in 1996.

==Economy==
Recently, gold has been discovered in the Brokopondo district, and this has led to many new settlers arriving in the district, both from other parts of Suriname and from the rest of the world. In 2011, a large scale concession was given to the Suparna Gold Corporation in Sarakreek.

==Resorts==

Brokopondo is divided into 6 resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
* Brownsweg
* Centrum
* Klaaskreek
* Kwakoegron
* Marshallkreek
* Sarakreek

==Villages==
* Afobaka
* Baikutu
* Berg en Dal
* Brokopondo
* Brownsweg
* Lebidoti
* Nieuw-Koffiekamp
* Nieuw-Lombe
* Zoewatta

<doc id="683320" wikidata="Q2707216" url="?curid=683320" title="Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte">
<text>The Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte is a Portuguese Catholic shrine in Tenões, outside the city of Braga, in northern Portugal. Its name means &quot;Good Jesus of the Mount&quot;.

This sanctuary is a notable example of Christian pilgrimage site with a monumental, Baroque stairway that climbs 116 meters (381 feet). It is an important tourist attraction of Braga.

On 7 July 2019, the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus do Monte in Braga was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==History==
Many hilltops in Portugal and other parts of Europe have been sites of religious devotion since antiquity, and it is possible that the Bom Jesus hill was one of these. However, the first indication of a chapel over the hill dates from 1373. This chapel - dedicated to the Holy Cross - was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1629 a pilgrimage church was built dedicated to the &quot;Bom Jesus&quot; (Good Jesus), with six chapels dedicated to the Passion of Christ.

The present Sanctuary started being built in 1722, under the patronage of the Archbishop of Braga, Rodrigo de Moura Telles. His coat of arms is seen over the gateway, in the beginning of the stairway. Under his direction the first stairway row, with chapels dedicated to the &quot;Via Crucis&quot;, were completed. Each chapel is decorated with terra cotta sculptures depicting the Passion of Christ. He also sponsored the next segment of stairways, which has a zigzag shape and is dedicated to the &quot;Five Senses&quot;. Each sense (Sight, Smell, Hearing, Touch, Taste) is represented by a different fountain. At the end of this stairway, a Baroque church was built around 1725 by architect Manuel Pinto Vilalobos.

The works on the first chapels, stairways and church proceeded through the 18th century. In an area behind the church (the &quot;Terreiro dos Evangelistas&quot;), three octagonal chapels were built in the 1760s with statues depicting episodes that occur after the Crucifixion, like the meeting of Jesus with Mary Magdalene. The exterior design of the beautiful chapels is attributed to renowned Braga architect André Soares. Around these chapels there are four Baroque fountains with statues of the Evangelists, also dating from the 1760s.

Around 1781, archbishop Gaspar de Bragança decided to complete the ensemble by adding a third segment of stairways and a new church. The third stairway also follows a zigzag pattern and is dedicated to the &quot;Three Theological Virtues&quot;: Faith, Hope and Charity, each with its fountain. Overall the staircase has 583 steps. The old church was demolished and a new one was built following a Neoclassic design by architect Carlos Amarante. This new church, began in 1784, had its interior decorated in the beginning of the 19th century and was consecrated in 1834. The main altarpiece is dedicated to the Crucifixion.

In the 19th century, the area around the church and stairway was expropriated and turned into a park. In 1882, to facilitate the access to the Sanctuary, the water balance Bom Jesus funicular was built linking the city of Braga to the hill. This was the first funicular to be built in the Iberian Peninsula and is still in use.

The Sanctuary has been classified as Property of Public Interest since 1970.

==Significance==

The design of the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus, with its Baroque nature emphasised by the zigzag form of its stairways, influenced many other sites in Portugal (like Lamego) and colonial Brazil, like the Sanctuary of Congonhas. As the pilgrims climbed the stairs, (by tradition encouraged to do so on their knees) they encountered a theological programme that contrasted the senses of the material world with the virtues of the spirit, at the same time as they experienced the scenes of the Passion of Christ. The culmination of the effort was the temple of God, the church on the top of the hill. The presence of several fountains along the stairways give the idea of purification of the faithful.

The new church (built 1784–1834) by Carlos Amarante was one of the first Neoclassic churches of Portugal.

This church was elevated to a Minor Basilica status on 5 July 2015 by Pope Francis.

<text>Carlos Enrique Díaz de León was the provisional President of Guatemala from 27 June to 29 June 1954. He was replaced by a military junta led by Elfego Monzón. Carlos Enrique Díaz was previously Chief of the Guatemalan Armed Forces under President Jacobo Árbenz.

==Early career==
Díaz had befriended Árbenz while they were both at the military academy. Díaz served in the Guatemalan army, and eventually attained the rank of Colonel. Árbenz and Díaz remained friends after Árbenz became president in 1951, and served as his chief of armed forces. In 1954 the CIA intensified operations against the Árbenz government. During this phase, an attempt was made to bribe Díaz: he was offered 200,000 US dollars to act against Árbenz. He refused, possibly because the offer was made when he was visiting Caracas with his mistress.

==1954 Guatemalan coup==

On 18 June 1954, Carlos Castillo Armas led an invasion of Guatemala with a small force of Guatemalan exiles, as part of the US Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s &quot;Operation PBSUCESS&quot; to overthrow Árbenz. The invasion was accompanied by an intense campaign of psychological warfare presenting Castillo Armas&#x27; victory as a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, with the intent of forcing Árbenz to resign. Árbenz&#x27; initial intention was to repel an invasion force led by Carlos Castillo Armas by arming the military-age populace, the workers&#x27; militia, and the Guatemalan Army. However, Díaz, as chief of the Guatemalan armed forces, informed Árbenz that arming the civilians would be unpopular within the army, and that &quot;the army [would] do its duty.&quot;

Due to this advice, Árbenz instead asked Díaz to select officers to lead a counter-attack. Díaz selected a corps of officers known to be men of personal integrity, and who were loyal to the president. Árbenz also tried to use diplomatic methods to put an end to the invasion. Outside Zacapa, a small garrison of 30 Guatemalan soldiers defeated a rebel force of 180, making Árbenz believe that a military victory was possible. In reality, however, the threat of a US intervention, and the psychological warfare employed by the CIA, had left the army demoralized, and unwilling to fight. Árbenz was informed of the unwillingness of the army to fight by various means, and on 25 June decided to arm the civilian population of the capital. Díaz agreed to cooperate, along with several union leaders, but no volunteers appeared to take up arms. Seeing this, Díaz backed out of his agreement, and began to confer with other military leaders, including Elfego Monzón and Jose Angel Sanchez, about seizing power. On 26 June Díaz told Árbenz that he had tried to distribute weapons, but that he did not have the cooperation of troop leaders. The plotters spoke to US ambassador John Peurifoy, who agreed to contact Castillo Armas to arrange a cessation of hostilities: Díaz and his allies were unwilling to deal with Castillo Armas themselves. Peurifoy learned from them that they were planning on seizing power on 27 June.

==Presidency==

On 27 June 1954 Jacobo Árbenz met with Díaz, and informed him that he was resigning. Historians have variously suggested either that at the urging of Peurifoy, Díaz actually persuaded Árbenz to resign, or that Díaz delivered Árbenz an ultimatum from senior army officers, demanding that he resign. Historian Jim Handy has stated that Árbenz made Díaz promise to protect the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution; nonetheless, his resignation represented the end of the revolution for practical purposes. Árbenz left office at 8 PM, after recording a resignation speech that was broadcast on the radio an hour later. Immediately afterward, Díaz made an announcement that he would be taking over the presidency in the name of the Guatemalan Revolution, and stated that the Guatemalan army would still fight against Castillo Armas&#x27; invasion. Nonetheless, Díaz also ordered operation against known communists even before he formally took power. The military junta which took over consisted of Carlos Enrique Díaz, Colonel H. Elfego Monzón, and Colonel Jose Angel Sánchez.

US ambassador John Peurifoy had encouraged Díaz to accept Árbenz&#x27; resignation, and had promised to contact Castillo Armas to arrange a ceasefire once Árbenz had resigned. However, he had not expected Díaz, who still supported the Guatemalan Revolution, to form a military junta and keep fighting. This action had made him a target of Allen Dulles, director of the CIA, and John Foster Dulles, the US secretary of state, who decided that they needed a &quot;better&quot; army officer as president.

A few hours later, Peurifoy, who had played a role in the organization of the coup, informed Díaz that he would have to resign; according to the CIA officer who spoke to Díaz, this was because he was &quot;not convenient for American foreign policy.&quot; Witnesses later stated that Díaz&#x27; removal took place at 4 AM in Díaz&#x27; home. According to eyewitnesses, Peurifoy wore a shoulder-holster to the meeting, as was his wont at the time. Peurifoy harshly criticized Díaz for letting Árbenz criticize the United States in his resignation speech. At the same time, a U.S.-trained pilot bombed the Guatemalan army&#x27;s main powder magazine, to try and intimidate Díaz. Díaz said much later that Peurifoy had given him with a list of names, claiming that the people on it were all communists, and demanded that all of them be shot by the next day. Díaz said that he had refused, and that this had further antagonized Peurifoy. After being berated at the meeting, he told Peurifoy that he would resign, and that he and Sanchez would withdraw from the junta. Monzón then entered and announced that he was forming the new junta. The other members of Monzón&#x27;s junta were José Luis Cruz Salazar and Mauricio Dubois. &quot;Life&quot; magazine described Monzón as having &quot;a more impressive anti-Communist record&quot; than Díaz.

<text>HEPA (, high efficiency particulate air) filter, also known as a high efficiency particulate arresting filter, is an efficiency standard of air filters.

Filters meeting the HEPA standard must satisfy certain levels of efficiency. Common standards require that a HEPA air filter must remove—from the air that passes through—at least 99.95% (ISO, European Standard) or 99.97% (ASME, U.S. DOE) of particles whose diameter is equal to 0.3 μm, with the filtration efficiency increasing for particle diameters both less than and greater than 0.3 μm. HEPA filters capture pollen, dirt, dust, moisture, bacteria (0.2–2.0 μm), viruses (0.02–0.3 μm), and submicron liquid aerosol (0.02–0.5 μm). Some microorganisms, for example, &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot;, &quot;Penicillium citrinum&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, and &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; are captured by HEPA filters with photocatalytic oxidation (PCO). A HEPA filter is also able to capture some viruses and bacteria which are ≤0.3 μm. A HEPA filter is also able to capture floor dust which contains bacteroidia, clostridia, and bacilli. HEPA was commercialized in the 1950s, and the original term became a registered trademark and later a generic trademark for highly efficient filters. HEPA filters are used in applications that require contamination control, such as the manufacturing of hard disk drives, medical devices, semiconductors, nuclear, food and pharmaceutical products, as well as in hospitals, homes, and vehicles.

==Mechanism==
HEPA filters are composed of a mat of randomly arranged fibers. The fibers are typically composed of polypropylene or fiberglass with diameters between 0.5 and 2.0 micrometers. Most of the time, these filters are composed of tangled bundles of fine fibers. These fibers create a narrow convoluted pathway through which air passes. When the largest particles are passing through this pathway, the bundles of fibers behave like a kitchen sieve which physically blocks the particles from passing through. However, when smaller particles pass with the air, as the air twists and turns, the smaller particles cannot keep up with the motion of the air and thus they collide with the fibers. The smallest particles have very little inertia and move randomly as a result of collisions with individual air molecules (Brownian motion). Because of their movement, they end up crashing into the fibers. Key factors affecting its functions are fiber diameter, filter thickness, and face velocity, which is the measured air speed at an inlet or outlet of a heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Face velocity is measured in m/s and can be calculated as the volume flow rate (m3/s) divided by the face area (m2). The air space between HEPA filter fibers is typically much greater than 0.3 μm. HEPA filters in very high level for smallest particulate matter. Unlike sieves or membrane filters, where particles smaller than openings or pores can pass through, HEPA filters are designed to target a range of particle sizes. These particles are trapped (they stick to a fiber) through a combination of the following three mechanisms:

# Diffusion; particles below 0.3 μm are captured by diffusion in a HEPA filter. This mechanism is a result of the collision with gas molecules by the smallest particles, especially those below 0.1 μm in diameter. The small particles are effectively blown or bounced around and collide with the filter media fibers. This behavior is similar to Brownian motion and raises the probability that a particle will be stopped by either interception or impaction; this mechanism becomes dominant at lower airflow.
# Interception; particles following a line of flow in the air stream come within one radius of a fiber and adhere to it. Mid size particles are being captured by this process.
# Impaction; larger particles are unable to avoid fibers by following the curving contours of the air stream and are forced to embed in one of them directly; this effect increases with diminishing fiber separation and higher air flow velocity.

Diffusion predominates below the 0.1 μm diameter particle size, whilst impaction and interception predominate above 0.4 μm. In between, near the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) 0.21 μm, both diffusion and interception are comparatively inefficient. Because this is the weakest point in the filter&#x27;s performance, the HEPA specifications use the retention of particles near this size (0.3 μm) to classify the filter. However it is possible for particles smaller than the MPPS to not have filtering efficiency greater than that of the MPPS. This is due to the fact that these particles can act as nucleation sites for mostly condensation and form particles near the MPPS.

===Gas filtration===
HEPA filters are designed to arrest very fine particles effectively, but they do not filter out gasses and odor molecules. Circumstances requiring filtration of volatile organic compounds, chemical vapors, or cigarette, pet or flatulence odors call for the use of an activated carbon (charcoal) or other type of filter instead of or in addition to a HEPA filter. Carbon cloth filters, claimed to be many times more efficient than the granular activated carbon form at adsorption of gaseous pollutants, are known as high efficiency gas adsorption filters (HEGA) and were originally developed by the British Armed Forces as a defense against chemical warfare.

===Pre-filter and HEPA filter===
A HEPA bag filter can be used in conjunction with a pre-filter (usually carbon-activated) to extend the usage life of the more expensive HEPA filter. In such setup, the first stage in the filtration process is made up of a pre-filter which removes most of the larger dust, hair, PM10 and pollen particles from the air. The second stage high-quality HEPA filter removes the finer particles that escape from the pre-filter. This is common in air handling units.

==Specifications==

HEPA filters, as defined by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) standard adopted by most American industries, remove at least 99.97% of aerosols 0.3 micrometers (μm) in diameter. The filter&#x27;s minimal resistance to airflow, or pressure drop, is usually specified around at its nominal volumetric flow rate.

The specification used in the European Union: European Standard EN 1822-1:2019, from which ISO 29463 is derived, defines several classes of filters by their retention at the given most penetrating particle size (MPPS): &quot;Efficient Particulate Air filters&quot; (EPA), &quot;High Efficiency Particulate Air filters&quot; (HEPA), and &quot;Ultra Low Particulate Air filters&quot; (ULPA). The averaged efficiency of the filter is called &quot;overall&quot;, and the efficiency at a specific point is called &quot;local&quot;:
See also the different classes for air filters for comparison.

=== Specifications for respirators ===
For respirators, MSHA and NIOSH define HEPA as filters blocking ≥ 99.97% of 0.3 micron DOP particles, under 30 CFR 11 and 42 CFR 84. Since the transition to 42 CFR 84 in 1995, use of the term HEPA has been deprecated except for powered air-purifying respirators. However, by definition, ANSI Z88.2-2015 considers N100, R100, P100, and HE as HEPA filters.

=== Marketing ===
Some companies use the marketing term &quot;True HEPA&quot; to give consumers assurance that their air filters meet the HEPA standard, although this term has no legal or scientific meaning. Products that are marketed to be &quot;HEPA-type,&quot; &quot;HEPA-like,&quot; &quot;HEPA-style&quot; or &quot;99% HEPA&quot; do not satisfy the HEPA standard and may not have been tested in independent laboratories. Although such filters may come reasonably close to HEPA standards, others fall significantly short.

== Efficacy and safety ==
In general terms (and allowing for some variation depending on factors such as the air-flow rate, the physical properties of the particles being filtered, as well as engineering details of the entire filtration-system design and not just the filter-media properties), HEPA filters experience the most difficulty in capturing particles in the size range of 0.15 to 0.2 μm. HEPA filtration works by mechanical means, unlike ionic and ozone treatment technologies, which use negative ions and ozone gas respectively. So, the likelihood of potential triggering of pulmonary side-effects such as asthma and allergies is much lower with HEPA purifiers.

To ensure that a HEPA filter is working efficiently, the filters should be inspected and changed at least every six months in commercial settings. In residential settings, and depending on the general ambient air quality, these filters can be changed every two to three years. Failing to change a HEPA filter in a timely fashion will result in it putting stress on the machine or system and not removing particles from the air properly. Additionally, depending on the gasketing materials chosen in the design of the system, a clogged HEPA filter can result in extensive bypassing of airflow around the filter.

== Applications ==

=== Biomedical ===
HEPA filters are critical in the prevention of the spread of airborne bacterial and viral organisms and, therefore, infection. Typically, medical use HEPA filtration systems also incorporate high-energy ultraviolet light units or panels with anti-microbial coating to kill off the live bacteria and viruses trapped by the filter media. 

Some of the best-rated HEPA units have an efficiency rating of 99.995%, which assures a very high level of protection against airborne disease transmission.

==== COVID-19 ====
HEPA filters are capable of removing viruses including COVID-19 (particles of 60-140 nanometer diameter) from the air, and as such saw a surge in adoption during the pandemic in order to mitigate infection risks.
To combat supply chain and cost issues hindering adoption of HEPA filters during the COVID-19 pandemic, a professor at University of California, Davis, created a simple do-it-yourself air purifier design called crbox(Corsi–Rosenthal Box). It involves arranging 4 HEPA filters in a cubic shape, the bottom being made out of cardboard, sealing the filter sides with tape and adding a fan on top.
In addition, the COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in a surge of new air purifier products from new and established brands such as Dyson or Xiaomi hitting the markets.

=== Vacuum cleaners ===

Many vacuum cleaners also use HEPA filters as part of their filtration systems. This is beneficial for asthma and allergy sufferers, because the HEPA filter traps the fine particles (such as pollen and house dust mite feces) which trigger allergy and asthma symptoms. For a HEPA filter in a vacuum cleaner to be effective, the vacuum cleaner must be designed so that &quot;all&quot; the air drawn into the machine is expelled through the filter, with none of the air leaking past it. This is often referred to as &quot;Sealed HEPA&quot; or sometimes the more vague &quot;True HEPA&quot;. Vacuum cleaners simply labeled &quot;HEPA&quot; may have a HEPA filter, but not all air necessarily passes through it. Finally, vacuum cleaner filters marketed as &quot;HEPA-like&quot; will typically use a filter of a &quot;similar construction&quot; to HEPA, but without the filtering efficiency. Because of the extra density of a true HEPA filter, HEPA vacuum cleaners require more powerful motors to provide adequate cleaning power.

Some newer models claim to be better than the earlier ones with the inclusion of &quot;washable&quot; filters. Generally, washable true HEPA filters are expensive. A high-quality HEPA filter can trap 99.97% of dust particles that are 0.3 microns in diameter. For comparison, a human hair is about 50 to 150 microns in diameter. So, a true HEPA filter is effectively trapping particles several hundred times smaller than the width of a human hair. Some manufacturers claim filter standards such as &quot;HEPA 4,&quot; without explaining the meaning behind them. This refers to their Minimum Efficiency Reporting Value (MERV) rating. These ratings are used to rate the ability of an air cleaner filter to remove dust from the air as it passes through the filter. MERV is a standard used to measure the overall efficiency of a filter. The MERV scale ranges from 1 to 16, and measures a filter&#x27;s ability to remove particles from 10 to 0.3 micrometer in size. Filters with higher ratings not only remove more particles from the air, but they also remove smaller particles.

===Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning===

Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) is technology that uses air filters, such as HEPA filters, to remove pollutants from the air either indoors or in vehicles. Pollutants include smoke, viruses, powders, etc., and can originate either outside or inside. HVAC is used to provide environmental comfort and in polluted cities to maintain health.

===Vehicles===

====Airlines====
Modern airliners use HEPA filters to reduce the spread of airborne pathogens in recirculated air. Critics have expressed concern about the effectiveness and state of repair of air filtering systems, since they think that much of the air in an airplane cabin is recirculated. Almost all of the air in a pressurized aircraft is, in fact, brought in from the outside, circulated through the cabin and then exhausted through outflow valves in the rear of the aircraft. About 40 percent of the cabin&#x27;s air goes through a HEPA filter and the other 60 percent comes from outside the plane. Certified air filters block and capture 99.97 percent of airborne particles.

====Motor vehicles====
In 2016, it was announced that the Tesla Model X would have the world&#x27;s first HEPA-grade filter in a Tesla car. Following the release of the Model X, Tesla has updated the Model S to also have an optional HEPA air filter.

==History==

The idea behind the development of the HEPA filter was born from gas masks worn by soldiers fighting in World War II. A piece of paper found inserted into a German gas mask had a remarkably high capture efficiency for chemical smoke. The British Army Chemical Corps duplicated this and began to manufacture it in large quantities for their own service gas masks. They needed another solution for operational headquarters, where individual gas masks were impractical. The Army Chemical Corps developed a combination mechanical blower and air purifier unit, which incorporated cellulose-asbestos paper in a deeply-pleated form with spacers between the pleats. It was referred to as an &quot;absolute&quot; air filter and laid the groundwork for further research to come in developing the HEPA filter.

The next phase of the HEPA filter was designed in the 1940s and was used in the Manhattan Project to prevent the spread of airborne radioactive contaminants. The US Army Chemical Corps and National Defense Research Committee needed to develop a filter suitable for removing radioactive materials from the air. The Army Chemical Corps asked Nobel Laureate Irving Langmuir to recommend filter test methods and other general recommendations for creating the material to filter out these radioactive particles. He identified 0.3 micron size particles to be the &quot;most penetrating size&quot;—the most difficult and concerning.

It was commercialized in the 1950s, and the original term became a registered trademark and later a generic trademark for highly efficient filters.

Over the decades filters have evolved to satisfy the higher and higher demands for air quality in various high technology industries, such as aerospace, pharmaceutical industry, hospitals, health care, nuclear fuels, nuclear power, and integrated circuit fabrication.

<text>Charles Arnold &quot;Chick&quot; Gandil (January 19, 1888 – December 13, 1970) was an American professional baseball player. He played for the Washington Senators, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox of the American League. He is best known as the ringleader of the players involved in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Described by his contemporaries as a &quot;professional malcontent&quot;, he was physically well-built at and , and had a stern and challenging demeanor. He used both to display his toughness, and also did not hesitate to use sheer strength to get his point across.

==Early years==
He was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, to Swiss immigrants Louise Bechel and Christian Gandil. He was their only child. The Gandil family migrated west and the 1900 census (taken June 8) has their address registered as Seattle, King County, Washington. After 1900, the Gandils moved to California, settling in Berkeley. The young Gandil soon showed an interest in playing baseball. He joined the Oakland High School baseball team in 1902 and played all positions except first base.

After two years at Oakland High School, Gandil left home to make it on his own. He took a train to Amarillo, Texas, and played catcher in the local semi-pro baseball league for the Amarillo team. In 1907, he migrated to Humboldt, Arizona, and worked as a boilermaker in the copper mines. He played catcher for the semipro team that was sponsored by the local smelting company. The Humboldt baseball club experienced financial problems in 1906, and Gandil moved on to a team in Cananea, Mexico, from the United States. &quot;I caught on with an outlaw team in Cananea, Mexico, just across the Arizona border. Cananea was a wide-open mining town in those days, which suited me fine. I was a wild, rough kid. I did a little heavyweight fighting at $150 a fight. I also worked part-time as a boilermaker in the copper mines.&quot; It was with the Cananea, Mexico, team that Gandil became a first baseman.

==Professional baseball career==

Gandil entered professional baseball in 1908. He spent the season with Shreveport (Louisiana) in the Texas League and batted a solid .269. That same year, he met 17-year-old Laurel Fay Kelly (a Mississippi native), and they were soon married.

After the 1908 season, Gandil was drafted by the St. Louis Browns. Failing to make the club in the spring of 1909, the Browns ordered him back to Shreveport. Gandil refused to report, though. He headed back west with his new bride and joined the Fresno team in the outlaw California State League. For this offense, Gandil faced blacklisting by organized baseball. He reconsidered his decision and joined Sacramento of the Pacific Coast League for the remainder of 1909 season. He was arrested, however, for having stolen $225 from the Fresno team coffers.

Gandil was successful in Sacramento. He batted .282, and late in the 1909 season, was sold to the Chicago White Sox. He was not required to report to Chicago until the following season.

Gandil made his major league debut on April 14, 1910, with the White Sox, which was a disaster. He appeared in just 77 games and batted just .193. It was reported that he had trouble hitting the curveball. He was sold to Montreal in 1911 and spent the season in the Eastern League. He had a solid season (batting .304), and several major league clubs wanted to draft him. The rules at the time stated that only one player could be drafted from each team, so Gandil returned to Montreal to begin the 1912 season. He hit over .300 in the first 29 games and was sold to the Washington Senators. He was now better prepared to play major league baseball, and in 117 games, he batted .305 and was the American League leader for first basemen in fielding percentage.

From 1912 to 1915, Gandil led the Senators in runs batted in three times and batted .293. In the field, he paced American League first basemen in fielding percentage four times and assists three times. Gandil remained with the Senators through the 1915 season and played the 1916 season for the Cleveland Indians.

Early on in his major league career, Gandil was considered a top-notch first baseman, both for his play on the field and his solid work ethic. In 1916, a Cleveland newspaper described Gandil as &quot;a most likeable player, and one of excellent habits.&quot; During Gandil&#x27;s first season with the Senators he met bookie and gambler, Joseph &quot;Sport&quot; Sullivan. Sullivan later become a key figure in conspiring with Gandil to fix the 1919 World Series.

On February 25, 1917, he was reacquired by the White Sox for $3,500. That season, Chicago defeated the New York Giants in the World Series. It was later revealed that Gandil and his teammate, Charles &quot;Swede&quot; Risberg, had allegedly collected $45 from each member of the White Sox and paid off the Detroit Tigers in two crucial doubleheaders late in the season. When Tigers pitcher Bill James agreed that his team would go easy, the Tigers lost all four games, allowing the White Sox to win the American League pennant. This incident was officially investigated by Commissioner Landis in 1927, but due to contradictions, no action was taken.

==Black Sox scandal==
 Gandil claims that Sullivan approached him with the idea to fix the 1919 World Series.

Sullivan assured Gandil that the fix was on, and that $100,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) in total would be paid to the players. In addition to serving as the contact for the gamblers, Gandil was responsible for recruiting and paying the players involved in the fix. Gandil received $35,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) for his role in throwing the World Series – nearly nine times his 1919 salary of $4,000.

In the spring of 1920, Gandil demanded that the White Sox raise his salary to $6,500 per year. Owner Charles Comiskey would not relent, and he decided to remain in California. Gandil retired from the majors. According to Gandil, &quot;Instead, I played semipro ball twice a week for the Elks Club in Bakersfield, Calif. I earned $75 a game.&quot; He was far from Chicago as investigations into the 1919 World Series began during the fall of 1920.

Gandil and his seven White Sox teammates were indicted, and he came back to Chicago in July 1921 to stand trial for fixing the series. The jury found the eight players not guilty. Following the players&#x27; acquittal, Gandil said, &quot;I guess that&#x27;ll learn Ban Johnson he can&#x27;t frame an honest bunch of ball players.&quot; However, the players&#x27; joy was short lived. Gandil and the others were permanently banned from organized baseball by new commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis.

==Career statistics==
In 1,147 games over nine seasons, Gandil posted a .277 batting average (1176-for-4245) with 449 runs, 173 doubles, 78 triples, 11 home runs, 556 RBI, 151 stolen bases, 273 bases on balls, .327 on-base percentage and .362 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .992 fielding percentage as a first baseman. In the 1917 and 1919 World Series, he batted .245 (13-for-53) with 10 RBI and 2 stolen bases.

==After the scandal and later years==

After 1921, he continued to play semi-pro ball on the west coast. He contacted Joe Gedeon, Swede Risberg, Joe Jackson and Fred McMullin and attempted to put together a team in Southern California. In 1925, he played with Hal Chase and other banished players in the Frontier League in Douglas, Arizona. While presiding over the Douglas team in 1927, he reportedly had team manager Buck Weaver banned from the league. It was believed that Gandil did this because he had felt betrayed by his former White Sox teammate&#x27;s lack of support during the 1921 investigation of the 1917 White Sox/Tigers situation. He ended his playing career with semi-pro clubs in the copper mining towns of Bayard and Hurley, New Mexico.

After he ended his baseball career, Gandil settled in his childhood residence (Berkeley, California) with Laurel and his daughter Idella. His primary occupation was as a plumber. His mother and father still lived in Berkeley (his father Christian died in 1941 and his mother Louise in 1952). There is no official record of contact between them. He remained in the area until he retired to Calistoga in 1954 and spent the last part of his life in the Napa Valley region of Northern California. Gandil died at age 82 on December 13, 1970, in a convalescent hospital. He had been suffering from heart disease and emphysema, and the official cause of death was heart failure. His death was only immediately reported by the &quot;The Press Democrat&quot; and his obituary didn&#x27;t mention his involvement in baseball and it wasn&#x27;t publicly announced that he had died worldwide until February 25, 1971.

Laurel, who had been married to Gandil for 62 years, followed him in death just three months later. Gandil is interred at St. Helena Public Cemetery.

Gandil was portrayed by Michael Rooker in the 1988 film &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; and by Art LaFleur in 1989&#x27;s &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;.

==1956 &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; article==
In 1956, Gandil told his version of the events of the 1919 World Series to sportswriter Melvin Durslag. Durslag&#x27;s account of Gandil&#x27;s story was published in the September 17, 1956 edition of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;.

In the story, Gandil admitted to leading the plot to throw the Series and expressed guilt and remorse over having done so. However, he claimed that after an initial payment was made, the players actually abandoned the plan and had ultimately tried their best to win. According to Gandil&#x27;s story, the rumors which had spread about the Series being fixed (triggered by a sudden influx of money being bet on the Reds) caused the players to conclude that they could never get away with throwing the Series, as their every move would be closely scrutinized. Instead, they decided to betray the gamblers and keep the cash. While he believed that Landis&#x27; decision to ban them all was draconian, he felt they deserved to be banned just for talking to the gamblers.

In his account, Gandil suggested that the players were under intense pressure from both observers suspicious of their every move and the gamblers expecting them to go along with the plan. He said this may have contributed to their making poor plays despite their decision to abandon the fix. However, he was firm in his insistence that all of the players were trying their best throughout all eight games of the Series. Gandil also said that the original deal called for the conspirators to play the first game straight, since a White Sox win would drive the price up further; the White Sox were shelled in that game 9-1. Gandil further claimed in his story that he never received his share of any of the money paid by the gamblers, and that he had no idea what happened to that money.

In an interview with Dwight Chapin, published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; on August 14, 1969, Gandil again denied that he threw the Series stating, &quot;I&#x27;m going to my grave with a clear conscience.&quot;

<text>A total station or total station theodolite is an electronic/optical instrument used for surveying and building construction. It is an electronic transit theodolite integrated with electronic distance measurement (EDM) to measure both vertical and horizontal angles and the slope distance from the instrument to a particular point, and an on-board computer to collect data and perform triangulation calculations.

Robotic or motorized total stations allow the operator to control the instrument from a distance via remote control. In theory, this eliminates the need for an assistant staff member, as the operator holds the retroreflector and controls the total station from the observed point. In practice, however, an assistant surveyor is often needed when the surveying is being conducted in busy areas such as on a public carriageway or construction site. This is to prevent people from disrupting the total station as they walk past, which would necessitate resetting the tripod and re-establishing a baseline. Additionally, an assistant surveyor discourages opportunistic theft, which is not uncommon due to the value of the instrument. If all else fails, most total stations have serial numbers. The National Society of Professional Surveyors hosts a registry of stolen equipment which can be checked by institutions that service surveying equipment to prevent stolen instruments from circulating. These motorized total stations can also be used in automated setups known as &quot;automated motorized total station&quot;.

== Function ==

=== Angle measurement ===

Most total station instruments measure angles by means of electro-optical scanning of extremely precise digital bar-codes etched on rotating glass cylinders or discs within the instrument. The best quality total stations are capable of measuring angles within a standard deviation of 0.5 arc-seconds. Inexpensive &quot;construction grade&quot; total stations can generally measure angles within standard deviations of 5 or 10 arc-seconds. 

Angle measurement is typically performed by the operator first occupying a known point, aiming the head of the instrument at a target or prism which exists at either another known point or along an azimuth, which is to be held as a backsight — sighting with the reticle inside the eyepiece — then holding that line as an angle of 00°00‘̣00“̣. The operator then will turn the head of the instrument at a target or feature that is to be observed as a foresight and record the AR (Angle Right) from the backsight measured by the instrument in which a horizontal angle is produced. Angular error in the instrument as well as collimation error can be mitigated in many total stations by performing a set collection. This entails witnessing any angles recorded an equal number of times in both &quot;direct&quot; and &quot;reverse&quot; modes by sighting the observed backsight and foresights with the instrument facing the targets normally as well as with the scope flipped or &quot;plunged&quot; 180°. The recorded sets of angles taken from each target will be averaged together and a mean angle will be generated.

=== Distance measurement ===
Measurement of distance is accomplished with a modulated infrared carrier signal, generated by a small solid-state emitter within the instrument&#x27;s optical path, and reflected by a prism reflector or the object under survey. The modulation pattern in the returning signal is read and interpreted by the computer in the total station. The distance is determined by emitting and receiving multiple frequencies, and determining the integer number of wavelengths to the target for each frequency. Most total stations use purpose-built glass prism (surveying) reflectors for the EDM signal. A typical total station can measure distances up to with an accuracy of about ± 2 parts per million.

Reflectorless total stations can measure distances to any object that is reasonably light in color, up to a few hundred meters.

=== Coordinate measurement ===

The coordinates of an unknown point relative to a known coordinate can be determined using the total station as long as a direct line of sight can be established between the two points. Angles and distances are measured from the total station to points under survey, and the coordinates (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot;; or easting, northing, and elevation) of surveyed points relative to the total station position are calculated using trigonometry and triangulation.

To determine an absolute location, a total station requires line of sight observations and can be set up over a known point or with line of sight to 2 or more points with known location, called free stationing.

For this reason, some total stations also have a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver and do not require a direct line of sight to determine coordinates. However, GNSS measurements may require longer occupation periods and offer relatively poor accuracy in the vertical axis.

=== Data processing ===

Some models include internal electronic data storage to record distance, horizontal angle, and vertical angle measured, while other models are equipped to write these measurements to an external data collector, such as a hand-held computer.

When data is downloaded from a total station onto a computer, application software can be used to compute results and generate a map of the surveyed area. The newest generation of total stations can also show the map on the touch-screen of the instrument immediately after measuring the points.

== Applications ==
Most large-scale excavation or mapping projects benefit greatly from the proficient use of total stations. They are mainly used by land surveyors and civil engineers, either to record features as in topographic surveying or to set out features (such as roads, houses or boundaries). They are used by police, crime scene investigators, private accident reconstructionists and insurance companies to take measurements of scenes. Total stations are also employed by archaeologists, offering millimeter accuracy difficult to achieve using other tools as well as flexibility in setup location. They prove crucial in recording artifact locations, architectural dimensions, and site topography.

=== Mining ===
Total stations are the primary survey instrument used in mining surveying.

A total station is used to record the absolute location of the tunnel walls, ceilings (backs), and floors, as the drifts of an underground mine are driven. The recorded data are then downloaded into a CAD program and compared to the designed layout of the tunnel.

The survey party installs control stations at regular intervals. These are small steel plugs installed in pairs in holes drilled into walls or the back. For wall stations, two plugs are installed in opposite walls, forming a line perpendicular to the drift. For back stations, two plugs are installed in the back, forming a line parallel to the drift.

A set of plugs can be used to locate the total station set up in a drift or tunnel by processing measurements to the plugs by intersection and resection.

=== Mechanical and electrical construction ===
Total stations have become the highest standard for most forms of construction layout.

They are most often used in the &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; axes to lay out the locations of penetrations out of the underground utilities into the foundation, between floors of a structure, as well as roofing penetrations.

Because more commercial and industrial construction jobs have become centered around building information modeling (BIM), the coordinates for almost every pipe, conduit, duct and hanger support are available with digital precision. The application of communicating a virtual model to a tangible construction potentially eliminates labor costs related to moving poorly measured systems, as well as time spent laying out these systems in the midst of a full-blown construction job in progress.

===Meteorology===
Meteorologists also use total stations to track weather balloons for determining upper-level winds. With the average ascent rate of the weather balloon known or assumed, the change in azimuth and elevation readings provided by the total station as it tracks the weather balloon over time are used to compute the wind speed and direction at different altitudes. Additionally, the total station is used to track ceiling balloons to determine the height of cloud layers. Such upper-level wind data is often used for aviation weather forecasting and rocket launches.

<doc id="683330" wikidata="Q1680032" url="?curid=683330" title="James Benning (film director)">
<text>James Benning (born 1942) is an American independent filmmaker and educator. Over the course of his 40-year career Benning has made over twenty-five feature-length films that have shown in many different venues across the world. Since 1987, he has taught at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts). He is known as a minimalist filmmaker.

== Early life and education ==
James Benning was born in 1942 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Benning played baseball for the first twenty years of his life. He earned an undergraduate and master&#x27;s degree in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, which he attended on a baseball scholarship. Benning experienced a political awakening and racial consciousness during the late 1960s, participating in civil rights protests led by Father James Groppi in segregated Milwaukee.

Benning dropped out of graduate school to forfeit his military deferment since his friends, who were mostly not in school, were being drafted and dying in Vietnam. Benning instead joined the War on Poverty, teaching children of migrant workers in Colorado how to read and write, and helping to start a commodities food program that fed people living in poverty in the Missouri Ozarks. Benning often uses this background as part of his film work.

At the age of 33, Benning received an MFA from the University of Wisconsin–Madison where he had studied with David Bordwell.

For the next four years he taught filmmaking at Northwestern University and CalArts (1988—present).

== Film ==
Benning was hailed cinema&#x27;s voice of the Midwest with his 1976/1978 films, &quot;11 x 14&quot; and &quot;One Way Boogie Woogie&quot;, made in Chicago and Milwaukee and the surrounding rural region. In 1980, Benning moved to lower Manhattan, where, with the aid of grants and funding from German Television, he continued to make films, most notably, &quot;American Dreams&quot; (1984) and &quot;Landscape Suicide&quot; (1986). Leaving New York after eight years, Benning moved west to teach film/video at California Institute of the Arts, and has taught there ever since. In the early 1990s Benning made a series of text/image films: &quot;North on Evers&quot; (1991), &quot;Deseret&quot; (1995), &quot;Four Corners&quot; (1997), and &quot;UTOPIA&quot; (1998), often invoking histories of how antagonistic cultural and economic agendas over land use shape landscapes and configure social environments.

Benning has employed diverse methods, themes, structures, and aesthetics, investigating narrative and anti-narrative modes, personal history, race, collective memory, place, industry, and landscape. His philosophy of &quot;landscape as a function of time,&quot; and &quot;Looking and Listening&quot; (which is also the name of a course taught by Benning) is particularly evident in his films since 1999 in the form of fixed, stable shots. For instance, each of &quot;El Valley Centro&quot;, &quot;Los&quot;, and &quot;Sogobi&quot;—&quot;The California Trilogy&quot; (2000-2001) is composed of 35 2½ minute shots. &quot;Nightfall&quot; (2012) consists of a single 98-minute shot made at a high elevation in the woods in the west Sierras that begins in late afternoon as the sun is going down and ends in near blackness.

Benning&#x27;s use of duration reflects his accord with Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s passage from &quot;Walden&quot;, &quot;No method nor discipline can supersede the necessity of being forever on the alert. What is a course of history, or philosophy, or poetry, no matter how well selected, or the best society, or the most admirable routine of life, compared with the discipline of looking at what is to be seen?&quot;

Benning divides his time between Val Verde, California, and a small town in the Sierra Nevada north of Bakersfield. There, in 2007, Benning built a replica of the cabin Thoreau constructed in 1845 on Walden Pond. The following year Benning erected a copy of the cabin Ted Kaczynski built in 1971 in Montana. Inside the cabins Benning has installed a number of copies he made of paintings by artists that have deeply inspired him, including Bill Traylor, Henry Darger, and Mose Tolliver. These locations are near to California Institute of the Arts where he is teaching in the film department.

== Publication ==
Benning published a book of poems titled &quot;Thirty Years to Life&quot; in 1973, and &quot;Fifty Years to Life, Texts from Eight Films by James Benning&quot; in 2000, both with Two Pants Press in Madison, Wisconsin. Reinhard Wulf&#x27;s feature-length documentary, &quot;James Benning: Circling the Image,&quot; was released in 2003. In 2007, the Austrian Film Museum also published the first substantial monograph on the filmmaker, &quot;James Benning&quot;, edited by Barbara Pichler and Claudia Slanar. In 2011, Julie Ault (ed.) collaborated with Benning on the book &quot;(FC) Two Cabins by JB&quot;, published with A.R.T. Press. Scores of reviews, articles, and essays on Benning&#x27;s work, as well as interviews with the filmmaker have appeared in publications worldwide.

== Medium ==
Benning worked exclusively in 16mm until the increasing obsolescence of the medium necessitated he convert to digital. His first digital film was &quot;Ruhr&quot; (2009), commissioned by Werner Ruzicka for the &quot;Duisburger Filmwoche&quot;. Digital filmmaking allowed him to branch out in different directions including re-makes of &quot;Faces&quot; (2011) and &quot;Easy Rider&quot; (2012), as well as the two-hour one shot film &quot;Nightfall&quot; (2011). Benning&#x27;s work has always traversed the film sphere and the art field, finding constituencies in both. He made 16mm installations at Art Park (1977), the Walker Art Center (1978), and the Whitney Museum of American Art (1980), and has recently created digital installations at Las Cienegas Projects, Los Angeles, (2011), 21er Haus, Museum of Contemporary Art, Vienna (2012), and Argos, Centrum Voor Kunst en Media, Brussels (2012).

== Distribution ==
Benning is represented by neugerriemschneider, Berlin. He continues to distribute his own films, as he has for his entire career. Benning has been supported by grants from the Rockefeller Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the American Film Institute, New York State Council on the Arts, the Wisconsin Arts Board, and the University Film Association. From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s Werner Deutsch and Cologne-based WDR-TV supported Benning&#x27;s work with commissions and the purchase of broadcast rights. The Austrian Film Museum in Vienna is restoring and archiving all of Benning&#x27;s 16mm films as well as, over time, producing DVDs of the works. The Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with the Austrian Film Museum, preserved Benning&#x27;s film &quot;Chicago Loop&quot; in 2013.

==Filmography==
== Personal life ==
Benning&#x27;s only child is the artist Sadie Benning, born in 1973.

<doc id="683334" wikidata="Q4795884" url="?curid=683334" title="Array slicing">
<text>In computer programming, array slicing is an operation that extracts a subset of elements from an array and packages them as another array, possibly in a different dimension from the original. 

Common examples of array slicing are extracting a substring from a string of characters, the &quot;ell&quot; in &quot;h&quot;ell&quot;o&quot;, extracting a row or column from a two-dimensional array, or extracting a vector from a matrix.

Depending on the programming language, an array slice can be made out of non-consecutive elements. Also depending on the language, the elements of the new array may be aliased to (i.e., share memory with) those of the original array.

==Details==
For &quot;one-dimensional&quot; (single-indexed) arrays vectors, sequences, strings etc. the most common slicing operation is extraction of zero or more consecutive elements. If we have a vector containing elements (2, 5, 7, 3, 8, 6, 4, 1), and want to create an array slice from the 3rd to the 6th elements, we get (7, 3, 8, 6). In programming languages that use a 0-based indexing scheme, the slice would be from index &quot;2&quot; to &quot;5&quot;.

Reducing the range of any index to a single value effectively removes the need for that index. This feature can be used, for example, to extract one-dimensional slices (vectors in 3D, including rows, columns, and tubes) or two-dimensional slices (rectangular matrices) from a three-dimensional array. However, since the range can be specified at run-time, type-checked languages may require an explicit (compile-time) notation to actually eliminate the trivial indices.

General array slicing can be implemented (whether or not built into the language) by referencing every array through a dope vector or &quot;descriptor&quot; a record that contains the address of the first array element, and then the range of each index and the corresponding coefficient in the indexing formula. This technique also allows immediate array transposition, index reversal, subsampling, etc. For languages like C, where the indices always start at zero, the dope vector of an array with &quot;d&quot; indices has at least 1 + 2&quot;d&quot; parameters. For languages that allow arbitrary lower bounds for indices, like Pascal, the dope vector needs 1 + 3&quot;d&quot; entries.

If the array abstraction does not support true negative indices (as the arrays of Ada and Pascal do), then negative indices for the bounds of the slice for a given dimension are sometimes used to specify an offset from the end of the array in that dimension. In 1-based schemes, -1 generally indicates the second-to-last item, while in a 0-based system, it refers to the very last item.

==History==
The concept of slicing was surely known even before the invention of compilers. Slicing as a language feature probably started with FORTRAN (1957), more as a consequence of non-existent type and range checking than by design. The concept was also alluded to in the preliminary report for the IAL (ALGOL 58) in that the syntax allowed one or more indices of an array element (or, for that matter, of a procedure call) to be omitted when used as an actual parameter.

Kenneth Iverson&#x27;s APL (1957) had very flexible multi-dimensional array slicing, which contributed much to the language&#x27;s expressive power and popularity.

ALGOL 68 (1968) introduced comprehensive multi-dimension array slicing and trimming features.

Array slicing facilities have been incorporated in several modern languages, such as Ada 2005, Cobra, D, Fortran 90, Go, Rust, Julia, MATLAB, Perl, Python, S-Lang, Windows PowerShell and the mathematical/statistical languages GNU Octave, S and R.

==Timeline of slicing in various programming languages==

===1964: PL/I===
PL/I provides two facilities for array slicing.
* Using &quot;iSub DEFINING&quot;, an array slice can be declared using &quot;iSUB&quot; variables to map specific elements in a &quot;base array&quot; onto elements of the &quot;defined array&quot;. iSUBs can define rows, columns, diagonals, or many-to-one mappings. The following example defines codice_1 as a one-dimensional slice consisting of the diagonal elements of the two-dimensional array codice_2. 
codice_3

A reference to codice_4 is a reference to codice_5, and so on.
* A slice, called a &quot;cross-section&quot;, of an array can be referred to by using asterisk as the subscript for one or more dimensions. The following code sets all the elements in the first column of codice_2 to zero. One or more subscripts can be specified by asterisks in an expression. 
codice_7

===1966: Fortran 66===
The Fortran 66 programmers were only able to take advantage of slicing matrices by row, and then only when passing that row to a subroutine:

 SUBROUTINE PRINT V(VEC, LEN)
 REAL VEC(*)
 PRINT *, (VEC(I), I = 1, LEN)
 END

 PROGRAM MAIN
 PARAMETER(LEN = 3)
 REAL MATRIX(LEN, LEN)
 DATA MATRIX/1, 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 9, 27/
 CALL PRINT V(MATRIX(1, 2), LEN)
 END

Result:

Note that there is no dope vector in FORTRAN 66 hence the length of the slice must also be passed as an argument - or some other means - to the codice_8. 1970s Pascal and C had similar restrictions.

===1968: Algol 68===
Algol68 final report contains an early example of slicing, slices are specified in the form:

 [lower bound:upper bound] &quot;¢ for computers with extended character sets ¢&quot;
or:
 (LOWER BOUND..UPPER BOUND) &quot;# FOR COMPUTERS WITH ONLY 6 BIT CHARACTERS. #&quot;
Both bounds are inclusive and can be omitted, in which case they default to the declared array bounds. Neither the stride facility, nor diagonal slice aliases are part of the revised report.

Examples:

 [3, 3]real a := ((1, 1, 1), (2, 4, 8), (3, 9, 27)); &quot;# declaration of a variable matrix #&quot;
 [,] real c = ((1, 1, 1), (2, 4, 8), (3, 9, 27)); &quot;# constant matrix, the size is implied #&quot;

 ref[]real row := a[2,]; &quot;# alias/ref to a row slice #&quot;
 ref[]real col2 = a[, 2]; &quot;# permanent alias/ref to second column #&quot;

 print ((a[:, 2], newline)); &quot;# second column slice #&quot;
 print ((a[1⌈a, :], newline)); &quot;# last row slice #&quot;
 print ((a[:, 2⌈a], newline)); &quot;# last column slice #&quot;
 print ((a[:2, :2], newline)); &quot;# leading 2-by-2 submatrix &quot;slice&quot; #&quot;

 +1.000010+0 +4.000010+0 +9.000010+0
 +3.000010+0 +9.000010+0 +2.700010+1
 +1.000010+0 +8.000010+0 +2.700010+1
 +1.000010+0 +1.000010+0 +2.000010+0 +4.000010+0

===1968: BASIC===
HP&#x27;s HP 2000 systems, introduced in November 1968, used HP Time-Shared BASIC as their primary interface and programming language. This version of BASIC used slicing for most string manipulation operations. One oddity of the language was that it allowed round or square braces interchangeably, and which was used in practice was typically a function of the computer terminal being used.

Example:
10 A$=&quot;HELLO, WORLD&quot;
20 PRINT A$(1,5)
30 PRINT A$[7,11]
Will produce:
 HELLO
 WORLD

The HP systems were widely used in the early 1970s, especially in technical high schools and many small industrial and scientific settings. As the first microcomputers emerged in the mid-1970s, HP was often used as the pattern for their BASIC dialects as well. Notable examples include 1977&#x27;s Apple BASIC, 1978&#x27;s Atari BASIC, and 1979&#x27;s Sinclair BASIC. This style of manipulation generally offers advantages in terms of memory use, and was often chosen on systems that shipped with small amounts of memory. Only Sinclair&#x27;s dialect differed in any meaningful way, using the keyword instead of a comma-separated list:
10 LET a$=&quot;ABCDE&quot;(2 to 4)
20 PRINT a$
Slicing was also selected as the basis for the ANSI Full BASIC standard, using the colon as the separator and thus differentiating between slicing and array access:
10 DIM A$(5)
20 LET A$(2)=&quot;HELLO, WORLD&quot;
30 PRINT A$(2)(1:5)
While this style of access offered a number of advantages, especially for the small machines of the era, sometime after 1970 Digital Equipment Corporation introduced their own variation of BASIC that used the , and string functions. Microsoft BASIC was written on the PDP-10 and its BASIC was used as the pattern. Through the late 1970s the two styles were both widely used, but by the early 1980s the DEC-style functions were the &quot;de facto&quot; standard.

===1970s: MATLAB ===

&gt; A = round(rand(3, 4, 5)*10) % 3x4x5 three-dimensional or cubic array
&gt; A(:, :, 3) % 3x4 two-dimensional array along first and second dimensions

ans =

 8 3 5 7
 8 9 1 4
 4 4 2 5

&gt; A(:, 2:3, 3) % 3x2 two-dimensional array along first and second dimensions

ans =

 3 5
 9 1
 4 2

&gt; A(2:end, :, 3) % 2x4 two-dimensional array using the &#x27;end&#x27; keyword; works with GNU Octave 3.2.4

ans =

 6 1 4 6
 10 1 3 1

&gt; A(1, :, 3) % single-dimension array along second dimension

ans =

 8 3 5 7

&gt; A(1, 2, 3) % single value
ans = 3
The codice_9 operator implements the stride syntax (codice_10) by generating a vector. codice_11 evaluates as codice_12. codice_13 evaluates as codice_14. A bare codice_9 evaluates the same as codice_16, with codice_17 determined by context.

===1976: S/R===
Arrays in S and GNU R are always one-based, thus the indices of a new slice will begin with &quot;one&quot; for each dimension, regardless of the previous indices. Dimensions with length of &quot;one&quot; will be dropped (unless drop = FALSE). Dimension names (where present) will be preserved.

&gt; A &lt;- array(1:60, dim = c(3, 4, 5)) # 3x4x5 three-dimensional or cubic array
&gt; A[, , 3] # 3x4 two-dimensional array along first and second dimensions
 [, 1] [, 2] [, 3] [, 4]
[1,] 25 28 31 34
[2,] 26 29 32 35
[3,] 27 30 33 36
&gt; A[, 2:3, 3, drop = FALSE] # 3x2x1 cubic array subset (preserved dimensions)
, , 1

 [, 1] [, 2]
[1,] 28 31
[2,] 29 32
[3,] 30 33
&gt; A[, 2, 3] # single-dimension array along first dimension
[1] 28 29 30
&gt; A[1, 2, 3] # single value
[1] 28
===1977: Fortran 77===
The Fortran 77 standard introduced the ability to slice and concatenate strings:
PROGRAM MAIN
 PRINT *, &#x27;ABCDE&#x27;(2:4)
END
Produces:
 BCD

Such strings could be passed by reference to another subroutine, the length would also be passed transparently to the subroutine as a kind of short dope vector.
SUBROUTINE PRINT S(STR)
 CHARACTER *(*)STR
 PRINT *, STR
END

PROGRAM MAIN
 CALL PRINT S(&#x27;ABCDE&#x27;(2:4))
END
Again produces:
 BCD

===1983: Ada 83 and above===

Ada 83 supports slices for all array types. Like Fortran 77 such arrays could be passed by reference to another subroutine, the length would also be passed transparently to the subroutine as a kind of short dope vector.
with Text_IO;
procedure Main is
 Text : String := &quot;ABCDE&quot;;
begin
 Text_IO.Put_Line (Text (2 .. 4));
end Main;
Produces:
 BCD

Note: Since in Ada indices are n-based the term codice_18 will result in an Array with the base index of 2.

The definition for codice_19 is:
package Ada.Text_IO is
 procedure Put_Line(Item : in String);
The definition for codice_20 is:
package Standard is

 subtype Positive is Integer range 1 .. Integer&#x27;Last;

 type String is array(Positive range &lt;&gt;) of Character;
 pragma Pack(String);
As Ada supports true negative indices as in codice_21 it places no special meaning on negative indices. In the example above the term codice_22 would slice the codice_23 from 31 BC to 30 AD (since there was no year zero, the year number 0 actually refers to 1 BC).

===1987: Perl===
If we have
@a = (2, 5, 7, 3, 8, 6, 4);
as above, then the first 3 elements, middle 3 elements and last 3 elements would be:
@a[0..2]; # (2, 5, 7)
@a[2..4]; # (7, 3, 8)
@a[-3..-1]; # (8, 6, 4)
Perl supports negative list indices. The -1 index is the last element, -2 the penultimate element, etc.
In addition, Perl supports slicing based on expressions, for example:
@a[ 3.. $#a ]; # 4th element until the end (3, 8, 6, 4)
@a[ grep { !($_ % 3) } (0...$#a) ]; # 1st, 4th and 7th element (2,3,4)
@a[ grep { !(($_+1) % 3) } (0..$#a) ]; # every 3rd element (7,6)
===1991: Python===
If you have the following list:
»&gt; nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 20]
Then it is possible to slice by using a notation similar to element retrieval:
»&gt; nums[3] # no slicing
7
»&gt; nums[:3] # from index 0 (inclusive) until index 3 (exclusive)
[1, 3, 5]
»&gt; nums[1:5]
[3, 5, 7, 8]
»&gt; nums[-3:]
[8, 13, 20]

Note that Python allows negative list indices. The index -1 represents the last element, -2 the penultimate element, etc.
Python also allows a step property by appending an extra colon and a value. For example:

»&gt; nums[3:]
[7, 8, 13, 20]
»&gt; nums[3::] # == nums[3:]
[7, 8, 13, 20]
»&gt; nums[::3] # starting at index 0 and getting every third element
[1, 7, 20]
»&gt; nums[1:5:2] # from index 1 until index 5 and getting every second element
[3, 7]
The stride syntax (codice_24) was introduced in the second half of the 1990s, as a result of requests put forward by scientific users in the Python &quot;matrix-SIG&quot; (special interest group).

Slice semantics potentially differ per object; new semantics can be introduced when operator overloading the indexing operator. With Python standard lists (which are dynamic arrays), every slice is a copy. Slices of NumPy arrays, by contrast, are views onto the same underlying buffer.

===1992: Fortran 90 and above===
In Fortran 90, slices are specified in the form
lower_bound:upper_bound[:stride]
Both bounds are inclusive and can be omitted, in which case they default to the declared
array bounds. Stride defaults to 1. Example:
real, dimension(m, n):: a ! declaration of a matrix
print *, a(:, 2) ! second column
print *, a(m, :) ! last row
print *, a(:10, :10) ! leading 10-by-10 submatrix
===1994: Analytica===
Each dimension of an array value in Analytica is identified by an Index variable. When slicing or subscripting, the syntax identifies the dimension(s) over which you are slicing or subscripting by naming the dimension. Such as:

Naming indexes in slicing and subscripting is similar to naming parameters in function calls instead of relying on a fixed sequence of parameters. One advantage of naming indexes in slicing is that the programmer does not have to remember the sequence of Indexes, in a multidimensional array. A deeper advantage is that expressions generalize automatically and safely without requiring a rewrite when the number of dimensions of X changes.

===1998: S-Lang===
Array slicing was introduced in version 1.0. Earlier versions did not
support this feature.

Suppose that A is a 1-d array such as

Then an array B of first 5 elements of A may be created using

Similarly, B may be assigned to an array of the last 5 elements of A via:

Other examples of 1-d slicing include:
Slicing of higher-dimensional arrays works similarly:
Array indices can also be arrays of integers. For example, suppose
that codice_25 is an array of 10 integers. Then
codice_26 is equivalent to an array of the first 10 elements
of codice_27. A practical example of this is a sorting
operation such as:
===1999: D===
Consider the array:
int[] a = [2, 5, 7, 3, 8, 6, 4, 1];
Take a slice out of it:
int[] b = a[2 .. 5];
and the contents of codice_28 will be codice_29. The first index of the slice is inclusive, the second is exclusive.
auto c = a[$ - 4 .. $ - 2];
means that the dynamic array codice_30 now contains codice_31 because inside the [] the codice_32 symbol refers to the length of the array.

D array slices are aliased to the original array, so:
b[2] = 10;
means that codice_33 now has the contents codice_34. To create a copy of the array data, instead of only an alias, do:
auto b = a[2 .. 5].dup;
Unlike Python, D slice bounds don&#x27;t saturate, so code equivalent to this Python code is an error in D:
»&gt; d = [10, 20, 30]
»&gt; d[1 : 5]
[20, 30]
===2004: SuperCollider===
The programming language SuperCollider implements some concepts from J/APL. Slicing looks as follows:
a = [3, 1, 5, 7] // assign an array to the variable a
a[0..1] // return the first two elements of a
a[..1] // return the first two elements of a: the zero can be omitted
a[2..] // return the element 3 till last one
a0, 3 // return the first and the fourth element of a

a0, 3 = [100, 200] // replace the first and the fourth element of a
a[2..] = [100, 200] // replace the two last elements of a

// assign a multidimensional array to the variable a
a = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], [15, 16, 17, 18, 19; 
a.slice(2, 3); // take a slice with coordinates 2 and 3 (returns 13)
a.slice(nil, 3); // take an orthogonal slice (returns [3, 8, 13, 18])
===2005: fish===
Arrays in fish are always one-based, thus the indices of a new slice will begin with &quot;one&quot;, regardless of the previous indices.

&gt; set A (seq 3 2 11) # $A is an array with the values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11
&gt; echo $A[(seq 2)] # Print the first two elements of $A 
3 5
&gt; set B $A[1 2] # $B contains the first and second element of $A, i.e. 3, 5
&gt; set -e A[$B]; echo $A # Erase the third and fifth elements of $A, print $A
3 5 9
===2006: Cobra===
Cobra supports Python-style slicing. If you have a list
nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 20]
then the first 3 elements, middle 3 elements, and last 3 elements would be:
nums[:3] # equals [1, 3, 5]
nums[2:5] # equals [5, 7, 8]
nums[-3:] # equals [8, 13, 20]
Cobra also supports slicing-style syntax for &#x27;numeric for loops&#x27;:

for i in 2 : 5
 print i
# prints 2, 3, 4

for j in 3
 print j
# prints 0, 1, 2
===2006: Windows PowerShell===
Arrays are zero-based in PowerShell and can be defined using the comma operator:
PS&gt; $a = 2, 5, 7, 3, 8, 6, 4, 1
PS&gt; # Print the first two elements of $a:
PS&gt; Write-Host -NoNewline $a[0, 1]
2 5
PS&gt; # Take a slice out of it using the range operator:
PS&gt; Write-Host -NoNewline $a[2..5]
7 3 8 6
PS&gt; # Get the last 3 elements:
PS&gt; Write-Host -NoNewline $a[-3..-1]
6 4 1
PS&gt; # Return the content of the array in reverse order:
PS&gt; Write-Host -NoNewline $a[($a.Length - 1)..0] # Length is a property of System.Object[]
1 4 6 8 3 7 5 2
===2009: Go===
Go supports Python-style syntax for slicing (except negative indices are not supported). Arrays and slices can be sliced. If you have a slice
nums := []int{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 20}
then the first 3 elements, middle 3 elements, last 3 elements, and a copy of the entire slice would be:
nums[:3] // equals []int{1, 3, 5}
nums[2:5] // equals []int{5, 7, 8}
nums[4:] // equals []int{8, 13, 20}
nums[:] // equals []int{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 20}
Slices in Go are reference types, which means that different slices may refer to the same underlying array.

===2010: Cilk Plus===
Cilk Plus supports syntax for array slicing as an extension to C and C++.
array_base [lower_bound:length[:stride]]*

Cilk Plus slicing looks as follows:

A[:] // All of vector A
B[2:6] // Elements 2 to 7 of vector B
C[:][5] // Column 5 of matrix C
D[0:3:2] // Elements 0, 2, 4 of vector D
Cilk Plus&#x27;s array slicing differs from Fortran&#x27;s in two ways:

* the second parameter is the length (number of elements in the slice) instead of the upper bound, in order to be consistent with standard C libraries;
* slicing never produces a temporary, and thus never needs to allocate memory. Assignments are required to be either non-overlapping or perfectly overlapping, otherwise the result is undefined.

===2012: Julia===
Julia array slicing is like that of MATLAB, but uses square brackets. Example:
julia&gt; x = rand(4, 3)
4x3 Array{Float64,2}:
 0.323877 0.186253 0.600605
 0.404664 0.894781 0.0955007
 0.223562 0.18859 0.120011
 0.149316 0.779823 0.0690126

julia&gt; x[:, 2] # get the second column.
4-element Array{Float64,1}:
 0.186253
 0.894781
 0.18859
 0.779823

julia&gt; x[1, :] # get the first row.
1x3 Array{Float64,2}:
 0.323877 0.186253 0.600605

julia&gt; x[1:2,2:3] # get the submatrix spanning rows 1,2 and columns 2,3
2x2 Array{Float64,2}:
 0.186253 0.600605
 0.894781 0.0955007

<text>Jeffrey Glenn Miller (March 28, 1950 – May 4, 1970) was an American student at Kent State University in Kent, Ohio, who was killed by the Ohio Army National Guard in the Kent State shootings. He had been protesting against the invasion of Cambodia and the presence of the National Guard on the Kent State campus. National Guardsmen opened fire on a group of unarmed students, killing Miller and three others.

==Biography==
Miller was born on March 28, 1950, in New York, the son of Elaine Holstein and Bernard Miller. He was Jewish.

Four months before his death in May 1970, Miller had transferred to Kent State from Michigan State University. While at Michigan State, Miller pledged Phi Kappa Tau fraternity where his older brother, Russell, had been a member. He and his brother had always been close and shared a birthday. After his brother graduated from Michigan State, Miller found himself feeling increasingly out of touch with the dominant culture at Michigan State. During the summer of 1969, an old friend from New York who attended Kent State urged Miller to consider transferring. He left Michigan State with four like-minded friends, also MSU students, in January 1970, traveling together to Ann Arbor. He had protested the Vietnam War with these friends at MSU. He went on to Kent State while three of the five remained in Ann Arbor. He quickly adapted to Kent State and soon had many friends, including Allison Krause and Sandra Scheuer. Both Krause and Scheuer — alongside William Schroeder — died alongside Miller on May 4.

==Death==
Miller had taken part in the protests that day and had thrown a tear gas canister back at the Ohio National Guardsmen who had originally fired it. The protests, initially against the expansion of the Vietnam War into Cambodia, had escalated into a protest against the presence of the Ohio National Guard on the Kent State campus. Miller was unarmed when he was shot; he had been facing the Guardsmen while standing in an access road leading into the Prentice Hall parking lot at a distance of approximately . A single bullet entered his open mouth and exited at the base of his posterior skull, killing him instantly. John Filo&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning photo features Mary Ann Vecchio, a 14-year-old runaway, kneeling over Miller&#x27;s dead body.

Three other students were shot and killed at Kent State on the day: Allison Krause, Sandra Scheuer, and William Schroeder; nine others were wounded, including one who was paralyzed for life. These and other shootings led to protests and a national student strike, closing hundreds of campuses. The Kent State campus remained closed for six weeks. Five days after the shootings, 100,000 people demonstrated in Washington, D.C., against the war and the military–industrial complex and protesting the killing of unarmed student protestors by American soldiers on a college campus.

Eleven days after the Kent State shootings, on May 15, 1970, two students were shot and killed and 12 were injured at Jackson State University by the Jackson Police and Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol officers.

Miller was cremated and his ashes were placed in a niche in the community mausoleum (Unit 7, Alcove H-O, Column O, Niche 1) at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York. A memorial was erected at Plainview – Old Bethpage John F. Kennedy High School, the high school that was built in the mid-1960s in the same town as Miller&#x27;s high school in Plainview, New York. Miller&#x27;s mother had been a secretary to the principal of John F. Kennedy High School in the 1960s. There is a Kent State Memorial Lecture Fund at MIT established in 1970 by one of Miller&#x27;s childhood friends. The university has also placed a memorial at the spot where Miller died.

<text>In electronics and electrical engineering, a fuse is an electrical safety device that operates to provide overcurrent protection of an electrical circuit. Its essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it, thereby stopping or interrupting the current. It is a sacrificial device; once a fuse has operated, it is an open circuit, and must be replaced or rewired, depending on its type.

Fuses have been used as essential safety devices from the early days of electrical engineering. Today there are thousands of different fuse designs which have specific current and voltage ratings, breaking capacity, and response times, depending on the application. The time and current operating characteristics of fuses are chosen to provide adequate protection without needless interruption. Wiring regulations usually define a maximum fuse current rating for particular circuits. A fuse can be used to mitigate short circuits, overloading, mismatched loads, or device failure. When a damaged live wire makes contact with a metal case that is connected to ground, a short circuit will form and the fuse will melt.

A fuse is an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system, often abbreviated to ADS (automatic disconnection of supply). Circuit breakers can be used as an alternative to fuses, but have significantly different characteristics.

==History==
Louis Clément François Breguet recommended the use of reduced-section conductors to protect telegraph stations from lightning strikes; by melting, the smaller wires would protect apparatus and wiring inside the building. A variety of wire or foil fusible elements were in use to protect telegraph cables and lighting installations as early as 1864.

A fuse was patented by Thomas Edison in 1890 as part of his electric distribution system.

==Construction==
A fuse consists of a metal strip or wire fuse element, of small cross-section compared to the circuit conductors, mounted between a pair of electrical terminals, and (usually) enclosed by a non-combustible housing. The fuse is arranged in series to carry all the charge passing through the protected circuit. The resistance of the element generates heat due to the current flow. The size and construction of the element is (empirically) determined so that the heat produced for a normal current does not cause the element to attain a high temperature. If too high of a current flows, the element rises to a higher temperature and either directly melts, or else melts a soldered joint within the fuse, opening the circuit.

The fuse element is made of zinc, copper, silver, aluminum, or alloys among these or other various metals to provide stable and predictable characteristics. The fuse ideally would carry its rated current indefinitely, and melt quickly on a small excess. The element must not be damaged by minor harmless surges of current, and must not oxidize or change its behavior after possibly years of service.

The fuse elements may be shaped to increase heating effect. In large fuses, current may be divided between multiple strips of metal. A dual-element fuse may contain a metal strip that melts instantly on a short circuit, and also contain a low-melting solder joint that responds to long-term overload of low values compared to a short circuit. Fuse elements may be supported by steel or nichrome wires, so that no strain is placed on the element, but a spring may be included to increase the speed of parting of the element fragments.

The fuse element may be surrounded by air, or by materials intended to speed the quenching of the arc. Silica sand or non-conducting liquids may be used.

==Characteristics==

===Rated current IN===
A maximum current that the fuse can continuously conduct without interrupting the circuit.

===Time vs current characteristics===
The speed at which a fuse blows depends on how much current flows through it and the material of which the fuse is made. Manufacturers can provide a plot of current vs time, often plotted on logarithmic scales, to characterize the device and to allow comparison with the characteristics of protective devices upstream and downstream of the fuse.

The operating time is not a fixed interval but decreases as the current increases. Fuses are designed to have particular characteristics of operating time compared to current. A standard fuse may require twice its rated current to open in one second, a fast-blow fuse may require twice its rated current to blow in 0.1 seconds, and a slow-blow fuse may require twice its rated current for tens of seconds to blow.

Fuse selection depends on the load&#x27;s characteristics. Semiconductor devices may use a fast or &quot;ultrafast&quot; fuse as semiconductor devices heat rapidly when excess current flows. The fastest blowing fuses are designed for the most sensitive electrical equipment, where even a short exposure to an overload current could be damaging. Normal fast-blow fuses are the most general purpose fuses. A &quot;time-delay fuse&quot; (also known as an &quot;anti-surge&quot; or &quot;slow-blow&quot; fuse) is designed to allow a current which is above the rated value of the fuse to flow for a short period of time without the fuse blowing. These types of fuse are used on equipment such as motors, which can draw larger than normal currents for up to several seconds while coming up to speed.

===The I2t value===

The I2t rating is related to the amount of energy let through by the fuse element when it clears the electrical fault. This term is normally used in short circuit conditions and the values are used to perform co-ordination studies in electrical networks. I2t parameters are provided by charts in manufacturer data sheets for each fuse family. For coordination of fuse operation with upstream or downstream devices, both melting I2t and clearing I2t are specified. The melting I2t is proportional to the amount of energy required to begin melting the fuse element. The clearing I2t is proportional to the total energy let through by the fuse when clearing a fault. The energy is mainly dependent on current and time for fuses as well as the available fault level and system voltage. Since the I2t rating of the fuse is proportional to the energy it lets through, it is a measure of the thermal damage from the heat and magnetic forces that will be produced by a fault end.

===Breaking capacity===

The breaking capacity is the maximum current that can safely be interrupted by the fuse. This should be higher than the prospective short-circuit current. Miniature fuses may have an interrupting rating only 10 times their rated current. Fuses for small, low-voltage, usually residential, wiring systems are commonly rated, in North American practice, to interrupt 10,000 amperes. Fuses for commercial or industrial power systems must have higher interrupting ratings, with some low-voltage current-limiting high interrupting fuses rated for 300,000 amperes. Fuses for high-voltage equipment, up to 115,000 volts, are rated by the total apparent power (megavolt-amperes, MVA) of the fault level on the circuit.

Some fuses are designated high rupture capacity (HRC) or high breaking capacity (HBC) and are usually filled with sand or a similar material.
Low-voltage high rupture capacity (HRC) fuses are used in the area of main distribution boards in low-voltage networks where there is a high prospective short circuit current. They are generally larger than screw-type fuses, and have ferrule cap or blade contacts. High rupture capacity fuses may be rated to interrupt current of 120 kA.

HRC fuses are widely used in industrial installations and are also used in the public power grid, e.g. in transformer stations, main distribution boards, or in building junction boxes and as meter fuses.

In some countries, because of the high fault current available where these fuses are used, local regulations may permit only trained personnel to change these fuses. Some varieties of HRC fuse include special handling features.

===Rated voltage===
The voltage rating of the fuse must be equal to or, greater than, what would become the open-circuit voltage. For example, a glass tube fuse rated at 32 volts would not reliably interrupt current from a voltage source of 120 or 230 V. If a 32 V fuse attempts to interrupt the 120 or 230 V source, an arc may result. Plasma inside the glass tube may continue to conduct current until the current diminishes to the point where the plasma becomes a non-conducting gas. Rated voltage should be higher than the maximum voltage source it would have to disconnect. Connecting fuses in series does not increase the rated voltage of the combination, nor of any one fuse.

Medium-voltage fuses rated for a few thousand volts are never used on low voltage circuits, because of their cost and because they cannot properly clear the circuit when operating at very low voltages.

==Voltage drop==
The manufacturer may specify the voltage drop across the fuse at rated current. There is a direct relationship between a fuse&#x27;s cold resistance and its voltage drop value. Once current is applied, resistance and voltage drop of a fuse will constantly grow with the rise of its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The voltage drop should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications. Voltage drop often is not significant in more traditional wire type fuses, but can be significant in other technologies such as resettable (PPTC) type fuses.

==Temperature derating==
Ambient temperature will change a fuse&#x27;s operational parameters. A fuse rated for 1 A at 25 °C may conduct up to 10% or 20% more current at −40 °C and may open at 80% of its rated value at 100 °C. Operating values will vary with each fuse family and are provided in manufacturer data sheets.

==Markings==

Most fuses are marked on the body or end caps with markings that indicate their ratings. Surface-mount technology &quot;chip type&quot; fuses feature few or no markings, making identification very difficult.

Similar appearing fuses may have significantly different properties, identified by their markings. Fuse markings will generally convey the following information, either explicitly as text, or else implicit with the approval agency marking for a particular type:
* Current rating of the fuse.
* Voltage rating of the fuse.
* Time-current characteristic; i.e. fuse speed.
* Approvals by national and international standards agencies.
* Manufacturer/part number/series.
* Interrupting rating (breaking capacity)

==Packages and materials==

Fuses come in a vast array of sizes and styles to serve in many applications, manufactured in standardised package layouts to make them easily interchangeable. Fuse bodies may be made of ceramic, glass, plastic, fiberglass, molded mica laminates, or molded compressed fibre depending on application and voltage class.

Cartridge (ferrule) fuses have a cylindrical body terminated with metal end caps. Some cartridge fuses are manufactured with end caps of different sizes to prevent accidental insertion of the wrong fuse rating in a holder, giving them a bottle shape.

Fuses for low voltage power circuits may have bolted blade or tag terminals which are secured by screws to a fuseholder. Some blade-type terminals are held by spring clips. Blade type fuses often require the use of a special purpose extractor tool to remove them from the fuse holder.

Renewable fuses have replaceable fuse elements, allowing the fuse body and terminals to be reused if not damaged after a fuse operation.

Fuses designed for soldering to a printed circuit board have radial or axial wire leads. Surface mount fuses have solder pads instead of leads.

High-voltage fuses of the expulsion type have fiber or glass-reinforced plastic tubes and an open end, and can have the fuse element replaced.

&quot;Semi-enclosed fuses&quot; are fuse wire carriers in which the fusible wire itself can be replaced. The exact fusing current is not as well controlled as an enclosed fuse, and it is extremely important to use the correct diameter and material when replacing the fuse wire, and for these reasons these fuses are slowly falling from favour.

These are still used in consumer units in some parts of the world, but are becoming less common.
While glass fuses have the advantage of a fuse element visible for inspection purposes, they have a low breaking capacity (interrupting rating), which generally restricts them to applications of 15 A or less at 250 VAC. Ceramic fuses have the advantage of a higher breaking capacity, facilitating their use in circuits with higher current and voltage. Filling a fuse body with sand provides additional cooling of the arc and increases the breaking capacity of the fuse. Medium-voltage fuses may have liquid-filled envelopes to assist in the extinguishing of the arc. Some types of distribution switchgear use fuse links immersed in the oil that fills the equipment.

Fuse packages may include a rejection feature such as a pin, slot, or tab, which prevents interchange of otherwise similar appearing fuses. For example, fuse holders for North American class RK fuses have a pin that prevents installation of similar-appearing class H fuses, which have a much lower breaking capacity and a solid blade terminal that lacks the slot of the RK type.

==Dimensions==
Fuses can be built with different sized enclosures to prevent interchange of different ratings of fuse. For example, &quot;bottle style&quot; fuses distinguish between ratings with different cap diameters. Automotive glass fuses were made in different lengths, to prevent high-rated fuses being installed in a circuit intended for a lower rating.

===Special features===
Glass cartridge and plug fuses allow direct inspection of the fusible element. Other fuses have other indication methods including:
* Indicating pin or striker pin — extends out of the fuse cap when the element is blown.
* Indicating disc — a coloured disc (flush mounted in the end cap of the fuse) falls out when the element is blown.
* Element window — a small window built into the fuse body to provide visual indication of a blown element.
* External trip indicator — similar function to striker pin, but can be externally attached (using clips) to a compatible fuse.

Some fuses allow a special purpose micro switch or relay unit to be fixed to the fuse body. When the fuse element blows, the indicating pin extends to activate the micro switch or relay, which, in turn, triggers an event.

Some fuses for medium-voltage applications use two or three separate barrels and two or three fuse elements in parallel.

==Fuse standards==

===IEC 60269 fuses===
The International Electrotechnical Commission publishes standard 60269 for low-voltage power fuses. The standard is in four volumes, which describe general requirements, fuses for industrial and commercial applications, fuses for residential applications, and fuses to protect semiconductor devices. The IEC standard unifies several national standards, thereby improving the interchangeability of fuses in international trade. All fuses of different technologies tested to meet IEC standards will have similar time-current characteristics, which simplifies design and maintenance.

===UL 248 fuses (North America)===
In the United States and Canada, low-voltage fuses to 1 kV AC rating are made in accordance with Underwriters Laboratories standard UL 248 or the harmonized Canadian Standards Association standard C22.2 No. 248. This standard applies to fuses rated 1 kV or less, AC or DC, and with breaking capacity up to 200 kA. These fuses are intended for installations following Canadian Electrical Code, Part I (CEC), or the National Electrical Code, NFPA 70 (NEC).

The standard ampere ratings for fuses (and circuit breakers) in USA/Canada are considered 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 1000, 1200, 1600, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, 5000, and 6000 amperes. Additional standard ampere ratings for fuses are 1, 3, 6, 10, and 601.

UL 248 currently has 19 &quot;parts&quot;. UL 248-1 sets the general requirements for fuses, while the latter parts are dedicated to specific fuses sizes (ex: 248-8 for Class J, 248-10 for Class L), or for categories of fuses with unique properties (ex: 248-13 for semiconductor fuses, 248-19 for photovoltaic fuses). The general requirements (248-1) apply except as modified by the supplemental part (240-x). For example, UL 248-19 allows photovoltaic fuses to be rated up to 1500 volts, DC, versus 1000 volts under the general requirements.

IEC and UL nomenclature varies slightly. IEC standards refer to a &quot;fuse&quot; as the assembly of a fusible link and a fuse holder. In North American standards, the &quot;fuse&quot; is the replaceable portion of the assembly, and a &quot;fuse link&quot; would be a bare metal element for installation in a fuse.

==Automotive fuses==

&quot;Automotive fuses&quot; are used to protect the wiring and electrical equipment for vehicles. There are several different types of automotive fuses and their usage is dependent upon the specific application, voltage, and current demands of the electrical circuit. Automotive fuses can be mounted in fuse blocks, inline fuse holders, or fuse clips. Some automotive fuses are occasionally used in non-automotive electrical applications. Standards for automotive fuses are published by SAE International (formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers).

Automotive fuses can be classified into four distinct categories:
* Blade fuses
* Glass tube or Bosch type
* Fusible links
* Fuse limiters

Most automotive fuses rated at 32 volts are used on circuits rated 24 volts DC and below. Some vehicles use a dual 12/42 V DC electrical system that will require a fuse rated at 58 V DC.

==High voltage fuses==

Fuses are used on power systems up to 115,000 volts AC. High-voltage fuses are used to protect instrument transformers used for electricity metering, or for small power transformers where the expense of a circuit breaker is not warranted. A circuit breaker at 115 kV may cost up to five times as much as a set of power fuses, so the resulting saving can be tens of thousands of dollars.

In medium-voltage distribution systems, a power fuse may be used to protect a transformer serving 1–3 houses. Pole-mounted distribution transformers are nearly always protected by a fusible cutout, which can have the fuse element replaced using live-line maintenance tools.

Medium-voltage fuses are also used to protect motors, capacitor banks and transformers and may be mounted in metal enclosed switchgear, or (rarely in new designs) on open switchboards.

===Expulsion fuses===
Large power fuses use fusible elements made of silver, copper or tin to provide stable and predictable performance. High voltage &quot;expulsion fuses&quot; surround the fusible link with gas-evolving substances, such as boric acid. When the fuse blows, heat from the arc causes the boric acid to evolve large volumes of gases. The associated high pressure (often greater than 100 atmospheres) and cooling gases rapidly quench the resulting arc. The hot gases are then explosively expelled out of the end(s) of the fuse. Such fuses can only be used outdoors.

These type of fuses may have an impact pin to operate a switch mechanism, so that all three phases are interrupted if any one fuse blows.

&quot;High-power fuse&quot; means that these fuses can interrupt several kiloamperes. Some manufacturers have tested their fuses for up to 63 kA short-circuit current.

==Comparison with circuit breakers==
Fuses have the advantages of often being less costly and simpler than a circuit breaker for similar ratings. The blown fuse must be replaced with a new device which is less convenient than simply resetting a breaker and therefore likely to discourage people from ignoring faults. On the other hand, replacing a fuse without isolating the circuit first (most building wiring designs do not provide individual isolation switches for each fuse) can be dangerous in itself, particularly if the fault is a short circuit.

In terms of protection response time, fuses tend to isolate faults more quickly (depending on their operating time) than circuit breakers. A fuse can clear a fault within a quarter cycle of the fault current, while a circuit breaker may take around half to one cycle to clear the fault. The response time of a fuse can be as fast as 0.002 seconds, whereas a circuit breaker typically responds in the range of 0.02 to 0.05 seconds.

High rupturing capacity fuses can be rated to safely interrupt up to 300,000 amperes at 600 V AC. Special current-limiting fuses are applied ahead of some molded-case breakers to protect the breakers in low-voltage power circuits with high short-circuit levels.

&quot;Current-limiting&quot; fuses operate so quickly that they limit the total &quot;let-through&quot; energy that passes into the circuit, helping to protect downstream equipment from damage. These fuses open in less than one cycle of the AC power frequency; circuit breakers cannot match this speed.

Some types of circuit breakers must be maintained on a regular basis to ensure their mechanical operation during an interruption. This is not the case with fuses, which rely on melting processes where no mechanical operation is required for the fuse to operate under fault conditions.

In a multi-phase power circuit, if only one fuse opens, the remaining phases will have higher than normal currents, and unbalanced voltages, with possible damage to motors. Fuses only sense overcurrent, or to a degree, over-temperature, and cannot usually be used independently with protective relaying to provide more advanced protective functions, for example, ground fault detection.

Some manufacturers of medium-voltage distribution fuses combine the overcurrent protection characteristics of the fusible element with the flexibility of relay protection by adding a pyrotechnic device to the fuse operated by external protective relays.

For domestic applications, Miniature circuit breakers (MCB) are widely used as an alternative to fuses. Their rated current depend on the load current of the equipment to be protected and the ambient operational temperature. They are available in the following ratings: 6A, 10A, 16A, 20A, 25A, 32A, 45A, 50A, 63A, 80A, 100A, 125A.

==Fuse boxes==

=== United Kingdom ===
In the UK, older electrical consumer units (also called fuse boxes) are fitted either with semi-enclosed (rewirable) fuses or cartridge fuses (Fuse wire is commonly supplied to consumers as short lengths of 5 A-, 15 A- and 30 A-rated wire wound on a piece of cardboard.) Modern consumer units usually contain miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) instead of fuses, though cartridge fuses are sometimes still used, as in some applications MCBs are prone to nuisance tripping.

Renewable fuses (rewirable or cartridge) allow user replacement, but this can be hazardous as it is easy to put a higher-rated or double fuse element (link or wire) into the holder (&quot;overfusing&quot;), or simply fitting it with copper wire or even a totally different type of conducting object (coins, hairpins, paper clips, nails, etc.) to the existing carrier. One form of fuse box abuse was to put a penny in the socket, which defeated overcurrent protection and resulted in a dangerous condition. Such tampering will not be visible without full inspection of the fuse. Fuse wire was never used in North America for this reason, although renewable fuses continue to be made for distribution boards.

The &quot;Wylex standard&quot; consumer unit was very popular in the United Kingdom until the wiring regulations started demanding residual-current devices (RCDs) for sockets that could feasibly supply equipment outside the equipotential zone. The design does not allow for fitting of RCDs or RCBOs. Some Wylex standard models were made with an RCD instead of the main switch, but (for consumer units supplying the entire installation) this is no longer compliant with the wiring regulations as alarm systems should &quot;not&quot; be RCD-protected. There are two styles of fuse base that can be screwed into these units: one designed for rewirable fusewire carriers and one designed for cartridge fuse carriers. Over the years MCBs have been made for both styles of base. In both cases, higher rated carriers had wider pins, so a carrier couldn&#x27;t be changed for a higher rated one without also changing the base. Cartridge fuse carriers are also now available for DIN-rail enclosures.

=== North America ===
In North America, fuses were used in buildings wired before 1960. These &quot;Edison base&quot; fuses would screw into a fuse socket similar to Edison-base incandescent lamps. Ratings were 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 amperes. To prevent installation of fuses with an excessive current rating, later fuse boxes included rejection features in the fuse-holder socket, commonly known as &quot;Rejection Base (Type S fuses)&quot; which have smaller diameters that vary depending on the rating of the fuse. This means that fuses can only be replaced by the preset (Type S) fuse rating. This is a North American, tri-national standard (UL 4248–11; CAN/CSA-C22.2 NO. 4248.11-07 (R2012); and, NMX-J-009/4248/11-ANCE). Existing Edison fuse boards can easily be converted to only accept Rejection Base (Type S) fuses, by screwing-in a tamper-proof adapter. This adapter screws into the existing Edison fuse holder, and has a smaller diameter threaded hole to accept the designated Type S rated fuse.

Some companies manufacture resettable miniature thermal circuit breakers, which screw into a fuse socket. Some installations use these Edison-base circuit breakers. However, any such breaker sold today does have one flaw. It may be installed in a circuit-breaker box with a door. If so, if the door is closed, the door may hold down the breaker&#x27;s reset button. While in this state, the breaker is effectively useless: it does not provide any overcurrent protection.

In the 1950s, fuses in new residential or industrial construction for branch circuit protection were superseded by low voltage circuit breakers.

Fuses are widely used for protection of electric motor circuits; for small overloads, the motor protection circuit will open the controlling contactor automatically, and the fuse will only operate for short circuits or extreme overload.

==Coordination of fuses in series==
Where several fuses are connected in series at the various levels of a power distribution system, it is desirable to blow (clear) only the fuse (or other overcurrent device) electrically closest to the fault. This process is called &quot;coordination&quot; and may require the time-current characteristics of two fuses to be plotted on a common current basis. Fuses are selected so that the minor branch fuse disconnects its circuit well before the supplying, feeder fuse starts to melt. In this way, only the faulty circuit is interrupted with minimal disturbance to other circuits fed by a common supplying fuse. 

Where the fuses in a system are of similar types, simple rule-of-thumb ratios between ratings of the fuse closest to the load and the next fuse towards the source can be used.

==Other circuit protectors==

===Resettable fuses===

So-called self-resetting fuses use a thermoplastic conductive element known as a polymeric positive temperature coefficient (PPTC) thermistor that impedes the circuit during an overcurrent condition (by increasing device resistance). The PPTC thermistor is self-resetting in that when current is removed, the device will cool and revert to low resistance. These devices are often used in aerospace/nuclear applications where replacement is difficult, or on a computer motherboard so that a shorted mouse or keyboard does not cause motherboard damage.

===Thermal fuses===
A &quot;thermal fuse&quot; is often found in consumer equipment such as coffee makers, hair dryers or transformers powering small consumer electronics devices. They contain a fusible, temperature-sensitive composition which holds a spring contact mechanism normally closed. When the surrounding temperature gets too high, the composition melts and allows the spring contact mechanism to break the circuit. The device can be used to prevent a fire in a hair dryer for example, by cutting off the power supply to the heater elements when the air flow is interrupted (e.g., the blower motor stops or the air intake becomes accidentally blocked). Thermal fuses are a &#x27;one shot&#x27;, non-resettable device which must be replaced once they have been activated (blown).

===Cable limiter===
A cable limiter is similar to a fuse but is intended only for protection of low voltage power cables. It is used, for example, in networks where multiple cables may be used in parallel. It is not intended to provide overload protection, but instead protects a cable that is exposed to a short circuit. The characteristics of the limiter are matched to the size of cable so that the limiter clears a fault before the cable insulation is damaged.

==Unicode symbol==
The Unicode character for the fuse&#x27;s schematic symbol, found in the Miscellaneous Technical block, is (⏛).

<text>In an explosive, pyrotechnic device, or military munition, a fuse (or fuze) is the part of the device that initiates function. In common usage, the word fuse is used indiscriminately. However, when being specific (and in particular in a military context), the term &quot;fuse&quot; describes a simple pyrotechnic initiating device, like the cord on a firecracker whereas the term &quot;fuze&quot; is used when referring to a more sophisticated ignition device incorporating mechanical and/or electronic components, such as a proximity fuze for an M107 artillery shell, magnetic or acoustic fuze on a sea mine, spring-loaded grenade fuze, pencil detonator, or anti-handling device.

==History==


Documented evidence suggests that the earliest fuses were first used by the Song Chinese between the 10th and 12th centuries. After the Chinese invented gunpowder, they began adapting its explosive properties for use in military technology. By 1044 they began utilising gunpowder in simple grenades, bombs, and flamethrowers fitted with fuses such as the Thunder-crash bomb.

The simplest form of fuse is the burning fuse, believed to date back to the 10th century and originating during the Chinese Song dynasty. This simple fuse consisted of lightweight paper filled with loose gunpowder, and served as a means of delaying ignition in fireworks. This simple form of burning fuse can still be found today in many modern fireworks. A version of this simple fuse is called visco fuse, and consists of the burning core coated with wax or lacquer for durability and water resistance. Early fuses for grenades also consist of a wooden plug with a longitudinal hole filled with a slow burning gunpowder mixture inserted into the grenade. Such fuses were in use until the 18th century. The commercial and military version of a burning fuse referred to as safety fuse (invented by William Bickford) is a textile tube filled with combustible material and wrapped to prevent external exposure of the burning core. Safety fuses are used to initiate the detonation of explosives through the use of a blasting cap.

===Fuses===
Modern day safety fuses are often used in mining and military operations, to provide a time-delay before ignition, and they more often than not are used to initiate an explosive detonator, thereby starting an explosive chain reaction to detonate a larger more stable main charge. Safety fuses are typically colored green or black (military) or fluorescent orange (commercial) to distinguish them from detonating cords such as Primacord, which are brightly colored or transparent.

===Usage===
Fuses are found in pyrotechnics, model cannons, matchlock firearms, some improvised explosive devices, and many forms of fireworks.

==Types==
*A slow match is a very slow-burning fuse consisting of a hemp or cotton rope saturated with an oxidizer such as potassium nitrate. Slow matches are used as a source of fire for manually lighting other devices, such as matchlock guns, or fuses on black powder cannons. Before percussion caps, slow matches were most suitable for use around black-powder weapons because it could be roughly handled without going out, and only presented a small glowing tip instead of a large flame that risked igniting powder supplies nearby.
*Today&#x27;s punks (wood splints covered with ground plant pith or dung and then saturated with nitrate) used for lighting consumer fireworks are a type of slow match.
*A black match is a type of fuse consisting of cotton string coated with a dried slurry of black powder and glue. This acts as a simple pass-fire, and was used to fire ancient cannons. They are used today in fireworks construction.
*A quick match or piped match is a type of black powder fuse that burns very quickly, some hundreds of feet per second. They consist of black match covered with a loose paper wrap (pipe). When lit, the flame propagates quickly down the paper pipe from the hot gases produced by the burning powder. Quick matches are used in professional fireworks displays to pass fire nearly instantly between devices that must be physically separated while firing simultaneously, such as a finale rack. Devices which should fire in sequence can be branched from a single master fuse, consisting of quick match spliced onto Visco fuses of various length for time delays.
*A visco fuse has a core of black powder with one or more textile overwraps. The outer layers may be coated with wax or nitrocellulose lacquer for water resistance. These fuses are widely used in modern pyrotechnics because they burn at a uniform rate, with an easily visible external flame. Depending on their outer treatment, visco fuses are water resistant and the better quality can burn reliably underwater once lit, since the black powder core provides both its own fuel and oxidant.
*A safety fuse consists of a black powder core in a textile tube, covered with asphaltum or other waterproofing agent, and having an outer wrapper of tough textile or plastic. They are made in a standard diameter designed to be crimped into blasting caps. Once ignited, safety fuses will burn underwater, and have no external flame that might ignite methane or other fuels such as might be found in mines or other industrial environments. Safety fuses are manufactured with specified burn times per 30 cm, e.g. 60 seconds, which means that a length of fuse 30 cm long will take 60 seconds to burn. Manufacturers warn that although every effort is made to ensure uniform burn times, safety fuses are subject to variation depending on conditions and should be used with adequate safety measures in place.
*An electric match (sometimes Igniter Safety Fuse Electric (ISFE)) lights a main fuse or device when activated by an electric current. They typically consist of a pair of wires leading to a thin resistance wire that heats when current is applied. The resistance wire is covered by a bit of pyrotechnic composition that ignites from the wire heating, providing enough fire to reliably ignite the main fuse via a mechanical connection, or the device directly. Estes model rocket motors are lit by a type of electric match. Large fireworks displays are launched with complex timing sequences using a computer that energizes electric matches connected to the individual device fuses.
*A flying fish fuse (bumblebee) is an unusual type of component for fireworks. It is made like Visco fuse, but contains a metallic spark composition or other effect instead of black powder. Flying fish can thus perform as a main effect instead of just an initiator. For example, simply lighting a short piece of flying fish on the ground makes it fly through the air, seeming to swim in random directions, while emitting sparks and noise. An aerial shell loaded with many such pieces results in a myriad of pieces flying and sparking high in the air.
*A spolette is a delay fuse consisting of a hollow wooden dowel or a paper tube rammed full of black powder. A spolette is glued into the wall of a fireworks shell and ignited by the lift charge that launches the shell into the air. The spolette, after a delay that allows the shell to reach its top of trajectory, ignites the shell&#x27;s main effect(s). The tough wood construction ensures that the fuse burns reliably despite the explosive force and acceleration of the launch.
*The saucisson was an early form of fuse.

<doc id="683368" wikidata="Q2166280" url="?curid=683368" title="Young tableau">
<text>In mathematics, a Young tableau (; plural: tableaux) is a combinatorial object useful in representation theory and Schubert calculus. It provides a convenient way to describe the group representations of the symmetric and general linear groups and to study their properties. 

Young tableaux were introduced by Alfred Young, a mathematician at Cambridge University, in 1900. They were then applied to the study of the symmetric group by Georg Frobenius in 1903. Their theory was further developed by many mathematicians, including Percy MacMahon, W. V. D. Hodge, G. de B. Robinson, Gian-Carlo Rota, Alain Lascoux, Marcel-Paul Schützenberger and Richard P. Stanley.

==Definitions==

&quot;Note: this article uses the English convention for displaying Young diagrams and tableaux&quot;.

=== Diagrams ===

A Young diagram (also called a Ferrers diagram, particularly when represented using dots) is a finite collection of boxes, or cells, arranged in left-justified rows, with the row lengths in non-increasing order. Listing the number of boxes in each row gives a partition of a non-negative integer , the total number of boxes of the diagram. The Young diagram is said to be of shape , and it carries the same information as that partition. Containment of one Young diagram in another defines a partial ordering on the set of all partitions, which is in fact a lattice structure, known as Young&#x27;s lattice. Listing the number of boxes of a Young diagram in each column gives another partition, the conjugate or &quot;transpose&quot; partition of ; one obtains a Young diagram of that shape by reflecting the original diagram along its main diagonal.

There is almost universal agreement that in labeling boxes of Young diagrams by pairs of integers, the first index selects the row of the diagram, and the second index selects the box within the row. Nevertheless, two distinct conventions exist to display these diagrams, and consequently tableaux: the first places each row below the previous one, the second stacks each row on top of the previous one. Since the former convention is mainly used by Anglophones while the latter is often preferred by Francophones, it is customary to refer to these conventions respectively as the &quot;English notation&quot; and the &quot;French notation&quot;; for instance, in his book on symmetric functions, Macdonald advises readers preferring the French convention to &quot;read this book upside down in a mirror&quot; (Macdonald 1979, p. 2). This nomenclature probably started out as jocular. The English notation corresponds to the one universally used for matrices, while the French notation is closer to the convention of Cartesian coordinates; however, French notation differs from that convention by placing the vertical coordinate first. The figure on the right shows, using the English notation, the Young diagram corresponding to the partition (5, 4, 1) of the number 10. The conjugate partition, measuring the column lengths, is (3, 2, 2, 2, 1).

==== Arm and leg length ====
In many applications, for example when defining Jack functions, it is convenient to define the arm length &quot;a&quot;λ(&quot;s&quot;) of a box &quot;s&quot; as the number of boxes to the right of &quot;s&quot; in the diagram λ in English notation. Similarly, the leg length &quot;l&quot;λ(&quot;s&quot;) is the number of boxes below &quot;s&quot;. The hook length of a box &quot;s&quot; is the number of boxes to the right of &quot;s&quot; or below &quot;s&quot; in English notation, including the box &quot;s&quot; itself; in other words, the hook length is &quot;a&quot;λ(&quot;s&quot;) + &quot;l&quot;λ(&quot;s&quot;) + 1.

=== Tableaux ===
A Young tableau is obtained by filling in the boxes of the Young diagram with symbols taken from some &quot;alphabet&quot;, which is usually required to be a totally ordered set. Originally that alphabet was a set of indexed variables , , ..., but now one usually uses a set of numbers for brevity. In their original application to representations of the symmetric group, Young tableaux have distinct entries, arbitrarily assigned to boxes of the diagram. A tableau is called standard if the entries in each row and each column are increasing. The number of distinct standard Young tableaux on entries is given by the involution numbers
:1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232, 764, 2620, 9496, ... .

In other applications, it is natural to allow the same number to appear more than once (or not at all) in a tableau. A tableau is called semistandard, or &quot;column strict&quot;, if the entries weakly increase along each row and strictly increase down each column. Recording the number of times each number appears in a tableau gives a sequence known as the weight of the tableau. Thus the standard Young tableaux are precisely the semistandard tableaux of weight (1,1...,1), which requires every integer up to to occur exactly once.

In a standard Young tableau, the integer formula_1 is a descent if formula_2 appears in a row strictly below formula_1. The sum of the descents is called the major index of the tableau.

=== Variations ===

There are several variations of this definition: for example, in a row-strict tableau the entries strictly increase along the rows and weakly increase down the columns. Also, tableaux with &quot;decreasing&quot; entries have been considered, notably, in the theory of plane partitions. There are also generalizations such as domino tableaux or ribbon tableaux, in which several boxes may be grouped together before assigning entries to them.

=== Skew tableaux ===
A skew shape is a pair of partitions (, ) such that the Young diagram of contains the Young diagram of ; it is denoted by . If and , then the containment of diagrams means that for all . The skew diagram of a skew shape is the set-theoretic difference of the Young diagrams of and : the set of squares that belong to the diagram of but not to that of . A skew tableau of shape is obtained by filling the squares of the corresponding skew diagram; such a tableau is semistandard if entries increase weakly along each row, and increase strictly down each column, and it is standard if moreover all numbers from 1 to the number of squares of the skew diagram occur exactly once. While the map from partitions to their Young diagrams is injective, this is not the case for the map from skew shapes to skew diagrams; therefore the shape of a skew diagram cannot always be determined from the set of filled squares only. Although many properties of skew tableaux only depend on the filled squares, some operations defined on them do require explicit knowledge of and , so it is important that skew tableaux do record this information: two distinct skew tableaux may differ only in their shape, while they occupy the same set of squares, each filled with the same entries. Young tableaux can be identified with skew tableaux in which is the empty partition (0) (the unique partition of 0).

Any skew semistandard tableau of shape with positive integer entries gives rise to a sequence of partitions (or Young diagrams), by starting with , and taking for the partition places further in the sequence the one whose diagram is obtained from that of by adding all the boxes that contain a value  ≤  in ; this partition eventually becomes equal to . Any pair of successive shapes in such a sequence is a skew shape whose diagram contains at most one box in each column; such shapes are called horizontal strips. This sequence of partitions completely determines , and it is in fact possible to define (skew) semistandard tableaux as such sequences, as is done by Macdonald (Macdonald 1979, p. 4). This definition incorporates the partitions and in the data comprising the skew tableau.

== Overview of applications ==

Young tableaux have numerous applications in combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry. Various ways of counting Young tableaux have been explored and lead to the definition of and identities for Schur functions.

Many combinatorial algorithms on tableaux are known, including Schützenberger&#x27;s jeu de taquin and the Robinson–Schensted–Knuth correspondence. Lascoux and Schützenberger studied an associative product on the set of all semistandard Young tableaux, giving it the structure called the &quot;plactic monoid&quot; (French: &quot;le monoïde plaxique&quot;).

In representation theory, standard Young tableaux of size describe bases in irreducible representations of the symmetric group on letters. The standard monomial basis in a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of the general linear group are parametrized by the set of semistandard Young tableaux of a fixed shape over the alphabet {1, 2, ..., }. This has important consequences for invariant theory, starting from the work of Hodge on the homogeneous coordinate ring of the Grassmannian and further explored by Gian-Carlo Rota with collaborators, de Concini and Procesi, and Eisenbud. The Littlewood–Richardson rule describing (among other things) the decomposition of tensor products of irreducible representations of into irreducible components is formulated in terms of certain skew semistandard tableaux.

Applications to algebraic geometry center around Schubert calculus on Grassmannians and flag varieties. Certain important cohomology classes can be represented by Schubert polynomials and described in terms of Young tableaux.

==Applications in representation theory==

Young diagrams are in one-to-one correspondence with irreducible representations of the symmetric group over the complex numbers. They provide a convenient way of specifying the Young symmetrizers from which the irreducible representations are built. Many facts about a representation can be deduced from the corresponding diagram. Below, we describe two examples: determining the dimension of a representation and restricted representations. In both cases, we will see that some properties of a representation can be determined by using just its diagram. Young tableaux are involved in the use of the symmetric group in
quantum chemistry studies of atoms, molecules and solids.

Young diagrams also parametrize the irreducible polynomial representations of the general linear group (when they have at most nonempty rows), or the irreducible representations of the special linear group (when they have at most nonempty rows), or the irreducible complex representations of the special unitary group (again when they have at most nonempty rows). In these cases semistandard tableaux with entries up to play a central role, rather than standard tableaux; in particular it is the number of those tableaux that determines the dimension of the representation.

===Dimension of a representation===

The dimension of the irreducible representation of the symmetric group corresponding to a partition of is equal to the number of different standard Young tableaux that can be obtained from the diagram of the representation. This number can be calculated by the hook length formula.

A hook length of a box in Young diagram of shape is the number of boxes that are in the same row to the right of it plus those boxes in the same column below it, plus one (for the box itself). By the hook-length formula, the dimension of an irreducible representation is divided by the product of the hook lengths of all boxes in the diagram of the representation:

:formula_4

The figure on the right shows hook-lengths for all boxes in the diagram of the partition 10 = 5 + 4 + 1. Thus

:formula_5

Similarly, the dimension of the irreducible representation of corresponding to the partition &quot;λ&quot; of &quot;n&quot; (with at most &quot;r&quot; parts) is the number of semistandard Young tableaux of shape &quot;λ&quot; (containing only the entries from 1 to &quot;r&quot;), which is given by the hook-length formula:

: formula_6

where the index &quot;i&quot; gives the row and &quot;j&quot; the column of a box. For instance, for the partition (5,4,1) we get as dimension of the corresponding irreducible representation of (traversing the boxes by rows):

:formula_7

===Restricted representations===

A representation of the symmetric group on elements, is also a representation of the symmetric group on elements, . However, an irreducible representation of may not be irreducible for . Instead, it may be a direct sum of several representations that are irreducible for . These representations are then called the factors of the restricted representation (see also induced representation).

The question of determining this decomposition of the restricted representation of a given irreducible representation of &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;, corresponding to a partition of , is answered as follows. One forms the set of all Young diagrams that can be obtained from the diagram of shape by removing just one box (which must be at the end both of its row and of its column); the restricted representation then decomposes as a direct sum of the irreducible representations of corresponding to those diagrams, each occurring exactly once in the sum.

<text>General admiral or Admiral general was first a Dutch then Danish, German, Russian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish naval rank. Its historic origin is a title high military or naval dignitaries of early modern Europe sometimes held, for example the (nominal) commander-in-chief of the Dutch Republic&#x27;s navy (usually the Prince of Orange).

==Denmark==

In Denmark, the General Admiral () was the term for the commander-in-chief of the Dano-Norwegian navy. The rank below the General Admiral was Lieutenant General Admiral ().

==Germany==

In the German &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; of the Second World War, Generaladmiral was a rank senior to an Admiral, but junior to a Großadmiral. &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; was a four-star admiral rank, equivalent to a full admiral in the British and American navies. In the traditional German ranking system until World War II, an admiral was equivalent to a British or American vice admiral.

The sleeve insignia for a &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; was the same as that of a regular admiral, being a thick rank stripe below three regular stripes (&quot;&quot; in German naval parlance). &quot;Generaladmiral&quot;s wore a third pip on their shoulder boards to differentiate them from regular admirals. The German Army and Air Force equivalent of &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; was the rank colonel general ().

In 1943, a directive was issued that should the &quot;Oberbefehlshaber der Kriegsmarine&quot; (&quot;commander of the navy&quot;) hold the rank of &quot;Generaladmiral&quot;, he would wear the sleeve insignia of a grand admiral, but the shoulder boards of a &quot;Generaladmiral&quot;.

A similar practice was used in the German Army, allowing colonel generals to wear four pips on the shoulder board when engaged in duties befitting a field marshal.

The rank of &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; was first given to the future grand admiral Erich Raeder on 20 April 1936.

===List===
Other holders of the rank were:
* Conrad Albrecht (1 April 1939)
* Alfred Saalwächter (1 January 1940)
* Rolf Carls (19 July 1940)
* Hermann Boehm (1 April 1941)
* Karl Witzell (1 April 1941)
* Otto Schultze (31 August 1942)
* Wilhelm Marschall (1 February 1943)
* Otto Schniewind (1 March 1944)
* Walter Warzecha (1 March 1944)
* Oskar Kummetz (16 September 1944)
* Hans-Georg von Friedeburg (1 May 1945)

Notably, Karl Dönitz was promoted to grand admiral without becoming a &quot;Generaladmiral&quot; first.

==Portugal==
&quot;Almirante-general&quot; was the highest rank in the Portuguese Navy, from 1808 to 1812 and again, from 1892 to 1910. It was the naval equivalent to the rank of &quot;marechal-general&quot; (&quot;general field marshal&quot;) of the Portuguese Army.

The rank was initially introduced in 1808, to be assigned to the commander-in-chief of the navy. The &quot;almirante-general&quot; had similar functions to those of the former &quot;capitão-general da armada&quot; (captain general of the navy) which had been extinguished in 1796 and whose functions passed to the Board of the Admiralty. The rank was only given to Infante Pedro Carlos de Bragança, being extinguished when he died in 1812.

In 1892, the &quot;almirante-general&quot; rank was reintroduced as a mere ceremonial rank to be held by the King of Portugal in his constitutional function of supreme commander of the navy. As supreme commander of the army, the king also held the ceremonial rank of &quot;marechal-general&quot;. The last holder of the rank was King Manuel II.

==Russia==
General-admiral () was the highest rank of the Imperial Russian Navy as established by the Table of Ranks and equivalent to field marshal. This was purely an honorific rank and for much of its existence, it was awarded only to a person on active duty, usually for the head of the naval department, and typically a descendant of the Romanov royal family.

There were only ten holders of this rank:
* Count Franz Lefort (1695);
* Count Fedor Golovin, first Russian chancellor (1700);
* Count Fyodor Matveyevich Apraksin (1708);
* Count Andrei Ivanovich Osterman or Heinrich Johann Friedrich Ostermann (1740; dismissed 1741);
* Prince Mikhail Golitsyn (1756);
* Grand Duke (Emperor since 1796) Pavel Petrovich (1762);
* Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov (1770);
* Count Ivan Chernyshyov (1796);
* Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich (1831);
* Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich (1883).
The general admiral rank was abolished with the fall of the Empire and was not revived when rank distinctions were reintroduced during 1935–40. The rank of admiral of the fleet of the Soviet Union can be considered as a modern equivalent.

==Spain==
&quot;Almirante general&quot; is a rank in the Spanish Navy that is above an admiral, but subordinate to a captain general.

==Sweden==
&quot;Generalamiral&quot; is the highest rank of admiral that has existed in the Swedish Navy, created by Charles XI in the name of Admiral General (&quot;Amiralgeneral&quot;). Gustav III revived the rank in 1780, and the same year issued instructions for the General Admiral, which alone was the King in Council&#x27;s responsible for naval existence and betterment. The rank has been held by Henrik af Trolle (1780–84), Carl August Ehrensvärd (1792–94), Johan af Puke (1812), Victor von Stedingk (1818) and Rudolf Cederström (1823–28).

==In fiction==
&quot;Admiral General&quot; Aladeen from &quot;The Dictator&quot; (2012) is a parody of leaders who appoint themselves grandiose military ranks.

<text>Mutant Enemy Productions is an American production company founded in 1996 by Joss Whedon to produce &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. The company also produced the &quot;Buffy&quot; spin-off, &quot;Angel&quot;, and his two short-lived science fiction series, the space Western &quot;Firefly&quot; and his high-concept &quot;Dollhouse&quot;, produced by 20th Century Fox Television. Mutant Enemy also produced the internet series, &quot;Dr. Horrible&#x27;s Sing-Along Blog&quot; the film &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot; and the superhero series &quot;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.&quot;, along with ABC Studios and Marvel Television. Most recently, Mutant Enemy produced the supernatural fiction series &quot;The Nevers&quot; for HBO.

Its offices (made out of glass bricks) were on the lot of 20th Century Fox in Los Angeles, previously the home of Chris Carter&#x27;s Ten Thirteen Productions. According to March 2006&#x27;s issue of UK magazine &quot;The Word&quot;, the offices were closed not long after &quot;Angel&quot; was cancelled.

==Filmography==
The following table lists the production credits of &quot;Mutant Enemy&quot;:
==Name and logo==
===Name===
The name &quot;Mutant Enemy&quot; is taken from the song &quot;And You and I&quot; by progressive rock band Yes, of whom Whedon is a professed fan: &quot;There&#x27;ll be no mutant enemy/we shall certify/political ends/as sad remains will die.&quot; (On the special features of the &quot;Buffy&quot; DVDs, Whedon also says in an interview that he called his typewriter &quot;mutant enemy&quot;.)
===Original end-of-credits logo===

The company&#x27;s end-of-credits logo and mascot is an intentionally poorly animated vampire monster cartoon figure crossing the screen from right to left and saying, &quot;Grr. Argh.&quot; It was drawn and voiced by Whedon himself. In certain episodes of &quot;Buffy&quot; the animation was changed:
* &quot;Becoming, Part Two&quot;: He says &quot;Oooh, I need a hug&quot; instead.
* &quot;Amends&quot;: He wears a Santa hat.
* &quot;Graduation Day, Part Two&quot;: He wears a graduation cap—the image used is a reversed logo from the U.S. national college honor society Mortar Board.
* &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;: He sings the line in falsetto.
* &quot;Storyteller&quot;: The monster (overdubbed by cast member Adam Busch) sings a line from the episode, &quot;We are as Gods&quot;.
* &quot;Chosen&quot;: He turns and pulls a face at the viewer.

The episode &quot;Bargaining, Part One&quot; references the end-of-credits logo. Tara gives Giles a small rubber monster and says &quot;And a monster. Sort of a Sunnydale souvenir, we thought. Grr. Argh.&quot; In season seven of &quot;Buffy&quot;, there is a species of ancient Vampires called &quot;Turok-Han&quot; or Ubervamps. They look like more detailed versions of the Mutant Enemy.

In the canonical &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 8&quot; comic books, issue 22 &quot;Swell&quot;, on page 10, the slogan for an in-comic fictional product is &quot;Vampy Cat! Grr! Argh! He&#x27;ll love you to &lt;obscured&gt; the Santorio Corporation!&quot;

====Parodies====
At the end of the credits of the animated sketch comedy parody show &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, a parody of the Mutant Enemy, Inc. logo appeared with Joss Whedon (guest starring as himself) providing the &quot;Grr... Argh...&quot; As the enemy mutant rips apart the city, the scene cuts to an office where Joss Whedon is playing with dolls and an executive says to him, &quot;Come on Joss, that&#x27;s why you got kicked off &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.&quot;

===New end-of-credits logo===
With &quot;The Nevers&quot;, the Mutant Enemy vampire end-credits logo was replaced. The new end-of-credits card features a typewriter, upon which the company&#x27;s name is affixed as an embossed label maker label.

<text>TRIUMF is Canada&#x27;s national particle accelerator centre. It is considered Canada&#x27;s premier physics laboratory, and consistently regarded as one of the world&#x27;s leading subatomic physics research centres. Owned and operated by a consortium of universities, it is on the south campus of one of its founding members, the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It houses the world&#x27;s largest normal conducting cyclotron, a source of 520 MeV protons, which was named an IEEE Milestone in 2010. Its accelerator-focused activities involve particle physics, nuclear physics, nuclear medicine, materials science, and detector and accelerator development.

Over 500 scientists, engineers, technicians, tradespeople, administrative staff, postdoctoral fellows, and students work at the site. It attracts over 1000 national and international researchers every year, and has generated over $1 billion in economic activity over the last decade.

To develop TRIUMF&#x27;s research priorities, physicists based at the facility and the university follow the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council&#x27;s (NSERC) long-range plan for subatomic physics. TRIUMF also has over 50 international agreements for collaborative research.

Asteroid 14959 TRIUMF is named in honour of the laboratory.

==History==

TRIUMF was founded in 1968 by Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia, and the University of Victoria to meet research needs that no single university could provide. The name TRIUMF was originally an acronym based on TRI University Meson Facility, but no longer reflects its current state as a consortium of 19 member and associate universities across Canada.
Since its inception as a local university facility, it has evolved into a national laboratory while maintaining strong ties to Canadian universities&#x27; research programs. Its related fields of study have expanded from nuclear physics to include particle physics, molecular and materials science, nuclear medicine, and accelerator research and development.

TRIUMF&#x27;s 520 MeV cyclotron was officially commissioned on February 9, 1976 by Pierre Trudeau, the 15th Prime Minister of Canada, who said, &quot;I don&#x27;t really know what a cyclotron is, but I am certainly very happy Canada has one.&quot;

Before the Riken SRC (superconducting ring cyclotron) was built, TRIUMF was the world&#x27;s largest cyclotron in terms of weight and beam or magnetic field radius. The Riken SRC is now heavier than the TRIUMF cyclotron, but TRIUMF has the largest beam radius and largest vacuum tank. Riken&#x27;s magnetic field covers from 3.5 m to 5.5 m radius with maximum beam radius of about , while TRIUMF&#x27;s field goes from 0 to about 320 inches radius with maximum beam radius of 310 inches, as it requires a lower magnetic field to reduce EM stripping.

===Laboratory directors===
TRIUMF has had nine directors of its operations:
* John Warren – 1968–1971
* John Reginald Richardson – 1971–1976
* Jack Sample – 1976–1981
* Erich Vogt – 1981–1994
* Alan Astbury – 1994–2001
* Alan Shotter – 2001–2007

==Canadian university partners==
TRIUMF is owned and operated as a joint venture by a consortium of 21 universities, including 14 full and 7 associate members. The member universities consist of the University of Alberta, the University of British Columbia, Carleton University, University of Guelph, University of Manitoba, Université de Montréal, Simon Fraser University, Queen&#x27;s University, University of Toronto, University of Victoria, University of Waterloo, and York University. The associate universities consist of the University of Calgary, McMaster University, University of Northern British Columbia, University of Regina, McGill University, Saint Mary&#x27;s University, Université de Sherbrooke, the University of Winnipeg, and Western University.

==Organizational structure==
TRIUMF is organized into four divisions that focus on varying aspects of research and operations:

* The Accelerator Division, responsible for the operation, maintenance, and upgrades required for all of the 520 MeV Cyclotron, ISAC, and TR-13 facilities. It is also responsible for the design, construction and commissioning of future on-site accelerators, and provides support for external accelerator projects.
* The Engineering Division, responsible for the engineering, design and fabrication of mechanical, structural and electronic components, and for electrical and mechanical services and site maintenance.
* The Physical Sciences Division, responsible for scheduling experiments approved by the Experimental Evaluation Committee (EEC), and for the design, installation, operation and maintenance of components, systems and subsystems for all experimental operations at the site. It is also responsible for the coordination of infrastructure support for external programs.
* The Life Sciences Division, responsible for the support of projects approved by the Life Science Projects Evaluation Committee (LSPEC), and provides support for collaborations with the Pacific Parkinson&#x27;s Research Centre (PPRC), BC Cancer (BCC), BWXT and other university faculties relying on radio-tracers from TRIUMF for their research. It is also responsible for the design, installation, operation and maintenance of components, systems and subsystems for the radioisotope production and processing facilities for tracers to be used in research projects both at TRIUMF and other laboratories. TRIUMF&#x27;s nuclear medicine department is part of this division.

The Office of the Director, supported by the Deputy Directors of Research and Operations, has general oversight for:

* The facility&#x27;s administrative departments, including accounting and finance, environmental health and safety, general administration and security, human resources, procurement, quality assurance, strategic planning, communications and outreach, and supply chain management
* The Applied Technology Group, consisting of several work teams including Isotope production, cyclotron operations, and technical support, which focuses on the production of radioactive isotopes for use by the medical isotope division of BWX Technologies (formerly Nordion), which are ultimately deployed in the development of drugs and diagnosis and treatment of disease.

Additionally, TRIUMF Innovations (link to website) is TRIUMF&#x27;s commercialization arm, linking its laboratories activities with tangible business and commercialization opportunities. Established in 2017, it replaced Advanced Applied Physics Solutions, Inc. (AAPS), TRIUMF&#x27;s previous commercialization entity.

==Experiments==
As TRIUMF has selectively applied its expertise to other areas of research, and to the generation of entrepreneurial opportunities, its core program of nuclear, particle and accelerator physics has expanded to cover key areas in life, molecular and materials sciences.

===Main cyclotron and proton beam lines===
At the heart of TRIUMF is the 520 MeV cyclotron that produces the primary proton beams. A large fraction of the TRIUMF program relies on these beams, including the ISAC, the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science programs in μSR and β-NMR, and the Proton Treatment Facility. The operation of the main cyclotron has enabled TRIUMF to acquire the expertise to operate the three medical cyclotrons for BWXT Medical and the TR-13 medical cyclotron used to produce medical isotopes, and assist companies to exploit commercial opportunities for the sale of cyclotron and other accelerator technologies.

====The 520 MeV cyclotron====
TRIUMF produces negatively charged hydrogen ions (H−: 1 proton, 2 electrons) from an ion source. The ions are transported through an evacuated electrostatic beam line containing elements to focus and steer the beam over 60m to the cyclotron. The 520 MeV (million electron volts) variable energy cyclotron accelerates these ions with a high frequency alternating electric field and uses a massive six-sector magnet to confine the beam in an outward spiral trajectory. Inserting a very thin graphite extraction foil strips, or removes, the electrons from the H− ion while allowing the proton to pass through. The proton, because it is a positively charged particle, is deflected in the outward direction due to the magnetic field and is directed to a proton beam line.

The accelerating process takes approximately 0.3 ms before the proton achieves three-quarters the speed of light. The success of TRIUMF&#x27;s programs depends on the ability to deliver protons from the cyclotron reliably. Typically, the cyclotron, although over 35 years old, averages an up-time of greater than 90% (2000–2007), with the 15-year average just under 90%. Typically the beam is delivered for about 5,000 hours per year with one major (three month) and one minor (one month) maintenance periods. The cyclotron beam properties and capabilities have improved over the years as a result of systems upgrades and the fundamental infrastructure providing the magnetic and electrical fields and the RF resonators as well as the vacuum vessel will serve TRIUMF for many more years.

====The Four Proton Beamlines====
TRIUMF has four independent extraction probes with various sizes of foils to provide protons simultaneously to up to four beam lines. Because of the high energy of the proton beam, these beamlines use magnetic rather than electrostatic focusing and steering elements.

;Beamline 1A (BL1A) : can deliver 180 to 500 MeV protons to two target systems. The beam power ranges from 50 to 75 kW. The first target, T1, services three experimental channels. The second target, T2, services two μSR experimental channels. Downstream of T2 is a 500 MeV facility used to produce strontium isotopes for medical-imaging generators as well as the Thermal Neutron Facility (TNF).

;Beamline 1B : separates off BL1 at the edge of the cyclotron vault and provides international users with the Proton Irradiation Facility (PIF) that is used for radiation testing of electronic circuits, for example, mimicking space radiation for testing computer chips.

;Beamline 1U (BL1U) : shares the proton beam with beamline 1A and is designed to divert up to 20 kW of its beam power onto a spallation source for ultracold neutrons, which can be used to study fundamental properties of the neutron.

;Beamline 2A (BL2A) : capable of providing 475 to 500 MeV proton beams at up to 50 kW to the ISAC target facility that produces rare-isotope ion beams for a host of Canadian and international experiments.

;Beamline 2C (BL2C) : used for the Proton Therapy Program to treat choroidal melanomas (eye tumours) and proton irradiation to produce strontium isotopes, which are chemically processed and then used for medical imaging generators. This beam line also has the flexibility to provide protons of lower energy for PIF users. The energy range for this line is 70 to 120 MeV.

;Beamline 4 North (BL4N) : (expected completion 2017), will be a new 500 MeV beamline used for the proposed expansion of ISAC with a specialized actinide target.

===ISAC and ARIEL facilities for rare-isotope beams===
The ISAC and ARIEL (under construction) facilities produces and uses heavy ion beams to produce short-lived isotopes for study. Proton beam from the main accelerator is used as a driver beam at ISAC via beamline BL2A and one of the two ARIEL target stations via beamline BL4N (under construction) to produce beams of exotic isotopes which are further accelerated using linear accelerators. The second target station at ARIEL uses an electron beam from the TRIUMF elinac as a driver beam. Several experiments study the properties and structure of these exotic isotopes along with their nucleosynthesis. Between ISAC-I and ISAC-II, many experiments can be completed.

====ISAC-I facility====
In the ISAC-I facility, 500 MeV protons at up to 100 μA can be steered onto one of two production targets to produce radioactive isotopes. The isotopes pass through a heated tube to a source where they are ionized, accelerated off the source&#x27;s high-voltage platform at up to 60 kV and sent through a mass separator to select the ion beam of choice. The beam is transported in the low-energy beam transport (LEBT) electrostatic beam line and sent via a switch-yard to either the low-energy experimental area or to a series of room-temperature accelerating structures to the ISAC-I medium-energy experimental area. Experiments at ISAC-I include:

=====8π spectrometer=====
A microscope used to examine the behaviour of atomic nuclear produced, which are collected at the centre of 8pi where they undergo radioactive decay. The main component of the 8π spectrometer are the Hyper-pure Germanium detectors used to observe gamma rays emitted from excited states of daughter nuclei.

=====DRAGON=====
The Detector of Recoils And Gammas Of Nuclear Reactions (DRAGON) is an apparatus designed to measure the rates of nuclear reactions important in astrophysics, particularly nucleosynthesis reactions which occur in the explosives environments of nova, supernova, and x-ray bursters.

=====Laser spectroscopy=====
The Collinear Fast-Beam Laser Spectroscopy (CFBS) experiment at TRIUMF is designed to exploit the high beam-intensity and radioisotope-production capability of TRIUMF&#x27;s ISAC facility, as well as modern ion-trap beam-cooling techniques, in order to measure the hyperfine energy levels and isotope shifts of short-lived isotopes using laser spectroscopy.

=====TITAN=====
TRIUMF&#x27;s Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear Science (TITAN) measures the mass of short-lived isotopes with high precision. Radioactive isotopes from ISAC are sent to TITAN to undergo cooling, charge-breeding and trapping. The entire process occurs in about 10 milliseconds, allowing radioactive isotopes with short half lives to be studied.

=====TRINAT=====
TRINAT, TRIUMF&#x27;s Neutral Atom Trap, holds a cluster of neutral atoms suspended in a very small space, in high vacuum, allowing for the study of decay products of radioactive atoms.

====ISAC-II facility====

The rare-isotope beams produced in the ISAC-II facility are transported in the low-energy beam transport (LEBT) electrostatic beam line and sent via a switch-yard to either the low-energy experimental area or to a series of room-temperature accelerating structures in the ISAC-I medium-energy experimental area. For high-energy delivery, the drift tube linac (DTL) beam is deflected north along an S-bend transfer line to the ISAC-II superconducting linear accelerator (SC-linac) for acceleration above the Coulomb barrier (5–11 MeV/u). TRIUMF began developing superconducting accelerator technology in 2001 and is now a leader in the field with a demonstrated accelerating gradient (at low beta) significantly above other operating facilities. Experiments at ISAC-II include:

=====EMMA=====
The ElectroMagnetic Mass Analyzer (EMMA) (completion date 2016) is a recoil mass spectrometer for TRIUMF&#x27;s ISAC-II facility. ISAC-II will provide intense beams of radioactive ions with masses up to 150 atomic mass units to international scientists studying nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics. The energies of these beams will depend on the specific nuclei being accelerated, but typical top speeds will range from 10–20% of the speed of light.

=====HERACLES=====
Formerly known as the Chalk River/Laval array, HERACLES consists of 150 scintillators detectors covering almost 4-pi. It was used in over a dozen of experiments in the last ten years for multi-fragmentation studies at intermediate energies (10 to 100 MeV/A).

=====TIGRESS=====
The TRIUMF-ISAC Gamma-Ray Escape Suppressed Spectrometer (TIGRESS) is a state-of-the art new gamma-ray spectrometer designed for a broad program of nuclear physics research with the accelerated radioactive ion beams provided by the ISAC-II superconducting linear accelerator.

====ISAC-I/II====
The experiments listed below utilize both facilities.

=====TUDA=====
A general purpose facility for studying nuclear reactions of astrophysical significance with solid state detectors.

=====TACTIC=====
An ionization chamber with full track reconstruction capabilities for studying reactions of astrophysical importance.

=====DSL=====
TRIUMF&#x27;s Doppler Shift Lifetimes facility, which is an experimental setup for the measurement of the lifetimes of excited states of nuclei.

===ATLAS Canadian Tier-1 Data Centre===
The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN uses proton-proton collisions at the highest energy ever achieved in the laboratory to look for the Higgs Boson, the particle central to the current model of how subatomic particles attain mass. ATLAS will also search for phenomena &quot;beyond the standard model&quot; of particle physics such as supersymmetry, extra dimensions, and quark compositeness. The ATLAS detector will observe the particles emerging from the roughly 900 million proton-proton collisions per second and, although fast electronics will filter the events so that only those most likely to be of interest will be recorded, ATLAS will produce 3.5–5.0 petabytes of data per year (one petabyte is one million gigabytes). In addition, secondary data sets will be produced that could double the amount of data produced.

In order to analyze this enormous amount of information, CERN is coordinating an international network of large high-performance computing centres that are linked by grid computing tools so that they act as one huge system. This network is called the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG). The Canadian Tier-1 Data Centre, located at TRIUMF, works with nine of the other ATLAS Tier-1 centres in the world to process the raw data produced by the experiment. In addition, Tier-2 centres located in universities, both in Canada and abroad, are used to further process the results of the Tier-1 analysis and extract groundbreaking physics results from the data. The Tier-2 centres will also be the primary sites for computer simulations of ATLAS, which is an integral part of the data analysis.

===Centre for Molecular and Materials Science===
TRIUMF uses subatomic particles as probes of materials structure at the Centre for Molecular and Materials Science (CMMS). The chief techniques are μSR and β-NMR.

====μSR====
TRIUMF utilizes a technique called μSR, a powerful probe into materials like semiconductors, magnets and superconductors. Beams of positive muons are created with their spins lined up in the same direction. When these beams are shot into a material, the muons&#x27; spins precess (wobble like a top) around the local magnetic fields in the material. The unstable muons soon decay into positrons; since these antielectrons tend to be emitted in the direction of the muons&#x27; spin, μSR scientists can examine how the internal magnetic fields of different materials have affected the muons&#x27; spins by observing the directions in which the positrons are emitted.

====β-NMR====
β detected NMR is an exotic form of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) in which the nuclear spin precession signal is detected through the beta decay of a radioactive nucleus. The central question to be studied is how the local electronic and magnetic properties near an interface or surface of new materials (e.g.. a high Tc superconductor) differ from those of the bulk.

===Detector development===
TRIUMF uses its expertise gained from the development of detectors for particle and nuclear physics, in collaboration with Canadian universities, to support advanced detector development, including for molecular and materials sciences and nuclear medicine. TRIUMF&#x27;s Science and Technology Department designs and constructs complete detector systems including mechanics, services, front end electronics, digital signal processing and data acquisition.

===Nuclear medicine laboratories===
The core of the TRIUMF nuclear medicine program is Positron Emission Tomography or PET imaging, a technique whereby tiny amounts of radioactive nuclei known as radioisotopes are combined with certain bio-molecules and injected into the body. The biomolecules can be &quot;traced&quot; by imaging the decay products (two photons produced by the decay of the radioactive nucleus via the emission of a positron) outside the body. PET allows the concentration of positron-labeled compounds to be determined quantitatively in space and time within the living body. PET is more sensitive than any other human imaging method, such as MRI or CT, especially for the detection of cancer.

The PET program facilities at TRIUMF include cyclotron systems for the production of radioisotopes, chemistry labs for the synthesis of radiopharmaceuticals and quality control labs. TRIUMF currently uses the TR-13 medical cyclotron and target systems for the production of 18F, 11C, and 13N. Radiopharmaceutical production facilities include the small modular clean room at the cyclotron for the synthesis of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). for BCCA as well as three chemistry annex labs for production and development of radiopharmaceuticals used in brain research and other programs at UBC.

Pacific Parkinson&#x27;s Research Centre (PPRC) is a joint TRIUMF/UBC program studying central nervous system disorders. Approximately 80% of the studies are related to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and the remainder are related to mood disorders and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The program has explored the origins, progression, and therapies of the disease as well as the complications arising from therapy using molecular imaging as the primary tool.

The Functional Imaging Program at the BCCA is a collaboration among the agency, TRIUMF, UBC, and the BC Children&#x27;s Hospital. Capital acquired through the BC Provincial Health Services Authority Emerging Technologies Fund allowed purchase of the province&#x27;s first hybrid PET/CT scanner in 2004. The clinical PET/CT program, located at BCCA&#x27;s Vancouver Centre, was enabled by TRIUMF supplying 18F, the positron emitting radionuclide used in production of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). FDG, as a marker of glucose metabolism, is the tracer used in oncologic PET imaging, a diagnostic study which has become a standard of care in the management of many cancer types.

===Proton and neutron irradiation facilities===
Beginning in 1995, TRIUMF has built up several beamlines that provide low-intensity, energetic proton and neutron beams to simulate radiation exposures either in space or terrestrial environments. Even at low intensity, several minutes of exposure in these beams can correspond to years of operation in space, air, or ground so that accelerated testing of electronics can be carried out.

These TRIUMF facilities, PIF &amp; NIF, have since become recognized as premier test sites for space-radiation effects using protons and, with the capability of using these protons to produce a neutron-energy spectrum similar to that found at aircraft altitudes and at ground level, testing with neutrons is also possible. A large fraction of the proton users are Canadian space-related companies such as MDA Corporation, while neutron use is primarily by international companies for avionics, microelectronics and communications equipment, such as The Boeing Company or Cisco Systems, Inc.

Additionally, one of the beamlines was used for the cancer treatment of ocular melanoma at the Proton Therapy Centre which was operated in conjunction with the BC Cancer Agency and the UBC Department of Ophthalmology. Before proton treatment became available, the most common course of action was removal of the eye. Other possible treatments included surgical removal of the tumour (which has severe limitations), or implanting a radioactive disk on the wall of the eye under the tumour for some days. These alternatives were unsuitable for large tumours, and could damage sensitive parts of the eye, often resulting in loss of vision. After proton therapy, however, patients can retain useful vision. The protons enter the eye at a carefully controlled energy, and come to rest at a precise, predictable distance inside. They deposit their energy of motion (kinetic energy) in a very narrow layer, destroying living cells in that layer. Because the beam of protons is so concentrated and deposits its energy so predictably, we can successfully destroy a tumour while better preserving the other nearby parts of the eye. The proton therapy program at TRIUMF was discontinued in 2019.

==External scientific collaborations==
TRIUMF is also involved in the development and construction of detectors and equipment for larger particle physics experiments located all over the world.

===ALPHA===
The international ALPHA Collaboration, focused on trapping antihydrogen with experiments based at CERN, includes members from TRIUMF.
The ALPHA-Canada team, led by TRIUMF research scientist Dr. Makoto C. Fujiwara, was recognized with the 2013 NSERC John C. Polanyi Award for their work with the ALPHA team at CERN in understanding antimatter. The Canadian team included over a dozen scientists and students working in plasma, atomic, condensed matter, particle, detector, and accelerator physics, from the University of British Columbia (UBC), Simon Fraser University (SFU), the University of Calgary, York University, and TRIUMF.

===KEK===
TRIUMF has a longstanding collaborative relationship with Japan&#x27;s KEK, which was further enhanced in December, 2015 when it was announced that each organization would be establishing branch offices at the other&#x27;s respective institution to facilitate the advancement of their physics research activities.

===Large Hadron Collider===
TRIUMF accelerator physicists, engineers, and technical personnel have unique expertise for the design and construction of critical parts of the accelerator, such as assembling the liquid argon end cap calorimeters for the ATLAS detector. As well, TRIUMF was involved in the construction and procurement of several magnets and power supplies for the LHC itself. The resulting accelerator contributions were a necessary part of the Canadian investment in the project. TRIUMF is also home to the ATLAS-Canada Tier-1 Data Centre, funded by the Canada Foundation for Innovation. This centre will pre-process the raw data from the experiment prior to analysis by Canadian and foreign researchers. It will also provide domestic detector experts access to raw data for detailed calibration and monitoring.

===SNO===
TRIUMF first became actively involved in the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) when the project needed engineering help. TRIUMF&#x27;s Design Office and Machine Shop built key components of the detector. Moreover, TRIUMF scientists were involved in the project which was honored with the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics and the 2016 Fundamental Physics Prize for the discovery of neutrino oscillation.

===SNOLAB===
TRIUMF is involved with a number of projects at SNOLAB. Notable examples include the Helium and Lead Observatory (HALO) supernova neutrino detector which is part of the SuperNova Early Warning System (SNEWS) and Dark Matter Experiment using Argon Pulse-shape discrimination (DEAP) the most sensitive weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) detector to date.

===T2K===
TRIUMF is part of the T2K (Tokai-to-Kamioka) neutrino oscillation experiment in Japan. TRIUMF is involved in constructing a time projection chamber and fine-grained detectors composed of plastic scintillators for the T2K &quot;near detector&quot;, to measure the properties of the neutrino beam at its production site in Tokai before it travels 295 km to Kamioka, over which distance neutrino oscillations are expected to take place.

==TRIUMF Users&#x27; Group==
The TRIUMF Users Group (TUG) is an international community of scientists and engineers with a special interest in the use of the TRIUMF facility. Its purpose is:
* to provide a formal means for exchange of information relating to the development and use of the facility;
* to advise members of the entire TRIUMF organization of projects and facilities available;
* to provide an entity responsive to the representations of its members for offering advice and counsel to the TRIUMF management on operating policy and facilities.
Any qualified scientist can join the users group. The group&#x27;s interests are looked after by an elected committee (TRIUMF Users&#x27; Executive Committee or TUEC). Part of TUEC&#x27;s responsibilities is to organize meetings on behalf of the membership were necessary. At least one meeting, the annual general meeting (AGM), is held each year near the beginning of December. A link to the TUG website is listed in the external links below.

<doc id="683375" wikidata="Q621054" url="?curid=683375" title="Spinneret">
<text>A spinneret is a silk-spinning organ of a spider or the larva of an insect. Some adult insects also have spinnerets, such as those borne on the forelegs of Embioptera. Spinnerets are usually on the underside of a spider&#x27;s opisthosoma, and are typically segmented. While most spiders have six spinnerets, some have two, four, or eight. They can move both independently and in concert.

Most spinnerets are not simple structures with a single orifice producing a single thread, but complex structures of many microscopic spigots, each producing one filament. This produces the necessary orientation of the protein molecules, without which the silk would be weak and useless. Spigots can be singular or found in groups, which also permits spiders to combine multiple filaments in different ways to produce many kinds of silk for various purposes. Spinneret morphology can help arachnologists identify the taxon of a specimen and the specific morphology of a spigot can determine its use as well. For example, flagelliform spigot is unique to Araneoidea, and another kind of spigot found in sets of three, referred to as cylindrical gland spots, are found only in females and used for making egg sacs. The desert grass spider, &quot;Agelenopsis aperta,&quot; has especially prominent spinnerets that extend out of the end of their abdomen.

Various species of spiders use silk extruded from spinnerets to build webs, to transfer sperm, to entrap insects by wrapping it around them, to make egg-cases, to manipulate static electricity in the air, and to fly (ballooning), etc.

Some insect larvae (including silkworms) extrude silk to make a protective cocoon for their metamorphosis. The insects known as web spinners weave silken galleries for protection from predators and the elements while foraging and breeding.

==Evolution==
Observations suggesting that there might be silk-producing organs on the feet of the zebra tarantula (&quot;Aphonopelma seemanni&quot;) led to questions about the origins of spinnerets. It was hypothesised that spinnerets in spiders were originally used as climbing aids on the feet and evolved and were used for webmaking at a later time.

<doc id="683380" wikidata="Q1293937" url="?curid=683380" title="List of rulers of Auvergne">
<text>This is a list of the various rulers of Auvergne.

==History==
In the 7th century Auvergne was disputed between the Franks and Aquitanians. It was later conquered by the Carolingians, and was integrated for a time into the kingdom of Aquitaine. The counts of Auvergne slowly became autonomous.

In the 10th century Auvergne became a disputed territory between the count of Poitiers and the counts of Toulouse.

In the Middle Ages Auvergne was broken into four feudal domains:

* the county of Auvergne (created around 980)
* the bishopric of Clermont or ecclesiastical county of Clermont (created around 980 as a sort of counter-power)
* the dauphinate of Auvergne or the worldly county of Clermont (formed around 1155 after a coup but not formally created until 1302)
* the duchy of Auvergne or the land of Auvergne (formed from the royal domain of Auvergne in 1360)

Auvergne was integrated in turn into the appanages of Alphonse, count of Poitou and Toulouse (1241–1271) and of John, duke of Berry and Auvergne and count of Poitiers and Montpensier (1360–1416).

During the Hundred Years&#x27; War Auvergne faced numerous raids and revolts, including the Tuchin Revolt.

In 1424 the Duchy of Auvergne passed to the House of Bourbon.

Quite contemporaneously, the County of Auvergne passed to the House of La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, and upon its extinction in 1531 it passed to Catherine de&#x27; Medici before becoming a royal domain.

In 1434, the Dauphinate of Auvergne passed to the House of Bourbon-Montpensier.

After the death of Acfred, who left the comital fisc completely diminished, there appeared no successor who could control the entire Auvergne, with Velay. Several relatives of surrounding regions made claims. Below are the dates of their effective control.

*Ebalus Manzer (927–934), great-grandson of Gerard
*Raymond Pons, Count of Toulouse (934–942)
* Raymond, Count of Toulouse (942–961)
*William (IV) (961–963), son of Ebalus Manzer, also Duke of Aquitaine.

==Hereditary Counts of Auvergne and the Dauphinate (963-1653/1693)==

===House of Auvergne===

From the viscounty of Clermont, then vassal to the elective county of Auvergne, came the so-called House of Auvergne, a designation used by modern historians for the family that ruled consistently the Auvergne region from 963. After a period of comital vacancy, the viscounts of Clermont were elevated as successors of the elective counts: the county became hereditary.

====Viscounts of Clermont====
*Armand of Clermont (?–?)
*Robert I of Clermont (?–?)
*Robert II of Clermont (?–?)
*Robert III of Clermont (?–?), son of Robert II

====The splitting of the county and the Dauphinate====

In 1155, count William VII &quot;the Young&quot; was usurped by his uncle, count William VIII &quot;the Old&quot;. However, William VIII left a smaller portion for his nephew to rule. In 1209, the county of William VIII &quot;the Old&quot; would be made smaller after a partial confiscation by Philip II of France, later to be made in 1360 as the Duchy of Auvergne.

As for William VII &quot;the Young&quot;, he was able to maintain his status in part of his county, especially Beaumont, Chamalières, and Montferrand. From this smaller county raised, in 1302, the &quot;Dauphinate of Auvergne&quot;. 

Based in the fact that William VII&#x27;s wife was the daughter of the dauphin de Viennois, Guigues IV, and that William VII&#x27;s descendants, in virtue of the Viennois blood, used the surname &quot; Dauphin&quot;, the majority of authors anticipate the formalization of the dauphinate in 1302 and choose to call William VII and his successors already as &quot;dauphins of Auvergne&quot;, for a clear distinction from the descendants of William VIII. Still others, out of convenience, choose to call these successors the counts-dauphins of Auvergne.

<text>Ellen Dorrit Hoffleit (March 12, 1907 – April 9, 2007) was an American senior research astronomer at Yale University. She is best known for her work in variable stars, astrometry, spectroscopy, meteors, and the Bright Star Catalog. She is also known for her mentorship of many young women and generations of astronomers.

==Life==

Hoffleit&#x27;s interest in astronomy began with the 1919 Perseid meteor shower that she saw with her mother. In 1928, she graduated cum laude with a B.A. in mathematics. She then went on to work for the Harvard College Observatory, searching for variable stars. In 1938, she was awarded a Ph.D. in astronomy from Radcliffe College and was subsequently hired, in 1948, as an astronomer at Harvard University. She remained at Harvard until 1956 when she moved to Yale University. She remained at Yale until retirement in 1975.

At Yale she followed in the footsteps of Ida Barney, taking over her astrometric work, and of whom she later wrote &quot;To know [her] was a pleasure, inspiration, and privilege, both at work and socially.&quot; Hoffleit also served as director of the Maria Mitchell Observatory on Nantucket Island from 1957 to 1978, where she ran summer programs (May–October) for more than 100 students, many of whom went on to successful careers in astronomy. In her final years at Yale, Hoffleit taught basic courses in astronomy to undergraduates. Her passionate lectures in Davies Hall, usually with over 100 students, inspired and awed them. She engendered a lifelong interest in astronomy for young women and men, many of whom were just satisfying a prerequisite to their undergraduate degrees.

During the mid 1950s, Hoffleit consulted for the U.S. Army&#x27;s Ballistic Research Laboratories in &quot;Doppler reductions&quot;.

She was the main editor of the Yale &quot;Bright Star Catalogue.&quot; The Catalogue is a compendium of information on the 9,110 brightest stars in the sky. She also co-authored &quot;The General Catalogue of Trigonometric Stellar Parallaxes&quot;, containing precise distance measurements to 8,112 stars, information critical to understanding the kinematics of the Milky Way galaxy and the evolution of the solar neighborhood. With Harlan J. Smith, Hoffleit discovered the optical variability of the first-discovered quasar 3C 273.

In 1988, Hoffleit was awarded the George Van Biesbroeck Prize by the American Astronomical Society for a lifetime of service to astronomy. On March 7-8, 1997, Yale University hosted a symposium in honor of Hoffleit&#x27;s 90th birthday, dedicated to her nearly 70-year career.

Hoffleit turned 100 on March 12, 2007, and died a month later from complications of cancer.

<text>David Mallett (April 21, 1951 – December 17, 2024) was an American singer-songwriter best known for his authorship of the &quot;folk standard&quot; composition &quot;Garden Song&quot;. He recorded for independent record labels for most of his career.

== Biography ==
A resident of Maine for most of his life, in the 1980s Mallett relocated to Nashville, and released two albums with the folk and blues label Vanguard. He later moved back to Maine and established his own label, North Road Records.

Mallett&#x27;s songs have been recorded by more than 150 artists, including Pete Seeger; Alison Krauss; John Denver; Arlo Guthrie; Emmylou Harris, Peter, Paul &amp; Mary; Bok; Trickett, Muir; and Makem and Clancy. &quot;Garden Song&quot; was recorded by the Muppets.

=== &quot;Garden Song&quot; ===

Mallett wrote &quot;Garden Song&quot; when he was in his early twenties. He had been listening to the radio when he went to help his father plant the garden at his homestead in Sebec, Maine. With &quot;music in his head and work at his hands,&quot; the first verse came while planting:

::Inch by inch, row by row
::Gonna make this garden grow
::All it takes is a rake and hoe
::And a piece of fertile ground

Mallett walked around the yard humming it. The next day, he wrote the second verse at a friend’s house. Being only the third or fourth song he&#x27;d written, Mallett regarded &quot;Garden Song&quot; as a gift, one that altered the course of his life. It was recorded by John Denver; Pete Seeger; Peter, Paul and Mary; and other acts. The song is likely why the University of Maine gave Mallett an honorary degree in 2014.

=== Performance ===
Mallett frequently performed with violinist Susan Ramsey and bassist Michael Burd, with sound by Tom Gordon. He recorded 17 albums, including &quot;The Fable True&quot; in 2007, based on Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s last expedition in 1857 and &quot;Alright Now&quot; a collection of songs including &quot;Beautiful&quot;, dedicated to his daughter Molly.

He performed in town halls and folk clubs across America and Europe in addition to major venues such as Barns of Wolf Trap, the Newport Folk Festival, and &quot;Prairie Home Companion&quot;. The &quot;Bangor Daily News&quot; recognized him as one of the 58 most memorable Mainers of the 20th Century. The readers of &quot;Folkwax&quot; voted him &quot;2003 Artist of the Year&quot; and his album &quot;Artist in Me&quot; as &quot;2003 Album of the Year&quot;.

=== Death ===
Mallett died from cancer on December 17, 2024, at the age of 73.

==Legacy==
His sons, Will and Luke, perform as The Mallett Brothers Band. The Mallett Brothers Band released the album, &quot;Live in Portland, Maine&quot;, in March 2019.

Mallett inspired many other Maine musicians and artists. Singer-songwriter Anni Clark said &quot;He paved the way for many of us here in this little state of Maine. He gave us hope and told us that we could make a difference if we wrote and shared our words in music,” and that he encouraged people “to slow down … to see, hear, taste, embrace &amp; share the simple &amp; good things in life.”

==Discography==
David Mallett released 17 albums:&lt;br&gt;


1986: &quot;Vital Signs&quot;
1988: &quot;For a Lifetime&quot;
1993: &quot;This Town&quot;
1999: &quot;Ambition&quot;
2003: &quot;Artist in Me&quot;

<text>Henry Robert Merrill Levan (May 17, 1921 – February 17, 1998) was an American songwriter, theatrical composer, lyricist, and screenwriter. Merrill was one of the most successful songwriters of the 1950s on the US and UK single charts. His musicals for the Broadway stage include &quot;Carnival!&quot; (music and lyrics) and &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (lyrics).

Merrill played an important role in American popular music, tapping out many of the hit parade songs of the 1950s on a toy xylophone, including &quot;(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window?&quot;, &quot;Mambo Italiano&quot;, and &quot;If I Knew You Were Comin&#x27; I&#x27;d&#x27;ve Baked a Cake&quot;.

Merrill was inducted to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1987. Other career accolades include five Tony Award nominations, as well as the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for his work on &quot;Carnival!&quot; in 1961. 

==Early life==
Merrill was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and raised in Philadelphia over his family&#x27;s candy factory and soda fountain. As a teenager, he wanted to be a singer and performed in all local talent contests and even worked as an impressionist-emcee at a local burlesque house. His plans for a career in show business were cut short by the advent of World War II, when he was drafted into the Horse Cavalry Division of the Army. 

==Career==
After the war, Merrill moved to Hollywood, where he worked as a dialogue director for Columbia Pictures, and while on location for a film, he was asked to write some songs for the film actress Dorothy Shay, who was recording an album at the time. Shay&#x27;s album &quot;Park Avenue Hillbilly&quot; became a hit, which launched Merrill&#x27;s career. Soon he was invited to collaborate with Al Hoffman and Clem Watts to write some songs. They came up with a novelty song &quot;If I Knew You Were Comin&#x27; I&#x27;d&#x27;ve Baked a Cake&quot;, recorded in 1948 by Eileen Barton. He also co-wrote the Moon Mullican song &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Be a Baby to Cry&quot;.

Guy Mitchell recorded many of Merrill&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Sparrow in the Treetop&quot;, &quot;She Wears Red Feathers&quot;, and &quot;My Truly, Truly Fair&quot;.

Merrill made his Broadway debut in 1957 with &quot;New Girl in Town&quot;, a musical adaptation of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Anna Christie&quot;. The show was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Musical. &quot;Take Me Along&quot; followed in 1959, with music and lyrics by Merrill, starring Jackie Gleason and Walter Pidgeon. The musical was nominated for the 1960 Tony Award for Best Musical. In 1961, the film &quot;Lili&quot; was made into the Broadway musical &quot;Carnival!&quot;, starring Anna Maria Alberghetti, with words and music by Merrill. The show was nominated for the 1962 Tony Award for Best Musical.

He had theatrical success with the 1964 musical &quot;Funny Girl&quot; starring Barbra Streisand, which introduced the standards &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Rain on My Parade&quot;. Merrill and songwriting partner Jule Styne were nominated for the 1964 Tony Award for Best Original Score. When the stage show was adapted as a 1968 film, he and Styne were asked to write a title tune, which was nominated for both the Academy Award for Best Original Song and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song.

Producer David Merrick hired Merrill to write additional songs for the musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; by Jerry Herman. Merrill contributed the songs &quot;Motherhood March&quot; and &quot;Elegance&quot;, as well as additional lyrics to Herman&#x27;s &quot;It Takes a Woman&quot;. Merrill did not accept billing or credit for his additions to the score. 

Merrill&#x27;s other Broadway credits include &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1966), &quot;Henry, Sweet Henry&quot; (1967), &quot;Sugar&quot; (1972) (reworked as &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; for a 1992 production in London&#x27;s West End starring Tommy Steele and a 2002-2003 United States national tour starring Tony Curtis as Osgood Fielding, Jr.), and &quot;The Red Shoes&quot; (1993).

He provided lyrics to &quot;Loss of Love&quot;, the theme song composed by Henry Mancini for the 1970 Italian drama film &quot;Sunflower&quot;.

He wrote the book and lyrics for the musical &quot;Prettybelle&quot; (1971), starring Angela Lansbury and directed by Gower Champion, which closed in Boston during tryouts. He wrote the music and lyrics for &quot;The Prince of Grand Street&quot; (1978), starring Robert Preston and directed by Gene Saks, which also closed during its Boston tryouts (following negative reviews during the earlier Philadelphia tryout).

Among Merrill&#x27;s television credits were two holiday specials: &quot;Mister Magoo&#x27;s Christmas Carol&quot; (1962)
 and &quot;The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood&quot; (1965), written for Liza Minnelli.

Merrill&#x27;s screenwriting credits include &quot;W. C. Fields and Me&quot; (1976), and the television movies &quot;Portrait of a Showgirl&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Animated Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; (1998). 

==Personal life and death==
Merrill was married to Dolores Marquez in 1964; they divorced and he married Suzanne Reynolds in 1976. Suffering from depression and ill health in his later years, Merrill died by suicide on February 17, 1998, at age 76.

<doc id="683402" wikidata="Q7704184" url="?curid=683402" title="Terry C. Johnston">
<text>Terry Conrad Johnston (1 January 1947 – 25 March 2001) was an American Western fiction author who wrote 31 novels and had more than 10 million books in print.

==Background==
He was born in Arkansas City, Kansas. His parents were a junior college president and a teacher. He gained a BA from Central State University in Edmond, Oklahoma. As a young man, he traveled and worked various jobs, all the while becoming a student of the Old West. Johnston published his first novel, &quot;Carry the Wind&quot;, in 1982 after it had been rejected by 29 publishers; it won the Western Writers of America&#x27;s Medicine Pipe Bearer&#x27;s Award. Johnston wrote his first novel while he worked as a lease manager for Northwest Auto in Northglenn, Colorado, using the company&#x27;s word processor after work to write, sometimes working through the night. He settled near Billings, Montana.

==Major works==
Johnston is best known for two major works: a series of nine historical novels spanning the Rocky Mountain Fur Trade era and its eventual demise told through the eyes of the protagonist, Titus &quot;Scratch&quot; Bass; and a larger number of novels about the Indian wars of the West, the Plainsmen Series, following the conflicts through protagonist Seamus Donegan. Another series of books was based on a possibly true story of a relationship General Custer had with a Cheyenne girl.

==Death and legacy==
Johnston said to his wife that he felt when he killed off Scratch or when Scratch died he wouldn&#x27;t last too long afterwards, and he died of colon cancer on March 25, 2001, only a month after being diagnosed. In his memory The Terry C. Johnston Memorial Scholarship Fund was established at Montana State University Billings, as well as donations made to the Custer Battlefield Preservation Committee and the National Colorectal Cancer Research Alliance.

==Personal life==
He was married three times. His first wife was Doris (Howard) with whom he had one son (Joshua); they divorced in 1982. Johnston&#x27;s second wife was Rhonda (Hill) Stacy with whom he had one son (Noah) and one daughter (Erinn); they divorced in 1992. His third wife was Vanette.

<text>Winnetou is a fictional Native American hero of several novels written in German by Karl May (1842–1912), one of the best-selling German writers of all time with about 200 million copies worldwide, including the &quot;Winnetou&quot; trilogy. The character made his debut in the novel &quot;Old Firehand&quot; (1875).

== Stories ==
In May&#x27;s story, first-person narrator Old Shatterhand encounters the Apache Winnetou, and after initial dramatic events, a true friendship arises between them. On many occasions, they give proof of great fighting skill, but also of compassion for other human beings. May portrays a belief in an innate &quot;goodness&quot; of mankind, albeit constantly threatened by ill-intentioned enemies.

Nondogmatic Christian feelings and values play an important role, and May&#x27;s heroes are often described as German Americans.

Winnetou became the chief of the tribe of the Mescalero Apaches (and of the Apaches in general, with the Navajo included) after his father Intschu-tschuna and his sister Nscho-tschi were slain by the white bandit Santer. He rode a horse called Iltschi (&quot;Wind&quot;) and had a famous rifle called &quot;Silberbüchse&quot; (&quot;The Silver Gun&quot;), a double-barrelled rifle whose stock and butt were decorated with silver studs. Old Shatterhand became the blood brother of Winnetou and rode the brother of Iltschi, called Hatatitla (&quot;Lightning&quot;). In a number of adaptations, Winnetou referred to himself in the third person.

== Themes ==

Karl May&#x27;s &quot;Winnetou&quot; novels symbolize, to some extent, a romantic desire for a simpler life in close contact with nature. The popularity of the series is due in large part to the ability of the stories to tantalize fantasies many Europeans had and have for this more untamed environment. The sequel has become the origin of festivals, and the first regular Karl-May-Spiele were staged 1938 till 1941 in Rathen, Saxony. East Germany restarted those open-air theater plays in 1984. In West Germany, the Karl-May-Festspiele in Bad Segeberg were started as early as 1950 and then expanded to further places like Lennestadt-Elspe in honor of Karl May&#x27;s Apache hero, Winnetou.

The stories were so popular that Nazi Germany did not ban them, instead the argument was made that the stories demonstrated the fall of the American aboriginal peoples was caused by a lack of racial consciousness.

May&#x27;s heroes drew on archetypes of Germanic culture and had little to do with actual Native American cultures. &quot;Winnetou is noble because he combines the highest aspects of otherwise &#x27;decadent&#x27; Indian cultures with the natural adoption of the romantic and Christian traits of Karl May&#x27;s own vision of German civilization. As he is dying, the Apache Winnetou asks some settlers to sing an Ave Maria for him, and his death is sanctified by his quiet conversion to Christianity.&quot;

In the 1960s, French nobleman and actor Pierre Brice played Winnetou in several movies coproduced by West German–Yugoslav producers. At first, Brice was not very excited about the role beside Lex Barker, but his very reduced text and stage play brought Winnetou to real life in West Germany. Brice not only became a star in West Germany, but a significant contributor to German–French reconciliation, as well.

==Comic strip adaptations==
In the 1950s Yugoslavian comic book artist Walter Neugebauer finished his 1930s comic book adaptation of Karl May&#x27;s stories. Another Yugoslavian artist Aleksandar Hecl also drew one. Belgian comics artist Willy Vandersteen created a whole series of comics based on May&#x27;s stories, simply titled &quot;Karl May&quot; (1962–1977). More notable Winnetou comic strip adaptations were done by Spanish writer and artist Juan Arranz for the Dutch comic strip weekly Sjors between 1963 and 1970. Most of these stories were also published in comic strip albums and were syndicated to other European countries. Two Hungarian authors named Horváth Tibor and Zórád Ernö collaborated on yet another comic version in 1957. In West Germany, Helmut Nickel also adapted the source material, published bi-weekly from 1962 to 1966.

== Karl May movies with the Winnetou character ==
In all these movies, Winnetou was played by French actor Pierre Brice, who was wearing Redface, and was usually teamed with Lex Barker as Old Shatterhand. The music for all Winnetou movies (with its famous title melody played on the harmonica by Johnny Müller) was composed by German composer Martin Böttcher, except &quot;Old Shatterhand&quot;, composed by Italian composer Riz Ortolani, and &quot;Winnetou und sein Freund Old Firehand&quot;, composed by German composer Peter Thomas. The films were so successful in West Germany, their budgets could be increased almost every time. Principal shooting usually took place in Paklenica karst river canyon national park, Croatia. The early films preceded the Spaghetti Western.

In 2004–2005, the missing movies were also to reappear on DVD. In 2016 a Blu-ray box with all Winnetou movies was released; they also were made available as part of the Karl May Blu-ray box.

In April 2009, DVDs of the cleared remastered movies were issued in the Czech Republic, selling as an add-on to the &quot;Metro&quot; newspaper for 50 Czech crowns. All movies are dubbed into Czech and German, with subtitles in Czech and Slovak.

*&quot;Winnetous Rückkehr&quot; (&quot;The Return of Winnetou&quot;) (1998), 2 parts, 171 min. in total
*&quot;CBC Documentary 

In 2016, &quot;Winnetou&quot; was published, a modernized version of the classic movies in three parts directed by Philipp Stölzl, starring Nik Xhelilaj as Winnetou.

== In popular culture ==
* The artwork for Gang of Four&#x27;s album &quot;Entertainment!&quot; features a heavily processed image from a Winnetou film.
* The song &quot;Mein Bester Freund&quot; (&quot;My Best Friend&quot;) on the 1991 Die Prinzen album &quot;Das Leben ist grausam&quot; refers to Winnetou in a short list of heroes, alongside Robin Hood and Sherlock Holmes. 
* In 2001, a parody of the Winnetou films, &quot;Der Schuh des Manitu&quot;, was directed by Michael Herbig. This movie is based on various sketches of Herbig&#x27;s TV show &quot;Bullyparade&quot;. In &quot;Bullyparade – Der Film&quot;, which was also directed by Herbig, Winnetou is one of the main characters of the episode &quot;Winnetou in Love&quot;.
* Director Quentin Tarantino mentioned Winnetou in his 2009 film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot;.

<text>The Aztec Ruins National Monument in northwestern New Mexico, United States, consists of preserved structures constructed by the Pueblo Indians. The national monument lies on the western bank of the Animas River in Aztec, New Mexico, about northeast of Farmington. Additional Puebloan structures can be found in Salmon Ruins and Heritage Park, south. Archaeological evidence puts the construction of the ruins in the 12th and 13th centuries. The Puebloan-built ruins were dubbed the &quot;Aztec Ruins&quot; by 19th century American settlers who misattributed their construction to the Aztecs.

The site was declared &quot;Aztec Ruin National Monument&quot; on January 24, 1923. &quot;Ruin&quot; was changed to &quot;Ruins&quot; after a boundary change, on July 2, 1928. As a historical property of the National Park Service, the monument was administratively listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) listed the Chaco Culture as a World Heritage Site on December 8, 1987. That listing specifically included the Aztec Ruins.

The monument is on the Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway, one of New Mexico&#x27;s Scenic Byways.

The property was part of a 160-acre (65 ha) homestead owned by H.D. Abrams, who supported the preservation of the ruins. The H.D. Abrams House in Aztec is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

== Climate ==
The climate of Aztec Ruins National Monument is a typical semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSk&quot;).

<text>The Senate of the Republic of Chile is the upper house of Chile&#x27;s bicameral National Congress, as established in the current Constitution of Chile.

==Composition==
According to the present Constitution of Chile, the Senate is composed of forty-three directly elected senators, chosen by universal popular suffrage vote in 16 senatorial circumscriptions. These serve eight-year terms, with half of them being replaced every fourth year. They must be eligible to vote, have completed secondary school, or its equivalent, and be at least 35 years old.

The Senate meets at the new National Congress building located in the port city of Valparaíso that replaced the old National Congress building located in downtown Santiago, the nation&#x27;s capital.

===Abolition of the unelected===
Amendments to the Constitution, approved by a joint session of Congress on August 16, 2005, eliminated non-directly elected senators from March 11, 2006, the day 20 newly elected senators were sworn in, leaving the total number of senators at 38, all directly elected. Previously, according to the Constitution of 1980, &quot;designated&quot; or &quot;institutional&quot; senators were appointed to the chamber. Two former heads of state, Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle and Augusto Pinochet, were installed as senators for life. Pinochet later resigned from this position and Frei lost his seat in the 2005 reform. However, Frei remained in the Senate by winning an elective seat.

==Historical evolution==
The Senate of Chile was created in 1812 to support the formulations of policies of the Government Junta. Since then it has undergone several constitutional reorganizations that have altered the scope of its constitutional powers, its composition and the generation of its members.

===First senate===
Created by Article 7 of the &quot;Provisional Constitutional Manual&quot; of 1812. It was composed of seven titular members (one for each province) and three alternate members and was supposed to serve as a counterbalance to the executive power of the Government Junta. The senators were directly nominated by the provinces in agreement with the central government. It functioned from November, 1812 to January, 1814, when it was reorganized to better respond to the problems caused by the successive military defeats at the hands of the advancing Spanish Army.

===Consultative senate===
Created by Article 13 of the &quot;Provisional Government Manual&quot; of 1814. As its predecessor, it was composed of seven titular members (only) nominated by the provinces in lists of three from which they were selected by the Supreme Director. It functioned from March to July, 1814, when the Spanish Army captured Santiago, putting an end to the &quot;Patria Vieja&quot; government.

===First conservative senate===
Created by Title III of the Constitution of 1818. It was composed of five titular members and five alternate members selected directly by the Supreme Director. It was supposed to function only when the lower house was not in function or could not meet, and had the power to enact &quot;provisory rules&quot; that had the same effect as laws (hence the &quot;conservative&quot; moniker, because it &quot;conserved&quot; the power.) It functioned from October, 1818 to May, 1822.

<text>The Wessex Football League, known as the Velocity Wessex Football League for sponsorship reasons, is an English regional men&#x27;s football league in southern England. Its members are primarily from Hampshire and Dorset, but clubs from adjoining counties such as Wiltshire, Berkshire, Surrey, and the Isle of Wight are also eligible. The Premier Division is one of the sixteen recognised leagues to form the ninth level of the English football league system (known as Step 5 of the National League System), and Division One is one of seventeen recognised leagues at level 10 (Step 6). 

Champions of the Wessex League who meet the relevant ground and financial requirements are eligible for promotion to the Southern League Division One South or Isthmian League Division One South Central.

==History==
In the summer of 1986 the formation of a Wessex League was discussed. It was proposed to draw clubs from the Hampshire, Dorset, Berks and Bucks, Sussex and Wiltshire FAs. After long discussions the full Football Association approved the league, with the 1986-87 season featuring 17 teams in the league.

Bashley were first champions of the new league, with Brockenhurst finishing last. The 1987–88 season saw the number of teams increase from 17 to 19. Four teams joined the league, but two of the founding teams, Road-Sea Southampton and Portals Athletic, left in unfortunate circumstances. 

In its third year of existence, the league was gaining in prestige and this was reflected by the fact that 17 of the 19 clubs remained in the league. 1990–91 saw the league reach previously untouched heights as 20 clubs participated.

In 2004, it absorbed most of the clubs from its feeder league, the Hampshire League, which formed a new Division Two and Division Three. In 2006 the divisions were renamed as the Premier Division and Divisions One and Two. At the end of the 2006–07 season, Division Two was disbanded, and most of the clubs formed a new Hampshire Premier League.

==Current members==
===Premier Division===


===Division One===
==Past winners==
In 2004, the league expanded to three divisions.

In 2006, the divisions were renumbered, with the top division being renamed the Premier Division.

After the 2006-07 season, Division Two was discontinued.

==Wessex League Cup==
The Wessex League Cup, or Velocity Wessex League Cup for sponsor purposes, is a domestic cup which all the Wessex League teams participate in.

<text>The Protecting Intellectual Rights Against Theft and Expropriation Act of 2004 (), better known as the Pirate Act, was a bill in the United States Congress that would have let federal prosecutors file civil lawsuits against suspected copyright infringers. Prior to the introduction of this act, only criminal lawsuits could be filed against suspected infringers.

==Background==

By the mid-1990s, p2p file sharing over the Internet had risen to prominence. Until 1997, copyright infringement was only considered a criminal offense if it was for the purpose of &quot;commercial advantage or private financial gain.&quot; During this year, the NET Act was passed, which allowed for federal prosecutors to file criminal lawsuits against suspected infringers, without requiring evidence of commercial benefit or financial gain. However, it proved difficult to find legitimate criminal charges, and by 2004, this privilege had yet to be invoked by federal prosecutors.

As file sharing became more popular, the music industry experienced a steady three-year decline in revenue. From 2001 to 2004, the industry lost $5 billion, partially attributed to the increase in online music piracy on websites such as Kazaa, Morpheus and Grokster. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) had filed thousands of civil lawsuits without the aid of federal prosecutors, hoping to deter music piracy at large. One of the first and most famous online copyright infringement lawsuits - Capitol v. Thomas - resulted in a mother of four owing $1.5 million to various music labels for violating copyrights on 24 songs.

==Contents==

The Pirate Act was introduced in the United States Senate as by Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT) on March 25, 2004. It would allow the United States Department of Justice to bring civil copyright infringement cases against individuals suspected of illegal file-sharing on the Internet. In filing a civil lawsuit, knowledge of infringement and willful intent are not required criteria, as they are in criminal cases. Thus, there is a lower burden of proof, making it easier for the DOJ to pursue infringers. Penalties for violating the terms of the bill included fines and prison time of up to 10 years if someone shared 2,500 pieces or more of content, such as songs or movies. Sharing a file that is determined (by a judge) to be worth more than $10,000 can also result in prison time. Additionally, anyone who released content that had not yet been released in wide distribution could also face penalties.

In his argument in favor of the bill, Senator Leahy stated, &quot;Prosecutors can rarely justify bringing criminal charges, and copyright owners have been left to fend for themselves, defending their rights only where they can afford to do so. In a world in which a computer and an Internet connection are all the tools you need to engage in massive piracy, this is an intolerable predicament.&quot;

In addition to granting the DOJ this privilege, the bill also stipulated that the Attorney General would have six months to &quot;develop a program to ensure effective implementation and use of the authority for civil enforcement of the copyright laws&quot;, and report back to Congress on the details of said lawsuits, including the total number of lawsuits and the financial statistics. The DOJ would receive $2 million in order to fund the program at its conception.

==Reaction==

Pro

*Groups within the entertainment industry, including the RIAA and the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) were very supportive of the Pirate Act. Jack Valenti, the MPAA&#x27;s chief executive at the time, commended Senators Hatch and Leahy for &quot;their vision and leadership in combating the theft of America&#x27;s creative works.&quot; Additionally, Mitch Bainwol, then-chairman and CEO of the RIAA, agreed with Valenti&#x27;s sentiments, stating that &quot;this legislation provide[d] federal prosecutors with the flexibility and discretion to bring copyright-infringement cases that best correspond to the nature of the crime.&quot;

Con

*Some organizations feel that the passage of bills such as the Pirate Act would give private industry groups (such as the RIAA) unnecessary aid from the government. By using the financial advantages provided by the DOJ, the Act would put the responsibility of funding the war on intellectual property piracy on taxpayers, rather than the content owners. Those who oppose this legislation feel that it expands the role of government far beyond what is necessary in order to combat the issue. Stacie Rumenap, deputy director of the American Conservative Union, was strongly against the bill: &quot;The Pirate Act is another masquerade by Hollywood to make taxpayers foot the bill for its misguided war on promising new technology. Right now, Hollywood is trying to ram this flawed bill - a handout for Tinsel Town fat cats - through Congress without hearings or debate.&quot;
*Organizations such as P2P United, a group that represents software companies that run file-sharing networks, are opposed to the new laws that would punish file sharers. Instead, they propose that politicians should explore ways in which copyright holders can be paid through the movement of their works through P2P networks.
*During the first quarter of 2004, Senator Leahy received $178,000 in campaign contributions from groups within the entertainment industries, which constituted his second-largest source of donations. Senator Hatch received $152,360 from similar groups.

==Legislative history==

The Pirate Act was grouped into an omnibus bill - The Intellectual Property Protection Act (2004) - with seven other related pieces of legislation, including the Artists&#x27; Rights and Theft Prevention Act of 2004 (ART Act). It passed the Senate by a unanimous vote on June 25, 2004, and was referred to the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary on August 4, 2004, where it eventually failed to pass. Various reincarnations of the Pirate Act were proposed and passed through the Senate in both 2005 and 2006, but both times it again failed to pass through the House.

Another variation - The Intellectual Property Enforcement Act of 2007 - was proposed in the Senate on November 6, 2007, but no progress was made.
