<text>Latent semantic analysis (LSA) is a technique in natural language processing, in particular distributional semantics, of analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain by producing a set of concepts related to the documents and terms. LSA assumes that words that are close in meaning will occur in similar pieces of text (the distributional hypothesis). A matrix containing word counts per document (rows represent unique words and columns represent each document) is constructed from a large piece of text and a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) is used to reduce the number of rows while preserving the similarity structure among columns. Documents are then compared by cosine similarity between any two columns. Values close to 1 represent very similar documents while values close to 0 represent very dissimilar documents.

An information retrieval technique using latent semantic structure was patented in 1988 by Scott Deerwester, Susan Dumais, George Furnas, Richard Harshman, Thomas Landauer, Karen Lochbaum and Lynn Streeter. In the context of its application to information retrieval, it is sometimes called latent semantic indexing (LSI).

== Overview ==

=== Occurrence matrix ===
LSA can use a document-term matrix which describes the occurrences of terms in documents; it is a sparse matrix whose rows correspond to terms and whose columns correspond to documents. A typical example of the weighting of the elements of the matrix is tf-idf (term frequency–inverse document frequency): the weight of an element of the matrix is proportional to the number of times the terms appear in each document, where rare terms are upweighted to reflect their relative importance.

This matrix is also common to standard semantic models, though it is not necessarily explicitly expressed as a matrix, since the mathematical properties of matrices are not always used.

=== Rank lowering ===
After the construction of the occurrence matrix, LSA finds a low-rank approximation to the term-document matrix. There could be various reasons for these approximations:

* The original term-document matrix is presumed too large for the computing resources; in this case, the approximated low rank matrix is interpreted as an &quot;approximation&quot; (a &quot;least and necessary evil&quot;).
* The original term-document matrix is presumed &quot;noisy&quot;: for example, anecdotal instances of terms are to be eliminated. From this point of view, the approximated matrix is interpreted as a &quot;de-noisified matrix&quot; (a better matrix than the original).
* The original term-document matrix is presumed overly sparse relative to the &quot;true&quot; term-document matrix. That is, the original matrix lists only the words actually &quot;in&quot; each document, whereas we might be interested in all words &quot;related to&quot; each document—generally a much larger set due to synonymy.

The consequence of the rank lowering is that some dimensions are combined and depend on more than one term:

:: {(car), (truck), (flower)} → {(1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * truck), (flower)}

This mitigates the problem of identifying synonymy, as the rank lowering is expected to merge the dimensions associated with terms that have similar meanings. It also partially mitigates the problem with polysemy, since components of polysemous words that point in the &quot;right&quot; direction are added to the components of words that share a similar meaning. Conversely, components that point in other directions tend to either simply cancel out, or, at worst, to be smaller than components in the directions corresponding to the intended sense.

=== Derivation ===
Let formula_1 be a matrix where element formula_2 describes the occurrence of term formula_3 in document formula_4 (this can be, for example, the frequency). formula_1 will look like this:

:formula_6

Now a row in this matrix will be a vector corresponding to a term, giving its relation to each document:

:formula_7

Likewise, a column in this matrix will be a vector corresponding to a document, giving its relation to each term:

:formula_8

Now the dot product formula_9 between two term vectors gives the correlation between the terms over the set of documents. The matrix product formula_10 contains all these dot products. Element formula_11 (which is equal to element formula_12) contains the dot product formula_9 (formula_14). Likewise, the matrix formula_15 contains the dot products between all the document vectors, giving their correlation over the terms: formula_16.

Now, from the theory of linear algebra, there exists a decomposition of formula_1 such that formula_18 and formula_19 are orthogonal matrices and formula_20 is a diagonal matrix. This is called a singular value decomposition (SVD):

:formula_21

The matrix products giving us the term and document correlations then become

:formula_22

Since formula_23 and formula_24 are diagonal we see that formula_18 must contain the eigenvectors of formula_10, while formula_19 must be the eigenvectors of formula_15. Both products have the same non-zero eigenvalues, given by the non-zero entries of formula_23, or equally, by the non-zero entries of formula_30. Now the decomposition looks like this:

:formula_31

The values formula_32 are called the singular values, and formula_33 and formula_34 the left and right singular vectors.
Notice the only part of formula_18 that contributes to formula_36 is the formula_37 row.
Let this row vector be called formula_38.
Likewise, the only part of formula_39 that contributes to formula_40 is the formula_41 column, formula_42.
These are &quot;not&quot; the eigenvectors, but &quot;depend&quot; on &quot;all&quot; the eigenvectors.

It turns out that when you select the formula_43 largest singular values, and their corresponding singular vectors from formula_18 and formula_19, you get the rank formula_43 approximation to formula_1 with the smallest error (Frobenius norm). This approximation has a minimal error. But more importantly we can now treat the term and document vectors as a &quot;semantic space&quot;. The row &quot;term&quot; vector formula_48 then has formula_43 entries mapping it to a lower-dimensional space. These new dimensions do not relate to any comprehensible concepts. They are a lower-dimensional approximation of the higher-dimensional space. Likewise, the &quot;document&quot; vector formula_50 is an approximation in this lower-dimensional space. We write this approximation as

:formula_51

You can now do the following:
* See how related documents formula_4 and formula_53 are in the low-dimensional space by comparing the vectors formula_54 and formula_55 (typically by cosine similarity).
* Comparing terms formula_3 and formula_57 by comparing the vectors formula_58 and formula_59. Note that formula_60 is now a column vector.
* Documents and term vector representations can be clustered using traditional clustering algorithms like k-means using similarity measures like cosine.
* Given a query, view this as a mini document, and compare it to your documents in the low-dimensional space.

To do the latter, you must first translate your query into the low-dimensional space. It is then intuitive that you must use the same transformation that you use on your documents:

:formula_61

Note here that the inverse of the diagonal matrix formula_62 may be found by inverting each nonzero value within the matrix.

This means that if you have a query vector formula_53, you must do the translation formula_64 before you compare it with the document vectors in the low-dimensional space. You can do the same for pseudo term vectors:

:formula_65

:formula_66

:formula_67

== Applications ==

The new low-dimensional space typically can be used to:
* Compare the documents in the low-dimensional space (data clustering, document classification).
* Find similar documents across languages, after analyzing a base set of translated documents (cross-language information retrieval).
* Find relations between terms (synonymy and polysemy).
* Given a query of terms, translate it into the low-dimensional space, and find matching documents (information retrieval).
* Find the best similarity between small groups of terms, in a semantic way (i.e. in a context of a knowledge corpus), as for example in multi choice questions MCQ answering model.
* Expand the feature space of machine learning / text mining systems 
* Analyze word association in text corpus 
Synonymy and polysemy are fundamental problems in natural language processing: 
* Synonymy is the phenomenon where different words describe the same idea. Thus, a query in a search engine may fail to retrieve a relevant document that does not contain the words which appeared in the query. For example, a search for &quot;doctors&quot; may not return a document containing the word &quot;physicians&quot;, even though the words have the same meaning.
* Polysemy is the phenomenon where the same word has multiple meanings. So a search may retrieve irrelevant documents containing the desired words in the wrong meaning. For example, a botanist and a computer scientist looking for the word &quot;tree&quot; probably desire different sets of documents.

=== Commercial applications ===

LSA has been used to assist in performing prior art searches for patents.

=== Applications in human memory ===

The use of Latent Semantic Analysis has been prevalent in the study of human memory, especially in areas of free recall and memory search. There is a positive correlation between the semantic similarity of two words (as measured by LSA) and the probability that the words would be recalled one after another in free recall tasks using study lists of random common nouns. They also noted that in these situations, the inter-response time between the similar words was much quicker than between dissimilar words. These findings are referred to as the Semantic Proximity Effect.

When participants made mistakes in recalling studied items, these mistakes tended to be items that were more semantically related to the desired item and found in a previously studied list. These prior-list intrusions, as they have come to be called, seem to compete with items on the current list for recall.

Another model, termed Word Association Spaces (WAS) is also used in memory studies by collecting free association data from a series of experiments and which includes measures of word relatedness for over 72,000 distinct word pairs.

== Implementation ==

The SVD is typically computed using large matrix methods (for example, Lanczos methods) but may also be computed incrementally and with greatly reduced resources via a neural network-like approach, which does not require the large, full-rank matrix to be held in memory.
A fast, incremental, low-memory, large-matrix SVD algorithm has been developed. MATLAB and Python implementations of these fast algorithms are available. Unlike Gorrell and Webb&#x27;s (2005) stochastic approximation, Brand&#x27;s algorithm (2003) provides an exact solution.
In recent years progress has been made to reduce the computational complexity of SVD; for instance, by using a parallel ARPACK algorithm to perform parallel eigenvalue decomposition it is possible to speed up the SVD computation cost while providing comparable prediction quality.

== Limitations ==
Some of LSA&#x27;s drawbacks include:

* The resulting dimensions might be difficult to interpret. For instance, in
:: {(car), (truck), (flower)} ↦ {(1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * truck), (flower)}
:the (1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * truck) component could be interpreted as &quot;vehicle&quot;. However, it is very likely that cases close to
:: {(car), (bottle), (flower)} ↦ {(1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * bottle), (flower)}
:will occur. This leads to results which can be justified on the mathematical level, but have no immediately obvious meaning in natural language. Though, the (1.3452 * car + 0.2828 * bottle) component could be justified because both bottles and cars have transparent and opaque parts, are man made and with high probability contain logos/words on their surface; thus, in many ways these two concepts &quot;share semantics.&quot; That is, within a language in question, there may not be a readily available word to assign and explainability becomes an analysis task as opposed to simple word/class/concept assignment task.

* LSA can only partially capture polysemy (i.e., multiple meanings of a word) because each occurrence of a word is treated as having the same meaning due to the word being represented as a single point in space. For example, the occurrence of &quot;chair&quot; in a document containing &quot;The Chair of the Board&quot; and in a separate document containing &quot;the chair maker&quot; are considered the same. The behavior results in the vector representation being an &quot;average&quot; of all the word&#x27;s different meanings in the corpus, which can make it difficult for comparison. However, the effect is often lessened due to words having a predominant sense throughout a corpus (i.e. not all meanings are equally likely).
* Limitations of bag of words model (BOW), where a text is represented as an unordered collection of words. To address some of the limitation of bag of words model (BOW), multi-gram dictionary can be used to find direct and indirect association as well as higher-order co-occurrences among terms.
* The probabilistic model of LSA does not match observed data: LSA assumes that words and documents form a joint Gaussian model (ergodic hypothesis), while a Poisson distribution has been observed. Thus, a newer alternative is probabilistic latent semantic analysis, based on a multinomial model, which is reported to give better results than standard LSA.

==Alternative methods==

===Semantic hashing===
In semantic hashing documents are mapped to memory addresses by means of a neural network in such a way that semantically similar documents are located at nearby addresses. Deep neural network essentially builds a graphical model of the word-count vectors obtained from a large set of documents. Documents similar to a query document can then be found by simply accessing all the addresses that differ by only a few bits from the address of the query document. This way of extending the efficiency of hash-coding to approximate matching is much faster than locality sensitive hashing, which is the fastest current method. 

===Latent semantic indexing===
Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is an indexing and retrieval method that uses a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify patterns in the relationships between the terms and concepts contained in an unstructured collection of text. LSI is based on the principle that words that are used in the same contexts tend to have similar meanings. A key feature of LSI is its ability to extract the conceptual content of a body of text by establishing associations between those terms that occur in similar contexts.

LSI is also an application of correspondence analysis, a multivariate statistical technique developed by Jean-Paul Benzécri in the early 1970s, to a contingency table built from word counts in documents.

Called &quot; indexing&quot; because of its ability to correlate related terms that are in a collection of text, it was first applied to text at Bellcore in the late 1980s. The method, also called latent semantic analysis (LSA), uncovers the underlying latent semantic structure in the usage of words in a body of text and how it can be used to extract the meaning of the text in response to user queries, commonly referred to as concept searches. Queries, or concept searches, against a set of documents that have undergone LSI will return results that are conceptually similar in meaning to the search criteria even if the results don’t share a specific word or words with the search criteria.

== Benefits of LSI ==

LSI helps overcome synonymy by increasing recall, one of the most problematic constraints of Boolean keyword queries and vector space models. Synonymy is often the cause of mismatches in the vocabulary used by the authors of documents and the users of information retrieval systems. As a result, Boolean or keyword queries often return irrelevant results and miss information that is relevant.

LSI is also used to perform automated document categorization. In fact, several experiments have demonstrated that there are a number of correlations between the way LSI and humans process and categorize text. Document categorization is the assignment of documents to one or more predefined categories based on their similarity to the conceptual content of the categories. LSI uses &quot;example&quot; documents to establish the conceptual basis for each category. During categorization processing, the concepts contained in the documents being categorized are compared to the concepts contained in the example items, and a category (or categories) is assigned to the documents based on the similarities between the concepts they contain and the concepts that are contained in the example documents.

Dynamic clustering based on the conceptual content of documents can also be accomplished using LSI. Clustering is a way to group documents based on their conceptual similarity to each other without using example documents to establish the conceptual basis for each cluster. This is very useful when dealing with an unknown collection of unstructured text.

Because it uses a strictly mathematical approach, LSI is inherently independent of language. This enables LSI to elicit the semantic content of information written in any language without requiring the use of auxiliary structures, such as dictionaries and thesauri. LSI can also perform cross-linguistic concept searching and example-based categorization. For example, queries can be made in one language, such as English, and conceptually similar results will be returned even if they are composed of an entirely different language or of multiple languages.

LSI is not restricted to working only with words. It can also process arbitrary character strings. Any object that can be expressed as text can be represented in an LSI vector space. For example, tests with MEDLINE abstracts have shown that LSI is able to effectively classify genes based on conceptual modeling of the biological information contained in the titles and abstracts of the MEDLINE citations.

LSI automatically adapts to new and changing terminology, and has been shown to be very tolerant of noise (i.e., misspelled words, typographical errors, unreadable characters, etc.). This is especially important for applications using text derived from Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and speech-to-text conversion. LSI also deals effectively with sparse, ambiguous, and contradictory data.

Text does not need to be in sentence form for LSI to be effective. It can work with lists, free-form notes, email, Web-based content, etc. As long as a collection of text contains multiple terms, LSI can be used to identify patterns in the relationships between the important terms and concepts contained in the text.

LSI has proven to be a useful solution to a number of conceptual matching problems. The technique has been shown to capture key relationship information, including causal, goal-oriented, and taxonomic information.

== Mathematics of LSI ==

LSI uses common linear algebra techniques to learn the conceptual correlations in a collection of text. In general, the process involves constructing a weighted term-document matrix, performing a Singular Value Decomposition on the matrix, and using the matrix to identify the concepts contained in the text.

=== Term-document matrix ===

LSI begins by constructing a term-document matrix, formula_68, to identify the occurrences of the formula_69 unique terms within a collection of formula_70 documents. In a term-document matrix, each term is represented by a row, and each document is represented by a column, with each matrix cell, formula_71, initially representing the number of times the associated term appears in the indicated document, formula_72. This matrix is usually very large and very sparse.

Once a term-document matrix is constructed, local and global weighting functions can be applied to it to condition the data. The weighting functions transform each cell, formula_71 of formula_68, to be the product of a local term weight, formula_75, which describes the relative frequency of a term in a document, and a global weight, formula_76, which describes the relative frequency of the term within the entire collection of documents.

Some common local weighting functions are defined in the following table.

Some common global weighting functions are defined in the following table.

Empirical studies with LSI report that the Log and Entropy weighting functions work well, in practice, with many data sets. In other words, each entry formula_71 of formula_68 is computed as:

:formula_79

:formula_80

=== Rank-reduced singular value decomposition ===

A rank-reduced, singular value decomposition is performed on the matrix to determine patterns in the relationships between the terms and concepts contained in the text. The SVD forms the foundation for LSI. It computes the term and document vector spaces by approximating the single term-frequency matrix, formula_68, into three other matrices— an m by r term-concept vector matrix formula_82, an r by r singular values matrix formula_83, and a n by r concept-document vector matrix, formula_84, which satisfy the following relations:

formula_85

formula_86

formula_87

In the formula, A is the supplied m by n weighted matrix of term frequencies in a collection of text where m is the number of unique terms, and n is the number of documents. T is a computed m by r matrix of term vectors where r is the rank of A—a measure of its unique dimensions ≤ min(&quot;m,n&quot;). S is a computed r by r diagonal matrix of decreasing singular values, and D is a computed n by r matrix of document vectors.

The SVD is then truncated to reduce the rank by keeping only the largest k « r diagonal entries in the singular value matrix S,
where k is typically on the order 100 to 300 dimensions.
This effectively reduces the term and document vector matrix sizes to m by k and n by k respectively. The SVD operation, along with this reduction, has the effect of preserving the most important semantic information in the text while reducing noise and other undesirable artifacts of the original space of A. This reduced set of matrices is often denoted with a modified formula such as:

:::::::A ≈ A&quot;k&quot; = T&quot;k&quot; S&quot;k&quot; D&quot;k&quot;T

Efficient LSI algorithms only compute the first k singular values and term and document vectors as opposed to computing a full SVD and then truncating it.

Note that this rank reduction is essentially the same as doing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the matrix A, except that PCA subtracts off the means. PCA loses the sparseness of the A matrix, which can make it infeasible for large lexicons.

== Querying and augmenting LSI vector spaces ==

The computed T&quot;k&quot; and D&quot;k&quot; matrices define the term and document vector spaces, which with the computed singular values, S&quot;k&quot;, embody the conceptual information derived from the document collection. The similarity of terms or documents within these spaces is a factor of how close they are to each other in these spaces, typically computed as a function of the angle between the corresponding vectors.

The same steps are used to locate the vectors representing the text of queries and new documents within the document space of an existing LSI index. By a simple transformation of the A = T S DT equation into the equivalent D = AT T S−1 equation, a new vector, d, for a query or for a new document can be created by computing a new column in A and then multiplying the new column by T S−1. The new column in A is computed using the originally derived global term weights and applying the same local weighting function to the terms in the query or in the new document.

A drawback to computing vectors in this way, when adding new searchable documents, is that terms that were not known during the SVD phase for the original index are ignored. These terms will have no impact on the global weights and learned correlations derived from the original collection of text. However, the computed vectors for the new text are still very relevant for similarity comparisons with all other document vectors.

The process of augmenting the document vector spaces for an LSI index with new documents in this manner is called &quot;folding in&quot;. Although the folding-in process does not account for the new semantic content of the new text, adding a substantial number of documents in this way will still provide good results for queries as long as the terms and concepts they contain are well represented within the LSI index to which they are being added. When the terms and concepts of a new set of documents need to be included in an LSI index, either the term-document matrix, and the SVD, must be recomputed or an incremental update method (such as the one described in ) is needed.

== Additional uses of LSI ==

It is generally acknowledged that the ability to work with text on a semantic basis is essential to modern information retrieval systems. As a result, the use of LSI has significantly expanded in recent years as earlier challenges in scalability and performance have been overcome.

LSI is being used in a variety of information retrieval and text processing applications, although its primary application has been for concept searching and automated document categorization. Below are some other ways in which LSI is being used:

* Information discovery (eDiscovery, Government/Intelligence community, Publishing)
* Automated document classification (eDiscovery, Government/Intelligence community, Publishing)
* Text summarization (eDiscovery, Publishing)
* Relationship discovery (Government, Intelligence community, Social Networking)
* Automatic generation of link charts of individuals and organizations (Government, Intelligence community)
* Matching technical papers and grants with reviewers (Government)
* Online customer support (Customer Management)
* Determining document authorship (Education)
* Automatic keyword annotation of images
* Understanding software source code (Software Engineering)
* Filtering spam (System Administration)
* Information visualization
* Essay scoring (Education)
* Literature-based discovery
* Stock returns prediction
* Dream Content Analysis (Psychology) 

LSI is increasingly being used for electronic document discovery (eDiscovery) to help enterprises prepare for litigation. In eDiscovery, the ability to cluster, categorize, and search large collections of unstructured text on a conceptual basis is essential. Concept-based searching using LSI has been applied to the eDiscovery process by leading providers as early as 2003.

== Challenges to LSI ==

Early challenges to LSI focused on scalability and performance. LSI requires relatively high computational performance and memory in comparison to other information retrieval techniques. However, with the implementation of modern high-speed processors and the availability of inexpensive memory, these considerations have been largely overcome. Real-world applications involving more than 30 million documents that were fully processed through the matrix and SVD computations are common in some LSI applications. A fully scalable (unlimited number of documents, online training) implementation of LSI is contained in the open source gensim software package.

Another challenge to LSI has been the alleged difficulty in determining the optimal number of dimensions to use for performing the SVD. As a general rule, fewer dimensions allow for broader comparisons of the concepts contained in a collection of text, while a higher number of dimensions enable more specific (or more relevant) comparisons of concepts. The actual number of dimensions that can be used is limited by the number of documents in the collection. Research has demonstrated that around 300 dimensions will usually provide the best results with moderate-sized document collections (hundreds of thousands of documents) and perhaps 400 dimensions for larger document collections (millions of documents). However, recent studies indicate that 50-1000 dimensions are suitable depending on the size and nature of the document collection. Checking the proportion of variance retained, similar to PCA or factor analysis, to determine the optimal dimensionality is not suitable for LSI. Using a synonym test or prediction of missing words are two possible methods to find the correct dimensionality. When LSI topics are used as features in supervised learning methods, one can use prediction error measurements to find the ideal dimensionality.

<text>Television South West (TSW) was the ITV franchise holder for the South West England region from 1 January 1982 until 31 December 1992, broadcasting from studios at Derry&#x27;s Cross in Plymouth, Devon.

==History==
===Origins and Launch===
On 28 December 1980 TSW was awarded the contract to serve the South West England region from the night of 31 December 1981 at 12 midnight for a 10-year period, succeeding incumbent Westward Television, which had served the area since 1961.

TSW promised greater investment in the area including the introduction of electronic news gathering facilities at a number of sites in the region (a process already started by Westward) and a stronger emphasis on local programming (an area in which Westward had been particularly successful).

However, TSW&#x27;s success in winning the contract may have been helped by boardroom friction within Westward which had blighted the company for several years and incurred criticism from the Independent Broadcasting Authority. During negotiations to purchase Westward&#x27;s facilities at Derry&#x27;s Cross in Plymouth, the management of TSW bought the whole Westward company for £2.38 million and thus went on air four months early on 12 August 1981, although it transmitted under the Westward name until the end of the year.

TSW was seen as slightly more ambitious than both its predecessor Westward Television and its successor Westcountry Television and its presentation, although still homelier than much seen on ITV and not dissimilar to that of Westward, was considered more professional than that of its forebear.

TSW was one of the last ITV companies to start broadcasting 24 hours a day, which it did on 2 September 1988 – the same day as Border Television, Tyne Tees Television and Grampian Television. It was also one of the first ITV companies to broadcast in NICAM digital stereo, which it started doing in summer 1990.

===Launch===

Shortly, right after Roger Shaw delivered the closing announcement on Westward&#x27;s closing night, TSW began with a short video clip of a champagne bottle being opened accompanied by the short audio version of the station ident &quot;That&#x27;s Soul, Write&quot;. Shaw then reappeared wearing a modern suit (no longer in a dinner jacket), and now in a modern chair, surrounded by staff wearing TSW T-shirts and holding 2&quot; videotapes. This was clearly to remind viewers of a new modern era. Shaw made the first announcement on TSW:

This was followed by the full version of TSW&#x27;s ident. The comedy programme was followed by further continuity, an epilogue, weather &amp; shipping forecast and closedown – &quot;all&quot; with TSW branding. However, when the screen finally faded to black at approximately 12:40am on 1 January 1982, Shaw made a final out-of-vision courtesy announcement and managed to mention the now-defunct &quot;Westward&quot; one last time, saying &#x27;from all the staff here at &quot;Westward&quot; – good night&#x27;.

===Franchise loss and closure===
On 16 October 1991, following changes to the way ITV contracts were issued (via a blind auction rather than a bid on merits and potential) it was announced that TSW had lost its franchise because of an &#x27;unrealistic business plan&#x27; related to its bid, which was viewed by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) as being far too high. This triggered TSW to apply for a judicial review against the ITC, on the grounds that its bid had been unfairly dismissed. TSW believed that it was a casualty of the ITC&#x27;s wish not to renew TVS&#x27;s franchise, despite being the highest bid, while renewing Granada&#x27;s when it had been outbid. The case went right to the House of Lords, but was rejected in February 1992. The implications of the court case did change the behaviour of the ITC into being more open with regards to its business.

TSW&#x27;s high bid of £16.12 million had been influenced largely by managing director Harry Turner&#x27;s correct expectation of competitors for its franchise area, which were TeleWest Broadcasting (not to be confused with the telecommunications provider of the same name) and Westcountry Television, the latter &quot;looking frighteningly well organised&quot; that had worried TSW. TeleWest was headed by local independent programme producer Mallory Maltby and included BBC News personality Angela Rippon and several ex-TSW personnel in its line-up, but had failed on quality grounds unlike Westcountry. Westcountry, meanwhile, was chaired by merchant banker Stephen Redfarn, who was a former associate of James Gatward (one of the founders of neighbouring TVS), received the support of such figures as John Banham (the then-director of Confederation of British Industry), Frank Copplestone (the former managing director of TVS&#x27;s predecessor Southern Television) and John Prescott-Thomas (a television executive at BBC South West), and had financial backing from Associated Newspapers, Brittany Ferries and South West Water, which TSW had assumed would have helped Westcountry to &quot;certainly bid to their maximum capacity&quot;, a bid a &quot;worried&quot; TSW itself had estimated would have been £12 million a year rather than the less-than-£8 million Westcountry ended up bidding.

===Closing ceremony===
Westcountry Television won the South West region franchise and took over from TSW at midnight on 1 January 1993. On 31 December 1992, TSW marked its final day of transmission with a number of special programmes and continuity links. Continuity announcers Sally Meen and Tristram Payne shared the daytime announcing/newsreading shift with Ian Stirling and Ruth Langsford taking over for the last few evening shifts. The day&#x27;s schedule included the final edition of &quot;Gus Honeybun&#x27;s Magic Birthdays&quot;, a repeat of the award-winning documentary, &quot;A Day in the Life of...Beryl Cook&quot; and a one-hour &quot;TSW Today&quot; special featuring the last regional news bulletin and an expansive look back at TSW&#x27;s programming. Along with other ITV broadcasters, with the exceptions of TVS, which broadcast its own farewell special, &quot;Goodbye to All That&quot;, and both Scottish Television and Grampian Television which broadcast the traditional Hogmanay, the last ever programme broadcast on TSW was Thames Television&#x27;s own farewell programme, entitled &quot;The End Of The Year Show: The Best... from Thames&quot;.

After that show&#x27;s closing credits, the final sign-off announcement was made by Ian Stirling and Ruth Langsford at 11:55pm, bidding farewell to the departing station by thanking the viewers and paying tribute – after which, TSW handed over to ITN for the news headlines and midnight chimes of the Big Ben in a brief news bulletin entitled &quot;Into the New Year&quot;. At the end of the bulletin, transmission was switched to Westcountry Television.

===After 1993===
After the franchise loss, TSW undertook a reverse takeover with the White Ward Group, makers of safety footwear and associated articles. The name of the company was changed to UK Safety Ltd, and traded for a number of years, before entering administrative receivership.

Upon losing the franchise, the directors of TSW established a public film and television archive, based around the back catalogue of Westward and TSW programmes they owned. They created the TSW Film and Television Archive, one of the first and largest of what has now become a network of regional film archives. The archive is a charitable trust, existing to preserve the region&#x27;s moving image heritage. It is open to the public and holds film and television recordings from a wide variety of sources, including donations from the general public.

The archive, renamed the South West Film and Television Archive (SWFTA) in 2003, holds the entire surviving back catalogue of Westward and TSW programmes, and several tens of thousands of other items (which all have a connection to the south-west of England) donated by members of the general public.

The SWFTA, now known as The Box, aims to preserve moving image material as a resource for future generations. The archive is managed by a qualified archivist who is supported by a team of employed staff and volunteers, most of whom came from TSW. They regularly supply material for a wide variety of educational and other uses. They provide community film shows and help anyone with an interest in using or viewing the material they hold. SWFTA participated in the national digitising project Unlocking Film Heritage.

==Studios==
When TSW won the franchise, the company purchased Westward&#x27;s studio facilities at Derry&#x27;s Cross, Plymouth along with all the staff. The studios, which had suffered from a lack of investment under Westward, were completely refurbished with a £4 million investment programme which saw the introduction of new production equipment and an additional studio being constructed. The refurbishment was completed two years later.

When TSW lost its franchise, its successor, Westcountry, chose not to purchase the studios, preferring new facilities outside Plymouth city centre, at Langage Science Park, Plympton instead, ending 31 years of broadcasting from Derry&#x27;s Cross Studios. Transmission control of the new station would not be handled in Plymouth as previously, but in Cardiff at HTV Wales headquarters. The old TSW studios were then stripped with the equipment being auctioned, and the building itself was converted into offices. A solicitors practice called Foot Anstey (formerly Foot &amp; Bowden) was then based there until 16 March 2009 The former studios were demolished just before Christmas 2009 to make way for an adjacent retail, residential and hotel development.

In addition to the Plymouth base, TSW also operated a newsroom and remote studio in Yeovil, as well as local offices in Barnstaple and Exeter.

==Station identity==
TSW&#x27;s symbol was an abstract design representing palm trees, rolling hills and water; features typical of the region.

The music accompanying the original ident was a section of the station theme, &quot;That&#x27;s Soul, Write&quot;, written and composed by Will Malone, which was also aired regularly at closedown until 1985.

In September 1989, when the ITV network introduced a new corporate logo and national on-air identity, TSW was one of the five regions that didn&#x27;t use the generic idents designed for the region, preferring to stay with their own idents.

==Programming==
Like its predecessor, TSW produced few programmes for the ITV network. Exceptions to this included the game shows, &quot;That&#x27;s My Dog&quot; and &quot;Sounds Like Music&quot; and children&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Tube Mice&quot;, about mice who lived beneath the London Underground. It also produced &quot;The Cut Price Comedy Show&quot;, a short-lived production broadcast in the early days of Channel 4. Locally, TSW continued to utilise the Westward star Gus Honeybun, a rabbit puppet that (along with the station&#x27;s continuity announcers) read out birthday dedications on-air to children from the area, who had sent in their cards to him.

TSW also specialised in making relatively highbrow programmes for the region; in the arts world, it produced documentaries showcasing amongst others, leading concert pianist Moura Lympany, potter Bernard Leach, and sculptor Barbara Hepworth.

===Scheduling opt-outs===
TSW was a notably regional company, declaring itself as a channel in its own right, rather than just being part of the ITV network. It had a reputation for scheduling to suit its own requirements and would often broadcast particular shows at different times to the other ITV regions or even opt out of network activity completely. Such notable scheduling changes included:

* Series two of &quot;Blockbusters&quot; was not broadcast in full. Around 50 editions of the 1984/5 series were shown eight months later, during summer holiday mornings: 1 July – 24 August 1985.
* Weekday editions of &quot;Gus Honeybun&#x27;s Magic Birthdays&quot; often replaced the first and last &quot;Children&#x27;s ITV&quot; live in-vision continuity links of the day, from 1987 – 1990.
* The Australian soap, &quot;Home and Away&quot; was moved from its 5:10pm teatime repeat slot to a much earlier time-slot of 3:27pm on 20 September 1989. It stayed in this afternoon time-slot for three years until September 1992.
* The networked sitcom, &quot;The Piglet Files&quot;, starring Nicholas Lyndhurst, was not shown on TSW until a few months after its original run in all other ITV regions. Another networked sitcom, &quot;The Nineteenth Hole&quot;, starring Eric Sykes, was dropped mid-run after complaints from viewers regarding its politically incorrect humour.
* &quot;The ITV Chart Show&quot; was dropped on occasions (mostly for special programmes) so that TSW could show its weekly news review for deaf people, &quot;The South West Week&quot;.

Additionally, Channel Television, the ITV contractor for the Channel Islands required a network feed from another nearby ITV region on the mainland, which was provided by Westward Television for many years, until it lost its franchise in 1981. TSW took over the requirement from 1982, until 1986, when Channel switched to TVS for the feed instead. After TVS lost its franchise in the 1991 ITV auction round, Meridian Broadcasting provided the network feed from 1993 onwards.

<text>Nelson Alexander Ross (born January 22, 1970) is an American comic book writer and artist known primarily for his painted interiors, covers, and design work. He first became known with the 1994 miniseries &quot;Marvels&quot;, on which he collaborated with writer Kurt Busiek for Marvel Comics. He has since done a variety of projects for both Marvel and DC Comics, such as the 1996 miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, which he also cowrote. Since then he has done covers and character designs for Busiek&#x27;s series &quot;Astro City&quot;, and various projects for Dynamite Entertainment. His feature film work includes concept and narrative art for &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2002) and &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; (2004), and DVD packaging art for the M. Night Shyamalan film &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (2000). He has done covers for &quot;TV Guide&quot;, promotional artwork for the Academy Awards, posters and packaging design for video games, and his renditions of superheroes have been merchandised as action figures.

Ross&#x27;s style, which usually employs a combination of gouache and wash, has been said to exhibit &quot;a Norman-Rockwell-meets-George-Pérez vibe&quot;, and has been praised for its realistic, human depictions of classic comic book characters. His rendering style, his attention to detail, and the perceived tendency of his characters to be depicted staring off into the distance in cover images has been satirized in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine.

==Early life==
Alex Ross was born in Portland, Oregon, and raised in Lubbock, Texas, by his United Church of Christ minister father, Clark, and his mother, Lynette, a commercial artist from whom he would learn many of the trademarks of his artistic style. Ross first began drawing at age three, and was first influenced by superheroes when he discovered Spider-Man on an episode of the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;The Electric Company&quot;.

He would later be influenced by comics artists such as John Romita Sr., Neal Adams, George Pérez and Bernie Wrightson, and attempted to imitate Pérez&#x27; style when he did superhero work, and Wrightson&#x27;s when he did what he calls &quot;serious&quot; work. By age 16, Ross discovered the realistic work of illustrators such as Andrew Loomis and Norman Rockwell, and envisioned one day seeing such styles applied to comic book art.

At age 17, Ross began studying painting at the American Academy of Art in Chicago, where his mother had studied. During his years there, Ross discovered the work of other artists like J. C. Leyendecker and Salvador Dalí, whose &quot;hyper-realistic quality&quot;, Ross saw, was not that far removed from that of comics. It was during this time that he formed the idea to paint his own comic books. Ross graduated after three years.

==Career==
===1990s===
After graduating, Ross took a job at an advertising agency as a storyboard artist. Ross&#x27;s first published comic book work was the 1990 five-issue miniseries, &quot;&quot;, written by Ron Fortier and published by NOW Comics. Ross created all of the art, from pencils through coloring for the series. He performed similar work on a variety of titles over the next few years. His first work for Marvel Comics was to have been printed in the science-fiction anthology series &quot;Open Space&quot; #5 but the title was cancelled with issue #4 (August 1990). Ross&#x27;s story was printed in 1999 as a special supplement to &quot;Wizard&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Alex Ross Special&quot;. In 1993, he completed his first painted superhero assignment, the cover of a Superman novel, &quot;&quot;.
During this time, Ross met writer Kurt Busiek, and the two began submitting proposals for series that would feature paintings as their internal art. Marvel agreed to a project that would tell much of the history of the Marvel Universe from the perspective of an ordinary person. That limited series, &quot;Marvels,&quot; was released in 1994, and chronicled the life of a photojournalist, as he reacted to living in a world of superheroes and villains.

Busiek, Ross, and penciller Brent Anderson created &quot;Astro City&quot;, first published by Image Comics in 1995 and later by WildStorm Comics. The series features an original superhero world and continues the theme of &quot;Marvels&quot;, exploring how ordinary people, superheroes and villains react to a world where the fantastic is commonplace. Ross paints the covers and helps set the costumes and the general look and feel for the series, which has been published sporadically in recent years.

In 1996, Ross worked with writer Mark Waid on the DC Comics limited series &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;, which presents a possible future for the DC Universe in which Superman and several other classic superheroes return from retirement to tame a generation of brutal antiheroes. The work featured Ross&#x27;s redesigned versions of many DC characters, as well as a new generation of characters. Ross co-created the original character Magog, patterning his appearance and costume on Cable and Shatterstar, two characters created by Rob Liefeld. DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that &quot;Waid&#x27;s deep knowledge of the heroes&#x27; pasts served them well, and Ross&#x27; unique painted art style made a powerful statement about the reality of the world they built.&quot;

Ross followed &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; with &quot;Uncle Sam&quot;, an experimental non-superhero work for DC&#x27;s Vertigo line that examines the dark side of American history. Ross drew the lenticular covers for &quot;Superman: Forever&quot; #1 (June 1998) and &quot;Batman: No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; #1 (March 1999). Between 1998 and 2003, writer Paul Dini and Ross produced annual tabloid-sized editions celebrating the 60th anniversaries of DC Comics&#x27; Superman (&quot;&quot;), Batman (&quot;&quot;), Shazam (&quot;Shazam! Power of Hope&quot;), and Wonder Woman (&quot;Wonder Woman: Spirit of Truth&quot;), as well as two specials featuring the Justice League, &quot;Secret Origins&quot; and &quot;Liberty and Justice&quot;.

===2000s===
In the early 2000s, with writer Jim Krueger, Ross plotted and designed characters for a trilogy of Marvel limited series, &quot;Earth X&quot;, &quot;Universe X&quot;, and &quot;Paradise X&quot;, which combined dozens of Marvel characters from various time periods.

When M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s film &quot;Unbreakable&quot; was released to video in 2001, the DVD included an insert with Ross&#x27;s original art, as well as a commentary by Ross, regarding superheroes, in the movie&#x27;s special features.

In 2001, Ross won acclaim for his work on special comic books benefiting the families of those killed in the September 11, 2001, attacks, including his portraits of paramedics, police and firefighters. He has designed DC merchandise, including posters, dinner plates, and statues. In late 2001, Ross painted four covers to the December 8, 2001, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, which depicted Tom Welling, Kristin Kreuk and Michael Rosenbaum of the TV series &quot;Smallville&quot;, and Superman.

Ross designed a series of costumes for the 2002 film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;, though they were not used in the film. In the film&#x27;s video game tie-in, as an Easter egg, it is possible to unlock a playable version of Ross&#x27;s Spider-Man design. When using this, the Green Goblin will feature one of Ross&#x27;s unused character outfits. Ross&#x27;s design was featured as an unlockable costume and available in a white version in the PlayStation game &quot;Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro&quot;.

In early 2002, Ross designed the promotional poster for the 2002 Academy Awards, which depicted Oscar perched atop the First National Building. The Academy loaned Ross an actual Oscar statuette for a week for him to use as reference for the painting. Ross stated that he photographed members of his family as if they were receiving it. That same year, he was one of four artists who depicted Spider-Man on one of the covers to the April 27, 2002, issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; as a promotional tie-in to the feature film &quot;Spider-Man&quot;.
Ross illustrated the cover art on the Anthrax albums &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot; (2003), &quot;Music of Mass Destruction&quot; (2004), &quot;Worship Music&quot; (2011), and &quot;For All Kings&quot; (2016).

In 2003, Pantheon Books published the coffee table book &quot;Mythology: The DC Comics Art of Alex Ross&quot;, written and designed by Chip Kidd, and featuring a foreword written by M. Night Shyamalan. In late 2005, a paperback version of the book was published to include new artwork by Ross, including sketches for his &quot;Justice&quot; mini-series. Also in 2004, Ross designed 15 paintings for the opening credits of the film &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot;. The paintings presented key elements from the first film. Ross later donated the paintings to be auctioned off on eBay to benefit the United Cancer Front.

In 2005, Ross designed the DVD illustration covers for the re-release of &quot;Gatchaman&quot; by ADV Films. He appeared in a featurette discussing his involvement of Gatchaman in his career.

In August 2005, Ross worked again with writer Jim Krueger and penciler Doug Braithwaite on 12-issue, bi-monthly limited series &quot;Justice&quot; for DC Comics. The series focuses on the enemies of the Justice League of America banding together in an effort to defeat them.

The cover of the &quot;Savior of the Universe Edition&quot; DVD of the 1980 film &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, released on August 7, 2007, features a cover painted by Ross. An avid fan of the film, he starred in a featurette on the DVD where he discussed the movie, which he names as his favorite movie of all time.

In 2008, Ross embarked on projects focusing on Golden Age characters: &quot;Project Superpowers&quot; with Jim Krueger for Dynamite Entertainment. That same year, Ross wrote and illustrated &quot;Avengers/Invaders&quot;. It features Marvel characters but was published by Dynamite Entertainment. The story pits World War II versions of Captain America, Namor, and other classic war characters against the modern Avengers groups. Late 2008 saw the release of two Ross prints that were made into T-shirts: one, &quot;Bush Sucking Democracy Dry&quot;, featuring George W. Bush as a vampire sucking the blood from Lady Liberty, and the other, &quot;Time for a Change&quot;, featuring Barack Obama as a superhero. The latter was made into a T-shirt, with which Obama was seen posing at a public event. Ross painted the &quot;Kollectors Edition&quot; cover for the console game &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;. The artwork was released on October 9, 2008, as was a video chronicling Ross&#x27;s process of painting it. Ross is featured in his own segment on the Blu-ray/DVD included in the package.

Dynamite Entertainment announced that Ross would illustrate covers for the &quot;Fighting American&quot; series.

===2010s===
Other Ross projects for Dynamite include acting as the creative director on &quot;The Phantom&quot; comic book series. and teaming with Kurt Busiek on &quot;Kirby: Genesis&quot;, an eight-issue miniseries which debuted in 2011. The series was their first full collaboration since &quot;Marvels&quot; 17 years previous, and features a large group of Jack Kirby&#x27;s creator-owned characters, the rights to which were acquired by Dynamite, such as Silver Star, Captain Victory, Galaxy Green, Tiger 21, and the Ninth Men. Ross handled the series&#x27; co-plotting, designs, and covers, apart from overseeing the book overall with Busiek, who was the writer.

Since 2011, Ross has been painting covers for several Dynamite titles such as &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, &quot;Silver Star&quot;, &quot;Captain Victory&quot;, &quot;The Bionic Man&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Jungle&quot;, &quot;The Spider&quot;, among others.

In 2012 Ross drew promotional artwork of Ratonhnhaké:ton, the main character of the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;, used on the cover of the April 2012 issue of &quot;Game Informer&quot; and the collectible steelbook case provided with certain editions of the game. that same year, Ross returned to interior painted art with &quot;Masks&quot;, a story in which the Shadow, the Spider, the Green Hornet, Zorro, and others join forces to combat a mutual threat.

In 2013 Ross created an exclusive GameStop pre-order poster for the video game &quot;Watch Dogs&quot;, which was scheduled for debut November 19 of that year, but was delayed to 2014. The game is set in Ross&#x27;s home city, Chicago, which Ross emphasized in the image by placing the Willis Tower and the elevated train tracks in the background.

With Marvel&#x27;s &quot;All-New, All-Different Marvel&quot; relaunch, Ross did a variety of covers for the main comics in the relaunch such as the cover for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Squadron Supreme&quot;.

In 2015, following the conclusion of that year&#x27;s &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, Ross designed the high-tech variation of Spider-Man&#x27;s costume that the character wore during Dan Slott and Giuseppe Camuncoli&#x27;s run on &quot;The Amazing-Spider-Man&quot;.

===2020s===
In 2020, Ross provided the main cover for the Marvel Comics book &quot;The Rise of Ultraman&quot; #1. In the ensuing early part of that decade, he had stints as the regular cover artist on Marvel titles including &quot;Iron Man&quot;, &quot;Black Panther&quot;, &quot;Captain America&quot;, and &quot;Immortal Hulk&quot;.

In April 2022, Ross was reported among the more than three dozen comics creators who contributed to Operation USA&#x27;s benefit anthology book, &quot;Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds&quot;, a project spearheaded by editor Scott Dunbier, whose profits would be donated to relief efforts for Ukrainian refugees resulting from the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Ross provided the cover to the hardcover edition of the book.

In September 2022, Ross released &quot;Fantastic Four: Full Circle&quot;, a 64 page graphic novel in which the Fantastic Four venture through the Negative Zone, on which Ross served as both writer and artist, in collaboration with colorist Josh Johnson for Marvel Comics. The book was the first long-form work that Ross both wrote and drew, and was his take on a classic &#x27;60s &quot;FF&quot; story by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The American Library Association listed it among their 2022 Best Graphic Novels for Adults, noting &quot;The layouts and storytelling are unmistakably those of Alex Ross, but he has also exchanged his usual realistic palette for a bolder more expressive color scheme.&quot; Chris Neill, writing for Kotaku, praised the book, noting the &quot;fairly meat and potatoes plot&quot;, but applauding the art, calling it &quot;the best looking comic you&#x27;ll see this year&quot;. Neill opined that whereas Ross&#x27; usual style can exhibit a stiffness by making the reader too aware that they are looking at a painting, thus hampering the storytelling flow, his decision to ink his lines and use a limited palette of flat colors with no modern computer shading techniques gave the art a greater quality of grit and texture. Neill also lauded the digital dot screen effect that harkened back to the technqiue used to render comics in decades past. Michael Cavna included it in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s list of the Ten Best Graphic Novels of 2022.

==Personal life==
As of December 2018, Ross lives in the suburbs of Chicago.

<doc id="689441" wikidata="Q2454633" url="?curid=689441" title="La Honda, California">
<text>La Honda (Spanish for &quot;The Sling&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) in southern San Mateo County, California, United States. The population was 979 at the 2020 census. It is located in the Santa Cruz Mountains between the Santa Clara Valley and California&#x27;s Pacific coast. La Honda is near the La Honda Creek Open Space Preserve and State Route 84 on the ocean side of the Coastal Range.

The ZIP Code for La Honda is 94020 and the area code is 650. Land-line numbers in the La Honda telephone exchange follow the pattern 747-xxxx while wired telephones in and around the Middleton Tract (along Portola State Park Road) work out of the Los Altos exchange with 94x-xxxx numbers. Per the U.S. Geological Survey, &quot;Lahonda&quot; is a historic variant of the modern spelling.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP covers an area of 4.3 square miles (11.0 km), 99.65% of it land, and 0.35% of it water.

===Habitat===
La Honda is home to diverse habitats, from cool, moist forests of coast redwood and coast Douglas fir, to mixed woodland, chaparral, and grassy hillsides.

===Climate===

This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, La Honda has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps. In addition, like much of California, the town receives most of its rain between November and April. Due to El Niño, the region sometimes receives heavy winter rains, making it vulnerable to landslides. Scenic Drive, a local road, has seen three landslides since 1998. With elevations ranging from about 300 feet where La Honda Creek meets Alpine Creek, to more than 1200 feet in the hills, the weather may vary between the town&#x27;s hillsides and valleys. Sometimes the marine layer is too low to reach the hills, leaving the lower elevations foggy or overcast while the mountains enjoy clearer weather. On some winter nights, similar thermal inversions trap cold air in the valleys, leading to frost, with higher elevations remaining generally milder. These same weather patterns are at play in much of the coast-facing Santa Cruz Mountains.

== Early history ==

The Ohlone lived in San Mateo County for at least 3,000 years prior to European arrival and had more than 40 communities in the region. The La Honda Ohlone were hunter gatherers and lived without farming or herd animals.

The creek that runs through the town is listed as Arroyo Ondo on several diseños on the Mexican land grants and as Arroyo Hondo on the 1856 Rancho Cañada de Raymundo map. Hondo is Spanish for &#x27;deep&#x27;. The post office was listed as La Honda in 1880 and revised to Lahonda after 1895. The name was restored in 1905 owing to Z. S. Eldredge&#x27;s efforts.

In 1862 John Howell Sears purchased 400 acres and settled in La Honda after his prior residence in Searsville was sold to the water company due to the decline of lumber and flooding issues. The early days of La Honda were built around the lumber industry and the Old Store at La Honda was one of the earliest buildings.

== Recent history ==
Ken Kesey, the author of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (pages of which were written all over the restroom wall of his La Honda residence) and other books, owned a home in La Honda, which served as the base of operations for The Merry Pranksters where they used LSD and other drugs. The escapades of Kesey and the Merry Pranksters are documented in Tom Wolfe&#x27;s &quot;The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test&quot;, which describes the wildly painted school bus, &#x27;Furthur&#x27;, driven by Neal Cassady, who had been the hyperkinetic driver in Jack Kerouac&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot;.
The La Honda house where Kesey&#x27;s adventures became famous—one mile (1.6 km) west of Apple Jack&#x27;s Inn—has been faithfully restored after years of neglect and a near-catastrophic flood in 1998.

==Schools==
The town has a single school, &quot;La Honda Elementary&quot;, located within the La Honda-Pescadero Unified School District.

==Festivals==
The town hosts the La Honda Fair &amp; Music Festival every June, and holds an annual Fourth of July picnic at Play Bowl.

<doc id="689448" wikidata="Q4961458" url="?curid=689448" title="Brent Liles">
<text>Brent Harold Liles (September 7, 1963 – January 18, 2007) was an American musician who was the bassist for Social Distortion from 1981–1984 and later was the bassist for Agent Orange from 1988 – 1992.

==Early life==
Liles was born on September 7, 1963, and was an only child. His father died in a plane crash when Brent was 8 years old. He continued to live with his mother and was a standout tennis player at Troy High School in Fullerton, California, and salutatorian of his high school graduating class in 1981. Prior to joining Social Distortion, Liles had seriously considered a career as a professional tennis player. He was also an extra in the movie Bachelor Party.

==Career==
He appeared on Social Distortion&#x27;s 1983 classic debut &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; before leaving the band on New Year&#x27;s Day 1984, with the band&#x27;s drummer Derek O&#x27;Brien. The two would once again be bandmates from 1989 to the early 1990s with Agent Orange. The Palm/Liles/O&#x27;Brien lineup of Agent Orange can be heard on the album &quot;Real Live Sound&quot;. It was Liles who originally came up with the idea of Agent Orange recording their little-known and never released album, &quot;Living in Total Darkness&quot;. This was a re-recording of the songs on their 1981 album &quot;Living in Darkness&quot; with some newer material mixed in. This recording was made on Christmas of 1988, which is somewhat interesting because &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; was coincidentally recorded on Christmas Eve of 1982. Liles also briefly played guitar for the band Easter and Chaotic Stature. Brent also played bass for a band in 1984 to 1986 called The Harlots, who were managed by Monk Rock, Brent&#x27;s manager from his Social Distortion days. The Harlots put out a 12 E.P. around March 1985 which was entitled &quot;Roger Roomper&#x27;s Really Catchy Tunes&quot;.

He also appeared in the 1984 documentary &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;. His songwriting credits include &quot;Mass Hysteria&quot; with Social Distortion and &quot;Broken Dreams&quot; with Agent Orange. during his time with Social Distortion, he was known for playing a Rickenbacker 4001 bass as his primary instrument.

Liles had been out of the musical scene since the mid-1990s, operating a convalescent home in Placentia, California. He died on January 18, 2007, after being hit by a truck while cycling. A Social Distortion benefit concert was held for his family at the Galaxy Theater in Santa Ana, California on March 8, 2007. He is survived by his mother Carol Liles and daughter Maddie Liles.
Liles was the fourth member of Social Distortion to die. Other deceased Social Distortion members include Dennis Danell in 2000 (brain aneurysm), Randy Carr in 2002 (Cushing&#x27;s Syndrome), and original bassist Mark Garrett (unknown cause). Additionally, former producer and organist on Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster Chaz Ramirez died in 1993 after sustaining a broken neck and head injuries in a warehouse fall. With the 2018 death of Charlie Quintana, five members of Social Distortion have died.

<doc id="689451" wikidata="Q531645" url="?curid=689451" title="Parishes of Grenada">
<text>The Caribbean island country of Grenada is divided into regions known as parishes.
A parish defines a territorial unit or region that, historically, was usually an area under the pastoral care served by a local church as an ecclesiastical administrative unit (see Parish) and later used by map-makers to set boundaries to an area of land. Traditionally a settlement or village would centre on a church and later grow to become a town and then even a city. Therefore, a parish has now come to mean an administrative division and is used so by several countries as the smallest unit (or lowest tier) of local government.

The differing size and shape of each parish was primarily influenced by the island&#x27;s earlier history and land that was granted to the first settlers that claimed that territory during the colonial years of the island.

Two decades after Barbados was settled the French governor of Martinique, Jacques Dyel du Parquet, purchased Grenada from a French company and in 1650 established a settlement at what was to be Fort Royal in the parish of the low lands (&quot;Ville Ft. Royal situé à Paroisse de la Basse Terre&quot;). During this time the parish boundaries were laid out.

The French cartographer Jacques-Nicolas Bellin (1703–1772) draw several editions of a chart of the island of Grenada showing the earlier French parish divisions and was published as &quot;Carte de L&#x27;Isle de la Grenade&quot; in Paris 1756.

However, by 1763 the island was under British rule and a later map of the Island of Grenada showing towns and villages and division of the island into quarters in English by cartographer Bryon Edwards (for J. Cooke&#x27;s &quot;History of the West Indies&quot;) was engraved in 1818.

After a century the French capitulated to the British and formally ceded the island to Britain in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris. The English took over the churches and, as was traditional, chapels of ease and local churches were elevated to parish church status across the island, leading to the formation of new parishes surrounding those newly named churches. The six boundaries or borders of these parishes having already been well established in the mindset of the people then living simply took on the names of these churches.

The nation&#x27;s capital St. George&#x27;s, which is located within the parish of Saint George, and even to this day the original parishional border-lines are still well defined.

<text>The Sunday People is a British tabloid Sunday newspaper. It was founded as The People on 16 October 1881.

At one point owned by Odhams Press, The &quot;People&quot; was acquired along with Odhams by the Mirror Group in 1961, along with the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, which eventually became &quot;The Sun&quot;. It switched from broadsheet to tabloid on September 22, 1974. 

The &quot;Sunday People&quot; is now published by Reach plc, and shares a website with the Mirror papers. In July 2011, when it benefited from the closure of the &quot;News of the World&quot;, it had an average Sunday circulation of 806,544. By December 2016 the circulation had shrunk to 239,364 and by August 2020 to 125,216.

== Notable events ==
In March 1951 the &quot;Sunday People&quot; (then known as &quot;The People&quot;) published an article claiming that the British military had allowed Iban mercenaries to collect scalps from human corpses in the ongoing Malayan Emergency war. British colonial officials saw this article as a potential propaganda threat and drew plans to release a rebuttal in the &quot;Straits Times&quot;. The paper&#x27;s claims would later be proven true following the British Malayan headhunting scandal.

==Notable columnists==
*Garry Bushell had a two-page television opinion column, &quot;Bushell on the Box&quot;, but left in early 2007, later moving to the &quot;Daily Star Sunday&quot;.
*Jimmy Greaves, the former England footballer
*Fred Trueman, former England cricketer and fast bowler
*Fred Harrison, an established economics author of 19 books
*Dean Dunham, consumer columnist and leading authority on Consumer protection.

<text>Dance/movement therapy (DMT) in USA and Australia or dance movement psychotherapy (DMP) in the UK is the psychotherapeutic use of movement and dance to support intellectual, emotional, and motor functions of the body. As a modality of the creative arts therapies, DMT looks at the correlation between movement and emotion.

== Efficacy ==

Dance/movement therapy, alone and in conjunction with other forms of therapy, has been shown to be an effective form of treatment for anxiety and anxiety related disorders across age ranges and across a wide population of individuals. Certain studies show that dance movement therapy has been an effective form of anxiety treatment for those with and without intellectual disabilities and musculoskeletal disorders. It has also been shown to be effective at reducing aggression in young children.

There are insufficient high quality trials to assess the effect of DMT on behavioral, social, cognitive and emotional symptoms in people with dementia.

== Principles ==
The theory of DMT is based mainly upon the belief that body and mind interact. Both conscious and unconscious movement of the person, based on the dualist mind body premise, affects total control, and also reflects the individual&#x27;s personality. Therefore, the therapist-client relationship is partly based on non-verbal cues such as body language. Movement is believed to have a symbolic function and as such can aid in understanding the self. Movement improvisation allows the client to experiment with new ways of being and DMT provides a manner or channel in which the client can consciously understand early relationships with negative experiences through non-verbal mediation by the therapist.

By integrating the body, mind, and spirit, DMT aims to foster a sense of wholeness among participants. The body refers to the &quot;discharging of energy through muscular-skeletal responses to stimuli received by the brain.&quot; The mind refers to &quot;mental activities...such as memory, imagery, perception, attention, evaluation, reasoning and decision making.&quot; The spirit refers to the &quot;subjectively experienced feeling of engaging in or empathically observing dancing.&quot;

Dance movement therapy works to improve the social skills, as well as relational dynamics among the clients that choose to participate in it to better improve their quality of life. This therapy seeks to deepen clients&#x27; self-awareness through a meditative process that involves movement, motion, and realization through exploration of one&#x27;s body.

== Methodology ==
DMT/P methodology is fairly heterogenous and practitioners draw on a variety of psychotherapeutic and kinetic principles. Most training in Dance Movement Therapy will have an established theoretical base which they work from – for example Psychodynamic theory, Humanistic psychology, Integrative therapy, Cognitive behavioral therapy, Existential therapy etc. Depending on the approach or combinations of approaches practitioners work from very different processes and aims will be worked towards.

Additionally to the psychotherapeutic basis of their work, different approaches to movement and dance may be employed.

Some dance therapists use codified dance styles, like ballet, folk dance, and contemporary dance. Majority of dance therapists work within a kinetic framework of creative and expressive movement practices, incorporating structured improvisation. 

Commonly requirements of most DMT/P graduate programmes are Movement Analysis and Profiling, human development and Developmental psychology.

Additionally since a variety of populations may be encountered in DMT/P, methods are adapted to meet the needs of the circumstances and clients and this further reduces standardisation.

Bonnie Meekums, a second wave dance therapist, described four stages of the therapy process, based on her experience in the field:

: Preparation: the warm-up stage, a safe space is established without obstacles nor distractions, a supportive relationship with a witness is formed, comfort for participants to be familiar with moving with their eyes closed.

: Incubation: leader verbally prompts participant to go into subconscious, open-ended imagery used to create an internal environment that is catered to the participant, relaxed atmosphere, symbolic movements.

: Illumination: process which is integrated through conscious awareness via dialogue with witness, self-reflection in which the participant uncovers and resolves subconscious motivations, increased self awareness, can have positive and negative effects.

: Evaluation: discuss insights and significance of the process, prepare to end therapy

==The use of props ==
Dance movement therapists frequently use props during sessions to support grounding skills and to increase clients&#x27; awareness of their bodies and personal boundaries. These props might include blankets, sensory balls, weighted blankets, colorful scarves, coloring pencils, and resistance bands. Clients also often can select the type of music they prefer for the session.

== Proposed mechanisms ==
Various hypothesis have been proposed for mechanisms by which dance therapy may benefit participants. There is a social component to dance therapy, which can be valuable for psychological functioning through human interaction. Another possible mechanism is the music that is used during the session, which may be able to reduce pain, decrease anxiety, and increase relaxation. Since dance requires learning and involves becoming active and discovering capacities for movement, there is also the physical training that could provide benefits as well. Dancing may be considered more uplifting and enjoyable than other types of exercise. Dance therapy can also involve nonverbal communication, &quot;which enables participants to express their feelings without words. This might be helpful when normal communication is absent or has broken down (eg, for patients with dementia).&quot;

== Locations ==
DMT is practiced in a large variety of locations. Such locations include:
* Physical medicine
* Rehabilitation centers
* Medical settings
* Education school facilities 
* Nursing Homes
* Day care facilities
* Disease prevention centers
* Health promotion programs
* Hospitals
* Mental health settings
* Private practice

== Organizations ==
Organizations such as the American Dance Therapy Association were created in order to uphold high standards in the field of DMT. Such organizations help connect individuals to therapists and DMT.

=== American Dance Therapy Association ===
American Dance Therapy Association (ADTA) was founded in 1966 in order to uphold high standards throughout dance therapy. The ADTA was created by Marian Chace, the first president of the ADTA, Elissa Queyquep White, Claire Schmais, and other pioneers in dance movement. Along with setting standards for which therapists must attain to become licensed therapists, ADTA keeps an updated registry of all movement/dance therapists who have met ADTA&#x27;s standards. In addition, ADTA also publishes the American Journal of Dance Therapy and sponsors annual professional conferences. According to the ADTA, movement is considered to be a language which allows our body. mind, and spirit to communicate. There are recorded webinars that you can watch at any point in time that can educate and give you more knowledge about the dance therapy field. Along with this, there are also live webinars that you can purchase which allow you to receive a deeper education about how you can use dance therapy in your daily life.

=== Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy, United Kingdom ===
The Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy, United Kingdom (ADMP UK) was one of the first organizations established to regulate the field of dance therapy. ADMP UK accredits therapists and oversees that all regulations are followed. The association actively promotes dance in the UK and other countries, and collaborates with other art therapy organizations. The ADMP UK is providing dance therapy to the community which can be done individually or in group sessions. They use Dance Movement Psychotherapy (DMP), which explains how body movement is a key instrument of expression and communication, throughout these sessions. DMP can support trust within the relationships in your life, the potential for you to physically and spiritually grow within yourself, and the discovery of who you truly are.

=== European Association Dance Movement Therapy ===
The European Association of Dance Movement Therapy is an umbrella association which represents national professional bodies for Dance Movement Therapy in Europe. It represents members in Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain and the UK; with partial members in Austria, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Switzerland, Ukraine and associate members in Croatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Israel, Portugal, Romania and Sweden. Their mission statement is to work extremely hard to continue the development of dance therapy and the legal recognition of this practice. This association aims to exchange ideas and collaborate with other countries about dance therapy.

NVDAT (Nederlandse Vereniging voor Danstherapie-Dutch Dance Movement Therapy Association)
The Nederlandse Vereniging voor Danstherapie supports the interests of dance movement therapists based in The Netherlands.

=== Korean Dance Therapy Association ===
The Korean Dance Therapy Association was established in 1993 by Dr. Ryu Boon Soon as the first dance therapy association in South Korea. It was modeled after the structure of the ADTA and provides education, credentialing, and professional development opportunities to dance therapists in Korea.

American Association of Dance Therapy

ADTA is the main regulator of the required education and training in order to become a dance/movement therapist in the USA. A master&#x27;s degree is required to become a dance/movement therapist. &quot;Registered Dance/Movement Therapist&quot; (R-DMT) is the title given to entry-level dance/movement therapists who have completed requisite education and a minimum 700-hour supervised clinical internship. Those who have completed over 2400 hours of supervised professional clinical work may apply for the advanced credential &quot;Board Certified Dance/Movement Therapist (BC-DMT).

Association for Dance Movement Psychotherapy, United Kingdom

ADMP UK is the main regulator of the required education and training in order to become a dance/movement therapist in the UK. The ADMP is also a member of the European Association Dance Movement Therapy (EADMT). To become a licensed dance/movement therapist, a Master’s Degree in Dance Movement Psychotherapy (DMP) is required. There are three DMP training programs in the UK – at the Goldsmiths University of London, University of Roehampton in London, and University of Derby.

European Association of Dance Movement Therapy

EADMT is the main regulator of the required education and training in order to become a dance/movement therapist in the EU.  DMT training is taught in private and university settings across the EU in countries that include Austria, Estonia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Introductory course training in DMT ranges from 10–120 hours. These hours vary based on country. Full university accreditation courses at the bachelor’s and postgraduate levels range from 2–4 years.

The EADMT training standard criteria were adopted by the EADMT General Assembly in Barcelona, Spain in 2017. These criteria help DMT programs meet best practice and achieve high quality DMT practitioners across Europe.

== Education ==
Typically becoming a dance therapist requires a graduate degree of at least a Master&#x27;s level. There is no specific undergraduate degree, however many practitioners hold undergraduate degrees fields in, or related to, psychology or dance.

All master&#x27;s degrees in the UK and the USA require clinical placements, personal therapy and supervision, as well as experiential and theoretical learning, and typically require between 2 and 3 years to complete. Upon completion of a Masters graduates are eligible to register as Dance Movement Therapists/Psychotherapists with their professional associations. In the UK graduates may also register with the UK Council of Psychotherapists(UKCP).

It is also possible to register as a Dance Movement Therapist/Psychotherapist without a DMT/DMP Masters. This usually requires equilvilant psychotherapeutic training and substantial experience of applying dance into therapeutic settings.

== History ==
The American Dance Therapy Association was founded in 1966 as an organization to support the emerging profession of dance/movement therapy and is the only U.S. organization dedicated to the profession of dance/movement therapy.

Dance has been used therapeutically for thousands of years. It has been used as a healing ritual in the influence of fertility, birth, sickness, and death since early human history. Over the period from 1840 to 1930, a new philosophy of dance developed in Europe and the United States, defined by the idea that movement could have an effect on the mover vis-a-vis that dance was not simply an expressive art. There is a general opinion that Dance/movement as active imagination was originated by Jung in 1916, developed in the 1960s by dance therapy pioneer Mary Starks Whitehouse. Tina Keller-Jenny and other therapists started practicing the therapy in 1940. The actual establishment of dance as a therapy and as a profession occurred in the 1950s, beginning with future American Dance Therapy Association founder Marian Chace.

=== First wave ===
Marian Chace spearheaded the movement of dance in the medical community as a form of therapy. 
She is considered the principal founder of what is now dance therapy in the United States. In 1942, through her work, dance was first introduced to western medicine. Chace was originally a dancer, choreographer, and performer. After opening her own dance school in Washington, D.C., Chace began to realize the effects dance and movement had on her students. The reported feelings of wellbeing from her students began to attract the attention of the medical community, and some local doctors began sending patients to her classes. She was soon asked to work at St. Elizabeth&#x27;s Hospital in Washington, D.C. once psychiatrists too realized the benefits their patients were receiving from attending Chace&#x27;s dance classes. In 1966 Chace became the first president of the American Dance Therapy Association, an organization which she and several other DMT pioneers founded. According to the ADTA, dance is &quot;the psychotherapeutic use of movement as a process which furthers the emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual.&quot;

=== Second wave ===
The second wave of Dance Movement Therapy came around the 1970s to the 1980s and it sparked much interest from American therapists. During this time, therapists began to experiment with the psychotherapeutic applications of dance and movement. As a result of the therapists&#x27; experiments, DMT was then categorized as a form of psychotherapy. It was from this second wave that today&#x27;s Dance Movement Therapy evolved.

<doc id="689470" wikidata="Q17086786" url="?curid=689470" title="Record locking">
<text>Record locking is the technique of preventing simultaneous access to data in a database, to prevent inconsistent results.

The classic example is demonstrated by two bank clerks attempting to update the same bank account for two different transactions. Clerks 1 and 2 both retrieve (i.e., copy) the account&#x27;s record. Clerk 1 applies and saves a transaction. Clerk 2 applies a different transaction to his saved copy, and saves the result, based on the original record and his changes, overwriting the transaction entered by clerk 1. The record no longer reflects the first transaction, as if it had never taken place.

A simple way to prevent this is to lock the file whenever a record is being modified by any user, so that no other user can save data. This prevents records from being overwritten incorrectly, but allows only one record to be processed at a time, locking out other users who need to edit records at the same time.

To allow several users to edit a database table at the same time and also prevent inconsistencies created by unrestricted access, a single record can be &quot;locked&quot; when retrieved for editing or updating. Anyone attempting to retrieve the same record for editing is denied write access because of the lock (although, depending on the implementation, they may be able to view the record without editing it). Once the record is saved or edits are canceled, the lock is released. Records can never be saved so as to overwrite other changes, preserving data integrity.

In database management theory, locking is used to implement &quot;isolation&quot; among multiple database users. This is the &quot;I&quot; in the acronym ACID.

A thorough and authoritative description of locking was written by Jim Gray.

==Granularity of locks==
If the bank clerks (to follow the illustration above) are serving two customers, but their accounts are contained in one ledger, then the entire ledger, or one or more database tables, would need to be made available for editing to the clerks in order for each to complete a transaction, one at a time (file locking). While safe, this method can cause unnecessary waiting.

If the clerks can remove one page from the ledger, containing the account of the current customer (plus several other accounts), then multiple customers can be serviced concurrently, provided that each customer&#x27;s account is found on a different page than the others. If two customers have accounts on the same page, then only one may be serviced at a time. This is analogous to a &quot;page level lock&quot; in a database.

A higher degree of granularity is achieved if each individual account may be taken by a clerk. This would allow any customer to be serviced without waiting for another customer who is accessing a different account. This is analogous to a &quot;record level lock&quot; and is normally the highest degree of locking granularity in a database management system.

In a SQL database, a record is typically called a &quot;row&quot;.

The introduction of granular (subset) locks creates the possibility for a situation called deadlock. Deadlock is possible when &quot;incremental locking&quot; (locking one entity, then locking one or more additional entities) is used. To illustrate, if two bank customers asked two clerks to obtain their account information so they could transfer some money into other accounts, the two accounts would essentially be locked. Then, if the customers told their clerks that the money was to be transferred into each other&#x27;s accounts, the clerks would search for the other accounts but find them to be &quot;in use&quot; and wait for them to be returned. Unknowingly, the two clerks are waiting for each other, and neither of them can complete their transaction until the other gives up and returns the account. Various techniques are used to avoid such problems.

==Use of locks==
Record locks need to be managed between the entities requesting the records such that no entity is given too much service via successive grants, and no other entity is effectively locked out. The entities that request a lock can be either individual applications (programs) or an entire processor.

The application or system should be designed such that any lock is held for the shortest time possible. Data reading, without editing facilities, does not require a lock, and reading locked records is usually permissible.

Two main types of locks can be requested:

===Exclusive locks===
Exclusive locks are exclusively held by a single entity, usually for the purpose of writing to the record. If the locking schema was represented by a list, the holder list would contain only one entry. Since this type of lock effectively blocks any other entity that requires the lock from processing, care must be used to:
*ensure the lock is held for the shortest time possible;
*not hold the lock across system or function calls where the entity is no longer running on the processor – this can lead to deadlock;
*ensure that if the entity is unexpectedly exited for any reason, the lock is freed.

Non-holders of the lock (a.k.a. waiters) can be held in a list that is serviced in a round-robin fashion, or in a FIFO queue. This would ensure that any possible waiter would get equal chance to obtain the lock and not be locked out. To further speed up the process, if an entity has gone to sleep waiting for a lock, performance is improved if the entity is notified of the grant, instead of discovering it on some sort of system timeout driven wake-up.

===Shared locks===
Shared locks differ from exclusive locks in that the holder list can contain multiple entries. Shared locks allow all holders to read the contents of the record knowing that the record cannot be changed until after the lock has been released by all holders. Exclusive locks cannot be obtained when a record is already locked (exclusively or shared) by another entity.

If lock requests for the same entity are queued, then once a shared lock is granted, any queued shared locks may also be granted. If an exclusive lock is found next on the queue, it must wait until all shared locks have been released. As with exclusive locks, these shared locks should be held for the least time possible.

<text>Provinces (; ) are the first level administrative divisions of Sri Lanka. Currently, Sri Lanka is divided into 9 provinces. Each province is further divided into districts, which are further divided into divisional secretariats.

The provinces were first established by the British rulers of Ceylon in 1833. Over the next century, most of the administrative functions of the provinces were transferred to the districts, the second level administrative division of the country. By the middle of the 20th century, the provinces had become mostly ceremonial. This changed in 1987 when, following several decades of increasing demand for decentralization, the 13th Amendment to the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka established provincial councils.

==History==
===Anuradhapura Kingdom===
In the Kingdom of Anuradhapura, Rajarata was the personal domain of the King. It was further divided in to four districts (Desa): Dakkina, Pachhima, Uttara and Pacina Desa.

===British Ceylon===
After the British took control of the entire island of Ceylon in 1815, it was divided into three ethnic-based administrative structures: Low Country Sinhalese, Kandyan Sinhalese and Tamil. In 1829, the British established the Colebrooke–Cameron Commission to review the colonial government of Ceylon, including its administrative structures. The commission recommended that the existing three ethnic based administrations be unified into a single administration divided into five geographic provinces. Accordingly, on 1 October 1833, five provinces under one administration came into being:

* Central Province – composed of the central Kandyan provinces.
* Eastern Province – composed of the maritime districts of Batticaloa and Trincomalee, and the Kandyan provinces of Bintenna and Tamankaduwa.
* Northern Province – composed of the maritime districts of Jaffna, Mannar and Vanni, and the Kandyan province of Nuwara Kalawiya.
* Southern Province – composed of the maritime districts of Galle, Hambantota, Matara and Tangalle, and the Kandyan provinces of Lower Uva, Saffragam and Wellassa.
* Western Province – composed of the maritime districts of Colombo, Chilaw and Puttalam, and the Kandyan provinces of Three Korales, Four Korales, Seven Korales and Lower Bulathgama.

Over the next fifty years, four additional provinces were created, bringing the total number up to nine:
* North Western Province – created in 1845 from northern parts of the Western Province (districts of Chilaw, Puttalam and Seven Korales).
* North Central Province – created in 1873 from southern parts of the Northern Province (district of Nuwara Kalawiya) and north western parts of the Eastern Province (district of Tamankaduwa).
* Uva Province – created in 1886 from parts of the Central Province, Eastern Province (district of Bintenna) and Southern Province (district of Wellassa).
* Sabaragamuwa Province – created in 1889.

===Sri Lanka===

The number of provinces remained static until September 1988 when, in accordance with the Indo-Lanka Accord, President J. R. Jayewardene issued proclamations enabling the Northern and Eastern provinces to be one administrative unit administered by one elected council, creating the North Eastern Province. The proclamations were only meant to be a temporary measure until a referendum was held in the Eastern Province on a permanent merger between the two provinces. However, the referendum was never held and successive Sri Lankan presidents issued proclamations annually extending the life of the &quot;temporary&quot; entity.

The merger was controversial and bitterly opposed by Sinhalese-speaking people, in particular. On 14 July 2006, after a long campaign against the merger, the JVP filed three separate petitions with the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka requesting a separate Provincial Council for the East. On 16 October 2006, the Supreme Court ruled that the proclamations issued by President Jayewardene were null and void and had no legal effect. The North Eastern Province was formally de-merged into the Northern and Eastern provinces on 1 January 2007.

Sri Lanka currently has nine provinces, seven of which have had provincial councils from the start.

<text>Bly is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Klamath County, Oregon, United States. By highway, it is about east of Klamath Falls. , the population was 207.

==Geography==
Bly is in southeastern Klamath County, slightly west of Lake County, along Oregon Route 140. By highway, it is about west of Lakeview and east of Klamath Falls.

Fish Hole Creek, which flows through the community, meets the South Fork Sprague River slightly north of Bly. Fremont National Forest surrounds Bly except on the northwest. Gearhart Mountain Wilderness is about northeast of Bly.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Bly has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

== History ==
The name &quot;Bly&quot; comes from the Klamath word &quot;p&#x27;lai&quot;, meaning &#x27;up&#x27; or &#x27;high&#x27;, referring to its location at the upper Sprague River. The Sprague River post office was established in the area in 1873, and the name was changed to Bly in 1883. At that time, the community was near the east end of the Klamath Indian Reservation. The 21st century community of Sprague River is downstream and west of Bly and Beatty.

Around 1900, Bly had two general stores, two hotels, and a saloon. A history published in 1905 referred to the surrounding area as the &quot;precinct&quot; or the &quot;valley&quot; and estimated its total population at 750. The chief products of the valley at that time included cattle, horses, mules, and a few sheep, as well as oats, clover, and hay.

In 1935, the United States Forest Service acquired a site in Bly for a district ranger station to manage the western part of the Fremont National Forest. The Forest Service paid $625 () for the property. The ranger station was built by Civilian Conservation Corps workers under the supervision of Forest Service district ranger Perry Smith. The seven original buildings at the Bly Ranger Station were constructed between 1936 and 1942. A modern administrative headquarters building was added to the compound in the 1960s. The ranger station compound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.

===World War II===
Bly is also the site of the only fatalities of World War II in the continental U.S. due to an enemy balloon bomb attack. On May 5, 1945, a Japanese balloon bomb exploded as it was being pulled from the woods by curious picnickers. Killed in the explosion were: Elsie Mitchell, 26, wife of minister Archie E. Mitchell; Edward Engen, 13; Richard Patzke, 14; Jay Gifford, 13; Sherman Shoemaker, 11; and Joan Patzke, 13. Rev. Mitchell heard the explosion and discovered the bodies. The victims&#x27; families were compensated by the government. A memorial was erected at what today is called the Mitchell Recreation Area.

==Parks and recreation==
The OC&amp;E Woods Line State Trail, the longest linear state park in Oregon, passes through Bly. The rail trail was built on the roadbeds of the former Oregon, California and Eastern Railway, which ran from Klamath Falls to Bly, and a former spur line, the Woods Line.

John Buckingham, an introverted, lonely St Albans bank clerk, orders a mail-order bride Nadia from Russia on the Internet. John is uncomfortable and shy, but Nadia is sexually bold.

Although Nadia cannot speak English and John cannot speak Russian, they soon bond. Later on, a man she introduces as her cousin Yuri and his friend Alexei turn up to celebrate her birthday. Alexei soon shows that he has a temper.

After a violent altercation, Alexei holds Nadia hostage and demands a ransom from John. As he has grown to care for Nadia, he is forced to steal from the bank where he has worked for ten years. After the ransom is paid, he realises that he has been the victim of an elaborate con. Nadia, Yuri, and Alexei are criminals, and Alexei is actually Nadia&#x27;s boyfriend.

The trio have carried out the same scam on men from Switzerland, Greece, and Germany. They take John prisoner, strip him down to his underpants, and tie him to a toilet in a motel. He eventually frees himself and quickly learns that Nadia has been left behind after Alexei discovers she is pregnant. John gets dressed and subsequently fights with her, who later reveals that she can indeed speak English and that her name is not Nadia.

John takes Nadia to turn her into the police, hoping to clear his name as a wanted bank robber. Ultimately, however, he sympathises with her and decides against it. He leaves her at the airport, where she is kidnapped by Alexei, who now wants Nadia to have the baby. John rescues her, tying Alexei to a chair. They work together against the two Russian men. Nadia tells John that her real name is Sophia. John, disguised as Alexei, leaves for Russia with her.

== Release ==

===Box office===
The film grossed $16,171,098.

===Critical reception===
It has a 59% approval on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5.72/10, indicating a mixed critical reception. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Kidman shows her range in this quirky movie, but the shift in tone from romantic comedy to thriller may leave viewers unsatisfied.&quot;

Jason Solomon of &quot;The Observer&quot; praised the casting &quot;Cassel, Kassovitz and Kidman are beautifully graceful against the backdrop of signs to Tring and Newbury.&quot; He continued &quot;The comedy here is gentle, formed of linguistic misunderstandings and cultural clashes and Chaplin&#x27;s constant efforts to be polite are rather charming. Kidman&#x27;s exoticism, encapsulated by her peasant-chic wardrobe, is fresh air in St Albans.&quot;

BBC reviewer Matt Arnoldi gave the film four out of five stars, praised Chaplin&#x27;s and Kidman&#x27;s &quot;infectious performances&quot;, and described it as a &quot;sparky&quot; and &quot;deviant topical comedy which is funny from start to finish.&quot;

CNN praised Kidman&#x27;s &quot;astounding range&quot; and applauded the dialogue as &quot;often sharp, scathingly witty, and displays a wry intelligence.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described the film as &quot;competent&quot; but decried the plot as too &quot;insubstantial&quot;.

<text>Sex hormones, also known as sex steroids, gonadocorticoids and gonadal steroids, are steroid hormones that interact with vertebrate steroid hormone receptors. The sex hormones include the androgens, estrogens, and progestogens. Their effects are mediated by slow genomic mechanisms through nuclear receptors as well as by fast nongenomic mechanisms through membrane-associated receptors and signaling cascades. Certain polypeptide hormones including the luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone – each associated with the gonadotropin axis – are usually not regarded as sex hormones, although they play major sex-related roles.

==Production==
Natural sex hormones are made by the gonads (ovaries or testicles), by adrenal glands, or by conversion from other sex steroids in other tissue such as liver or fat.



==Types==
In many contexts, the two main classes of sex hormones are androgens and estrogens, of which the most important human derivatives are testosterone and estradiol, respectively. Other contexts will include progestogens as a third class of sex steroids, distinct from androgens and estrogens. Progesterone is the most important and only naturally occurring human progestogen. In general, androgens are considered &quot;male sex hormones&quot;, since they have masculinizing effects, while estrogens and progestogens are considered &quot;female sex hormones&quot; although all types are present in each sex at different levels.

Sex hormones include:
* Progestogens
** Pregnenolone → Progesterone → Allopregnanedione → Allopregnanolone
** 17α-Hydroxypregnenolone → 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone
* Androgens
** Dehydroepiandrosterone → Androstenedione → Androstanedione → Androsterone
** Androstenediol → Testosterone → Dihydrotestosterone → Androstanediol
* Estrogens
** 2-Hydroxyestrone ← Estrone → 16α-Hydroxyestrone
** 2-Hydroxyestradiol ← Estradiol → Estriol → Estetrol

==Synthetic sex steroids==
There are also many synthetic sex steroids. Synthetic androgens are often referred to as anabolic steroids. Synthetic estrogens and progestins are used in methods of hormonal contraception. Ethinylestradiol is an example of a semi-synthetic estrogen. Specific compounds that have partial agonist activity for steroid receptors may require treatment by a steroid in one cell type, and, therefore, act like natural steroid hormones. These compounds are used in certain medical conditions. Some systemic effects of a particular steroid in the entire organism are only desirable within certain limits.

<doc id="689493" wikidata="Q239663" url="?curid=689493" title="FK Sarajevo">
<text>Fudbalski klub Sarajevo (; , English: Sarajevo Football Club), is a professional football club based in Sarajevo, the capital city of Bosnia and Herzegovina and is one of the most successful clubs in the country.

Founded on 24 October 1946, FK Sarajevo was the most successful club from SR Bosnia and Herzegovina in the former SFR Yugoslavia, winning two Yugoslav First League titles, finishing runners-up on two other occasions, reaching the Yugoslav Cup final twice and placing 6th in the Yugoslav First League all-time table.

Today, FK Sarajevo is one of the most prominent members of the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina, where it has won five Bosnian championships, seven Bosnian Cups and one Bosnian Supercup. Furthermore, the club finished runners-up in the national championship another seven times. It is ranked first in the Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina all-time table and is the country&#x27;s most prominent representative in European competitions. FK Sarajevo is the most popular football club in the country, along with FK Željezničar, with whom it shares a strong rivalry that manifests itself in the Sarajevo derby, also known as the &quot;Eternal derby&quot; (Bosnian: Vječiti derbi).

The club plays its home matches at the Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium, named after legendary club striker Asim Ferhatović. The stadium has a capacity of 34,500, and is the largest in the country. The traditional colours of the club are maroon and white.

==History==

FK Sarajevo was the only major football club founded by the post-war Yugoslav authorities in the city of Sarajevo. The club entered the Yugoslav First League in the 1948–49 season, and eventually competed in all but two seasons in the top tier. After Bosnia and Herzegovina gained independence from Yugoslavia, FK Sarajevo became one of the country&#x27;s biggest ambassadors, departing on a large world tour during the Bosnian War with the goal of gaining international support for the country&#x27;s cause.

===Origins===
FK Sarajevo was established on 24 October 1946, at a meeting held in the main hall of the DTV Partizan building (popularly known as &quot;Fis&quot;), as the result of a merger between local Sarajevo football clubs &quot;Udarnik&quot; (Vanguard) and &quot;Sloboda&quot; (Liberty). The club first appeared on the Yugoslav sports scene in 1946 under the name Fiskulturno društvo Torpedo (English: Gymnastics Society Torpedo), a homage to Torpedo Moscow. The first chairman of the newly founded club was Safet Džinović, while the positions of vice-chairmen were granted to Vojo Marković and Alojz Stanarević respectively. Furthermore, Josip Bulat was named manager. 
On 5 October 1947, on the proposal of then-editor-in-chief of the popular daily newspaper &quot;Oslobođenje&quot;, Mirko Ostojić, the club name was changed to Fiskulturno društvo Sarajevo (English: Gymnastics Society Sarajevo), before being changed yet again to Sportsko društvo metalaca Sarajevo (English: Sports Association of Metalworkers Sarajevo) a year later. Finally, on 20 May 1949 the name Fudbalski klub Sarajevo was adopted. The newly formed team, which inherited the results and league standings of Udarnik, was joined by selected players from both Udarnik and Sloboda. Namely, Hodžić, Vlajičić, Šarenkapa, Pauković, Fizović, Konjević, Radović, Viđen and Mustagrudić from the former, and Mantula, Glavočević, Tošić, Pecelj, Novo, Strinić, Đ. Lovrić and Alajbegović from the latter. The team played its first match on 3 November 1946. In September 1948 SDM Sarajevo was joined by Yugoslav footballing legend Miroslav Brozović, who brought in a largely needed level of experience to the new team. The Mostar native previously wore the black and white jersey of FK Partizan, as well as captaining the Yugoslavia national team. Brozović was offered the position of player-manager which he accepted, turning his attention to promoting the team to the Yugoslav First League. FK Sarajevo first entered the top-flight Yugoslav First League after eliminating Belgrade club Sloga. They drew the first match 3:3 in Novi Sad, but then won the second match 5:1 in Sarajevo. The team was relegated after its first season in the First League but was promoted back to the top tier in 1950. From then on FK Sarajevo played in every season of the First League apart from 1957 to 1958. The club&#x27;s first taste of European competitions began during the 1960s when it took part in the 1960 Mitropa Cup and the 1961–63 Balkans Cup, while the first continent-wide European competition the club took part in was the 1962–63 Intertoto Cup.

===Champions of Yugoslavia - Bosnian breakthrough===
Until FK Sarajevo&#x27;s historic triumph, no club from any republic outside of SR Serbia and SR Croatia had ever claimed the Yugoslav First League title. The league had long been dominated by the so-called &quot;Big Four&quot; of Yugoslav football, but the Bosnian breakthrough finally arrived in the 1966–67 season, when FK Sarajevo emerged as champions. This victory not only marked a significant milestone for Bosnian football but also ended an unprecedented eight-season dominance by clubs from SR Serbia, who had held the national crown uninterrupted.

====The 1960s: First championship====

A key player for Sarajevo in their early years was the legendary striker Asim Ferhatović, known as Hase, who played for the club from 1952 to 1967. In the 1963–64 season, he was the top scorer in the First League with nineteen goals,&lt;ref name=&quot;1963/64: Asim Ferhatović (19 goals)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; leading the club to a fourth-place finish. The following year, Sarajevo finished second to Partizan Belgrade. In the 1966–67 season, Sarajevo won their first Yugoslav First League title, becoming the first national champions from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The historic season began with Brozović as head coach, and the team had a strong start with consecutive wins against Sutjeska Nikšić and city rivals Željezničar, followed by a draw against European Cup runners-up Partizan. Despite an early lead, Sarajevo managed seven points from their first three fixtures and, though not initially considered title favorites, they gained momentum with a victory against Hajduk Split on the Dalmatian coast. Four days later, Sarajevo defeated Olimpija 2–1 at a sold-out Koševo Stadium. Hard-fought wins against Rijeka and Red Star Belgrade followed, and by the winter break, Sarajevo had won 14 of their first 20 league matches, finishing the year in first place.

The second part of the season opened with a 1–0 away win against Dinamo Zagreb in the last sixteen of the Yugoslav Cup, thanks to a stunning goal by Boško Antić. Although Sarajevo advanced past Napredak in the quarterfinals, they eventually lost in the Cup final to Hajduk Split at the Stari plac Stadium on May 24. The team quickly rebounded, defeating Red Star 3–1 at the Rajko Mitić Stadium, with two goals from Antić and one from Prodanović. A week later, they beat OFK Beograd by the same margin, but a surprising defeat to Vojvodina in Novi Sad left them tied with Dinamo Zagreb with three games remaining. Sarajevo then defeated Vardar with a Musemić brace, while Dinamo dropped points in Rijeka. In the final league match of the season, Sarajevo hosted Čelik Zenica in front of 30,000 spectators and won 5–2, securing the club&#x27;s first league title.

=====The Last 16 of the European Cup=====

The league triumph qualified Sarajevo to the 1967–68 European Cup (today&#x27;s UEFA Champions League), where they played their first tie against Cypriots Olympiakos Nicosia, winning 5:3 on aggregate. In the second round (one round short of the quarter-finals), Sarajevo was knocked out 2:1 on aggregate by eventual champions Manchester United of England, despite hosting a goalless draw in the first leg. The first leg was played before an audience of 40,000 spectators and refereed by the Italian Francesco Francescon. The second leg played at Old Trafford ended in controversy after the ball went out of bounds prior to the hosts scoring their second goal. Notable Sarajevo players during this era included Boško Antić, Mirsad Fazlagić, Vahidin Musemić, Fahrudin Prljača and Boško Prodanović.

Shortly after winning its first Yugoslav league title FK Sarajevo endured a period of general stagnation. The team entered the 1967/68 season as strong title favorites, but the campaign turned out to be a complete disaster. The maroon-whites, managed by former player Franjo Lovrić, did not manage to enter the championship race in hopes of defending the title, finishing mere 7th. The club management quickly named Munib Saračević manager for the 1968/69 season, but this move also turned out to be fruitless. The team concluded the disappointing campaign 11th in the league standings. In the January 1971 transfer window, six members of the championship-winning generation, including Prodanović, Tešan, and Prljača, left the club. Three more players, including star player Boško Antić, departed in July of the same year. Despite a promising start to the next season, where the team led at the winter break, they only managed to finish 7th by the end of the season. The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of several new players, including future club legend Želimir Vidović and former Red Star Belgrade and Bayern Munich striker Dušan Jovanović. Additionally, 18-year-old Safet Sušić joined from Krivaja Zavidovići and would soon become a key player, driving the club to a second significant era of success in Yugoslav football. It&#x27;s important to note that in the first eleven seasons following their 1967 title win, FK Sarajevo&#x27;s best achievements were a single 6th place league finish, two 7th place league finishes, and a quarter-final appearance in the Yugoslav Cup during the 1976–77 season. In the same year, the club narrowly avoided relegation, finishing just two points ahead of Napredak Kruševac. However, the 1978–79 season brought renewed hope for Sarajevo fans as the team finished 4th, behind Hajduk Split, Dinamo Zagreb, and Red Star Belgrade, signaling better times ahead.

====The 1980s: Second championship====

Sarajevo enjoyed a second successful period between 1978 and 1985, driven by the dynamic attacking duo of Predrag Pašić and Safet Sušić. This pair became one of the most prolific tandems in Yugoslav and Bosnian football history. Predrag Pašić, nicknamed &quot;Paja,&quot; was a winger or striker who rose through the club&#x27;s youth ranks and played for Sarajevo until his move to VfB Stuttgart after the title-winning season in 1985. Safet Sušić, known as &quot;Pape,&quot; was a playmaker and attacking midfielder who donned the maroon and white jersey from 1973 until his transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 1982. In the 1978–79 season, Sušić scored 15 goals and was named Player of the Season as Sarajevo finished fourth. The following year, his 17 goals not only retained his Player of the Year title but also made him the joint-top scorer in the league.

In the 1979–80 season, Sarajevo finished as runners-up, seven points behind Red Star Belgrade, therefore qualifying for the 1980–81 UEFA Cup. Sarajevo was knocked out in the first round by German powerhouse Hamburger SV, which won 7:5 on aggregate. Sarajevo returned to the UEFA Cup in 1982–83 (having finished fourth during the 1981–82 season), beating Bulgaria&#x27;s Slavia Sofia 6:4 in the first round and Romanian club FC Corvinul Hunedoara 8:4 in the second, thanks to a 4:0 home win in the second leg. In the third round (last 16), Sarajevo lost the first leg 6:1 to Belgian club RSC Anderlecht, and despite winning the second leg 1:0, were eliminated by the eventual champions. Sarajevo also reached the Yugoslav Cup final that season, losing 3:2 to Dinamo Zagreb in Belgrade. Sarajevo secured their second championship title in the 1984–85 season, finishing four points ahead of runners-up Hajduk Split.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFRYugoslavia First League 1984/85&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The new championship season for Sarajevo didn&#x27;t start spectacularly, but as it progressed, the team gained momentum and secured first place by the winter break.
Boško Antić&#x27;s team struggled at the beginning of the second half of the season, earning only two points from their first three matches. TTheir main rival, Hajduk Split, also had a slow start, winning just one of their first three games, which allowed Sarajevo to maintain a one-point lead. Antić&#x27;s squad then defeated Sloboda and drew with Dinamo Zagreb and Željezničar before traveling to Split for a crucial match against Hajduk. A packed Poljud Stadium saw a 0–0 draw, preserving Sarajevo&#x27;s narrow lead.

The title race ultimately came down to Sarajevo and Hajduk Split, with both teams securing hard-fought victories. Three games before the season&#x27;s end, Hajduk had a straightforward win over Rijeka, while Sarajevo faced a tough match in Novi Sad against Vojvodina. The hosts scored early, but Sarajevo equalized ten minutes before the break through a Jakovljević goal and eventually won seven minutes from time with a stunning volley from Slaviša Vukićević.

Now needing just five points from their last three games to clinch the title, Sarajevo achieved a routine 3–0 victory over Iskra, followed by a challenging 2–2 draw against Vardar in Skopje, after coming back from a 2–0 deficit just before halftime. Everything hinged on the final league game against Red Star Belgrade at a sold-out Koševo Stadium, where Sarajevo needed just a point to secure the title. Musemić opened the scoring in the 23rd minute, and Jakovljević doubled the lead with fifteen minutes remaining. Although Boško Gjurovski pulled one back for the visitors in the 85th minute, it was too late to change the outcome. The celebrations began, Sarajevo had won its second Yugoslav league title. The triumph qualified the club for the first round of the 1985–86 European Cup, where they shockingly lost both legs to Finnish side Kuusysi Lahti. This result is still considered Sarajevo&#x27;s worst in major European competitions.

The championship winning generation included the likes of Husref Musemić, Faruk Hadžibegić, Davor Jozić, Dragan Jakovljević, Miloš Đurković, Predrag Pašić, Mirza Kapetanović, Slaviša Vukićević, Zijad Švrakić, Senad Merdanović and Mehmed Janjoš.

=====Final years in Yugoslavia=====
FK Sarajevo entered a turbulent period after clinching its second Yugoslav league title. Three major members of the championship-winning squad left the team in the summer of 1985. Star striker Husref Musemić joined Red Star Belgrade. Faruk Hadžibegić moved to Spanish side Real Betis. Team captain Predrag Pašić moved to VfB Stuttgart in the Bundesliga. The club management, in search of replacements, turned its sights to young players from lower-tier sides, bringing in Bernard Barnjak, Vladimir Petković and Zoran Ljubičić. Even though the team started the season on a high note, it finished a disappointing 15th at the end of the 1985/86 season, avoiding relegation by virtue of a superior goal difference compared to relegated OFK Beograd. The following season again culminated in a lowly finish, as new manager Denijel Pirić led the team to a disappointing 13th place in the league standings. Further departures followed at the end of the season as Miloš Đurković joined Beşiktaş, Muhidin Teskeredžić made the move to Sturm Graz, Davor Jozić joined Serie A side A.C. Cesena, Zijad Švrakić transferred to Adana Demirspor and Branko Bošnjak joined NK Olimpija. The following two seasons again brought mediocre league finishes as the maroon-whites concluded the respective campaigns on 13th and 14th spots, barely avoiding relegation on both occasions. As with previous seasons, a handful of players left the club during the summer transfer window, with Slaviša Vukićević moving to Créteil, goalkeeper Enver Lugušić joining Konyaspor and Dragan Jakovljević moving to FC Nantes. On a positive note, the 1989/90 season brought the return of fan-favorite Husref Musemić, who had spent the previous season playing for Scottish side Hearts. His nine goals in 26 appearances did little to improve league results, as the team again concluded the campaign in 13th spot, along with an early exit in the Yugoslav Cup after a defeat to Macedonian third division minnows, FK Sileks. The 1990/91 season saw Fuad Muzurović again being named manager after a ten-year absence. Furthermore, Soviet goalkeeper Aleksei Prudnikov was brought in from Velež Mostar, thus becoming the first foreign player in the history of the club. The team was able to conclude the season in 11th spot, defeating Red Star Belgrade in a crucial, hallmark game, only days after the Belgrade outfit won the European Cup. The 1991/92 season was marked by the disintegration of Yugoslavia, and was subsequently abandoned by Slovenian, Croatian and Bosnian sides. Football was abruptly halted in Bosnia and Herzegovina for the duration of the war that would last for four years. Notable FK Sarajevo players in the pre-war period were Miloš Nedić, Dragan Jakovljević, Boban Božović, Dane Kuprešanin and Dejan Raičković.

===Recent years===
Since the Bosnian independence, the club has won 11 domestic titles, 5 of which were Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina honors. In addition the club reached play-off stage/final qualifying round for European competitions on 4 occasions, once for UCL (vs Dynamo Kyiv) and three for UEL (vs CFR Cluj, Borussia Mönchengladbach and Celtic).

====War and independence====
The Bosnian War in the early 1990s shut down competitive football in the territory, and as a result FK Sarajevo became a touring club in 1993, under manager Fuad Muzurović, featuring players such as Elvir Baljić, Almir Turković, Senad Repuh and Mirza Varešanović, all future national team players for Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many of the club&#x27;s supporters, including the infamous Horde Zla joined the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and fought in the war. FK Sarajevo played a number of friendly games during this time, such as the now-famous 4–1 victory over the local UN peacekeeping force in 1994, a 1–1 draw against Parma F.C. while on tour in Italy, and a 3–1 victory over the Iranian national team in Teheran.

In 1994–95, the first-ever Bosnia and Herzegovina championship was held. Sarajevo came first in their six-team league in Jablanica, and came runners-up in the final league stage in Zenica, behind local club Čelik. Sarajevo again finished as runners-up to Čelik in 1996–97 (by two points),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosnia-Hercegovina &#x27;Muslim&#x27; championship 1996/97&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but beat the Zenica-based club in the Cup final and Super Cup. The Cup was retained the following year, and despite finishing third in the league, Sarajevo was runner-up due to play-offs. There was no play-off in 1998–99; the title was given to Sarajevo but it does not count.

In 2004, Safet Sušić, who played at FK Sarajevo from 1973 to 1982, was voted Bosnia and Herzegovina&#x27;s best player of the last 50 years at the UEFA Jubilee Awards.
Sarajevo were runners-up in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Premier League in 2006–07, but won their second title the following season, beating Zrinjski Mostar by three points. Sarajevo have been a regular in Europa League qualification in the 21st century, but are yet to make the group stages. Off the back of their 2006–07 league title under manager Husref Musemić, Sarajevo played in the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its current format. They beat Maltese champions Marsaxlokk F.C. 6:0 away in their first game, eventually winning 9:1 on aggregate. The second round saw Sarajevo defeat Belgians KRC Genk on away goals due to a 2:1 away win in the first leg, although the club was knocked out in the play-offs for the competition&#x27;s Group stage by Ukrainian champions Dynamo Kyiv who won 4:0 on aggregate. The club made the play-offs round of the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League and faced CFR Cluj but lost 3–2 on aggregate. The team defeated Spartak Trnava and Helsingborg to get to the playoff round.

====Vincent Tan era - a financial injection====

Vincent Tan, a Malaysian businessman and the owner of the Championship club Cardiff City, bought FK Sarajevo in late 2013 pledging to invest $2 million into the club. Under the deal, Cardiff will cooperate with FK Sarajevo, exchanging players and taking part in a football academy, yet to be established, which Tan has said would lure new talents. Under Tan&#x27;s management the club brought in quality players with the likes of Miloš Stojčev, Džemal Berberović and Nemanja Bilbija who helped the club win the 2013–14 Bosnian Cup, their first silverware since winning the Premier League in 2006–07. Prior to the Cup triumph, Robert Jarni was brought in as the new manager of the club in December 2013 by Tan, but was quickly dismissed only 4 months into his tenure (on 7 April 2014, while the team was still in the semi-finals of the Bosnian Cup) due to the team failing to keep its chances of winning the domestic league title alive during later stages of the 2013–14 season. FK Sarajevo played a friendly match against Tan&#x27;s Cardiff City FC U21 winning 4–1. In 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, FK Sarajevo eliminated FK Haugesund and Atromitos to qualify for the play-off round, where it lost to German side Borussia Mönchengladbach. On 17 July 2014, Tan presented pledges of assistance of €255,000 each to two hospitals in Doboj and Maglaj during the halftime break of the UEFA Europa League qualifying match between Sarajevo and Norwegian club Haugesund at the Olympic Stadium in Sarajevo. The money raised would be used to purchase and donate much-needed medical equipment for the two hospitals. In June 2014, Tan made a personal donation of €114,000, while the people of Malaysia raised a total of €169,000 toward Bosnia&#x27;s flood relief fund. In May 2014, the heaviest rains and floods in 120 years hit Bosnia and the surrounding region. The worst affected areas were the towns of Doboj and Maglaj, which were cut off from the rest of the country when floods deluged all major roads. Damage from landslides and floods was estimated to run into hundreds of millions of euros and twenty-four people lost their lives. The cost of the disaster, an official said, could exceed that of the Bosnian War. On 5 August 2014, Sarajevo signed a cooperation agreement with third-tier Bosnian club NK Bosna Visoko, by which Sarajevo will loan its talented youngsters to the Visoko-based side and will have first-buy rights on all of Bosna players. The agreement was signed by Adis Hajlovac and Mirza Laletović on behalf of Bosna, and Abdulah Ibraković on behalf of Sarajevo. The agreement &quot;de facto&quot; names Bosna the club&#x27;s farm team. On 26 September 2014, manager Dženan Uščuplić was relieved of his duties as first-team manager and was transferred back to the youth academy. On 30 September 2014, former Barcelona, Real Sociedad and Bosnia and Herzegovina national team striker Meho Kodro was appointed manager. On 24 February 2015, Sarajevo signed a three-and-a-half-year general sponsorship agreement with Turkish Airlines which has been labeled the most lucrative in Bosnian professional sports history. On 21 April, after poor league results, the club sacked Kodro and once again named Dženan Uščuplić manager until the end of the season. On 30 May the team defeated Sloboda Tuzla in the season&#x27;s last fixture, thus winning the league title after an eight-year drought. The next season was a turbulent one for the club. After Uščuplić left his post, former Partizan and CSKA Sofia manager Miodrag Ješić took over the helm, only to be sacked after a string of disappointing results, with Almir Hurtić leading the side to a disappointing 4th-place finish in the league. On 29 August 2016, after another string of bad results at the start of the 2016–17 season, Hurtić was sacked and Mehmed Janjoš was named manager.

====Club&#x27;s domestic revival====
Since March 2019, FK Sarajevo is run by Vietnamese businessman Nguyễn Hoài Nam and the PVF Investment and Trading, JSC &quot;(Promotion Fund of Vietnamese Football Talents F.C.)&quot;.

The club has won back to back titles in Bosnia under managers Husref Musemić and Vinko Marinović; both 2018–19 and 2019–20 seasons of the Bosnian Premier League and a 2018–19 Bosnian Cup triumph as well.

==Crest and colours==
The club&#x27;s colours are maroon and white, while in recent years burgundy, black, and gold have also been used as alternative club colours. Originally, the club colours were sky blue and white. The change came about in the summer of 1962 when Sarajevo was drawn with Servette FC in the Rapan Cup, whose captain was former Sarajevo star Lav Mantula. After their fixture in Sarajevo, Mantula visited the club offices, and in a conversation with the management, suggested that Sarajevo adopt Servette&#x27;s club colours because no team in Yugoslavia at the time had maroon as its main colour. His idea was liked, which resulted in a historic decision at the next club assembly, where Sarajevo adopted maroon as its permanent club color. Sarajevo&#x27;s colours have subsequently become a major pop culture reference since their adoption. The first official club crest depicted a red five-pointed communist star. In 1949, the crest was modified to feature golden borders enclosing a golden silhouette of a footballer. Additionally, a blue industrial gear within a circular frame, symbolizing socialist industrialization, included the club&#x27;s name. In 1962, the club crest was changed for the third time. It adopted a badge-like form, divided vertically into two sections: the outer section displayed the club&#x27;s name and the communist star, while the inner section featured a football and the club&#x27;s founding year. After the Bosnian War ended in 1996, the crest was slightly modified. The communist star was replaced with a Bosnian fleur-de-lis, and the design, including the lettering font, was slightly stylized. This updated crest became one of the club&#x27;s most recognizable trademarks in the following years. The adding of fleur-de-lis motifs to their crests was a common practice by Bosnian football clubs in the first few years after the war. The fleur-de-lis was eventually removed from the club crest in 2009, which today lacks any ideological or national symbols. Instead, the club readily emphasizes its Yugoslav-era crests as part of its heritage, often marketing souvenirs that are embroidered with them. The Bosnian Fleur-de-lis was once again restored as a temporary club motif during the 2013–14 season, when it was included in the third kit design.

==Stadium and training grounds==
FK Sarajevo plays at the Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium, formerly known as the Koševo Stadium. It is owned by the City of Sarajevo but is leased to the club on a long-term basis. The club runs and operates the stadium and has sole commercial and developmental rights to the Olympic complex until at least 2051, with the possibility of a further 15-year extension. The current seating capacity is 34,500. The stadium was opened in 1947 and named after the Sarajevo neighborhood of Koševo, where it is located. The stadium was literally buried into a local hill thus merging with its natural surroundings. In 1950 a pitch and a tartan track were also added. The first international football match at the stadium was played between Yugoslavia and Turkey, in 1954.

In 1966, the stadium hosted the Balkan Games and was again renovated for the occasion. A new administration building was built, as were new locker rooms and a restaurant. A modern scoreboard and new lighting were also provided. In 1984, the stadium was reconstructed for the 1984 Winter Olympics that were held in Sarajevo and is therefore often unofficially called &quot;The Olympic Stadium&quot;. It is important to note that on 7 February 1984, the Asim H. Ferhatović stadium hosted the opening ceremony of the games, and seated roughly 50,000. The West stand held 18,500 seating places at the time.

In 2004 the stadium&#x27;s official name was changed to Asim H. Ferhatović, in memory of legendary FK Sarajevo striker Asim Ferhatović, who died after a heart attack in 1987. In 1998, three years after the end of the Bosnian War, the stadium was renovated for a fourth time. The seating capacity of the stadium was reduced to 34,500 and new seats were added. The ground has held matches for Sarajevo and their local rival FK Željezničar, including Europa League and Champions League fixtures. Furthermore, the stadium has hosted the national teams of Yugoslavia and Bosnia and Herzegovina on numerous occasions, as well as many notable athletic meetings.

The stadium&#x27;s highest attendance was recorded in a 1981–82 league match between FK Sarajevo and their city rival FK Željezničar. Allegedly, roughly 60.000 people attended the game.

The club&#x27;s current training ground, known as the Butmir Training Centre is located in the Ilidža municipality of the Sarajevo Canton. The complex was opened in October 2015 and comprises a 70,000 square meter (17 acres) surface, containing state-of-the-art facilities. It is also used by the club&#x27;s youth school and women&#x27;s team. The main artificial turf pitch is named after club legend Želimir Vidović, who was killed during the Siege of Sarajevo while transporting wounded citizens to a nearby hospital. A statue of Vidović was erected on the western grass knoll that encompasses the turf.

==Organization==
===Ownership and finances===
FK Sarajevo is registered as a Private company limited by guarantee and corporate personhood that, unlike football clubs that are registered as limited companies, does not issue shares by which individuals or corporations can buy majority or minority ownership. Instead, the club&#x27;s members act as guarantors by buying non-ownership-based management stakes in the form of contributions, earning in return management and voting rights. The guarantors give an undertaking to contribute a nominal amount in the event of the winding up of the company. It is often believed that such a company cannot distribute its profits to its members but, depending on the provisions of the articles, as is the case with FK Sarajevo, it very well may. Managing rights imply the right to form and control the club assembly, steering committee, and supervisory board, by which the largest contributor &quot;de iure&quot; takes full control of the club. Furthermore, the fact that the largest contributor may negotiate profit provisions between himself and the club opens the possibility for large-scale financial investment that exceeds charitable and non-profit contributions that are usually the cornerstone of companies limited by guarantee.

Malaysian billionaire, investor, and former chairman of Berjaya Group, Vincent Tan, was the club&#x27;s majority contributor and thus its sole operator. After gaining control of the club in December 2013 by contributing US$2 million, Tan negotiated an agreement between himself and the club, by which he will invest an undisclosed sum while also running the operational finances and policies of the club, in return gaining the right to profit as would be the case of the club being a limited company. Furthermore, the formation of Public limited companies in the fields of real estate and tourism has been negotiated between the club and Tan, by which the companies will represent a joint venture by both parties, earning the club complete financial self-sustainability in the future. After taking control of the club, Vincent Tan dissolved the long-standing steering committee and supervisory board, opting to create a five-member board of directors for the day-to-day running of the club. He appointed two of his Malaysian business associates, Ken Choo i Lim Meng Kwong, members of the board alongside three local members. The club&#x27;s annual operational expenditure and budget have been undisclosed since Tan gained control of the club. In September 2015 the club paid off the last of its public and private debt, thus becoming one of the rare debt-free clubs in eastern Europe.

In March 2019, it was announced that the ownership majority package was sold to Vietnamese businessman Nguyễn Hoài Nam and the PVF Investment and Trading, JSC &quot;(Promotion Fund of Vietnamese Football Talents F.C.)&quot;.

In August 2021 Vincent Tan and Bosnian-American businessman Ismir Mirvić repurchased majority stakes from PVF Investment and Trading, JSC, with the former gaining 60% of club stakes and the prior gaining 30%. Mirvić, who was named club president, reestablished the club&#x27;s supervisory board and formed a new, three-member board of directors. In September 2022, Tan and Mirvić renegotiated their majority stakes, each acquiring control of 49.13%.

The club&#x27;s general sponsor is Turkish Airlines, with whom it signed a lucrative four-year deal in 2015. It has been hailed as the most profitable sponsorship agreement in the history of Bosnian sports. The club and Turkish Airlines extended their partnership for a third time in 2022, signing a new three-year sponsorship deal. FK Sarajevo&#x27;s kit has been manufactured by Adidas since 2023. The club has a variety of other sponsors and official partners, which include Tourism Malaysia, Peugeot, Telemach, BH Telecom, Securitas, NLB Group, Mtel Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sarajevska pivara and others. As of 2023, the club is in an official partnership with the Sarajevo Canton and promotes the latter&#x27;s coat of arms on its kit.

===Social responsibility===
Social responsibility and humanitarian efforts are fundamental values of Sarajevo, and the club is renowned for its commitment to these principles. It runs an aid and social programs foundation aimed at encouraging education and promoting healthy living among disadvantaged children, young people, and families. Furthermore, the club has been on the forefront of community development for years, donating large sums of money through its foundation to underdeveloped municipalities and school districts. The club organizes traditional blood donation conventions in its clinic every month while raising awareness for health issues that are impacting society. An annual arts competition is organized by the club in which primary school children in the Sarajevo Canton are asked to draw or paint a mascot for the team. The three best-ranked artists receive scholarships for afterschool arts and crafts programs. Women&#x27;s rights are a key focus of the club&#x27;s community and social development initiatives. In addition to sponsoring a shelter for battered women, the club offers free stadium entry to all female fans during the week of International Women&#x27;s Day. Sarajevo has a long-standing partnership with the leading Bosnian charity agency &quot;Pomozi.ba.&quot; Together, they collaborate on numerous projects across the country, with the club having promoted the agency on its kit from 2014 to 2018. The club is dedicated to the development of Srebrenica, awarding yearly scholarships to hundreds of children from the town and sponsoring the local multiethnic football team, FK Guber. Sarajevo was one of the eight core members of the &quot;2nd Chance Group CIC&quot;-led project &quot;Give Football A Chance&quot;, the others being Altınordu, Athletic Bilbao, Atromitos, Hammarby, Schalke 04, Sheffield United and Vitesse. The project&#x27;s goal was the improvement of health and well-being of more than 5000 children living in conflict zones and implementing a comprehensive program of both formal and informal education for the children. In the aftermath of the 2014 Southeast Europe floods that devastated numerous towns in the country, FK Sarajevo was a major contributor to the massive relief effort. The club organized and sent volunteers to the stricken towns, and helped finance the rebuilding of homes both directly and through its foundation. The club&#x27;s Malaysian owner Vincent Tan was also a major contributor to the relief effort, personally donating 250,000 BAM to hospitals in Maglaj and Doboj. In January 2016 Sarajevo hosted Syrian refugee children, in cooperation with UNICEF and the Red Cross. In October 2016 Sarajevo, together with Novi Pazar and Velež, organized a friendly match in Mostar. The profits from the match tickets went to a fund for Syrian refugees. The club employs war veterans from the Ilidža municipality in its training center.
In October 2024, the club launched a breast cancer awareness campaign titled &quot;FK Sarajevo For the Cure.&quot; For this event, the players donned uniforms not only in their signature maroon but with touches of pink as well. The team wore specially designed jerseys featuring the words &quot;Fighter, Survivor, &amp; Honor,&quot; aligning with the colors and symbols of the official campaign in collaboration with the organization &quot;Think Pink.&quot;

In 2019 the club established the annuel Želimir Vidović Keli Award for humanitarian work.

==Youth department and affiliates==

The FK Sarajevo Youth Department () is split into two sections. Namely, The Asim Ferhatović Hase School of Football (), named after legendary striker Asim Ferhatović, and the FK Sarajevo Academy (). The former functions as both a general model for the popularization of the sport and as a filtering mechanism, used to pick out locally based footballing talents which are later transferred to the academy. The academy, a premier boarding school, attracts the top talents from Bosnia and Herzegovina and manages the club&#x27;s competitive youth selections. Established in the 1950s, it has historically been recognized as one of the best youth systems in the former Yugoslavia. FK Sarajevo&#x27;s youth teams train at two locations: the training facilities adjacent to Koševo Stadium and the elite Butmir Training Centre, which is currently undergoing expansion as of June 2024.

===Memorials===

Below is a list of memorials established by the club.
* Horde zla
: The club raised a memorial outside of the north stand of the Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium which bears tribute to hundreds of members of the club&#x27;s ultras group, Horde zla, killed in the defense of the city during the Siege of Sarajevo.
* Svetozar Vujović
: Svetozar Vujović played for the club from 1959 to 1972, serving as a key figure in the 1967 championship-winning team. After his playing career, he briefly managed the club for one season before assuming the role of club director, a position he held for more than two decades. When the Siege of Sarajevo began in 1992, Vujović chose to remain in the city, turning down numerous offers of refuge. After his passing on January 16, 1993, FK Sarajevo honored him by naming the club’s main ceremonial lounge in its downtown administrative facility &quot;The Svetozar Vujović Salon.&quot;
* Asim Ferhatović
: Asim Ferhatović, a legendary forward for the club, scored 66 goals in 174 league appearances, making him the club’s all-time leading scorer in official competitions. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players to don the maroon-white jersey, Ferhatović’s legacy lives on through the Koševo Stadium, which bears his name following his death in 1987. Additionally, the club’s School of Football, a key part of its youth program, is named in his honor.
* Želimir Vidović
: Želimir Vidović was a standout player for the club in the 1970s and early 1980s. On May 17, 1992, during the Siege of Sarajevo, Vidović participated in an operation to transport wounded civilians to a hospital in the Dobrinja neighborhood. The convoy was intercepted by Serb forces, and Vidović was executed, with his remains later discovered in a mass grave. Since 2004, an annual tournament has been held in his honor, and the main pitch at the Butmir Training Centre is named after him. A statue of Vidović stands on the western grass knoll surrounding the field.
* Ismir Pintol 
: Ismir Pintol, a 6-year-old FK Sarajevo supporter, passed away on June 29, 2002, after a long battle with leukemia. In his memory, the club, in partnership with Horde zla, established the Ismir Pintol trophy (&quot;Trofej Ismir Pintol&quot;), awarded to the standout player of the previous season. This tradition began in the 2002–03 season. To honor Ismir, fans remain seated in silence for the first six minutes of the final home game each season. The trophy is presented before kick-off at the base of the north stand. 
* Vedran Puljić 
: Vedran Puljić, a 24-year-old member of FK Sarajevo’s ultras group, Horde zla, was tragically killed by a single gunshot during the notorious Široki Brijeg football riots on October 4, 2009. The shot that took Puljić’s life was reportedly fired by a local police officer, Oliver Knezović, who was arrested shortly after but never prosecuted. On May 23, 2013, the curva at the north stand of Koševo Stadium, the traditional gathering spot for Horde zla, was named in Puljić’s honor. Each year, the club holds a vigil at his gravesite to mark the anniversary of his death.

==Women&#x27;s football==
FK Sarajevo also operates a women&#x27;s football team, SFK 2000. The team has been affiliated with the men&#x27;s team since 2015, following a merger agreement signed on July 4, after which the club adopted the FK Sarajevo crest and colors. The club was established in June 2000 as part of the &quot;Alija Miladin&quot; recreational association, subsequently affiliating with a now-defunct men&#x27;s football team from Sarajevo&#x27;s Otoka neighborhood. They play their home games in the domestic league at the Butmir Training Centre and European fixtures at Koševo Stadium. Since its inception, the club has become the dominant force in Bosnian women&#x27;s football, securing 23 consecutive national titles, 22 consecutive national cups (22 doubles), and representing the country in European competitions. It is also the most decorated women&#x27;s club in the former Yugoslavia. The club has participated in the UEFA Women&#x27;s Cup from 2003 onwards but never reached the final rounds. In the 2009–10 UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League, when the competition was rebranded and reorganized, the side reached the round of 32, a feat repeated during the 2012–13 season. The side&#x27;s best UEFA women&#x27;s club ranking was 17th in August 2013. SFK 2000 players form the core of the Bosnia and Herzegovina women&#x27;s national team, while the side&#x27;s manager, Samira Hurem, was the longstanding Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina manager until 2024. On 29 August 2016 the club qualified for the Round of 32 in the Women&#x27;s Champions League for a third time in its History. On 1 September 2016 the team drew WFC Rossiyanka of Russia in the round of 32. The club once again qualified for the round of 32, this time in the 2018–19 UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League season, but got eliminated by Chelsea F.C..

SFK 2000 operates a youth academy for girls from the ages of five to sixteen. The academy is one of the most renowned and export-oriented in Europe. Notable alumni include Inter Milan defender, Marija Milinković; Juventus defender, Gloria Slišković; Inter Milan forward, Maja Jelčić; Milan forward, Lidija Kuliš and Sporting defender, Melisa Hasanbegović.

As of 17 December 2024, SFK 2000 is ranked as the 30th most successful women&#x27;s football club in Europe.

==USD Bosna==

Sarajevo maintains a close relationship with USD Bosna (English: University Sport Society Bosna; ), founded on 7 December 1947, to organize university student sports clubs in Sarajevo. USD Bosna was the largest sports society in the Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with teams in 19 sports. Notable members include KK Bosna Visit Sarajevo, which won the Euroleague Basketball title in 1979 and RK Bosna Sarajevo, which reached the 1/8 finals of the EHF Champions League in 2011.
This relationship is rooted in their shared maroon and white club colours, leading KK Bosna to attract most of its fan base from FK Sarajevo during its rise in the mid and late 1970s. Over time, the two became colloquially interchangeable, with Sarajevo&#x27;s organized ultras group, Horde Zla, supporting both teams, forming a so-called Maroon Family. Although RK Bosna was not a major player in Yugoslav handball, its post-war rise was strongly supported by Horde Zla.

On 29 August 2013, FK Sarajevo and RK Bosna Sarajevo signed a cooperation agreement to strengthen ties among the Maroon Family. A similar agreement was signed between Sarajevo and KK Bosna Royal on 6 November 2013, formalizing their forty-year relationship.

==Supporters==
FK Sarajevo is one of the two most popular clubs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, boasting a large fanbase across the country, the Sandžak region of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Bosnian diaspora. This diaspora is especially prominent in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Scandinavia, Canada, Australia, and the United States. The largest diaspora fan association is registered in Stuttgart, Germany.

From its establishment on 24 October 1946, FK Sarajevo quickly garnered a following in the city of Sarajevo. The banning of nearly all pre-war Sarajevan clubs by the new communist authorities left a significant vacuum in a city traditionally known as a footballing center in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The majority of fans came from the downtown neighborhoods of Baščaršija, Stari grad, and Centar, predominantly inhabited by Bosniaks. While other ethnicities supported the club in equal numbers, the history of organized support is nonetheless closely tied to these neighborhoods.

FK Sarajevo fans have been historically called Pitari while an individual was, and is still known as a Pitar. The nickname, meaning a consumer of the local Bosnian dish &quot;pita&quot;, was originally a derogatory label given by fans of working-class Željezničar that implied the pre-World War Two upper-class background of most FK Sarajevo supporters. This stemmed from the fact that the old downtown neighborhoods of the city were traditional centers of commerce and artisanship, even though the socioeconomic landscape had dramatically changed by the time the club was founded.

The organized supporters&#x27; group of Sarajevo, known as Horde zla (English: Hordes of Evil or Gang Evil), was formed in 1987 with the arrival of the Ultras subculture to Yugoslavia. The group is located on the north stand of the Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium and has a decentralized organizational structure with many subgroups present at matches. The group&#x27;s name was borrowed from a Zagor comic book at the time of its inception. Its logo features a stylized depiction of the Grim Reaper. Horde zla has gained notoriety over the decades for severe incidents of football violence. Horde zla have in the past garnered close relations with Dynamo Dresden ultras.

Another notable supporters&#x27; association and advocacy group is Maroon Friends 1946. This group attracts influential individuals from the financial, political, and cultural sectors of Bosnian society, aiming to lobby for the club both locally and internationally and influence club policies. The association is closely connected to the club&#x27;s ultras, with many of its members having been part of Horde zla in their youth. The current chairman of Maroon Friends 1946 is Benjamin Isović, a prominent Bosnian singer-songwriter and poet.

==Rivalries==
===Sarajevo derby===
FK Sarajevo&#x27;s biggest rivalry is with fellow Sarajevo club FK Željezničar. Meetings between these rivals are known as the Sarajevo derby or the &quot;Eternal derby&quot; (). The Sarajevo derby is particularly noted for the passion of both supporters groups. The stands of both teams feature fireworks, colored confetti, flags, rolls of paper, torches, smoke, drums, giant posters, and choreographies, used to create visual grandeur and apply psychological pressure on the visiting teams, hence the slogan, &quot;Hellcome to Sarajevo&quot;. The roots of the rivalry can be traced back to the strong historical animosity between the capital&#x27;s working class and bourgeoisie, wherein the former traditionally inhabited the more liberal, yet poorer suburban neighbourhoods and mainly supported FK Željezničar, while the latter resided in the traditional and wealthy, old and central parts of the city and represented the main fan-base of FK Sarajevo. Furthermore, since its formation, FK Sarajevo has always been closely tied to the political elites of Bosnia and Herzegovina, both in socialist Yugoslavia and since the country&#x27;s independence, while FK Željezničar seldom had such influential support and has been considered a club of common folk, even though this notion can be disputed. Even though the rivalry between the two sides grew large from the very foundation of FK Sarajevo, the two teams only met in friendly fixtures for the better part of a decade because they competed in different levels of the Yugoslav football league system. The first official league match was held in 1954; FK Sarajevo won 6–1. This is still the biggest victory by any team in the Sarajevo derby.

As of 22 February 2025, 154 Sarajevo derbies have been played, with 45 wins for FK Sarajevo, 47 for FK Željezničar, and 62 draws (183:187).

===Other rivalries===

Sarajevo also shares a strong historic rivalry with Čelik Zenica, because of the close proximity of their two cities, and a relatively new rivalry with Široki Brijeg, which emerged following the Široki Brijeg riots. These riots resulted in the death of Sarajevo supporter Vedran Puljić and caused over thirty serious injuries, including four gunshot wounds. There are conflicting reports about who initiated the violence. Horde zla accused local residents and police of mistreatment during their journey to the match and upon entering the stadium. According to Horde zla&#x27;s official statement, the incident was orchestrated by local politicians. They claim their buses were separated and parked far from the stadium, exposing them to stoning and attacks. They also assert that only 30 local policemen were initially present and did nothing to prevent the violence. Local police and residents said Horde zla members were the first to attack. According to local police officials, most of the regional police had earlier been sent to the nearby city of Mostar to prevent possible violence during a match between city rivals Zrinjski and Velež. The subsequent violence that followed resulted in Puljić&#x27;s death. Since the riots, meetings of the two sides have carried an ominous atmosphere. Sarajevo has also developed a relatively new rivalry with Zrinjski, rooted in the pivotal roles both clubs play in Bosnian football.

==In popular culture==

In the 2011 British sports drama Will directed by Ellen Perry and starring Damian Lewis, Perry Eggleton and Bob Hoskins, eleven-year-old Will Brennan and fictional former FK Sarajevo footballer Alek journey to see Liverpool play AC Milan in the 2005 Champions League Final at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul.

The music video for the song Everyday by American rock band Bon Jovi was partly filmed at the Koševo stadium and depicts the name FK Sarajevo.

In the hit 1982 Yugoslav comedy film A Tight Spot () directed by Mića Milošević and starring Nikola Simić, the main character Mita Pantić is seen listening to a radio broadcast of Sarajevo winning a Yugoslav First League fixture versus Sloboda.

The songs &quot;Nedelja kad je otiš&#x27;o Hase&quot; and &quot;Džana&quot; by Yugoslav and Bosnian punk rock band Zabranjeno Pušenje reference the club. The former is a song about a young boy heading to the Koševo stadium to watch a testimonial match against Osijek dedicated to club legend Asim Ferhatović, which is a direct metaphor for the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito. The latter is a song about a petty criminal being released from prison and finding love. The song contains the lyric: &quot;Na Koševo je išla da gledamo Saraj&#x27;vo&quot; (English: &quot;She headed to Koševo so we could watch Sarajevo&quot;).

Zabranjeno pušenje&#x27;s a cappella poem &quot;Pamtim to kao da je bilo danas&quot; from their 1984 studio album Das ist Walter also references the club with the following verse: &quot;Pamtim to kao da je bilo danas kad je babo Atif otišao od nas, u ruci mu piva, za reverom značka FK Sarajeva&quot; (English: &quot;I remember it as if it were yesterday, when father Atif left us, beer in hand, FK Sarajevo badge on his lapel&quot;).

The hit song &quot;Kremen&quot; from the album Sredinom by Dino Merlin, one of the most prominent and commercially successful recording artists from the Former Yugoslavia, contains the lyric: &quot;Nedostaješ mi još više medena nego go vatrenom bordo navijaču&quot; (English: &quot;I miss you even more, honey, then an ardent maroon fan misses a goal&quot;).

Top lista nadrealista, a popular Yugoslav sketch comedy and variety television show from the 1980s and early 1990s, often referenced the club in its sketches.

In an episode of the popular Swedish thriller drama television series Caliphate, directed by Goran Kapetanović, one of the female characters is often seen wearing a Sarajevo jersey.

The magazine includes reports on the club&#x27;s matches in the previous month, as well as information about the youth selections. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club&#x27;s historic matches.

<doc id="689494" wikidata="Q5147583" url="?curid=689494" title="Colloquy (law)">
<text>In law, a colloquy is a routine, highly formalized conversation. Conversations among the judge and lawyers (as opposed to testimony under oath) are colloquies. The term may be applied to the conversation that takes place when a defendant enters into a plea bargain and the judge is supposed to verify that the defendant understands that he is waiving his right to a jury trial.

In criminal court, a colloquy is an investigation within a defendant&#x27;s plea to reassure that the plea was given &quot;knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently&quot;. The defendant needs to understand the charges against him, the penalties that he will face, and his rights before entering into a guilty plea. In the US, that includes describing the rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments as well as a caution that non-citizens who are convicted of crimes risk expulsion from the country. In appellate advocacy, back and forth between judges and attorneys are often referred to colloquies.

A defendant who denies guilt may still &quot;plead down&quot;—plead to a lesser offense than the accusation—provided the Court allows it and provided the accused intelligently concludes on an open record that a plea is in her/his best interest (such as avoiding incarceration or a more serious charge/conviction).

<text>North Manchester was, from 1896 to 1916 a civil parish within the Poor Law Union of Manchester, in Lancashire, (now Greater Manchester) England. North Manchester was a local government sub-district used for the administration of Poor Law legislation; it was an inter-parish unit for social security. Although abolished in 1916, the name North Manchester endured for the area, and is still applied to the northern parts of the city, for instance as a registration district up until 1974.

The parish was formed on 26 March 1896 from Beswick, Blackley, Bradford, Cheetham, Clayton, Crumpsall, Harpurhey, Moston and Newton, all of which had been amalgamated into Manchester during the mid-to-late 19th century. On 1 April 1916 the parish was abolished and merged with Manchester. In 1911 the parish had a population of 208,324.

<doc id="689506" wikidata="Q2469852" url="?curid=689506" title="Mountain Ash, Rhondda Cynon Taf">
<text>Mountain Ash () is a town and former community in the Cynon Valley, within the County Borough of Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales, with a population of 11,230 at the 2011 Census, estimated in 2019 at 11,339. It includes the districts and villages of Cefnpennar, Cwmpennar, Caegarw, Darranlas, Fernhill, Glenboi and Newtown, all within the historic county boundaries of Glamorgan. Aberdare lies about 4.5 miles (7.2 km) north-west, Cardiff 19 miles (31 km) south-east, and Penrhiwceiber a mile to the south-east. It divides into two communities (civil parishes): West covers the town centre and the districts of Miskin, Darranlas, Fernhill and Glenboi, and East the districts of Cefnpennar, Cwmpennar, Caegarw and Newtown.

==Etymology==
Before the establishment of a village in the early 19th century the landscape was identified by a variety of Welsh toponyms. The name Aberpennar (&quot;Mouth of the river Pennar&quot;) is recorded as early as 1570 as &quot;Aber Pennarthe&quot;, in 1600 as &quot;Aberpennarth&quot; and by 1638 as &quot;Tir Aber Penarth&quot;. By the turn of the 18th century another toponym, Dyffryn (Valley or lowland between hills) seems to have gained prominence. While the Bruce family mansion was originally named &quot;Aberpennar&quot;, the house is listed as &quot;Aberpennar alias Dyffryn&quot; by 1691 and &quot;Dyffrin alias Aberpennar&quot; in 1717, before taking the sole name &quot;Duffryn&quot; when it was rebuilt in the mid-18th century. Contemporary tithe maps even show that the early village is named &quot;Dyffryn&quot;, despite the river mouth being in its immediate vicinity.

The town takes its English name from the &quot;Mountain Ash Inn&quot;, which was opened around 1809 on the old Aberdare Road. Thomas Morgan states that the land owner, John Bruce Pryce leased this land to a man named David John Rhys, for the building of a public house. When Pryce asked Rhys for the name of the new building, Rhys noticed a lone &quot;Cerdinen&quot; (The Welsh name for a mountain ash tree, or rowan, common to the area) near by. Rhys then replied to Pryce, &quot;We shall call this place Mountain Ash&quot;.

This Inn became a local landmark and was well known to English and Welsh speakers travelling through the area. By the 1830s, the name Mountain Ash was adopted as a name for the industrial village. Although, both Aberpennar and Duffryn had continued usage in various forms, notably for roads, canals, hotels, railways and collieries. As late as 1864, when the Great Western Railway opened the town&#x27;s new railway station, the name &quot;Middle Duffryn&quot; was originally chosen over Mountain Ash. Writing in 1887, Morgan differentiates &quot;Aberpennar&quot; as the town&#x27;s &quot;ancient name&quot; and &quot;Mountain Ash&quot; as its &quot;present name&quot;. Other late 19th century writers such as David Watkin Jones also used the name &quot;Mountain Ash&quot; even when writing exclusively in Welsh. William &quot;Glanffrwd&quot; Thomas explicitly states that the predominantly Welsh-speaking townsfolk do not use a Welsh name.

The issue of the town&#x27;s Welsh name was resolved when the National Eisteddfod was held at the grounds of Dyffryn House in 1905. In the previous year, the Eisteddfod was announced in the &quot;Aberdare Leader&quot; with the publication of a &quot;Penillion Telyn&quot; (lyrics for harp) by the poet Watkin Wyn. In the piece, the poet called on the Welsh people to consider the area&#x27;s ancient names and specifically called for Mountain Ash to be replaced with Aberpennar. Such was the popularity of the event and its competitors with the town&#x27;s general population, that the name Aberpennar was widely taken up by the town&#x27;s majority Welsh-speaking population and finally, adopted as the official Welsh name.

==History==
Like the rest of the Cynon Valley, Mountain Ash continued to be predominantly Welsh-speaking well into the 20th century. Unlike others in the South Wales valleys, the village was undisturbed until the construction of the Aberdare Canal in 1818. This became disused in the early 1920s and was filled in as New Cardiff Road in 1933.

The population of 1,614 in 1841 rose to 11,463 in 1871 as local collieries opened. The 1851 census shows the construction of Duffryn Street and Navigation Street. By 1859 there were 12 public houses, among the earliest being the &quot;Bruce Arms&quot;, the &quot;Junction Inn&quot; and the &quot;New Inn&quot;. By 1920, Kelly&#x27;s Directory listed over 200 businesses in the village.

The coal industry began to decline after the First World War, but after the Second, manufacturing was introduced to offset the serious fall in local employment. By the end of the 20th century the last mines had closed and so had many of the factories. The economic hardships were mitigated partly by new light industry and service activities.

==Religion==
Mountain Ash had numerous nonconformist chapels, of which only one Welsh-language chapel remains: Bethania (Independent). Bethlehem (Calvinistic Methodist) closed, as did an Independent chapel at Bethel, Miskin.

Like other communities in the Cynon Valley, Mountain Ash was affected by the Religious Revival of 1904–1905. One event on a Friday evening in late January came when a procession paraded through the main streets before a revivalist meeting at Bethania Chapel addressed by the Rev. Penar Griffiths.

==Governance==
An electoral ward of Mountain Ash was created, effective from the 2022 local elections, which combined the former wards of Mountain Ash East and Mountain Ash West. The ward elects two councillors to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council.

Mountain Ash originally straddled the parishes of Aberdare and Llanwonno. An ecclesiastical parish for Mountain Ash was created in 1863 covering parts of those two civil parishes, with the recently built St Margaret&#x27;s Church as the new parish church. A local government district was established in 1867 to run the growing town, governed by the Mountain Ash Local Board. By 1894 the local government district had been enlarged to cover parts of the civil parishes of Aberdare, Llanwonno, and Llanfabon. Under the Local Government Act 1894 the local board was reconstituted as an urban district council, and at the same time the parish boundaries were adjusted so that the parish of Llanwonno matched the Mountain Ash Urban District. The council went on to build Mountain Ash Town Hall, completed in 1904, to serve as its offices and meeting place.

Mountain Ash Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The area became part of the borough of Cynon Valley within the new county of Mid Glamorgan. The area of the former urban district was made a community, later being subdivided in 1982 into four communities: Abercynon, Penrhiwceiber, Ynysybwl, and a smaller Mountain Ash community. The Mountain Ash community was further divided in 2017 into two communities called Mountain Ash East and Mountain Ash West. No community council exists for either of the Mountain Ash communities.

Cynon Valley Borough Council and Mid Glamorgan County Council were both abolished in 1996, since when Mountain Ash has been governed by Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council.

==Transport==
The town is served by Mountain Ash railway station on the Aberdare branch of the Merthyr Line of the Transport for Wales Rail network. The village of Fernhill and Penrhiwceiber is also served by the Aberdare line. Bus services are operated by Stagecoach in South Wales.

===NCB Mountain Ash Railway===

An early British railway line had developed from the industrial development within the South Wales Valleys, which with its core around Mountain Ash became known as the Mountain Ash Railway (MAR). Having developed from an early tramway, it became in the 1970s the last steam-hauled line in the UK. Developed by Powell Duffryn as it consolidated various industrial assets, the railway started from Afon Cynon at the Penrikyber Colliery, headed north past a coal-stocking area at Pontcynon, then past an interchange yard known as Lansdale Yard, and through the former Nixon&#x27;s Navigation colliery – home of the railway&#x27;s central workshops, locomotive sheds and weighbridge – and on north past Duffryn Colliery, terminating at the Abercwmboi Phurnacite plant. The railway&#x27;s main access to the UK rail network was at the Vale of Neath Railway&#x27;s station at Mountain Ash (Cardiff Road) railway station, but it also had access to the competing, dominant Taff Vale Railway.

Early locomotives were drawn from all major UK industrial locomotive makers, but like many industrial railways after World War Two, the operational fleet was based on a core of group of Hunslet Austerity 0-6-0STs. In 1959 the National Coal Board (NCB) acquired the ex-GWR Pannier Tank No. 7754. Although rather too heavy to work on the relatively light rail of the MAR, whose poor maintenance resulted in regular spreading of the rails, it became a favourite with MAR crews after a refit in the late 1960s. It eventually became the last British mainline-built operating steam locomotive in the UK, until 1975 after a cylinder-valve crack. The NCB were persuaded to donate the locomotive to National Museum Wales, which has since loaned it indefinitely to the Llangollen Railway. The MAR closed in the mid-1980s after the miners&#x27; strike.

==Education==
Mountain Ash Comprehensive School caters for pupils aged 11–18, on the site of the former estate of Lord Aberdare. The main Dyffryn House was used by the school until its demolition in the 1990s. Opposite the site is the hospital, Ysbyty Cwm Cynon that replaced the Mountain Ash General Hospital in 2012.

Local primary schools include Our Lady&#x27;s RC Primary School, Caegarw Primary School (Ysgol Gynradd Caegarw), Glenboi Primary School (Ysgol Gynradd Glen-boi), Darranlas Primary School (Ysgol Gynradd Darren-las), Miskin Primary School (Ysgol Gynradd Meisgyn), Pengeulan Primary School (Ysgol Gynradd Pengeulan) and Penrhiwceiber Primary School (Ysgol Gynradd Penrhiwceibr).

==Sport and culture==

Mountain Ash has a rugby union team, Mountain Ash RFC. The Rugby league club South Wales Scorpions played its home matches in Mountain Ash in the 2014-15 season.

Nos Galan road race () is an annual road running race, run on New Year&#x27;s Eve (&quot;Nos Galan&quot;) to commemorate the first race of Guto Nyth Bran. Started in 1958, it now attracts 800+ runners and 10,000 people to the associated street entertainment.

The town also had an association football club, Tynte Rovers until it folded in 2019.

In 1974, Mountain Ash RFC Singers is a male-voice choir formed from a group of ex-players. Mountain Ash hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1905 and 1946.

Mountain Ash served as inspiration for the fictional town of Aberowen in &quot;Fall of Giants&quot; and the rest of the &quot;Century Trilogy&quot; written by Ken Follett. The town also appears in the Danny Wallace&#x27;s 2005 memoir &quot;Yes Man&quot;.

<text>The Java Foundation Classes (JFC) are a graphical framework for building portable Java-based graphical user interfaces (GUIs). JFC consists of the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), Swing and Java 2D. Together, they provide a consistent user interface for Java programs, regardless of whether the underlying user interface system is Windows, macOS or Linux.

==History==
AWT existed before JFC. AWT was heavily criticized for being little more than a wrapper around the native graphical capabilities of the host platform. That meant that the standard widgets in the AWT relied on those capabilities of the native widgets, requiring the developer to also be aware of the differences between host platforms.

An alternative graphics library called the Internet Foundation Classes was developed in more platform-independent code by Netscape.

At the same time, another graphics library, called Application Foundation Classes (AFC), was developed independently by Microsoft. It was made to be easier to extend the graphic components, but was primarily aimed for use with the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine.

On April 2, 1997, Sun Microsystems and Netscape announced their intention to combine IFC with other technologies to form the &quot;Java Foundation Classes&quot;. The &quot;Java Foundation Classes&quot; were later renamed &quot;Swing&quot;, adding the capability for a pluggable look and feel of the widgets. This allowed Swing programs to maintain a platform-independent code base, but mimic the look of a native application. The release of JFC made IFC obsolete, and dropped interest for Microsoft&#x27;s AFC.

Using the Java programming language, Java Foundation Classes (JFC) are pre-written code in the form of class libraries (coded routines) that give the programmer a comprehensive set of graphical user interface (GUI) routines to use. The Java Foundation Classes are comparable to the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC). JFC is an extension of the original Java Abstract Windowing Toolkit (AWT). Using JFC and Swing, an additional set of program components, a programmer can write programs that are independent of the windowing system within a particular operating system.

<doc id="689521" wikidata="Q747928" url="?curid=689521" title="China Beach">
<text>China Beach is an American war drama television series set at an evacuation hospital during the Vietnam War. The title refers to My Khe beach in the city of Đà Nẵng, Vietnam, nicknamed &quot;China Beach&quot; in English by American and Australian soldiers during the Vietnam War. The series originally ran on ABC for four seasons from April 27, 1988 to July 22, 1991.

==Overview==
Created by William Broyles Jr. and John Sacret Young, the series looks at the Vietnam War from the perspectives of the women, military personnel and civilians who were present during the conflict. John Wells and Lydia Woodward joined the writing staff for China Beach beginning with the second season. Many of the show’s cast members appeared later on another Wells production, ER.

Set at the fictitious 510th Evacuation Hospital and R&amp;R facility (the &quot;Five-and-Dime&quot;), the series&#x27; cast of characters includes US Army doctors and nurses, officers, soldiers, Red Cross volunteers and civilian personnel (American, French, and Vietnamese). The series also features the experiences of the characters when they return to the United States, either on leave or at the end of their tours of duty. The show does not shy away from showing the brutality of war; it provides a gritty view of the experience and its aftermath.

The show was inspired in part by the book &quot;Home Before Morning&quot; (1983) written by the former U.S. Army Nurse Lynda Van Devanter. The show&#x27;s character Nurse Colleen McMurphy roughly follows Van Devanter&#x27;s experiences as a nurse in Vietnam. The book takes the reader from Van Devanter&#x27;s wish to serve her country through the adventure she thought her deployment to Vietnam would be, her culture shock upon returning to &quot;the States&quot;, and her struggles with PTSD. The show was cancelled before it could fully address McMurphy&#x27;s PTSD issues. Van Devanter died in 2002.

==Cast==

* Dana Delany as First Lieutenant (later Captain) Colleen McMurphy, USA – a Catholic girl from Lawrence, Kansas, and army nurse with the 510th Evac Hospital in Vietnam during the late 1960s. A composite of various real-life Vietnam War nurses, the character illustrates her courage, kindness, and sacrifices during the war, as well as the severe emotional scarring of noncombatant personnel during and following military service; several episodes feature the veterans in their own words, intercut with the storyline. Delany won two Emmy awards for the role.
* Nan Woods as Cherry White (seasons 1–2) – a naive Red Cross volunteer (&quot;doughnut dolly&quot;) from Iowa, she comes to China Beach to search for her brother Rick, a Marine Infantryman, who was reported MIA. She dies midway through the second season during the Tet Offensive in January 1968.
* Michael Boatman as SP5 Samuel Beckett, USA – a draftee and a preacher&#x27;s son from North Carolina, he works in the Graves Registration unit at China Beach. His job makes him unpopular with most of the other servicemen.
* Marg Helgenberger as Karen Charlene &quot;K.C.&quot; Koloski – a cynical part-time prostitute and civilian volunteer, she comes to China Beach seeking to make her own wealth and fortune.
* Robert Picardo as Captain Dick Richard, USA – a head surgeon dealing with being drafted into Army and away from his family, he worked as an OB-GYN when he was a civilian.
* Tim Ryan as Captain Bartholomew &quot;Natch&quot; Austen, USAF (regular in season 1; recurring in season 2) – a jet fighter pilot and McMurphy&#x27;s love interest.
* Concetta Tomei as Major Lila Garreau, USA – a World War II veteran, she is the career Army commanding officer of China Beach.
* Brian Wimmer as Corporal Boonwell &quot;Boonie&quot; Lanier, USMC – the friendly China Beach lifeguard and manager of the Jet Set Club.
* Jeff Kober as Sergeant Evan &quot;Dodger&quot; Winslow, USMC – a moody Marine Force Reconnaissance operative, he serves and fights in the jungle mainly to keep other servicemen in his platoon alive. He constantly displays the &quot;thousand-yard stare&quot;, a blank facial expression common among soldiers who have seen too much death and destruction in battle. He is a friend of Boonie, McMurphy, and Cherry.
* Chloe Webb as Laurette Barber (season 1) – a USO singer from Paoli, Pennsylvania, she is determined to make it big.
* Megan Gallagher as Airman Wayloo Marie Holmes, USAF (season 2) – a reporter for the Armed Services Network, she is seeking a career as a world-famous reporter.
* Nancy Giles as Private Franklin &quot;Frankie&quot; Bunsen, USA (seasons 2–4) – a female private, she was assigned to the China Beach motor pool.
* Ned Vaughn as Specialist Jeff Hyers, USA (season 3; guest appearances in seasons 2 and 4) – a good-natured combat medic from Georgia, he is killed in action midway through the third season during a routine patrol.
* Troy Evans as Sergeant First Class Bob Pepper, USA (seasons 3–4) – a World War II veteran, he is a driver, mechanic, and non-commissioned officer in charge of the motor pool. He becomes romantically involved with Lila Garreau, whom he later marries.
* Ricki Lake as Holly &quot;the Donut Dolly&quot; Pelegrino, (season 3) – a sharp-witted Red Cross volunteer.

==Episodes==

Over four seasons from 1988 to 1991, the series aired 61 episodes and one pilot movie.
==Production==
The title sequence theme song was &quot;Reflections&quot; by Diana Ross &amp; the Supremes (the episode &quot;Phoenix&quot; instead used &quot;We Gotta Get out of This Place&quot; by Eric Burdon with Katrina &amp; The Waves).

==Reception==
&quot;China Beach&quot; was a critically lauded, but poorly rated series. ABC persisted with the show for four seasons, but the final season was put on hiatus in December 1990 and did not air its finale until July 22, 1991. As a result of the scheduling, Dana Delany was eligible for (and ultimately won) a Best Actress Emmy Award in the fall of 1992, a year after the series broadcast its final episode and over a year and a half after many of the scenes were filmed.

==Awards and nominations==
==Syndication==
&quot;China Beach&quot; debuted in rerun syndication on Lifetime, on November 4, 1991.

==Home media==
Before being released on DVD, the series&#x27; only home video release was the 97 minute pilot movie on Warner Home Video, in 1990 (cat no. 11971).
In December 2012, it was announced that the series, among the most-requested television shows not available through either VHS or DVD following its broadcast run, would be issued on DVD in a box set (including new interviews with cast members and various bonus features) and released on April 15, 2013, through StarVista Entertainment (affiliated with TimeLife). The collection includes 302 songs heard during the series. To mark the show&#x27;s 25th anniversary, a 21-disc collector&#x27;s set was released October 1, 2013.

Music rights long delayed the release on DVD. More than 250 songs were licensed; seventeen could not be, and were either deleted or replaced.

==Possible follow-up novel==
John Sacret Young stated prior to the show&#x27;s October 2013 DVD release that he was working on a follow-up novel, titled &quot;Reflections&quot;, in which Colleen, now in her 60s and recently widowed, returned to Vietnam and reconnected with the retired Dick Richard and venture capitalist K.C. Koloski. Young had also hoped to adapt it into a TV movie. However, the novel was never published.

<doc id="689524" wikidata="Q654034" url="?curid=689524" title="WebKit">
<text>WebKit is a browser engine primarily used in Apple&#x27;s Safari web browser, as well as all web browsers on iOS and iPadOS. WebKit is also used by the PlayStation consoles starting with the PS3, the Tizen mobile operating systems, the Amazon Kindle e-book reader, Nintendo consoles starting with the 3DS Internet Browser, GNOME Web, and the discontinued BlackBerry Browser. 

WebKit started as a fork of the KHTML and KJS libraries from KDE, and has since been further developed by KDE contributors, Apple, Google, Nokia, Bitstream, BlackBerry, Sony, Igalia, and others. WebKit supports macOS, Windows, Linux, and various other Unix-like operating systems. On April 3, 2013, Google announced that it had forked WebCore, a component of WebKit, to be used in future versions of Google Chrome and the Opera web browser, under the name Blink.

Its JavaScript engine, JavascriptCore, also powers the Bun server-side JS runtime, as opposed to V8 used by Node.js, Deno, and Blink. WebKit&#x27;s C++ application programming interface (API) provides a set of classes to display Web content in windows, and implements browser features such as following links when clicked by the user, managing a back-forward list, and managing a history of pages recently visited.

WebKit is open source and available under the BSD 2-Clause license with the exception of the WebCore and JavaScriptCore components, which are available under the GNU Lesser General Public License. As of March 7, 2013, WebKit is a trademark of Apple, registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

==Origins==
The code that would become WebKit began in 1998 as the &quot;KDE HTML&quot; (KHTML) layout engine and &quot;KDE JavaScript&quot; (KJS) engine. The WebKit project was started within Apple by Lisa Melton on June 25, 2001, as a fork of KHTML and KJS. Melton explained in an e-mail to KDE developers that KHTML and KJS allowed easier development than other available technologies by virtue of being small (fewer than 140,000 lines of code), cleanly designed and standards-compliant. KHTML and KJS were ported to macOS with the help of an adapter library and renamed WebCore and JavaScriptCore. JavaScriptCore was announced in an e-mail to a KDE mailing list in June 2002, alongside the first release of Apple&#x27;s changes.

According to Apple, some changes which called for different development tactics involved macOS-specific features that are absent in KDE&#x27;s KHTML, such as Objective-C, KWQ (pronounced &quot;quack&quot;) an implementation of the subset of Qt required to make KHTML work on macOS written in Objective C++, and macOS calls.

===Split development===
The exchange of code between WebCore and KHTML became increasingly difficult as the code base diverged because both projects had different approaches in coding and code sharing. At one point KHTML developers said they were unlikely to accept Apple&#x27;s changes and claimed the relationship between the two groups was a &quot;bitter failure&quot;. They claimed Apple submitted their changes in large patches containing multiple changes with inadequate documentation, often in relation to future additions to the codebase. Thus, these patches were difficult for the KDE developers to integrate back into KHTML. Also, Apple had demanded that developers sign non-disclosure agreements before looking at Apple&#x27;s source code and even then they were unable to access Apple&#x27;s bug database.

During the publicized &quot;divorce&quot; period, KDE developer Kurt Pfeifle (&quot;pipitas&quot;) posted an article claiming KHTML developers had managed to backport many (but not all) Safari improvements from WebCore to KHTML, and they always appreciated the improvements coming from Apple and still do so. The article also noted Apple had begun to contact KHTML developers about discussing how to improve the mutual relationship and ways of future cooperation. In fact, the KDE project was able to incorporate some of these changes to improve KHTML&#x27;s rendering speed and add features, including compliance with the Acid2 rendering test.

Following the appearance of a story of the fork in the news, Apple released the source code of the WebKit fork in a public revision-control repository.

The WebKit team had also reversed many Apple-specific changes in the original WebKit code base and implemented platform-specific abstraction layers to make committing the core rendering code to other platforms significantly easier.

In July 2007, &quot;Ars Technica&quot; reported that the KDE team would move from KHTML to WebKit. Instead, after several years of integration, KDE Development Platform version 4.5.0 was released in August 2010 with support for both WebKit and KHTML, and development of KHTML continued until 2016 before it was officially discontinued in 2023.

===Open-sourcing===
On June 7, 2005, Safari developer Dave Hyatt announced on his weblog that Apple was open-sourcing WebKit (formerly, only WebCore and JavaScriptCore were open source) and opening up access to WebKit&#x27;s revision control tree and the issue tracker.

In mid-December 2005, support for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) was merged into the standard build.

WebKit&#x27;s JavaScriptCore and WebCore components are available under the GNU Lesser General Public License, while the rest of WebKit is available under the BSD 2-Clause license.

===Further development===

Beginning in early 2007, the development team began to implement Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) extensions, including animation, transitions and both 2D and 3D transforms; such extensions were released as working drafts to the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 2009 for standardization.

In November 2007, the project announced that it had added support for media features of the HTML5 draft specification, allowing embedded video to be natively rendered and script-controlled in WebKit.

On June 2, 2008, the WebKit project announced they rewrote JavaScriptCore as &quot;SquirrelFish&quot;, a bytecode interpreter. The project evolved into SquirrelFish Extreme (abbreviated SFX), announced on September 18, 2008, which compiles JavaScript into native machine code, eliminating the need for a bytecode interpreter and thus speeding up JavaScript execution. Initially, the only supported processor architecture for SFX was the x86, but at the end of January 2009, SFX was enabled for macOS on x86-64 as it passes all tests on that platform.

===WebKit2===
On April 8, 2010, a project named WebKit2 was announced to redesign WebKit. Its goal was to abstract the components that provide web rendering cleanly from their surrounding interface or application shell, creating a situation where, &quot;web content (JavaScript, HTML, layout, etc) lives in a separate process from the application UI&quot;. This abstraction was intended to make reuse a more straightforward process for WebKit2 than for WebKit. WebKit2 had &quot;an incompatible API change from the original WebKit&quot;, which motivated its name change.

The WebKit2 targets were set to Linux, macOS, Windows, GTK, and MeeGo-Harmattan. Safari for macOS switched to the new API with version 5.1. Safari for iOS switched to WebKit2 with iOS 8.

The original WebKit API has been renamed WebKitLegacy API. WebKit2 API has been renamed just plain WebKit API.

== Use ==

WebKit is used as the rendering engine within Safari and was used by Google&#x27;s Chrome web browser on Windows, macOS, and Android (before version 4.4 KitKat). Chrome used only WebCore, and included its own JavaScript engine named V8 and a multiprocess system. Chrome for iOS continues to use WebKit because Apple requires that web browsers on that platform must do so. Other applications on macOS and iOS make use of WebKit, such as Apple&#x27;s e-mail client Mail, App Store, and the 2008 version of Microsoft&#x27;s Entourage personal information manager, both of which make use of WebKit to render HTML content.

=== Installed base ===
New web browsers have been built around WebKit such as the S60 browser on Symbian mobile phones, BlackBerry Browser (ver 6.0+), Midori, Chrome browser, the Android Web browser before version 4.4 KitKat, and the browser used in PlayStation 3 system software from version 4.10. KDE&#x27;s Rekonq web browser and Plasma Workspaces also use it as the native web rendering engine. WebKit has been adopted as the rendering engine in OmniWeb, iCab and Web (formerly named Epiphany) and Sleipnir, replacing their original rendering engines. GNOME&#x27;s Web supported both Gecko and WebKit for some time, but the team decided that Gecko&#x27;s release cycle and future development plans would make it too cumbersome to continue supporting it. webOS uses WebKit as the basis of its application runtime. WebKit is used to render HTML and run JavaScript in the Adobe Integrated Runtime application platform. In Adobe Creative Suite CS5, WebKit is used to render some parts of the user interface. As of the first half of 2010, an analyst estimated the cumulative number of mobile handsets shipped with a WebKit-based browser at 350 million. By mid-April 2015, WebKit browser market share was 50.3%.

=== Ports ===
The week after Hyatt announced WebKit&#x27;s open-sourcing, Nokia announced that it had ported WebKit to the Symbian operating system and was developing a browser based on WebKit for mobile phones running S60. Named Web Browser for S60, it was used on Nokia, Samsung, LG, and other Symbian S60 mobile phones. Apple has also ported WebKit to iOS to run on the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad, where it is used to render content in the device&#x27;s web browser and e-mail software. The Android mobile phone platform used WebKit (and later versions its Blink fork) as the basis of its web browser and the Palm Pre, announced January 2009, has an interface based on WebKit. The Amazon Kindle 3 includes an experimental WebKit based browser.

In June 2007, Apple announced that WebKit had been ported to Microsoft Windows as part of Safari. Although Safari for Windows was silently discontinued by the company, WebKit&#x27;s ports to Microsoft&#x27;s operating system are still actively maintained. The Windows port uses Apple&#x27;s proprietary libraries to function and is used for iCloud and iTunes for Windows, whereas the &quot;WinCairo&quot; port is a fully open-source and redistributable port.

WebKit has also been ported to several toolkits that support multiple platforms, such as the GTK toolkit for Linux, under the name &quot;WebKitGTK&quot; which is used by Eolie, GNOME Web, Adobe Integrated Runtime, Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL), and the Clutter toolkit. Qt Software included a WebKit port in the Qt 4.4 release as a module called QtWebKit (since superseded by Qt WebEngine, which uses Blink instead). The Iris Browser on Qt also used WebKit. The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries (EFL) port – EWebKit – was developed (by Samsung and ProFusion) focusing the embedded and mobile systems, for use as stand alone browser, widgets-gadgets, rich text viewer and composer. The Clutter port is developed by Collabora and sponsored by Robert Bosch GmbH.

There was also a project synchronized with WebKit (sponsored by Pleyo) called &quot;Origyn Web Browser&quot;, which provided a meta-port to an abstract platform with the aim of making porting to embedded or lightweight systems quicker and easier. This port is used for embedded devices such as set-top boxes, PMP and it has been ported into AmigaOS, AROS and MorphOS. MorphOS version 1.7 is the first version of Origyn Web Browser (OWB) supporting HTML5 media tags.

==== Web Platform for Embedded ====

Web Platform for Embedded (WPE) is a WebKit port designed for embedded applications; it further improves the architecture by splitting the basic rendering functional blocks into a general-purpose routines library (libwpe), platform backends, and engine itself (called WPE WebKit).
The GTK port, albeit self-contained, can be built to use these base libraries instead of its internal platform support implementation. The WPE port is currently maintained by Igalia.

=== Forking by Google ===
On April 3, 2013, Google announced that it would produce a fork of WebKit&#x27;s WebCore component, to be named Blink. Chrome&#x27;s developers decided on the fork to allow greater freedom in implementing WebCore&#x27;s features in the browser without causing conflicts upstream, and to allow simplifying its codebase by removing code for WebCore components unused by Chrome. In relation to Opera Software&#x27;s announcement earlier in the year that it would switch to WebKit by means of the Chromium codebase, it was confirmed that the Opera web browser would also switch to Blink. Following the announcement, WebKit developers began discussions on removing Chrome-specific code from the engine to streamline its codebase. WebKit no longer has any Chrome specific code (e.g., buildsystem, V8 JavaScript engine hooks, platform code, etc.).

== Components ==

=== WebCore ===
WebCore is a layout, rendering, and Document Object Model (DOM) library for HTML and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), developed by the WebKit project. Its full source code is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The WebKit framework wraps WebCore and JavaScriptCore, providing an Objective-C application programming interface to the C++-based WebCore rendering engine and JavaScriptCore script engine, allowing it to be easily referenced by applications based on the Cocoa API; later versions also include a cross-platform C++ platform abstraction, and various ports provide more APIs.

WebKit passes the Acid2 and Acid3 tests, with pixel-perfect rendering and no timing or smoothness issues on reference hardware.

=== JavaScriptCore ===
JavaScriptCore is a framework that provides a JavaScript engine for WebKit implementations, and provides this type of scripting in other contexts within macOS. JavaScriptCore is originally derived from KDE&#x27;s JavaScript engine (KJS) library (which is part of the KDE project) and the PCRE regular expression library. Since forking from KJS and PCRE, JavaScriptCore has been improved with many new features and greatly improved performance.

On June 2, 2008, the WebKit project announced they rewrote JavaScriptCore as &quot;SquirrelFish&quot;, a bytecode interpreter. The project evolved into SquirrelFish Extreme (abbreviated SFX, marketed as Nitro), announced on September 18, 2008 further speeding up JavaScript execution.

An optimizing just-in-time (JIT) compiler named &quot;FTL&quot; was announced on May 13, 2014. It uses LLVM to generate optimized machine code. &quot;FTL&quot; stands for &quot;Fourth-Tier-LLVM&quot;, and unofficially for faster-than-light, alluding to its speed. As of February 15, 2016, the backend of FTL JIT is replaced by &quot;Bare Bones Backend&quot; (or B3 for short).

<text>BBCode (&quot;Bulletin Board Code&quot;) is a lightweight markup language used to format messages in many Internet forum software. It was first introduced in 1998. The available &quot;tags&quot; of BBCode are usually indicated by square brackets (codice_1 and codice_2) surrounding a keyword, and are parsed before being translated into HTML.

==Tags==
== Implementation ==
BBCode is typically implemented by applying a series of regular expression string-replace operations upon the input. Because regular expressions are limited in analyzing the structure of text input, this has the artifact that any non-hierarchical BBCode input will be transformed into invalid non-hierarchical HTML without error.

Applying traditional parsing techniques is made difficult by ambiguities in the markup, such as in , where the input can either be interpreted as &quot;text&quot; quoted from someone called , or the bolded text &quot;text&quot; surrounded by and , i.e. codice_3.

<text>The Loup River (pronounced /lup/) is a tributary of the Platte River, approximately long, in central Nebraska in the United States. The river drains a sparsely populated rural agricultural area on the eastern edge of the Great Plains southeast of the Sandhills. The name of the river means &quot;wolf&quot; in French, named by early French trappers after the Skidi band of the Pawnee, whose name means &quot;Wolf People,&quot; and who lived along its banks. The river and its tributaries, including the North Loup, Middle Loup, and South Loup, are known colloquially as &quot;the Loups&quot;, comprising over 1800 mi (2900 km) of streams and draining approximately one-fifth of Nebraska.

==Course==
The river is formed in eastern Howard County, approximately northeast of St. Paul and north of Grand Island, by the confluence of the North Loup and Middle Loup rivers. It flows east-northeast, past Fullerton, where it is joined from the north by the Cedar River. It continues east-northeast roughly parallel to the Platte, past Genoa, separated from the Platte by approximately 15 mi (24 km). It joins the Platte from the northwest approximately southeast of Columbus.

A diversion dam southwest of Genoa diverts water to the Loup Canal to hydroelectric facilities in Monroe and then in Columbus. The canal then runs into the Platte a short distance below its confluence with the Loup.

<text>Saint Aubin-sur-Mer (, literally &quot;Saint Aubin on Sea&quot;) is a commune in the Calvados department, in northwestern France. Administratively, it is part of the arrondissement of Caen and the canton of Courseulles-sur-Mer. It is 2.1 km east of Bernières-sur-Mer, 4 km north of Douvres-la-Délivrande and 16 km north of Caen.

==History==
===Origins===

Up until July 1851, Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer was part of the commune of Langrune-sur-Mer. Upon its creation in 1851, by the will of Napoleon III , Saint-Aubin had a population of and Langrune . Nicknamed &quot;Queen of Iodine&quot;, at low tide its banks of seaside rocks expose, an air of iodine saturates the beaches, thanks to the bladder-fucus and kelp deposited there.

During the second half of the 19th century, the population of Saint-Aubin declined to the point that in 1901, there were only inhabitants. In July 1876, a train station was opened in Saint-Aubin along the Caen à la mer line, permitting the development of a sea resort. The 1920s brought the construction of its Rococo or Art Deco villas, and its 1800 m seawall (dam walk), today the seafront buildings open passages to the narrow alleys, where old fishermen&#x27;s houses are the watchful guardians of the past. Located in the heart of the Canadian and British D-Day beaches, the waterfront, to a large extent, did not suffer from the misdeeds of the war.

===D-Day===

At the beginning of the Battle of Normandy, the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division, commanded by Major General Rodney Keller, landed 15,000 Canadians and 9,000 British troops on the Calvados coast. Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, one of five Canadian landing sites. was located at the eastern end of Canada&#x27;s assigned landing sector of Juno Beach. On D-Day, the 8th Canadian Infantry (Assault) Brigade (Group) stormed the beach, landing The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment, the 10th Armoured Regiment (The Fort Garry Horse), and the guns of the 19th Canadian (Army) Field Regiment, RCA. The Canadians were met by about 100 defenders who garrisoned the town&#x27;s fortified &#x27;Resistance Nest&#x27;. The Germans were largely unaffected by the preparatory barrage, as such they were able to put up heavy resistance at the beach and in the town, for most of the day, as the Canadians pushed inland.

&quot;Widerstandnesten WN27&quot;, the &quot;Resistance Nest&quot; at Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer was a platoon sized position, incorporating reinforced concrete (&quot;Verstärkt Feltmessig&quot;: Vf Type 2) gun casemates, with additional observation and fighting positions, located to dominate exits off the beach, into the town. A tight and compact position on the western side of town, the fight to hold WN27 was commanded by &quot;Züg Führer&quot; (Acting Commander) Lieutenant Gustav Pflochsch - Kompanie 5. / Grenadier-Regiment 736./ Bataillon II. The crew-served weapon shelters were linked by both underground passages and a well-developed system of trenches. WN 27 additionally incorporated a battalion heavy mortar detachment, located directly behind the beach seawall. Several of the villas and houses, in the town, had been strengthened and fortified as additional fighting positions, and to locate site snipers. Approaches into the position were well protected by K.V. Gruppe Courseulles minefields.

The coastline at St Aubin-dur-Mer was low lying, and to its east were low cliffs for a mile and a half, with a sea wall along most of it. Offshore, eastwards were rocky outcrops parts of which were exposed at low tide: les Essarts de Langrune. Having survived a weakened beach bombardment programme, at 07h39, WN 27 began to take indirect fire from 105 mm self-propelled guns on LCT landing craft. Firing on the run in, 19th Canadian (Army) Field Regiment, RCA, forty-eight guns fired for 30 minutes, putting down a very effective concentration, landing its first battery at 09h10. Heavily mortared getting off the narrowed (tide) and congested beach, the first gun was in action at 09h20. Observation and reconnaissance parties reported finding few targets in the early stages, when there was much close fighting, in the town. With no relief, the position was then covered by fire from LCT (Rocket) at H -8 minutes and H -5 minutes and the two flanks enveloped by Hedgerow mortar barrage, from LCA(HR)s at H -3 minutes, intended to cut the wire entanglements and detonate the landmines, securing the approaches onto the crew fighting positions. Disrupting any attempt at recovery, WN 27 began to take direct fire from the DD tanks of C Squadron, 10th Canadian Armoured Regiment, The Fort Garry Horse, arriving by LCT at H-Hour (07h55 BST). ‘C’ Squadron landed and managed to give supporting fire from the beach.

Attacked from its left flank, WN 27 was assaulted by ‘B’ Company, The North Shore (New Brunswick) Regiment (OC Major R.B. Forbes) they landing just west of the town, at 08h10, it having the difficult task of clearing the strong-point. This as ‘A’ Company, (Major J.A.M.C. Naughton), landing at 08h10 hours, to its right, was to clear the beach-houses fronting the seawall. At H+45 with no beach exits, the reserve North Shore companies landing, Major Bray commanding C squadron of the Fort Garry Horse decided to advance through the minefield losing three tanks, but with Churchill AVREs, after a hard fight St Aubin was soon under control. &#x27;A&#x27; Company was clear of its planned objective by 09h48. Except for the strong-point, Saint Aubin was reported as &quot;neutralized (secure)&quot; at 11h15 and &quot;Neutralized (Cleared)&quot; – at 18h00. The North Shores landing at Nan Red lost nearly 50 men (dead and wounded) in the fight for WN 27.

Discussing the fire support to the landing at Saint Aubin-sur-Mer (NAN Red), a debate began, in late June 1944, as to who was not entirely effective in supporting the North Shores and the Fort Garry’s, on 6 June.

*‘On the left battalion front (St. Aubin-sur-Mer) neither the RAF heavy bombers, the rockets, nor the self-propelled artillery actually covered the main strong point and the North Shore Regiment engaged it without the assistance of heavier arms until sometime later. A considerable time was therefore spent in reducing it.’ Brigadier K.C. Blackader, MC, ED, Commander 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade:24 June 1944.
*From H-40 to H, the three Fleet ‘V’ Class Destroyers, of Assault Group J2, HMS Vigilant (R93), HMCS Algonquin (R17) and HMCS Sioux did not fire, as planned in support of the two 8 CIB landings. Controlled by HMS Kempenfelt (Flag - Captain Assault Group J2), The Beach Drenching Fire Programme, set out to ensure indirect naval gunfire was delivered to the right beach, at the right time, was changed, as the St Aubin and Bernières landings took place.
*When 8th Canadian Infantry Brigade put H Hour back by ten minutes, this apparently caused a delay in the opening of fire of the SP artillery, as six batteries had to adjust their firing tables. However, Brigade HQ reported that Bernières and St Aubin received ‘a terrific pounding’, this before all SP artillery fire switched to St Aubin. At the time, the cause was thought to be the strong current making navigation and station keeping difficult, as SP guns had a limited traverse, the LCT itself had to be aimed, the current caused all craft to point at St Aubin. A later report suggested a technical problem with the control craft observing and controlling fire on Bernières, so control was transferred to the craft off St Aubin and all fire concentrated there. Whatever the cause it was Bernières (Nan White), that did not receive the full (beach) barrage as planned.

==Literary associations==
* Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer is the setting of Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;Red Cotton Night-Cap Country&quot;, where it is renamed Saint-Rambert.
* In this picturesque seaside town Émile Zola wrote his novel about the underbelly of Paris society, &quot;L&#x27;Assommoir&quot;. It turned him into a literary star. More here plus pics.

==Activities==
* Every summer in the middle of August, Saint-Aubin hosts a week-long festival called &quot;La semaine acadienne&quot;, composed of concerts by musical groups from Acadia, a Tintamarre, an open-air ball, exhibitions, documentary film showings, etc. The festival also pays tribute to the Acadian soldiers of the &quot;North Shore Regiment&quot; of New Brunswick who landed on the beach of Saint-Aubin on June 6, 1944.

==International relations==
The commune is twinned with:
*Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada - many soldiers that died in Saint-Aubin were from there
*Emsworth in Hampshire, England

<text>In computing, uClibc (sometimes written μClibc) is a small C standard library intended for Linux kernel-based operating systems for embedded systems and mobile devices. uClibc was written to support μClinux, a version of Linux not requiring a memory management unit and thus suited for microcontrollers (uCs; the &quot;u&quot; is a Latin script typographical approximation - not a proper romanization, which would be letter &quot;m&quot; - of μ for &quot;micro&quot;).

Development on uClibc started around 1999. uClibc was mostly written from scratch, but has incorporated code from glibc and other projects. The project lead is Erik Andersen, and the other main contributor is Manuel Novoa III. Licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, uClibc is free and open-source software.

uClibc is much smaller than the glibc, the C library normally used with Linux distributions. While glibc is intended to fully support all relevant C standards across a wide range of hardware and kernel platforms, uClibc is specifically focused on embedded Linux systems. Features can be enabled or disabled according to space requirements.

uClibc runs on standard and MMU-less Linux systems. It supports i386, x86-64, ARM (big/little endian), Atmel AVR32, Analog Devices Blackfin, Renesas/Hitachi H8 (h8300), Motorola m68k, MIPS (big/little endian), IBM PowerPC, SuperH (big/little endian), Sun SPARC, and Renesas/NEC v850 processors.

uClibc-ng is a fork of uClibc announced on the OpenWRT mailing list in July 2014 after more than two years had passed without a uClibc release, citing a lack of any communication from the maintainer. At present, the original project&#x27;s author no longer publishes updates, but refers to the still actively developed fork uClibc-ng for current releases.

<doc id="689541" wikidata="Q7849447" url="?curid=689541" title="Tsawwassen">
<text>Tsawwassen ( ) is a suburban, mostly residential community on a peninsula in the southwestern corner of the City of Delta in British Columbia, Canada. It provides the only road access to the American territory on the southern tip of the peninsula, the community of Point Roberts, Washington, via 56th Street. It is also the location of Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal, part of the BC Ferries, built in 1959 to provide foot-passenger and motor vehicle access from the Lower Mainland to the southern part of Vancouver Island and the southern Gulf Islands. Because Tsawwassen touches a shallow bank (Roberts Bank), the ferry terminal is built at the southwestern end of a causeway (part of Highway 17) that juts into the Strait of Georgia. Boundary Bay Airport, a major training hub for local and international pilots which also provides local airplane and helicopter service, is ten minutes away. The Roberts Bank Superport is also nearby.

To the northwest of the community are the lands of Tsawwassen First Nation (&quot;TFN&quot;), a people of Coast Salish ancestry who have used this land since at least 200 B.C. Having been &quot;stripped of their lands, rights and resources&quot; by European colonizers throughout the 19th century, and in accordance with a 2009 treaty with British Columbia, their territory now consists of approximately of treaty settlement land, bounded by the Strait of Georgia on the west, the 2600 block to the north, the 4800 block to the east, and the 1200 block to the south. While also part of TFN lands, the 92-lot residential subdivision of Stahaken was leased for use by the (then) Tsawwassen Indian Reserve to Staheken Developments Ltd. in 1989 for a 99-year term. It was then developed in a partnership between Stahaken Development Ltd. and the Municipality of Delta. As such it is commonly thought of and serviced in the same manner as other subdivisions in the community of Tsawwassen. Stahaken residents are represented by the Stahaken Homeowners Association.

==Etymology==
&quot;Tsawwassen&quot; is derived from the Halkomelem word , meaning &quot;land facing the sea&quot;.

==Location==
Tsawwassen is on the northern end of a peninsula flanked by the Strait of Georgia to the west and Boundary Bay to the east. Boundary Bay is an important stopover for migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway. Tsawwassen has recreational access to Boundary Bay at Centennial Park, and there is an extensive bike/foot path along the edge of the bay, known as the Dyke.

Tsawwassen&#x27;s southern boundary is the Canada–United States border, following the 49th parallel north. To the north, its nearest neighbour is the town of Ladner, which is also part of the City of Delta. Together, Ladner and Tsawwassen make up the area known as South Delta. Ladner is the site of the Delta Municipal Hall. Both the police station and hospital serve Ladner and Tsawwassen.

Tsawwassen&#x27;s lowest elevation is just below sea level, and its highest is at at the Point Roberts border near 56th Street.

==History==
Tsawwassen and surrounding lands are the ancestral home, and traditional lands, of the Tsawwassen First Nation, a Coast Salish people, who may have lived in the area for over 4,200 years, the age of the oldest archeological site found on English Bluff. Eight prehistoric villages have been unearthed there.

The first group of Europeans to see Tsawwassen was the expedition of Spanish explorer José María Narváez in 1791. Narvaez named the Point Roberts peninsula &quot;Isla de Zepeda&quot; and wrote that &quot;there is an incredible quantity of rich salmon and numerous Indians... They speak an entirely different language.&quot;

==Transportation==
Tsawwassen is arranged in a grid, with streets running north–south and east–west. Running east–west are the avenues, with 1st Avenue closest to the Canada–US border. Running north–south, the streets follow the grid laid out for the municipality of Delta, part of the greater street grid set out by the British Royal Engineers in the 19th century.

Tsawwassen main arterial street is 56th Street, which connects Highway 17 with the exclave of Point Roberts, in Washington, U.S. (where it becomes Tyee Drive). It runs through the main commercial area, centred at the intersection of 12th Avenue with 56th Street. This border crossing is the westernmost on the 49th parallel between Canada and the USA.

Tsawwassen is served by buses from TransLink. Four primary bus routes serve the main bus loop at the South Delta Exchange next to the South Delta Recreation Centre, where many terminate at Bridgeport Station in Richmond: Routes 602, 603, and 604 operate during rush hour and connect directly to Bridgeport Station, whereas Route 601 operates all day/all week, and is routed past Tsawwassen Mills and through Ladner.

Route 620 connects the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal to the Ladner Exchange and, ultimately, Bridgeport Station.

Local community routes in Tsawwassen are handled by Route 609 (Tsawwassen First Nation), Route 614 (English Bluff and Beach Grove during non-peak periods), and Route 619 (Boundary Bay).

Tsawwassen is also home to the Tsawwassen Ferry Terminal, part of BC Ferries. Ferries go to the following destinations:

==Holidays and events==

Since 2001, Tsawwassen has played an integral part of the Tour de Delta, one-day bicycle races that take place over a July weekend (The White Spot / Delta Road Race for men since 2001; and the women&#x27;s since 2011). The weekend culminates in a race from North Delta through Ladner to Tsawwassen, where men and women do various laps around Tsawwassen&#x27;s perimeter until finishing in either Diefenbaker or Winskill Park. The race grows in popularity and coverage each year.

The Tsawwassen / Boundary Bay chapter of Lions Clubs International runs a Sunday car lot in the east parking lot of Town Centre Mall, which donates the space. People selling their cars park them in the lot, where they can be seen by locals and people passing through on the way to Point Roberts. Dozens of cars and hundreds of shoppers now come from all over the Lower Mainland each Sunday.

In keeping with its reputation as the sunniest spot in the Greater Vancouver Region, every year on the August long weekend (for B.C. Day) Tsawwassen hosts the Sun Festival, which usually includes a parade, a live music, and a variety of activities such as children&#x27;s games, food tents, and sporting events. There is usually a theme for each year&#x27;s event, and attendees are encouraged to dress accordingly.

==Neighbourhoods==

*Boundary Bay, a quiet beach-side neighbourhood situated on Boundary Bay between Boundary Bay Regional Park and the Canada–U.S. border. It originated in the 1890s as a seaside summer community for wealthy Vancouverites. Some of the original cottages still stand, many as renovated and updated homes, as well as modern contemporary single family homes and waterfront architectural residences. To the south, &quot;The Bay&quot; as it is referred to by residents, borders on the residential neighbourhood of Maple Beach in Point Roberts, WA. A Canada/U.S. customs checkpoint joined the two communities (at the foot of 67th Street) until it was closed in the 1970s. Currently, Boundary Bay Road as well as the newly opened Southlands boulevard provide the only two access routes to this area.
* The Southlands, which is a new neighbourhood centred around original barns, historic farm house, grange, and small shops extends from the Boundary Bay Rd and 3rd Ave roundabout ultimately to the USA border. It is bounded on the east by Boundary Bay community and to the west and north by protected farmland.
*Beach Grove, which is situated on the edge of Boundary Bay, further north from the community of Boundary Bay. It is located on the east side of 56th Street, between 12th and 17A Avenue.
*The Highlands, which is the area just to the northwest of Downtown Tsawwassen, behind the Town Centre Mall and situated around Highland Park.
*Pebble Hill, which is the area surrounding Diefenbaker Park and Pebble Hill Park.
*Tsawwassen Heights, a small area located on English Bluff Road, south of 1st Ave. Two totem poles stand on either side of the road here as its official gateway.
*The Terrace, a terraced subdivision located between 56th Street, the Tsawwassen Nature Reserve, and the Canada–U.S. border.
*English Bluff, which refers to the area along English Bluff Road, where many of the most expensive homes in the community enjoy commanding ocean views.
*Stahaken, which refers to a large area of houses built on land belonging to the Tsawwassen First Nations. This land is leased on a 99-year term to Stahaken Development Ltd., and supported and serviced by the Municipality of Delta. The current lease expires in 2089.
*The Village; adjacent to Stahaken, it is a wealthy subdivision built on the west side of English Bluff Road, overlooking the Strait of Georgia. Another totem pole stands at its entrance at Wesley Drive.
*Tsatsu Shores, a large apartment complex beneath English Bluff, on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. This is also built on land leased from the Tsawwassen First Nation.
*Imperial Village, a large subdivision located east of 52nd Street at 16th Avenue.
*Forest-by-the-Bay, which refers to a housing development off 56th Street and 6th Avenue beside Tsawwassen&#x27;s only cemetery.
*Tsawwassen Springs, a small subdivision within the centre of the Tsawwassen Golf &amp; Country Club.

==Schools==
Public schools in Tsawwassen are part of School District 37 Delta. Tsawwassen has only one public high school, South Delta Secondary School (SDSS), formerly South Delta Senior Secondary.

There are five public elementary schools in Tsawwassen. These are Cliff Drive, Pebble Hill, South Park, English Bluff, and Beach Grove. A sixth school, Boundary Beach (Grades K-3), closed in June 2009. There is also a small French programme cadre school, Ecole Du Bois-Joli, for students with French language spoken at home.

Boundary Bay Elementary School, formerly located on 56th Street south of 12th Avenue, served grades K-7. With usually one class per grade, it was a small school, and shared a principal with Boundary Beach Elementary School. Grades 3–7 students from Boundary Beach were bussed daily to attend the school. The school was closed in the early 1990s, and the land sold. It is now a residential development. There was also a middle school called Tsawwassen Junior Secondary (TJS), but low enrolment led to its closure in 1994. This land was also sold by the school district and re-developed into a housing subdivision.

Private schools in the Tsawwassen area include Southpointe Academy, a private K–12 school; Delta Christian School in Ladner, a Christian private school offering grades K-8; and Sacred Heart Elementary in Ladner, a Catholic school offering grades K-7.

==Parks==
Tsawwassen contains many community and regional parks; Boundary Bay Regional Park (home to Centennial Beach) is run by the Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD). The following parks are maintained by Delta Parks &amp; Recreation, an arm of the municipal government:
*Diefenbaker Park – located at the intersection of 56th Street and 1st Avenue, named after former Canadian prime minister John Diefenbaker in 1976, prior to the park&#x27;s completion in 1980. One of the largest parks in the area, it has many features – open spaces and large hills, a waterfall, dock, and pond, a very large forest, playgrounds, restrooms, and many gardens. The steep grade from the surrounding streets into the centre of the park makes it especially popular during Tsawwassen&#x27;s rare snow falls, for sledding and tobogganing. In Summer 2011, the Rotary WaterWorks Playground was built. This water playground was created with environmentally friendly materials. The WaterWorks project was a collaborative partnership of the Corporation of Delta (now the City of Delta) and the Rotary Club of Tsawwassen. The concept draws on the history of the site, a former gravel mining operation that, at one time, supplied much of the gravel for the development of Tsawwassen.
*Pebble Hill Park – located west of 52nd Street between 2A Avenue and Milsom Wynd. This park features large fields used for sports (baseball and soccer), tennis courts built atop a pair of water reservoirs, and many forest trails.
*Fred Gingell Park – Tsawwassen&#x27;s newest park, located on English Bluff Road just south of 3rd Avenue. It is named after the former MLA who represented South Delta in BC&#x27;s legislative assembly. Built on a BC Hydro right-of-way, this park sits on the top of a high bluff overlooking the Strait of Georgia, the ferry terminal, and Vancouver Island. An observation deck is built on this bluff, and a stairway and trail have been built down the bluff to Tsawwassen Beach below. It is the first (and only) public access to the beach, creating controversy as semi-private beach access contributed a great deal to the area&#x27;s property values. Locals, who hike up and down the steep stairs for fitness (often multiple times), often refer to the stairs leading down to the beach as the &quot;Tsawwassen Grind&quot; in reference to the Grouse Grind.
*Winskill Park – located at 56th Street and 9th Avenue, named after the land&#x27;s donor and one of the first families to live in Tsawwassen. This is Tsawwassen&#x27;s all-purpose sports park, featuring numerous baseball diamonds, soccer fields, and field hockey fields. A fenced artificial-turf outdoor soccer field was completed in 2007. Also features a walking trail, disc golf course, restrooms, youth centre, playground, and the Winskill Aquatic Centre.
*Dennison Park – located across from the high school at the corner of 53rd Street and 7A Avenue. This park used to feature an outdoor pool, but is now primarily used as a sports park for the high school football team. Also used for soccer and baseball. A forest grows on the northern half of the park.
*Village Park – a very small community park located on Wesley Drive at Skana Drive. Mostly green space, but also features a playground.
*Brandrith Park – another sports park, adjacent to Cliff Drive Elementary school, at the corner of 12th Avenue and Winskill Drive. The focus here is primarily on its baseball diamond, but a soccer field and tennis courts are present as well. A forest can be found to the rear of the park; a large playground can be found at the adjacent schoolyard.
*Highland Park – mostly open green space with a light forest, located at the corner of 55th Street and 13A Avenue, in the heart of downtown Tsawwassen.
*Grauer Park – another heavily used park, located at 56th Street and 18th Avenue. Greenspace here is minimal. The park is best known as home to the South Delta Rec Centre (featuring an ice rink, curling rink, and gymnasium). The Kiwanis Longhouse (once the South Delta library) is in this park, and is now an art gallery. Also featured here is parking for the Tsawwassen Park and Ride, the Tsawwassen Skate Park, and a lacrosse box.
*Jackson Way Park – a grassy greenspace, found at the southern end of Jackson Way.
*Beach Grove Park – mostly forest, found at the corner of Braid Road and 17A Avenue, adjacent to Beach Grove Elementary school. This park once featured a giant checker board and checker pieces visitors could play with. Also features tennis courts.
*Imperial Park – an open field underneath the BC Hydro right-of-way in Imperial Village, at the corner of Spyglass Crescent and Silverado Place. Features a baseball diamond, playground, and a decent hill used for sledding/tobogganing in the winter.
*Beach Grove Mini-Park – a very small community park on Beach Grove Court, featuring a small playground.
*View Crescent Park – a very small greenspace joining the southeast corner of View Crescent with the north end of Hunter Road, located behind a commercial complex in downtown Tsawwassen.

The following parks aren&#x27;t officially recognized by the municipality, but still exist within Tsawwassen&#x27;s boundaries:
*Wildwood Crescent Mini-Park
*Woodland Park
*Tsawwassen Nature Reserve

==Historic street names==

*1st Avenue – Summer Avenue
*2nd Avenue (English Bluff Road to approx Murphy Drive) – Autumn Avenue
*4th Avenue (52 Street to 56 Street) – Rawlins Road
*6th Avenue – Allen Road
*8th Avenue – Cemetery Road

*56th Street (28 Ave to 12 Ave)
*12th Avenue (56 Street to Beach Grove Road)
From here, this connects with the segment of road that has always been known as Boundary Bay Road.

In the neighbourhood of Boundary Bay, virtually every numbered street here was historically named something else:

*3rd Avenue (Boundary Bay Road to Centennial Parkway) – Gunn Road
*4th Avenue – Montgomery Road
*65B Street – Jordan Road
*66 Street – Mack Avenue
*66A Street – Old Cammidge Avenue
*67 Street – Major Avenue
*67A Street – Alexander Avenue

==Telecommunications==

Tsawwassen, like the whole of the Municipality of Delta, was initially only serviced by Delta Cable (since sold to Eastlink) for TV and cable internet services, although Shaw and Telus now offer services as well.

As in all of British Columbia, incumbent telephone services is provided by Telus; the area codes serving Tsawwassen are 604 and 778 – though the latter is primarily used for cell phones. The original CO Code servicing Tsawwassen was 943, but as the population expanded, a new code, 948, was introduced in the early 1990s. New codes have since been added, and local number portability has blurred traditional exchange differences. Phone calls within Tsawwassen or the entire 604/778 region must adhere to the process of ten-digit dialing.

==Retail==

Tsawwassen is home to the largest shopping centre in South Delta (Tsawwassen Town Centre Mall). In 2016 a new commercial business complex, Northgate, was completed, and construction began on the Southlands Market Square project; both developments of Century Group.

Tsawwassen Mills opened in October 2016 in the neighbouring municipality of Tsawwassen First Nation, located to the west of Tsawwassen, Delta, BC.

==Climate==
Tsawwassen is known for its relatively dry and sunny climate compared with other locations in Metro Vancouver. For example, it receives nearly 40% ( from 1981 to 2010) less precipitation than downtown Vancouver ( at Vancouver Harbour CS from 1971 to 2000) and just over half of that of North Vancouver ( at North Vancouver 2nd Narrows from 1981 to 2010). It has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) with cooler summers and milder winters than other areas on the Canada–U.S. border, and features some of the mildest winters and lowest diurnal temperature variation in Canada.

<doc id="689549" wikidata="Q1117936" url="?curid=689549" title="Music of the Heart">
<text>Music of the Heart is a 1999 American biographical musical drama film directed by Wes Craven and written by Pamela Gray, based on the 1995 documentary &quot;Small Wonders&quot;. A dramatization of the true story of Roberta Guaspari, portrayed by Meryl Streep, who co-founded the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music and fought for music education funding in New York City public schools, the film also stars Aidan Quinn, Angela Bassett, Gloria Estefan in her film debut, Jane Leeves, Kieran Culkin and Jay O. Sanders. It was Craven&#x27;s sole mainstream cinematic film not in the horror or thriller genre, and also his only film to receive Oscar nominations.

==Plot==

In 1981 New York City, violinist Roberta Guaspari has recently divorced her U.S. Navy officer husband Charles Demetras, who has instead decided to pursue a romantic relationship with a friend of hers named Lana Holden. Encouraged by her mother Assunta to return to the workforce for the sake of her two sons Alexi and Nicholas, Guaspari attempts to rebuild her life and reconnects with a former classmate named Brian Turner while working as a gift-wrapper at a department store; recalling her childhood love for playing the violin, he arranges for her to be introduced to Janet Williams, the head teacher and principal of East Harlem&#x27;s Central Park East School. Despite having little experience in actual music teaching, she accepts a substitute violin teaching position at Central Park East, even supplying 50 child-size violins she purchased while living in Greece, where her husband was based. With a combination of her toughness and determination, she inspires a group of children, and their initially skeptical parents. The program slowly develops and attracts publicity, eventually expanding to Central Park East II and River East Schools.

Ten years later, the Central Park East, Central Park East II and River East School string programs work with the New York City Board of Education to help eliminate funding for the programs, which leads to Guaspari&#x27;s early dismissal. Determined to fight the budget cuts, she enlists the support of former pupils, parents and teachers, and over the next two years, she plans a benefit concert, Fiddlefest, to raise money so that the program can continue. However, a few weeks before the concert, and with all participants furiously rehearsing, they lose the venue. However, Arnold Steinhardt, a violinist in the Guarneri Quartet and the husband of a publicist friend, enlists the support of other well-known musicians, including Isaac Stern and Itzhak Perlman. They arrange for the concert to be mounted at Carnegie Hall. On the day of Fiddlefest, Guaspari and her students perform with Perlman, Steinhardt, Stern, Mark O&#x27;Connor, Michael Tree, Charles Veal Jr., Karen Briggs, Sandra Park, Diane Monroe, and Joshua Bell, increasing donations and making the event a massive success.

The epilogue explains that following the events of the film, the $250,000 in proceeds from the concert supported Guaspari&#x27;s program for three years, during which she and her supporters continued to fund her work through benefit concerts and donations to their private foundation, the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music; Community School District 4 assisted as permitted by its limited resources. Eventually, her violin program was officially reinstated during the production of the film. In addition, she still teaches in East Harlem, where she lives with her daughter Sophia, whom she adopted from El Salvador in 1991. Her eldest son Nicholas has become a professional cellist in a graduate music program, and her youngest son Alexi has been accepted to medical school. Opus 118, which hopes to expand its outreach to more children, remains dependent on the generosity of its donors.

==Cast==
Itzhak Perlman, Arnold Steinhardt, Isaac Stern, Mark O&#x27;Connor, Michael Tree, Charles Veal Jr., Karen Briggs, Sandra Park, Diane Monroe, and Joshua Bell all cameo as themselves in the film&#x27;s recreation of the Carnegie Hall benefit concert (at which all were actually present).

==Production==
Roberta Guaspari and the Opus 118 Harlem School of Music was featured in the 1995 documentary film &quot;Small Wonders&quot;, which was later nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. After seeing &quot;Small Wonders&quot;, Wes Craven, known for his work on horror films, was inspired to make a full-length film about Guaspari. Immediately following a phenomenally successful preview screening of &quot;Scream&quot;, Miramax co-founders Harvey and Bob Weinstein offered him a three-picture deal via Dimension Films; two of the films would be in the horror genre, while the third film would be a &quot;petticoat film&quot;, a costume drama for which the Weinsteins were known at the time. Craven, both a former teacher and a fan of classical music, chose to pursue &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; as his &quot;petticoat film&quot;, explaining, &quot;It’s sort of a culmination of almost 30 years trying to do something outside of the genre. Not because I don’t like the genre, but because I’m a person … an artist who wants to do a lot of different things. Just never before has that opportunity been presented.&quot;

Madonna was originally signed to play the role of Guaspari, but left the project before filming began, citing &quot;creative differences&quot; with Craven. When she left, Madonna had already studied for many months to play the violin. Meryl Streep, who replaced Madonna at the last minute at Craven&#x27;s insistence, learned to play Bach&#x27;s Concerto for 2 Violins for the film; given six weeks of preparation in order to play the violin, she described, &quot;I had to beg them to give me some more time for the violin part of it.&quot; Aside from having the daunting task of learning the violin while acting like a professional, she also found the burden of playing a real person to be particularly challenging, explaining, &quot;Playing a real person carries with it a whole other set of responsibilities than you would have when creating a fictional character. So, I did as much research as I could and then I just sort of threw it away because I can’t think of the real Roberta. I had to make it our Roberta, our movie Roberta. The real woman is a sizable phenomenon of energy, inspiration, hard work, irascibility. I tried to capture little parts of her and put it together in the film.&quot;

==Critical reception==
The film received an overall mixed reception, though many reviews tended to be slightly positive. Most critics applauded Meryl Streep&#x27;s portrayal of Roberta Guaspari. The film has a 63% approval rating from Rotten Tomatoes based on 90 critical reviews; the consensus explains, &quot;Meryl Streep&#x27;s depiction of an ordinary person doing extraordinary things transcends, inspires, and entertains.&quot; CinemaScore reported that audiences gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

Critic Eleanor Ringel Gillespie of the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; concluded that &quot;There are more challenging movies around. More original ones, too. But &quot;Music of the Heart&quot; gets the job done, efficiently and entertainingly.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four and wrote that &quot;Meryl Streep is known for her mastery of accents; she may be the most versatile speaker in the movies. Here you might think she has no accent, unless you&#x27;ve heard her real speaking voice; then you realize that Guaspari&#x27;s speaking style is no less a particular achievement than Streep&#x27;s other accents. This is not Streep&#x27;s voice, but someone else&#x27;s - with a certain flat quality, as if later education and refinement came after a somewhat unsophisticated childhood.&quot;

Steve Rosen said that &quot;The key to Meryl Streep&#x27;s fine performance is that she makes Guaspari unheroically ordinary. Ultimately that makes her even more extraordinary.&quot;

In 2014, the film was one of several discussed by Keli Goff in &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; in an article concerning white savior narratives in film.

===Box office===
The film opened at #5 at the North American box office making $3.6 million in its opening weekend.

<text>The Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) is a regional repertory theatre in Ashland, Oregon, United States, founded in 1935 by Angus L. Bowmer. The Festival now offers matinee and evening performances of a wide range of classic and contemporary plays not limited to Shakespeare. During the Festival, between five and eleven plays are offered in daily rotation six days a week in its three theatres. It welcomed its millionth visitor in 1971, its 10-millionth in 2001, and its 20-millionth visitor in 2015.

==Overview==
 The Oregon Shakespeare Festival (OSF) is a regional repertory theatre in Ashland, Oregon, United States, founded in 1935 by Angus L. Bowmer. From late April through December each year, the Festival now offers 800 to 850 matinee and evening performances of a wide range of classic and contemporary plays not limited to Shakespeare to a total annual audience of nearly 400,000. The Festival welcomed its millionth visitor in 1971, its 10-millionth in 2001, and its 20-millionth visitor in 2015. At any given time between five and eleven plays are offered in daily rotation six days a week in its three theatres.

Each year, two or three plays are staged in the outdoor Allen Elizabethan Theatre, two or three in the intimate Thomas Theatre, and four or five in the traditional Angus Bowmer Theatre. OSF has completed the entire Shakespeare canon of 37 plays in 1958, 1978, 1997, and 2016. Since 1960, it has also offered non-Shakespearean plays. Since 2000 there has been at least one new work each season from playwrights such as Octavio Solis and Robert Schenkkan, several of which have gone on to other venues and numerous awards (see below). A complete list by year and theatre is available here: Production history of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. OSF also provides a broad range of educational programs for middle schools, high schools, college students, teachers, and theatre professionals.

==History==
In 1893, the residents of Ashland built a facility to host Chautauqua events. In its heyday, it accommodated audiences of 1,500 for appearances by the likes of John Philip Sousa and William Jennings Bryan during annual 10-day seasons.

In 1917, a new domed structure was built at the site, but it fell into disrepair after the Chautauqua movement died out in the 1920s. In 1935, the similarity of the remaining wall of the then-roofless Chautauqua building to Elizabethan theatres inspired Southern Oregon University drama professor Angus L. Bowmer to propose using it to present plays by Shakespeare. Ashland city leaders loaned him a sum &quot;not to exceed $400&quot; (approximately ) to present two plays as part of the city&#x27;s Independence Day celebration. However, they pressed Bowmer to add boxing matches to cover the expected deficit. Bowmer agreed, feeling such an event was in perfect keeping with the bawdiness of Elizabethan theatre. The Works Progress Administration helped construct a makeshift Elizabethan stage on the Chautauqua site, and confidently billing it as the &quot;First Annual Oregon Shakespearean Festival&quot;, Bowmer presented &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; on July 2 and July 4, 1935, and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; on July 3, directing and playing the lead roles in both plays himself. Reserved seats cost $1, with general admission of $.50 for adults and $.25 for children (approximately equivalent to $, $, and $ in 2019). Ironically, the profit from the plays covered the losses the boxing matches incurred.
The Festival has continued ever since (excepting 1941–1946 while Bowmer served in World War II and most of 2020 and 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). It quickly developed a reputation for quality productions. Angus Bowmer&#x27;s first wife Lois served as art director, creating both costumes and scenery during the formative years of the Festival from 1935 to 1940. In 1939, OSF took a production of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; to the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco that was nationally broadcast on radio. The lead actress, learning at the last minute the broadcast would be to a national audience, suffered a panic attack, was rushed to the hospital, and the stand-in took over. The scripts didn&#x27;t arrive on the set until three minutes before air time. The Festival achieved widespread national recognition when, from 1951 to 1973, under the direction of Andrew C. Love (1894–1987), NBC broadcast abbreviated performances each year that were carried by more than 100 stations nationally and, after 1954, on Armed Forces Radio and Radio Free Europe. The programs won favorable reviews from critics that drew audiences to the Festival from around the country. The programs led &quot;Life&quot; magazine to do a story on the Festival in 1957, bringing even more people to the plays. The NBC programs and the subsequent attention go a long way to explaining how a tiny out-of-the-way timber town in the Northwest became a theatrical and tourist Mecca.

Angus L. Bowmer retired in 1971, and leadership of the Festival passed to Jerry Turner, who widened the Festival repertory to production of classics by the likes of Molière, Ibsen, and Chekhov. When Turner retired in 1991, actor/director Henry Woronicz took control through 1996. OSF then recruited Libby Appel from the highly respected Indiana Repertory Theatre. She served as Artistic Director from 1996 through 2007. Bill Rauch succeeded Libby Appel as Artistic Director, serving from 2008 to 2019. He incorporated musicals and non-western plays into the annual selection, and sought connections between classic plays and contemporary concerns. He also started the Black Swan Lab in which 15–20 OSF actors developed new works for the stage. Inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s 37 plays, Rauch also initiated a 10-year program to commission up to 37 new plays collectively called American Revolutions: The United States History Cycle, 32 of which have been commissioned and ten of these have reached the stage, several to great acclaim including Tony awards. Nataki Garrett was selected to be the next artistic director in April of 2019, with 2020 to be her first full season.

Bing Crosby served as an honorary director of the Festival from 1949 to 1951. Charles Laughton visited in 1961, saying &quot;I have just seen the four best productions of Shakespeare that I have ever seen in my life.&quot; Laughton begged to play King Lear, but died in 1962 before he could fulfill the dream. Stacy Keach was a cast member in 1962 and 1963. Duke Ellington and his orchestra presented a benefit concert in 1966 that brought many luminaries to Ashland.

1952 saw the birth of a tradition following the curtain call ending the last outdoor play of each season. Company members, not just actors, each carrying a candle, silently enter the darkened theatre to the traditional English folk tune Greensleeves. A company member selected for the honor speaks Prospero&#x27;s words from Act IV Scene I of the Tempest beginning, &quot;Our revels now are ended. These our actors, As I foretold you, were all spirits and Are melted into air, into thin air…&quot; On completion of the speech, all extinguish the flames and file silently out of the theatre.

The tradition of opening the outdoor season with a Feast of Will (originally the Feasting of the Tribe of Will) was initiated in 1956 in Lithia Park with Miss Oregon and then-state senator Mark Hatfield attending.

The City of Portland approached OSF in the late 1970s about joining the art scene there, leading to the building of a new center in Portland. In 1986, OSF was again approached about producing in the new Portland Center for the Performing Arts, leading to the launch in November 1988 of a season of five plays including Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;, the first of four productions that transferred to or from Ashland. At the invitation of the City of Portland, OSF established a resident theatre in the Portland Center for the Performing Arts in 1988. It became independent in 1994 as Portland Center Stage. Those six seasons ran November–April, allowing many OSF company members to work in both cities. In 1990–1991 Portland imported rotating repertory from OSF, a company of 10 actors performing 43 roles.

In 1986, the OSF received the President&#x27;s Volunteer Action Award; in 1987 it initiated Daedalus, a fundraiser to help victims of HIV/AIDS that has continued annually ever since.
A second theatre, the indoor Angus Bowmer Theatre (see below), opened in 1970, enabling OSF to expand its season into the spring and fall; within a year, attendance tripled to 150,000. By 1976, the festival was filling 99% of its seats while offering some 275 performances of eight plays each season. In 1977, the Festival opened a third theatre, dubbed the Black Swan (see below), in what originally was an auto dealership, and attendance reached 300,000. By 1979, the year Bowmer died, the Festival was offering the now customary 11 plays a season.

In 1983 OSF won both its first Tony Award for outstanding achievement in regional theatre and the National Governors&#x27; Association Award for its distinguished service to the arts, the first ever to a performing arts organization. In 1988, the Oregon Shakespearean Festival was renamed the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

In 1997, the OSF-commissioned &quot;The Magic Fire&quot; was presented at the John F. Kennedy Center and named by &quot;Time&quot; among the year&#x27;s best plays. In 2002, the Thomas Theatre (see below) replaced the Black Swan as the venue for intimate or experimental productions in a Black box theatre. In 2003, &quot;Time&quot; named OSF as the second best regional theatre in the United States (Chicago&#x27;s Goodman Theater was first).

The Festival opened the 2020 season on February 28 with performances of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Peter and the Starcatcher&quot;, and &quot;The Copper Children&quot; in the Angus Bowmer Theatre. &quot;Bring Down the House&quot; (a two-part adaptation of Shakespeare’s Henry VI plays) was presented in the Thomas Theatre. However, on March 11 the Covid-19 pandemic forced closing of OSF for the rest of the season.

With the pandemic seeming to moderate, the Shakespeare Festival announced an April to December schedule of live performances for 2022 as follows. &quot;Once on This Island&quot; in the Angus Bowmer Theatre, &quot;unseen&quot; in the Thomas Theatre, &quot;How I Learned What I Learned&quot;, in the Angus Bowmer Theatre, &quot;The Tempest&quot; in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre, &quot;Revenge Song&quot; in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre, &quot;King John&quot; in the Angus Bowmer Theatre, &quot;Confederates&quot; in the Thomas Theatre, &quot;It’s Christmas, Carol!&quot; in the Angus Bowmer Theatre. In addition, OSF presented &quot;The Cymbeline Project&quot;, a multi-episode, digital adaptation of the Shakespeare play.

In April 2023, OSF announced an emergency fundraising campaign as the company was in financial crisis and needed to raise $2.5 million to continue the season as planned. By June, the fundraising effort had exceeded its goal. Artistic director Nataki Garrett resigned on May 5, 2023, with Octavio Solis stepping in to help search for a replacement. Tim Bond of TheatreWorks Silicon Valley was named new artistic director on July 6, 2023. Tim had previously served as an associate artistic director under Libby Appel.

The complete record of all OSF plays can be found in a separate article, Production history of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.

==Green Show==
In addition to the plays, since 1951 a free outdoor &quot;Green Show&quot; drawing audiences in the hundreds, often including non-playgoers, precedes the evening plays from June through September, Wednesday through Saturday nights, from a modular steel stage with a sprung floor for the dancers, a removable wheelchair ramp for performers with disabilities, and built-in storage facilities that eliminate carting equipment from and to distant storage facilities. Originally, it offered Elizabethan music and dancers. From 1966 until 2007 it consisted of three Renaissance-themed shows in rotation inspired by the plays showing in the Allen Elizabethan Theatre. Beginning in 1990, live music was supplied by resident ensemble The Terra Nova Consort, with numerous guest musicians, and Elizabethan dancers. In 1998, Terra Nova was joined by modern dance troupe Dance Kaleidoscope. This collaboration continued through 2007.

In still another innovation by Bill Rauch, the Green Show was revamped in 2008. The shows now vary widely with performers such as a dance group from Mexico or India one night, clowns doing ballet on stilts the next, and a classical music quartet on another. A fire show, juggler, or magician might be seen along with improv, metal, or rock-n-roll variations on Shakespeare. Individual performers, groups, choirs, bands, and orchestras may present Afro-Cuban, baroque, blues, classical, contemporary, cowboy, funk, gospel, hip-hop, jazz, mariachi, marimba, poetry, marionette, renaissance, or salsa, sometimes combined in unexpected ways.

==Economic importance==
As suggested by the table below, OSF has a major economic impact in a town of only 20,000. That impact stems from direct sales of tickets but also expenditures at some 125 restaurants (a variety and density per resident similar to that in New York and Paris), hotels and motels in Ashland, and shops (second to last row of the table). These in turn create further economic activity, the economists’ “multiplier effect” that measures how often each dollar is spent on further local goods and services, estimated at 2.9 for OSF, resulting in the figures shown in bottom row of the table.

Differences from year to year are largely accounted for by variations in seating configurations in the theaters and total number of performances including occasional cancellation of outdoor performances due to wind born smoke from distant forest fires, particularly in 2018.

In addition to its economic importance to the region, OSF is an active community member. It often participates in Ashland&#x27;s Martin Luther King celebration, Juneteenth celebration of the Emancipation Proclamation, and Fourth of July Parade. The Green Show is free. The Daedalus Project, managed by company members since 1987 in support of HIV/AIDS charitable organizations, traditionally featured a morning fun run, an afternoon play reading, an &quot;arts and treasures&quot; sale and an evening variety show and underwear parade.

In 2016, the Festival hosted the fifth biennial national Asian American Theater Conference and Festival. In addition to a full slate of conference sessions during the week, the event included six original plays, five play readings, and three Green Shows (see above). Participants also had an opportunity to see several regular Festival performances, two of which had an Asian setting and one an Asian-American theme.

==OSF campus==
The Oregon Shakespeare Festival occupies a campus adjacent to Lithia Park and the Plaza in Ashland, Oregon. The primary buildings are the three theatres, Carpenter Hall, and the Camps, Pioneer, and Administration buildings, all surrounding an open central court locally known as &quot;The Bricks&quot; that ties everything together into an architecturally coherent whole and facilitates movement. It also provides a stage for the nightly Green Shows (see above) from June through September. The Black Swan (G), now serves as a laboratory for the development of new plays. Off-campus buildings include the production facility, classrooms, the Hay Patton Rehearsal Center, and costume storage and rental facilities described below.

===Allen Elizabethan Theatre===
The Allen Elizabethan Theatre has evolved since the founding of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival when the first performance of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; was presented on July 2, 1935.

====Original Elizabethan Theatre====
The design for the first outdoor OSF Elizabethan Theatre was sketched by Angus L. Bowmer based on his recollection of productions at the University of Washington in which he had acted while a student. Ashland, Oregon obtained WPA funds in 1935 to build it within the circular walls that remained in the roofless shell of the abandoned Chautauqua theatre. Bowmer extended the walls to reduce the stage width to fifty-five feet, and painted the extensions to resemble half-timbered buildings. He designed a thrust stage—one projecting toward the audience—with a balcony. Two columns helped divide the main stage into forestage, middle stage, and inner stage areas. Illustrating the improvised nature of it all, actors doubled as stage hands, stage lighting was housed in coffee cans, and string beans were planted along the walls to improve sound quality. Fifty-cent general admission seating was on benches just behind the one-dollar reserved seating on folding chairs. This theatre was torn down during World War II.

====Second Elizabethan Theatre====
The second outdoor Elizabethan Theatre was built in 1947 from plans drawn up by University of Washington drama professor John Conway. The main stage became trapezoidal, with entries added on either side, and windows added above them flanking the balcony stage. A low railing gave a finished appearance to the forestage. Chairs arranged to improve sight lines replaced bench seating. Backstage areas were added gradually and haphazardly, until the ramshackle result was ordered torn down as a fire hazard in 1958.

====Current Allen Elizabethan Theatre====
The next year saw the opening of the current outdoor theatre, whose name was changed from Elizabethan to Allen Elizabethan Theatre in October 2013. Patterned on London&#x27;s 1599 Fortune Theatre and designed by Richard L. Hay, it incorporated all the stage dimensions mentioned in the Fortune contract. The trapezoidal stage was retained but the façade was extended to three stories, resulting in a forestage, middle stage, inner below, inner above (the old balcony), and a musicians&#x27; gallery. The wings were provided with second-story windows. Each provides acting areas, creating many staging possibilities. A pitched, shingled roof enhances the half-timbered façade. A windowed gable was extended from the center of the roof to cover and define the middle stage. Just before each performance, an actor opens the gable window, and in keeping with Elizabethan tradition signaling a play in progress, runs a flag up the pole to the sound of a trumpet and doffs his cap to the audience.

The result is an approximate replica of the Fortune Theatre. The known but incomplete dimensions apply only to the stage. The original specifications sometimes say no more than &quot;to be built like the Globe,&quot; for which there are no plans or details. The remotely operated lighting, on scaffolding on either side of the stage, of course did not exist in the original, and the current site rather than the original architecture largely determined the shape of the auditorium. Twelve hundred seats in slightly offset arcs ascend the original hillside, giving an excellent view of the stage from each seat. The old Chautauqua theatre walls, now ivy-covered, remain as the outer perimeter of the theatre.

The $7.6 million Paul Allen Pavilion was added in 1992. It houses a control room, and audience services including rental of infrared hearing devices, blankets, pillows, and food and drink, both of which are allowed in the auditorium. Several hundred seats were moved to a balcony and two boxes, further improving sightlines and acoustics. Vomitoria (colloquially, &quot;voms&quot;), the traditional name for entryways for actors from under the seating area, were added and the lighting scaffolds were eliminated.

===Angus Bowmer Theatre===
An April 1968 report by the Bureau of Business and Economic Research of the University of Oregon pointed to the lost economic opportunity represented by the thousands of people the Oregon Shakespeare Festival was turning away each year. It further noted that the Festival had become an important economic engine for southern Oregon, and recommended addition of an indoor theatre. This led the City of Ashland to apply to the Economic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce in Fall 1968 for a $1,792,000 project grant with the Angus Bowmer Theatre as the keystone. The plan also called for a parking building, a remodeled administration building and box office, a scene shop and exhibit hall that later would become the OSF Black Swan, landscaping, and street realignment. $896,000 was approved in April 1969, to match an equal amount to be raised through private donations. The fund drive quickly exceeded its goal and ground for the new theatre was broken on December 18, 1969.

The theatre was ready just five months later and opened with a production of &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,&quot; selected to recognize the Shakespearean origin of the Festival but to signal Festival readiness to broaden its horizons by incorporating modern plays into its repertoire. Reinforcing that signal, &quot;The Fantasticks&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take it with You&quot; were also presented during that first six-week season.

The Angus Bowmer Theatre seats between 592 and 610 patrons depending on configuration. Although about half the size of the outdoor theatre, it more than doubled audience capacity by making it possible to hold matinee performances and to extend the season into spring and fall.

The design by Richard L. Hay and architects Kirk, Wallace and McKinley of Seattle and contractor Robert D. Morrow, Inc., of Salem, Oregon was at once basic, flexible, functional, and innovative. All seats are within of the stage, arranged with only two side aisles and wide spaces between rows. Dark colors resist reflection and draw the eye to the stage. The forestage is on a hydraulic lift system that can emulate the thrust stage of the OSF Allen Elizabethan Theatre, form a more conventional proscenium front that can move below auditorium floor level to form an orchestra pit, or drop two stories for storage of equipment or scenery. The walls of the auditorium can swing in to close down the playing area or open to accommodate larger productions.
Illustrating these characteristics, the first picture is the set for August Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Fences&quot;. The second, taken two hours later on the same stage, is the set for the ancient Hindu classic &quot;The Clay Cart&quot;. Stage crews for the two indoor theatres must complete set changes of this scope six days a week between the end of a matinee and the &quot;call&quot; before the evening curtain and again the next morning in time for the matinee (the outdoor stage changes daily). This illustrates the nature of true repertory theater, which allows the playgoer to see different plays on the same day on the same stage, but requires designing and making sets to withstand constant rapid assembly, disassembly and return to accessible storage to await the next change of set. It also requires actors able to simultaneously play different parts in very different plays.

Just two hours before the 18 June 2011 matinee a crack was discovered in the seventy-foot long, six and one-half foot high main ceiling support beam of the Bowmer Theatre. Shows were immediately relocated to other venues as work progressed to repair the beam. A 598-seat tent, &quot;Bowmer in the Park,&quot; was soon erected in Lithia Park adjacent to the Festival campus as a temporary replacement venue. A single set was designed and built to serve four very different shows, and the shows themselves were re-staged while keeping the artistic vision of each as intact as possible. Thirty-one performances were held in the tent and averaged 82% of capacity, generating approximately $650,000 in revenue against approximately $800,000 for the tent itself, $1,000,000 in lost revenue from ticket returns, and $330,000 in repair costs. The Bowmer reopened on 2 August, a month ahead of the initial estimate. The Festival filed an insurance claim for $3.58 million and received checks in March 2012 for $330,000 to cover the cost of repairs and $2.984 million covering much of the lost revenue, leaving about $200,000, primarily representing the cost of the temporary tent theatre itself, unresolved.

===Black Swan===
The Black Swan (G on the OSF campus map above) served as the Festival&#x27;s third theatre from 1977 to 2001. The building, originally an automobile dealership, was bought in 1969 as a scene shop and rehearsal hall. Company members began using it to stage &quot;midnight&quot; readings for one another and invited friends who brought other friends. Artistic Director Jerry Turner recognized the opportunity to take risks with unconventional staging and subjects, and called for its development as a third OSF theatre. Fitting a theatre into the existing building was challenging. It could hold only 138 seats, all within five rows of the stage. There had to be, as designer Richard Hay put it, a &quot;certain amount of tucking and squeezing.&quot; Each director had to solve the problem of an immovable roof support in the middle of the stage. For instance, in one production, it became a crucifix after adding a horizontal piece. The theatre reverted to its earlier roles in 2002 when it was replaced by the New Theatre, now renamed the Thomas Theatre. Among those roles are rehearsal space, meeting and audition rooms, classes, and since 2011 as a home for the Black Swan Lab (see above).

===Thomas Theatre===
The limitations stemming from adapting an existing building as the Black Swan led to the design and building of a third theatre that provided flexible seating and increased capacity while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan. Opened in March 2002 and originally named the New Theatre, it was renamed the Thomas Theatre in 2013 as a result of a generous $4.5 million gift from a group of donors. The name recognizes the contributions of longtime OSF development director Peter Thomas, who died in March 2010. The Thomas Theatre expands the possibilities for experiment and innovation while maintaining the intimacy of the Black Swan, no seat being more than six rows from the stage. Richard L. Hay designed the theatre space. Architects Thomas Hacker and Associates of Portland designed the building. The contractor was Emerick Construction, and acoustical engineering was provided by Dohn and Associates. The seats can be arranged in three configurations. In arena mode, a stage of is surrounded on all four sides by 360 seats. In three-quarter thrust mode, a stage is surrounded on three sides by 270 seats, and in avenue mode, a stage provides 228 seats on two sides. There is a trap room under the stage and a fly loft at one end. A computer controls 300 circuits and over 400 lights of various types. The remainder of the building is given over to downstairs and upstairs lobbies, concessions, access distribution, archives (see below), storage, laundry room, green room, quiet room, warm-up room, dressing space for 18 actors, showers/restrooms, costume and wig rooms, stage manager&#x27;s office, maintenance space, and storage for props and set pieces.

===Other buildings===
The Box Office (J on the OSF campus map above) is on the same courtyard as the Thomas Theatre. The Festival acquired the Administration Building (C) in April 1967. Forming the northern boundary of the campus, the building houses the artistic, business, community productions, development, education, group sales, literary (D), human resources offices, development, and the mailroom. The adjacent Camps Building (A) houses the members&#x27; lounge, communications and marketing offices, and a meeting room.

The Festival&#x27;s costume production shop occupies the Pioneer Building at the northwest corner of campus and an annex in the Administration building. The staff creates the costumes and accessories in three main studios on the lower floor of the building and in an extension of the Administration Building. Also in this area are offices and fitting rooms for the costume designers and costume design assistants, a costume props area and a vented paint room. Upstairs is a dye room, lounge, laundry, storage room, and office. During the height of costume production each season, a wig shop and additional studio is open in the basement of the Angus Bowmer Theatre.

The Festival acquired Carpenter Hall (I) in October 1973, renovating it to accommodate lectures, concerts, rehearsals, meetings and Festival and community events. The Bill Patton Garden (K) provides the venue for free informal summer noon talks by OSF actors and staff. The Tudor Guild operated the Tudor Guild Gift Shop (B) and Brass Rubbing Center (K) for many years, both now operated by OSF itself, and will facilitate campus tours beginning in 2022. Just off campus, a purpose-equipped fitness center helps actors stay fit for physically demanding roles that often require acrobatics, fights, and pratfalls.

In November 2013 the Festival completed the $7.2 million purpose-built (6,646.7 m2) Production Building in neighboring Talent, Oregon now home to a multi-function staff. The building houses custom-designed technologically advanced set and prop construction and scene painting facilities. The scene shop has an extensive pit area that precisely duplicates the trap doors in the theatres themselves, allowing for precise sizing, testing of assembly and disassembly, and automating elevator cues. Lighting in the painting areas duplicates that in the theatres, guaranteeing desired colors. The building also houses OSF&#x27;s costume warehouse and rental business, which has over 50,000 costumes and over 15,000 costume props such as armor, crowns, and wigs available for rent by other theatres, television and movie producers, and corporations.

With the removal of the scene construction shop in 2014 to the new Production Building, a thirteen-month transformation began of the old one into the Hay-Patton Rehearsal Center by demolishing everything except the masonry exterior and the steel framework and raising the second floor three feet. Following a plan developed by Ogden Roemer Wilkerson Architecture carried out by Adroit Construction at a cost of $4.4 million, it hosted its first rehearsal on 29 December 2015. The building is equipped with a sophisticated sound system and has six rehearsal halls, three of them some , sufficient to precisely duplicate stages in any of the three Festival theatres. All six include fully sprung floors to prevent injuries when dancing, rehearsing stage combat, or similar physical activities. The LED lighting system is zoned and dimmable, the ceilings have steel tracks which allow for suspension of scenery, lights, loudspeakers, and even people. Some have additional features such as small conversation areas and dance-style mirrors. The building also includes a stage management office, a recording studio, a movement studio focused on the Feldenkrais Method, a studio for work on vocal technique, stamina, and dialect; a loading dock, a conference room, showers, two warmup spaces that double as small meeting rooms, two green rooms equipped with refrigerator, storage cases, sink, dishwasher, tables custom-made by the prop shop, and chairs.

==Organization==
OSF is a non-profit corporation managed under US and Oregon law by a 32-member Board of Directors nominated and elected for eight-year terms. The endowment itself has a net worth in excess of $30 million that returns about $1.2 million to support the annual operating budget. It is managed by seven trustees who are selected for five-year terms by the Board of Directors.

In the past, OSF offered non-voting memberships at eleven levels beginning at $35, each with its own privileges. Starting in 2022, these have been replaced by a Change Makers donor program in eight categories starting at one dollar and providing for deep engagement. To further extend access to as many people as possible, 2022 ticket prices were reduced and now range from $35 to $75.

===Professional staff===
The paid staff is organized into artistic, production, education, administrative and development sections.

The Artistic Director selects the plays and directors for each season and chooses 70-120 actors, musicians and dancers. In August 2019, Nataki Garrett succeeded Bill Rauch as the sixth artistic director of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. She earned her MFA in directing from the California Institute of the Arts and has more than 20 years experience as a theatre administrator, director, producer, playwright, educator, activist and mentor, most recently as acting artistic director of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and Associate Dean of the undergraduate acting program at California Institute of the Arts School of Theater. Her forté and passion are fostering and developing new work. She has produced over 150 mainstage, black box, and developmental projects including world premieres of &quot;Book of Will&quot;, &quot;Two Degrees&quot;, &quot;Zoe&#x27;s Perfect Wedding&quot;, &quot;The Great Leap&quot;, and &quot;American Mariachi&quot;. She directed the world premiere of Pussy Valley, and the U.S. premieres of Jefferson&#x27;s Garden and &quot;BLKS&quot;. In her first effort in her new position, she directed the imaginatively staged 2019 Oregon Shakespeare production of &quot;How to Catch Creation&quot;.[8] 

Once the plays have opened, the voice and text staff are on hand to help actors with vocal challenges that may arise, attend periodic performances to provide helpful ideas, work with understudies, teach voluntary voice classes to the acting company, provide ongoing professional development support in the form of project or individual session work, and participate in play selection and workshops for upcoming seasons.

Each play is also assigned an Intimacy Director, who works to ensure that actors feel emotionally and mentally safe when performing in intimate and emotionally demanding scenes, while also working to realize the director’s vision.

Programs specifically for teachers have included the five-day retreat, &quot;Shakespeare in the Classroom&quot; that emphasizes innovative and pedagogical methods to help teachers make the works of Shakespeare involving and accessible to contemporary students.

For those unable to come to the Festival, pairs of actors participate in the School Visit Program, initiated in 1971, which now reaches some 60,000 students primarily in four states, although it has made occasional visits to eight others. Each one-day visit includes two 50-minute performances and one two-hour or two one-hour workshops. Performances are a condensed version of one Shakespeare play, selected scenes from Shakespeare illustrating a single theme, or a combination of Shakespeare and other literature selected to meet the needs of the school being visited.

A partnership with Ashland High School initiated by student actors in 1993 grew into a rich and enduring relationship for students and Festival professionals that has produced a significant number not just of actors but of theatre professionals over the years.

Programs of different lengths and formality to meet varied adult needs and interests have included Wake Up With Shakespeare, Shakespeare Comprehensive, Festival Noons, Prefaces, Prologues, Park Talks, Road Scholars, and &quot;Unfolding Seminars.&quot;

OSF&#x27;s Development Department has also educational opportunities through tours that have included two to England focused on Shakespeare, one to Greece and Turkey on Holland America Line&#x27;s MS Rotterdam focused on the beginnings and history of theatre, and one along the coasts of France and Spain and to the Canary Islands on Cunard Line&#x27;s Queen Mary 2. These tours feature an intensive schedule of lectures and interactive workshops with four to eight OSF staff and actors, as well as visits to local attractions.

The Administrative staff is supervised Acting Executive Director David Schmitz who follows past Executive Directors Paul Christy (2019–2020), Cynthia Rider (2013–2018), Paul Nicholson (1995–2012) and William Patton (1955–1995).

Administration supervises the physical plant (custodial services, maintenance, and security), accounting, IT, mail room, and receptionists. The Director of Marketing and Communications supervises the box office, membership services, archives (see below), publications and media, marketing, and audience services, which itself includes house managers, ushers, concessions, and access staff for handicapped patrons (see below). The Director of Development supervises institutional giving, major gifts, and the Change Makers donor program. The Director of Human Resources manages employees, volunteer and events programs (see below), safety, and a professional development program called FAIR (Fellowships, Assistantships, Internships, and Residencies) that provides students aspiring to a career in theatre with direct experience of best practices across all aspects of professional theatre. Fellows work directly with senior management while expanding their personal networks. Three residencies varying from four to eleven months are exclusive to the Dramaturgy and Literary Management Department. Twenty-five to thirty Assistantships annually provide hands-on opportunities in virtually every area of the organization by pairing recipients with an appropriate OSF staff member for an average of three months. Finally, 15–20 annual unpaid Internships of two to four months each provide emerging artists and administrators with hands-on experience by pairing them with a Festival staff member in an area of interest. Internships may fulfill academic requirements determined by recipient&#x27;s home academic institution.

===Archives===
OSF archivists develop, preserve, and maintain a comprehensive collection of documents and oral histories, drawings and photographs, audio and video recordings, and artifacts pertaining to the artistic and administrative history and heritage of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival. Collecting, organizing, and preserving these materials of what otherwise is an ephemeral art form to archival standards is an ongoing effort aided in part by grants. The archives may be searched online.

Collections are available for research, although some collections have restrictions, and permission must be obtained for their use.

The Archives include Education department records from 1947 on and document the department&#x27;s programming and structural evolution. Print materials include annual reports, brochures, calendars, correspondence, course handouts, course readings, news clippings, newsletters, photographs, posters, scripts, statistics and survey reports, study guides, and teacher information kits, guides, and resource kits. Audio and video recordings include radio broadcasts and school visit program performances.

In May 2013, the National Endowment for the Humanities awarded the Festival a $200,000 grant to digitize 2,649 deteriorating tapes, films and videos and to make them publicly available through its website and the YouTube platform. The collection spans the history of the Festival from its inception in 1935 through 2012 and comprises an unparalleled comprehensive record of Shakespearean and theatrical performance by a single U.S. theatre company. Included are full-length recordings of 541 of the 570 Festival productions from 1950 to 2012, including three or more varied interpretations of every play in the Shakespearean canon with exemplary casts before live audiences. The production recordings are supplemented by 44 adaptations broadcast on NBC radio, more than 100 hours of artist interviews, Shakespeare lectures by nationally and internationally renowned scholars and educators, production music, promotional recordings, and recordings of significant events in the company&#x27;s history. Also included are the home movies of founder Angus Bowmer, Southern Oregon Normal School events and rare footage of the initial 1935 Festival season!

===Volunteers===
The professional staff is augmented by approximately 700 volunteers, who contribute thousands of hours each year. They have helped patrons as roving Bricks Ambassadors who welcomed visitors to the campus and answered their questions, staffed the Welcome Center and Green Show information table, facilitated informal post-matinee discussions, provided concierge services for visiting student groups, and served as volunteer ushers and ticket takers in the three theatres.

Behind the scenes, volunteers help in the archives, box office, costume shop, costume warehouse, development office, fitness center, light shop, mail room, marketing office, scene shop as well as with office tasks such as copying, filing, preparing mailings and sorting incoming mail. They transcribe interviews, help with actor auditions for visitors from other theatres and serve as attendants in the company fitness facility.

Volunteers assist with access services such as providing infrared hearing devices. They help with data collection for periodic audience surveys and staff numerous events that comprise the annual Daedalus fund raiser (see above), drive company vehicles on specific errands, and direct traffic during dismantling and movement of sets into storage at the end of the season.

Soroptimists Club members provide comfort items such as blankets, cushions, and ponchos in the outdoor theatre. Tudor Guild volunteers staff the brass rubbing center, theatre lobby merchandise counters, and gift shop. Housing aides deliver “welcome baskets” to visiting artists. Ashland Garden Club members provide floral arrangements for the annual Feast of Will celebration on the opening weekend of the Allen Elizabethan Theatre.

Each November, company members host a cocktail party and show titled Love&#x27;s Labors thanking and celebrating the volunteers.

===Publications===
All playgoers are offered a complimentary &quot;Playbill&quot; with a synopsis of plays, casts, artist biographies, and directors&#x27; statements. Each year, the Festival publishes Teachers First! for school groups and Group Travel for adults, both providing information on the season&#x27;s plays, including age suitability, the seasonal calendar, ordering, and discount information.

An annual &quot;Souvenir Program&quot; included photographic highlights of each play and special articles along with pictures and biographies of actors, playwrights, and the many people who work behind the scenes. A chart emphasizing the repertory nature of OSF lists all the actors and their parts in the plays.

The Festival also publishes a &quot;Bard Scorecard&quot;, a simple folder that lists all of William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, the years OSF produced them, and allows playgoers to check off which plays they&#x27;ve seen towards completing the canon.
===Professional memberships===
OSF is a constituent of Theatre Communications Group, the national service organization for the not-for-profit theatre world, and a member of the Shakespeare Theatre Association of America. It operates under contracts with Actors&#x27; Equity Association, The Union of Professional Actors and Stage Managers in the United States, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, and the Stage Directors and Choreographers Society, Inc., an independent national labor union.

<doc id="689552" wikidata="Q1814801" url="?curid=689552" title="Pieces of You">
<text>Pieces of You is the debut studio album by American singer-songwriter Jewel, released on February 28, 1995, by Atlantic Records. It was produced by Ben Keith, who has also produced works for artists such as Neil Young and Patsy Cline. Featuring acoustic guitar-based songs written when Jewel was a teenager, the album is composed of both live recordings from 1994 at the Innerchange, a coffeehouse in San Diego, and studio recordings completed at Neil Young&#x27;s personal studio in Redwood City, California.

After its release in February 1995, the album initially failed to chart. Two years later, in 1997, Bob Dylan invited Jewel to tour with him as his opening act, which gave the album widespread public exposure. The single &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul&quot; eventually received airplay, and the album peaked at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, almost exactly two years after its release. Other hits included were &quot;Foolish Games&quot; and &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot;, as well as the UK single &quot;Morning Song&quot;. After two years, the album was re-released featuring the re-recorded versions of &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot; and &quot;Foolish Games&quot;. Despite a mixed critical response, the album is listed at number 64 of the &quot;Definitive 200&quot; by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

&quot;Pieces of You&quot; was certified 12-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 30, 2006, denoting shipments in excess of 12 million copies in the United States. As of June 2010, the album had sold over 7.3 million copies in the US, becoming one of the best-selling debut albums of all time.

On September 28, 2020, Jewel announced that the album would be re-released in celebration of the 25th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release. It was released through Craft Recordings in multiple formats including the original album remastered, alongside a four-disc box set containing B-sides, demos, outtakes, and live performances of the album&#x27;s songs.

==Background==
The bulk of the songs featured on &quot;Pieces of You&quot; were written by Jewel between the ages of 16 and 19; she has said that &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul&quot; specifically was written while she was busking during a hitchhiking trip she took by herself over spring break from the Interlochen Center for the Arts, where she had been studying on a vocal scholarship.

While living in San Diego, California, Jewel managed to amass a local following while performing in coffee houses and local bars, which resulted in a bootleg being broadcast on 91X FM. Jewel then became subject of a bidding war between labels, eventually signing with Atlantic Records.

==Recording==
Several tracks on &quot;Pieces of You&quot; were recorded live in 1994 at the Innerchange, a San Diego coffeehouse where Jewel was a regular performer. The remainder of the album was recorded in Neil Young&#x27;s studio at Broken Arrow Ranch in Redwood City, California, under the supervision of producer Ben Keith. Jewel told &quot;Time&quot; about the recording process:
&quot;[...] Typically I&#x27;ve had difficulty in the studio. I don&#x27;t sing as raw, it&#x27;s just a bit more tame. I&#x27;m a live singer who&#x27;s always fed off the energy of the audience. In a studio, you&#x27;re just looking at a wall—it feels very odd to me. I&#x27;ve been a live performer since I was six years old. The reason I recorded the album live with the band was so that I could play guitar, which I usually never do in the studio, while I sing at the same time. The band was accustomed to following singer-songwriters and feeling for me slowing down and speeding up. It has a real ebb and a flow and a naturalness that didn&#x27;t inhibit my singing or performance.&quot;
In her 2015 memoir, &quot;Never Broken: Songs Are Only Half the Story&quot;, Jewel described &quot;Pieces of You&quot; as &quot;imperfect, full of mistakes and guitar flubs&quot;, but also &quot;honest&quot;.

==Reception==
Upon its initial release in 1995, the album received little attention, after which Jewel was invited to tour as the opener for Bob Dylan, which helped garner more public attention. Two of the album&#x27;s singles were re-recorded for a 1997 re-release of the album.

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a negative review upon its 1997 re-release, noting, &quot;&quot;Pieces of You&quot; remains a wimpily produced batch of songs – so ineffectual that both &#x27;Who Will Save Your Soul?&#x27; and &#x27;You Were Meant for Me&#x27; had to be rerecorded for release as singles. It&#x27;s best considered as a guided tour through three decades of female folk-pop styles,&quot; comparing it negatively to Joni Mitchell and Kate Bush. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; also gave the album a starkly negative review, writing: &quot;With the possible exception of Saint Joan, who at least had some stature, this is the bad folkie joke to end all bad folkie jokes.&quot;

Sara Sytsma of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, calling it &quot;a charming collection of light alternative folk-rock from the teenage singer/songwriter. Her songs are occasionally naive, but her melodies can usually save her lyrics.&quot; In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote: &quot;&quot;Pieces of You&quot; is a charming debut that is somewhat undone by its own naïveté. Jewel has a rich voice and an innocent, beguiling charm that makes &#x27;Who Will Save Your Soul,&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;m Sensitive,&#x27; and &#x27;You Were Meant for Me&#x27; – songs with slight, simple lyrics and catchy, sweet melodies – quite endearing; they sound like a high-school diary brought to life. [...] &quot;Pieces of You&quot; has enough charm to make it an ingratiating debut, even if the album doesn&#x27;t quite fulfill Jewel&#x27;s potential.&quot;

<doc id="689562" wikidata="Q4353432" url="?curid=689562" title="Shirley Muldowney">
<text>Shirley Muldowney (born June 19, 1940), also known professionally as &quot;Cha Cha&quot; and the &quot;First Lady of Drag Racing&quot;, is an American auto racer. She was the first woman to receive a license from the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) to drive a Top Fuel dragster. She won the NHRA Top Fuel championship in 1977, 1980, and 1982, becoming the first person to win two and three Top Fuel titles. She won a total of 18 NHRA national events.

==Racing career==
Born Shirley Ann Roque in Burlington, Vermont, on June 19, 1940, Muldowney began street racing in the 1950s in Schenectady, New York. &quot;School had no appeal to me. All I wanted was to race up and down the streets in a hot rod,&quot; declared Muldowney. When she was 16, she married 19-year-old Jack Muldowney, who built her first dragster.
It was Jack Muldowney who first taught me how to drive a car. Jack was the mechanic. He was the guy who tuned the cars that let the girl beat all the boys. I was a kid from upstate New York with no guidance, no direction. I was headed for trouble, nothing going for me. Then I found the sport at a very young age and was able to make something out of it.

In 1958, Muldowney made her debut on the dragstrip of the Fonda Speedway. She obtained her NHRA pro license in 1965. She competed in the 1969 and 1970 U.S. Nationals in a twin-engined dragster in Top Gas. With Top Gas losing popularity, Muldowney switched to Funny Car, buying her first car from Connie Kalitta.

Around this time, her husband and she drifted apart; they finally divorced in 1972. &quot;He didn&#x27;t want to go nitro racing and we parted, but we stayed friends all those years until he passed away [in 2007],&quot; she later said.

Muldowney won her first major event, the International Hot Rod Association (IHRA) Southern Nationals, in 1971.

She stepped up to Top Fuel, getting her license in 1973 (making her the first woman to do it), behind the wheel of Poncho Rendon&#x27;s digger; Don Garlits signed her application, one of three signatures she needed to make it official; the other two were Tommy Ivo and Connie Kalitta. From 1973 to 1977, she teamed up with Kalitta as the &quot;Bounty Hunter&quot; and &quot;Bounty Huntress&quot; in match races, in a pair of Ford Mustangs, hers a Buttera chassis, and his a Logghe. The &quot;Bounty Huntress&quot; Mustang caught fire at Dragway 42 in Ohio in 1973.

In Columbus, Ohio, in 1976, Muldowney dominated Top Fuel, qualifying number-one by 0.05 second, setting low elapsed time (ET) and top speed of the meet, having the low ET in every round, breaking her own top speed record in the final, and winning the class. An unprecedented three NHRA Top Fuel Dragster world championships followed, in 1977, 1980, and 1982.

Muldowney&#x27;s success met enormous opposition from those who felt drag racing (or any form of motorsport, for that matter) was no place for women. Garlits has said about her:
Now, if you ask who do I have the most respect for, I&#x27;d say Shirley Muldowney. She went against all odds. They didn&#x27;t want her to race Top Fuel, the association, the racers, nobody...just Shirley.
Muldowney noted, &quot;NHRA fought me every inch of the way, but when they saw how a girl could fill the stands; they saw I was good for the sport.&quot;

A crash in 1984 crushed her hands, pelvis, and legs, necessitating half a dozen operations and 18 months of therapy. Muldowney was sidelined for a long period, but returned to the circuit in the late 1980s. She appeared on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson on Feb. 21, 1986, walking with a cane. She continued to race, mostly without major sponsorship, throughout the 1990s in IHRA competition, as well as match-racing events. She returned to the NHRA towards the end of her career, running select events until her retirement at the end of 2003.

Muldowney was described by longtime drag racer Fred Farndon as the &quot;best &#x27;natural&#x27; driver (top fuel or funny car), no question.&quot;

Her recent activities include the dictation of her memoirs, &quot;Shirley Muldowney&#x27;s Tales from the Track&quot;, which Bill Stephens transcribed, and which Sports Publishing L.L.C. published in 2005.

==Health issues==
In March 2016, Muldowney disregarded a cancer scare to be the official starter of the Amalie Oil NHRA Gatornationals. Having been given a diagnosis of lung cancer prior to the event, Muldowney was later given a diagnosis of histoplasmosis, a curable and nonmalignant fungal infection that can mimic cancer.
==Shirley&#x27;s Kids==
Muldowney operates a charitable organization, Shirley&#x27;s Kids, which helps children in need in cities where drag racing is part of the community.

==Film depiction==
The 1983 biopic &quot;Heart Like a Wheel,&quot; about Muldowney&#x27;s life and career, starred Bonnie Bedelia. Muldowney would rather have had Jamie Lee Curtis play her; she called Bedelia &quot;a snot,&quot; and stated, &quot;When she was promoting the movie on TV shows, she would tell interviewers she didn&#x27;t even like racing. She got out of race car like she was getting up from the dinner table.&quot; Muldowney had mixed feelings about the film itself, stating, &quot;No, the movie did not capture my life very well at all, but more importantly, I thought the movie was very, very good for the sport.&quot;

<doc id="689563" wikidata="Q257706" url="?curid=689563" title="Euphrosyne of Polotsk">
<text>Euphrosyne of Polotsk (; 1104–1167) was the granddaughter of Vseslav, the prince of Polotsk, and daughter of the prince Svyatoslav-Georgy Vseslavich. She has long been a popular saint among Orthodox devotees, particularly those in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia with a traditional feast day of May 23. In addition, since 1984, she has been one of the 15 patron saints of Belarus, whose lives are celebrated in the Belarusian Orthodox Church, on the first Sunday after Pentecost.

==Life==
Predslava was born between 1101 and 1104, into the Rurik noble family, members of which were the dukes of the principality of Polotsk, in what is modern day Belarus. Her father was Prince Svyatoslav-Georgy Vseslavich, second son of Vseslav the Sorcerer.

She refused all proposals of marriage and, without her parents&#x27; knowledge, ran away to the convent where her aunt was the abbess. She became a nun and took the name Euphrosyne. With the blessing of the Bishop of Polotsk, she began to live near the Sophia cathedral, where she spent her time copying books. The money she thus earned she distributed amongst the poor.

Around 1128 Bishop Elias of Polotsk entrusted Euphrosyne the task of setting up a convent. At the newly constructed Savior-Transfiguration convent at Seltse she taught young women to copy books, sing, sew and do other handicrafts. Through her efforts, in 1161, a cathedral was built which survives to the present day. 
She also founded a monastery dedicated to the Mother of God, as well as two churches. The church of The Holy Saviour still stands today and is considered to be the most precious monument of early Belarusian architecture.

Towards the end of her life, she undertook a pilgrimage to Constantinople and the Holy Land. Patriarch Michael II of Constantinople gave her an icon of the Theotokos, which is now called the &quot;Virgin of Korsun&quot;. The Crusader king, Amalric I of Jerusalem, also received her in the Holy Land where she died circa 1173. Her body, after the conquest of Jerusalem by Saladin in 1187, was carried by the monks to Kiev and deposited there in the Monastery of the Caves. It was only in 1910 that the relics of Euphrosyne were brought back to her native town of Polotsk.

==Veneration==

Her feast day is celebrated on May 23. Euphrosyne is the only virgin saint of East Slav origin.

Euphrosyne (or Efrosinia) of Polotsk is a patron saint of Belarus. In Belarus there is a Convent of Saint Euphrosyne in Polotsk and a Saint Euphrosyne Orthodox Church in Minsk. In addition, there are churches dedicated to Euphrosyne of Polotsk in London, Toronto, Vilnius and South River, New Jersey (see: St. Euphrosynia Belarusian Orthodox Church).

==Cross of Saint Euphrosyne==
The Cross of Saint Euphrosyne was a gem-studded cross created at her behest by a local master, Lazar Bohsha (). The famous six-armed golden cross was decorated with enamels and precious stones and presented by her to the Church of the Holy Saviour in 1161. The relic survived centuries of turbulence until World War II, when it disappeared during the evacuation of the museum in 1941. The cross was last seen in Mogilev. Despite efforts of the Belarusian government to trace its whereabouts in the early 1990s, which included searching in private collections in the United States, it has not been found.

<text>Irving Rameses Rhames (; born May 12, 1959) is an American actor. He is best known for portraying IMF Agent Luther Stickell in the (1996–present) and crime boss Marsellus Wallace in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994).

==Early life and education==
Rhames was born and raised in Harlem, New York City. He was named &quot;Irving&quot; after NBC journalist Irving R. Levine.

Rhames entered New York&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts, where he developed his love of acting. After high school, he studied drama at SUNY Purchase, where fellow acting student Stanley Tucci gave him his nickname &quot;Ving&quot;. Rhames later transferred to the Juilliard School&#x27;s Drama Division (&quot;Group 12&quot;: 1979–1983) where he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in 1983.

==Career==
Rhames first appeared on Broadway in the play &quot;The Boys of Winter&quot; in 1984. He started out in film in Wes Craven&#x27;s &quot;The People Under the Stairs&quot; (1991) as Leroy, watched over Kevin Kline as Secret Service agent Duane Stevensen in &quot;Dave&quot; (1993), and played Marsellus Wallace in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; (1994). He also played Buddy Bragg in &quot;Out of Sight&quot; (1998).

Rhames played Dr. Peter Benton&#x27;s brother-in-law on the TV medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, a recurring role he filled for three seasons. He played ace computer hacker Luther Stickell opposite Tom Cruise in Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1996). In 1997, Rhames portrayed the character of Nathan &#x27;Diamond Dog&#x27; Jones in the popular film &quot;Con Air&quot;, and Muki in the Ice Cube film &quot;Dangerous Ground&quot;.

Rhames won a Golden Globe in 1998 for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Don King: Only in America&quot;. At the ceremony he gave his award to fellow nominee Jack Lemmon, saying, &quot;I feel that being an artist is about giving, and I&#x27;d like to give this to you.&quot; Lemmon was clearly touched by the gesture as was the celebrity audience who gave Lemmon a standing ovation. Lemmon, who tried unsuccessfully to give the award back to Rhames, said it was &quot;one of the nicest, sweetest moments I&#x27;ve ever known in my life.&quot; The Hollywood Foreign Press Association announced later that they would have a duplicate award prepared for Rhames. That moment was #98 on E!&#x27;s 101 Awesome Moments in Entertainment. &quot;The New York Times&quot; lauded Rhames for the act, writing that in doing so he &quot;demonstrated his capacity for abundant generosity.&quot;

Rhames appeared in &quot;Striptease&quot; (1996) as the wisecracking bodyguard Shad, Jesus-praising paramedic Marcus in &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999), and reprised his Luther Stickell role for &quot;&quot; (2000). He played Johnnie Cochran in &quot;American Tragedy&quot; (2000), the ex-con boyfriend of Jody&#x27;s mother in the John Singleton film &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, portrayed a gay drag queen in the television film &quot;Holiday Heart&quot;, contributed his voice for the character of Cobra Bubbles in &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002) and the subsequent TV series, and played a stoic cop fighting zombie hordes in &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (2004) and &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; (2008) remakes. Rhames has also appeared in a series of television commercials for RadioShack, usually performing with Vanessa L. Williams.

In March 2005, Rhames played the lead role on a new &quot;Kojak&quot; series, on the USA Network cable channel (and on ITV4 in the UK). The bald head, lollipops, and &quot;Who loves ya, baby?&quot; catchphrase remained intact, but little else remained from the Telly Savalas-starring original.

Rhames voiced the part of Tobias Jones in the video game &quot;Driver 3&quot;.

Reprising his Luther Stickell role, Rhames co-starred in &quot;&quot; (2006), had a cameo appearance in &quot;&quot; (2011), and played a major role in &quot;&quot; (2015), &quot;&quot; (2018) and &quot;&quot; (2023), the fifth, sixth and seventh installments in the &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; film series, respectively. He is the only actor besides Tom Cruise to appear in all seven &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; films. It was announced that he would have a role in the Aquaman-based show &quot;Mercy Reef&quot;; however, due to the integration of The WB and UPN for the new network, CW, &quot;Mercy Reef&quot; was not picked up. Rhames played a gay – and possibly also homicidal – firefighter who comes out of the closet in &quot;I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry&quot;. He narrates the BET television series &quot;American Gangster&quot;.

In the 2008 film &quot;Saving God&quot;, he played an ex-con who is released from prison a changed man, looking to take over his father&#x27;s former church congregation in a deteriorating neighborhood. Rhames stars in &quot;Phantom Punch&quot;, a biopic of boxer Sonny Liston, released directly to DVD, as well as &quot;The Tournament&quot;, portraying a fighter out to win a no-rules tournament.

Rhames makes an appearance in Ludacris&#x27;s song &quot;Southern Gangstas&quot; on his album &quot;Theater of the Mind&quot;. Rappers Playaz Circle and Rick Ross are also featured on the track.

He filmed the film &quot;The Red Canvas&quot; with Ernie Reyes Jr., UFC lightweight contender Gray Maynard, and Randy Couture. In 2010, he filed a lawsuit against the film&#x27;s producer, claiming that he had only been paid $175,000 of a $200,000 contract.

In 2015, he filmed a series of commercials for The ADT Corporation.

Rhames is one of the narrators for UFC.

Rhames narrated the team introductions for the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI in February 2017.

Since 2014, Rhames has provided the narration for numerous Arby&#x27;s commercials, with the slogan &quot;Arby&#x27;s: We have the meats!&quot;

==Personal life==
Rhames is a Christian. As of 2018, he resides in Santa Monica, California. He has been married to Deborah Reed since 2000.

<doc id="689571" wikidata="Q12804020" url="?curid=689571" title="Trbovlje Power Station">
<text>The Trbovlje Power Station () was a lignite-fired power station on the bank of the Sava River near Trbovlje, Slovenia. The plant was operated by Termoelektrarna Trbovlje d.o.o.

The original power station was built in 1915. The new power station was built in 1964–1968 and it became operational in 1966. It consisted of two units. The first unit was a 125 MW steam unit. The second unit was a 63 MW gas unit which included two gas generators. It was used as a reserve unit for the Slovenian electric system.

The Trbovlje Chimney () of the power station, built in 1976, is the tallest flue-gas stack in Europe. The high flue-gas stack was poured in 210 days, and required of concrete and 1,079 tons of reinforcing steel. A high chimney was required for the site to ensure that emissions were removed from the deep, narrow valley under all weather conditions.

In November 2014 it was announced that the power station would be shut down; the station was finally closed in 2016 after several years dormant.

In 2020, the climbers Janja Garnbret and Domen Škofic climbed an artificial climbing route created up the 360-metre chimney for the film &quot;360 Ascent&quot;.

== History ==
=== Construction and operation in 1915 ===
On March 19, 1915, in the second year of the First World War, a newly built power plant along the Sava was opened in Trbovlje. On that day, the new coal-fired thermal power plant along the Sava River started operating, after the first thermal power plant at Vode in Trbovlje ceased to operate due to insufficient capacity, lack of sufficient water, proximity to residential settlements and other circumstances.

On that day, a turbine with a generator with a capacity of 4,000 kW began to produce electricity. The start of operation of this new and large facility with a large capacity was a severe test for the management, especially for the electrical and mechanical staff of the Trbovlje mine. Therefore, the start of operations meant a big day. On the opening day, all engineers, machinists and electricians, as well as other staff of the mine and the new plant of the power plant along the Sava, as it was called all the years until the Second World War, gathered. The large turbogenerator, the switchboard next to the generator, a series of electrical meters, oil switch levers for individual energy consumers (own consumption, mine, cement plant) were especially interesting for all participants in the large hall of the engine room. Before the connection, the steam turbine and the generator were still running empty. At 10 a.m., however, they began weighting experiments on the generator and turbine. For these experiments, a large wooden tub with built-in water resistors was prepared outside the power plant along the north wall. However, none of the domestic experts dared to turn on the turbogenerator oil switch on the switchboard. This work was then performed by the director of the First Machine Factory from Brno, an engineer from Križek, who otherwise participated as a designer in attempts to load machines and devices. When he turned on the switch, everyone looked at each other and breathed a sigh of relief. The turbine and generator withstood the prescribed load. In the first, a large thermal power plant for coal at the time, but small for today&#x27;s conditions, it was produced with three steam-powered generators with a piston. This stream was primarily intended for the operation of various machines and devices as part of the accelerated modernization of the Trbovlje mine, as well as the two neighboring mines Hrastnik and Zagorje, which was started by the then owner of the TPD mines. The construction facilities of the power plant along the Sava were: engine room, boiler room, space for high-voltage devices and devices for coal supplies.

=== Renovation and expansion of the power plant in 1938 and 1939 PE1 ===
After the global economic crisis with all its consequences, even in the case of expansion and increase of the capacity of the Trbovlje power plant, calmed down and the production of both coal and electricity consumption returned to normal and the mines started operating normally every day of the week and the TPD power plant through the Trbovlje mine in 1934 and 1935 finally started the reconstruction of the existing capacities and their increase in the Trbovlje power plant. After the preparatory work, the main work took place in 1937 and 1938, and was completed in November 1939.

The enlarged and modernized Trbovlje power plant began operating, albeit not at full capacity, in early 1939. The results showed quickly. The effects of large investments were manifested in various forms, especially in higher electricity production, higher consumption of coal, especially dust and coal sludge - sludge from the settling basin, cleanliness of the Sava River, more employees, the possibility of faster electrification of Slovenia, especially some areas. Until then, they had not been electrified, and the more normal work of the miners of the Trbovlje mine or mines - coal mines, which belonged to the TDP, was ensured. Other advantages became apparent in later years.

The major investments in the Trbovlje power plant in those years included: a new steam boiler, a new turbogenerator, a new switchyard, a settling pool-thickener (also called a mammoth device), the installation of the Trbovlje-Podlog transmission line, the connection of Kranj&#x27;s KDE power plants to the Trbovlje power plant, covered coal dump and other accompanying devices - vacuum cleaners, chimney, warehouse, administrative building and more.

=== The struggle against the occupier in the years 1941 to 1945 ===
The forms of the Slovene nation&#x27;s struggle against the occupiers in the years 1941 to 1945 were very different. One of these forms was the prevention and slowing down of construction and assembly works during the expansion of the Trbovlje power plant in the years 1942 to 1944, about which we state the data in the second place. In December 1942, the commissioning and trial operation of a new turbocharger began. As early as January 1943, one blade of the low-pressure part of the Siemens turbine broke off when it was idling in the presence of the installer and assembly engineer of the supplier company. The cause of the failure could not be determined.

However, the regular operation of all devices built in 1942 did not begin until mid-1943 and lasted until May 1944. During the revision of the turbine by a Siemens installer, the rotor blades were intentionally damaged due to improper use of the crane otherwise electrified in a domestic power plant. The rotor had to be sent back to the Muelhlheim / Ruhr factory. Due to transport problems caused by Allied bombs in rail and other transport, the repair lasted until September 1944. In December of the same year, this unit failed again due to another intentional damage - a compressed cooling pipe 1 m in diameter due to artificial vacuum. Repairing this took a month.

With such and similar actions of domestic workers, the production of electricity, which was still needed by the German war industry in particular, was disabled for a certain period of time. Thus, the German economy, especially the war economy, suffered great damage, expressed in the smaller production of machinery and equipment and armaments. This was the contribution of the workers of the Trbovlje power plant in the fight against the occupier.

Throughout the occupation period, there were several similar sabotage operations at the Trbovlje power plant with the same goals and purposes - to damage the German military machine and thus weaken it in the further course of the war and military operations.

=== Construction and operation from 1964 to 1968 - PE 2 ===
The construction of the Trbovlje 2 thermal power plant began on 31 May 1964. He emphasized the necessity and justification of the construction, with special regard to the large reserves of low-calorie coal lying in the area of the Zasavje districts. However, the previous capacities could not burn and refine all this available coal in the form of electricity. The strongest argument for the construction of a new thermal power plant was in the large coal reserves, especially in the Trbovlje area. Otherwise, all this coal would remain unexcavated in the cave, which would be a great loss for the national economy. This coal is expected to meet the needs of the thermal power plant for the next 80 years. They started building the facility in the middle of consumers and with minimal transport costs.

When the thermal power plant was upgraded and put into operation with a grand opening, major problems arose soon after the start of regular operation. They were mainly manifested by the beginning of ash slag in the boiler firebox, but there were also excessive vibrations and the eccentricity of the turbogenerator. After a lengthy determination of the causes, the authorized experts found that the suppliers of TPP Morava equipment did not dimension the boiler for the Trbovlje thermal power plant in relation to the delivered sample shipments of coal to Poland, and above all did not take into account the ash melting point.

Thus, the thermal power plant was forced to operate with a load of 105 to 110 MW, instead of the projected 125 MW, which depended on slag in the furnace. The consequences began to manifest in various forms. The Trbovlje and Hrastnik coal mines received the most comments due to the poorer quality of coal, as well as due to many non-combustible elements (stones, iron, clay, ...). Based on a number of interviews with responsible professionals, matters have normalized over time and more attention has been paid to the quality of coal at disconnection sites, transport, extraction and crushing of coal.

<doc id="689584" wikidata="Q620558" url="?curid=689584" title="BusyBox">
<text>BusyBox is a software suite that provides several Unix utilities in a single executable file. It runs in a variety of POSIX environments such as Linux, Android, and FreeBSD, although many of the tools it provides are designed to work with interfaces provided by the Linux kernel. It was specifically created for embedded operating systems with very limited resources. The authors dubbed it &quot;The Swiss Army knife of Embedded Linux&quot;, as the single executable replaces basic functions of more than 300 common commands. It is released as free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License v2, after controversially deciding not to move to version 3.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Originally written by Bruce Perens in 1995 and declared complete for his intended usage in 1996, BusyBox initially aimed to put a complete bootable system on a single floppy disk that would serve both as a rescue disk and as an installer for the Debian distribution. Since that time, it has been extended to become the de facto standard core user space toolset for embedded Linux devices and Linux distribution installers. Since each Linux executable requires several kilobytes of overhead, having the BusyBox program combine over two hundred programs together often saves substantial disk space and system memory.

BusyBox was maintained by Enrique Zanardi and focused on the needs of the Debian boot-floppies installer system until early 1998, when Dave Cinege took it over for the Linux Router Project (LRP). Cinege made several additions, created a modularized build environment, and shifted BusyBox&#x27;s focus into general high-level embedded systems. As LRP development slowed down in 1999, Erik Andersen, then of Lineo, Inc., took over the project and became the official maintainer between December 1999 and March 2006. During this time the Linux embedded marketplace exploded in growth, and BusyBox matured greatly, expanding both its user base and functionality. Rob Landley became the maintainer in 2005 until late 2006, then Denys Vlasenko took over as the current maintainer.

=== GPLv2/GPLv3 controversies ===
In September 2006, after heavy discussions and controversies between project maintainer Rob Landley and Bruce Perens, the BusyBox project decided against adopting the GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3); the BusyBox license was clarified as being GPL-2.0-only.

Since October 2006, Denys Vlasenko has taken over maintainership of BusyBox from Rob Landley, who has started Toybox, also as a result of the license controversies.

=== GPL lawsuits ===
In late 2007, BusyBox also came to prominence for actively prosecuting violations of the terms of its license (the GPL) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.

What was claimed to be the first US lawsuit over a GPL violation concerned use of BusyBox in an embedded device. The lawsuit, case 07-CV-8205, was filed on September 20, 2007, by the Software Freedom Law Center (SFLC) on behalf of Andersen and Landley against Monsoon Multimedia Inc., after BusyBox code was discovered in a firmware upgrade and attempts to contact the company had apparently failed. The case was settled with release of the Monsoon version of the source and payment of an undisclosed amount of money to Andersen and Landley.

On November 21, 2007, the SFLC brought two similar lawsuits on behalf of Andersen and Landley against two more companies, Xterasys (case 07-CV-10455) and High-Gain Antennas (case 07-CV-10456). The Xterasys case was settled on December 17 for release of source code used and an undisclosed payment, and the High-Gain Antennas case on March 6, 2008, for active license compliance and an undisclosed payment. On December 7, 2007, a case was brought against Verizon Communications over its distribution of firmware for Actiontec routers; this case was settled March 17, 2008 on condition of license compliance, appointment of an officer to oversee future compliance with free software licenses, and payment of an undisclosed sum. Further suits were brought on June 9, 2008, against Bell Microproducts (case 08-CV-5270) and SuperMicro (case 08-CV-5269), the Super Micro case being settled on July 23, 2008. BusyBox and Bell Microproducts also settled out of court on October 17.

On December 14, 2009, a new lawsuit was filed naming fourteen defendants including Best Buy, JVC, Samsung and others.
In February 2010 Samsung released its LN52A650 TV firmware under GPLv2, which was used later as a reference by the SamyGO community project.

On about August 3, 2010, BusyBox won from Westinghouse a default judgement of triple damages of $90,000 and lawyers&#x27; costs and fees of $47,865, and possession of &quot;presumably a lot of high-def TVs&quot; as infringing equipment in the lawsuit Software Freedom Conservancy v. Best Buy, et al., the GPL infringement case noted in the paragraph above.

No other developers, including original author Bruce Perens and maintainer Dave Cinege, were represented in these actions or party to the settlements. On December 15, 2009, Perens released a statement expressing his unhappiness with some aspects of the legal situation, and in particular alleged that the current BusyBox developers &quot;appear to have removed some of the copyright statements of other BusyBox developers, and appear to have altered license statements&quot;.

== Features ==
BusyBox can be customized to provide a subset of over two hundred utilities. It can provide most of the utilities specified in the Single Unix Specification (SUS) plus many others that a user would expect to see on a Linux system. BusyBox uses the Almquist shell, also known as A Shell, ash and sh. An alternative for customization is the smaller &#x27;hush&#x27; shell. &quot;Msh&quot; and &quot;lash&quot; used to be available.

As it is a complete bootstrap system, it will further replace the init daemon and udev (or the latter-day systemd) using itself to be called as &quot;init&quot; on startup and &quot;mdev&quot; at hotplug time.

The BusyBox website provides a full list of the utilities implemented.

=== Single binary ===
Typical computer programs have a separate binary (executable) file for each application. BusyBox is a single binary, which is a conglomerate of many applications, each of which can be accessed by calling the single BusyBox binary with various names (supported by having a symbolic link or hard link for each different name) in a specific manner with appropriate arguments.

BusyBox benefits from the single binary approach, as it reduces the overhead introduced by the executable file format (typically ELF), and it allows code to be shared between multiple applications without requiring a library. This technique is similar to what is provided by the &quot;crunchgen&quot; command in FreeBSD, the difference being that BusyBox provides simplified versions of the utilities (for example, an &lt;samp&gt;ls&lt;/samp&gt; command without file sorting ability), while a crunchgen generated sum of all the utilities would offer the fully functional versions.

Sharing of the common code, along with routines written with size-optimization in mind, can make a BusyBox system use much less storage space than a system built with the corresponding full versions of the utilities replaced by BusyBox. Research that compared GNU, BusyBox, asmutils and Perl implementations of the standard Unix commands showed that in some situations BusyBox may perform faster than other implementations, but not always.

== Examples ==

Programs included in BusyBox can be run simply by adding their name as an argument to the BusyBox executable:

:codice_1

More commonly, the desired command names are linked (using hard or symbolic links) to the BusyBox executable; BusyBox reads argv[0] to find the name by which it is called, and runs the appropriate command, for example just

:codice_2

after &quot;/bin/ls&quot; is linked to &quot;/bin/busybox&quot;. This works because the first argument passed to a program is the name used for the program call, in this case the argument would be &quot;/bin/ls&quot;. BusyBox would see that its &quot;name&quot; is &quot;ls&quot; and act like the &quot;ls&quot; program.

==Appliances and reception==
BusyBox is used by several operating systems running on embedded systems and is an essential component of distributions such as OpenWrt, OpenEmbedded (including the Yocto Project) and Buildroot. The Sharp Zaurus utilizes BusyBox extensively for ordinary Unix-like tasks performed on the system&#x27;s shell.

BusyBox is also an essential component of VMware ESXi, Tiny Core Linux, SliTaz 5(Rolling), and Alpine Linux, all of which are not embedded distributions.

It is necessary for several root applications on Android and is also preinstalled with some &quot;1 Tap Root&quot; solutions such as Kingo Root.

== Controversy over Toybox ==
Toybox was started early 2006 under the GPL-2.0-only license by former BusyBox maintainer Rob Landley as a result of the controversies around GPLv3/GPLv2 discussions. At the end of 2011 it was relicensed under the BSD-2-Clause license after the project went dormant. In March 2013, it was relicensed again under the 0BSD license. On January 11, 2012, Tim Bird, a Sony employee, suggested creating an alternative to BusyBox which would not be under the GNU General Public License. He suggested it be based on the dormant Toybox. In January 2012 the proposal of creating a BSD licensed alternative to the GPL licensed BusyBox project drew harsh criticism from Matthew Garrett for taking away the only relevant tool for copyright enforcement of the Software Freedom Conservancy group. The starter of BusyBox based lawsuits, Rob Landley, responded that this was intentional as he came to the conclusion that the lawsuits resulted not in the hoped for positive outcomes and he wanted to stop them &quot;in whatever way I see fit&quot;.

<doc id="689595" wikidata="Q1935938" url="?curid=689595" title="Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast">
<text>Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast is the debut studio album by American rapper Kid Rock. Released on November 27, 1990, by Jive Records, the album is marked by a straightforward hip hop music style, in sharp contrast to the largely rock-oriented sound of his later albums.

Jive found the album difficult to promote due to its explicit lyrics, but upon release, it made Kid Rock one of Detroit hip hop&#x27;s most successful recording artists, selling over 100,000 copies upon release.

==History==
Kid Rock began his professional music career as a member of the hip hop music group the Beast Crew in the late 1980s. During this time, Kid Rock met rapper D-Nice, which led to Kid Rock opening at local shows for Boogie Down Productions. During this time, Kid Rock began his professional association with producer Mike E. Clark, who was initially skeptical of the idea of a white rapper, but was impressed by Kid Rock&#x27;s performance; Kid Rock had prepared his own beats and used his own turntables to demonstrate his skills for Clark. In 1988, Clark produced a series of demos with Kid Rock, which led to offers from six major record labels, including Atlantic and CBS Records. With the help of D-Nice, Kid Rock signed with Jive Records at the age of 17, releasing his debut studio album, &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot; in 1990, which featured production by D-Nice and Too Short. According to Kid Rock, the contract with Jive resulted in animosity from fellow rapper Vanilla Ice, who felt that he should have been signed.

==Artistry==
In contrast to Kid Rock&#x27;s later albums, &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot; features a straightforward hip hop sound. While the album primarily reflects what reviewers perceived as a strong Beastie Boys influence, &quot;&quot;Grits Sandwiches&quot; nevertheless contains a few elements of the Bob Seger-loving, turntable-scratching dirt-ass pimp character who would later emerge as the American Bad Ass&quot;, according to Allmusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus. Other influences claimed by reviewers on the album&#x27;s music include LL Cool J and Rob Base. &quot;With a One Two&quot; samples the Doobie Brothers&#x27; &quot;China Grove&quot;, predicting Kid Rock&#x27;s later shift to rap rock.

==Release and aftermath==
To promote the album, Kid Rock toured nationally with Ice Cube, D-Nice, Yo-Yo and Too Short; Detroit artist James &quot;the Blackman&quot; Harris was Kid Rock&#x27;s DJ on this tour. During instore promotions for the album, Kid Rock met and developed a friendship with local rapper Eminem, who frequently challenged Kid Rock to rap battles. &quot;Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast&quot; sold over 100,000 copies, signaling national success for the young Kid Rock; the album&#x27;s success made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local independent rapper Esham. Despite the album&#x27;s commercial success, Kid Rock was underpromoted by Jive Records; because the album contained &quot;unprintable&quot; explicit lyrics on every song, Jive found it difficult to market the album, producing few singles and no music videos. The lead single, &quot;Yo-Da-Lin in the Valley&quot;, which was about oral sex, proved to be controversial when WSUC-FM, a college radio station, was fined $23,700 by the FCC for playing it. Ultimately, unfavorable comparisons to Vanilla Ice led to Jive dropping Kid Rock, according to Mike E. Clark.

===Critical reception===
Retrospective reviews have looked unfavorably upon the album, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listing it as one of &quot;20 terrible debut albums by great artists&quot; and gave it two and a half out of five stars in its album guide. AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus wrote that &quot;despite Kid&#x27;s distinct, hard-edged flow and references to the building blocks that would later make his career, Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast is a mostly laughable recording&quot;. Robert Christgau gave the album a &quot;dud&quot; rating. However, the album&#x27;s music has also received praise from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, which called the song “Wax the Booty” a &quot;classic&quot; in an article by Chaz Kangas, who called the track &quot;smooth and sinister&quot; and &quot;a worthwhile tale of fornication from the era where sex in storytelling was king.&quot;

<text>Funkstörung (sometimes stylized as Funkstorung) are an electronic music duo from Rosenheim, Germany, consisting of Michael Fakesch and Chris de Luca.

== History ==
Chris de Luca and Michael Fakesch first met in 1992 at a techno party organised by Fakesch in Rosenheim. Subsequently, the two started producing tracks together.

In 1999, the duo released &quot;Additional Productions&quot;, a compilation album of their remixes of other artists&#x27; songs such as Björk&#x27;s &quot;All Is Full of Love&quot;, Wu-Tang Clan&#x27;s &quot;Reunited&quot;, East Flatbush Project&#x27;s &quot;Tried by 12&quot;, and Finitribe&#x27;s &quot;Mind My Make-Up&quot;. Their debut studio album, &quot;Appetite for Disctruction&quot;, followed in 2000.

In 2004, the duo released a studio album, &quot;Disconnected&quot;. The music video for &quot;Chopping Heads&quot;, directed by Keep Adding and Scott Pagano, was selected for the International Critic&#x27;s Week at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.

In 2005, the duo released &quot;The Return to the Acid Planet&quot;, which consisted of remixes of old tracks they discovered while cleaning their studio.

In 2006, a statement was published on funkstorung.com, stating that the duo had officially broken up due to musical, personal and practical differences. Both Michael Fakesch and Christian de Luca will continue making music with their respective solo projects.

In 2015, Funkstörung released a studio album, &quot;Funkstörung&quot;, on Monkeytown Records.

<doc id="689610" wikidata="Q1122995" url="?curid=689610" title="Ten Yard Fight">
<text>Ten-yard Fight was an American straight edge, football-themed band formed in 1995 in Boston. Along with In My Eyes and Floorpunch, they spearheaded the youth crew revival in 1997. Ten-yard Fight&#x27;s &quot;official&quot; last show was in Boston on October 17, 1999, which would become the first National Edge Day. They would later play two additional shows with partial line-ups and a full reunion show at This Is Hardcore festival.

==Biography==
Ten-yard Fight played their first show with Moreschi clad in a combination of football gear and punk rock clothing. After receiving positive feedback the band decided to become more serious. Ten-yard Fight began performing on the East Coast.

Having sold 1,000 copies of their demo, Ten-yard Fight teamed up with Big Wheel Recreation to release the &quot;Hardcore pride&quot; 7-inch in 1996. The initial pressing sold out in less than a week, helping generate a buzz that resulted in the band&#x27;s signing to Equal Vision. During that time they also released a split 7-inch with Fastbreak. The first result of the partnership was to compile the demo and &quot;Hardcore pride&quot; 7-inch onto a single CD. Ten-yard Fight would next release an album entitled &quot;Back on track&quot;. Line-up changes followed, as the group toured Europe and the United States through 1997 and 1998. In 1998, the band recorded six new songs that would later surface on &quot;The only way&quot; EP.

In between these releases, Ten-yard Fight appeared on many different compilation recordings. At the end of 1999, Ten-yard Fight played their last show together with friends Bane, Reach the Sky, and In My Eyes. This show was at the Karma Club on Lansdowne Street as the Yankees and Red Sox were playing right across the street in the ALCS at Fenway Park. The final line-up of the band included Anthony Moreschi, guitarist John LaCroix (who started out playing bass), guitarist Tim Cossar (who later formed American Nightmare), bassist Brian Ristau, and drummer Ben Chused.

&quot;The only way: 1995-1999&quot;, a video documentary, had its release celebrated a year later with Ten-yard Fight taking the stage, unannounced, at Edge Day Two, coinciding with the final performance of Boston&#x27;s In My Eyes. During the 4+ years that Ten-yard Fight was around, the band played all over the world, including several US tours, a European tour, many shows in Canada and even a weekend of 2 shows in Puerto Rico where Steve Reddy caused permanent spinal damage to LaCroix. At some point between May 2000 and June 2005 LaCroix had penned the first &quot;edge confession&quot; letter when he broke edge. This was followed closely by Ray Lemoine (former tour driver) penning a similar letter known to scholars as the &quot;State of the edge address&quot;. 

==Aftermath==

Ristau and Moreschi reunited as «First and Ten» at National Edge Day 2007 in Haverhill, MA. They played another show under the same name and at the same place with Slapshot on November 8, 2008.

Moreschi went on to front Stand and Fight (Bridge 9 Records), and, later, formed Resist, featuring members from Drug Test and Since the Flood.

John LaCroix moved to California and started the band that would become Terror. He now plays guitar in Portland hardcore band Unrestrained.

Ten-yard Fight reunited for just one show headlining the first day at This Is Hardcore 2018, in Philadelphia, PA. The line-up was the same active twenty years before: Moreschi on vocals, LaCroix and Dalbec on guitars, Chused on drums and Ristau on bass.

<text>What Dreams May Come is a 1998 American fantasy drama film directed by Vincent Ward and adapted by Ronald Bass from the 1978 novel by Richard Matheson. Starring Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra and Cuba Gooding Jr., it won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and the Art Directors Guild Award for Excellence in Production Design. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction. The title is from a line in &quot;Hamlet&quot;″s &quot;To be, or not to be&quot; soliloquy. The film received mixed reviews, with praise for its scenery but criticism for the plot. It was a box-office bomb, grossing only $75.4 million against a budget of $85‒90 million.

==Plot==
While vacationing in Switzerland, pediatrician Chris Nielsen meets artist Annie Collins. They marry and have two children, Ian and Marie. Their idyllic life ends when the children die in a car crash. Four years later, Chris is also killed in a car crash. Unaware that he is dead, and confused that no one will interact with him, Chris lingers on Earth.

Chris sees Annie&#x27;s attempts to cope with his loss and attempts to communicate with her, despite advice from a presence that this will cause her only more pain. When his attempts indeed cause more sorrow, he decides to move on. Chris awakens in a Heaven that he has created with his imagination; his surroundings are a mountainous landscape that resembles a painting created by his wife and is similar to a place where the two desired to spend their old age.

Chris is accompanied in Heaven by Albert Lewis, his friend and mentor from his medical residency, and Leona, a stewardess who Chris had once admired in the presence of his daughter; he later comes to recognize Leona as his daughter Marie. Meanwhile, Annie is wracked with guilt for the deaths of Chris and their children and dies by suicide. Chris, who is initially relieved that her suffering is over, grows angry when he learns that those who die by suicide go to Hell; not the result of a judgment made against them but rather their own tendency to create nightmare afterlife worlds based on their pain.

Chris is adamant that he will rescue Annie from Hell, despite Albert&#x27;s insistence that no one has ever succeeded in doing so with someone who died by suicide. Aided by a &quot;tracker&quot;, Chris and Albert descend into Hell. On the journey there, Chris realizes that Albert is actually Ian and parts ways with him before his search for Annie.

Chris and the tracker arrive at a dark and twisted version of Chris and Annie&#x27;s house. The tracker reveals himself as the real Albert and warns Chris that if he stays with Annie for more than a few minutes, he may be permanently trapped in Hell, advising that all Chris can reasonably expect is an opportunity for a final farewell to Annie. Chris enters their horrific-looking home to find Annie suffering from amnesia, unable to remember her suicide and visibly tortured by her decrepit surroundings. Unable to stir her memories, the tracker sees Chris give up his quest to save Annie from Hell.

But instead of returning to Heaven, Chris chooses to join Annie forever in Hell. As he declares to Annie his intent to stay, his words parallel something that he had said to her as he left her in an institution following the children&#x27;s deaths, and she regains her memories while Chris is making her nightmare his. Annie ascends to Heaven, taking Chris with her. Chris and Annie are reunited with their children in Heaven, and all appearances are restored. Chris proposes reincarnation so that he and Annie can experience life together again. Chris and Annie meet again as young children in a situation that parallels their first meeting.

==Cast==

* Cuba Gooding Jr. as Albert Lewis / Ian Nielsen
* Annabella Sciorra as Annie Collins-Nielsen
* Max von Sydow as The Tracker / Albert Lewis
* as Marie Nielsen
* Josh Paddock as Ian Nielsen

Additionally, director Werner Herzog has a cameo as one of the Faces of the Damned.

==Production==
Principal photography for &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; began in late June 1997. It was shot largely on Fuji Velvia film, and is one of few films to have been shot in this manner. Fuji Velvia film is known among landscape photographers for its vivid color reproduction. The visual effects were created by Mass.lllusions, the same group that developed the bullet time visual effects for &quot;The Matrix&quot;.

Filming locations include places in Marin County, Alameda County, Glacier National Park, and Angel Falls. Part of the &quot;Hell&quot; sequence was filmed on the decrepit hull of the &quot;Essex&quot; class aircraft carrier USS &quot;Oriskany&quot; (CV-34) while berthed at Mare Island in Vallejo, California.

The original prints of the film were lost in a fire at Universal Studios&#x27; backlot on June 1, 2008. A worldwide search was launched for a copy and one was found in Europe.

The special-edition DVD and the 2011 Blu-ray include an alternate ending — the ending from the novel — in which reincarnation is not a choice but part of the natural order. Ian and Marie explain that Chris and Annie will meet again in their new lives, but Annie must atone for killing herself —her new incarnation will die young, and Chris&#x27; new incarnation will spend the remainder of this life as a widower before the two are again reunited in Heaven. Chris is reincarnated as a boy in Philadelphia and Annie as a girl in Sri Lanka.

===Music===
The musical score for &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; was composed and conducted by Michael Kamen and produced by James Seymour Brett. Ennio Morricone had completed and recorded a full score for the film but, after editorial changes were made, his score was rejected and Kamen was hired in his place. Short on time, Kamen took the song &quot;Beside You&quot; from his band the New York Rock &amp; Roll Ensemble&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Roll Over&quot; and adapted it as the film&#x27;s main musical theme. With just over three weeks to write, record, and mix the score, Kamen took a more direct approach. &quot;I was at an extremely profound juncture in my own life at that time, and the film produced a powerful and personal response in me,&quot; said Kamen. &quot;I know, despite the mixed response to the film itself, that I accomplished one of my best and most focused scores.&quot;

The score was performed by the London Metropolitan Orchestra and recorded at both AIR Studios and Abbey Road Studios. A soundtrack album was released on October 13, 1998, by Beyond Records.

==Differences from the novel==
The film differs significantly from the novel, in its plot and its vision of the afterlife.

In the novel, there are far more references to Theosophical, New Age and paranormal beliefs. The author Richard Matheson claims in an introductory note that only the characters are fictional, and that most everything else is based on research (the book includes an extensive bibliography). Story elements that do not show up in the film include astral projection, telepathy, a séance, and the term &quot;Summerland&quot; (a name for a simplified Heaven in Theosophy, and for Heaven in general in religions such as Wicca).

The details of Chris&#x27;s life on Earth differ strongly in the novel. Only Chris and his wife (called Ann) die. Their children, who are grownups rather than youngsters, remain alive, as minor characters. Albert and Leona are the people they appear to be, and the character played by Max Von Sydow does not appear in the book. Albert is Chris&#x27;s cousin rather than simply a friend. Chris and Ann are rural types rather than the urbanites portrayed in the film, and he is not a pediatrician, nor is she a painter. He is a Hollywood screenwriter, and she has a variety of jobs.

In the book, the afterlife imagery is based on natural scenery rather than paintings. The novel&#x27;s depiction of Hell is considerably more violent than in the film. Chris finds it difficult to move, breathe or see, and he suffers physical torture at the hands of some inhabitants. He does not encounter ships, thunderstorms, fire, or the sea of human faces that his film counterpart walks on. Instead, he and Albert climb craggy cliffs and encounter sights such as a swarm of insects that attacks people.

Ann is consigned to Hell for 24 years, not eternity. At the end, which resembles an alternate version of the film but not the standard version, she escapes from Hell by being reincarnated, because she is not ready for Heaven.

==Reception==
The film was the second-highest-grossing film at the US box office in its opening weekend behind &quot;Antz&quot;, and went on to gross $55 million in the United States and Canada, with a further $20 million internationally, for a worldwide total of $75 million.

On its initial release, critical reception for &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; was mixed. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52%, based on 69 reviews, with an average score of 5.70/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;An insubstantial plot overshadows the beautiful, surreal scenery.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade &quot;B&quot; on a scale of A+ to F.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; awarded the film three and a half stars out of four, remarking: 

James Berardinelli of &quot;ReelViews&quot; gave &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; three stars out of four, saying: 
Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a C+, writing, &quot;There&#x27;s a central contradiction in a fairy tale like this one: the film may preach to the audience about matters of the spirit, but its bejeweled special-effects vision of the afterlife can&#x27;t help but come off as aggressively literal-minded.&quot;

Leonard Maltin, in his annual publication &quot;TV Movies&quot;, gave the film a &quot;BOMB&quot; rating, describing it as being &quot;off-putting gobbledygook&quot;.

In an interview regarding adaptations of his work, Richard Matheson stated, &quot;I will not comment on &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot; except to say that a major producer in Hollywood said to me, &#x27;They should have shot your book.&#x27; Amen. I must add that the producer, Stephen Simon, tried to get my script filmed for many years so I can&#x27;t fault him for finally having to go the route he did in order to get the film made.&quot;

<doc id="689617" wikidata="Q3855553" url="?curid=689617" title="Metahuman">
<text>In the DC Universe, a metahuman is a human with superpowers. The term is roughly synonymous with the terms &quot;mutant&quot;, &quot;inhuman&quot; and &quot;mutate&quot; in the Marvel Universe and &quot;posthuman&quot; in the Wildstorm and Ultimate Marvel Universes. In DC Comics, the term is used loosely in most instances to refer to any human-like individual with extraordinary, often paranormal abilities or other attributes, regardless of whether or not they are cosmic, mutant, scientific, supernatural, skill-based or technological in nature. A significant portion of these are normal human beings born with a genetic variant called the &quot;metagene&quot;, which causes them to gain powers and other paranormal qualities during freak accidents or times of intense psychological distress, effectively making them a subspecies of superhumans living within the population.

The term was first used as a reference to superheroes in 1986 by author George R. R. Martin, first in the &quot;Superworld&quot; role playing system, and then later in his &quot;Wild Cards&quot; series of novels.

==DC Comics==

The term was first used by a fictitious race of extraterrestrials known as the Dominators when they appeared in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Invasion!&quot; mini-series in 1988. The Dominators use this term to refer to any human native of the planet Earth with &quot;fictional superhuman abilities&quot;. The prefix &quot;&quot;meta-&quot; simply means &quot;beyond&quot;&quot;, denoting powers and abilities beyond human limits. Metahuman may also relate to an individual who has exceeded what is known as &quot;The Current Potential&quot;, meaning one&#x27;s ability to move matter with mind (see Telekinesis).

===&quot;Xenobrood&quot;===

Before the White Martians arrived on Earth, Lord Vimana, the Vimanian overlord from the Xenobrood mini-series, claimed credit for the creation of the human race both normal and metahuman, due to their introduction of superpowered alien genetic matter into human germline DNA. The Vimanians in the series forced their super powered worker drones to mate with humanity&#x27;s ancestors &quot;Australopithecus afarensis&quot; (3 million years ago), and later &quot;Homo erectus&quot; (1.5 million years ago) in order to create a race of superpowered slaves.

===The metagene===
The &quot;Invasion!&quot; miniseries provided a concept for why humans in the DC Universe would survive catastrophic events and develop superpowers. One of the Dominators discovered that select members of the human race had a &quot;biological variant,&quot; which he called the metagene (also spelled &quot;meta-gene&quot;). This gene often lay dormant until an instant of extraordinary physical and emotional stress activates it. A &quot;spontaneous chromosomal combustion&quot; then takes place, as the metagene takes the source of the biostress – be it chemical, radioactive or other similar phenomenon – and turns the potential catastrophe into a catalyst for &quot;genetic change,&quot; resulting in metahuman abilities. DC does not use the &quot;metagene concept&quot; as a solid editorial rule, and few writers explicitly reference the metagene when explaining a character&#x27;s origin.

DC also has characters born with superhuman abilities, suggesting the metagene can activate spontaneously and without any prior appearance in the ancestry. One well-known example involves Dinah Laurel Lance, the second Black Canary. Although her mother (Dinah Drake Lance, the original Black Canary) was a superhero, neither she nor her husband Larry Lance were born with any known metagenes. However, Dinah Laurel &quot;was&quot; born with a metagene, the infamous ultrasonic scream known as the Canary Cry.

The prefix &quot;meta-&quot;, in this context, simply means &quot;beyond&quot;—as in &quot;metastable&quot;, which is beyond regular stability and ready to collapse at the slightest disruption, or &quot;metamorphosis&quot;, which is the state of going beyond a single shape. In the DC comic miniseries &quot;Invasion!&quot;, the Dominators point out that the metagene is contained inside every cell of the human body.

In the DC Comics universe, metahuman criminals are incarcerated in special metahuman prisons, like the prison built on Alcatraz Island, which is outfitted not only with provisions to hold criminals whose powers are science- and technology-based, but even mystical dampeners to hold villains (including &quot;Homo magi&quot;) whose powers are magic-based. Prisoners in this facility are tagged with nanobyte tracers injected into their bloodstream that allow them to be located wherever they are.

It is possible for individuals skilled in science and biology to manipulate, dampen or modify the activities of the metagene. During the Final Crisis, while the Dominators devised a &quot;Gene Bomb&quot; able to accelerate the metagene activity to the point of cellular and physical instabilities, an &quot;anti-metagene virus&quot; was spread as a last-ditch weapon in the invaded Checkmate quarters. This &quot;metavirus&quot; has the opposite effects of the Gene Bomb, curbing and shutting down the metagene and stripping the metahumans of their powers for an unspecified amount of time.

===White Martians===

The genetic potential for a future metagene was discovered in ancient &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;&#x27; DNA (500,000 - 250,000 years ago) by the White Martian race. The White Martians performed experiments on these primitive humans, changing how the metahuman phenotype was expressed by the metagene.

Due to their experiments, they altered the destiny of the human race. Whereas before, evolution would have eventually made mankind into a race of superhumans similar to the Daxamites and Kryptonians, now only a select few humans would develop metahuman powers. As punishment for this, the group of renegades known as the Hyperclan was exiled to the &quot;Still Zone&quot;, a version of the Phantom Zone.

===Metavirus===
The White Martians also created a metavirus, a metagene that could be passed from host to host via touch. This metavirus was responsible for the empowerment of the very first Son of Vulcan. From that time onwards, the Sons of Vulcan passed the metavirus down in an unbroken line, sworn to hunt and kill the White Martians.

===Population===
The terms &quot;meta&quot; and &quot;metahuman&quot; do not refer only to humans born with biological variants. Superman and the Martian Manhunter (aliens) as well as Wonder Woman (a near-goddess) and Aquaman (an Atlantean) are referred to in many instances as &quot;metahumans.&quot; It can refer to anyone with extraordinary powers, no matter the origins and including those not born with such power. According to &quot;Countdown to Infinite Crisis&quot;, roughly 1.3 million metahumans live on Earth, 99.5% of whom are considered &quot;nuisance-level&quot; (such as kids who can bend spoons with their minds and the old lady &quot;who keeps hitting at Powerball&quot;). The other 0.5% are what Checkmate and the OMACs consider alpha-, beta- and gamma-level threats. For example, Superman and Wonder Woman are categorized as alpha-level, while Metamorpho is considered a beta-level and the Ratcatcher is considered a gamma-level. However, since the destruction of the Source Wall, the number of Alpha and Beta level metahumans, as well as the general metahuman population, were sharply increased by the new cosmic radiations affecting the universe.

===Exo-gene===
The &quot;52&quot; miniseries introduced a toxic mutagen called the Exo-gene (also referred to as the Exogene). It is a toxic gene therapy treatment created by LexCorp for the Everyman Project, which creates metahuman abilities in compatible non-metahumans. It first appeared in &quot;52&quot; #4, with the first announcement of the Everyman Project in &quot;52&quot; #8. The project was controversial, creating unstable heroes that gave Luthor an &quot;off switch&quot; for their powers, creating countless mid-flight deaths.

===&quot;Dark Nights: Metal&quot;===
In &quot;Road to Dark Nights: Metal&quot;, the Joker revealed to Duke Thomas that the term &quot;meta&quot; originated from a rudimentary hospital program used to automatically flag Nth metal toxicity found in a person&#x27;s bloodstream, similar to iron or zinc, the “meta” being short for the &quot;metal&quot; it detected. This natural toxicity is the &quot;variant&quot; that changes the individual&#x27;s DNA results in the metagene and its various heightened abilities and powers.

The lineage of metahumans and their origins can be traced by this Nth Metal connection, dating back to three tribes from the earliest known era of humanity; the Bird Tribe, the Wolf Tribe and the Bear Tribe.

When the Totality crashed to Earth and introduced the various forms of Heavy Metal and other mysterious forces into the world, The Bear tribe and Vandar Adg of the Wolf Tribe were the first ones to encounter the Totality. They were all mutated by the radiation of the Totality, granting them immortality and making them the world&#x27;s earliest iteration of metahumans.

==Marvel Comics==
The word &quot;metahuman&quot; is often attributed to the DC Universe, while superhuman beings in the Marvel Universe are referred to as either mutants or mutates. However, both DC and Marvel Comics have made use of the term &quot;metahuman&quot; and &quot;mutant&quot; in their universes. The first use of the term &#x27;metahuman&#x27; in the Marvel Universe occurred in &quot;New Mutants Annual&quot; #3, written by Chris Claremont, published in 1987, in which a Russian security officer describes the protagonists as &quot;metahuman terrorists&quot;.

===Amalgam Comics===
In the limited DC/Marvel Comics &quot;Amalgam Comics&quot; crossover event, in &quot;JLX&quot; #1 (April 1996) (combining DC&#x27;s &quot;Justice League&quot; and Marvel&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot;), metahumans are replaced with metamutants (a portmanteau of DC&#x27;s metahumans and Marvel&#x27;s mutants) who are said to carry a &#x27;metamutant gene&#x27;.

== In other media ==
=== Television ===

====DC animated universe====
In the animated version of the DC universe, the term metahuman is used in the animated TV series &quot;Static Shock&quot;.

====&quot;Birds of Prey&quot;====
On the television series &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, metahumans included heroines the Huntress and Dinah Lance. New Gotham has a thriving metahuman underground, mostly made of metahumans who are trying to live their own lives, although a self-hating metahuman, Claude Morton (Joe Flanigan), tries to convince the police that all metahumans are evil. In &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, metahumans are treated seemingly as a race or species; the Huntress is described as being &quot;half-metahuman&quot; on her mother&#x27;s side.

====&quot;Smallville&quot;====
On the television series &quot;Smallville&quot;, metahumans can occur naturally. However, the majority are the result of exposure to kryptonite, which in the &quot;Smallville&quot; universe can turn people into superpowered &quot;meteor freaks&quot;, often with psychotic side effects. For many seasons of &quot;Smallville&quot;, all superpowered people other than Kryptonians were so-called meteor freaks, but as the show went on, it began to explore further corners of the DC Universe. Non-kryptonite metahumans include the &quot;Smallville&quot; versions of Aquaman, the Flash, the Black Canary, and Zatanna.

====&quot;Young Justice&quot;====
On the animated series &quot;Young Justice&quot;, the aliens known as the Kroloteans have frequently used the term and have even researched into the discovery of a &quot;metagene&quot; by abducting and testing on random humans. The alien Reach conduct similar experiments and kidnap a cadre of teen runaways to test for the metagene, leading several of these individuals to develop superpowers. In the episode &quot;Runaways,&quot; a S.T.A.R. Labs scientist surmises that the gene is &quot;opportunistic&quot; in as much as it causes its user to develop powers seemingly based on their personal experiences or surrounding depending on circumstances. In the third season a recurring plot-point is the trafficking of metahumans after humans learn to detect and activate metagene after the Reach invasion. In some cases, the metagene in some families is shown to be the source of similar abilities, as with Terra, Geo-Force, and their maternal uncle Baron Bedlam. In &quot;Evolution&quot;, it is revealed Vandal Savage was the first metahuman because of the fallen meteor which bestowed him a healing factor and super-intelligence on Mongolia during the Pleistocene. Earth&#x27;s metahumans, many Atlanteans, and all homo magi in &quot;Young Justice&quot; all trace their lineage to Savage.

====Arrowverse====
In the Arrowverse family of live-action shows, &quot;metahuman&quot; is used more narrowly than in the comics, typically referring to a human being who becomes transhuman and has uncanny abilities, often acquired following some kind of strange accident.
* In the 2014 television series &quot;The Flash&quot;, Dr. Harrison Wells and his team at Scientific and Technological Advanced Research Laboratories (S.T.A.R. Labs) developed an advanced particle accelerator in Central City. When it was activated, the device went critical and exploded, releasing a variety of theoretical elements such as dark matter and negative energy. Many Central City residents who were affected by the blast wave were genetically altered by the dark matter, granting them superhuman abilities. People with such abilities are called &quot;metahumans,&quot; coined by Wells and his staff. The nature of a metahuman&#x27;s powers appear to be a result of an external element that they were near or exposed to when hit by the blast. Eventually, under Harrison Wells and Cisco Ramon, S.T.A.R. Labs develops effective metahuman-power dampening technology and prison to confine metahumans. Over the course of the series, many more metahuman villains appear, including some from alternate universes or timelines and others who have no connection to the particle accelerator accident. In season three, S.T.A.R. Labs uses metahuman-detecting apps to alert the Flash&#x27;s team to attacks; this technology is later used by city police and government agencies. In season five, Team Flash discovers meta-technology has been created following their battle with Thinker, resulting in any dark matter-powered device utilizing the power of a metahuman when wielded by anyone. Examples being Cicada&#x27;s dagger enabling the user to negate metahuman abilities, Spin&#x27;s smartphone enabling the user to control the minds of anyone through written hypnosis, Weather Witch&#x27;s staff enabling the user to control the weather and teleport through lightning, and Silver Ghost&#x27;s key fob enabling the user to control any motorized vehicles.
* After &quot;The Flash&quot; established the existence of metahumans, its sister series &quot;Arrow&quot; began to feature them, beginning with the arrival of metahuman villain Deathbolt in Starling City (later changed to Star City); the team learns that Deathbolt&#x27;s powers were not derived from the particle accelerator blast, revealing the existence of metahumans from other means. Later on, the metahuman Double Down arrives in Star City to kill the Green Arrow and his teammates under the employment of the mystic Damien Darhk, though he fails to do so. Magical characters such as Darhk, Constantine, and Vixen recur in subsequent episodes, as well as occasional metahuman threats. 
* &quot;Arrow&quot; and &quot;Flash&quot; spin-off &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot; features numerous metahumans, including Hawkman, Hawkgirl, and Vandal Savage (introduced in an &quot;Arrow&quot;/&quot;Flash&quot; crossover), as well as characters from other Arrowverse shows. Later seasons introduce versions of Vixen, Isis, and Steel. 
* The television series &quot;Supergirl&quot; is set in a parallel universe to that of &quot;Arrow&quot;, &quot;The Flash&quot;, and &quot;Legends of Tomorrow&quot;, in which a variant of Earth where Supergirl resides is later coined as Earth-38 by Cisco Ramon. Humanity is aware of superpowered extraterrestrials such as Supergirl, her cousin Superman, and J&#x27;onn J&#x27;onzz, but the existence of metahumans is not widely known on Earth-38 until the first season&#x27;s episode &quot;Worlds Finest,&quot; a crossover with &quot;The Flash&quot;. In this episode, the Silver Banshee and Livewire publicly battle Supergirl and the Flash, revealing the case of transhuman beings with uncanny abilities in the process. Silver Banshee&#x27;s powers are mystical in origin and nature, while Livewire&#x27;s are from an anomalous mutagenic accident. Since the inhabitants of Supergirl&#x27;s Earth have no experience with metahuman threats, the Flash provides National City&#x27;s authorities with the means to combat and contain them before returning to his universe. Later, in season two&#x27;s episode &quot;We Can Be Heroes&quot;, shows that a prison facility at National City is using the Flash&#x27;s world&#x27;s (Earth-1) metahuman-power dampeners to restrain its transhuman prisoners; the technology is later used by Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO) and eventually they align with Earth-1&#x27;s S.T.A.R. Labs. Human criminals begin experimenting on metahumans after the revelation of the possibility of transhumanism since their emergences in hopes of acquiring powers for themselves with goals to battle against extraterrestrial beings such as Supergirl, of which three metahumans were created with Livewire&#x27;s powers. In season three, more metahumans begin to appear, including Psi, whose powers surface following her maturity. In season four, a serum developed by Lena Luthor, derived from a mineral from the planet Krypton called Harun-El (a black kryptonite), gives both Lex Luthor and James Olsen metahuman abilities including superhuman strength and invulnerability equivalent to a Kryptonian&#x27;s, accelerated healing process, and heightened senses.
* In the television series &quot;Black Lightning&quot;, set in an Arrowverse&#x27;s Earth, Jefferson Pierce / Black Lightning and his daughters Anissa and Jennifer are metahumans. The A.S.A. are tracking young metahumans with abilities. As the series progresses, it is revealed that decades ago, because of the city of Freeland&#x27;s prevailing racial and political conflicts, the A.S.A. developed a substance supposedly as a suppressant to turn its citizens docile in the interest of controlling them but failed. Instead, it turned out to be a mutagen which transforms some of its citizens into metahumans, including Jefferson Pierce and his daughters who inherited his metagene after his fatherhood. Under Martin Procter, the agency illegally developed an addictive derivative of the drug called Green Light, which is distributed as a recreational drug in hopes to create more metahumans for Procter&#x27;s agendas. Because the metahumans are dying from unstable mutations, Procter seeks to capture Black Lightning and his offspring because they are the only known stable specimens of the agency&#x27;s drug. After Procter&#x27;s death, the A.S.A.&#x27;s experiments are exposed and Freeland&#x27;s metahumans&#x27; origin has become a public knowledge. However, it ignites an anti-metahuman bigotry amongst the people in Freeland.

====&quot;Gotham&quot;====
In the television series &quot;Gotham&quot;, Professor Hugo Strange experiments with dead (and alive) bodies of criminals, Arkham Asylum patients, and civilians under the orders of the Court of Owls. There, Strange gives his victims superhuman abilities such as shapeshifting (Clayface), mind control (Fish Mooney) and super strength (Azrael). By the end of Season 2, Strange&#x27;s victims escape and wreak havoc in the city. Throughout the series, the metahumans are commonly referred to as Strange&#x27;s Monsters, simply Monsters (an allusion to the miniseries &quot;Dark Moon Rising: Batman &amp; the Monster Men&quot;), or the Freaks from Indian Hill.

===DC Extended Universe===
* In &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, Lex Luthor is stated to be a supporter of the &quot;metahuman thesis.&quot; Secretly, he is already conducting studies on them, with particular interest on Wonder Woman, the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg, all of whom he classifies as metahumans.
* Metahumans also appear in the movie &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; as Amanda Waller talks about their abilities when forming the squad. El Diablo, Killer Croc and Enchantress appear in the film, while its sequel &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; features metahumans T.D.K (The Detachable Kid) and Polka-Dot Man.

===DC Universe===
In the rebooted DC Universe created by James Gunn, he has established that metahumans have been around for a long time, and that &quot;there&#x27;s more of them today than there used to be, and they&#x27;re more of an issue&quot;.

<text>In web development, &quot;tag soup&quot; is a pejorative for HTML written for a web page that is syntactically or structurally incorrect. Web browsers have historically treated structural or syntax errors in HTML leniently, so there has been little pressure for web developers to follow published standards. Therefore there is a need for all browser implementations to provide mechanisms to cope with the appearance of &quot;tag soup&quot;, accepting and correcting for invalid syntax and structure where possible.

An HTML parser (part of a web browser) that is capable of interpreting HTML-like markup even if it contains invalid syntax or structure may be called a tag soup parser. All major web browsers currently have a tag soup parser for interpreting malformed HTML, with most error-handling elements standardized.

&quot;Tag soup&quot; encompasses many common authoring mistakes, such as malformed HTML tags, improperly nested HTML elements, and unescaped character entities (especially ampersands (&amp;) and less-than signs (&lt;)).

The Markup Validation Service is a resource for web page authors to avoid creating tag soup.

==Overview==
&quot;Tag soup&quot; is a term used to denigrate various practices in web authoring. Some of these (roughly ordered from most severe to least severe) include:

# Malformed markup where tags are improperly nested or incorrectly closed. For example, the following:&lt;p&gt;This is a malformed fragment of &lt;em&gt;HTML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
# Invalid structure where elements are improperly nested according to the DTD for the document. Examples of this include nesting a &quot;ul&quot; element directly inside another &quot;ul&quot; element for any of the HTML 4.01 or XHTML DTDs. Dan Connolly cites the use of title element outside the head section.
# Use of proprietary or undefined elements and attributes instead of those defined in W3C recommendations. For example the use of the Blink element or the Marquee element which were non-standard elements originally only supported by Netscape and Internet Explorer browsers respectively.

==Causes and implications==

===Malformed markup===
Malformed markup is arguably the most severe problem in web authoring. However, thanks to better education and information and perhaps with some help from XHTML, the issue of malformed markup is becoming less common. Browsers, when faced with malformed markup, must guess the intended meaning of the author. They must infer closing tags where they expect them and then infer opening tags to match other closing-tags. The interpretation can vary markedly from one browser to the next.

While many graphical web editors produce well-formed markup, an author writing code manually with a text-editor and then testing only in one browser can easily miss such errors. The presentation can therefore vary drastically from one browser to another as each tries to &quot;correct&quot; the authorʼs intent in different ways and then applies styling to those &quot;corrections&quot;.

===Invalid document structure===
Invalid document structure here means only the use of attributes and elements where they do not belong. For example, placing a &quot;cite&quot; attribute on a &quot;cite&quot; element is invalid since the HTML and XHTML DTDs do not ascribe any meaning to that attribute on that element. Similarly, including a &quot;p&quot; element within the content of an &quot;em&quot; element is also invalid. With the move toward separating malformed markup from invalid markup, the problems with invalid markup have increasingly been seen as less severe. Some have begun to advocate looser content models that allow greater flexibility in authoring HTML documents (whether in HTML or XHTML). However, use of invalid markup can blur the author&#x27;s intended meaning, though not as severely as malformed markup.

Many graphic web editors still produce invalid markup. Moreover, many professional web designers and authors pay little attention to issues of validity. It is common to see invalid markup in many of the sites throughout the World Wide Web.

===Use of proprietary/discontinued elements===
In the early age of the web (much of the 1990s), the design of the official HTML specification became increasingly strained, compared to the desire of designers for flexibility in creating visually vibrant designs. In response to this pressure, browser makers unilaterally added new proprietary features to HTML that fell outside the standards at the time. This meant there were proprietary elements in HTML that worked in some browsers, but not in others.

To some extent, this problem was slowed by the introduction of new standards by the W3C, such as CSS, introduced in 1998, which helped to provide greater flexibility in the presentation and layout of web pages without the need for large numbers of additional HTML elements and attributes.

Moreover, in HTML 4 and XHTML 1, many elements were either superseded by a single semantic construct (such as &quot;object&quot; elements replacing proprietary &quot;applet&quot; and &quot;embed&quot; elements) or deprecated due to being presentational (such as the &quot;s&quot;, &quot;strike&quot; and &quot;u&quot; elements).

Nevertheless, browser developers continued to introduce new elements to HTML when they perceived a need. Some browsers included tabindex attributes on any element. Developers of Apple&#x27;s WebKit introduced the &quot;canvas&quot; element, a version of which was subsequently adopted by Mozilla.

In 2004, Apple, Mozilla and Opera founded the WHATWG, with the intent of creating a new version of the HTML specification which all browser behavior would match. This included changing the specification if necessary to match an existing consensus between different browsers.

The &quot;canvas&quot; and &quot;embed&quot; elements were subsequently standardised by the WHATWG. Certain elements (including &quot;b&quot;, &quot;i&quot; and &quot;small&quot;) which were previously considered presentational and deprecated were included, but defined in a media-independent rather than visual manner.

Versions of the WHATWG specification were published by the W3C as HTML5.

==Evolving specifications to solve tag soup==
While some of the issues of tag soup are due to shortcomings of browsers and sometimes due to a lack of information for web authors, some of the proliferation of tag soup was due to missing links in the web standards themselves. The W3C has spearheaded several efforts to address the shortcomings of web standards. As more browsers support newer revisions of standards, the pressure on web developers to use non-standard code to solve problems diminishes.

===Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)===
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) provide a mechanism to specify the presentation of elements in a document without altering the markup structure of the document. Before CSS was commonplace, web developers may have resorted to some structurally invalid markup to achieve certain presentational goals – for example, including block level elements within inline elements to obtain a particular effect, or using sometimes large numbers of codice_1 and other display-specific HTML tags. CSS uses style rules to accomplish these tasks while leaving the markup cleaner and simpler.

===XML and XHTML===
XHTML is a reformulation of the HTML language based on XML. XHTML was developed to address many of the problems associated with tag soup.

XML allows parsers to separate the process of interpreting the document syntax and its structure. In HTML and SGML, a parser needed to know certain rules about elements during parsing, such as what elements could be contained within other elements and which elements implicitly close the previous element. This is because in HTML and SGML, closing tags and even opening tags were optional on some elements. By requiring all elements to have explicit opening and closing tags, XML parsers can parse the document and produce a document tree without any knowledge of the document type. This allows parsers to be universal and very light-weight, and to be separated from the process of validating or interpreting the document.

The XML specification clearly defines that a conforming user agent (such as a web browser) must not accept a document, and not continue parsing it, if any syntactical error is encountered. Thus, a browser interpreting a web page as XHTML will refuse to display the page if it encounters a formation error. This can help ensure that when authors test XHTML code against a conforming browser they will immediately be informed of malformation problems: perhaps the most severe problem facing web browsers. When code is malformed, the intent of the author is ambiguous. Without the directives of XML, HTML browsers must use complex algorithms to infer the author&#x27;s intended meaning in a wide range of cases where invalid syntax is encountered.

XML and XHTML introduce the concept of namespaces. With namespaces, authors or communities of authors can define new elements and attributes with new semantics, and intermix those within their XHTML documents. Namespaces ensure that element names from the various namespaces will not be conflated. For example, a &quot;table&quot; element could be defined in a new namespace with new semantics different from the HTML &quot;table&quot; element and the browser will be able to differentiate between the two. In providing namespaces, XHTML combined with CSS allow authoring communities to easily extend the semantic vocabulary of documents. This accommodates the use of proprietary elements so long as those elements can be presented to the intended audience through complete style sheet definitions (including aural/speech and tactile styles).

XHTML documents may be served on the web using the internet media type codice_2 or codice_3 Microsoft Internet Explorer versions before 9 do not display XHTML documents served as codice_2. IE9 and later versions are compliant. See also the discussion of this issue in the XHTML article.

===HTML5===

HTML5 aims to be the most complete solution to the problem of tag soup thus far while remaining as backwards- and forwards-compatible as possible. By contrast to XHTML, which departs from backwards compatibility and takes the approach that parsers should become less tolerant of badly formed markup, HTML5 acknowledges that badly formed HTML code already exists in large quantities and will probably continue to be used, and takes the view that the specification should be expanded to ensure maximum compatibility with such code.

Thus, the HTML 5 specification has altered its definition of HTML syntax both to accommodate common syntax in use today, and to explicitly describe exactly how &quot;badly formed code&quot; should be treated by the parser. The handling of badly formed code now has a place in the specification itself, hopefully reducing the need for future HTML parsers to implement additional, out-of-specification measures for dealing with code that it does not recognize.

===Tools===
Many software tools exist which can parse and attempt to correct malformed markup, among other functions.
* HTML Tidy is a software tool available for many platforms which can correct invalid syntax, and most invalid document structure, converting HTML-like code to HTML or XHTML.
* Aggiorno is a Visual Studio add-in that focuses on making websites standards-compliant
* TagSoup is a Java library that parses HTML, cleans it up, and delivers a stream of SAX events representing well-formed XML (not necessarily valid XHTML). This tools is used for processing JNLP files in the open source implementation of the JNLP protocol available in IcedTea-Web, a sub-project of IcedTea, the build and integration project of the OpenJDK.
* Beautiful Soup is a Python DOM-like parser for HTML/XML which can handle malformed markup.
* tagsoup: a library for Haskell language.

== Valid deviations from XHTML ==
Unlike the strict XHTML, HTML and its predecessor SGML are designed to be written by humans, and already have a significant degree of flexibility in syntax to reduce boilerplate. These differences do not make the document invalid and are therefore not tag soup. The following apply to both HTML 4 and HTML5, and examples date back to the first days of HTML.

* Tags like can often be omitted completely.
* The closure of tags can often be omitted because the specification rejects some elements nesting into itself. For example, multiple elements can be written without closing.

Despite their validity, these omissions still require a special parser with a knowledge of HTML (as opposed to the more rigid XML) to parse. In addition, it is common for tools to &quot;fix&quot; these structures too. For example, HTML Tidy allows omitting optional tags, but defaults to not doing so.

<text>Film4 Productions is a British film production company owned by Channel Four Television Corporation. The company has been responsible for backing many films made in the United Kingdom. The company&#x27;s first production was &quot;Walter&quot;, directed by Stephen Frears, which was released in 1982. It is especially known for its gritty, kitchen sink-style films and period dramas.

== History ==
In 1981, producer David Rose left the BBC for Channel 4 where he was appointed the Commissioning Editor for Fiction by Jeremy Isaacs, the channel&#x27;s founding Chief Executive but became mostly identified with the Film on Four strand. With an initial overall budget of £6 million a year, Channel Four Films was to invest in twenty films annually for Film on Four. The first film backed was Neil Jordan&#x27;s debut film &quot;Angel&quot; (1982). The first film shown as part of Film on Four was Stephen Frears&#x27;s &quot;Walter&quot; which was screened on 2 November 1982, the launch date of Channel 4. &quot;P&#x27;tang, Yang, Kipperbang&quot; screened the following day was also an early highlight. Originally, the company&#x27;s films were intended for television screenings alone; the &quot;holdback&quot; system prevented investment in theatrical films by television companies because of the length of time (then three years) before broadcasters could screen them. An agreement soon concluded with the Cinema Exhibitors Association allowed a brief period of cinema exhibition if the budget of the films was below £1.25 million. Channel Four Films struck several deals with other film production companies including the BFI Production Board, Goldcrest Films and Merchant Ivory. By 1984, Channel Four Films were investing in a third of the feature films made in the UK.

Channel Four&#x27;s Business Development Department was formed in 1983 for TV and film sales and they also invested in foreign films including Wim Wenders&#x27; &quot;Paris, Texas&quot; (1984) and Jan Svankmajer&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; (1988). In 1985 FilmFour International was created as a separate international film sales arm and to invest in foreign film, including Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Sacrifice&quot; (1986).

Channel Four Film&#x27;s first big hit was Frears&#x27; third feature film for the cinema, &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;, in 1985. Originally shot in 16mm for Channel 4 it was met with such critical acclaim at the Edinburgh Film Festival that it was acquired by Orion Classics and distributed to cinemas and became an international success.

In 1987, FilmFour International agreed a licensing deal with Orion Classics to handle US distribution of two more FilmFour features, &quot;Rita, Sue and Bob Too&quot; and &quot;A Month in the Country&quot;. By 1987, Channel 4 had an interest in half the films being made in the United Kingdom.

Rose and Channel Four Films are credited by many as being a significant figure in the regeneration of British cinema and particularly remembered for films such as &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Dance With a Stranger&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, and &quot;Letter to Brezhnev&quot;. Channel Four Films also invested in early Working Title Films as well as most of the films of Frears, Ken Loach and Mike Leigh. Leigh told writer Hannah Rothschild around 2008 that Film on Four had saved the British film industry: &quot;This is a non-negotiable, historical fact of life and anybody who suggests that this isn&#x27;t the case is simply either suffering from some kind of ignorance or has got some terrible chip.&quot;

Rose remained in his post as Commissioning Editor until March 1990. During his tenure at Channel 4, Rose approved the making of 136 films, half of which received cinema screenings. Of the films Rose backed, 20 were from overseas sources, including work by directors Theo Angelopoulos, Andrei Tarkovsky and Wim Wenders. The company also helped British minority filmmakers including Po-Chih Leong (&quot;Ping Pong&quot; (1986)); Horace Ové (&quot;Playing Away&quot; (1986)) and Hanif Kureishi (&quot;My Beautiful Laundrette&quot;; &quot;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid&quot; (1987)). This continued after Rose&#x27;s departure with films directed by Gurinder Chadha (&quot;Bhaji on the Beach&quot; (1993)) and Steve McQueen (&quot;Hunger&quot; (2008)).

David Aukin joined as head of drama in October 1990 and took over responsibility for Film on Four. He changed his title to head of film in 1997 which he remained until 1998.

The company had another big international success with Jordan&#x27;s &quot;The Crying Game&quot; in 1992. In addition it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture as was &quot;Howards End&quot; the same year. &quot;Damage&quot; also received an Academy Award nomination that year. Later in 1993, Leigh&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot; and Loach&#x27;s &quot;Raining Stones&quot; were entered into competition at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival.

The following year, Mike Newell&#x27;s &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; became the highest-grossing UK film of all time and Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Trainspotting&quot; (1996) was also very successful.

In the 1990s, Channel Four partnered with The Samuel Goldwyn Company to create a distribution company to release Channel Four films and Goldwyn films in the UK but Goldwyn pulled out late on and in August 1995, Film Four Distributors was formed. Its first release was &quot;Blue Juice&quot; (1995) and its first major successes were &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; and &quot;Brassed Off&quot; in 1996.

In 1998, the company was re-branded as FilmFour with an annual budget of £32 million for 8 to 10 films. &quot;East Is East&quot; (1999) becomes their biggest self-funded film. In 2000, the company signed a three-year deal with Warner Bros. to make seven films with budgets of more than £13 million but their first, &quot;Charlotte Gray&quot; (2001) was not the success they hoped for.

The company cut its budget and staff significantly in 2002, due to mounting losses, and was reintegrated into the drama department of Channel 4. The name &quot;Film4 Productions&quot; was introduced in 2006 to tie in with the relaunch of the FilmFour broadcast channel as Film4.

Tessa Ross was head of both Film4 and Channel 4 drama from 2002 to 2014.

<text>Franklin Field is a sports stadium in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, at the eastern edge of the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s campus. Named after Penn&#x27;s founder, Benjamin Franklin, it is the home stadium for the Penn Relays, and the university&#x27;s venue for football, track and field, and lacrosse. Franklin is also used by Penn students for recreation, intramural and club sports, including touch football and cricket; it is also the site of Penn&#x27;s commencement exercises, weather permitting.

Franklin Field is the oldest still operating college football stadium in the nation. It was the first college stadium in the United States with a scoreboard and the second with an upper deck of seats. In 1922, it was the site of the first radio broadcast of a football game on WIP, as well as of the first television broadcast of a football game by Philco.

From 1958 through 1970, Franklin Field was the home of the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). It hosted the NFL Championship Game in December 1960, as the Eagles defeated the Green Bay Packers by four points.

==History==
===19th century===
Until around 1860, the grounds of what became Franklin Field served as a potter&#x27;s field. The crania of some of these individuals were acquired by Samuel Morton and are now housed in the Penn Museum.

Franklin Field was built for and dedicated on April 20, 1895, for the first running of the Penn Relays. The Field supplemented and eventually replaced the venue called University Grounds, which was located a few blocks west on a block bounded by Spruce Street (north), 38th Street (east), Pine Street (south), Woodland Avenue and 37th Street T-intersection (northwest). Its location was typically given as &quot;37th and Spruce&quot;.

===20th century===
Permanent Franklin Field construction did not begin until after the turn of the century. Weightman Hall gymnasium, the stadium, and permanent grandstands were designed by architect Frank Miles Day &amp; Brother and were erected from 1903 to 1905 at a cost of . The field was long and wide. The site featured a ¼-mile track, a football field, and a baseball diamond. Beneath the stands were indoor tracks and indoor training facilities.

In 1916, university officials, led by George Neitzche, planned with the city to build a new 100,000-seat half-sunken stadium for $750,000 at Woodland Ravine, a depression on the southeastern side of Woodland Cemetery. Plans called for a new train station called Union Station which would feature a Pennsylvania Railroad stop and a stop on a proposed (and never built) elevated subway line connected to the Market–Frankford Line. Architecture firm Koronski &amp; Cameron created a rendering but plans quickly collapsed. Five years later, it was decided instead to expand Franklin Field.

====1922 rebuilding====
The current stadium structure was built in the 1920s, designed by Day &amp; Klauder, after the original wooden bleachers were torn down. The lower tier was erected in 1922. The old wood stands were razed immediately following the Penn Relays and the new concrete lower tier and seating for 50,000 were built. The second tier was added in 1925, again designed by Day &amp; Klauder, when it became the second and the largest two-tiered stadium in the United States.

The stadium was designed of steel and concrete in the shape of a letter &quot;U&quot;. Initial cost was estimated around $725,000. At the time of its construction, it was noted that Franklin Field was one of the few large fields which was built to support baseball as well as football and track sports. Most other large stadia were meant only for football and track.

The first football radio broadcast originated from Franklin Field in 1922, carried by Philadelphia station WIP. This claim is pre-empted by an earlier live radio broadcast emanating from Forbes Field in Pittsburgh, on October 8, 1921, a full year before Franklin Field&#x27;s claim to fame. Harold W. Arlin announced the live broadcast of the Pitt-West Virginia football game on October 8, 1921, on radio station KDKA. The first commercial football television broadcast in 1939 also came from Franklin Field.

The 1936 Democratic National Convention was concluded at Franklin Field, where President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his acceptance speech after being renominated for a second term.

In the 1930s and 1940s, Penn led the nation in attendance. The 65,000-seat stadium was expanded each fall with temporary stands to seat 78,000.

The annual Thanksgiving Cornell–Penn game, broadcast on national radio, attracted a reported 70,000 to the stadium in 1931. The game earned a story on the front page of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; along with a quarter-by-quarter breakdown of every detail of the game. The 1947 game attracted a crowd estimated in contemporary reports at &quot;about 80,000&quot;.

By the start of the 21st Century, Franklin Field seated 52,958.

Franklin Field switched from natural grass to AstroTurf in 1969 and became first NFL stadium with artificial turf. (The Houston Oilers of the AFL had moved into the Astrodome (with AstroTurf) the previous season.) The stadium&#x27;s fifth AstroTurf surface was installed in 1993, and the current Sprinturf field replaced it in 2004. Tenants since 1958, the Eagles moved to Veterans Stadium in 1971, also with artificial turf.

Franklin Field was considered a candidate to host games for the 1994 World Cup. FIFA required that host stadiums have natural grass. Had Philadelphia been selected and Franklin Field used, the stadium would have had to return to a grass surface, or perhaps use a temporary grass field as was done at two World Cup sites—Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, and the Pontiac Silverdome in Pontiac, Michigan.

===21st century===
After 125 years, the original 1895 concrete stands were deteriorating badly. An extensive $44 million renovation to reinforce the concrete began in 2015. The project was staggered over multiple phases, which allowed the continued use of the stadium during renovation work. Previous coatings were removed, the failing sections were replaced, and rebar throughout the structure was reinforced. The project was completed by September 2023 and received a historic preservation award.

==Athletics==
===Football===
====Penn Quakers====


Penn football played on Franklin Field for the first time in 1895. The University of Pennsylvania was one of the top football schools in the first years of college football. Many consider Penn to have been the national champion in college football in 1894, 1895, 1897 and 1904. Other sources identify Penn as national champions in 1895, 1897, 1904 and 1908.

John H. Outland played at Franklin Field for Penn in 1897 and 1898. On October 26, 1907, Jim Thorpe and the Carlisle Indian school trounced a powerful University of Pennsylvania team, 26–6, before an overflow crowd of 20,000 at Franklin Field.

On October 26, 1918, with the Spanish flu sweeping through the city, the Penn football team played the Navy Yard&#x27;s Marines football club at an empty Franklin Field with the stadium closed to fans to prevent the spread of the virus.

Red Grange set an NCAA record at Franklin Field when he rushed for 331 yards in the University of Illinois&#x27; 24–2 victory over Penn on October 31, 1925, before 67,877 spectators.

On Saturday, November 16, 2002, ESPN broadcast College GameDay from Franklin Field prior to the game between Penn and Harvard. Both teams entered the game undefeated, 5–0, in the conference. It was College GameDay&#x27;s first broadcast from a Division I-AA college. Penn won the contest, 44–9, and was undefeated and untied for the season. Harvard finished 6–1 in conference, 7–3 overall.

The Penn Quakers football team played their 800th game ever at the stadium on October 4, 2008, against Dartmouth.

===Philadelphia Eagles===

The Philadelphia Eagles played at Franklin Field from 1958 through 1970. They moved to the stadium for the 1958 season after leaving Connie Mack Stadium: Franklin Field would seat over 60,000 for the Eagles whereas Connie Mack had a capacity of 39,000. According to then-Eagles president Frank L. McNamee, the Eagles did not pay rent for use of Franklin Field because Penn was a not-for-profit organization. Instead, the Eagles donated between $75,000 and $100,000 per-year to pay for maintenance and other expenses. The university collected all concessions and parking revenue.

On October 11, 1959, NFL Commissioner Bert Bell died at the nearby university hospital after suffering a heart attack at Franklin Field during the last two minutes of the game between the Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers.

The Eagles hosted the 1960 NFL Championship Game here on December 26, defeating the favored Green Bay Packers 17–13 in head coach Vince Lombardi&#x27;s only career playoff loss. Two years earlier, the two franchises had finished second last and last in the twelve-team league: the attendance for the title game was 67,325. As the venue did not have lights at the time, the game started at noon to allow overtime to be played if required.

Two infamous incidents in Eagles history occurred at the stadium.

====Santa Claus booed====

During the 1968 season finale against the Minnesota Vikings on December 15, a Christmas show was planned for halftime. The struggling Eagles entered the game at 2–11, and fans were less than pleased with Eagles quarterback Norm Snead (injured in preseason), owner Jerry Wolman, and especially coach Joe Kuharich: many fans came to the game wearing &quot;Joe Must Go&quot; buttons. Unfortunately, the man meant to play Santa was unable to make it to Franklin Field due to the bad weather.

In lieu of the original halftime show, a 19-year-old fan named Frank Olivo (who came to the stadium already wearing a Santa Claus costume) was invited onto the field to toss candy canes with the cheerleaders. Frustrated by the team, the ugly wet weather, and his unconvincing beard, fans booed Olivo and threw snowballs at him. This incident is often referred to by sportscasters in denigrating Philadelphia sports fans as being so mean they booed Santa Claus. The Eagles lost the game, 24–17. Olivo continued to attend Eagles games and even made a return as Santa Claus four decades later, at the Eagles&#x27; December 27, 2009, game against the Denver Broncos at Lincoln Financial Field. This time, Olivo was not targeted by snowballs. Frank Olivo died in 2015 at age 66.

====Howard Cosell taken ill====
In the first season of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in 1970, announcer Howard Cosell was apparently drunk during the Eagles-New York Giants game on November 23. After throwing up on color commentator Don Meredith&#x27;s cowboy boots shortly before halftime, Cosell left the stadium and took a taxi back to New York City. Meredith and play-by-play announcer Keith Jackson made little mention of his departure during the second half.

Later, denying drunkenness, Cosell said that he had been dizzy from running laps around Franklin Field&#x27;s track before the game with track star Tommie Smith. Cosell was 52 years old at the time.

===Other college football===

The Army–Navy Game was played 18 times at Franklin Field between 1899 and 1935 before moving to the larger Municipal Stadium in South Philadelphia in 1936. Penn alumnus and Olympic-medalist George Orton (who had worked with Frank Ellis in managing the Penn Relays) is credited with helping to bring the game to Philadelphia in 1899.

Temple University played its home football games at Temple Stadium until the late 1970s. Temple Stadium, which opened in 1928, seated up to 34,000 for football. Over the years, Temple had played home games at Franklin Field when crowds were expected to exceed Temple Stadium&#x27;s capacity. Temple moved its home games to Veterans Stadium in the late 1970s but the Phillies had priority for the field for Saturdays during baseball season, which ends the last week in September. When Temple home games conflicted with Phillies home games, Temple would play at Franklin Field. This continued through the 2002 season, Temple&#x27;s final year at the Vet before the Owls moved to Lincoln Financial Field as tenants of the Eagles. One of the last Temple football games at Franklin Field was a 44–21 loss to the number-one-ranked Miami Hurricanes on September 14, 2002; Miami&#x27;s Willis McGahee rushed for 134 yards and four touchdowns in front of 33,169 fans.

In 2016, the multi-division Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) held the second installment of its six NCAA Division III post-season bowl games (over three days) at Franklin Field for select member teams that did not make the DIII playoffs. In the series&#x27;s inaugural year, the games were played at Arute Field in New Britain, Connecticut. The bowl series will move to Delaware Stadium in 2017, but will return to Franklin Field in 2018.

===Other professional football===
The NFL&#x27;s Frankford Yellow Jackets hosted the Dayton Triangles on September 24, 1927, at Franklin Field. The Yellow Jackets usually played their home games in the Frankford section of Philadelphia. The Triangles won, 6–3.

On August 23, 1958, a Canadian Football League game was played at Franklin Field, as the Hamilton Tiger-Cats defeated the Ottawa Rough Riders, 13–7. (The contest remains the only regular season CFL game played outside Canada between two Canada-based teams.)

The Philadelphia Bell of the World Football League played their 1975 home games at Franklin Field. (The Bell drew fewer than 12,000 fans total to five home games before the WFL folded in October.)

When the United States Football League&#x27;s Philadelphia Stars had to move their 1984 playoff games out of the Vet (because the Philadelphia Phillies had games scheduled on those dates), they played at Franklin Field. On June 30, 1984, the Stars defeated the New Jersey Generals, 28–7, behind two touchdowns from Kelvin Bryant; a crowd of 19,038 saw the game on a warm and overcast afternoon. A week later, the Stars downed the Birmingham Stallions, 20-10, in the Eastern Conference championship game at Franklin Field, in front of 26,616 fans. (Both games were carried by ABC Sports, as was the 1984 USFL Championship Game, in which Philadelphia crushed the Arizona Wranglers, 23-3, to claim the league title.)

===Track and field===
====Penn Relays====
Franklin Field has hosted the annual Penn Relays Carnival, the largest track-and-field meet in the U.S., for over 100 years.

The first Penn Relays was held in 1895. Frank B. Ellis, chairman of Penn&#x27;s track committee, was looking for an event to mark the dedication of the school&#x27;s then new stadium, Franklin Field. Two years earlier, during his senior year at Penn, Penn and Princeton competed in a one-mile relay race in which four runners from each school each ran a quarter of a mile. That race had been an outgrowth of intramural relay races held at Penn. Ellis and others arranged a series of relay races to take place on Saturday afternoon, April 20, 1895. 64 competitors from eight colleges, six prep schools and two high schools took part. Eight two-team races were run with Harvard beating Penn in the mile-relay feature in 3:34.4.

The Relays were featured in the April 29, 1961, premiere of ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

The 2020 and 2021 Penn Relays were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. These were the first times the event had been canceled since the event&#x27;s inception on April 21, 1895.

===Other meets===
The 2nd USSR-United States Track and Field dual meet was held at Franklin Field on July 18 and 19, 1959. Stars who competed included Parry O&#x27;Brien, Ray Norton, Al Cantello, Hayes Jones, Tamara Press, Vasili Kuznetsov, Dyrol Burleson, Greg Bell, a young Wilma Rudolph, and future long-jump great Igor Ter-Ovanesyan.

Franklin Field hosted the NCAA Men&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championship in June 1961, the first time the championship was held on the East Coast. Seven records were set, and the University of Southern California won its 21st team Track &amp; Field championship.

Following the Montreal 1976 Summer Olympics and in honor of the United States Bicentennial, Franklin Field hosted The Bicentennial Meet of Champions track and field event on August 4, 1976. Montreal Olympians at the meet included Hasely Crawford, Don Quarrie, Michael Shine and Edwin Moses. The meet was also a chance for top runners including Houston McTear who had not been able to compete in Montreal to race against medal winners. 13,722 attended the event and saw Dwight Stones set a record for the high-jump and John Walker win the mile.

The University of Pennsylvania hosted the two-day 1980 Liberty Bell Track and Field Classic, an alternate to the 1980 Summer Olympics for 26 countries participating in the American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics which were held in Moscow. The Liberty Bell Classic began on July 16, 1980. It was the largest international track meet held in the U.S. since the 1932 Summer Olympics in terms of the number of foreign competitors. Franklin Field hosted the track and field events where 20,111 spectators saw the final evening of competitions. In several events, the times were better than those in Moscow, such as American Renaldo Nehemiah&#x27;s time of 13.31 in the 110m hurdles ahead of East German gold medal winner Thomas Munkelt&#x27;s time of 13.39.

===Track configuration===
The track in Franklin Field has a rarely used configuration where the 400 metre circumference is achieved in lane 4, rather than in lane one. Thus there are two curbs on the track, inside of lane one and also inside of lane 4. In order to accommodate the full fields of the Penn Relays and other meets, special adaptations are made with a movable curb on the backstretch to stagger the runners to arrive at a common break point in lane 4, rather than the conventional lane one. Single lap races in the inner lanes, run portions of an extra straightaway. Multiple lap races spend the majority of the race in lane 4 to run the proper distances.

The Franklin Field track has utilized a Rekortan track surface since 1987. The track was last renovated in 2015 when ATT Sports, Inc., installed the current Rekortan M99 track surfacing. The track was resurfaced again by ATT Sports, Inc. in the summer of 2024.

Franklin Field served as the home field for Penn&#x27;s baseball, whose varsity baseball team played at Franklin Field beginning from 1895 through 1939.

Franklin Field was the longtime home of Philadelphia&#x27;s city title high school football championship game. The game was held at the stadium in 1938, 1940, 1941, and from 1943 through 1972, before it moved to Veterans Stadium.

The 1946 game, played before 60,000, ended in a riot when Northeast fans stormed the field in the final minute of the school&#x27;s 33–26 victory over West Catholic, prompting West Catholic fans to do the same.

The NASL Philadelphia Atoms had played at Veterans Stadium from 1973–1975. They moved to Franklin Field in 1976 which had better sight lines for soccer. Attendance was 8,400 for the home opener on May 2, 1976. They drew a season high of 25,000 for the July 17 match against the New York Cosmos which featured soccer great Pelé. The team averaged 6,449 at Franklin Field for their 11 home matches in 1976. The Philadelphia Fury hosted a play-off game against the Tampa Bay Rowdies on August 23, 1979, at Franklin Field when the Fury&#x27;s home field, Veterans Stadium, was being used by the Phillies.

Along with John F. Kennedy Stadium, also in Philadelphia, Franklin Field was one of 15 United States stadiums inspected by a five-member FIFA committee in April 1988 in the evaluation of the United States as a possible host of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. On August 25, 1989, a crowd of 43,356 at Franklin Field saw the US national soccer team defeat Dnepr of the Soviet Top League, 1–0; Eric Eichmann scored the lone goal in the game&#x27;s 12th minute.

===Films===
The 2000 M. Night Shyamalan–directed movie &quot;Unbreakable&quot; features Franklin Field as one of its main locations. Its main character, played by Bruce Willis, works as a security guard at the stadium.

In the 2006 movie &quot;Invincible&quot;, Franklin Field served as a stand-in for the demolished Veterans Stadium, whose images were digitally superimposed on some of the football action sequences.

===Politics===
The stadium was the site of the speech by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in which he accepted the 1936 Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for a second term as president. It is estimated that a crowd of 100,000 sat through intermittent rain at Franklin Field to hear FDR&#x27;s speech.

<doc id="689623" wikidata="Q5333381" url="?curid=689623" title="Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001">
<text>The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 was a major piece of tax legislation passed by the 107th United States Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It is also known by its abbreviation EGTRRA (often pronounced &quot;egg-tra&quot; or &quot;egg-terra&quot;), and is often referred to as one of the two &quot;Bush tax cuts&quot;.

Bush had made tax cuts the centerpiece of his campaign in the 2000 presidential election, and he introduced a major tax cut proposal shortly after taking office. Though a handful of Democrats supported the bill, most support came from congressional Republicans. The bill was passed by Congress in May 2001, and signed into law by Bush on June 7, 2001. Due to the narrow Republican majority in the United States Senate, EGTRRA was passed using the reconciliation process, which bypasses the Senate filibuster.

EGTRRA lowered federal income tax rates, reducing the top tax rate from 39.6 percent to 35 percent and reducing rates for several other tax brackets. The act also reduced capital gain taxes, raised pre-tax contribution limits for defined contribution plans and Individual Retirement Accounts, and reduced the estate tax. In 2003, Bush signed another bill, the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which contained further tax cuts and accelerated certain tax changes that were part of EGTRRA. Due to the rules concerning reconciliation, EGTRRA contained a sunset provision that would end the tax cuts in 2011, but most of the cuts were made permanent with the passage of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.

== Legislative history ==

Bush&#x27;s promise to cut taxes was the centerpiece of his 2000 presidential campaign, and upon taking office, he made tax cuts his first major legislative priority. A budget surplus had developed during the Bill Clinton administration, and with the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan&#x27;s support, Bush argued that the best use of the surplus was to lower taxes. By the time Bush took office, reduced economic growth had led to less robust federal budgetary projections, but Bush maintained that tax cuts were necessary to boost economic growth. After Treasury Secretary Paul O&#x27;Neill expressed concerns over the tax cut&#x27;s size and the possibility of future deficits, Vice President Cheney took charge of writing the bill, which the administration proposed to Congress in March 2001.

Bush initially sought a $1.6 trillion tax cut over a ten-year period, but ultimately settled for a $1.35 trillion tax cut. The administration rejected the idea of &quot;triggers&quot; that would phase out the tax reductions should the government again run deficits. The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act won the support of congressional Republicans and a minority of congressional Democrats, passing in the House on May 16. The bill was then passed in the Senate on May 26. President Bush signed it into law in June of 2001. The narrow Republican majority in the Senate necessitated the use of the reconciliation, which in turn necessitated that the tax cuts would phase out in 2011 barring further legislative action.

== Sunset provision ==
One of the most notable characteristics of EGTRRA is that its provisions were designed to &quot;sunset&quot; (or revert to the provisions that were in effect before it was passed) on January 1, 2011 (that is, for tax years, plan years, and limitation years that begin after December 31, 2010). After a two-year extension by the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, the Bush era rates for taxpayers making less than $400,000 per year ($450,000 for married couples) were ultimately made permanent by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The sunset provision allowed EGTRRA to sidestep the Byrd Rule, a Senate rule that amends the Congressional Budget Act to allow Senators to block a piece of legislation if it purports a significant increase in the federal deficit beyond ten years. The sunset allowed the bill to stay within the letter of the PAYGO law while removing nearly $700 billion from amounts that would have triggered PAYGO sequestration.

In addition to the tax cuts implemented by the EGTRRA, it initiated a series of rebates for all taxpayers that filed a tax return for 2000. The rebate was up to a maximum of $300 for single filers with no dependents, $500 for single parents, and $600 for married couples. Anybody who paid less than their maximum rebate amount in net taxes received that amount, meaning some people who did not pay any taxes did not receive rebates. The rebates were automatic for anybody who filed their 2000 tax return on time, or filed for an extension and quickly sent a return. If an eligible person did not receive a rebate check by December 2001, then they could apply for the rebate in their 2001 tax return.

==Major tax areas affected==
===Income tax===
EGTRRA generally reduced the rates of individual income taxes:

* a new 10% bracket was created for single filers with taxable income up to $6,000, joint filers up to $12,000, and heads of households up to $10,000.
* the 15% bracket&#x27;s lower threshold was indexed to the new 10% bracket
* the 28% bracket would be lowered to 25% by 2006.
* the 31% bracket would be lowered to 28% by 2006
* the 36% bracket would be lowered to 33% by 2006
* the 39.6% bracket would be lowered to 35% by 2006

The EGTRRA in many cases lowered the taxes on married couples filing jointly by increasing the standard deduction for joint filers to between 164% and 200% of the deduction for single filers.

Additionally, EGTRRA increased the per-child tax credit and the amount eligible for credit spent on dependent child care, phased out limits on itemized deductions and personal exemptions for higher income taxpayers, and increased the exemption for the Alternative Minimum Tax, and created a new depreciation deduction for qualified property owners.

===Capital gains tax===
The capital gains tax on qualified gains of property or stock held for five years was reduced from 10% to 8% for those in the 15% income tax bracket.

===Qualified and retirement plans===
EGTRRA introduced sweeping changes to retirement plans, incorporating many of the so-called Portman-Cardin provisions proposed by those House members in 2000 and earlier in 2001. Overall it raised pre-tax contribution limits for defined contribution plans and Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), increased defined benefit compensation limits, made non-qualified retirement plans more flexible and more similar to qualified plans such as 401(k)s, and created a &quot;catch-up&quot; provision for older workers.

EGTRRA allows, for the first time, for participants in non-qualified 401(a) money purchase, 403(b) tax-sheltered annuity, and governmental 457(b) deferred compensation plans (but not tax-exempt 457 plans) to &quot;roll over&quot; their money and consolidate accounts, whether to a different non-qualified plan, to a qualified plan such as a 401(k), or to an IRA. Prior rules only allowed plan moneys to leave the plan and maintain its tax deferred status only if the money went directly to an IRA or to an IRA and back into a &quot;like kind&quot; defined contribution retirement account. For example, 403(b) moneys leaving the old employer could only go to the new employer&#x27;s defined contribution plan if it were also a 403(b). Now the old 401(k) plan money could be transferred directly in a trustee-to-trustee &quot;rollover&quot; to an IRA and then from the IRA to a new employer&#x27;s 403(b) or the entire transfer could be directly from the old employer&#x27;s 403(b) to the new employer&#x27;s 401(k). That the new Tax Act allows employers to do so does not mean that any employer is forced to accept new money from the outside.

The so-called &quot;catch-up&quot; provision allows employees over the age of 50 to make additional contributions to their retirement plans over and above the normal limits. For workers who are already retired, the law raises the age for minimum required distributions (MRDs), directing the Treasury to revise its life expectancy tables and simplify MRD rules.

EGTRRA created two new retirement savings vehicles. The Deemed IRA or Sidecar IRA is a Roth IRA attached as a separate account to an employer-sponsored retirement plan; while the differing tax treatment is preserved for the employee, the funds may be commingled for investment purposes. It is an improvement upon the unpopular qualified voluntary employee contribution (QVEC) provision developed in the early 1980s. The so-called Roth 401(k)/403(b) is a new tax-qualified employer-sponsored retirement plan to become effective in 2006, and would offer tax treatment in a retirement plan similar to that offered to account holders of Roth IRAs.

For plan sponsors, the law requires involuntary cash-out distributions of 401(k) accounts into a default IRA. It accelerates the mandatory vesting schedule applied to matching contributions, but increases the portion of employer contributions permitted from profit sharing. Small employers are granted tax incentives to offer retirement plans to their employees, and sole proprietors, partners and S corporation shareholders gain the right to take loans from their company pension plans.

===Educational savings incentives===
House Republicans pushed Congress to provide incentives for those investing in education. One bill in the house was proposed to remove the time limit on student loan interest deductions. Their push was successful and was included in the final bill.

===Estate and gift tax rules===
The EGTRRA made sweeping changes to the estate tax, gift tax, and generation-skipping transfer tax.

* The estate tax unified credit exclusion, which was $675,000 in 2001 but scheduled to increase by steps to $1,000,000 in 2006, was increased to $1,000,000 in 2002, $1,500,000 in 2004, $2,000,000 in 2006, and $3,500,000 in 2009, with repeal of the estate tax and generation-skipping tax scheduled for 2010.
* The maximum estate tax, gift tax, and generation-skipping tax rate, which was 55% in 2001 (with an additional 5% for estates over $10,000,000 in order to eliminate the benefit of the lower estate tax brackets) was reduced to 50% in 2002, with an additional 1% reduction each year until 2007, when the top estate tax rate became 45%. P.L. 107-16 amended Code Section 2001 to change the rate to 49% in 2003, going down by 1% each year through 2009. (Because of the increasing exclusion and decreasing top tax rate, the estate tax effectively became a tax of 45% on estates over $2,000,000 in 2007.)
* The state estate tax credit, which effectively gave the states a part of the estate tax otherwise payable to the federal government, was phased out between 2002 and 2005 and replaced by a deduction for state estate taxes in 2005.
* The gift tax was not repealed, and the unified credit exclusion has remained at $1,000,000 for gift tax purposes despite the increases in the estate tax exclusion, but the maximum gift tax rate was reduced to 35% beginning in 2010.
* Because of the repeal of the estate tax in 2010, complicated new &quot;carry-over basis&quot; provisions were enacted which would increase the income tax on capital gains realized by some estates and heirs. (Under pre-EGTRRA law, property that is subject to estate tax gets a new income tax basis equal to fair market value, eliminating any capital gain on lifetime appreciation.)

Because EGTRRA was subject to a &quot;sunset&quot; provision, the estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxes were automatically supposed to be reinstated in 2011.

==Impact==

After the tax bill was passed, Senator Jim Jeffords left the Republican Party and began caucusing with the Democrats, giving them control of the Senate. After Republicans re-took control of the Senate during the 2002 mid-term elections, Bush proposed further tax cuts. With little support among Democrats, Congress passed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003(&quot;JGTRRA&quot;), which cut taxes by another $350 billion over 10 years. That law also lowered the capital gains tax and taxes on dividends. Collectively, the Bush tax cuts reduced federal individual tax rates to their lowest level since World War II, and government revenue as a share of gross domestic product declined from 20.9% in 2000 to 16.3% in 2004.

A 2012 Congressional Budget Office analysis found that the tax cut reduced federal tax receipts by $1.2 trillion over ten years.

<doc id="689626" wikidata="Q56059" url="?curid=689626" title="Departments of Uruguay">
<text>Uruguay consists of 19 departments (&quot;departamentos&quot;). Each department has a legislature, called a Departmental Board, and a chief executive called a &quot;Intendente&quot;.

==History==
The first division of Uruguay into six departments occurred on 27 January 1816. In February of the same year, two more departments were formed, and in 1828 one more was added. When the country&#x27;s first constitution was signed in 1830, there were nine departments: Montevideo, Maldonado, Canelones, San José, Colonia, Soriano, Paysandú, Durazno and Cerro Largo. At that time, the department of Paysandú occupied all the territory north of the Río Negro, which included the current departments of Artigas, Rivera, Tacuarembó, Salto, Paysandú and Río Negro.

On 17 June 1837, this northern territory was divided in three, by the creation of the departments of Salto and Tacuarembó. At the same time, the department of Minas (which was eventually renamed to Lavalleja) was created out of parts of Cerro Largo and Maldonado. In 1856 Florida was created, and on 7 July 1880 the department of Río Negro was split from Paysandú and Rocha was split from Maldonado. In 1884, Treinta y Tres was formed from parts of Cerro Largo and Minas, while Artigas was split from Salto. The same year the department of Rivera was split from Tacuarembó, and in 1885 Flores was split from San José.
== List of departments==
== Statutory framework ==
=== Establishment of departments ===
The General Assembly has the powers to create new departments, requiring a supermajority vote of two thirds in both chambers, as provided by the Constitution in article 85. The General Assembly can also define their borders, requiring the same majority.

=== Politics and governance ===
The basic statutory framework of departments is defined by Section XVI of the Constitution. Each department has executive and legislative branches, in the form of the Intendant and the Departmental Board respectively. The Municipal Organic Law No. 9515 regulates more specific details of these rules.

=== Finances ===
The sources of financial resources of the departmental governments are detailed in article 297 of the Constitution, being the departmental taxes, national taxes whose administration is granted to departments, earnings from services or incomes, money obtained from sanctions, donations, inheritances and bequests received and accepted, and their own part of the national budget that they were granted by budget laws.

==Municipalities==

Since 2009 (Law No. 18567 of 13 September 2009), the Uruguayan departments have been subdivided into municipalities. This system has been widely criticized as a waste of resources, due to Uruguay&#x27;s small population of 3.4 million. The inaugural municipal elections were held in 2010, with municipal officials assuming office later in the year. Currently there are 125 municipalities.

<doc id="689628" wikidata="Q1433654" url="?curid=689628" title="Virilization">
<text>Virilization or masculinization is the biological development of adult male characteristics in young males or females. Most of the changes of virilization are produced by androgens.

Virilization is a medical term commonly used in three medical and biology of sex contexts: prenatal biological sexual differentiation, the postnatal changes of typical chromosomal male (46, XY) puberty, and excessive androgen effects in typical chromosomal females (46, XX). It is also the intended result of androgen replacement therapy in males with delayed puberty and low testosterone.

==Prenatal virilization==
In the prenatal period, virilization refers to closure of the perineum, thinning and wrinkling (rugation) of the scrotum, growth of the penis, and closure of the urethral groove to the tip of the penis. In this context, &quot;masculinization&quot; is synonymous with &quot;virilization&quot;.

Prenatal virilization of XX fetuses and undervirilization of XY fetuses are common causes of ambiguous genitalia such as in conditions like Congenital adrenal hyperplasia and 5α-Reductase 2 deficiency.

For many years, it was widely believed that in mammals, the female is the &quot;default&quot; developmental pathway, and the SRY gene on the Y chromosome is responsible for suppressing the development of female characteristics and stimulating males characteristics. In this scenario, an embryo would passively develop female sexual characteristics without intervention by the SRY gene. However, in the early 2000s, other genes, such as WNT4 and RSPO1, were discovered that perform the opposite function – i.e., genes which suppress masculinization and stimulate feminization.

Two processes: defeminization, and masculinization, are involved in producing male typical morphology and behavior.

===High===
Prenatal virilization of a genetically female fetus can occur when an excessive amount of androgen is produced by the fetal adrenal glands or is present in maternal blood, resulting in virilization of the female genitalia such as an enlarged clitoris.

It can also be associated with progestin-induced virilisation.

===Low===
&quot;Undervirilization&quot; can occur if a genetic male cannot produce enough androgen or the body tissues cannot respond to it. Extreme undervirilization occurs when no significant androgen hormones can be produced or the body is completely insensitive to androgens, in which case a female phenotype will develop. Partial undervirilization produces ambiguous genitalia part-way between male and female. Examples of undervirilization in fetuses with a 46,XY karyotype are androgen insensitivity syndrome and 5 alpha reductase deficiency.

==Normal virilization==

In common as well as medical usage, virilization often refers to the process of normal male puberty. These effects include growth of the penis and the testes, accelerated growth, development of pubic hair, and other androgenic hair of face, torso, and limbs, deepening of the voice, increased musculature, thickening of the jaw, prominence of the neck cartilage, and broadening of the shoulders.

==Abnormal childhood virilization==
Virilization can occur in childhood in both males and females due to excessive amounts of androgens. Typical effects of virilization in children are pubic hair, accelerated growth and bone maturation, increased muscle strength, acne, and adult body odor. In males, virilization may signal precocious puberty, while congenital adrenal hyperplasia and androgen producing tumors (usually) of the gonads or adrenals are occasional causes in both sexes.

==In adolescent or adult females==
Virilization in females can manifest as clitoral enlargement, increased muscle strength, acne, hirsutism, frontal hair thinning, deepening of the voice, menstrual disruption due to anovulation, and a strengthened libido. Some of the possible causes of virilization in females are:
* Androgen-producing tumors of the
** ovaries
** adrenal glands (see adrenal tumor)
** pituitary gland (see pituitary adenoma)
* Hyperthecosis
* Hypothyroidism
* Anabolic steroid exposure
* Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (late-onset)
* Conn&#x27;s syndrome

== Medically induced virilization in transgender people ==
Transgender people who were medically assigned female at birth sometimes elect to take hormone replacement therapy. This process causes virilization by inducing many of the effects of a typically male puberty. Many of these effects are permanent, but some effects can be reversed if the transgender individual stops or pauses their medical treatment.

=== Permanent virilization effects ===
* Deepening of the voice
* Growth of facial and body hair
* Male-pattern baldness
* Enlargement of the clitoris
* Breast atrophy – possible shrinking and/or softening of breasts

=== Reversible virilization effects ===
* Further muscle development (especially upper body)
* Increased sweat and changes in body odor
* Prominence of veins and coarser skin
* Alterations in blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides)
* Increased red blood cell count

==Demasculinization==
Demasculinization refers to the reversal of virilization. Some but not all aspects of virilization are reversible. Demasculinization occurs naturally with andropause, pathologically with hypogonadism, and artificially or medically with antiandrogens, estrogens, and orchiectomy. It is desired by many transgender women who have undergone the changes of pubertal masculinization. Some virilized traits remain though (such as body hair, a hard jawline and an enlarged larynx), due to the fashion in which virilization affects a body&#x27;s physiology.

<text>Binary chemical weapons or munitions are chemical weapons which contain the toxic agent in its active state as chemical precursors that are significantly less toxic than the agent. This improves the safety of storing, transporting, and disposing of the weapon. Commonly, firing the munition removes a barrier between two precursors. These react to form the intended agent which is then aerosolized and distributed by a bursting charge.

Binary chemical weapons are chemical weapons within the scope of the Chemical Weapons Convention and therefore their production, use and stockpiling is forbidden in most countries, as at least one of the individual chemicals is likely to be a Schedule 1 chemical for which large scale production is forbidden.

==Examples==
One example of a binary chemical weapon is the United States Army M687. In the M687, methylphosphonyl difluoride (military name: DF, a Schedule 1 chemical) and a mixture of two agents are held in chambers within the munition, separated by a partition. When the weapon is fired, acceleration causes the partition to break, and the precursors are mixed by the rotation of the munition in flight, producing sarin nerve agent.

The Soviet Union and later Russian Federation experimented with binary munitions capable of mixing and distributing two agents that would work together in worsening the weapon&#x27;s effects, an example of which would be the combination of nerve agents with blister agents.

The director of a non-proliferation research program of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey has stated that the assassination of Kim Jong-nam due to poisoning with VX was likely carried out with a binary version of the agent, since VX fumes would otherwise have killed the suspected attackers.

==In popular culture==
* A miniature binary weapon is used in an assassination in the Frederick Forsyth novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Alternative&quot;. It consists of two half-capsules, a non-resistant one containing potassium cyanide and an acid-resistant one containing hydrochloric acid. The substances mix after the halves are assembled and the seal between them is broken, and form hydrogen cyanide. The surplus acid eats through the capsule walls of the non-resistant half, and after a delay of several hours, the lethal content is released into the intestinal tract of whoever ingested it. While technically possible, the assassination tool as discussed in the novel is presumably fictional. However, there are claims that in September 2003, the SVR (Russian Foreign Intelligence Service) prepared to assassinate Boris Berezovsky with a similar device.
* In the 10th and 11th episodes of the 6th season of TV-series &quot;Dexter&quot; are shown preparation and application of binary weapon consisting of two containers filled with DF and isopropyl alcohol. When mixed, the two substances form sarin.
* The 2002 movie &quot;xXx&quot; features a Soviet-made binary chemical weapon codenamed &quot;Silent Night&quot;, after its supposed ability to render an area silent by killing its inhabitants. In the movie, the chemical was acquired by the terrorist group Anarchy-99, and their leader, Yorgi, plans to launch missiles containing Silent Night from an autonomous solar-powered submarine called Ahab, with the intent to sow chaos among civilized nations as they all blame each other for the attacks.
* Michael Crichton&#x27;s 1972 novel &quot;Binary&quot; uses a binary nerve agent &quot;VZ&quot; as the main plot device intended to kill the President of the United States, and indirectly most of the inhabitants of San Diego.
