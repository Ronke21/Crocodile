<text>Nickerie is a district of Suriname, on the north-west coast. Nickerie&#x27;s capital city is Nieuw-Nickerie. Another town is Wageningen. The district borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the Surinamese district of Coronie to the east, the Surinamese district of Sipaliwini to the south and the region of East Berbice-Corentyne in Guyana to the west.

Nickerie has a population of 36.639 (2004) and an area of 5,353 km2. Nickerie&#x27;s population includes East Indian, Javanese, Afro-Surinamese, Chinese, and Europeans.

Nickerie is bordered with Guyana. There is no bridge between the countries, but there is a ferry that sails between Molson Creek in Guyana and South Drain.

==History==
Nickerie District was originally settled by Amerindians. Near the Wonotobo Falls, a settlement was discovered which dates from the 1st century BC. Between the 6th and 16th century some &quot;terpen&quot; (artificial mounts) were built in the coastal area of which Hertenrits is the best known. In 1613, a tobacco plantation was established on the Courantyne River, however it disappeared without a trace.

In 1718, Dietzel became the first person to successfully settle in the area. In 1797, governor Jurriaan François de Friderici approved the first plantation in Nickerie. A large number of Scottish and English settlers arrived in the area during the British Occupation, and primarily grew cotton and coffee. The capital Nieuw Nickerie was built in 1879 after the former center of the district, Nieuw Rotterdam, was destroyed by floods.

The name Nickerie is probably based on &quot;Neekeari&quot; which was first reported by Teenstra in 1596 for an indigenous tribe living the area. The name also appears in Robert Dudley&#x27;s &quot;The Voyage of Robert Dudley to the West-Indies, 1594-1595&quot;.

Nickerie had a poor connection to Paramaribo. It was not until 1960s when the East-West Link was constructed linking Nickerie with the rest of the country.

==Agriculture==

During the 19th century, Nickerie became home to many plantation. The abolition of slavery, transformed the area in smaller scale farming. In the late 19 century, many plantations start to shift to balatá production whose latex was used for driving belts and isolation, but started to become obsolete in the early 20th century. In 1955, a project of poldering started, resulting in an increase of cultivatable land.

Bananas and rice are the main crops grown in Nickerie. Some rice had been grown previously, but during the 20th century, Nickerie became the centre of the rice in Suriname, mainly due to the East Indian and Javanese indentured laborers.

==Tourism==
Nieuw Nickerie is starting to develop as a tourist area. There are numerous hotels in the city, and the nearby Bigi Pan Nature Reserve opened opportunities for ecotourism. In 1972, the Hertenrits Nature Reserve was founded. In the reserve there are five &quot;terpen&quot; (artificial mounts). They were located in the middle of the swamp, and remains from the pre-Columbian era had been discovered in the mounts. Hertenrits has been incorporated into the Bigi Pan reserve.

<text>Amelia Ann Blanford Edwards (7 June 1831 – 15 April 1892), also known as Amelia B. Edwards, was an English novelist, journalist, traveller and Egyptologist. Her literary successes included the ghost story &quot;The Phantom Coach&quot; (1864), the novels &quot;Barbara&#x27;s History&quot; (1864) and &quot;Lord Brackenbury&quot; (1880), and the travelogue of Egypt &quot;A Thousand Miles up the Nile&quot; (1877). She also edited a poetry anthology published in 1878. 

In 1882, she co-founded the Egypt Exploration Fund. She gained the nickname &quot;Godmother of Egyptology&quot; for her contribution.

==Early life==
Born on 7 June 1831 in Islington, London, to an Irish mother and a father who had been a British Army officer before becoming a banker, Edwards was educated at home by her mother and showed early promise as a writer. She published her first poem at the age of seven and her first story at the age of twelve. Thereafter came a variety of poetry, stories and articles in several periodicals, including &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Journal&quot;, &quot;Household Words&quot; and &quot;All the Year Round&quot;. She also wrote for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; and the &quot;Morning Post&quot;.

In addition, Edwards became an artist. She would illustrate some of her own writings and also paint scenes from other books she had read. She was talented enough at the age of 12 to catch the eye of George Cruikshank, who went so far as to offer to teach her, but this talent of hers was not supported by Edwards&#x27;s parents, who saw art as a lesser profession and the artist&#x27;s way of life as scandalous. Their negative decision haunted Edwards through her early life. She would wonder frequently whether art would not have been her true calling.

Thirdly, Edwards took up composing and performing music for some years, until she suffered a bout of typhus in 1849 that was followed by a frequently sore throat. This made it hard for her to sing, causing her to lose interest in music and even regret the time she had spent on opera. Other interests she pursued included pistol shooting, riding and mathematics.

==Fiction==
Early in the 1850s, Edwards began to focus more exclusively on being a writer. Her first full-length novel was &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1855). Her early novels were well received, but it was &quot;Barbara&#x27;s History&quot; (1864), a novel involving bigamy, that established her reputation. She spent much time and effort on the settings and backgrounds of her books, estimating that it took her about two years to complete the research and writing of each. This paid off when her last novel, &quot;Lord Brackenbury&quot; (1880), went into several editions.

Edwards wrote several ghost stories, including &quot;The Phantom Coach&quot; (1864), which frequently appears in anthologies. The background and characters in many of her writings are influenced by personal experiences. For example, &quot;Barbara&#x27;s History&quot; (1864) uses Suffolk as the background, which she had visited for a few enjoyable summer holidays as a child. 

==Personal life==
In January 1851, Amelia Edwards became engaged to a Mr Bacon (first name unknown), possibly out of consideration for her ageing parents, who may have been worried for their daughter&#x27;s future economic security. There are no signs that point to a love relationship; on the contrary, Edwards does not seem to have felt any particular sympathies for her fiancé. In December 1851, she broke off the engagement.

Amelia Edwards formed emotional attachments almost exclusively with women. From the early 1860s onwards, she lived with Ellen Drew Braysher (1804–1892, see below), a widow 27 years her senior who had lost her husband and daughter not long after Edwards&#x27; parents had died and was to become her companion until both women died in early 1892. Another significant person in Edwards&#x27; life was Ellen Byrne, the wife of a pastor and school inspector, with whom Edwards apparently entered a love relationship during the second half of the 1860s. The relationship ended when the husband, John Rice Byrne, was assigned a different school district and the couple moved away, which left Edwards deeply distraught. 

Edwards&#x27; papers, archived at Somerville College, contain no reference to the intimate quality of this relationship, but a letter from writer and early homosexual activist John Addington Symonds to sexologist Havelock Ellis reveals that Edwards had mentioned it to Symonds after the two had become friends around 1864. According to Symonds, John Rice Byrne was aware of the nature of his wife&#x27;s feelings for Edwards and condoned the relationship. Ellis anonymized this information and used it in his publication &quot;Studies in the Psychology of Sex Vol. 2&quot; as an example of what he termed &quot;sexual inversion&quot;.

Edwards further maintained important, close friendships with painter Marianne North (1830–1890), her travelling companion Lucy Renshaw (1833–1919) and her closest confidante during her later years, Kate Bradbury (later Griffith), who also became executrix of Edwards&#x27; will.

==Dolomites==

Edwards first heard about the Dolomites in 1853, through sketches brought back to England from Italy. On 27 June 1872, she embarked on a trip through the mountains with her friend Lucy Renshaw. That day they left Monte Generoso for Venice, one of the three known ways to enter the Dolomites, but not before parting from Renshaw&#x27;s maid and courtier, who disapproved of such a journey. 

Instead the two women hired mountain guides from the region. On 1 July 1872, after a three-day stay in Venice, Edwards and Renshaw left for Longarone, Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo, Pieve di Cadore, Auronzo di Cadore, Val Buona, Caprile, Agordo, Primiero, Predazzo, Fassa Valley, Passo Fedaia, Sasso Bianco, Forno di Zoldo, Zoppè di Cadore and Caprile, and ended their journey in Bolzano.

At the time of Edwards&#x27;s visit, the Dolomites were described as terra incognita and even educated persons had never heard of them. This journey was described in her book &quot;A Midsummer Ramble in the Dolomites&quot; (1873), later entitled &quot;Untrodden Peaks and Infrequent Valleys&quot;. During the expedition, Edwards also sought works of Titian, finding a Madonna and Child in Serravalle (Vittorio Veneto) and two other paintings at a village church in Cadore.

After her descent from the mountains, Edwards described civilized life as a &quot;dead-level World of Commonplace&quot;. In the summer of 1873, dissatisfied by the end of their journey, Edwards and Renshawe took to a walking tour of France. However, this was interrupted by torrential rains, a factor that influenced them in looking towards Egypt.

==Egypt==

Edwards, again accompanied by Lucy Renshaw, toured Egypt in the winter of 1873–1874, experiencing a fascination with the land and its cultures, ancient and modern. Journeying southwards from Cairo in a hired dahabiyeh (manned houseboat), the two women visited Philae and ultimately reached Abu Simbel, where they remained for six weeks. Another party member was the English painter Andrew McCallum, who discovered a sanctuary that came to bear his name for some time afterwards. Their boat joined a flotilla with another female English traveller, Marianne Brocklehurst, also travelling with a female companion. Brocklehurst and Edwards remained friends and Brocklehurst later supported her Egypt Exploration Fund.

Edwards wrote a successful, self-illustrated description of her Nile voyage entitled &quot;A Thousand Miles up the Nile&quot; (1877). Her travels in Egypt made her aware of increasing threats to ancient monuments from tourism and modern development. She set out to hinder these through public awareness and scientific endeavour, becoming an advocate for research and preservation of them. In 1882, she co-founded the Egypt Exploration Fund with Reginald Stuart Poole, Curator of the Department of Coins and Medals at the British Museum. Edwards became joint Honorary Secretary of the Fund until her death.
To advance the Fund&#x27;s work, Edwards largely abandoned other writing in favour of Egyptology. She contributed to the 9th edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, to the American supplement of that and to the &quot;Standard Dictionary&quot;. In addition, Edwards took on an strenuous lecture tour in the United States in 1889–1890. The lectures later appeared as &quot;Pharaohs, Fellahs and Explorers&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
After catching influenza, Edwards died on 15 April 1892 at Weston-super-Mare, having lived at Westbury-on-Trym, near Bristol, since 1864. She was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, Henbury, Bristol, where her grave is marked by an obelisk with a stone ankh at the foot. Alongside are the graves of her life partner of 30 years, Ellen Drew Braysher (9 April 1804 – 9 January 1892), with whom she had lived in Westbury-on-Trym and of Ellen&#x27;s daughter, Sarah Harriet Braysher (1832–1864). In September 2016, Historic England designated the grave Grade II listed, as a landmark in English LGBT history.

Edwards bequeathed her collection of Egyptian antiquities and her library to University College London, with a sum of £2,500 to found an Edwards Chair of Egyptology which had a huge influence on developing egyptology as a discipline. Her dedication to this science earned her the nickname of &quot;the Godmother of Egyptology&quot;. Edwards also supported Somerville College Library, having left many books, papers and watercolours to Somerville College, Oxford, along with a small collection of Greek and Roman pots.

==In popular culture==
*In 2012, Edwards was portrayed as a non-singing character in Stephen Medcalf&#x27;s production of &quot;Aida&quot; at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall. The opera opens with a Victorian &quot;dig&quot; among Egyptian tombs and the action unfolds as Edwards imagines the plot taking place based on her exploration of the site. The libretto was based on a scenario by the Egyptologist Auguste Mariette, a contemporary of Edwards. 
*The Egyptologist and novelist Elizabeth Peters (Barbara Mertz) named her character Amelia Peabody after Amelia Edwards.
*In 2014, a new music ensemble, Alarm Will Sound, staged a music-theatre piece, &quot;I Was Here I Was I&quot;, based on Amelia Edwards&#x27;s &quot;A Thousand Miles Up the Nile&quot;, at the Temple of Dendur in the Metropolitan Museum of Arts&#x27; Sackler Wing. It was written and directed by Nigel Maister to music by Kate Soper.
*A one-woman show based on Edwards&#x27;s life, &quot;Hers Was the Earth&quot;, by Kim Hicks, was performed at the Petrie Museum during the 2011 International Women&#x27;s Day observances.
*Edwards&#x27; short story &quot;Was It an Illusion?&quot; (1881), about a Schools Inspector who has an unsettling encounter on his visit to the north of England, features in Audible&#x27;s 2017 Ghostly Tales anthology, narrated by Simon Callow.

<text>Karelian pasties, Karelian pies or Karelian pirogs (, singular ; Olonets Karelian: ; , singular ; or ) are traditional Finnish pasties or pirogs originating from the region of Karelia. They are eaten throughout Finland as well as in adjacent areas such as Estonia and Russian Karelia.

The oldest traditional pasties usually had a rye crust, but the North Karelian and Ladoga Karelian variants also contained wheat to improve the quality of the crust. The usual fillings were barley and . In the 19th century, first potato, and then buckwheat were introduced as fillings, and later, boiled rice and millet.

Today, the most popular version has a thin rye crust with a filling of rice. Mashed potato and rice-and-carrot fillings are also commonly available. Butter, often mixed with chopped-up boiled egg (egg butter or ), is spread over the hot pasties before eating.

Karelian pasties have had traditional speciality guaranteed (TSG) status in Europe since 2003. This means that any producer not following the traditional recipe cannot call them and instead, will have to call them &#x27;rice pasties&#x27;, &#x27;potato pasties&#x27;, etc., depending on the filling.

<text>Amido black 10B is an amino acid staining azo dye used in biochemical research to stain for total protein on transferred membrane blots, such as the western blot. It is also used in criminal investigations to detect blood present with latent fingerprints - it stains the proteins in blood a blue-black color. Amido Black can be either methanol or water based as it readily dissolves in both. With picric acid, in a van Gieson procedure, it can be used to stain collagen and reticulin.

<text>Para is a district of northern Suriname. Para&#x27;s capital city is Onverwacht, with other towns including Paranam, and Zanderij. Para has a population of 24,700 and an area of 5,393 km2. The district is the mining and forestry centre of Suriname, with many large bauxite mining operations operating. The district is a mixture of forest and savannas.

==History==
The northern part of Para is one of the oldest cultivated areas of Suriname, and has been home to sugar and tobacco plantation since the 17th century which were mainly located along the Suriname River and the Para Creek. The southern part of the district contained wood plantations, and is still in use by logging companies. In 1968, the District was established, and named after the Para Creek. In 1983, the District was quadrupled in size.

The district used to be accessible only by boat. The discovery of gold in Brokopondo and Sipaliwini lead to the construction of the Lawa Railway and growth of the villages next to the railway line. The railway line was decommissioned in 1986.

During World War II American troops were stationed in Suriname. The existing airport at Zorg en Hoop was insufficient, and the airstrip at Zanderij, was upgraded to a major airport. In 1936, a road, currently named Indira Gandhiweg, had been built parallel to the railway line to connect Paramaribo with Onverwacht, which was extended to the airport. In the 1960s, the Avobakaweg was constructed to provide access to the south of the country.

The ruins of the city of Jodensavanne are in Para district. Jews fleeing the Spanish Inquisition established Jodensavanne in the 17th century, but it was destroyed in 1832 by a fire. Jodensavanne was an internment camp for suspected Nazi supporters from the Dutch East Indies during the Second World War.

Para is home to several indigenous villages from the Carib and Arawak tribes.

==Economy==
The main part of the economy is the bauxite mining. Gold also plays a major role in the economy of Para. The main roads and airport have resulted in companies moving into Para. Agriculture is mainly focused on cassava, asparagus bean and pineapples. Tourism has seen a steady growth over the 20th and 21st centuries. There are several holiday resorts in the district, and &quot;White Beach&quot; in Oost is becoming a main attraction.

==Resorts==
Para is divided into 5 resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
* Bigi Poika
* Carolina
* Noord
* Oost
* Zuid

== Villages ==

* Berlijn
* Bernharddorp
* Bethesda
* Cabendadorp
* Cassipora

* Onverwacht
* Paranam
* Pikin Saron
* Powakka
* Redi Doti
* Republiek
* Sabakoe

==Demographics==
In the 2004 census, Para had 18,749 inhabitants. This rose in the 2012 census to 24,700 inhabitants, a 31.1% increase.

<doc id="684352" wikidata="Q1028439" url="?curid=684352" title="Yellow-crowned gonolek">
<text>The yellow-crowned gonolek (Laniarius barbarus), also known as the common gonolek, is a medium-sized passerine bird in the bushshrike family. It is a common resident breeding bird in equatorial Africa from Senegal and Democratic Republic of Congo east to Ethiopia. It is a skulking bird and frequents dense undergrowth in forests and other wooded habitats. The nest is a cup structure in a bush or tree in which two eggs are laid.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the yellow-crowned gonolek in his &quot;Ornithologie&quot; based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name &quot;La pie-griesche rouge du Sénégal&quot; and the Latin &quot;Lanius Senegalensis ruber&quot;. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the yellow-crowned gonolek. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Lanius barbarus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Laniarius&quot; that was introduced by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot in 1816. Two subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The yellow-crowned gonolek is long with a long tail and short wings. The adult is a vividly-coloured bird, although easily overlooked as it lurks in undergrowth. It has solidly black upper parts apart from its golden crown, and scarlet underparts other than a buff-yellow undertail. The legs are dark. Sexes are similar, but juveniles are paler and duller.

==Ecology==
This species is seldom seen because it inhabits thick undergrowth from which its calls can be heard. These include whistles and rattles, often sung in duet, with a fluted &quot;too-lioo&quot; overlapped by a rattling &quot;ch-chacha&quot;. The yellow-crowned gonolek feeds mainly on insects located in bushes or on the ground. The diet consists mostly of beetles and caterpillars, but birds eggs and nestlings are sometimes taken.

It is monogamous and territorial. Some courtship behaviours have been observed with a pair chasing each other through a bush, leaping from branch to branch and emitting metallic twanging sounds. The deep cup-shaped nest is often flimsy and is built in a bush, from rootlets and tendrils. Two, or occasionally three, greyish-green or bluish-green eggs with dark spots are laid.

<text>Lewis William Killcross Booth CBE (born 7 November 1948) is a British accountant and business executive. He is currently on the board of directors for Rolls-Royce, for Mondelez International, Inc, and Gentherm Inc. He previously had a 34-year career at Ford Motor Company where he rose to the rank of Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, responsible for Ford&#x27;s financial operations, including the Controller&#x27;s Office, Treasury and Investor Relations, a position he held from November 2008 until April 2012.

Booth was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2012 Birthday Honours for services to the UK automotive and manufacturing industries.

==Early life and education==
Born in Liverpool, United Kingdom, the son of a Ford, Austin and Morris dealer, Booth has always had a passion for cars and the automotive industry.

Graduating in 1970 from the University of Liverpool with a bachelor of engineering degree with honours in mechanical engineering, he subsequently qualified as a chartered management accountant.
He started his career at British Leyland before joining Ford in 1978 as a financial analyst in Product Development for Ford of Europe.

==Career==

===Ford of Europe===
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Booth held a series of management positions in Ford of Europe in Britain and in Germany in Finance Staff, Truck Operations, Product Development, Manufacturing, and Sales.

===Ford North America===
In 1992, he moved to the United States where he worked for Finance Staff in Dearborn. From 1993 to 1996, Booth held a variety of positions in Car Product Development, Body &amp; Assembly, Vehicle Operations and the Manufacturing Business Office for Ford Automotive Operations before accepting the position of Group managing director at SAMCOR in South Africa.

===International Assignments===
From August 1997 to January 2000, Booth served as Group managing director of the South Africa Motor Corporation. At that time, Ford had 45% equity in SAMCOR, which assembled Ford and Mazda vehicles in South Africa. Subsequently, the SAMCOR joint venture was dissolved and Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa was established.

Booth was promoted President, Asia Pacific and Africa Operations for Ford Motor Company, a position he held from 1 January 2000. In this role, he had operational responsibility for South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and India and for developing Ford&#x27;s strategy in the Asia-Pacific region.

===Mazda===
Between 2002 and 2003, Booth succeeded Mark Fields as president and then chairman of Mazda Motor Corporation based in Hiroshima, Japan, where he oversaw the implementation of the company&#x27;s highly successful Millennium Plan and the return of the rotary engine in the RX-8. He is widely credited for leading the turnaround and renaissance of Mazda.

===Ford of Europe and Premier Automotive Group===
Following his stint at Mazda, Booth returned to Ford of Europe in Cologne succeeding Martin Leach as President and COO from September 2003 to April 2004. In April 2004, he was promoted to group vice-president Ford Motor Company and chairman and CEO, Ford of Europe. In October 2005, he replaced Mark Fields as Executive Vice-President Ford of Europe and Premier Automotive Group, responsible for Ford of Europe, Aston Martin, Jaguar, Land Rover, and Volvo, and divided his time between Cologne and Ford&#x27;s Ingeni building in Soho, London. It was in this role he oversaw the sale of Aston Martin to Kuwaiti investors in March 2007 and Jaguar Land Rover to Tata Motors in June 2008. As Ford implemented its One Ford plan and divested itself of its luxury brands that made up Premier Automotive Group, his job title and responsibilities changed to reflect this as he became Executive Vice-President for Ford Motor Company responsible for Ford of Europe, Volvo Car Corporation and Ford Export Operations &amp; Global Growth Initiatives. He was also chairman of both Ford of Europe and Volvo Car Corporation.

===Ford Chief Financial Officer &amp; EVP===
In November 2008, then-Ford CEO Alan Mulally, moved him to his final role at Ford Motor Company, becoming Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer once again based in Dearborn. In this role, he engineered Ford&#x27;s largest ever debt restructuring in 2009, led the sale of Volvo to Geely in 2010, and paid Ford&#x27;s first dividend in 5 years in March 2012. He retired from Ford in April 2012.

<text>Paramaribo is a district of Suriname, coextensive with the capital city of Paramaribo.

Paramaribo district has a population of 240,924, almost half the population of the entire country, and an area of 182 km2.

The area was first colonised by the British in the 17th century with the construction of Fort Willoughby. This fort was later taken by the Netherlands and renamed Fort Zeelandia. The area, and the city of Paramaribo, switched between Dutch and British control until the Treaty of Breda at the end of the Second Anglo-Dutch War ceded all of Suriname to the Dutch.

== Resorts ==

Paramaribo is divided into 12 resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
* Beekhuizen
* Blauwgrond
* Centrum
* Flora
* Latour
* Livorno
* Munder

<text>David Roe (born 11 September 1965) is a former English professional snooker player, and a four-time ranking tournament quarter-finalist.

==Career==
Roe was born on 11 September 1965 in Derby. He began his professional career for the 1986–87 snooker season after qualifying through the pro-ticket series. In his second professional season he reached the last 32 or better in four tournaments, and a year later he reached the last 16 of the 1989 World Snooker Championship on his debut in the main event, to reach the top 32 of the rankings. He then had two poorer seasons, before two quarter-finals in 1991/1992. A year later he reached the top 16, despite not reaching a quarter-final in that season.

Roe spent three successive seasons in the Top 16 and reached a highest position of 13th in 1994/1995 (up from, and back down to, no. 16 in 1993/1994 and 1995/1996 respectively). Roe fell out of the top 32 after a succession of early defeats, and never regained this status.

A run to the last 16 of the China Open was the best finish of Roe&#x27;s 2005–06 season. He had to win three qualifying matches to secure his position at the Beijing event, where he defeated Li Yin Xi (a wild card) and Paul Hunter, before ultimately losing 5–3 to Joe Swail. In 2006/2007 his best were two last-32 runs, and another followed at the 2008 Welsh Open. He won just two matches in the 2008/2009 season, causing him to drop to 62nd in the rankings.

Roe dropped off the tour at the end of the 2009/2010 season, after 24 years as a professional. He moved to Iran, where he coached their national team, and converted to Islam. He later became a snooker coach at the Hong Kong Sports Institute, working with women&#x27;s world champion Ng On-yee.

<doc id="684389" wikidata="Q1889748" url="?curid=684389" title="Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty">
<text>The Treaty Between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Strategic Offensive Reductions (SORT), also known as the Treaty of Moscow, was a strategic arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia that was in force from June 2003 until February 2011 when it was superseded by the New START treaty. 

At the time, SORT was positioned as &quot;represent[ing] an important element of the new strategic relationship&quot; between the two countries with both parties agreeing to limit their nuclear arsenal to between 1,700 and 2,200 operationally deployed warheads each. It was signed in Moscow on 24 May 2002. 

After ratification by the U.S. Senate and the State Duma, SORT came into force on 1 June 2003. It would have expired on 31 December 2012 if not superseded by New START. Either party could have withdrawn from the treaty upon giving three months written notice to the other.

==Mutual nuclear disarmament==
SORT was one in a long line of treaties and negotiations on mutual nuclear disarmament between Russia (and its predecessor, the Soviet Union) and the United States, which includes SALT I (1969–1972), the ABM Treaty (1972), SALT II (1972–1979), the INF Treaty (1987), START I (1991), START II (1993) and New START (2010).

The Moscow Treaty was different from START in that it limited operationally deployed warheads, whereas START I limited warheads through declared attribution to their means of delivery (ICBMs, SLBMs, and Heavy Bombers).

Russian and U.S. delegations met twice a year to discuss the implementation of the Moscow Treaty at the Bilateral Implementation Commission (BIC).

==Ratification==

The treaty was submitted for ratification in December 2002. However, the passage of the agreement took about a year because the bill had to be resubmitted after its rejection in committee due to concerns about funding for nuclear forces and about cutting systems that had not yet reached the end of their service lives. Further, the deputies were concerned about the U.S.&#x27;s ability to upload reserve nuclear warheads for a first strike (upload potential).

The ratification was also problematic because the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the Duma, Dmitry Rogozin, disagreed with his Federation Council counterpart Margelov. Deputy Rogozin argued that the Moscow Treaty should be delayed because of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. In the end, however, this delay never happened. The final vote was similar to START II with nearly a third of the deputies voting against. The ratification resolution mandated presidential reporting on nuclear force developments and noted that key legislators should be included in interagency planning.

==Implementation==
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory reported that President Bush directed the US military to cut its stockpile of both deployed and reserve nuclear weapons in half by 2012. The goal was achieved in 2007, a reduction of US nuclear warheads to just over 50 percent of the 2001 total. A further proposal by Bush would have brought the total down another 15 percent.

==Criticism==
While President Bush said the treaty &quot;liquidates the Cold War legacy of nuclear hostility&quot; and his security advisor Condoleezza Rice said it should be considered &quot;the last treaty of the last century,&quot; others criticized the treaty for various reasons:
* There were no verification provisions to give confidence, to either the signatories or other parties, that the stated reductions have in fact taken place.
* The arsenal reductions were not required to be permanent; warheads are not required to be destroyed and may therefore be placed in storage and later redeployed.
* The arsenal reductions were required to be completed by 31 December 2012, which is also the day on which the treaty loses all force unless extended by both parties.
* There was a clause in the treaty which provided that withdrawal can occur upon the giving of three months&#x27; notice and since no benchmarks are required in the treaty, either side could feasibly perform no actions in furtherance of the treaty and then withdraw in September 2012.

<text>Warrior (born James Brian Hellwig; June 16, 1959 – April 8, 2014) was an American professional wrestler and bodybuilder. Best known by his ring name The Ultimate Warrior, he wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) from 1987 to 1992, as well as a short stint in 1996. He also notably spent a few months in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1998, in which he was known as The Warrior.

After a career in bodybuilding, Warrior turned to professional wrestling. From 1985 to 1986, he was paired with fellow former bodybuilder Steve Borden, later known as Sting, as the Blade Runners. The two split when Warrior left to pursue a singles career in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). Under the ring name Dingo Warrior, he was a one-time WCWA Texas Heavyweight Champion.

In 1987, he joined the World Wrestling Federation, and became a two-time WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion within two years. In the main event of WrestleMania VI, in 1990, Warrior won the WWF Championship in a title vs. title match over Hulk Hogan, making him the first wrestler to hold both titles concurrently. Posited as the new face of the company, he had a falling out with chairman Vince McMahon over a pay dispute, and unsuccessfully attempted to leave the WWF, with which he was under contract. Warrior returned at WrestleMania VIII, but by November 1992, he had been released; it was later revealed that this was due to steroid use.

In 1993, he legally changed his name to the mononym &quot;Warrior&quot; and was credited as a co-writer for a comic book based on his name and likeness. Warrior returned to the WWF at WrestleMania XII, but lasted four months, as he began no-showing events. Two years later, he joined World Championship Wrestling (which had tried to hire him in 1995), being used in a much-maligned storyline with Hogan, which culminated at Halloween Havoc. Warrior retired from professional wrestling and subsequently embarked on a public speaking career, but wrestled one final match in Spain in 2008.

Warrior died on April 8, 2014, at the age of 54 in Scottsdale, Arizona. On the preceding three nights in New Orleans, he had been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, appeared at WrestleMania XXX, and made his final public appearance on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, returning to the promotion after an acrimonious separation in 1996.

== Early life ==
Warrior was born in 1959 as James Brian Hellwig, in Crawfordsville, Indiana, about 50 miles northwest of Indianapolis. He was the oldest of five children and was raised by his mother (along with, later, his stepfather) after his father left his family when he was 12. His father died at 57 and a grandfather died at 52. The family moved and he graduated from Veedersburg&#x27;s Fountain Central High School and attended Indiana State University for a year.

== Bodybuilding career ==
Prior to his career in professional wrestling Hellwig was an amateur bodybuilder, competing in a number of NPC contests and winning the 1984 NPC Mr. Georgia crown. Hellwig started training with weights when he was 11 years old and described himself as &quot;the small, insecure kid who wasn&#x27;t into any sports&quot;. He moved to California where, after seeing bodybuilder Robby Robinson, he decided to take up the sport. His first contest took place in Florida, where he placed 5th. Later, while he was attending Life University in Marietta, Georgia, he won the Junior Atlanta contest and placed 5th at the 1981 AAU Collegiate Mr. America. In 1983, he won the AAU Coastal USA, before taking the Mr. Georgia title the following year. His last bodybuilding contest was 1985&#x27;s Junior USAs, which was won by future IFBB Pro, Ron Love. Hellwig finished 5th.

In 1985, after spending six weeks in California training for a bodybuilding contest, he was invited to join a group of bodybuilders – Garland Donoho, Mark Miller, and Steve Borden – to form a professional wrestling team. Warrior accepted the invitation and abandoned his bodybuilding career as well as his plans to become a chiropractor.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Continental Wrestling Association (1985–1986) ===
Hellwig began his professional wrestling career as Jim &quot;Justice&quot; Hellwig of Powerteam USA, the group of bodybuilders trained by Red Bastien and Rick Bassman. Hellwig and fellow trainee Steve Borden (who later had success as &quot;Sting&quot;) formed a tag team called The Freedom Fighters (Hellwig was known as Justice and Borden was called Flash).

The Freedom Fighters debuted in the Memphis, Tennessee-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) promotion, run by Jerry Jarrett, in November 1985. The team played babyfaces at first, but fans were actually slow to take to the hulking duo in a territory that had featured sympathetic &quot;good guy tag teams&quot; like the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Express and The Fabulous Ones. They were quickly turned heel under &quot;coach&quot; Buddy Wayne and soon afterwards manager Dutch Mantel. They left the CWA in January 1986.

=== Universal Wrestling Federation (1986) ===

In March 1986, the Freedom Fighters – now known as the Blade Runners – joined the Oklahoma-based Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF). Hellwig was &quot;Blade Runner Rock&quot; and Borden was &quot;Blade Runner Sting&quot;. According to Joseph Laurinaitis (aka Road Warrior Animal), UWF owner Bill Watts created the Blade Runners and the intent was to make them a parody of The Road Warriors. They were part of Eddie Gilbert&#x27;s Hotstuff International group, before disbanding in June 1986 when Hellwig left the UWF.

=== World Class Championship Wrestling (1986–1987) ===
In June 1986, Warrior debuted in the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) promotion, where he wrestled for $50 a night. He has stated that he adopted the ring name &quot;Dingo Warrior&quot; after a member of the WCCW locker room remarked that he looked like &quot;a warrior&quot;. This stood in contrast with a claim made by Road Warrior Animal, who stated that the Dingo Warrior was a recreation of Warrior&#x27;s Blade Runner gimmick and was an attempt to present himself as an offspring of The Road Warriors.

Initially, Warrior was still a heel in the territory, managed by Gary Hart, although he was cheered during a heel versus heel feud with WCWA World Heavyweight Champion Rick Rude after the two fell out during a tag match. After switching managers to Percival Pringle III, Warrior turned babyface permanently after a falling out with fellow Pringle proteges Buzz Sawyer and Matt Borne after a six-man tag match. Warrior formed a tag team with Lance Von Erich, and the duo began competing for the WCWA World Tag Team Championship. On November 17, 1986, Warrior and Von Erich defeated Master Gee (substituting for champion Buzz Sawyer) and Matt Borne to win the title. They held the Championship until December 1 of that year, when they lost to Al Madril and Brian Adias.

In 1987, Warrior began competing for the WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship, losing to Bob Bradley in a tournament final on January 12. He won the title from Bradley on February 2 of that year. The title was held up in April 1987 after Warrior left the WCCW. He was reinstated as champion upon returning, but vacated it once more upon resigning from WCCW to join the World Wrestling Federation, where he adopted the ring name The Ultimate Warrior. Warrior began appearing on house shows in June and was initially billed as The Dingo Warrior in house card promos by Gene Okerlund, but soon had his name modified. There is a dispute over who created the full Ultimate Warrior name. Bruce Prichard stated that Vince McMahon did not know what a &quot;Dingo&quot; Warrior was, but because there was the &quot;Modern Day Warrior&quot; Kerry von Erich and The Road Warriors there should not be one more simple warrior, but the Ultimate Warrior. Warrior claimed after one of his first matches, McMahon had him do a pretaped promo. It was there Vince said &quot;we want you to do Warrior, but we don&#x27;t want Dingo.&quot; The Warrior then proceeded to cut the promo and stated that he was not this warrior or that warrior, he was The Ultimate Warrior. Warrior made his final appearance with WCCW in June 1987.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1987–1992)===
==== Early push (1987–1988) ====

Hellwig joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in June 1987. First competing on house shows under his Dingo Warrior moniker, he defeated a series of jobbers, including Steve Lombardi, Barry Horowitz and Mike Sharpe. He made his television debut as The Ultimate Warrior on the October 25 episode of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, where he defeated another jobber, Terry Gibbs. As The Ultimate Warrior character, Hellwig became known for his impassioned , incomprehensible commentary and high-energy ring entrances, which featured him racing into the arena full speed, bursting into the ring, and violently shaking the ring ropes up and down. He was also known for his distinctive pattern of face paint. After several months of defeating jobbers, he was pinned for the first time in the WWF by fellow WWF rookie/future rival Rick Rude on December 28, 1987. In early 1988, Warrior entered into his first real WWF feud with fellow strongman Hercules Hernandez. The two faced off on the February 7, 1988, airing of &quot;Wrestling Challenge&quot;, where Hercules was disqualified for using his steel chain. Warrior then grabbed ahold of the chain and in the midst of a tug of war over it, the chain snapped. This led to a match at WrestleMania IV, where Warrior was victorious in his pay-per-view debut. Warrior lost twice by pinfall shortly thereafter: cleanly to André the Giant in April in Italy, and to Dino Bravo, who put his feet on the ropes for leverage, in Montreal in June. In the summer of 1988, he wrestled Bobby Heenan in a series of weasel suit matches, in which Warrior won by sleeper hold.

==== Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion (1988–1990) ====

Less than a year after his WWF television debut, Warrior, a surprise substitute for the injured Brutus Beefcake, won the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, defeating The Honky Tonk Man in a 27-second squash match at the inaugural SummerSlam on August 29, 1988, and ending Honky Tonk&#x27;s long reign at 454 days. As champion, he captained a team at Survivor Series &#x27;88, where he was the sole survivor, pinning Outlaw Ron Bass and Greg Valentine in succession to win the match for his team.

As 1989 began, Warrior entered a feud with Rick Rude over the Intercontinental title. The feud was sparked at the 1989 Royal Rumble, where the two met in a &quot;super posedown&quot;. After Warrior drew the support of the live crowd in their judging of the contest, Rude attacked Warrior and choked him with a steel bar. This led to a championship match at WrestleMania V, where Rude pinned Warrior to win the title with the help of his manager Bobby Heenan, who held down Warrior&#x27;s foot from outside the ring as he was being pinned. At SummerSlam, Warrior defeated Rude to regain the title and become a two-time Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. Warrior then began a feud with André the Giant, leading to a number of house shows in which Warrior defeated André in short squash matches, establishing Warrior as a main event level talent. The feud culminated at Survivor Series where the two captained opposing teams. Warrior eliminated André by knocking him out of the ring, where he was counted out. Warrior was again the sole survivor, pinning Arn Anderson and Bobby Heenan to win the match.

==== WWF Champion (1990–1991) ====

The Warrior received a push as WWF&#x27;s main event level successor to Hulk Hogan, who had remained wrestling&#x27;s biggest star throughout the 1980s. Following a few confrontations with Hogan, most notably at the 1990 Royal Rumble, the Warrior was written in as Hogan&#x27;s opponent in the main event for WrestleMania VI at the SkyDome in Toronto. The match was billed as &quot;The Ultimate Challenge&quot;, as both Hogan&#x27;s WWF Championship and Warrior&#x27;s Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship were on the line. Warrior pinned Hogan after a Warrior Splash to become the only wrestler to hold both championships simultaneously. Warrior vacated the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship (which Mr. Perfect then won in a tournament), as WWF rules prohibited a wrestler from holding both titles.

After WrestleMania, Warrior successfully defended the championship against Haku, Mr. Perfect and Ted DiBiase. At SummerSlam, he retained the title over Rick Rude in a steel cage match. &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage was also introduced as a potential rival after interfering in a &quot;The Main Event IV&quot; title match at the behest of DiBiase.

Warrior was inserted into the feud between The Legion of Doom and Demolition, leading to victories for the Warrior and LOD in six-man tag team matches in house shows as well as the October 13, 1990, airing of &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event XXVIII&quot;. The feud culminated at Survivor Series, where The Warriors (Ultimate Warrior, LOD and Kerry Von Erich) defeated The Perfect Team (Mr. Perfect and Demolition). For the third consecutive year, Warrior was the sole survivor for his team. He later survived the &quot;Grand Finale Match of Survival&quot; with Hulk Hogan.
In January 1991, Warrior faced Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble. Slaughter&#x27;s gimmick at the time was a traitor who had betrayed America by aligning himself with an Iraqi (kayfabe) military general, General Adnan. In the context of the Gulf War, this made Slaughter one of the most hated heels at the time. After rejecting an earlier request to grant a title shot to Savage, Sensational Sherri interjected herself in the Warrior&#x27;s championship match to distract him. Her interference eventually led to a Savage sneak attack, where he struck Warrior over the head with a metal scepter and allowed Slaughter to pin Warrior to win the title. Warrior went on to feud with Savage, and the rivalry culminated in a &quot;Career-Ending&quot; match at WrestleMania VII which Warrior won, forcing Savage to retire.

==== Various feuds (1991–1992) ====
The next chapter of Warrior&#x27;s career was an encounter with The Undertaker, after Undertaker and his manager, Paul Bearer, locked Warrior in a coffin on the set of Bearer&#x27;s &quot;Funeral Parlor&quot;. WWF officials worked feverishly to break the casket open, finally revealing Warrior&#x27;s seemingly lifeless body, and the torn fabric inside of the coffin indicating Warrior&#x27;s desperate struggle to get out. Warrior was finally revived by the officials performing CPR. (It was later revealed in a 2010 interview with Bearer that, in preparation for the segment, he and his team had to remove the airtight rubber seal or &quot;gasket&quot; from around the coffin&#x27;s lid and drill air holes in said lid to allow for breathable space, so that Warrior would not suffocate because &quot;he had enough brain damage as it was, and we wouldn&#x27;t want to give him any more&quot;, implying that Warrior had been faking his own death the whole time.) This led to Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts offering to give Warrior &quot;the knowledge of the dark side&quot; in order to prepare Warrior to take his revenge on the Undertaker. This involved Roberts giving Warrior three &quot;tests&quot; shown on WWF television in consecutive weeks. For the first test, Roberts locked Warrior once again inside the same coffin as previously.

For the second test, Warrior was &quot;buried alive&quot; by Roberts. For the third test, the Warrior entered a room full of snakes, to find &quot;the answer&quot; in a chest in the middle of the room. Waiting inside the chest was a spitting cobra which bit Warrior in the face. As Warrior, weakened from the effects of the cobra&#x27;s strike, Roberts made a heel turn and was joined by the Undertaker and Paul Bearer, revealing the three were working together all along. Roberts then uttered, &quot;Never trust a snake.&quot; The stage was now set for a feud between the Warrior and Roberts. The feud never took place, as Warrior was involved in an alleged pay dispute with WWF owner Vince McMahon over the SummerSlam main event, where Warrior was teamed with Hulk Hogan in a handicap match against Sgt. Slaughter, Colonel Mustafa, and General Adnan.

On July 10, 1991, Warrior sent a letter to McMahon requesting inclusions in his new WWF contract. He wanted $550,000 for performing at WrestleMania VII, a guaranteed number of working days, travel accommodations and a higher percentage of merchandise sales. He remarked that $550,000 &quot;was fair&quot;, and that meant as much or more to the show than Hulk [Hogan]&quot;. He ended his letter with &quot;Whatever your decision, I can and will live with it. Till then I remain home with one who cares&quot;.

The WWF responded on July 13, agreeing to $550,000 for WrestleMania VII, a higher royalty rate and promising no other WWF performer would be paid more than him on WWF pay per views. McMahon personally ended the letter by saying, &quot;I would like to express my deepest appreciation and admiration for you as a performer, as a member of the WWF family, as a man, and as my friend&quot;.

Following WWF&#x27;s annual SummerSlam event, Warrior was handed a letter dated August 26, 1991, from McMahon, saying Warrior was suspended effective immediately. Among other things, McMahon said, &quot;You threatened to stay at home thereby not even appearing at Titan&#x27;s major summer pay-per-view event SummerSlam. I had no choice but to accede to your exorbitant demands. This was a serious mistake on your part&quot;. McMahon later testified that the only reason the company agreed to the contract was to &quot;acquiesce to his demands temporarily&quot; to ensure Warrior would perform at the SummerSlam event.

Upon receiving the letter, Warrior refused the suspension and left the WWF. Warrior formally sent a letter of resignation to the WWF in October 1991. The WWF refused to accept the letter since Warrior was under contract until September 1992.

With Hulk Hogan about to leave WWF between mid-1992 and early-1993, McMahon contacted Warrior about returning. He made his comeback at WrestleMania VIII (to rescue Hulk Hogan from a beat down at the hands of Sid Justice and Papa Shango). Upon his return, he received a degree of creative control over his bookings. One storyline involved Papa Shango, a &quot;witch doctor&quot;, casting a spell over Warrior, causing him to convulse and vomit in very odd colors, though Warrior says he hated that story and had no control over it. The Warrior was booked for a WWF Championship match against then-champion, &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage at SummerSlam in August 1992. The Warrior won the match by count-out, but not the title. In November 1992, Warrior was scheduled to team with Savage (as The Ultimate Maniacs) to face Ric Flair and Razor Ramon at Survivor Series. Weeks before the event, Warrior was released for disputed reasons and replaced by Mr. Perfect.

The initial plan for Warrior&#x27;s 1992 return was to eventually give him another run with the WWF Championship. Indeed, WWF writers had originally intended that the Ultimate Warrior should be the one to accept Mr Perfect&#x27;s services - up for offer to either Summerslam main event competitor - turning heel in the process of winning the title. However these plans were scrapped at a late stage due to the Warrior&#x27;s refusal to turn heel after considering the collapse in merchandise sales which would have resulted. Furthermore, his return coincided with the government&#x27;s crackdown on steroids in wrestling. Warrior was admittedly a heavy user of steroids during his professional wrestling career. In his book &quot;Sex, Lies and Headlocks&quot;, ESPN writer Shaun Assael stated that Canadian chemist Mauro Di Pasquale, who had been hired in June to monitor the WWF&#x27;s new drug testing program and was known for being tough towards anyone who failed a drug test, nailed Warrior for steroid use in September and was able to successfully persuade McMahon, who was under federal scrutiny at the time for allegations of illegally supplying steroids to some of his wrestlers, to release Warrior from the company. However, in &quot;Warrior: The Ultimate Legend&quot;, McMahon claims that it was Warrior&#x27;s experimenting with growth hormone which led to his departure; Warrior was suspended and, in return, skipped dates as he took offense to McMahon&#x27;s actions. Warrior left the company on November 21, 1992, with his last match being a victory over Kamala on November 8 in Orlando, Florida.

=== Semi-retirement (1992–1996) ===
Between November 1992 and July 1995, Warrior was semi-retired. During his time away from the WWF, Warrior opened the short-lived &quot;Warrior University&quot;, a professional wrestling school based in Scottsdale, Arizona.

In January 1993 he wrestled as the Dingo Warrior, defeating Hercules Hernandez in Billerica, Massachusetts, for Killer Kowalski&#x27;s International Wrestling Federation.

In April 1993, he toured Europe for World Wrestlings Superstars in Germany and that same year he also played the role of &quot;The Swordsman&quot; in the action movie &quot;Firepower&quot;.

On July 22, 1995, he returned to the ring for the National Wrestling Conference (NWC) promotion in Las Vegas, defeating The Honky Tonk Man. He had also wrestled a tour of Germany for Otto Wanz&#x27;s Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) promotion where he defeated Ulf Herman.

On February 10, 1996, he defeated Jimmy Garvin in an independent show in Princeton, West Virginia.

=== Return to the World Wrestling Federation (1996) ===
Warrior returned to the WWF on March 31, 1996, defeating Hunter Hearst Helmsley at WrestleMania XII. He made his first appearance on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot; on April 8, where he gave an in-ring interview and credited the &quot;voices&quot; of the &quot;warriors&quot; (his name for members of the WWF audience) for his return; he was then interrupted by Goldust. Warrior challenged for Goldust&#x27;s Intercontinental Championship at In Your House 7; Warrior won the match by countout, but did not win the title. The following night on &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;, Warrior defeated Isaac Yankem, DDS. A rematch with Intercontinental Champion Goldust, on the May 27 episode of the show, ended in a double countout, thus eliminating both men from the tournament and eventually giving Vader a bye into the semi-finals. Warrior defeated Jerry Lawler at King of the Ring, and defeated Owen Hart by disqualification on the July 8 episode of &quot;Monday Night Raw&quot;.

Warrior was scheduled to team with Shawn Michaels and Ahmed Johnson to face Owen Hart, Davey Boy Smith, and Vader at In Your House 9 later that month, but the WWF terminated Warrior&#x27;s contract when he missed several house shows, taking time off allegedly to grieve the death of his father. WWF owner Vince McMahon claimed that Warrior had not seen his father in ten years and did not care much for him; therefore, he did not take Warrior&#x27;s excuse for missing house shows at face value. Warrior disputes McMahon&#x27;s explanation, claiming that the real reason why he did not show up to those events was a breach of contract by McMahon, in which WWF sold Warrior&#x27;s merchandise without giving him a percentage. He was replaced by Sycho Sid at In Your House 9.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1998) ===
WCW signed Warrior &quot;at great expense&quot; in May 1998. He formed a stable opposing Hollywood Hulk Hogan&#x27;s New World Order (nWo): the &quot;One Warrior Nation&quot; using the initialism oWn as a play on the name nWo. Highlights of the storyline included Warrior kidnapping and &quot;converting&quot; The Disciple and frequent instances of &quot;magic smoke&quot; knocking out all of the nWo members except for Hollywood Hogan and covering Warrior&#x27;s movement through a trapdoor in the ring. The trapdoor was responsible for nearly paralyzing Davey Boy Smith, when he awkwardly fell on it during a match at Fall Brawl 98. Warrior&#x27;s debut promo also unexpectedly lasted over 27 minutes, which was more than 20 minutes over its allotted time and forced Eric Bischoff to do a massive rewrite of &quot;Nitro&quot; on the spot, including re-adding a commercial break that was supposed to take place during the promo.

Warrior only participated in three matches in WCW. The first was the WarGames match at Fall Brawl, where he competed as a member of Team WCW, competing against 8 other wrestlers for a shot at Goldberg&#x27;s WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Halloween Havoc. Diamond Dallas Page won the match by pinning Stevie Ray. On the October 12 edition of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, he teamed with Sting to defeat Hogan and Bret Hart by disqualification. The third was his loss to Hogan at Halloween Havoc, in what is considered by many to be one of the worst wrestling matches ever staged. During the bout, Hogan attempted to &quot;blind&quot; The Warrior using flash paper, but was unable to light it properly, and as a result The Warrior was forced to briefly sell the move despite the flames clearly not touching him in any way. The match came to an end when Horace Hogan hit Warrior in the back with a chair, allowing Hogan to score the pinfall.

WCW claimed that attempts were made to save the storyline though Warrior claimed in interviews and convention appearances that the only reason he was brought back was so Hogan could get a win over Warrior in return for Hogan&#x27;s WrestleMania job. Warrior&#x27;s last appearance in WCW was on the November 9, 1998, episode of &quot;Monday Nitro&quot;, when he came to the rescue of The Disciple who was being attacked by members of The nWo. Warrior retired from wrestling that year.

=== Nu-Wrestling Evolution (2008) ===
After retiring in 1998, Warrior only wrestled a single match on June 25, 2008, against Orlando Jordan in Barcelona, Spain. Warrior won the match and the Nu-Wrestling Evolution World Heavyweight Championship, but immediately vacated the title.

=== WWE Hall of Fame (2013–2014) ===
On February 20, 2013, Warrior confirmed on his official YouTube channel that he would appear at &quot;WrestleCon&quot; on April 7, 2013. In the same clip he spoke positively about Vince McMahon for the first time on his channel. His appearance was so popular that a second print run of tickets had to be ordered.

On July 15, 2013, Warrior was featured in a &quot;WWE 2K14&quot; game trailer and revealed he was in the roster as a pre-order bonus.

On April 5, 2014, The Ultimate Warrior was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2014. The next day, Warrior appeared at WrestleMania XXX, and the following night delivered a promo on &quot;Raw&quot;, his first appearance on the show since his final televised WWF match in 1996. During what turned out to be his final public appearance, Warrior gave a speech to the fans and wrestlers past and present as his Ultimate Warrior character.

== Personal life ==
Warrior married Shari Lynn Tyree on October 2, 1982. They remained together for the majority of Warrior&#x27;s WWF career before divorcing on March 22, 1991, two days before WrestleMania VII. Warrior married for the second time to Dana Viale on January 31, 1999. The couple had two daughters together.

Between 1987 and 1989, he appeared in several TV ads for Westway Ford, a car dealership in Irving, Texas. Warrior interacted in full wrestling costume with Westway&#x27;s wacky character, &quot;Mean Joe Greed.&quot;

=== Death rumors ===
Warrior returned to the WWF at WrestleMania VIII after nearly eight months on hiatus since SummerSlam 1991. Due to the drastic change in his appearance (shorter, blonder hair and a smaller physique), rumors began circulating that a new wrestler was playing the role. At the time it was rumored to be Kerry Von Erich, who was then under contract to the WWF. Some said Warrior died from liver failure due to years of steroid abuse or that his signature arm tassels cut off his blood circulation. WWE claims that the theory that a different man returned to play The Ultimate Warrior at WrestleMania VIII remains &quot;perhaps the longest standing urban legend in WWE history&quot;. WWE announcer Tom Phillips claims that the rumors likely originated from Gene Okerlund&#x27;s WCW Hotline as well as the WCW debut of Warrior doppelgänger The Renegade.

=== Trademark and slander litigation ===
In 1993, Hellwig legally changed his name to the mononym Warrior. This one-word name appears on all legal documents pertaining to Warrior, and his children carry the Warrior name as their legal surname.

Warrior and the WWF engaged in a series of lawsuits and legal actions in 1996 and 1998, where both parties sought a declaration that they owned the characters, Warrior and Ultimate Warrior, under both contract and copyright law. The court ruled that Warrior was legally entitled to use the gimmick, costuming, face paint designs, and mannerisms of the &quot;Warrior&quot; character.

On September 27, 2005, WWE released a DVD documentary focusing on Warrior&#x27;s wrestling career, titled &quot;The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior&quot;. The DVD featured clips of his more notable feuds and matches along with commentary from WWE stars past and present (most of which are unflattering), with Triple H (by this point one of WWE&#x27;s top main eventers and the husband of Vince McMahon&#x27;s daughter Stephanie McMahon) adding that his WrestleMania debut loss against Warrior at WrestleMania XII left him with mixed emotions, saying that Warrior &quot;ruined the experience&quot; for him and was &quot;one of the most unprofessional guys&quot; he&#x27;s ever performed with. The DVD has provoked some controversy due to Warrior&#x27;s own allegations of slander by WWE against him. Originally, Warrior was asked to help with the production of the DVD, but as he refused to work with WWE (citing he did not want to be associated with their promotion), there had been some resulting animosity between Warrior and WWE over the Warrior claiming bias on the part of WWE. In January 2006, Warrior filed another lawsuit against WWE in an Arizona court over the depiction of his wrestling career in &quot;The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior&quot; DVD. On September 18, 2009, Warrior&#x27;s lawsuit in Arizona was dismissed.

=== Public speaking ===
Warrior formally retired from wrestling in 1999 and had a short-lived career as a conservative speaker and commentator, partnering with conservative spokesman Daniel Pinheiro, denouncing left-wing politics. In one instance, he mentioned that &quot;queering doesn&#x27;t make the world work&quot; during a speech at the University of Connecticut. Warrior explained those comments on his website as meaning that the human race would die out if everyone were a homosexual.

In 1996, Warrior published a comic book titled &quot;Warrior&quot;, featuring himself as the main character. The series was co-written with Jim Callahan and illustrated by the Sharp Brothers.

Warrior maintained a blog on his personal website titled &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Machete&quot;, where he discussed his personal life, his personal views on politics, sexuality, patriotism, and his legacy as a wrestler, amongst other topics. There were numerous instances where Warrior used his blog to address his viewpoint on members of his wrestling past (Vince McMahon, Road Warrior Animal, The British Bulldog, Owen Hart, Hulk Hogan, Lex Luger); historical (Martin Luther King Jr., George Washington) or religious figures (Jesus). Warrior depicted celebrities who were newsworthy at the time of his blog (Heath Ledger and Paris Hilton).
Warrior occasionally referenced his respect for the Founding Fathers of the United States, and also enjoyed books like Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; and James Allen&#x27;s &quot;As a Man Thinketh&quot;. In 2012, he started selling &quot;Weapons of Wisdom&quot;, inspirational 6×9 pieces of watercolor paper with drawings, quotes, and doodles on them by the Warrior himself. He also used the blog to post replies to letters from fans.

== Death ==

Warrior died on April 8, 2014, in Scottsdale, Arizona. He had been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, and made his first &quot;Raw&quot; appearance in almost 18 years on April 7, the day before his death. According to reports, Warrior clutched his chest and collapsed at 5:50 p.m. while walking to his car with his wife outside of their hotel in Arizona. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead at age 54. Warrior&#x27;s colleagues said Warrior appeared frail during WrestleMania weekend, and said that he was sweating profusely and breathing heavily backstage.

An autopsy revealed Warrior died of a heart attack caused by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

== Legacy ==

Although Warrior&#x27;s relationship with WWE was strained at times, more recently WWE has recognized him as one of the company&#x27;s most popular legends. WWE described him as being &quot;As devastating and intense as any Superstar who stepped through the ropes...&quot;, further saying that &quot;The Ultimate Warrior may be the most enigmatic man to ever hold the WWE Championship.&quot; In 2011, WWE called him &quot;one of the most recognizable&quot; wrestlers in WWE history, praising his ability to draw power from &quot;the WWE Universe&quot;, and further spoke of his impact as having &quot;brought Hulkamania to its knees&quot; at WrestleMania VI, &quot;retired the Madness at WrestleMania VII and press slammed a slew of the greatest legends of his era&quot;.

Warrior appeared in the Mattel Legends figures line in both Series 4 and Series 6. He was also chosen as one of six legends to be included in the Defining Moments series of action figures. Most recently he was one of a number of figures in the WWE Superstars line of Mattel action figures in an assortment called &quot;World Champions&quot;. Warrior further appears as a playable character in &quot;WWE All Stars&quot;, &quot;WWE Legends of WrestleMania&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K14&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K15&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K16&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K17&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K18&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K19&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K20&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K22&quot;, &quot;WWE 2K23&quot;, and &quot;WWE 2K24&quot;. In &quot;WWE All Stars&quot;, in which Ultimate Warrior appears as one of the &quot;Legends&quot;, WWE stated that he was the &quot;ultimate archetype of strength and intensity&quot;, and further stated that &quot;without question, the Ultimate Warrior has etched his name in the pantheon of WWE greats&quot;. In 2005, WWE released &quot;The Self-Destruction of The Ultimate Warrior&quot; DVD, which portrayed Warrior in a negative light. Warrior claimed that if WWE wanted to induct him into the WWE Hall of Fame they would have &quot;to tell the right story&quot; opposite of the one depicted in the 2005 DVD. WWE released &quot;Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection&quot;, a 3-DVD, 540 minute-compilation of matches and stories, which portrayed Warrior far more positively, on April 1, 2014. Warrior was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, 2014, the night before WrestleMania XXX.

Warrior had been largely alienated from his peers in professional wrestling in the decade before his death, and was sometimes described as a bitter man on bad terms with various wrestling figures such as Vince McMahon, Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts. Hogan even questioned Warrior&#x27;s value, saying, &quot;You gave the [WWF Championship] belt to The Ultimate Warrior... and right away the revenue went down.&quot; With Warrior&#x27;s reconciling with the professional wrestling industry just before his death, some of his former adversaries offered their condolences. McMahon stated that &quot;We are all so sad that the Ultimate Warrior has passed away. Our heart is with his wife Dana and his two daughters.&quot; Hogan said, &quot;RIP WARRIOR. only love ... We talked, both forgave each other, we hugged, we shook hands as we told each other I love you, I am so sad, God bless his beautiful family&quot;. Roberts said that he was &quot;Deeply saddened. We just had a great talk &amp; buried a senseless hatchet. Talked working together. RIP Warrior. Taking solace we made peace.&quot; News of his death spread the next day on sites such as Bing, Facebook, and Twitter. It was also mentioned on ABC News, HLN and CNN. Reportedly almost immediately after Warrior&#x27;s death, WWE sent two senior officials to Arizona to assist his widow in handling personal things such as grocery shopping so that she could focus on being with her and Warrior&#x27;s daughters.

WWE paid tribute to Warrior on the April 14 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; with a ten bell salute and a video. The WWE Network aired a lineup dubbed &quot;Warrior Week&quot; in Warrior&#x27;s memory. The lineup included a four-part special. A wrestling themed episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot;, which aired on May 6, was dedicated in Warrior&#x27;s memory. The 2015 film &quot;The Flintstones &amp; WWE: Stone Age SmackDown!&quot;, which stars &quot;The Flintstones&quot; and WWE Superstars and Divas, was dedicated to Warrior&#x27;s memory.

At the &quot;UFC Fight Night 40&quot; weigh-ins, fighter Lorenz Larkin wore an Ultimate Warrior mask, tassels and wristbands as a tribute.

Warrior was awarded a posthumous Slammy Award for Return of the Year in December 2014. A WWE-sponsored biography, entitled &quot;Ultimate Warrior: A Life Lived Forever: The Legend of a WWE Hero&quot;, was released in 2015.

In 2021, Warrior&#x27;s life was chronicled on A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and Viceland&#x27;s &quot;Dark Side of the Ring&quot;.

===Warrior Award; Unleash Your Warrior===
During his April 2014 Hall of Fame speech shortly before his death, Warrior proposed that the &quot;Jimmy Miranda Award&quot; should be created to honour WWE&#x27;s behind-the-scenes employees. Miranda, who died in 2002, was part of the WWE merchandise department for more than 20 years.

In 2015, WWE introduced the Warrior Award for those who have &quot;exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance, and who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of the Ultimate Warrior.&quot; Former WWE ring announcer Justin Roberts expressed disappointment at how WWE used portions of Warrior&#x27;s Hall of Fame speech to promote the award, but left out Warrior&#x27;s intentions of honoring WWE&#x27;s off-screen employees. WWE responded, &quot;It is offensive to suggest that WWE and its executives had anything but altruistic intentions in honouring Connor and his legacy with the Warrior Award&quot;, adding that &quot;moving forward the award will be given annually to acknowledge other unsung heroes among WWE&#x27;s employees and fans.&quot; As of 2019, Sue Aitchison would be the first WWE employee to be given the warrior award.

In 2017, WWE started promoting the &quot;Unleash Your Warrior&quot; breast cancer awareness campaign in partnership with the Susan G. Komen Foundation, where Warrior&#x27;s likeness was promoted on television by WWE wrestlers and breast cancer survivors. WWE has been criticized for using Warrior as the inspirational &quot;emblem&quot; of the campaign. &quot;Pro Wrestling Torch&quot; described Warrior in real-life having made public &quot;vile, bigoted, hateful, judgmental comments about a cancer victim, Hurricane Katrina victims, homosexual people, a woman defending a gay man, and even Martin Luther King Jr.&quot; For example, when Bobby Heenan contracted cancer, Warrior said, &quot;Karma is just a beautiful thing to behold.&quot; &quot;Vice&quot; wrote that &quot;completely whitewashing his past and elevating his likeness to a bland symbol of corporate altruism is shockingly tone-deaf, especially for a company that&#x27;s at least outwardly trying to appear progressive, inclusive and diverse&quot;. In response, WWE said that the Unleash Your Warrior campaign and the Warrior Award &quot;recognize individuals that exhibit the strength and courage of WWE&#x27;s legendary character The Ultimate Warrior. Any attempt to distract from the mission of these initiatives and take the spotlight away from the honorees is unfortunately misguided.&quot;

<text>Mâcon (), historically anglicised as Mascon, is a city in east-central France. It is the prefecture of the department of Saône-et-Loire in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. Mâcon is home to near 34,000 residents, who are referred to in French as Mâconnais. The city gave its name to the nearby vineyards and wine &#x27;appellation&#x27;.

==Geography==
The city lies on the western bank of the river Saône, between Bresse in the east and the Beaujolais hills in the south. Mâcon is the southernmost city in the department of Saône-et-Loire and the region of Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. It is north of Lyon and from Paris. The climate is temperate with a slight continental tendency.

===Climate===
Mâcon features an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), with warm summers, slightly too cool to be called humid subtropical (&quot;Cfa&quot;). Winters are relatively cold to French standards, but milder and more rainy than north of Mâcon. Most precipitation is in spring and autumn.

==History==

===Ancient and Medieval eras===
The agglomeration of Mâcon originates from the establishment of an oppidum and of a river port by the Celts from the Aedui, probably at the beginning of the first century BC. Known then under the name of &quot;Matisco&quot;, the town developed significantly during the age of the Roman Empire. This is demonstrated by the large Roman hoard known as the Mâcon Treasure that was discovered in the town in 1764, the remains of which is in the British Museum. During the 4th century, the town was fortified.

During the Middle Ages, Mâcon was the administrative center of a county belonging to the Duchy of Burgundy at the extremity of the bridge over the Saône leading to the Bresse territory belonging to the Duchy of Savoy. The town controlled access to present-day Lamartinien Valley (Val Lamartinien), where the southern end of the Côte de Bourgogne joins the first foothills of the Beaujolais hills, opening the way to the rich plains of the Loire.

On 3 June 1564, Charles IX from Chalon, stopped in the town during his Royal Tour of France (1564–1566), accompanied by the Court and the nobles of his kingdom, including his brother the Duke of Anjou, Henry of Navarre, the cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine. The town is strategically built: it was a possible entrance into the kingdom for the Swiss or German mercenaries during the French Wars of Religion. He was welcomed by the Queen Jeanne III of Navarre, nicknamed the &quot;Queen of Protestants&quot;, and 1,500 Huguenots.

===Revolutionary and Imperial eras===
On 21 October 1790, the matriarch of a prominent local family gave birth to a son who remains highly visible in his hometown, the Romantic poet and historian Alphonse de Lamartine.

In 1790, the Revolutionary government designated Mâcon as the capital (&quot;chef-lieu&quot;) of Saône-et-Loire, a newly created &quot;département&quot; within the radical restructuring of national administration.

In 1814, the town was invaded by Austrian troops and then liberated twice by French troops before being permanently occupied until the fall of the Empire. After Napoléon&#x27;s return and the subsequent Hundred Days, Mâcon and the Mâconnais were again captured by the Austrians.
===Second World War===
During World War II, Mâcon was the northernmost town in the unoccupied &quot;zone libre&quot; between Paris and Lyon. On 11 November 1942, following Operation Anton, nearly eight hundred German soldiers settled in the city after crossing the demarcation line. From that date onwards, the Resistance was present in Mâcon. In April 1944, Jewish doctor Léon Israël was assassinated by the Milice.

The town was liberated on 4 September 1944 as part of Operation Dragoon by troops who had landed in Provence.

==Transport==
Mâcon is connected to neighbouring major cities through various routes:
* Roads:
** A6 motorway (Route: Paris-Lyon)
** A40 Motorway (route: Mâcon-Geneva)
** A406 Motorway (bypass south of Mâcon)
** Route nationale 6
** RCEA (Center-Europe-Atlantic road) which allows a direct traffic flow from Annemasse to Nantes or Bordeaux

* River infrastructures:
** The Saône river which allows access to the Mediterranean Sea via the Rhône River

===Public transport===
Mâcon uses the urban transport service Tréma, run by the organising transport authorities, the SITUM (Inter-communal City Transport Union of Mâconnais – Val de Saône). The SITUM currently consists of 3 members: CAMVAL (Agglomeration Community of Mâcon-Val de Saône) (26 communes) and the Chaintré and Crêches-sur-Saône communes. The Urban Transport Area of the SITUM extends over 28 communes in total.

On the evening of 30 June 2009, the Mâcon Bus services ceased operation. This was due to the public service delegation contract between the SITUM and the Mâcon Bus company (a subsidiary of Transdev), operating the network since 1987, not being renewed at the last call for bids. So since 1 July 2009, the company CarPostal Mâcon (CarPostal France&#x27;s subsidiary) has been providing city transport services on the network renamed Tréma.

The network Tréma, restructured on 31 August 2009, made the following bid:
*urban lines (A to G) going through Mâcon, Crêches-sur-Saône, Sancé, Saint-Laurent-sur-Saône, central Charnay-lès-Mâcon and Mâcon Loché TGV train station on a regular basis.
*a transport service requested by TrémA&#x27;Fil to operate in the other communes of the SITUM area, to increase the frequency of the less busy regular lines (F and G) and to offer a service for each city stop in the morning before the beginning of services for scheduled lines and in the evening after the end of the services.
*school lines named TrémA&#x27;Scol.

Mâcon is run by the network Buscephale of Saône-et-Loire&#x27;s local council.

==Administration==
Mâcon is a member of the Mâconnais Beaujolais Agglomération (agglomeration community), and also its seat.

**Collège Saint-Exupéry
**Collège Notre-Dame (private)

==Demography==
Mâcon is one of the department&#x27;s major employment areas which is by far the most dynamic (13.5% increase between 1999 and 2006) compared to cities such as Chalon-sur-Saône or Montceau-les-Mines which are losing jobs. This dynamism is particularly helped by the many transport links available and its proximity to Lyon.

The population data in the table and graph below refer to the commune of Mâcon proper, in its geography at the given years. The commune of Mâcon absorbed the former commune of Saint-Clément in 1856, Flacé-lès-Mâcon in 1964, Saint-Jean-le-Priche and Sennecé-lès-Mâcon in 1971 and Loché in 1972.

==Associated districts and communes==

===Town centre===

Mâcon&#x27;s town center of extends from &quot;Place Gardon&quot;, in the north, to the Roundabout of Europe in the south, from &quot;Place de la Barre&quot;, in the west, to the banks along the Saône to the east.
The quarters of the town&#x27;s centre are varied:
#The center by the town hall is the town&#x27;s shopping area (rue Carnot, rue Dufour, rue Sigorgne, rue Philibert-Laguiche, rue Dombert, rue Franche, the quay Lamartine, the esplanade Lamartine and rue de la Barre). Most landmarks are in this conventional &quot;centre-ville&quot; including the Cathedral of Saint-Vincent, the Church of Saint Pierre and the town&#x27;s two museums.
#The Saint-Antoine district is centred around the &quot;Place aux Herbes&quot; and the historic heart despite its relative distance from the Town Hall. This district covers the northern part of the town centre; it is crossed by the rue de Strasbourg and consists of narrow lanes. There is the prefecture (district headquarters) of Saône-et-Loire and the old Saint-Vincent Cathedral (Vieux Saint-Vincent).
#West lies the &quot;Square de la Paix&quot;, bordered by the Hôtel-Dieu, the Palais de Justice, Saint-Vincent Cathedral, plus the Vallon des Rigollettes and the &quot;Héritan&quot; district.

From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, the esplanade Lamartine underwent extensive redevelopment and upgrades. The winding car park and damaged cobblestones were replaced by an underground car park on three levels, a larger and brighter esplanade, bars, and a stage on the water (of the Saône river) which now accommodates various events, concerts and shows. The Statue Lamartine, which sits proudly on the esplanade, was completely renovated. Small gardens now brighten up the immense space that Mâcon&#x27;s Esplanade Lamartine occupies. All along, one can find an extract from the famous poem by Lamartine, &quot;Le Lac&quot;: &quot;Time, halt in your flight... &quot; engraved in the ground in silver letters.

===North of Mâcon===
The north of Mâcon is split, with the Neusdadt roundabout marking the boundary between the two sections. &quot;Flacé-lès-Mâcon&quot;, a village built in the city, constitutes the north-west of Mâcon. In addition to the adjoining Town Hall, church and small downtown area, &quot;Flacé&quot; consists entirely of residential areas.
The north-east of Mâcon is composed of various residential areas and the town&#x27;s sport centres (Physical Activity Training Course (P.A.P.A), public swimming pool, Centre for Sports Education, rowing, sailing and water skiing clubs, several football fields and clubs, and the Sports Palace). The residential areas consist mainly of low-rent council estates (HLM) with districts such as the priority development areas (ZUP) of Mâcon or the boulevard des États-Unis (road belonging administratively to the Saugeraies district).

===South of Mâcon===
The south of Mâcon is composed of three major areas.
#The first area is the &quot;Saint-Clément/Les Blanchettes&quot; block, also called &quot;Percée Sud&quot;. &quot;Saint-Clément&quot; only accounts for a small area but it is southern Mâcon&#x27;s main business area with the Europe roundabout. &quot;Les Blanchettes&quot; is a district of low-rent council estates (HLM) passing through Édouard-Herriot Avenue. It is a very woody area, which includes most notably the &quot;Parc des Allumettes&quot; and its numerous games for children. The Romanesque church is in &quot;Saint-Clément&quot;, bearing the name of this town.
#The second area is the largest in this part of the town; it is the industrial area south of Mâcon (the largest metropolitan area) which is composed of the Port River at Mâcon (6 in France).
#The third and final area in the south of Mâcon is the &quot;Chanaye / Fontenailles&quot; and is southwest of the town. &quot;Fontenailles&quot; is a residential area consisting of detached houses. &quot;La Chanaye&quot; (pronounced &quot;Chanai&quot;) is an area of low-rent council estates (HLM) bordered by the greenhouses of Mâcon. This district, along with the Boulevard des États-Unis, Saint-Clément/les Blanchettes and priority development areas (ZUP) of Mâcon, belongs to the sensitive urban zones (French ZUS).

===West of Mâcon===
The west of Mâcon is the least populated part of the town. This hosts Mâcon&#x27;s &quot;lycées&quot; (René Cassin, Lamartine, Alexandre Dumaine and Ozanam) and most of the colleges, along with some residential areas merged with those of Charnay-lès-Mâcon, the Hospital of Mâcon and the historic working class area of Mâcon,&quot;Bioux&quot;.

<doc id="684414" wikidata="Q18593" url="?curid=684414" title="Claudio Sanchez">
<text>Claudio Paul Sanchez III (born March 12, 1978) is an American writer and musician best known for being the lead singer, guitarist and primary lyricist for the progressive rock band Coheed and Cambria. He is the creator of the comic book series &quot;The Amory Wars&quot;, as well as &quot;Key of Z&quot; and &quot;Kill Audio&quot;, both co-written with his wife Chondra Echert. Sanchez co-authored the novel &quot;Year of the Black Rainbow&quot; with Peter David.

==Musical career==
Sanchez primarily provides lead vocals and guitar in Coheed and Cambria. However, he has also used theremins, synthesizers, and harmonicas in his side projects. Early in his career, Sanchez first performed with several different bands, all of which lasted a short period of time.

After departing from the band Beautiful Loser, Sanchez went on a trip to Paris, where he began writing a story, initially referred to as &quot;The Bag.On.Line Adventures of Coheed and Cambria&quot;, named after a store near where Sanchez stayed while in Paris. Two characters named Coheed and Cambria Kilgannon live in a fictional foreign galaxy known as Heaven&#x27;s Fence. In the original concept, Sanchez wrote a story about his girlfriend and himself traveling to a new, foreign place, but as the concept expanded the characters started to resemble his parents.

Sanchez was the lead singer and guitarist for Shabütie, which formed in Nyack, New York, in 1995. Shabutie released several EPs and wrote several songs which would eventually be released on &quot;The Second Stage Turbine Blade&quot;. The band broke up after Nate Kelley walked out on a performance but was later reformed with Josh Eppard replacing Nate Kelley on drums. This new band was dubbed Coheed and Cambria, named after the characters Sanchez had written about in Paris. Coheed and Cambria achieved success on the East Coast after releasing and touring &quot;The Second Stage Turbine Blade&quot;, and they gained mainstream success with the release of &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot; thanks to the single &quot;A Favor House Atlantic&quot;.

==Comics==
Sanchez began producing comic books in 2000, beginning with &quot;The Bag.On.Line Adventures&quot;. &quot;The Bag.On.Line Adventures&quot; lasted two issues due to problems with the artist, deadlines, and financial issues. Sanchez&#x27;s next project was the graphic novel &quot;Good Apollo, I&#x27;m Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness&quot;. The graphic novel was released alongside the album of the same name, however, Sanchez has stated that the novel was incomplete due to financial issues.

Sanchez began anew in 2008, with the series &quot;The Amory Wars&quot;, which chronicles events album by album. &quot;The Second Stage Turbine Blade&quot; was covered in two five-part comic book limited series. Alongside Peter David, Sanchez co-wrote the novel &quot;The Amory Wars: Year of the Black Rainbow&quot;, chronicling the events of the &quot;Year of the Black Rainbow&quot; album. Sanchez also released a twelve-issue comic book series adapting &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot; under the &quot;Amory Wars&quot; name. A forthcoming adaptation of the &quot;Good Apollo 1&quot; storyline was foreshadowed at the end of the twelfth issue.

Under the Evil Ink Comics label, he has also produced &quot;Kill Audio&quot; (2009), &quot;Key of Z&quot; (2011), and &quot;Translucid&quot; (2014) with Chondra Echert.

==Other work==
Sanchez also performs in a side project called The Prize Fighter Inferno. The band is a concept band based on the character Jesse, a boxer known as the Prize Fighter Inferno. The story focuses on The Blood Machine, a vicious contraption that murders its victims and takes their souls. Sanchez also released a two-song 7&quot; vinyl album titled &quot;The Beaver Records&quot; EP, which is associated with Kill Audio and The Prize Fighter Inferno.

On September 8, 2012, Sanchez released a six-song non-conceptual EP, &quot;Half Measures&quot;, under his side project The Prize Fighter Inferno.

On April 23, 2021, Sanchez released a new full-length album under The Prize Fighter Inferno titled &quot;The City Introvert&quot;.

On December 20, 2024, Sanchez released an album of cover songs titled &quot;Claudio Covers&quot;.

==Personal life==
Sanchez is of Puerto Rican and Italian descent.

<text>Phascolarctos is a genus of marsupials with one extant species, the koala &quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;, an iconic animal of Australia. Several extinct species of the genus are known from fossil material, these were also large tree dwellers that browsed on &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; leaves.

==Taxonomy==
The genus was named by French zoologist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1816.

The type species, the modern koala, was named as &quot;Lipurus cinereus&quot; by G. A. Goldfuss in 1817, later combined as &quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot;. Goldfuss published this name with a reproduction of John Lewin&#x27;s 1803 illustration of the species in New South Wales.

An accepted synonymy of other generic names referring to &quot;Phascolarctos&quot; was published in 1988. The koala is listed in national conservation legislation as &quot;&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot; (combined populations of Qld, NSW and the ACT)&quot;, previously determined in 2012 to be &quot;a species for the purposes of the EPBC act 1999&quot; (EPBC). The koala was classified as Least Concern on the Red List, and reassessed as Vulnerable in 2014.

The name is derived from Ancient Greek () &#x27;pouch&#x27; and () &#x27;bear&#x27;.

==Description==
&quot;Phascolarctos&quot; is a genus of large arboreal marsupials that has specialised in leaves of &quot;Eucalyptus&quot;, a poor quality and potentially toxic food source that is unavailable to most other native mammals. The extinct species are presumed to have similar diet and habits to the modern koala, the largest Australian folivore, which was exceeded in size by the even more robust &quot;P. stirtoni&quot;. The tail of koalas is almost absent, an unusual characteristic for a tree climbing mammal, although other anatomical features are well suited to that habitat. They have some resemblance to the wombats, a family of large terrestrial marsupials which are allied with koalas as Vombatiformes.

The fossil material referred to the extinct species of this genus is scarce and fragmentary. Some remains are tentatively referred to &quot;Phascolarctos stirtoni&quot;, and the specimen for &quot;Phascolarctos maris&quot;, a partial lower molar, was later suggested by Karen H. Black to be an example of variance within the &quot;P. stirtoni&quot; species.

==Distribution==
&quot;Phascolarctos&quot; species have been discovered as fossil remains in several regions across southern and eastern Australia, in South Australia, Queensland and Victoria, and still occurs in those states and New South Wales. The modern koala is also known in the fossil record of the southwest of Australia and many other regions, but no occurrence of a living or extinct &quot;Phascolarctos&quot; species is recorded in the states of Tasmania and the Northern Territory.

The existing koala &quot;P. cinereus&quot; once had a wide range across the continent, which substantially contracted as a consequence of climatic changes that included extremes such as glacial cycles. Extinction of regional populations includes their disappearance from Western Australia after the mid to late Pleistocene, where their previous success is indicated by numerous fossils discovered in the Leeuwin-Naturaliste region. The disappearance from Southwest Australia coincided with a change in the region&#x27;s fire regimes.

The temporal range of the &quot;Phascolarctus&quot; species includes fossils dated to the early Pliocene and mid to late Pleistocene. 
The earliest record of &quot;P. cinereus&quot;, the only species of the modern era, is dated to around 350 000 years ago. &quot;Phascolarctus&quot; is a remnant of a family that includes eight to ten genera, the Phascolarctidae, which diverged around 26 million years ago (during the Oligocene epoch).

The records for &quot;Phascolarctos yorkensis&quot; (Pledge, 1992) include occurrences in Curramulka Local Fauna in South Australia and Wellington Caves in New South Wales, possibly datable to the late Miocene.

==Classification==
&quot;Phascolarctos&quot; gives its name to the Phascolarctidae family, which allies a number of other genera that are now extinct. Anatomical similarities suggest the probably share a common ancestor of Vombatidae, represented by the living species of &quot;Vombatus&quot; and &quot;Lasiorhinus&quot;; the wombats are their closest extant relations among the Diprotodontia order of marsupials.

A previously recognised arrangement of infraspecific taxa may be summarised as
* &quot;Phascolarctos cinereus&quot; Koala
**&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus adustus&quot;, Thomas 1923. Mundubbera, QLD
**&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus cinereus&quot;, (Goldfuss 1817) NSW
**&quot;Phascolarctos cinereus victor&quot;, Troughton 1935. &#x27;Booral&#x27;, Victoria

Three subspecies have been recognised within the existing species, based on specimens collected in Queensland, New South Wales and a &quot;southern race&quot; in Victoria. These may only represent clinal variation within the species at different latitudes, a conclusion reached by a genomic comparison in 2019 that found no support for a classification as three subspecies; the study instead supports a proposal for the population be recognised as a single evolutionary significant unit for conservation purposes.

<text>Richard Brent Tully (born March 9, 1943) is a Canadian-born American astronomer at the Institute for Astronomy in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Born in Toronto, Ontario, and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Tully&#x27;s specialty is the astrophysics of galaxies. With J. Richard Fisher, he proposed the Tully–Fisher relation, which shows that the luminosity of a galaxy and the orbital velocities of its stars are correlated. This relation can be used to determine the distances of galaxies and, by inference, the size and age of the universe. His books &quot;The Nearby Galaxies Atlas &amp; Catalog&quot; published in 1988 give the 3D locations for 2,400 galaxies within 130 million light years of Earth. A particularly remarkable discovery was that our Milky Way galaxy lies adjacent a vast underdense region that Tully called the Local Void. A more extended compilation of 30,000 galaxies within a cube of diameter 700 million light years centered on Earth can be visually navigated with the planetarium computer software Starry Night Pro, where the data is called the &quot;Tully Database&quot;.

Tully, along with colleagues Helene Courtois, Daniel Pomarede, and Yehuda Hoffman, have compiled and analyzed galaxy distances and deviations of galaxy motions from cosmic expansion within the Cosmicflows program. Noteworthy discoveries have been the full extent of our home supercluster of galaxies, given the name  Laniakea Supercluster, and of the adjacent, very large  South Pole Wall  of galaxies. Cumulatively, the large scale structure in the distribution of matter in a volume of diameter 1.3 billion light years centered on our location mapped by Tully and his colleagues reasonably accounts for the motion of our  Local Group  of galaxies of over 600 kilometers/second although there remains the possibility of influences from even larger scales.

Brent Tully received numerous awards and recognitions, among which the Viktor Ambartsumian Prize and the Gruber Prize in Cosmology, both in 2014.

<doc id="684445" wikidata="Q945167" url="?curid=684445" title="Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea">
<text>The Democratic Party of Equatorial Guinea (, abbreviated PDGE) is the ruling political party in Equatorial Guinea. It was established by President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo on 11 October 1987.

Prior to 1991, the PDGE was the sole legal political organization in the country. Still, the PDGE has been the dominant party since its inception, and it typically wins almost all seats in the Parliament. In the 2004 legislative election, 98 of 100 seats were won by either PDGE members or &quot;opposition&quot; parties that support Obiang; in the 2008 legislative election, the PDGE and its allies won a total of 99 out of 100 seats. There have never been more than eight true opposition deputies in the lower house, and the PDGE and its allies have won every seat in the upper chamber since its inception in 2013. Consequently, there is no substantive opposition to presidential decisions.

Similarly, Obiang typically wins 95 to 99% of the vote in presidential elections, with the opposition regularly calling for boycotts. In the 2016 presidential election, however, Obiang won around 93% of the vote, a new low for his presidency.

The party has an extremely narrow base, which is the Esangui clan of the Fang tribe, located in the Mongomo region of Río Muni. Since independence in 1968, Equatorial Guinea has been ruled by a single family; the first president, Francisco Macías Nguema, was overthrown by his nephew, Obiang, in the 1979 coup d&#x27;état. The party has been criticized for acting in an authoritarian manner and teaming up with the government to inform on political dissidents. The party is considered by the vast majority of international observers to be corrupt.

==Stances==
The PDGE has little in the way of a platform or guiding ideology other than support for Obiang, although it has sometimes been described as pseudo-populist. One of its few concrete policy stances is support of foreign investment in the oil sector. Some of the few other tenets of the PDGE are militarism and anti-separatism (which often amounts to Fang chauvinism).

The community leaders in all of rural Equatorial Guinea are strongly pressured to be members of the party, and also pressure citizens throughout their communities into joining.
Although almost all the highest placed political appointments are held by former soldiers, the core military force, the Army, remains somewhat underfunded in favour of naval and air-force maintenance. Government expenditures are equal to less than 10% of GDP, with military expenditures accounting for roughly 25-35% of that figure. The amount of the budget spent on schooling, healthcare and other such investments is in proximity to the military budget. The constitution guarantees that the government will have a monopoly in certain industries, although much has been done to privatise these industries, in similar fashion to the way oil drilling was privatised. The party also has a minister for women, and has in recent years pursued a female empowerment agenda.

<doc id="684448" wikidata="Q3565608" url="?curid=684448" title="High and tight">
<text>The high and tight is a military variant of the crew cut. It is a very short hairstyle, characterized by the back and sides of the head being shaved to the skin and the option for the top to be blended or faded into slightly longer hair. It is most commonly worn by men in the U.S. armed forces. It is also popular with law enforcement officers and other public safety personnel. Although &quot;high and tight&quot; is the primary term used in military and law enforcement, the same haircut is sometimes referred to by civilians as a &quot;walker&quot;.

==Styling==
While many variations of the style exist, the one common feature is that all of the hair on the sides and back of the head is clipped very close, usually or shorter, up to a point above the temples (referring to the &quot;high&quot; part of its name). A sharp line delineates the boundary between the close-cut sides and back and the longer top portion (referring to the &quot;tight&quot; part of its name). The crown of the head is spared the closest shaving to safely accommodate the weight of a combat helmet. The length of the top portion may vary, usually being , but sometimes left long enough to comb. The back and sides of the head are sometimes shaved completely with a razor.

According to U.S. Air Force instructions, U.S. military haircuts must have: &quot;A tapered appearance on both sides and the back of the head, both with and without headgear. A tapered appearance is one that when viewed from any angle outlines the member&#x27;s hair so that it conforms to the shape of the head, curving inward to the natural termination point without eccentric directional flow, twists or spiking.&quot;

==Usage==

Beginning in the late 1980s, the high and tight crossed over into civilian life, being embraced first by mostly young black males (see hi-top fade) before spreading to other groups. From the 1990s to the present day, the hairstyle has also been popular among Syrian, Egyptian and Moroccan youths.

In Indonesia, the high and tight is known as &quot;Cepak&quot; (pronounced &quot;Cheu-pak&quot;) and is worn by all military and some police personnel, particularly those serving in paramilitary units. The national identity of a male Indonesian Armed Forces member is indicated by this haircut; it is also worn by students of other service academies in the country. Officers of general rank rarely wear the high and tight, with a notable exception being Minister of Defense Ryamizard Ryacudu.

==Variations==
===Horseshoe flattop===
In this version of the high and tight, the top of the head is clipped in a flattop style, with the hair short enough that the scalp is plainly visible along the centerline of the anteroposterior axis of the head. This creates the distinctive appearance of seemingly having a horseshoe-shaped hairstyle. The exposed scalp is sometimes referred to as a &quot;landing strip&quot;.

===Recon===
This version has higher boundaries, with the only hair present starting well above the crown of the head. The name is a reference to the haircut&#x27;s association with reconnaissance units of the U.S. Army, Marines, and Navy. The &quot;recon&quot; can also be cut short on the top to incorporate the look of the horseshoe flattop.

<doc id="684458" wikidata="Q241411" url="?curid=684458" title="Netsky (computer worm)">
<text>Netsky is a prolific family of computer worms which affect Microsoft Windows operating systems. The first variant appeared on Monday, February 16, 2004. The &quot;B&quot; variant was the first family member to find its way into mass distribution. It appeared on Wednesday, February 18, 2004. 18-year-old Sven Jaschan of Germany confessed to having written these, and other worms, such as Sasser. 

Although individual functions vary widely from virus to virus, the Netsky family perhaps is most famous for comments contained within the code of its variants insulting the authors of the Bagle and Mydoom worm families and, in some cases, routines that removed versions of these viruses. The &quot;war&quot; as it was referred to in the media caused a steady increase in the number of variant viruses produced in these families. As of June 2004, Bagle had approximately 28, Netsky approximately 29, and MyDoom approximately 10.

Other symptoms of Netsky included beeping sounds on specified dates, usually in the morning hours.

The worm was sent out as an e-mail, enticing recipients to open an attachment. Once opened, the attached program would scan the computer for e-mail addresses and e-mail itself to all addresses found.

Until October 2006, the P variant of this virus remained the most prevalent virus being sent in e-mail throughout the world, despite being over two and a half years old. It was surpassed by a variant from the Stration malware family in November 2006.

Drum and bass musician Netsky has based his artist name on this computer worm. The idea behind it was that there was a chance people would download the virus if they searched the internet to illegally download his music.

<text>Diet Rite is an American brand of no-calorie soft drinks that was originally distributed by the RC Cola company.

==History==
Diet Rite was introduced in 1955 and initially released as a dietetic product, but was introduced nationwide and marketed to the general public as a healthful beverage in 1962. The original formula was sweetened with cyclamate and saccharin. After cyclamate was banned in 1969, it was removed from the product. NutraSweet brand aspartame was added upon its introduction to the market, and in 1987 the saccharin was replaced entirely with the complete elimination of caffeine. In the 1990s, several fruit-flavored varieties of Diet Rite were introduced. 

In 2000, the line was reformulated yet again, this time to replace aspartame with Splenda brand sucralose and Sunett brand acesulfame potassium. It became the first major diet soda in the United States to use neither aspartame nor saccharin as a sweetener. In 2005, &quot;Pure Zero&quot; was added to the name, and a cherry cola flavor was introduced in 2006.

Today, it is owned by and distributed by Keurig Dr Pepper.

==Advertising==
In the early 1960s The Paris Sisters sang a jingle for a Diet Rite television commercial, with the line &quot;Stay thin with the best-tasting cola of all!&quot;.

<text>James Richard Fisher (born December 10, 1943) is an American astronomer. He received his Ph.D. in Astronomy in 1972 from the University of Maryland, College Park and his B.S. in Physics in 1965 from the Pennsylvania State University, University Park.

==Education and research==
Much of Fisher&#x27;s career has involved radio astronomy instrumentation, including telescope feed design, radio frequency interference mitigation, and signal processing. He joined NRAO in 1972 at the Green Bank, West Virginia site. He was part of the team that conceived and designed the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope there. He moved to the Central Development Lab at the Charlottesville NRAO headquarters in 2005, where he retired in 2012 but continues to be active in instrumentation projects.

In 1978 through 1980 he spent 18 months at the Radiophysics Laboratory of CSIRO in Sydney, Australia, and on the return trip spent 2 months at the Raman Research Institute in Bangalore, India.

Along with R. Brent Tully, he proposed the Tully–Fisher relation, a correlation between the luminosity of a galaxy and the width of emission lines in its spectrum.

<doc id="684484" wikidata="Q591137" url="?curid=684484" title="Azygos vein">
<text>The azygos vein (from Ancient Greek ἄζυγος (ázugos), meaning &#x27;unwedded&#x27; or &#x27;unpaired&#x27;) is a vein running up the right side of the thoracic vertebral column draining itself towards the superior vena cava. It connects the systems of superior vena cava and inferior vena cava and can provide an alternative path for blood to the right atrium when either of the venae cavae is blocked.

==Structure==

The azygos vein transports deoxygenated blood from the posterior walls of the thorax and abdomen into the superior vena cava.

It is formed by the union of the ascending lumbar veins with the right subcostal veins at the level of the 12th thoracic vertebra, ascending to the right of the descending aorta and thoracic duct, passing behind the right crus of diaphragm, anterior to the vertebral bodies of T12 to T5 and right posterior intercostal arteries. At the level of T4 vertebrae, it arches over the root of the right lung from behind to the front to join the superior vena cava. The trachea and oesophagus is located medially to the arch of the azygous vein. 

The &quot;arch of the azygos vein&quot; (&quot;arcus venae azygos&quot;) is an important anatomic landmark. As an anatomical variation in 1–2% of the population, the arch can be displaced laterally, thereby creating a pleural septum separating an azygos lobe from the upper lobe of the right lung.

The origin and anatomical course of the azygos vein are quite variable. Usually, there is a singular azygos vein on the right side of the body. However, the azygos vein is occasionally located in the midline or two independent veins may be present like in early embryonic development. In some rare variations, for example, it also drains thoracic veins, bronchial veins, and even gonadal veins. The vein is so named because it has no symmetrically equivalent vein on the left side of the body.

===Development===
It has been proposed that the azygos vein develops by originally draining to the posterior cardinal vein and then to the longitudinal venous channel. Following retrogression of the left common cardinal vein, the left azygos vein loses contact with the posterior cardinal vein. Thus, the blood drains into the right azygos line.

===Tributaries===
Major tributaries are the hemiazygos vein and accessory hemiazygos vein, draining into the azygous vein at the midthoracic level. These two veins are located at the opposite side of the vertebral column. The azygous vein also receives drainage from all the intercostal veins on the right, except for supreme intercostal vein (first intercostal vein). Other tributaries include the right bronchial veins and veins from pericardium, mediastinum, and oesophagus. It communicates with the vertebral venous plexuses.

==Function==
The azygos system of veins is considered to be the azygos vein, along with its left-sided counterparts, the hemiazygos vein and the accessory hemiazygos vein. It also creates a cavo-caval anastomosis by offering an alternative, collateral blood flow from the lower half of the body to the superior vena cava, bypassing the inferior vena cava. This can have clinical significance in any blood flow restriction of the inferior vena cava.

==Clinical significance==
Azygos vein abnormalities can be suggested on chest radiograph by enlargement of the azygos shadow to greater than 1 cm. False positives can occur in heart failure causing increased pressures on the right side of the heart, or adjacent lymphadenopathy. Azygos and hemiazygos continuation of the inferior vena cava (IVC) was not common in daily life. It is very hard to observe, particularly when it is not associated with congenital heart disease or deep venous thrombosis. Thus, it is crucial to diagnose the enlarged azygos vein at the confluence with the superior vena cava and in the retrocrural space to prevent misdiagnosis as a right-sided paratracheal mass. The loss of the intrahepatic segment of IVC with azygous and hemiazygos continuation happens in 0.6% of patients diagnosed for congenital heart disease and usually occurs simultaneously with situs inversus, asplenia, or polysplenia, persistent left superior vena cava (SVC), and congenital pulmonary venolobar syndrome. Azygos and hemiazygos continuation of the IVC is rare especially when it is not associated with congenital heart disease.

==History==
The Greek root &quot;zyg&quot; refers to a pair. &#x27;A-&#x27; means &quot;not&quot;. Thus, &quot;azygos&quot; means &quot;unpaired&quot;. The azygos vein is unpaired in that there is only one in the body, mostly on the right side. While there is the hemiazygos vein and its accessory on the left side of the body, they are considered tributaries of the azygos vein rather than its left-side equivalent.

This terminology is only accurate in some species, such as the human, dog, and cat. Ruminants (such as sheep and cows) have paired azygos veins.

<doc id="684489" wikidata="Q486802" url="?curid=684489" title="Toughness">
<text>In materials science and metallurgy, toughness is the ability of a material to absorb energy and plastically deform without fracturing. Toughness is the strength with which the material opposes rupture. One definition of material toughness is the amount of energy per unit volume that a material can absorb before rupturing. This measure of toughness is different from that used for fracture toughness, which describes the capacity of materials to resist fracture.
Toughness requires a balance of strength and ductility.

==Toughness and strength==
Toughness is related to the area under the stress–strain curve. In order to be tough, a material must be both strong and ductile. For example, brittle materials (like ceramics) that are strong but with limited ductility are not tough; conversely, very ductile materials with low strengths are also not tough. To be tough, a material should withstand both high stresses and high strains. Generally speaking, strength indicates how much force the material can support, while toughness indicates how much energy a material can absorb before rupturing.

==Mathematical definition==
Toughness can be determined by integrating the stress-strain curve. It is the energy of mechanical deformation per unit volume prior to fracture. The explicit mathematical description is:

formula_1

where
* formula_2 is strain
* formula_3 is the strain upon failure
* formula_4 is stress

If the upper limit of integration up to the yield point is restricted, the energy absorbed per unit volume is known as the modulus of resilience. Mathematically, the modulus of resilience can be expressed by the product of the square of the yield stress divided by two times the Young&#x27;s modulus of elasticity. That is,

==Toughness tests==
The toughness of a material can be measured using a small specimen of that material. A typical testing machine uses a pendulum to deform a notched specimen of defined cross-section. The height from which the pendulum fell, minus the height to which it rose after deforming the specimen, multiplied by the weight of the pendulum, is a measure of the energy absorbed by the specimen as it was deformed during the impact with the pendulum. The Charpy and Izod notched impact strength tests are typical ASTM tests used to determine toughness.

==Unit of toughness==
Tensile toughness (or &quot;deformation energy&quot;, &quot;U&quot;T) is measured in units of joule per cubic metre (J·m−3), or equivalently newton-metre per cubic metre (N·m·m−3), in the SI system and inch-pound-force per cubic inch (in·lbf·in−3) in US customary units:
*1.00 N·m·m−3 ≃  in·lbf·in−3
* 1.00 in·lbf·in−3 ≃ 6.89 kN·m·m−3.

In the SI system, the unit of tensile toughness can be easily calculated by using area underneath the stress–strain (&quot;σ&quot;–&quot;ε&quot;) curve, which gives tensile toughness value, as given below:

*&quot;U&quot;T = Area underneath the stress–strain (&quot;σ&quot;–&quot;ε&quot;) curve = &quot;σ&quot; × &quot;ε&quot;
*&quot;U&quot;T [=] F/A × ΔL/L = (N·m−2)·(unitless)
*&quot;U&quot;T [=] N·m·m−3
*&quot;U&quot;T [=] J·m−3

== Toughest material ==
An alloy made of almost equal amounts of chromium, cobalt and nickel (CrCoNi) is the toughest material discovered thus far. It resists fracturing even at incredibly cold temperatures close to absolute zero. It is being considered as a material used in building spacecraft.

<text>The Guyandotte River is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately 166 mi (267 km) long, in southwestern West Virginia in the United States. It was named after the French term for the Wendat Native Americans. It drains an area of the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau south of the Ohio between the watersheds of the Kanawha River to the northeast and Twelvepole Creek and the Big Sandy River to the southwest. Via the Ohio River, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

==Course==

The Guyandotte River is formed in southwestern Raleigh County by the confluence of three streams, Winding Gulf, Stonecoal Creek, and the Devils Fork. The Guyandotte flows initially west northwest into Wyoming and Mingo counties. It turns briefly northward in Mingo County and enters Logan County, where it turns north northwest for the remainder of its highly meandering course through Logan, Lincoln and Cabell counties. It enters the Ohio River from the south at Huntington, about 5 mi (8 km) east of the city&#x27;s downtown.

==Dams==
A U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dam in Mingo County causes the river to widen as R. D. Bailey Lake in Mingo and western Wyoming counties.

==Tributaries==
The Mud River joins the Guyandotte at Barboursville in Cabell County. The Slab Fork joins the Guyandotte in downtown Mullens in Wyoming County. Big Ugly Creek joins the Guyandotte in Lincoln County.

==Upper Guyandotte Watershed Association==
In Mullens, an active watershed organization is working to reduce pollution in the headwaters of the Guyandotte River. The Upper Guyandotte Watershed Association (UGWA) is a grassroots, community-based organization working to reduce sources of pollution in order to clean up streams and make the watershed a better place to live. UGWA has garnered much public support and produced results in partnering with numerous local, state, and federal agencies.

<text>The University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore (UET Lahore) is a public university located in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan specializing in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. It is the oldest and one of the most selective engineering institutions in Pakistan. Every year around 40,000 candidates appear in ECAT while there are around 3,045 fully subsidized (A1 &amp; A1-M) and partially subsidized (A2 and A2-M) seats available in UET Lahore and its campuses, making a selection ratio of 7.6% in ECAT based disciplines.

==History and overview==
Founded on 1 January 1921 in Mughalpura, a suburban area of Lahore, as Mughalpura Technical College, it later became the MacLagan Engineering College, a name given to it in 1923 after Sir Edward Douglas MacLagan, the then Governor of Punjab, who laid the foundation stone of the main building, now called the Main Block. In 1929, it was affiliated with the University of Punjab for the award of bachelor&#x27;s degrees in electrical and mechanical engineering. In 1939, the name was again changed to Punjab College of Engineering and Technology, and a Civil Engineering degree was also started in the college. At the time of partition, part of the college relocated to India, called East Punjab College of Engineering. In 1954, a bachelor&#x27;s degree program in mining engineering was started. In 1962, it was granted a charter and was named the West Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. During the 1960s, bachelor&#x27;s degree programs were started in chemical engineering, petroleum and gas engineering, metallurgical engineering, architecture and city and regional planning. In 1972, it was officially renamed the University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. By the 1970s, it had established a score of master&#x27;s degree programs in engineering, architecture, city and regional planning and allied disciplines. Several Ph.D. degree programs were also started.

A second campus of the university was established in 1975 in Sahiwal, which was relocated to Taxila in 1978 and became an independent university in 1993 called the University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila.

<text>Jean Améry (31 October 191217 October 1978), born Hanns Chaim Mayer, was an Austrian-born essayist whose work was often informed by his experiences during World War II. His most celebrated work, &quot;At the Mind&#x27;s Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor on Auschwitz and Its Realities&quot; (1966), suggests that torture was &quot;the essence&quot; of the Third Reich. Other notable works included &quot;On Aging&quot; (1968) and &quot;On Suicide: A Discourse on Voluntary Death&quot; (1976). He adopted the pseudonym Jean Améry after 1945. Améry died by suicide in 1978.

Formerly a philosophy and literature student in Vienna, Améry&#x27;s participation in organized resistance against the Nazi occupation of Belgium resulted in his detainment and torture by the German Gestapo at Fort Breendonk, and several years of imprisonment in concentration camps. Améry survived internments in Auschwitz and Buchenwald, and was finally liberated at Bergen-Belsen in 1945. After the war he settled in Belgium.

== Early life ==
Jean Améry was born as Hanns Chaim Mayer in Vienna, Austria, in 1912, to a Jewish father and a Catholic mother. His father was killed in action in World War I in 1916. Améry was raised as a Roman Catholic by his mother. Eventually, Améry and his mother returned to Vienna, where he enrolled in university to study literature and philosophy, but economic necessity kept him from regular pursuit of studies there.

== Religion ==
While Améry&#x27;s family was &quot;estranged from its Jewish origins, assimilated and intermarried&quot;, this alienation itself, in the context of Nazi occupation, informed much of his thought: &quot;I wanted by all means to be an anti-Nazi, that most certainly, but of my own accord.&quot;

The Nuremberg Laws of 1935, the text of which he soon came to know by heart, convinced Améry that Germany had essentially passed a sentence of death on all Jews, and that included himself. His &quot;The Necessity and Impossibility of Being a Jew&quot; speaks to this inner conflict as to his identity. He suggests that while his personal identity, the identity of his own childhood past, is distinctly Christian, he feels himself nonetheless a Jew in another sense, the sense of a Jewishness &quot;without God, without history, without messianic-national hope&quot;.

== During Nazi rule ==
In 1938, when the Nazis were welcomed into Austria and the country joined with Germany into a &quot;Greater Reich&quot;, Améry fled to France, and then to Belgium with his Jewish wife, Regina, whom he had chosen in opposition to his mother&#x27;s wishes. His wife later died of heart disease while hiding in Brussels. Ironically, he was initially deported back to France by the Belgians as a German alien and wound up interned in the south.

After escaping from the camp at Gurs, he returned to Belgium where he joined the Resistance movement.

Involved in the distribution of anti-military propaganda to the German occupying forces, Améry was captured by the Nazis in July 1943 and routinely tortured at the Belgian Gestapo center at Fort Breendonk. When it was established that there was no information to be extracted from him, he was &quot;demoted&quot; from political prisoner to Jew, and shipped to Auschwitz.

Lacking any trade skills, he was assigned to the harshest physical labors, building the I.G. Farben factory at Auschwitz III, the Buna-Monowitz labor camp. In the face of the Soviet invasion in the following year, he was evacuated first to Buchenwald and then to Bergen-Belsen, where he was liberated by the British army in April 1945.

== After the war ==

After the war, the former Hanns Mayer changed his name to Jean Améry (the surname being a French-sounding anagram of his family name) in order to symbolize his dissociation from German culture and his alliance with French culture. He lived in Brussels, working as a culture journalist for German language newspapers in Switzerland. He refused to publish in Germany or Austria for many years, publishing only in Switzerland. He did not write at all of his experiences in the death camps until 1964, when, at the urging of German poet Helmut Heißenbüttel, he wrote his book &quot;Jenseits von Schuld und Sühne&quot; (&quot;Beyond Guilt and Atonement&quot;). It was later translated into English by Sidney and Stella P. Rosenfeld as &quot;At the Mind&#x27;s Limits: Contemplations by a Survivor on Auschwitz and its Realities&quot;.

He later married Marie Eschenauer, whom he was still married to at the time of his death.

== Death ==
In 1976 Améry published the book &quot;On Suicide: A Discourse on Voluntary Death.&quot; He died by suicide via an overdose of sleeping pills in 1978.

== Literary and philosophical legacy ==

The publication of &quot;At the Mind&#x27;s Limits&quot;, Améry&#x27;s exploration of the Holocaust and the nature of the Third Reich, made him one of the most highly regarded of Holocaust writers. In comparing the Nazis to a government of sadism, Améry suggests that it is the sadist&#x27;s nature to want &quot;to nullify the world&quot;. For a Nazi torturer,

[a] slight pressure by the tool-wielding hand is enough to turn the other – along with his head, in which are perhaps stored Kant and Hegel, and all nine symphonies, and &quot;The World as Will and Representation&quot; – into a shrill squealing piglet at slaughter.

Améry&#x27;s efforts to preserve the memory of the Holocaust focused on the terror and horror of the events in a phenomenological and philosophical way, with what he characterized as &quot;a scant inclination to be conciliatory&quot;. His explorations of his experiences and the meaning and legacy of Nazi-era suffering were aimed not at resolving the events finally into &quot;the cold storage of history&quot;, but rather keeping the subject alive so that it would not be lost to posterity, as an abstraction or mere text. As he wrote in his 1976 preface to &quot;Beyond Guilt and Atonement&quot;:

I do not have [clarity] today, and I hope that I never will. Clarification would amount to disposal, settlement of the case, which can then be placed in the files of history. My book is meant to prevent precisely this. For nothing is resolved, nothing is settled, no remembering has become mere memory.

With the prize money that the Viennese writer Robert Menasse received for the Austrian State Prize (1999) he re-founded the “Jean Améry–Preis für Europäische Essayistik”, whose winners were Lothar Baier, Barbara Sichtermann (1985), Mathias Greffrath (1988), Reinhard Merkel (1991), Franz Schuh (2000), Doron Rabinovici (2002), Michael Jeismann (2004), Journalist, Drago Jančar (2007), Imre Kertész (2009), Dubravka Ugrešić (2012), Adam Zagajewski (2016) and Karl-Markus Gauß (2018).

Améry was known for his opposition to antisemitism in postwar Germany and support for the state of Israel, which he said was &quot;more important than any other&quot; country to him. In 1969, he wrote an article in &quot;Die Zeit&quot; in which he stated: &quot;Anti-Zionism contains antisemitism like a cloud contains a storm&quot;. Yet the ‘admittedly sketchy’ reports of torture in Israeli prisons prompted Améry to consider the limits of his solidarity with the Jewish state: &quot;I urgently call on all Jews who want to be human beings to join me in the radical condemnation of systematic torture. Where barbarism begins, even existential commitments must end.&quot; Still, Améry warned of &quot;a revived antisemitism, often under the cover of anti-Zionism.&quot; He writes: &quot;When I set about writing, and finished, there was no antisemitism in Germany, or more correctly: where it did exist, it did not dare to show itself.&quot; Alvin Rosenfeld concludes: &quot;As he looked about him, he recognised that those days were gone, and not only in Germany. Antisemitism was no longer hidden covertly in the shadows but was, once again, a threatening presence in the public sphere.&quot;

<doc id="684526" wikidata="Q1351157" url="?curid=684526" title="Saramacca District">
<text>Saramacca is a district of Suriname, in the north. Saramacca&#x27;s capital city is Groningen, with other towns and cities including Batavia, Kampong Baroe, Uitkijk, Maho and Boskamp. Saramacca has a population of 17,480 and an area of 3,636 km2.

Saramaka is also the name of a group of Maroons who established communities along the Saramacca River having fled slavery.

==History==
The district was founded in 1983, but the history dates back to 1790 when the first plantation was opened. Until 1936, Saramacca could only be access by boat, but with the construction of a road to Paramaribo, which is now part of the East-West Link, Saramacca was removed for its isolation. In 1982, oil was discovered in Sarammacca which boosted its economy. On 13 December 2014, Staatsolie opened an oil refinery.

==Agriculture==
The district has traditionally been the site of dozens of small, family owned farming communities, and it has only been recently that large agricultural projects have begun to emerge, primarily geared to the production of bananas, rice, and peanuts. Boskamp is a fishing village.

==Nature==
The district is known for its birds, with ornithologists and birdwatchers coming from all over the world to study and admire Saramacca&#x27;s toucans, parrots and cocks-of-the-rock.

Saramacca is home to three nature reserves: Coppename Monding Nature Reserve (12,000 hectares), Boven Coesewijne Nature Reserve (27,000 hectares) and the Special Control Area (88,400 hectares).

==Resorts==

Saramacca is divided into 6 resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
* Calcutta
* Groningen
* Jarikaba
* Kampong Baroe
* Tijgerkreek
* Wayamboweg

==Villages==
* Batavia
* Boskamp
* Boston
* Kalebaskreek

<doc id="684538" wikidata="Q1130138" url="?curid=684538" title="Sipaliwini District">
<text>Sipaliwini is the largest district of Suriname, located in the south. Sipaliwini is the only district that does not have a regional capital, as it is directly administered by the national government in Paramaribo. Sipaliwini District includes disputed areas, with the southwestern region controlled and administered by Guyana, whereas the southeastern region is controlled by French Guiana.

==History==
Sipaliwini was created in 1983 and has a population of 37,065 and an area of . The district is nearly 4 times as large as the other 9 districts of Suriname combined; however, most of Sipaliwini is almost completely covered by rainforest. To create the district, the Nickerie District was reduced from around to . Sipaliwini is the tribal area inhabited by Maroons and indigenous people. Various peace treaties starting in 1686 had recognised autonomy for the tribes over their own area; however, a specific delineation of the tribal area had been lacking. The name is of Indigenous origin, referring to the Sipaliwini River, and means &quot;river of stones or rocks&quot;.

It is thought by archaeologists that hunter-gatherers lived in what is today Sipaliwini district during the Paleolithic period. The region was largely left alone during the colonial period, as the Dutch that controlled Suriname were fearful of the Portuguese in Brazil, and it was not until the 20th century that development projects began.

As of 2004, there were 41 schools in the areas. An increase in schools is planned, because some children have to travel long distances by foot or boat to neighbouring villages. As of 2004, there are 24 clinics in the district. Medical care is provided by Medische Zending. In the 1950s, Operation Grasshopper established many tiny airstrips in the district in order to make the territory accessible.

Sipaliwini district had seen occasional fighting in the late 1960s between Guyanese and Surinamese troops over border disputes in the south-west Tigri Area of the Coeroeni resort.

==Nature==

Sipaliwini consists of large areas of tropical rain forests, mountains, and savannas. In 1998, the Central Suriname Nature Reserve was created by Conservation International and the government of Suriname from the fusion of three existing nature reserves: Ralleighvallen, Tafelberg and Eilerts de Haangebergte. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 for its pristine tropical rainforest ecosystem. It is known for its rapids and bird species, including the Guiana Cock of the Rock (&quot;Rupicola rupicola&quot;). Over 5,000 different plants have been identified, and large mammals like the jaguar, giant armadillo, and eight species of primates. A research station is located at the foot of Voltzberg and the area is tourist attraction.

The Sipaliwini Savanna Nature Reserve has been established in 1972, and is of savannah, and the second largest in Suriname. The reserve is near pristine and offers a wide variety in flora and fauna.

The Tumuk Humak Mountains are located in the southeastern part of the district, along the border with French Guiana.

== Administration ==
Until 2011, Sipaliwini was administered by one district commissioner residing in Paramaribo. In the years since, district commissioners have been appointed for each separate resort.

=== Resorts ===

Sipaliwini is divided into 7 resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
==Villages==

<doc id="684542" wikidata="Q1137854" url="?curid=684542" title="Courtney Pine">
<text>Courtney Pine, is a British jazz musician, who was the principal founder in the 1980s of the black British band the Jazz Warriors. Although known primarily for his saxophone playing, Pine is a multi-instrumentalist, also playing the flute, clarinet, bass clarinet and keyboards. On his 2011 album, &quot;Europa&quot;, he plays almost exclusively bass clarinet.

==Background==
Pine&#x27;s parents were Jamaican immigrants, his father a carpenter and his mother a housing manager. As a child, Pine wanted to be an astronaut. Born in London, Pine lived in the &quot;Avenues&quot; area of Kensal Green in north-west London, before moving to Wembley and attending Kingsbury High School, where he studied classical clarinet, teaching himself the saxophone from the age of 14. He began his music career playing reggae, touring in 1981 with Clint Eastwood &amp; General Saint.

==Career==

In 1986, Pine&#x27;s debut album &quot;Journey to the Urge Within&quot; entered the UK Top 40. One of his early bands was Grand Union Orchestra and he featured on their 1986 album &quot;The Song of Many Tongues&quot;, written by Tony Haynes. 

Pine is the principal founder of the seminal black British big band the Jazz Warriors, which he established in 1985 through the community organisation &quot;The Abibi Jazz Arts&quot; (TAJA). The Jazz Warriors developed out of the Abibi All-Stars community band that did a series of performances at London&#x27;s Royal Festival Hall foyer during the summer of the International Youth Year 1985. The Jazz Warriors recorded two albums under Pine&#x27;s leadership: &quot;Out of Many, One People&quot;, which was released on the Antilles division of the Island Records label in 1987, and &quot;Afropeans&quot;, which was released on Pine&#x27;s own label, Destin-e Records, for their 20th anniversary in 2007. The Jazz Warriors &quot;Afropeans&quot; project was commissioned by the Arts Council of England to commemorate the bicentennary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act.

Thirty years after Pine planted his idea to start the Jazz Warriors, he put together the &quot;Venus Warriors&quot; all-female jazz band for a charity performance to raise awareness of the Mary Seacole Memorial Statue Appeal, which was established to erect a statue of the British-Jamaican Crimean War business woman and nurse outside of London&#x27;s St Thomas&#x27; Hospital.

His recent music integrates modern British music like drum and bass and UK garage with contemporary jazz styles. He runs his own band and integrates many contemporary musicians in his performances. He also presents &quot;Jazz Crusade&quot; on BBC Radio 2, the seventh series of which was broadcast during spring 2007.

In 1988 he appeared as himself in a jazz quartet in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot;.

After losing his record contract, in 1989 Pine appeared on stage with the Pet Shop Boys at Wembley Arena. He played saxophone on the closing portion of their single, Nothing Has Been Proved. 

Pine was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 2000, and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2009 New Year Honours for services to jazz music. He was also awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Westminster on 6 December 2004. He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Southampton on 15 July 2010.

Pine appeared in August 2008 as an advocate for Pierre Boulez, on the BBC World News classical music programme &quot;Visionaries&quot;.

On Christmas Day 2018, Pine appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas Baby – with Gregory Porter &amp; Friends&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pine lives in London with his wife and their four children.

<doc id="684545" wikidata="Q1147524" url="?curid=684545" title="Wanica District">
<text>Wanica is a district of Suriname located in the north of the country. Wanica&#x27;s capital city is Lelydorp, the second-largest city in Suriname. 
Wanica has a population of 118,222 and an area of 443 km2. Following neighboring Paramaribo, Wanica is the second most populated and urbanized district of Suriname. Two-thirds of the country&#x27;s population live in these two districts.

==History==
The district was created in 1983 out of parts of the former Suriname District. The district was named Wanica after Pad van Wanica, the main road, Wanica Creek (present in the district), and the fact that the name had already been used on old maps.

The discovery of gold in Brokopondo and Sipaliwini lead to the construction of the Lawa Railway and growth of the villages next to the railway line, and especially Kofi Djompo. The railway line was decommissioned in 1986.

The district&#x27;s capital, originally called &quot;Kofi Djompo&quot;, was renamed in 1905 for Dutch architect Cornelis Lely, who was responsible for many large construction projects in the Netherlands and was also governor of Suriname. Javanese immigration and the closeness to Paramaribo, have resulted in a partially suburban, and still partially agricultural district. The beginning of the 21st century have seen many building projects in the district.

Rice used to be the main crops grown in Wanica, but the late 20th century saw a shift towards animal husbandry. Fruit and vegetables are of lesser significance. Trade and businesses have increased, and are mainly located around Lelydorp. Lelydorp needs a clear city structure and has many agricultural areas close to the centre and neighbourhoods.

== Resorts ==

Wanica is divided into 7 resorts (&quot;ressorten&quot;):
* De Nieuwe Grond
* Domburg
* Houttuin
* Koewarasan
* Kwatta
* Lelydorp
* Saramacca Polder

== Villages ==
* Santigron

<doc id="684546" wikidata="Q7425796" url="?curid=684546" title="Sassy (magazine)">
<text>Sassy magazine was a general interest teen magazine aimed at young women. Now defunct, it covered a wide variety of topics, and was intended as a feminist counterpoint to &quot;Seventeen&quot; and &quot;YM&quot; magazines. &quot;Sassy&quot; existed between 1988 and 1996.

==History and profile==
The magazine was founded in March 1988 by an Australian feminist, Sandra Yates, CEO of Matilda Publications, who based it on the teen magazine &quot;Dolly&quot;.
Women Aglow, an evangelical women&#x27;s group, boycotted &quot;Sassy&quot; due to its content about sexuality immediately following its start.

==Editorial staff==
&quot;Sassy&quot;&#x27;s founding editor was Jane Pratt. The magazine&#x27;s original main writers were referred to by Pratt as &quot;Sex&quot; (Karen Catchpole), &quot;Drugs&quot; (Catherine Gysin), and &quot;Rock &#x27;n Roll&quot; (Christina Kelly) because of the topics they covered. Executive Editor Mary Kaye Schilling became Editor-in-Chief in 1990, when Pratt went on to host a daytime talk show. When Schilling left, Christina Kelly was promoted to Editor and remained in that position until the magazine&#x27;s end. Kelly hired Erin Smith of Bratmobile as her intern in 1991. The fashion department was headed by Mary Clarke, Jacinta Dobson, and Andrea Lee Linett, who discovered Chloë Sevigny on the street and hired her as an intern. The distinctive look of the magazine was created by Cheryl Collins, who had worked at Australia&#x27;s &quot;Dolly&quot;. When Collins left, Schilling hired Noel Claro to art direct the magazine.

==Publishers==
&quot;Sassy&quot; was first published in March 1988 in the United States by Matilda Publications with a circulation of 250,000. It was acquired by Lang Communications in October 1989, at which point its circulation was 450,000. Petersen Publishing officially took over with the February–March 1995 issue, and its editorial offices were moved to Los Angeles from New York City. It then stopped publishing as its own title in 1996, when editorial sections (and staff) of &quot;Sassy&quot; were absorbed into another magazine published by Petersen called &quot;`TEEN&quot; beginning with the January 1997 issue.

==&quot;Dirt&quot; magazine==

In 1992, &quot;Sassy&quot; spun off a short-lived title for teen boys called &quot;Dirt: Son of Sassy&quot;. It was created by Mark Lewman (words), Andy Jenkins (art direction) and Spike Jonze (photos), who went on to direct music videos and feature films. They were collectively known as &quot;the Master Cluster.&quot; According to Canadian author Douglas Coupland, &quot;&quot;Dirt&quot; was a funny and smart magazine for young people&quot;.

==Reader-produced issues==
&quot;Sassy&quot; anticipated &quot;crowd sourced&quot; content by over a decade, starting with their &quot;every single little thing in this issue is reader-produced&quot; December 1990 issue. Originally conceived by Alan Goodman&#x27;s and Fred Seibert&#x27;s Fred/Alan Inc., Sassy advertising agency.

==Sassiest Boy in America==
&quot;Sassy&quot; conducted an annual search for the Sassiest Girl in America, and in 1990, &quot;Sassy&quot; magazine conducted a search for the Sassiest Boy in America&quot;.&quot; Over 150 entries were received, with the eventual winner being Ian Svenonius of Nation of Ulysses. In the story highlighting his selection, Pratt states, &quot;He&#x27;s going to be a big deal. I&#x27;m sure he will be and we&#x27;re going to be so proud that we were the first ones to discover him.&quot; However, it was discovered that Svenonius wasn&#x27;t a &quot;boy&quot; at all, but rather lied about his age, as he was 22 at the time of his selection—too old, per contest rules. He was allowed to retain his title.

==Chia Pet==
&quot;Sassy&quot;&#x27;s in-house band was named after the Chia Pet, with various members from the editorial staff, including Jane Pratt on violin, Mary Kaye Schilling and Christina Kelly on vocals, Kelly&#x27;s then-husband Robert Weeks on guitar, her then-sister-in-law (and &quot;Sassy&quot; writer) Jessica Vitkus Weeks on bass guitar, Mary Ann Marshall (also a &quot;Sassy&quot; scribe) on drums. Karen Catchpole lent co-lead vocals to some songs including &quot;Hey Baby&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me Baby&quot;. The band once opened for The Lemonheads at iconic now-closed New York City rock club CBGB.

===Releases===

==Book: &quot;How &quot;Sassy&quot; Changed My Life&quot;==
In April 2007, Faber and Faber released a tribute to and history of &quot;Sassy&quot; by former &quot;Teen Vogue&quot; editor Kara Jesella and Marisa Meltzer called &quot;How &quot;Sassy&quot; Changed My Life: A Love Letter to the Greatest Teen Magazine of All Time&quot;. The book recounts the magazine&#x27;s rise and fall; its unusual appeal to both men and women, teenagers and adults; and its influence on mainstream as well as alternative women&#x27;s magazines. It includes interviews with staffers and fans.

<doc id="684547" wikidata="Q7152156" url="?curid=684547" title="Paul Magrs">
<text>Paul Magrs (pronounced &quot;Mars&quot;; born 12 November 1969) is an English writer and lecturer. He was born in Jarrow, England, and now lives in Manchester with his partner, author and lecturer Jeremy Hoad.

==Early life==
Magrs was born in Jarrow, Tyne &amp; Wear, on 12 November 1969. In 1975 he moved with his family to Newton Aycliffe, County Durham; his parents divorced shortly after the move. At the age of 17, Magrs was queer-bashed, and his father was the police officer who took the report on the incident; it was the last time Paul Magrs saw his father.

In Newton Aycliffe, Magrs attended Woodham Comprehensive School, where Mark Gatiss was two years ahead of him and in the same drama group. Magrs went on to Lancaster University, where he received a first class BA in English (1991), an MA in Creative Writing (1991) and a PhD in English (1995). His doctoral thesis was on Angela Carter.

==Literary career==
Magrs is the author of numerous fiction and non-fiction works. His first published writing was the short story &quot;Patient Iris&quot;, published 1995 in &quot;New Writing Four&quot; (edited by A. S. Byatt and Alan Hollinghurst). This was soon followed by his debut novel, &quot;Marked for Life&quot;, the same year. Magrs&#x27; first three novels, &quot;Marked for Life&quot;, &quot;Does It Show?&quot; (1997) and &quot;Could It Be Magic?&quot; (1998), share characters, a magical realist tone and a setting: the fictional Phoenix Court council estate in Newton Aycliffe.

Magrs&#x27; first children&#x27;s book, &quot;Strange Boy&quot; (2002), prompted controversy due to homosexual content involving its 10-year-old protagonist and a 14-year-old neighbour. Representatives of the NASUWT teachers&#x27; union and the conservative Christian Institute argued that the book should not be stocked in school libraries, and some newspapers suggested that doing so in England would be illegal due to the Section 28 ban on &quot;promoting homosexuality&quot; in schools. However, the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals supported libraries&#x27; purchase of &quot;Strange Boy&quot;, as did representatives of Stonewall and other gay rights organizations. Magrs noted that the book was &quot;about 95% autobiographical&quot; and described the controversy as &quot;ludicrous&quot;.

===Doctor Who===
Magrs has written several novels, short stories and audio dramas relating to &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, many of which also feature his character Iris Wildthyme.

Iris was initially portrayed as an eccentric and unreliable Time Lady, whose TARDIS takes the form of a London AEC Routemaster double-decker bus (the route 22 to Putney Common), though in a series of short story collections and novels not written for the BBC, the character has been repurposed to remove any copyrighted aspects. Iris Wildthyme was originally created for Magrs&#x27; unpublished first novel, which was named after her; another version of Iris also appears in &quot;Marked for Life&quot;. The character features in all of Magrs&#x27; three contributions to BBC Books&#x27; Eighth Doctor Adventures, in several Big Finish Productions audio dramas by Magrs and other writers, in a novel series from Snowbooks and in short story and novella collections published by Big Finish and Obverse Books.

Magrs has also written licensed &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction without Wildthyme, including the 2007 novel, &quot;Sick Building&quot;, (which made the shortlist for the Doncaster Book Award), a variety of audio plays for Big Finish and the BBC audio series, &quot;Hornets&#x27; Nest&quot;, which marked the first time Tom Baker had returned to play the Doctor in a full-length drama since he left the role in 1981. After the success of Hornets&#x27; Nest, Magrs wrote two sequel series &quot;Demon Quest&quot; (2010) and &quot;Serpent Crest&quot; (2011).

===The Brenda and Effie Mysteries===
Magrs&#x27; current ongoing novel series is &quot;The Brenda and Effie Mysteries&quot;, starring Brenda, the Bride of Frankenstein, who has now retired and runs a B&amp;B in Whitby. She and her friend Effie, a local white witch, investigate spooky goings-on in the town. , there have been nine books in the series, the latest being &quot;A Game of Crones&quot; from Snowbooks. The fourth book, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Belles&quot;, features characters from Magrs&#x27; early Phoenix Court books, while the fifth features characters from Magrs&#x27; &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio, &quot;The Boy That Time Forgot&quot;. A short story collection, &quot;A Treasury of Brenda and Effie&quot; (Obverse Books) and a seventh novel, &quot;Fellowship of Ink&quot; (snowbooks) were both released in 2017. An eighth novel, &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot;, was released in 2023 by Obverse Books.

The characters have also appeared in two audio adaptations: a 3-part series for BBC Radio 4, starring Joanna Tope and Monica Gibb, and then a series of award-winning audios from Bafflegab. These starred Anne Reid and included:

* 1. The Woman in a Black Beehive
* 2. Bat Out of Hull
* 3. Spicy Tea and Sympathy
* 4. Brenda Has Risen from the Grave

In 2020, it was announced Free@Last TV, who produced the Sky1/Acorn TV series &quot;Agatha Raisin&quot;, were developing a television series.

===Other novels===
Magrs&#x27; other novels include &quot;Aisles&quot; (2003) and &quot;To the Devil – a Diva!&quot; (2004); he has also published several short stories. His novel &quot;Exchange&quot; was shortlisted for the 2006 Booktrust Teenage Prize and was longlisted for the 2007 Carnegie Medal.

His young adult novel, &quot;The Ninnies&quot; was listed by the Irish Times as one of the children&#x27;s books of the year in 2012.

Later novels include two books about his cats, Fester and Bernard, &quot;The Story of Fester Cat&quot; and &quot;Welcome Home, Bernard Socks&quot;, a stand-alone novel, &quot;666 Charing Cross Road&quot; (), and a trilogy of novels about a frontier family on the planet Mars.

==Art==

* &quot;The Panda, the Cat and the Dreadful Teddy&quot;
* &quot;The Tale of Toxic Positivity&quot;
* &quot;Puss in Books&quot;

<doc id="684566" wikidata="Q13560783" url="?curid=684566" title="Jane Pratt">
<text>Jane Pratt (born November 11, 1962) is the founding editor of &quot;Sassy&quot;, &quot;Jane and&quot; xoJane. She is the host of the talk show &quot;Jane Radio&quot; on Sirius XM Radio.

==Early life==
Jane Pratt was born in San Francisco, California, to Sheila Marks Blake, an artist, and Vernon Pratt, a minimalist painter and professor of art at Duke University. Her mother grew up in Queens, New York, and her maternal grandfather, Joseph Marks, was a vice-president of the Doubleday publishing company. Her paternal grandfather was Gaither Pratt, a paranormal psychology researcher at the University of Virginia. Pratt&#x27;s parents were divorced when she was 13.

She was raised in Durham, North Carolina, and attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, at the age of 15. After graduating from Phillips Academy, Pratt enrolled at Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio, where she received a degree in communications with a minor in modern dance. Her publishing career began with internships at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine and &quot;Sportstyle,&quot; a Fairchild Publication. After graduating, Pratt landed her first job as assistant editor of &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, and in 1986, became an associate editor of &quot;Teenage Magazine&quot;. From there, she went on to found &quot;Sassy Magazine&quot;.

==Career==

===&quot;Sassy&quot;===

At the age of 24, Pratt became the founding editor of &quot;Sassy&quot;, a magazine for teenage girls. Under Pratt, the magazine experienced rapid circulation growth. The magazine released a limited-edition Sonic Youth flexi-disc (a cover of the New York Dolls song &quot;Personality Crisis&quot;). Band members Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon were fans of the teen magazine.

The magazine&#x27;s affinity for indie rock led to the formation of the band Chia Pet, which counted Sassy writer Christina Kelly and Pratt as members. Chia Pet released &quot;Blind Date&quot; on the Kokopop label in 1992, which won simultaneous Single of the Week honors in both &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;.

===Television and books===
The success of &quot;Sassy&quot; led Pratt to host a talk show on Fox in 1992, however, it was cancelled after only 13 weeks. The show moved to Lifetime in 1993 but only lasted 12 weeks due to low ratings.

Pratt was also a frequent contributor to VH-1 and &quot;Extra&quot;, where she was featured interviewing such personalities as Madonna, Michael Jackson, Michael Stipe of R.E.M., and Drew Barrymore.

Pratt is the author of two books, &quot;For Real: The Uncensored Truth About America&#x27;s Teenagers&quot; (Hyperion, September 1995) and &quot;Beyond Beauty: Girls Speak Out on Looks, Style and Stereotypes&quot;, which is published by Callaway Editions in association with Clarkson Potter.

===&quot;Jane&quot;===

After &quot;Sassy&quot; was bought by Los Angeles–based Peterson Publishing in 1994, the New York–based Pratt regrouped with several former &quot;Sassy&quot; staffers to form &quot;Jane&quot;, a lifestyle magazine for 18- to 34-year-old women which debuted three years later. Its first cover featured actress Drew Barrymore. Other colleagues have included singer Michael Stipe, whom she dated; director Spike Jonze, whom she hired as editor of short-lived teenage boy–targeted &quot;Dirt&quot; magazine; actress Chloë Sevigny, who was once a summer intern at &quot;Sassy&quot;; and Pamela Anderson, who wrote a regular monthly column for &quot;Jane&quot;.

&quot;Jane&quot; was nominated for a National Magazine Award for General Excellence by the American Society of Magazine Editors, and Pratt was named &quot;Editor of the Year&quot; in 2002 by &quot;Adweek&quot;.

On July 25, 2005, Pratt announced that she was resigning from her position as editor-in-chief of &quot;Jane&quot; and would be leaving the company on September 30, 2005, exactly eight years after its debut issue. Circulation had steadily increased since the magazine&#x27;s debut, with 700,000 readers as of the day Pratt announced she would be stepping down.

On July 9, 2007, Charles Townsend, president and CEO of Condé Nast Publications, announced that &quot;Jane&quot; magazine would cease publication with its August 2007 issue. The magazine&#x27;s website, janemag.com, was also to be shut down. &quot;This was a very difficult decision for us,&quot; Mr. Townsend said. &quot;We worked diligently to make &quot;Jane&quot; a success. However, we have come to believe that the magazine and website will not fulfill our long-term business expectations.&quot;

===xoJane===

In May 2011, Pratt launched women&#x27;s lifestyle site called xoJane. Pratt and collaborators describe the site as &quot; ...not snarky, but inclusive and uplifting, while remaining nothing but honest at all times. Like Sassy and Jane before it, xoJane.com is written by a group of women (and some token males) with strong voices, identities, and opinions, many in direct opposition to each other, who are living what they are writing about.&quot; According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, in less than two months from the launch date, xoJane.com established itself as one of the &quot;Top 10 Lifestyle Websites for Women.&quot; Pratt served as editor-in-chief with Emily McCombs as executive editor, Mandy Stadtmiller as editor-at-large, and Lesley Kinzel as deputy editor. She launched a British sister site, xojane.co.uk, in June 2012, with Rebecca Holman as editor.

xoJane and xoVain were acquired by Time Inc. from Pratt and SAY Media in 2015. In December 2016, Time indicated that it would be folding xoJane into &quot;InStyle&quot;, following reports that Pratt was leaving Time and looking for a new owner for her web properties.

As of 2017 xoJane content and articles are unavailable and the xoJane site redirects to HelloGiggles, a Time, Inc. property.

==Personal life==
Pratt and actor/writer Andrew Shaifer have a daughter, Charlotte Jane (born December 2002). She was pregnant with twins, due in the summer of 2005, but she miscarried both that April.

==In popular culture==
An episode of MTV animated series &quot;Daria&quot; parodied Pratt through the character of Val, youth-obsessed editor of &quot;Val&quot; magazine.

An episode of &quot;Girls&quot; featured a character with a similar appearance as Pratt named Jame, an editor of a confessional blog similar to a regular column on &quot;xoJane&quot;.

<doc id="684578" wikidata="Q738541" url="?curid=684578" title="1991–92 snooker world rankings">
<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first introduced a ranking system for professional players in 1976, with the aim of seeding players for the World Snooker Championship. The reigning champion would be automatically seeded first, the losing finalist from the previous year seeded second, and the other seedings based on the ranking list. Initially, the rankings were based on performances in the preceding three world championships. The 1983–84 snooker world rankings were the first to take tournaments other than the world championship into account and several additional tournaments were designated as ranking tournaments over the following years. The list for the 1986–87 snooker season was the first to only take account of results over two seasons and the rankings for 1991–92 were also based on results from the preceding two seasons. There were eighteen ranking events taken into consideration for the 1991–92 ranking list: ten in the 1989–90 snooker season and eight in the 1990–91 snooker season. The ranking list was published soon after the conclusion of the 1991 World Snooker Championship.

Stephen Hendry was ranked first, with 85 ranking points, ahead of Steve Davis with 57 and Jimmy White with 51. &quot;Snooker Scene&quot; magazine commented that Hendry&#x27;s lead was larger than the equivalent of four ranking tournament wins. Gary Wilkinson and Tony Jones were in the top 16, regarded as the elite of the game, for the first time. Wilkinson, runner-up at the 1991 British Open, rose from 19th to 5th and the 1991 European Open champion Jones moved from 35th to 15th. Tony Knowles regained a place in the top 16, while Willie Thorne, John Virgo and Tony Meo dropped out of it. 

Alan McManus at 41st and Ken Doherty at 51st were the highest placed of those who had been on the professional circuit for only one season. Alex Higgins had 25 ranking points deducted from his 1989–90 total and was banned for the 1990–91 season by the WPBSA following a disciplinary inquiry. He fell from 97th to 120th. There were 165 players on the original list issued by the WBPSA, but four players who did not pay their membership fees were subsequently excluded: Jimmy van Rensberg (originally 119th), Patsy Fagan (originally 146th), Mike Hines (originally 159th) and Frank Jonik (originally 160th).

== Points tariff and basis of ranking==
Ranking was determined as follows:
*By number of ranking points.
*If players had an equal number of ranking points, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, merit points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, A points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, frames won were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given the player with the better performances in the later season.

==Rankings==
Key:
*&quot;(New)&quot; denotes a player that was a new professional for 1990–91; &quot;*&quot; denotes that the player was not a professional during the season.
*&quot;X&quot; denotes that the player was banned from competing in the 1990–91 season.

Note: the breakdown of points per season for players ranked below 64 is not provided in sources. Blank cells indicate that the information is not provided in sources for the ranking list.

<text>The Battle of Mirbat (19 July 1972) was an attack by Communist guerrillas targeting an Omani government position during the Dhofar Rebellion in the town of Mirbat, Oman. During the Dhofar Rebellion, Britain assisted the Omani government, an absolute monarchy, by sending elements of its Special Air Service (SAS) both to train soldiers and fight against the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG) guerrillas, also known as the Adoo. The assault was defeated after the arrival of several BAC Strikemaster attack aircraft belonging to Oman, firing rockets at PFLOAG&#x27;s positions which forced the guerrillas to retreat. After the battle the British and their allies recovered the corpses of the attacking guerrillas, some were put on public display as a tool of terror, to act as warnings to potential left-wing rebels who were tempted to join the rebellion against Oman&#x27;s government.

== Background ==
In 1963 a revolution began in Oman which sought to topple the government of the Sultunate of Muscat and Oman, which was backed by the United Kingdom. During the revolution, a communist guerrilla organisation was founded in 1968 called the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Occupied Arabian Gulf (PFLOAG), whom were also known as the &quot;Adoo&quot;. The Adoo sought to establish an independent and democratic republic with a socialist economy.

== Battle ==
At 6am on 19 July 1972 the PFLOAG attacked the British Army Training Team (BATT) house based just outside the Port of Mirbat which housed nine SAS soldiers. The PFLOAG (locally known as the Adoo) attacked the SAS BATT house knowing that to be able to reach the Port of Mirbat they would first have to defeat the SAS guarding the approach to the town in Jebel Ali, a series of small desert slopes leading to the Port.

The Officer in Command, Captain Mike Kealy, observed the waves advancing on the fort, but at first did not order his men to open fire because he thought it was the &quot;Night Picket&quot; coming back from night shift. The Night Picket were soldiers from the Omani Army positioned on the slopes to warn the BATT house of Adoo troop movements. Realising that the Night Picket must have been killed, Kealy ordered his men to open fire. Kealy and other members of the team took up positions behind the sand-bag parapet on the roof of the BATT house, firing at the Adoo with L1A1 SLR battle rifles, with one man firing the Browning M2HB heavy machine gun, with a further two men on ground level operating and firing an infantry mortar surrounded by sand-bags. The Adoo were armed with AK-47 assault rifles, and were mortar bombing the area around the BATT house. Kealy ordered the signaller to establish communications with SAS Headquarters at Um al Quarif, to request reinforcements.

There were also a small number of Omani Intelligence Service personnel in the BATT House, a small contingent of Pakistani soldiers and a member of British Military Intelligence seconded to the OIS. They joined the team on the roof and fired on the Adoo with SLRs and other small arms. Initially some of the Pakistani soldiers were reluctant to join the defence of the fort because their roles with the BATT were largely administrative, but they obeyed orders from Mike Kealy and the British Military Intelligence Corporal.
Knowing that the SLRs would not be of full use until the Adoo were closer than the weapon&#x27;s range of 800 metres, and lacking heavier firepower, Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba made a run for the 25 Pounder Artillery Piece, which was positioned next to a smaller fort manned by nine Omani Army Special Forces soldiers, who had not played a part in the battle. The Omani policeman who was guarding the weapon had been seriously wounded. Talaiasi Labalaba managed to operate the weapon, which is a six-man job, by himself and fire a round a minute at the approaching Adoo, directing their attention away from the BATT house. Kealy received a radio message from Talaiasi reporting that a bullet had hit his face, he was badly injured, and was struggling to operate the gun on his own. At the BATT house Kealy asked for a volunteer to run to Talaiasi&#x27;s aid. Trooper Sekonaia Takavesi volunteered to go.

Sekonaia Takavesi ran from the BATT house, with the remaining men providing covering fire, in an attempt to distract the Adoo. Sekonaia ran the 800 metres through heavy gunfire, and reached the gun emplacement. Sekonaia tried to give aid to his injured friend, while firing at the approaching Adoo with his personal weapon. Realising that they needed help, Sekonaia tried to raise the small number of Omani soldiers inside the smaller fort, and Walid Khamis emerged. The remaining Omani soldiers in the fort engaged the enemy with small arms fire from firing positions on the roof and through the windows of the fort. As the two men made it back to the emplacement, the Omani soldier fell wounded after being shot in the stomach with a 7.62 mm bullet. Adoo continued to advance upon both the BATT house and the artillery emplacement. At one point, the Adoo were so close that Sekonaia and Talaiasi fired the weapon at point blank range, aiming down the barrel. Talaiasi crawled across a small space to reach a 60 mm Infantry Mortar, but fell dead after being shot in the neck. Sekonaia, also shot through the shoulder and grazed by a bullet to the back of his head, continued to fire at the approaching Adoo with his personal weapon. The squad signaller sent messages through to the main Forward Operating Base, to request air support and medical evacuation for the men in the gun emplacement.
Captain Kealy and Trooper Tobin made a run to the artillery piece. Upon reaching it, they dived in to avoid increasingly intense gunfire from the Adoo. Sekonaia continued to fire on the attackers, propped up against sand bags after being shot through the stomach (the bullet narrowly missing his spine). The Adoo threw several hand grenades, but only one detonated, exploding behind the emplacement with no one injured. During the battle, Trooper Tobin attempted to reach over the body of Talaiasi. In so doing, Tobin was mortally wounded when a bullet struck his face. By this time, BAC Strikemaster light-attack jets of the Sultan of Oman&#x27;s Air Force had arrived and began strafing the Adoo in the Jebel Ali. With a low cloud base making for low-altitude attack runs, only machine-guns and light rockets were used. One of the Strikemasters was sufficiently damaged by Adoo fire that it had to return to base before using up all its weapons. Reinforcements arrived from G Squadron and, defeated, the PFLOAG withdrew at about 12:30. All wounded SAS troopers were evacuated, and given medical treatment. Trooper Tobin eventually died in hospital, directly to the gunshot wound to his face.

==Aftermath==
===25-pounder gun===
The 25-pounder gun (now known as the &quot;Mirbat gun&quot;) used by Fijian Sergeant Talaiasi Labalaba during the siege is now housed in the Firepower museum of the Royal Artillery at the former Royal Arsenal, Woolwich. Before being killed in action, Sgt Labalaba singlehandedly operated the 25-pounder gun, a weapon normally requiring four to six soldiers to operate. Labalaba&#x27;s actions were a key factor in halting the Adoo&#x27;s assault on the emplacement, allowing time for reinforcements to arrive. Labalaba was posthumously awarded a Mention in Dispatches for his actions during the Battle of Mirbat, though some of his comrades have since campaigned for him to be awarded the more prestigious Victoria Cross.

===Public display of corpses===
After the battle the Omani and British managed to recover the corpses of 38 PFLOAG (Adoo) guerrillas who had attacked Mirbat. Some of these corpses were taken to be put on public display and used as tools of terror and act as warnings to anyone who would resist the Sultan.

===British medals and awards===
Kealy received the Distinguished Service Order, Takavesi the Distinguished Conduct Medal, Bennett and Taylor the Military Medal. These were announced three years after the event. An Omani from the fort, Walid Khamis, was injured during the battle and received the Sultan&#x27;s Gallantry Medal - Oman&#x27;s highest award. The British Military Intelligence Corporal received a medal for gallantry from the Sultan (for this action and others), but was threatened with disciplinary action by the British Army for being directly involved in the action at Mirbat.

===Controversies===
Although only 38 bodies of the attacking PFLOAG guerrillas were recovered, some reports considered that the number of PFLOAG casualties was likely to have been as high as 200, but John Newsinger, a British Marxist and a member of the Socialist Workers Party, claimed in his 2015 book &#x27;British Counterinsurgency&#x27; that official reports greatly exaggerated both the role of the SAS and the greater effects of the battle. Newsinger argued that the battle was used by the British as an ideological tool to mythologise the SAS, validate British manhood, and to save face during the decline of the British Empire.

==In popular culture==
* Sir Ranulph Fiennes alleged in his book &quot;The Feather Men&quot; that Mike Kealy was murdered years later in the Brecon Beacons by an Arab militant cell. However, the circumstances of Kealy&#x27;s death suggest that this is somewhat fanciful, as he was seen by other service personnel undergoing the same SAS endurance exercise only a few hours beforehand in deteriorating weather conditions, and was in fact found alive (but in poor condition) by a two-man search party, one of whom stayed with him and attempted to keep him warm. It was later acknowledged by the Coroner that one of the major contributory factors to his death was the delay of some 19 hours in recovering him from the hillside. Subsequently, the author admitted the book was fiction and that no such assassinations ever took place.
* The battle is briefly depicted in the 2011 film &quot;Killer Elite&quot;, where it is central to the plot. The film is based on Fiennes&#x27; fictional book.
* The battle is also mentioned by Frederick Forsyth in his book &quot;The Veteran&quot;, where a member of the SAS team is murdered by two criminals 30 years after the engagement.
* The battle is referred to in Chris Ryan&#x27;s &quot;Land of Fire&quot;, but is called &quot;The Battle of Merbak&quot;, the Adoo are numbered in the thousands and Laba is replaced by a character called Tom who is wounded but lives.
* The battle is described in Rowland White&#x27;s &quot;Storm Front&quot;.
* The battle is also used as inspiration in the 2018 short film &quot;The Daycare&quot;.

<doc id="684590" wikidata="Q950662" url="?curid=684590" title="Neal Foulds">
<text>Neal Foulds (born 13 July 1963) is an English former professional snooker player and six-time tournament winner, including the 1986 International Open, the 1988 Dubai Masters and the 1992 Scottish Masters, as well as the invitational Pot Black in 1992. He was runner-up at the 1986 UK Championship and the 1987 British Open, and reached the semi-finals of three Masters tournaments and the 1987 World Championship. After his retirement, Foulds became a commentator for the BBC and is currently part of the presenting team for ITV and Eurosport.

==Career==
The son of snooker professional Geoff Foulds, he began playing the game at the age of 11 and by the early 1980s was already one of the strongest players in his area. Following victory in the national under-19&#x27;s Championship beating John Parrott in the final, Foulds then turned professional in 1983.

At the end of the season he qualified for the final stages of the World Championship at his first attempt. Even more impressively however, he then defeated twice-champion Alex Higgins 10–9 in the first round before going down 13–9 to Doug Mountjoy in the last 16, a run that saw him enter the rankings at number 30.

Foulds quickly climbed the rankings in the seasons that followed reaching no. 3 within four years. He won his first ranking tournament in 1986, the BCE International, beating Cliff Thorburn 12–9 in the final. In the same season he was runner-up to Steve Davis in the UK Championship, and he also reached the semi-finals of the 1987 World Championship, losing 16–9 to Joe Johnson.
Starting the following season in a career high position of number three, 1987/88 was not to be quite as successful, though another strong run to the quarter-finals in the 1988 World Snooker Championship before losing to Terry Griffiths ensured that he would retain his spot at third in the rankings. Foulds also won the 1988 Dubai Masters, beating Steve Davis in the final, though this event would not hold any ranking points until the following year.

From here however he started to struggle, dropping 17 places to 20th in the rankings and finding himself having to qualify for events the following season. Still, 1989/90 was to see a revival and despite a round one exit at the World Championship to Wayne Jones, he did enough to regain a place in the top 16 before moving up to number seven at the end of 1990/1.

In 1992, Foulds was crowned the Scottish Masters champion and also won the 1992 edition of Pot Black, beating Nigel Bond, Jimmy White, and Gary Wilkinson en route to the final, where he beat James Wattana 252–176 on a points based final.

Though he was able to maintain a top 16 place until the end of the 1993/4 season, and a place on the tour until 2003, he played his final match as a Main Tour player on 13 January 2003 before retiring from competitive play aged 39.

Foulds made a brief reappearance as a player in November 2011 in the World Seniors (aged 48) before eventually losing to Dene O&#x27;Kane.

Foulds made 88 competitive century breaks in his career.

==Commentary career==
Since his retirement, Foulds has moved up to the commentary box for Eurosport, BBC, Sky Sports and he also co-hosts all ITV4 tournament coverage, interviewing players as well as commentating. In 2014, Foulds made a cameo as himself commentating on a fictional match at the climax of the snooker short film drama &quot;Extended Rest&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Foulds is married and has a son and a daughter. He supports Queens Park Rangers.

<text>codice_1 (standing for &quot;Internet Protocol configuration&quot;) is a console application program of some computer operating systems that displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings.

==Implementations==
The command is available in Microsoft Windows, ReactOS, and in Apple macOS. The ReactOS version was developed by Ged Murphy and is licensed under the GPL.

===Microsoft Windows, ReactOS===
The codice_1 command supports the command-line switch codice_3. This results in more detailed information than codice_1 alone.

An important additional feature of codice_1 is to force refreshing of the DHCP IP address of the host computer to request a different IP address. This is done using two commands in sequence. First, codice_6 is executed to force the client to immediately give up its lease by sending the server a DHCP release notification which updates the server&#x27;s status information and marks the old client&#x27;s IP address as &quot;available&quot;. Then, the command codice_7 is executed to request a new IP address. Where a computer is connected to a cable or DSL modem, it may have to be plugged directly into the modem network port to bypass the router, before using codice_6 and turning off the power for a period of time, to ensure that the old IP address is taken by another computer.

The codice_9 parameter can be used to clear the Domain Name System (DNS) cache to ensure future requests use fresh DNS information by forcing hostnames to be resolved again from scratch.)

===Apple macOS===
codice_1 in Mac OS X serves as a wrapper to the IPConfiguration agent, and can be used to control the Bootstrap Protocol and DHCP client from the command-line interface. For example, you can release and renew an IP address if it happened to be assigned incorrectly by the DHCP server during the automated assignment process. Like most Unix-based operating systems, Mac OS X also uses codice_11 for more direct control over network interfaces, such as configuring static IP addresses. The Ifconfig command in Linux has been replaced by the IP command

<doc id="684624" wikidata="Q6845594" url="?curid=684624" title="Mikael Colville-Andersen">
<text>Mikael Colville-Andersen is a Canadian-Danish urban designer and urban mobility expert. He was the CEO of Copenhagenize Design Company, which he founded in 2009 in Copenhagen, and he works with cities and governments around the world in coaching them towards becoming more bicycle-friendly. He is the host of the urbanism documentary television series &quot;The Life-Sized City&quot;, which premiered in 2017 on TVOntario and in 2018 on various other international channels including Finland&#x27;s national broadcaster YLE and Italian broadcaster La Effe. Season 1 of &quot;The Life-Sized City&quot; was nominated for five Canadian Screen Awards in 2018.

==Career==

Colville-Andersen is known for his philosophy about simplifying urban planning and urban cycling and how cities should be designed instead of engineered. He is at the forefront of utilising observational techniques inspired by the likes of William H. Whyte for pedestrian and bicycle planning and has been called &quot;the Modern Day Jane Jacobs&quot;. He employs anthropology and sociology in his work to develop liveable cities and, in 2012, he spearheaded the largest study of cyclist behaviour ever undertaken – &quot;The Choreography of an Urban Intersection&quot; – tracking the desire lines of 16,631 cyclists through an intersection in Copenhagen over a 12-hour period.

His approach and philosophy have led to him being referred to as &quot;the Richard Dawkins of cycling&quot; by Peter Walker of &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2014 interview with Esquire magazine, &quot;the Pope of urban cycling&quot; by Canadian newspaper &quot;La Presse&quot; and Austrian newspaper Der Standard, among others and &quot;the Bieber of urban cycling&quot; in an interview with Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Colville-Andersen has been instrumental in orchestrating the global bicycle boom, starting with what was later called &quot;the Photo That Launched a Million Bicycles&quot; in 2006, which led to the Copenhagen Cycle Chic photography and streetstyle blog in 2007. Regarding his early work with the Cycle Chic movement, The Guardian dubbed him &quot;The Sartorialist on Two Wheels&quot;.

He coined the phrase cycle chic in 2007, as well as the word &quot;Copenhagenize&quot; in the same year. He has also coined and popularised other phrases such as &quot;Bicycle Urbanism&quot;, &quot;Viking Biking&quot;, &quot;Citizen Cyclist&quot; and he started The Slow Bicycle Movement in 2008.

Before embarking on a career as an urban designer, he was a film director and screenwriter. His debut feature film, &quot;Zakka West&quot; (2003), was the first indie film in Denmark and premiered at the Copenhagen International Film Festival. He has written and directed several short films, including the award-winning short &quot;Breaking Up&quot; (1999), and founded the first pan-European organisation for screenwriters – &quot;Euroscreenwriters&quot; – in 1997.

As producer for The Danish Broadcasting Corporation (DR) bicentenary website for Hans Christian Andersen, he and his team won the Prix Italia award at the Radiotelevisione Italiana 57th Prix Italia for Best Public Service Website.

In 2013, he appeared in Edinburgh to help celebrate that city&#x27;s Bike Week.

In 2014, he was cited as one of the influential urban planners suggesting that radical solutions were needed if improvement was to be seen in respect to congestion problems in the city of York. He has also explained that cycle parking is needed for cities to be cycle-friendly. He was booked as a keynote speaker at the Velo-city Global conference in Adelaide in May 2014.

== Volunteer work in Ukraine ==
In May 2022, Colville-Andersen founded a non-profit organization &quot;Bikes4Ukraine&quot;. The organization&#x27;s first goal was to deliver bicycles to help uncongest Lviv&#x27;s public transportation. The city had had accepted over 200 000 refugees since the start of the 2022 Russian invasion, which put a strain on public transit. Local urban planners contacted Colville-Andersen to suggest the bicycle solution which lead to the founding of the organization. On 3 July 2022, the first bicycle donation event took place in Copenhagen. By the end of that day, the organization received over 100 bicycles, which were sent to 3 Ukrainian cities: Lviv, Bucha and Chernihiv. As of early 2024, &quot;Bikes4Ukraine&quot; has delivered over 1000 bikes to over 35 cities and towns in Ukraine.

In January 2024, Colville-Andersen announced he is designing a Nordic-style trauma-informed therapy garden for people suffering from PTSD in Kyiv. The project is expected to be finished by June 2024. The initial site for the garden was located in the Podil neighbourhood, however, it was changed to be in the northern part of park, near a psychiatric hospital. Colville-Andersen&#x27;s team plans to work together with the hospital&#x27;s staff to create a learning hub for mental health professionals from all over the country. The project in Kyiv is a pilot one, Colville-Andersen has confirmed he and his team have early-stage plans for building more gardens like these in Lviv and Mykolaiv.

<doc id="684626" wikidata="Q2306959" url="?curid=684626" title="Operation Spanner">
<text>Operation Spanner was a police investigation into same-sex male sadomasochism across the United Kingdom in the late 1980s. The investigation, led by the Obscene Publications Squad of the Metropolitan Police, began in 1987 and ran for three years, during which approximately 100 gay and bisexual men were questioned by police.

The investigation culminated in a report naming 43 individuals, of whom the Director of Public Prosecutions chose to prosecute 16 men for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, unlawful wounding and other offences related to consensual, private sadomasochistic sex sessions held in various locations between 1978 and 1987.

A resulting House of Lords judgement, &quot;R v Brown&quot;, ruled that consent was not a valid legal defence for actual bodily harm in Britain.

The case sparked a national conversation about the limits of consent and the role of government in sexual encounters between consenting adults. It also spawned two activist organisations dedicated to promoting the rights of sadomasochists: Countdown on Spanner and The Sexual Freedom Coalition, and an annual SM Pride March through Central London. In 1996, Countdown on Spanner received the Large Nonprofit Organization of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards.

== Background ==

=== Attitudes to homosexuality ===
The 1980s was a period of rising negative sentiments towards homosexuality in Britain, peaking in 1987 when the British Social Attitudes Survey found that 75% of the population thought that homosexual activity was always or mostly wrong. That year, a high-profile public information campaign &quot;Don&#x27;t Die of Ignorance&quot; saw the delivery of an educational leaflet about HIV/AIDS to every household in Britain. The association of gay and bisexual men with the AIDS pandemic worsened their stigmatisation.
The Conservative Party under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher made opposition to LGBT education a pillar of its 1987 general election campaign, issuing posters accusing the Labour Party of promoting the book &quot;Young, Gay and Proud&quot; in British schools. At that year&#x27;s Conservative Party Conference, Thatcher warned that children were being taught &quot;that they have an inalienable right to be gay&quot;.

=== Policing and the law ===
In 1988, Section 28 of the Local Government Act prohibited local authorities from &quot;intentionally promoting homosexuality&quot;. The measure received broad support from Conservative MPs including Peter Bruinvels, who commented that &quot;Clause 28 will help outlaw [homosexuality] and the rest will be done by AIDS&quot;. In the years that followed, further legislation was proposed to discriminate against LGBT foster carers and to increase the penalties for cruising.

Although male homosexuality had been partially decriminalised in England and Wales in 1967, the offence of gross indecency was still widely used to criminalise sexual activity between men. An investigation by &quot;Gay Times&quot; found that police in England and Wales recorded 2,022 such offences in 1989, the highest rate since decriminalisation. That year, 30% of all convictions for sexual offences in England and Wales concerned consensual gay sex, with such prosecutions costing the government £12 million, and the resulting prison terms an estimated £5.5 million.

=== The Obscene Publications Squad ===
The Obscene Publications Squad was a branch of the Metropolitan Police tasked with enforcing obscenity law, most notably the Obscene Publications Act 1959, which forbade the distribution of any article that &quot;[tended] to deprave and corrupt&quot; those who encountered it.

In 1976, following a three-year internal inquiry, it was revealed that the squad had been running a protection racket over the Soho sex industry for at least two decades, with Detective Superintendent William Moody alone receiving an estimated £25,000 a year in bribes. Prosecutors described a systemically corrupt organisation in which new recruits were coerced into attending &#x27;Friday night shareouts&#x27;, during which officers would be taken one by one into a store room at Scotland Yard and handed cash. Over the next two years, 13 officers were jailed, earning the Obscene Publications Squad its nickname: The Dirty Squad.

In the wake of the scandal, officers of the Obscene Publications Squad were limited to two years of service, later extended to three, in an effort to combat corruption. The reformed squad allied itself with the socially conservative campaign group National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association and its controversial founder Mary Whitehouse, with the head of the squad becoming an annual speaker at Whitehouse&#x27;s fringe meeting at the Conservative Party Conference throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The squad gained significant notoriety during this period for its role in the &#x27;video nasties&#x27; moral panic—during which its officers raided video rental shops and seized horror films such as &quot;Evil Dead II&quot; and &quot;The Driller Killer&quot;—as well as a crackdown on gay pornography. Its critics accused it of having a Christian fundamentalist agenda, while the Lesbian and Gay Policing Association said its activities &quot;damaged relations&quot; between the LGBT community and the police.

== Investigation ==
In October 1987, Greater Manchester Police acquired a videotape, codenamed &#x27;KL7&#x27;, depicting consensual sadomasochistic sexual activity between a group of men, including a sequence in which one man passed a nail through a piercing in another man&#x27;s foreskin and hammered it into a block of wood, before making a series of incisions into the man&#x27;s penis with a scalpel.

Greater Manchester Police launched an investigation into the KL7 tape and began looking for the men featured in the video. Their enquiries expanded as further tapes featuring whipping, spanking and wax play were seized, eventually leading to the involvement of sixteen police forces including West Mercia Police and West Yorkshire Police. A meeting was held to discuss the organisational structure of the expanded probe, and it was decided that the Obscene Publications Squad of the Metropolitan Police should lead the investigation, now called Operation Spanner.

On 4 November 1987, raids were carried out at the homes of men in Bolton, Shrewsbury and Shropshire. At the Shropshire address, sniffer dogs were taken around the property&#x27;s garden, with police claiming to have reason to think that individuals may have been killed during the making of the tapes. Activists and defence lawyers later questioned the likelihood of the men&#x27;s consensual home sex videos being mistaken for snuff films, leading Detective Superintendent Michael Hames of the Obscene Publications Squad to admit that he could not explain how such an error could have been made. Nonetheless, he later insisted, &quot;such reckless and escalating violence, left unchecked, was bound to lead to someone getting killed&quot;.

Those interviewed during the raids described a loose knit circle of men who met through advertisements in gay contact magazines and gathered regularly in various locations for sadomasochistic sex sessions, some of which were recorded to video and shared among the group. Most cooperated fully with the police&#x27;s enquiries, acknowledging their involvement in the group and identifying themselves on the seized tapes, unaware that they may have broken the law.

Further raids were carried out on 10 November in Pontypridd, where a large quantity of sadomasochistic paraphernalia was seized, and on 11 November in Birmingham. The same day, the offices of the gay magazine &quot;Sir&quot; were raided. Other contact magazines including Gay Galaxy and Corporal Contacts were also raided during the course of the investigation. Two further raids were carried out on 16 November, at homes in Welwyn Garden City and Hampstead.

That month, the first reports of the investigation appeared in the gay press. One man questioned by police in relation to Operation Spanner told &quot;Him&quot; magazine that officers were working from a diary seized during an earlier raid, and had mentioned snuff films in the course of their questioning. An officer with Greater Manchester Police denied that the operation was related to snuff films but went on to falsely speculate that the investigation may be connected to an unsolved 1985 murder in Leeds.

By the beginning of 1988, police still did not know the identities of the two men on the KL7 tape, despite having unknowingly interviewed the man who filmed the scene the previous November. Though no faces were visible on the tape, the Obscene Publications Squad attempted to identify one of the men by a distinctive joint deformity on the index finger of his left hand, distributing a still image of the finger to police forces across the UK.
On 29 March, an officer with Hampshire Constabulary reported that he had spotted the man on that week&#x27;s episode of &quot;Panorama&quot;. Detectives consulted a recording of the episode and recognised their suspect in a sequence depicting a &quot;special service of blessing&quot; performed by a Church of England reverend for a gay couple. The man&#x27;s joint deformity was visible in a close-up shot of his partner placing a ring onto his finger. A week later, on 7 April, police interviewed the man at a cafe in Evesham, and proceeded to search his home. He identified the other man on the KL7 tape, and a raid was carried out on that man&#x27;s Broadway home the same day.

As the case began to come together, reporters were briefed that Operation Spanner &quot;could be dealt with at the Old Bailey&quot;, prompting speculation that indictable-only offences would be brought against the men. The Obscene Publications Squad continued to build their case throughout 1989, even as the Metropolitan Police sought to replace the head of the squad, Detective Superintendent Leslie Bennett, after he was found to have used the Police National Computer to look up the license plate of his ex-wife&#x27;s new partner.

Over the course of the investigation, in excess of 400 videotapes were seized, though a large number of these were commercial releases, and in some cases non-pornographic. The cost of the investigation was estimated at £2.5 million. Police were unable to find any participants who had not consented to the activities which took place, nor any who sustained lasting injuries.

In September 1989, sixteen men were charged with more than 100 offences including assault occasioning actual bodily harm and unlawful wounding. Several were charged with aiding and abetting assaults against themselves, charges which the Crown Prosecution Service said were &quot;rare, except in cases where injuries were allegedly inflicted for a false insurance claim&quot;. In addition, one man was charged with bestiality and two were charged in relation to an indecent photograph of a child.

== Trials ==

=== Magistrates&#x27; Court ===
On 9 October 1989, the men appeared before Camberwell Magistrates&#x27; Court to face the charges against them. They were remanded to reappear at Lambeth Magistrates&#x27; Court on 20 November.

The charges brought against the men included conspiracy charges, which as indictable-only offences can only be heard in Crown Court, so the case was referred to the Old Bailey. The fact that these charges were later dropped led to accusations that the government viewed the trial as a test case, and intentionally sought to have it heard in Crown Court, where legal precedent could be set in the event of a guilty verdict.

=== Old Bailey ===

The trial at the Old Bailey began on 29 October 1990 before Judge James Rant. The judge heard legal arguments from some of the accused that they could not be guilty because everyone involved had consented to what took place. However, Judge Rant rejected the argument and ruled that consent was not a defence, commenting that &quot;people must sometimes be protected from themselves&quot;.

His decision relied heavily on &quot;R v Coney&quot;, an 1882 case in which participants in a bare-knuckle boxing match were found guilty of assault despite their consent to take part, and &quot;R v Donovan&quot;, a 1934 case in which a man was convicted of assault for caning a woman with her consent. After Judge Rant&#x27;s ruling, the defendants changed their pleas to guilty, and were convicted on 7 November.

The remainder of the trial was dedicated to sentencing. Beginning on 11 December 1990, prosecutor Michael Worsley QC detailed the defendants&#x27; behaviour, which he characterised as &quot;brute homosexual activity in sinister circumstances, about as far removed as can be imagined from the concept of human love&quot;. He explained that the state&#x27;s evidence came not only from the men&#x27;s own testimony, but also the many home videos seized during the investigation, though he conceded that these tapes had not been intended for distribution.

He described a group whose &quot;nucleus&quot; of key members &quot;corrupted&quot; others into attending &quot;sessions of violence&quot;, where sadistic &quot;masters&quot; assaulted submissive &quot;victims&quot;. Despite criticism that this framing misrepresented the nature of sadomasochism, his words were echoed in the press, with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; branding the group a &quot;torture vice gang&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; identifying the &quot;leaders of [a] vicious and perverted sex gang&quot;.

Meanwhile, the defence argued for the consideration of a number of mitigating factors, including the fact that all those involved had consented to what took place, that they were all above the age of consent, and that none had at any time sought or required medical treatment.

Anna Worrall QC, representing one of the defendants, objected to a number of points raised by the prosecution, including the HIV status of some of the men, and the fact that police had taken sniffer dogs to the Shropshire raid, supposedly to search for buried bodies. She warned that &quot;the world&#x27;s press is listening to this&quot; and that sensationalist reporting might &quot;increase the punishment&quot; of the defendants. Both details were indeed widely reported, with &quot;The Independent&quot; noting the men&#x27;s HIV statuses in an article by Nick Cohen.

Also widely reported was Judge Rant&#x27;s &quot;horror&quot; at having to watch the videotapes admitted into evidence. He requested an adjournment after going &quot;white in the face&quot; during one viewing, and responded to a question about a sequence from the KL7 tape by saying, &quot;I am not likely to have forgotten that film. I don&#x27;t think any of us is likely to forget that particular film&quot;.

At the end of the first day of the sentencing hearing, one of the defendants was hospitalised with broken wrists after allegedly being pushed to the ground and kicked by press photographers as he left the court.

Two days before Judge Rant was due to sentence the men, Detective Superintendent Michael Hames, head of the Obscene Publications Squad, published an article in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; in which he called the defendants &quot;the most horrific porn ring ever to appear before a British court&quot;. The National Campaign for the Reform of the Obscene Publications Acts called the article &quot;heavily propagandist&quot; and filed an official complaint against Hames.

On 19 December, Judge Rant sentenced the men, handing down eight prison sentences of between 12 months and years. Passing the judgement, he said:
=== Court of Appeal ===
Five of the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeal in February 1992. Three judges, headed by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Lane, upheld the men&#x27;s convictions, ruling that their consent to the activities involved was &quot;immaterial&quot;. However, Lord Lane acknowledged that the men did not appreciate that their acts were criminal, and therefore reduced five of the prison sentences handed down by Judge Rant, cutting the longest down to six months.

Lord Lane granted the men leave to appeal to the House of Lords, which at the time was the UK&#x27;s highest court of appeal, saying there was a &quot;general public importance&quot; in settling the question of whether the prosecution must prove that a victim did not consent before it could obtain a conviction for assault or wounding.

=== House of Lords ===

In March 1993, the five defendants appealed their case to the House of Lords. Ann Mallalieu QC, for the defence, argued that interfering in the private lives of consenting adults was justified only in cases where &quot;private activity spills over into the public domain with adverse effects&quot;.

She went on to list several reasons why the case should not have been brought to trial, including the fact that no complaint was ever made to police, no serious or permanent injuries resulted from the activities, and participation in the acts was controlled, and limited to those wishing to take part.

The appeal was dismissed by a 3–2 majority of the Lords, with Lord Templeman declaring that:
=== European Court of Human Rights ===

In February 1997, three of the defendants took their case before the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, arguing that their convictions had violated their right to &quot;respect for their private lives through the expression of their sexual personality&quot; as guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. In a landmark ruling, nine judges upheld that the laws under which the men were convicted were &quot;necessary in a democratic society for the protection of health&quot;. The ruling followed pleas by the British government for the European Court to give greater consideration to individual nations&#x27; particular social mores.

== Reaction and aftermath ==
There was immediate criticism of the investigation and trial in 1990, with the Gay London Policing Group describing the sentences as &quot;outrageous&quot; and Andrew Puddephat, general secretary of Liberty, calling for a &quot;right to privacy enshrined in law&quot;. Keir Starmer said the judiciary had &quot;effectively imposed its morality on others&quot; and argued the &quot;unrepresentative make-up of the judiciary makes it ill-equipped to do this&quot;. The Pink Paper branded the case a homophobic &quot;show trial&quot; designed to &quot;get a clear ruling on the illegality of S&amp;M sex, especially amongst gay men&quot;.
On 16 February 1991, an estimated 5,000 people marched through Central London to protest the outcome of the Spanner trial, as well as the proposed Clause 25 of the Criminal Justice Bill, which would have raised the penalties for cruising and cottaging. On 13 April, thousands more protested the same issues at the Liberation &#x27;91 march in Manchester.

In August 1992, the campaign group Countdown on Spanner was formed in an effort to reverse the Court of Appeal ruling, and &quot;demand the recognition that sadomasochism is a valid, sensual and legitimate part of human sexuality&quot;. The following month, it began publishing the newsletter Spanner People, and staged a public demonstration calling on Detective Superintendent Michael Hames, head of the Obscene Publications Squad, to resign. In 1996 Countdown on Spanner received the Large Nonprofit Organization of the Year award as part of the Pantheon of Leather Awards. 

On 28 November, the inaugural SM Pride parade was held, with more than 700 people marching through Central London.

In 1995, the Spanner Trust was established to provide assistance to the Spanner defendants, lobby for a change in British law to legalise sadomasochism, and provide assistance to any person subjected to discrimination because of their consensual sexual behaviour.

That December, following a public consultation, the Law Commission published &#x27;Consent in the Criminal Law&#x27;, a consultation paper which provisionally proposed the decriminalisation of consensual sadomasochistic acts, except in the case of &#x27;seriously disabling injury&#x27;. This proposal was never adopted into law.

<doc id="684628" wikidata="Q1949144" url="?curid=684628" title="Parental alienation">
<text>Parental alienation is a theorized process through which a child becomes estranged from one parent as the result of the psychological manipulation of another parent. The child&#x27;s estrangement may manifest itself as fear, disrespect or hostility toward the distant parent, and may extend to additional relatives or parties. The child&#x27;s estrangement is disproportionate to any acts or conduct attributable to the alienated parent. Parental alienation can occur in any family unit, but is claimed to occur most often within the context of family separation, particularly when legal proceedings are involved, although the participation of professionals such as lawyers, judges and psychologists may also contribute to conflict.

Proponents of the concept of parental alienation assert that it is primarily motivated by one parent&#x27;s desire to exclude the other parent from their child&#x27;s life. Some assert that parental alienation should be diagnosable in children as a mental disorder. Some propose that parental alienation be recognized as a form of child abuse or family violence. They assert that parental alienation creates stress on the alienated parent and the child, and significantly increases the child&#x27;s lifetime risk of mental illness.

Parental alienation remains controversial both within the psychological community and the legal system. The psychological community has not accepted parental alienation as a diagnosable mental condition. Critics note that alienating behaviors are common in high-conflict family situations such as child custody proceedings, but that the estrangement of a child from a parent remains rare. They assert that the research performed to date does not support the theory that parental alienation results in the harm described by proponents of the concept. They also express concern that a parent who has caused a child to become estranged, for example through acts of domestic violence or child abuse, may claim to be the victim of parental alienation to convince a court that the child&#x27;s justified response to the abuse is the result of the other parent&#x27;s misconduct and to potentially gain custody of the child. No diagnostic criteria have been established for parental alienation, and proposals made to date have not been established as reliable. No program of treatment has been demonstrated to be safe or valid, and proponents of parental alienation theory agree that more research into treatment is necessary.

The theory of parental alienation has been asserted within legal proceedings as a basis for awarding custody to a parent who alleges estrangement, or to modify custody in favor of that parent. Courts have generally rejected parental alienation as a valid scientific theory, but some courts have allowed the concept to be argued as relevant to the determination of the child&#x27;s best interests when making a custody determination. Legal professionals recognize that alienating behaviors are common in child custody cases, but are cautious about accepting the concept of parental alienation.

==Characteristics==
Parental alienation describes the breakdown of the relationship between a child and one of the child&#x27;s parents, when there is no valid justification for that breakdown. When parental alienation is found to exist between a parent and child, the alienation is attributed to inappropriate actions and behavior by the other parent.

Parental alienation falls within the spectrum of family estrangement, a term that describes when family members become alienated from each other without regard to cause. As estrangement may occur between a parent and child for other reasons, it is possible to discuss alienation in terms of a child&#x27;s having a preferred and a nonpreferred parent without implying that a child&#x27;s avoidance of one parent is due to parental alienation.

The concept of parental alienation is normally raised only in contexts in which the child&#x27;s alienation from the parent is alleged to be unwarranted. Under that conception, estrangement from a parent falls into one of two broad categories:
* Justified parental estrangement, that results from such factors as the rejected parent&#x27;s harmful or abusive behavior, substance abuse, neglect, or abandonment.
* Parental alienation, in which one parent engages in actions that cause the child to strongly ally with that parent and reject the other without legitimate justification. The rejected parent may contribute to the estrangement in some manner, but the key concept is that the rejection by the child is out of proportion to anything that the rejected parent has done.
Justified parental estrangement is an understandable refusal by a child to see a parent, while parental alienation lacks justifiable reason, although there is no consensus regarding how to differentiate one from the other. There is no established means of assessing whether a child&#x27;s feelings toward a parent are &quot;irrational&quot; or &quot;without legitimate basis&quot;, complicating any effort to attribute a child&#x27;s attitudes toward a parent to parental alienation.

==Theories==
Alienating behaviors are often demonstrated by both parents in high-conflict divorce and child custody cases, but do not ordinarily result in alienation of a child from a parent and may backfire against the parent who engages in alienating behavior. Theories of parental alienation should explain how the relationship between the child and the rejected parent deteriorates, why under similar circumstances alienation may occur in one family but not another, and the relationship between alienating behaviors and the severity of a child’s alienation from a parent.

In situations where a child avoids one parent and strongly prefers the other, the only behaviors that can be observed are avoidance and preference. Alienation by one parent thus cannot be directly measured, and is instead inferred from the child&#x27;s behavior. Some researchers thus use &quot;preferred&quot; rather than &quot;alienating&quot; parent and &quot;non-preferred&quot; rather than &quot;alienated&quot;, &quot;rejected&quot;, or &quot;targeted&quot; parent.

Although a number of theories have been proposed, there is no generally accepted theory of parental alienation, either as to its cause or to the motivation of the allegedly alienating parent. One theory of motivation suggests that parental alienation may occur when divorce triggers reenactment of a parent&#x27;s childhood feelings of inadequacy or abandonment, and causes alienating parents to reenact psychological processes experienced during their own childhood. However, that theory does not explain alleged parental alienation that may occur in other contexts, nor in cases where there is no evidence of a parent&#x27;s childhood trauma. Another theory of motivation posits that alienation is a form of harmful parenting by a parent who suffers from a personality disorder, specifically borderline personality disorder or narcissistic personality disorder. A divorce, breakup of a relationship or similarly difficult experience triggers feelings of inadequacy or abandonment that cause that parent to decompensate into persecutorial delusions, and to project their fears onto the other parent. However, parental alienation is frequently alleged in cases where neither parent has been diagnosed with a personality disorder.

==Consequences==
Studies suggest that independent of other marital issues, acts of parental alienation may be harmful to children. While not all adults who experience acts of parental alienation during childhood report negative consequences, many report outcomes that they attribute to parental alienation, including low self-esteem, addiction and substance abuse, trust issues, and relationship problems. For example, a retrospective study of adults found that independent of damage of a child&#x27;s relationship with the other parent, perceived experiences with parental alienation during childhood correlate in adulthood with lower self-sufficiency, lower self-esteem, higher rates of major depressive disorder, and insecure attachment styles. A survey of self-reported childhood experiences of three hundred and sixty-one adults in Italy found that 42.1% of participants reported acts of parental alienation by their mothers, and 54.3% reported acts of parental alienation by their fathers. Reports of parental alienation were found to correlate with reports of psychological maltreatment.

Assessment of the impact of parental alienation within the context of legal proceedings, such as child custody litigation, is complicated by the participation of other professionals, including psychologists, lawyers and judges, whose actions and decisions may negatively affect family relationships. Although alienating behaviors by parents are common in high-conflict divorces, most children do not become alienated from a parent as a result of that behavior.

Some mental health professionals argue that severe parental alienation should be established as a form of emotional abuse and domestic violence. However, controversy persists as to whether parental alienation should be treated as a form of child abuse or family violence.

==Diagnosis==
No instrument or measure has been demonstrated to be valid or reliable in the assessment of parental alienation, or to diagnose parental alienation from any list of child behaviors. The claim that any individual behavior or cluster of behaviors demonstrates that the preferred parent has caused the child&#x27;s avoidance is not based on empirical work and as an inference is the result of a problem of critical thinking called affirming the consequent. No diagnostic criteria have been proposed that can be applied to determine if a child&#x27;s feelings toward a parent are irrational or disproportionate to the actions or behavior of the alienated parent. The absence of a valid and reliable assessment measure also means that it is difficult to evaluate whether parental alienation treatments are effective

Although it has been proposed that parental alienation can be diagnosed in a child who displays some or all of a set of behaviors, the proposed criteria have not been studied empirically, and have not been demonstrated to occur more often in children who avoid one parent after high-conflict divorce than they do in children matched for age who are experiencing different stressors and do not have a strong preference for one parent. It is also necessary to diagnose the whole family system in order to avoid misattributing a child&#x27;s estrangement to the actions of a parent. Further, symptoms that are claimed to suggest parental alienation may occur in a high-conflict divorce even without indoctrination by the favored parent, rendering them problematic for identification of improper parenting.

Critics of this approach to diagnosis assert that if the behaviors can occur without an alienating parent, they cannot of themselves be used to determine if a child is demonstrating symptoms from parental alienation. The proposed list of behaviors has also been criticized as vague and subjective. For example, a child&#x27;s claim to have independently formulated opinions of a rejected parent may be interpreted as &quot;independent-thinker phenomenon&quot;, which is proposed as evidence of parental alienation, such that any statement a child makes about parental influence or lack thereof can be interpreted as confirmation of parental alienation.

==Treatment==
There is no generally recognized treatment protocol for parental alienation. A number of treatment models have been created for children deemed to show parental alienation, with some intensive models carried out after custody of the children has been transferred to the targeted parent. Five treatment programs were evaluated in terms of the levels of evidence provided by the empirical research said to support them. None were supported by research that met standards required for evidence-based treatments. Instead, they were at the third level of evidence, often called “promising”, as they involved before-and-after assessment of nonpreferred parents’ opinions rather than randomized controlled trials or clinical controlled trials using standardized assessments. Reports of some young adults who have been through one of these treatments suggest that as well as lacking an adequate evidence basis, the treatments may be either directly or indirectly harmful to children and adolescents.

One form of reconciliation therapy, described by its proponents as family reunification therapy, involves court-ordered removal of children from their preferred parent and the requirement that they engage in intensive programs with the rejected parent. The safety and effectiveness of family reconciliation therapy, the scientific validity of that therapy, and the question of whether it may properly be considered by a court, are in dispute. Due to its unproven nature, this form of therapy has been criticized as &quot;quack therapy&quot;. In order to avoid regulations and oversight that apply to psychological and medical treatment, these programs are often billed as educational or psycho-educational. These programs tend also to be very expensive. Some children who have been compelled to participate in family reunification therapy have reported that they were forced to deny their truthful complaints about the parent that was alleged to be alienated. A recent program evaluation of a four-day intervention called &quot;Turning Point for Families&quot; found preliminary evidence that the program could improve family relationships in situations where a court finds alienation.

==Legal issues==
Parental alienation concepts have been used to argue for child custody changes when children resist contact with a non-preferred parent. The argument generally involves the request for a court order giving full custody to the nonpreferred parent and denying contact to the preferred parent. The child may also be ordered into a treatment program to facilitate reunification with the nonpreferred parent. The rationale of this argument is that the attitude and actions of children who reject a parent without clear evidence of abuse reflects mental illness. If that belief is correct then the child&#x27;s mental disorder may be attributed to the actions of the preferred parent and, as the actions have harmed the child, those actions can be defined as abusive. Once an allegation of parental alienation is interpreted as abuse by a parent, that interpretation provides a strong argument against custody of or even contact with that parent. This line of argument, however, ignores other possible factors, such as the effect on a child of poor parenting skills of the nonpreferred parent or the influence of one or both parents’ new romantic partners, and depends on inferences about the behavior of the preferred parent rather than direct evidence of inappropriate parenting.

A number of articles in professional journals have presented critiques of the manner in which parental alienation advocates have construed children&#x27;s avoidance of one divorced or separated parent and strong preference for the other parent. Key among their concerns is that advocates of parental alienation concepts have presented a highly simplified explanation of visitation and contact resistance or refusal by children of couples in high-conflict divorces. As multiple factors are generally involved in human behavior, they assert that without direct evidence it is not appropriate to infer manipulation or exploitation by one parent as the cause of a child&#x27;s preference for one parent over the other. Another concern is that there is a lack of evidentiary support for the concept of parental alienation, as proponents of this theory have failed to meet standards for evidence-based treatment and have never produced empirical support for claimed symptoms of alienation such as &quot;black and white thinking&quot;.

A particularly problematic aspect of the use of parental alienation concepts in child custody decisions is the possible association of allegations of alienating behavior by the preferred parent with allegations of domestic violence by the nonpreferred parent. As allegations of parental alienation can lead to court-ordered custody changes giving the nonpreferred parent full custody, and often including restraining orders against contact with the preferred parent, it becomes possible for a finding of parental alienation to cause children to be placed in the custody of a physically or sexually abusive parent.

Although courts have long been concerned with the issue of parental estrangement, and how to safely reunite children with their estranged parents, research into the cause of parental estrangement frequently involves issues of selection bias, lack of operationalization, small sample size, misclassification, and other methodological concerns. There remain significant questions about whether there is sufficient evidence to accurately support claims about the cause, prevalence and consequence of parental estrangement, or appropriate interventions in cases where estrangement exists. Sound research in this area remains in its early stages, and further research is required that is designed to reduce the risk of misclassificaiton, produce findings that are reliable, and to identify appropriate interventions.

===Worldwide===

====Brazil====
In August 2010 Brazil passed the first national legislation prohibiting parental alienation. &quot;Lei No. 12.318&quot; which it defines &quot;as the interference with the psychological formation of a child or adolescent that promotes repudiation of a parent or damage to the establishment or maintenance of ties with a parent, when such an act is practiced by a parent, grandparent, those who have the child or adolescent under their authority, custody, or supervision.&quot; A judge who finds that parental alienation has occurred may issue a warning, may modify the custody arrangement in favor of the alienated parent, may order counseling, or may place the alienated child in an interim residence.

====England====
In England, the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (Cafcass) was formed to promote the welfare of children and families involved family court cases. Cafcass recognizes the possibility of parental alienating behaviours in family separation cases.

====Israel====

In Israel, parental alienation is known as &quot;nikur hori&quot;, and some courts are receptive to efforts to attempt to reunify children who have been estranged or alienated from a parent, although concerns remain that there is little empirical evidence to support the concept of parental alienation. In order to expedite the resolution of custody cases and disputes, some jurisdictions in Israel have implemented pilot projects for cases involving child custody and enforcement of visitation orders.

====Mexico====
In the former Federal District of Mexico, an area that is officially equivalent to Mexico City, 323 &quot;Septimus&quot; of the Civil Code prohibited a family member from transforming the conscience of a minor so as to prevent, hinder or interfere with the minor&#x27;s relationship with one of the minor&#x27;s parents. If a court found that such acts had occurred and were of mild or moderate nature, and that the person responsible for the alienation was the father, the court was required to transfer custody to the other parent. If the court found that the degree of parental alienation attributable to the father was severe, all contact with the father of the child was required to be suspended, and the child was required to receive counseling. This provision was repealed by the Legislative Assembly of Mexico City in 2007 and again, after its reenactment, in 2017.

==== Republic of Ireland ====
Although Ireland does not have legislation on parental alienation, in 2020, for the first time in a child access case a judge described a parent&#x27;s actions as &quot;parental alienation&quot;. During 2019 to 2021 thirty of the thirty-one Irish councils have asked the government to recognise and address parental alienation. In 2021 the Irish Government included international parental alienation research and public consultation in its Justice Action Plan.

====United States====
Although all states have custody laws that require courts to consider how parents&#x27; actions affect the best interests of their children, no federal or state laws that incorporate the concept of parental alienation have been passed. Some courts recognize parental alienation as a serious issue with potential long-term effects and serious outcomes for the child. Other jurisdictions may suspend child support in cases where parental alienation occurs. For example, in a New York case in which the father was prevented from seeing his son by the child&#x27;s mother through a &quot;pattern of alienation&quot;, child support was suspended. Some United States courts have tried to address the issue through mandated reunification therapy.

Due to the nature of allegations of parental alienation, many courts require that a qualified expert witness testify in support of allegations of parental alienation or in association with any allegation that a parent has a mental health disorder.

An examination of parental alienation U.S. custody decisions, based upon a review of appellate cases, found that courts are significantly more skeptical of child physical and sexual abuse allegations made by mothers as compared to similar claims made by fathers, rendering parental alienation a powerful defense for fathers accused of abuse but not for mothers. A subsequent, smaller study disputed that conclusion.

==History==
The term parental alienation is derived from parental alienation syndrome, a term introduced by Richard Gardner in 1985 to describe a set of behaviors that he had observed in children exposed to family separation or divorce whereby children rejected or showed what he interpreted as unwarranted negative feelings towards one of their parents.

The idea that children may be turned against one of their parents, or may reject a parent unjustifiably during family breakdown, has been recognized for centuries. The position that many family estrangements result from such a process of psychological manipulation, undue influence or interference by a third party (rather than from genuine interactions between the estranged parties themselves) is less well-recognized.

=== Parental alienation syndrome ===

Parental alienation syndrome (PAS) was proposed by child psychiatrist Richard Gardner as a means of diagnosing parental alienation within a family by virtue of identifying a cluster of symptoms that he hypothesized would only co-exist if a parent were engaged in alienating behavior. This theory involved looking for a set of psychological symptoms in a child and proposing PAS as a basis for concluding that those symptoms were caused by harmful parenting practices.

No mental health organizations recognized parental alienation syndrome. In 2008, the American Psychological Association noted that there is a lack of data to support the concept of parental alienation syndrome, but took no official position on the syndrome. A 2009 survey of mental health and legal professionals found broad skepticism of the concept of parental alienation syndrome, and caution in relation to the concept of parental alienation.

In 2012, in anticipation of the release of the DSM-5, the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, an argument was made for the inclusion of PAS in the DSM-5 as a diagnosis related to parental alienation. The argument was based upon the position that parental alienation and a variety of other descriptions of behaviors represent the underlying concept of parental alienation disorder. Despite lobbying by proponents, the proposal was rejected in December 2012.

With the exclusion of PAS from the DSM-V, some advocates for the recognition of parental alienation as a diagnosable condition have argued that elements of parental alienation are covered in the DSM-5 under the concept of &quot;Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention&quot;, specifically, &quot;Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress&quot;. Those advocates assert that children who are exposed to intimate partner distress between their parents may develop psychological symptoms as a result of that exposure. However, relational issues are not mental disorders or diagnoses, but are instead considered to be problems that may be relevant for diagnosis or treatment of a diagnosable disorder. While parent-child estrangement can serve as an example of a relational problem such as &quot;Child Affected by Parental Relationship Distress&quot;, the observation of a relational issue is not a diagnosis.

=== Recognition of parental alienation ===
As the psychological and psychiatric communities did not accept the concept of a &quot;syndrome&quot;, the term &quot;parental alienation&quot; was advanced in the 1990s as a possible explanation of a child&#x27;s behavior independent of a psychological or psychiatric diagnosis. Among theories of parental alienation that have been proposed, psychologists have argued that the term parental alienation may be used in a manner synonymous with the original formulation of parental alienation syndrome, with diagnosis based upon signs observable in children, that it may be used to describe the process or tactics by which a child becomes alienated from a parent, or to describe the outcomes for parents and others who have experienced unwarranted rejection by a child.

Some empirical research has been performed, though the quality of the studies vary widely and research in the area is still developing. One complicating factor for research is that high numbers of parents involved in high conflict custody disputes engage in alienating or indoctrinating behaviors, but only a small proportion children become alienated.

In an informal survey at the Association of Family and Conciliation Courts in 2010, 98% of the 300 respondents agreed with the question, &quot;Do you think that some children are manipulated by one parent to irrationally and unjustifiably reject the other parent?&quot;. Survey participants were divided as to whether a rejected parent partially blame when a child becomes alienated from a parent and the other parent is exhibiting alienating behaviors, and by a significant margin rejected the inclusion of parental alienation in the DSM. However, parental alienation refers not to the acts of manipulation, but rather to the child&#x27;s rejection of a parent that results from alienating behavior.

United States courts have broadly rejected parental alienation syndrome as a concept that may be presented in a child custody case, but it remains possible to argue within child custody litigation that parental alienation has occurred and to demonstrate how a parent&#x27;s alienating behaviors should be considered by a court when evaluating a custody case. Behaviors that result in parental alienation may reflect other mental health disorders, both on the part of the alienating parent and the rejected parent that, if proved, remain relevant to a custody determination. The behavior of the alienated child may also be a relevant factor. However, single-factor explanations for a child&#x27;s estrangement from a parent have not proved valid, and multi-factor models are more complex and difficult to argue in a court setting.

==Activism==
In late 2005, a Canadian activist named Sarvy Emo proposed that March 28 be designated Parental Alienation Awareness Day. The proposed date was later modified to April 25. The date has received some level of recognition, such as a 2006 proclamation by the Governor of Georgia recognizing April 25 as Parental Alienation Awareness Day, and its unofficial recognition by the Governor of Nevada in 2007.

There are also organizations that actively oppose the use of the concept of parental alienation and the making of custody decisions based on this belief system. For example, the Center for Judicial Excellence argues against the use of the parental alienation argument in custody cases. In 2019 the American Professional Society on Abuse of Children (APSAC) posted on its website a recommendation against using the parental alienation concept or claiming that when a child rejects a parent, emotional abuse by the preferred parent has taken place. The Institute on Violence, Abuse, and Trauma (IVAT) devoted a three-hour session at its September 2019 meeting to arguments opposing the use of parental alienation concepts and related claims.

<text>A gunshot is a single discharge of a gun, typically a man-portable firearm, producing a visible flash, a powerful and loud shockwave and often chemical gunshot residue. The term can also refer to a ballistic wound caused by such a discharge.

Multiple discharges of one or more firearms are referred to as gunfire. The word can connote either the sound of a gun firing, the projectiles that were fired, or both. For example, the statement &quot;gunfire came from the next street&quot; could either mean the sound of discharge, or it could mean the bullets that were discharged. It is better to be a bit more specific while writing however. &quot;The sound of gunfire&quot; or &quot;we came under gunfire&quot; would be more descriptive and prevent confusion. In the latter phrase, in particular, &quot;fire&quot; is used more (i.e. &quot;under fire&quot;), as both words hold the same general meaning within the proper context.

==Gunfire characteristics==
There are three primary attributes that characterize gunfire and hence enable the detection and location of gunfire and similar weapon discharges:
# A muzzle flash which occurs when superheated gases and incompletely combusted propellant residue are secondarily ignited upon contact with fresh ambient oxygen after being expelled out the gun barrel
# A muzzle blast which occurs when high-pressure gases within the barrel are suddenly released and rapidly expand when the projectile exits the muzzle and the bullet-bore contact that maintained the seal is removed. A typical muzzle blast generates a shock wave with a sound pressure level (SPL) of 140 dB or louder.
# A whip-like “snap” or “crack” caused by the sonic boom that occurs as a projectile moves through the air at supersonic speeds.

Gunfire can be confused with other noises that can sound similar, such as firework explosions and cars backfiring. Gunfire noise propagation is anisotropic. The sounds may be heard at greater distances in the direction of bullet travel than behind or beside the gun.

Urban areas typically exhibit diurnal noise patterns where background noise is higher during the daytime and lower at night and the noise floor directly correlates to urban activity (e.g., automobile traffic, airplane traffic, construction, and so on). A firearm&#x27;s muzzle blast may be masked by ambient noise during the daytime, but may be detected at greater distances during the quieter hours of darkness. A popular urban gunfire locator system typically uses six to ten audio sensors per square mile for trilateration. (two or three per square kilometer)

A suppressor can be attached to the muzzle of a firearm to decrease the auditory signature of the high-velocity gases released from the muzzle when firing the weapon. The sound of firing is only decreased, however, and is still considerable. Suppressors attached to the muzzle will not reduce the sound of high velocity gases released from other locations, such as the gap between the cylinder and barrel of a revolver. A muzzle suppressor is similarly ineffective in reducing the snap of a supersonic bullet or the noise produced by the mechanical action of a self-loading firearm. Use of suppressors is rare in United States crimes. A 2007 study estimated unlawful suppressor possession was involved in only 0.05 percent (1 in 2,000) federal criminal prosecutions; and the suppressor was unused, but simply in the possession of the defendant for 92% of prosecutions involving a suppressor.

<text>Air Vice Marshal James Edgar Johnson, , DL (9 March 1915 – 30 January 2001), nicknamed &quot;Johnnie&quot;, was an English Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot and flying ace who flew and fought during the Second World War.

Johnson grew up and was educated in the East Midlands, where he qualified as an engineer. A sportsman, Johnson broke his collarbone while playing rugby, an injury that later complicated his ambitions of becoming a fighter pilot. Johnson had been interested in aviation since his youth and applied to join the RAF. He was initially rejected, first on social, and then on medical grounds; he was eventually accepted in August 1939. The injury problems, however, returned during his early training and flying career, resulting in his missing the Battle of France and the Battle of Britain between May and October 1940.

In 1940 Johnson had an operation to reset his collarbone, and began flying regularly. He took part in the offensive sweeps over German-occupied Europe from 1941 to 1944, almost without rest. Johnson was involved in heavy aerial fighting during this period. His combat tour included participation in the Dieppe Raid, Combined Bomber Offensive, Battle of Normandy, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge and the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Johnson progressed to the rank of group captain by the end of the war.

Johnson was credited with 34 individual victories over enemy aircraft, as well as seven shared victories, three shared probable, ten damaged, three shared damaged and one destroyed on the ground. Johnson flew 700 operational sorties and engaged enemy aircraft on 57 occasions. Included in his list of individual victories were 14 Messerschmitt Bf 109s and 20 Focke-Wulf Fw 190s destroyed making him the most successful RAF ace against the Fw 190. This score made him the highest scoring Western Allied fighter ace against the German Luftwaffe.

Johnson continued his career in the RAF after the war, and served in the Korean War before retiring in 1966 with the rank of air vice marshal. He maintained an interest in aviation and did public speaking on the subject as well as entering into the business of aviation art. Johnnie Johnson remained active until his death from cancer in 2001.

==Early life==
Johnson was born 9 March 1915 in Barrow upon Soar, Leicestershire, to Alfred Johnson and Beatrice May Johnson. He lived and was brought up in Melton Mowbray, where his father was a policeman. Alfred Johnson was an inspector by the mid-1930s. One evening Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists, held a meeting in the town. The licence for the meeting expired at 10 p.m. at which time Alfred Johnson went alone and ejected the Fascists from the building.

Johnson was educated at Camden Street Junior School and Loughborough Grammar School. Johnson&#x27;s uncle, Edgar Charles Rossell, who had won the Military Cross with the Royal Fusiliers in 1916, paid for Johnson&#x27;s education at Loughborough. According to his brother Ross, during his time there, Johnson was nearly expelled after refusing punishment for a misdemeanour, believing it to be unjustified: &quot;he was very principled and simply dug his heels in&quot;. Among Johnson&#x27;s hobbies and interests were shooting and sports; he shot rabbits and birds in the local countryside.

Johnson attended the University College Nottingham (later the University of Nottingham), where he qualified as a civil engineer, aged 22. Johnson became a surveyor at Melton Mowbray Urban District Council before progressing to assistant engineer with Chigwell Urban District Council at Loughton. In 1938, Johnson broke his collarbone playing rugby for Chingford Rugby Club; the injury was wrongly set and did not heal properly, which later caused him difficulty at the start of his flying career.

==Joining the RAF==
Johnson started taking flying lessons at his own expense. He applied to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF) but encountered some of the social problems that were rife in British society. Johnson felt he was rejected on the grounds of his class status. Johnson&#x27;s fortunes were to improve. The prospect of war increased in the aftermath of the Munich Crisis, and the criteria for applicants changed as the RAF expanded and brought in men from ordinary social backgrounds. Johnson re-applied to the AAF. He was informed that sufficient pilots were already available but there were some vacancies in the balloon squadrons. Johnson rejected the offer.

Inspired by some Chingford friends who had joined, Johnson applied again to join the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR). The RAFVR was a means to enter the RAF for young men with ordinary backgrounds. All volunteer aircrew were made sergeant on joining with the possibility of a commission. Once again he was rejected, this time on the grounds that there were too many applicants for vacancies and his injury made him unsuitable for flight operations. His ambition frustrated, Johnson joined the Leicestershire Yeomanry, where the injury was not a bar to recruitment. He joined the Territorial Army unit because, though he was in a reserved occupation, if war came, he had &quot;no intention of seeing out the duration building air raid shelters or supervising decontamination squads&quot;. Johnson was content in the Yeomanry. One day while riding through Burghley, near Stamford, on annual camp Johnson took a detour to RAF Wittering nearby (now in Cambridgeshire.) Upon seeing a line of Hawker Hurricane fighters Johnson remarked &quot;If I&#x27;ve got to fight Hitler I&#x27;d sooner fight him in one of those than on a bloody great horse!&quot;.

===Flight training===
In August 1939, Johnson was finally accepted by the RAFVR and began training at weekends at the airfield at Stapleford Tawney, a satellite airfield of RAF North Weald. There he received ground instruction on airmanship. Taught by retired service pilots of 21 Elementary &amp; Reserve Flying Training School, Johnson trained on the de Havilland Tiger Moth biplane. Upon the outbreak of war in September 1939, with the rank of sergeant, Johnson entrained for Cambridge. He arrived at the 2nd Initial Training Wing to begin flight instruction. He was interviewed by senior officers in which he said his profession and knowledge of topography, surveying and mapping would make him more useful in a reconnaissance role. The wing commander agreed, but nonetheless, Johnson was selected for fighter pilot training and given the service number 754750 with the rank of sergeant. Johnson and several hundred others were entrained for Cambridge and the 2 initial Training Wing. While assigned here Johnson learned basic military drill, sometimes given the slang name &quot;square bashing&quot;.

By December 1939, Johnson began his initial training at 22 EFTS (Elementary Flying Training School), Cambridge. He flew only three times in December 1939 and eight in January 1940, all as second pilot. On 29 February 1940, Johnson flew solo for the first time in Tiger Moth N6635. On 15 March and 24 April, he passed a 50-minute flight test followed by two night flights the following day. The chief flying instructor passed him on 6 May. He then moved to 5 FTS at Sealand before completing training at 7 OTU (Operational Training Unit) – RAF Hawarden in Wales flying the Miles Master N7454 where he earned his instrument, navigation, night-flying ratings and practised forced landings. After training was complete on 7 August 1940, Johnson received his &quot;wings&quot; and was immediately inducted into the General Duties Branch of the RAF as a pilot officer with 55 hours and 5 minutes solo flying.

On 19 August 1940, Johnson flew a Spitfire for the first time. Over the next weeks he practised handling, formation flying, attacks, battle climbs, aerobatics and dogfighting. During his training flights, he stalled and crashed a Spitfire. Johnson had his harness straps on too loose, and wrenched his shoulders – revealing that his earlier rugby injury had not healed properly. The Spitfire did a ground loop, ripping off one of the undercarriage legs and forcing the other up through the port main plane. The commanding officer (CO) excused Johnson, for the short airfield was difficult to land on for an inexperienced pilot. Johnson got the impression, however, that he would be watched closely, and felt that if he made another mistake, he would be &quot;certainly washed out&quot;. Johnson tried to pack the injured shoulder with wool, held in place by adhesive tape. He also tightened the straps to reduce vibrations while flying. The measures proved useless and Johnson found he had lost feeling in his right hand. When he dived the pressure aggravated his shoulder. He often tried to fly using his left hand only, but Spitfires had to be handled with both hands during anything other than simple manoeuvres. Despite the difficulties with his injuries, on 28 August 1940, the course was complete. Johnson had 205.25 hours on operational types including 23.50 on the Spitfire.

====Injury resurfaces====
After training, in August 1940, he was briefly posted to No. 19 Squadron as a probationary pilot officer. Due to equipment difficulties, 19 Squadron were unable to complete Johnson&#x27;s training and he left the unit. On 6 September 1940 Johnson was posted to No. 616 Squadron at RAF Coltishall. Squadron Leader H.L &quot;Billy&quot; Burton took Johnson on a 50-minute training flight in X4055. After the flight Burton impressed upon Johnson the difficulties of deflection shooting and the technique of a killing shot from line-astern or near line-astern positions; the duty of the number two whose job was not to shoot down enemy aircraft but to ensure the leader&#x27;s tail was safe. Burton also directed Johnson to some critical tactical essentials; the importance of keeping good battle formation and the tactical use of sun, cloud and height. Five days later, Johnson flew an X-Raid patrol in Spitfire X4330, qualifying for the Battle of Britain clasp.

Johnson&#x27;s old injury continued to trouble him and he found flying high performance aircraft like the Spitfire extremely painful. RAF medics gave him two options; he could have an operation that would correct the problem, but this meant he would miss the Battle of Britain, or becoming a training instructor flying the light Tiger Moth. Johnson opted for the operation. He had hoped for discreet treatment, but word soon reached the CO, and Johnson was taken off flying duties and sent to the RAF hospital at Rauceby. He did not return to the squadron until 28 December 1940. CO Burton took Johnson up for a test flight on 31 December 1940 in Miles Magister L8151. After the 45-minute flight, Johnson&#x27;s fitness to fly was approved.

==Second World War==
Johnson returned to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming part of the Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony Gaze. On 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Cotes. The controller vectored the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and lost sight of it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from the bomber Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It was the only time Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.

In the opening months, Johnson flew as a night fighter pilot. Using day fighters to act as night fighters without radar was largely unsuccessful in intercepting German bombers during the Blitz; Johnson&#x27;s only action occurred on 22 February 1941 when he damaged a Messerschmitt Bf 110 in Spitfire R6611, QJ-F. A week later, Johnson&#x27;s squadron was moved to RAF Tangmere on the Channel coast. Johnson was eager to see combat after just 10.40 operational hours and welcomed the prospect of meeting the enemy from Tangmere. If the Germans did not resume their assault the wing was to take the fight to them.

In November 1940 Air Marshal Sholto Douglas became Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Fighter Command. On 8 December 1940 a directive from the Air Staff called for &quot;Sector Offensive Sweeps&quot;. It ordered hit-and-run operations over Belgium and France. The operations were to be conducted by three squadrons to harass German air defences. On 10 January 1941 &quot;Circus&quot; attacks were initiated by sending small bomber formations protected by large numbers of fighters. The escalation of offensive operations throughout 1941 was designed to draw up the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; as Douglas&#x27; command took an increasingly offensive stance. These operations became known as the Circus offensive. Trafford Leigh-Mallory, AOC 11 Group, penned &quot;Operations Instruction No. 7&quot;, which he had written on 16 February. Leigh-Mallory outlined six distinct operations for day fighters: &quot;Ramrod&quot; (bomber escort with primary goal the destruction of the target); &quot;Fighter Ramrod&quot; (the same goal where fighters escorted ground-attack fighters); &quot;Roadstead&quot; (bomber escort and anti-shipping operations); &quot;Fighter Roadstead&quot; (the same operation as &quot;Roadstead&quot; but without bombers) along with &quot;Rhubarb&quot; (poor weather ground attack operation) and &quot;Circus&quot; operations (see glossary).

===Circus offensives===
Johnson&#x27;s first contact with enemy single-engine fighters did not go as planned. Bader undertook a patrol with Dundas as his number two. Johnson followed in his section as number three with Whaley &quot;Nip&quot; Heppell guarding his tail as Red Four. Johnson spotted three Bf 109s a few hundred feet higher and travelling in the same direction. Johnson, forgetting to calmly report the number, type and position of the enemy, shouted, &quot;Look out Dogsbody!&quot; (Bader&#x27;s call sign). Such a call was only to be used if the pilot in question was in imminent danger of being attacked. The section broke in all directions and headed to Tangmere singly. The mistake brought an embarrassing rebuke from Bader at the debriefing.

Johnson flew various operations over France including the &quot;Rhubarb&quot; ground attack missions which Johnson hated—he considered it a waste of pilots. Several successful fighter pilots had been lost this way. Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock and Wing Commander Paddy Finucane were killed on &quot;Rhubarb&quot; operations in August 1941 and July 1942 respectively. Squadron leader Robert Stanford Tuck would be captured carrying out a similar operation in January 1942. During this time, Dundas and other pilots also expressed dissatisfaction with the formation tactics being used in the wing. After a long conversation into the early hours, Bader accepted the suggestions by his senior pilots and agreed to the use of more flexible tactics to lessen the chances of being taken by surprise. The tactical changes involved operating overlapping line abreast formations similar to the German finger-four formation. The tactics were used thereafter by all RAF pilots in the wing.

The first use of these tactics by the Tangmere Wing was used on 6 May 1941. The wing engaged Bf 109Fs from &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 51 (Fighter Wing 51), led by Werner Mölders. Noticing the approaching Germans below and behind them, the Spitfires feigned ignorance. Waiting for the optimum moment to turn the tables, Bader called for them to break, and whip around behind the Bf 109s. Unfortunately for the Tangmere Wing, while the tactic had been successful in avoiding a surprise attack, the break was mistimed. It left some Bf 109s still behind the Spitfires. In the battle that followed the wing shot down one Bf 109 and damaged another, although Dundas was shot down for the second time in his career—and once again by Mölders, who had remained behind the British. Dundas was able to nurse his crippled fighter back to base and crash-land.

One month later, Johnson gained his first air victory. On 26 June Johnson participated in Circus 24. Crossing the coast near Gravelines, Bader warned of 24 Bf 109s nearby, southeast, in front of the wing. The Bf 109s saw the British and turned to attack the lower No. 610 Squadron from the rear. While watching three Bf 109s above him dive to port, Johnson lost sight of his wing commander at 15,000 feet. Immediately a Bf 109E flew in front of him and turned slightly to port at a range of 150 yards. After receiving hits, the Bf 109&#x27;s hood was jettisoned and the pilot baled out. Several No. 145 Squadron pilots witnessed the victory. He had expended 278 rounds from P7837&#x27;s guns. The Bf 109 was one of five lost by &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 2 (Fighter Wing 2) that day.

A flurry of action followed. On 1 July 1941 he expended 89 rounds and damaged a Bf 109E. Bader&#x27;s section was attacked and Johnson out-turned his assailant. Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing sight of the squadron, Johnson and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. Johnson dived so as to come up and underneath into the enemy&#x27;s blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. Johnson saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, Johnson disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, Johnson bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109&#x27;s starboard wing. Johnson could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and did not make a claim. His second victory was probably &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; (corporal) R. Klienike, III./&quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.

On 21 July, Johnson shared in the destruction of another Bf 109 with Pilot Officer Heppell. Johnson&#x27;s wingman disappeared during the battle. Sergeant Mabbet was mortally wounded but made a wheels-up landing near St Omer. Impressed with his skilful flying while badly wounded, the Germans buried him with full honours. On 23 July, Johnson damaged another Bf 109. During this battle Adolf Galland, &quot;Geschwaderkommodore&quot; (wing commander) of JG 26 was wounded; his life was saved by a recently installed armour plate behind his head.

Johnson took part in the 9 August 1941 mission in which Bader was lost over France. On that day Douglas Bader had been without his usual wingman Sir Alan Smith who was unable to fly due to having a head cold. During the sortie, Johnson destroyed a solitary Messerschmitt Bf 109. Johnson flew as wingman to Dundas in Bader&#x27;s section. As the wing crossed the coast, around 70 Bf 109s were reported in the area, the Luftwaffe aircraft outnumbering Bader&#x27;s wing by 3:1. Spotting a group of Bf 109s 1,000 feet below them, Bader led a bounce on a lower group. The formations fell apart and the air battle became a mass of twisting aircraft;

Johnson exited the melee and was then immediately attacked by three Bf 109s. The closest was 100 yards away. Maintaining a steep, tight, spiralling turn, he dived into cloud and immediately headed for Dover. Coming out of the cloud, Johnson saw a lone Bf 109. Suspecting it to be one of the three that had chased him, he searched for the other two. Seeing nothing, Johnson attacked and shot it down. It was his fourth victory. Johnson ended his month&#x27;s tally by adding a probable victory on 21 August. But it had been a bad day and month for the wing. The much loathed Circus and Rhubarb raids had cost Fighter Command 108 fighters. The Germans lost just 18. On 4 September 1941 Johnson was promoted to flight lieutenant and awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC).

Johnson&#x27;s last certain victories of the year were achieved on 21 September 1941. Escorting Bristol Blenheims to Gosnay, the top cover wings failed to rendezvous with the bombers. Near Le Touquet at 15:15 and around 20,000 feet, Johnson&#x27;s section was bounced by 30 Bf 109s. Johnson broke and turned in and behind a Bf 109F. Approaching from a quarter astern and slightly below, Johnson fired closing from 200 to 70 yards. Pilot Officer Smith of Johnson&#x27;s section observed the pilot bail out. Pursued by several enemy aircraft, Johnson dived to ground level. About 10 miles off Le Touquet, other Bf 109s attacked. Allowing the Germans to close within range, Johnson turned into a steep left-hand turn. It took him onto the tail of a Bf 109. Johnson fired and broke away at 50 yards. The Bf 109 was hit, stalled and crashed into the sea. Johnson was pursued until 10 miles south of Dover. The two victories made Johnson&#x27;s total to six destroyed, which now meant he was an official flying ace. In winter 1941, Johnson and 616 Squadron moved to training duties. The odd convoy patrol was flown but it was an idle period for the squadron which had now concluded its &quot;Tangmere tour&quot;.

===Squadron leader to wing commander===
On 31 January 1942, the squadron moved to RAF Kings Cliffe. After an uneventful few months, RAF Fighter Command resumed its offensive policy in April 1942 when the weather cleared for large-scale operations. Johnnie flew seven sweeps that month. But the situation had now changed. The Spitfire V, which was flown by the RAF had been a match for the Bf 109F, however, the Germans had introduced a new fighter: the Focke-Wulf Fw 190. It was faster at all altitudes below 25,000 feet, possessed a faster roll rate, was more heavily armed and could out-dive and out-climb the Spitfire. Only in the turn could the Spitfire outperform the Fw 190. The introduction of this new enemy fighter resulted in heavier casualty rates among the Spitfire squadrons until a new mark of Spitfire could be produced. Johnson claimed a damaged Fw 190 on 15 April 1942 but he witnessed the Fw 190s get the better of the British pilots consistently throughout most of 1942:

On 25 May, Johnson experienced an unusual mission. His section engaged a Dornier Do 217 carrying British markings, four miles west of his base. Johnson allowed the three inexperienced pilots to attack it, but they only managed to damage the bomber. Days later, on 26 June 1942, Johnson was awarded the bar to his DFC. More welcome news was received late in the month as the first Spitfire Mk. IXs began reaching RAF units. On 10 July 1942, Johnson was promoted to the rank of squadron leader, effective as of 13 July, and given command of 610 Squadron.

In &quot;rhubarb&quot; operations over France, Johnson&#x27;s wing commander, Patrick Jameson, insisted that the line-astern formation be used which caused Johnson to question why tactics such as the finger-four had not been universally adopted. Johnson criticised the lack of tactical consistency and when his squadron flew top cover, he often changed to the finger-four as soon as they reached the French coast, hoping his wing leader would not notice.
By August 1942, preparations were begun for a major operation, &quot;Jubilee&quot;, at Dieppe. The Dieppe raid took place on 19 August 1942. Johnson took off at 07:40 in Spitfire VB. EP254, DW-B. Running into around 50 Bf 109s and Fw 190s in fours, pairs and singly. In a climbing attack Johnson shot down one Fw 190 which crashed into the sea and shared in the destruction of a Bf 109F. While heading back to base, Johnson attacked an alert Fw 190 which met his attack head on. The dogfight descended from 8,000 to zero feet. Flying over Dieppe, Johnson dived towards a destroyer in the hope its fire would drive off the Fw 190, now on his tail. The move worked and Johnson landed back at RAF West Malling at 09:20. For the remainder of the year, the squadron was moved to RAF Castletown in September 1942 to protect the Royal Navy fleet at Scapa Flow.

Johnson took command of No. 127 Wing RCAF based at RAF Kenley after Christmas and they received the new Spitfire IX: the answer to the Fw 190. After gaining a probable against a Fw 190 in February 1943, Johnnie selected Spitfire EN398 after a 50-minute test flight on 22 March 1943. It became his regular mount. Being a wing commander now meant his initials could be painted on the machine. His Spitfires now carried JE-J. He was also allotted the call sign &quot;Greycap&quot;.

Johnson set about changing the wing&#x27;s tactical approach. He quickly forced the wing to abandon the line-astern tactics for the finger-four formation which offered much more safety in combat; enabling multiple pilots to participate in scanning the skies for enemy aircraft so as to avoid an attack, and also being better able to spot and position their unit for a surprise attack upon the enemy. Johnson made another alteration to his units operations. He loathed ground-attack missions which highly trained fighter pilots were forced to participate in. He abandoned ground attack missions whenever he could. During these weeks, Johnson&#x27;s wing escorted United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers to targets in France. On a fighter sweep, Ramrod 49, Johnson destroyed an Fw 190 for his eighth victory. &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Hans Hiess from 6. &quot;Staffel&quot; bailed out, but his parachute failed to open.

The spring proved to be a busy one; Johnson claimed three Fw 190s damaged two days later. On 11 and 13 May he destroyed an Fw 190 to reach ten individual air victories while sharing in the destruction of another on the later date and a Bf 109 on 1 June. A further five victories against Fw 190s were achieved in June. Two were claimed on 15 June. On 17 June while leading the wing over Calais Johnson bounced one of JG 26&#x27;s &quot;Gruppen&quot; led by Wilhelm-Ferdinand Galland. He shot down &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Gunther Freitag, 8./JG 26 who was killed. On 24 June he claimed one destroyed and one damaged on and another victory on the 27th to bring his total to 15.

Johnson scored more success in July. The USAAF began Blitz Week; a concentrated effort against German targets. Escorting American bombers, Johnson destroyed three Bf 109s and damaged another, the last being shot down on 30 July; his tally stood at 18. There was still no standard formation procedure in Fighter Command, and Johnson&#x27;s use of the finger-four made the wing distinct in the air. It earned 144 Wing the nickname &quot;Wolfpack&quot;. The name remained until 144 Wing was moved to an Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) at Lashenden and was renamed No. 127 Wing RCAF, part of the RAF Second Tactical Air Force under the command of No. 83 Group RAF.

The tactics proved successful in the Canadian wing. Johnson scored his 19th to 21st victories on 23 and 26 August, whilst claiming yet another Fw 190 on 4 September 1943. Johnson&#x27;s 19th victory was gained against &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; (First-Sergeant) Erich Borounik 10./JG 26, who was killed. Johnson&#x27;s 21st victim, &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; Walter Grunlinger 10./JG 26, was also killed.

Johnson&#x27;s portrait is included in a montage of eighteen pilots painted by Olive Snell at RAF Westhampnett in 1943; it is now in the Goodwood collection on the same site.

===Normandy to the Rhine===
In the lead up to the Battle of Normandy and the D-Day landings Johnson continued to score regularly. His 22nd and 23rd victories were achieved on 25 April 1944 and Johnson became the highest scoring ace still on operations. These victories were followed by another Fw 190 on 5 May (no. 24); III./JG 26 lost &quot;Feldwebel&quot; Horst Schwentick and &quot;Unteroffizier&quot; Manfred Talkenberg killed during the air battle. After the landings in France on 6 June 1944, Johnson added further to his tally, claiming another five aerial victories that month including two Bf 109s on 28 June. The mission in which Johnson recorded his 26th victory on 22 June was particularly eventful; four more Fw 190s fell to his wing. After bouncing a formation of Bf 109s and Fw 190s, he shot down a Bf 109 for his 29th victory. Five days later, Johnson destroyed two Fw 190s to reach his 30th and 31st air victories.

Johnson&#x27;s wing was the first to be stationed on French soil following the invasion. With their radius of action now far extended compared to the squadrons still in Britain, the wing scored heavily through the summer. On 21 August 1944, Johnson was leading No. 443 Squadron on a patrol over the Seine, near Paris. Johnson bounced a formation of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s, shooting down two, which were recorded on the cine camera. Climbing back to his starting point at 8,000 ft, Johnson attempted to join a formation of six aircraft, he thought were Spitfires. The fighters were actually Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Johnson escaped by doing a series of steep climbs, during which he nearly stalled and blacked out. He eventually evaded the Messerschmitts, which had been trying to flank him on either side, while two more stuck to his tail. Johnson&#x27;s Spitfire IX was hit by enemy aircraft fire for the only time, taking cannon shells in the rudder and elevators. Johnson had now equalled and surpassed Sailor Malan&#x27;s record score of 32, shooting down two Fw 190s for his 32nd and 33rd air victories. However Johnson considered Malan&#x27;s exploits to be better. Johnson points out, when Malan fought (during 1940–41), he did so outnumbered, and had matched the enemy even then. Johnson said:

In September 1944 Johnson&#x27;s wing participated in support actions for Operation Market Garden in the Netherlands. On 27 September 1944, Johnson&#x27;s last victory of the war was over Nijmegen. His flight bounced a formation of nine Bf 109s, one of which Johnson shot down. During this combat Squadron Leader Henry &quot;Wally&quot; McLeod, of the Royal Canadian Air Force, and his squadron had joined Johnson. During this action McLeod went missing, possibly shot down by Siegfried Freytag of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 77 (Fighter Wing 77).

The wing rarely saw enemy aircraft for the remainder of the year. Only on 1 January 1945 did the Germans appear in large numbers, during Operation Bodenplatte to support their faltering attack in the Ardennes. Johnson witnessed the German attack on his wing&#x27;s airfield at Brussels–Melsbroek. He recalled the Germans seemed inexperienced and their shooting was &quot;atrocious&quot;. Johnson led a Spitfire patrol to prevent a second wave of German aircraft attacking but engaged no enemy aircraft, since there was no follow-up attack. From late January and through most of February, Johnson reduced his flying time.
In March 1945, Johnson patrolled as Operation Plunder and Operation Varsity pushed Allied armies into Germany. There was little sign of the Luftwaffe. Numerous ground-attack operations were carried out instead. On 26 March Johnson&#x27;s wing was relocated to Twente and he was promoted to group captain. Days later Johnson took command of No. 125 Wing. On 5 April, after returning from patrol in Spitfire Mk XIV MV268, he switched off the engine just as a Bf 109 flew overhead. Seeing the Spitfire, it turned in for an attack; Johnson took cover under his fighter while the airfield defences shot down the 109. On 16 April 1945 Johnson&#x27;s wing moved to RAF Celle in Germany.

During the last week of the war, Johnson&#x27;s squadron flew patrols over Berlin and Kiel as German resistance crumbled. During a flight over central Germany looking for jet fighters, Johnson&#x27;s squadron attacked Luftwaffe airfields. On one sortie, his unit strafed and destroyed 11 Bf 109s that were preparing to take off. On another sortie, an enemy transport was sighted, but took evasive action and retreated back to German held territory but Johnson&#x27;s pilots shot it down. On another occasion, Johnson intercepted a flight of four Fw 190s. The German fighters, however, waggled their wings to signal non-hostile intent and Johnson&#x27;s unit escorted them to an RAF airfield.

After the German capitulation in May 1945, Johnson relocated with his unit to Copenhagen, Denmark. Here, his association with the Belgian No. 350 Squadron RAF led him to be awarded the Croix de Guerre with Palm and the rank of officer of the Order of Léopold with Palms.

==Post-war==
Johnson was given a permanent commission by the RAF after the war initially as a squadron leader, on promotion to wing commander (his wartime rank) becoming OC Tactics at the Central Fighter Establishment at RAF West Raynham in Norfolk.

===Korean War and afterwards===
During an exchange posting to the US Air Force, in 1950 he served in the Korean War flying the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star, and later flew the North American F-86 Sabres with the US Air Force Tactical Air Command. Johnson did not leave any written record of his experiences but at the end of his tour received the US Air Medal and Legion of Merit.

In 1951, Johnson commanded a wing at RAF Fassberg, a station in the RAF Second Tactical Air Force in West Germany. In 1952, he was promoted to group captain and commanded RAF Wildenrath in West Germany until 1954. From 1954 to 1957 he was deputy director operations (DD(Ops)) at the Air Ministry in London. In 1956 his wartime memoir, &quot;Wing Leader&quot; was published. On 20 October 1957, Johnson became commanding officer of RAF Cottesmore in the UK, commanding a station operating the Victor V bomber. In 1960 he was promoted to air commodore and attended the Imperial Defence College (IDC) course in London and in June 1960 was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for his work as station commander at Cottesmore. After the course he was posted to the headquarters of No. 3 Group RAF of Bomber Command at RAF Mildenhall. On 1 October 1963 he was promoted to air vice marshal and served as air officer commanding (AOC) RAF Middle East based at Aden.

In 1964 he published his book &quot;Full Circle&quot;, a history of air fighting, co-written with Percy &quot;Laddie&quot; Lucas, a former Member of Parliament and Douglas Bader&#x27;s brother-in-law. In 1965 on retirement from the RAF he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB).

===Later life===
Johnson was a deputy lieutenant for the County of Leicestershire in 1967.
He established the Johnnie Johnson Housing Trust. In 1969 and by 2001 the housing association managed over 4,000 properties.

After the death of the WW2 RAF fighter pilot Douglas Bader in 1982, Johnson, Denis Crowley-Milling and Sir Hugh Dundas set up the Douglas Bader Foundation, to continue supporting disabled charities, of which Bader was a passionate supporter.

Johnson was also the first to recognise the skills of Robert Taylor, aviation artist, in the 1980s. Depictions of aircraft and battle scenes in print began to become popular and he helped Taylor promote them. The venture was successful and Johnson&#x27;s sons set up their own distribution networks in the United States and Britain.

Johnson spent most of the 1980s and 1990s as a keynote speaker, fundraiser and spending time on his hobbies; travelling, fishing, shooting and walking his dogs. Johnson appeared on the long–running British television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 8 May 1985, the 40th anniversary of VE Day. Among the programme&#x27;s guests was German fighter ace Walter Matoni. British wartime propaganda had alleged Johnson had challenged Matoni to a personal duel; a version of events denied by Johnson. The two men arranged to meet after the war but were unable to do so until the TV programme. Among other guests was Hugh Dundas, &quot;Nip&quot; Heppel, who flew alongside Johnson on his first operation—in which he earned a rebuke from Bader—Crowley-Milling, Johnson&#x27;s former wing commander Patrick Jameson and his uncle, Charlie Rossell who was over 100 years old at the time.

==Personal life==
As a teenager, Johnson became fascinated by speed and joined the Melton Car Club with two boyhood friends. Johnson enjoyed the lifestyle of cars and &quot;pacey women&quot;. Although he had many early interests, Johnson later settled and added to his family. On 14 November 1942, Johnson married Pauline Ingate in Norwich during home leave. Hugh Dundas acted as best man and Lord Beaverbrook&#x27;s son, Wing Commander Max Aitken also attended. During the war Pauline worked for the Fire Service. They had two sons: Michael (16 October 1944) and Chris (born 1 December 1946). After the couple split up, Johnson lived in Buxton, Derbyshire with his partner, Janet Partridge.

On 30 January 2001, Johnson, aged 85 years, died from cancer. A memorial service took place on 25 April 2001 at St Clement Danes and the hymns &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;I Vow to Thee, My Country&quot; were played. His children scattered his ashes on the Chatsworth estate in Derbyshire. The only memorial was a bench dedicated to him at his favourite fishing spot on the Monsall Dale area of the estate; the inscription reads &quot;In Memory of a Fisherman&quot;.

==List of air victories==
Johnson&#x27;s wartime record was 515 sorties flown, 34 aircraft claimed destroyed with a further seven shared destroyed (three and one shared victories), three probable destroyed, 10 damaged, and one shared, destroyed on the ground. All his victories were fighters. As a wing leader, Johnson was able to use his initials &quot;JE-J&quot; in place of squadron code letters. He scored the bulk of his victories flying two Mk IXs: &quot;EN398&quot;/JEJ in which he shot down 12 aircraft and shared five plus six and one shared damaged, while commanding the Kenley Wing; &quot;MK392&quot;/JEJ, an L.F Mk. IX, 12 aircraft plus one shared, destroyed on the ground. His last victory of the war was scored in this aircraft. Johnson ended the war flying a Mk XIVE, &quot;MV268&quot;/JEJ. His post-war mount was &quot;MV257&quot;/JEJ; it was the last Spitfire to carry his initials.

The ability to verify British claims against the British&#x27; main opponents in 1941 and 1942, JG 26 and JG 2, is very limited. Only two of the 30 volumes of War Diaries produced by JG 26 survived the war. Historian Donald Caldwell has attempted to use what limited German material is available to compare losses and air victory claims but acknowledges the lack of sources leave the possibility for error.

<doc id="684676" wikidata="Q864161" url="?curid=684676" title="The Dogfather">
<text>The Dogfather is an American series of 17 theatrical cartoon shorts produced by DePatie–Freleng Enterprises and distributed by United Artists between 1974 and 1976. It is the final theatrical cartoon series made by DePatie–Freleng.

== Plot ==
&quot;The Dogfather&quot; was a parody of &quot;The Godfather&quot;, but with canines as part of the Italian organized crime syndicate. It consists of the Dogfather (voiced by Bob Holt impersonating Marlon Brando) and his henchmen Pug (also Bob Holt) and Louie (voiced by Daws Butler).

The opening credits featured the Dogfather, speaking (and later singing) to the lyrics of a song entitled &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You an Offer You Can&#x27;t Refuse&quot;.

&quot;The Dogfather&quot; was later broadcast as part of the NBC Saturday morning cartoon series &quot;The Pink Panther and Friends&quot;.

== Filmography ==
== Revival ==
In 1993, &quot;The Dogfather&quot; was revived (and re-designed) as a recurring antagonist for &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;. The Dogfather was voiced by Joe Piscopo (except for &quot;It&#x27;s Just a Gypsy in My Soup&quot; where he was voiced by Jim Cummings), while Pug and Louie are voiced by Brian George and Jess Harnell.

== Remakes ==
Much like a number of DFE-produced cartoon shorts, about half of the &quot;Dogfather&quot; cartoons were remakes of &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoons from the 1950s that were directed by Freleng, which are listed below:
* The pilot episode (&quot;The Dogfather&quot;) was a remake of &quot;Tree For Two&quot; (1952).
* &quot;The Goose that Laid a Golden Egg&quot; was a remake of &quot;Golden Yeggs&quot; (1950).
* &quot;Heist and Seek&quot; was a remake of &quot;Bugsy and Mugsy&quot; (1957).
* &quot;Mother Dogfather&quot; was a remake of &quot;Stork Naked&quot; (1955).
* &quot;Saltwater Tuffy&quot; was a remake of &quot;Tugboat Granny&quot; (1956)
* &quot;Devilled Yeggs&quot; was a remake of &quot;Satan&#x27;s Waitin&#x27;&quot; (1954).
* &quot;Watch the Birdie&quot; was a remake of &quot;Dr. Jerkyll&#x27;s Hide&quot; (1954).
* &quot;M-O-N-E-Y Spells Love&quot; was a remake of &quot;Hare Trimmed&quot; (1953).
* &quot;Rock-a-Bye Maybe&quot; was a remake of &quot;Kit for Cat&quot; (1948).
* &quot;Eagle Beagles&quot; was a remake of &quot;Hare Lift&quot; (1952).
However, this was criticized by Charles Brubaker, the author of the website Cartoon Research, who pointed out that this made the series almost completely unoriginal and resulted in inferior versions of those Looney Tunes shorts.

<text>In the mathematical theory of directed graphs, a graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other vertex. The strongly connected components of a directed graph form a partition into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected. It is possible to test the strong connectivity of a graph, or to find its strongly connected components, in linear time (that is, Θ(&quot;V&quot; + &quot;E&quot;&amp;hairsp;)).

==Definitions==
A directed graph is called strongly connected if there is a path in each direction between each pair of vertices of the graph. That is, a path exists from the first vertex in the pair to the second, and another path exists from the second vertex to the first.
In a directed graph &quot;G&quot; that may not itself be strongly connected, a pair of vertices &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot; are said to be strongly connected to each other if there is a path in each direction between them.

The binary relation of being strongly connected is an equivalence relation, and the induced subgraphs of its equivalence classes are called strongly connected components.
Equivalently, a strongly connected component of a directed graph &quot;G&quot; is a subgraph that is strongly connected, and is maximal with this property: no additional edges or vertices from &quot;G&quot; can be included in the subgraph without breaking its property of being strongly connected. The collection of strongly connected components forms a partition of the set of vertices of &quot;G&quot;. A strongly connected component &quot;C&quot; is called &quot;trivial&quot; when &quot;C&quot; consists of a single vertex which is not connected to itself with an edge, and &quot;non-trivial&quot; otherwise.
If each strongly connected component is contracted to a single vertex, the resulting graph is a directed acyclic graph, the condensation of &quot;G&quot;. A directed graph is acyclic if and only if it has no strongly connected subgraphs with more than one vertex, because a directed cycle is strongly connected and every non-trivial strongly connected component contains at least one directed cycle.

==Algorithms==
===DFS-based linear-time algorithms===
Several algorithms based on depth-first search compute strongly connected components in linear time.
*Kosaraju&#x27;s algorithm uses two passes of depth-first search. The first, in the original graph, is used to choose the order in which the outer loop of the second depth-first search tests vertices for having been visited already and recursively explores them if not. The second depth-first search is on the transpose graph of the original graph, and each recursive exploration finds a single new strongly connected component. It is named after S. Rao Kosaraju, who described it (but did not publish his results) in 1978; Micha Sharir later published it in 1981.
*Tarjan&#x27;s strongly connected components algorithm, published by Robert Tarjan in 1972, performs a single pass of depth-first search. It maintains a stack of vertices that have been explored by the search but not yet assigned to a component, and calculates &quot;low numbers&quot; of each vertex (an index number of the highest ancestor reachable in one step from a descendant of the vertex) which it uses to determine when a set of vertices should be popped off the stack into a new component.
*The path-based strong component algorithm uses a depth-first search, like Tarjan&#x27;s algorithm, but with two stacks. One of the stacks is used to keep track of the vertices not yet assigned to components, while the other keeps track of the current path in the depth-first search tree. The first linear time version of this algorithm was published by Edsger W. Dijkstra in 1976.
Although Kosaraju&#x27;s algorithm is conceptually simple, Tarjan&#x27;s and the path-based algorithm require only one depth-first search rather than two.

===Reachability-based algorithms===

Previous linear-time algorithms are based on depth-first search which is generally considered hard to parallelize. Fleischer et al. in 2000 proposed a divide-and-conquer approach based on reachability queries, and such algorithms are usually called reachability-based SCC algorithms. The idea of this approach is to pick a random pivot vertex and apply forward and backward reachability queries from this vertex. The two queries partition the vertex set into 4 subsets: vertices reached by both, either one, or none of the searches. One can show that a strongly connected component has to be contained in one of the subsets. The vertex subset reached by both searches forms a strongly connected component, and the algorithm then recurses on the other 3 subsets.

The expected sequential running time of this algorithm is shown to be O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;), a factor of O(log &quot;n&quot;) more than the classic algorithms. The parallelism comes from: (1) the reachability queries can be parallelized more easily (e.g. by a breadth-first search (BFS), and it can be fast if the diameter of the graph is small); and (2) the independence between the subtasks in the divide-and-conquer process.
This algorithm performs well on real-world graphs, but does not have theoretical guarantee on the parallelism (consider if a graph has no edges, the algorithm requires O(&quot;n&quot;) levels of recursions).

Blelloch et al. in 2016 shows that if the reachability queries are applied in a random order, the cost bound of O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) still holds. Furthermore, the queries then can be batched in a prefix-doubling manner (i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8 queries) and run simultaneously in one round. The overall span of this algorithm is log2 &quot;n&quot; reachability queries, which is probably the optimal parallelism that can be achieved using the reachability-based approach.

===Generating random strongly connected graphs===

Peter M. Maurer describes an algorithm for generating random strongly connected graphs, based on a modification of an algorithm for strong connectivity augmentation, the problem of adding as few edges as possible to make a graph strongly connected. When used in conjunction with the Gilbert or Erdős-Rényi models with node relabelling, the algorithm is capable of generating any strongly connected graph on &quot;n&quot; nodes, without restriction on the kinds of structures that can be generated.

==Applications==
Algorithms for finding strongly connected components may be used to solve 2-satisfiability problems (systems of Boolean variables with constraints on the values of pairs of variables): as showed, a 2-satisfiability instance is unsatisfiable if and only if there is a variable &quot;v&quot; such that &quot;v&quot; and its negation are both contained in the same strongly connected component of the implication graph of the instance.

Strongly connected components are also used to compute the Dulmage–Mendelsohn decomposition, a classification of the edges of a bipartite graph, according to whether or not they can be part of a perfect matching in the graph.

==Related results==
A directed graph is strongly connected if and only if it has an ear decomposition, a partition of the edges into a sequence of directed paths and cycles such that the first subgraph in the sequence is a cycle, and each subsequent subgraph is either a cycle sharing one vertex with previous subgraphs, or a path sharing its two endpoints with previous subgraphs.

According to Robbins&#x27; theorem, an undirected graph may be oriented in such a way that it becomes strongly connected, if and only if it is 2-edge-connected. One way to prove this result is to find an ear decomposition of the underlying undirected graph and then orient each ear consistently.

<text>The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) is a UK-based examination board specialising in dance education and training, with an emphasis on classical ballet. The RAD was founded in London, England in 1920 as the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing, and was granted a Royal Charter in 1935. Queen Camilla is patron of the RAD, and Darcey Bussell was elected to serve as president in 2012, succeeding Antoinette Sibley who served for 21 years.

The RAD was created with the objective to improve the standard of ballet teaching in the UK. In pursuit of improving instruction, a new teaching method and dance technique was devised for the Academy by a group of eminent European dancers. The RAD is one of the largest dance organisations in the world with over 13,000 members in 85 countries, including about 7,500 who hold Registered Teacher Status. There are currently about 1,000 students in full-time or part-time teacher training programmes with the RAD, and each year about 250,000 candidates enter RAD examinations worldwide.

RAD exams are recognised by the national qualifications regulators of all four UK nations (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) with selected exams also carrying a UCAS tariff towards university admission. The RAD is also a validated awarding body of the Council for Dance Education and Training. The RAD works in partnership with the International Dance Teachers&#x27; Association. Royal Academy of Dance is charity 312826 registered in England and Wales.

==History==

=== 1920 ===
On 18 July 1920, Phillip J. S. Richardson, then Editor of &quot;Dancing Times&quot; magazine, organised a dinner for eminent dance professionals at the former Trocadero Restaurant in Piccadilly. The diners included five special guests, representing the principal methods of ballet training in use at that time.

* Phyllis Bedells – English Method
* Lucia Cormani – Italian Method
* Edouard Espinosa – French Method
* Adeline Genée – Bournonville Method, Denmark
* Tamara Karsavina – Imperial Method, Russia

Other guests included Ninette de Valois, the founder of England&#x27;s Royal Ballet company, and Anton Dolin, the co-founder of English National Ballet. The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the poor quality of dance training in Britain at that time and following further meetings, the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing of Great Britain was formed, with Adeline Genée as its first President. The Association would be the predecessor of the RAD.

=== 1921–1928 ===
In 1921, the Association established headquarters at the offices of &quot;Dancing Times&quot; magazine in London and the first Elementary, Intermediate and Advanced level examinations were held in the years that followed, with the first Children&#x27;s syllabus being published and then examined in 1923 and 1924. In 1927 a scholarship scheme was introduced for students studying dance with an Association member and in 1928, Queen Mary consented to become Patron of the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing.

=== 1930–1934 ===
In November 1930, the first issue of &quot;Dance Gazette&quot; was published containing a historical review of the Association&#x27;s first ten years. &#x27;Dance Gazette&#x27; is still the official magazine of the RAD, being distributed quarterly to all fully paid members. Since 2011, it is also available to buy in selected branches of WHSmith in the UK. In 1931, the first Genée International Ballet Competition for female dancers was held in London, with awards for male dancers being introduced later in 1939. The competition is the RAD&#x27;s flagship annual event, named after Dame Adeline Genée DBE. The competition was introduced as an additional incentive for candidates who had passed the Solo Seal examination, and has taken place almost every year since 1931, even during the Second World War. In 1934, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden agreed to an alliance with the Association and a Grand Council of men &amp; women was formed to act as a governing body to advise the executive committee.

=== 1935–1937 ===

In 1935 King George V approved the granting of a Royal Charter for the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing. The charter was eventually affixed with his Great Seal in 1936, and the Association of Teachers of Operatic Dancing officially became the &#x27;Royal Academy of Dancing&#x27; (RAD). The following year in 1937, a coat of arms was designed by the College of Arms in London.

====Coat of Arms====
The RAD coat of arts was granted by the College of Arms in 1937, designed by the Hon. George Bellew, Somerset Herald of 
Arms and Registrar. The crest at the top of the coat of arms is a figure of Terpsichore, one of the Muses from Greek mythology, representing dance. The supporter at either side of the shield is a winged doe, symbolising lightness and grace of movement. The Escutcheon shows a pentagram symbolising health, with a wavy and zigzag line conveying the movement of dancing. The motto &#x27;Salus et Felicitas&#x27; translates to mean health and happiness.

=== 1950–1954 ===
In 1950, founder President of the RAD Adeline Genée was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the New Year Honours List. Further honours were awarded to members of the Academy in 1951, with Ninette de Valois being appointed a Dame, Philip Richardson being awarded an Order of the British Empire (OBE) and Margot Fonteyn awarded a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). Following the death of Queen Mary in 1953, Queen Elizabeth II consented to become the Royal Patron of the Royal Academy of Dancing and Dame Adeline Genée instituted the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Award to mark the occasion. The award is presented annually in recognition of outstanding services to the art of ballet. The first recipient was Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of The Royal Ballet Company. The following is a list of selected recipients of the award.
*Phyllis Bedells, the first recognised English ballerina and a founder member of the RAD
*Tamara Karsavina, Russian ballerina, founder member of the RAD and vice-president for over 30 years
*Ninette De Valois, dancer, choreographer and director, founder of the Royal Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet and *Royal Ballet School
*Anton Dolin, dancer, choreographer and director, co-founder of the English National Ballet
*Marie Rambert, founder of the first professional dance company in the UK, which survives today as Rambert Dance Company
*Alicia Markova, English prima ballerina assoluta and co-founder of English National Ballet
*Beryl Grey, dancer and director, former RAD vice-president and life president of the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing
*Rudolph Nureyev, Russian dancer, choreographer, director and former artistic director of Paris Opera Ballet
*Frederick Ashton, founder choreographer and former artistic director of the Royal Ballet
*Robert Helpmann, Australian dancer, actor, choreographer and director, most famous for playing the Child Catcher in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang
*Gillian Lynne, former ballet dancer, most famous as a choreographer of West End and Broadway musicals including Cats
*Antoinette Sibley, former ballet dancer who served as President of the RAD from 1991 to 2012.

Dame Adeline Genée retired as President of the RAD in 1954 and Dame Margot Fonteyn was elected as her successor. The leading Principal dancer of the Royal Ballet at that time and considered the greatest Ballerina of her generation, Fonteyn was later appointed Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Royal Ballet by Queen Elizabeth II.

=== 1963–1968 ===
In 1963, the Academy was granted charitable status. In 1965, the first RAD summer school was held at Elmhurst Ballet School in Camberley, Surrey. Teachers and dancers attended the summer school from the United States, Canada, New Zealand as well as the UK. In 1968, Dame Margot Fonteyn devised a new children&#x27;s syllabus, which would become the basis for lower graded examinations.

=== 1970–1975 ===
On 23 April 1970, Founder President of the Academy, Dame Adeline Genée died at the age of 92 and in 1972, the RAD moved into its current headquarters in Battersea Square, London. The building was fully refurbished to provide high quality dance facilities and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1974. The following year in 1975, the Academy established the Professional Dancer&#x27;s Teaching Diploma, an intensive course for professional ballet dancers and other dance professionals to gain registered teacher status with the RAD and in 1976, the RAD&#x27;s teacher training schemes were organised into what is now officially the Faculty of Education of the RAD.

=== 1979 ===
In 1979, a new bursary was founded and named in honour of Phyllis Bedells, a founder member and former vice-president of the RAD. The bursary of £1,000 is held annually, awarded for further training in the academy&#x27;s method and is awarded to young dancers who are under 17 years of age and have passed RAD Advanced 1 with Distinction but have not entered for the Advanced 2 examination. Past winners have gone on to win medals in very high-profile competitions, such as the Genée International Ballet Competition, and to dance with world-renowned companies including the Australian Ballet, Dutch National Ballet, English National Ballet, London City Ballet, Maurice Béjart and The Royal Ballet. Payment of the Bursary can be offset against existing tuition fees where the winner may be studying, or against material / equipment needed for the winner to continue their training.

=== 1983 ===
In 1983, the RAD opened its first International headquarters in Darlinghurst, New South Wales, Australia. Since that time, the RAD has opened offices worldwide, including Brazil, China, Germany, Greece, Israel, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, United Arab Emirates and the United States of America,

=== 1990–1992 ===
In 1990, a new studio complex was opened at RAD headquarters. Titled the &#x27;Fonteyn Centre&#x27;, it was opened by Queen Elizabeth II. The following year in 1991, Dame Margot Fonteyn died on 21 February in Panama City and Antoinette Sibley was elected as the RAD&#x27;s third President. Also in 1991, the &#x27;Graded Examination Syllabus&#x27; was introduced, with Grades 6, 7 and 8 being introduced later in 1992. In 1990 the Faculty of Education was launched, which now delivers undergraduate and postgraduate university programmes of study and RAD awards (at higher education level). The three-year teacher training course was also amended in 1992, being replaced by the RAD&#x27;s first full-time Degree qualification, the BA (Hons) Art &amp; Teaching of Ballet (now the BA in Ballet Education).

=== 1995–1999 ===
The RAD celebrated its 75th anniversary in 1995, the event being marked by events throughout the world. In 1996, RAD President Antoinette Sibley was appointed a Dame in the Queen&#x27;s New Year Honours List and the Academy&#x27;s first 12-degree students attended their graduation at Durham Castle. In 1997, the Benesh Institute was incorporated into the RAD and in 1999, The &#x27;Faculty of Education&#x27; was established with further teaching qualifications being launched, validated by the University of Durham.

=== 2000 ===
On 20 December 2000, the RAD officially adopted its current title, &quot;Royal Academy of Dance&quot; and in the same year, qualifications were established for students studying &#x27;Benesh Movement Notation&#x27;.

=== 2010 ===
In 2010 the RAD became an Accredited Institute of the University of Surrey.

=== 2011 ===
On 4 January 2011 in London and 17 January in Sydney, the RAD launched its new Intermediate Foundation &amp; Intermediate syllabi. RAD Grades 1–8 and the first five levels of the Vocational Grades were accredited by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) in England with the RAD as an Awarding Organisation, and the Academy also achieved SQA Accreditation (Scottish Qualifications Authority Accreditation) for RAD exams. UCAS tariff points for Graded and Vocational Graded Examinations in Dance at Level 3 were confirmed in August, meaning those candidates who have achieved a Pass or higher at Grades 6–8, Intermediate or Advanced Foundation can use their exam result as contributing towards their points tariff when applying to a university or Higher Education institution in the UK. The Genée International Ballet Competition 2011 was held for the first time in Cape Town, South Africa, at Artscape Theatre Centre, looking to present the competition in New Zealand in 2012. The first ever Dance Proms took place on Sunday 13 November at the Royal Albert Hall, London, as a partnership project between the International Dance Teachers Association, the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, RAD and the Royal Albert Hall working together in celebration of dance and hosting more than 450 young dancers on the stage. UK and Republic of Ireland members from the three dance organisations were invited to video and submit a short dance piece online, and a variety of acts were then chosen both by an esteemed panel of professionals and through a public vote to perform live at the Royal Albert Hall.

=== 2024 ===
In May 2024, Queen Camilla became patron of the RAD.

== Examinations ==
The RAD offers two examination syllabi, which are suitable for both male and female students and form the basis of the RAD&#x27;s work in the UK and overseas. Each programme consists of a series of progressively more difficult practical examinations.
* Graded Examination Syllabus
* Vocational Graded Examination Syllabus
Grades 1–8 and the first five levels of the Vocational Grades are accredited by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual) in England, the Qualifications Wales in Wales and the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations &amp; Assessment (CCEA) in Northern Ireland. These organisations are the Government approved qualifications regulators for their respective countries. Candidates who successfully pass an RAD examination are awarded credit on the Qualifications and Credit Framework. The Academy also achieves SQA Accreditation (Scottish Qualifications Authority Accreditation) for RAD exams.

In 2009, the RAD launched a new syllabus at Pre-Primary and Primary level in dance. These two new grades replace the existing Pre-Primary and Primary grades in ballet. The Academy has since launched new work for grades 1–5

=== Graded Syllabus ===
The Graded Examination Syllabus consists of Pre-Primary, Primary, and numbered Grades 1–8. Each grade incorporates classical ballet, free movement and character dance. The syllabus is devised to progress in difficulty from one grade to the next and a student studying the grades in sequence would be expected to develop a greater degree of dance technique at each level.

* Classical Ballet is one of the most widespread dance forms in the world. Originating in the Italian royal courts of the Renaissance period, over hundreds of years it has been developed into a highly technical dance form. Ballet is the foundation of the RAD&#x27;s work and is the most important part of the Graded Syllabi.
* Free Movement is the term applied to movement from dance styles such as natural movement, contemporary and Classical Greek dance. Free movement does not have to include codified dance vocabulary and is usually an improvisation based on the students interpretation of a piece of music or stimulus.
* Character Dance is an integral part of classical ballet repertoire. It is the stylised representation of a traditional folk dance, normally from a European country and uses movements and music which have been adapted for the theatre. The RAD syllabus uses character dances based on Hungarian, Russian and Polish folk dance.

Students who have studied a complete grade from the syllabus will normally take an examination organised by their dance teacher and held at the teachers studio or a suitable venue hired for the occasion. In the examination, the students perform the relevant grade work for an RAD examiner, who assesses the artistic and technical execution of the grade. A successful candidate receives a certificate printed with their name and the grade passed. They also receive a report detailing what marks were awarded and highlighting which aspects of their performance need further improvement. Unsuccessful candidates receive a report and a certificate of participation. The Pre-Primary grade is devised for younger students who are not old enough to enter the Primary examination. There is no examination offered at this level, however students can take part in a Presentation Class.

Presentation Classes were introduced for students who a dance teacher feels may not benefit from, or be suitable for taking the series of examinations. In a Presentation Class, in contrast to an examination, the teacher and a small audience of spectators are present in the room. The students perform for an examiner but are not assessed. They dance a condensed selection of exercises from the appropriate grade and receive a certificate of participation, which is normally presented by the examiner at the end of the class.

As a syllabus devised specifically with children in mind, examinations are not compulsory. The entry level of a new student is decided by the dance teacher based upon the child&#x27;s age, natural ability for dance or previous examination passes with another dance school or examination board, such as the IDTA or ISTD.

==== Grades ====
The Grades are:
* Pre-Primary – 5 years and over
* Primary – 6 years and over
* Grade 1 – 7 years and over
* Grade 2 – 7 years and over
* Grade 3 – 7 years and over
* Grade 4 – 7 years and over
* Grade 5 – 7 years and over
* Grade 6 – 11 years and over
* Grade 7 – 11 years and over 
* Grade 8 – 11 years and over

=== Vocational Graded Syllabus ===
The Vocational Graded Syllabus is designed primarily for older children or young adults who are considering a career in professional dance, as a performer, teacher or in another capacity. The vocational syllabus is technically demanding and comprises only Classical Ballet and Pointe Work. Students choosing to study this series of awards are required to be competent in the fundamentals of ballet technique and movement vocabulary.

Unlike the Graded Examination Syllabus, the vocational grades have to be studied in sequence and the student must successfully pass an examination at each level before progressing onto the next. All vocational examinations are organised by RAD headquarters and instead of being held at a dance teachers own venue, they are held in major cities worldwide. In this situation, the session organiser is responsible for timetabling the examinations, and it is normal for students to dance alongside the students of other dance schools in the examination room. As with the graded syllabus, successful candidates receive a certificate personalised with their name and the level passed. They also receive a report, however for this series of examinations, there is a different marking system and assessment criteria.

Students studying the vocational syllabus are expected to achieve a high level of technical and artistic ability in ballet and it can take a great deal of time and commitment to reach the standard required to pass these examinations. Normally, a student will begin studying the Vocational Graded Syllabus after completing Grade 5 in the Graded Examination Syllabus, however some students will continue to study the graded syllabus at the same time. The Intermediate Foundation and Advanced Foundation examinations are the only optional exams in this series of awards. They are devised for students who the teacher feels may need more preparation before studying at the higher level, however they are assessed in the same way, certificates awarded in the same way and credits awarded on the National Qualifications Framework.

====The Vocational Grades====
* Intermediate Foundation – 11 years and over (non-compulsory)
* Intermediate – 12 years and over
* Advanced Foundation – 13 years and over (non-compulsory)
* Advanced 1 – 14 years and over (must have passed Intermediate)
* Advanced 2 – 15 years and over (must have passed Advanced 1)
* Solo Seal – 15 years and over (must have passed Advanced 2 with distinction)

==LRAD==

The Licentiate of the Royal Academy of Dance (LRAD) is a programme to allow students who already have, or are in the process of finishing, qualifications for a dance degree, to specialise in Royal Academy of Dance work. It has no practical placement component, but instead comprises &quot;intensive practical study supported by lectures, presentations, peer teaching and seminars&quot;.

==RAD Method==
The RAD method, is a ballet technique and training system, specially devised by the founders of the RAD, who merged their respective dance methods (Italian, French, Danish and Russian) to create a new style of ballet that is unique to the organisation. The RAD method produces a style of ballet that has become recognised internationally as the English style of ballet.

The most identifiable aspect of the RAD method is the attention to detail when learning the basic steps, and the progression in difficulty is often very slow. While the difficulty of an exercise may only increase slightly from grade to grade, more importance is placed on whether the student is performing the step with improved technique. For example, plie exercises are employed consistently throughout the lower grades to enable the student to progressively deepen the plie and improve turnout. The principle behind this is that if enough time is spent achieving optimal technique before introducing new vocabulary, the easier it is for the student to learn the harder steps, while exercising basic technique to the maximum at all times.

== Associations ==
From 1 October 2006, the RAD began a new association with the International Dance Teachers Association, a dance organisation based in Brighton, England. A press release issued to members of each organisation stated that &quot;the two organisations would embark on a process of working together for the future of dance and to the mutual benefit of their members in both teacher education and training and examinations&quot;.

As a result of this association, both organisations have formally granted teachers of the respective organisation the opportunity to enter candidates for its examinations thereby ensuring that both organisations recognise the right of qualified teachers to enter candidates for examinations of either awarding body. At the RAD these members are called &#x27;teachers recognised by mutual agreement&#x27;. Whilst the new association is not a merger, it is intended that it will develop co-operation between the two organisations and mutual recognition of the training and qualifications that they both provide.

Dance Proms is a partnership project between the IDTA, the ISTD, RAD and the Royal Albert Hall working together in celebration of dance. In 2011, Dance Proms hosted more than 450 young dancers on the stage, showcasing a huge range of dance styles and cultural influences. UK and Republic of Ireland members from the three dance organisations are invited to video and submit a short dance piece online, featuring original choreography by themselves or their students in any dance genre, either as a solo, duet, or group performance. Acts are then chosen both by an esteemed panel of professionals and through a public vote to be performed live at the Royal Albert Hall. Dance Proms is designed to showcase the high standards of dance and dance teaching of the organisations and their members, and to raise standards and increase participation in and appreciation of dance in the UK.

<text>The glass cliff is a hypothesized phenomenon in which women are more likely to break the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; (i.e. achieve leadership roles in business and government) during periods of crisis or downturn when the risk of failure is highest. Other research has expanded the definition of the glass cliff phenomenon to include racial and ethnic minority groups.

== Origins ==
The term was coined in 2005 by British professors Michelle K. Ryan and Alexander Haslam of University of Exeter, United Kingdom. In a study, Ryan and Haslam examined the performance of FTSE 100 companies before and after the appointment of new board members, and found that companies that appointed women to their boards were likelier than others to have experienced consistently bad performance in the preceding five months. This work eventually developed into the identification of a phenomenon known as the glass cliffanalogous to the concept of a glass ceiling, but implying the inability to perceive the dangers of the cliff&#x27;s transparent edge rather than the false promise of elevated organizational positions which can be &quot;seen&quot; through a ceiling of glass but which are actually unattainable. Since the term originated, its use has expanded beyond the corporate world to also encompass politics and other domains.

== Overview ==
Ryan and Haslam&#x27;s research showed that once women break through the glass ceiling and take on positions of leadership, they often have experiences that are different from those of their male counterparts. More specifically, women are more likely to occupy positions that are precarious and thus have a higher risk of failure—either because they are appointed to lead organizations (or organizational units) that are in crisis or because they are not given the resources and support needed for success.

Extending the metaphor of the glass ceiling, Ryan and Haslam evoked the notion of the &quot;glass cliff&quot; to refer to a danger which involves exposure to risk of falling but which is not readily apparent. CEO tenure is typically shorter at companies which are struggling, compared to those which are stable.

Evidence of the glass cliff phenomenon has been documented in the field of law. A 2006 study found law students were much likelier to assign a high-risk case to a female lead counsel rather than a male one. A 2010 study found undergraduate students in British political science likelier to select a male politician to run for a safe seat in a by-election, and much likelier to select a female candidate when the seat was described as hard to get. A 2014 analysis of US Fortune 500 leadership found that firms with weak performance were likely to promote women into CEO positions over white men.

Additional studies have found that women are likely to be primed as candidates in hard-to-win districts. Specifically in the United Kingdom, women of the Conservative Party are more likely selected by party elites to run in less winnable seats than conservative men, though they performed worse than men in elections. This occurs both with experienced and inexperienced women candidates, and those with both conventional and nonconventional political backgrounds, indicating a glass cliff phenomenon as opposed to any other explanation. Though the Conservative Party has begun to incorporate equality guarantee strategies, women candidates are still often specifically posed as candidates in hard to win districts.

In contrast, a 2007 study of corporate performance preceding CEO appointments showed that women executives are no more likely to be selected for precarious leadership positions than males.

== Explanation ==
Many theories have been advanced to explain the existence of the glass cliff.

University of Houston psychology professor Kristin J. Anderson says companies may offer glass cliff positions to women because they consider women &quot;more expendable and better scapegoats.&quot; She says the organizations that offer women tough jobs believe they win either way: if the woman succeeds, the company is better off. If she fails, the company is no worse off, she can be blamed, the company gets credit for having been egalitarian and progressive, and can return to its prior practice of appointing men.

Haslam and Ryan&#x27;s initial studies indicate that people believe women are better-suited to lead stressed, unhappy companies because they are felt to be more nurturing, creative, and intuitive. These researchers argue that female leaders are not necessarily expected to improve the situation, but are seen as good people managers who can take the blame for organizational failure.

Haslam has shown that women executives are likelier than men to accept glass cliff positions because they do not have access to the high-quality information and support that would ordinarily warn executives away. Additional research has indicated that women and other minorities view risky job offers as the only chance they are likely to get.

A 2007 study found that female news consumers in the United Kingdom were likelier than male ones to accept that the glass cliff exists and is dangerous and unfair to women executives. Female study participants attributed the existence of the glass cliff to a lack of other opportunities for women executives, sexism, and men&#x27;s in-group favoritism. Male study participants said that women are less suited than men to difficult leadership roles or strategic decision-making, or that the glass cliff is unrelated to gender.

Additional research has suggested that women see precarious glass cliff opportunities as the only chances for advancement. While men may view the same opportunities as risky, women candidates might be more willing to accept these positions out of necessity for career advancement purposes. Additionally, women are more likely than men to maintain their positions at any level during times of crisis, making them more readily available for advancement opportunities during times of crisis than male counterparts.

Women with traditionally feminine traits are sought out in times of crisis due to a perceived ability to better handle employee issues. Stereotypically feminine traits, including creativity, helpfulness and awareness of emotion are all associated with better being able to handle failure. Though these traits generally diminish the desirability of women for leadership positions, in times of crisis they are viewed as valuable assets that aid in leadership changes. These skill sets offer opportunities for non-traditional leadership styles, viewed favorably in times of crisis.

Glass cliff situations are likely only to arise under certain conditions, in which women leaders have access to resources they view as favorable to leaders. Research has indicated that in times of crisis, women view leadership positions with a greater amount of social resources more positively than they do positions lacking in social resources. However, they view positions lacking financial resources equally as positively as those with a wide range of social resources.

== Glass cliff for racial and ethnic minority leaders ==
The glass cliff concept has also been used to describe employment discrimination experienced by leaders who are members of minorities or disabled.

Research analyzing the head coaches of NCAA sports teams found that men of racial and ethnic minority groups were promoted to higher leadership positions in times of crisis. Within historically Black colleges and universities, minority leaders were more often appointed than white leaders under all circumstances, but in other universities, minority leaders were appointed to leadership positions primarily in times of crisis. These leaders are also likely to suffer from high visibility, scrutiny and performance pressures that their white counterparts do not receive. The study also found evidence for the savior effect, the idea that organizations will look for &quot;saviors&quot;, usually white, when minority leaders are unable to deliver high-quality performance results in times of crisis.

Outside of the NCAA, this has occurred in the political sphere. Often times, the 2008 election of Barack Obama, the first Black president of the United States of America, in the midst of a global financial crisis is viewed as evidence of the glass cliff phenomenon for racial and ethnic minority groups. 

In British politics, research has indicated that the Conservative Party sent Black and minority ethnic candidates to contest parliamentary seats that are harder to win than other candidates, indicating similar findings other research on the political glass cliff for women candidates. This phenomenon is specific, however, to the Conservative Party, which has traditionally promoted anti-immigration sentiments that may contribute to this. The rise of Rishi Sunak as the United Kingdom&#x27;s first prime minister of South Asian heritage, following scandals that brought down two prime ministers within a year, was described as an example of the glass cliff effect.

Minority women face a duplicated glass cliff, being affected by both their gender and race. Black women are often given unsustainable amounts of work in higher positions, creating barriers in their careers. It has additionally been argued Black women may be promoted to leadership positions due to outdated stereotypes related to masculine traits Black women are perceived to have. In addition to struggles related to leadership, Black women are also likely to face an added weight of microaggressions and increased questioning of qualifications.

== Implications for women and minority group executives ==
Glass cliff positions risk hurting the women executives&#x27; reputations and career prospects because, when a company does poorly, people tend to blame its leadership without taking into account situational or contextual variables. Additionally, women who are appointed to glass cliff positions may be subject to increased criticism from shareholders, who may lack confidence in their leadership. In contrast, Men who assume leadership in times of crisis are less likely to experience this backlash, and suffer fewer reputation based consequences. Researchers have found that female leaders find it harder than male ones to get second chances once they have failed due to having fewer mentors and sponsors and less access to a protective &quot;old boys&#x27; network&quot;.

The glass cliff phenomenon adds to the breadth of work on why women are less likely than men to succeed in leadership positions across a wide range of opportunities, from local school districts to the corporate sphere. As a method of descriptive representation, women who see women leaders disposed of as a result of glass cliff leadership may be less likely to see themselves in positions of power, and be less likely to express interest in career advancement.

However, some researchers argue that companies in bad situations offer more opportunities for power and influence compared with companies that are stable.

A study examining glass cliff effects on women leaders in Turkey, a country which has high levels of femininity, found that the preference for female candidates was higher in times of good performance than in times of poor performance. Additional research has affirmed this finding in other countries.

== Examples ==
News media have described the following as examples of the glass cliff.

=== Political examples ===
* In 1990, two female Premiers were appointed in Australia: Joan Kirner inherited a significant deficit in Victoria, while Carmen Lawrence headed a party that had previously been accused of corruption. In 2009, Kristina Keneally was appointed Premier of New South Wales amid low polling for her party and their eventual defeat in 2011. Julia Gillard was appointed as Australia&#x27;s first female prime minister and subsequently ousted amid procedural complaints about the leadership spill.
* In 1993, the Canadian Progressive Conservative Party, facing low approval ratings and almost assured loss in the upcoming general elections, elected Kim Campbell, then Defense Minister, to replace Brian Mulroney as its leader. The election dealt the Progressive Conservatives the most devastating defeat in Canadian history, reducing them from 156 seats to 2.
* In 2009, Indonesian Finance Minister Sri Mulyani was accused of misappropriating the country&#x27;s funds to conduct an alleged unauthorized bailout for Bank Century a year prior which was failing at the time. She contested that the Rp. 6.7 trillion ($710 million) bailout was necessary, in order to prevent the country&#x27;s economy from crashing and received a warning of the bank&#x27;s impending failure from the central bank. She decided to resign as finance minister in 2010 after 5 years and 7 months in office during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&#x27;s presidency, keeping the country&#x27;s economy stable during the world financial crisis.
* In 2010, Dilma Rousseff was appointed candidate for president of Brazil by the Partido dos Trabalhadores (Workers&#x27; Party) when they were being investigated by the Federal Police for allegations of corruption schemes. She won the presidential election and was reelected for a second term in 2014. She was then impeached in 2016.
* In 2016, Theresa May became leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom shortly after a referendum result to leave the EU caused the pound to drop in value to levels not seen in 30+ years.
* In 2020, Agnès Buzyn replaced Benjamin Griveaux as the LREM candidate for Mayor of Paris, after the initial candidate&#x27;s alleged sexts with a woman were leaked.
*In 2020, Chrystia Freeland was appointed as Canada&#x27;s first female federal finance minister during the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Her appointment to minister of finance was a direct result of former minister Bill Morneau&#x27;s WE Charity Scandal.
*In 2021, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was tapped to lead the response to challenges at the southern border, which has historically been a significant and polarized issue in American politics.
*In 2022, Liz Truss became leader of the Conservative Party and Prime Minister of the United Kingdom following Boris Johnson&#x27;s resignation after a government crisis, and amid a surge in global inflation and the domestic cost of living. She resigned on her fiftieth day in office, following a second government crisis.
*In 2024, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris was nominated as the Democratic party candidate in the 2024 presidential election following President Biden&#x27;s withdrawal from the race.

=== Corporate and business examples ===
* In 2002, then-unprofitable telecommunications company Lucent Technologies appointed Patricia Russo CEO, and then replaced her with Ben Verwaayen.
* In 2008 after the Icelandic banking crisis, various women were appointed to repair the industry with the rationale that broader perspectives would prevent the same mistakes from occurring.
* In 2011, &quot;a horrible time for newspapers&quot;, Jill Abramson was appointed editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and in 2014 she was fired.
* In 2012, Marissa Mayer was appointed as the CEO of Yahoo after it lost significant market share to Google.
* In 2015, Ellen Pao resigned amidst controversy after several months as CEO of Reddit. Much of the furore was directed at the firing of popular Reddit employee Victoria Taylor, though former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong revealed that this was the decision of cofounder Alexis Ohanian, not Pao.
*In 2021, Alexis George was appointed as the CEO of the troubled Australian financial services company AMP Limited.
*In 2021, Jen Oneal was appointed the first female lead of Blizzard Entertainment after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing v. Activision Blizzard lawsuit which alleged the company had a culture of sexual misconduct.&lt;br&gt;Following Activision Blizzard&#x27;s acquisition by Microsoft in 2023, Johanna Faries, the general manager of the &quot;Call of Duty&quot; series, was named Blizzard Entertainment&#x27;s new president effective on February 5, 2024. Faries&#x27; appointment was a significant change for Blizzard Entertainment, whose leaders have in the past come up through the ranks of gaming and tech.
*In 2023, Linda Yaccarino was appointed as the CEO of Twitter while the company was facing an uncertain future and a number of challenges, including outages, user discontent and advertiser skepticism. The company lost more than half of its value since its acquisition by Elon Musk six months prior.

<text>The Dawn Parade were a British rock band from Bury St Edmunds formed in 2000. Greg McDonald was the main songwriter, and also provided vocals and guitar.

The band performed 200 gigs in the UK and received critical acclaim from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and John Peel, for the latter of whom the band performed a number of live sessions.

==Biography==
In 1998 friends from Thurston Community College, Greg McDonald, Nick Morley, Tom Weller and Ben Jennings formed a band, The Hip Down. The band played a small festival as their debut performance and later recorded a ten track demo at Meadowside Studios in Wisbech. Shortly into 1999 Weller departed to University, leaving the band without a permanent bassist. In late 1999, singer-songwriter Seymour Glass briefly joined on bass before leaving to front another local band, Miss Black America.

Auditioning many bass players and managing to win a local band competition covering &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, they formed a new incarnation of the band in 2001, with Rob Brown (guitar) and Dave Jago (bass) under the new name The Dawn Parade. The band&#x27;s name came from McDonald&#x27;s term for his walk back to his village on a Monday morning as the sun came up, having spent the money needed for a taxi home in bars the previous night. The new band played several shows and recorded a self-funded, self-titled debut EP, which the band distributed themselves. Shortly before the release of the EP, Jago left to concentrate on his own project, grindcore band Becky Jago, and was replaced by the longstanding permanent bassist Barney Wade.

Several months later the band made an appearance on an early form of internet television station &#x27;MP3TV&#x27; which led them to finally releasing their first official single, &quot;Good Luck Olivia&quot;, under the station&#x27;s show host Susan Hyatt&#x27;s Not Your Common Records. Then came their second, &quot;Hole in my Heart&quot;, in 2002 via the Cambridge based independent record label, Repeat Records, leading the band to tour extensively around the UK for six weeks. Soon after this the band recorded its first Peel Session. The second took place in March 2003, live with a studio audience at BBC Maida Vale (MV4). The band further gigged extensively across the country until July 2003, when Morley, Jennings and Wade decided to leave and focus on their own musical projects, such as the Brighton based ‘Enid Blitz’.

The band re-formed with a new line-up of McDonald on guitar and vocals, Jeremy Jones (lead guitar), Neil Rayson (bass guitar), Mark Sewell (drums, vocals) and Claire Pruden (backing vocals). Rayson was soon replaced by Steve McLoughlin. The first single of this lineup was &quot;The Fortune Line&quot;. The band changed its name to The Visions in late 2005, shortly after finishing recording their debut album in Wales with producer Chris Brown. By August 2006 the band split and finally released their debut album in November 2006 on Repeat Records under their original name The Dawn Parade.

Following the Dawn Parade&#x27;s split, McDonald continued as a solo artist; he has, to date, recorded two full-length solo albums, partly in collaboration with former Hip Down/Dawn Parade members Jeremy Jones, Nick Morley and Seymour Glass (credited as Seymour Patrick) and continues to play live throughout the UK.

<doc id="684688" wikidata="Q1689569" url="?curid=684688" title="Jing (Chinese medicine)">
<text>Jing () is the Chinese word for &quot;essence&quot;, specifically Kidney essence. Along with &quot;qi&quot; and &quot;shen&quot;, it is considered one of the Three Treasures of traditional Chinese medicine.

==Description==

According to Traditional Chinese Medical theory, &quot;jing&quot; or &quot;essence&quot; can be summarised in two parts: the Yin, being congenital or prenatal, and the Yang, being postnatal or acquired. Prenatal &quot;jing&quot; is acquired at birth from the parents: the father&#x27;s sperm and the mother&#x27;s ovum. This is a similar concept to DNA. Postnatal &quot;jing&quot; is acquired after birth through food, water, oxygen, as well as environmental and social conditions—very much like the concept of epigenetics. The concept is expounded in the Chinese theoretical cosmological treatise called the Bagua and within the &quot;I Ching&quot;.

The Yin and Yang &quot;jing&quot; transform to create and replenish each other. The Yang &quot;jing&quot; circulates through the eight extraordinary vessels and transforms to become and replenish yin; in turn the marrow becomes blood, body fluid and semen.

&quot;Jing&quot; should not be confused with the related concept of &quot;jin&quot; (; &quot;strength&quot; or &quot;energy&quot;), as in &quot;Neijin&quot; meaning &quot;internal power&quot;, nor with &quot;jīng&quot; (; &quot;classic&quot;), which appears in many early Chinese book titles, such as the &quot;Huangdi Neijing&quot;, &quot;Yijing&quot;, and &quot;Chajing&quot;.

The characteristics which constitute signs of good &quot;jing&quot; (e.g. facial structure, teeth, hair, vitality of adrenals or Kidneys) share the embryological origin of neural crest cells. These cells undergo immense and challenging cellular migrations requiring great organisation. As such, &quot;jing&quot; may simply represent the drive of embryological self-organization in the organism. This will be manifested most strongly in those cells which require most organization; that is, the neural crest cells.

==Allocation==
One is said to be born with a fixed amount of &quot;jing&quot; (prenatal &quot;jing&quot; is sometimes called &quot;yuanqi&quot;) and also can acquire &quot;jing&quot; from food and various forms of stimulation (exercise, study, meditation).

Theoretically, &quot;jing&quot; is consumed continuously in life; by everyday stress, illness, substance abuse, sexual intemperance, etc.

Prenatal &quot;jing&quot; is very difficult to be renewed, and it is said it is completely consumed upon dying.

==Restoration==
&quot;Jing&quot; is therefore considered quite important for longevity in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM); many disciplines related to qigong are devoted to the replenishment of &quot;lost&quot; &quot;jing&quot; by restoration of the post-natal &quot;jing&quot; and transformation of &quot;shen&quot;. In particular, the internal martial arts tai chi, the Circle Walking of Baguazhang and the middle path of Wuxingheqidao may be used to preserve pre-natal &quot;jing&quot; and build post-natal &quot;jing&quot;, if performed correctly. In Traditional Chinese herbal medicine Ginseng is widely used to bolster and support the &quot;jing&quot; or Essence.

An early mention of the term in this sense is in a 4th-century BCE chapter called &quot;Neiye&quot; &quot;Inner Training&quot; of a larger text compiled during the Han dynasty, the &quot;Guanzi&quot;.

<text>Richard Hodges, (born 29 September 1952) is a British archaeologist and past president of the American University of Rome. A former professor and director of the Institute of World Archaeology at the University of East Anglia (1996–2007), Hodges is also the former Williams Director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia (October 2007- 2012). His published research primarily concerns trade and economics during the early part of the Middle Ages in Europe. His earlier works include &quot;Dark Age Economics&quot; (1982), &quot;Mohammed, Charlemagne and the Origins of Europe&quot; (1983) and &quot;Light in the Dark Ages: The Rise and Fall of San Vincenzo Al Volturno&quot; (1997).

==Academic career==

Hodges&#x27;s academic career has focussed upon the archaeology of the later Roman world and the early Middle Ages in western Europe. Many of his excavations and publications have highlighted the transformation of classical antiquity and the birth of Europe. Beginning with Dark Age Economics (1982), he reviewed the changing regional patterns of urban phenomena especially emporia in the making of north-west Europe. Following this, with David Whitehouse, in Mohammed, Charlemagne and the Origins of Europe (1983), he reappraised Henri Pirenne&#x27;s celebrated historical thesis about the collapse of antiquity and the rise of Europe in the Carolingian age. Perhaps his most significant contribution to this theme was the 18-year (198098) excavations at San Vincenzo al Volturno, an Italian Benedictine monastery of the Carolingian renaissance, where together with the art historian, John Mitchell, the history and culture was unearthed and set within a European context. In the many reports on these excavations the architectural history and the art history, including well preserved cycles of paintings in the crypt of San Vincenzo Maggiore, were situated within the changing social and economic circumstances of 9th-century Italy.

Hodges pursued a similar approach at the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Butrint, the Graeco-Roman town in southern Albania, where over 20 years (1993-2012) representing the Butrint Foundation (Lords Rothschild and Sainsbury), and partnering with the Packard Humanities Institute, he developed a large-scale research programme (with many publications) and a concurrent cultural heritage programme. The project examined all archaeological periods at this site, including the formerly unknown Middle Byzantine periods.

As of 201520 Hodges is the principal investigator of a European Research Council project known as nEU-Med (no. 670792) with the University of Siena entitled &#x27;The creation of economic and monetary union (7th to 12th centuries): mining, landscapes and political strategies in a Mediterranean region&#x27;. This project involves excavations at Vetricella, a complex 9th- to 11th- century elite site near Scarlino, a study of Portus Scabris on the Tyrrhenian Sea, environmental and archaeological studies of the Pegora valley corridor, and a major analysis of Italian early Medieval silver coinage with a view to identifying silver extracted from the Colline Metallifere.

Throughout his career Hodges has written articles for public audiences. Foremost amongst these are his bi-monthly column for &quot;Current World Archaeology&quot;, a collection of which has been published as &quot;Travels with an Archaeologist&quot; (2017).

==Academic management==

As a lecturer at Sheffield University (1976–88) Hodges created the Roystone Grange Archaeological Trail (1988-87). This teaching exercise, with the Peak District National Park, was intended as an innovative heritage feature in the National Park. A second teaching project focussed upon the Montarrenti project (1982–87), with Siena University and the Province of Siena. This was designed as a programme to make a park using the castle with its Romanesque to Renaissance tower-houses as well as the associated lost village.

As Director of the British School at Rome (1988–95) Hodges was faced with running an institution as government policy on higher education was being radically changed. He oversaw reforms of the institutional structures (charter, committees, staffing, programmes etc.) with a prominent emphasis upon activity-led projects aimed at raising the School&#x27;s profile and winning support for refurbishing the it building (originally constructed by Sir Edwin Lutyens). Among the initiatives during his administration were the creation of an art gallery and an active archaeological unit. He also oversaw the refurbishment of the School&#x27;s celebrated neo-classical façade with funds from the British government. During this period Hodges also wrote &quot;Visions of Rome&quot; (2000), a biography of the School&#x27;s third director, the archaeologist, Thomas Ashby.

As Director at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Institute (1996–98) Hodges was charged with its re-positioning because it was attracting academic and journalistic criticism. He worked with two chairmen to reduce the trustees to a small working group, and then tackled the academic programme with reviews, and concurrently began the process of re-establishing the Institute within the Prince&#x27;s group of trusts devoted to sustainability and the built environment.

As a professor in the School of World Art Studies, University of East Anglia, Norwich (19952007) Hodges set up a research institute, the Institute of World Archaeology (1996-2007). This was conceived as a research constellation with an emphasis upon cultural heritage activity. The main projects were in Albania and involved the making of a sustainable archaeological park at Butrint, as well as creating a post-communist archaeological community in serving a transition economy.

During this period, Hodges was supported by the Open Foundation to be international adviser in Tirana to the Albanian Minister of Culture, Edi Rama. Hodges also advised the Packard Humanities Institute on archaeological and other projects, notably the rescue excavations of the Roman city of Zeugma, Turkey, the conservation of Herculaneum, and the research and conservation of Chersonesos in the Crimea (Ukraine).

As Williams Director of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (2007–12) Hodges, at the request of the university&#x27;s Provost, embarked upon a programme to create a modern museum accessible to Penn students and to K-12 schoolchildren and Philadelphians. Restructuring the museum involved re-positioning the research staff, modernizing the curatorial and exhibition programmes, as well as changing the education, catering, marketing and gallery programmes. This led to a successful campaign to refurbish the Museum&#x27;s West Wing, to install new teaching facilities, to install new travelling exhibition galleries, and to implement a digital programme to put the museum&#x27;s international collections online.

As President of the American University of Rome (2012–present) Hodges has established a new mission for the university, promoting it as primarily a 4-year international university in the liberal arts, business administration and international relations. Giving it a new identity of working with international academics, and, in effect, beginning an overhaul of every aspect of the university, the university is on course to become a major accredited American university in the Mediterranean region.

Hodges has also served as a specialist archaeological consultant to the York Archaeological Trust for the Roşia Montană gold mines in Romania (2014), and to the Norwegian power company, Statkraft in the Devoll valley dams, Albania (2016).

<doc id="684690" wikidata="Q259948" url="?curid=684690" title="Benesh Movement Notation">
<text>Benesh Movement Notation (BMN), also known as Benesh notation or choreology, is the literacy of body language, it is a dance and movement notation system used to document dance and other types of human movement. Invented by Joan and Rudolf Benesh in the late 1940s, the system uses abstract symbols based on figurative representations of the human body. It is used in choreography and physical therapy, and by the Royal Academy of Dance to teach ballet.

Benesh notation is recorded on a five-line staff from left to right, with vertical bar lines to mark the passage of time. Because of its similarity to modern staff music notation, Benesh notation can be displayed alongside (typically below) and in synchronisation with musical accompaniment.

==History==
Benesh Movement Notation was created by Joan Benesh and her husband Rudolph Benesh. In 1955, Rudolf Benesh publicly introduced Benesh notation as an &quot;aesthetic and scientific study of all forms of human movement by movement notation&quot;. In 1997, the Benesh Institute (an organisation focused on Benesh notation) merged with the Royal Academy of Dance.

==Notation system==
Benesh notation plots the position of a dancer as seen from behind as if the dancer is superimposed on a staff that extends from the top of the head down to the feet. From top to bottom, the five lines of the staff coincide with the head, shoulders, waist, knees and feet. Additional symbols are used to notate the . A &quot;frame&quot; is one complete representation of the dancer.

A short horizontal line is used to represent the location of a hand or foot that passes through the Coronal plane which extends from the sides of the body. A short vertical line represents a hand or foot at a plane in front of the body, whereas a dot represents a hand or foot at a plane behind the body. The height of the hands and feet from the floor and their distance from the mid-line of the body are shown visually. A line drawn in the top space of the staff shows the position of the head when it changes position. A direction sign is placed below the staff when the direction changes.

<doc id="684698" wikidata="Q1384131" url="?curid=684698" title="Rabin–Karp algorithm">
<text>In computer science, the Rabin–Karp algorithm or Karp–Rabin algorithm is a string-searching algorithm created by that uses hashing to find an exact match of a pattern string in a text. It uses a rolling hash to quickly filter out positions of the text that cannot match the pattern, and then checks for a match at the remaining positions. Generalizations of the same idea can be used to find more than one match of a single pattern, or to find matches for more than one pattern.

To find a single match of a single pattern, the expected time of the algorithm is linear in the combined length of the pattern and text,
although its worst-case time complexity is the product of the two lengths. To find multiple matches, the expected time is linear in the input lengths, plus the combined length of all the matches, which could be greater than linear. In contrast, the Aho–Corasick algorithm can find all matches of multiple patterns in worst-case time and space linear in the input length and the number of matches (instead of the total length of the matches).

A practical application of the algorithm is detecting plagiarism. Given source material, the algorithm can rapidly search through a paper for instances of sentences from the source material, ignoring details such as case and punctuation. Because of the abundance of the sought strings, single-string searching algorithms are impractical.

==Overview==
A naive string matching algorithm compares the given pattern against all positions in the given text. Each comparison takes time proportional to the length of the pattern,
and the number of positions is proportional to the length of the text. Therefore, the worst-case time for such a method is proportional to the product of the two lengths.
In many practical cases, this time can be significantly reduced by cutting short the comparison at each position as soon as a mismatch is found, but this idea cannot guarantee any speedup.

Several string-matching algorithms, including the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm and the Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm, reduce the worst-case time for string matching by extracting more information from each mismatch, allowing them to skip over positions of the text that are guaranteed not to match the pattern. The Rabin–Karp algorithm instead achieves its speedup by using a hash function to quickly perform an approximate check for each position, and then only performing an exact comparison at the positions that pass this approximate check.

A hash function is a function which converts every string into a numeric value, called its &quot;hash value&quot;; for example, we might have codice_1. If two strings are equal, their hash values are also equal. For a well-designed hash function, the inverse is true, in an approximate sense: strings that are unequal are very unlikely to have equal hash values. The Rabin–Karp algorithm proceeds by computing, at each position of the text, the hash value of a string starting at that position with the same length as the pattern. If this hash value equals the hash value of the pattern, it performs a full comparison at that position.

In order for this to work well, the hash function should be selected randomly from a family of hash functions that are unlikely to produce many false positives, that is, positions of the text which have the same hash value as the pattern but do not actually match the pattern. These positions contribute to the running time of the algorithm unnecessarily, without producing a match. Additionally, the hash function used should be a rolling hash, a hash function whose value can be quickly updated from each position of the text to the next. Recomputing the hash function from scratch at each position would be too slow.

==The algorithm==

The algorithm is as shown:
function RabinKarp(string s[1..n], string pattern[1..m])
 hpattern := hash(pattern[1..m]);
 for i from 1 to n-m+1
 hs := hash(s[i..i+m-1])
 if hs = hpattern
 if s[i..i+m-1] = pattern[1..m]
 return i
 return not found
Lines 2, 4, and 6 each require O(&quot;m&quot;) time. However, line 2 is only executed once, and line 6 is only executed if the hash values match, which is unlikely to happen more than a few times. Line 5 is executed O(&quot;n&quot;) times, but each comparison only requires constant time, so its impact is O(&quot;n&quot;). The issue is line 4.

Naively computing the hash value for the substring codice_2 requires O(&quot;m&quot;) time because each character is examined. Since the hash computation is done on each loop, the algorithm with a naive hash computation requires O(mn) time, the same complexity as a straightforward string matching algorithm. For speed, the hash must be computed in constant time. The trick is the variable codice_3 already contains the previous hash value of codice_4. If that value can be used to compute the next hash value in constant time, then computing successive hash values will be fast.

The trick can be exploited using a rolling hash. A rolling hash is a hash function specially designed to enable this operation. A trivial (but not very good) rolling hash function just adds the values of each character in the substring. This rolling hash formula can compute the next hash value from the previous value in constant time:

This simple function works, but will result in statement 5 being executed more often than other more sophisticated rolling hash functions such as those discussed in the next section.

Good performance requires a good hashing function for the encountered data. If the hashing is poor (such as producing the same hash value for every input), then line 6 would be executed O(&quot;n&quot;) times (i.e. on every iteration of the loop). Because character-by-character comparison of strings with length &quot;m&quot; takes O(m) time, the whole algorithm then takes a worst-case O(&quot;mn&quot;) time.

== Hash function used ==

The key to the Rabin–Karp algorithm&#x27;s performance is the efficient computation of hash values of the successive substrings of the text. The Rabin fingerprint is a popular and effective rolling hash function. The hash function described here is not a Rabin fingerprint, but it works equally well. It treats every substring as a number in some base, the base being usually the size of the character set.

For example, if the substring is &quot;hi&quot;, the base is 256, and prime modulus is 101, then the hash value would be 
 [(104 × 256 ) % 101 + 105] % 101 = 65
 (ASCII of &#x27;h&#x27; is 104 and of &#x27;i&#x27; is 105)
 &#x27;%&#x27; is &#x27;mod&#x27; or modulo, or remainder after integer division, operator 

Technically, this algorithm is only similar to the true number in a non-decimal system representation, since for example we could have the &quot;base&quot; less than one of the &quot;digits&quot;. See hash function for a much more detailed discussion. The essential benefit achieved by using a rolling hash such as the Rabin fingerprint is that it is possible to compute the hash value of the next substring from the previous one by doing only a constant number of operations, independent of the substrings&#x27; lengths.

For example, if we have text &quot;abracadabra&quot; and we are searching for a pattern of length 3, the hash of the first substring, &quot;abr&quot;, using 256 as the base, and 101 as the prime modulus is: 
 // ASCII a = 97, b = 98, r = 114. 
 hash(&quot;abr&quot;) = [ ( [ ( [ (97 × 256) % 101 + 98 ] % 101 ) × 256 ] % 101 ) + 114 ] % 101 = 4
We can then compute the hash of the next substring, &quot;bra&quot;, from the hash of &quot;abr&quot; by subtracting the number added for the first &#x27;a&#x27; of &quot;abr&quot;, i.e. 97 × 2562, multiplying by the base and adding for the last a of &quot;bra&quot;, i.e. 97 × 2560. Like so:

 // &quot;old hash (-ve avoider)* old &#x27;a&#x27; left base offset base shift new &#x27;a&quot;&#x27; prime modulus
 hash(&quot;bra&quot;) = [ ( 4 + 101 - 97 * [(256%101)*256] % 101 ) * 256 + 97 ] % 101 = 30

 * (-ve avoider) = &quot;underflow avoider&quot;. Necessary if using unsigned integers for calculations. Because we know all hashes formula_1 for prime modulus $p$, we can ensure no underflow by adding p to the old hash before subtracting the value corresponding to the old &#x27;a&#x27; (mod p).

 the last &#x27;* 256&#x27; is the shift of the subtracted hash to the left 

 although ((256%101)*256)%101 is the same as 2562 % 101, to avoid overflowing integer maximums when the pattern string is longer (e.g. &#x27;Rabin-Karp&#x27; is 10 characters, 2569 is the offset without modulation ), the pattern length base offset is pre-calculated in a loop, modulating the result each iteration 

If we are matching the search string &quot;bra&quot;, using similar calculation of hash(&quot;abr&quot;),

 hash&#x27;(&quot;bra&quot;) = [ ( [ ( [ ( 98 × 256) %101 + 114] % 101 ) × 256 ] % 101) + 97 ] % 101 = 30

If the substrings in question are long, this algorithm achieves great savings compared with many other hashing schemes.

Theoretically, there exist other algorithms that could provide convenient recomputation, e.g. multiplying together ASCII values of all characters so that shifting substring would only entail dividing the previous hash by the first character value, then multiplying by the new last character&#x27;s value. The limitation, however, is the limited size of the integer data type and the necessity of using modular arithmetic to scale down the hash results, (see hash function article). Meanwhile, naive hash functions do not produce large numbers quickly, but, just like adding ASCII values, are likely to cause many hash collisions and hence slow down the algorithm. Hence the described hash function is typically the preferred one in the Rabin–Karp algorithm.

== Multiple pattern search ==
The Rabin–Karp algorithm is inferior for single pattern searching to Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm, Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm and other faster single pattern string searching algorithms because of its slow worst case behavior. However, it is a useful algorithm for multiple pattern search.

To find any of a large number, say &quot;k&quot;, fixed length patterns in a text, a simple variant of the Rabin–Karp algorithm uses a Bloom filter or a set data structure to check whether the hash of a given string belongs to a set of hash values of patterns we are looking for:
function RabinKarpSet(string s[1..n], set of string subs, m):
 set hsubs := emptySet
 foreach sub in subs
 insert hash(sub[1..m]) into hsubs
 hs := hash(s[1..m])
 for i from 1 to n-m+1
 if hs ∈ hsubs and s[i..i+m-1] ∈ subs
 return i
 hs := hash(s[i+1..i+m])
 return not found
We assume all the substrings have a fixed length &quot;m&quot;.

A naïve way to search for &quot;k&quot; patterns is to repeat a single-pattern search taking O(&quot;n+m&quot;) time, totaling in O(&quot;(n+m)k&quot;) time. In contrast, the above algorithm can find all &quot;k&quot; patterns in O(&quot;n&quot;+&quot;km&quot;) expected time, assuming that a hash table check works in O(1) expected time.

<text>In aviation, distance measuring equipment (DME) is a radio navigation technology that measures the slant range (distance) between an aircraft and a ground station by timing the propagation delay of radio signals in the frequency band between 960 and 1215 megahertz (MHz). Line-of-visibility between the aircraft and ground station is required. An interrogator (airborne) initiates an exchange by transmitting a pulse pair, on an assigned &#x27;channel&#x27;, to the transponder ground station. The channel assignment specifies the carrier frequency and the spacing between the pulses. After a known delay, the transponder replies by transmitting a pulse pair on a frequency that is offset from the interrogation frequency by 63 MHz and having specified separation.

DME systems are used worldwide, using standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), RTCA, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and other bodies. Some countries require that aircraft operating under instrument flight rules (IFR) be equipped with a DME interrogator; in others, a DME interrogator is only required for conducting certain operations.

While stand-alone DME transponders are permitted, DME transponders are usually paired with an azimuth guidance system to provide aircraft with a two-dimensional navigation capability. A common combination is a DME colocated with a VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) transmitter in a single ground station. When this occurs, the frequencies of the VOR and DME equipment are paired. Such a configuration enables an aircraft to determine its azimuth angle and distance from the station. A VORTAC (a VOR co-located with a TACAN) installation provides the same capabilities to civil aircraft but also provides 2-D navigation capabilities to military aircraft.

Low-power DME transponders are also associated with some instrument landing system (ILS), ILS localizer and microwave landing system (MLS) installations. In those situations, the DME transponder frequency/pulse spacing is also paired with the ILS, LOC or MLS frequency.

ICAO characterizes DME transmissions as ultra high frequency (UHF). The term L-band is also used.

Developed in Australia, DME was invented by James &quot;Gerry&quot; Gerrand under the supervision of Edward George &quot;Taffy&quot; Bowen while employed as Chief of the Division of Radiophysics of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Another engineered version of the system was deployed by Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited in the early 1950s operating in the 200 MHz VHF band. This Australian domestic version was referred to by the Federal Department of Civil Aviation as DME(D) (or DME Domestic), and the later international version adopted by ICAO as DME(I).
DME is similar in principle to secondary radar ranging function, except the roles of the equipment in the aircraft and on the ground are reversed. DME was a post-war development based on the identification friend or foe (IFF) systems of World War II. To maintain compatibility, DME is functionally identical to the distance measuring component of TACAN.

==Operation==
In its first iteration, a DME-equipped airplane used the equipment to determine and display its distance from a land-based transponder by sending and receiving pulse pairs. The ground stations are typically collocated with VORs or VORTACs. A low-power DME can be collocated with an ILS or MLS where it provides an accurate distance to touchdown, similar to that otherwise provided by ILS marker beacons (and, in many instances, permitting removal of the latter).

A newer role for DMEs is DME/DME area navigation (RNAV). Owing to the generally superior accuracy of DME relative to VOR, navigation using two DMEs (using trilateration/distance) permits operations that navigating with VOR/DME (using azimuth/distance) does not. However, it requires that the aircraft have RNAV capabilities, and some operations also require an inertial reference unit.

A typical DME ground transponder for en-route or terminal navigation will have a 1 kW peak pulse output on the assigned UHF channel.

==Hardware==
The DME system comprises a UHF (L-band) transmitter/receiver (interrogator) in the aircraft and a UHF (L-band) receiver/transmitter (transponder) on the ground.

==Timing==

===Search mode===
150 interrogation pulse-pairs per second. The aircraft interrogates the ground transponder with a series of pulse-pairs (interrogations) and, after a precise time delay (typically 50 microseconds), the ground station replies with an identical sequence of pulse-pairs. The DME receiver in the aircraft searches for reply pulse-pairs (X-mode = 12-microsecond spacing) with the correct interval and reply pattern to its original interrogation pattern. (Pulse-pairs that are not coincident with the individual aircraft&#x27;s interrogation pattern e.g. not synchronous, are referred to as filler pulse-pairs, or squitter. Also, replies to other aircraft that are therefore non-synchronous also appear as squitter).

===Track mode===
Less than 30 interrogation Pulse-pairs per second, as the average number of pulses in SEARCH and TRACK is limited to max 30 pulse pairs per second. The aircraft interrogator locks on to the DME ground station once it recognizes a particular reply pulse sequence has the same spacing as the original interrogation sequence. Once the receiver is locked on, it has a narrower window in which to look for the echoes and can retain lock.

==Distance calculation==
A radio signal takes approximately 12.36 microseconds to travel to the target and back. The time difference between interrogation and reply minus the 50 microsecond ground transponder delay, and the pulse spacing of the reply pulses (12 microseconds in X mode and 30 microseconds in Y mode), is measured by the interrogator&#x27;s timing circuitry and converted to a distance measurement (slant range), in nautical miles, then displayed on the cockpit DME display.

The distance formula, &quot;distance = rate * time&quot;, is used by the DME receiver to calculate its distance from the DME ground station. The rate in the calculation is the velocity of the radio pulse, which is the speed of light (roughly ). The time in the calculation is C. ½(&quot;total time&quot; − &quot;reply delay&quot;), where C is the speed of light.

==Accuracy==

The accuracy of DME ground stations is 185 m (±0.1 nmi). It&#x27;s important to understand that DME provides the physical distance between the aircraft antenna and the DME transponder antenna. This distance is often referred to as &#x27;slant range&#x27; and depends trigonometrically upon the aircraft altitude above the transponder as well as the ground distance between them.

For example, an aircraft directly above the DME station at 6,076 ft (1 nmi) altitude would still show on the DME readout. The aircraft is technically a mile away, just a mile straight up. Slant range error is most pronounced at high altitudes when close to the DME station.

Radio-navigation aids must keep a certain degree of accuracy, given by international standards, FAA, EASA, ICAO, etc. To assure this is the case, flight inspection organizations check periodically critical parameters with properly equipped aircraft to calibrate and certify DME precision.

ICAO recommends accuracy of less than the sum of 0.25 nmi plus 1.25% of the distance measured.

==Specification==
A typical DME ground-based transponder beacon has a limit of 2700 interrogations per second (pulse pairs per second – pps). Thus it can provide distance information for up to 100 aircraft at a time—95% of transmissions for aircraft in tracking mode (typically 25 pps) and 5% in search mode (typically 150 pps). Above this limit the transponder avoids overload by limiting the sensitivity (gain) of the receiver. Replies to weaker (normally the more distant) interrogations are ignored to lower the transponder load.

==Radio frequency and modulation data==
DME frequencies are paired to VOR frequencies and a DME interrogator is designed to automatically tune to the corresponding DME frequency when the associated VOR frequency is selected. An airplane&#x27;s DME interrogator uses frequencies from 1025 to 1150 MHz. DME transponders transmit on a channel in the 962 to 1213 MHz range and receive on a corresponding channel between 1025 and 1150 MHz.
The band is divided into 126 channels for interrogation and 126 channels for reply. The interrogation and reply frequencies always differ by 63 MHz. The spacing and bandwidth of each channel is 1 MHz and a bandwidth of 1MHz.

Technical references to X and Y channels relate only to the spacing of the individual pulses in the DME pulse pair, 12 microsecond spacing for X channels and 30 microsecond spacing for Y channels.

DME facilities identify themselves with a 1,350 Hz Morse code three letter identity. If collocated with a VOR or ILS, it will have the same identity code as the parent facility. Additionally, the DME will identify itself between those of the parent facility. The DME identity is 1,350 Hz to differentiate itself from the 1,020 Hz tone of the VOR or the ILS localizer.

==DME transponder types==
The U.S. FAA has installed three DME transponder types (not including those associated with a landing system): Terminal transponders (often installed at an airport) typically provide service to a minimum height above ground of and range of ; Low altitude transponders typically provide service to a minimum height of and range of ; and High altitude transponders, which typically provide service to a minimum height of and range of . However, many have operational restrictions largely based on line-of-sight blockage, and actual performance may be different. The U.S. Aeronautical Information Manual states, presumably referring to high altitude DME transponders: &quot;reliable signals may be received at distances up to at line−of−sight altitude&quot;.

DME transponders associated with an ILS or other instrument approach are intended for use during an approach to a particular runway, either one or both ends. They are not authorized for general navigation; neither a minimum range nor height is specified.

==Frequency usage/channelization==
DME frequency usage, channelization and pairing with other navaids (VOR, ILS, etc.) are defined by ICAO. 252 DME &quot;channels&quot; are defined by the combination of their interrogation frequency, interrogation pulse spacing, reply frequency, and reply pulse spacing. These channels are labeled 1X, 1Y, 2X, 2Y, ... 126X, 126Y. X channels (which came first) have both interrogation and reply pulse pairs spaced by 12 microseconds. Y channels (which were added to increase capacity) have interrogation pulse pairs spaced by 36 microseconds and reply pulse pairs spaced by 30 microseconds.

A total of 252 frequencies are defined (but not all used) for DME interrogations and replies—specifically, 962, 963, ... 1213 megahertz. Interrogation frequencies are 1025, 1026, ... 1150 megahertz (126 total), and are the same for X and Y channels. For a given channel, the reply frequency is 63 megahertz below or above the interrogation frequency. The reply frequency is different for X and Y channels, and different for channels numbered 1-63 and 64-126.

Not all defined channels/frequencies are assigned. There are assignment &#x27;holes&#x27; centered on 1030 and 1090 megahertz to provide protection for the secondary surveillance radar (SSR) system. In many countries, there is also an assignment &#x27;hole&#x27; centered on 1176.45 megahertz to protect the GPS L5 frequency. These three &#x27;holes&#x27; remove approximately 60 megahertz from the frequencies available for use.

Precision DME (DME/P), a component of the Microwave Landing System, is assigned to Z channels, which have a third set of interrogation and reply pulse spacings. The Z channels are multiplexed with the Y channels and do not materially affect the channel plan.

==Future==
In 2020 one company presented its &#x27;Fifth-Generation DME&#x27;. Although compatible with existing equipment, this iteration provides greater accuracy (down to 5 meters using DME/DME triangulation), with a further reduction to 3 meters using a further refinement. The 3-meter equipment is being considered as part of Europe&#x27;s SESAR project, with possible deployment by 2023.

In the twenty-first century, aerial navigation has become increasingly reliant on satellite guidance. However, ground-based navigation will continue, for three reasons:
* The satellite signal is extremely weak, can be spoofed, and is not always available;
* A European Union rule requires member states to keep and maintain ground-based navigation aids;
* A feeling of sovereignty, or control over a state&#x27;s own navigational means. &quot;Some states want navigation over their territory to rely on means they control. And not every country has its constellation like the U.S.&#x27; GPS or Europe&#x27;s Galileo.&quot;

One advantage of the fifth-generation equipment proposed in 2020 is its ability to be function-checked by drone flights, which will significantly reduce the expense and delays of previous manned certification flight tests.

<text>Feng Youlan (; 4 December 1895 – 26 November 1990) was a Chinese philosopher, historian, and writer who was instrumental for reintroducing the study of Chinese philosophy in the modern era. The name he published under in English was &#x27;Fung Yu-lan,&#x27; as used in the Bodde translation of &quot;A History of Chinese Philosophy.&quot; This earlier spelling also occurs in philosophical discussions, see for example the work of Wing-tsit Chan.

==Early life, education and career==
Feng Youlan was born on 4 December 1895 in Tanghe County, Nanyang, Henan, China, to a middle-class family. His younger sister was Feng Yuanjun, who would become a famous Chinese writer. He studied philosophy in the China Public School in Shanghai, between 1912 and 1915, a preparatory school for college, then studied in Chunghua University, Wuhan (later merged into Central China Normal University) and Peking University between 1915 and 1918, where he was able to study Western philosophy and logic as well as Chinese philosophy.

Upon his graduation in 1918, he traveled to the United States in 1919, where he studied at Columbia University on the Boxer Indemnity Scholarship Program. There he met, among many philosophers who were to influence his thought and career, John Dewey, the pragmatist, who became his teacher. Feng gained his PhD from Columbia in 1923. His PhD thesis was titled &quot;A Comparative Study of Life Ideals&quot;.

He went on to teach at Chinese universities including Jinan University, Yenching University, and Tsinghua University in Beijing. From 1934 to 1938 (and again from 1946 to 1949) he was Chair of the Department of Philosophy at Tsinghua. It was while at Tsinghua that Feng published what was to be his best-known and most influential work, his &quot;History of Chinese Philosophy&quot; (1934, in two volumes). In it he presented and examined the history of Chinese philosophy from a viewpoint which was very much influenced by the Western philosophical fashions prevalent at the time, which resulted in what Peter J. King of Oxford describes as a distinctly positivist tinge to most of the philosophers he described. Nevertheless, the book became the standard work in its field, and had a huge effect in reigniting an interest in Chinese thought.

In 1935 Feng, on his way to a conference in Prague, stopped briefly in the Soviet Union and was impressed with the radical social changes and cultural ferment. His speeches extolling the utopian possibilities of communism, although also describing the mistakes he saw, drew attention from Chiang Kai-sheks&#x27;s police. Feng was arrested and spent a short time in jail, but soon became a firm supporter of the government and its resistance to Japan. During the Sino-Japanese War he published works which supported the New Life Movement for revitalizing Confucian values.

In 1939, Feng brought out his &quot;Xin Lixue&quot; (&quot;New Rational Philosophy&quot;, or &quot;Neo-Lixue&quot;). Lixue was a philosophical position of an important group of twelfth-century neo-Confucianists (including Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi); Feng&#x27;s book took certain metaphysical notions from their thought and from taoism (such as li and tao), analyzed and developed them in ways that owed much to the Western philosophical tradition, and produced a rationalistic neo-Confucian metaphysics. He also developed, in the same way, an account of the nature of morality and of the structure of human moral development.

== War and upheaval ==
When the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, the students and staff of Beijing&#x27;s Tsinghua and Peking Universities, together with Tianjin&#x27;s Nankai University, fled their campuses. They went first to Hengshan, where they set up the Changsha Temporary University, and then to Kunming, where they set up Southwest Associated University.
When, in 1946 the three Universities returned to Beijing, Feng instead went to the U.S. again, this time to take up a post as visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania. He spent the year 1948–1949 as a visiting professor at the University of Hawaii. He served as President of Tsinghua University from December 1948 to May 1949 because of Zhang Dongsun&#x27;s refusal (it was known as National Tsinghua University until January 1949).

While he was at Pennsylvania, news from China made it clear that the communists were on their way to seizing power. Feng&#x27;s friends tried to persuade him to stay, but he was determined to return; his political views were broadly socialist, and he thus felt optimistic about China&#x27;s future under its new government.

Once back home, Feng began to study Marxist–Leninist thought, but he soon found that the political situation fell short of his hopes; by the mid-1950s his philosophical approach was being attacked by the authorities. He was forced to repudiate much of his earlier work, and to rewrite the rest – including his &quot;History&quot; – in order to fit in with the ideas of the Cultural revolution.

Despite all this, Feng refused to leave China, and after enduring much hardship he finally saw a relaxation of censorship, and was able to write with a certain degree of freedom. He died on 26 November 1990 in Beijing.

<doc id="684709" wikidata="Q895984" url="?curid=684709" title="Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm">
<text>In computer science, the Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that is the standard benchmark for practical string-search literature. It was developed by Robert S. Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977. The original paper contained static tables for computing the pattern shifts without an explanation of how to produce them. The algorithm for producing the tables was published in a follow-on paper; this paper contained errors which were later corrected by Wojciech Rytter in 1980.

The algorithm preprocesses the string being searched for (the pattern), but not the string being searched in (the text). It is thus well-suited for applications in which the pattern is much shorter than the text or where it persists across multiple searches. The Boyer–Moore algorithm uses information gathered during the preprocess step to skip sections of the text, resulting in a lower constant factor than many other string search algorithms. In general, the algorithm runs faster as the pattern length increases. The key features of the algorithm are to match on the tail of the pattern rather than the head, and to skip along the text in jumps of multiple characters rather than searching every single character in the text.

==Description==
The Boyer–Moore algorithm searches for occurrences of in by performing explicit character comparisons at different alignments. Instead of a brute-force search of all alignments (of which there are ), Boyer–Moore uses information gained by preprocessing to skip as many alignments as possible.

Previous to the introduction of this algorithm, the usual way to search within text was to examine each character of the text for the first character of the pattern. Once that was found the subsequent characters of the text would be compared to the characters of the pattern. If no match occurred then the text would again be checked character by character in an effort to find a match. Thus almost every character in the text needs to be examined.

The key insight in this algorithm is that if the end of the pattern is compared to the text, then jumps along the text can be made rather than checking every character of the text. The reason that this works is that in lining up the pattern against the text, the last character of the pattern is compared to the character in the text. If the characters do not match, there is no need to continue searching backwards along the text. If the character in the text does not match any of the characters in the pattern, then the next character in the text to check is located characters farther along the text, where is the length of the pattern. If the character in the text &quot;is&quot; in the pattern, then a partial shift of the pattern along the text is done to line up along the matching character and the process is repeated. Jumping along the text to make comparisons rather than checking every character in the text decreases the number of comparisons that have to be made, which is the key to the efficiency of the algorithm.

More formally, the algorithm begins at alignment , so the start of is aligned with the start of . Characters in and are then compared starting at index in and in , moving backward. The strings are matched from the end of to the start of . The comparisons continue until either the beginning of is reached (which means there is a match) or a mismatch occurs upon which the alignment is shifted forward (to the right) according to the maximum value permitted by a number of rules. The comparisons are performed again at the new alignment, and the process repeats until the alignment is shifted past the end of , which means no further matches will be found.

The shift rules are implemented as constant-time table lookups, using tables generated during the preprocessing of .

==Shift rules==
A shift is calculated by applying two rules: the bad-character rule and the good-suffix rule. The actual shifting offset is the maximum of the shifts calculated by these rules.

===The bad-character rule===

====Description====

| -||-||-||-||X||-||-||K||-||-||-
| A||N||P||A||N||M||A||N||A||M||-
| -||N||N||A||A||M||A||N||-||-||-
| -||-||-||N||N||A||A||M||A||N||-
The bad-character rule considers the character in at which the comparison process failed (assuming such a failure occurred). The next occurrence of that character to the left in is found, and a shift which brings that occurrence in line with the mismatched occurrence in is proposed. If the mismatched character does not occur to the left in , a shift is proposed that moves the entirety of past the point of mismatch.

====Preprocessing====
Methods vary on the exact form the table for the bad-character rule should take, but a simple constant-time lookup solution is as follows: create a 2D table which is indexed first by the index of the character in the alphabet and second by the index in the pattern. This lookup will return the occurrence of in with the next-highest index or -1 if there is no such occurrence. The proposed shift will then be , with lookup time and space, assuming a finite alphabet of length .

The C and Java implementations below have a space complexity (make_delta1, makeCharTable). This is the same as the original delta1 and the BMH bad-character table. This table maps a character at position to shift by , with the last instance—the least shift amount—taking precedence. All unused characters are set as as a sentinel value.

===The good-suffix rule===

====Description====

| -||-||-||-||X||-||-||K||-||-||-||-||-
| M||A||N||P||A||N||A||M||A||N||A||P||-
| A||N||A||M||P||N||A||M||-||-||-||-||-
| -||-||-||-||A||N||A||M||P||N||A||M||-
The good-suffix rule is markedly more complex in both concept and implementation than the bad-character rule. Like the bad-character rule, it also exploits the algorithm&#x27;s feature of comparisons beginning at the end of the pattern and proceeding towards the pattern&#x27;s start. It can be described as follows:
Suppose for a given alignment of P and T, a substring t of T matches a suffix of P and suppose t is the largest such substring for the given alignment.
# Then find, if it exists, the right-most copy of t in P such that is not a suffix of P and the character to the left of in P differs from the character to the left of t in P. Shift P to the right so that substring in P aligns with substring t in T.
# If does not exist, then shift the left end of P to the right by the least amount (past the left end of t in T) so that a prefix of the shifted pattern matches a suffix of t in T. This includes cases where t is an exact match of P.
# If no such shift is possible, then shift P by m (length of P) places to the right.
====Preprocessing====
The good-suffix rule requires two tables: one for use in the general case (where a copy is found), and another for use when the general case returns no meaningful result. These tables will be designated and respectively. Their definitions are as follows:
For each , is the largest position less than such that string matches a suffix of and such that the character preceding that suffix is not equal to . is defined to be zero if there is no position satisfying the condition.

Let denote the length of the largest suffix of that is also a prefix of , if one exists. If none exists, let be zero.
Both of these tables are constructible in time and use space. The alignment shift for index in is given by or . should only be used if is zero or a match has been found.
-----------------------------------------------
===Shift Example using pattern ANPANMAN===

 Index| Mismatch | Shift 
 0 | N| 1 
 1 | AN| 8 
 2 | MAN| 3 
 3 | NMAN| 6 
 4 | ANMAN| 6 
 5 | PANMAN| 6 
 6 | NPANMAN| 6 
 7 | ANPANMAN| 6 

Explanation:

Index 0, no characters matched, the character read was not an N. The good-suffix length is zero. Since there are plenty of letters in the pattern that are also not N, we have minimal information here - shifting by 1 is the least interesting result.

Index 1, we matched the N, and it was preceded by something other than A. Now look at the pattern starting from the end, where do we have N preceded by something other than A? There are two other N&#x27;s, but both are preceded by A. That means no part of the good suffix can be useful to us -- shift by the full pattern length 8.

Index 2: We matched the AN, and it was preceded by not M. In the middle of the pattern there is a AN preceded by P, so it becomes the shift candidate. Shifting that AN to the right to line up with our match is a shift of 3.

Index 3 &amp; up: the matched suffixes do not match anything else in the pattern, but the trailing suffix AN matches the start of the pattern, so the shifts here are all 6.

==The Galil rule==
A simple but important optimization of Boyer–Moore was put forth by Zvi Galil in 1979.
As opposed to shifting, the Galil rule deals with speeding up the actual comparisons done at each alignment by skipping sections that are known to match. Suppose that at an alignment , is compared with down to character of . Then if is shifted to such that its left end is between and , in the next comparison phase a prefix of must match the substring . Thus if the comparisons get down to position of , an occurrence of can be recorded without explicitly comparing past . In addition to increasing the efficiency of Boyer–Moore, the Galil rule is required for proving linear-time execution in the worst case.

The Galil rule, in its original version, is only effective for versions that output multiple matches. It updates the substring range only on , i.e. a full match. A generalized version for dealing with submatches was reported in 1985 as the Apostolico–Giancarlo algorithm.

==Performance==
The Boyer–Moore algorithm as presented in the original paper has worst-case running time of only if the pattern does &quot;not&quot; appear in the text. This was first proved by Knuth, Morris, and Pratt in 1977, followed by Guibas and Odlyzko in 1980 with an upper bound of comparisons in the worst case. Richard Cole gave a proof with an upper bound of comparisons in the worst case in 1991.

When the pattern &quot;does&quot; occur in the text, running time of the original algorithm is in the worst case. This is easy to see when both pattern and text consist solely of the same repeated character. However, inclusion of the Galil rule results in linear runtime across all cases.

==Implementations==
Various implementations exist in different programming languages. In C++ it is part of the Standard Library since C++17 and Boost provides the generic Boyer–Moore search implementation under the &quot;Algorithm&quot; library. In Go (programming language) there is an implementation in search.go. D (programming language) uses a BoyerMooreFinder for predicate based matching within ranges as a part of the Phobos Runtime Library.

The Boyer–Moore algorithm is also used in GNU&#x27;s grep.

==Variants==
The Boyer–Moore–Horspool algorithm is a simplification of the Boyer–Moore algorithm using only the bad-character rule.

The Apostolico–Giancarlo algorithm speeds up the process of checking whether a match has occurred at the given alignment by skipping explicit character comparisons. This uses information gleaned during the pre-processing of the pattern in conjunction with suffix match lengths recorded at each match attempt. Storing suffix match lengths requires an additional table equal in size to the text being searched.

The Raita algorithm improves the performance of Boyer–Moore–Horspool algorithm. The searching pattern of particular sub-string in a given string is different from Boyer–Moore–Horspool algorithm.

<doc id="684715" wikidata="Q2976163" url="?curid=684715" title="1990–91 snooker world rankings">
<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA), the governing body for professional snooker, first introduced a ranking system for professional players in 1976, with the aim of seeding players for the World Snooker Championship. The reigning champion would be automatically seeded first, the losing finalist from the previous year seeded second, and the other seedings based on the ranking list. Initially, the rankings were based on performances in the preceding three world championships. The 1983–84 snooker world rankings were the first to take tournaments other than the world championship into account and several additional tournaments were designated as ranking tournaments over the following years. The list for the 1986–87 snooker season was the first to only take account of results over two seasons and the rankings for 1990–91 were also based on results from the preceding two seasons.

1990 World Snooker Championship winner Stephen Hendry took first place in the 1990–91 ranking list, followed by Steve Davis. Davis, who had held the number one ranking since the 1983–84 list, withdrew from three ranking events held outside of the UK in the 1989–90 season. He commented that he felt that the increase in the number of ranking events was too rapid and said that &quot;I won&#x27;t jeapordise my form just for the sake of staying at number one. If I lose my number one place, that&#x27;s the price I have to pay.&quot; The other seven players managed by Barry Hearn&#x27;s Matchroom company also boycotted the 1989 Dubai Classic. Because of this, a number of &quot;non-tournament&quot; players, usually only allowed to play in the World Championship, were given places in the Dubai Classic. John Parrott was placed third, down one place from the previous season, and Jimmy White stayed in fourth. Doug Mountjoy, who had won the 1988 UK Championship and the 1989 Classic to become the only player apart from Davis to win successive ranking titles, rose five places to fifth. 

The top 16 in the rankings were exempted from the qualifying rounds for the World Snooker Championship and were included in certain invitational events. Martin Clark, at 12th, joined the top 16 for the first time. Former world number three Neal Foulds gained seven places, to 13th. Alex Higgins was ranked 14th in the original list for the season, having been 24th the year before, but was docked 25 points and banned from competing for ten months in July 1990. These penalties were imposed by the WPBSA following a hearing conducted for the Association by Gavin Lightman, a barrister, which considered several incidents including Higgins punching a press officer, threatening to arrange for fellow player Dennis Taylor to be shot, and insulting both Taylor and WPBSA chairman John Spencer. This meant that Alain Robidoux gained 16th place. Cliff Thorburn, Joe Johnson and Tony Knowles were the three players to drop out of the top 16.

== Points tariff and basis of ranking==
Ranking was determined as follows:
*By number of ranking points.
*If players had an equal number of ranking points, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, merit points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, A points were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given to the player with the better performances in the later season.
*If players were still equal, frames won were considered. If they were still tied, precedence was given the player with the better performances in the later season.

==Rankings==
Key:
*&quot;(New)&quot; denotes a player that was a new professional for 1989–90.
*&quot;(NT)&quot; denotes a non-tournament player, i.e. a player who was permitted to enter the world championship but no other tournaments in 1990–91.
*&quot;N&quot; denotes that as a non-tournament player, the player was not eligible to enter.
*&quot;–&quot; denotes that the player did not compete in the tournament.
*&quot;X&quot; denotes that the player was banned from competing in the tournament.
*&quot;PL&quot; denotes that the player lost in the professional play-offs.

<doc id="684716" wikidata="Q7187885" url="?curid=684716" title="Photoplethysmogram">
<text>A photoplethysmogram (PPG) is an optically obtained plethysmogram that can be used to detect blood volume changes in the microvascular bed of tissue. A PPG is often obtained by using a pulse oximeter which illuminates the skin and measures changes in light absorption. A conventional pulse oximeter monitors the perfusion of blood to the dermis and subcutaneous tissue of the skin. 

With each cardiac cycle the heart pumps blood to the periphery. Even though this pressure pulse is somewhat damped by the time it reaches the skin, it is enough to distend the arteries and arterioles in the subcutaneous tissue. If the pulse oximeter is attached without compressing the skin, a pressure pulse can also be seen from the venous plexus, as a small secondary peak.

The change in volume caused by the pressure pulse is detected by illuminating the skin with the light from a light-emitting diode (LED) and then measuring the amount of light either transmitted or reflected to a photodiode. Each cardiac cycle appears as a peak, as seen in the figure. Because blood flow to the skin can be modulated by multiple other physiological systems, the PPG can also be used to monitor breathing, hypovolemia, and other circulatory conditions. Additionally, the shape of the PPG waveform differs from subject to subject, and varies with the location and manner in which the pulse oximeter is attached.

Although PPG sensors are in common use in a number of commercial and clinical applications, the exact mechanisms determining the shape of the PPG waveform are not yet fully understood.

== Sites for measuring PPG ==
While pulse oximeters are commonly used medical devices, the PPG signal they record is rarely displayed and is nominally only processed to determine blood oxygenation and heart rate. The PPG can be obtained from transmissive absorption (as at the finger tip) or reflection (as on the forehead).

In outpatient settings, pulse oximeters are commonly worn on the finger. However, in cases of shock, hypothermia, etc., blood flow to the periphery can be reduced, resulting in a PPG without a discernible cardiac pulse. In this case, a PPG can be obtained from a pulse oximeter on the head, with the most common sites being the ear, nasal septum, and forehead. PPG can also be configured for multi-site photoplethysmography (MPPG), e.g. by making simultaneous measurements from the right and left ear lobes, index fingers and great toes, and offering further opportunities for the assessment of patients with suspected peripheral arterial disease, autonomic dysfunction, endothelial dysfunction, and arterial stiffness. MPPG also offers significant potential for data mining, e.g. using deep learning, as well as a range of other innovative pulse wave analysis techniques.

Motion artifacts are often a limiting factor preventing accurate readings during exercise and free living conditions.

== Uses ==
===Monitoring heart rate and cardiac cycle===

Because the skin is so richly perfused, it is relatively easy to detect the pulsatile component of the cardiac cycle. The DC component of the signal is attributable to the bulk absorption of the skin tissue, while the AC component is directly attributable to variation in blood volume in the skin caused by the pressure pulse of the cardiac cycle.

The height of AC component of the photoplethysmogram is proportional to the pulse pressure, the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure in the arteries. As seen in the figure showing premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), the PPG pulse for the cardiac cycle with the PVC results in lower amplitude blood pressure and a PPG. Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation can also be detected.

===Monitoring respiration===
Respiration affects the cardiac cycle by varying the intrapleural pressure, the pressure between the thoracic wall and the lungs. Since the heart resides in the thoracic cavity between the lungs, the partial pressure of inhaling and exhaling greatly influence the pressure on the vena cava and the filling of the right atrium.

During inspiration, intrapleural pressure decreases by up to 4 mm Hg, which distends the right atrium, allowing for faster filling from the vena cava, increasing ventricular preload, but decreasing stroke volume. Conversely during expiration, the heart is compressed, decreasing cardiac efficiency and increasing stroke volume. When the frequency and depth of respiration increases, the venous return increases, leading to increased cardiac output.

Much research has focused on estimating respiratory rate from the photoplethysmogram, as well as more detailed respiratory measurements such as inspiratory time.

===Monitoring depth of anesthesia===
Anesthesiologists must often judge subjectively whether a patient is sufficiently anesthetized for surgery. As seen in the figure, if a patient is not sufficiently anesthetized, the sympathetic nervous system response to an incision can generate an immediate response in the amplitude of the PPG.

===Monitoring hypo- and hypervolemia===
Shamir, Eidelman, et al. studied the interaction between inspiration and removal of 10% of a patient’s blood volume for blood banking before surgery. They found that blood loss could be detected both from the photoplethysmogram from a pulse oximeter and an arterial catheter. Patients showed a decrease in the cardiac pulse amplitude caused by reduced cardiac preload during exhalation when the heart is being compressed.

===Monitoring blood pressure===
The FDA reportedly provided clearance to a photoplethysmography-based cuffless blood pressure monitor in August 2019.

== Remote photoplethysmography ==

===Conventional imaging===
While photoplethysmography commonly requires some form of contact with the human skin (e.g., ear, finger), remote photoplethysmography allows physiological processes such as blood flow to be determined without skin contact. This is achieved by using face video to analyze subtle momentary changes in the subject&#x27;s skin color which are not detectable to the human eye. Such camera-based measurement of blood oxygen levels provides a contactless alternative to conventional photoplethysmography. For instance, it can be used to monitor the heart rate of newborn babies, or analyzed with deep neural networks to quantify stress levels.

===Digital holography===

Remote photoplethysmography can also be performed by digital holography, which is sensitive to the phase of light waves, and hence can reveal sub-micron out-of-plane motion. In particular, wide-field imaging of pulsatile motion induced by blood flow can be measured on the thumb by digital holography. The results are comparable to blood pulse monitored by plethysmography during an occlusion-reperfusion experiment. A major advantage of this system is that no physical contact with the studied tissue surface area is required. The two major limitations of this approach are (i) the off-axis interferometric configuration that reduces the available spatial bandwidth of the sensor array, and (ii) the use of short-time Fourier transform (via discrete Fourier transform) analysis that filters-off physiological signals.
Principal component analysis of digital holograms reconstructed from digitized interferograms acquired at rates beyond ~1000 frames per second reveals surface waves on the hand. This method is an efficient way of performing digital holography from on-axis interferograms, which alleviates both the spatial bandwidth reduction of the off-axis configuration and the filtering of physiological signals. A higher spatial bandwidth is crucial for larger image field of view.

A refinement of holographic photoplethysmography, holographic laser Doppler imaging, enables non-invasive blood flow pulse wave monitoring in blood vessels of the retina, choroid, conjunctiva, and iris.
In particular, laser Doppler holography of the eye fundus, the choroid constitutes the predominant contribution to the high frequency laser Doppler signal. It is however possible to circumvent its influence by subtracting the spatially averaged baseline signal, and achieve high temporal resolution and full-field imaging capability of pulsatile blood flow.

<doc id="684719" wikidata="Q1003805" url="?curid=684719" title="Nucleus ambiguus">
<text>The nucleus ambiguus (&quot;ambiguous nucleus&quot; in English) is a group of large motor neurons, situated deep in the medullary part of the reticular formation named by Jacob Clarke. The nucleus ambiguus contains the cell bodies of neurons that innervate the muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, and larynx which are associated with speech and swallowing. As well as motor neurons, the nucleus ambiguus contains preganglionic parasympathetic neurons which innervate postganglionic parasympathetic neurons in the heart.

It is a region of histologically disparate cells located just dorsal (posterior) to the inferior olivary nucleus in the lateral portion of the upper (rostral) medulla. It receives upper motor neuron innervation directly via the corticobulbar tract.

This nucleus gives rise to the branchial efferent motor fibers of the vagus nerve (CN X) terminating in the laryngeal, pharyngeal muscles, and musculus uvulae; as well as to the efferent motor fibers of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) terminating in the stylopharyngeus muscle. In addition, it gives efferent fibers to the cranial part of accessory nerve (CNXI).

==Function==
The nucleus ambiguus controls the motor innervation of ipsilateral muscles of the soft palate, pharynx, larynx, and upper esophagus. Lesions of nucleus ambiguus result in nasal speech, dysphagia, dysphonia, and deviation of the uvula toward the contralateral side. Preganglionic parasympathetic to the heart also flow through the external formation of the nucleus.

==Areas supplied==
The muscles supplied by the vagus (included with this is the cranial root of the accessory nerve), such as levator veli palatini, are also necessary to swallow properly through integration by the nucleus of the solitary tract. The vagus also supplies the upper part of the esophagus, and other parts of the pharynx and larynx.

As well as motor neurons, the nucleus ambiguus in its &quot;external formation&quot; contains cholinergic preganglionic parasympathetic neurons for the heart. These neurons are cardioinhibitory. This cardioinhibitory effect is one of the means by which quick changes in blood pressure are achieved by the central nervous system (the primary means being changes in sympathetic nervous system activity, which constricts arterioles and makes the heart pump faster and harder). That is, through an integrated and antagonistic system with sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor center of the brainstem, the parasympathetic outflow arising from the nucleus ambiguus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve acts to decrease cardiac activity in response to fast increases in blood pressure. The external formation of the nucleus ambiguus also sends bronchoconstrictor fibers to the bronchopulmonary system, which can produce reflexive decreases in pulmonary bronchial airflow. The pathophysiologic relevance of this system, which may act in concert with the cardioinhibitory system, is poorly understood, but likely plays a role in bronchospastic diseases like COPD/emphysema (in which inhaled anticholinergic medications such as Spiriva/tiotropium or ipratropium are standard-of-care treatment) and asthma, particularly for exercise-related asthma exacerbations, which may have a component of autonomic dysregulation.

<text>Arthur David Waley (born Arthur David Schloss, 19 August 188927 June 1966) was an English orientalist and sinologist who achieved both popular and scholarly acclaim for his translations of Chinese and Japanese poetry. Among his honours were appointment as Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1952, receiving the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1953, and being invested as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in 1956.

Although highly learned, Waley avoided academic posts and most often wrote for a general audience. He chose not to be a specialist but to translate a wide and personal range of classical literature. Starting in the 1910s and continuing steadily almost until his death in 1966, these translations started with poetry, such as &quot;A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems&quot; (1918) and &quot;Japanese Poetry: The Uta&quot; (1919), then an equally wide range of novels, such as &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; (1925–26), an 11th-century Japanese work, and &quot;Monkey&quot;, from 16th-century China. Waley also presented and translated Chinese philosophy, wrote biographies of literary figures, and maintained a lifelong interest in both Asian and Western paintings.

A 2004 profile by fellow sinologist E. Bruce Books called Waley &quot;the great transmitter of the high literary cultures of China and Japan to the English-reading general public; the ambassador from East to West in the first half of the 20th century&quot;, and went on to say that he was &quot;self-taught, but reached remarkable levels of fluency, even erudition, in both languages. It was a unique achievement, possible (as he himself later noted) only in that time, and unlikely to be repeated.&quot;

==Life==
Arthur Waley was born Arthur David Schloss on 19 August 1889 in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England. The son of an economist, David Frederick Schloss, he was educated at Rugby School and entered King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1907 on a scholarship to study Classics, but left in 1910 due to eye problems that hindered his ability to study.

Waley briefly worked in an export firm in an attempt to please his parents, but in 1913 he was appointed Assistant Keeper of Oriental Prints and Manuscripts at the British Museum. Waley&#x27;s supervisor at the museum was the poet and scholar Laurence Binyon, and under his nominal tutelage, Waley taught himself to read Classical Chinese and Classical Japanese, partly to help catalogue the paintings in the museum&#x27;s collection. Despite this, he never learned to speak either modern Mandarin Chinese or Japanese and never visited either China or Japan.

Waley was of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry. He changed his surname from Schloss in 1914, when, like many others in England with German surnames, he sought to avoid the anti-German prejudice common in Britain during the First World War.

Waley entered into a lifelong relationship with the English ballet dancer, orientalist, dance critic, and dance researcher Beryl de Zoete, whom he met in 1918, but they never married.

Waley left the British Museum in 1929 to devote himself fully to writing and translation, and never held a full-time job again, except for a four-year stint in the Ministry of Information during the Second World War. In September 1939, he had been recruited to run the Japanese Censorship Section at the Ministry of Information. Assisted by Captain Oswald Tuck RN, he was responsible for checking the dispatches of Japanese journalists in London, private mail in Japanese and intercepted diplomatic signals from the Japanese Embassy in London.

Waley lived in Bloomsbury and had a number of friends among the Bloomsbury Group, many of whom he had met when he was an undergraduate. He was one of the earliest to recognise Ronald Firbank as an accomplished author and, together with the writer Osbert Sitwell, provided an introduction to the first edition of Firbank&#x27;s collected works.

The poet Ezra Pound was instrumental in getting Waley&#x27;s first translations into print in &quot;The Little Review&quot;. His view of Waley&#x27;s early work was mixed, however. As he wrote to Margaret Anderson, the editor of the &quot;Little Review&quot;, in a letter of 2 July 1917: &quot;Have at last got hold of Waley&#x27;s translations from Po chu I. Some of the poems are magnificent. Nearly all the translations marred by his bungling English and defective rhythm. ... I shall try to buy the best ones, and to get him to remove some of the botched places. (He is stubborn as a donkey, or a &quot;scholar&quot;.)&quot; In his introduction to his translation of &quot;The Way and its Power&quot;, Waley explains that he was careful to put meaning above style in translations where meaning would be reasonably considered of more importance to the modern Western reader.

Waley married Alison Grant Robinson in May 1966, one month before his death on 27 June. He is buried in an unmarked grave (plot no. 51178) on the western side of Highgate Cemetery in front of the grave of the sculptor Joseph Edwards.

The writer Sacheverell Sitwell, who considered Waley &quot;the greatest scholar and the person with most understanding of all human arts&quot; that he had known in his lifetime, later recalled Waley&#x27;s last days,

==Honours==
Waley was elected an honorary fellow of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1945, was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) honour in 1952, received the Queen&#x27;s Gold Medal for Poetry in 1953, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in 1956.

==Works==

Jonathan Spence wrote of Waley&#x27;s translations that he

His many translations include &quot;A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems&quot; (1918), &quot;Japanese Poetry: The Uta&quot; (1919), &quot;The No Plays of Japan&quot; (1921), &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; (published in 6 volumes from 1921 to 1933), &quot;The Pillow Book of Sei Shōnagon&quot; (1928), The &quot;Kutune Shirka&quot; (1951), &quot;Monkey&quot; (1942, an abridged version of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;), &quot;The Poetry and Career of Li Po&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols and Other Pieces&quot; (1964). Waley received the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for his translation of &quot;Monkey&quot;. His translations of the classics, the &quot;Analects of Confucius&quot; and &quot;The Way and Its Power&quot; (Tao Te Ching), are still in print, as is his interpretive presentation of classical Chinese philosophy, &quot;Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China&quot; (1939).

Waley&#x27;s translations of verse are widely regarded as poems in their own right, and have been included in many anthologies such as the &quot;Oxford Book of Modern Verse 1892–1935&quot;, &quot;The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse&quot; and the &quot;Penguin Book of Contemporary Verse (1918–1960)&quot; under Waley&#x27;s name. Many of his original translations and commentaries have been re-published as Penguin Classics and Wordsworth Classics, reaching a wide readership.

Despite translating many Chinese and Japanese classical texts into English, Waley never travelled to either country, or anywhere else in East Asia. In his preface to &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, he writes that he was not a master of many languages, but claims to have known Chinese and Japanese fairly well, a good deal of Ainu and Mongolian, and some Hebrew and Syriac.

The composer Benjamin Britten set six translations from Waley&#x27;s &quot;Chinese Poems&quot; (1946) for high voice and guitar in his song cycle &quot;Songs from the Chinese&quot; (1957).

<text>Mike Hallett (born 6 July 1959) is an English former professional snooker player and commentator. He won the 1989 Hong Kong Open.

==Career==
Hallett was born in Grimsby on 6 July 1959. Having won the national under-16 title in 1975, he turned professional in 1979. His world ranking peaked at number six, in the 1989/1990 list. His only ranking tournament victory was at the 1989 Hong Kong Open in which he defeated Dene O&#x27;Kane 9–8.

In a semi-final match against John Parrott in the 1988 Benson &amp; Hedges Masters, he recovered from needing three snookers to win the decider 6–5. However, he lost 0–9 to Steve Davis in the final, the first whitewash in the Masters final.

Three years later, in 1991 he reached the Masters Final again at Wembley where, in the best-of-17-frame match, he surged to a 7–0 lead over Stephen Hendry and missed a pink which would have put him 8–0 ahead. He then moved into an 8–2 lead and needed just the pink and black to clear for the match in the eleventh frame, but missed the shot with the rest. Hendry took that frame and managed to spring a comeback to win the match 9–8. Hallett would go on to win two invitational World Series of Snooker events later in the year, but did not win another professional title after 1991.

Hallett did reach the quarter-finals of the World Championship twice, but never progressed further. His final season on the main tour was in 2004–05, after which he went on to play in the Pontin&#x27;s International Open Series.

At the start of the 2011/12 season Hallett entered the Players Tour Championship and after winning his first two matches against Duane Jones 4-3 and Elliot Slessor also 4–3, he played Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan and managed to take two frames in losing 4–2.

In August 2021 the World Snooker Tour tweeted that Hallett was recovering from a stroke.

<doc id="684737" wikidata="Q795009" url="?curid=684737" title="Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is the statutory corporation which oversees and regulates all aspects of civil aviation in the United Kingdom. Its areas of responsibility include:

* Supervising the issuing of pilots and aircraft engineers licences, testing of equipment, calibrating of navaids, and many other inspections (Civil Aviation Flying Unit).
* Managing the regulation of security standards, including vetting of all personnel in the aviation industry (Directorate of Aviation Security).
* Overseeing the national protection scheme for customers abroad in the event of a travel company failure (Air Travel Organisers&#x27; Licensing – ATOL).

The CAA is a public corporation of the Department for Transport, liaising with the government via the Standards Group of the Cabinet Office.

==Responsibilities==
The CAA directly or indirectly regulates all aspects of aviation in the UK. In some aspects of aviation it is the primary regulator.

The UK government requires that the CAA&#x27;s costs are met entirely from its charges on those whom it regulates. Unlike many other countries, there is no direct government funding of the CAA&#x27;s work. It is classed as a public corporation, established by statute, in the public sector. The connection it has with the government is via the machinery of government and the Standards Group of the Cabinet Office.

The CAA regulates (approximately):

* Active professional and private pilots (50,000) 
* Licensed aircraft engineers (12,400) 
* Air traffic controllers (2,350) 
* Airlines (206) 
* Licensed aerodromes (241) 
* Organisations involved in the design, production and maintenance of aircraft (950) 
* ATOL holders (2,400) 
* Aircraft registered in the UK (19,000)
* Alternative Dispute Resolution providers

===ATOL===
The CAA also oversees the Air Travel Organisers&#x27; Licensing (ATOL).

By law, every UK travel company which sells air holidays and flights is required to hold an ATOL, which stands for Air Travel Organiser&#x27;s Licence.

If a travel company with an ATOL ceases trading, the ATOL scheme protects customers who had booked holidays with the firm. It ensures they do not get stranded abroad or lose money.

The scheme is designed to reassure customers that their money is safe, and will provide assistance in the event of a travel company failure.

==History==
Before 1972, regulation of aviation was the responsibility of the Air Registration Board.
The CAA was established in 1972, under the terms of the (c. 75), following the recommendations of a government committee chaired by Sir Ronald Edwards. The CAA has been a public corporation of the Department for Transport since then. The Air Registration Board became the Airworthiness Division of the Authority.
The (c. 16) was an act of Parliament to address evolving conditions, and currently governs air flight in the UK.

Responsibility for air traffic control in the UK passed to NATS in the run-up to the establishment of its public-private partnership in 2001.

The priorities of the chair, as recorded by letter upon the accession to government of the Cameron–Clegg coalition were, chief amongst others:
* to continue to develop UK State Safety Programme to meet ICAO requirements
* to set a cross-industry agenda in order to address potential safety risks
* to take action to foster a risk-based and proportionate safety management capability
* to work with European and International partners in order to drive global standards in safety improvement

From 1 April 2014, the CAA took over a number of aviation security functions from the Department for Transport. The new Directorate of Aviation Security within the CAA now manages rule-making and compliance to deliver proportionate and focussed regulation for UK aviation to ensure the highest standards of security across the civil aviation sector. Air Safety Support International, a subsidiary of the CAA, is responsible for air safety in the British Overseas Territories. The CAA also manages all national security vetting for the aviation industry.

The United Kingdom was a member of the Joint Aviation Authorities, which became the European Aviation Safety Agency. Following Brexit and a transition period, the United Kingdom left EASA on 31 December 2020. The transport secretary Grant Shapps said &quot;As you would expect from an independent nation, we can&#x27;t be subject to the rules and laws made by somebody else, so we can&#x27;t accept rules from the EU commission and we can&#x27;t accept rulings in terms of court cases from the European court of justice or anybody else, any more than the US would&quot;.

===Leadership===

====Chair====
Guy Francis Johnson (formerly Secretary of the ARB) succeeded Lord Brabazon as chairman on his retirement. GFJ died in February 1969.

Sir Nigel Foulkes was Chairman of the CAA from 1977 to 1982, coming into the post from five years of chairing the British Airports Authority.

Sir Roy McNulty (−2009) was in post as chair for eight years until his retirement in 2009.

Dame Deirdre Hutton (August 2009 – August 2020) was appointed to chair the CAA in 2009 by Transport Secretary Geoff Hoon. and was still posted in 2017.

Sir Stephen Hillier (August 2020 – ) was approved by Parliament in June 2020 and took the post in August of the same year.

====Chief Executive====

Andrew Haines was Chief Executive until 2018 when his term of office was allowed to expire normally. On 30 November 2017, the board appointed Richard Moriarty to replace him. He acceded the job in summer 2018, and served for 10 years before stepping down.

After a short period serving as joint-interim CEO, on 21 October 2023, Rob Bishton took over as the new Chief Executive.

==Geography==

The CAA head office is located in Aviation House on the grounds of Gatwick Airport in Crawley, Sussex. The Authority relocated from its previous London head office in early 2019, moving its head office functions to its existing office at Aviation House, as well as opening a new London branch office at Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf by that July.

==GA regulation==
General aviation is an official category that covers a wide range of unscheduled air activity such as flying clubs and training establishments. In 2013 the CAA announced a new approach to regulating GA which will be more proportionate. A new dedicated GA unit was established in 2014 www.caa.co.uk/ga

=== CAA Flying Unit ===

The CAA was also responsible for the calibration of navigation and approach aids until the Flight Calibration Services group was privatised and sold to Flight Precision Ltd in 1996.

The history of the Civil Aviation Flying Unit (CAFU) can be traced back to the Air Ministry&#x27;s Civil Operations Fleet founded in 1944. The CAA and its predecessors have operated 49 aircraft of 13, primarily British, aircraft types including de Havilland Tiger Moths, Avro Ansons, Airspeed Consuls, Percival Princes, de Havilland Doves, Hawker Siddeley HS 748s and Hawker Siddeley HS 125s.

The roles performed by CAFU aircraft included:
* Calibration and testing of radio/radar navigational aids in the UK and overseas
* Flight testing of candidates for the initial issue of commercial pilots&#x27; licences, instrument ratings and instructor ratings
* Training and testing of authorised instrument and type-rating examiners
* Carriage of Government Ministers, MEPs and other officials
* Charter flights for Dan-Air Services Ltd
* Radar target flying for the College of Air Traffic Control
* Ordnance Survey photographic flights
* Airport lighting inspections
* Aerodrome categorisation and evaluation flights
* Trials of new equipment and procedures, e.g. Microwave Landing Systems, ground proximity warning systems, Extended Range Twin-engine Operations (ETOPS)
* Refresher flying for Flight Operations Inspectors and other staff
* Educational flights for local schools,

Beyond the privatisation of the calibration service in 1996, the Civil Aviation Authority operated two HS 125-700 aircraft successively up until 2002, providing conversion and continuation flying for professional CAA pilots, conducting radar trials for National Air Traffic Services (NATS) and serving the CAA, NATS and Highlands &amp; Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) in the communications role.

Previous to the privatisation, Stansted Airport had been the home of Flight Calibration; however, in 1996 the department was moved to Teesside Airport near Darlington (County Durham) with the photographic laboratory services contracted out to a local company, HighLight Photographics.

=== CAA Signals Training Establishment (STE) – Bletchley Park===
In the early 70&#x27;s CAASTE was based in Block D with further Navigation Aid and Radar classrooms on the northwest corner of the park (now occupied by housing). The STE trained technicians to maintain airport and en-route telecommunications and navigational aids for UK airport and en-route services, including telecommunications, navigational aids and radar.

A two-to-three-year locally domiciled apprenticeship trained technicians who were then posted to airports or en-route centres for on-going employment. STE also provided training facilities for existing technicians to keep up to date with technological developments or to enhance their skills on a broader range of equipments.

Apprentices had exclusive use of the &#x27;AT Club&#x27; (Apprentice Technicians Club) and also to the Bletchley Park &#x27;Radio Shack&#x27;, based in the old DF hut near the entrance to Block D, with a call-sign of &#x27;G4BWD&#x27; – &#x27;Golf Four Building Works Department&#x27;, able to access the 2-metre band, with a Yagi attached to the remnant of the DF antenna on top of the building, and a &quot;long wire&quot; for HF use.

In 1974, STE developed a newer training course, reducing training to a one-to-two-year period for higher-qualified (&#x27;A&#x27;-level and beyond) entrants, nicknamed &#x27;Super-ATs&#x27; or &#x27;Super-Techs&#x27;.

=== CAA College of Telecommunications Engineering (CTE) – Bletchley ===
In 1975/1976, the &#x27;Signals Training Establishment&#x27; was renamed the &#x27;College of Telecommunications Engineering&#x27;, with &#x27;Apprentice Technicians&#x27; being re-badged as &#x27;Engineer Cadets&#x27;, no longer passing out as &#x27;Radio Technicians&#x27; but as &#x27;Air Traffic Engineers&#x27;.

<doc id="684739" wikidata="Q2976161" url="?curid=684739" title="1982–83 snooker world rankings">
<text>The World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, the governing body for professional snooker, first published official world rankings for players on the main tour for the 1976–77 season. Before this, for each tournament the defending champion was seeded first, and the previous year&#x27;s runner-up second.

For the 1982–83 season, players&#x27; performances in the previous three World Snooker Championships (1980, 1981 and 1982) contributed to their points total. For each of the three years, the World Champion gained five points, the runner-up received four, losing semi-finalists got three, losing quarter-finalists got two, and losers in the last-16 round received a single point. For players with no points, placings were determined on the basis of their results at the 1982 World Championship.

Ray Reardon, who had topped every previous ranking list except during 1981/1982, returned to first position, with nine points. The player whom Reardon replaced as number one, Cliff Thorburn, had eight points and dropped to third position. Also with eight points, Alex Higgins was ranked ahead of Thorburn by virtue of better progress at the 1982 championship. Higgins had two ranking points deducted for misconduct which meant that he was ranked second rather than first. The penalty was applied in respect of Higgins&#x27;s conduct at an exhibition match at Herringthorpe Leisure Centre in February 1981, when he was late returning to his match against Steve Davis, reportedly because he was playing &quot;Space Invaders&quot;. Davis moved down two places from second to fourth, while Terry Griffiths fell from third to fourteenth. The top sixteen players in the rankings were seeded through to the main stage of the 1983 World Snooker Championship.

==Rankings==
The world rankings for professional snooker players in the 1982–1983 season are listed below. Points gained in each of the three World Snooker Championships are shown, with the total number of points given in the last column. A &quot;–&quot; symbol indicates that the player did not participate in that year&#x27;s championship.

<text>Gregg Wesley Toland (May 29, 1904 – September 28, 1948) was an American cinematographer known for his innovative use of techniques such as deep focus, examples of which can be found in his work on Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941), William Wyler&#x27;s &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946), and John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;, and &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (both, 1940). He is also known for his work as a director of photography for &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939), &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940), &quot;Ball of Fire&quot; (1941), &quot;The Outlaw&quot; (1943), &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946) and &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1947).

Toland earned six Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography, and won for his work on &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. He was voted one of the top ten most influential cinematographers in the history of film by the International Cinematographers Guild in 2003.

==Career==
Toland was born in Charleston, Illinois, on May 29, 1904, to Jennie, a housekeeper, and Frank Toland. His mother moved to California several years after his parents divorced in 1910.

Toland got his start in the film industry at the age of 15, working as an office boy at the Fox studio. He became an assistant cameraman a year later. 

His trademark chiaroscuro, side-lit style originated by accident: while shooting the short film &quot;The Life and Death of 9413: a Hollywood Extra&quot; (1928), one of two available 400W bulbs burned out, leaving only a single bulb for lighting.

During the 1930s, Toland became the youngest cameraman in Hollywood, but soon became one of its most sought-after cinematographers. Over a seven-year span (1936–1942), he was nominated five times for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography, winning only once, for his work on &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939). He worked with many of the leading directors of his era, including John Ford, Howard Hawks, Erich von Stroheim, King Vidor, Orson Welles and William Wyler.

Just before his death, he was concentrating on the &quot;ultimate focus&quot; lens to make near and far objects equally distinct. &quot;Just before he died he had worked out a new lens with which he had made spectacular shots. He carried in his wallet a strip of film taken with this lens, of which he was very proud. It was a shot of a face three inches from the lens, filling one-third of the left side of the frame. Three feet from the lens, in the center of the foreground, was another face, and then, over a hundred yards away was the rear wall of the studio, showing telephone wires and architectural details. Everything was in focus, from three inches to infinity&quot;.

Toland died in his sleep in Los Angeles, California, on September 28, 1948, of coronary thrombosis at the age of 44.

==&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;==

Some film historians believe &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;″s visual brilliance was due primarily to Toland&#x27;s contributions, rather than director Orson Welles&#x27;. Many Welles scholars, however, maintain that the visual style of &quot;Kane&quot; is similar to many of Welles&#x27;s other films, and hence should be considered the director&#x27;s work. Nevertheless, the Welles movies that most resemble &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (&quot;The Magnificent Ambersons&quot;, &quot;The Stranger&quot;, and &quot;Touch of Evil&quot;) were shot by Toland collaborators Stanley Cortez and Russell Metty (at RKO).

In a 1970 interview on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, Welles told the story of how he met Toland, whom Welles considered &quot;the greatest cameraman who ever lived&quot;. Although &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was Welles&#x27;s first feature, it was Toland—whom Welles already knew by reputation—who sought out Welles:

[Toland] came to my office and said, &quot;I want to work in your picture. My name is Toland.&quot; And I said, &quot;Why do you, Mr. Toland?&quot; And he said, &quot;Because you&#x27;ve never made a picture. You don&#x27;t know what cannot be done.&quot; So I said, &quot;But I really don&#x27;t! Can you tell me?&quot; And [Toland] said, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing to it.&quot; And [he] gave me a day-and-a-half lesson—and he was right!

While shooting &quot;Kane&quot;, Welles and Toland (among others) insisted that Welles gave lighting instructions that fall normally under the director of photography&#x27;s responsibility. Many of the transitions in the film are done as lighting cues on set (such as the transition at the opening of the film from the outside of Xanadu into Kane&#x27;s bedroom for his death), where lights are dimmed up and down on stage. Apparently, Welles was unaware that one could achieve the effects optically on a film so he instructed the crew to dim the lights as they would have done on a theater production, which led to the unique dissolves. Different areas of the frame dissolve at different times, based on the lighting cue. However, the visuals were truly a collaboration, as Toland contributed great amounts of technical expertise that Welles needed so that he could achieve his vision. Years later, Welles acknowledged: &quot;Toland was advising him on camera placement and lighting effects secretly so the young director would not be embarrassed in front of the highly experienced crew.&quot;

===Cinematography innovations ===
Toland&#x27;s techniques were revolutionary in the art of cinematography. Cinematographers before him used a shallow depth of field to separate the various planes on the screen, creating an impression of space as well as stressing what mattered in the frame by leaving the rest (the foreground or background) out of focus. 

In Toland&#x27;s lighting schemes, shadow became a much more compelling tool, both dramatically and pictorially, to separate the foreground from the background and so to create space within a two-dimensional frame while keeping all of the picture in focus. According to Toland, this visual style was more comparable with what the eyes see in real life since vision blurs what is not looked at rather than what is. 

For John Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; (1940), Toland leaned more heavily on back-projection to create his deep focus compositions, such as the shot of the island women singing to entice the men of the &quot;SS Glencairn&quot;. He continued to develop the technologies that would allow for him to create his images in &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. 

===Deep focus and lighting techniques===
Toland innovated extensively on &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, creating deep focus on a sound-stage, collaborating with set designer Perry Ferguson so ceilings would be visible in the frame by stretching bleached muslin to stand in as a ceiling, allowing placement of the microphone closer to the action without being seen in frame. He also modified the Mitchell Camera to allow a wider range of movement, especially from low angles. ″It was Toland who devised a remote-control system for focusing his camera lens without having to get in the way of the camera operator who would now be free to pan and tilt the camera.&quot;

The main way to achieve deep focus was closing down the aperture, which required increasing the lighting intensity, lenses with better light transmission, and faster film stock. On &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, the cameras and coated lenses used were of Toland&#x27;s own design working in conjunction with engineers from Caltech. His lenses were treated with Vard Opticoat to reduce glare and increase light transmission. He used the Kodak Super XX film stock, which was, at the time, the fastest film available, with an ASA film speed of 100. Toland had worked closely with a Kodak representative during the stock&#x27;s creation before its release in October 1938, and was one of the first cinematographers using it heavily on set.

Lens apertures employed on most productions were usually within the f/2.3 to f/3.5 range; Toland shot his scenes in between f/8 and f/16. This was possible because several elements of technology came together at once: the technicolor three strip process, which required the development of more powerful lights, had been developed and the more powerful Carbon Arc light was beginning to be used. By utilizing these lights with the faster stock, Toland was able to achieve apertures previously unattainable on a stage shoot.

===Optical print shots and in-camera composites===
Gregg Toland collaborated on a number of shots with special-effects cinematographer Linwood G. Dunn. Although these looked like they were using deep focus, they were actually a composite of two different shots. Some of these shots were composited with an optical printer, a device which Dunn improved upon over the years, which explains why foreground and background are both in focus even though the lenses and film stock used in 1941 could not allow for such depth of field. 

But Toland strongly disliked this technique, since he felt he was &quot;duping,&quot; (i.e. a copy of a copy) thereby lowering the quality of his shots. Thus other shots (like the shot of Susan Alexander Kane&#x27;s bedroom after her suicide attempt, with a glass in the foreground and Kane entering the room in the background) were in-camera composites, meaning the film was exposed twice—another technique that Linwood Dunn improved upon. 

===&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot;===
Toland had already had experience with heavy in-camera compositing, and many of the shots in &quot;Kane&quot; look similar in composition and dynamics to a number of shots in Ford&#x27;s &quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot;.

For instance, both movies contain shots that create an artificial lighting situation such that a character is lit in the background and walks or runs through dark areas to the foreground, where his arrival triggers, off-screen, a light not on before. The result is so visually dramatic because a character moves, only barely visible, through vast pools of shadow, only to exit the shadow very close to the camera, where his whole face is suddenly completely lit. This use of much more shadow than light, soon one of the main techniques of low-key lighting, heavily influenced film noir.

&quot;The Long Voyage Home&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; share a number of other striking similarities:

*Both films allowed lenses at times to distort faces in close-up, especially during low-key lighting sequences described above.
*Sets, both interiors and exteriors, were lit mostly from the floor instead of from the rafters high above. A radical departure from Hollywood&#x27;s traditional lighting, this technique also took much longer to execute, thus contributing significantly to production costs. However, the effect was strikingly more realistic, since light sources placed closer to the characters allowed softer lighting, which lights placed far above the set could not produce. 
*Both directors, Welles as well as Ford, put Toland&#x27;s credit as cinematographer on screen at the same time as their own credit as director (director/producer in Welles&#x27;s case), an unusual and conspicuously generous tribute; in both films, Toland&#x27;s credit was also the same size as the director&#x27;s.

===Credit===

In addition to sharing a title card with Toland on &quot;Kane&quot; — an indication of the high esteem the director held for his cameraman — Welles also gave him a cameo in the film as the reporter who is slow to ask questions when Kane returns from Europe. Welles called Toland: &quot;the greatest gift any director—young or old—could ever, ever have. And he never tried to impress on us that he was performing miracles. He just went ahead and performed them. I was calling on him to do things only a beginner could be ignorant enough to think anybody could ever do, and there he was, &quot;doing&quot; them.&quot;

Toland was the subject of an &quot;Annals of Hollywood&quot; article in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;The Cameraman&quot;, by Hilton Als (June 19, 2006, p. 46).

==Other important works==
Although &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is his most highly regarded achievement, his style was much more varied. For &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1940), he took inspiration from Dorothea Lange&#x27;s photographs, achieving a rare (for Hollywood) gritty and realist look. For one of his final projects, Toland turned to Technicolor film. Made for Disney, the &quot;Song of the South&quot; (1946) combined animation with live action in bright, deeply saturated Technicolor. In &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (also 1946), his deep focus cinematography served to highlight all the aspects of the characters&#x27; lives.

==Service during World War II==
When the Office of the Coordinator of Information (predecessor to the Office of Strategic Services and later the Central Intelligence Agency) was created by Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the United States&#x27; entry into World War II, Toland was recruited to work in the agency&#x27;s film unit. Toland was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Navy&#x27;s camera department, which led to his only work as a director, &quot;December 7th&quot; (1943). This documentary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, which Toland co-directed with John Ford, is so realistic in its restaged footage that many today mistake it for actual attack footage. This 82-minute film was trimmed by censors into a 20-minute version, which took the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject), and was released in its entirety in 1991.

==Legacy==
The results of a survey conducted in 2003 by the International Cinematographers Guild placed Toland in the top ten of history&#x27;s most influential cinematographers.

The 2006 Los Angeles edition of &quot;CineGear&quot; assembled a distinguished panel composed of Owen Roizman, László Kovács, Daryn Okada, Rodrigo Prieto, Russell Carpenter, Dariusz Wolski and others. Called &quot;Dialogue With ASC Cinematographers&quot;, the panel was asked to name two or three other cinematographers, living or dead, who had influenced their work or whom they considered to be the best of the best. Each panel member cited Gregg Toland first.

<text>Frá dauða Sinfjötla (&quot;On the death of Sinfjötli&quot;) is a short prose piece found in the Codex Regius manuscript of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. It describes the death of Sinfjötli, son of [[Sigmund]]r, connecting &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot; and &quot;Grípisspá&quot;.

[[Borghild]]r, wife of Sigmundr, wanted Sinfjötli, her stepson, dead, as Sinfjötli had killed her brother. Now it is said, that Sigmundr was so tough, that he could withstand any kind of poison, but his sons could only tolerate it on their skins. Borghildr gave them ale, which Sinfjötli recognized as poisoned. He excused himself for two rounds, but when she brought him the third horn, his father, now drunk, said: &quot;Let your beard filter it, son!&quot; Sinfjötli drank and died at once.

The piece is normally published in editions of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;.

<text>Robert Betts Laughlin (born November 1, 1950) is the Anne T. and Robert M. Bass Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Stanford University. Along with Horst L. Störmer of Columbia University and Daniel C. Tsui of Princeton University, he was awarded a share of the 1998 Nobel Prize in physics for their explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect.

In 1983, Laughlin was first to provide a many body wave function, now known as the &quot;Laughlin wavefunction,&quot; for the fractional quantum hall effect, which was able to correctly explain the fractionalized charge observed in experiments. This state has since been interpreted as the integer quantum Hall effect of the composite fermion.

His 2017 paper, &quot;Pumped thermal grid storage with heat exchange&quot; inspired Project Malta at Google X and subsequently Malta inc.

==Biography==
Laughlin was born in Visalia, California. He earned a B.A. in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley in 1972, and his Ph.D. in physics in 1979 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Between 2004 and 2006, he served as the president of KAIST in Daejeon, South Korea.

== Honors and awards ==
* E. O. Lawrence Award in Physics – 1984
* Oliver E. Buckley Prize – 1986
* Elected Fellow of the American Physical Society - 1986

<doc id="684754" wikidata="Q332626" url="?curid=684754" title="Francesco Crispi">
<text>Francesco Crispi (4 October 1818 – 11 August 1901) was an Italian patriot and statesman. He was among the main protagonists of the Risorgimento, a close friend and supporter of Giuseppe Mazzini and Giuseppe Garibaldi, and one of the architects of Italian unification in 1860. Crispi served as Prime Minister of Italy for six years, from 1887 to 1891, and again from 1893 to 1896, and was the first prime minister from Southern Italy. Crispi was internationally famous and often mentioned along with world statesmen such as Otto von Bismarck, William Ewart Gladstone, and Lord Salisbury.

Originally an Italian patriot and democrat liberal during his first term in office, Crispi went on to become a bellicose authoritarian prime minister and an ally and admirer of Bismarck in his second. He was indefatigable in stirring up hostility toward France. His career ended amid controversy and failure: he got involved in a major banking scandal and fell from power in 1896 after the devastating loss of the Battle of Adwa, which repelled Italy&#x27;s colonial ambitions over Ethiopia. Due to his authoritarian policies and style, Crispi is often regarded as a strongman and seen as a precursor of the Italian Fascist dictator Benito Mussolini.

==Early life==
Crispi&#x27;s paternal family came originally from the small agricultural community of Palazzo Adriano, in south-western Sicily. It had been founded in the later fifteenth century by Orthodox Christian Albanians (Arbëreshë), who settled in Sicily after the Ottoman conquest of Albania. His grandfather was an Arbëreshë Orthodox priest; the parish priests were married men, and Arbëreshë was the family language down to the lifetime of the young Crispi. 

Crispi himself was born in Ribera, Sicily, to Tommaso Crispi, a grain merchant and Giuseppa Genova from Ribera; he was baptised as a Greek Catholic. Belonging to a family of Arbëreshë descent, he spoke Italian as his third or fourth language, alongside Arbëresh (variant of Albanian), Greek and probably Sicilian. His uncle Giuseppe wrote the first monograph on the Albanian language.

A philhellene, Crispi wrote in an 1859 diary entry he was Greek due to Greek–Albanian ancestry and attributed part of his origins to Greece. In an 1885 telegram on the Albanian question, Crispi stated he was &quot;an Albanian by blood and heart&quot; and an Italo–Albanian from Sicily. 

At the age of five, he was sent to a family in Villafranca, where he could receive an education. In 1829, at 11 years old, he attended a seminary in Palermo, where he studied classical subjects. The rector of the institute was Giuseppe Crispi, his uncle. Crispi attended the seminary until 1834 or 1835, when his father, after becoming mayor of Ribera, encountered major difficulties in health and finances.

In the same period, Crispi became a close friend of the poet and doctor Vincenzo Navarro, whose friendship marked his initiation to the Romanticism. In 1835 he studied law and literature at the University of Palermo receiving a law degree in 1837; in the same year, he fell in love with Rosina D&#x27;Angelo, the daughter of a goldsmith. Despite his father&#x27;s ban, Crispi married Rosina in 1837, when she was already pregnant. In May Crispi became the father of his first daughter, Giuseppa, who was named after his grandmother. It was a brief marriage: Rosina died on 29 July 1839, the day after giving birth to her second son, Tommaso; the child lived only a few hours and in December, also Giuseppa died.

Between 1838 and 1839, Crispi founded his own newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Oreteo&quot;, from the name of the Sicilian river Oreto. This experience brought him into contact with a number of political figures including the Neapolitan liberal activist and poet, Carlo Poerio. In 1842 Crispi wrote about the necessity to educate poor people, about the huge damage caused by the excessive wealth of the Catholic Church and regarding the need for all citizens, including women, to be equal before the law.

In 1845 Crispi took up a judgeship in Naples, where he distinguished himself for his liberal and revolutionary ideas.

==1848 Sicilian uprising==

On 20 December 1847, Crispi was sent to Palermo along with Salvatore Castiglia, a diplomat and patriot, to prepare the revolution against the Bourbon monarchy and King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies.
The revolution started on 12 January 1848, and therefore was the very first of the numerous revolutions to occur that year. Three revolutions had previously occurred on the island of Sicily starting from 1800 against Bourbon rule. The uprising was substantially organized from, and centred in, Palermo. The popular nature of the revolt is evident in the fact that posters and notices were being handed out a full three days before the substantive acts of the revolution occurred on 12 January 1848. The timing was deliberately planned, by Crispi and the other revolutionaries, to coincide with the birthday of Ferdinand II.

The Sicilian nobles were immediately able to resuscitate the constitution of 1812, which included the principles of representative democracy and the centrality of Parliament in the government of the state. Vincenzo Fardella was elected president of Sicilian Parliament. The idea was also put forward for a confederation of all the states of Italy.

The constitution was quite advanced for its time in liberal democratic terms, as was the proposal of an Italian confederation of states. Crispi was appointed a member of the provisional Sicilian Parliament and responsible for the Defence Committee; during his tenure, he supported the separatist movement that wanted to break ties with Naples.

Thus Sicily survived as a quasi-independent state for sixteen months, with the Bourbon army taking back full control of the island on 15 May 1849 by force. The effective head of state during this period was Ruggero Settimo. On capitulating to the Bourbons, Settimo escaped to Malta where he was received with the full honours of a head of state. Unlike many, Crispi was not granted amnesty and was forced to flee the country.

==Exile==
After leaving Sicily, Crispi took refuge in Marseille, France, where he met the woman who would become his second wife, Rose Montmasson, born five years after him in Haute-Savoie (which at that time belonged to the Kingdom of Sardinia) in a family of farmers.
In 1849, he moved to Turin, the capital of the Kingdom of Sardinia, where he worked as a journalist. During this period he became a friend of Giuseppe Mazzini, a republican politician, journalist and activist. In 1853 Crispi was implicated in the Mazzini conspiracy and was arrested by the Piedmontese policy and sent to Malta. Here, on 27 December 1854, he married Rose Montmasson.

Then he moved to London where he became a revolutionary conspirator and continued his close friendship with Mazzini, involving himself in the exile politics of the national movement, abandoning Sicilian separatism.

On 10 January 1856, he moved to Paris, where he continued his work as a journalist. On 22 August, he was informed that his father had died and that three years earlier also his mother had died, but that news had been hidden by his father who did not want to increase his sorrows.

===Assassination attempt on Napoleon III===

On the evening of 14 January 1858, as the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie de Montijo were on their way to the theatre in the Rue Le Peletier, the precursor of the Opera Garnier, to see, rather ironically, Rossini&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot;, the Italian revolutionary Felice Orsini and his accomplices threw three bombs at the imperial carriage. The first bomb landed among the horsemen in front of the carriage. The second bomb wounded the animals and smashed the carriage glass. The third bomb landed under the carriage and seriously wounded a policeman who was hurrying to protect the occupants. Eight people were killed and 142 wounded, though the emperor and empress were unhurt.

Orsini himself was wounded on the right temple and stunned. He tended his wounds and returned to his lodgings, where police found him the next day.

Of the five conspirators, only one remained unidentified. In 1908 (seven years after Crispi&#x27;s death) one of them, Charles DeRudio, claimed to have seen, half an hour before the attack, a man approaching and talking with Orsini, and recognized him as Crispi. But no evidence has ever been found regarding Crispi&#x27;s role in the attack. Anyway on 7 August 1858, he was expelled from France.

==In Sicily with Garibaldi==
===Expedition of the Thousand===

In June 1859 Crispi returned to Italy after publishing a letter repudiating the aggrandizement of Piedmont in the Italian unification. He proclaimed himself a republican and a partisan of national unity. He travelled around Italy under various disguises and with counterfeit passports. Twice in that year he went the round of the Sicilian cities in disguise preparing the insurrectionist movement of 1860. Crispi briefly visited Greece in October 1859.
He helped persuade Giuseppe Garibaldi to sail with his Expedition of the Thousand, which disembarked on Sicily on 11 May 1860. The Expedition was formed by a corps of volunteers led by Garibaldi, who landed in Sicily in order to conquer the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, ruled by the Bourbons. The project was an ambitious and risky venture aiming to conquer, with a thousand men, a kingdom with a larger regular army and a more powerful navy. The expedition was a success and concluded with a plebiscite that brought Naples and Sicily into the Kingdom of Sardinia, the last territorial conquest before the creation of the Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861.

The sea venture was the only desired action that was jointly decided by the &quot;four fathers of the nation&quot; Giuseppe Mazzini, Giuseppe Garibaldi, Victor Emmanuel II, and Camillo Cavour, pursuing divergent goals. Crispi utilized his political influence to bolster the Italian unification project.

The various groups participated in the expedition for a variety of reasons: for Garibaldi, it was to achieve a united Italy; for the Sicilian bourgeoisie, an independent Sicily as part of the kingdom of Italy, and for the mass farmers, land distribution and the end of oppression.

===Garibaldi dictatorship===
After the fall of Palermo, Crispi was appointed First Secretary of State in the provisional government; shortly a struggle began between Garibaldi&#x27;s government and the emissaries of Cavour on the question of timing of the annexation of Sicily by Italy. It established a Sicilian Army and a fleet of the Dictatorship Government of Sicily.

The pace of Garibaldi&#x27;s victories had worried Cavour, who in early July sent to the provisional government a proposal of immediate annexation of Sicily to Piedmont. Garibaldi, however, refused vehemently to allow such a move until the end of the war. Cavour&#x27;s envoy, Giuseppe La Farina, was arrested and expelled from the island. He was replaced by the more malleable Agostino Depretis, who gained Garibaldi&#x27;s trust and was appointed as pro-dictator.

During the dictatorial government of Garibaldi, Crispi secured the resignation of the pro-dictator Depretis, and continued his fierce opposition to Cavour.

In Naples, Garibaldi&#x27;s provisional government was largely controlled by Cavour. Crispi, who arrived in the city in mid-September, tried to increase his power and influence, at the expense of Cavour&#x27;s loyalists. However, the revolutionary impulse that had animated the Expedition was fading, especially after the Battle of Volturnus.

On 3 October 1860, to seal an alliance with King Victor Emmanuel II, Garibaldi appointed pro-dictator of Naples, Giorgio Pallavicino, a supporter of the House of Savoy. Pallavicino immediately stated that Crispi was unable and inappropriate to hold the office of Secretary of State.

Meanwhile, Cavour stated that Southern Italy would not accept anything but the unconditional annexation to the Kingdom of Sardinia by plebiscite. Crispi, who still had the hope to continue the revolution to rescue Rome and Venice, strongly opposed this solution, proposing to elect a parliamentary assembly. This proposal was also supported by the federalist Carlo Cattaneo. Garibaldi announced that the decision would have been taken by the two pro-dictators of Sicily and Naples, Antonio Mordini and Giorgio Pallavicino, who both opted for the plebiscite. On 13 October Crispi resigned from the government of Garibaldi.

==Member of the Parliament==
The general election of 1861 took place on 27 January, even before the formal birth of the Kingdom of Italy, which took place on 17 March. Francesco Crispi was elected as a member of the Historical Left, in the constituency of Castelvetrano; he would retain his seat in all successive legislatures until the end of his life.

Crispi acquired the reputation of being the most aggressive and most impetuous member of his parliamentary group. He denounced the Right for &quot;diplomatising the revolution&quot;. Personal ambition and restlessness made him difficult to cooperate with and he earned himself the nickname of &quot;Il Solitario&quot; (The Loner). In 1864, he finally deserted Mazzini and announced he was a monarchist, because as he put it in a letter to Mazzini: &quot;The monarchy unites us; the republic would divide us.&quot;

In 1866 he refused to enter Baron Bettino Ricasoli&#x27;s cabinet; in 1867 he worked to impede the Garibaldian invasion of the papal states, foreseeing the French occupation of Rome and the disaster of Mentana. By methods of the same character as those subsequently employed against himself by Felice Cavallotti, he carried on the violent agitation known as the Lobbia affair, in which sundry conservative deputies were, on insufficient grounds, accused of corruption. On the outbreak of the Franco-German War, he worked energetically to impede the projected alliance with France, and to drive the Giovanni Lanza cabinet to Rome. The death of Urbano Rattazzi in 1873 induced Crispi&#x27;s friends to put forward his candidature to the leadership of the Left; but Crispi, anxious to reassure the crown, secured the election of Agostino Depretis.

===President of the Chamber of Deputies===
After the general election in 1876, in which the Left gained almost 70% of votes, Crispi was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies.

During the autumn of 1877, as President of the Chamber, he went to London, Paris and Berlin on a confidential mission, establishing cordial personal relationships with British prime minister William Ewart Gladstone and Foreign Minister Lord Granville and other English statesmen, and with Otto von Bismarck, by then Chancellor of the German Empire. In 1877 during the Great Eastern Crisis Crispi was offered Albania as possible compensation by Bismarck and the British Earl of Derby if Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia, however, he refused and preferred the Italian Alpine regions under Austro-Hungarian rule.

==Minister of the Interior==

In December 1877 he replaced Giovanni Nicotera as Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Depretis. Although his short term of office lasted just 70 days, they were instrumental in establishing a unitary monarchy. Moreover, during his term as minister, Crispi tried to unite the many factions which were part of the Left, at that time.

On 9 January 1878, the death of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and the accession of King Umberto enabled Crispi to secure the formal establishment of a unitary monarchy, the new monarch taking the title of Umberto I of Italy instead of Umberto IV of Savoy.

On 7 February 1878, the death of Pope Pius IX necessitated a conclave, the first to be held after the unification of Italy. Crispi, helped by Mancini and Cardinal Pecci (afterwards Leo XIII), persuaded the Sacred College to hold the conclave in Rome, establishing the legitimacy of the capital.

==Bigamy scandal and political isolation==
The statesmanlike qualities displayed on this occasion were insufficient to avert the storm of indignation of Crispi&#x27;s opponents when he was accused of bigamy. When he remarried, a woman he had married in 1853 was still living. But a court ruled that Crispi&#x27;s 1853 marriage on Malta was invalid because it was contracted while another woman he had married yet earlier was also still alive. By the time of his third marriage, his first wife had died and his marriage to his second wife was legally invalid. Therefore, his marriage to his third wife was ruled valid and not bigamous. He was nevertheless compelled to resign office after only three months in March 1878, bringing down the whole government with him.
For nine years Crispi remained politically under a cloud, leading the &quot;progressive&quot; opposition. In 1881 Crispi was among the main supporters of the universal male suffrage, which was approved by the government of Agostino Depretis.

===Pentarchy===

In 1883 the leaders of the Left, Agostino Depretis, and the Right, Marco Minghetti, formed an alliance based on a flexible centrist coalition of government which isolated the extremes of the left and the right; these politics was known as &quot;Trasformismo&quot;. Crispi, who was a strong supporter of two-party system, strongly opposed it and founded a progressive and radical parliamentary group called Dissident Left. The group was also known as &quot;The Pentarchy&quot;, due to its five leaders, Giuseppe Zanardelli, Benedetto Cairoli, Giovanni Nicotera, Agostino Magliani, Alfredo Beccarini and Crispi.

The party supported authoritarian and progressive internal policies, expansionism and Germanophile foreign policies, and protectionist economy policies.

After the general elections in May 1886, in which the Dissident Left gained almost 20% of votes, Crispi returned to office as Minister of the Interior in the Depretis cabinet. Following Depretis&#x27;s death on 29 July 1887 Crispi, abandoned the Dissident Left and became the leader of the Left group; he was also appointed, by the King, Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

==First term as Prime Minister==
On 29 July 1887, Francesco Crispi was sworn in as the new prime minister. He was the first one from Southern Italy. Crispi immediately distinguished himself, for being a reformist leader, but his political style provoked many protests from his opponents, who accused him of being an authoritarian Prime Minister and a strongman.
True to his initial progressive leanings he moved ahead with stalled reforms, abolishing the death penalty, revoking anti-strike laws, limiting police powers, and reforming the penal code and the administration of justice with the help of his Minister of Justice Giuseppe Zanardelli, reorganising charities and passing public health laws and legislation to protect emigrants that worked abroad. He sought popular support for the state with a programme of orderly development at home and expansion abroad.

===Internal policy===

One of the most important acts was the reform regarding the central administration of the State, with which Crispi strengthened the role of the Prime Minister. The bill aimed to separate the roles of the government from those of parliament, trying to untie the first by the political games of the second. The first point of the law was to give the cabinet the right to decide on the number and functions of the ministries. The prospect was also to keep the King (as well as provide the Albertine Statute) free to decide on the organization of the various ministries. Moreover, the reform provided the establishment of secretaries, who were supposed to help ministers and, at the same time, do them as spokesmen in parliament. The reform was heavily criticized by the Rightist opposition but also by the Far Left. On 9 December 1887, it was approved by the Chamber of Deputies.
In 1889 Crispi&#x27;s government promoted a reform of the magistracy and promulgated a new penal code, which unified penal legislation in Italy, abolished the death sentence and recognised the right to strike. The code was regarded as a great work by contemporary European jurists. The code was named after Giuseppe Zanardelli, then Minister of Justice, who promoted the approval of the code.

Another important reform was that of local government, or &quot;comuni&quot;, which was approved by the Chamber in July 1888, in just three weeks. The new reform almost doubled the local electorate, incrementing the suffrage. But the most controversial part of the law was related to the mayors, who were previously appointed by the government, and who would now be elected by the electors, in the municipalities with more than 10,000 inhabitants and in all the provincial capitals. The law also introduced the office of the prefect. The reform was approved by the Senate in December 1888 and entered into force in February 1889.

On 22 December 1888, the Freemason Crispi enacted the first Italian law for the national healthcare system including the cremation after a cholera pandemic in 1884–1885 cholera pandemic killing approximately 50,000 persons, with a serious outbreak in the city of Naples in August-September 1884. Crispi was also the first politician to have implemented the role of the Italian lay state in the fields of charity and solidarity which till then had been traditionally kept a monopoly of private citizens and organizations, mainly of the Italian Roman Catholic Church that strongly adversed his reforms.

===Foreign policy===

As prime minister in the 1880s and 1890s Crispi pursued an aggressive foreign policy to strengthen Italy&#x27;s beleaguered institutions. He saw France as the permanent enemy and he counted heavily on British support. Britain was on good terms with France and refused to help, leaving Crispi perplexed and ultimately disillusioned about what he had felt was a special friendship between the two countries. He turned to imperialism in Africa, especially against the independent kingdom of Ethiopia, and the Ottoman province of Tripolitania (in present-day Libya).

====Relations with Germany====

One of his first acts as premier was a visit to the German chancellor Otto von Bismarck, whom he desired to consult upon the working of the Triple Alliance.

Basing his foreign policy upon the alliance, as supplemented by the naval entente with Great Britain negotiated by his predecessor, Carlo Felice Nicolis di Robilant, Crispi assumed a resolute attitude towards France, breaking off the prolonged and unfruitful negotiations for a new Franco-Italian commercial treaty, and refusing the French invitation to organize an Italian section at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. The Triple Alliance committed Italy to a possible war with France, requiring a vast increase in the already heavy Italian military expenditure, making the alliance unpopular in Italy. As part of his anti-French foreign policy, Crispi began a tariff war with France in 1888. The Franco-Italian trade war was an economic disaster for Italy which over a ten-year period was to cost two billion lire in lost exports, and was ended in 1898 with the Italians agreeing to end their tariffs on French goods in exchange for the French ending their tariffs on Italian goods.

====Colonial policy====
Francesco Crispi was a patriot and an Italian nationalist, and his desire to make Italy a colonial power led to conflicts with France, which rejected Italian claims to Tunisia and opposed Italian expansion elsewhere in Africa.

Under Crispi&#x27;s rule, Italy signed the Treaty of Wuchale; it was a deal reached by King Menelik II of Shewa, later the Emperor of Ethiopia with Count Pietro Antonelli in the town of Wuchale, on 2 May 1889. The treaty stated that the regions of Bogos, Hamasien, Akkele Guzay, and Serae were part of the Italian colony of Eritrea and is the origin of the Italian colony and modern state of Eritrea. Per the Treaty, Italy promised financial assistance and military supplies.

====Albanian question====
In 1859, Crispi wrote a union between Greeks and Albanians would make Italy and Greece become closer. Balkan geopolitics and security concerns drove Italy to seek great power status in the Adriatic sea and Crispi viewed a future autonomous Albania within the Ottoman Empire, or an independent one, as a safeguarded for Italian interests. Crispi believed the Albanians&#x27; interests against Pan-Slavism and Austro-Hungarian expansion were best served through a Greco-Albanian union and he founded in Rome a philhellenic committee that worked toward that goal. Crispi, after becoming prime minister, stimulated and intensified ethnocultural relations between Italo-Albanians and Albanians of the Balkans, moves which were considered as extending Italian influence over Albanians by Austria-Hungary. To counteract Austro-Hungarian influence in northern Albania, Crispi took the initiative and opened the first Italian schools in Shkodër in 1888. Prominent Albanians involved with the Albanian National Awakening such as Abdyl Frashëri and Thimi Mitko corresponded with Crispi over the Albanian question.

====Cerruti affair====
During the conflict between the Italian entrepreneur Ernesto Cerruti and Colombian President Rafael Nuñez Italy mobilized a small naval squadron in 1888 fears were rampant that an Italian armed intervention was imminent on Colombian coasts. Finally, faced with the threat of military intervention and international pressure, the Colombian government opted to submit to international arbitration. In 1891, Pope Leo XIII, who was respected in both countries due to widespread Catholicism, intervened as mediator in the conflict. Under Papal arbitration, an agreement was reached in which Colombia was to pay compensation to Cerruti, although in an amount lower than that originally demanded by Italy.

===Resignation===
The general election in 1890 was an extraordinary triumph for Crispi. Out of 508 deputies, 405 sided with the government. But already in October, the first signs of a political crisis grew up. Emperor Menelik had contested the Italian text of the Wuchale Treaty, stating that it did not oblige Ethiopia to be an Italian protectorate. Menelik informed the foreign press and the scandal erupted. A few days after the Finance Minister and Crispi&#x27;s long-time main political rival, Giovanni Giolitti, abandoned the government.

However, the decisive event was a document published by the new Minister of Finance Bernardino Grimaldi, who revealed that the planned deficit was higher than expected; after that, the government lost its majority with 186 votes against and 123 in favour. Prime Minister Crispi resigned on 6 February 1891.

==After the premiership==
After the fall of Crispi&#x27;s government, Umberto I gave the task of forming the new cabinet to the Marquis Antonio Starabba di Rudinì. The government faced many difficulties since the beginning and in May 1892, Giolitti, who became the new Left leader after Crispi&#x27;s resignation, decided not to support it anymore.

After that, King Umberto I appointed Giolitti as the new prime minister. The first Giolitti cabinet, however, relied on a slender majority and in December 1892 the Prime Minister was involved in a major scandal.

===Banca Romana scandal===

The Banca Romana scandal surfaced in January 1893 in Italy over the bankruptcy of the Banca Romana, one of the six national banks authorised at the time to issue currency. The scandal was the first of many Italian corruption scandals, and, like the others, it discredited the whole political system.

The bank had loaned large sums to property developers but was left with huge liabilities when the real estate bubble collapsed in 1887, but feared that publicity might undermine public confidence and suppressed the report.

Even Umberto I was involved in the scandal and Crispi&#x27;s reputation emerged greatly strengthened: he could overthrow Giolitti&#x27;s government at any time or impair the reputation of the King. Giolitti and his allies defended themselves by trying to collect compromising news against Crispi, but the judicial inquiry into the Banca Romana left the latter essentially harmless.

==Return to power and second term==

In December 1893 the impotence of the Giolitti cabinet to restore public order, menaced by disturbances in Sicily and the Banca Romana scandal, gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power.

===Fasci Siciliani===

The Fasci Siciliani were a popular movement of democratic and socialist inspiration, which arose in Sicily in the years between 1889 and 1894. The Fasci gained the support of the poorest and most exploited classes of the island by channelling their frustration and discontent into a coherent programme based on the establishment of new rights. Consisting of a jumble of traditionalist sentiment, religiosity, and socialist consciousness, the movement reached its apex in the summer of 1893, when new conditions were presented to the landowners and mine owners of Sicily concerning the renewal of sharecropping and rental contracts.

Upon the rejection of these conditions, there was an outburst of strikes that rapidly spread throughout the island, and was marked by violent social conflict, almost rising to the point of insurrection. The leaders of the movement were not able to keep the situation from getting out of control. The proprietors and landowners asked the government to intervene. Giovanni Giolitti tried to put a halt to the manifestations and protests of the Fasci Siciliani, his measures were relatively mild. On 24 November, Giolitti officially resigned as prime minister. In the three weeks of uncertainty before Crispi formed a government on 15 December 1893, the rapid spread of violence drove many local authorities to defy Giolitti&#x27;s ban on the use of firearms.

In December 1893, 92 peasants lost their lives in clashes with the police and army. Government buildings were burned along with flour mills and bakeries that refused to lower their prices when taxes were lowered or abolished.

On 3 January 1894, Crispi declared a state of siege throughout Sicily. Army reservists were recalled and General Roberto Morra di Lavriano was dispatched with 40,000 troops. The old order was restored through the use of extreme force, including summary executions. A solidarity revolt of anarchists and republicans in the Lunigiana was crushed as well.

The repression of the Fasci turned into outright persecution. The government arrested not just the leaders of the movement, but masses of poor farmers, students, professionals, sympathizers of the Fasci, and even those simply suspected of having sympathized with the movement at some point in time, in many cases without any evidence for the accusations. After the declaration of a state of emergency, condemnations were issued for the paltriest of reasons. Many rioters were incarcerated for having shouted things such as &quot;Viva l&#x27;anarchia&quot; or &quot;down with the King&quot;. At Palermo, in April and May 1894, the trials against the central committee of the Fasci took place and this was the final blow that signalled the death knell of the movement of the Fasci Siciliani.

===Financial crisis and assassination attempt===

Crispi steadily supported the energetic remedies adopted by his Minister of Finance Sidney Sonnino to save Italian credit, which had been severely shaken by the financial crisis of 1892–1893 and the Banca Romana scandal. Sonnino&#x27;s proposals were harshly criticized both by members of the Left and the Right, causing his resignation on 4 June 1894; on the following day Crispi resigned too, but the King gave him again the task to form a new government.

On 16 June 1894, the anarchist Paolo Lega tried to shoot Crispi but the attempt failed. On 24 June an Italian anarchist killed French President Carnot. In this climate of increased fear of anarchism, Crispi was able to introduce a series of anti-anarchist laws in July 1894, which were also used against socialists. Heavy penalties were announced for &quot;incitement to class hatred&quot; and police received extended powers of preventive arrest and deportation.

The whole parliament expressed solidarity with the Prime Minister who saw his position considerably strengthened. This favoured the approval of the Sonnino law. The reform saved Italy from the crisis and started the way for economic recovery.

===Giolitti and Cavallotti&#x27;s accusations===
In 1894 he was threatened with expulsion from the Masonic Grande Oriente d&#x27;Italia for being too friendly towards the Catholic Church. He had previously been strongly anticlerical but had become convinced of the need for rapprochement with the Papacy.

At the end of 1894, his long-time rival Giovanni Giolitti tried to discredit Crispi by submitting to parliament a few documents that were supposed to ruin it. It was actually some old papers attesting loans contracted by Crispi and his wife with the Banca Romana.

Moreover, Crispi&#x27;s uncompromising suppression of disorder, and his refusal to abandon either the Triple Alliance or the Eritrean colony, or to forsake his Minister of the Treasury, Sidney Sonnino, caused a breach with the radical leader Felice Cavallotti. Cavallotti began a campaign of defamation against him. Cavallotti himself proposed to establish a commission, which should investigate the relations between Crispi and Banca Romana.

On 15 December the commission published its report and this caused some riots in the Chamber. Crispi, in defence of the institutions, submitted to the King a decree to dissolve parliament. On 13 January 1895 Umberto I dissolved the parliament and Giolitti, who was under trial for the bank scandal, was forced to move to Berlin, because his parliamentary immunity expired, and the risk of being arrested.

Giolitti and Cavallotti&#x27;s attacks were soon renewed more fiercely than ever. They produced little effect and the general election of 1895 gave Crispi a huge majority of 334 seats out of 508. On 25 June 1895, Crispi refused a request to allow a parliamentary inquiry into his role in the Banca Romana scandal, saying as a prime minister he felt he was &quot;invulnerable&quot; because he had &quot;served Italy for 53 years&quot;. Despite his majority, Crispi preferred to rule via royal decree instead of getting legislation passed by parliament, leading to concerns about authoritarianism.

===Italo-Ethiopian War and resignation===
During his second term, Crispi continued his colonial expansionist policy in East Africa. King Umberto I commented that &quot;Crispi wants to occupy everywhere, even China and Japan&quot;. Crispi was strongly supported by the king, who alluding to his personal dislike of him, stated &quot;Crispi is a pig, but a necessary pig&quot;, who despite his corruption, had to stay in power for &quot;the national interest, which is the only thing that matters&quot;. Crispi took a very belligerent line on foreign policy as he, during a three-month period in 1895, talked quite openly about attacking France, sent a naval squadron to the eastern Mediterranean to prepare for a possible war with the Ottoman Empire in order to seize Albania, wanted to send an expeditionary force to seize a city in China, and planned to send a force to South Africa to forcibly mediate the dispute between Great Britain and the Transvaal Republic. Crispi, who favoured a militant anti-French line, wanted to revise the Triple Alliance as the preamble to the Triple Alliance spoke of preserving peace in Europe while &quot;for Italy, it must be the opposite; for us, the Triple Alliance must mean war!&quot; Those who knew him by this stage of his life considered Crispi to be almost mindlessly bellicose as he broke off diplomatic relations with Portugal over a supposed slight, saying he deserved more respect from this &quot;entirely unimportant country&quot; ruled over by a &quot;minuscule monarchy&quot;.    

The main event which occurred during his premiership was the First Italo-Ethiopian War, which originated from a disputed treaty which, the Italians claimed, turned Ethiopia into an Italian protectorate. Much to their surprise, they found that Ethiopian ruler Menelik II, rather than opposed by some of his traditional enemies, was supported by them, and so the Italian army, invading Ethiopia from Italian Eritrea in 1893, faced a more united front than they expected. In addition, Ethiopia was supported by Russia with military advisers, army training, and the sale of weapons. France supported Ethiopia diplomatically in order to prevent Italy from becoming a colonial competitor.

Full-scale war broke out in 1895, with Italian troops under the command of General Oreste Baratieri having initial success until Ethiopian troops counterattacked Italian positions and besieged the Italian fort of Meqele, forcing its surrender. In April 1895, Crispi withdrew part of the Italian army from Ethiopia to save money. He told General Baratieri that if he needed more money to just impose more taxes on the Ethiopians and &quot;copy Napoleon who made war with the money of those he conquered&quot;. Crispi did not understand that Ethiopia was a poor country and the money necessary to sustain a modern army could not possibly be raised from taxing the Ethiopians, causing major problems for the Italian Army in Ethiopia. Through Crispi fought the war against Ethiopia on the cheap, he used secretly used public money to bribe journalists to write pro-war articles in the Italian newspapers while those foreign journalists who reported critically about the war were expelled from Italy. Italian newspapers that reported critically about the war with Ethiopia were heavily fined by the Crispi government with the offending editions of the papers being burned under the grounds that it was &quot;unpatriotic&quot; to criticize the government in wartime.

On 22 February 1896, Umberto dismissed General Baratieri as commander of the Italian expeditionary force, ordering him to remain in command until his successor arrived. On 25 February Crispi sent a telegram to Baratieri veiledly accusing him of cowardice and incompetence by engaging in small skirmishes and avoiding decisive battles (&quot;[yours] is not so much a war, but the military version of consumptive disease&quot;), and ended with demanding he took decisive action &quot;whatever the cost to save the honour of the army and the prestige of the monarchy&quot;. In response to Crispi&#x27;s telegram, on the evening of 29 February Baratieri met with his brigadier generals and with their support decided to ignore his own doubts and attacked a much larger Ethiopian force on 1 March 1896 near Adwa. In the Battle of Adwa the Ethiopian army dealt the heavily outnumbered Italians a decisive loss and forced their retreat back into Eritrea. General Baratieri took no responsibility for the defeat, blaming his men, saying they were cowards who had let him down at Adwa. By contrast, the British military observer stated the ordinary Italian soldiers at Adwa &quot;were as good as fighting material as can be found in Europe&quot;, but they had been let down by their officers who had shown no leadership abilities whatsoever.  

The casualty rate suffered by Italian forces at the Battle of Adwa was greater than any other major European battle of the 19th century, beyond even the Napoleonic Era&#x27;s Waterloo and Eylau. More Italians were killed in one day&#x27;s fighting at Adwa than in all the wars of the Risorgimento. Crispi announced after Adwa that he planned to continue the war against the &quot;barbarians&quot; of Ethiopia, and would be sending more troops to the Horn of Africa, which prompted a public backlash against the unpopular war. After the humiliating defeat of the Italian army, riots broke out in several Italian cities, and within two weeks, the Crispi government collapsed amidst Italian disenchantment with &quot;foreign adventures&quot;. In Rome, people demonstrated under the slogans &quot;death to the king!&quot; and &quot;long live the republic!&quot; as the war had badly damaged the prestige of Umberto who had backed Crispi so forcefully and strongly. Crispi was opposed to making peace with Ethiopia, saying he regarded it as humiliating for the Italians to make peace with &quot;barbarians&quot; as he called the Ethiopians and said he did not care about the lives of almost 3,000 Italians taken prisoner by the Ethiopians who were being held as hostages, saying they were &quot;expendable&quot; compared to the &quot;glorious&quot; national mission of conquering Ethiopia.

==Downfall and death==

The ensuing Antonio di Rudini cabinet lent itself to Cavallotti&#x27;s campaign, and at the end of 1897, the judicial authorities applied to the Chamber of Deputies for permission to prosecute Crispi for embezzlement. A parliamentary commission of inquiry discovered only that Crispi, on assuming office in 1893, had found the secret service coffers empty, and had borrowed money from a state bank to fund it, repaying it with the monthly instalments granted in regular course by the treasury. The commission, considering this proceeding irregular, proposed, and the Chamber adopted, a vote of censure, but refused to authorize a prosecution.

Crispi resigned his seat in parliament, but was re-elected by an overwhelming majority in April 1898 by his Palermo constituents. For some time he took little part in active politics, chiefly on account of his growing blindness. A successful operation for cataract restored his eyesight in June 1900, and notwithstanding his 81 years, he resumed to some extent his former political activity.

Soon afterwards, however, his health began to give way and he died in Naples on 11 August 1901; according to many witnesses, his last words were: &quot;Before closing my eyes to life, I would have the supreme comfort of knowing that our homeland is beloved and defended by all its sons&quot;.

==Legacy==
Crispi was a colourful and intensely patriotic character. He was a man of enormous energy but with a violent temper. His whole life, public and private, was turbulent, dramatic and marked by a succession of bitter personal hostilities. According to some Crispi&#x27;s &quot;fiery pride, almost insane touchiness and indifference to sound methods of government&quot; were due to his Albanian inheritance. Although he began life as a revolutionary and democratic figure, his premiership was authoritarian and he showed disdain for Italian liberals. He was born as a firebrand and died as a firefighter. At the end of the 19th century, Crispi was the dominant figure of Italian politics for a decade. He was saluted by Giuseppe Verdi as &#x27;the great patriot&#x27;. He was a more scrupulous statesman than Cavour, a more realistic conspirator than Mazzini, and a more astute figure than Garibaldi. His death resulted in lengthier obituaries in Europe&#x27;s press than for any Italian politician since Cavour.
As prime minister in the 1880s and 1890s, Crispi was internationally famous and often mentioned along with world statesmen such as Bismarck, Gladstone and Salisbury. Originally an enlightened Italian patriot and democratic liberal, he went on to become a bellicose authoritarian prime minister and ally and admirer of Bismarck. He is often seen as a precursor of Benito Mussolini. Mussolini portrayed the Liberal era (1861–1922) as a perversion of the idealist vision of Mazzini and Garibaldi, and Crispi was the lone prime minister of the Liberal era whom &quot;Il Duce&quot; depicted in favourable terms. In particular, Mussolini praised Crispi as the inventor of &quot;Italian imperialism&quot; as opposed to &quot;western imperialism&quot;, presenting his foreign policy as the inspiration for Fascist foreign policy, and the period after 1896 was excoriated as a period of decline caused by the alleged pusillanimous policy of Giolitti. Mussolini presented his foreign policies such as conquering Ethiopia to &quot;avenge Adawa&quot; and making an alliance with Nazi Germany as a continuation of Crispi&#x27;s foreign policy who likewise tried to conquer Ethiopia and made an alliance with the German Empire. His reputation was a victim of Italian Fascism, which awarded him an abundance of street names, most erased after 1945. With the collapse of Fascism, Crispi&#x27;s reputation was left fatally tarnished.

Historian R.J.B. Bosworth says that Crispi:
: pursued policies whose openly aggressive character would not be equaled until the days of the Fascist regime. Crispi increased military expenditure, talked cheerfully of a European conflagration, and alarmed his German or British friends with this suggestions of preventative attacks on his enemies. His policies were ruinous, both for Italy&#x27;s trade with France, and, more humiliatingly, for colonial ambitions in East Africa. Crispi&#x27;s lust for territory there was thwarted when on 1 March 1896, the armies of Ethiopian Emperor Menelik routed Italian forces at Adowa ... In what has been defined as an unparalleled disaster for a modern army. Crispi, whose private life (he was perhaps a trigamist) and personal finances...were objects of perennial scandal, went into dishonorable retirement.

<text>George Town (palawa kani: &quot;kinimathatakinta&quot;) is a large town in north-east Tasmania, on the eastern bank of the mouth of the Tamar River. The Australian Bureau of Statistics records the George Town Municipal Area had a population of 6,764 as of 30 June 2016.

It is the regional centre of the George Town Council local government area and is well served with a regional hospital, supermarkets, and infrastructure.

==History==

The George Town region has been inhabited by Aboriginal Tasmanians since, at least, 7000 BP and possibly as long ago as 43000 BP.

===European settlement===
Early observation of the Tamar River occurred in 1798 when Bass and Flinders sailed into the river during their circumnavigation of Tasmania. The estuarine river was named Port Dalrymple and the location that would become George Town was referred to as Outer Cove. 
William Collins, in January 1804, led an 18-day exploration of the river to determine the best site for a settlement.
In November 1804, Colonel William Paterson arrived with four ships with 181 people, convicts, soldiers, and one free settler and the settlement was established at Outer Cove. Subsequently the main settlement moved to the west arm of the river and then to the river head, some 50 km south, named Launceston. 
When, in 1811, Governor-In-Chief Lachlan Macquarie toured Tasmania he moved the settlement back to Outer Cove and named it George Town after King George III. The populace were reluctant to relocate and building the town in earnest did not begin until 1819. 
Because of the needs of maintaining a defensible position at the mouth of the river, regardless of the notional main settlement location, the George Town area has been continuously occupied since 1804, making it one of the earliest European settlements in Australia.

===Early communications===
1822 - George Town Post Office opened, Mr. W Brown is appointed postmaster on 11 October 1822

1825 - Tamar Valley semaphore system

1869 - Eastern Extension Telegraph Cable connects Tasmania to the Australian mainland

==Geography and landmarks==

*Mount George
*Tamar Valley Semaphore
*Low Head and Low Head Lighthouse
*Batman Bridge - Joining the George Town Municipality to the West Tamar
*kanamaluka/Tamar River

=== Climate ===
George Town has a mediterranean-influenced oceanic climate (Köppen: Cfb/Csb), with very mild, relatively dry summers and cool, wetter winters. Temperatures are moderated in all seasons by winds originating from the Bass Strait; mitigating temperature extremes. Average maxima vary from in February to in July while average minima fluctuate between in February and in July.
Mean average annual precipitation is moderate, spread between 133.4 precipitation days, and is concentrated in winter. In addition, the town is not very sunny, with 150.3 cloudy days and only 64.4 clear days per annum. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on 20 February 2000 to on 21 August 2013. Climate data was sourced from Low Head, located north of George Town.

==Infrastructure==

The Basslink 400 Kilovolt high-voltage direct current submarine cable connecting Tasmania to the National Electricity Market, terminates in George Town.

In 2007 Alinta built the Tamar Valley Power Station a 200 MW gas-fired power station in the vicinity of George Town creating 200 direct and 100 indirect jobs during construction, and generating electricity from 2009.

Nearby Bell Bay has an aluminium and manganese smelter, as well as the port.

George Town has 3 schools: 
* South George Town Primary School
* Star of the Sea College
* Port Dalrymple School

==Proposed developments==

===Bell Bay pulp mill===
Gunns Limited had proposed a pulp mill to be built in the area in 2006, however Gunns entered receivership in 2013, with large debt and the mill did not proceed as the company assets were sold.

===Mountain bike trail===
George Town Council is developing 80 km of purpose built mountain bike trails over two separate networks - one on the flanks of Mount George near the town centre and the second in the Tippogoree Hills, five-kilometres south of the township. The project is anticipated to be completed by December 2021.

==Attractions==

<text>The Holy of Holies ( or &quot;Kodesh HaKodashim&quot;; also &quot;hadDəḇīr&quot;, &#x27;the Sanctuary&#x27;) is a term in the Hebrew Bible that refers to the inner sanctuary of the Tabernacle, where the Shekhinah (God&#x27;s presence) appeared. According to Hebrew tradition, the area was defined by four pillars that held up the veil of the covering, under which the Ark of the Covenant was held above the floor. According to the Hebrew Bible, the Ark contained the Ten Commandments, which were given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai. The first Temple in Jerusalem, called Solomon&#x27;s Temple, was said to have been built by King Solomon to keep the Ark.

Ancient Jewish traditions viewed the Holy of Holies as the spiritual junction of Heaven and Earth, the &quot;axis mundi&quot;.

As a part of the Jewish Temple in Jerusalem, the Holy of Holies was situated somewhere on Temple Mount; its precise location in the Mount being a matter of dispute, with some classical Jewish sources identifying its location with the Foundation Stone, which sits under the Dome of the Rock shrine. Other Jewish scholars argue that contemporary reports would place the Temple to the north or to the east of the Dome of the Rock.

The Christian Crusaders associated the Holy of Holies with the Well of Souls, a small cave that lies underneath the Foundation Stone in the Dome of the Rock.

==Hebrew terminology and translation==

The construction &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; is a translation of the Hebrew, which is intended to express a superlative. Examples of similar constructions are &quot;servant of servants&quot; (Gen 9:25), &quot;Sabbath of sabbaths&quot; (Ex 31:15), &quot;God of gods&quot; (Deut 10:17), &quot;Vanity of vanities&quot; (Eccl 1:2), &quot;Song of songs&quot; (Song of Songs 1:1), &quot;king of kings&quot; (Ezra 7:12), etc.

In the Authorized King James Version, &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; is always translated as &quot;Most Holy Place&quot;. This is in keeping with the intention of the Hebrew idiom to express the utmost degree of holiness. Thus, the name &quot;Most Holy Place&quot; was used to refer to the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; in many English documents.

A related term is &quot;debir&quot;, transliterated in the Septuagint (), which either means the back (i.e. western) part of the Sanctuary, or derives from the verb stem ד־ב־ר &quot;to speak&quot;, justifying the translation in the Vulgate as &quot;oraculum&quot;, which the traditional English translation &quot;oracle&quot; (KJV, 1611) derives from.

==Ancient Israel==

===Tabernacle===

According to the Hebrew Bible, in order that God may dwell among the Israelites, God gave Moses instructions for erecting a sanctuary. The directions provide for:
# A wooden ark, gilded inside and outside, for the Tablets of the Covenant, with a pure gold cover as the &quot;mercy seat&quot; for the Divine Presence;
# A gilt table for the &quot;Table of Showbread&quot;, on which loaves of bread were arranged;
# A golden menorah, lampstand of 7 oil lamps for a light never to be extinguished;
# The dwelling, including the curtains for the roof, the walls made of boards resting on silver feet and held together by wooden bolts, the multi-colored curtain veiling the Holy of Holies (of blue, purple, crimson, white and gold), the table and candlestick, and the outer curtain;
# A sacrificial altar made of bronzed boards for its &quot;korban&quot;/sacrifice;
# The outer court formed by pillars resting on bronze pedestals and connected by hooks and crossbars of silver, with embroidered curtains;
# Recipe and preparation of the oil for the Lampstand.

According to the Bible, the Holy of Holies was covered by a veil, and no one was allowed to enter except the High Priest, and even he would only enter once a year on Yom Kippur, to offer the blood of sacrifice and incense. The Bible reports that in the wilderness, on the day that the tabernacle was first raised up, the cloud of the Lord covered the tabernacle (). There are other times that this was recorded, and instructions were given that the Lord would appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat (&quot;kapporet&quot;), and at that time the priests should not enter into the tabernacle (Leviticus 16:2). According to the Hebrew Bible, the Holy of Holies contained the Ark of the Covenant with representation of Cherubim.

Upon completion of the dedication of the Tabernacle, the Voice of God spoke to Moses &quot;from between the Cherubim&quot; ().

===Solomon&#x27;s Temple===
The Holy of Holies was the inner sanctuary within the Tabernacle and Temple in Jerusalem when Solomon&#x27;s Temple and the Second Temple were standing. The parochet, a brocade curtain with cherubim motifs woven directly into the fabric from the loom, divided the Holy of Holies from the lesser Holy place.

The Holy of Holies was located at the westernmost end of the Temple building and was a cube: 20 cubits by 20 cubits by 20 cubits. The inside was in darkness and contained the Ark of the Covenant, gilded inside and out, in which was placed the Tablets of Stone. According to both Jewish and Christian traditions, Aaron&#x27;s rod and a pot of manna were also in the ark. The Ark was covered with a lid made of pure gold, known as the &quot;mercy seat&quot; (), which was covered by the beaten gold cherubim wings, creating the space for the Shekhinah ().

===Second Temple===

When the Temple was rebuilt after the Babylonian captivity, the Ark was no longer present in the Holy of Holies; instead, a portion of the floor was raised slightly to indicate the place where it had stood. In Jewish tradition, two curtains separated the Holy of Holies from the lesser Holy place during the period of the Second Temple. These curtains were woven with motifs directly from the loom, rather than embroidered, and each curtain had the thickness of a handbreadth (ca. 9 cm.; 3½&quot;). Josephus records that Pompey profaned the Temple by insisting on entering the Holy of Holies in 63 BCE. When Titus captured the city during the First Jewish–Roman War, Roman soldiers took down the curtain and used it to wrap therein golden vessels retrieved from the Temple.

===Yom Kippur===

The Holy of Holies was entered once a year by the High Priest on Yom Kippur, to sprinkle the blood of sacrificial animals (a bull offered as atonement for the Priest and his household, and a goat offered as atonement for the people (this is where the term scapegoat originates from)) and offer incense upon the Ark of the Covenant and the mercy seat that sat on top of the ark in the First Temple (the Second Temple had no ark and the blood was sprinkled where the Ark would have been and the incense was put on the Brazen Altar of incense). The animal was sacrificed and the blood was carried into the most holy place. The gold was also found in the Most Holy Place.

==In ancient Judaism==
The Magdala stone is thought to be a representation of the Holy of Holies carved before the destruction of the Temple in the year 70.

==In Rabbinical Judaism==
Traditional Judaism regards the location where the inner sanctuary was originally located, on the Temple Mount (Mount Moriah), as retaining some or all of its original sanctity for use in a future Third Temple. The exact location of the Holy of Holies is a subject of dispute.
Traditional Judaism regards the Holy of Holies as the place where the presence of God dwells. The Talmud gives detailed descriptions of Temple architecture and layout. According to the Babylonian Talmud Tractate Yoma, the &quot;Kodesh Hakodashim&quot; (Holy of Holies) is located in the center of the esplanade from a North–South perspective, but significantly to the West from an East–West perspective, with all the major courtyards and functional areas lying to its east.

The Talmud supplies additional details, and describes the ritual performed by the High Priest. During the annual ritual, the High Priest would pronounce the Tetragrammaton, the only point that it was pronounced out loud. According to Jewish tradition, the people prostrated themselves fully on the ground when it was said. According to the Talmud, the High Priest&#x27;s face upon exit from the Holy of Holies was radiant.

While under normal circumstances, access to the Holy of Holies was restricted to the High Priest and only on Yom Kippur, the Talmud suggests that repair crews were allowed inside as needed but were lowered from the upper portion of the room via enclosures so that they only saw the area they were to work on.

===Synagogue architecture===
Judaism regards the Torah ark, a place in a synagogue where the Torah scrolls are kept, as a miniature Holy of Holies.

== Modern location ==
The exact location of the Holy of Holies is a contentious issue, as elements of questioning the exact placement of the Temple are often associated with Temple denial. There are three main theories as to where exactly the Temple stood on the Mount: where the Dome of the Rock is now located; to the north of the Dome of the Rock (Professor Asher Kaufman); or to the east of the Dome of the Rock (Professor Joseph Patrich of the Hebrew University). 

The location of the Holy of Holies is connected to the location of the Jewish Temple. The location of the Temple, however, had become uncertain already less than 150 years after the Second Temple&#x27;s destruction, as detailed in the Talmud. Chapter 54 of the Tractate Berakhot states that the Holy of Holies was directly aligned with the Golden Gate, which, assuming the current gate follows the same course as the now buried Herodian gate, would have placed the Holy of Holies slightly to the north of the Dome of the Rock, as Kaufman postulated. Chapter 54 of the Tractate Yoma and chapter 26 of the Tractate Sanhedrin, on the other hand, assert that the Holy of Holies stood directly on the Foundation Stone.

The Crusaders associated the Holy of Holies with the Well of Souls, which is located under the Foundation Stone of the Dome of the Rock. Most Orthodox Jews today completely avoid climbing up to Temple Mount, to prevent them from accidentally stepping on any holy areas. A few Orthodox Jewish authorities, following the opinion of the medieval scholar Maimonides, permit Jews to visit parts of the Temple Mount known not to be anywhere near any of the sanctified areas. Orthodox Jewish visitors to the Temple Mount, who come especially from those groups associated with the Temple Institute and its efforts to rebuild a Temple, seek to conform to the minimal requirements for coming near the Temple, such as immersing in a mikvah (&quot;collection of water&quot;; a ritual of purification), not coming during or following menstruation or immediately following a seminal emission, not showing their back towards its presumed location, etc.

To avoid religious conflict, Jewish visitors caught praying or bringing ritual objects are usually expelled from the area by police.

==In apocryphal literature==

According to the ancient apocryphal &quot;Lives of the Prophets&quot;, after the death of Zechariah ben Jehoiada, the priests of the Temple could no more, as before, see the apparitions of the angels of the Lord, nor could make divinations with the Ephod, nor give responses from the &quot;Debir&quot;.

==Christianity==

===New Testament===
The Greek New Testament retains the pre-Christian Septuagint phrase &quot;Holy of the Holies&quot; &quot;hágion &quot;(sg n)&quot; tōn hagíōn&quot; () without the definite article as &quot;Holies of Holies&quot; &quot;hágia &quot;(pl n)&quot; hagíōn&quot; () in Hebrews 9:3. In the Vulgate of Saint Jerome, these are rendered as &quot;sanctum sanctorum&quot; and &quot;sancta sanctorum&quot;, respectively. The Greek language was the common language upon Hellenization of much of the Middle East after the death of Alexander the Great, and the division of his empire among four generals. The Jews of the Diaspora spoke it; the Vulgate was a faithful translation for Christian Rome.

===Christian traditions===
Certain branches of Christianity, including the Eastern Orthodox Church, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church continue to have a tradition of a Holy of Holies that they regard as a most sacred site. The ciborium, a permanent canopy over the altar in some churches, once surrounded by curtains at points in the liturgy, symbolizes the Holy of Holies. Some Christian churches, particularly the Catholic Church, consider the Church tabernacle, or its location (often at the rear of the sanctuary), as the symbolic equivalent of the Holy of Holies, due to the storage of consecrated hosts in that vessel.

====Catholic Church====

The Latin Vulgate Bible translates &quot;Qṓḏeš HaqQŏḏāšîm&quot; as Sanctum sanctorum (Ex 26:34). Reproducing in Latin the Hebrew construction, the expression is used as a superlative of the neuter adjective &quot;sanctum&quot;, to mean &quot;a thing most holy&quot;. It is used by Roman Catholics to refer to the Eucharist in the tabernacle which represents the presence of Christ.

The Vulgate also refers to the Holy of Holies with the plural form &quot;Sancta sanctorum&quot; (2 Chr 5:7), possibly a synecdoche referring to the holy objects hosted there. This form is also used more broadly in Catholic tradition with reference to sanctuaries other than the Temple in Jerusalem. A notable example is for the Chiesa di San Lorenzo in Palatio ad Sancta Sanctorum, a chapel in the complex of St John Lateran in Rome.

====Eastern Orthodox Church====

The Greek phrase refers to the Tabernacle or Temple. The name in Greek for the sanctuary of a church is (&quot;Hieron Vema&quot;, see Bema#Christianity), in Russian it is called Святой Алтарь (&quot;Svyatoy Altar&quot; – literally: &quot;Holy Altar&quot;), and in Romanian it is called &quot;Sfântul Altar&quot;.

====Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church====
A cognate term in Ge&#x27;ez is found in the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church: &quot;Qidduse Qiddusan&quot; (or &quot;Bete Mekdes&quot;), referring to the innermost sanctuary of an Orthodox Christian church, where the &quot;tabot&quot; is kept and only clergy may enter. Every Ethiopian Orthodox church has one, and it is covered with a curtain. There are often three entry points, symbolising the Holy Trinity. In the middle, there is always an altar where the church&#x27;s &quot;tabot&quot; is kept. There can be as many altars as the number of &quot;tabots.&quot;

====Malabar Nasrani tradition====
The Saint Thomas Christians (also known as Nasrani or Syrian Christians) from Kerala, South India still follow much Jewish Christian tradition. In Nasrani tradition the Holy of Holies is kept veiled for much of the time. The red veil covers the inner altar or the main altar. It is unveiled only during the central part of the main Nasrani ritual. The main ritual of the Saint Thomas Christians is the Qurbana.

====The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints====
The Salt Lake Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) contains a Holy of Holies wherein the church&#x27;s president—acting as the Presiding High Priest—enters to fulfill the relationship between the High Priest of Israel and God in accordance with the LDS Church&#x27;s interpretation of the Book of Exodus () and Latter-day Saint religious texts.

==== Seventh-Day Adventist Church ====
Seventh-Day Adventism (SDA) believes that the Holy of Holies on Earth was a copy of the true tabernacle in heaven, and this view can also be seen in other Christian denominations. Because in Hebrews, God commands Moses to make sure that all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the Mount Sinai (Heb 8:2, 5). After the &quot;Great Disappointment&quot;, preacher O. R. L. Crosier, Hiram Edson, and F. B. Hahn published new insights into Christ&#x27;s sanctuary ministry that Jesus began to minister in the heavenly sanctuary after His ascension (Heb 9:24). Seventh-Day Adventism (SDA) believes that just as the high priest completed the special ministry on Yom Kippur and blessed the Israelites. Christ will come and bless his people after cleaning the Holy of Holies in heaven (Heb 9:23).

<doc id="684762" wikidata="Q2392210" url="?curid=684762" title="POST card">
<text>In computing, a POST card is a plug-in diagnostic interface card that displays progress and error codes generated during power-on self-test (POST) of a computer. It is used to troubleshoot computers that do not start up.

==Working principle==
At a minimum, if the CPU, BIOS, and the I/O interface upon which the POST card relies on are all working, a POST card can be used to monitor the system&#x27;s Power-On Self Test (POST), or to diagnose problems with it. The system introduced on IBM PC computers sends 8-bit byte codes (usually displayed as two hexadecimal digits) to a specified I/O port (usually 80 hex) during startup, some indicating a stage in the startup procedure, others identifying errors. The description for each code must be looked up in a table for the particular BIOS. For example, for the 1984 IBM PC/AT code 1D is issued when about to &quot;Determine Memory Size Above 1024K&quot;, and code 2D in the event of &quot;8042 Keyboard Controller Failure, 105 System Error&quot;. If startup does not complete successfully, either an error code, or the code of the last operation performed, is available.

POST cards provide information even when a standard display is not available, either because connecting a monitor is impractical, or because the failure occurs before the video subsystem is operational.

==Operation==
POST cards are inserted into an expansion slot, and are available with connectors for the ISA (also supporting EISA), PCI, PCI Express, Mini PCIe (for laptops), Universal Serial Bus, or Low Pin Count bus, or for a parallel port. A typical card for desktop computers has a different bus interface on each edge; a card for laptop computers may have both a miniPCI and a parallel port connector (plus USB to supply power).

Modern motherboards often do not broadcast POST codes to their PCI Express slots (PCIe switches only pass on transactions after having been configured to do so by the BIOS). On such motherboards, the Low Pin Count (LPC) bus, an ISA variant normally used to connect a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), may be the only bus where POST messages can still be seen. However LPC connectors are not standardized, with between 9 and 19 pins and both 2.54 mm and 2 mm pin headers commonly used. Therefore, an LPC POST card may have to auto-detect first the pin assignment used.

Another option are USB POST cards such as AMI Debug Rx, which use the debug port common on USB 2.0 EHCI controllers.

Information on the meaning of POST codes for different BIOSes is needed to interpret the codes. This may be supplied with cards, but becomes dated as later BIOSes are issued; more up-to-date information may be available on manufacturers&#x27; and independent websites.

In addition to displaying numeric codes, many cards monitor power supply voltages, clock and oscillator signals, reset signal, and other parameters.

==Usage scenarios==
Diagnostic cards are today mainly used by designers of motherboards and extension cards, along with logic analyzers and other debug tools and interfaces. They are less commonly used in the 21st century for computer repair and by system integrators, but remain available. POST cards for PCs, while originally high-priced, cost from just a few US dollars upwards in the 21st century.

Some motherboards have a built-in display to diagnose hardware problems. Most also report POST errors with audible beeps, if a PC speaker is attached. Such motherboards make POST cards less necessary.

When these diagnostic cards were first introduced motherboards were expensive and well worth troubleshooting and repairing. By the late twentieth century large scale integration, mass production made motherboards inexpensive components. Motherboards were rarely repaired, but replaced; the main purpose of a POST card is to determine that parts mounted on the motherboard itself, rather than plugged-in video cards, RAM, etc. are at fault.

<doc id="684766" wikidata="Q1392959" url="?curid=684766" title="Tony Knowles (snooker player)">
<text>Anthony Knowles (born 13 June 1955) is an English former professional snooker player. He won the 1982 International Open and the 1983 Professional Players Tournament, and was a three times semi-finalist in the World Professional Snooker Championship in the 1980s. His highest world ranking was second, in the 1984/85 season.

Knowles was the British under-19 snooker champion in 1972 and 1974. He turned professional in 1980, and surprisingly defeated the defending champion Steve Davis 10–1 in the first round of the 1982 World Snooker Championship. In 1984, tabloid stories about his personal life were published, and he was fined £5,000 by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association for bringing the game into disrepute. His other tournament victories included the 1984 Australian Masters and, as part of the England team with Davis and Tony Meo, the 1983 World Team Classic.

==Career==
Tony Knowles was born in Bolton on 13 June 1955. He began playing snooker at the age of 9 on the tables at the Tonge Moor Conservative Club, which was run by his father, Kevin. He went on to win the UK Junior Championship twice, in 1972 (against Matt Gibson) and in 1974. His application to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) to become a professional player was accepted in 1980, after a rejection in November 1979. He did not win a match in his first year, before progressing through two qualifying rounds to reach the first round of the 1981 World Snooker Championship where he lost 8–10 to Graham Miles. He reached the quarter-finals of the 1981 UK Championship by eliminating Geoff Foulds, Fred Davis and Doug Mountjoy from the competition before being defeated 5–9 by Terry Griffiths. Later that season, Knowles gained attention when he won 10–1 against defending champion Steve Davis in the first round of the 1982 World Snooker Championship, after staying out late at a nightclub following the first day&#x27;s play when he had built an 8–1 lead. He defeated Miles 13–7 in the second round, before losing 11–13 to Eddie Charlton in the quarter-finals.

In the 1982–83 snooker season, he followed up his performance in the World Championship by winning the 1982 International Open with a 9–6 victory against David Taylor. He had eliminated Eddie Sinclair 5–2 in the first round, Ray Reardon by the same score in round two, Cliff Wilson 5–4 in the quarter-finals, and Kirk Stevens 9–3 in the semi-finals. In the final, he led Taylor 5–3 after the first , after the pair had been level at 2–2. He compiled a of 114, the highest of the tournament, to win the ninth frame, before Taylor claimed the next two frames to leave Knowles one ahead at 6–5. Breaks of 63 and 43 in the next two frames saw Knowles restore a three-frame advantage. Taylor made a break of 74 to win the 14th frame, but Knowles secured his first major title by claiming the 15th frame with a break of 76. It was the first tournament apart from the World Snooker Championship to count in the snooker world rankings.

He won only one match in four tournaments between the 1982 International Open and the 1983 World Snooker Championship. At the World Championship, he progressed to the semi-finals by defeating Miles, Reardon (the second seed), and Tony Meo. In the semi-final he led Cliff Thorburn 15–13 before losing 15–16 in the after Thorburn the final and went on to take the frame. He moved to fourth place in the 1983/1984 world rankings.

The next season, he defeated Meo and Thorburn to reach the final of the 1983 Scottish Masters, which he lost 6–9 to Davis. Having failed to successfully defend the International Open title, losing 4–5 to John Spencer in the second round, Knowles started the 1983 Professional Players Tournament with a 5–1 win against Paul Medati and a 5–4 defeat of Rex Williams, then a 5–0 whitewash of Silvino Francisco. The same day as his match against Francisco, Knowles won 5–3 against John Campbell in the quarter-finals, after losing the opening two frames. In the semi-final, Knowles and Willie Thorne were level at 4–4 after the first session, with Knowles going on to prevail 9–7. In the final, he faced Joe Johnson and established a 6–1 lead, which Johnson reduced slightly to 6–2 by winning the last frame of the first session with the tournament&#x27;s highest break, 135. Johnson was two frames behind at 4–6 and 5–7, but Knowles went three frames up with four to play at 8–5. Johnson won three successive frames to equalise at 8–8. In the deciding frame, Knowles won on the final to take the title.

Just before the 1984 World Snooker Championship, Knowles appeared in a series of three articles in tabloid newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot;, in which he boasted of his sexual adventures, describing himself as &quot;the hottest pot in snooker&quot; and was dismissive of most other competitors in the tournament. He received £25,000 from the newspaper for the articles, and was subsequently fined £5,000 by the WPBSA for bringing the game into disrepute. He lost 7–10 to John Parrott in the first round.

At the start of the 1984–85 snooker season, he won the 1984 Australian Masters by defeating John Virgo 7–3 in the final, and was the runner-up, 7–9 to Jimmy White, at the 1984 Carlsberg Challenge. He was the losing finalist to Davis, by a margin of 2–9, at both the 1984 International Open and the 1985 English Professional Championship. He reached the 1985 World Snooker Championship semi-final where he was eliminated 5–16 by Dennis Taylor.

He reached two ranking tournament semi-finals, in the 1985–86 snooker season, at the Grand Prix and the World Championship, and the semi-finals of the Masters, but an inconsistent season included losses to lower-ranked players such as Williams, Jim Wych, and Patsy Fagan. The following year, he dropped from fourth to tenth in the rankings, with a semi-final place at the 1987 British Open the furthest he reached in a ranking tournament in a season that included a 6–10 first round defeat by Mike Hallett at the 1987 World Snooker Championship.

He was ranked 21st for the 1990/1991 season, the first time he had not been in the top sixteen since 1982/1983 after a season where he only reached one quarter-final, at the 1989 Grand Prix. At the 1991 Dubai Classic, he defeated Gary Natale 5–1 in the qualifying competition, then Eugene Hughes 5–2, and Neal Foulds 5–0. A 5–2 win against Dennis Taylor in the quarter-final saw Knowles reach his first ranking semi-final since the 1988 Classic. He then gained his first ranking final place since the 1984 International Open by eliminating Steve James 6–2. in the semi-final. Facing reigning world champion Parrott in the final, Knowles fell 0–3 behind, but won three of the next four frames to trail 3–4 at the end of the first session. Parrott then won five consecutive frames in the next session to claim victory at 9–3.

For the 1997–98 snooker season, only the top 64 players in the rankings at the end of the previous season retained full professional status. Those who finished from 65th to 192nd, including Knowles who was 72nd, played in a new WPBSA Qualifying School series which allowed qualifiers to regain full professional status. Knowles, however, lost his first match at each of the four Qualifying School events, and so was eligible to enter only the World Championship, the Benson and Hedges Championship, and the new &quot;UK Tour&quot; events during the season. He finished tenth in the UK Tour standings, which meant he regained his full professional status for 1998–99 snooker season, losing it again at the end of 2000–01. He continued to play on the Challenge Tour and in World Championship qualifying.

In 2009, Knowles won the inaugural Snooker Super 6s tournament, which played as one-frame matches, with six red balls, rather than the usual fifteen reds, at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. He defeated Neal Foulds in the semi-final, and 13-year-old Ross Muir in the final.

He has entered competitions including World Championship qualifying, Players Tour Championship and Q School in the 21st century. In 2021, he announced that he would enter Q School in an attempt to regain his professional snooker status. He failed to regain his professional status, but reached the last 32 of event 3 of the 2021 Q School, where he lost 2–4 to Mark Lloyd.

During his professional career, Knowles reached the World Championship semi-finals on three occasions (in 1983, 1985 and 1986), but never the final. His highest ranking was second, in 1984/1985, and his highest tournament break was 139. As one of three members of the England Team alongside Davis and Meo, he was a winner of the 1983 World Team Classic, and was runner-up at the 1982 World Team Classic and 1985 World Cup. He partnered White at the 1983 World Doubles Championship, where they were the losing finalists to Davis and Meo. He was a director of the WPBSA in the early-to-mid-2000s. He manages a wine bar in the Lake District. The club in the comedy programme &quot;Phoenix Nights&quot; had a room named the &quot;Tony Knowles Suite&quot; after him.
