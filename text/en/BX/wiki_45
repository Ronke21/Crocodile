<text>Pilsner Urquell (; ) is a lager beer brewed at Asahi Breweries&#x27; Pilsner Urquell Brewery in Plzeň (German name: Pilsen), Czech Republic. Pilsner Urquell was the world&#x27;s first pale lager, and its popularity meant it was much copied, and named &quot;pils&quot;, &quot;pilsner&quot; or &quot;pilsener&quot;. It is hopped with Saaz hops, a noble hop variety that is a key element in its flavour profile, as is the use of soft water. 

Almost all draught Pilsner Urquell is sold filtered, but small quantities are available in limited amounts unfiltered. The majority of the beer is sold in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany and South Korea, it is also sold in China, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada, United States, Sweden, Hungary and Austria. In recent years, the unpasteurized &quot;tank&quot; version of the beer has become increasingly available.
It is available in 330 ml, 355 ml and 500 ml aluminium cans and green or brown bottles.

The brewery was part of the SABMiller group of companies from 1999 to 2017. As part of agreements with regulators before Anheuser-Busch InBev was allowed to acquire SABMiller in 2016, Pilsner Urquell was sold to Japan-based Asahi Breweries in 2017.

== History ==
Pilsner Urquell was the first pale lager, and the name &quot;pilsner&quot; is often used by its copies. It is characterised by its golden colour and clarity, and was immensely successful: nine out of ten beers produced and consumed in the world are pale lagers based on Pilsner Urquell. The German name, which means &#x27;original source&#x27;, was adopted as a trademark in 1898.

By 1839, most beer in Bohemia was dark and top fermented. Nonetheless, bottom-fermented lagers were gaining popularity. The people of Plzeň preferred imported cheaper bottom-fermented beers to local top fermented ales. The burghers of Plzeň invested in a new, state-of-the art brewery, the &quot;Měšťanský pivovar&quot; (Burghers&#x27; Brewery), and hired Josef Groll, a Bavarian brewer, to brew a bottom-fermented beer. On 5 October 1842, Groll had a new mash ready and on 11 November 1842, the new beer was first served at the feast of St. Martin markets.

The brewery registered &quot;Pilsner Bier B. B.&quot; name in 1859. In 1898, they also registered names &quot;Original Pilsner Bier 1842&quot;, &quot;Plzeňský pramen&quot;, &quot;Prapramen&quot;, &quot;Měšťanské Plzeňské&quot;, &quot;Plzeňský pravý zdroj&quot; and finally &quot;Pilsner Urquell&quot; and &quot;Plzeňský Prazdroj&quot;, which are in use today.

Pilsner Urquell is today brewed solely in the Pilsen brewery. It was brewed between 2002 and 2011 in Tychy, Poland and between 2004 and 2017 in Kaluga, Russia.

<doc id="672124" wikidata="Q686085" url="?curid=672124" title="Sheik Yerbouti">
<text>Sheik Yerbouti is a double album by American musician Frank Zappa, released in March 1979 as the first release on Zappa Records, distributed by Phonogram Inc. in the United States and Canada. The album was released in other countries by CBS Records. It is mostly made up of live material recorded in 1977 and 1978, with extensive overdubs added in the studio. In an October 1978 interview, Zappa gave the working album title as &quot;Martian Love Secrets.&quot; It was later released on a single CD. 

&quot;Sheik Yerbouti&quot; is Zappa&#x27;s biggest selling album with over 2 million units sold worldwide.

== Inspiration ==
Zappa appears on the cover in character in Arab headdress. The title is a play on words and is pronounced like the 1976 disco hit &quot;Shake Your Booty&quot; by KC and the Sunshine Band.

The album has some of Zappa&#x27;s most satirical and controversial lyrics. &quot;Bobby Brown&quot; was banned from US airplay due to its sexually explicit lyrics. &quot;I Have Been in You&quot; pokes fun at Peter Frampton&#x27;s 1977 hit &quot;I&#x27;m in You&quot; while emphasizing an explicit meaning. &quot;Dancin&#x27; Fool&quot;, a Grammy nominee, became a popular disco hit despite its obvious parodical reflection of disco music. &quot;Flakes&quot;, about lazy union workers in California, includes a parody of Bob Dylan. &quot;Jewish Princess&quot;, a humorous look at Jewish stereotyping, attracted attention from the Anti-Defamation League, to which Zappa denied an apology, arguing: &quot;Unlike the unicorn, such creatures do exist—and deserve to be &#x27;commemorated&#x27; with their own special opus&quot;.

&quot;Rat Tomago&quot; was edited from a live performance of &quot;The Torture Never Stops&quot;, which originally appeared on &quot;Zoot Allures&quot; (1976); likewise, &quot;The Sheik Yerbouti Tango&quot; is taken from a live version of &quot;Little House I Used to Live in&quot;, originally recorded for &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwich&quot; in 1970. 

Some of the songs also appeared in &quot;Baby Snakes&quot;, Zappa&#x27;s 1979 concert film. A clip of &quot;City of Tiny Lites&quot; with clay animation by Bruce Bickford was shown on the Old Grey Whistle Test.

== Writing and recording ==
Some songs, such as &quot;Rat Tomago&quot;, are linked by brief pieces of musique concrète, and studio dialog from Zappa band members Terry Bozzio and Patrick O&#x27;Hearn. In making &quot;Rubber Shirt&quot;, Zappa combined a track of Terry playing drums in one musical setting with one of Patrick playing the bass in another. The original performances differed in time signature and in tempo. Zappa described this technique as xenochrony. 

The album was engineered by Joe Chiccarelli. He later explained: &quot;[Zappa&#x27;s] engineer couldn’t make the session and so he decided to take a chance on me. I’m so thankful ever since that day because he gave me a career.&quot;

== Critical reception ==

Initially, the album was met with mixed reviews, due to the lyrical content. Despite this, the album remains a cult favorite among Zappa fans to this day. The song &quot;Bobby Brown&quot; was extremely popular in Scandinavia. Zappa was reportedly so astounded by its success that he wanted CBS to hire an anthropologist to study why the song became such a big hit.

Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;If this be social &#x27;satire,&#x27; how come its sole targets are ordinary citizens whose weirdnesses happen to diverge from those of the retentive gent at the control board? Or are we to read his new fixation on buggery as an indication of approval? Makes you wonder whether his primo guitar solo on &#x27;Yo&#x27; Mama&#x27; and those as-unique-as-they-used-to-be rhythms and textures are as arid spiritually as he is. As if there were any question after all these years.&quot;

<doc id="672127" wikidata="Q3585454" url="?curid=672127" title="Church of St Mary the Great, Cambridge">
<text>St Mary the Great is a Church of England parish and university church at the north end of King&#x27;s Parade in central Cambridge, England. It is known locally as Great St Mary&#x27;s or simply GSM to distinguish it from &quot;Little St Mary&#x27;s&quot;. It is one of the Greater Churches. It is designated by Historic England as a Grade I listed building.

In addition to being a parish church in the Diocese of Ely, it is the university church for the University of Cambridge. As such it has a role in the university&#x27;s legislation. For example, university officers must live within 20 miles of Great St Mary&#x27;s and undergraduates within three. The church also hosts the &quot;University Sermons&quot; and houses the University Organ and the University Clock. The latter chimes the &quot;Cambridge Quarters&quot; which were later used by the clock tower of the Houses of Parliament (&quot;Big Ben&quot;).

==History==

The first mention of the church is a record of King John presenting Thomas de Chimeleye to the rectory in 1205. The foundations of the church may date to 1010, but the church was mostly destroyed by fire 9 July 1290 and then rebuilt. At the time, this fire was attributed to the Jewish population of the city, with the result that the synagogue was closed. Prior to 1352, it was known as The Church of St Mary the Virgin, but since that year has become known by its modern name. During its early years, the patronage of the church (that is, the right to name the incumbent) belonged to the crown, but on 15 July 1342, the patronage was passed to King&#x27;s Hall. When King&#x27;s Hall was subsumed by Henry VIII into Trinity College the patronage of the University Church also passed to Trinity, where it has rested since.

The orders for the consecration of the new church were sent out on 17 May 1346, but were not enacted until 15 March 1351.

During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt and associated sacking of the university by townspeople in 1381, the church was entered and bulls, charters and title deeds of the university were destroyed.

In the Middle Ages it became an official gathering place for meetings and debates for Cambridge University, but this ceased in 1730 when the University&#x27;s Senate House was built across the street.

The present building was constructed between 1478 and 1519, with the tower finished later, in 1608. The cost of construction was covered largely by Richard III and Henry VII.

The church was restored by James Essex in 1766. In 1850–51 a restoration was carried out by George Gilbert Scott, followed by further work by Anthony Salvin in 1857. The south porch was rebuilt in 1888. There has been some more restoration work during the 20th century.

Various leading philosophers of the English Reformation preached there, notably Erasmus. Martin Bucer, who influenced Thomas Cranmer&#x27;s writing of the Book of Common Prayer, was buried there. Under Queen Mary I, Bucer&#x27;s corpse was burnt in the marketplace, but under Elizabeth I, the dust from the place of burning was replaced in the church and now lie under a brass floor plate in the south chancel.

===Present day===
Great St Mary&#x27;s stands in the Liberal Catholic tradition of the Church of England. It is a member of Inclusive Church.

==Bells==

Originally, bells were hung in a wooden structure in the churchyard. In 1515 the bells were moved to the tower and the structure was dismantled. The bells were replaced in 1722 and in 1724, the Society of Cambridge Youths was formed to formalise the responsibility for ringing them. This society lays claim to being the oldest bellringing society in Britain and the second oldest at any church in the world with a continuous ringing history.

In 2009 the old ring of bells was replaced with a new ring cast by Taylors Eayre and Smith Ltd, made possible by a donation from Dr Martin C Faulkes. The new ring of 13 bells in the key of D (including a flat bell no. 6 providing a lighter ring of 8 bells in the key of G) has a tenor weighing 24cwt. Some of the original bells have been retained to continue sounding the Cambridge Chimes.

==Organs==
St Mary the Great is unusual in housing two self-contained pipe organs, a &#x27;Parish Organ&#x27; in the Chancel for the regular congregation, and another in the West Gallery, called the &#x27;University Organ&#x27;, owned and maintained by the University, and played for University services. The University Organ was originally purchased in 1698, constructed by the renowned organ builder &#x27;Father&#x27; Bernard Smith. It was added to over the 18th and 19th centuries until a major (yet sensitive) rebuild was carried out by William Hill in 1870. The organ saw further work in 1963 from Hill, Norman and Beard (again remarkably sensitive for the time) and was extensively restored in 1995 by Mander Organs, and rededicated on 30 January 1996. It is a noted historic instrument, a significant monument to the work of William Hill, and, in addition, likely the largest repository of Father Smith pipework in a single instrument. The Parish Organ was built in 1991 by Kenneth Jones and Associates. It replaced an earlier instrument by Miller of Cambridge (one time organist of Great St Mary&#x27;s) dating from 1869.

==Architecture and features==
The church is designed in the Late Perpendicular style. The stained glass is the work of Hardman and was added between 1867 and 1869.

To accommodate the large audiences that were present for special occasions, and in particular the University Sermon, attendance of which was compulsory, the galleries were added in 1735. The church contains one of the few moveable pulpits in England. The font dates from 1632 and the sculpture behind the high altar is of Christ in Majesty. This sculpture was completed in 1960.
The sculpture is by Alan Durst

<text>In Canada, taxation is a prerogative shared between the federal government and the various provincial and territorial legislatures.

==Legislation==

Under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, taxation powers are vested in the Parliament of Canada under s. 91(3) for:

The provincial legislatures have a more restricted authority under ss. 92(2) and 92(9) for:

In turn, the provincial legislatures have authorized municipal councils to levy specific types of direct tax, such as property tax.

The powers of taxation are circumscribed by ss. 53 and 54 (both extended to the provinces by s. 90), and 125, which state:

==Nature of the taxation power in Canada==

Since the 1930 Supreme Court of Canada ruling in &quot;Lawson v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetables Committee of Direction&quot;, taxation is held to consist of the following characteristics:

:* it is enforceable by law;
:* imposed under the authority of the legislature;
:* levied by a public body; and
:* intended for a public purpose.

In order for a tax to be validly imposed, it must meet the requirements of s. 53 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, but the authority for such imposition may be delegated within certain limits. Major J noted in &quot;Re Eurig Estate&quot;:

This was endorsed by Iacobucci J in &quot;Ontario English Catholic Teachers&#x27; Assn. v. Ontario (Attorney General)&quot;, and he further stated:

===Taxation vs regulatory charge===

In &quot;Westbank First Nation v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority&quot;, the SCC declared that a government levy would be in pith and substance a tax if it was &quot;unconnected to any form of a regulatory scheme.&quot; The test for a regulatory fee set out in &quot;Westbank&quot; requires:

:* a complete, complex and detailed code of regulation;
:* a regulatory purpose which seeks to affect some behaviour;
:* the presence of actual or properly estimated costs of the regulation; and
:* a relationship between the person being regulated and the regulation, where the person being regulated either benefits from, or causes the need for, the regulation.

In &quot;620 Connaught Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General)&quot;, the &quot;Westbank&quot; framework was qualified to require &quot;a relationship between the charge and the scheme itself.&quot; This has resulted in situations where an imposition can be characterized as neither a valid regulatory charge nor a valid tax. In &quot;Confédération des syndicats nationaux v. Canada (Attorney General)&quot;, a funding scheme for employment insurance that was intended to be self-financing instead generated significant surpluses that were not used to reduce EI premiums in accordance with the legislation. It was therefore held to be contrary to the federal unemployment insurance power under s. 91(2A) and thus not a valid regulatory charge, and there was no clear authority in certain years for setting such excess rates, so it was not a valid tax.

===Direct vs indirect taxation===

The question of whether a tax is &quot;direct taxation&quot; (and thus falling within provincial jurisdiction) was summarized by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in &quot;The Attorney General for Quebec v Reed&quot;, where Lord Selborne stated:

&quot;Indirect taxation&quot; has been summarized by Rand J in &quot;Canadian Pacific Railway Co. v. Attorney General for Saskatchewan&quot; in these words:

When the definition of &quot;direct taxation&quot; is read with s. 92(2)&#x27;s requirement that it be levied &quot;within the Province&quot;, it has been held that:

:* provincial taxes must fasten onto provincially located persons, property or transactions, or to extraprovincial persons conducting economic activity within the province
:* they may not be levied on goods destined for export
:* they must not impede the flow of interprovincial trade

===Licensing fees and regulatory charges===

&quot;Allard Contractors Ltd. v. Coquitlam (District)&quot; held that:

:* provincial legislatures may charge a fee that is of an indirect nature, where it is supportable as ancillary or adhesive to a valid regulatory scheme under a provincial head of power.
:* in &quot;obiter&quot;, La Forest J&#x27;s observation was cited with approval that s. 92(9) (together with the provincial powers over property and civil rights and matters of a local or private nature) allows for the levying of license fees even if they constitute indirect taxation.

==Administration==

Federal taxes are collected by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Under tax collection agreements, the CRA collects and remits to the provinces:

:* provincial personal income taxes on behalf of all provinces except Quebec, through a system of unified tax returns.
:* corporate taxes on behalf of all provinces except Quebec and Alberta.
:* that portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax that is in excess of the federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) rate, with respect to the provinces that have implemented it.

The Agence du Revenu du Québec collects the GST in Quebec on behalf of the federal government, and remits it to Ottawa.
==Income taxes==

The Parliament of Canada entered the field with the passage of the &quot;Business Profits War Tax Act, 1916&quot; (essentially a tax on larger businesses, chargeable on any accounting periods ending after 1914 and before 1918). It was replaced in 1917 by the &quot;Income War Tax Act, 1917&quot; (covering personal and corporate income earned from 1917 onwards). Similar taxes were imposed by the provinces in the following years.


Municipal income taxes existed as well in certain municipalities, but such taxation powers were gradually abolished as the provinces established their own collection régimes, and none survived the Second World War, as a consequence of the Wartime Tax Rental Agreements.

:* From 1850, municipal councils in Ontario possessed authority to levy taxes on income, where such amount was greater than the value of a taxpayer&#x27;s personal property. The personal property limitation was removed with the passage of the &quot;Assessment Act&quot; in 1904. By 1936, some 200 councils ranging in size from Toronto to Blenheim Township were collecting such taxes. Toronto levied personal income taxes until 1936, and corporate income taxes until 1944.
:* From 1855 to 1870, and once more from 1939, income tax was imposed on residents of Quebec City. In 1935, a municipal income tax was imposed on the income of individuals resident or doing business in Montreal and the municipalities of the Montreal Metropolitan Commission. Similar income taxes were also imposed in Sherbrooke from 1886 to 1912, in Sorel from 1889, and Hull from 1893.
:* In Prince Edward Island, Summerside had an income tax from 1870 to 1880, and Charlottetown imposed one from 1880 to 1888.
:* While Nova Scotia permitted municipal income tax in 1835, Halifax was the first municipality to levy one in 1849.
:* New Brunswick allowed the collection of income taxes in 1831. However, serious enforcement did not begin until 1849, but it was only in 1908 when all municipalities in the province were required to collect it.

===Personal income taxes===
Both the federal and provincial governments have imposed income taxes on individuals, and these are the most significant sources of revenue for those levels of government accounting for over 45% of tax revenue. The federal government charges the bulk of income taxes with the provinces charging a somewhat lower percentage, except in Quebec. Income taxes throughout Canada are progressive with the high income residents paying a higher percentage than the low income.

Where income is earned in the form of a capital gain, only half of the gain is included in income for tax purposes; the other half is not taxed.

Settlements and legal damages are generally not taxable, even in circumstances where damages (other than unpaid wages) arise as a result of breach of contract in an employment relationship.

Federal and provincial income tax rates are shown at Canada Revenue Agency&#x27;s website.

Personal income tax can be deferred in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP) (which may include mutual funds and other financial instruments) that are intended to help individuals save for their retirement. Tax-Free Savings Accounts allow people to hold financial instruments without taxation on the income earned.

===Corporate taxes===

Companies and corporations pay corporate tax on profit income and on capital. These make up a relatively small portion of total tax revenue. Tax is paid on corporate income at the corporate level before it is distributed to individual shareholders as dividends. A tax credit is provided to individuals who receive dividend to reflect the tax paid at the corporate level. This credit does not eliminate double taxation of this income completely, however, resulting in a higher level of tax on dividend income than other types of income. (Where income is earned in the form of a capital gain, only half of the gain is included in income for tax purposes; the other half is not taxed.)

Corporations may deduct the cost of capital following capital cost allowance regulations. The Supreme Court of Canada has interpreted the Capital Cost Allowance in a fairly broad manner, allowing deductions on property which was owned for a very brief period of time, and property which is leased back to the vendor from which it originated.

Starting in 2002, several large companies converted into &quot;income trusts&quot; in order to reduce or eliminate their income tax payments, making the trust sector the fastest-growing in Canada . Conversions were largely halted on October 31, 2006, when Finance Minister Jim Flaherty announced that new income trusts would be subject to a tax system similar to that of corporations, and that these rules would apply to existing income trusts after 2011.
Capital tax is a tax charged on a corporation&#x27;s taxable capital. Taxable capital is the amount determined under Part 1.3 of the Income Tax Act (Canada) plus accumulated other comprehensive income.

On January 1, 2006, capital tax was eliminated at the federal level. Some provinces continued to charge corporate capital taxes, but effective July 1, 2012, provinces have stopped levying corporation capital taxes. In Ontario the corporate capital tax was eliminated July 1, 2010 for all corporations, although it was eliminated effective January 1, 2007, for Ontario corporations primarily engaged in manufacturing or resource activities. In British Columbia the corporate capital tax was eliminated as of April 1, 2010.

From 1932 until 1951, Canadian companies were able to file consolidated tax returns, but this was repealed with the introduction of the business loss carryover rules. In 2010, the Department of Finance launched consultations to investigate whether corporate taxation on a group basis should be reintroduced. As no consensus was reached in such consultations, it was announced in the 2013 Budget that moving to a formal system of corporate group taxation was not a priority at this time.

===International taxation===
Canadian residents and corporations pay income taxes based on their world-wide income. Canadians are in principle protected against double taxation receiving income from certain countries which gave agreements with Canada through the foreign tax credit, which allows taxpayers to deduct from their Canadian income tax otherwise payable from the income tax paid in other countries. A citizen who is currently not a resident of Canada may petition the CRA to change her or his status so that income from outside Canada is not taxed.

Non-residents of Canada with taxable earnings in Canada (e.g. rental income and property disposition income) are required to pay Canadian income tax on these amounts. Rents paid to non-residents are subject to a 25% withholding tax on the “gross rents”, which is required to be withheld and remitted to Canada Revenue Agency (“CRA”) by the payer (i.e. the Canadian agent of the non-resident, or if there is no agent, the renter of the property) each time rental receipts are paid or credited to the account of the non-resident by the payer. If the payer does not remit the required withholding taxes by the 15th day following the month of payment to the non-resident, the payer will be subject to penalties and interest on the unpaid amounts.

===Payroll taxes===

Employers are required to remit various types of payroll taxes to the different jurisdictions they operate in:

==Consumption taxes==

===Sales taxes===

The federal government levies a value-added tax of 5%, called the Goods and Services Tax (GST), and, in five provinces, the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba levy a retail sales tax, and Quebec levies its own value-added tax, which is called the Quebec Sales Tax. The province of Alberta and the territories of Nunavut, Yukon, and Northwest Territories do not levy sales taxes of their own.

Retail sales taxes were introduced in the various provinces on these dates:


====Current sales tax rates====

===Excise taxes===

Both the federal and provincial governments impose excise taxes on inelastic goods such as cigarettes, gasoline, alcohol, and for vehicle air conditioners. Canada has some of the highest rates of taxes on cigarettes and alcohol in the world, constituting a substantial share of the retail total price of cigarettes and alcohol paid by consumers. These are sometimes referred to as sin taxes. It is generally accepted that higher prices help deter consumption of these items, which increase health care costs stemming from their use.

The vehicle air conditioner tax is currently set at $100 per air conditioning unit.


At the federal level, Canada has imposed other excise taxes in the past:

:* From 1915 to 1953, on the issue of cheques and other commercial paper.
:* From 1920 to 1927, on advances of money
:* From 1920 to 1953, on the transfer of securities. Initially applying to shares, it was extended to cover bonds and related items in 1922.
:* From 1923 to 1926, on the issue of receipts.

==Capital gains tax==
A Capital gains tax was first introduced in Canada by Pierre Trudeau and his finance minister Edgar Benson in the 1971 Canadian federal budget.

Some exceptions apply, such as selling one&#x27;s primary residence which may be exempt from taxation. Capital gains made by investments in a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA) are not taxed.

Since the 2013 budget, interest can no longer be claimed as a capital gain. The formula is the same for capital losses and these can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future years&#x27; capital gains; capital losses not used in the current year can also be carried back to the previous three tax years to offset capital gains tax paid in those years.

If one&#x27;s income is primarily derived from capital gains then it may not qualify for the 50% multiplier and will instead be taxed at the full income tax rate. CRA has a number of criteria to determine whether this will be the case.

For corporations as for individuals, 50% of realized capital gains are taxable. The net taxable capital gains (which can be calculated as 50% of total capital gains minus 50% of total capital losses) are subject to income tax at normal
corporate tax rates. If more than 50% of a small business&#x27;s income is derived from specified investment business activities (which include income from capital gains) they are not permitted to claim the small business deduction.

Capital gains earned on income in a Registered Retirement Savings Plan are not taxed at the time the gain is realized (i.e. when the holder sells a stock that has appreciated inside of their RRSP) but they are taxed when the funds are withdrawn from the registered plan (usually after being converted to a Registered Income Fund at the age of 71.) These gains are then taxed at the individual&#x27;s full marginal rate.

Capital gains earned on income in a TFSA are not taxed at the time the gain is realized. Any money withdrawn from a TFSA, including capital gains, are also not taxed.

Unrealized capital gains are not taxed.

=== Capital Gains on a Primary Residence ===
Primary residences are exempt from capital gains. Any gains from selling a primary residence will not be considered a capital gain for taxation purposes. Any losses are also not considered, and cannot be used to offset previous, current, or future capital gains.

If a property is designated as a primary residence for only a part of the time held, the exemption will only apply to any price appreciation or loss during the time it was a primary residence. Usually, any price appreciation or loss at the time of sale will be divided evenly across the time the property was held. The price appreciation or loss during the time the property was not a primary residence will be subject to treatment as capital gains.

==Wealth taxes==
===Property taxes===

There are two main types of property taxes: the annual tax and land transfer tax.

Annual Property Tax

The municipal level of government is funded largely by property taxes on residential, industrial and commercial properties; when the municipal council determines the financial budget for the year, they predict an expected revenue that needs to be funded by property tax for municipal services and decide a municipal tax rate that will allow them to achieve the revenue amount. The annual property tax is usually a percentage of the taxable assessed value of the property which is commonly determined by the assessment service provider of the municipality. The annual property tax for any province contains at least two elements: the municipal rate and the education rate. The combination of municipal and education tax portions along with any base taxes or other special taxes determines the full amount of the tax. These taxes account for about ten percent of total taxation in Canada.

Land Transfer Tax

Land transfer tax is due upon the closing of a transfer of property and is calculated based on the market value of the property at a marginal tax rate, although exceptions are determined on a provincial level. Toronto has the highest land transfer tax rates in Canada as it levies an additional land transfer tax equal in value to the Ontario land transfer tax. Alberta and Saskatchewan do not charge land transfer tax. To provide relief for the high costs of land transfer tax, some provinces provide rebates for first-time home buyers:

:* In BC and Ontario, a First Time Home Buyers’ Program is offered to refund a portion of the land transfer tax 
:* In Prince Edward Island, all qualifying first-time home buyers are exempt from paying the tax entirely
:* In Montreal, the Montreal Home Ownership Program provides a lump-sum subsidy for purchasing a first home

===Gift tax===
Gift tax was first imposed by the Parliament of Canada in 1935 as part of the &quot;Income War Tax Act&quot;. It was repealed at the end of 1971, but rules governing the tax on capital gains that then came into effect include gifts as deemed dispositions made at fair market value, that come within their scope.

===Estate tax===

Estate taxes have been held to be valid &quot;direct taxation within the province,&quot; but they cannot be charged where property is left outside the province to beneficiaries who are neither resident nor domiciled in the province. Succession duties were in effect in the various provinces at the following times:

Estate taxes, which were not subject to the territorial limitations that affected provincial taxation, were first introduced at the federal level under the &quot;Dominion Succession Duty Act&quot; in 1941, which was later replaced by the &quot;Estate Tax Act&quot; in 1958. The latter was repealed at the end of 1971. From 1947 to 1971, there was a complicated set of federal-provincial revenue-sharing arrangements, where:

:* In Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Manitoba, the federal government collected estate taxes at full rates, but remitted 75% of the revenues derived from each of those provinces;
:* In Alberta and Saskatchewan, the federal government collected estate taxes at full rates, but remitted 75% of the revenues derived from each of those provinces, which was rebated back to the estate;
:* In British Columbia, the federal government collected estate taxes at only 25% of the full rate, and the province continued to levy its own succession duty;
:* In Ontario and Quebec, the federal government collected estate taxes at only 50% of the full rate, and remitted 50% of such collections to such provinces, and the provinces continued to levy their own succession duties.

Upon the repeal of the federal estate tax in 1972, the income tax régime was altered to incorporate consequences arising from the death of a taxpayer, which may result in tax being owed:

:* the property of an estate is said to have incurred a &quot;deemed disposition&quot; at fair market value, thus triggering liability for capital gains and other inclusions into income
:* certain deductions and deferrals are available with respect to capital gains
:* several options are available for applying any outstanding net capital losses
:* income earned or accrued up to the date of death is taxed on the final tax return of the deceased at normal tax rates, but there are several additional optional tax returns that may be filed as well for certain types of income
:* income earned after the date of death is to be declared on a separate return filed by the trust for the estate
:* beneficiaries are taxed on amounts paid from Registered Retirement Savings Plans and registered retirement income funds, but certain rollover reliefs are available

<doc id="672136" wikidata="Q1278284" url="?curid=672136" title="Eastman School of Music">
<text>The Eastman School of Music is the music school of the University of Rochester, a private research university in Rochester, New York, United States. Established in 1921 by celebrated industrialist and philanthropist George Eastman, it was the first professional school of the university.

The school offers Bachelor of Music (BM) degrees, Master of Arts (MA) degrees, Master of Music (MM) degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees, and Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) degrees in various musical fields, along with a special dual degree with the College of Arts &amp; Sciences for students with multiple interests.

As of 2024, there were more than 950 students enrolled in the collegiate division of the Eastman School (approximately 500 undergraduate and 450 graduate students).

==History==
Alfred Klingenberg, a Norwegian pianist, was the school&#x27;s first director, serving from 1921 to 1923. He was succeeded by composer Howard Hanson in 1924, who had an enormous impact on the development of the school, including influencing the creation the first Doctor of Musical Arts degree in the United States. Upon his retirement in 1964, after serving as director of the school for 40 years, Hanson was succeeded by conductor Walter Hendl.

Hendl served as director from 1964 to 1972, and was then succeeded by pianist and musicologist Robert Freeman who served from 1972 to 1996. Associate Director Daniel Patrylak served as the acting director from the time of Hendl&#x27;s resignation (May 1972) until Robert Freeman assumed the position in July 1973. Following the resignation of Robert Freeman in 1996, James Undercofler was then appointed Director and Dean of the Eastman School, and held that position until he resigned in 2006 to accept the position of CEO and President of the Philadelphia Orchestra.

Jamal Rossi, an Eastman alumnus, was appointed Interim Dean of the Eastman School in April 2006. On May 21, 2007, composer/conductor Douglas Lowry, formerly the dean of the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, was appointed Dean of the Eastman School, to begin serving in 2007. Following Lowry&#x27;s death in 2013, Rossi was appointed Dean.

== Campus and facilities ==
The Eastman School occupies parts of five buildings in downtown Rochester, New York. The main hall includes the renovated 3,094-seat Eastman Theater, the 455-seat Kilbourn Hall, the 222-seat Hatch Recital Hall, and offices for faculty.

The Eastman Theatre opened in 1922 as a center for music, dance, and silent film with orchestral and organ accompaniment. Today, the 3,094-seat theatre is the primary concert hall for the Eastman School&#x27;s larger ensembles, including its orchestras, wind ensembles, jazz ensembles, and chorale. Also, the Eastman Opera Theatre presents fully staged operatic productions in the theatre each spring. It also is the principal performance venue for the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra. A $5 million renovation of the theatre was completed in 2004. The theatre is located at 60 Gibbs Street, on the corner of Main and Gibbs Streets. Due to a $10 million donation by Eastman Kodak Inc. in April 2008, the Eastman Theatre was officially renamed &quot;Kodak Hall at Eastman Theatre&quot; upon the renovation&#x27;s completion in 2010.

The Sibley Music Library—the largest academic music library in North America, is located across the street from the main hall. Hiram Watson Sibley founded the library in 1904 using the fortune he made as first president of Western Union. It moved to its current location in 1989, and occupies on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors of the Miller Center, formerly known as Eastman Place. The Sibley Music Library currently holds almost 750,000 items, ranging from 11th century codices to the latest compositions and recordings. Considered among its jewels are the original drafts of Debussy&#x27;s impressionistic masterpiece, &quot;La Mer&quot;.

The Student Living Center, which is located at 100 Gibbs Street, is the dormitory building of the Eastman School of Music. In 1991, the new building was opened at the corner of Main and Gibbs Streets, replacing the University Avenue dormitories built nearly 70 years earlier. It is a four-story quadrangle and 14-story tower surrounding a landscaped inner courtyard, and contains its own dining hall. The majority of students enrolled in the undergraduate program live on campus in this building.

== Academics ==
The school offers Bachelor of Music (BM) degrees, Master of Arts (MA) degrees, Master of Music (MM) degrees, Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees, and Doctor of Musical Arts (DMA) degrees in many musical fields. The school also awards a &quot;Performer&#x27;s Certificate&quot; or &quot;Artist&#x27;s Diploma&quot; to students who demonstrate exceptionally outstanding performance ability. The Institute for Music Leadership, which was formed in 2001, offers a variety of diploma programs designed to educate and give students the skills and experience necessary to meet the demands of performance and education in today&#x27;s changing musical world. In 2018, The Institute for Music Leadership created a Master of Arts degree in Music Leadership for musicians who seek to lead traditional or non-traditional musical arts organizations.

== Reputation ==
In 2024, &quot;Billboard&quot; named the Eastman School of Music as the Top Music Business School.

== Faculty and alumni ==

Eastman alumni include Jazz bassist Ron Carter, singer Renée Fleming, bass-baritone William Warfield, Canadian Brass co-founder Charles Daellenbach, cellist Robert deMaine, drummer Steve Gadd, bassist Tony Levin, flugelhornist Chuck Mangione, author and journalist Michael Walsh, trumpeter Allen Vizzutti, scholar Horace Clarence Boyer and composers Maria Schneider, Robert Paterson, and Cardon V. Burnham. Current faculty include musicians and pedagogues like the Ying Quartet, Anthony Dean Griffey, Katherine Ciesinski and Paul O&#x27;Dette.

<doc id="672137" wikidata="Q809834" url="?curid=672137" title="Base station subsystem">
<text>The base station subsystem (BSS) is the section of a traditional cellular telephone network which is responsible for handling traffic and signaling between a mobile phone and the network switching subsystem. The BSS carries out transcoding of speech channels, allocation of radio channels to mobile phones, paging, transmission and reception over the air interface and many other tasks related to the radio network.

==Base transceiver station==

The base transceiver station, or BTS, contains the equipment for transmitting and receiving radio signals (transceivers), antennas, and equipment for encrypting and decrypting communications with the base station controller (BSC). Typically a BTS for anything other than a picocell will have several transceivers (TRXs) which allow it to serve several different frequencies and different sectors of the cell (in the case of sectorised base stations).

A BTS is controlled by a parent BSC via the &quot;base station control function&quot; (BCF). The BCF is implemented as a discrete unit or even incorporated in a TRX in compact base stations. The BCF provides an operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) connection to the network management system (NMS), and manages operational states of each TRX, as well as software handling and alarm collection.

The functions of a BTS vary depending on the cellular technology used and the cellular telephone provider. There are vendors in which the BTS is a plain transceiver which receives information from the MS (mobile station) through the Um air interface and then converts it to a TDM (PCM) based interface, the Abis interface, and sends it towards the BSC. There are vendors which build their BTSs so the information is preprocessed, target cell lists are generated and even intracell handover (HO) can be fully handled. The advantage in this case is less load on the expensive Abis interface.

The BTSs are equipped with radios that are able to modulate layer 1 of interface Um; for GSM 2G+ the modulation type is Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK), while for EDGE-enabled networks it is GMSK and 8-PSK. This modulation is a kind of continuous-phase frequency-shift keying. In GMSK, the signal to be modulated onto the carrier is first smoothed with a Gaussian low-pass filter prior to being fed to a frequency modulator, which greatly reduces the interference to neighboring channels (adjacent-channel interference).

Antenna combiners are implemented to use the same antenna for several TRXs (carriers), the more TRXs are combined the greater the combiner loss will be. Up to 8:1 combiners are found in micro and pico cells only.

Frequency hopping is often used to increase overall BTS performance; this involves the rapid switching of voice traffic between TRXs in a sector. A hopping sequence is followed by the TRXs and handsets using the sector. Several hopping sequences are available, and the sequence in use for a particular cell is continually broadcast by that cell so that it is known to the handsets.

A TRX transmits and receives according to the GSM standards, which specify eight TDMA timeslots per radio frequency. A TRX may lose some of this capacity as some information is required to be broadcast to handsets in the area that the BTS serves. This information allows the handsets to identify the network and gain access to it. This signalling makes use of a channel known as the Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH).

===Sectorization===

By using directional antennas on a base station, each pointing in different directions, it is possible to sectorise the base station so that several different cells are served from the same location. Typically these directional antennas have a beamwidth of 65 to 85 degrees. This increases the traffic capacity of the base station (each frequency can carry eight voice channels) whilst not greatly increasing the interference caused to neighboring cells (in any given direction, only a small number of frequencies are being broadcast). Typically two antennas are used per sector, at spacing of ten or more wavelengths apart. This allows the operator to overcome the effects of fading due to physical phenomena such as multipath reception. Some amplification of the received signal as it leaves the antenna is often used to preserve the balance between uplink and downlink signal.

==Base station controller==
The base station controller (BSC) provides, classically, the &quot;intelligence&quot; behind the BTSs. Typically a BSC has tens or even hundreds of BTSs under its control. The BSC handles allocation of radio channels, receives measurements from the mobile phones, and controls handovers from BTS to BTS (except in the case of an inter-BSC handover in which case control is in part the responsibility of the anchor MSC). A key function of the BSC is to act as a concentrator where many different low capacity connections to BTSs (with relatively low utilisation) become reduced to a smaller number of connections towards the mobile switching center (MSC) (with a high level of utilisation). Overall, this means that networks are often structured to have many BSCs distributed into regions near their BTSs which are then connected to large centralised MSC sites.

The BSC is undoubtedly the most robust element in the BSS as it is not only a BTS controller but, for some vendors, a full switching center, as well as an SS7 node with connections to the MSC and serving GPRS support node (SGSN) (when using GPRS). It also provides all the required data to the operation support subsystem (OSS) as well as to the performance measuring centers.

A BSC is often based on a distributed computing architecture, with redundancy applied to critical functional units to ensure availability in the event of fault conditions. Redundancy often extends beyond the BSC equipment itself and is commonly used in the power supplies and in the transmission equipment providing the A-ter interface to PCU.

The databases for all the sites, including information such as carrier frequencies, frequency hopping lists, power reduction levels, receiving levels for cell border calculation, are stored in the BSC. This data is obtained directly from radio planning engineering which involves modelling of the signal propagation as well as traffic projections.

===Transcoder===
The transcoder is responsible for transcoding the voice channel coding between the coding used in the mobile network, and the coding used by the world&#x27;s terrestrial circuit-switched network, the Public Switched Telephone Network. Specifically, GSM uses a regular pulse excited-long term prediction (RPE-LTP) coder for voice data between the mobile device and the BSS, but pulse-code modulation (A-law or μ-law standardized in ITU G.711) upstream of the BSS. RPE-LPC coding results in a data rate for voice of 13 kbit/s where standard PCM coding results in 64 kbit/s. Because of this change in data rate &quot;for the same voice call&quot;, the transcoder also has a buffering function so that PCM 8-bit words can be recoded to construct GSM 20 ms traffic blocks.

Although transcoding (compressing/decompressing) functionality is defined as a base station function by the relevant standards, there are several vendors which have implemented the solution outside of the BSC. Some vendors have implemented it in a stand-alone rack using a proprietary interface. In Siemens&#x27; and Nokia&#x27;s architecture, the transcoder is an identifiable separate sub-system which will normally be co-located with the MSC. In some of Ericsson&#x27;s systems it is integrated to the MSC rather than the BSC. The reason for these designs is that if the compression of voice channels is done at the site of the MSC, the number of fixed transmission links between the BSS and MSC can be reduced, decreasing network infrastructure costs.

This subsystem is also referred to as the &quot;transcoder and rate adaptation unit&quot; (TRAU). Some networks use 32 kbit/s ADPCM on the terrestrial side of the network instead of 64 kbit/s PCM and the TRAU converts accordingly. When the traffic is not voice but data such as fax or email, the TRAU enables its rate adaptation unit function to give compatibility between the BSS and MSC data rates.

==Packet control unit==
The packet control unit (PCU) is a late addition to the GSM standard. It performs some of the processing tasks of the BSC, but for packet data. The allocation of channels between voice and data is controlled by the base station, but once a channel is allocated to the PCU, the PCU takes full control over that channel.

The PCU can be built into the base station, built into the BSC or even, in some proposed architectures, it can be at the SGSN site. In most of the cases, the PCU is a separate node communicating extensively with the BSC on the radio side and the SGSN on the Gb side.

==BSS interfaces==
;Um: The air interface between the mobile station (MS) and the BTS. This interface uses LAPDm protocol for signaling, to conduct call control, measurement reporting, handover, power control, authentication, authorization, location update and so on. Traffic and signaling are sent in bursts of 0.577 ms at intervals of 4.615 ms, to form data blocks each 20 ms.
;Abis: The interface between the BTS and BSC. Generally carried by a DS-1, ES-1, or E1 TDM circuit. Uses TDM subchannels for traffic (TCH), LAPD protocol for BTS supervision and telecom signaling, and carries synchronization from the BSC to the BTS and MS.
;A: The interface between the BSC and MSC. It is used for carrying traffic channels and the BSSAP user part of the SS7 stack. Although there are usually transcoding units between BSC and MSC, the signaling communication takes place between these two ending points and the transcoder unit doesn&#x27;t touch the SS7 information, only the voice or CS data are transcoded or rate adapted.
;Ater: The interface between the BSC and transcoder. It is a proprietary interface whose name depends on the vendor (for example Ater by Nokia), it carries the A interface information from the BSC leaving it untouched.
;Gb: Connects the BSS to the SGSN in the GPRS core network.

<text>Sprengisandur () is a highland plateau in Iceland, defined roughly as the area between the Hofsjökull and Vatnajökull glaciers.

== History and etymology ==
Like Kjölur and Kaldidalur, Sprengisandur is an ancient pass - during the time of the Icelandic Free State (ca. 930–1265) it was one of the several important north–south routes that connected remote regions of the island to the Plains of the Parliament, Þingvellir, where the yearly parliament, Alþingi, was held each year at midsummer. In the sagas of Icelanders it is often called simply &quot;Sandr&quot; &quot;Sand&quot; or &quot;Sandleið&quot;, &quot;Sand trail&quot;. At its southern end, it was joined with another such route, Fjallabaksvegur nyrðri, running west from Landmannalaugar mountain hot springs area.

Sprengisandur is only accessible during summer - like other parts of the inner desert, it is impassable in winter because of the snow, and in spring because of floods. While being the shortest way to the Alþingi for some Icelanders, for example, those living around lake Ljósavatn that is very close to the northern end of the route, and for inhabitants of Vopnafjörður, it had the downside of having by far the longest stretch through the forbidding inner desert regions among the other possible routes. For hundreds of kilometers, there was no fodder for horses to be had, and no human habitation to take shelter in. This feature gave the area its name: it is derived from Icelandic noun &quot;sandur&quot; &quot;sand&quot;, which denotes the volcanic ash deserts of the center of the island, and the verb &quot;sprengja&quot; that means &quot;to ride a horse to death; to be on the point of bursting after running for too long&quot;. One needed to ride as fast as possible, nearly driving the horses to death, to cross the mountain desert and reach the inhabited regions of the island again before one ran out of victuals.

Hence, Sprengisandur was, if at all possible, avoided by medieval Icelanders, even if it meant taking the longer route. One example is in ch. 8 of the Hrafnkels saga: the chieftain Hrafnkell, who lived in the East Fjords and rather close to the northern end of Sprengisandur, prefers to travel to the Alþingi by going south along the shore of the island - his route is much longer and slower, but it goes through inhabited regions for the entire route. His enemies, living in the same neighbourhood but needing speed, decide to take the shorter yet more exhausting Sprengisandur route, so as to arrive at the Alþingi much earlier and have enough time to drum up some support for their case. Another example is in Ölkofra þáttr, where the chieftain Broddi, who lives in Vopnafjörður, returns home from Alþingi by taking the Kjölur route north and then going east along the northern shore of the island - a much longer road home than one through Sprengisandur, yet one going largely through inhabited regions.

As usual with uninhabited places in Iceland, Sprengisandur route was considered to be haunted by ghosts. Both themes, the difficulty of passage and the presence of ghosts, are referred to in the famous Icelandic song &quot;Á Sprengisandi&quot;, written by Grímur Thomsen (1820–1896).

== Developments ==
After the loss of independence in 1265, the route gradually fell out of use and was lost until the 19th century. The modern gravel road goes more or less parallel and a bit southeast of the ancient horse trail. A tourist bus runs over the Sprengisandur every other day from Landmannalaugar to Mývatn and back in July and August. If the weather is good, the route offers views of both glaciers and volcanoes Askja and Herðubreið. In the middle of the track there is a hut of the Icelandic Hiking Club, &quot;Nýidalur&quot;.

== Transport ==
A gravel road called Sprengisandsleið runs through the area and connects Southern Region and Northeastern Region parts of the country. The road, and shorter tracks leading from the main road, are only open in the summer months.

A very remote airfield with two runways named Sprengisandur is located in the area (ICAO: BISP).

<doc id="672145" wikidata="Q4897282" url="?curid=672145" title="Beta Theta Pi">
<text>Beta Theta Pi (), commonly known as Beta, is a North American social fraternity that was founded in 1839 at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. One of North America&#x27;s oldest fraternities, as of August 2023 it consists of 150 active chapters and colonies in the United States and Canada. More than 223,000 members have been initiated worldwide and there are currently around 9,500 undergraduate members. Beta Theta Pi is the oldest of the three fraternities that formed the Miami Triad, along with Phi Delta Theta and Sigma Chi.

== History ==
Students at Miami University at the time of Beta&#x27;s founding had previously formed two rival literary societies: The Erodelphian and Union Literary Society. A student of the school, John Reily Knox, began to gather members of both the Erodelphian and Union Literary Societies to create a new fraternity. In a letter that he wrote four years after the founding of the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;, Knox said that other fraternities being formed possessed &quot;many objectionable features which rendered them liable to be used as engines of evil as well as instruments of good.&quot;

The fraternity was formally founded on August 8, 1839, by eight male students of Miami University. Its founders included:

* Thomas Boston Gordon
* Charles Henry Hardin
* John Reily Knox
* David Linton
* Samuel Taylor Marshall

In 1879, Beta Theta Pi became the first college fraternity to publish its constitution.

=== Men of Principle initiative ===
In August 1996, St. Lawrence University Chairman and Beta Theta Pi alumnus E.B. Wilson wrote a letter to the editor of &quot;The Beta Theta Pi&quot; magazine challenging the general fraternity to undertake a project to reverse the emerging Greek and Beta culture, which he felt was not in line with their core values.

In response to Wilson and several institutional difficulties, the Men of Principle initiative was started during the 1998–99 academic year. Three chapters, Nebraska, Georgia, and Pennsylvania, were used as pilot chapters for the new program. After this first year of piloting, the Men of Principle initiative was officially introduced at the 160th General Convention in Oxford, in 1999.

Since the beginning of the initiative in 1998, its international headquarters closed 64 chapters by 2008 and 85 chapters by 2013 for hazing or failing to comply with standards set by the Men of Principle initiative. As of 2019, approximately 25,000 members graduated from one of the fraternity&#x27;s leadership programs.

The program was later renamed the &quot;John and Nellie Wooden Institute for Men of Principle&quot;, named for member and basketball coach John Wooden, in Oxford, Ohio.

== Symbols ==
The five core values espoused by Beta Theta Pi are cultivation of intellect, responsible conduct, mutual assistance, integrity, and trust. These are the underpinnings for their mission statement to &quot;develop men of principle for a principled life.&quot;

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms of Beta Theta Pi includes the Beta dragon, which, according to the symbolism guide, differs from other artistic or historical concepts of dragons as it is not intended to represent evil or a threat. The fraternity explains it represents courage and respect, depicted as &quot;...calm and caring, rather than [as] many other dragons that are made to seem threatening or aggressive.&quot; In the coat of arms, the Beta dragon is placed on top of a shield; the shield is emblazoned with the three stars of Beta Theta Pi and other stylizations from heraldry. Under that shield is a golden banner upon which is one of Beta&#x27;s mottos &quot;__kai__&quot;.

=== Flag ===
The flag of Beta Theta Pi similarly displays several symbols of the fraternity. The flag includes three horizontal stripes, blue, then white, and then blue. The flag shows three five-pointed stars that are made to form an equilateral triangle. The Beta dragon is set within this equilateral triangle.

=== Flower ===
Beta has designated as its official flower the Beta rose. The fraternity explains that &quot;this light pink rose was officially made the flower of Beta Theta Pi in 1889 at the fraternity&#x27;s semi-centennial convention. The Beta rose was chosen to be the flower by a Beta sweetheart named Leila McKee who had many relations to Beta throughout her life. Her father was a Beta, her brother was a Beta, and she eventually became a Beta sweetheart herself. This rose was accepted by the fraternity because of the purity and beauty that it held.&quot;

=== Badge ===
The badge of Beta Theta Pi was designed to be worn by members of the association under their original constitution that was produced and published in 1839. Over time, the badge&#x27;s look has been changed multiple times, but the badge that is currently used today was made by Major George M. Chandler, &quot;Michigan&quot; 1898. The badge is an 8-sided shield of black and gold and it contains the three stars of the fraternity on the top of the shield and under that is a diamond which is surrounded by a golden laurel. Under the diamond is the capital Greek letters for Beta Theta Pi and below those letters are the Greek characters that represent 1839, the year of the fraternity&#x27;s founding. Members of Beta wear this badge over their hearts to be &quot;in a manner befitting the honor and dignity to which it is entitled&quot;.

The pledge pin is a pin that is worn by pledges of the fraternity. The pledge pin looks similar to the Beta badge, it is an 8-sided shield of white and gold that has 3 golden 5-pointed stars running diagonally across it.

=== Colors ===
The colors that represent Beta Theta Pi are delicate shades of pink and blue. These colors were chosen in the late 1800s when many fraternities were deciding what colors they wanted to represent them. Delicate shades of pink and blue symbolize gentlemen and chivalry, and were chosen for Beta because of their difficulty to produce and sensitivity to stains. Many times people have tried to change the official Beta colors to darker shades of blue and red but these ideas have always been turned down quickly.

=== Poem ===

Beta Theta Pi uses the poem The Bridge Builder as a symbol of its will and estate giving program.

== Local chapter or member misconduct ==
As part of a multi-year dispute over co-ed student housing issues, the Beta Theta Pi chapter at Wesleyan University had been refusing access to campus security personnel. In March 2010, Wesleyan issued a warning to students to avoid the chapter house. In October of that year, a freshman was raped by a non-member, non-student at a Beta Theta Pi Halloween party. In 2012, a lawsuit by a female student at Wesleyan University accused the university&#x27;s chapter of sexual assault and called its fraternity house a &quot;rape factory&quot; due to the predatory practices present and constant sexual assaults of young women visiting the house. Both the fraternity and the university reached an out-of-court settlement with the victim in 2014.

In March 2013, the Carnegie Mellon University chapter was suspended following a police investigation of sexually explicit videos and photographs of female students circulating among members.

In December 2014, the University of California - Santa Barbara chapter was shut down after years of violations and suspensions. Two pledges were sent to the hospital due to hazing which prompted the fraternity&#x27;s national office to finally close the chapter.

In 2017, the Pennsylvania State University chapter was permanently disbanded due to the death of a pledge, Tim Piazza, related to hazing and alcohol abuse. Piazza was forced to drink excessive amounts of alcohol and fell down the stairs into the basement, where he eventually fell into a coma and died. The members of the fraternity had purposefully destroyed video footage of what happened in the basement. Eighteen members of the fraternity were arrested and charged for his wrongful death. The former chapter faces more than 147 charges, including involuntary manslaughter and tampering with evidence.

<doc id="672150" wikidata="Q1726481" url="?curid=672150" title="Ratel IFV">
<text>The Ratel is a South African infantry fighting vehicle. It was the first wheeled infantry fighting vehicle to enter service worldwide and was built on a modified MAN truck chassis. The Ratel was designed in response to a South African Army specification for a light armoured vehicle suited to the demands of rapid offensives, providing maximum firepower and strategic mobility to mechanised infantry units intended to operate across the vast distances of Southern Africa. Primarily envisaged in SADF doctrine as a vehicle that could deliver mechanised infantry and supporting fire to tanks in conventional warfare, it was also anticipated that the Ratel could form the centrepiece for semi-independent battlegroups where logistics or politics precluded the use of tanks. The Ratel was a simple, economical design which helped reduce the significant logistical commitment necessary to keep heavier combat vehicles operational in undeveloped regions. It was generally regarded as an influential concept which incorporated a number of novel features, such as a mine-protected hull, an extended operating range of 1,000 kilometres, and a 20 mm autocannon fitted with what was then a unique twin-linked ammunition feed, allowing turret gunners to rapidly swap between ammunition types during combat.

The first Ratel prototype appeared in March 1972, and serial production commenced in 1976. Rights to the original prototype were also sold to Belgium, which produced an amphibious derivative known as the SIBMAS. The Ratel was produced in three distinct marks between 1976 and 1987, when production ceased. All three marks were modified for a number of diverse battlefield roles. Specialised variants of the Ratel carried mortars, anti-tank guided missiles, or a turret-mounted 90 mm rifled gun.

== Development history ==
During the 1950s, the South African Defence Force (SADF) had been primarily organised to operate alongside the British Armed Forces in the event of a military crisis affecting the British Empire&#x27;s African or Middle Eastern dependencies. This reflected South Africa&#x27;s longstanding defence ties to the United Kingdom and the other member states in the Commonwealth of Nations. As a result of its strategic priorities, the SADF adopted equipment which was either British in origin or otherwise compatible with Commonwealth doctrine. South African infantry units were equipped primarily with Alvis Saracen armoured personnel carriers. This reflected traditional British infantry doctrine, which placed a disproportionate emphasis on dismounted infantry; the role of armoured vehicles like the Saracen was to function as general transporters conveying infantrymen to a battlefield. Afterwards, the infantry was expected to disembark and fight on foot rather than remaining mounted.

The deterioration of relations between South Africa and the United Kingdom in the wake of the Sharpeville Massacre marked a shift in the SADF&#x27;s doctrine and strategic priorities. The SADF became more focused on the threat of domestic insurgency or limited bush conflicts rather than a major conventional war overseas. Additionally, the British government&#x27;s refusal to supply the SADF with new armoured vehicles forced it to turn to alternative suppliers, namely France and West Germany. Both nations cooperated closely with South African firms like Sandock-Austral to set up the country&#x27;s first armoured vehicle factory at Boksburg. West Germany was especially instrumental in the transfer of defence technology; in exchange it received a higher import quota for its automotive products to South Africa. One result was that German companies came to dominate several sectors of the South African civilian and military vehicle market, including achieving a virtual monopoly on the sale of trucks to the SADF. Much of this business was conducted through local subsidiaries such as Springfield-Büssing SA, an East Rand company which was the franchise holder for all Büssing products in South Africa. Springfield-Büssing assembled its vehicles with locally manufactured bodies and engine and chassis components imported from its German parent firm.

In 1968, the SADF began formulating a new mobile warfare doctrine which centered around the independent deployment of mechanised infantry to defend the vast borders of South West Africa (Namibia), which were deemed vulnerable to the threat of insurgency and external infiltration. Mechanised infantry mounted in their own infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) could arrive sooner at contact points, with greater firepower to engage and destroy the enemy where contact was made, as well as greater protection and convenience for troops. During wargaming exercises designed to simulate a foreign invasion of South West Africa, the SADF found none of its preexisting armoured vehicles suitable to fill this role, so development of a new dedicated IFV was undertaken. Any South African IFV had to be a simple, economical design which helped ease the significant logistical commitment to maintain armoured vehicles in border regions otherwise lacking in advanced support or transport infrastructure. Excessive track wear inflicted by the abrasive, sandy terrain of the South West African border prompted South African officials to specify a wheeled vehicle. Wheeled IFVs were also favoured because they possessed a much greater operating range than tracked vehicles, and did not require the use of transporters on South West Africa&#x27;s limited road and rail network. This marked a significant departure from Soviet and Western IFV doctrine, which had rejected wheeled IFVs for their inferior cross-country capability and weight-carrying capacity, as well as the vulnerable nature of their tyres to small arms fire and artillery fragments. However, improvements in power train, suspension, and run-flat tyre technology during the late 1960s helped make the concept of wheeled IFVs more viable. The SADF initially had no other requirements other than a chassis and hull combination capable of supporting a two-man turret.

Springfield-Büssing proposed a six-wheeled IFV built on a modified MAN truck chassis; the first prototype appeared as the &quot;Springfield-Büssing Buffel&quot; in March 1972. After the SADF had evaluated and rejected a number of other designs, including the Thyssen Henschel UR-416, Berliet VXB-170, Panhard M3, and the EE-11 Urutu, the Springfield-Büssing prototype was accepted for service as the &quot;Ratel&quot;. Production was undertaken by Sandock-Austral, which produced the vehicle hulls at its shipyard in Durban before having them transported by rail to its Boksburg facility for integration with the chassis and drive train. Each Ratel was powered by a Büssing D 3256 six-cylinder diesel engine fitted in a compartment at the left rear of its hull with access panels in the roof for ease of maintenance; it could be changed by two technicians with a crane in thirty minutes. It was armed with a 20 mm autocannon, which was standard armament for most Western IFVs at the time and suitable for engaging low-flying aircraft, light armour, and dismounted personnel. The SADF had selected the Hispano-Suiza HS.820 for the Ratel&#x27;s primary armament due to its prior success during trials with Eland armoured cars; however, at the time of production this was superseded by a variant of the Modèle F2 produced under licence as the Denel GI-2.

The Ratel was first tested in combat during Operation Reindeer, a major South African raid on People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) insurgents based out of neighbouring Angola. For the purposes of Operation Reindeer, the SADF experimented with an integrated combat team consisting of mechanised infantry mounted in the new Ratels, backed by attached Eland armoured cars. This caused a number of delays and complications, since the four-wheeled Elands lacked sufficient mobility to keep pace with the Ratels and had to be frequently towed out of thick sand or mud. Operation Reindeer was also complicated by the fact that the Elands utilised petrol engines, which necessitated a separate logistics tail from that of the diesel-powered Ratels.

Although PLAN possessed little conventional warfare capabilities, it was frequently backed by its allies in the Cuban and Angolan armed forces, which were skilled at constructing well-fortified defensive positions and had access to heavy armour. The addition of attached Eland squadrons to mechanised infantry units was considered necessary because they carried 60 mm breech-loading mortars or large 90 mm guns, which were more useful than the Ratel&#x27;s 20 mm autocannon for engaging fixed fortifications, dug-in troops, and enemy armour as needed. However, the Eland&#x27;s shortcomings in terms of mobility and logistics prompted the SADF to replace it with new variants of the Ratel carrying the same armament. The &quot;Ratel-90&quot; fire support vehicle utilised an Eland turret with a 90 mm rifled cannon firing conventional high explosive and high explosive anti-tank shells, while the &quot;Ratel-60&quot; mortar carrier was fitted with an Eland turret mounting a 60 mm mortar. A third variant, the &quot;Ratel Command&quot;, was introduced shortly thereafter and functioned as a mobile command post. The Ratel Command was fitted with additional radio equipment, a public address system, and map tables; it carried a 12.7 mm machine gun as its main armament. The &quot;Ratel-81&quot; was a turretless variant with an 81 mm mortar installed in the passenger compartment. The &quot;Ratel ZT3&quot; was the final variant to be produced and was armed with a bank of ZT3 Ingwe anti-tank guided missiles.

In 1979, Sandock-Austral introduced the Ratel Mk II, which included a number of functional modifications designed to optimise the vehicle for southern African conditions and improve mechanical reliability. In 1985, the Ratel Mk II was superseded by the Ratel Mk III, which incorporated a new cooling system and an automatic cocking mechanism for the 20 mm autocannon. Production ceased in 1987, at which point 1,381 Ratels had been manufactured.

== Service history ==
At the time of the Ratel&#x27;s introduction, South African military officials were attempting to bring combined arms integration to the lowest tactical level, using brigade or even battalion-sized units as the standard all-arms unit rather than divisions. In these theoretical combat battle groups, armoured squadrons and mechanised infantry, transported in Ratels, would be integrated at the company level, giving them sufficient flexibility to operate in concert. The SADF&#x27;s first integrated battle group was Combat Group Juliet, which was envisaged as a conventional strike unit to be activated for raids on guerrilla sanctuaries and infiltration routes along the borders of South West Africa and neighbouring Angola. Combat Group Juliet consisted of two companies of mechanised infantry and a squadron of Eland armoured cars. Later combat groups replaced the Eland squadron with Ratel-90s, which essentially functioned in the same role.

Ratels formed the mainstay of the SADF&#x27;s &quot;ad hoc&quot; battle groups for most of the South African Border War. As the Ratel and most of the SADF&#x27;s other combat vehicles were lightly armoured, South African mechanised doctrine came to revolve around such tactics as rapid movement, striking from the flank, and confusing the enemy with continuous manoeuvring. In this regard the SADF differed greatly from Western IFV doctrine–which confined the IFV&#x27;s role to assisting the forward momentum of tanks–as well as Soviet IFV doctrine, which dictated that IFVs must occupy and hold terrain as needed. Although capable of operating independently, Ratel-based battle groups were not expected to occupy and hold static positions; their primary task was to outmanoeuvre an enemy unit before destroying it with a concentrated fire and movement tactic known as a &quot;firebelt action&quot;. This doctrine was suited for the wide, densely wooded expanses of southern Angola which enabled the South African forces to carry out evasive manoeuvres and strike quickly from unexpected directions without being prematurely detected. Manoeuvre-oriented warfare depended on the Ratel&#x27;s speed and mobility, which were used to maximum effect to compensate for its relatively light armour.

A notable feature of the South African Border War was a cyclical pattern of increasing cross-border infiltration and raids by PLAN guerrillas, primarily from Angola, during the annual rainy season. The SADF&#x27;s Ratels and other wheeled combat vehicles were hampered by thick mud, and the increased foliage cover provided PLAN with concealment from patrols. The rainy season in South West Africa and southern Angola lasted from February to April. At the end of April or early May, when the heaviest rains ceased, South African mechanised battle groups launched retaliatory raids to capture or kill the insurgents in their external sanctuaries. While carrying out an attack, Ratels interspersed into arrowhead-shaped formations, with a platoon of Ratel-20s and a troop of Ratel-90s on each flank, the command Ratels located in the centre, and the remaining Ratels following in reserve. If the mechanised battle group was integrated with tanks—as during Operation Hooper and Operation Packer—the tanks spearheaded the formation to engage hostile armour, while the Ratel-20s and Ratel-90s followed closely on the flanks to suppress any accompanying infantry. Ratel-81s, if present, occupied a place in the centre of the formation, directly behind the command Ratels.

One of the primary threats to the Ratels were hidden bunkers and the maze of trench complexes constructed around PLAN and Angolan military camps. It was not uncommon for a Ratel crew to unwittingly drive atop an insurgent bunker, which collapsed under the weight of their vehicle and rendered it immobile. More frequently, Ratels were surrounded and cut off by PLAN defenders after bogging down in trenches. This necessitated their being towed out with recovery vehicles or other Ratels, often under heavy fire. PLAN training camps were defended by a number of ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns, and these were used in the ground support role with deadly results for immobilised Ratel crews.

During the early 1980s, PLAN carefully re-sited its training camps near Angolan military installations so it could take advantage of the security provided by the attached Angolan armoured and mechanised brigades. This gave PLAN ready access to the logistical and communications infrastructure of its local allies and increased the risk to SADF raids targeting those camps exponentially. The SADF remained conscious of this fact and established a number of improvised anti-tank platoons composed of Ratel-90s to engage Angolan armour if necessary. During Operation Protea and Operation Askari, Ratel-90s were to face Angolan T-34-85, PT-76, and T-54/55 tanks, with mixed results. While the Ratel-90s were for the most part adequate in countering Angola&#x27;s largely obsolete and second-line Soviet tanks, they remained hindered by mediocre standoff ranges, inferior fire control, and a lack of stabilised main armament. Ratel crews often had to manoeuvre behind the tanks and fire on them from the rear to destroy them. This required intense coordination between the vehicle commanders, who directed each other by radio until they were in a position to concentrate volleys on a tank&#x27;s exposed side or rear. As the Angolan tank crews were in no position to out-manoeuvre the Ratels, they prioritised mobility kills. A common tactic was to fire a round beneath the Ratel, destroying the differentials on its axles and rendering it immobile. This stripped the Ratel of its most crucial advantage and made it an easy target for the other tanks.

In the wake of Operation Askari, South African field commanders began complaining that Ratel-90s were being expected to fulfill the role of light tanks rather than serving in their intended role of infantry support. This was a violation of SADF mechanised and armoured doctrine. Consequently, the SADF introduced the Ratel ZT3 anti-tank missile carrier, a Ratel variant designed as a dedicated tank destroyer, in 1987. It was first deployed with marked success against Angolan T-54s during Operation Moduler. The Ratel ZT3 also saw limited action against Cuban T-55s during Operation Excite/Hilti.

The cessation of hostilities with Angola in 1989 and the amalgamation of the SADF into the new South African National Defence Force (SANDF) in 1995 ushered in consistent budget cuts to defence spending, resulting in a reduction of personnel and equipment. At least 354 Ratels were declared surplus to requirements and sold beginning in 2005. Much of the remaining Ratels have been handicapped by the SANDF&#x27;s limited maintenance budget and inadequate numbers of trained maintenance personnel. The Ratel is scheduled to be at least partly superseded in SANDF service by a new eight-wheeled infantry fighting vehicle, the Patria AMV, also designated as the &quot;Badger&quot;.

=== Foreign service ===
After 1977, the domestic South African arms industry was driven by the economic realities of a universal arms embargo imposed on the SADF as a result of United Nations Security Council Resolution 418. The embargo deprived the SADF of many new weapons systems available to other major arms importers, curtailed its attempts to obtain defence technology on the open market, and raised the cost of obtaining spare parts and components for its preexisting equipment. While South Africa was able to partly compensate by developing its local arms industry, the SADF&#x27;s requirements were too small to make the manufacture of a wide range of armaments economically profitable. Defence contractors were compelled to tool up for uneconomical and short production runs of sophisticated hardware, including military vehicles. Furthermore, the domestic manufacture of obsolete equipment items had to be sustained long after their basic technology had become quite dated, simply because no alternatives were available. These unprofitable practices threatened to result in stagnation for the defence sector; firms like Sandock-Austral looked for new ways to gain badly needed funds for future research and development efforts and counter their own rapidly rising production costs. In the early 1980s, South Africa&#x27;s defence contractors turned to export orders to help create the economy of scale necessary to keep their operations viable. They embarked on a massive international marketing drive which included extensive advertising campaigns and exhibits at arms fairs. As a result, public information on vehicles like the Ratel became more readily available in connection with their manufacturers&#x27; marketing efforts.

The Royal Moroccan Army became the first prospective client to show an interest in the Ratel; it was then purchasing arms from a vast array of sources for use in the Western Sahara War. This was pursued as part of a massive re-armament programme being funded through generous military subsidies from Saudi Arabia. Morocco initially made contact with Sandock-Austral after soliciting a French firm, Panhard, for new AML armoured cars. As Panhard was closing its AML production line, it declined the order but referred the Moroccan government to South Africa, where Sandock-Austral was still producing an AML derivative under licence as the Eland. Though extensively modified, the Eland was still familiar to Moroccan crews and maintenance personnel who had been trained by French instructors on the AML. Morocco received the first Elands in 1976 and obligingly placed orders for more vehicles, including a few dozen Ratels, from Sandock-Austral. These were delivered between 1978 and 1980. The Royal Moroccan Army ordered another 80 Ratels in 1979, which were delivered between 1980 and 1981. They were deployed in counter-insurgency operations against the Polisario Front, which captured several Ratel-20s and pressed them into service. In 2016, Morocco was still operating 30 Ratel-20s and 30 Ratel-90s. All of these were the Ratel Mk III variant.

Sandock-Austral&#x27;s attempts to secure new export customers for the Ratel were somewhat curtailed by the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 558, which amended the arms embargo to prohibit all member states from importing South African military equipment. At the time production of the Ratel ceased in 1987, no new export orders had been placed. Export of the Ratel only resumed again in the early 2000s, when the SANDF declared hundreds of its own IFVs surplus to requirements and offered them for sale. The chief recipient of these vehicles was the Royal Jordanian Army, which ordered 100 in 2002 and subsequently, another 221 in 2004. The Jordanian government worked closely with a number of South African contractors, such as the Mechanology Design Bureau and Paramount Group, to maintain and refurbish its Ratel fleet. Some Jordanian Ratel-20s have been retrofitted with a new Cummins QSM11-C330 diesel engine developing 329 hp (246 kW). This improved mechanical performance and extended the Ratels&#x27; maximum road speed to 110 km/h. The new engine necessitated a relocated engine compartment in the centre of the hull.

A number of Jordanian Ratels were retrofitted with a BAU-23 turret carrying twin 23 mm autocannon. Others may have also been retrofitted with a turret carrying both the original 20 mm autocannon in addition to a bank of ZT3 Ingwe missiles. In addition to service with the Royal Jordanian Army, these modified Ratels were exported in small numbers to Yemen between 2008 and 2011. In Yemeni service, the Ratel was utilised for reconnaissance purposes and essentially fulfilled the role of an armoured car. During the Yemeni Revolution, photographs of Ratels seized by defecting army personnel were circulated in the international press, evoking considerable controversy. The South African government acknowledged that it was notified of Jordan&#x27;s intention to deliver the vehicles to Yemen, but had not formally consented to their transfer or amended the original end-user agreement, which made no provision for the re-export of Jordanian Ratels to third parties. A similar controversy erupted when Ratels began appearing in Libyan service in 2013, prompting Democratic Alliance defence spokesman David Maynier to call for a formal inquiry into how Libya could have acquired the vehicles without the knowledge of South Africa&#x27;s National Conventional Arms Control Committee (NCACC). Maynier suggested that Libya, like Yemen, had likely obtained the Ratels from another country in violation of an end-user agreement. Ratels are currently operated by the Libyan National Army, as well as a number of unaffiliated militias such as the Zintan Brigades and the February 17th Martyrs Brigade.
Small quantities of second-hand Ratels have been delivered by the SANDF to a number of other African states, including Ghana, which received 15 Ratel-20s and 24 Ratel-90s in 2004, and Rwanda, which received 15 Ratel-90s and 20 Ratel-60s in 2007. Senegal ordered 26 Ratel-20s in 2008 and had received them by 2010. Zambia also received 20 refurbished ex-SANDF Ratel-20s in 2012. Djibouti purchased 12 Ratel-90s in 2004 from an unknown source. Cameroon&#x27;s Rapid Intervention Battalion acquired 12 Ratel-20s between 2015 and 2016 for demining operations in areas affected by the Boko Haram insurgency.

In 2007, the SANDF committed to donate up to 18 Ratel-90s to the Central African Republic (CAR) under the auspices of Operation Vimbezela. This effort collapsed due to a variety of unforeseen problems: the SANDF was only willing to supply previously decommissioned Ratel-90s and insisted that the donation was contingent on the Central African government making its own arrangements to have them shipped to Bangui. The latter possessed insufficient funds to restore all the Ratel-90s to serviceable condition or cover the shipping cost. Only 2 were delivered while the remainder were reclaimed by the South African contractor responsible for their refurbishment, citing unpaid shipping fees. Both Ratels arrived without adequate parts, maintenance equipment, or ammunition; nevertheless, they were utilised for training purposes by the SANDF mission in the CAR. At least three local crews were trained between 2010 and 2013, after which the vehicles were formally adopted by the Central African Army. The Ratel-90s were deployed without success against Séléka militants during the country&#x27;s 2012–2014 civil war. Their inexperienced crews failed to use them effectively in an offensive role, and ammunition shortages became so acute that President François Bozizé made personal appeals to South African officials for additional stocks of 90 mm shells. After the end of the civil war, it was not clear whether the army retained the Ratel-90s or if either was operational. An arms control panel appointed by the UN Security Council reported that they were still in the CAR in July 2014.

The SANDF has also donated Ratels to multinational peacekeeping forces, namely the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO).

== Description ==
The Ratel was based on a commercial MAN truck chassis, from which many mechanical parts were utilised. Its use of parts otherwise ubiquitous to the civilian automotive industry proved to be an advantage in circumventing the universal arms embargo imposed on South Africa, which extended only to purpose-built military products. The vehicle is not amphibious and is not fitted with an NBC overpressure system. Most production model Ratels did not have any specialised night vision equipment. As an interim measure, the SADF occasionally issued Ratel crews with night vision goggles, which aided navigation in the Angolan bush where the use of headlamps was precluded due to proximity to enemy positions. This was impractical for night fighting as muzzle flashes could blind the crew and the bulky goggles hampered movement and reaction speed in the turret. In the 1990s, Denel Land Systems developed night sights which could be fitted on new Ratel-20 turrets or retrofitted on older turrets.

The Ratel possesses rear-mounted engine and fighting compartments, while its turret ring and driving compartment are located towards the front of the vehicle. It has a long, box-shaped hull with slightly sloped vertical sides and rear. The hull is of all-welded construction, with a maximum armour thickness of 20 mm on the hull front. Each Ratel hull is protected against 7.62×39mm armour-piercing ammunition at any angle; it is also capable of stopping 12.7×108mm armour-piercing ammunition on the frontal arc. The bottom of the hull structure is blastproof and vee-shaped to deflect mine explosions away from the passengers and crew. Ratels frequently detonated stacked anti-tank mines during the South African Border War with little injury to their occupants and minimal drive train damage. On many occasions they were able to keep moving after basic field repairs. Anti-tank mines common in Angola, such as the TMA-3, could destroy a Ratel&#x27;s axles and occasionally damage its gearbox, but almost never penetrated its hull.

The Ratel&#x27;s crew consists of a section commander, driver, turret gunner, and rear gunner. In addition to the crew, an attached infantry section of nine is carried in the fighting compartment of the vehicle. There are three firing ports with vision blocks on either side of the fighting compartment. Passenger capacity may be reduced to six or seven if additional ammunition racks or radio equipment is carried. The infantry section debarks from three large, pneumatically sealed doors on either side of the hull and at the rear; it is also provided with five forward access hatches on the hull roof.

The driver is seated at the front centre of the Ratel and provided with three bulletproof windscreens for use in a combat environment. This design feature was adopted directly from the Berliet VXB-170 and favoured for its enhanced situational awareness. The windscreens are fitted with armoured shutters which could be closed down as needed. Three vision periscopes are provided for the driver. The Ratel&#x27;s steering system is mechanical, with hydraulic assistance. 

Ratel turrets are located towards the front of the vehicle, directly behind the driving compartment, and house two crew members: the section commander to the left and the turret gunner to the right. Both crew members are provided with roof hatches; the commander is also afforded a domed cupola with vision blocks. The commander and gunner have nine day periscopes for all-round observation. The Ratel&#x27;s standard armament is a 20 mm F2 M693 automatic cannon manufactured under licence as the Denel GI-2. The autocannon may be elevated to a maximum of +38° for use against low-flying, fixed wing aircraft and helicopters. It has a selector switch used to alternate between three rates of fire—semi-automatic, limited burst, or fully automatic—and is belt fed from two ammunition chutes in the turret. The dual-feed system allows the gunner to swap between different projectile types fed from either chute as needed. Two types of ammunition can be selected: a high-explosive (HE) round with a range of 2,000 metres, or an armour-piercing tungsten carbide (APTC) round with a range of 1,000 metres. The HE rounds have a muzzle velocity of 1,050 m/s, while the armour-piercing round has an initial muzzle velocity of 1,300 m/s and penetration of 20mm of rolled homogeneous armour at an incidence of 60°.

The GI-2 can achieve a cyclic rate of fire of 700 to 750 rounds per minute and 1,200 rounds of 20 mm ammunition are carried on board. It provides the Ratel with a close support and anti-armour capability which proved sufficient to engage Angolan BTR-60 APCs and light armoured cars such as the BRDM-2 at long range. While the autocannon is generally impotent against heavier armour, well-directed fire or exceptional shots are capable of damaging a tank&#x27;s external features, especially its sights. During Operation Moduler, one Ratel commander directed a stream of 20 mm APTC rounds at an Angolan T-55 at close range, which apparently penetrated a vulnerable margin in its armour and caused a catastrophic kill after igniting the on-board ammunition.

A co-axial 7.62 mm Browning M1919 machine gun is mounted to the left of the main armament on nearly all variants of the Ratel. Aside from the co-axial machine gun, a second 7.62 mm Browning M1919 is carried at the rear of the vehicle&#x27;s hull for anti-aircraft purposes. Both the Ratel-60 and Ratel-90 are also armed with a third 7.62 mm M1919 on their turret roofs. A maximum of 6,000 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition are carried within the vehicle.

The Ratel is powered by a six-cylinder, liquid-cooled, turbocharged D 3256 BTXF diesel engine. This is housed in an engine compartment at the rear left of the hull and coupled to a fully automatic RENK HSU 106 automatic gearbox with six forward and two reverse gear ratios. The gearbox can be operated manually and has a mechanical emergency gearshift. Drive is transmitted to the Ratel&#x27;s three axles in two stages, with final reduction being achieved by epicyclic gearing in the wheel hubs. The three axles have their own locking differentials and longitudinal differential locks. There are hydropneumatic shock dampers at each wheel station.

<doc id="672153" wikidata="Q546221" url="?curid=672153" title="Trump International Hotel and Tower (Chicago)">
<text>The Trump International Hotel and Tower is a skyscraper condo-hotel in downtown Chicago, Illinois. The building, named for Donald Trump, was designed by architect Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Bovis Lend Lease built the 100-story structure, which reaches a height of including its spire, its roof topping out at . It is next to the main branch of the Chicago River, with a view of the entry to Lake Michigan beyond a series of bridges over the river. The building received publicity when the winner of the first season of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; reality television show, Bill Rancic, chose to manage the construction of the tower over managing a Rancho Palos Verdes–based Trump National Golf Course &amp; Resort in the Los Angeles metro area.

Trump announced in 2001 that the skyscraper would become the tallest building in the world, but after the September 11 attacks that same year, the architects scaled back the building&#x27;s plans, and its design underwent several revisions. When topped out in 2009, it became the second-tallest building in the U.S. It surpassed the city&#x27;s John Hancock Center as the building with the highest residence (apartment or condo) in the world, and briefly held this title until the completion of the Burj Khalifa.

The design of the building includes, from the ground up, retail space, a parking garage, a hotel and condominiums. The 339-room hotel opened for business with limited accommodations and services on January 30, 2008, then full accommodation and services on April 28. The building was topped out in late 2008 and construction was completed in 2009. In 2024, following a six-year lawsuit, the Trump Tower&#x27;s cooling water intake system was ruled to be in violation of state environmental laws that protect the Chicago River, which it overlooks, by creating and operating &quot;a public nuisance in violation of Illinois law&quot;.

==Location==

The tower sits at 401 North Wabash Avenue in the River North Gallery District, part of the Near North Side community area of Chicago. The building occupies the site vacated by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, one of the city&#x27;s two major newspapers, and its location within the River North Gallery District places it in a neighborhood that has had a high concentration of art galleries since the 1980s. The site, at the foot of Rush Street, is on the north side of the Chicago River just west of the Wrigley Building and the Michigan Avenue Bridge, and just east of Marina City and 330 North Wabash. The building is close to numerous Chicago landmarks; it borders the Michigan-Wacker District, which is a Registered Historic District. Parts of the building are visible throughout the city, and the entire length of the building is visible from boats on the river, as well as from locations to the east along the river, such as the mouth of Lake Michigan, the Lake Shore Drive Overpass, and the Columbus Drive Bridge.

The building is across the Chicago River from the Chicago Loop, the city&#x27;s business district. It is a block away from the southern end of the Magnificent Mile portion of Michigan Avenue. The restaurant, Terrace 16, has a clear view of the Chicago River&#x27;s entrance to Lake Michigan and of the four buildings completed in the 1920s that flank the Michigan Avenue Bridge (Wrigley Building, Tribune Tower, 333 North Michigan, and 360 North Michigan).

==Design and architecture==

The design of the building incorporates three setback features designed to provide visual continuity with the surrounding skyline, each reflecting the height of a nearby building. The first setback, on the east side of the building, aligns with the cornice line of the Wrigley Building to the east; the second, on the west side, aligns with River Plaza to the north and with the Marina City Towers to the west. The third setback, on the east side, relates to 330 North Wabash building (formerly known as IBM Plaza). However, some views distort the alignment of the second setback. The setbacks and rounded edges of the building combat vortex formation. The body of the building is raised above the main Wabash entrance and above the Chicago River. The building&#x27;s Permasteelisa curtain wall uses clear low-emissivity coated glass and a curved wing-shaped polished stainless-steel mullion system that projects from the glass line. It incorporates brushed stainless steel spandrel panels and clear anodized aluminum.

The building has of floor space, rises to 98 stories, and houses 486 luxury residential condominiums. These include studio apartments, a mixture of suites with one to four bedrooms, and five-bedroom penthouses. The tower also features a luxury hotel condominium with 339 guest rooms. The building includes, from the ground up, retail space, a parking garage, a hotel, and condominiums. The 3rd through 12th floors house lobbies, retail space, and the parking garage; the 14th floor and its mezzanine hosts a health club and spa. The 17th floor through the 27th-floor mezzanine contain hotel condominiums and executive lounges. The 28th through 85th floors have residential condominiums, and the 86th through 89th floors have penthouses. A riverfront park and riverwalk, along a space in the area adjacent to the building to the east, was opened in the first half of 2010. The park facilitates public assembly and entertainment activity while linking the building effectively with river commuters.
In 2011, the riverfront park landscaping surrounding the building, which is referred to as Trump Plaza and Riverwalk or sometimes just Trump Plaza, became the subject of controversy. In 2010, the Plaza had earned special recognition at the Mayor Richard M. Daley&#x27;s Landscape Awards. The press release noted the landscaping &quot;for their magnificent new civic landscape that is a poetic interpretation of native Illinois that seems at once sophisticated and familiar.&quot; However, in 2011, the award-winning plantings of small sumac trees, ferns and native grasses with yellow, orange and red hues were removed and replaced with evergreens like junipers and boxwoods, pieces of gray stone, and purple perennials (catmint and salvia), which may require less watering. To add to the controversy, the planting was accompanied by a plan to light the trees to attract nighttime park visitors, in conflict with the &quot;dark skies&quot; movement to reduce light pollution to facilitate better stargazing.

The building broke the record for the world&#x27;s highest residence above ground level, held since 1969 by the nearby John Hancock Center. Because the Trump Tower has both hotel condominiums and residential condominiums, it does not contest the record held by the 88-story 432 Park Avenue in New York City, which, at , is the tallest residential building in the world.

===Height===

The Trump International Hotel and Tower rises from the building&#x27;s main entrance on Wabash Avenue to the tip of the architectural spire. Upon its completion in 2009, the building became the seventh-tallest building in the world, behind the Jin Mao Tower in Shanghai, People&#x27;s Republic of China. On November 17, 2009, however, the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), which composes rankings of the tallest skyscrapers in the world based on various criteria, changed its standard for measuring a building&#x27;s height. Prior to this change, a building&#x27;s architectural height was calculated from the main entrance to the tip of the spire; new standards measured from the lowest open-air pedestrian level of a building. As the Trump International Hotel and Tower has a riverwalk entrance and pedestrian level below the building&#x27;s Wabash Avenue entrance, the skyscraper&#x27;s official height was recalculated as without a physical addition to the structure. According to the CTBUH, the recalculated height also made the tower the sixth-tallest building in the world, surpassing the Jin Mao Tower by . In January 2010, the building moved back to its position as seventh-tallest with the opening of the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

===Sign===

According to Trump, he received approval for a sign from Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley&#x27;s administration in 2009, but renegotiated with Mayor Rahm Emanuel&#x27;s administration. In October 2013, Trump received approval to erect stainless steel letters back-lit with white LED lighting spelling out TRUMP on the 16th floor of the building. He made his impending plans for the sign public in February 2014. According to a city planning department spokesperson, standard protocol for such a sign is to require approval from the local alderman (Brendan Reilly, 42nd ward) and the full Chicago City Council. The five letters span a width of approximately , making the final approved version approximately , according to some sourcesrather than the originally proposed size. The sign is about above ground level.

Crews began hanging the sign in May 2014. When &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; architecture critic Kamin warned Trump that his review of the sign would be unfavorable, Trump responded &quot;As time passes, it&#x27;ll be like the Hollywood Sign&quot;; architect Smith distanced himself from the sign saying &quot;Just for the record, I had nothing to do with this sign!&quot; The controversy surrounding the sign drew attention in the national press and international press as it neared completion and the Associated Press ran a story about Mayor Emanuel&#x27;s disapproval in mid-June. According to the Mayor&#x27;s spokeswoman Kelley Quinn, &quot;Mayor Emanuel believes this is an architecturally tasteful building scarred by an architecturally tasteless sign&quot;. Kamin has noted that part of the problem is the architectural traditions of the city: &quot;If this sign was in Atlantic City or Las Vegas, nobody would care—but it is in Chicago, and in a part of Chicago full of great buildings from the 1920s to the 1960s and onward&quot;. Trump and Reilly both pointed out how unbecoming the prior &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; building signage was. As a result of the fiasco, Emanuel initiated a study on how to alter the rules to avert similar signage controversies in the future. A Chicago-based design firm planned to create and float four giant pig balloons in front of the sign as a protest, but were unsuccessful getting US Coast Guard and Chicago Department of Transportation approvals.

In the wake of the January 6 United States Capitol attack, city alderman Gilbert Villegas proposed a new ordinance that would prevent any renewal of sign permits to persons convicted of &quot;treason, sedition or subversive activities&quot;, specifically targeting the sign.

==Features==

According to the &quot;2010 City Guide: Chicago&quot; edition of the &quot;Forbes Travel Guide&quot;, the building hosts one of the seven four-star restaurants in the city and one of the three four-star spas. The hotel is one of two four star hotels. In 2010, Chicago had two five-star hotels and two five-star restaurants. By the time of the &quot;Forbes Travel Guide&quot;: 2013 City Guide, the hotel and restaurant were each among only three five-star ratings in the city. It retained this ranking in the 2015 Forbes Guide (along with hotels The Peninsula and Four Seasons and with restaurants Alinea and Grace). The spa was among 6 four- or five-star Forbes-rated spas in the Chicago area in 2015.

The restaurant was promoted to two-star rating by the Michelin Guide for 2014 and retained that rating in 2015. It was one of 5 Chicago restaurants to achieve at least a two-star Michelin rating in both years. In 2016, it again retained its two-star rating as one of five restaurants in the city with such a rating.

===Hotel===
The original plan was to have a partial opening of three of the hotel&#x27;s floors on December 3, 2007, with a grand opening to follow. The interim ceremony, however, was delayed until January 30, 2008, while the City of Chicago granted occupancy approval for the staff of the hotel in the first 27 floors. Four floors of guest rooms were opened, comprising 125 of the planned 339 rooms. By January 30, construction on the exterior of the building had passed the 53rd floor. The grand opening of the hotel, including amenities, originally scheduled for March 17, 2008, took place on April 28, 2008. Pulitzer-Prize-winning &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; architecture critic Blair Kamin faults the zebrawood paneling in the hotel lobby, but another &quot;Tribune&quot; reporter praises the hotel for its &quot;understated, contemporary look, distinguished by stunning views&quot;.

===Restaurants===

On the 16th floor, a restaurant named Sixteen opened in early February 2008, and an outdoor patio terrace, named The Terrace at Trump, opened on June 25, 2009, following the completion of construction. The restaurant opened to favorable reviews for its cuisine, decor, location, architecture, and view. Sixteen, which was designed by Joe Valerio, is described architecturally as a sequence of spaces that do not reveal themselves at once, but rather in &quot;procession&quot;. The restaurant&#x27;s foyer is T-shaped, and a passageway to the hotel is lined with floor-to-ceiling architectural bronze wine racks in opposing red and white wine rooms. The passageway leads to views—praised by Kamin—that showcase the Wrigley Building clock tower and the Tribune Tower&#x27;s flying buttresses. Kamin notes that these views are &quot;more intimate&quot; than the panoramic ones of the Signature Room, a restaurant near the top of the Hancock Center. The views are described as equally impressive by day and by night. The main part of the procession is the Tower Room, a dining room with a dome-shaped ceiling made of West African wood. The dome is furnished with Swarovski chandeliers and incorporates mirrors so that all diners can experience the view.

The Terrace, which opened on June 25, 2009, has views of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan as well as Navy Pier&#x27;s seasonal Wednesday and Saturday evening fireworks, and was designed for outdoor or &quot;al fresco&quot; dining.

Rebar—the hotel bar on the mezzanine level—opened on April 18, 2008.

On June 5, 2018, it was announced that Terrace 16 Restaurant &amp; Bar would replace Sixteen. The newly themed dining space was expected to debut during the summer of 2018.

===Spa===
The spa, named The Spa at Trump, opened in late March 2008. The spa offers gemstone-infused (diamond, ruby, or sapphire) oil massages, hydrating masques, exfoliating salts and the &quot;Deluge shower&quot;. The spa features a health club with an indoor pool, eleven treatment rooms, a private couples treatment suite, Swiss shower, and saunas. The Citysearch editorial review described this as the &quot;Bentley of hotel spas&quot;. A &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; critic spoke of the spa in positive terms for both the treatment and the physical spa itself. The Spa at Trump can be accessed from a large circular staircase inside the hotel, enabling its customers to access the facility from specially designed spa guest rooms without using the elevator.

==Development==

=== Design history ===

In July 2001, when Donald Trump announced plans for the site of the former seven-story Sun-Times Building, the tower was expected to reach a height of , which would have made it the world&#x27;s tallest building. It was expected to contain between of floor space and cost about $77 million just for the property rights. Three architectural firms were considered: Lohan Associates, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, and Skidmore, Owings and Merrill; Trump selected Skidmore, Owings and Merrill in August 2001. Adrian Smith, who had previously designed the Jin Mao Tower, headed the SOM team, giving Chicago a third skyscraper from the same firm which had previously designed the Willis Tower and the Hancock Center.

After the terrorist acts of September 11, 2001, Trump reduced the planned height to 78 stories and , to reduce the risk of similar attacks. &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that a meeting between Smith and Trump about erecting the tallest building in Chicago was taking place at the actual time of the attacks. Some international news sources later claimed that the planned tower height was reduced to after the original plans called for a 150-story building that would reach . These claims are supported by computer renderings from 1999 of the proposed skyscraper, shown in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 2005.

The building&#x27;s design was first released in December 2001. However, the first design did not meet with approval from other architects, or from the residents of Chicago. A subsequent revision in July 2002 resulted in an 86-floor design for use as an office and residential structure, similar to the 2006 design which is, however, for a different combination of uses. Smith&#x27;s 2002 plans put broadcast antennas (multiple communications dishes) at the top of the building. A revised 90-story, plan was unveiled in September 2003 for a building including condominiums, office space, a &quot;condominium hotel&quot;, retail stores, and restaurants. In January 2004, another revision changed floors 17 through 26 from offices into condominiums and hotel rooms. In his May 2004 plan, Smith decided to top the building with an ornamental spire instead of communications dishes. These dishes, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, would not have counted toward the building&#x27;s height. The spire, however, will count, raising the tower&#x27;s height to . At one point in 2005, Trump aspired to build a slightly taller building that would surpass the Sears Tower as the nation&#x27;s tallest building, but Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley was against the plan. Eventually, Smith settled on a design with a height of , which was the height of 2 World Trade Center, the shorter of the former twin World Trade Center towers. This height makes the Tower the seventh tallest in the United States.

===Initial phases===
On October 16, 2004, Donald Trump and Hollinger International, the parent company of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, completed the $73 million sale of the former home of the newspaper a week after it relocated. On October 28, 2004, Trump held a ceremony to begin the demolition of the former Sun-Times Building. The demolition and construction were financed by a $650 million loan from Deutsche Bank and a trio of hedge funds, one of which George Soros backed.
In March 2005, the construction process began with the sinking of the first caisson for the tower into the bedrock. In April, construction began on the foundation below the Chicago River. In July 2005, water from the river began seeping into the building site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side. After several other failed attempts to correct the problem, they drove a steel plate next to the gap and filled the space between with concrete after digging it out.

Within a single 24-hour period in October 2005, a fleet of 30 concrete trucks made 600 trips to pour of concrete, and thus create a concrete &quot;mat&quot;. The mat serves as the base of the building, from which its spine rises. Those involved with the construction referred to the day as the &quot;Big Pour&quot;. James McHugh Construction Co. was contracted for the concrete work on this job. They obtained the concrete from the Chicago Avenue and Halsted Street distribution site of Prairie Material Sales Inc of Bridgeview, Illinois, the former largest privately owned ready-mix concrete company in the United States. Prairie used a formula of concrete that had never been used in the construction business to meet a specification, which exceeded the standard for conventional concrete.

===Legal issues===
In October 2006, controversy erupted over a street kiosk at the foot of the Magnificent Mile in front of the Wrigley Building at 410 North Michigan Avenue that advertised Trump Tower a full block away. Extensive debate and publicity occurred on the issue of whether such advertising should have been allowed. Two distinct pieces of legislation in 2002 and 2003 by the Chicago City Council had authorized the kiosk, but sidewalk billboards were not common in Chicago at the time, and their desirability was questioned. Although there were demands from citizens&#x27; organizations and the local Alderman Burton Natarus (who had voted in favor of the legislation) to remove the kiosk, Trump agreed only to remove pricing information from the signage, after a request to remove all advertising from it. Originally, one side displayed the geographical information and the other side functioned as a billboard.

In a separate legal development, Donald Trump was sued by former &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; publisher F. David Radler and his daughters in February 2008 for rescinding all &quot;friends and family&quot; condominium purchases, including Radler&#x27;s. As president of the &quot;Sun-Times&quot;″ holding company, Radler had negotiated the sale of the paper&#x27;s headquarters building to Trump&#x27;s consortium. The price of Radler&#x27;s condo had been discounted by 10%, and only a 5% deposit was required instead of the standard 15%. Radler and family were part of a group of 40 insiders who were able to purchase property at about . When the market value of the property eventually rose to over , Trump nullified the &quot;friends and family&quot; sales. The insiders were involved in the planning and designing of the building. In January 2007, Trump cited both a clause about &quot;matters beyond [the] seller&#x27;s reasonable control&quot; and the desire to &quot;have more income to handle potentially higher construction costs&quot;. Despite Trump&#x27;s concerns about higher construction costs, earlier in the same month, Ivanka Trump, his daughter, an executive of the company, had stated that the construction was $50 million under budget. In addition to the Radler suit over the validity of the &quot;friends and family&quot; discount contracts, a group of four owners sued over revisions to the closing terms, which placed limits on the owner occupancy of condo hotel units and excluded the meeting rooms and ballrooms from the common elements of which the owners have an interest.
In an additional legal issue, on February 8, 2005, Trump had closed on a construction loan of $640 million from Deutsche Bank for the project. He also obtained a $130–135 million junior mezzanine loan from another syndicate headed by Fortress Investment Group. As part of these contracts, Trump had included a $40 million personal guarantee. The contracts also mandated partial repayments for each closed unit sale, and minimum sale prices. In September 2008, due to slow unit sales, Trump sought to extend both loans until mid-2009 because he felt that it was necessary in the business environment and expected from the outset of the contract. On November 10, Deutsche Bank demanded the outstanding loan payment and the $40 million guarantee. Trump filed suit later that month against Deutsche Bank in New York State Supreme Court in an effort to excuse a repayment of more than $330 million that had been due November 7, and to extend the construction loan for an unspecified period of time because of extenuating circumstances during the 2007–2008 financial crisis. Trump cited a &quot;force majeure&quot; clause that allowed the borrower to delay completion of the project under a catch-all section covering &quot;any other event or circumstance not within the reasonable control of the borrower&quot;. Trump not only sought an extension, but sought damages of $3 billion from the bank for its use of predatory lending practices to undermine the project and damage his reputation, which he claimed &quot;is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations.&quot; At the end of November, Deutsche Bank countersued Trump to force him to uphold his personal payment guarantee from February 2005, after he failed to repay the amount due November 7—a date that already had been extended. The suits did not interfere with Trump&#x27;s ability to continue drawing on the credit line provided by Deutsche Bank, because without the project&#x27;s continued financing, Deutsche Bank may have had to assume the role of developer. In March 2009, both parties agreed to suspend litigation and resolve the disagreement amicably in an effort to help the project to succeed. In September 2010, an amended loan agreement stopped the litigation and extended the term on an approximately $600 million construction loan for five years.

===Construction===

Bill Rancic, &quot;The Apprentice&quot;&#x27;s season-one winner in 2004, was originally hired to manage the project for a $250,000 salary. Rancic&#x27;s title was President of the Trump International Hotel and Tower, but the title was somewhat misleading, because he was in fact learning on the job as an &quot;Apprentice.&quot; Rancic&#x27;s contract was renewed after his first year, but in September 2005, it appeared that his employment with Trump would finish at the end of his second year in April 2006. During 2005, Donald Trump Jr., who had been involved in the building since its earliest stages in 1999, was overseeing the construction with weekly visits, while Rancic worked on sales and marketing. In December 2005, Rancic made it clear that he wanted to continue working for Trump, and in April 2006, his contract was renewed for a third year. In that year Donald Trump&#x27;s children began to assume prominent public roles as in the Trump Organization; by January 2007, all three adult Trump children (Ivanka Trump, Donald Trump Jr., and Eric Trump) were executives in the acquisitions and development division of the organization. By the time the Chicago Trump Tower&#x27;s hotel opened in the building in January 2008, Donald Trump and his three adult children were in the spotlight, overseeing the construction.

Bovis Lend Lease, noted for work on Disneyland Paris, the Petronas Towers, and the Deutsche Bank Center, was the construction company. James McHugh Construction Co, the concrete subcontractor, implemented a comprehensive formwork for the construction of the building. At the completion of construction the building was the tallest formwork structure in the world, and follows in the footsteps of its neighbor, Marina City, as well as Chicago&#x27;s Two Prudential Plaza, as past recordholders. Concrete moulding was used, because using a traditional ironwork structure would have required a building footprint that would have been too big for the property size, proportional to the height of the designed building. A steel frame would have had to be wider to have supported a building of this proportion. Concrete will counteract the force of wind with the force of gravity of the building. A new chemical process that leveraged more fluid liquid concrete facilitated pumping concrete up several hundred feet to the elevating construction site. Although previous technology limited formwork to , this technology permitted the pumping of concrete high.

The building is cantilevered into a section of 420 million-year-old limestone bedrock underground. It uses -wide stilt-like pillars that were drilled beneath the building. Every around its perimeter, steel-reinforced concrete was poured into these holes to form the structural support. On top of these caisson shafts and pillars, an concrete pad foundation was built to support the building&#x27;s spine. The building has 241 caissons, and the majority of the caissons only descend into hard clay. However, 57 of them go an additional into the ground, including of bedrock. The concrete spine uses five I-beam-shaped walls and exterior columns, narrowing to two as the building rises. Each floor is separated by a concrete slab, and stainless steel, glass, and aluminum panels are attached to each floor. of reinforcing steel bars, called rebar, support the hotel. The extensive use of concrete makes the building more fireproof. Of the $600 million construction budget, $130 million was earmarked for the James McHugh Construction Co, who handled the concrete-only portion of the job.
Two earlier business decisions by the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; led to substantial savings of time and money during the Trump Tower&#x27;s construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus did not have to be broken down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.

On August 16, 2008, construction crews made the last major concrete pour to top off the Trump tower&#x27;s concrete core, which was commemorated with an unofficial ceremony. To celebrate the milestone, a yellow tower crane raised a bucket full of concrete and an American flag to the rooftop of the skyscraper. Another ceremony occurred on August 19, when construction supervisors, structural engineers and company representatives from McHugh Construction made a minor concrete pour at the top of the Trump tower. Although Donald Trump was absent from both of these ceremonies, he, Donald Jr., Ivanka and Eric Trump attended the topping off party on September 24, 2008. Original plans called for the windows to be completed and the spire erected in October 2008. However, the spire installation was delayed through high winds in December 2008, and was finally completed on January 3, 2009. Kamin&#x27;s critical opinion is that the spire is not aesthetically complementary.

At the September 2008 topping off ceremony, Donald Trump marketed his hotel by expressing doubts about the Chicago Spire ever being completed due to the Great Recession. However, Donald Trump Jr. said that they were fortunate to complete the project, while the Spire and Waterview Tower were among developments affected by the Great Recession. Occupancy had begun on lower-floor condominiums at the time of the ceremony.

Residents of the Trump building are zoned to Chicago Public Schools, more specifically to Ogden School and Wells Community Academy High School.

==After opening==

===Residential unit sales===

Trump&#x27;s hotel was 25% unsold at the time of the 2008 topping off ceremony, and was expected to need the mid-2009 construction loan extension that has caused legal complications. This was partially due to the subprime mortgage crisis, which disrupted condominium sales. Trump had sold all but 36 of the building&#x27;s 486 residential condos at the end of 2012, and 15 remained unsold at the end of 2013. By May 15, 2014, only six units remained for sale including three that were used as the sales center and sales models.

===Notable residents===
Several local celebrities purchased units in the building, including numerous professional athletes and artists. Juwan Howard, Rex Grossman, Patrick Kane and R. Kelly were among the purchasers of Trump properties. Derrick Rose purchased a $2.8 million condo in spring 2012. Other prominent purchasers of units included McDonald&#x27;s Chief Executive and President Don Thompson and WMAQ-TV (NBC 5 Chicago) president and general manager David Doebler. United Airlines CEO Jeff Smisek and Huron Consulting Group CEO James Roth also purchased properties in the building.

Two units on the 87th and 88th floors sold for prices in excess of $5 million in 2009 directly from the developer. After a few soft years in the real estate market, it took until August 2014, for units to sell for prices in excess of $1000 per square foot. Two units sold for over $3 million that month including a $3.99 million sale, which was the highest sale price in the building since 2009. The penthouse sold for $17 million in late 2014 to Sanjay Shah, founder and CEO of Vistex.

In May 2016, a one-bedroom unit with a parking space became the first listed Chicago one-bedroom unit to fetch over $1,100-a-square-foot when Mark and Deborah Hellman moved their interests from a one-bedroom to a two-bedroom unit in the building. Overall, however, real estate observers noticed a slowdown in Trump Tower sales due to the controversial nature of the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign: prospective buyers who were happy with the actual tower residences were unsure they wanted to be associated with the Trump name.

===Floods in 2014===
In February, after one round of drink service, three men were denied further service at Sixteen due to their apparent intoxication; as a payback, the three pulled what was intended to be a prank. They set off fire alarms and opened a fifth-floor stairwell Chicago Fire Department standpipe valve and flooded elevator shafts with thousands of gallons of water, damaging woodwork, electrical circuitry and marble. The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.

On June 26, a pipe burst near the west public parking entrance, causing the first floor of the tower to flood.

===Environmental lawsuit===

In June 2018, through the Abrams Environmental Law Clinic at the University of Chicago, the Illinois Chapter of the Sierra Club and Friends of the Chicago River provided notice of their intent to sue the Chicago Trump International Hotel and Tower over violations of the Clean Water Act, alleging an illegal operation of a cooling water intake structure that siphons water from the Chicago River and likely traps and kills fish and other wildlife. In August 2018, Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan filed suit in the Circuit Court of Cook County alleging that though Trump Tower&#x27;s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit expired on August 31, 2017, it continued to release almost of water it uses for cooling into the river each day. In February 2021, a judge ruled that the building&#x27;s management had violated state environmental laws by operating the water intake without a permit and without filing plans detailing how they would minimize the environmental impact.

Madigan&#x27;s successor Kwame Raoul sued the Trump Organization again in September 2023, alleging the tower continued to take in river water without a valid permit. The Sierra Club and Friends of the Chicago River also filed a renewed complaint that claimed the tower&#x27;s river intake had been underestimated by 44% in official filings.

On September 9, 2024, Cook County Circuit Court Judge Thaddeus L. Wilson ruled that the Trump Tower&#x27;s intake system violates state environmental laws that protect the Chicago River, by creating and operating &quot;a public nuisance in violation of Illinois law&quot;.

===Incidents===
On Sunday, October 18, 2020, at around 5:30 PM (CDT), an unidentified man in his 20s suspended himself from a landing located on the 16th floor and hung down the side of the skyscraper facing the Chicago River for more than thirteen hours. While hanging from the side of the skyscraper, the man filmed a video that was live-streamed on to social media. In the video he was shown hanging from an orange rope, holding a knife in his left hand; he said that if anyone attempted to pull him up using the rope, he would cut it and fall to his death. He then demanded to speak to U.S. President Donald Trump and acknowledged the hard work of the Mayor Lori Lightfoot and Chicago emergency services during the COVID-19 pandemic. He continued by saying that he wanted to speak to the media and he goes on to say that he is not a crazy person. He ends the video by again saying that he wants to speak to the media. Chicago police peacefully resolved the situation with no injuries on Monday, October 19, 2020, at around 6:30 AM (CDT) by negotiating with the suspect. The man was pulled up by several police officers and was taken into custody.

=== Tax deductions ===

In 2024, &quot;The New York Times&quot; and ProPublica reported that the Internal Revenue Service investigated whether Trump had twice written off losses through construction cost overruns, lagging sales, and selling residential units below value. In his 2008 tax return, he declared the property to be worthless. The two publications calculated that — of the total deduction of $697 million Trump claimed that year — up to $651 million were based on the property&#x27;s worthlessness. In 2010, he passed ownership of the property from one of his business entities to another one and claimed another $168 million for the next 10 years. The publications, &quot;in consultation with tax experts, calculated that the revision sought by the IRS would create a new tax bill of more than $100 million, plus interest and potential penalties&quot;.

==In popular culture==
In 2004, a top job at the tower, under the tutelage of Trump, was the prize for the winner of the first season of Trump&#x27;s reality-TV show &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.
The final confrontation between Batman and the Joker in the film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; was shot in the Summer of 2007 at the very top of the construction site of the then partially completed tower.

The building&#x27;s planning and redesign led to publicity in local and national media both before and during its construction. For example, on September 19, 2007, the Trump International Hotel and Tower was featured on an episode of the Discovery Channel series &quot;Build It Bigger&quot; titled &quot;High Risk Tower&quot;.

When Fox News Channel embarked on its month-long six-city tour to celebrate its 15th anniversary, Neil Cavuto broadcast the network&#x27;s one-hour &quot;Your World with Neil Cavuto&quot; show from the riverwalk at the Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower on October 3, 2011.

The tower was also one of the key locations filmed in Chicago for the 2011 film &quot;&quot;.

The building, as well as its address &quot;N Michigan Av / E Wacker Dr&quot;, feature prominently in the opening of the TV series &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot;, created by David E. Kelley and aired by CBS during the 2013–2014 season. It is implied that the offices of the fictional advertising firm that is the topic of the series, Lewis, Roberts &amp; Roberts, is inside the building.

<text>Vladimír Železný (born 3 March 1945) is a Czech businessman and politician. He was the first CEO of TV NOVA, a popular Czech television station and was a member of the European Parliament between 2004 and 2009. As a media mogul with political influence, he has been compared to Rupert Murdoch and Silvio Berlusconi. He was convicted of tax evasion in 2007.

==Early life and media career==
Born to a Jewish family, Železný made headlines in 1968, at the age of 23, when he broadcast in defiance of orders pictures of Russian tanks driving through Prague during the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia.

In 1993 he applied with five others for a license to broadcast a private television channel to show classical music, cultural programmes and current affairs. He obtained a €140m investment from the American firm, Central European Media Enterprises (CME) to fund the enterprise. Due to the Czech Media Council&#x27;s rules against foreign ownership, the license was granted to a company controlled by Železný - CET21 - which, with the legal assistance of Miroslav Šipovič signed a licensing agreement with a joint venture partly owned by CME. In February 1994 he launched TV NOVA which became the most popular network, although it was criticised as undermining the cultural tradition of Czechs.

In 1999 CET21 terminated the licensing agreement, effectively seizing control of the station and making CME&#x27;s investment worthless. Subsequently, some 20 suits started in front of the Czech courts and international tribunals. While the CME (at the time incorporated in Netherlands and controlled by American national Ronald Lauder) started UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings against the Czech Republic (in Stockholm) under the Bilateral investment treaty between the Czech Republic and Netherlands, Ronald Lauder himself started UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings against the Czech Republic (in London) under the Bilateral investment treaty between the Czech Republic and the United States. While the London tribunal dismissed the claim by Lauder, the Stockholm tribunal, effectively dealing with the same issue, found the Czech Republic liable for not protecting the CME&#x27;s investment in the Czech Republic and awarded CME damages of $270 million, which were eventually paid from taxpayers&#x27; money. Under a different arbitration award, Železný was to pay damages of $23 million. CME also eventually regained control of the channel.

From November 2013 to March 2014 he was the CEO of TV Barrandov.

==Political career==
In 2002, Železný was elected to the Czech Senate for the Znojmo circuit. Analysts said he selected the seat based on the high ratings of TV Nova and high rates of unemployment and said he was &quot;&quot;widely suspected&quot; of seeking election only to secure parliamentary immunity.

In 2004 he was elected to the European Parliament. He founded the Independent Democrats (&quot;Nezávislí demokraté&quot;) in 2005 and was elected its chairman. In 2006 he unsuccessfully sought election to the Chamber of Deputies.

In 2008 he told Prague Radio he was a &quot;fierce eurosceptic&quot; and said the European Union was &quot;an over-regulated environment which strongly resembles what we know from our communist past&quot;&quot; In 2009 he launched Libertas.cz.

==Criminal activities==
He was suspected of selling property and making a speculative agreement with a Liechtenstein company to avoid paying his debt to CME. Later he was freed of the charges.

In 2001 he was publicly arrested and charged with tax evasion and defrauding creditors in connection with the Nova company. In 2003 the Senate voted to lift his immunity to allow the police to investigate and in 2005 the European Parliament followed suit. Later he was freed of the charges. In 2007 he was found guilty of tax evasion in connection to paintings he had imported in 1998, fined €250,000 and given a two-year suspended jail sentence with a two-year probation. The verdict was later upheld by the High Court in Prague.

<text>The New England Conservatory of Music (NEC) is a private music school in Boston, Massachusetts. The conservatory is located on Huntington Avenue along the Avenue of the Arts near Boston Symphony Hall, and is home to approximately 750 students pursuing undergraduate and graduate studies, and 1,500 more in its Preparatory School and School of Continuing Education. NEC offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in instrumental and vocal classical music performance, contemporary musical arts, composition, jazz studies, music history, and music theory, as well as graduate degrees in collaborative piano, conducting, and musicology. The conservatory has also partnered with Harvard University and Tufts University to create joint double-degree, five-year programs.

The faculty and alumni of New England Conservatory comprise nearly fifty percent of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, including 6 members of l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, 14 Rome Prize recipients, 51 Guggenheim Fellows, and prizewinners at nearly every major respected music forum in the world. As of January 2020, 11 MacArthur Fellows have also been affiliated as faculty or alumni.

==History and leadership==
=== Founding an American conservatory (1867) ===
In June 1853, a nineteen-year-old music teacher from Providence, Rhode Island named Eben Tourjée made his first attempt to found a music conservatory in Boston, Massachusetts. He met with a group of Boston&#x27;s most influential musical leaders to discuss the foundation of a school based on popular and well-established European conservatories. Among the voices in the discussion were John Sullivan Dwight, an influential music critic; Dr. J. Baxter Upham, president of the Harvard Musical Association; and Oliver Ditson, a prominent music publisher. The group initially rejected Tourjée&#x27;s plans, arguing that it was a poor idea to open a conservatory amidst the nation&#x27;s current political and economic uncertainty, which would ultimately lead to the American Civil War.

It wasn&#x27;t until the Civil War subsided that Tourjée made his next attempt to establish a school in Boston. In December 1866, he again met with a group of Boston&#x27;s top musicians and music patrons. Joining the former attendees Upham, Dwight, and Ditson were Carl Zerrahn and Charles Perkins. In the thirteen-year interim, Tourjée had gained both experience and success in founding three music schools in Rhode Island, and this time was able to convince his audience of the persisting need and demand for such institutions. The men agreed to support Tourjée, and The New England Conservatory—then consisting of just seven rented rooms above the Boston Music Hall off Tremont Street—officially opened on February 18, 1867. At the turn of the century, the original building was converted into a vaudeville theater called the Orpheum Theater, which still stands today.

=== Early history (1868–1900) ===
Tourjée continued establishing his public presence within the musical community in Boston by initiating the first national conference of music teachers, which met in Boston as the National Music Congress in 1869. Under the direction of Patrick Gilmore, he was also selected as one of the organizers behind Boston&#x27;s National Peace Jubilee. That same year, he assembled and rehearsed a chorus of over 10,000 that performed in present-day Copley Square to celebrate the end of the Civil War. Three years later at the World&#x27;s Peace Jubilee, which he also co-organized under Gilmore, the size of his chorus was doubled.

Similarly, New England Conservatory was also establishing itself as a pioneering institution even in its infancy. It was the first school in the United States to offer a course in public school music, and one of the faculty members who taught that course, Luther Whiting Mason, was the first to introduce music into Boston Public Schools. At the request of the Japanese government, Mason traveled to the country from 1879 to 1882 to introduce western music education to Japanese schools. In Japan, this system came to be known as the &quot;Mason-song&quot; system.

By the end of 1868, the conservatory had grown from its original seven rooms to twenty-five, with 1,212 students enrolled. Meanwhile, Tourjée established an affiliation with Boston University in hopes of providing a more comprehensive collegiate education for musicians. He eventually took on the role of Dean at the university, holding the position until his death in 1891.

By 1882, NEC had outgrown the rooms in the Boston Music Hall and moved operations to the St. James Hotel in Franklin Square in Boston&#x27;s South End. The large building functioned as both an academic facility and a residence hall for female students. Even though St. James Hotel provided many amenities the Music Hall had been lacking, it still desperately needed a recital hall. So in 1884, the conservatory purchased land adjacent to the hotel and, almost immediately, construction began on a new recital hall. Through substantial contributions from wealthy trustees, including Jacob Sleeper, the new hall was rushed to completion and Sleeper Hall opened on January 13, 1886. The hall was rapidly put to heavy use, with 109 classical music concerts and hundreds of student recitals performed in the first year.

As the conservatory grew, so did its ties to musical life in Boston. When Henry Higginson founded the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1881, he called on 19 members of NEC faculty to serve as section leaders. The close ties between these historic institutions continue today.

=== 20th century ===

By the turn of the century, NEC had come under the leadership of George W. Chadwick, a well-known composer who had been on the faculty since 1882. During his tenure, the foundation was laid that shaped NEC&#x27;s identity for the whole of the 20th century. Chadwick again recognized the need for a new facility and selected a location on Huntington Ave, which was quickly becoming a cultural center of Boston with the recently-built Symphony Hall one block away. Once again through the generosity of its trustees, namely Eben Dryer Jordan Jr., another plot of land was purchased and, in 1901, construction began on a new concert hall at 290 Huntington Ave. The Jordan Hall building opened for students beginning in 1902, but the official inauguration of the concert hall took place on October 20, 1903, with a grand performance by the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

In addition, Chadwick assembled the first complete orchestral ensemble and established the first opera program at NEC. Chadwick ultimately shifted the focus of NEC&#x27;s curriculum from casual music students interested in occasional lessons or courses to prioritizing students who wished to earn college diplomas and, beginning in 1926, baccalaureate degrees.

Like most academic institutions in the 1930s and early 1940s, NEC saw a decline in enrollment throughout the Great Depression and the closely following events of World War II. But by 1946, enrollment had doubled to over 2,300 students, with fifty percent of those degree candidates enrolled through the G.I. Bill to earn their college degrees following service in WWII.

Through the 1950s, the school once again began redefining itself under the leadership of president Harrison Keller. He minimized the original diploma program by encouraging students to enroll into degree programs instead—which, by this time, had also expanded to include master&#x27;s degree programs. Keller also established an academic studies department and developed a full four-year theory curriculum. In addition, the Artist Diploma program was initiated for a small number of highly gifted performers. Keller later founded the Department of Music for Young People, the precursor to NEC&#x27;s present-day Preparatory School, and also oversaw construction of a new dormitory which opened in 1960.

In 1967, composer, conductor, and author Gunther Schuller was selected President of NEC, just as the school was celebrating its centennial. Like Chadwick, Schuller was a transformational leader for the conservatory. In 1969, he established the first fully-accredited jazz degree program in the United States and, a few years later, introduced &quot;Third Stream&quot; studies into the curriculum. &quot;Third Stream&quot; was the term coined by Schuller to describe the synthesis of jazz and classical music. Eventually, it gained its own department and degree program, first renamed Contemporary Improvisation, and renamed again in 2022 to Contemporary Musical Arts (CMA). The CMA department incorporates a wide variety of global and ethnic musical traditions, aural traditions, and improvisation into the conservatory&#x27;s traditionally classical roots. Schuller also helped to renew interest in another style of American music: ragtime. He formed the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble in 1971. Additional changes to the curriculum included a new program in early musical performance, as well as an overhaul of the music education department. Finally, Schuller expanded local outreach into the community by creating the Community Services department, known today as the Community Performances and Partnerships department.

From 1983 to 1996, NEC was headed by renowned cellist and longtime faculty member Laurence Lesser. During his tenure, the campus expanded with the purchase of two additional buildings for classrooms and administrative offices. Lesser shepherded a major capital campaign to fund the 1994–95 restoration of Jordan Hall, and instituted the Doctorate of Musical Arts (DMA) degree along with a considerable number of additional graduate school offerings.
=== 21st century ===
Daniel Steiner, a former member of the board of trustees, served as the conservatory&#x27;s only president who was not also a musician. During his tenure from 1999 to 2006, his goal was to &quot;make NEC a top school in its field like MIT and Harvard.&quot; Toward that end, Steiner established a joint-degree program with Harvard and a chamber music training program, boosted financial aid resources, and hired prominent faculty members to attract more applicants. Both the size and reputation of NEC saw a substantial increase, and Steiner raised $72 million over the last three years of his presidency.

In 2007, Tony Woodcock took the helm and served as NEC&#x27;s president until 2015. He instituted both of the programs for Sistema Fellows and Entrepreneurial Musicianship, and ended his tenure with the groundbreaking for the Student Life and Performance Center (SLPC), the school&#x27;s first new building since 1960.

In January 2019, Andrea Kalyn became NEC&#x27;s 17th and first female president. Demonstrating an immediate commitment to expanding diversity initiatives, Kalyn &quot;founded the Center for Cultural Equity and Belonging (CEB) to shape, support, and advance institutional practices relative to equity, diversity, inclusion, and belonging.&quot;

==Campus==

Today, the NEC campus consists of four buildings along both sides of Gainsborough Street, between St. Botolph Street and Huntington Avenue.

Unofficially called &quot;the Jordan Hall Building,&quot; NEC&#x27;s main building is home to Jordan Hall and three smaller performance spaces: Williams Hall, Brown Hall, and the Keller Room; the Performance Library; faculty offices and teaching studios; and student practice rooms. At 33 Gainsborough sits the former Residence Hall, which is now commonly known as &quot;33 G&quot; for its location on Gainsborough Street. This building primarily houses administrative departments, the copy/mail center, the store Music Espresso, and additional practice rooms. The &quot;St. Botolph Building&quot; at 241 St. Botolph Street contains Pierce Hall, along with the majority of the school&#x27;s classrooms and administrative offices. NEC&#x27;s newest building, the Student Life and Performance Center (SLPC), opened in 2017 and now serves as the NEC Residence Hall. It is also home to the Green Room Café and Speed Dining Commons; the Blumenthal Family Library; the Burnes Hall and Eben Jordan Ensemble Room rehearsal spaces; the Elfers Commons; and the Plimpton Shattuck Black Box Theater, designed specifically for opera performances.
===Jordan Hall===
Jordan Hall is NEC&#x27;s central and most famous performing space. Officially opened in 1903, Jordan Hall was the gift of trustee Eben D. Jordan Jr., son of the co-founder of the Jordan Marsh retail stores and himself an amateur musician.

The dedication concert of Jordan Hall, performed by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, took place on October 20, 1903. Newspaper accounts deemed the hall &quot;unequaled the world over,&quot; and &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that it was &quot;a place of entertainment that European musicians who were present that evening say excels in beauty anything of the kind they ever saw.&quot;

A major renovation to the performance space was completed in 1995.

==Academics==
Admission to NEC can be rigorous and is based primarily on a pre-screening recorded video audition followed by a competitive live audition. The conservatory offers degrees in orchestral instruments, conducting, piano, jazz studies, contemporary musical arts, opera and vocal performance and pedagogy, composition, music history, and music theory. NEC also offers minors in Liberal Arts and Music Theory, as well as a concentration in Music Technology.

=== Artist diploma ===
The artist diploma (AD) is the highest-level performance designation offered at NEC. The program is extremely selective with only a small number of applicants admitted to the program each year. The AD program typically lasts two years, and students are awarded a full-tuition scholarship and a living stipend for both years of the program, and they are often featured in special performances and events.

=== Doctoral programs ===
The Doctor of Musical Arts degree (DMA) is a rigorous and selective program intended for performer-scholars who combine the highest standards in their major area with proven accomplishments in research and scholarship. It is designed to provide professional musicians with the necessary knowledge and skills for artistic, cultural, social, and educational leadership.

The DMA degree is offered in all areas of solo performance, composition, collaborative piano, chamber music for piano, conducting, jazz performance and composition, contemporary musical arts, and music theory. NEC enrolls a small class of 8–12 students each year to ensure the highest degree of flexibility and individual attention.

=== Dual-degree programs ===
The conservatory offers five-year joint double-degree programs with Harvard University and Tufts University. These programs allow students who have dual passions in both music and another field to have access to the world&#x27;s best resources for both pursuits.

==== Tufts/NEC ====
The Tufts/NEC allows highly motivated students to receive a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science degree from the School of Arts and Sciences at Tufts and a Bachelor of Music degree from NEC over 5 years of study, immersing students in intensive studies in liberal arts, music theory, and musicianship, along with weekly lessons and ensembles. Admission to the Tufts/NEC program is highly selective as Tufts and NEC make their initial admission decisions separately, then NEC makes a second level of admission for the dual-degree program itself.

==== Harvard/NEC ====
Students in the Harvard/NEC dual-degree program receive a Bachelor of Arts from Harvard and a Master of Music from NEC over 5 years of study. For the first 4 years, students pursue the typical Bachelor of Arts curriculum in their concentration (major) and take weekly studio instruction at NEC. Students begin their Master of Music coursework during their 4th year and complete their 5th year entire at NEC. Students must be admitted independently to both institutions before receiving an additional decision for admission to the dual-degree.

=== Preparatory School ===

New England Conservatory&#x27;s Preparatory School is an open-enrollment institution for pre-college students, with over 225 faculty members and 1,300 students ages 0–18. NEC Prep offers private lessons, theory and composition courses, chamber music, and over 35 small and large ensembles of varying levels. Additionally, NEC Prep offers courses, ensembles, and lessons in jazz and Baroque music styles. Early Childhood Music Education, including Eurhythmics and Suzuki Strings for violin, viola, and cello, is available for younger students, ages 0–6, to increase exposure to music in general from an early age and build foundational practices for beginners on string instruments.

Students enrolled in NEC Prep may participate in the Certificate Program, allowing students to achieve their optimum performance skills and demonstrate competence in music theory, literature, and solo repertoire. Multiple certificate levels are offered for each instrumental and vocal area for students to progress through with each subsequent year of attendance.

Large ensemble programming includes four full orchestras, five string orchestras, three wind ensembles, Youth Jazz Orchestra, Youth Brass Ensemble, and three Choral groups. NEC Prep is home to the Youth Philharmonic Orchestra (YPO), the most selective of the large ensembles, as well as the Youth Symphony (YS). All large ensembles perform at least twice each year in NEC&#x27;s Jordan Hall. YPO, YS, and the Sr. Massachusetts Youth Wind Ensemble are touring ensembles whose recent tour destinations included Iceland, Ireland, Norway, and Spain, Italy and Central Europe.

The Contemporary Music Festival, hosted in the Spring semesters, encourages students to explore new music in an intensive setting and learn contemporary performance practice. Every year, the festival hosts a composer-in-residence who engages with the community in a variety of ways, including visiting classes, working with small and large ensembles, and leading masterclasses. NEC Prep student compositions are performed throughout the festival, sometimes in readings with one of the orchestras. Past Composers-in-Residence include the founding member and artistic director of ETHEL, Ralph Farris (2018), Pulitzer Prize Winner and MacArthur Fellow recipient, John Harbison (2015), and British Composer and former Master of the Queen&#x27;s Music, Judith Weir (2014). NEC Prep will be welcoming Valerie Coleman as the 2023 Contemporary Music Festival Composer-in-Residence in February 2023.

NEC Prep hosts the Summer Orchestra Institute (SOI), a two-week full symphony orchestra program open to intermediate through advanced-level strings, brass, winds, and percussion students between the ages of 13 and 18. Program activities include full orchestral rehearsals, sectional rehearsals, chamber music reading/coaching sessions, masterclasses, workshops, mock auditions, individual practice time, and two concerts in Jordan Hall.

== Demographics and diversity ==

NEC has always accepted students regardless of their race. The first African American to receive a diploma from NEC was Rachel M. Washington, who earned a diploma in voice in 1872. Puerto-Rican pianist Jesus Maria Sanroma received his diploma from NEC in 1920, while the first Black students to earn bachelor&#x27;s degrees were Anna Bobbitt (Gardner) and Luther Fuller, both in 1932.

Some of NEC&#x27;s most famous African American alumni include Florence Price, Coretta Scott King, J. Rosamond Johnson, Cecil Taylor, D. Antoinette Handy, McHenry Boatwright, Buckner Gamby, and Denyce Graves. NEC&#x27;s Black faculty members have included talents such as Jaki Byard, George Russell, Geri Allen, and Carl Atkins.

NEC also has a long history of awarding honorary degrees to many significant artists, such as Roland Hayes (1961), Marian Anderson (1964), Shinichi Suzuki (1966), Coretta Scott King (1971), William Grant Still (1973), Seiji Ozawa (1982), Miles Davis (1986), John Birks &quot;Dizzy&quot; Gillespie (1991), Ravi Shankar (1993), Aretha Franklin (1997), Ali Akbar Khan (2000), Jose Antonio Abreu (2002), Halim El-Dabh (2007), Quincy Jones (2010), Kyung Wha Chun (2015), Sofia Gubaidulina (2017), Herbie Hancock (2018), Chou Wen-chung (2019), Jessye Norman (2019), Mavis Staples (2021), Wu Man (2021), and Ella Jenkins (2022).

==Nomenclature==
Although the institution is known today as New England Conservatory, both the National Historic Landmark and the National Register of Historic Places nominations designate &quot;New England Conservatory of Music&quot; as the name listed in these registries. Both registries list NEC&#x27;s primary building, which includes Jordan Hall, as a place of historic significance.

<text>Mit brennender Sorge ( , in English &quot;With deep [lit. &#x27;burning&#x27;] anxiety&quot;) is an encyclical of Pope Pius XI, issued during the Nazi era on 10 March 1937 (but bearing a date of Passion Sunday, 14 March). Written in German, not the usual Latin, it was smuggled into Germany for fear of censorship and was read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches on one of the Church&#x27;s busiest Sundays, Palm Sunday (21 March that year).

The encyclical condemned breaches of the 1933 &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; agreement signed between the German Reich and the Holy See. It condemned &quot;pantheistic confusion&quot;, &quot;neopaganism&quot;, &quot;the so-called myth of race and blood&quot;, and the idolizing of the State. It contained a vigorous defense of the Old Testament with the belief that it prepares the way for the New. The encyclical states that race is a fundamental value of the human community, which is necessary and honorable but condemns the exaltation of race, or the people, or the state, above their standard value to an idolatrous level. The encyclical declares &quot;that man as a person possesses rights he holds from God, and which any collectivity must protect against denial, suppression or neglect.&quot; National Socialism, Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party are not named in the document. The term &quot;Reichsregierung&quot; is used to refer to the German government.

The effort to produce and distribute over 300,000 copies of the letter was entirely secret, allowing priests across Germany to read the letter without interference. The Gestapo raided the churches the next day to confiscate all the copies they could find, and the presses that had printed the letter were closed. According to historian Ian Kershaw, an intensification of the general anti-church struggle began around April in response to the encyclical. Klaus Scholder wrote: &quot;state officials and the Party reacted with anger and disapproval. Nevertheless the great reprisal that was feared did not come. The concordat remained in force and despite everything the intensification of the battle against the two churches which then began remained within ordinary limits.&quot; The regime further constrained the actions of the Church and harassed monks with staged prosecutions for alleged immorality and phony abuse trials. Though Hitler is not named in the encyclical, the German text does refer to a &quot;Wahnprophet&quot;, which some have interpreted as meaning &quot;mad prophet&quot; and as referring to Hitler himself.

It was reported at the time that the encyclical was paired and somewhat overshadowed by the anti-communist encyclical &quot;Divini Redemptoris&quot; of 19 March, in order to avoid the charge that the Pope was indirectly favoring communism.

== Background ==
Following the Nazi takeover, the Catholic Church hierarchy in Germany initially attempted to co-operate with the new government, but by 1937 had become highly disillusioned. A threatening, though initially mainly sporadic persecution of the Catholic Church followed the Nazi takeover. Hitler moved quickly to eliminate Political Catholicism. Two thousand functionaries of the Bavarian People&#x27;s Party were rounded up by police in late June 1933. They along with the national Catholic Centre Party, ceased to exist in early July, as the Nazi Party became the only legally permitted party in the country. Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen meanwhile negotiated the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; treaty with the Vatican, which prohibited clergy from participating in politics. Kershaw wrote that the Vatican was anxious to reach agreement with the new government, despite &quot;continuing molestation of Catholic clergy, and other outrages committed by Nazi radicals against the Church and its organisations&quot;.

The &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; () was signed on 20 July 1933 between the Holy See and Germany. According to historian Pinchas Lapide, the Nazis saw the treaty as giving them moral legitimacy and prestige, whilst the Catholic Church sought to protect itself from persecution through a signed agreement. According to Guenter Lewy, a common view within Church circles at the time was that Nazism would not last long, and the favorable Concordat terms would outlive the current regime (the Concordat does remain in force today). A Church handbook published with the recommendation of the entire German Church episcopate described the Concordat as &quot;proof that two powers, totalitarian in their character, can find an agreement, if their domains are separate and if overlaps in jurisdiction become parallel or in a friendly manner lead them to make common cause&quot;. Lewy wrote &quot;The harmonious co-operation anticipated at the time did not quite materialize&quot; but that the reasons for this &quot;lay less in the lack of readiness of the Church than in the short sighted policies of the Hitler regime.&quot;

In &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot;, Pope Pius XI said that the Holy See had signed the Concordat &quot;in spite of many serious misgivings&quot; and in the hope it might &quot;safeguard the liberty of the church in her mission of salvation in Germany&quot;. The treaty comprised 34 articles and a supplementary protocol. Article 1 guaranteed &quot;freedom of profession and public practice of the Catholic religion&quot; and acknowledged the right of the church to regulate its own affairs. Within three months of the signing of the document, Cardinal Bertram, head of the German Catholic Bishops Conference, was writing in a pastoral letter of &quot;grievous and gnawing anxiety&quot; with regard to the government&#x27;s actions towards Catholic organisations, charitable institutions, youth groups, press, Catholic Action, and the mistreatment of Catholics for their political beliefs. According to Paul O&#x27;Shea, Hitler had a &quot;blatant disregard&quot; for the Concordat, and its signing was to him merely a first step in the &quot;gradual suppression of the Catholic Church in Germany&quot;. Anton Gill wrote that &quot;with his usual irresistible, bullying technique, Hitler then proceeded to take a mile where he had been given an inch&quot; and closed all Catholic institutions whose functions weren&#x27;t strictly religious:

Following the signing of the document, the formerly outspoken nature of opposition by German Catholic leaders towards the Nazi movement weakened considerably. But violations of the Concordat by the Nazis began almost immediately and were to continue such that Falconi described the Concordat with Germany as &quot;a complete failure&quot;. 

The Concordat, wrote William Shirer, &quot;was hardly put to paper before it was being broken by the Nazi Government&quot;. The Nazis had promulgated their sterilization law, an offensive policy in the eyes of the Catholic Church, on 14 July. On 30 July, moves began to dissolve the Catholic Youth League. Clergy, nuns and lay leaders were to be targeted, leading to thousands of arrests over the ensuing years, often on trumped-up charges of currency smuggling or &quot;immorality&quot;. Historian of the German Resistance Peter Hoffmann wrote that, following the Nazi takeover:

In August 1936 The German episcopate had asked Pius XI for an encyclical that would deal with the current situation of the Church in Germany. In November 1936 Hitler had a meeting with Cardinal Faulhaber during which he indicated that more pressure would be put on the Church unless it collaborated more zealously with the regime. On 21 December 1936 the Pope invited, via Cardinal Pacelli, senior members of the German episcopate to Rome. On 16 January 1937 five German prelates and Cardinal Pacelli agreed unanimously that the time had now come for public action by the Holy See. Pope Pius XI was gravely ill but he too was convinced of the need to publish an encyclical about the Church in Germany as soon as possible.

==Authorship==

A five-member commission drafted the encyclical. According to Paul O&#x27;Shea the carefully worded denunciation of aspects of Nazism was formulated between 16 and 21 January 1937, by Pius XI, Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII) and German cardinals Bertram, Faulhaber and Schulte, and Bishops Preysing and Galen. Cardinal Bertram of Breslau was the chairman of the German Conference of Bishops, and after the Nazi takeover he had favoured a non-confrontational approach toward the government and developed a protest system which &quot;satisfied the demands of the other bishops without annoying the regime&quot;. Berlin&#x27;s Bishop Konrad von Preysing had been one of the most consistent and outspoken critics of the Nazi regime to emerge from the German Church hierarchy. Munich&#x27;s Archbishop Michael von Faulhaber had been a staunch defender of Catholic rights. The conservative Bishop of Münster, Count Galen, would later distinguish himself by leading the Church&#x27;s protest against Nazi euthanasia.

Cardinal Faulhaber&#x27;s draft of the encyclical, consisting of eleven large single sheets and written in his own hand, was presented to Vatican Secretary of State Pacelli on 21 January. Falconi said that the encyclical &quot;was not so much an amplification of Faulhaber&#x27;s draft as a faithful and even literal transcription of it&quot; while &quot;Cardinal Pacelli, at Pius XI&#x27;s request, merely added a full historical introduction on the background of the Concordat with the Third Reich.&quot; According to John-Peter Pham, Pius XI credited the encyclical to Cardinal Pacelli. According to historian Frank J. Coppa, Cardinal Pacelli wrote a draft that the Pope thought was too weak and unfocused and therefore substituted a more critical analysis. Pacelli described the encyclical as &quot;a compromise&quot; between the Holy See&#x27;s sense that it could not be silent set against &quot;its fears and worries&quot;.

According to Dr. Robert A. Ventresca, professor at King&#x27;s University College at the University of Western Ontario, Cardinal Faulhaber, who wrote a first draft, was adamant that the encyclical should be careful in both its tone and substance and should avoid explicit reference to Nazism or the Nazi Party. Historian William Shirer wrote that the document accused the regime of sowing the &quot;tares of suspicion, discord, hatred, calumny, of secret and open fundamental hostility to Christ and His Church&quot;. According to Historian Klaus Scholder, the leader of the German Bishops conference, Cardinal Bertram, sought to blunt the impact of the encyclical by ordering that critical passages should not be read aloud. He took the view that &quot;introductory thoughts about the failure of the Reich government to observe the treaty are meant more for the leaders, not for the great mass of believers.&quot;

==Content==
The numbers conform to the headings used in the Vatican&#x27;s English translation of the text.

=== Violations of the Concordat ===
In the introduction and sections 1–8 of the encyclical Pius XI wrote of his &quot;deep anxiety and growing surprise&quot; on observing the travails of the Catholic Church in Germany with the terms of Concordat being openly broken and the faithful being oppressed as had never been seen before.

=== Race ===
Pius then affirmed the articles of faith that Nazi ideology was attacking. He stated that true belief in God could not be reconciled with race, people or state raised beyond their standard value to idolatrous levels. National religion or a national God was rejected as a grave error and that the Christian God could not be restricted &quot;within the frontiers of a single people, within the pedigree of one single race.&quot; (sections 9–13). Historian Michael Phayer wrote:

Martin Rhonheimer writes that while &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; asserts &quot;race&quot; is a &quot;fundamental value of the human community&quot;, &quot;necessary and honorable&quot;, it condemns the &quot;exaltation of race, or the people, or the state, or a particular form of state&quot;, &quot;above their standard value&quot; to &quot;an idolatrous level&quot;. According to Rhonheimer, it was Pacelli who added to Faulhaber&#x27;s milder draft the following passage (8):


Against this background to the encyclical, Faulhaber suggested in an internal Church memorandum that the bishops should inform the Nazi regime
…that the Church, through the application of its marriage laws, has made and continues to make, an important contribution to the state&#x27;s policy of racial purity; and is thus performing a valuable service for the regime&#x27;s population policy.

Vidmar wrote that the encyclical condemned particularly the purported paganism of the national socialist ideology, the myth of race and blood, and the fallacy of its conception of God. It warned Catholics that the growing Nazi ideology, which exalted one race over all others, was incompatible with Catholic Christianity.

11. None but superficial minds could stumble into concepts of a national God, of a national religion; or attempt to lock within the frontiers of a single people, within the narrow limits of a single race, God, the Creator of the universe, King and Legislator of all nations before whose immensity they are &quot;as a drop of a bucket&quot;

Historian Garry Wills, in the context of Jews having traditionally been described as deicides, says that the encyclical affirms Jesus received his human nature from a people who crucified him&#x27; – not some Jews, but the Jewish people&quot; and that it was also Pius XI who had disbanded the Catholic organization &quot;Friends of Israel&quot; that had campaigned to have the charge of deicide dropped. The charge of deicide against all Jewish people was later dropped during the Second Vatican Council.

=== Defending the Old Testament ===
Historian Paul O&#x27;Shea says the encyclical contains a vigorous defense of the Old Testament out of belief that it prepared the way for the New.


=== Claimed attacks on Hitler ===
There is no mention of Hitler by name in the encyclical but the &quot;mad prophet&quot; described in the text may be a veiled reference to him. The Catholic writer Anthony Rhodes wrote in &quot;The Vatican in the Age of the Dictators:&quot; &quot;Nor was the Führer himself spared [in the encyclical], for his &#x27;aspirations to divinity&#x27;, &#x27;placing himself on the same level as Christ&#x27;; &#x27;a mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance&quot;. Subsequent works have repeated Rhodes&#x27; characterization that Hitler is described as a &quot;mad prophet&quot; in the encyclical.

Historian John Connelly writes:

Some accounts exaggerate the directness of the pope&#x27;s criticism of Hitler. Contrary to what Anthony Rhodes in &quot;The Vatican in the Age of the Dictators&quot; writes, there were oblique references to Hitler. It was not the case that Pius failed to &quot;spare the Führer,&quot; or called him a &quot;mad prophet possessed of repulsive arrogance.&quot; The text limits its critique of arrogance to unnamed Nazi &quot;reformers&quot;.

Historian Michael Phayer wrote that the encyclical does not condemn Hitler or National Socialism, &quot;as some have erroneously asserted&quot;. Historian Michael Burleigh sees the passage as pinpointing &quot;the tendency of the Führer-cult to elevate a man into god.&quot;

The relevant passage in the English version of the encyclical is:
17. …Should any man dare, in sacrilegious disregard of the essential differences between God and His creature, between the God-man and the children of man, to place a mortal, were he the greatest of all times, by the side of, or over, or against, Christ, he would deserve to be called prophet of nothingness, to whom the terrifying words of Scripture would be applicable: &quot;He that dwelleth in heaven shall laugh at them&quot; (Psalms ii. 3).
(The German text uses the term &quot;&quot;, in which the component &quot;&quot; can mean &quot;illusion&quot; or &quot;delusion&quot;, while the Italian text uses &quot;un profeta di chimere&quot; (a prophet of chimeras; that is, a prophet as the product of the imagination).)

Historian Susan Zuccotti sees the above passage as an unmistakable jibe at Hitler.

=== Fidelity to the Church and Bishop of Rome ===
Pius then went on to assert that people were obliged to believe in Christ, divine revelation, and the primacy of the Bishop of Rome (Sections 14–24).

=== Soteriology ===
Historian Michael Burleigh views the following passage as a rejection of the Nazis&#x27; conception of collective racial immortality:

24. &quot;Immortality&quot; in a Christian sense means the survival of man after his terrestrial death, for the purpose of eternal reward or punishment. Whoever only means by the term, the collective survival here on earth of his people for an indefinite length of time, distorts one of the fundamental notions of the Christian Faith and tampers with the very foundations of the religious concept of the universe, which requires a moral order. [Whoever does not wish to be a Christian ought at least to renounce the desire to enrich the vocabulary of his unbelief with the heritage of Christian ideas.]

The bracketed text is in Burleigh&#x27;s book and the German version (section 29), but not in the Vatican&#x27;s English version: &quot;Wenn er nicht Christ sein will, sollte er wenigstens darauf verzichten, den Wortschatz seines Unglaubens aus christlichem Begriffsgut zu bereichern.&quot;

=== Compatibility of humility and heroism ===
Burleigh also mentions the encyclical&#x27;s rejection of Nazi contempt for the redemptive value of suffering:27. Humility in the spirit of the Gospel and prayer for the assistance of grace are perfectly compatible with self-confidence and heroism. The Church of Christ, which throughout the ages and to the present day numbers more confessors and voluntary martyrs than any other moral collectivity, needs lessons from no one in heroism of feeling and action. The odious pride of reformers only covers itself with ridicule when it rails at Christian humility as though it were but a cowardly pose of self-degradation.

=== Christian grace contrasted with natural gifts ===
=== Defense of natural law ===
Burleigh views the encyclical as confounding the Nazi philosophy that &quot;Right is what is advantageous to the people&quot; through its defense of Natural Law:

29. …To hand over the moral law to man&#x27;s subjective opinion, which changes with the times, instead of anchoring it in the holy will of the eternal God and His commandments, is to open wide every door to the forces of destruction. The resulting dereliction of the eternal principles of an objective morality, which educates conscience and ennobles every department and organization of life, is a sin against the destiny of a nation, a sin whose bitter fruit will poison future generations.The Nazi principle is rejected on the basis that what is morally illicit cannot be of true advantage. Human laws opposed to natural law were described as not &quot;obligatory in conscience&quot;. 

In his history of the German Resistance, Anton Gill interprets the encyclical as having asserted the &quot;inviolability of human rights&quot;. Historian Emma Fattorini wrote that the Pope&#x27;s

indignation was obviously not addressed at improbable democratic-liberal human rights issues, nor was there a generic and abstract appeal to evangelical principles. It was rather the Church&#x27;s competition with the totalitarian regression of the concept of Volk that in the Nazi state-worship totally absorbed the community-people relationship

Thomas Banchoff considers this the first explicit mention of human rights by a Pope, something the Pope would affirm the following year in a little-noticed letter to the American Church. Banchoff writes: &quot;the church&#x27;s full embrace of the human rights agenda would have to wait until the 1960s&quot;.

=== Defense of Catholic schooling ===
The encyclical also defends the natural rights of parents in the education of their children, and describes as &quot;void of all legality&quot; the &quot;notorious coercion&quot; of Catholic children away from Catholic schooling into interdenominational schools, part of Nazi attempts to monopolize education (sections 33–37).

=== Call to priests and religious ===
Pius ends the encyclical with a call to priests and religious to serve truth, to unmask and refute error, with the laity being urged to remain faithful to Christ and to defend the rights which the Concordat had guaranteed them and the Church. The encyclical dismisses &quot;[Nazi] attempts to dress up their ghastly doctrines in the language of religious belief.&quot;: 

=== Call to parents ===
=== Moderation of the encyclical but with warnings ===
==Release==
The encyclical was written in German and not the usual Latin of official Catholic Church documents. Because of government restrictions, the nuncio in Berlin, Archbishop Cesare Orsenigo, had the encyclical distributed by courier. There was no pre-announcement of the encyclical, and its distribution was kept secret in an attempt to ensure the unhindered public reading of its contents in all the Catholic churches of Germany. Printers close to the church offered their services and produced an estimated 300,000 copies, which was still insufficient. Additional copies were created by hand and using typewriters. After its clandestine distribution, the document was hidden by many congregations in their tabernacles for protection. It was read from the pulpits of German Catholic parishes on Palm Sunday, 21 March 1937.

== Nazi response ==
The release of &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; precipitated an intensification of the Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany. Hitler was infuriated. Twelve printing presses were seized, and hundreds of people sent either to prison or the concentration camps. In his diary, Goebbels wrote that there were heightened verbal attacks on the clergy from Hitler, and wrote that Hitler had approved the start of trumped up &quot;immorality trials&quot; against clergy and anti-Church propaganda campaign. Goebbels&#x27; orchestrated attack included a staged &quot;morality trial&quot; of 37 Franciscans. On the &quot;Church Question&quot;, wrote Goebbels, &quot;after the war it has to be generally solved … There is, namely, an insoluble opposition between the Christian and a heroic-German world view&quot;.

&quot;The Catholic Herald&quot;″s German correspondent wrote almost four weeks after the issuing of the encyclical that:

Hitler has not yet decided what to do. Some of his counsellors try to persuade him to declare the Concordat as null and void. Others reply that that would do immense damage to Germany&#x27;s prestige in the world, particularly to its relations with Austria and to its influence in Nationalist Spain. Moderation and prudence are advocated by them. There is, unfortunately, no hope that the German Reich will come back to a full respect of its Concordat obligations and that the Nazis will give up those of their doctrines which have been condemned by the Pope in the new Encyclical. But it is well possible that a definite denunciation of the Concordat and a rupture of diplomatic relations between Berlin and the Holy See will be avoided, at least for the time being.

&quot;The Catholic Herald&quot; reported on 23 April:

It is understood that the Vatican will reply to the note of complaint presented to it by the German Government in regard to the Encyclical &quot;Mit Brennender Sorge&quot;. The note was not a defence of Nazism, but a criticism of the Vatican&#x27;s action at a time when negotiations on the relations between the Vatican and Germany were still in being. It would seem that the Vatican, desirous of finding a modus vivendi, however slight the chance of it may appear, wishes to clear up any possible misunderstanding. On 15 April Cardinal Pacelli received Herr von Bergen, the Reich Ambassador at the Holy See. This was the first diplomatic meeting since the publication of the Encyclical.

&quot;The Tablet&quot; reported on 24 April 1937:

The case in the Berlin court against three priests and five Catholic laymen is, in public opinion, the Reich&#x27;s answer to the Pope&#x27;s Mit brennender Sorge encyclical, as the prisoners have been in concentration camps for over a year. Chaplain Rossaint, of Dusseldorf; is, however, known as a pacifist and an opponent of the National Socialist regime, and it is not denied that he was indiscreet; but he is, moreover, accused of having tried to form a Catholic-Communist front on the plea that he baptized a Jewish Communist. This the accused denies, and his defence has been supported by Communist witnesses.

The (censored) German newspapers made no mention of the encyclical. The Gestapo visited the offices of every German diocese the next day and seized all the copies they could find. Every publishing company that had printed it was closed and sealed, diocesan newspapers were proscribed, and limits imposed on the paper available for Church purposes.

The true extent of the Nazi fury at this encyclical was shown by the immediate measures taken in Germany to counter further propagation of the document. Not a word of it was printed in newspapers, and the following day the Secret Police visited the diocesan offices and confiscated every copy they could lay their hands on. All the presses which had printed it were closed and sealed. The bishops&#x27; diocesan magazines (&quot;Amtsblatter&quot;) were proscribed; and paper for church pamphlets or secretarial work was severely restricted. A host of other measures, such as diminishing the State grants to theology students and needy priests (agreed in the Concordat) were introduced. And then a number of futile, vindictive measures which did little to harm the Church …

According to Carlo Falconi: &quot;The pontifical letter still remains the first great official public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism, and the Pope&#x27;s courage astonished the world.&quot;

Historian Frank J. Coppa wrote that the encyclical was viewed by the Nazis as &quot;a call to battle against the Reich&quot; and that Hitler was furious and &quot;vowed revenge against the Church&quot;.

Klaus Scholder wrote:

According to John Vidmar, Nazi reprisals against the Church in Germany followed thereafter, including &quot;staged prosecutions of monks for homosexuality, with the maximum of publicity&quot;. One hundred and seventy Franciscans were arrested in Koblenz and tried for &quot;corrupting youth&quot; in a secret trial, with numerous allegations of priestly debauchery appearing in the Nazi-controlled press, while a film produced for the Hitler Youth showed men dressed as priests dancing in a brothel. &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot; reported on 15 October 1937:

The failure of the Nazi &quot;morality&quot; trials campaign against the Church can be gauged from the fact that, up to the beginning of August, the Courts were only able to condemn 74 religious and secular priests on such charges. The total number of religious and secular priests in Germany, according to the Catholic paper Der Deutsche Weg, is 122,792. The justice of such condemnations as the Nazis were able to obtain is more than suspect.

A pastoral letter issued by the German bishops in 1938 says &quot;Currency and morality trials are put up in such a way which shows that not justice but anti-Catholic propaganda is the main concern&quot;.

== Catholic response ==
Ian Kershaw wrote that during the Nazi period, the churches &quot;engaged in a bitter war of attrition with the regime, receiving the demonstrative backing of millions of churchgoers. Applause for Church leaders whenever they appeared in public, swollen attendances at events such as Corpus Christi Day processions, and packed church services were outward signs of the struggle of … especially of the Catholic Church – against Nazi oppression&quot;. While the Church ultimately failed to protect its youth organisations and schools, it did have some successes in mobilizing public opinion to alter government policies. Anton Gill wrote that, in 1937, amidst the harassment of the church and following the hundreds of arrests and closure of Catholic presses that followed the issuing of &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot;, at least 800,000 people attended a pilgrimage centred on Aachen – a massive demonstration by the standards of the day – and some 60,000 attended the 700th anniversary of the bishopric of Franconia – about equal to the city&#x27;s entire population.

The Vatican&#x27;s Secretary of State, Cardinal Pacelli (later Pope Pius XII), wrote to Germany&#x27;s Cardinal Faulhaber on 2 April 1937 explaining that the encyclical was theologically and pastorally necessary &quot;to preserve the True Faith in Germany.&quot; The encyclical also defended baptized Jews, still considered to be Jews by the Nazis because of racial theories unacceptable to the Church. Although the encyclical does not specifically mention the Jewish people, it condemns the exaltation of one race or blood over another, i.e. racism. 

Following the issuing of the document, &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot; opined that this &quot;great Encyclical in fact contains a summary of what most needs preserving as the basis for a Christian civilisation and a compendium of the most dangerous elements in Nazi doctrine and practice.&quot; and that:

Only a small portion of the Encyclical is against Germany&#x27;s continuous violations of the Concordat; the larger part refers to false and dangerous doctrines which are officially spread in Germany and to which the Holy Father opposes the teaching of the Catholic Church. The word National Socialism does not appear at all in the document. The Pope has not tried to give a full analysis of the National Socialist doctrine. That would, indeed, have been impossible, as the Nazi movement is relatively young and it is doubtful whether certain ideas are &quot;official&quot; and essential parts of its doctrine or not. But one thing is beyond any doubt: If you take away from the National Socialist &quot;faith&quot; those false dogmas which have solemnly been condemned by the Holy Father in his Encyclical, the remainder will not deserve to be called National Socialism.

Austrian Bishop Gfoellner of Linz had the encyclical read from the pulpits of his diocese. &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot; reported:

The Bishop of Linz (Mgr. Gfoellner) who has always taken a very strong anti-Nazi and anti-Socialist stand in the district of Austria where there has been most trouble with both views, said before the reading of the document: &quot;The fate of the Church in Germany cannot be a matter of indifference to us; it touches us very nearly.&quot; After indicating the reasons the Bishop added that the dangers of German Catholics were also the dangers of Austrian Catholics: &quot;What I wrote in my pastoral of January 21, 1933. It is impossible to be at once a good Catholic and a good National-Socialist,&#x27; is confirmed today.&quot; Mgr. Gfoellner asked all Catholic parents to keep their children away from any organisation which sympathised with the ideology condemned by the Pope.

In April 1938 The Vatican newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; displayed for the first time &quot;the historic headline&quot; of &quot;Religious Persecution in Germany&quot; and reflected that what Pius XI had published in &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; was now being clearly witnessed: &quot;Catholic schools are closed, people are coerced to leave the Church … religious instruction of the Youth is made impossible... Catholic organisations are suppressed… a press campaign is made against the Church, while its own newspapers and magazines are suppressed…&quot;

==Assessments==
The historian Eamon Duffy wrote:

In a triumphant security operation, the encyclical was smuggled into Germany, locally printed, and read from Catholic pulpits on Palm Sunday 1937. &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (&quot;With Burning Anxiety&quot;) denounced both specific government actions against the Church in breach of the concordat and Nazi racial theory more generally. There was a striking and deliberate emphasis on the permanent validity of the Jewish scriptures, and the Pope denounced the &#x27;idolatrous cult&#x27; which replaced belief in the true God with a &#x27;national religion&#x27; and the &#x27;myth of race and blood&#x27;. He contrasted this perverted ideology with the teaching of the Church in which there was a home &#x27;for all peoples and all nations&#x27;. The impact of the encyclical was immense, and it dispelled at once all suspicion of a Fascist Pope. While the world was still reacting, however, Pius issued five days later another encyclical, &quot;Divini Redemptoris&quot;, denouncing Communism, declaring its principles &quot;intrinsically hostile to religion in any form whatever&quot;, detailing the attacks on the Church which had followed the establishment of Communist regimes in Russia, Mexico and Spain, and calling for the implementation of Catholic social teaching to offset both Communism and &#x27;amoral liberalism&#x27;. The language of Divini Redemptoris was stronger than that of &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot;, its condemnation of Communism even more absolute than the attack on Nazism. The difference in tone undoubtedly reflected the Pope&#x27;s own loathing of Communism as the &quot;ultimate enemy.&quot;

Carlo Falconi wrote:

So little anti-Nazi is it that it does not even attribute to the regime as such, but only to certain trends within it, the dogmatic and moral errors widespread in Germany. And while the errors indicated are carefully diagnosed and refuted, complete silence surrounds the much more serious and fundamental errors associated with Nazi political ideology, corresponding to the principles most subversive of natural law that are characteristic of absolute totalitarianisms. The encyclical is in fact concerned purely with the Catholic Church in Germany and its rights and privileges, on the basis of the concordatory contracts of 1933. Moreover the form given to it by Cardinal Faulhaber, even more a super-nationalist than the majority of his most ardent colleagues, was essentially dictated by tactics and aimed at avoiding a definite breach with the regime, even to the point of offering in conclusion a conciliatory olive branch to Hitler if he would restore the tranquil prosperity of the Catholic Church in Germany. But that was the very thing to deprive the document of its noble and exemplary intransigence. Nevertheless, even within these limitations, the pontifical letter still remains the first great public document to dare to confront and criticize Nazism, and the Pope&#x27;s courage astonished the world. It was, indeed, the encyclical’s fate to be credited with a greater significance and content than it possessed.

Historian Klaus Scholder observed that Hitler&#x27;s interest in church questions seemed to have died in early 1937, which he attributes to the issuing of the encyclical and that &quot;Hitler must have regarded the encyclical &quot;Mit brennender sorge&quot; in April 1937 almost as a snub. In fact it will have seemed to him to be the final rejection of his world-view by Catholicism&quot;. Scholder wrote:

However, whereas the encyclical Divini Redemptoris mentioned Communism in Russia, Mexico and Spain directly by name, at the suggestion of Faulhaber the formulation of the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge was not polemical, but accused National Socialism above all indirectly, by a description of the foundations of the Catholic Church … As things were every hearer knew what was meant when it mentioned &#x27;public persecution&#x27; of the faithful, &#x27;a thousand forms of organized impediments to religion&#x27; and a &#x27;lack of teaching which is loyal to the truth and of the normal possibilities of defence&#x27;. Even if National Socialism was not mentioned by name, it was condemned clearly and unequivocally as an ideology when the encyclical stated &#x27;Anyone who makes Volk or state or form of state or state authorities or other basic values of the human shaping of society into the highest of all norms, even of religious values … perverts and falsifies the divinely created and divinely commanded order of things.&#x27;

Scholder adds that:
The time of open confrontation seemed to have arrived. However, it very soon emerged that the encyclical was open to different interpretations. It could be understood as a last and extreme way by which the church might maintain its rights and its truth within the framework of the concordat; but it could also be interpreted as the first step which could be and had to be followed by further steps.

Martin Rhonheimer wrote:

The general condemnation of racism of course included the Nazis&#x27; anti-Semitic racial mania, and condemned it implicitly. The question, however, is not what the Church&#x27;s theological position with regard to Nazi racism and anti-Semitism was in 1937, but whether Church statements were clear enough for everyone to realize that the Church included Jews in its pastoral concern, thus summoning Christian consciences to solidarity with them. In light of what we have seen, it seems clear that the answer to this question must be No. In 1937 the Church was concerned not with the Jews but with entirely different matters that the Church considered more important and more urgent. An explicit defense of the Jews might well have jeopardized success in these other areas.

He further writes

Such statements require us to reconsider the Church&#x27;s public declarations about the Nazi concept of the state and racism in the encyclical Mit brennender Sorge. Not only were Church declarations belated. They were also inadequate to counter the passivity and widespread indifference to the fate of Jews caused by this kind of Christian anti-Judaism and anti-Semitism, especially when it was combined with newly awakened national pride. The encyclical, then, came far too late to be of any help to Jews. In reality, however, the Church&#x27;s statements were never really designed to help the Jews. The &quot;Catholic apologetic&quot; described above is something developed after the fact and has no roots in the historical record. Indeed, given the dominant view of the Jews in the Nazi period, it would have been astonishing if the Church had mounted the barricades in their defense. As we shall see, the failure of Church statements about Nazism and racism ever to mention the Jews specifically (save in negative ways) corresponds to an inner logic that is historically understandable—but no less disturbing to us today.

Guenter Lewy wrote:

Many writers, influenced in part by the violent reaction of the Nazi government to the papal pronouncement, have hailed the encyclical letter Mit brennender Sorge as a decisive repudiation of the National Socialist state and Weltanschauung. More judicious observers have noted the encyclical was moderate in its tone and merely intimated that the condemned neopagan doctrines were favored by the German authorities. It is indeed a document in which, as one Catholic writer has put it, &quot;with considerable skill, the extravagances of German Nazi doctrine are picked out for condemnation in a way that would not involve the condemnation of political and social totalitarianism{ … While some of Pius&#x27; language is sweeping and can be given a wider construction, basically the Pope had condemned neopaganism and the denial of religious freedom – no less and no more

Catholic holocaust scholar Michael Phayer concludes that the encyclical &quot;condemned racism (but not Hitler or National Socialism, as some have erroneously asserted)&quot;. Other Catholic scholars have regarded the encyclical as &quot;not a heatedly combative document&quot; as the German episcopate, still ignorant of the real dimension of the problem, still entertained hopes of a Modus vivendi with the Nazis. As a result, the encyclical was &quot;not directly polemical&quot; but &quot;diplomatically moderate&quot;, in contrast to the encyclical &quot;Non abbiamo bisogno&quot; dealing with Italian fascism.

<text>RHS Britain in Bloom is the largest horticultural campaign in the United Kingdom. It was first held in 1963, initiated by the British Tourist Board based on the example set by Fleurissement de France (now Conseil national de villes et villages fleuris), which since 1959 has promoted the annual Concours des villes et villages fleuris. It has been organised by the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) since 2002.

The competition is entered by the communities of towns, villages and cities. Different categories exist for various sizes of settlements. Groups are assessed for their achievements in three core pillars: Horticultural Excellence; Environmental Responsibility; and Community Participation.

Over 1,600 communities around the UK enter each year, participating in their local region&#x27;s &quot;in Bloom&quot; campaign. From these regional competitions, roughly 80 communities are selected to enter the national Finals of RHS Britain in Bloom.

It is a popular campaign, estimated to involve more than 200,000 volunteers in cleaning up and greening up their local area.

Since 2002, the awards have been based on the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s medal standards of Gold, Silver Gilt, Silver and Bronze; the winner is the settlement judged to have most successfully met the rigorous judging criteria. Judging at the regional stage takes place around June/ July; judging for the national stage takes place in August. The results for the UK Finals are announced in September/ October. The competition covers the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.

Floral displays play an important part in the contest, but the &quot;Bloom&quot; title is now, perhaps, misleading: in recent years the competition has increasingly assessed how all sectors of the local community are managing their local environment.

In 2006, the RHS introduced the Neighbourhood Awards (now the It&#x27;s Your Neighbourhood campaign), a grassroots sister campaign to Bloom, supporting smaller, volunteer-led community groups focused on improving their immediate environment.

==History==
The history of the &#x27;Bloom&#x27;, as it is colloquially referred to, began in 1963 when Roy Hay MBE, a horticultural journalist, went on holiday to France during the &quot;Fleurissement de France&quot; and was enthralled by seeing the country &quot;filled to overflowing with flowers, shrubs and trees all in full bloom&quot;. His enquiries revealed that President de Gaulle had given orders to brighten up the country and the French Tourist Authority had set up the &quot;Fleurissement de France&quot; in 1959 (now called &quot;Concours des villes et villages fleuris&quot;). Hay was so impressed that he approached the British Tourist Authority (BTA), and he and Len Lickorish, then Director General of the BTA, set up a committee to run a British version, &quot;Britain in Bloom&quot;. It was piloted by the British Tourist Authority in 1963 (Lewisham being part of that pilot), and went national in 1964.

Many organisations were invited to help, including: The Automobile Association; London Tourist Board; National Farmers&#x27; Union; London Parks; Institute of Parks and Recreation Administration; National Association of Rural Communities; Royal Horticultural Society; Royal Automobile Club; The Tourist Boards of England, Scotland and Wales; The National Federation of Women&#x27;s Institutes; Civic Trust; Keep Britain Tidy Group; the Flowers and Plants Council; The Horticultural Trades Association; The British Hotels and Restaurants Association; The Society of Town Clerks; Townswomen&#x27;s Guild and British Airways. Despite this impressive list, Roy Hay later reflected that the initial reaction of the horticultural trade and local authorities was lukewarm.

Nevertheless, regional committees were quickly formed, and in 1964 Bath became the first national winner. From 1964 to 1969 inclusive there was an overall national winner. From 1970, however, the competition was divided up into a range of categories, because of the difficulty of comparing settlements of different sizes fairly.

The British Tourist Authority managed the competition until 1983 when the Government Department sponsoring the BTA felt that it should relinquish the responsibility. The Tidy Britain Group (the group responsible for the Keep Britain Tidy campaign, now known as EnCams) took over; it already had a long association with the competition. To mark the changeover, 1983 was celebrated as &quot;Beautiful Britain in Bloom Year&quot;. Sir Lawrie Barratt of Barratt Developments expressed his support to the Tidy Britain Group for the competition and provided sponsorship until 1989.

More categories and awards were added, in part reflecting a greater range of settlements, but also to recognise other elements of horticulture, including landscaping, and also to recognise the strenuous efforts to beautify the urban areas of the larger cities. McDonald&#x27;s began sponsoring the competition from 1990, which led to focus on littering behaviour and the implementation of a Children&#x27;s Painting Competition Calendar. In 2001, the event was organised jointly by EnCams and the Royal Horticultural Society, and from November 2001 the RHS took full control as the organising body of Britain in Bloom.
In 2017, after winning Britain in Bloom Champion of Champions, Elswick admitted to having previously cheated in the competition three years earlier. The volunteers engaged a specialist company to design a display which came in ready assembled trays. 

==Structure==

The competition currently has twelve entry categories, most of which are determined by population size. Within each category, similarly sized communities compete across a spectrum of horticultural endeavour, community participation and environmental responsibility, which includes dealing with issues of litter, graffiti and vandalism.

*Category A
**Small Village
**Village
**Large Village
*Category B
**Small Town
**Town
**Large Town
*Category C
**Small City
**City
**Large City
*Category D
**Urban Community
*Category E
**Small Coastal (electoral roll up to 12K)
**Large Coastal (electoral roll over 12K)

==Judging==
RHS Britain in Bloom encompasses 18 Regions/ Nations (12 English regions, as well as Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey).

Judging takes place over two years in two stages:

#&quot;Regional competition&quot;: Entries are first submitted by voluntary local &#x27;Bloom&#x27; Committees, depending upon the area, to Local Authorities, Town or Parish Councils. These communities take part in their regional competition, for example South West in Bloom. The local volunteers are colloquially known as &quot;bloomers&quot;. Judging takes place in June/July, and winners are announced during local presentations between August and November.

#&quot;UK-wide&quot;: After the judging of the regional stage, Committees representing their nation/region select entrants for the second UK-wide stage. To ensure that effort is sustained over time, this second stage of judging takes place in August the year after they qualify. Winners of the UK judging are announced at a prestigious ceremony in September/October.

==National winners==

==RHS It&#x27;s Your Neighbourhood==

RHS It&#x27;s Your Neighbourhood is part of the wider RHS Britain in Bloom initiative, helping volunteer-led groups to improve their local area. Any group can take part, as long as it is volunteer-led and involved in hands-on community gardening. It should also be working with the community for the benefit of the community. Participating groups care for all sorts of spaces - from local parks and gardens, to odd grot-spots which have been transformed and shared residential spaces or alleyways.

The campaign was launched by the RHS in 2006 to support grassroots community gardening and there are currently more than 1,300 registered groups. (2012)

The initiative works around the same three pillars of assessment as RHS Britain in Bloom: Community Participation, Gardening Achievement and Environmental Responsibility; however, it is not a competitive campaign. Participating groups receive an annual visit from an It&#x27;s Your Neighbourhood assessor, who provides feedback and tips for how to develop projects, and each group receives a certificate of achievement from the RHS.

It&#x27;s Your Neighbourhood is free to enter and open to groups of all sizes.

==Source of civic pride==

Winning a category within Britain in Bloom at a national or even regional level has proved to be a source of considerable civic pride for the towns, cities and villages involved. Many of the authorities of the winning locations do advertise their achievements on signs within, or more predominantly on the outskirts of their settlement. One journalist stated that &quot;Since Britain In Bloom began in 1963 … nothing has pleased town councillors more than to hammer up a sign at the outskirts of their kingdom trumpeting superiority to incoming visitors… Few events provide a sterner test of civic pride.&quot; Examples include Garstang where the sign that leads to the high street at the heart of the town says, above the name &quot;Garstang&quot;, &quot;Britain In Bloom Small Town – Gold Award Winners 2002, 2005&quot;, and &quot;Invitation Finalists to Champion of Champions 2006&quot;, or Guildford, which advertises its past triumph in the Town category on its welcome signs.

<text>A marble is a small spherical object often made from glass, clay, steel, plastic, or agate. These toys can be used for a variety of games called &quot;marbles&quot;, as well being placed in marble runs or races, or created as a form of art. They are often collected, both for nostalgia and for their aesthetic colors.

Sizes may vary, but usually range from about 0.5 cm to 3.5 cm in diameter.

In the North of England the objects and the game are called &quot;taws&quot;, with larger taws being called &quot;bottle washers&quot; after the use of a marble in Codd-neck bottles, which were often collected for play.

==Games==
===History===

In the early twentieth century, small balls of stone from about 2500 BCE, identified by archaeologists as marbles, were found by excavation near Mohenjo-daro, in a site associated with the Indus Valley civilization. In modern India the game is called &quot;kanche&quot;. Marbles are often mentioned in Roman literature, as in Ovid&#x27;s poem &quot;Nux&quot; (which mentions playing the game with walnuts), and there are many examples of marbles from excavations of sites associated with Chaldeans of Mesopotamia and ancient Egypt. They were commonly made of clay, stone or glass. Marbles arrived in Britain, imported from the Low Countries, during the medieval era.

In 1503, the town council of Nuremberg, Germany, limited the playing of marble games to a meadow outside the town. The name &quot;marble&quot;, used for the little toy balls, comes from this region and era, and refers to such balls being made of marble. At this point, marbles were made in mills and quarries by polishing small fragments of real stone like marble, agate, alabaster, limestone, and even brass.

It is unknown where marbles were first manufactured. A German glassblower invented marble scissors, a device for making marbles, in 1846. Ceramic marbles entered inexpensive mass production in the 1870s.

The game has become popular throughout the US and other countries. The first mass-produced toy marbles (clay) made in the US were made in Akron, Ohio, by S. C. Dyke, in the early 1890s. Some of the first US-produced glass marbles were also made in Akron by James Harvey Leighton. In 1903, Martin Frederick Christensen—also of Akron—made the first machine-made glass marbles on his patented machine. His company, M. F. Christensen &amp; Son Co., manufactured millions of toy and industrial glass marbles until they ceased operations in 1917. The next US company to enter the glass marble market was Akro Agate. This company was started by Akronites in 1911, but located in Clarksburg, West Virginia. Today, there is only one American-based toy marble manufacturer: Marble King, in Paden City, West Virginia.

===Types of game===
Various games can be played with marbles.

One game popular in the United Kingdom and United States is ring taw (or &quot;ringer&quot;), where a ring is drawn on the ground and a number of small marbles placed within it. Players take turns to flick a larger &quot;taw&quot; marble at these marbles, attempting to knock them out of the ring.

In kanche (from South Asia), players prepare for the game by standing behind a line and trying to flick their marble towards a designated hole, with the player who manages to flick their marble closest to the hole getting the chance to go first in the game. The marbles are all then placed in the center of a circle, with each player getting one striking marble and the chance to flick their marble in an attempt to strike the circle-marbles out of the circle. Each marble thus displaced is acquired by the striker, and once all the marbles have been struck out of the circle, the player with the most marbles wins the game.

Similarly, in pili goli (South Asia), the goal of the game is to flick a striking marble in order to knock other marbles laid around the field into holes that have been dug into the ground.

===World championship===
The British and World Marbles Championship has been held at Tinsley Green, West Sussex, England, every year since 1932. (Marbles has been played in Tinsley Green and the surrounding area for many centuries: &quot;TIME&quot; magazine traces its origins to 1588.) Traditionally, the marbles-playing season started on Ash Wednesday and lasted until midday on Good Friday: playing after that was thought to bring bad luck. More than 20 teams from around the world take part in the championship, each Good Friday; German teams have been successful several times since 2000, although local teams from Crawley, Copthorne and other Sussex and Surrey villages often take part as well; the first championship in 1932 was won by Ellen Geary, a young girl from London.

===Gameplay terminology===

* &quot;Knuckle down&quot;: the position adopted at the start line at the beginning of a match. The player begins with their knuckle against the ground.
* &quot;Quitsies&quot;: allows any opponent to stop the game without consequence. Players can either have &quot;quitsies&quot; (able to quit) or &quot;no quitsies&quot;.
* &quot;Keepsies&quot; (or &quot;for keeps&quot;): the player keeps all the marbles they win.
* &quot;Elephant stompies&quot;: when called, it allows a player to stomp their marble level with the ground surface, making it very difficult for other players to hit.
* &quot;Bombies&quot;: when called, it allows a player to take one or two steps while holding their marble and, while closing one eye, to line up over one of the opponent&#x27;s marbles and drop the marble trying to hit the marble on the ground.
* &quot;Leaning tops&quot;: when called, a shooter leans in on their off hand for leverage over an indentation on any type of surface or obstacle.
* A &quot;taw&quot; or &quot;shooter&quot; is generally a larger marble used to shoot with, and &quot;ducks&quot; are marbles to be shot at.
* Various names refer to the marble&#x27;s size. Any marble larger than the majority may be termed a boulder, bonker, cosher, goen, masher, plumper, popper, shooter, thumper, smasher, goom, noogie, taw, bumbo, crock, bumboozer, bowler, tonk, tronk, godfather, tom bowler, fourer, giant, dobber, dobbert, hogger, biggie, jumbo or toebreaker. A marble smaller than the majority is a peawee, peewee or mini. A &quot;grandfather&quot; is the largest marble, the size of a billiards ball or tennis ball.
* Various names for different marble types (regional playground talk, Leicester, UK): Marleys (marbles), prit (white marble), Kong (large marble), King Kong (larger than a bosser), steely (metal bearing-ball). Names can be combined: e.g. prit-Kong (large white marble).

==Types of marbles==


There are various types of marbles, and names vary from locality to locality.
* Aggie – made of agate (&quot;aggie&quot; is short for &quot;agate&quot;) or glass resembling agate, with various patterns like in the alley
* Alley or real – made of marble or alabaster (&quot;alley&quot; is short for &quot;alabaster&quot;), streaked with wavy or other patterns with exotic names like corkscrew, spiral, snake, ribbon, onyx, swirl, bumblebee, and butterfly
** Ade – strands of opaque white and color, making lemon-ade, lime-ade, orange-ade, etc.
** Cat&#x27;s eye or catseye – central eye-shaped colored inserts or cores (injected inside the marble)
*** Beachball – three colors and six vanes
*** Devil&#x27;s eye – red with yellow eye
* Red devils – same color scheme as a devil&#x27;s eye but swirly
** Clambroth – equally spaced opaque lines on a milk-white opaque base. Rare clams can have blue or black base glass. Medium-high value for antique marbles; rare base color valued much higher.
** Lutz – antique, handmade German swirl, containing bands of fine copper flakes that glitter like gold. Erroneously thought to have been invented by noted glassmaker Nicholas Lutz. Medium-high value for antique marbles, depending on specific sub-type of Lutz design.
** Oilie or oily – opaque with a rainbow, iridescent finish
** Onionskin – antique, handmade German swirl, with many closely packed surface streaks. Medium price range for antique marbles.
** Opaque – a popular marble that comes in many colors
** Oxblood – a streaky patch resembling blood
** Pearls – opaque with single color with mother of pearl finish
** Toothpaste – also known as &quot;plainsies&quot; in Canada. Wavy streaks usually with red, blue, black, white, orange.
** Turtle – wavy streaks containing green and yellow
* Bumblebee – modern, machine-made marble; mostly yellow with two black strips on each side
* China – glazed porcelain, with various patterns similar to an alley marble. Geometric patterns have low value; flowers or other identifiable objects can command high prices.
** Plaster – a form of china that is unglazed
* Commie or common – made of clay; natural color or monochrome coloration. Made in huge quantities during nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
** Bennington – clay fired in a kiln with salt glaze—usually brown, often blue. Other colorations fairly scarce. Fairly low value.
** Crock – made from crockery (earthenware) clay
* Croton alley or jasper – glazed and unglazed china marbled with blue
* Crystal or clearie or purie – any clear colored glass – including &quot;opals,&quot; &quot;glimmers,&quot; &quot;bloods,&quot; &quot;rubies,&quot; etc. These can have any number of descriptive names such as &quot;deep blue sea&quot;, &quot;blue moon&quot;, &quot;green ghost&quot;, &quot;brass bottle&quot;, &quot;bloody Mary&quot;.
** Princess – a tinted crystal
** Galaxy – modern, machine-made marble; lots of dots inserted to look like a sky of stars
* Indian – antique, handmade German marble; dark and opaque, usually black, with overlaid groups of color bands; usually white, and one or more other colors. Can also have many colors like blue, green and scarlet. Medium price range for antique marbles.
* Mica – antique, handmade German marble; glassy to translucent with streaks or patches of mica, ranging from clear to misty. Value depends on glass color.
* Steely – made of steel; a steely was traditionally made from a flat piece of steel folded into a sphere and showed a cross where the corners all come together, but other versions of a steely are solid steel ball bearings.
* Sulphide – antique, handmade German marble; large ( or more) clear glass sphere with a small statuette or figure inside. Most common are domesticated animals such as dogs, cats, cows, etc.; then wild animals; human figures are scarce; inanimate objects such as a train or pocket watch are very rare and command high prices. The interior figures are made of white clay or kaolin, and appear a silvery color due to light refraction. A sulphide with a colored-glass sphere, or with a painted figure inside, is also very rare and brings a high price. Like other types of antique marbles, sulphides have been reproduced and faked in large quantities.
* Swirly – a common marble made out of glass with one swirly color
* Shooter – any marble but in a bigger size
* Tiger – clear with orange-yellow stripes
* Baby – white with colors visible on the outside
* Tom bowler – large glass marble at least twice as big as a normal marble

===Art marbles===

Art marbles are high-quality collectible marbles arising out of the art glass movement. They are sometimes referred to as contemporary glass marbles to differentiate them from collectible antique marbles, and are spherical works of art glass.

Collectible contemporary marbles are made mostly in the United States by individual artists such as Josh Simpson.

Art marbles are usually around in diameter (a size also known as a &quot;toe breaker&quot;), but can vary, depending on the artist and the print.

==Marble collecting==
Marble players often grow to collect marbles after having outgrown the game. Marbles are categorized by many factors including condition, size, type, manufacturer/artisan, age, style, materials, scarcity, and the existence of original packaging (which is further rated in terms of condition). A marble&#x27;s worth is primarily determined by type, size, condition and eye-appeal, coupled with the law of supply and demand. Ugly, but rare marbles may be valued as much as those of very fine quality. However, this is the exception, rather than the rule, and normally &quot;condition is king&quot; when it comes to marbles. Any surface damage (characterized by missing glass, such as chips or pits) typically cuts book value by 50% or more.

Due to the large market, there are many related side businesses that have sprung up such as numerous books and guides, web sites dedicated to live auctions of marbles only, and collector conventions. Additionally, many glass artisans produce art marbles for the collectors&#x27; market only, with some selling for thousands of dollars.

==Manufacturing==
Marbles are made using many techniques. They can be categorized into two general types: hand-made and machine-made.

Marbles were originally made by hand. Stone or ivory marbles can be fashioned by grinding. Clay, pottery, ceramic, or porcelain marbles can be made by rolling the material into a ball, and then letting dry, or firing, and then can be left natural, painted, or glazed. Clay marbles, also known as &quot;crock marbles&quot; or &quot;commies&quot; (&quot;common&quot;), are made of slightly porous clay, traditionally from local clay or leftover earthenware (&quot;crockery&quot;), rolled into balls, then glazed and fired at low heat, creating an opaque imperfect sphere that is frequently sold as an &quot;old timey&quot; marble. Glass marbles can be fashioned through the production of glass rods which are stacked together to form the desired pattern, cutting the rod into marble-sized pieces using marble scissors, and rounding the still-malleable glass.

One mechanical technique is dropping globules of molten glass into a groove made by two interlocking parallel screws. As the screws rotate, the marble travels along them, gradually being shaped into a sphere as it cools. Color is added to the main batch glass and to additional glass streams that are combined with the main stream in a variety of ways. For example, in the &quot;cat&#x27;s-eye&quot; style, colored glass veins are injected into a transparent main stream. Applying more expensive colored glass to the surface of cheaper transparent or white glass is also a common technique.

Currently, the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of playing marbles is Vacor de Mexico. Founded in 1934, the company now makes 90 percent of the world&#x27;s marbles. Over 12 million are produced daily.

<doc id="672181" wikidata="Q17109317" url="?curid=672181" title="Frontier Wrestling Alliance">
<text>Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA) was a professional wrestling promotion in Britain. Established in 1993 as the Fratton Wrestling Association it soon became the Frontier Wrestling Alliance six years later and until 2007 when it lost a scripted inter-promotional feud with International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom. As a result of losing the promotion was forced to close and the company XWA was founded, largely based on the old FWA with some old staff and wrestlers as well as some championships. However, in 2009 the FWA brand was relaunched again as a separate promotion to the XWA, running for three more years before folding again in 2012.

==History==

===First run===

The FWA initially started out as the Fratton Wrestling Association in 1993 by Mark Sloan in an attempt to create a forum for serious wrestling training and performance based in Portsmouth. Renaming the promotion to the Fratton Wrestling Alliance 1999, it experienced a renovation that geared it towards national expansion and promoted its first show in February of that year, changing to Frontier Wrestling Alliance by the second show in June. The promotion (now being co-run by Mark Sloan and film and TV producer Elisar Cabrera) soon produced a regional television programme (&quot;Frontier Wrestling&quot;) in Portsmouth as well as founding a training academy to create its own talent. The emphasis on new wrestlers organically led to an early storyline of new, internationally influenced wrestling clashing with traditional British wrestling with some veterans brought in to help promote FWA&#x27;s own performers.

The company created a British championship later that year and in 2000 also crowned tag team champions as it continued to expand, performing across the south of the country. By August FWA began promoting shows with foreign talent, initially Sabu and Dan Severn, which it would continue to do so during its first run by cross promoting with other promotions. This eventually led to the British Heavyweight Championship being won by American wrestler Christopher Daniels, the belt being defended on international soil and a joint-promoted event with American independent promotion Ring of Honor in 2003. The company used international stars to gain notoriety (including hosting the XPW European Championship) and were further aided in advertisement when Alex Shane became a regular presenter on national talk radio station Talksport, aiding the company&#x27;s expansion into the north of England. The ties with Talksport became important when FWA promoted a show entitled &quot;Revival&quot; from the Crystal Palace Indoor Arena that was broadcast live on radio and later on national television, through Bravo.

In late 2006, FWA entered into a scripted feud with International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom (IPW:UK) when FWA wrestlers invaded IPW:UK&#x27;s annual Brawl at the Hall event and took some of the locker room hostage. In the elimination tag team contest, Team FWA beat Team IPW:UK and proclaimed war on the company. As the rivalry intensified over the next few months, wrestlers from both rosters had matches in both promotions and neutral ground with FWA gaining the early advantage. After months of clashes three events were held under joint banners with the final show, IPW:UK vs. FWA: Final Frontiers, booked for a match between IPW&#x27;s Martin Stone and an unnamed FWA wrestler to with both companies&#x27; future on the line. The show featured much in-fighting, including the two commentators breaking out into a brawl and ended with the mystery FWA wrestler being revealed as the retired former FWA British Heavyweight Champion Flash Barker who lost the match, resulting in FWA folding in March 2007.

===Closure and XWA===

After the FWA went out of business, Greg Lambert and Mark Kay held a press conference and formed a new promotion named XWA alluding to their former company but insisting the two had a different ethos, with the new company gearing its product towards family entertainment rather than being adult orientated. Despite only basing their promotion on the former company, XWA inherited the physical British Heavyweight and Flyweight Championship belts from FWA and continued to use them, promising to also resurrect the FWA Tag Team Championship, though they never would. However, in April 2009 at XWA&#x27;s War on the Shore V, Lambert finally announced the creation of XWA&#x27;s own British Heavyweight Championship belts and gave the FWA belt to Alex Shane, making his only appearance at an XWA event, while Shane presented the new physical title to the winner of the evening&#x27;s championship match, Sam Slam.

===Rebirth===
Despite being on the losing end of the battle with International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom and the XWA promotion purportedly taking its lineage, in May 2009, over two years after its original demise, Tony Simpson and Alex Shane announced their intention to revive the national promotion. They held their comeback show, New Frontiers, in early August with matches designed to crown a new FWA World Champion and FWA Flyweight Champion.
On 13 February 2010 at the British Uproar event in Broxbourne, Martin Stone defeated Andy Simmonz in the tournament finals to become the first FWA World Heavyweight Champion. He subsequently turned heel and formed a faction called &quot;The Agenda&quot;, whose aims are to decimate the UK&#x27;s top talent in order to showcase their skills to the large American wrestling companies and earn a lucrative contract as a result. At the European Uprising show in Birmingham on 20 November 2010, Alex Shane turned heel and revealed it was he who was the real leader of the Agenda.

After April 2012, the company quietly went inactive again running no further events, and their website going down.

==Rules==
The promotion followed the same rules as seen in most of professional wrestling but adopted the penalty card system from football, with the yellow card serving as a warning, and any red card offence resulting in disqualification. Piledrivers were banned under FWA rules and could result in a fine as well as disqualification.

<doc id="672184" wikidata="Q4039695" url="?curid=672184" title="Green Cheese (missile)">
<text>Fairey&#x27;s Green Cheese, a rainbow code name, was a British-made radar-guided anti-ship missile project of the 1950s. It was a development of the earlier and much larger Blue Boar television guided glide bomb, making it smaller, replacing the television camera with the radar seeker from the Red Dean air-to-air missile, and carrying a smaller warhead of .

Green Cheese arose as part of the &#x27;&quot;Sverdlov&quot; crisis&#x27;, when the Royal Navy were concerned over the appearance of a new Soviet heavy cruiser class. Green Cheese was a longer-ranged and guided replacement for the unguided Red Angel, which had required an approach by the attacker too close to be considered survivable. During development the range requirement could not be met, and a small rocket motor was added to improve this. This also increased the weight to from the planned .

Green Cheese was intended to arm two aircraft, the Fairey Gannet, and the still-under-development Blackburn Buccaneer. The rising weight made it too heavy for the existing Gannets, and the Buccaneer had enough performance to directly attack the ships with conventional bombs, at least in the short term. Green Cheese was cancelled in 1956 and development of an even more powerful design for Buccaneer began.

==Development==
===Previous systems===
One of the earliest responses to the &quot;Sverdlov&quot; was the Red Angel anti-shipping rocket, essentially a greatly enlarged version of the armour-piercing RP-3 used during World War II. The intended aircraft was the Westland Wyvern strike aircraft, but as development dragged on, plans to replace the Wyvern with a jet-powered design, NA.39, were advancing. This would leave a gap where the Wyvern would be removed and the jet not yet introduced. To fill this gap, the Fairey Gannet was selected, a much larger and slower aircraft than the Wyvern. It was felt that Red Angel&#x27;s range would not be enough to keep it safe from the ship-board guns.

===Longer range===
Through this same period, the Royal Air Force had been developing a large television guided glide bomb, Blue Boar. This system was overtaken by other developments, and ultimately cancelled in 1956. However, a smaller development under OR.1127 was already being considered as an anti-shipping weapon which could be launched in large numbers from the Vickers Valiant while flying at high altitude, around , far beyond the range of the ship&#x27;s guns. In 1954, the Navy released AW.319, calling for a version that could be launched from the Gannet, and later, the NA.39 aircraft. This was assigned the name Green Cheese.

For the Gannet, it was envisioned the aircraft would drop Green Cheese from around altitude, with a required range of , whereas the Valiant would drop it from high altitudes and it would have a range of about . The range was limited by the radar seeker being used, which was adapted from the Vickers Red Dean air-to-air missile. The original Blue Boar design had relatively high drag as it was designed to fall at a fairly steep angle around 45 degrees, which meant the it would not have the range required when dropped from the Gannet. For this reason, the wings were redesigned to have lower drag. Fairey Aviation won the contract with their Fairey Project 7.

The weapon would be produced in two versions, one with fixed wings to be carried externally on the Valiant and designed to hit the ships above the waterline, and a second with flip-out fins for the Gannet and NA.39, designed to hit the ship under the waterline as with the earlier rockets. To do this, the missile would hit the water about short of the target. The radome was designed to crush on impact with the water and expose an angled section that caused it to curve up and travel horizontally through the water. Arranging this to occur proved more difficult than initially imagined and was ultimately abandoned in favour of a traditional warhead, which had been the plan for the Valiant version all along.

In testing, the glide performance even with the new wings proved to be too small to reach the desired range. The initial idea was the add a tapered tail to reduce drag, but this led to less internal room for the electronics, which were in the tail. Instead, they added a small rocket motor, a short section of the Smokey Joe motor from the Thunderbird surface-to-air missile, giving it the desired 30 degree flight path.

===Moving to Buccaneer===
These changes also had the side effect of raising the weight from the desired to an estimated , too heavy for the Gannet. There was also the issue that the radar seeker needed to be able to see forward prior to launch, which would require the missile to be extended below the aircraft, which would require some sort of new system to expose it. Eventually the decision to use Green Cheese on Gannet was abandoned, and it was moved entirely to the upcoming NA.39, soon to be known as the Blackburn Buccaneer.

Moving to the new aircraft had the significant advantage that the aircraft&#x27;s own targeting radar could be used to feed initial information to the missile, meaning that it would not have to be exposed prior to launch. There was also some consideration of using the aircraft&#x27;s radar in a semi-automatic fashion, thereby simplifying the radar on the missile, but this was abandoned as it was felt it would make the aircraft too visible. This was not a problem on Valiant, as the missiles were carried externally and would always be able to see the target.

By March 1955 it was clear the project was in trouble, and it was officially cancelled in 1956 due in part to cost over-runs. By this point it had a reached a stage called Cockburn Cheese, after the British military scientist Dr. Robert Cockburn. It was replaced with the Green Flash project, armed with the Red Beard warhead. This too was cancelled and the idea of a tactical nuclear-tipped guided missile for anti-shipping use was given up in favour of a simple &quot;lobbed&quot; tactical nuclear bomb, the WE.177A.

<doc id="672186" wikidata="Q1145271" url="?curid=672186" title="Schola Medica Salernitana">
<text>The Schola Medica Salernitana () was a medieval medical school, the first and most important of its kind. Situated on the Tyrrhenian Sea in the south Italian city of Salerno, it was founded in the 9th century and rose to prominence in the 10th century, becoming the most important source of medical knowledge in Western Europe at the time.

Arabic medical treatises, both those that were translations of Greek texts and those that were originally written in Arabic, had accumulated in the library of Montecassino, where they were translated into Latin; thus the received lore of Hippocrates, Galen and Dioscorides was supplemented and invigorated by Arabic medical practice, known from contacts with Sicily and North Africa. As a result, the medical practitioners of Salerno, both men and women, were unrivaled in the medieval Western Mediterranean for practical concerns.

==Overview==

Founded in the 9th century, the school was originally based in the dispensary of a monastery. It achieved its greatest celebrity between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, from the last decades of Lombard power, during which its fame began to spread more than locally, to the fall of the Hohenstaufen. The arrival in Salerno of Constantine Africanus in 1077 marked the beginning of Salerno&#x27;s classic period. Through the encouragement of Alfano I, Archbishop of Salerno and translations of Constantine Africanus, Salerno gained the title of &quot;Town of Hippocrates&quot; (&quot;Hippocratica Civitas&quot; or &quot;Hippocratica Urbs&quot;). People from all over the world flocked to the &quot;Schola Salerni&quot;, both the sick, in the hope of recovering, and students, to learn the art of medicine.

The school was based on the synthesis of the Greek-Latin tradition supplemented by notions from Arab and Jewish cultures. The approach was based on the practice and culture of prevention rather than cure, thus opening the way for the empirical method in medicine.

==Legend of the foundation==
The foundation of the school is traditionally linked to an event narrated by a legend. It is reported that a Greek pilgrim named Pontus had stopped in the city of Salerno and found shelter for the night under the arches of the Arcino aqueduct. There was a thunderstorm and an Italian traveller, named Salernus, wandered into the same place. He was hurt and the Greek, at first suspicious, approached to look closely at the dressings that the Latin applied to his wound. Meanwhile, two other travellers, the Jew Helinus and the Arab Abdela had come. They also showed interest in the wound and at the end it was discovered that all four were dealing with medicine. They then decided to create a partnership and to give birth to a school where their knowledge could be collected and disseminated.

==The first period: 9th–10th centuries==
The origins of the &quot;School&quot; should date back to the 9th century, though the documentation for this first period is rather poor. Little is known about the nature, lay or monastic, of doctors who were part of it, and it is unclear whether the &quot;School&quot; already had an institutionalized organization. Antonio Mazza dates the foundation of the school in 802. The &quot;Historia inventionis ac translationis et miracula Sanctae Trophimenae&quot; chronicle narrates that in the period in which Pulcari was prefect of Amalfi (867–878 c.) a young woman by the name of Theodonanda fell seriously ill. Her husband and relatives took her to Salerno to be treated by the great archiater Hyerolamus, who visits her and consults a great amount of books (&quot;immensa volumina librorum&quot;).

From the 9th century there was a great legal culture in Salerno as well as the existence of lay teachers and an ecclesiastical school. Alongside the masters of the law there were also those who cared for the body and taught the dogmas of the art of health. By the 10th century the city of Salerno was already very famous for its healthy climate and its doctors, and the fame of the medical school had reached northern Europe. We are told that &quot;they were devoid of literary culture but provided with great experience and innate talent&quot;, and their fame was based more on their practical, observational, and experimental knowledge of medicine and successful cures rather than from ancient books and learning. In 988, went to Salerno to have himself cured by the famed Salerno physicians, as told in the &quot;Gesta episcoporum Virdunensium&quot;. Richerus tells the story of a Salernitan physician at the French court in 947, whose medical knowledge he describes rooted in practical experience rather than books. In his &quot;Historia Ecclesiastica,&quot; Orderic Vitalis (1075 – ) states that in Salerno &quot;the most ancient school of medicine has long flourished&quot;.

==The second period: 11th–13th centuries==

Geographic location certainly played a key role in the growth of the School: Salerno, a Mediterranean port, fused influences of Arab and Eastern Roman culture. Books of Avicenna and Averroes arrived by sea, and the Carthaginian physician Constantine the African (or Ifrīqiya) who arrived in the city for several years came to Salerno and translated many texts from Arabic: Aphorisma and Prognostica of Hippocrates, Tegni and Megategni of Galen, Kitāb-al-malikī (i.e. Liber Regius, or Pantegni) of Alī ibn&#x27;Abbās (Haliy Abbas), the Viaticum of al-Jazzār (Algizar), the Liber divisionum and the Liber experimentorum of Rhazes (Razī), the Liber dietorum, Liber urinarium and the Liber febrium of Isaac Israel the Old (Isaac Iudaeus).

Johannes (d. February 2, 1161) and Matthaeus Platearius, possible father and son, resided in Salerno at this time when they apparently published their famous &quot;Liber de Simplici Medicina&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Circa Instans&quot;) which is first recorded in Salerno under their name early in the 13th Century. Subsequent incarnations—c.1480 now found in Brussels; and in the early 1500s, published in Paris with art by Robinet Testard and now found in both Paris and St. Petersburg—bore the name &quot;Livre des simples medecines&quot;. Facsimiles with commentary for both editions have been published by Opsomer and Stearn (1984) and by Moleiro (2001).

Under this cultural thrust are rediscovered the classical works long forgotten in the monasteries. Thanks to the &quot;Medical School&quot;, medicine was the first science discipline to come out of the abbeys to confront again with the world and experimental practice.

Monks of Salerno and of the nearby Badia di Cava were of great importance in Benedictine geography, for we note in the city in the eleventh century the presence of three important figures of this order: Pope Gregory VII, the Abbot of Montecassino Desiderio (future Pope Victor III) and bishop Alfano I.

In this context, the &quot;School&quot; of Salerno grew until it became a point of attraction of both sick and students from all over Europe. The prestige of doctors in Salerno is largely witnessed by the chronicles of the time and the numerous manuscripts kept in the major European libraries.

In 1231, the authority of the school was sanctioned by Emperor Federico II. In his constitution of Melfi it was established that the activity of a doctor could only be carried out by doctors holding a diploma issued by the Medical School Salernitana. In 1280 Charles II of Anjou approved the first statute in which the School was recognized as a General Study in Medicine.

Its fame crossed borders, as proved by the Salernitan manuscripts kept in many European libraries, and by historical witnesses. The twelfth- or thirteenth-century author of the poem &quot;Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum&quot; gave a Salernitan provenance to his poem in order to advertise his work and give validity to it. The school kept the Greek-Latin medical tradition going, merging it with the Arab and Jewish medical traditions. The meeting of different cultures led to a synthesis and the comparison of different medical knowledge, as evidenced by a legend that ascribes the foundation of the school to four masters: the Jewish Helinus, the Greek Pontus, the Arab Abdela, and the Latin Salernus. In the school, besides the teaching of medicine (in which women too were involved, as both teachers and students), there were courses of philosophy, theology, and law.

The most famous female doctor and medical author at the school is Trota or Trotula de Ruggiero, who is accredited with several books on gynaecology and cosmetics, collectively known as &quot;The Trotula&quot;. &quot;De Passionibus Mulierum Curandorum&quot; was first published around 1100 AD and was a prominent text until a major revision by Louise Bourgoise, a midwife whose husband worked as assistant to Ambrose Paré in the early 1600s. A further 19 less definitive manuscripts by Trota can be found in European libraries today. Additional women physicians who attended this school became known as the &quot;Women of Salerno&quot;, or the &quot;mulieres Saleritanae,&quot; and included women such as Abella, Constance Calenda, Rebecca de Guarna, and Mercuriade.

Books made the Salernitan school famous. They had a strong start with the &quot;Pantegni&quot;, Constantine&#x27;s translation and adaptation of the &quot;Al-malaki&quot; of Haly Abbas, ten volumes of theoretical medicine and ten of practical medicine. He had also translated a treatise on the ophthalmology of Hunayn bin Ishaq and the &quot;Viaticus&quot; of Ibn al-Jazzar. The most famous pharmacopeia of the Middle Ages, the Antidotarium Nicolai, also was written in the circles of the school.

Among the physicians who trained at the Schola Medica Salernitana is Gilles de Corbeil.

==The third period: 14–19th centuries==
With the emergence of the University of Naples, the &quot;School&quot; began to lose importance. Over time its prestige was obscured by that of younger universities, especially Montpellier, Padua, and Bologna. The Salernitan institution, however, remained alive for several centuries until, on November 29, 1811, it was abolished by Gioacchino Murat during the reorganization of public education in the Kingdom of Naples. The last seat was the Palazzo Copeta.

The remaining &quot;Doctors of Medicine and Law&quot; at the Salerno Medical School operated in Salerno&#x27;s &quot;National Convitto Tasso&quot; for fifty years, from 1811 until their closure in 1861, by Francesco De Sanctis, the minister of public instruction for the newborn Kingdom of Italy.

==Medical studies==
The &quot;curriculum studiorum&quot; consisted of 3 years of logic, 5 years of medicine (including surgery and anatomy), and a year of practice with an experienced physician. 
Also, every five years, an autopsy of a human body was planned.

Lessons consisted in the interpretation of the texts of ancient medicine. But while medicine was slow, in Salerno there appeared the new art of surgery which was elevated to the dignity of a true science by Ruggiero di Fugaldo. He wrote the first treatise on national surgery that spread throughout Europe. Therefore, since the 12th century, Salerno was the target of particularly German students. But with Arabic books becoming more common, the scientific influence of the school, which was believed to be of a Latin tradition, was decreasing, superseded by universities in Northern Italy. Alumni such as Bruno da Longobucco also helped disseminate its teaching.
The &quot;School&quot;, besides teaching medicine (where women were admitted as both teachers and students), also taught philosophy, theology and law, and that is why some also consider it as the first University ever founded.

The teaching subjects in the Salernitan Medical School are known to us through a special statute. School teachers distinguished medicine in theory and practice. The first gave the necessary lessons to know the body structures, the parts that compose it, and their qualities; the second gave the means to preserve the health and to fight disease. And, in common with all other medical schools of the time, the basis of medical teaching was the principles of Hippocrates and Galen. The ancient texts of Salerno&#x27;s masters do not deviate from this tradition.

The spread of Salernitan medical doctrines to distant regions is attested by documents such as a codex that is kept in the Capitolare di Modena from the abbey of Nonantola. These confirm the antiquity of medical teaching in Salerno, and prove that the tradition of Latin culture had not switched off and its dissemination center was Salerno.

The most famous treatise produced by the school is &quot;Regimen Sanitatis Salernitanum&quot;. The work, in Latin verse, appears to be a collection of hygiene rules, based on its doctrine.

==Almo Collegio Salernitano==
The Medical College was an independent academic body of the School. Its aim was to submit students who had completed the required years of study to a rigorous examination to obtain the doctorate, not only to practice medicine but also to teach it.

The Medical College was a professional organization for the defense of the medics&#x27; interests and dignity, and also to put a brake on the pesky work of medicines.

The first sovereign act validating the college&#x27;s prerogatives by granting legal recognition to the academic titles issued by it dates back to Emperor Frederick II in 1200. All the doctors in the city were &quot;Alunni&quot; and they also gradually had the right to enter the college. Usually the function of conferring graduates took place either in the Church of St. Peter at Court, or of St. Matthew or in the Chapel of St. Catherine. But at the beginning of the year 1000 the conferment took place in the palace of the city.

The oath represented the highest moral conception of the doctor&#x27;s function, who swore to give his help to the poor without asking for anything and at the same time was a sublime affirmation before God and men to maintain an honest life and strict conduct. In order to obtain a pharmacy license, that is to say in &quot;arte aromatariae&quot;, the candidate was required to be of a moral and honest character, qualities which the School held in high esteem. Such a diploma was often held as evidence of the &#x27;religious&#x27; character of a young graduate. The authenticity of the doctoral privileges, issued by the Collegio di Salerno, was attested by the notary, and was necessary to teach the subject. A doctorate not only had the examination date but also the year of the Pope&#x27;s accession. This was because the civil calendar varied by state, but not the papal date, especially as regards the diplomas of graduates in foreign countries. The diplomas always bore the seal of the college in wax. In the middle of these circular seals is clearly visible the coat of arms of the city, represented by the patron Saint Matthew in the act of writing the Gospel.

Many Salernitan works were lost. The masters of the school have the great merit of dictating for the first time the norms that the doctor must follow when he is at the patient&#x27;s bed. They are a precious document that reveals how dedicated were these teachers to the physician&#x27;s mission and their spirit of observation and profound knowledge of the human body.

==School professors==
It is necessary to make a distinction between &quot;medicus&quot; and &quot;medicus et clericus&quot; because they mark two distinct periods of Salerno medicine. A medicus was the traditional physician who practiced &quot;empiricism&quot;, and he uses concoctions to help the patient. Medicus et clericus is a &quot;doctor&quot; in the original sense of a scholar of art and doctrine. With Garioponto (who studied the ancient Latin writers who followed Hippocrates and Galen) Salernitan medicine begins its golden age. We see for the first time a woman, the famous Trotula de Ruggiero, who ascends to the honors of the chair, and gives instructions to women in labor. At the beginning of 1000 A.D. in Salerno there was a well-ordered school or society which arose by practitioners of medical disciplines. The first constitution of the Societas was formed by those &quot;jatrophysici&quot;, who took office on the hill &quot;Bonae diei&quot; and &quot;Salernitam Scholam scripsere&quot;, laid the foundations of that school and leaving to posterity the &quot;Flos Medicinae&quot;, a monument of greatness and piety.

The teaching of medicine in Salerno in the Middle Ages was carried out by private professors whose name was assigned to doctors. At that time the number of doctors was low, and many simply followed the traditional family cure from several generations. The Schola was an institute with an independent organization, consisting of teachers with particular merit and was responsible for the &quot;Praeses&quot;. It was a merit of seniority when the Prior was created as the supreme dignity of the college. But the Praeses had nothing in common with the Prior, since its authority came later within the college.

The medical doctrines spread by Garioponto and his contemporaries did not disappear with them; other masters followed their footsteps. In the second half of the twelfth century three illustrious masters honored their predecessors: Master Salerno, Matteo Plateario junior and Musandino. Salerno&#x27;s &quot;Tabulae Salernitanae&quot; and &quot;Compendium&quot; formulated a general therapy and drug preparation treatment. Matteo Plateario junior wrote &quot;Glosse Platearium&quot;, where he describes plants and various medicinal products.

Musandino is the renowned master, destined to spread the dogmas of medicine. Other eminent figures were Romualdo Guarna, who was called twice to the bedside of William I of Sicily, and Antonio Solimena, who treated Queen Joanna II of Naples at the end of the 14th century. Distinguished for his doctrine, he was raised to the high office of &quot;Maestro Razionale della Magna Curia&quot;. Another noble figure was Giovanni da Procida.

There are many Salernitan masters in the centuries who lent their work to war operations. At the service of the army of Robert of Anjou, Duke of Calabria, operating in Sicily in 1299 there are Bartolomeo de Vallona and Filippo Fundacario.

==Other legends==
===Legend of the Poor Henry===

This most celebrated legend was handed down by the medieval German minstrels, and written in the 1190s as the narrative poem &quot;Der arme Heinrich&quot; (Poor Henry) by Hartmann von Aue. The story was then &quot;rediscovered&quot; by Longfellow and published as &quot;The Golden Legend&quot; (1851). Henry, prince of Germany, was a beautiful and strong young man, engaged with the young princess Elsie. One day, however, he was struck by leprosy and began to swell quickly, so that the subjects, seeing him now destined to certain death, renamed him &quot;Poor Henry&quot;. The prince had a dream one night: the devil personally suggested that he be taken care of by the Salernitian doctors, intimating to him that he would only be healed if he had bathed in the blood of a young virgin who had died for him voluntarily. Though Elsie was immediately offered for the horrific sacrifice, Henry refused disdainfully, preferring to listen to the doctors&#x27; opinion. After a long voyage, the whole court came to Salerno and Henry, before attending the Medical school, wanted to go to the Cathedral to pray on the tomb of St. Matthew. Here, in a vision, he found himself miraculously cured of evil and married Elsie on the same altar of the saint.

===Legend of Robert and Sibylla===

Another tradition is that of the Legend of Robert of Normandy and Sibylla of Conversano. During the crusades, Robert was struck by a poisoned arrow. Because his condition had become serious, he returned to Salerno to consult physicians, whose response was drastic: the only way to save his life was to suck away the poison from the wound, but who would have done it would have died in his place. Roberto dismissed everyone, preferring to die, but his wife Sibylla of Conversano sucked his poison over the night, dying for her beloved husband. This legend is depicted in a miniature on the cover of the Canon of Avicenna, in which one sees Roberto with his court, who greets and thanks the doctors at the gates of the city, while in the background the ships are ready to go; on the left, four other doctors deal with Sibylla, recognizable by the crown, struck down by poison.

<text>The Jumblatt family (, originally  , meaning &quot;steel-bodied&quot; or &quot;soul of steel&quot;), also transliterated as Joumblatt and Junblat) is a prominent Druze family based in the Chouf area of Mount Lebanon which has dominated Druze politics since the 18th century. The current head of the family is veteran politician Walid Jumblatt, the son and successor of Kamal Jumblatt, one of the most influential figures in modern Lebanese politics. Other members of the family have contributed to cultural, economic and social life in Lebanon. Khaled Jumblatt, a distant cousin of Walid Jumblatt, held the position of minister of economy and was a prominent politician in Lebanon for many years until his death in 1993. Besides the Chouf, the family owns mansions and villas within the distinguished Clemenceau area of Beirut and in the northwest area of Sidon.

==History==
===Origins===
The scholarly consensus of the Jumblatts&#x27; origins is based on the history of the local, 19th-century chronicler Tannus al-Shidyaq, with some variation. Shidyaq cited genealogical records and oral traditions, sourced mainly to the Druze chief Sheikh Khattar Talhuq. Kamal Jumblatt, the head of the Jumblatt family in the mid-20th century, generally accepts this narrative to be authentic.

In the main, the Jumblatts are regarded as descendants or relatives of Ali Janbulad, the Kurdish tribal leader and rebel Ottoman governor of Aleppo, who settled in the Chouf region of Mount Lebanon not long after Ali&#x27;s defeat, imprisonment, and execution in 1607–1611. &#x27;Jumblatt&#x27;, or rather &#x27;Junblat&#x27;, is the Arabic version of the Kurdish &#x27;Janbulad&#x27;. Ali had been an ally of the paramount Druze emir, the governor and tax farmer Fakhr al-Din II of the Ma&#x27;n dynasty. Shidyaq holds that after Ali&#x27;s defeat, the Janbulad family was dispersed, and names two members, Janbulad ibn Sa&#x27;id and his son Rabah, as having sought shelter in Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s territory, arriving in Beirut in 1630. While Shidyaq calls Janbulad a nephew of Ali, the historian Pierre Rondot speculates that he was Ali&#x27;s grandson. The father and son were invited by the local notables to settle in the village of Mazraat al-Shuf. Rabah remained in the village as a reputable figure after his father&#x27;s death and was survived by his sons Ali, Faris and Sharaf al-Din.

The family&#x27;s social status was raised when Ali married a woman of the noble Tanukh family, the daughter of Qabalan al-Qadi, the chief of the Chouf. Ali then moved to the village of Baadarane and built his residence there. When Qabalan died, the Druze sheikhs of the Chouf requested and paid 25,000 piasters to the Ma&#x27;ns&#x27; successor, the Shihab emir Haydar, to make Ali the paramount sheikh and tax farmer for their region. As the inheritor of Qabalan&#x27;s fortune, Ali used his newfound wealth and prestige to benefit the common folk of the Chouf, thereby boosting his status. He backed Haydar against his Druze opponents in the decisive Battle of Ain Dara in 1711. The modern sources offer variant dates for the events of Ali&#x27;s life, with Shidyaq claiming Qabalan died in 1712, Rondot claiming Ali died in 1712, the historian Selim Hichi claiming Ali married Qabalan&#x27;s daughter in 1712, and Kamal Jumblatt claiming Rabah had married the daughter.

The historian Abdul-Rahim Abu-Husayn has cast doubt about every aspect of the conventional narrative. He cites the existence of a leading Druze sheikh in the Chouf named &#x27;Junblat&#x27; around 1614, who is mentioned by Ahmad al-Khalidi, the contemporary chronicler and court historian of Fakhr al-Din. This Junblat and his following were in conflict with a rival Druze sheikh of the Chouf, Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s close ally Yazbak ibn Abd al-Afif, during that year, when the governor of Damascus, Hafiz Ahmed Pasha, was leading a campaign against the Ma&#x27;ns. Khalidi hints that the Junblat-Yazbak conflict, which may have been tribo-political in nature, preceded Ahmed Pasha&#x27;s campaign. Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s brother Yunus imprisoned Junblat in the Ma&#x27;nid fortress of Shaqif Arnun for attacking Yazbak; according to the account of a local Maronite sheikh, Shayban al-Khazen, Junblat&#x27;s specific offense was physically beating Yazbak. After a short period, Yunus released Junblat, whose partisans are mentioned by Khalidi as having answered summons by a victorious Ahmed Pasha and then returning to their villages with &quot;striped robes of honor&quot;. In the assessment of Abu-Husayn, Junblat had used Ahmed Pasha&#x27;s campaign against the Ma&#x27;ns as an opportunity to act against their ally Yazbak and &quot;embarrass&quot; them, for which the Ma&#x27;ns temporarily imprisoned him. In his chronicle, Shidyaq changed the facts of this event into Fakhr al-Din appointing Janbulad ibn Sa&#x27;id to guard Shaqif Arnun for one year against the Bedouin ruler and governor of northern Palestine, Turabay ibn Ali, in 1631.

Seeking to bridge the conflicting narratives, Hichi proposes that Sheikh Junblat was an emigrant from the Janbulad family who arrived in the Chouf before his other relatives, the Janbulad ibn Sa&#x27;id and Rabah of Shidyaq&#x27;s chronicle. The historian William Harris notes that there is &quot;no information on the origin&quot; of Sheikh Junblat &quot;or any link&quot; to the Kurdish Janbulads of Aleppo, but that the name &#x27;Junblat&#x27; does not surface in the historical record before the Ma&#x27;n-backed rebellion of Ali Janbulad.

Regarding their religion, Kamal Jumblatt speculated that the family had already been Druze in the Aleppo region before their arrival in the Chouf and thus did not convert to the Druze religion, which prohibits converts. Abu-Husayn considers this erroneous, as the Kurdish Janbulads were avid Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi school, according to the 17th-century Aleppine historian Abu Wafa al-Urdi. As an apparently well-established chief of the Druze, the most closed off religious group in the Levant, Sheikh Junblat would likely have been from a Druze family rather than a recent convert from Sunni Islam, according to Abu-Husayn.

The conventional narrative holds that the Shihabs conferred on the Jumblatts the status of &#x27;sheikh&#x27;, second to that of &#x27;emir&#x27; in the ranking system of Mount Lebanon&#x27;s feudal nobility. Abu-Husayn also considers this implausible, as the Kurdish Janbulads held princely titles, such as bey or &quot;beylerbey&quot; (Turkish equivalent to emir or &quot;amir al-umara&quot;, respectively), which were bestowed or recognized by the Ottoman government. Thus, the Jumblatts, as descendants of this family, would have regarded themselves as emirs, rather than holding the inferior title of &#x27;sheikh&#x27;.

Abu-Husayn further notes that neither Khalidi nor the prominent 17th-century Maronite historian and associate of the Ma&#x27;ns and Shihabs, Istifan al-Duwayhi, mentions members of the Kurdish Janbulads moving to Mount Lebanon. Abu-Husayn holds it to be unlikely that Sheikh Junblat, had he been a descendant of Janbulad, would have been a major local opponent of Fakhr al-Din, as presented by Khalidi. Rather, as an outsider living under Fakhr al-Din&#x27;s protection, presumably would have been a natural ally. The high political and social status of Sheikh Junblat already in the early 17th century may negate the notion that marriage into Qabalan&#x27;s family was the transformative event that elevated the Jumblatts to this status in the 18th century.

<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, a bifundamental representation is a representation obtained as a tensor product of two fundamental or antifundamental representations.

For example, the &quot;MN&quot;-dimensional representation (&quot;M&quot;,&quot;N&quot;) of the group 
:formula_1 

is a bifundamental representation. 
These representations occur in quiver diagrams.

<text>Erhard Schmidt (13 January 1876 – 6 December 1959) was a Baltic German mathematician whose work significantly influenced the direction of mathematics in the twentieth century. Schmidt was born in Tartu (), in the Governorate of Livonia (now Estonia).

== Mathematics ==
His advisor was David Hilbert and he was awarded his doctorate from University of Göttingen in 1905. His doctoral dissertation was entitled &quot;&quot; and was a work on integral equations. Together with David Hilbert he made important contributions to functional analysis. Ernst Zermelo credited conversations with Schmidt for the idea and method for his classic 1904 proof of the Well-ordering theorem from an &quot;Axiom of choice&quot;, which has become an integral part of modern set theory.

After the war, in 1948, Schmidt founded and became the first editor-in-chief of the journal &quot;&quot;.

== National Socialism ==
During World War II Schmidt held positions of authority at the University of Berlin and had to carry out various Nazi resolutions against the Jews—a job that he apparently did not do well, since he was criticized at one point for not understanding the &quot;Jewish question&quot;. At the celebration of Schmidt&#x27;s 75th birthday in 1951 a prominent Jewish mathematician, Hans Freudenthal, who had survived the Nazi years, spoke of the difficulties that Schmidt faced during that period without criticism. Schmidt was, however, a conservative and a nationalist, and defended Hitler after Kristallnacht, telling Issai Schur that &quot;Suppose we had to fight a war to rearm Germany, unite with Austria, liberate the Saar and the German part of Czechoslovakia. Such a war would have cost us half a million young men. But everybody would have admired our victorious leader. Now, Hitler has sacrificed half a million Jews and has achieved great things for Germany. I hope some day you will be recompensed but I am still grateful to Hitler&quot;.

<text>Yang–Mills theory is a quantum field theory for nuclear binding devised by Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills in 1953, as well as a generic term for the class of similar theories. The Yang–Mills theory is a gauge theory based on a special unitary group , or more generally any compact Lie group. A Yang–Mills theory seeks to describe the behavior of elementary particles using these non-abelian Lie groups and is at the core of the unification of the electromagnetic force and weak forces (i.e. ) as well as quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force (based on ). Thus it forms the basis of the understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics.

== History and qualitative description ==
=== Gauge theory in electrodynamics ===
All known fundamental interactions can be described in terms of gauge theories, but working this out took decades. Hermann Weyl&#x27;s pioneering work on this project started in 1915 when his colleague Emmy Noether proved that every conserved physical quantity has a matching symmetry, and culminated in 1928 when he published his book applying the geometrical theory of symmetry (group theory) to quantum mechanics. Weyl named the relevant symmetry in Noether&#x27;s theorem the &quot;gauge symmetry&quot;, by analogy to distance standardization in railroad gauges.

Erwin Schrödinger in 1922, three years before working on his equation, connected Weyl&#x27;s group concept to electron charge. Schrödinger showed that the group formula_1 produced a phase shift formula_2 in electromagnetic fields that matched the conservation of electric charge. As the theory of quantum electrodynamics developed in the 1930&#x27;s and 1940&#x27;s the formula_1 group transformations played a central role. Many physicists thought there must be an analog for the dynamics of nucleons. 
Chen Ning Yang in particular was obsessed with this possibility.

=== Yang and Mills find the nuclear force gauge theory ===
Yang&#x27;s core idea was to look for a conserved quantity in nuclear physics comparable to electric charge and use it to develop a corresponding gauge theory comparable to electrodynamics. He settled on conservation of isospin, a quantum number that distinguishes a neutron from a proton, but he made no progress on a theory. Taking a break from Princeton in the summer of 1953, Yang met a collaborator who could help: Robert Mills. As Mills himself describes:&quot;During the academic year 1953–1954, Yang was a visitor to Brookhaven National Laboratory ... I was at Brookhaven also ... and was assigned to the same office as Yang. Yang, who has demonstrated on a number of occasions his generosity to physicists beginning their careers, told me about his idea of generalizing gauge invariance and we discussed it at some length ... I was able to contribute something to the discussions, especially with regard to the quantization procedures, and to a small degree in working out the formalism; however, the key ideas were Yang&#x27;s.&quot;
In the summer 1953, Yang and Mills extended the concept of gauge theory for abelian groups, e.g. quantum electrodynamics, to non-abelian groups, selecting the group to provide an explanation for isospin conservation in collisions involving the strong interactions. Yang&#x27;s presentation of the work at Princeton in February 1954 was challenged by Pauli, asking about the mass in the field developed with the gauge invariance idea. Pauli knew that this might be an issue as he had worked on applying gauge invariance but chose not to publish it, viewing the massless excitations of the theory to be &quot;unphysical &#x27;shadow particles&#x27;&quot;. Yang and Mills published in October 1954; near the end of the paper, they admit:

This problem of unphysical massless excitation blocked further progress.

The idea was set aside until 1960, when the concept of particles acquiring mass through symmetry breaking in massless theories was put forward, initially by Jeffrey Goldstone, Yoichiro Nambu, and Giovanni Jona-Lasinio. This prompted a significant restart of Yang–Mills theory studies that proved successful in the formulation of both electroweak unification and quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The electroweak interaction is described by the gauge group , while QCD is an Yang–Mills theory. The massless gauge bosons of the electroweak mix after spontaneous symmetry breaking to produce the three massive bosons of the weak interaction (, , and ) as well as the still-massless photon field. The dynamics of the photon field and its interactions with matter are, in turn, governed by the gauge theory of quantum electrodynamics. The Standard Model combines the strong interaction with the unified electroweak interaction (unifying the weak and electromagnetic interaction) through the symmetry group . In the current epoch the strong interaction is not unified with the electroweak interaction, but from the observed running of the coupling constants it is believed they all converge to a single value at very high energies.

Phenomenology at lower energies in quantum chromodynamics is not completely understood due to the difficulties of managing such a theory with a strong coupling. This may be the reason why confinement has not been theoretically proven, though it is a consistent experimental observation. This shows why QCD confinement at low energy is a mathematical problem of great relevance, and why the Yang–Mills existence and mass gap problem is a Millennium Prize Problem.

=== Parallel work on non-Abelian gauge theories ===
In 1953, in a private correspondence, Wolfgang Pauli formulated a six-dimensional theory of Einstein&#x27;s field equations of general relativity, extending the five-dimensional theory of Kaluza, Klein, Fock, and others to a higher-dimensional internal space. However, there is no evidence that Pauli developed the Lagrangian of a gauge field or the quantization of it. Because Pauli found that his theory &quot;leads to some rather unphysical shadow particles&quot;, he refrained from publishing his results formally. Although Pauli did not publish his six-dimensional theory, he gave two seminar lectures about it in Zürich in November 1953.

In January 1954 Ronald Shaw, a graduate student at the University of Cambridge also developed a non-Abelian gauge theory for nuclear forces.
However, the theory needed massless particles in order to maintain gauge invariance. Since no such massless particles were known at the time, Shaw and his supervisor Abdus Salam chose not to publish their work.
Shortly after Yang and Mills published their paper in October 1954, Salam encouraged Shaw to publish his work to mark his contribution. Shaw declined, and instead it only forms a chapter of his PhD thesis published in 1956.

== Mathematical overview ==

Yang–Mills theories are special examples of gauge theories with a non-abelian symmetry group given by the Lagrangian

:formula_4

with the generators formula_5 of the Lie algebra, indexed by , corresponding to the -quantities (the curvature or field-strength form) satisfying
:formula_6

Here, the are structure constants of the Lie algebra (totally antisymmetric if the generators of the Lie algebra are normalised such that formula_7 is proportional to formula_8), the covariant derivative is defined as

:formula_9

 is the identity matrix (matching the size of the generators), formula_10 is the vector potential, and is the coupling constant. In four dimensions, the coupling constant is a pure number and for a group one has formula_11

The relation

:formula_12

can be derived by the commutator

:formula_13

The field has the property of being self-interacting and the equations of motion that one obtains are said to be semilinear, as nonlinearities are both with and without derivatives. This means that one can manage this theory only by perturbation theory with small nonlinearities.

Note that the transition between &quot;upper&quot; (&quot;contravariant&quot;) and &quot;lower&quot; (&quot;covariant&quot;) vector or tensor components is trivial for &quot;a&quot; indices (e.g. formula_14), whereas for μ and ν it is nontrivial, corresponding e.g. to the usual Lorentz signature, formula_15

From the given Lagrangian one can derive the equations of motion given by

:formula_16

Putting formula_17 these can be rewritten as

:formula_18

A Bianchi identity holds

:formula_19

which is equivalent to the Jacobi identity

:formula_20

since formula_21 Define the dual strength tensor
formula_22 then the Bianchi identity can be rewritten as

:formula_23

A source formula_24 enters into the equations of motion as

:formula_25

Note that the currents must properly change under gauge group transformations.

We give here some comments about the physical dimensions of the coupling. In dimensions, the field scales as formula_26 and so the coupling must scale as formula_27 This implies that Yang–Mills theory is not renormalizable for dimensions greater than four. Furthermore, for the coupling is dimensionless and both the field and the square of the coupling have the same dimensions of the field and the coupling of a massless quartic scalar field theory. So, these theories share the scale invariance at the classical level.

== Quantization ==
A method of quantizing the Yang–Mills theory is by functional methods, i.e. path integrals. One introduces a generating functional for -point functions as

:formula_28

but this integral has no meaning as it is because the potential vector can be arbitrarily chosen due to the gauge freedom. This problem was already known for quantum electrodynamics but here becomes more severe due to non-abelian properties of the gauge group. A way out has been given by Ludvig Faddeev and Victor Popov with the introduction of a &quot;ghost field&quot; (see Faddeev–Popov ghost) that has the property of being unphysical since, although it agrees with Fermi–Dirac statistics, it is a complex scalar field, which violates the spin–statistics theorem. So, we can write the generating functional as

:formula_29

being

:formula_30

for the field,

:formula_31

for the gauge fixing and

:formula_32

for the ghost. This is the expression commonly used to derive Feynman&#x27;s rules (see Feynman diagram). Here we have for the ghost field while fixes the gauge&#x27;s choice for the quantization. Feynman&#x27;s rules obtained from this functional are the following

These rules for Feynman&#x27;s diagrams can be obtained when the generating functional given above is rewritten as

:formula_33

with

:formula_34

being the generating functional of the free theory. Expanding in and computing the functional derivatives, we are able to obtain all the -point functions with perturbation theory. Using LSZ reduction formula we get from the -point functions the corresponding process amplitudes, cross sections and decay rates. The theory is renormalizable and corrections are finite at any order of perturbation theory.

For quantum electrodynamics the ghost field decouples because the gauge group is abelian. This can be seen from the coupling between the gauge field and the ghost field that is formula_35 For the abelian case, all the structure constants formula_36 are zero and so there is no coupling. In the non-abelian case, the ghost field appears as a useful way to rewrite the quantum field theory without physical consequences on the observables of the theory such as cross sections or decay rates.

One of the most important results obtained for Yang–Mills theory is asymptotic freedom. This result can be obtained by assuming that the coupling constant is small (so small nonlinearities), as for high energies, and applying perturbation theory. The relevance of this result is due to the fact that a Yang–Mills theory that describes strong interaction and asymptotic freedom permits proper treatment of experimental results coming from deep inelastic scattering.

To obtain the behavior of the Yang–Mills theory at high energies, and so to prove asymptotic freedom, one applies perturbation theory assuming a small coupling. This is verified a posteriori in the ultraviolet limit. In the opposite limit, the infrared limit, the situation is the opposite, as the coupling is too large for perturbation theory to be reliable. Most of the difficulties that research meets is just managing the theory at low energies. That is the interesting case, being inherent to the description of hadronic matter and, more generally, to all the observed bound states of gluons and quarks and their confinement (see hadrons). The most used method to study the theory in this limit is to try to solve it on computers (see lattice gauge theory). In this case, large computational resources are needed to be sure the correct limit of infinite volume (smaller lattice spacing) is obtained. This is the limit the results must be compared with. Smaller spacing and larger coupling are not independent of each other, and larger computational resources are needed for each. As of today, the situation appears somewhat satisfactory for the hadronic spectrum and the computation of the gluon and ghost propagators, but the glueball and hybrids spectra are yet a questioned matter in view of the experimental observation of such exotic states. Indeed, the resonance
is not seen in any of such lattice computations and contrasting interpretations have been put forward. This is a hotly debated issue.

== Open problems ==
Yang–Mills theories met with general acceptance in the physics community after Gerard &#x27;t Hooft, in 1972, worked out their renormalization, relying on a formulation of the problem worked out by his advisor Martinus Veltman.
Renormalizability is obtained even if the gauge bosons described by this theory are massive, as in the electroweak theory, provided the mass is only an &quot;acquired&quot; one, generated by the Higgs mechanism.

The mathematics of the Yang–Mills theory is a very active field of research, yielding e.g. invariants of differentiable structures on four-dimensional manifolds via work of Simon Donaldson. Furthermore, the field of Yang–Mills theories was included in the Clay Mathematics Institute&#x27;s list of &quot;Millennium Prize Problems&quot;. Here the prize-problem consists, especially, in a proof of the conjecture that the lowest excitations of a pure Yang–Mills theory (i.e. without matter fields) have a finite mass-gap with regard to the vacuum state. Another open problem, connected with this conjecture, is a proof of the confinement property in the presence of additional fermions.

In physics the survey of Yang–Mills theories does not usually start from perturbation analysis or analytical methods, but more recently from systematic application of numerical methods to lattice gauge theories.

<doc id="672206" wikidata="Q236968" url="?curid=672206" title="Sandra Kalniete">
<text>Sandra Kalniete (born 22 December 1952) is a Latvian politician, author, diplomat and independence movement leader. She served as Foreign Minister of Latvia 2002–2004 and as European Commissioner for Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries in 2004. Since 2009, she has served as Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the European People&#x27;s Party.

She is currently a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) and a substitute member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI).
Additionally she is a member on the Delegation for relations with the countries of Southeast Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and a substitute member on the Delegation to the EU-Ukraine Parliamentary Cooperation Committee and on the Delegation to the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly.

After her reelection in 2014, she became Vice-Chair of the Group of the European People&#x27;s Party in the European Parliament.

Kalniete is also the chairperson of the Reconciliation of European Histories Group, an all-party group in the European Parliament involved in promoting the Prague Process. The group includes 40 MEPs from across the political spectrum including the European People&#x27;s Party, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, the Greens, and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats.

She has previously served as Ambassador to the United Nations (1993–97), France (1997–2000) and UNESCO (2000–02). Beside her native Latvian language, she is also fluent in English, French and Russian.

==Early life and education==

Kalniete was born in , Kolpashevsky District, Tomsk Oblast, Siberia, Russia, where her family had been deported from Latvia by the Soviet secret police during the occupation of her country by the Soviet Union, for use as slave labour. Her mother Ligita Kalniete (née Dreifelde, 1926-2006) was first deported together with her mother and father in 1941, after which Ligita returned in 1948, just to be deported again in 1949. Her father Aivars Kalnietis (born 1931) was deported together with his mother in 1949 as well. She only saw her native country when she was five years old, when the family was allowed to return in 1957.

She studied art at the Latvian Academy of Art from 1977 to 1981 and worked as an art historian, publishing a book, &quot;Latvian Textile Art&quot;, in 1989.

==Early career==
She entered politics in 1988, during Latvia&#x27;s independence movement, and was a deputy chairwoman and one of the founders of Latvian Popular Front, the main pro-independence political organization. Ms. Kalniete graduated from the Department of Art History and Art Theory at the Art Academy of Latvia (1981), the Institute for International Studies at the University of Leeds (1992), The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies - now Geneva Graduate Institute - (1995), and has a Master of Arts from the Art Academy of Latvia (1996). The Geneva Graduate Institute later dedicated to her a place in its Hall of Inspiring Stories.

After Latvia declared independence, Kalniete worked in Latvia&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and served as Latvia&#x27;s ambassador to the UN (from 1993 to 1997), France (from 1997 to 2000) and UNESCO (from 2000 to 2002).

==Political career==
Kalniete became Foreign Minister of Latvia in November 2002 and served in this position until in 2004 when she was appointed the first Latvian Commissioner of the European Union in charge of Agriculture and Fisheries.

She was not re-nominated as Latvia&#x27;s EU Commissioner.

At the beginning of 2006, Kalniete joined the New Era Party. In October 2006, she was elected to the Latvian parliament. She was the 2007 candidate of the New Era Party for the post of Latvian president, before withdrawing in favor of Aivars Endziņš on 24 May 2007.

Between 2006 and 2007, Kalniete served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters.

In 2008, Kalniete announced she was leaving the New Era Party. She joined the newly founded Civic Union and became the party&#x27;s leader. 
In the 2009 European Parliament election she was elected as a Member of the European Parliament and reelected in the 2014 European Parliament election in Latvia. She put herself forward as a potential candidate to succeed Andris Bērziņš as President of Latvia after his decision to step down in 2015.

She was reelected as a Member of the European Parliament and in the 2019 European Parliament election in Latvia.

She was mentioned as a possible candidate for the 2023 Latvian presidential election.

She was reelected once again as a Member of the European Parliament and in the 2024 European Parliament election in Latvia.

==Human rights activism==
Kalniete is involved in many human rights causes pertaining to totalitarian crimes. She is the chair of the Reconciliation of European Histories Group, an all-party group in the European Parliament aimed at coming to terms with the totalitarian past in many countries of Europe.

In 2004, she argued that &quot;behind the Iron Curtain the Soviet regime continued to commit genocide against the peoples of Eastern Europe and, indeed, against its own people [...] the two totalitarian regimes—Nazism and Communism—were equally criminal.&quot; She elaborated on this in 2006 when she came up with death counts for the two regimes, pointing out that the Soviet Union killed around 94.5 million people.

==Publications==
She is an author of four books:
* &quot;Latviešu tekstilmāksla&quot; (&quot;Latvian Textile Art&quot;), 1989.
* &quot;Es lauzu, tu lauzi, mēs lauzām. Viņi lūza&quot; (&quot;I Broke, You Broke, We Broke. They Fell Apart&quot;), a book about Latvia&#x27;s independence movement, published in 2000.
* &quot;Ar balles kurpēm Sibīrijas sniegos&quot; (&quot;With Dancing Shoes in Siberian Snows&quot;), a book about the deportation of her family to Siberia during the Joseph Stalin era and her family&#x27;s efforts to return to their home country, first published in 2001.
* &quot;Prjaņiks. Debesmannā. Tiramisū.&quot; (Pryanik. Semolina mousse. Tiramisu), Rīga, Zelta grauds, 2012.

The French translation of &quot;With Dancing Shoes in Siberian Snows&quot; published in 2003 by &quot;Editions des Syrtes&quot; as &quot;En escarpins dans les neiges de Sibérie&quot; was nominated for the &quot;Aocumentary Book of the Month&quot; for December by the readers of &quot;Elle&quot; magazine. Since its publishing it has been translated into more than ten languages.

<text>Jonathan Whitcombe (born 19 April 1977) is an English professional wrestler, better known by his ring name Jonny Storm. He has worked for many independent promotions across the United Kingdom, including the Frontier Wrestling Alliance, Real Quality Wrestling and One Pro Wrestling. He has also worked in the United States, for promotions such as Ring of Honor, Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, Combat Zone Wrestling, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, as well as working in Japan.

==Professional wrestling career==

===British and other European promotions===
At the start of his career, Storm became a mainstay in the Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA). He also competed for All-Star Wrestling. Storm began wrestling for Irish Whip Wrestling in March 2005, where he had a series of matches against M-Dogg 20. Storm was one of the trainers for ITV&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Wrestling&quot; in 2005. Although the show was considered a failure, Storm enjoyed it and said it was &quot;a really good experience&quot;. Storm has wrestled for numerous other European promotions, including German Stampede Wrestling, Real Quality Wrestling, Rings of Europe and Dutch Championship Wrestling. Also in 2005, he won the Féderation Francophone de Catch promotion&#x27;s top championship, which he has held since.

One of Storm&#x27;s most enduring feuds has been with his real-life best friend Jody Fleisch, with whom he has wrestled against in American and British promotions. He has also wrestled regularly for One Pro Wrestling, where, with Fleisch, he was the one half of the first 1PW Tag Team Champions, after they defeated A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels in a tournament final on 27 May 2006. On 1 January 2007, he won the Athletik Club Wrestling Wrestling Challenge Championship from Toby Nathland, but Nathland defeated him to win it back on 15 December 2007. On 23 March 2007, Storm defeated Maddog Maxx to win the Celtic Wrestling Heavyweight Championship, but he lost it to Maxx in July of that year.

In 2015, Storm began appearing for Insane Championship Wrestling. In 2019, he lost to Kieran Kelly at ICW I Ain&#x27;t Yer Pal, Dickface! and challenged for the ICW Tag Team Championships.
Storm runs his own wrestling holiday camp events between 6 and 12 times a week during summer, Easter and Christmas Holidays. Meanwhile, in the FWA he is currently part of the Flyweight Title Round Robin Tournament, having gained entry into the tournament thanks to another wrestler suffering an injury. He was involved in a bitter feud with Rockstar Spud, an obnoxious flyweight who believed he is the new &quot;Wonderkid&quot; of British wrestling.

===American promotions===

Storm competed in Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW), and was in the tournament to decide the first XPW European Champion, which was created in 2003 through a working relationship between XPW and the FWA. He won the tournament and the championship by defeating Jerry Lynn in the finals at a FWA show in England. Storm made his first appearance for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on 12 March 2003, by competing in a triple threat match for TNA X Division Championship match, against the champion Kid Kash and Amazing Red, in which Kash retained. In May 2003, Storm competed in a cross-promotional show between Ring of Honor and FWA, entitled &quot;ROH/FWA Frontiers of Honor&quot;, where he lost to A.J. Styles. In September 2003, Storm competed as a member of Team UK during the TNA 2003 Super X Cup Tournament, losing to Teddy Hart in the first round. At the Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) show, &quot;Respect&quot;, on 23 August 2003, Storm challenged Sonjay Dutt for the IWA Mid-South Light Heavyweight Championship, but was unsuccessful. He made further appearance for CZW in January 2004. He returned to the States in 2005, wrestling against Petey Williams and Kevin Steen for Pro Wrestling Guerrilla, and against Trik Davis for Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South. He was supposed to be a member of Team UK in the TNA 2006 World X Cup Tournament, however, two of the other members of the team, Nigel McGuinness and Doug Williams were already booked in Japan, and so they were replaced by Team Canada.

Overall Storm worked for more than 80 promotions across the world, working in 16 different countries.

===Trainer===
Storm has also trained other wrestlers, most notably Erin Marshall.

<text>In nuclear physics and particle physics, isospin (I) is a quantum number related to the up- and down quark content of the particle. 
Isospin is also known as isobaric spin or isotopic spin.
Isospin symmetry is a subset of the flavour symmetry seen more broadly in the interactions of baryons and mesons.

The name of the concept contains the term &quot;spin&quot; because its quantum mechanical description is mathematically similar to that of angular momentum (in particular, in the way it couples; for example, a proton–neutron pair can be coupled either in a state of total isospin 1 or in one of 0). But unlike angular momentum, it is a dimensionless quantity and is not actually any type of spin.

Before the concept of quarks was introduced, particles that are affected equally by the strong force but had different charges (e.g. protons and neutrons) were considered different states of the same particle, but having isospin values related to the number of charge states. A close examination of isospin symmetry ultimately led directly to the discovery and understanding of quarks and to the development of Yang–Mills theory. Isospin symmetry remains an important concept in particle physics.

== Isospin invariance ==
To a good approximation the proton and neutron have the same mass: they can be interpreted as two states of the same particle. These states have different values for an internal isospin coordinate. The mathematical properties of this coordinate are completely analogous to intrinsic spin angular momentum. The component of the operator, formula_1, for this coordinate has eigenvalues + and −; it is related to the charge operator, formula_2:
formula_3
which has eigenvalues formula_4 for the proton and zero for the neutron. For a system of n nucleons, the charge operator depends upon the mass number A:
formula_5
Isobars, nuclei with the same mass number like 40K and 40Ar, only differ in the value of the formula_1 eigenvalue. For this reason isospin is also called &quot;isobaric spin&quot;.

The internal structure of these nucleons is governed by the strong interaction, but the Hamiltonian of the strong interaction is isospin invariant. As a consequence the nuclear forces are charge independent. Properties like the stability of deuterium can be predicted based on isospin analysis. However,
this invariance is not exact and the quark model gives more precise results.

== Relation to hypercharge ==
The charge operator can be expressed in terms of the projection of isospin formula_7 and hypercharge, formula_8:
formula_9
This is known as the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula. The hypercharge is the center of splitting for the isospin multiplet:
formula_10
This relation has an analog in the weak interaction where T is the weak isospin.

== Quark content and isospin ==
In the modern formulation, isospin () is defined as a vector quantity in which up and down quarks have a value of  = , with the 3rd-component (3) being + for up quarks, and − for down quarks, while all other quarks have  = 0. Therefore, for hadrons in general, where u and d are the numbers of up and down quarks respectively,
: formula_11

In any combination of quarks, the 3rd component of the isospin vector (3) could either be aligned between a pair of quarks, or face the opposite direction, giving different possible values for total isospin for any combination of quark flavours. Hadrons with the same quark content but different total isospin can be distinguished experimentally, verifying that flavour is actually a vector quantity, not a scalar (up vs down simply being a projection in the quantum mechanical  axis of flavour space).

For example, a strange quark can be combined with an up and a down quark to form a baryon, but there are two different ways the isospin values can combine either adding (due to being flavour-aligned) or cancelling out (due to being in opposite flavour directions). The isospin-1 state (the ) and the isospin-0 state (the ) have different experimentally detected masses and half-lives.

===Isospin and symmetry===
Isospin is regarded as a symmetry of the strong interaction under the action of the Lie group SU(2), the two states being the up flavour and down flavour. In quantum mechanics, when a Hamiltonian has a symmetry, that symmetry manifests itself through a set of states that have the same energy (the states are described as being &quot;degenerate&quot;). In simple terms, the energy operator for the strong interaction gives the same result when an up quark and an otherwise identical down quark are swapped around.

Like the case for regular spin, the isospin operator I is vector-valued: it has three components I&quot;x&quot;, I&quot;y&quot;, I&quot;z&quot;, which are coordinates in the same 3-dimensional vector space where the 3 representation acts. Note that this vector space has nothing to do with the physical space, except similar mathematical formalism. Isospin is described by two quantum numbers: the total isospin, and 3 an eigenvalue of the I&quot;z&quot; projection for which flavor states are eigenstates. In other words, each 3 state specifies certain flavor state of a multiplet. The third coordinate (), to which the &quot;3&quot; subscript refers, is chosen due to notational conventions that relate bases in 2 and 3 representation spaces. Namely, for the spin- case, components of I are equal to Pauli matrices divided by 2, and so I&quot;z&quot; =  3, where

: formula_12

While the forms of these matrices are isomorphic to those of spin, &quot;these&quot; Pauli matrices only act within the Hilbert space of isospin, not that of spin, and therefore is common to denote them with τ rather than σ to avoid confusion.

Although isospin symmetry is actually very slightly broken, SU(3) symmetry is more badly broken, due to the much higher mass of the strange quark compared to the up and down. The discovery of charm, bottomness and topness could lead to further expansions up to SU(6) flavour symmetry, which would hold if all six quarks were identical. However, the very much larger masses of the charm, bottom, and top quarks means that SU(6) flavour symmetry is very badly broken in nature (at least at low energies), and assuming this symmetry leads to qualitatively and quantitatively incorrect predictions. In modern applications, such as lattice QCD, isospin symmetry is often treated as exact for the three light quarks (uds), while the three heavy quarks (cbt) must be treated separately.

===Hadron nomenclature===

Hadron nomenclature is based on isospin.
* Particles of total isospin are named Delta baryons and can be made by a combination of any three up or down quarks (but only up or down quarks).
* Particles of total isospin 1 can be made from two up quarks, two down quarks, or one of each:
** certain mesons further differentiated by total spin into pions (total spin 0) and rho mesons (total spin 1)
** with an additional quark of higher flavour Sigma baryons
* Particles of total isospin can be made from:
** a single up or down quark together with an additional quark of higher flavour strange (kaons), charm (D meson), or bottom (B meson)
** a single up or down quark together with two additional quarks of higher flavour Xi baryon
** an up quark, a down quark, and either an up or a down quark nucleons. Note that three identical quarks would be forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle due to requirement of anti-symmetric wave function
* Particles of total isospin 0 can be made from
** a neutral quark-antiquark pair: formula_13 or formula_14) + c_2(\mathrm{s\bar{s}})&lt;/math&gt; for an isospin-0 combination, as formula_15 yields formula_16|group=note}} eta mesons
** one up quark and one down quark, with an additional quark of higher flavour Lambda baryons
** anything not involving any up or down quarks

==History==

===Origin of isospin===

In 1932, Werner Heisenberg introduced a new (unnamed) concept to explain binding of the proton and the then newly discovered neutron (symbol n). His model resembled the bonding model for molecule Hydrogen ion, H2+: a single electron was shared by two protons.
Heisenberg&#x27;s theory had several problems, most notable it incorrectly predicted the exceptionally strong binding energy of He+2, alpha particles. However, its equal treatment of the proton and neutron gained significance when several experimental studies showed these particles must bind almost equally. In response, Eugene Wigner used Heisenberg&#x27;s concept in his 1937 paper where he introduced the term &quot;isotopic spin&quot; to indicate how the concept is similar to spin in behavior.

=== The particle zoo ===

These considerations would also prove useful in the analysis of meson-nucleon interactions after the discovery of the pions in 1947. The three pions (, , ) could be assigned to an isospin triplet with and . By assuming that isospin was conserved by nuclear interactions, the new mesons were more easily accommodated by nuclear theory.

As further particles were discovered, they were assigned into isospin multiplets according to the number of different charge states seen: 2 doublets of K mesons (, ), (, ), a triplet of Sigma baryons (, , ), a singlet Lambda baryon (), a quartet Delta baryons (, , , ), and so on.

The power of isospin symmetry and related methods comes from the observation that families of particles with similar masses tend to correspond to the invariant subspaces associated with the irreducible representations of the Lie algebra SU(2). In this context, an invariant subspace is spanned by basis vectors which correspond to particles in a family. Under the action of the Lie algebra SU(2), which generates rotations in isospin space, elements corresponding to definite particle states or superpositions of states can be rotated into each other, but can never leave the space (since the subspace is in fact invariant). This is reflective of the symmetry present. The fact that unitary matrices will commute with the Hamiltonian means that the physical quantities calculated do not change even under unitary transformation. In the case of isospin, this machinery is used to reflect the fact that the mathematics of the strong force behaves the same if a proton and neutron are swapped around (in the modern formulation, the up and down quark).

====An example: Delta baryons====

For example, the particles known as the Delta baryons baryons of spin were grouped together because they all have nearly the same mass (approximately ) and interact in nearly the same way.

They could be treated as the same particle, with the difference in charge being due to the particle being in different states. Isospin was introduced in order to be the variable that defined this difference of state. In an analogue to spin, an isospin projection (denoted ) is associated to each charged state; since there were four Deltas, four projections were needed. Like spin, isospin projections were made to vary in increments of 1. Hence, in order to have four increments of 1, an isospin value of is required (giving the projections ). Thus, all the Deltas were said to have isospin , and each individual charge had different (e.g. the was associated with ).

In the isospin picture, the four Deltas and the two nucleons were thought to simply be the different states of two particles. The Delta baryons are now understood to be made of a mix of three up and down quarks uuu (), uud (), udd (), and ddd (); the difference in charge being difference in the charges of up and down quarks (+ &quot;e&quot; and − &quot;e&quot; respectively); yet, they can also be thought of as the excited states of the nucleons.

=== Gauged isospin symmetry ===

Attempts have been made to promote isospin from a global to a local symmetry. In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills suggested that the notion of protons and neutrons, which are continuously rotated into each other by isospin, should be allowed to vary from point to point. To describe this, the proton and neutron direction in isospin space must be defined at every point, giving local basis for isospin. A gauge connection would then describe how to transform isospin along a path between two points.

This Yang–Mills theory describes interacting vector bosons, like the photon of electromagnetism. Unlike the photon, the SU(2) gauge theory would contain self-interacting gauge bosons. The condition of gauge invariance suggests that they have zero mass, just as in electromagnetism.

Ignoring the massless problem, as Yang and Mills did, the theory makes a firm prediction: the vector particle should couple to all particles of a given isospin &quot;universally&quot;. The coupling to the nucleon would be the same as the coupling to the kaons. The coupling to the pions would be the same as the self-coupling of the vector bosons to themselves.

When Yang and Mills proposed the theory, there was no candidate vector boson. J. J. Sakurai in 1960 predicted that there should be a massive vector boson which is coupled to isospin, and predicted that it would show universal couplings. The rho mesons were discovered a short time later, and were quickly identified as Sakurai&#x27;s vector bosons. The couplings of the rho to the nucleons and to each other were verified to be universal, as best as experiment could measure. The fact that the diagonal isospin current contains part of the electromagnetic current led to the prediction of rho-photon mixing and the concept of vector meson dominance, ideas which led to successful theoretical pictures of GeV-scale photon-nucleus scattering.

===The introduction of quarks===

The discovery and subsequent analysis of additional particles, both mesons and baryons, made it clear that the concept of isospin symmetry could be broadened to an even larger symmetry group, now called flavor symmetry. Once the kaons and their property of strangeness became better understood, it started to become clear that these, too, seemed to be a part of an enlarged symmetry that contained isospin as a subgroup. The larger symmetry was named the Eightfold Way by Murray Gell-Mann, and was promptly recognized to correspond to the adjoint representation of SU(3). To better understand the origin of this symmetry, Gell-Mann proposed the existence of up, down and strange quarks which would belong to the fundamental representation of the SU(3) flavor symmetry.

In the quark model, the isospin projection (&quot;I&quot;3) followed from the up and down quark content of particles; uud for the proton and udd for the neutron. Technically, the nucleon doublet states are seen to be linear combinations of products of 3-particle isospin doublet states and spin doublet states. That is, the (spin-up) proton wave function, in terms of quark-flavour eigenstates, is described by

formula_17

and the (spin-up) neutron by

formula_18

Here, formula_19 is the up quark flavour eigenstate, and formula_20 is the down quark flavour eigenstate, while formula_21 and formula_22 are the eigenstates of formula_23. Although these superpositions are the technically correct way of denoting a proton and neutron in terms of quark flavour and spin eigenstates, for brevity, they are often simply referred to as &quot;uud&quot; and &quot;udd&quot;. The derivation above assumes exact isospin symmetry and is modified by SU(2)-breaking terms.

Similarly, the isospin symmetry of the pions are given by:

formula_24

Although the discovery of the quarks led to reinterpretation of mesons as a vector bound state of a quark and an antiquark, it is sometimes still useful to think of them as being the gauge bosons of a hidden local symmetry.

==Weak isospin==
In 1961 Sheldon Glashow proposed that a relation similar to the Gell-Mann–Nishijima formula for charge to isospin would also apply to the weak interaction:
formula_25
Here the charge formula_26 is related to the projection of weak isospin formula_7 and the weak hypercharge formula_28.
Isospin and weak isospin are related to the same symmetry but for different forces. Weak isospin is the gauge symmetry of the weak interaction which connects quark and lepton doublets of left-handed particles in all generations; for example, up and down quarks, top and bottom quarks, electrons and electron neutrinos. By contrast (strong) isospin connects only up and down quarks, acts on both chiralities (left and right) and is a global (not a gauge) symmetry.

<doc id="672220" wikidata="Q5246208" url="?curid=672220" title="Dean Headley">
<text>Dean Warren Headley (born 27 January 1970) is a former English professional cricketer who played as a right-arm fast bowler for the England cricket team. Domestically he played for Middlesex and Kent County Cricket Clubs. Headley is now an ECB match referee and the current director of cricket at Blundell&#x27;s School.

== Playing career ==
Headley was born in Stourbridge and comes from a famous cricketing family, being the son of Ron Headley and grandson of George Headley. He was the first Test cricketer to be both the son and grandson of Test cricketers. He was educated at Old Swinford Hospital and then Royal Grammar School Worcester where he excelled at rugby union and cricket.

He played for Worcestershire&#x27;s second team in 1989, and played as a professional for Leycett Cricket Club based in Leycett just outside Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, but his senior debut was in 1991 after he had moved to Middlesex. Clive Lloyd helped him a lot in those early years. In 1993 he moved counties again, this time to Kent. Whilst at Kent he was selected for England, playing Test and ODI cricket between 1996 and 1999. One of his greatest moments was when he won the Man of the Match award for his performance in the 4th Ashes Test in 1998 at Melbourne: Australia was making light work of chasing a target of 175, before Headley took four wickets in three overs to reduce Australia from 130/3 to 140/7; he finished with 6/60 in the innings and England won by 12 runs, their only Test victory on that tour. Due to injury he retired from cricket in 2001.

He played club cricket for Upchurch Cricket Club in Upchurch, Kent and worked as a cricket coach at Stamford School.

==World record==
On 14 September 1996, Dean Headley equalled a world record by taking three hat-tricks in a single English county season. He achieved this feat against Hampshire in Canterbury. He equalled the world record earlier set by Charlie Parker in 1924 and J.S. Rao in 1963–64.

== Personal life ==
The father of three children, Headley enjoys rugby, football, hockey, and golf in his spare time. He&#x27;s also a fan of English football side West Bromwich Albion.

<doc id="672229" wikidata="Q1364004" url="?curid=672229" title="Doug Williams (wrestler)">
<text>Douglas Clayton Durdle (born 1 September 1972), known by his ring name Doug Williams, is an English professional wrestler. He is best known for his work in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, where he was a one–time Television Champion, two–time TNA X Division Champion and a two-time tag team champion, having held the TNA World Tag Team Championship and the IWGP Tag Team Championship once each as part of The British Invasion. He also worked as a trainer for TNA&#x27;s developmental territory Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he was a one-time OVW Heavyweight Champion. Throughout his career, Williams has also worked in various promotions in the United Kingdom and abroad, including the Frontier Wrestling Alliance (FWA), One Pro Wrestling (1PW) and Pro Wrestling Noah.

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===
Williams studied judo from the age of 11. Using this as his background, he began training to become a professional wrestler at the age of 16. At 19 Williams started working with NWA UK Hammerlock and became an active member of the roster during the mid-1990s, before moving on to FWA in 2001.

While competing in FWA&#x27;s King of England tournament, Williams wrestled and won a match against Eddie Guerrero. Williams would also go on to become the promotion&#x27;s top champion on two occasions. Williams wrestled against Martin Stone in the main event of the promotion&#x27;s comeback show &quot;New Frontiers&quot; in August 2009, and has since become embroiled in the ongoing feud between Stone&#x27;s faction &quot;The Agenda&quot; and the FWA Resistance.

By 2004, Williams would begin touring with Pro Wrestling Noah in Japan where he would become a Global Honored Crown Tag Team Champion with Scorpio.

Williams continued to win many foreign and local championships, even defeating &quot;American Dragon&quot; Bryan Danielson in the final of a tournament in Rethel, France on 6 May 2005 to become the first International Catch Wrestling Alliance World Heavyweight Champion.

While World Wrestling Entertainment was touring England in November 2006, Williams made a dark match appearance where he lost to Carlito.

Williams would also appear occasionally on television throughout 2007 and 2008 with British wrestling promotions whilst working with TNA Wrestling, due to the ruling their contracted wrestlers can appear in independent promotions that aren&#x27;t televised in the USA.

===Ring of Honor (2002–2007, 2015)===
Williams went on a tour around the United States on several occasions making notable appearances in Ring of Honor over the course of several years. He debuted for the promotion on 22 June 2002, defeating American Dragon. This victory earned Doug a shot at the ROH World Championship on 27 July 2002, which was fought under ironman rules in a four-way contest, which also featured Christopher Daniels, Low Ki and Spanky.

His return to Ring of Honor saw Williams regain the FWA British Heavyweight Championship from Christopher Daniels, on 22 March 2003, before unsuccessfully challenging Samoa Joe for the ROH World Championship on 26 April 2003. On 19 July 2003, Reckless Youth defeated Doug Williams in a pure wrestling challenge.

After another stint away, Williams returned on 14 February 2004 to defeat Chris Sabin in the pure wrestling tournament, but was later knocked out by CM Punk. On 17 July, in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Williams defeated Jay Lethal, Nigel McGuinness and R. J. Brewer, to qualify for the Pure Wrestling final. The final was contested later that evening, and saw Williams defeat Alex Shelley to capture the Pure Wrestling Championship. Williams had two successful defences of the Pure Wrestling Championship, defeating Shelley in a rematch on 23 July, and Austin Aries the following day. He would go on to lose the title to John Walters on 28 August.

On 11 September, Williams had another unsuccessful shot at the World Championship, which was also against Samoa Joe. On 13 May 2005, Williams once again wrestled in ROH when he teamed with Colt Cabana to defeat the team of Nigel McGuiness and Chad Collyer, before losing to Homicide the next day.

During ROH&#x27;s tour of the United Kingdom in August 2006, Williams teamed with Jody Fleisch as &quot;Team UK&quot;, defeating &quot;Team Noah&quot; (SUWA and Go Shiozaki). The second show of the tour took place in Broxbourne and saw Williams defeat Jimmy Rave.

Williams&#x27; last appearances in ROH were in 2007. On 13 April, Williams teamed with regular partner Nigel McGuinness to face then-World Champion Takeshi Morishima and Chris Hero in a tag team match. McGuinness pinned Hero to win the match for his team. The next night at Fighting Spirit on 14 April, Doug made it two for two by defeating Colt Cabana with his Chaos Theory finisher.

In November 2015, Williams was booked as part of a series of &quot;Supershow&quot; cross-promotion events between Preston City Wrestling and ROH in Preston, England. Williams was victorious against Silas Young on the first night but unsuccessful the second night in a match against Jay Lethal for the ROH World Championship.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling===

====Sporadic appearances (2003, 2008)====

Williams wrestled James Storm on 26 March 2003 during &quot;TNA Xplosion&quot;. It was not until Williams was confirmed to have signed a contract with TNA Wrestling from 12 June 2008 that he became part of their roster to take part in TNA Wrestling&#x27;s World X Cup.

Williams was part of TNA&#x27;s UK tour, wrestling in all four shows. On 12 June 2008, in Liverpool, Williams teamed with Gail Kim, though they fell short in defeat to the team of Awesome Kong and &quot;Cowboy&quot; James Storm. On 13, 14 and 15 June, TNA held a second show in Liverpool, along with others in Coventry and Brentwood. Doug also wrestled on these shows, with multiple 3 Way Dances against Jay Lethal and A.J. Styles. Styles was victorious on all three occasions.

Williams represented Team International during the 2008 World X Cup tournament, where he defeated Team Japan&#x27;s Masato Yoshino in his &quot;Impact!&quot; debut on 10 July 2008. He then wrestled in a 12-Man World X Cup elimination contest, at Victory Road. Williams returned to TNA at Turning Point where he competed in a X Division seeding match. He eliminated Jimmy Rave from the ten-man match, but in the end the eventual winner Eric Young eliminated him placing him third in the X Division rankings. Williams competed on TNA&#x27;s 2009 Maximum Impact Tour in X Division matches.

====British Invasion and World Elite (2009–2010)====
Williams re-appeared on TNA television on 30 April 2009, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, as a member of The British Invasion faction, along with Brutus Magnus and Rob Terry. The British Invasion got to the final of the Team 3D Invitational Tag Team Tournament but lost to Beer Money, Inc. (James Storm and Robert Roode) at Sacrifice. In the dark match of Slammiversary, the British Invasion defeated Rhino and Eric Young. Later that evening, they interfered in the TNA World Tag Title match. At Victory Road, Team 3D retained their IWGP World Tag Team Titles against the British Invasion. On 25 July episode of Impact!, the British Invasion, Sheik Abdul Bashir and Kiyoshi defeated the TNA Originals after Eric Young turned on his team. After the match, Young, the British Invasion, Bashir and Kiyoshi formed World Elite. On 30 July episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams and Magnus won the IWGP Tag Team Championship by defeating Team 3D in a Tables Match. However, New Japan Pro-Wrestling would state that they still recognised Team 3D as the official champions since TNA did not have proper sanction to make the title change. On 10 August 2009, NJPW formally recognised the title switch. At Bound for Glory the British Invasion lost the IWGP Tag Team Titles back to Team 3D, but managed to win the TNA World Tag Team Titles in a four way Full Metal Mayhem Tag Team match against Booker T and Scott Steiner, Team 3D and Beer Money. The following month at Turning Point Williams and Magnus successfully defended the titles in a three-way match against Beer Money and The Motor City Machineguns (Alex Shelley and Chris Sabin). At Final Resolution they were once again able to retain their titles in a match against Shelley and Sabin. At Genesis the British Invasion lost the TNA World Tag Team Titles to Matt Morgan and Hernandez.

====X Division and Television Champion (2010–2011)====

On 28 January episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Williams cashed in Rob Terry&#x27;s &quot;Feast or Fired&quot; briefcase and used it to defeat Amazing Red for the TNA X Division Championship. Two days later Williams competed in his first Ultimate X match at a house show in London, successfully defending his new title against Daniels, Suicide, Amazing Red and Chris Sabin. On 18 February episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Rob Terry grew tired of his stable mates&#x27; abuse and attacked Magnus, thus completing his face turn. At Destination X Williams successfully defended the TNA X Division Championship against Shannon Moore after hitting him with a brick and afterwards cut a promo, where he claimed to hate the current X Division, full of acrobats calling themselves wrestlers, before announcing that he was going to re-establish the division as a place for pure catch-as-catch-can wrestlers like himself. The British Invasion quietly disbanded after Magnus was taken off television following the event. On 5 April episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Williams began using the ring name Douglas Williams. At Lockdown Williams was scheduled to defend his title in a three-way Steel Cage match against both Kazarian and Moore, but was forced to miss the event due to being unable to fly out of England after the country&#x27;s airspace was closed following a volcano eruption in Iceland. At the event TNA announced that as a result of missing the show, Williams was stripped of the TNA X Division Championship. After missing two more weeks of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams returned on 3 May episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; and refused to hand the Championship belt over to the new champion, Kazarian, and claimed that he had to beat him for it at Sacrifice, to get it. Two weeks later at Sacrifice Williams defeated Kazarian to regain the TNA X Division Championship. The following month at Slammiversary VIII Williams successfully defended his TNA X Division Championship against Brian Kendrick, using a high flying manoeuvre, a tornado DDT, despite his previous anti–high flying statements.
On 3 July 2010, Dixie Carter announced that Durdle had signed a new long–term contract with TNA which also led to him relocating from the United Kingdom to the United States. On 11 July at Victory Road Williams successfully defended his TNA X Division Championship against Brian Kendrick, this time in an Ultimate X submission match. On 5 August episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Williams interfered in a Street Fight between Jay Lethal and Ric Flair, helping Flair win the match. The following week Williams joined Flair&#x27;s Fortune (originally spelled ) stable, as he, A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm and Matt Morgan attacked EV 2.0, a stable consisting of former Extreme Championship Wrestling performers. At No Surrender Williams defeated EV 2.0 member Sabu to retain the X Division Championship. On 6 September, at the tapings of 16 September episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams lost the X Division Championship to Jay Lethal. Williams received his rematch for the title at Bound for Glory. After failing to finish Lethal with his pure wrestling, Williams resorted to going for a high flying manoeuvre, a Frankensteiner, which ended up backfiring as Lethal countered it into a sunset flip for the victory. On the following episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Fortune formed an alliance with Hulk Hogan&#x27;s and Eric Bischoff&#x27;s new stable, Immortal.

On 28 October episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; tensions rose between Williams and the rest of Fortune, in particular his former X Division rival Kazarian, who thought he had a bad attitude. Williams then replaced Kazarian in a tag team match, where he and A.J. Styles defeated EV 2.0 members Rob Van Dam and Raven, after Styles blind tagged Williams and stole his pinfall. Williams then began showing signs of a possible face turn by standing up for Matt Morgan, who was kicked out of Fortune for showing concern for Mr. Anderson, while also voicing his own concern for not being able to spotlight his talent, while a member of Fortune. The following week Flair ordered Williams and Kazarian to settle their differences in the ring. Kazarian won the match between the members of Fortune, after a miscommunication between Williams and James Storm. After the match Flair made Williams and Kazarian shake hands. At Turning Point the seemingly re–united Fortune defeated EV 2.0 in a ten-man tag team match and, as a result, EV 2.0&#x27;s Sabu was released from TNA. On 11 November episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Williams, Roode and Storm faced former Fortune member Matt Morgan in a three–on–one handicap match. During the match Roode and Storm abandoned Williams and left him to be pinned by Morgan. The following week Fortune interfered in a match between Morgan and Ric Flair, however, Williams refused to take part in beating Morgan down. When confronted by Styles, Williams turned face for the first time in his TNA career by attacking the rest of Fortune, helping Morgan clear the ring and costing Flair the match. On 5 December at Final Resolution Williams defeated Styles to win the TNA Television Championship for the first time. On 23 December episode of &quot;Impact!&quot; Williams defended the Television Championship against Styles in a 20-minute Iron Man match. The match ended in a 1–1 draw, setting up another match at Genesis on 9 January 2011, where Styles would put his spot in Fortune on the line against Williams&#x27; title. However, Styles was forced to pull out of the match after suffering a legitimate hip injury and was replaced by his ally Abyss, who proceeded to defeat Williams for the Television Championship, after Styles ran in and hit Williams with the title belt.

====British Invasion reunion and singles competition (2011–2012)====

On 31 March episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Williams turned heel and reformed the British Invasion with Magnus by attacking the team of Eric Young and Orlando Jordan. In their first match back together, Williams and Magnus were defeated by Ink Inc. (Jesse Neal and Shannon Moore) on 12 April episode of &quot;Xplosion&quot;. On 17 April at Lockdown, Williams and Magnus were defeated again by Ink Inc. in a four tag team number one contenders&#x27; Steel Cage match. Despite not having won a single match since their reformation, it was announced on 2 June episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; that the British Invasion would receive a shot at the TNA World Tag Team Championship at Slammiversary IX. At the pay-per-view, Williams and Magnus were unsuccessful in their challenge for the title, losing to the team of James Storm and Alex Shelley, who filled in for Robert Roode, who was sidelined with a storyline injury. On 30 June episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Williams and Magnus turned face by responding to Mexican America&#x27;s bad remarks by praising the United States. They were then attacked until Rob Terry returned to save them, effectively adding him back to the group. On 14 July episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Mexican America&#x27;s Anarquia and Hernandez defeated Williams and Magnus in a TNA World Tag Team Championship number one contender&#x27;s match, following outside interference from their stablemate Rosita. In December, Magnus formed a new tag team with Samoa Joe, which eventually led to the dissolution of the British Invasion.

On 29 December episode of &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot;, Williams was sidelined with a storyline injury, after Gunner dropped him onto the concrete floor with a DDT. Williams returned to &quot;Impact Wrestling&quot; on 9 February 2012, episode, taped in London, losing to Alex Shelley in a three-way match, which also included TNA X Division Champion Austin Aries. On 8 July at Destination X, Williams entered a tournament to determine the new X Division Champion, but was defeated in his first round match by Kenny King.

<text>Alicia Bridges (born July 15, 1953) is an American singer and songwriter who co-wrote and performed her international hit &quot;I Love the Nightlife (Disco &#x27;Round)&quot; in 1978.

==Early years==
Born in Charlotte, North Carolina and raised in the small Cleveland County town of Lawndale, Bridges sang from a very young age, learning to play guitar at the age of 10. At the age of 12, she had her own radio program: &quot;The Alicia Bridges Show&quot;, broadcast every Saturday on station WADA in Shelby, North Carolina. From age thirteen, Bridges fronted bands that performed in local clubs: &quot;They were pretty rough places ... but these were the only places I could get ... performing experience ... so I had to adjust to that rough environment and learn to survive in it.&quot;

==Discovery and fame (1970s)==
Bridges first recorded for the Nashville-based Mega Records, with two 1973 single releases of her original material. Despite the lack of success of these releases, Bridges came to the attention of Bill Lowery, who became her manager, subsidizing Bridges over a roughly two-year period. During this time, he canvassed record labels on her behalf, which led to her signing with Polydor in 1977.

Bridges&#x27;s self-titled debut album was the inaugural production by Steve Buckingham, who was assigned to produce Bridges after playing guitar on one of her earliest sessions. Bridges and her personal and songwriting partner Susan Hutcheson had written a song entitled &quot;Disco &#x27;Round&quot;, which, at Buckingham&#x27;s suggestion, was recorded as &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot;, as Buckingham felt that the song was R&amp;B rather than disco (&quot;Disco &#x27;Round&quot; was retained as the song&#x27;s subtitle): Bridges herself would later admit she had had hopes that the song would be received as a Memphis soul number, calling it &quot;something Al Green might sing&quot;. However, club support was a key factor in the success of the track, which became a &quot;sleeper&quot; Top 40 hit, spending 27 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with a peak of number five, and also appearing on several international hit parades as evinced by the &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;&quot;s&quot; &quot;Hits of the World&quot; chart. The song was also in the #7 position on the &quot;Record World&quot; charts and at #6 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; charts. It was also a &quot;crossover&quot; hit, receiving play even on country music stations. The cover of the 1978 self-titled LP features an early skyline picture of Atlanta, Georgia.

In 1978, Bridges was a Grammy nominee and was the opening act, performing &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot;. Bridges&#x27; self-titled LP, &quot;Alicia Bridges&quot;, was also rising on the &quot;Billboard&quot;, &quot;Cash Box&quot; and &quot;Record World&quot; charts, and the LP remained on the charts for up to 35 weeks. Both the LP and the single release were international successes, and &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; went top-40 in the UK and Germany, Spain and other European countries. Bridges&#x27;s music was especially popular in Japan. She received an RIAA Certified Gold Record for the sale of over one million copies of her hit single in the United States, as well as a gold record from Canada.

Contrary to the impression created by her success with &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot;, Bridges was primarily a singer of R&amp;B, rock, blues and love songs. &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; has a definite back beat and organ similar to early 1970s R&amp;B; the original intention was for &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; to be an R&amp;B song, but when Bill Lowery first heard the song, he saw its disco potential: subsequently, a 12&quot; single remix was created by Jim Burgess, ultimately becoming a worldwide club smash.

&quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; has been featured in several movies, including &quot;Love at First Bite&quot;, &quot;The Last Days of Disco&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;.

Bridges&#x27;s second single, &quot;Body Heat&quot;, was a rock song with strong electric guitar rhythms. It was a &quot;rock/dance&quot; song released at a time when there was some rivalry between disco fans and rock fans; this time period began to see more songs that mixed the genres of rock and disco to create a &quot;rock/disco&quot; flavor.

In an interview, Bridges mentioned Elvis Presley as the singer who originally aroused her interest in rock music, but she has always considered herself an R&amp;B singer. She cited Tina Turner, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight and Patti LaBelle as her 1970s influences. She said that she did not care for white female singers as a rule, with the exceptions being Joni Mitchell and Janis Joplin. She complained that white women sounded as though they were &quot;sleepwalking&quot; through their performances. &quot;Yeah, I jump around a lot when I&#x27;m performing,&quot; she said.

===Impostor===
In 1983, a woman was arrested in Nashville, Tennessee for pretending to be Alicia Bridges during a country music convention. Bridges drove from her home in Atlanta to give evidence in the case. Bridges stated that she had been plagued by an impostor for five years.

==Recent years==
After the 1984 release of the second of two consecutive unsuccessful album releases, Bridges began working as a disc jockey at Atlanta dance clubs. She was working at the Ponce de Leon Avenue venue the Atlanta Eagle when her disco classic &quot;I Love the Nightlife&quot; had its 1994 revival due to its inclusion on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;. This revival spurred Bridges to perform at retro disco shows for a number of years, before retiring to Charlotte, North Carolina.

Alicia Bridges Music Publications was founded in 2006 and has produced three albums.

In November 2006, Bridges released a remixed and remastered compilation of her songs titled &quot;This Girl Don&#x27;t Care&quot;. In 2007, she released &quot;Say It Sister&quot;. Her third CD, &quot;Faux Diva&quot;, was released in 2008; this included a remix of &quot;I Love The Nightlife&quot;.

Bridges is currently active in the music community as a producer and DJ. Her works, digital versions of her recordings, a blog and videos can be found on her official web sites. 
In 2009, Bridges was inducted into the North Carolina Music Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Bridges came out as a lesbian in 1998. In an interview with &quot;The Advocate&quot;, Bridges stated that, as a teenager, she realized she was &quot;different from the rest&quot;.

<doc id="672234" wikidata="Q14935830" url="?curid=672234" title="Joondanna, Western Australia">
<text>Joondanna is a suburb in Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.
There is a Catholic church, St Denis, and a small Catholic primary school, St Denis School, named after the church.
Joondanna is named after a farm said to be owned by an early settler in the area.

Joondanna Heights was the first declared township in the Perth Road District (now the City of Stirling) - the &quot;Government Gazette&quot; of 17 November 1939 described its boundaries as Balcatta Beach Road (now North Beach Drive, Tuart Hill), Main Street, Wanneroo Road, and what was then the City of Perth boundary (Green Street, now the City of Vincent boundary). Joondanna&#x27;s neighbouring suburbs are Yokine, Coolbinia, North Perth, Mount Hawthorn, Glendalough, Osborne Park, and Tuart Hill.

Footballer Chris Judd lived in Joondanna when he played for the West Coast Eagles, and Paralympian Louise Sauvage grew up in the suburb.

<doc id="672235" wikidata="Q1999293" url="?curid=672235" title="Bristol Bulldog">
<text>The Bristol Bulldog is a British Royal Air Force single-seat biplane fighter designed during the 1920s by the Bristol Aeroplane Company. More than 400 Bulldogs were produced for the RAF and overseas customers, and it was one of the most famous aircraft used by the RAF during the inter-war period.
==Background==
The design of the Bulldog was the outcome of a series of design studies for fighters undertaken by Frank Barnwell during the 1920s. In 1924 Barnwell had started work on a fighter powered by the Rolls-Royce Falcon to meet the requirements of specification F.17/24. The project was shelved since Bristol preferred to use its own engine designs, but was revived in 1926 when Barnwell started work on a design, designated the Bristol 102, to meet either F.9/26 for a day-and-night fighter or N.21/26 for a shipborne fighter. 

The Type 105 designation was first applied to a subsequent proposal for another aircraft to meet F.9/26 powered by the Mercury engine then under development at Bristol. These proposals looked promising enough for a pair of mockups to be constructed for inspection by the Air Ministry in February 1927. The two aircraft were similar in design, the interceptor to specification F.17/24 design being slightly smaller and lighter and not equipped with radio. As a result, Bristol was asked to revise the design so that it met a later interceptor specification, F.20/27. Subsequently, a prototype aircraft, now designated the Type 107 Bullpup was ordered for evaluation, but the other design did not gain official backing. Nevertheless, Bristol considered it promising enough to build a prototype to be entered for the F.9/26 trials as a private venture, powered by a Bristol Jupiter because the supply of Mercurys was expected to be limited.

==Design and development==
The Type 105 was an unequal span single bay biplane powered by a supercharged Bristol Jupiter VII air-cooled radial engine driving a two-bladed propeller. The structure was all-metal with a fabric covering, using members built up from rolled high-tensile steel strips riveted together. In order to ensure the maximum field of view there was a large semi-circular cut-out in the trailing edge of the upper wing and the inboard section of the lower was of reduced chord. Frise ailerons were fitted to the top wing only. It was armed with a pair of Vickers machine guns mounted one either side of the cockpit.

The prototype Bulldog first flew on 17 May 1927. Initial testing was entirely satisfactory and it was delivered to RAF Martlesham Heath in June. After consideration of all the types entered to meet the specification, the Bulldog and the Hawker Hawfinch were selected for more detailed evaluation. The manoeuvrability and strength of the Bulldog were praised by the RAF. It had poor spin recovery characteristics, which were remedied by fitting an enlarged fin and rudder but this led to difficulties in taxiing in a crosswind.

A second prototype with a lengthened rear fuselage was ordered for further evaluation in comparison with the Hawfinch. In this form, the Type 105A or Bulldog Mk. II, it was first flown by Cyril Uwins on 21 January 1928 and shortly afterwards delivered to Martlesham Heath. Performance was so close to that of the Hawfinch that a decision was deferred until the aircraft had been evaluated by service pilots; the eventual choice of the Bulldog was made largely because it was easier to maintain. An initial contract for 25 aircraft was placed: Bristol accordingly laid down 26 airframes, the extra one being intended as a company demonstration aircraft. The first of these were delivered on 8 May 1929 and deliveries were complete by 10 October.

Later production aircraft were of a refined version, the Mk. IIA with revised wing spars and a stronger fuselage, powered by the uprated Jupiter VII F. One production aircraft was modified for use as an advanced trainer: after evaluation by the Central Flying School at Upavon this was ordered by the RAF, the production aircraft differing from the prototype in having slightly swept wings and an enlarged fin to improve spin recovery.

==Operational history==
The Bulldog never saw combat with the RAF, although during the Abyssinia Crisis of 1935–36, Bristol Bulldogs were sent to the Sudan to reinforce Middle East Command. Douglas Bader, better known for his Second World War actions, lost both of his legs when he crashed his Bristol Bulldog while he was performing unauthorised aerobatics at Woodley airfield near Reading. The Bulldog was withdrawn from RAF Fighter Command in July 1937, being primarily replaced by the Gloster Gauntlet. but continued to serve the RAF for a few years with Service Flying Training Schools. The Bulldog was exported to foreign air forces, seeing service with Australia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Japan, Latvia, Siam and Sweden.

In 1936, Latvia, intent on replacing its Bulldogs with more modern aircraft, sold 11 Bulldogs to Basque nationalist forces. These became part of the Spanish Republican Air Force in the Spanish Civil War; remaining in use until the Battle of Santander. Ten Bulldogs saw combat as part of the Finnish Air Force during the Winter War against the Soviet Union, which began in 1939. The Bulldogs fought against their Soviet opponent, gaining two kills by two pilots for the loss of one of their own, the types shot down being one Polikarpov I-16 and one Tupolev SB, both of which were superior in terms of technology compared to the Bulldog. The first aerial victory of the Finnish Air Force was achieved by a Bulldog piloted by SSgt Toivo Uuttu on 1 December 1939, over an I-16. The Bulldogs were used in advanced training during the subsequent Continuation War against the Soviet Union.

<doc id="672240" wikidata="Q7803394" url="?curid=672240" title="Tim Curtis">
<text>Timothy Stephen Curtis (born 15 January 1960) is a former England cricketer, English teacher and Director of Sport at RGS Worcester. He retired from teaching in 2016.

A right-handed batsman born at Chislehurst in Kent, Curtis was a prolific scorer for Worcestershire and county captain between 1992 and 1995. He is one of only two players to score 10,000 one day runs for the county, and during the late 1980s he had a brief international career.

As cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, stated Curtis was &quot;a diligent, determined opener... brought in to stop the rot against the 1988 West Indians with about as much success as those who had gone before him&quot;.

Curtis was perhaps unfortunate to play in an era of very poor England performances and much was made of Curtis&#x27;s batting stance and technique during his England career. In 1989, Terry Alderman frequently had Curtis lbw playing across the line and much of the TV media blamed this on his stance and backlift. This despite the fact that his opening partner Graham Gooch had a very similar set-up at the crease. While Curtis showed considerable patience and courage during his encounters with the West Indies, he looked highly suspect against Australia and at age 29 was not considered for the rebuilding process which England began under Graham Gooch&#x27;s captaincy in 1990.

==Life and career==
Curtis moved to Worcestershire in the 1960s to live in Malvern, where he attended The Grove county primary school. He entered the Royal Grammar School Worcester, where he became captain of rugby and cricket and Head Boy of the school. He moved on to Durham University (Hatfield College) in 1979, where he captained the university cricket team. That year also saw his debut in first-class cricket. Curtis also played rugby alongside cricket at university and represented Durham University RFC as a fullback in the University Athletic Union (UAU) final against Exeter University, which Durham won 6–3. In most rugby matches he played at university his name was listed in the programme as &#x27;A. N. Other&#x27; – this subterfuge was the result of Curtis being contracted to play county cricket for Worcestershire, and he did not think they would approve of him risking injuries by playing rugby in the closed season.

In 1983, Curtis went to Magdalene College, Cambridge and gained a blue for cricket. After returning to Worcester to teach English at the Royal Grammar School, he played cricket for Worcestershire. Curtis is the only man, other than Graeme Hick, to have scored more than 10,000 runs in List A cricket for Worcestershire. In 1988, he was selected for England and played in a total of five Test matches against Australia and West Indies as an opening batsman. However, his international career was unsuccessful, and he never reached fifty in a Test innings. He had more success at this time with Worcestershire, helping them to win the County Championship in 1988 and 1989, the Refuge Assurance League in 1987 and 1988, and the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and Refuge Assurance Cup in 1991.
In 1992, Curtis was appointed captain of Worcestershire, leading the county to success in the 1994 NatWest Trophy. He retired from first-class cricket in 1996 and continues to write about, and coach, cricket.

In 1994, he along with Tom Moody set the record for the highest ever partnership for the 3rd wicket in List A cricket history (309*).

Curtis had a spell as chairman of the Professional Cricketers&#x27; Association.

<doc id="672245" wikidata="Q6373375" url="?curid=672245" title="Karrinyup, Western Australia">
<text>Karrinyup is a suburb of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, and is located 12 km north of Perth&#x27;s central business district. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

==History==
The name Karrinyup was originally derived from the word &quot;Careniup&quot;, a Noongar name for a nearby swamp, an Aboriginal word apparently meaning &quot;the place where bush kangaroos graze&quot;. It may also mean &quot;the place where spiders are&quot;. In the 1840s, Samuel Moore took up a grant of in the northern part of the suburb. Moore&#x27;s grant, Swan Location 92 was surveyed by P Chauncey in 1844 and Chauncey recorded a large swamp just to the east of Karrinyup as Careniup Swamp.

In 1929, the foundation committee developing the Lake Karrinyup Country Club golf course opted to change the spelling.

While the area had been subdivided by Charles Stoneman in 1904 and roads built, the country club remained the only significant feature in the area, and rapid growth did not begin until 1957, with the part south of Karrinyup Road developing first. At this stage, the only access to the area from Perth was via Wanneroo Road and Balcatta Beach Road. The building of the Mitchell Freeway to Karrinyup Road in 1983-84 facilitated the growth of Karrinyup and nearby Stirling as a regional hub.

==Geography==
Karrinyup is bounded by North Beach Road to the north (Reid Highway is located just a few hundred metres further north), Marmion Avenue to the west, Newborough Street to the south and Huntriss Road and the country club to the east. About one-third of Karrinyup&#x27;s land area is reserve or bushland, or part of the suburb&#x27;s two golf courses. Karrinyup Road links Marmion Avenue and West Coast Highway to Mitchell Freeway through the suburb.

At the 2016 Australian census, Karrinyup had a population of 9,283. Most of the houses in Karrinyup are relatively modern, though the prolonged period of development has resulted in a range of styles from various eras. Many of the homes within the suburb are of two storeys and the vast majority are of brick and tile construction.

==Facilities==
The Karrinyup Shopping Centre contains a bus station, community centre and library as well as two major department stores. It was built in 1973 and has since been extended to offer 54,587 m2 of retail accommodation with undercover and open-air parking. A major renovation is expected to be finished in 2021, with plans for apartment towers in the north-east of the complex. It&#x27;s owned by the superannuation fund Unisuper and managed by AMP.

Karrinyup has two golf courses, Hamersley (public) and Lake Karrinyup (private). Open spaces exist at Lake Karrinyup and at the south-west of the suburb. Karrinyup contains three state primary schools (Karrinyup, Deanmore and Newborough) and a private college, St Mary&#x27;s Anglican Girls&#x27; School, founded in 1921 at West Perth and relocated to Karrinyup in 1961.

==Transport==
Karrinyup is served by the Karrinyup bus station, located at the shopping centre, with Transperth bus routes 422, 423, 424 and 425 providing a link to Stirling train station. Further west is a bus depot operated by Swan Transit. All services are operated by Swan Transit.

<text>Menora is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

In 1954, with the establishment of official suburban boundaries, the new offshoot from Mount Lawley was named Menora in honour of an old theatre of that name which was located within its borders. Further support for the name was provided by the local Jewish community for whom the Menorah holds special significance. From an aerial point of view, a section of the roads are shaped like the Menorah.

Menora is home to a large Jewish community (8.2%), the heart of which is the Perth Hebrew Congregation. It is close to the Carmel Jewish School, JHub Maccabi Community Centre and other Kosher facilities such as the Kosher Food Centre in Menora and the Kosher Besh Fresh cafe. Jewish worshipers from the Reform/Progressive tradition, are served by Temple David in nearby Mount Lawley.

In the , Menora had a median age of 57 (as compared with 38 for Australia), children aged 0–14 years made up 12.6% and 41.2% of its population were over 65 years of age. This is likely attributable to a high concentration of retirement villages in the district.

<doc id="672259" wikidata="Q4868564" url="?curid=672259" title="Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism">
<text>In theoretical physics, the Batalin–Vilkovisky (BV) formalism (named for Igor Batalin and Grigori Vilkovisky) was developed as a method for determining the ghost structure for Lagrangian gauge theories, such as gravity and supergravity, whose corresponding Hamiltonian formulation has constraints not related to a Lie algebra (i.e., the role of Lie algebra structure constants are played by more general structure functions). The BV formalism, based on an action that contains both fields and &quot;antifields&quot;, can be thought of as a vast generalization of the original BRST formalism for pure Yang–Mills theory to an arbitrary Lagrangian gauge theory. Other names for the Batalin–Vilkovisky formalism are field-antifield formalism, Lagrangian BRST formalism, or BV–BRST formalism. It should not be confused with the Batalin–Fradkin–Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism, which is the Hamiltonian counterpart.

==Batalin–Vilkovisky algebras==
In mathematics, a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra is a graded supercommutative algebra (with a unit 1) with a second-order nilpotent operator Δ of degree −1. More precisely, it satisfies the identities
*formula_1 (The product is associative)
*formula_2 (The product is (super-)commutative)
*formula_3 (The product has degree 0)
*formula_4 (Δ has degree −1)
*formula_5 (Nilpotency (of order 2))
* The Δ operator is of second order:
:formula_6

One often also requires normalization:

*formula_7 (normalization)

==Antibracket==
A Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra becomes a Gerstenhaber algebra if one defines the Gerstenhaber bracket by
:formula_8
Other names for the Gerstenhaber bracket are Buttin bracket, antibracket, or odd Poisson bracket. The antibracket satisfies
* formula_9 (The antibracket (,) has degree −1)
* formula_10 (Skewsymmetry)
* formula_11 (The Jacobi identity)
* formula_12 (The Poisson property; the Leibniz rule)

==Odd Laplacian==
The normalized operator is defined as
:formula_13
It is often called the odd Laplacian, in particular in the context of odd Poisson geometry. It &quot;differentiates&quot; the antibracket
* formula_14 (The formula_15 operator differentiates (,))
The square formula_16 of the normalized formula_15 operator is a Hamiltonian vector field with odd Hamiltonian Δ(1)
* formula_18 (The Leibniz rule)
which is also known as the modular vector field. Assuming normalization Δ(1)=0, the odd Laplacian formula_19 is just the Δ operator, and the modular vector field formula_20 vanishes.

==Compact formulation in terms of nested commutators==
If one introduces the left multiplication operator formula_21 as 
:formula_22
and the supercommutator [,] as 
:formula_23
for two arbitrary operators &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;, then the definition of the antibracket may be written compactly as
:formula_24
and the second order condition for Δ may be written compactly as
:formula_25 (The Δ operator is of second order)
where it is understood that the pertinent operator acts on the unit element 1. In other words, formula_26 is a first-order (affine) operator, and formula_27 is a zeroth-order operator.

==Master equation==
The classical master equation for an even degree element &quot;S&quot; (called the action) of a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra is the equation
:formula_28
The quantum master equation for an even degree element &quot;W&quot; of a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra is the equation
:formula_29
or equivalently,
:formula_30
Assuming normalization Δ(1) = 0, the quantum master equation reads
:formula_31

==Generalized BV algebras==
In the definition of a generalized BV algebra, one drops the second-order assumption for Δ. One may then define an infinite hierarchy of higher brackets of degree −1
:formula_32
The brackets are (graded) symmetric
:formula_33 (Symmetric brackets)
where formula_34 is a permutation, and formula_35 is the Koszul sign of the permutation 
:formula_36.
The brackets constitute a homotopy Lie algebra, also known as an formula_37 algebra, which satisfies generalized Jacobi identities 
:formula_38 (Generalized Jacobi identities)
The first few brackets are:
* formula_39 (The zero-bracket)
* formula_40 (The one-bracket)
* formula_41 (The two-bracket)
* formula_42 (The three-bracket)
* formula_43
In particular, the one-bracket formula_44 is the odd Laplacian, and the two-bracket formula_45 is the antibracket up to a sign. The first few generalized Jacobi identities are:
* formula_46 (formula_47 is formula_48-closed)
* formula_49 (formula_47 is the Hamiltonian for the modular vector field formula_51)
* formula_52 (The formula_19 operator differentiates (,) generalized)
* formula_54 (The generalized Jacobi identity)
* formula_43
where the Jacobiator for the two-bracket formula_56 is defined as
:formula_57

==BV &quot;n&quot;-algebras==
The Δ operator is by definition of n&#x27;th order if and only if the (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-bracket formula_58 vanishes. In that case, one speaks of a BV n-algebra. Thus a BV 2-algebra is by definition just a BV algebra. The Jacobiator formula_59 vanishes within a BV algebra, which means that the antibracket here satisfies the Jacobi identity. A BV 1-algebra that satisfies normalization Δ(1) = 0 is the same as a differential graded algebra (DGA) with differential Δ. A BV 1-algebra has vanishing antibracket.

==Odd Poisson manifold with volume density==
Let there be given an (n|n) supermanifold with an odd Poisson bi-vector formula_60 and a Berezin volume density formula_61, also known as a P-structure and an S-structure, respectively. Let the local coordinates be called formula_62. Let the derivatives formula_63 and 
:formula_64
denote the left and right derivative of a function &quot;f&quot; wrt. formula_62, respectively. The odd Poisson bi-vector formula_60 satisfies more precisely
* formula_67 (The odd Poisson structure has degree –1)
* formula_68 (Skewsymmetry)
* formula_69 (The Jacobi identity)
Under change of coordinates formula_70 the odd Poisson bi-vector formula_60 
and Berezin volume density formula_61 transform as
* formula_73
* formula_74
where &quot;sdet&quot; denotes the superdeterminant, also known as the Berezinian.
Then the odd Poisson bracket is defined as
:formula_75
A Hamiltonian vector field formula_76 with Hamiltonian &quot;f&quot; can be defined as
:formula_77
The (super-)divergence of a vector field formula_78 is defined as
:formula_79
Recall that Hamiltonian vector fields are divergencefree in even Poisson geometry because of Liouville&#x27;s Theorem. 
In odd Poisson geometry the corresponding statement does not hold. The odd Laplacian formula_80 measures the failure of Liouville&#x27;s Theorem. Up to a sign factor, it is defined as one half the divergence of the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field, 
:formula_81
The odd Poisson structure formula_60 and Berezin volume density formula_61 are said to be compatible if the modular vector field formula_20 vanishes. In that case the odd Laplacian formula_80 is a BV Δ operator with normalization Δ(1)=0. The corresponding BV algebra is the algebra of functions.

== Odd symplectic manifold ==
If the odd Poisson bi-vector formula_60 is invertible, one has an odd symplectic manifold. In that case, there exists an odd Darboux Theorem. That is, there exist local Darboux coordinates, i.e., coordinates formula_87, and momenta formula_88, of degree
:formula_89
such that the odd Poisson bracket is on Darboux form
:formula_90
In theoretical physics, the coordinates formula_91 and momenta formula_92 are called fields and antifields, and are typically denoted formula_93 and formula_94, respectively.
:formula_95
acts on the vector space of semidensities, and is a globally well-defined operator on the atlas of Darboux neighborhoods. Khudaverdian&#x27;s formula_96 operator depends only on the P-structure. It is manifestly nilpotent formula_97, and of degree −1. Nevertheless, it is technically not a BV Δ operator as the vector space of semidensities has no multiplication. (The product of two semidensities is a density rather than a semidensity.) Given a fixed density formula_61, one may construct a nilpotent BV Δ operator as
:formula_99
whose corresponding BV algebra is the algebra of functions, or equivalently, scalars. The odd symplectic structure formula_60 and density formula_61 are compatible if and only if Δ(1) is an odd constant.

==Examples==
* The Schouten–Nijenhuis bracket for multi-vector fields is an example of an antibracket.
* If &quot;L&quot; is a Lie superalgebra, and Π is the operator exchanging the even and odd parts of a super space, then the symmetric algebra of Π(&quot;L&quot;) (the &quot;exterior algebra&quot; of &quot;L&quot;) is a Batalin–Vilkovisky algebra with Δ given by the usual differential used to compute Lie algebra cohomology.

<text>Sherborne School is a 13–18 boys public school and boarding school located beside Sherborne Abbey, in the parish of Sherborne, Dorset. The school has been in continuous operation on the same site for over 1,300 years. It was founded in 705 AD by St Aldhelm and, following the dissolution of the monasteries, re-founded in 1550 by Edward VI, making it one of the oldest schools in the United Kingdom. Sherborne is one of the twelve founding member public schools of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference in 1869 and is a member of the Eton Group and Boarding Schools Association.

Sherborne educates about 600 boys, aged 13 to 18, and three quarters of its 2021 A level results were A or A* grades. Many of the school buildings are on the National Heritage List for England, including seven listed as grade I, four listed as grade II*, and 19 listed as grade II; the Courts&#x27; south side is a scheduled monument.

The school also has a branch located in Doha, Qatar.

==History==
===705–1539===
Sherborne was founded as a cathedral school when, in 705 AD, King Ine of Wessex instructed Aldhelm, a churchman and distinguished scholar, to found a cathedral and college of clergy at Sherborne to relieve pressure from the growing see of Winchester. It is one of the oldest schools in the United Kingdom.

Anglo-Saxon masonry survives in the Beckett Room, below the school library, a reminder that Sherborne continues to occupy part of the Saxon Cathedral to which it owes its foundation. Alfred the Great, King of the Anglo-Saxons, is said to have been an early pupil of the school, a tradition supported by the seat of West Saxon government having moved to Sherborne in 860 (after Winchester was sacked by the Danes) when Alfred was about 11 years old. That Alfred&#x27;s son, later Bishop of Sherborne, was also educated at a cathedral school (in Winchester following its recovery by Wessex) is regarded as additional presumptive evidence in support of the claim. Aldhelm was the first Bishop of Sherborne, and the school remained under the direction of Sherborne&#x27;s bishops until 1122, when its supervision passed to the abbot of the Benedictine monastery which had been established at Sherborne by Wulfsige III in 998. The school continued under monastic direction until the dissolution of the monasteries by Henry VIII in 1539.

The school continues to occupy the site of the former monastery; the school chapel (12th century, modified in the 15th, 19th, and 20th centuries), library (13th century, 15th century roof and windows), and the Abbot&#x27;s House (c. 1480), occupied by the headmaster and the senior staff, are all former monastic buildings. The outlines of the monastic cloister, and curious first floor Abbot&#x27;s Chapel, are visible on the walls beyond the Abbot&#x27;s House.

===1539–1550===
While the dissolution of the Benedictine Monastery of Sherborne in 1539 had an impact on administration and finances, Sherborne School remained in continuous operation, as evidenced by extant documents including the Abbey churchwardens&#x27; accounts for 1542, which record a rent received from the school, and conclusively from a note on the certificate for Dorset under the Chantries Act, dated 14 January 1548, which records the school at Sherborne as &quot;continuatur quousque&quot; [long continued].

===1550–present===
On 29 March 1550 a formal instruction was issued by Edward VI to re-found Sherborne School – the first of his whole foundation – together with a good endowment of lands that the school might ever endure. A beautifully engrossed Royal Charter was sealed on 13 May 1550, under which the school was to have a headmaster and usher for the education of boys, and a board of twenty governors under a warden. A further note of continuity was struck when the last headmaster of Sherborne under the old foundation, William Gibson, was appointed as the first headmaster under the new foundation.

When Edward VI re-founded Sherborne, he granted the school an endowment of valuable lands which belonged to abolished chantries in the churches of Martock, Gillingham, Lytchett Matravers, Ilminster and the Free Chapel of Thornton in the parish of Marnhull. The lands with which the chantries were endowed are predominantly in Dorset, specifically in the manors of: 
On 24 October 1851 Edward Digby, 2nd Earl Digby, owner of nearby Sherborne Castle, gave to the governors of the school a plot of land, measuring just under , including the remaining old monastic buildings, though these had been converted for use as a silk mill c1740. This more than doubled the size of the school site and contributed hugely to the school&#x27;s development thereafter. The old monastic buildings were restored and converted into a chapel, dormitories, big schoolroom, and classrooms in 1853, and over time the quadrangle, as can be seen today, was gradually formed.

In 1873, the governors bought a further or so from Lord Digby&#x27;s trustees, allowing the creation of additional facilities and further prospects for the school. The old Abbey Silk Mill (not to be confused with the silk mill in the old monastic buildings) was converted into a workshop, concert room, museum, armoury, and laboratories, and a swimming bath was dug nearby, followed by the building of the fives courts the following year. The sanatorium in was completed in 1887, and the next big construction project was the Carrington Building in 1910, incorporating and replacing (in part) the old Abbey Silk Mill, to be used as new laboratories and classrooms. A new workshop was completed ten years later, forming what is now the Devitt Court. Over the years many more construction projects were completed, including the sports centre in 1974, the largest most recently being the Music School in 2010.

On 1 June 1950 King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited Sherborne School and took part in the celebrations marking the four hundredth anniversary of the granting of Sherborne&#x27;s royal charter.

Established in 1977, &quot;Sherborne International&quot; is an independent co-educational boarding school, owned and governed by Sherborne School, for those from non-British educational backgrounds who wish to improve their English language skills before moving on to study at boarding schools elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It is located in Sherborne, occupying its own campus, Newell Grange, while sharing some facilities with Sherborne School. In 2009 Sherborne founded &quot;Sherborne Qatar Prep School&quot; in Doha, Qatar, followed by &quot;Sherborne Qatar Senior School&quot; in 2012.

In 2005, 50 of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools, including Sherborne, were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel, which had allowed them to drive up tuition fees. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000. All schools involved in the scandal agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling £3 million into a trust. The trust was designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, and were following a long-established procedure in sharing information with each other, and were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;

Sherborne School merged with Sherborne Prep School in April 2021. Sherborne Prep School is a co-educational independent preparatory school for boys and girls aged 3–13 years, affiliated to IAPS (the Independent Association of Prep School). Sherborne has a partnership with the neighbouring Sherborne Girls school. While both are single-sex boarding schools, a programme of shared academic, co-curricular and social activities enables Sherborne boys and girls to mix and work together.

=== Former boarding houses ===

From 1899 to 1902, Ramsam House, renamed as Wingfield House, was the first home of Sherborne Girls&#x27; School before moving to their current site. Abbey Cottage, now the bursary, was the first location of Sherborne Preparatory School, though it was used to board a few Sherborne School boy as well. It relocated to Westbury House, now Wessex House, in 1872, and finally to its current site in 1885, when the Preparatory School became independent.

Westbury House, formerly the Bell Inn, was used solely for Sherborne School boys from 1861 to 1868, it was then used again to house Sherborne Preparatory School, as well as the boarders from Abbey Cottage, 1872–85. It is possible that the Sherborne School boys from Westbury House were then relocated again to Mapperty House, though this is only speculative as the dates match up – it could merely be a coincidence. 9&amp;11 Cheap Street (there doesn&#x27;t seem to have been a name for this building at the time) was used to board a number of boys between 1864 and 1868. Curiously, the housemaster did not live within the building, but some 200 yards away at Monk&#x27;s Barn. This is &quot;an illuminating revelation of the accepted conditions in Victorian days&quot;.

==Overview==
===Boarding school===
In the English public school tradition, Sherborne remains a full boarding school with boys living seven days a week in one of eight boarding houses. Sherborne is one of only four such remaining single-sex boys&#x27; boarding independent senior schools in the United Kingdom (the others being Eton, Harrow and Radley). 

=== School terms ===
There are three academic terms in the Sherborne year,
* The &quot;Michaelmas Term&quot;, from early September to mid December. New boys are admitted at the start of the Michaelmas Term.
* The &quot;Lent Term&quot;, from mid-January to late March.
* The &quot;Trinity Term&quot;, from late April to late June.

=== Houses ===

Sherborne is a full boarding school for boys with boarding houses operating on the house system. In addition to a house master, each house has a matron, assistant matron, senior tutor and one or more resident tutors. Each house has around 70 boys from across all year groups.

There are nine boarding houses:

Abbey House has been in continuous use since 1868, but it was also used from 1835 to 1849.

Wallace House (formerly Elmdene) was originally used as a &#x27;waiting house&#x27;, but in 1977 it became a full house and was renamed Wallace House after headmaster Alexander Ross Wallace.

In 1999, The Green moved from the Old Green (formerly the Angel Inn) to its current site at Greenhill House (formerly the site of Sherborne International, until 1991). The Old Green was then converted into housing.
Sherborne School houses are separated into &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; houses, with &quot;in&quot; houses situated near to the school, and &quot;out&quot; houses spread out around the town. &quot;In:&quot; a, b, c, f. &quot;Out:&quot; d, e, g, h, m.

==School features==
===Chapel and library===
The school chapel was originally the monastic hall (built in the early 15th century over the 12th century undercroft) used by the Abbot of Sherborne Abbey. It was in use as a silk mill from c. 1740 and was acquired by the school in 1851 from Lord Digby. It was restored and extended, and in 1855, consecrated as a chapel, dedicated to St John the Evangelist. It has been extended several times: eastwards in 1853; westwards in 1865; northwards, to create the north aisle, in 1878 and; eastwards in 1881 (into the headmaster&#x27;s building); westwards and northwards in 1922 to extend the nave, and create the antechapel which has the names engraved of those who died in World War I and World War II. The Side Chapel, created by knocking through into the School House Studies (now the headmaster&#x27;s building) in 1881, was dedicated to St Andrew in 1988 and has its own altar.

The library was the &quot;Abbot&#x27;s Guesten Hall&quot; (13th century, modified 15th century) and would have looked over the Garth and conduit before the latter was moved to the town&#x27;s market place in 1553. The building was a silk mill from c. 1740 and later still, perhaps, a brewery. It was acquired by the school in 1851 and restored in 1853. The Upper Library was used as the main school assembly room up until 1879 (when the Big Schoolroom was built) and has been used as the main school library since. The Lower Library was the cellarer&#x27;s store room and outer parlour. Later it was used as three classrooms, then the headmaster&#x27;s office, but since 1926 it has been used as the Lower Library. In 1981 the library expanded into the 12th century undercroft below the chapel. From 1670 to 1861, the school library was situated in the current School House Oak Room (built 1607), before being moved to its current location.

=== Old Schoolroom and The Slype===
The Old Schoolroom (OSR) is the oldest of the buildings specifically designed for school use and was the original &quot;scholehouse&quot; built in 1554, on the site of an earlier &quot;schole&quot;. The building as seen today dates from when it was rebuilt in 1606 with the architect believed to have been Inigo Jones (1573–1652). High on the east wall is an effigy of Edward VI, sculpted by Godfrey Arnold in 1614. A bay window was added to the South wall in 1886 when the building was undergoing another restoration. The windowsills of the OSR are made out of old school desks and are covered, on both upper and under faces, with historic graffiti of boys&#x27; names, the earliest known being from 1698.

A &quot;New Schoolhouse with Offices&quot; was built to the north in 1607, providing space for a writing school with a library above (the latter is now the School House Oak Room). To the north was a brewhouse and woodhouse, built at the same time, extended in 1642, and cellars made in 1655. Only the cellar and 1642 extension survive today as in 1835 they were demolished to make space for a new classroom with dormitories (since known as the Bell Buildings) on top of the 17th century cellar. The Old Schoolroom was used for the town&#x27;s Assizes from 1604 for around 85 years, and from 1645 to 1649 it was occupied by a garrison from the Civil War.

The Slype is a lean-to building against the North Transept of the Abbey and is the only surviving part of what would have been the Monks&#x27; Dormitory. On the lower floor, there is a passage with 12th century arcading, as well as two 13th century vaulted chambers. The passage would have led from the Cloisters towards the Monk&#x27;s Infirmary. It was probably used in part as a mortuary before monks were buried, and a number of skeletons have been found on the site. It was brought into the school&#x27;s use in 1550, as part of the Royal charter, and has since been used as a brewery, laundry, vegetable store, lumber shed, boot room, and ravens&#x27; nook.

=== Bow House and Abbey Grange ===

Bow House is thought to date from the 14th century, but probably rebuilt in the 16th or 17th century. It became an inn c1850 and in 1916 the school bought the building as a staff common room, which it remains as today.

Built in the 14th or 15th century, the Abbey Grange was originally the monastic granary. In 1827 it was converted into a dwelling by an OS governor, and in 1969 the governors bought the property to house the headmaster and their family.

=== St Emerenciana&#x27;s Chapel and Abbeylands ===
Now known as Nethercombe Farm, this building is in the grounds of Sherborne International. It dates from the late 14th century and was originally a hall-house with attached barn. It is the only religious building in the country to have been dedicated to this saint.

The oldest part of Abbeylands, fronting onto Cheap Street, dates from the 16th century. It was extended in 1649 and again in 1872. It is said that there is an underground passage that runs from the cellars at Abbeylands to Sherborne Abbey, but this has never been substantiated.

This is a very rare and early example of a classically-inspired shell house, dating from c. 1750 though it likely originated as a C17 dovecote. All of the shells are native to the British Isles, with the majority coming from the Dorset coast. There is a small ice room beneath.

==Subjects==
===Music===
Music is a Sherborne tradition. Many boys achieve grade 8 distinctions for voice and a range of instruments. Several boys each year also pass their ATCL diplomas, many with distinction. Some then go on to take their LTCL diplomas. The Week &quot;Good Schools Guide&quot; named Sherborne as &quot;The Best Independent School in the Country for Music&quot; in 2015.

In 2010 Sherborne built a new music school with highly specialist recital and recording space. Designed by Richard Keating of Orms, the building won numerous architectural awards including the 2012 RIBA South West Region Award, BCSE Award 2012 and RIBA South West Excellence in Architecture Award 2012. The school has two choirs, two close harmony groups, a symphony orchestra, sinfonia, chamber orchestra, concert and radio orchestras (Trinity term only), wind band, wind quintet, string, wind, brass and jazz ensembles and various other smaller instrumental ensembles. Performance spaces include the Tindall Recital Hall, the Big Schoolroom, and the Powell Theatre. There are two Abbey services a week which are accompanied by the chapel choir, with the chamber choir singing an introit on Sundays. Once a term the chamber choir sings for a service in an external venue. These include: Salisbury Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and various Oxford college chapels, amongst numerous others, as well as these, international tours are available for various ensembles.

The Sherborne School Choral Society was founded in 1871 by J R Sterndale-Bennett, the then director of music. Nowadays it consists of the Sherborne School choirs, Girls&#x27; School Choir, and members of public from the local area. It performs annually, and concert venues have included Sherborne Abbey, Wells Cathedral, and Poole Lighthouse. The school song is the &quot;Carmen Saeculare&quot;, also known as &quot;Carmen Shirburniense&quot;, and features a rousing last line in each verse of &quot;Vivat Rex Eduardus Sextus&quot; or &quot;Long Live King Edward the Sixth&quot; to commemorate the school&#x27;s Royal foundation in 1550. The words were written by Edward Mallet Young in 1887, and set to music by Louis Napoleon Parker. It is sung by the entire school, including the staff, although only the first and last verses are sung nowadays. Sherborne holds its own rock festival in the heart of its historic grounds, aptly named &quot;Concert in the Courts&quot;, featuring Shirburnians and boys and girls from local senior schools, performing and spectating. The festival began in the mid 1990s and the proceeds from it are donated to charity.

In the chapel there are two organs: one is a 24-stop Neo-Baroque pipe organ by S.F. Blank; the other is a Hauptwerk virtual organ with the specification of the Hereford Cathedral organ. This organ was installed by Magnus and is the largest instrument they have installed in the UK.

===Sport===

The school&#x27;s cricket ground – the Upper – is usually used by the 1st XI cricket team. The ground was first used in 1870, when Sherborne School played Clifton College. The ground is also one of the venues used by Dorset for their home fixtures. Dorset played their first match on the ground in the 1902 Minor Counties Championship against Devon. From 1902 to 1997, the ground played host to 69 Minor Counties Championship matches, with the final Championship match involving Dorset coming in 1997 when they played Herefordshire. In addition, the ground has hosted 13 MCCA Knockout Trophy matches, the last of which was in 2008, when Dorset played Buckinghamshire.

The ground has also played host to a single List A match, when Dorset played Bedfordshire in the 1968 Gillette Cup. On 30 May 2010, Dorset played Somerset, which included international players such as Craig Kieswetter in a friendly Twenty20 fixture on the ground. On 27 May 2011, the Upper hosted Dorset against Gloucestershire.

===Rugby===
Rugby has been played at Sherborne since 1846. Sherborne was the third school to take up the sport after Rugby itself and Cheltenham, and it competes in an invitational tournament, the Veterrimi IV, involving the four oldest rugby-playing schools. The school has played over 100 matches against local rivals Downside, and the Pilgrims (Old Shirburnians) played their 100th match against Radley in 2015. Robert Hands, a former sports journalist for &quot;The Times&quot;, has written a history of rugby at Sherborne School.

A number of old boys and staff have reached the international stage, including Mike Davis who was a teacher and coach at Sherborne School (1974–2002) where, alongside Phil Jones between 1975 and 1978, he coached the school to four unbeaten seasons with 35 out of 35 school matches being won. Only a handful of games were lost during a coaching partnership which spanned six seasons. He was appointed as head coach of England for the 1979/83 seasons, the only England senior coach ever appointed on the merits of their achievements as a school coach rather than a club coach. In his first season as the England coach, they won the Grand Slam in the 1980 Five Nations Championship, their first championship clean sweep since 1957.

==School culture==
===School magazine===
&quot;The Shirburnian&quot; is the official School magazine, first published in March 1859. It was devised as &#x27;an outlet for its [the school&#x27;s] wit, and also an easy means of printing all its News, both as regards those of us who are here and those who have left.&#x27; The initial run was short-lived, but it was resurrected in May 1864 and has been published continually – almost every term since that year, becoming an annual publication from 1997.

=== In popular culture ===
Sherborne School&#x27;s buildings and grounds have been used in several films including:
* &quot;The Guinea Pig&quot; (1948)
* &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1951)
* &quot;Goodbye Mr Chips&quot; (1969)
* &quot;A Murder of Quality&quot; (1991)
* &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1994)
* &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; (2014)
* &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (BBC TV Series 2015)
* &quot;Far from the Madding Crowd&quot; (2015)

===Ushers===
The usher, or lower master, was appointed by the governors of Sherborne independent of the headmaster. The qualifications required were similar to those for a headmaster, although he was usually a younger man who might reasonably expect to obtain a headmastership elsewhere in time. He was required to have attained at least a BA from Oxford or Cambridge, and he may have been in Holy Orders.

The usher was responsible for teaching the lower three forms and had responsibilities over the boys similar to the modern position of a house tutor. From the fragment of an account roll, still extant, dating from 1549, there is evidence that there was an usher before the re-founding of Sherborne in 1550, but unfortunately the name is not given. The office was abolished in 1871, although the title was later briefly revived to denote the senior deputy head.

<text>Mirrabooka is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling. At the 2021 census it had a population of 8,000 people.

==History==
The name &quot;Mirrabooka&quot; is not a Noongar word, but comes from an eastern states Indigenous language and the town of Mirrabooka, New South Wales. It is cited as a local name for the southern cross constellation.

The name &quot;Mirrabooka&quot; was originally applied to the Mirrabooka Project in the early 1950s, which was planned to be a satellite city of Perth housing up to 60,000 people and linked with the nearby Balcatta light industrial area. The project area comprised three suburbs: Balga, Nollamara, and Yirrigan. The suburb of Yirrigan was never fully developed and remained largely bushland, and was renamed Mirrabooka in 1980.

In the early stages of development of the suburb, it was originally considered as an extension of Girrawheen, and Nollamara. In the 1980s and 1990s the suburb expanded rapidly with the subdivision of bushland, on which housing developments have been built, especially north of Yirrigan Drive.

The Mirrabooka Square shopping centre, which originally opened in 1979, has since received a number of expansions. A police station near the shopping centre was opened in 1998, and was expanded in 2015.

==Transport==
The suburb is home to the Mirrabooka bus station, a hub for bus transport in the area, and is served by a number of Transperth bus routes operated by Path Transit and Swan Transit, including connections to Perth, Warwick railway station and Stirling.

For the part north of Reid Highway, the western end on Mirrabooka Avenue is covered by routes 374 and 376. Route 377 runs in Honeywell Boulevard, and route 378 runs in Australis Avenue; the eastern end on Alexander Drive is covered by routes 360, 361 and 362; the northern end on Beach Road is covered by route 449. All of these services are operated by Path Transit except route 374, which is operated by Swan Transit.

<text>Mount Lawley is an inner northern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. The suburb is bounded by the Swan River to the east, Vincent, Harold and Pakenham Streets to the south, Central Avenue and Alexander Drive to the north, and Norfolk Street to the west.

== History ==
Before the establishment of the Swan River Colony, the area was occupied by the Yabbaru Bibbulman Noongar people, who used the nearby Boodjamooling wetland (later known as Third Swamp Reserve, and now as Hyde Park) as a camping, fishing and meeting ground.

In 1865, Perth Suburban lots 140 to 149 were designated; these were bounded by Beaufort Street, Walcott Street, Lord Street and Lincoln Street. The colony was granted representative government in 1870, at which time Vincent Street and Walcott Street became boundaries of the City of Perth.

The &quot;Tramways Act 1885&quot; allowed for construction of Perth&#x27;s first tramway network, with trams in the area servicing Vincent Street, Beaufort Street and Walcott Street.

The area was part of the subdivision of Highgate Hill, with the area north of Vincent Street still consisting of large acreage, where much of the land was owned by William Leeder. Between 1889 and 1901, a number of estates were established in the area, beginning with the East Norwood Estate and including Mount Lawley Estate. Mount Lawley Estate was developed by R. T. Robinson and Sam Copley and stretched northwards from Walcott Street. The area of Mount Lawley was formally proclaimed in 1901. Mount Lawley was named in honour of Sir Arthur Lawley, the Governor of Western Australia from May 1901 to August 1902. His wife, Lady Annie Lawley, reputedly agreed to the naming of what was then primarily bushland in her husband&#x27;s name on the condition that no licensed hotels be built in the suburb.

The Beaufort Street trams were replaced by trolley buses during the 1950s, and subsequently by diesel buses when the trolley bus service ended in 1968. A number of arterial streets carrying traffic in and out of the city centre began to carry heavy loads of traffic in the 1970s, and the suburb saw a significant commercial and residential revival from this period on.

== Governance ==
Mount Lawley comes under the jurisdiction of the City of Vincent, the City of Stirling and City of Bayswater local government areas.

At the state government level, the suburb is in the electoral districts of Mount Lawley and Perth, and it is in the Division of Perth at the federal government level.

== Geography ==
Mount Lawley is in the Perth Basin on the Swan Coastal Plain. Much of the modern suburb is located within the former Perth Wetlands area, with significant drainage work being conducted in the area between 1832 and the 1880s.

== Sites of interest ==
=== Astor Theatre===
The Astor Theatre was constructed in 1914–15 and was originally named the &quot;Lyceum Theatre&quot;, and subsequently the &quot;State Theatre&quot;. It was redesigned in an Art Deco style in 1939 and received its current name in 1941. It was listed on the State Register of Heritage Places in 1999.

=== Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts ===
The Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA) was established in 1980 and teaches acting, musical theatre, directing, dance, jazz and contemporary music, classical music, arts management, production, design, and broadcasting. WAAPA&#x27;s alumni include Heath Ledger, Hugh Jackman and Tim Minchin.

== Transport ==
=== Public transport ===
Mount Lawley is well positioned to take advantage of public transit in Perth. The Mount Lawley train station is in the east of the suburb, and provides access to the Midland railway line. There are also a number of bus routes which service the area. Buses benefit from dedicated bus lanes along Beaufort Street, which are operational during weekday peak traffic periods, and the 950 connects Mount Lawley with the University of Western Australia in Crawley.

Walcott Street is another collector road, running southeast–northwest through Mount Lawley, leading towards a main arterial, Wanneroo Road.

In addition to MLSHS, the suburb hosts the Anglican girls&#x27; school Perth College, a private K–12 campus for both day and boarding students, and two primary schools, being Mount Lawley Primary School and St Paul&#x27;s Primary School.

<text>Nollamara is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

The name &quot;Nollamara&quot; is a Noongar word for the flowering plant &quot;Macropidia&quot;, commonly known as the black kangaroo paw.

The suburb is less than away from the Perth central business district and is approximately from Trigg beach. Previously known as a lower income area, Nollamara has gone through a period of gentrification over the past decade that continues on to this day. Older homes are being replaced with new townhomes and there has been a surge in young families and professionals populating the suburb. The area is characterized by extensive trees, parks and recreational facilities. The newly renovated Des Penman Reserve is a good example of this as it includes tennis, soccer, lawn-bowls, playground, shaded lunch areas and BBQ facilities. Parts of Nollamara are elevated, providing views of surrounding neighbourhoods.

Nollamara borders prominent areas such as Yokine and Dianella that are host to multimillion-dollar homes. A newly developed Flinders Street and Wanneroo Road provide easy access to Leederville, Subiaco, Northbridge and the Perth CBD.

==Transport==
The suburb is served by a number of Transperth bus routes operated by Swan Transit and Path Transit. The 354 (Mirrabooka-Yokine) covers Nollamara Shopping Centre and Flinders Street. The 384 (Mirrabooka-Perth) covers the Nollamara Shopping Centre and Wanneroo Road. The 370 and 970 (Mirrabooka-Perth) covers Flinders Street and inner portions of the suburb, the 389 (Wanneroo-Perth) and the 385/386 (Marangaroo-Perth) covers Wanneroo Road south to Perth, the 371 (Warwick-Mirrabooka) and 415 (Stirling-Mirrabooka) covers Ravenswood Drive in the north.

<text>Martin Chittenden (March 12, 1763September 5, 1840) was an American politician from Vermont. He served as a United States representative from 1803 to 1813 and as the seventh governor of Vermont from 1813 to 1815, during a crucial portion of the War of 1812.

==Biography==
Chittenden was born in Salisbury in the Colony of Connecticut to Thomas Chittenden and Elizabeth Meigs Chittenden. He moved to Vermont in 1776 in the wake of the founding of the town of Williston by his father Thomas Chittenden. Martin Chittenden attended Mares School and, in 1789, graduated from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire.

After graduating from Dartmouth College, Chittenden moved to Jericho, Vermont, and was involved in agricultural and mercantile pursuits. He was appointed Justice of the Peace in October 1789, and in 1791 he served as a delegate to the state convention that ratified the United States Constitution. He served as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant Governor Peter Olcott in 1790, and from 1790 until 1793 he served as clerk of the county court of Chittenden County, Vermont.

Chittenden served as a member of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1790 until 1796. He was judge of the Chittenden County Court from 1793 until 1795, and served as chief justice of the Chittenden County Court from 1796 until 1813. He was the first census collector for Chittenden County.

He was appointed a captain in the Vermont Militia&#x27;s 1st Regiment, 7th Division in 1793, and promoted to lieutenant colonel and regimental commander in 1794. In 1799 he was promoted to brigadier general (later major general) and commander of the 3rd Division, a post he held until 1803.

Chittenden was elected as a Federalist candidate to the Eighth Congress and was reelected to the Ninth Congress, Tenth Congress, Eleventh Congress and Twelfth Congress, serving from March 4, 1803, until March 3, 1813.

He was elected Governor of Vermont in 1813, replacing his brother-in-law, Jonas Galusha, who was also his successor in the post. Chittenden served as governor from October 23, 1813, until October 14, 1815. He was the last Federalist governor of Vermont. During his term as governor, fighting between American and British forces was fierce on the current United States–Canada border. In November 1813, conscious of the British encroachment on Plattsburgh, New York, members of the Vermont militia asked Chittenden to let them intervene. Chittenden declined, though the militia leaders claimed that this was the result of pressure from his advisers.

After his retirement from elected office, Chittenden served as town representative of Williston and as a probate judge from 1821 until 1823.

==Family life==
Chittenden&#x27;s father, Thomas Chittenden, was the first governor of Vermont.

He was the brother in law of Matthew Lyon and Jonas Galusha. Lyon married Martin Chittenden&#x27;s sister Beulah (1764–1824), and Jonas Galusha&#x27;s four wives (all of whom predeceased him) included Chittenden&#x27;s sister Mary (1758–1794).

Martin Chittenden was the uncle of Matthew Lyons&#x27; son Chittenden Lyon, a United States Representative from Kentucky.

==Death and burial==
Chittenden died on September 5, 1840, in Williston, Vermont, in 1840. He is interred at the Thomas Chittenden Cemetery in Williston.

<text>Anita Ward (born December 20, 1956) is an American singer and musician from Memphis, Tennessee. Beginning her professional music career in the late 1970s, Ward is best known for her 1979 million-selling chart-topper R&amp;B/Disco hit &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;: it was no. 1 on the United States Hot 100, R&amp;B, and Dance charts, and in the United Kingdom.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Ward was born in Memphis, Tennessee, United States. Ward obtained a degree in psychology from Rust College in Holly Springs, Mississippi. 
===Career===
Ward was a schoolteacher before signing a recording contract.

While recording her debut album, record label owner Frederick Knight presented her with a song he had written the previous year for Stacy Lattisaw. Ward did not like the song, but Knight insisted that a dance track was needed to capitalize on the current disco trend, and Ward relented. The song, which was originally a juvenile-targeted tune about teens talking on the telephone, was rewritten with more &#x27;adult&#x27; lyrics and the result was the single &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;. The single reached number one in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada in 1979. Her accompanying debut album, &quot;Songs of Love&quot; was released that same year. &quot;Ring My Bell&quot; has been remixed and released several times since its original release. After the huge success of &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;, &quot;Make Believe Lovers&quot;, which was the B-side on most 12&quot; singles for &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;, was released, but it failed to chart.

Ward released a second album later in the year; it was common in the 1970s to release albums several months apart. The album, entitled &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot;, featured the minor hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Drop My Love&quot;, which peaked at No. 87 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The album, similar to &quot;Songs of Love&quot;, was disco-infused. A third disco album was in the works due to contractual issues between Knight and Ward, but was canceled after three songs had been recorded. These songs were later included on low-budget compilations featuring Anita Ward&#x27;s first album &quot;Songs of Love&quot;. These disputes with Knight, a severe car accident Ward later was in, and the fading appeal of disco music halted Ward&#x27;s career, and she came to be regarded as a one-hit wonder, the fate she originally feared.

Many years later, Ward recorded another album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Wherever There&#x27;s Love&quot;. The album was recorded in the United States, but was only released internationally as it had no US distributor. The album was a departure from Ward&#x27;s disco past but still contained mostly fast-tempo 1980s pop songs (including a re-recorded version of &quot;Ring My Bell&quot;), in addition to two ballads. It spawned one single &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, which was released in Australia, but it did not chart there. After both the album and single &quot;Be My Baby&quot; failed to chart, Ward took another hiatus from the music industry, focusing on her family, including her daughter born shortly after the release of &quot;Wherever There&#x27;s Love&quot;.
On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2002, Ward performed &quot;Ring My Bell&quot; in New York City&#x27;s Times Square before a crowd of revelers as part of the city&#x27;s official celebration. On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2005 she performed on Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, singing &quot;Ring My Bell&quot; and several other disco songs. Ward appeared in Zagreb, Croatia, on January 4, 2006, the night before the FIS World Cup slalom race on nearby Sljeme, with some other groups and singers from disco era (Nile Rodgers and Chic, Village People, Thelma Houston and Rose Royce). In early 2011, it was announced that Ward was back in the studio and released a new single, &quot;It&#x27;s My Night&quot;.

On January 23, 2024 Ward sang &quot;Ring My Bell&quot; at the First Ladies of Disco Show at the Smith Center in Las Vegas Nevada. She was joined by Janice-Marie Johnson of Taste of Honey and Thea Austin of Snap! as well as comedian Marsha Warfield as special guests.

Ward is featured in the 2024 PBS series &quot;Disco: Soundtrack of a Revolution&quot;.

<doc id="672286" wikidata="Q7054111" url="?curid=672286" title="North Beach, Western Australia">
<text>North Beach is a northern coastal suburb of Perth, the capital city of Western Australia from Perth&#x27;s central business district via Mitchell Freeway and Reid Highway. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

==History==

The name North Beach began as a descriptive name, derived from the suburb being at the time the most northerly of Perth&#x27;s beaches. It was assigned in 1888 when surveyor Charles Crossland referred to the pastoral leases of Samuel Richard Hamersley as his &quot;north beach coastal run&quot;.

The area originally formed part of the Hamersley Estate, which also included the suburbs now known as Carine, North Beach and Hamersley. These areas were owned by the Hamersley family, who arrived from Europe to settle in the Swan River Colony in 1837 and built a summer home, called &quot;The Castle&quot; in 1865, where their large family as well as the Perth elite congregated for summer holidays. &quot;The Castle&quot; was later converted into the Castle Hotel, but after 75 years was demolished and subdivided in 1998.

Originally set aside as a timber reserve, the area was first settled by pastoralists in the 1860s. It served as a stopping point and watering hole along the Coastal Stock Route between Dongara (near Geraldton) and Fremantle. Cattle drovers frequented the area and Afghan camel drivers were a common sight after the opening of the goldfields in the 1890s - the area also served as a quarantine area for camels entering the colony. A number of orchards operated in the area - the only evidence that remains today is an old olive tree on Hope Street.

The only way into the area at this time was via a wooden block road built by convicts (later Wanneroo Road) and then along a limestone track to North Beach, although numerous tracks through the bushland were developed as time progressed.

During World War I, the Australian 10th Light Horse Regiment was stationed at Mount Flora on coast-watch duties, and kept their horses at a yard at the corner of modern-day Hope and Hale Streets. During the Great Depression, the area around the intersection of West Coast Drive and North Beach Road was a &quot;tent city&quot; that housed &quot;many unfortunate people &#x27;on hard times&#x27;&quot;.

After World War II, the area developed rapidly, and in 1954, the Postal District of North Beach was approved. By 1961, nearly all of the existing suburb had been built and settled.

=== Star Swamp ===
Star Swamp Bushland Reserve is a bushland reserve occupying about half of the land area of the suburbs of Watermans Bay and North Beach. The precise origin of the name is unknown, but the earliest known use of the name was on a lease application by J.H.Okely of Wanneroo in 1868.

In 1987, the State Government set aside 96 hectares as an A-class reserve, and funding from the Bicentennial Commemorative Program and assistance from local organisations facilitated the establishment of the Star Swamp Heritage Trail within the reserve.

==Geography==
North Beach is bounded by Hale Street to the north, Marmion Avenue to the east, an imprecise line near Lynn Street to the south and West Coast Drive and the ocean to the west. Star Swamp represents one-third of the suburb&#x27;s area. Reid Highway empties into North Beach&#x27;s eastern border, and is the suburb&#x27;s outlet to the Mitchell Freeway and the city.

At the 2001 Australian census, North Beach had a population of 2,949 people living in 1,270 dwellings, with a median age of 42 years (among the oldest in the northern suburbs). Residential styles in North Beach include a mix of holiday dwellings from before and after World War II, some former workers&#x27; houses, and modern dwellings.

==Facilities==
North Beach is a residential suburb, with small shopping areas on the coast and at Flora Terrace and Castle Street which offer basic commercial services. Nearby Karrinyup Shopping Centre provides other services. North Beach features a tennis club (synthetic and hard surfaces) near Our Lady of Grace. The suburb contains North Beach Primary School and the private Our Lady of Grace school - Carine Senior High School is nearby.

Star Swamp Bushland Reserve is accessible from the eastern edge of the suburb (Hope Street and Groat Street).

On the northern boundary is the Mount Flora Regional Museum, built in 1936 as a water tower at the highest point of the suburb to provide scheme water to surrounding areas. It was phased out of service in the 1970s, and converted to a museum and lookout in May 1986. It now details the region&#x27;s history, and is home to the North Suburban Historical Society.

==Transport==

North Beach is served by the Transperth 423 bus route between Warwick and Stirling, operated by Swan Transit.

In 1925, the North Beach Bus Company was started by Alf Lehman with crimson charabancs. It was taken over by the James family in 1928, in an era when REO buses drove over plank roads through the wetlands between modern-day Tuart Hill and North Beach. The company was taken over by the Metropolitan Transport Trust on 30 September 1961.

==Politics==
North Beach is an affluent suburb with a large elderly population. It consistently supports the Liberal Party at both federal and state elections. However, voters in this suburb lean more towards progressive parties than in similar-demographic Watermans Bay and Marmion.

<text>Osborne Park is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia in the local government area of the City of Stirling and City of Vincent.

==History==
Osborne Park was named after William Osborne, a butcher who owned an abattoir and land on Wanneroo Road and who was elected to the Perth Road Board (the City of Stirling&#x27;s predecessor), in 1875.

Osborne Park was part of an original crown grant of given to Walters in 1840. After the death of Walters in 1874, William Osborne bought part of his estate, which included the area now known as Osborne Park.

The suburb was originally market gardens, due to rich peaty soil from the swamps between Lake Monger and Herdsman Lake. The area was popular among Chinese, Italian and Yugoslav settlers. The suburb was founded by a private trading concern and had a tram service in the early 1900s through an extension of the Perth tram system from the end of the Leederville line. The suburb is now served by Glendalough train station on the Yanchep line.

Osborne Park became a residential suburb after World War II, but by the 1980s, it was predominantly an industrial area, with only the north-eastern area still residential.

==At present==
Many warehouses, car yards and small businesses are located in Osborne Park, as well as larger retailers. Scarborough Beach Road consists of the largest car yard precinct in Australia.

Main Street in Osborne Park is the cafe, shopping and business strip, hosting cafes and restaurants. The Osborne Park shopping centre is also open.

<doc id="672291" wikidata="Q2276860" url="?curid=672291" title="Type I string theory">
<text>In theoretical physics, type I string theory is one of five consistent supersymmetric string theories in ten dimensions. It is the only one whose strings are unoriented (both orientations of a string are equivalent) and the only one which perturbatively contains not only closed strings, but also open strings. The terminology of type I and type II was coined by John Henry Schwarz in 1982 to classify the three string theories known at the time.

==Overview==
The classic 1976 work of Ferdinando Gliozzi, Joël Scherk and David Olive paved the way to a systematic understanding of the rules behind string spectra in cases where only closed strings are present via modular invariance. It did not lead to similar progress for models with open strings, despite the fact that the original discussion was based on the type I string theory.

As first proposed by Augusto Sagnotti in 1988, the type I string theory can be obtained as an orientifold of type IIB string theory, with 32 half-D9-branes added in the vacuum to cancel various anomalies giving it a gauge group of SO(32) via Chan–Paton factors.

At low energies, type I string theory is described by the type I supergravity in ten dimensions coupled to the SO(32) supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory. The discovery in 1984 by Michael Green and John H. Schwarz that anomalies in type I string theory cancel sparked the first superstring revolution. However, a key property of these models, shown by A. Sagnotti in 1992, is that in general the Green–Schwarz mechanism takes a more general form, and involves several two forms in the cancellation mechanism.

The relation between the type IIB string theory and the type I string theory has a large number of surprising consequences, both in ten and in lower dimensions, that were first displayed by the String Theory Group at the University of Rome Tor Vergata in the early 1990s. It opened the way to the construction of entire new classes of string spectra with or without supersymmetry. Joseph Polchinski&#x27;s work on D-branes provided a geometrical interpretation for these results in terms of extended objects (D-brane, orientifold).

In the 1990s it was first argued by Edward Witten that type I string theory with the string coupling constant formula_1 is equivalent to the SO(32) heterotic string with the coupling formula_2. This equivalence is known as S-duality.

<text>The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (), formerly the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama () is a conservatoire of dance, drama, music, production, and film in Glasgow, Scotland. It is a member of the Federation of Drama Schools.

Founded in 1847, it has become the busiest performing arts venue in Scotland with over 500 public performances each year. 
The current principal is American pianist and composer Jeffrey Sharkey. The patron is King Charles III.

==History==
The Royal Conservatoire has occupied its current purpose-built building on Renfrew Street in Glasgow since 1988. Its roots lie in several organisations. Officially founded in 1847 by Moses Provan as part of the Glasgow Athenaeum, from an earlier Educational Association grouping, music and arts were provided alongside courses in commercial skills, literature, languages, sciences and mathematics. Courses were open and affordable, including day classes for ladies, and the Athenaeum had a reading room, news room, library and social facilities. Apprentices could also be members. Rented accommodation was found in the Assembly Rooms, Ingram Street, with major lectures taking place in the City Halls. The chairman at its inaugural Grand Soiree in the City Halls in December 1847 was Charles Dickens when in his opening remarks he stated that he regarded the Glasgow Athenaeum as &quot;an educational example and encouragement to the rest of Scotland&quot;. Its Dramatic Club was formed in 1886 a year before the institution moved to purpose-built premises, inclusive of a major concert hall/theatre, in St George&#x27;s Place close to West Nile Street, designed by architect John Burnet.

In 1888, the commercial teaching separated to form the &quot;Athenaeum Commercial College&quot;, which, after several rebrandings and a merger, became the University of Strathclyde in 1964. The non-commercial teaching side became the &quot;Glasgow Athenaeum School of Music&quot;.

In 1893 additional premises linked through to Buchanan Street and included a new Athenaeum Theatre facing Buchanan Street designed by architect Sir John James Burnet. In 1928 the premises were substantially extended with a gift from the philanthropist Daniel Macaulay Stevenson. In 1929 the school was renamed as the Scottish National Academy of Music to better reflect its scope and purpose. This major acquisition of space at the corner of St George&#x27;s Place (later renamed Nelson Mandela Place) and Buchanan Street was the Liberal Club (now not required by that party), designed originally by architect Alexander Skirving and remodelled by architects Campbell Douglas and Paterson in 1907.

Its principal from 1929 to 1941 was William Gillies Whittaker. In 1944, it became the Royal Scottish Academy of Music.

The Royal Scottish Academy of Music established a drama department called the &quot;Glasgow College of Dramatic Art&quot; during 1950. It became the first British drama school to contain a full, broadcast-specification television studio in 1962. In 1968 the Royal Scottish Academy of Music changed its name to the &quot;Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama&quot; (RSAMD) and introduced its first degree courses, which were validated by the University of Glasgow.

During 1987–88 the academy moved to its present site some two hundred yards north in Renfrew Street at Hope Street, across from the Theatre Royal, the new building having been designed by architect Sir Leslie Martin with executive architects William Nimmo and Partners.

In 1993 RSAMD became the first conservatoire in the United Kingdom to be granted its own degree-awarding powers. Research degrees undertaken at RCS are validated and awarded by the University of St Andrews. RCS is one of four member conservatories of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music.

===Incorporation of full title===

From 1 September 2011, the RSAMD deferred to its full title The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. The name has deep roots and the change was confirmed after a long consultation process that involved the principal John Wallace and the academy&#x27;s board of directors, as well as past and present students and staff, arts &amp; academic institutions, politicians, and the Royal Protocol Unit.

The principal said the change was necessary as it was no longer simply a music and drama academy. Undergraduate courses in areas such as Digital Film &amp; Television, Production Arts and Design, Production Technology and Management, Musical Theatre and Modern Ballet (in partnership with Scottish Ballet) have been added to the degrees the Royal Conservatoire offers. He felt it was best to choose a name that was representative of all disciplines offered.

==International ranking==
The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland has been consistently ranked among the best schools in the world in Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)&#x27;s Performing Arts ranking since the latter was established in 2016. The Conservatoire has been in the top 10 five out of six years, reaching 3rd place in 2017 and 2021. In 2022, RCS ranked fifth in the world for Performing Arts Education. 

==Facilities==
The Whittaker Library is housed in the Renfrew Street campus. It contains one of the largest collections of sheet music, scripts and other performing items in both the United Kingdom and the world.

In 2010, RCS opened its second campus near Cowcaddens, now known as the &quot;Wallace Studios at Speirs Locks&quot;. This building was designed by Malcolm Fraser. It opened predominantly to house the Modern Ballet and Production courses, as the Renfrew Street campus was struggling to accommodate the combination of new courses and higher intake levels. In 2014, a £2 million extension to this second campus was built, creating even more rehearsal spaces and improved facilities for the students.

<doc id="672298" wikidata="Q2228986" url="?curid=672298" title="Scarborough, Western Australia">
<text>Scarborough is a coastal suburb of Perth, Western Australia, located approximately 14 km northwest of the city centre in the City of Stirling local government area. Located along the coast of the Indian Ocean, it was named after the English beach resort Scarborough, North Yorkshire.

It has a population of about 14,300 people (2011 census), of whom about 25% were born overseas, mostly in the United Kingdom. It has a landmark high-rise hotel, the Rendezvous Hotel Perth Scarborough, originally built as Observation City in 1986 for Alan Bond, in anticipation of a demand for accommodation when the 1987 America&#x27;s Cup challenge was held at nearby Fremantle. Scarborough Beach was the venue for the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships for the years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2014, 2018 and 2023.

== Scarborough Beach ==
Scarborough Beach is an entertainment precinct within the suburb with restaurants, bars and a nightclub. Since 1999, the local council has deployed a strategy for issues including traffic, parking, zoning, coastal landscape and recreation.
=== Alan Bond ===

One of the issues was whether or not to allow further high-rise development on Scarborough Beach. The 24-level Observation City hotel development (now Rendezvous) was very controversial in the 1980s but proceeded despite a long and intense public campaign against high-rise beachfront development. Perth businessman Alan Bond, who built Observation City, had ambitious plans to convert the entire Scarborough Beach &quot;strip&quot;. After securing most of the real estate, his plans failed to proceed because he was unable to purchase the family-owned fast food restaurant Peter&#x27;s by the Sea. The restaurant still exists today after it refused to sell despite Bond making inflated offers on the property, and it has taken on historical significance with the locals ever since. Subsequent amendments by the City of Stirling have specified a height limit of eight storeys.

In April 2019, the ocean-side Scarborough Beach Pool opened.

Despite a considerable social history over decades, Scarborough Beach has one listed physical heritage feature, the &#x27;Rotary Clock Tower of Scarborough Beach&#x27; otherwise known as the &#x27;Scarborough Clock Tower.

==Transport==

<doc id="672301" wikidata="Q3356307" url="?curid=672301" title="Orientifold">
<text>In theoretical physics orientifold is a generalization of the notion of orbifold, proposed by Augusto Sagnotti in 1987. The novelty is that in the case of string theory the non-trivial element(s) of the orbifold group includes the reversal of the orientation of the string. Orientifolding therefore produces unoriented strings—strings that carry no &quot;arrow&quot; and whose two opposite orientations are equivalent. Type I string theory is the simplest example of such a theory and can be obtained by orientifolding type IIB string theory.

In mathematical terms, given a smooth manifold formula_1, two discrete, freely acting, groups formula_2 and formula_3 and the worldsheet parity operator formula_4 (such that formula_5) an orientifold is expressed as the quotient space formula_6. If formula_3 is empty, then the quotient space is an orbifold. If formula_3 is not empty, then it is an orientifold.

== Application to string theory ==

In string theory formula_1 is the compact space formed by rolling up the theory&#x27;s extra dimensions, specifically a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau space. The simplest viable compact spaces are those formed by modifying a torus.

=== Supersymmetry breaking ===

The six dimensions take the form of a Calabi–Yau for reasons of partially breaking the supersymmetry of the string theory to make it more phenomenologically viable. The Type II string theories have 32 real supercharges, and compactifying on a six-dimensional torus leaves them all unbroken. Compactifying on a more general Calabi–Yau sixfold, 3/4 of the supersymmetry is removed to yield a four-dimensional theory with 8 real supercharges (N=2). To break this further to the only non-trivial phenomenologically viable supersymmetry, N=1, half of the supersymmetry generators must be projected out and this is achieved by applying the orientifold projection.

=== Effect on field content ===

A simpler alternative to using Calabi–Yaus to break to N=2 is to use an orbifold originally formed from a torus. In such cases it is simpler to examine the symmetry group associated to the space as the group is given in the definition of the space.

The orbifold group formula_2 is restricted to those groups which work crystallographically on the torus lattice, i.e. lattice preserving. formula_3 is generated by an involution formula_12, not to be confused with the parameter signifying position along the length of a string. The involution acts on the holomorphic 3-form formula_13 (again, not to be confused with the parity operator above) in different ways depending on the particular string formulation being used.

* Type IIB : formula_14 or formula_15
* Type IIA : formula_16

The locus where the orientifold action reduces to the change of the string orientation is called the orientifold plane. The involution leaves the large dimensions of space-time unaffected and so orientifolds can have O-planes of at least dimension 3. In the case of formula_14 it is possible that all spatial dimensions are left unchanged and O9 planes can exist. The orientifold plane in type I string theory is the spacetime-filling O9-plane.

More generally, one can consider orientifold O&quot;p&quot;-planes where the dimension &quot;p&quot; is counted in analogy with D&quot;p&quot;-branes. O-planes and D-branes can be used within the same construction and generally carry opposite tension to one another.

However, unlike D-branes, O-planes are not dynamical. They are defined entirely by the action of the involution, not by string boundary conditions as D-branes are. Both O-planes and D-branes must be taken into account when computing tadpole constraints.

The involution also acts on the complex structure (1,1)-form &quot;J&quot;

* Type IIB : formula_18
* Type IIA : formula_19

This has the result that the number of moduli parameterising the space is reduced. Since formula_12 is an involution, it has eigenvalues formula_21. The (1,1)-form basis formula_22, with dimension formula_23 (as defined by the Hodge diamond of the orientifold&#x27;s cohomology) is written in such a way that each basis form has definite sign under formula_12. Since moduli formula_25 are defined by formula_26 and &quot;J&quot; must transform as listed above under formula_12, only those moduli paired with 2-form basis elements of the correct parity under formula_12 survive. Therefore, formula_12 creates a splitting of the cohomology as formula_30 and the number of moduli used to describe the orientifold is, in general, less than the number of moduli used to describe the orbifold used to construct the orientifold. It is important to note that although the orientifold projects out half of the supersymmetry generators the number of moduli it projects out can vary from space to space. In some cases formula_31, in that all of the (1-1)-forms have the same parity under the orientifold projection. In such cases the way in which the different supersymmetry content enters into the moduli behaviour is through the flux dependent scalar potential the moduli experience, the N=1 case is different from the N=2 case.

<text>The Akron RubberDucks are a Minor League Baseball team based in Akron, Ohio. The team, which plays in the Eastern League, is the Double-A affiliate of the Cleveland Guardians. They play in Canal Park, located in downtown Akron, which seats 7,630 fans. The nickname &quot;RubberDucks&quot; refers to Akron&#x27;s history in the rubber industry, in particular as the birthplace of tire and rubber companies such as Goodyear, Firestone, B.F. Goodrich, and General Tire.

==History==
The franchise began as the Binghamton Triplets, a charter member of the New York–Penn League in 1923. They played in Binghamton, New York, at Johnson Field, winning 10 titles over their 46 seasons. After the 1968 season, Boston businessman John Alevizos acquired the franchise and moved it to Gill Stadium, in Manchester, Massachusetts, to become the Manchester Yankees. After 3 seasons in Manchester, the franchise then relocated to West Haven, Connecticut, under new ownership, and became the West Haven Yankees playing at Quigley Stadium. While in West Haven, the franchise won 4 Eastern League titles in their 8 seasons. After the 1979 season, the franchise then moved to Lynn, Massachusetts, to become the Lynn Sailors playing at Fraser Field. During the 1983 season they were known as the Lynn Pirates. After the 1983 season, the franchise was moved to Burlington, Vermont, and became the Vermont Reds playing at Centennial Field. As the Reds, the franchise won 3 more Eastern League titles in 5 seasons. In 1988 they were known as the Vermont Mariners. After the 1988 season, the franchise moved to Canton, Ohio, and became the Canton-Akron Indians playing at Thurman Munson Memorial Stadium. After the 1996 season, the franchise moved up I-77 to Akron, Ohio, and became the Akron Aeros.
Opening Day on April 10, 1997, marked the debut of the Akron Aeros. With 9,086 fans in attendance, the Aeros and Harrisburg Senators played the first game at Canal Park. The Aeros went on to finish the season with a record of 51–90. Despite the last place record, the team drew a Double-A league-leading 473,272 fans to Canal Park that season.

In the 1998 season, the Aeros put together a 30-game &quot;worst-to-first&quot; turnaround; after finishing the prior year 34½ games back, they proceeded to win the Southern Division that season by 8½ games. However, after losing in the playoffs that year, it would be three more years until the Aeros found their way back to the postseason.

On September 6, 1999, the Aeros set an Eastern League attendance record for three straight seasons and once again led all Double-A teams after 522,459 fans attended Canal Park in 1999.

In 2002, the team posted a 93–48 record, the third-highest win total in the Eastern League in 50 years. They built on that success and finally won two league championships (their first since moving to Ohio) in 2003 and 2005. In 2006, the Aeros again posted the best regular-season record in the league, but lost the playoff title to Portland after taking the series to a deciding fifth game.

From 2005 to 2008, the Aeros advanced to the Eastern League Championship Series. Although the Aeros won the ELCS in 2005, they were defeated in three consecutive trips from 2006 to 2008.

In 2009, the Aeros again advanced to the league championship and defeated the Connecticut Defenders (three games to one) capping a 95-win season and their third title in the last seven years. Jared Head was named the playoff MVP.

In their first three seasons in Canal Park, the Aeros led all of Double-A in attendance, becoming the first team at that level to draw a half-million fans in a single season.

The team was sold by Mike Agganis to Ken Babby in October 2012.

===2014–present===

On October 29, 2013, the Akron Aeros officially changed their name to the Akron RubberDucks.

The RubberDucks won their first Eastern League Championship under the new name in 2016, sweeping Trenton 3-0. Akron also hosted the 2016 Eastern League All-Star Game at Canal Park.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the RubberDucks were placed into the Double-A Northeast. They won the Southwest Division title with a 73–46 record. They qualified for the championship playoffs by possessing the league&#x27;s best record. Akron defeated the Bowie Baysox, 3–0, in the best-of-five series to win the Double-A Northeast championship. Rouglas Odor was selected as the league Manager of the Year. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

<doc id="672308" wikidata="Q444205" url="?curid=672308" title="Altoona Curve">
<text>The Altoona Curve are a Minor League Baseball team based in Altoona, Pennsylvania, named after nearby Horseshoe Curve (but also alluding to the curveball, a type of pitch). The team plays in the Eastern League and is the Double-A affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Curve play in Peoples Natural Gas Field, located in Altoona; it was opened in 1999 and seats 7,210 people.

==History==

The Altoona Curve franchise began when Arizona and Tampa Bay were both awarded Major League Baseball franchises beginning in the 1998 season. The addition of these two teams had a domino effect through baseball with the expansion of not only the major leagues, but throughout Minor League Baseball as well. With this expansion, AA baseball received two new teams to begin play in the 1999 season. The Erie SeaWolves were already an established minor-league team with outstanding short-season attendance, and were quickly awarded one of the new franchises. The second spot in the new, larger Eastern League looked to be headed to Springfield, Massachusetts, but city native Bob Lozinak, developer Tate DeWeese, businessman Mark Thomas
and a group of Pennsylvania lawmakers rallied to get the final spot, making a formal presentation to league officials on October 5, 1997. The proposal received unanimous support and Altoona won the other franchise.

Groundbreaking on Blair County Ballpark took place on March 7, 1998, and the franchise was formally awarded in April. In June of that year, the &quot;Curve&quot; nickname was selected over several other proposals, including Lake Monsters, Ridge Runners, and the Altoona Fish. The name was inspired by nearby Horseshoe Curve, with many of the logos inspired by the former Pennsylvania Railroad which housed their maintenance facility in Altoona.

The next step for the start of the Altoona Curve was to find a major league affiliate. The Erie SeaWolves had already had several successful seasons in the Pirates&#x27; organization, as a short-season single-A affiliate. In the end, however, the Pirates chose Altoona for their AA affiliate.

The Altoona Curve began their first season on the road at the Reading Phillies on April 9, 1999. Their first game was suspended by rain and completed the next day as part of a doubleheader. That first game was a 6–2 loss, but the Curve scored their first-ever victory in the second game, beating Reading 6–4. A few days later, on April 15, the Curve christened Blair County Ballpark by defeating the Bowie Baysox 6–1 in front of a crowd of 6,171.

On April 2, 2002, Lozinak and DeWeese sold the franchise to a collective headed by Pittsburgh attorney Chuck Greenberg. Among the partners in the collective are Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis and NHL star Mario Lemieux. The first season under new ownership was the most successful to date, performance-wise as well as economically. During August of that year, the Pirates signed on for another four-year development agreement through the 2006 season.

During the 2003 season, the Curve made the Eastern League playoffs for the first time, and followed that up with two more appearances in 2004 and 2005. Their performance on the field has led to increased numbers in the stands, and the Curve increased attendance for five consecutive years before dipping by just a few thousand in 2005.

Following the 2004 season, General Manager Todd Parnell was honored as the Eastern League Executive of the Year, and the franchise won the Larry MacPhail Award for the best promotional effort (on and off the field) in all of Minor League Baseball.

On April 2, 2006, their fourth anniversary as owners, Greenberg and his group announced an additional four-year extension on the development agreement with the Pirates, keeping the Curve&#x27;s affiliation intact through at least the 2010 season. The Curve hosted the Eastern League All-Star Game at Blair County Ballpark on July 12, 2006, before a standing-room-only crowd of 9,308.

On December 2, 2008, Chuck Greenberg sold the Altoona Curve back to original owner and Altoona native Bob Lozinak.

On May 23, 2009, the Altoona Curve and Pittsburgh Pirates renewed their development agreement, which now runs through the 2014 season.

On September 18, 2010, the Curve defeated the Trenton Thunder to clinch the franchise&#x27;s first ever Eastern League Championship. The Curve won the series three games to one. Later that month, it was announced that the Pirates would not be bringing back Altoona manager Matt Walbeck for the following season.

In 2016, four Curve players were picked for the Eastern League All-Star Game—Tyler Eppler, Edwin Espinal, Jared Lakind, and Harold Ramírez.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Curve were organized into the Double-A Northeast. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

===No-hitters===
On April 23, 2002, Adrian Burnside, Neal McDade and Chris Spurling combined for the first no-hitter in Altoona Curve history. Burnside pitched the first five innings, McDade pitched the next three and Spurling pitched the ninth inning to complete the no-hitter.
On July 25, 2013, Ethan Hollingsworth, Jason Townsend, Jhonathan Ramos and Ryan Beckman combined for the second no-hitter in Altoona Curve history. Hollingsworth pitched the first four innings, Townsend pitched the next three, Ramos pitched the eighth inning and Beckman pitched the ninth to complete the no-hitter.

<text>Trigg is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling. Trigg Island is a small island off the coast of the suburb of Trigg.

==Overview==
Trigg Beach is one of Perth&#x27;s most popular beaches for board riding, catering mainly to surfers and body boarders alike, with a small majority of swimmers. In summer, shifting sand fills the channel between the blue hole and Trigg Point take off point for a long continuous wave ride to Trigg Beach.

Trigg also has a snorkelling beach, Mettam&#x27;s Pool, which is to the north of the main surf/swim area.

Trigg nature reserve is situated opposite Trigg Beach. It is also known to be a common meeting point and lookout for the local surfing community.

With playground protection from the sun and sea breeze, Clarko beach side reserve near Trigg Island is one of the most popular parks in the City of Stirling. Clarko Reserve was created when beach shacks were demolished and shack owners were compensated with sub-divided blocks of residential land further east in the new Trigg suburb.

==History==
The suburb and island was named after &quot;Henry Trigg&quot;, Superintendent of Public Works for the Swan River Colony in 1842. First time when land at Trigg was taken up, reaches back to 1877. Not until the late 1940s, Trigg has started to develop, whereby many of the streets reaching through it were named after former residents, pioneers and local personalities.

<doc id="672314" wikidata="Q234417" url="?curid=672314" title="Yuu Watase">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist. She debuted in 1989 at the age of 18 with the short story &quot;Pajama de Ojama&quot; (, &quot;An Intrusion in Pajamas&quot;) and has since published more than 50 volumes of one-shots and long-running manga series. One of her most popular titles is &quot;Fushigi Yûgi&quot;. In 1998, Watase won the 43rd Shogakukan Manga Award in the  (girls&#x27;) category for &quot;Ceres, Celestial Legend&quot;. In 2008, she began her first  (boys&#x27;) serialization, &quot;&quot;.

==Early career and methods==

Watase was born on March 5, 1970, in Kishiwada, Osaka.

Watase developed an interest in drawing manga at a young age. However, Watase did not receive any formal training until after high school when she went to a private art school. There she was taught how to draw manga, but because her first short story, &quot;Pajama de Ojama&quot;, had already debuted, Watase quit in the middle of it.

Watase prefers to work with more traditional methods, because she believes the traditional methods have more feelings. Despite finding new media jarring, Watase has expressed a desire to work with new media as well. While Watase mostly works with colored inks and markers, she has used digital programs such as Adobe Photoshop to enhance traditional work.

==Issues in career==
In a 2014 blog post, Watase detailed some of the issues that she faced as a manga artist. A former editor for &quot;&quot; continuously asked Watase to redraw scenes that he did not like or understand. Watase was doing redraws all day and pulling late nights just to meet the next morning&#x27;s deadlines. Because of the constant cycle, Watase began to lose interest in working on the manga for the fans or even the story. She was simply working to try and get it approved for the weekly publication.

== Personal life ==
In 2019, Watase came out as X-gender, a Japanese non-binary gender identity. Following the announcement, an editor for Viz Media&#x27;s Shojo Beat imprint clarified that Watase&#x27;s pronouns in English are still &quot;she&quot; and &quot;her&quot;.

<text>Tuart Hill is a suburb of Perth, Western Australia.

Tuart Hill is named after the tuart tree that once grew extensively throughout the area, especially around Dog Swamp. In 1914 the suburb name of Grenville was proposed as a name for the suburb by the Grenville Progress Association, but not accepted due to its likeness to Granville in New South Wales.

==Events==
Since 1914, the Osborne Park Agricultural Society holds its annual show at Robinson Reserve in Tuart Hill.
The show is held around the last weekend in November on Friday and Saturday and features displays of local produce, animals and livestock, carnival attractions and fireworks.

==Facilities==
Tuart Hill has two large active recreation reserves: Grenville Reserve and Robinson Reserve. Grenville Reserve is a large cricket and football oval with facilities includes Council tennis courts, playground, cricket nets and centre wicket, change rooms, club rooms and public toilets. The ground is used by the Tuart Hill Cricket Club during summer months and various users during winter. Robinson Reserve similarly hosts cricket during summer with the Osborne Park Cricket Club being located at the reserve, since 1919. Robinson Reserve is adjacent to the Osborne Library and Community Centre.

==Schools==
There are two primary schools in Tuart Hill, the public Tuart Hill Primary School and the private St Kieran Catholic Primary School. Tuart Hill Primary School is heritage listed, having opened in 1910 as the Grenville State School. Servite College, a Catholic high school, is the only high school in Tuart Hill. Tuart Hill Senior High School once existed but was closed in the early 1980s to become Tuart College, a senior college run by the Western Australian Education Department, offering a number of courses such as a year 12 TEE program for students wanting to enter tertiary education, adult learning classes, or English language courses.

<doc id="672325" wikidata="Q697185" url="?curid=672325" title="Sepoy">
<text>Sepoy (), related to &quot;sipahi&quot;, is a term denoting professional Indian infantryman, traditionally armed with a musket, in the armies of the Mughal Empire and the Maratha.

In the 18th century, the French East India Company and its other European counterparts employed locally recruited soldiers within India, mainly consisting of infantry designated as &quot;sepoys&quot;. The largest sepoy force, trained along European lines, served the British East India Company.

The term &quot;sipahi&quot; (or sometimes &quot;sepoy&quot;) continues in use in the modern Indian, Pakistan and Nepalese armies, where it denotes the rank of private.

==Etymology==

In Persian (Aspa) means horse and Ispahai is also the word for cavalrymen.

The term &quot;sepoy&quot; is the anglicised form of the Persian word (), meaning the traditional &quot;infantry soldier&quot; in the Mughal Empire.

In the Ottoman Empire the term was used to refer to cavalrymen.

===Historical usage===
The term &quot;sepoy&quot; came into common use in the forces of the British East India Company in the eighteenth century, where it was one of a number of names, such as &quot;peons&quot;, &quot;gentoos&quot;, &quot;mestees&quot; and &quot;topasses&quot;, used for various categories of native soldier. Initially it referred to Hindu or Muslim soldiers without regular uniforms or discipline. It later generically referred to all native soldiers in the service of the European powers in India. Close to ninety-six percent of the British East India Company&#x27;s army of 300,000 men were native to India and these sepoys played a crucial role in securing the subcontinent for the company.

==Equipment==

The earliest sepoys used matchlock muskets and operated bulky and inefficient cannons to a limited extent during the reigns of Babur Akbar when archery and fighting from horseback was more common. By the time of Aurangzeb the Mughal armies had advanced significantly and utilized a wider range of weapons to win battles.
During the Carnatic Wars and Anglo-Mysore Wars the sepoys of the Mughal Empire employed more advanced types of musket, as well as blunderbuss and rocket weapons.

==History==
===Mughal Empire 16th–18th centuries===

A &quot;Sipahi&quot; or a sepoy was an infantryman armed with a musket in the army of the Mughal Empire.

The earliest sepoys were armed with daggers, talwars and matchlocks. By the mid to late 17th century they began to utilize more upgraded forms of muskets and even rockets. These sepoys also operated and mounted artillery pieces and sharpshooter upon war elephants which were also used for transport, hauling artillery and in combat.

By the 18th century individual Nawabs employed their own sepoy units as did the European merchant companies established in parts of India.

Sepoys became more visible when they gained European arms and fought for various fragmented polities of the Mughal Empire during the Carnatic Wars and the Bengal War. After which the importance of the local sepoy diminished and were replaced by the &quot;European hired Sepoy&quot;.

===Sepoys in British service===

The East India Company initially recruited sepoys from the local communities in the Madras and Bombay Presidencies. The emphasis here favored tall and soldierly recruits, broadly defined as being &quot;of a proper caste and of sufficient size&quot;. In the Bengal Army however, recruitment was only amongst high caste Brahmin and Rajput communities, mainly from the present day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar regions. Recruitment was undertaken locally by battalions or regiments often from the same community, village and even family. The commanding officer of a battalion became a form of substitute for the village chief or &quot;gaon bura&quot;. He was the &quot;mai-baap&quot; or the &quot;father and mother&quot; of the sepoys making up the &quot;paltan&quot; (from &quot;platoon&quot;). There were many family and community ties amongst the troops and numerous instances where family members enlisted in the same battalion or regiment. The &quot;izzat&quot; (&quot;honour&quot;) of the unit was represented by the regimental colours; the new sepoy having to swear an oath in front of them on enlistment. These colours were stored in honour in the quarter guard and frequently paraded before the men. They formed a rallying point in battle. The oath of fealty by the sepoy was given to the East India Company and included a pledge of faithfulness to the salt that one has eaten.

The salary of the sepoys employed by the East India Company, while not substantially greater than that paid by the rulers of Indian states, was usually paid regularly. Advances could be given and family allotments from pay due were permitted when the troops served abroad. There was a commissariat and regular rations were provided. Weapons, clothing and ammunition were provided centrally, in contrast to the soldiers of local kings whose pay was often in arrears. In addition local rulers usually expected their sepoys to arm themselves and to sustain themselves through plunder.

This combination of factors led to the development of a sense of shared honour and ethos amongst the well drilled and disciplined Indian soldiery who formed the key to the success of European feats of arms in India and abroad.

Following the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the surviving East India Company regiments were merged into a new Indian Army under the direct control of the British Crown. The designation of &quot;sepoy&quot; was retained for Indian soldiers below the rank of lance naik, except in cavalry where the equivalent ranks were &quot;sowar&quot; or &quot;trooper&quot;.
===Sepoys in French service===
Following the formation of the French East India Company (&#x27;) in 1719, companies of Indian sepoys () were raised to augment the French regulars and Swiss mercenary troops available. By 1720 the sepoys in French service numbered about 10,000. Although much reduced in numbers after their decisive defeat in India at the Battle of Wandewash in 1760, France continued to maintain a Military Corps of Indian Sepoys (&#x27;) in Pondicherry until it was disbanded and replaced by a locally recruited gendarmerie in 1898.
The 19th century diplomat Sir Justin Sheil commented about the British East India Company copying the French Indian army in raising an army of Indians:
===Sepoys in Portuguese service===
Sepoys were also recruited in Portuguese India. The term &#x27; (sepoy) was also applied by the Portuguese to African soldiers in Angola, Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea, plus African rural police officers. &#x27; from Angola provided part of the garrison of Goa during the final years of Portuguese rule of that Indian territory.

==Contemporary sepoys==
The title of &quot;sepoy&quot; is still retained in the modern Nepalese Army, Indian Army and Pakistan Army. In each of these it designates the rank of private.

==Other usages==
The same Persian word reached English via another route in the forms of and &#x27;. &#x27;, the Basque version of the word, is used by leftist Basque nationalists as an insult for members of the Basque Police, implying that they are not a national police of the Basque region due to their connection with the Spanish government.

In Hispanic American countries, especially in Argentina, the word &quot; has historically been used as a pejorative colloquial expression referring to individuals considered as serving foreign interests, as opposed to serving their own country.

<text>The Binghamton Rumble Ponies are an American Minor League Baseball team based in Binghamton, New York. The team, which plays in the Eastern League, is the Double-A affiliate of the New York Mets major-league club. The Rumble Ponies play in Mirabito Stadium, located in Binghamton.

==History==
In 1991, the New York Mets purchased the Williamsport Bills, and moved them to Binghamton, New York, in 1992 as the Binghamton Mets.

In 2016, the franchise announced a plan to stay in Binghamton for the foreseeable future, and to change the team&#x27;s name. The team held a name-the-team contest on its website from May 17 to June 1; the finalists were the Bullheads (for the bullhead catfish abundant in the nearby Susquehanna River), Gobblers (for the rich hunting culture of the area, as well as the turkeys in Binghamton), Rocking Horses (for the Triple Cities&#x27; nickname as the &quot;Carousel Capital of The World&quot;), Rumble Ponies (also a carousel tribute), Stud Muffins (for the collections of carousel horses in Binghamton), and Timber Jockeys (for everyone who rides the carousels). On November 3, 2016, the team announced that it would be rebranding as the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, and released a new logo. The Mets&#x27; High-A affiliate, the Brooklyn Cyclones, are also named after an amusement park ride, specifically, the Coney Island Cyclone roller coaster at Luna Park.

In 2019, Major League Baseball released a proposal to sever ties with 42 minor-league teams, including the Rumble Ponies and fellow Double-A teams such as the Erie SeaWolves and Chattanooga Lookouts, in 2021. On November 10, 2020, the Mets announced they would continue their affiliation with Binghamton, saving the Rumble Ponies from elimination. The team was organized into the Double-A Northeast. In 2022, the Double-A Northeast became known as the Eastern League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

On April 26, 2024, the Rumble Ponies&#x27; owners entered into an agreement to sell the team to Diamond Baseball Holdings.

<text>Jonas Galusha (February 11, 1753September 24, 1834) was the sixth and eighth governor of Vermont for two terms in the early 19th century.

==Biography==
Galusha, born in Norwich in the Colony of Connecticut, moved with his siblings and his parents, Jacob and Lydia Huntington Galusha, to Salisbury in 1769. In 1775, his family then moved to Shaftsbury.

Galusha&#x27;s father, Jacob, was a farmer and a blacksmith. Though their educations were limited and from the common schools, he and his brothers were leading men in the town and to some extent in the state.

During the American Revolution his brother David was a colonel in the Green Mountain Boys, and Galusha was a captain, fighting in the Battle of Bennington on August 16, 1777.

In 1778, Galusha married Mary Chittenden, daughter of Thomas Chittenden, Governor of the independent Republic of Vermont. The couple had nine children. Their son, Truman Galusha (The Truman Galusha House), also married into the Chittenden family, and moved his family to Jericho, near Burlington. His home there is also listed on the National Register. Another son, Elon Galusha was a well-known Baptist clergyman, and famous abolitionist.

==Career==
A farmer and an innkeeper, Galusha was elected Sheriff of Bennington County, and served in that capacity through annual elections from 1781 to 1787. In 1792 he was a member of the first Council of Censors after admission to the Union. (The Council of Censors met every seven years to review statutes passed by the Vermont General Assembly and ensure their constitutionality.) From 1793 to 1798 through successive elections, he was a member of the Governor&#x27;s Council (a group of 12 men with powers which made it nearly equivalent to a co-ordinate branch of the legislature. During that time, his wife, Mary, died in 1794; and he subsequently married Martha &quot;Patty&quot; Sammons, who died in 1797. His third wife was Abigail Ward, who died in 1809. He was a 6-time candidate for Vermont&#x27;s 1st congressional district: in 1796, 1802, 1804, 1806, and the regular and special elections in 1808. He ran as a Federalist in 1806, but otherwise was a Democratic-Republican.

Galusha was a county assistant judge from 1795 to 1798 and 1800 to 1806. He was a Judge of the Vermont Supreme Court in 1807 and in 1808. He married Abigail Ward in June 1808 and she died the following year. In 1808, he served as a presidential elector for the Democratic-Republican candidacy of James Madison.

The following year, Galusha was elected Governor of Vermont, serving until 1813. He was both the predecessor and the successor of the Federalist Martin Chittenden, brother of Galusha&#x27;s first wife, Mary Chittenden. During his governorship, he encouraged war with the United Kingdom in 1812. In 1814 he was a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. Galusha served another term as Governor of Vermont, elected year by year from 1815 to 1820. He was a presidential elector in the 1820 and 1824 elections.

Jonas Galusha was the namesake of Galusha Aaron Grow, a Congressman from Pennsylvania who served as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Grow&#x27;s aunt, who resided in Vermont, was asked to choose his name at his birth, and she selected &quot;Galusha&quot; because she admired Jonas Galusha, and &quot;Aaron&quot; because it was the name of her husband.

==Death==
Galusha&#x27;s fourth wife, Abigail &quot;Nabby&quot; Atwater Beach Galusha died in 1831. He died in Shaftsbury in 1834. He was active in the Baptist Church. He is interred at the Center Shaftsbury Cemetery, Shaftsbury, Center Shaftsbury, Bennington County, Vermont.

==The Gov. Galusha Homestead==

The imposing home known as The Gov. Galusha Homestead on Rt.7A in Center Shaftsbury, Vermont, is famous as one of Vermont&#x27;s architectural treasures. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The magnificent Palladian window over the front entrance, and many other details are the result of design by Lavius Fillmore, the famous colonial architect from Connecticut who also designed some of Vermont&#x27;s finest churches in Bennington and Middlebury. The house is also well known for several beautifully-preserved early wall paintings, rare examples of the colonial practice of using murals to imitate wallpaper, which was often unavailable in early Vermont. They are featured in a book called &quot;Early Vermont Wall Paintings&quot; by R. L. McGrath:
In 2010, the homestead and its farmland were protected by covenants between Galusha descendants and the Vermont Land Trust.

<text>Westminster is a suburb approximately 12 kilometres north of Perth, Western Australia. Its local government area is the City of Stirling.

Westminster was formerly the southern part of Balga but was renamed in 1995 at the request of residents. This was the name of the original estate that existed before residential subdivision. Between 1936 and 1955, a limestone road named &quot;Westminster Boulevard&quot; passed through the area.

Westminster is served by a small shopping centre, Stirling Central. The area is home to public and private primary schools and also contains a number of recreational areas. Regular bus services serve Westminster along Wanneroo Road and through the middle of the suburb. Westminster has 2 schools, Westminster Primary School and St Gerard’s Primary School.

The suburb is served by a number of Transperth bus routes operated by Path Transit and Swan Transit - including the 371, 375, 386 and 415 routes.
