<text>Spanish names are the traditional way of identifying, and the official way of registering, a person in Spain. They are composed of a given name (simple or composite) and two surnames (the first surname of each parent). Traditionally, the first surname is the father&#x27;s first surname, and the second is the mother&#x27;s first surname. Since 1999, the order of the surnames in a family in Spain is decided when registering the first child, but the traditional order is nearly universally chosen (99.53% of the time).



The practice is to use one given name and the first surname generally (e.g. &quot;Penélope Cruz&quot; for Penélope Cruz Sánchez); the complete name is reserved for legal, formal and documentary matters. Both surnames are sometimes systematically used when the first surname is very common (e.g., Federico García Lorca, Pablo Ruiz Picasso or José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero) to get a more distinguishable name. In these cases, it is even common to use only the second surname, as in &quot;Lorca&quot;, &quot;Picasso&quot; or &quot;Zapatero&quot;. This does not affect alphabetization: &quot;Lorca&quot;, the Spanish poet, must be alphabetized in an index under &quot;García Lorca&quot;, not &quot;Lorca&quot; or &quot;García&quot;.

Spanish naming customs were extended to countries under Spanish rule, influencing naming customs of Hispanic America and Philippines to different extent.

==Basic structure==
Currently in Spain, people bear a single or composite given name (&#x27; in Spanish) and two surnames (&#x27; in Spanish).

A composite given name is composed of two (or more) single names; for example, &quot;Juan Pablo&quot; is considered not to be a first and a second forename, but a single composite forename.

The two surnames refer to each of the parental families. Traditionally, a person&#x27;s first surname is the father&#x27;s first surname (&#x27;), while their second surname is the mother&#x27;s first surname (&#x27;). For example, if a man named &quot;Eduardo Fernández Garrido&quot; marries a woman named &quot;María Dolores Martínez Ruiz&quot; (note that women do not change their name with marriage) and they have a child named &quot;José&quot;, there are several legal options, but their child would most usually be known as &quot;José Fernández Martínez&quot;.

Spanish gender equality law has allowed surname transposition since 1999, subject to the condition that every sibling must bear the same surname order recorded in the &quot;&quot; (civil registry), but there have been legal exceptions. Since 2013, if the parents of a child were unable to agree on the order of surnames, an official would decide which is to come first, with the paternal name being the default option. The only requirement is that every son and daughter must have the same order of the surnames, so they cannot change it separately. Since June 2017, adopting the paternal name first is no longer the standard method, and parents are required to sign an agreement wherein the name order is expressed explicitly. The law also grants a person the option, upon reaching adulthood, of reversing the order of their surnames. However, this legislation only applies to Spanish citizens; people of other nationalities are issued the surname indicated by the laws of their original country.

Each of these two surnames can also be composite in itself, with the parts usually linked by:
*the conjunction &quot;y&quot; or &quot;e&quot; (and),
*the preposition &quot;de&quot; (of), or
*a hyphen.
For example, a person&#x27;s name might be &quot;Juan Pablo Fernández de Calderón García-Iglesias&quot;, consisting of a forename (&quot;Juan Pablo&quot;), a paternal surname (&quot;Fernández de Calderón&quot;), and a maternal surname (&quot;García-Iglesias&quot;).

===Forms of address===

A man named &quot;José Antonio Gómez Iglesias&quot; would normally be addressed as either &quot;señor Gómez&quot; or &quot;señor Gómez Iglesias&quot; instead of &quot;señor Iglesias&quot;, because &quot;Gómez&quot; is his first surname. Furthermore, Mr. Gómez might be informally addressed as
# &quot;José Antonio&quot;
# &quot;José&quot;
# &quot;Pepe&quot; (nickname for José)
# &quot;Antonio&quot; 
# &quot;Toño&quot; (nickname for Antonio)
# &quot;Joselito, Josito, Joselillo, Josico&quot; or &quot;Joselín&quot; (diminutives of José)
# &quot;Antoñito, Toñín&quot;, &quot;Toñito, Ñoño&quot; or &quot;Nono&quot; (diminutives of Antonio)
# &quot;Joseán&quot; (apocopation).
Very formally, he could be addressed with an honorific such as &quot;don José Antonio&quot; or &quot;don José&quot;.
It is not unusual, when the first surname is very common, like &quot;García&quot; in the example above, for a person to be referred to formally using both family names, or casually by their second surname only. For example, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero (elected President of the Spanish Government in the 2004 and 2008 general elections) is often called simply Zapatero, the name he inherited from his mother&#x27;s family since Rodríguez is a common surname and may be ambiguous. The same occurs with another former Spanish Socialist leader, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, with the poet and dramatist Federico García Lorca, and with the painter Pablo Ruiz Picasso. As these people&#x27;s paternal surnames are very common, they are often referred to by their maternal surnames (Rubalcaba, Lorca, Picasso). It would nonetheless be a mistake to index Rodríguez Zapatero under Z or García Lorca under L. (Picasso, who spent most of his adult life in France, is normally indexed under &quot;P&quot;.)

In an English-speaking environment, Spanish-named people sometimes hyphenate their surnames to avoid Anglophone confusion or to fill in forms with only one space provided for the last name: for example, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is of Puerto Rican heritage, is named &quot;Ocasio-Cortez&quot; because her parents&#x27; surnames are Ocasio-Roman and Ocasio-Cortez (née Cortez). She has publicly corrected people who referred to her as &quot;Cortez&quot; rather than &quot;Ocasio-Cortez&quot;.

In Spanish-speaking countries, hyphenated surnames arise when someone wants both the paternal and maternal surnames passed to future generations, and the next generation receives the two, hyphenated, as a single (paternal) surname. Occasionally the two are fused into a simple (unhyphenated) name, such as Jovellanos (from Jove and Llanos). Rarely, the two names are left unhyphenated, such as López Portillo, which may lead to confusion.

===Forenames===
Parents choose their child&#x27;s given name, which must be recorded in the &quot;&quot; (Civil Registry) to establish their legal identity. With few restrictions, parents can now choose any name; common sources of names are the parents&#x27; taste, honouring a relative, the General Roman Calendar &quot;nomina&quot; (nominal register), and traditional Spanish names. Legislation in Spain under Franco&#x27;s dictatorship legally limited cultural naming customs to only Christian (Jesus, Mary, saints) and typical Spanish names (Álvaro, Jimena, etc.). Although the first part of a composite forename generally reflects the gender of the child, the second personal name need not (e.g. José María Aznar). At present, the only naming limitation is the dignity of the child, who cannot be given an insulting name. Similar limitations applied against diminutive, familiar, and colloquial variants not recognized as names proper, and &quot;those that lead to confusion regarding sex&quot;;
however, current law allows registration of diminutive names.

====María, José and Jesús in composite given names====
Girls are often named &quot;María&quot;, honouring the Virgin Mary, by appending either a shrine, place, or religious-concept suffix-name to &quot;María&quot;. In daily life, such women omit the &quot;Mary of the ...&quot; nominal prefix, and use the suffix portion of their composite names as their public, rather than legal, identity. Hence, women with Marian names such as &quot;María de los Ángeles&quot; (María of the Angels), &quot;María del Pilar&quot; (María of the Pillar), and &quot;María de la Luz&quot; (María of the Light), are normally addressed as &quot;Ángeles&quot; (Angels), &quot;Pilar&quot; (Pillar), and &quot;Luz&quot; (Light); however, each might be addressed as &quot;María&quot;. Nicknames such as &quot;Maricarmen&quot; for &quot;María del Carmen&quot;, &quot;Marisol&quot; for &quot;María (de la) Soledad&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Solitude&quot;, the Virgin Mary), &quot;Dolores&quot; or &quot;Lola&quot; for &quot;María de los Dolores&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of Sorrows&quot;), &quot;Mercedes&quot; or &quot;Merche&quot; for &quot;María de las Mercedes&quot; (&quot;Our Lady of the Gifts&quot;), etc. are often used. Also, parents can simply name a girl &quot;María&quot;, or &quot;Mari&quot; without a suffix portion.

It is common for a boy&#x27;s formal name to include &quot;María&quot;, preceded by a masculine name, e.g. José María Aznar, Juan María Vicencio de Ripperdá or Antonio María Rouco Varela. Equivalently, a girl can be formally named &quot;María José&quot; , e.g. skier María José Rienda, and informally named &quot;Marijose&quot;, &quot;Mariajo&quot;, &quot;Majo&quot;, &quot;Ajo&quot;, &quot;Marisé&quot; or even &quot;José&quot; in honour of St. Joseph. &quot;María&quot; as a masculine name is often abbreviated in writing as &quot;M.&quot; (José M. Aznar), &quot;Ma.&quot; (José Ma. Aznar), or &quot;M.ª&quot; (José M.ª Morelos). It is unusual for any names other than the religiously significant &quot;María&quot; and &quot;José&quot; to be used in this way except for the name &quot;Jesús&quot; that is also very common and can be used as &quot;Jesús&quot; or &quot;Jesús María&quot; for a boy and &quot;María Jesús&quot; for a girl, and can be abbreviated as &quot;Sus&quot;, &quot;Chus&quot; and other nicknames.

===Registered names===

The &quot;&quot; (Civil Registry) officially records a child&#x27;s identity as composed of a forename (simple or composite) and the two surnames; however, a child can be religiously baptized with several forenames, e.g. Felipe Juan Froilán de Todos los Santos. Until the 1960s, it was customary to baptize children with three forenames: the first was the main and the only one used by the child; if parents agreed, one of the other two was the name of the day&#x27;s saint. Nowadays, baptizing with three or more forenames is usually a royal and noble family practice.

===Marriage===
In Spain, upon marrying, one does not change one&#x27;s surname. In some instances, such as high society meetings, the partner&#x27;s surname can be added after the person&#x27;s surnames using the preposition &quot;de&quot; (of). An example would be a &quot;Leocadia Blanco Álvarez&quot;, married to a &quot;Pedro Pérez Montilla&quot;, may be addressed as &quot;Leocadia Blanco de Pérez&quot; or as &quot;Leocadia Blanco Álvarez de Pérez&quot;. This format is not used in everyday settings and has no legal value. Similarly, a widow may be identified using the abbreviation &quot;vda.&quot; for &quot;viuda&quot; (&quot;widow&quot; in Spanish), as in &quot;Leocadia Blanco vda. de Pérez&quot;.

===Generational transmission===

In the generational transmission of surnames, the paternal surname&#x27;s precedence eventually eliminates the maternal surnames from the family lineage. Contemporary law (1999) allows the maternal surname to be given precedence, but most people observe the traditional paternal–maternal surname order. Therefore, the daughter and son of &quot;Ángela López Sáenz&quot; and &quot;Tomás Portillo Blanco&quot; are usually called &quot;Laura Portillo López&quot; and &quot;Pedro Portillo López&quot; but could also be called &quot;Laura López Portillo&quot; and &quot;Pedro López Portillo&quot;. The two surnames of all siblings must be in the same order when recorded in the &quot;&quot;. Spanish naming customs include the orthographic option of conjoining the surnames with the conjunction particle &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;e&quot; before a name starting with &#x27;I&#x27;, &#x27;Hi&#x27; or &#x27;Y&#x27;, (both meaning &quot;and&quot;) (e.g., &quot;José Ortega y Gasset&quot;, &quot;Tomás Portillo y Blanco&quot;, or &quot;Eduardo Dato e Iradier&quot;), following an antiquated aristocratic usage.
Patrilineal surname transmission was not always the norm in Spanish-speaking societies. Prior to the mid-eighteenth century, when the current paternal-maternal surname combination norm was adopted, Hispanophone societies often practised matrilineal surname transmission, giving children the maternal surname and occasionally giving children a grandparent&#x27;s surname (borne by neither parent) for prestige – being perceived as gentry – and profit, flattering the matriarch or the patriarch in hope of inheriting land. A more recent example can be found in the name of &quot;Francisco de Asís Franco y Martínez-Bordiú&quot; (born 1954), who took first the name of his mother, Carmen Franco, rather than that of his father, Cristóbal Martínez-Bordiú, 10th Marquis of Villaverde, in order to perpetuate the family name of his maternal grandfather, the &quot;Caudillo&quot; Francisco Franco.

Not every surname is a single word; such conjoining usage is common with doubled surnames (maternal-paternal), ancestral composite surnames bequeathed to the following generations – especially when the paternal surname is socially undistinguished. &quot;José María Álvarez del Manzano y López del Hierro&quot; is an example, his name comprising the composite single name &quot;José María&quot; and two composite surnames, &quot;Álvarez del Manzano&quot; and &quot;López del Hierro&quot;. Other examples derive from church place-names such as San José. When a person bears doubled surnames, the means of disambiguation is to insert &quot;y&quot; between the paternal and maternal surnames.

In case of illegitimacy – when the child&#x27;s father either is unknown or refuses to recognize his child legally – the child bears both of the mother&#x27;s surnames, which may be interchanged.

Occasionally, a person with a common paternal surname and an uncommon maternal surname becomes widely known by the maternal surname. Some examples include the artist Pablo Ruiz Picasso, the poet Federico García Lorca, and the politician José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero. With a similar effect, the foreign paternal surname of the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Hughes Galeano (his father was British) is usually omitted. (As a boy, however, he occasionally signed his name as &quot;Eduardo Gius&quot;, using a Hispanicized approximation of the English pronunciation of &quot;Hughes&quot;.) Such use of the second last name by itself is colloquial, however, and may not be applied in legal contexts.

Also rarely, a person may become widely known by both surnames, with an example being a tennis player Arantxa Sánchez Vicario – whereas her older brothers Emilio and Javier, also professional tennis players, are mainly known only by the paternal surname of Sánchez in everyday life, although they would &quot;formally&quot; be addressed as &quot;Sánchez Vicario&quot;.

===Navarrese and Álavan surnames===
Where Basque and Romance cultures have linguistically long coexisted, the surnames denote the father&#x27;s name and the (family) house or town/village. Thus the Romance patronymic and the place-name are conjoined with the prepositional particle &quot;de&quot; (&quot;from&quot;+&quot;provenance&quot;). For example, in the name &quot;José Ignacio López de Arriortúa&quot;, the composite surname &quot;López de Arriortúa&quot; is a single surname, despite &quot;Arriortúa&quot; being the original family name. This can lead to confusion because the Spanish &quot;López&quot; and the Basque &quot;Arriortúa&quot; are discrete surnames in Spanish and Basque respectively. This pattern was also in use in other Basque districts, but was phased out in most of the Basque-speaking areas and only remained in place across lands of heavy Romance influence, i.e. some central areas of Navarre and most of Álava. To a lesser extent, this pattern has been also present in Castile, where Basque-Castilian bilingualism was common in northern and eastern areas up to the 13th century.

A notable example of this system was &quot;Joaquina Sánchez de Samaniego y Fernández de Tejada&quot;, with both paternal and maternal surnames coming from this system, joined with an &quot;y&quot; (&quot;and&quot;).

==Nominal conjunctions==
===The particle &quot;de&quot; (of)===
In Spanish, the preposition particle &quot;de&quot; (&quot;of&quot;) is used as a conjunction in two different surname styles, and also used in a kind of placeholder role to disambiguate surnames that might be mistaken as additional forenames. The first style is in patronymic and toponymic surname formulæ, e.g. &quot;Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba&quot;, &quot;Pedro López de Ayala&quot;, and &quot;Vasco Núñez de Balboa&quot;, as in many &quot;conquistador&quot; names.

In names of persons, the prepositional particle &quot;de&quot; is written in lower-case when the forename has been included, e.g. &quot;José Manuel de la Rúa&quot; (&quot;of the street&quot;) and &quot;Cunegunda de la Torre&quot; (&quot;of the tower&quot;); when the forename has been omitted, the &quot;de&quot; is capitalized, e.g. &quot;doctor De la Rúa&quot; and &quot;señora De la Torre&quot;.

;Without a patronymic: Juan Carlos de Borbón. Unlike in French names such as d&#x27;Alembert, in Spanish orthography &quot;de&quot; is written out in full (not replaced by a contraction) when the surname begins with a vowel. The exception is &quot;de el&quot; (&quot;of the&quot;), which becomes &quot;del&quot;, e.g. &quot;Carlos Arturo del Monte&quot; (Charles Arthur of the Mountain).

;The patronymic exception: The current (1958) Spanish name law, &#x27; (Article 195 of the Civil Registry Regulations) does not allow a person to prefix &quot;de&quot; to their surname, except as the clarifying addition of &quot;de&quot; to a surname (&quot;apellido&quot;) that might be misunderstood as a forename (&#x27;); thus, a child would be registered as &quot;Pedro de Miguel Jiménez&quot; to avoid the surname &quot;Miguel&quot; being mistaken as the second part of a composite name, as &quot;Pedro Miguel&quot;.

Bearing the &quot;de&quot; particle does not necessarily denote a noble family; especially in names from eastern Castile, Alava, and western Navarre, the &quot;de&quot; usually meant simply &quot;from&quot;, and was applied to the place-name (town or village) from which the person and his or her ancestors originated. This differs from another practice established in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, in which &quot;de&quot; could be applied to one&#x27;s own name as a way of denoting the bearer&#x27;s noble heritage, to avoid the misperception that he or she was either a Jew or a Moor. In that time, many people, regardless of their true origins, used the particle, e.g. &quot;Miguel de Cervantes&quot;, &quot;Lope de Vega&quot;, etc.; moreover, following that fashion, a high noble such as &quot;Francisco Sandoval Rojas&quot; called himself &quot;Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas&quot;. During the eighteenth century, the Spanish nobility fully embraced the French custom of using &quot;de&quot; as a nobility identifier; however, since many commoners also bore the same particle, the use of &quot;de&quot; became unclear. Thus, nobility was emphasised with the surname&#x27;s lineage.

===The particle &quot;y&quot; (and)===
In the sixteenth century, the Spanish adopted the copulative conjunction &quot;y&quot; (&quot;and&quot;) to distinguish a person&#x27;s surnames; thus the Andalusian Baroque writer Luis de Góngora y Argote (1561–1627), the Aragonese painter Francisco José de Goya y Lucientes (1746–1828), the Andalusian artist Pablo Diego Ruiz y Picasso (1881–1973), and the Madrilenian liberal philosopher José Ortega y Gasset (1883–1955). In Hispanic America, this spelling convention was common among clergymen (e.g. Salvadoran Bishop Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez), and sanctioned by the &quot;&quot; (Civil Registry Law) of 1870, which required birth certificates to indicate the paternal and maternal surnames conjoined with &quot;y&quot; – thus, &quot;Felipe González y Márquez&quot; and &quot;José María Aznar y López&quot; are the respective legal names of the Spanish politicians Felipe González Márquez and José María Aznar López; however, unlike in Catalan, this usage is infrequent in Spanish. In the Philippines, &quot;y&quot; and its associated usages are retained only in formal state documents such as police records, but is otherwise dropped in favour of a more American-influenced naming order.

The conjunction &quot;y&quot; avoids denominational confusion when the paternal surname might appear to be a (first) name: without it, the physiologist Santiago Ramón y Cajal might appear to be named &quot;Santiago Ramón&quot; (composite) and surnamed &quot;Cajal&quot;, likewise the jurist &quot;Francisco Tomás y Valiente&quot;, and the cleric &quot;Vicente Enrique y Tarancón&quot;. Without the conjunction, the footballer Rafael Martín Vázquez, when referred to by his surnames &quot;Martín Vázquez&quot; mistakenly appears to be forenamed &quot;Martín&quot; rather than &quot;Rafael&quot;, whilst, to his annoyance, the linguist Fernando Lázaro Carreter occasionally was addressed as &quot;Don Lázaro&quot;, rather than as &quot;Don Fernando&quot; (Lázaro can be either forename or surname).

When the conjunction &quot;y&quot; is used and the maternal surname begins with an &quot;i&quot; vowel sound — whether written with the vowel &quot;I&quot; (&quot;Ibarra&quot;), the vowel &quot;Y&quot; (&quot;Ybarra&quot; archaic spelling), or the combination &quot;Hi&quot; + consonant (&quot;Higueras&quot;) — Spanish euphony substitutes &quot;e&quot; in place of the word &quot;y&quot;; thus the example of the Spanish statesman &quot;Eduardo Dato e Iradier&quot; (1856–1921).

==Denotations==
To communicate a person&#x27;s social identity, Spanish naming customs provide orthographic means, such as suffix-letter abbreviations, surname spellings, and place names, which denote and connote the person&#x27;s place in society.

===Identity and descent===
p. (father of): A man named like his son may add the lower-case suffix p. (denoting &quot;padre&quot;, father) to his surname. An example of this is &quot;José Luis Lorena, p.&quot; , to distinguish him from his son &quot;José Luis Lorena&quot;; the English analogue is &quot;Sr.&quot; (&quot;senior&quot;).

h. (son of): A man named like his father may append the lower-case suffix h. (denoting &quot;hijo&quot;, son) to his surname, thus distinguishing himself, &quot;Juan Gómez Marcos, h.&quot;, from his father, &quot;Juan Gómez Marcos&quot;; the English analogue is &quot;Jr.&quot; (&quot;junior&quot;).

====The suffix -ez====
Following the Visigothic invasion of the Iberian peninsula, the local population adopted to a large extent a patronymic naming system: the suffix &quot;-icī&quot; (a Latin genitive meaning &quot;son of&quot;) would be attached to the father&#x27;s forename to create a patronymic for the son. This suffix gradually evolved into different local forms, depending on the language. For example, the son of Fernando would be called:
* Basque: Fernanditz
* Castillan: Fernández
* Catalan: Ferrandis
* Portuguese and Galician: Fernandes

This system was most common in, but not limited to, the central region of Castile. Bare surnames, i.e. the father&#x27;s name without the suffix -itz/-ez/-is/-es, can also be found, and are especially common in Catalonia. This said, mass migration in the 20th century has led to a certain levelling of such regional differences.

In Catalan speaking areas, the suffixed surname &quot;Ferrandis&quot; is most common in the South (the Valencian Country) while in the North (Catalonia) the bare surname &quot;Ferran&quot; is more common. Furthermore, language contact led to the creation of multiple hybrid forms, as evidenced by the multiple Catalano-Castillan surnames, found especially in the Valencian Country: &quot;Fernàndez&quot;, &quot;Fernandis&quot;, &quot;Fernàndiz&quot;, &quot;Ferrandez&quot;, &quot;Ferràniz&quot;, &quot;Ferranis&quot;, etc.

Not every surname that resembles this pattern is patronymic. Due to the letters &quot;z&quot; and &quot;s&quot; being pronounced alike in American dialects of Spanish, many non-patronymic surnames with an &quot;-es&quot; have come to be written with an &quot;-ez&quot;. In American Spanish, the &quot;-ez&quot; spellings of &quot;Chávez&quot; (Hugo Chávez), &quot;Cortez&quot; (Alberto Cortez) and &quot;Valdez&quot; (Nelson Valdez) are not patronymic surnames, but simply variant spellings of the Iberian Spanish spelling with &quot;-es&quot;, as in the names of Manuel Chaves, Hernán Cortés and Víctor Valdés. For more on the &quot;-z&quot; surnames in Spanish see Influences on the Spanish language.

A number of the most common surnames with the patronymic suffix -ez:

* &quot;Álvarez&quot; – the son of Álvar, Álvaro
* &quot;Antúnez&quot; – the son of Antón, Antonio

* &quot;González&quot; – the son of Gonzalo
* &quot;Gutiérrez&quot; – the son of Gutierre, Gutier
* &quot;Hernández&quot; – the son of Hernando

* &quot;Velázquez, Velásquez&quot; – the son of Velasco
* &quot;Vélez&quot; – the son of Vela
===Foundlings===
Anonymous abandoned children were a problem for civil registrars to name. Some such children were named after the town where they were found (toponymic surname). Because most were reared in church orphanages, some were also given the surnames &quot;Iglesia&quot; or &quot;Iglesias&quot; (church[es]) and &quot;Cruz&quot; (cross). &quot;Blanco&quot; (with the meaning &quot;blank&quot;, rather than &quot;white&quot;) was another option. A toponymic first surname might have been followed by &quot;Iglesia(s)&quot; or &quot;Cruz&quot; as a second surname.

Nameless children were sometimes given the surname &quot;Expósito&quot;/&quot;Expósita&quot; (from Latin &quot;exposĭtus&quot;, &quot;exposed&quot;, meaning &quot;abandoned child&quot;), which marked them, and their descendants, as of a low caste or social class. Due to this, in 1921 Spanish law started to allow holders of the surname &quot;Expósito&quot; to legally change their surname. In the Catalan language, the surname &quot;Deulofeu&quot; (&quot;made by God&quot;) was often given out to these children, which is similar to &quot;De Dios&quot; (&quot;from God&quot;) in Castilian.

Furthermore, in Aragón abandoned children would receive the surname &quot;Gracia&quot; (&quot;grace&quot;) or &quot;de Gracia,&quot; because they were thought to survive by the grace of God.

===Foreign citizens===
In Spain, foreign immigrants retain use of their cultural naming customs, but upon becoming Spanish citizens, they are legally obliged to assume Spanish-style names (one forename and two surnames). If the naturalized citizen is from a one-surname culture, either their current surname is doubled or their mother&#x27;s maiden name is adopted as the second surname. For example, a Briton with the name &quot;Sarah Jane Smith&quot; could become either &quot;Sarah Jane Smith Smith&quot; or &quot;Sarah Jane Smith Jones&quot; upon acquiring Spanish citizenship. Formally, Spanish naming customs would also mean that the forename &quot;Sarah&quot; and middle name &quot;Jane&quot; would be treated as a compound forename: &quot;Sarah Jane&quot;.

===Flamenco artists===
Historically, flamenco artists seldom used their proper names. According to the flamenco guitarist Juan Serrano, this was because flamenco was considered disreputable and they did not want to embarrass their families:

This tradition of not using one&#x27;s proper name has persisted to the present day, even though flamenco is now legitimate. Sometimes the artistic name consists of the home town appended to the first name (Manolo Sanlúcar, Ramón de Algeciras); but many, perhaps most, such names are more eccentric: Pepe de la Matrona (because his mother was a midwife); Perico del Lunar (because he had a mole); Tomatito (son of a father known as &quot;Tomate&quot; (tomato) because of his red face); Sabicas (because of his childhood passion for green beans, from &quot;niño de las habicas&quot;); Paco de Lucía, born Francisco (&quot;Paco&quot;) Gustavo Sánchez Gomes, was known from infancy after his Portuguese mother, Lucía Gomes (de Lucía = [son] of Lucía). And many more. When referring to these artists by their assumed names, it makes no sense to shorten the name to its qualifier, such as &quot;Lucía&quot; or &quot;de Lucía&quot;; Paco, or perhaps &quot;el de Lucía&quot;, are the only options.

===Spanish hypocoristics and nicknames===
Many Spanish names can be shortened into hypocoristic, affectionate &quot;child-talk&quot; forms using a diminutive suffix, especially -ito and -cito (masculine) and -ita and -cita (feminine). Sometimes longer than the person&#x27;s name, a nickname is usually derived via linguistic rules. However, in contrast to English use, hypocoristic names in Spanish are only used to address a person in a very familiar environment – the only exception being when the hypocoristic is an artistic name (e.g. Nacho Duato born Juan Ignacio Duato). The common English practice of using a nickname in the press or media, or even on business cards (such as Bill Gates instead of William Gates), is not accepted in Spanish, being considered excessively colloquial. The usages vary by country and region; these are some usual names and their nicknames:

==Spain&#x27;s other languages==
The official recognition of Spain&#x27;s other written languages – Catalan, Basque, and Galician – legally allowed the autonomous communities to re-establish their vernacular social identity, including the legal use of personal names in the local languages and written traditions; these had been banned since 1938. This has sometimes been accomplished by re-spelling names to change Castilian Spanish forms into their original languages.

===Basque names===
The Basque-speaking territories (the Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre) follow Spanish naming customs (given names + two family names, the two family names being usually the father&#x27;s and the mother&#x27;s).

The given names are officially in one language or the other (Basque or Spanish), but often people use a translated or shortened version. A bilingual Basque-Spanish speaker will not necessarily bear a Basque name, and a monolingual Spanish speaker can use a Basque name or a Basque hypocoristic of an official Spanish name; e.g. a &quot;Francisco&quot; (official Spanish name) may be known as &quot;Patxi&quot; (Basque hypocoristic).

Some Basque-language names and surnames are foreign transliterations into the Basque tongue, e.g., &quot;Ander&quot; (English: &quot;Andrew&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Andrés&quot;), &quot;Mikel&quot; (English: &quot;Michael&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Miguel&quot;), or &quot;Ane&quot; (English: &quot;Anne&quot;; Spanish: &quot;Ana&quot;). In some cases, the name&#x27;s original-language denotation is translated to Basque, e.g., &quot;Zutoia&quot; and &quot;Zedarri&quot; denote the Spanish &quot;Pilar&quot; (English: &quot;Pillar&quot;). Moreover, some originally Basque names, such as &quot;Xabier&quot; and &quot;Eneko&quot; (English &quot;Xavier&quot; and &quot;Inigo&quot;), have been transliterated into Spanish (&quot;Javier&quot; and &quot;Íñigo&quot;).

Recently, Basque names without a direct equivalent in other languages have become popular, e.g. &quot;Aitor&quot; (a legendary patriarch), &quot;Hodei&quot; (&quot;cloud&quot;), &quot;Iker&quot; (&quot;to investigate&quot;), and &quot;Amaia&quot; (&quot;the end&quot;). Some Basque names without a definable meaning in Spanish are unique to the Basque language, for instance, &quot;Eneko&quot;, &quot;Garikoitz&quot;, &quot;Urtzi&quot;. After Franco&#x27;s death and the restoration of democracy in Spain, many Basque adults changed their Spanish names to their Basque equivalents, e.g. from &quot;Miguel&quot; to &quot;Mikel&quot;.

A source for modern Basque names is Sabino Arana&#x27;s &quot;Deun-Ixendegi Euzkotarra&quot; (&quot;Basque saint-name collection&quot;, published in 1910). Instead of the traditional Basque adaptations of Romance names, he proposed others he made up, and which in his opinion were truer to the originals and adapted better to Basque phonology. For example, his brother Luis became &quot;Koldobika&quot;, from Frankish &quot;Hlodwig&quot;. The traditional names &quot;Peru&quot; (from Spanish &quot;Pedro&quot;), &quot;Pello&quot; or &quot;Piarres&quot; (from French &quot;Pierre&quot;), all meaning &quot;Peter&quot;, became &quot;Kepa&quot; from Aramaic כיפא (Kepha). He believed that the suffix &quot;-[n]e&quot; was inherently feminine, and new names like &quot;Nekane&quot; (&quot;pain&quot;+&quot;ne&quot;, &quot;Dolores&quot;) or &quot;Garbiñe&quot; (&quot;clean&quot;+&quot;ne&quot;, &quot;Immaculate [Conception]&quot;) are frequent among Basque females.

Basque surnames usually denote the paternal house (in its literal sense of a dwelling place) of the bearer; e.g. &quot;Etxebarria&quot; – &quot;the new house&quot;, from &quot;etxe&quot; (house) + &quot;barri&quot; (new) + &quot;a&quot; (the), denotes &quot;related to a farmhouse of that name&quot;; in the same way, &quot;Garaikoetxea&quot; – &quot;the house in the heights&quot;, &quot;garai&quot; (&quot;height&quot;) + &quot;etxe&quot; (&quot;house&quot;) + &quot;a&quot; (the). Sometimes, surnames denote not the house itself but a characteristic of the place, e.g. &quot;Saratxaga&quot; – &quot;willow-place&quot;, from &quot;saratze&quot; (&quot;willow&quot;) + &quot;-aga&quot; (&quot;place of&quot;); &quot;Loyola&quot;, from &quot;loi&quot; (&quot;mud&quot;) + &quot;ola&quot; (&quot;iron smithery&quot;); &quot;Arriortua&quot; – &quot;stone orchard&quot;, from &quot;harri&quot; (&quot;stone&quot;) + &quot;ortua&quot; (&quot;orchard&quot;). Before the 20th century all Basque men were considered nobles (indeed, some Basque surnames, e.g. &quot;Irujo&quot; or &quot;Medoza&quot;, were related to some of the oldest Spanish noble families), and many of them used their status to emigrate with privileges to other regions of the Spanish Empire, especially the Americas; thus some Basque surnames became common in the Spanish-American world, e.g. &quot;Mendoza&quot; – &quot;cold mountain&quot;, from &quot;mendi&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot; + &quot;hotza&quot; (&quot;cold&quot;); &quot;Salazar&quot; – &quot;old hall&quot;, from &quot;sala&quot; (&quot;hall&quot;) + &quot;zahar&quot; (&quot;old&quot;). Until 1978, Spanish was the single official language of the Spanish civil registries, and Basque surnames had to be registered according to the Spanish phonetical rules (for example, the Spanish &quot;ch&quot; sound merges the Basque &quot;ts&quot;, &quot;tx&quot;, and &quot;tz&quot;, and someone whose surname in Standard Basque would be &quot;Krutxaga&quot; would have to write it as &quot;Cruchaga&quot;, the letter &quot;k&quot; also not being used in Spanish). Although the restoration of democracy ended this policy and allowed surnames to be officially changed into their Basque orthography, surnames of Basque origin now often have more than one spelling, even within the same family: a father born before 1978 would be surnamed &quot;Echepare&quot; and his children, &quot;Etxepare&quot;. This policy even changed the usual pronunciation of some Basque surnames. For instance, in Basque, the letter &quot;z&quot; maintained a sibilant &quot;s&quot;-like sound, while Spanish changed it; thus, a surname such as &quot;Zabala&quot; in Basque is properly read similar to sabala&quot; (), but in Spanish, where the &quot;z&quot; denotes a &quot;th&quot; sound (), it would be read as &quot;Tha-bala&quot; (). However, since the letter &quot;z&quot; exists in Spanish, the registries did not force the Zabalas to transliterate their surname.

In the Basque provinces of Biscay and Gipuzkoa, it was uncommon to take a surname from the place (town or village) where one resided, unless one was a foundling; in general, people bearing surnames such as &quot;Bilbao&quot; (after the Basque city of Bilbao) are descendants of foundlings. However, in the Basque province of Alava and, to a lesser extent, in Navarre, it was common to add one&#x27;s birth village to the surname using the Spanish particle &quot;de&quot; to denote a &quot;toponymic&quot;, particularly when the surname was a common one; for instance, someone whose surname was &quot;Lopez&quot; and whose family was originally from the valley of &quot;Ayala&quot; could employ &quot;Lopez de Ayala&quot; as a surname. This latter practice is also common in Castile.

Basque compound surnames are relatively common, and were created by combining two discrete surnames, e.g. &quot;Elorduizapaterietxe&quot; – &quot;Elordui&quot; + &quot;Zapaterietxe&quot;, a practice denoting family allegiances or the equal importance of both families. Since compound surnames could themselves be used to create new compounds, this custom sometimes resulted in incredibly long surnames. For example, the longest surname recorded in Spain is the compound Basque name &quot;Burionagonatotoricagageazcoechea&quot;, formed by &quot;Buriona&quot;+ &quot;Gonatar&quot; + &quot;Totorika&quot; + &quot;Beazcoetxea&quot;.

Basque nationalist leader Sabino Arana pioneered a naming custom of transposing the name-surname order to what he thought was the proper Basque language syntax order; e.g. the woman named &quot;Miren Zabala&quot; would be referred to as &quot;Zabala&#x27;taŕ Miren&quot; – the surname first, plus the &quot;-tar&quot; suffix denoting &quot;from a place&quot;, and then the name. Thus, &quot;Zabala&#x27;taŕ Miren&quot; means &quot;Miren, of the Zabala family&quot;. The change in the order is effected because in the Basque language, declined words (such as &quot;Zabala&#x27;taŕ&quot;) that apply to a noun are placed before the noun itself; another example of this would be his pen name, &quot;Arana ta Goiri&#x27;taŕ Sabin&quot;. This Basque naming custom was used in nationalist literature; in formal official documents, the Castilian naming order is observed.

===Catalan names=== 
The Catalan-speaking territories mainly abide by Spanish naming customs, though discrete surnames are usually joined with the word &quot;i&quot; (&quot;and&quot;) instead of the Spanish &quot;y&quot;; this practice is very common in formal contexts. For example, the former president of the Generalitat de Catalunya (Government of Catalonia) is formally called &quot;El Molt Honorable Senyor Pere Aragonès i Garcia&quot;. The national language policy enumerated in article 19.1 of Law 1/1998 stipulates that &quot;the citizens of Catalonia have the right to use the proper regulation of their Catalan names and surnames and to introduce the conjunction between surnames&quot;.

The correction, translation, and change of surnames are regulated by the &quot;Registro Civil&quot; (Civil Registry) in decree 138/2007 of 26 June, modifying decree 208/1998 of 30 July, which regulates the accreditation of the linguistic correctness of names. Decree 138/2007 of 26 July regulates the issuance of language-correction certificates for translated Catalan names by the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Estudis Catalans&quot; (Institute of Catalan Studies) in Barcelona. Nevertheless, there are Catalan surnames that conform to neither the current spelling rules nor the traditionally correct Catalan spelling rules; a language-correction certification can be requested from the institute, for names such as these:
* Aleñá→Alenyà
* Caballé→Cavaller
* Cañellas→Canyelles
* Casas→Cases
* Corominas→Coromines
* Fábregas→Fàbregues
* Farré→Ferrer
* Figueras→Figueres
* Gabarra→Gavarra
* Gafarot→Gaferot
* Gumbau→Gombau
* Doménech→Domènec
* Jufré→Jofré
* Junqueras→Jonqueres
* Mayoral→Majoral
* Montañà→Montanyà
* Perpiñán→Perpinyà
* Pijuan→Pijoan
* Piñol→Pinyol
* Puyol→Pujol
* Roselló→Rosselló
* Rusiñol→Rossinyol 
* Tarradellas→Tarradelles
* Viñallonga→Vinyallonga
* Viñes→Vinyes
====Catalan hypocoristics and nicknames====
Many Catalan names are shortened to hypocoristic forms using only the final portion of the name (unlike Spanish, which mostly uses only the first portion of the name), and with a diminutive suffix (&quot;-et, -eta/-ita&quot;). Thus, shortened Catalan names taking the first portion of the name are probably influenced by the Spanish tradition. The influence of Spanish in hypocoristics is recent since it became a general fashion only in the twentieth century ; example Catalan names are:

* Antoni/Antònia = &quot;Toni, Tònia, Tonet/a&quot;
* Bartomeu = &quot;Tomeu&quot;
* Concepció = &quot;Ció&quot;
* Cristina = &quot;Tina&quot;
* Dolors = &quot;Lloll, Dolo, Loles&quot;
* Elisabet/h = &quot;Bet, Beth, Eli, Lis&quot;
* Eulàlia = &quot;Laia, Olaia, Lali&quot;

* Gabriel = &quot;Biel&quot;
* Ignasi = &quot;Nasi&quot;
* Isabel = &quot;Bel, Bet&quot;

* Jordi = &quot;Toti&quot;
* Jordina = &quot;Jordi&quot;
* Josefina = &quot;Fina, Fineta&quot;
* Josep Maria = &quot;Pemi&quot;

* Maria Lluïsa = &quot;Marissa&quot;
* Maria Soletat = &quot;Marissol&quot;
* Mariona = &quot;Ona, Miona&quot;
* Meritxell = &quot;Txell, Meri&quot;
* Montserrat = &quot;Serrat, Montse, Munsa, Muntsa&quot;
* Narcís/isa = &quot;Narciset/a, Ciset/a, Ciso/a&quot;
* Núria = &quot;Nuri&quot;
* Onofre = &quot;Nofre&quot;
* Oriol = &quot;Uri&quot;
* Rafel = &quot;Fel, Feló, Rafa&quot;
* Salvador = &quot;Vadó, Voro&quot; (in Valencia)
* Sebastià/ana = &quot;Tià/ana, Sebas&quot;
* Sergi = &quot;Keki&quot;
* Vicent = &quot;Vicentó, Cento&quot;
* Xavier = &quot;Xavi, Xevi, Javi&quot; (the J is pronounced as in English)
===Galician names===
The Galician-speaking areas also abide by the Spanish naming customs. The main differences are the usage of Galician given names and surnames.

==== Galician surnames ====

Most Galician surnames have their origin in local toponymies, including Galician regions (Salnés &lt; Salnés, Carnota, Bergantiños), towns (Ferrol, Noia), parishes or villages (as Andrade). Just like elsewhere, many surnames were also generated from jobs or professions (Carpinteiro &#x27;carpenter&#x27;, Cabaleiro &#x27;Knight&#x27;, Ferreiro &#x27;Smith&#x27;, Besteiro &#x27;Crossbowman&#x27;), physical characteristics (Gago &#x27;Twangy&#x27;, Tato &#x27;Stutterer&#x27;, Couceiro &#x27;Tall and thin&#x27;, Bugallo &#x27;fat&#x27;, Pardo &#x27;Swarthy&#x27;), or origin of the person (Franco and Francés &#x27;French&#x27;, Portugués &#x27;Portuguese&#x27;).

Although many Galician surnames have historically been adapted to Spanish phonetics and orthography, they are still clearly recognizable as Galician words: Freijedo, Spanish adaptation of &quot;freixedo&quot; &#x27;place with ash-trees&#x27;; Seijo from &quot;seixo&quot; &#x27;stone&#x27;; Doval from &quot;do Val&quot; &#x27;of the Valley&#x27;; Rejenjo from &quot;Reguengo&quot;, Galician evolution of local Latin-Germanic word &quot;Regalingo&quot; &#x27;Royal property&#x27;.

Specially relevant are the Galician surnames that originated from medieval patronymics, present in local documentation since the 9th century, and popularized from the 12th century on. Although many of them were historically adapted to Spanish orthography, phonetics and traditions, many are still characteristically Galician; the most common ones are:
* Alonso (medieval form &quot;Afonso&quot;, from the latinicized Germanic name &quot;Adefonsus&quot;).
* Álvarez (from medieval Alvares, from the Germanic name &quot;Halvar(d)&quot;, latinicized as &quot;Alvarus&quot;).
* Ares (from the name &quot;Arias&quot; or the town of Ares).
* Bermúdez (medieval form &quot;Vermues&quot;, from the latinicized Germanic name &quot;Veremodus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Bernárdez (from the Frankish name &quot;Bernard&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Vieitez, Vieites (from the name &quot;Bieito&quot;, from Latin &quot;Benedictus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Diz, Díaz (from the name Didacus + suffix -ici-).
* Domínguez (medieval form &quot;Domingues&quot;, derived of the name &quot;Domingo&quot;, from Dominicus, + suffix -ici-).
* Enríquez (medieval form &quot;Anrriques&quot;, from the Frankish name &quot;Henric&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Estévez (medieval form &quot;Esteves&quot;, from the name &quot;Estevo&quot;, derived of &quot;Stephanus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Fernández (medieval form &quot;Fernandes&quot;, from the name &quot;Fernando&quot;, derived from the Germanic name &quot;Fredenandus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Froiz (medieval form &quot;Froaz&quot;, from the Germanic name &quot;Froila&quot; &#x27;Lord&#x27; + suffix -ici-).
* García (medieval form &quot;Garçia&quot;, from the name &quot;Garcia&quot;).
* Giance (from the name &quot;Xian&quot;, old orthography &quot;Jiam&quot;, derived of Latin &quot;Iulianus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Gómez (medieval form &quot;Gomes&quot;, from the name &quot;Gomes&quot;).
* González (medieval form &quot;Gonçalves&quot;, from the latinicized Germanic name &quot;Gundisalvus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* López (medieval form &quot;Lopes&quot;, from the Latin nickname &quot;Lupus&quot; &#x27;wolf&#x27;).
* Lourenzo, Lorenzo (medieval form &quot;Lourenço&quot;, from the Latin name &quot;Laurentius&quot;).
* Martínez, Martín, Martís (from the Latin name &quot;Martinus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Méndez (medieval form &quot;Meendes&quot;, from the name &quot;Mendo&quot;, from &quot;Menendus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Miguéns (from the name &quot;Miguel&quot;, derived of &quot;Michael&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Núñez (medieval form &quot;Nunes&quot;, derived from the name &quot;Nunnus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Paz, Paes, Pais (from the name &quot;Paio&quot;, derived from &quot;Pelagius&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Pérez (medieval form &quot;Peres&quot;, from the name &quot;Pero&quot;, derived of &quot;Petrus&quot;, + suffix -ici-).
* Raimúndez (from the Frankish name &quot;Raimund&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Rodríguez (from the name &quot;Rodrigo&quot;, from the latinicized Germanic form &quot;Rodericus&quot; + suffix -ici-).
* Rois (from the name &quot;Roi&quot;, nickname of &quot;Rodrigo&quot; + suffix -ici-): Spanish &#x27;Ruiz&#x27;.
* Sánchez (medieval form &quot;Sanches&quot;, from the name &quot;Sancho&quot;, derived from Latin Sanctius + suffix -ici-).
* Sueiro, Suárez (medieval forms &quot;Sueiro, Suares&quot;, from the name &quot;Suarius&quot;, with and without suffix -ici-).
* Vázquez (medieval form &quot;Vasques&quot;, from the name &quot;Vasco&quot;, from &quot;Velasco&quot;, + suffix -ici-).
* Yanes (medieval forms &quot;Eanes&quot;, &quot;Ianes&quot;. from &quot;Iohannes,&quot; Yohannes + suffix -ici-).
Some of them (namely Páez, Méndez, Vázquez) show characteristic Galician dropping of intervocalic -l-, -d-, -g- and -n- (although Lugo is the only province in Spain with a majority of people surnamed &quot;López&quot;).

Nicknames are usually obtained from the end of a given name, or through derivation. Common suffixes include masculine -iño, -ito (as in &quot;Sito&quot;, from &quot;Luisito&quot;), -echo (&quot;Tonecho&quot;, from &quot;Antonecho&quot;) and -uco (&quot;Farruco&quot;, from &quot;Francisco&quot;); and feminine -iña, -ucha/uxa (&quot;Maruxa&quot;, &quot;Carmucha&quot;, from &quot;Maria&quot; and &quot;Carme&quot;), -uca (&quot;Beluca&quot;, from &quot;Isabeluca&quot;), and -ela (&quot;Mela&quot;, from &quot;Carmela&quot;).

===Ceuta and Melilla===
As the provincial &quot;Surname distribution&quot; map (above) indicates, Mohamed is an often-occurring surname in the autonomous Mediterranean North African cities of Ceuta and Melilla (respectively registered 10,410 and 7,982 occurrences), Hispanophone Muslims use the Spanish &quot;Mohamed&quot; spelling for &quot;Muhammad&quot;. As such, it is often a component of Arabic names for men; hence, many Ceutan and Melillan Muslims share surnames despite not sharing a common ancestry. Furthermore, &quot;Mohamed&quot; (Muhammad) is the most popular name for new-born boys, thus it is not unusual to encounter a man named &quot;Mohamed Mohamed Mohamed&quot;: the first occurrence is the given name, the second occurrence is the paternal surname, and the third occurrence is the maternal surname.

== Indexing ==

In English, the Chicago Manual of Style recommends that Spanish and Hispanophone names be indexed by the family name. When there are two family names, the indexing is done under the father&#x27;s family name; this would be the first element of the surname if the father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s or husband&#x27;s family names are joined by a &quot;y&quot;. Depending upon the person involved, the particle &quot;de&quot; may be treated as a part of a family name or it may be separated from a family name. The indexing of Hispanophone names differs from that of Portuguese or Lusophone names, where the final element of the name is indexed because the Portuguese custom is for the father&#x27;s surname to follow, rather than precede, the mother&#x27;s. The effect is that the father&#x27;s surname is the one indexed for both Spanish and Portuguese names.

<doc id="665654" wikidata="Q16976091" url="?curid=665654" title="Shaft and chamber tomb">
<text>A shaft and chamber tomb is a type of chamber tomb used by some ancient peoples for burial of the dead. They consist of a shaft dug into the outcrops of rock with a square or round chamber excavated at the bottom where the dead were placed. These chambers can consist of a single shaft and chamber like the Mexican tombs or sometimes quite elaborate as was built in ancient Egypt.

Shaft and chamber tombs are found at Xemxija in Malta which are Neolithic and &quot;Dayeh-va-dokhtar&quot; tombs in Fars province of Iran. They were also employed by the ancient Egyptians. The late pre-Classic and early Classic Era cultures of west Mexico (what are now the states of Colima, Nayarit, and Jalisco) used tombs of this kind and much of what little is known about these cultures is known from art objects found in these tombs. As a result, these early West Mexico cultures are sometimes referred to as the West Mexico shaft tomb culture.

== Early Egyptian shaft and chamber tombs ==
The first shaft and chamber tomb known to have been used by the ancient Egyptians is the mastaba tomb.

== Western Mexico ==
The West Mexico Tombs are known as the &quot;Shaft and Chamber culture&quot;. The Aztecs and Toltecs are part of this area. The Maya culture is south of Western Mexico.

The Tombs of Western Mexico and Central America have similar tombs and in part of Ecuador and Columbia these practices were used until the 20th century. The tombs were known for having funerary goods. looting of these tombs was not uncommon. Mexican artists took an interest in collecting these looted ceramics from these tombs and their traditions. Artists such as Frieda Kahlo and Diego Rivera. Deep-shaft-and-chamber tombs are found in western Mexico and northwestern South America. These two areas have been discovered to have been similarly designed, in regards to, the ideology, religion, form, and geographical significance. The tombs were not just a way of communicating for the living and the dead, but also, they were, grounds to store supernatural properties. Items such as conch shells and shamanistic attributes (a horn being, associated with supernatural powers) were also stored in the tombs. Shamanistic art has been identified in the Western Mexico tombs, according to the ethnohistorical accounts. Spanish writers, referred to the shamans as sorcerers. The Peruvian data claimed that the shamans were buried alongside shamanistic rites when they died. The conch shells were also manifestations of shamanistic ideals as well as practices. Evidence is provided of this as these shells were painted on the Moche V stirrup spout vessels that originated from Peru. One of the Huaca shrines, shaft tombs had a wall in the shape of a conch shell.

The Jalisco and Nayarit cultures are incorporated with the Western Mexico culture Colima. The Colima culture has had an agrarian reputation. Most shaft tombs as well as the Colima culture have stored religious art in their tombs. Figurines of animals and people are stored in the shaft tombs of Colima. These figurines are known as Colima flats.

During the construction of the Tequila Valleys of Central Jalisco, labor-intensive construction was at hand. Known as the Core of the &quot;shaft tomb&quot; tradition due to the wealth of the tomb, the labor involved in building the tomb, and the social distinctions key role within these cultures&#x27; identities. Ceramic Data is an essential component to the Tequila Valley tomb.

==Central American and Mesoamerican tombs==

Research into New World shaft tombs and the Western Mexico and Central American tombs has been difficult due to looting. Shaft tombs did not prosper in Mesoamerica, as they did in northwestern South America, which has led to Joseph B. Mountjoy and Mary K. Sandford suggesting that northwestern South America could be the origin of these tombs.

Shaft tombs appeared in Western Mexico during the Mesoamerican period (1500 BCE – 200 CE) and also during the Pre classic period (300 BCE – 150 CE). Shaft tombs vary from 10 to 65 feet deep and built under structures. A reason why they are called shaft tombs is because they use shaft stones to mark the location of the tomb. The labor required to build these tombs indicate that higher social classes were buried in them. In 1993 the first un-looted tomb was discovered at Huitzilapa in Jalisco. Shaft tombs were normally found in three Western Mexican states: Jalisco, Nayarit, and Colima.

In Jalisco the tombs found have figurines that are made from clay, have elongated faces and high foreheads. At Nayarit there are sculptures that have painted details and wildly separate eyes. These figures are called Chinnesco because their widely separate eyes give them a Chinese like appearance. Tombs at Colima have hallow figures of animals, humans and plants which are made from warm brown slip (watery clay molded by hand). Other figurines that are also found at this site are ceramic dogs. Ceramic dogs are hairless dogs and are very important to their culture as they have multiple roles in the underworld. These include being the watch dog to the dead, healers, and a source of food. Shaft tombs also contain other offerings such as pottery containing food, beads, crystals, jade and conch shells.

The Sipan tomb has been deemed Lord of Sipan, enclosed with eight other individuals, presumably wives and servants of Sipan. The paintings in the looted tombs of the Moche are essential because they did not have a written language. The pottery scenes and the wall drawings depict how sacrifice was a core component to the Moche and their beliefs. Sacrifice was essential for the Moche so they could offer their warrior-priest blood in a goblet to appease him. There were two Sipan tombs that were unlooted. In both tombs, there was a moche elite as well as a warrior. It was confirmed by archaeologists that the warriors had no feet. It is assumed that there were ritual amputations performed to make sure that the warriors could not abandon their post in the afterlife.

The Tomb of the Triclinium celebrated the deceased because they were embracing the afterlife. This tomb is an Etruscan chamber tomb. It is located in Italy.

<text>Blagoveshchensk (, ) is a city and the administrative center of Amur Oblast, Russia. It is located at the confluence of the Amur and the Zeya Rivers, opposite to the Chinese city of Heihe. Population: The Amur has formed Russia&#x27;s border with China since the 1858 Aigun Treaty and the 1860 Treaty of Peking. The area north of the Amur belonged to the Manchu Qing dynasty by the Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689 until it was ceded to Russia by the Aigun Treaty in 1858.

==History==
===Early history of the region===
The early residents of both sides of the Amur in the region of today&#x27;s Blagoveshchensk were the Daurs and Duchers. An early settlement in the area of today&#x27;s Blagoveshchensk was the Ducher town whose name was reported by the Russian explorer Yerofey Khabarov as Aytyun in 1652, as Aigun from 1683 to 1685, and as Aigun Old Town from 1685 until the massacre in 1900, which is known to Russian archaeologists as the Grodekovo site, after the nearby village of Grodekovo about southeast of Blagoveshchensk. The Grodekovo site is thought by archaeologists to have been populated since ca. AD 1000.
As the Russians tried to assert their control over the region, the Ducher town was probably vacated when the Duchers were evacuated by the Qing to the Sungari or Hurka in the mid-1650s. Since 1673, the Chinese reused the site for their fort (&quot;Old Aigun&quot;, in modern literature), which served in 1683-1685 as a base for the Manchus&#x27;s campaign against the Russian fort of Albazin further north.

After the capture of Albazin in 1685 or 1686, the Chinese relocated their town, to a new site on the right (southwestern, i.e. presently Chinese) bank of the Amur, about downstream from the original site; it later became known as Aigun.

The series of conflicts between Russians and China ended with Russia&#x27;s recognition of the Chinese sovereignty over both sides of the Amur by the Nerchinsk Treaty of 1689.

===Russian settlement===
As the balance of power in the region had changed by the mid-19th century, the Russian Empire was able to take over the left (generally northern, but around Blagoveshchensk, eastern) bank of the Amur from China. Since the 1858 Aigun Treaty and the 1860 Treaty of Peking, the river has remained the border between the countries, although the Qing subjects were allowed to continue to live in the so-called Sixty-Four Villages east of the Amur and the Zeya (i.e., within today&#x27;s Blagoveshchensk&#x27;s eastern suburbs).
Although Russian settlers had lived in the area as early as 1644 and was known as (), the present-day city began in 1856 as the military outpost of &quot;Ust-Zeysky&quot;; this name means &quot;settlement at the mouth of the Zeya River&quot; in Russian. Tsar Alexander II gave approval for the founding of the city in 1858 as the seat of government for the Amur region, to be named Blagoveshchensk (literally &quot;the city of good news&quot;) after the parish church which was dedicated to the Annunciation. According to Blagoveshchensk authorities, by 1877 the city had some 8,000 residents, with merely 15 foreigners (presumably, Chinese) among them.

The city was an important river port and trade centre during the late 19th century, with growth further fuelled by a gold rush early in the 20th century and by its position on the Chinese border opposite the city of Heihe.

Local historians noted the pre-eminence of Blagoveshchensk in the economy of the late 19th century Russian Far East, which was reflected when the heir to the Russian throne, Nicholas Alexandrovich (the future Tsar Nicholas II), visited in 1891 during his grand tour of Asiatic Russia, and the locals presented him with bread and salt on a gold tray, rather than on a silver one as in other cities of the region.

===The Boxer Rebellion===
In the course of the Boxer Rebellion, the Qing Imperial army (made out of Manchus and Han Chinese) and Boxer insurgents shelled the city in July 1900. Chinese Honghuzi forces joined the attack against Blagoveshchensk. According to the Orthodox belief, the city was allegedly saved by a miraculous icon of Our Lady of Albazin, which was prayed to continuously during the shelling which lasted almost two weeks.

On 3 July (Old Style), a decision was made by the city&#x27;s Police Chief Batarevich and the Military Governor Gribsky to deport the city&#x27;s entire community of Qing subjects including ethnic Manchus, Daur people and Han, numbering 4,008), who were viewed as potential fifth columnists. As cross-river shipping was interrupted by the rebellion, the question arose how to get them from the Russian to the Chinese side of the Amur. Batarevich suggested that the deportees could be first taken east of the Zeya, where they should obtain boats from the local Chinese villagers. The plan, however, was vetoed by the governor, and the decision was made instead to take the deportees to the &quot;stanitsa&quot; of Verkhneblagoveshchenskaya—the place where the Amur is at its narrowest—and make them leave Russia there. As the local &quot;ataman&quot; refused to provide boats to take them across the river (despite the orders of his superior), few of them made it to the Chinese side. The rest drowned in the Amur, or were shot or axed by the police, Cossacks and local volunteers, if they refused to leave the bank. Local Chinese memory holds that a massacre that took place then, at the hands of the Cossacks, which killed so many that the Amur River was choked. According to Chinese sources, about 5,000 people reportedly died during these events of 4–8 July 1900.

There were 1,266 households in the city, including 900 Daurs and 4,500 Manchus until the massacre. Many Manchu villages were burned by Cossacks in the massacre according to Victor Zatsepine.

This expulsion of the local Chinese caused some hardships for Blagoveshchensk consumers. For example, during the second half of 1900 it became almost impossible to buy any green vegetables in the town, and ten eggs would cost 30-50 kopecks (and in winter, as much as a rouble), while before it had been possible to buy ten eggs for 10-15 kopecks.

The massacre angered the Chinese and had ramifications for the future: the Chinese Honghuzi fought a guerilla war against Russian occupation and assisted the Japanese in the Russo-Japanese War against the Russians in revenge. Louis Livingston Seaman mentioned the massacre as being the reason for the Chinese Honghuzi hatred towards the Russians:The Chinaman, be he Hung-hutze or peasant, in his relation to the Russians in this conflict with Japan has not forgotten the terrible treatment accorded him since the Muscovite occupation of Manchuria. He still remembers the massacre at Blagoveshchensk when nearly 8,000 unarmed men, women, and children were driven at the point of the bayonet into the raging Amur, until — as one of the Russian officers who participated in that brutal murder told me at Chin-Wang-Tao in 1900 — &quot;the execution of my orders made me almost sick, for it seemed as though I could have walked across the river on the bodies of the floating dead.&quot; Not a Chinaman escaped, except forty who were employed by a leading foreign merchant who ransomed their lives at a thousand roubles each. These, and many even worse, atrocities are remembered and now is their moment for revenge. So, it was easy for Japan to enlist the sympathy of these men, especially when emphasized by liberal pay, as is now the case. It is believed that more than 10,000 of these bandits, divided into companies of from 200 to 300 each and led by Japanese officers, are now in the pay of Japan.

===Civil war and the Soviet era===

The city was also the site of conflict during the Russian Civil War, with Japanese troops occupying the city in support of the White Army. From 1920 until 1922, the city was declared part of the Far Eastern Republic, an area which was nominally independent, but in reality, a buffer zone under control of the Russian SFSR. The city became the administrative centre of Amur Oblast in 1932.

During the Cultural Revolution in China, the city was subject to Maoist propaganda blasted from loudspeakers across the river 24 hours a day.

==Administrative and municipal status==

Blagoveshchensk is the administrative centre of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative centre of Blagoveshchensky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is, together with six rural localities, incorporated separately as Blagoveshchensk Urban Okrug—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, this administrative unit also has urban okrug status.

==Politics==
In July 2013, a public hearing was held at which citizens declared themselves to be in favour of a return to the direct election of the mayor. A meeting of deputies voted for rejection of the &quot;two-headed&quot; management. In September 2013, City Council voted for a return to the 

==Geography==
The city is located at the confluence of the Amur and the Zeya Rivers, opposite the Chinese city of Heihe.

===Climate===
Blagoveschensk experiences a monsoon-influenced hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dwa&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dcac&quot;), bordering on a monsoon-influenced warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dwb&quot;, &quot;Dcbc&quot;) which it had before 1990. The climate is very strongly continental. The city features frigid, windy, but dry winters due to the influence of the Siberian high, and warm, wet summers, due to the East Asian monsoon. On 1 August 2011, it became the first city in the Russian Far East to be hit by a tornado..
Temperatures have never risen above freezing from December 21 to January 26, inclusive; conversely, there has never been a freeze between May 23 and September 12 
==Economy==
Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the city&#x27;s economic focus has turned to border trade with China. The town is now home to a large Chinese expatriate community. Blagoveshchensk is part of a free-trade zone which includes the Chinese city of Heihe, located on the other side of the Amur River.

Main industries in the town include metal and timber processing, as well as paper production.

===Transportation===
The city is served by a branch highway and railway connecting it to Belogorsk on the Trans-Siberian Railway and Trans-Siberian Highway. It is also served by a river port. On the other side of the Amur River is Heihe, Heilongjiang Province, China, which is the starting point of China National Highway 202 that goes south to Harbin and Dalian. Ignatyevo Airport, located northwest of the city center, serves domestic destinations.

The Blagoveshchensk–Heihe Bridge, completed at the end of 2019, includes a 2-lane highway bridge over the Amur to link Blagoveshchensk and Heihe.

The world&#x27;s first international cable car to Heihe has also been proposed to open in 2022.

<text>The Eastern League of Minor League Baseball is A Double-A baseball league in the United States that began play in 1923. A league champion has determined at the end of each season. Champions have been determined by postseason playoffs, winning the regular season pennant, or being declared champion by the league office. For 2019, the league operated under a split season format in which the first place teams from each division in both the first and second halves of the season qualified for the playoffs. In the event that the same team won both halves, the team with the best win–loss record over the full season qualified. The first and second half winners then competed in a best-of-five series to determine division champions. The division winners then played each other in a best-of-five series to determine a league champion. As of 2022, the winners of each division from both the first and second halves of the season meet in a best-of-three division series, with the winners of the two division series meeting in a best-of-three championship series.

The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the league ceased operations before the 2021 season in conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) reorganization of Minor League Baseball. In place of the Eastern League, MLB created the Double-A Northeast, a 12-team circuit divided into two divisions. Prior to the 2022 season, MLB renamed the Double-A Northeast as the Eastern League, and it carried on the history of the league prior to reorganization. In 2021, the Double-A Northeast held a best-of-five series between the top two teams in the league, regardless of division standings, to determine a league champion.

<text>Remembering Saddam is a documentary by Don North, a television news producer.

The film follows the story of nine Iraqi businessmen who were arrested in 1995 by Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime which was notorious for human rights abuses. They were charged with dealing in foreign currency and imprisoned in Abu Ghraib prison. After a short trial with no defense representation, they were sentenced to amputation of their right hands. The amputation was videotaped and used by Saddam Hussein as a deterrent to other would-be criminals. An &quot;X of shame&quot; was also carved into the foreheads of each man by the surgeons.

After the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, North tracked down the nine men; seven of them (one was deceased) agreed to tell their stories. The documentary follows their story as organizations are lined up to donate surgical services, transportation and prosthetic limbs. Transportation was provided by Continental Airlines. Dr. Agris and Dr. Kestler of Houston donated their time. Medical facilities were provided by Methodist Hospital in Houston. The prosthetic hands which normally cost $50,000 each were donated by Otto Bock, a German-American company. The gruesome footage of their amputations performed by doctors in the employ of Saddam Hussein is presented in increments as the documentary unfolds. The &quot;Xs of shame&quot; on every man&#x27;s forehead were also removed.

, &quot;Remembering Saddam&quot; is not scheduled for broadcast because North has yet to find a network willing to broadcast it.

<doc id="665679" wikidata="Q6597630" url="?curid=665679" title="List of Southern League champions">
<text>The Southern League (SL) is a Minor League Baseball league that operates in the United States at the Double-A level, which is two grades below Major League Baseball. A champion has been determined at the end of each season since the league was formed in 1964. 

Through 1970, champions were the regular-season pennant winners—the team with the best win–loss record at the conclusion of the regular season. The 1971 title was decided in a postseason series between the two teams with the best records. From 1972 to 1975, the winners of each of two divisions competed in a series to determine champions. The league operated using a split season format from 1976 to 2020. Under this format, the winners of each half within each division played for the division championship, and the division winners met to play for the SL title. The 2021 winner was crowned via a series between the two teams with the best full-season records. As of 2022, the winners of each division from both the first and second halves of the season meet in a best-of-three division series, with the winners of the two division series meeting in a best-of-three championship series.

The Birmingham Barons have won eight Southern League championships, more than any other team, followed by the Jacksonville Suns (6) and Montgomery Rebels (5). Among active SL franchises, Birmingham has won seven championships, the most of all teams, followed by the Knoxville Smokies (4) and Chattanooga Lookouts (3).

==History==

The Southern League was founded in 1964. A league champion has been determined at the end of each season. Champions from 1964 to 1970 were simply the regular-season pennant winners—the team with the best win–loss record at the conclusion of the regular championship season. The first league champions were the Lynchburg White Sox, who won by one game over the Birmingham Barons in 1964.

In 1971, the league merged with the Texas League to form the Dixie Association, an interleague partnership in which they played an interlocking schedule, and the leagues&#x27; champions met to determine a Dixie Association champion. The Southern League championship was determined via a best-of-three playoff series between the top two teams in the league, based on winning percentage. The top-seeded Charlotte Hornets defeated the Asheville Tourists, 2–1. Charlotte then won the Dixie Association title over the Texas League champion Arkansas Travelers, in three-straight games. The partnership was dissolved after the season.

The Southern League divided its teams into two divisions in 1972. From 1972 to 1975, the winners of each division met in a best-of-five series to determine a champion. In 1976, the circuit adopted a split season format while maintaining its divisional alignment. Under this arrangement, the schedule was split into two parts. The team with the best record in each division at the end of the first half won the first-half division title. Standings were then reset so that all clubs had clean records to begin the second half. Second-half division titles were decided in the same manner. Then, the first and second-half winners in each division met to determine division champions. These winners played for the Southern League championship.

The first four-team playoff, held in 1976, was won by the Western Division champion Montgomery Rebels over the Eastern Division champion Orlando Twins, 3–1. The 1976 playoffs featured a one-game semifinal divisional round and a best-of-five championship series. Both rounds were the best-of-three in 1977 and 1978. The 1979 playoffs had a best-of-three divisional round and a best-of-five final. From 1980 to 2020, both rounds were the best-of-five. Initially, if one team won both halves, they received a bye into the championship round. Beginning in 1982, the team in that division with the second-place full-season record was awarded a wild card berth and became the division champion&#x27;s opponent. 

The 2020 season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Southern League ceased operations before the 2021 season in conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) reorganization of Minor League Baseball. In place of the league, MLB created the Double-A South. Prior to the 2022 season, MLB renamed the Double-A South the Southern League, and it carried on the history of the circuit prior to reorganization. In 2021, the Double-A South held a best-of-five series between the two teams with the best records, regardless of division standings, to determine a league champion. The top-seeded Mississippi Braves bested the Montgomery Biscuits, 3–2, for the title.

In 2022, the Southern League returned to the split-season divisional format it has used for the majority of its existence. The winners of each half in a division vie for the division championship. The second-place overall team is awarded a wild card berth in the event the same team wins both halves. The division champions then compete for the Southern League championship. Both rounds are the best-of-three games.

<text>La Neuveville (; ) is a municipality in the Jura bernois administrative district in the canton of Bern in Switzerland, located in the French-speaking Bernese Jura (&quot;Jura Bernois&quot;).

==History==

La Neuveville is first mentioned in 1314 as &quot;Nova-villa&quot;.

The oldest traces of settlements in the area include Bronze Age ceramics, Iron Age building ruins and Roman era artifacts which were discovered under the White Church. A pair of graves near the church indicate that a church has stood on the spot since the early Carolingian era. The church is mentioned in 866 when King Lothair II gave it to Moutier-Grandval Abbey. The church was rebuilt or expanded at least twelve times since it was first built. The church&#x27;s frescoes are from the 14th and 15th centuries.

In 999 the Abbot of Moutier-Grandval Abbey gave his extensive landholdings around Lake Biel, including where La Neuveville would be founded, to the Prince-Bishop of Basel. At that time the region was known as &quot;Nugerol&quot; and over the next centuries the Bishop of Basel and the Counts of Neuchâtel often quarreled over the land. In 1283-88 the Prince-Bishop Henry von Isny had the Schlossberg Castle built on the slopes of the Jura Mountains to help defend his claim to the land. To further solidify his claims, around 1310, the next Prince-Bishop, Gérard de Vuippens, founded the town of La Neuveville. The exact founding date is uncertain, but a citizen of the town is mentioned in 1310 while the town charter is from 1312. The town pushed the borders of the County of Neuchâtel to the eastern side of the Ruz de Vaux stream.

Under the Prince-Bishops, La Neuveville was the center of the &quot;Herrschaft&quot; of La Neuveville. The town had extensive autonomy. In 1367 fighting broke out between the Prince-Bishop Johann von Vienne and the city of Bern. The Prince-Bishop fled to Schlossberg Castle ahead of a Bernese army. Bern then besieged the town of La Neuveville and the castle. The citizens of La Neuveville rallied around the Prince-Bishop and drove the Bernese army away. In response, the Prince-Bishop granted the town additional rights and privileges in 1368. The town was granted the right to their own military banner and the right to call Tessenberg and Erguel to their banner. This granted the town a certain amount of military autonomy. Using their increased autonomy, in 1388 La Neuveville signed a citizenship agreement with Bern which granted citizens of La Neuveville the same rights as citizens of Bern. In 1395 they signed a similar pact with the city of Biel though they gave their banner-right over the Erguel region to Biel.

In 1529 and 1530 the French evangelist William Farel was active in spreading the new faith of the Protestant Reformation in La Neuveville. It remained a supporter of the new faith, despite being owned by the Catholic Prince-Bishops. In the 17th century it became an important stopping point for Huguenot refugees from France. The Catholic Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Assomption church was built in 1954 for the towns catholic population.

Despite the town&#x27;s growing autonomy, its relationship with the Prince-Bishops remained good until the late 17th century. Between 1711 and 1713 and again between 1714 and 1717 riots against the Prince-Bishop occurred regularly in town. The unrest against the Prince-Bishop Johann Konrad von Reinach eventually required Bern&#x27;s intervention to settle the uproar. After the 1798 French invasion, La Neuveville became part of the French Département of Mont-Terrible. Three years later, in 1800 it became part of the Département of Haut-Rhin. After Napoleon&#x27;s defeat and the Congress of Vienna, La Neuveville was assigned to the Canton of Bern in 1815. Under Bernese authority the town was initially part of the district of Erlach before becoming the capital of the District de la Neuveville.

The town had a Latin school beginning in the 17th century. In the 18th century a boarding school for foreign students opened. In the 19th century the watch industry settled in La Neuveville. Today about 36% of jobs in the town are still in the watch industry. The other major industry is caring for the of vineyards that grow on the sunny Jura slopes above town.

<text>Tooting Bec, originally Trinity Road (Tooting Bec), is a London Underground station in Tooting, South London. The station is on the Northern line, between Balham and stations. It is located on the junction of Trinity Road (heading north-west), Upper Tooting Road (south-west), Balham High Road (north-east), Tooting Bec Road (south-east) and Stapleton Road (also south-east). The station is in Travelcard Zone 3.

==History==

The station was designed by Charles Holden and opened on 13 September 1926 as part of the Morden extension of the City &amp; South London Railway, which is now part of the Northern line. Originally known as Trinity Road (Tooting Bec), it was given its present name on 1 October 1950.

The narrow satellite building on the east side of the junction provides pedestrian subway access to the station and is unusual in that it has a large glazed roundel on each of the three panels of its glazed screen, as normally the Morden extension stations have the roundel in just the centre panel. For many years the northern panel of the screen was the sole example on any of the Morden extension stations to retain the 1920s &quot;UD&quot; lettering, the other stations&#x27; screens having been replaced with plain glass over the years. All the stations have now had the original motif replaced along with the flag-pole-mounted roundels that had been removed in the 1950s.

On the platforms the station has two examples of clocks from the Self Winding Clock Company of New York City.

==Connections==

London Buses routes 155, 219, 249, 319 and 355 and night route N155 serve the station.

He was appointed to the Budget Responsibility Committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in December 2021. He took up that role in January 2022.
==Life==
Miles was born in 1959, and was educated at the Bishop Gore School in Swansea, University College, Oxford, Nuffield College, Oxford, and the London School of Economics.

In 2003 Miles produced a report for the British Chancellor of the Exchequer to examine why the long-term fixed rate mortgage market is not as popular a product in Britain as in other countries. His report states: &quot;A great many borrowers focus on the initial cost of debt and do not seem to consider carefully how those payments might change relative to their incomes&quot;. Much of Miles&#x27;s academic research has focused on housing, pensions, monetary policy, asset pricing and ways to make the financial system more stable.

From 2004 to 2009 Miles was Chief UK Economist of Morgan Stanley bank.

Miles predicted a substantial fall in real house prices in November 2006.

In 2009 he was asked, along with Gerald Holtham and Professor Berndt Spahn, to serve on a Commission established by the Welsh Assembly Government to investigate the scope for the Welsh Assembly to have greater fiscal autonomy. The Holtham Commission reported in July 2010.

From June 2009 to August 2015 Miles served on the Bank of England&#x27;s Monetary Policy Committee. In 2011 he published a detailed study of the appropriate balance sheet structure of banks to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis (&quot;Optimal Bank Capital&quot;). He concluded that the Basel III agreements on capital requirements for banks set the standard for equity at only about half its appropriate level. In 2012 he began a second term with the Monetary Policy Committee.

He was President of the economics section of the British Science Association (BSA) for 2015. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to monetary policy.

In 2016 he was appointed by Her Majesty&#x27;s Treasury to advise on the measurement and reporting of yields on UK government debt. His report was completed in October 2016 and is being implemented. 
He was Chair of the board of trustees of the Institute for Fiscal Studies until December 2021 when he took up his position at the OBR. He is a trustee of the Centre for Economic Policy Research.

<doc id="665707" wikidata="Q1248138" url="?curid=665707" title="Truth or Consequences">
<text>Truth or Consequences is an American game show originally hosted on NBC radio by Ralph Edwards (1940–57) and later on television by Edwards (1950–54), Jack Bailey (1954–56), Bob Barker (1956–75), Steve Dunne (1957–58), Bob Hilton (1977–78) and Larry Anderson (1987–88). The television show ran on CBS, NBC and also in syndication. The premise of the show was to mix the original quiz element of game shows with wacky stunts.

The daily syndicated show was produced by Ralph Edwards Productions (later Ralph Edwards/Stu Billett Productions), in association with and distributed by Metromedia Producers Corporation (1966–78) and Lorimar-Telepictures (1987–88). Current rights are owned by Ralph Edwards Productions.

==Game play==

On the show, contestants received roughly two seconds to answer a trivia question correctly (usually an off-the-wall question that no one would be able to answer correctly, or a bad joke) before &quot;Beulah the Buzzer&quot; sounded. On the rare occasions that a contestant did answer correctly, the host would reveal that the question had multiple parts. Failing to complete this &quot;truth&quot; portion meant that the contestant had to face &quot;consequences&quot;, typically by performing a zany and embarrassing stunt. Contestants&#x27; involvement in these stunts and the audience&#x27;s reaction led Edwards to state about himself and his producers, &quot;Aren&#x27;t we devils?&quot; From the start, most contestants preferred to answer the question wrong to perform the stunt. Edwards said, &quot;Most of the American people are darned good sports.&quot;

A popular segment on many episodes was an emotional surprise for a contestant, such as being reunited with a long-lost relative or with an enlisted son or daughter returning from military duty overseas, particularly Vietnam. Sometimes, if a military member was based in California, his spouse or parents were flown in for a reunion.

During Barker&#x27;s run as host, a side game, &quot;Barker&#x27;s Box&quot;, was played at the end of the show. Barker&#x27;s Box had four drawers; three contained money, while a pop-up &quot;surprise&quot; was in the fourth. The contestant chose one drawer at a time and won the money in each. The game ended if the contestant found the surprise, while avoiding it awarded a bonus prize.

Barker traditionally ended each episode with the phrase, &quot;Hoping all your consequences are happy ones.&quot; In one 1994 episode of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, he started to deliver that closing, but caught his mistake and covered it by saying &quot;hoping all your...prices are right!&quot;, instead of the familiar &quot;Have your pets spayed or neutered&quot; line he was best known for using at the time.

==Broadcast history==

Ralph Edwards stated he got the idea for a new radio program from a favorite childhood parlor game, &quot;Forfeits&quot;. The show premiered on NBC Radio on March 23, 1940.

&quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; was the first game show to air on broadcast television, airing as a one-time experiment on the first day of New York station WNBT&#x27;s commercial program schedule on July 1, 1941. However, the series did not appear on TV again until 1950, when the medium had caught on commercially. On September 6, 1950, WCBS-TV in New York City began local broadcasts of kinescopes of episodes that had been broadcast on KTTV in Los Angeles. Phillip Morris sponsored the series in New York.

The program originated as a prime time series, airing on CBS from September 7, 1950, to May 31, 1951, hosted by Edwards. Three years later, it returned on NBC with Jack Bailey (of &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;) as host, this time running from May 18, 1954, to September 28, 1956. NBC launched a new daytime version on December 31 of that year, with radio personality Bob Barker at the helm. This run not only marked the start of a hugely successful television career for Barker, but also became the longest-running incarnation of &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; yet, airing until September 24, 1965. During Barker&#x27;s run, another prime time version was attempted, this one with actor Steve Dunne emceeing, which ran on NBC from December 13, 1957, to June 6, 1958.

Edwards pioneered several technologies for recording live television programs. When &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; established a permanent presence on TV in 1950, Edwards arranged to have it be recorded on 35mm film, using multiple cameras simultaneously—the first TV program recorded before a live audience to do so. A similar process was then adapted by Desilu for &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; the following year. On January 22, 1957, the show, which was produced in Hollywood, became the first program to be broadcast in all time zones from a prerecorded videotape. This technology had previously been used only for time-delayed broadcasts to the West Coast.

In 1966, &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; became the first successful daily game show in first-run syndication (as opposed to reruns) to not air on a network, having ended its NBC run one year earlier. This version continued through 1975.

In the fall of 1977, a syndicated revival titled &quot;The New Truth or Consequences&quot; premiered. Because Bob Barker had already agreed to take over &quot;The Nighttime Price Is Right&quot; from Dennis James, he was unavailable and Bob Hilton took over hosting. However, this version did not click in the ratings and was cancelled after a single season.

A decade later, &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; returned in syndication for the 1987–1988 season, this time with actor Larry Anderson as host, assisted by Murray Langston (better known as &quot;The Unknown Comic&quot; on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;). This effort also failed to attract audiences and was gone after one season.

==Episode status==
According to the Inter-Office Memorandum published by Pat Gleason on June 25, 1987, the status of believed existing episodes breaks down as follows:

*37½ episodes of the 1950–1951 CBS primetime version
*95 episodes of the 1954–1956 NBC primetime version
*74 episodes of the 1956–1965 NBC daytime version
*no episodes of the 1957–1958 NBC primetime version
*at least 1,700 episodes of the 1966–1975 syndicated version
*all episodes of the 1977–1978 syndicated version
The show has been rarely broadcast outside of its initial presentations.

A previously unseen, unsold pilot pitched to Fox, produced around 2003 or 2004, was uploaded by veteran game show host Wink Martindale on his YouTube page. The pilot was hosted by sports journalist Chris Rose. In 2023, Martindale uploaded the pilot of the 1977–1978 version.

==&quot;Jimmy&quot; episode==
On May 22, 1948, &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; broadcast live from the newly founded Dana–Farber Cancer Institute, and surprised 12-year-old cancer patient Einar Gustafson by having members of the Boston Braves visit the boy in his room. Gustafson was referred to only as &quot;Jimmy&quot; to protect his identity. (Not only did Gustafson&#x27;s cancer go into remission, but the Braves won the National League pennant, their last before moving to Milwaukee in 1953.) The broadcast launched The Jimmy Fund and its long-standing relationship with the Boston Red Sox as their official charity beginning in 1953. (After many years in seclusion—leading to speculation that &quot;Jimmy&quot; had died—Gustafson re-emerged in the 1990s and was made honorary chairman of the Jimmy Fund in 1998. He died in 2001, aged 65.)

== International versions ==
A British version, called &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, not to be confused with the BBC panel show also called &quot;Would I Lie to You?&quot;, was broadcast on ITV from August 1998 until 1999. Hosted by Steve Penk, the show was originally piloted under the &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; name in 1998. It was axed after only one series of nine episodes.

<text>Thomas Cavanagh (born October 26, 1963) is a Canadian actor. He is known for a variety of roles on American television, including starring roles in &quot;Ed&quot; (2000–2004), &quot;Love Monkey&quot; (2006) and &quot;Trust Me&quot; (2009), and recurring roles on &quot;Providence&quot; and &quot;Scrubs&quot;. From 2014 to 2023, he portrayed Harrison Wells and Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash on The CW television series &quot;The Flash&quot;; Cavanagh also directed several episodes of &quot;The Flash&quot;. In 2023, he became the host of &quot;Hey Yahoo!&quot; on GSN.

==Early life==
Thomas Cavanagh was born on October 26, 1963, in Ottawa, Ontario, to a Roman Catholic family of Irish descent. Cavanagh moved with his family to Winneba, a small city in Ghana when he was a child.

In his teens, the family moved to Lennoxville, Quebec when his father became the Academic Dean of Champlain College. He attended the Séminaire de Sherbrooke, where he studied in French and played basketball for the Barons. He later studied at Champlain College in Lennoxville at the CEGEP level. While attending Queen&#x27;s University, Kingston, Ontario, he became interested in theatre and music and played ice hockey and varsity basketball. He graduated in 1987 with degrees in English, biology and education.

==Career==

===Commercial credits===
Cavanagh acted in his native Canada for many years, appearing on television dramas such as &quot;Jake and the Kid&quot; in the late 1990s, and television commercials, appearing for Oh Henry! chocolate bars and Labatt Blue Light beer commercials in the 1990s and for CIBC.

===Broadway roles===
In 1989, he was cast in the Broadway revival of &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. Other stage credits include productions of &quot;A Chorus Line&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;, &quot;Urinetown&quot; and &quot;Grease&quot;. He appeared in the 2008 production of &quot;Some Americans Abroad&quot; at Second Stage Theatre in New York City.

===Television performances===
After gaining notice for his recurring role as Doug the Dog Guy in the NBC television program &quot;Providence&quot;, Cavanagh was cast as the title character in the NBC program &quot;Ed&quot;. Cavanagh received a Golden Globe nomination and a TV Guide Award for his work on &quot;Ed&quot;, which ran for four seasons beginning in October 2000 and concluding in February 2004.

Cavanagh guest starred on the sitcom &quot;Scrubs&quot; where he played Dan Dorian, the brother of Zach Braff&#x27;s character. He made six subsequent appearances in the series, starting with 2002&#x27;s &quot;My Big Brother&quot; and culminating with the eighth season finale.

In 2005, Cavanagh filmed the pilot &quot;Love Monkey&quot;, with Jason Priestley, Judy Greer and Larenz Tate. The show was selected by CBS as a midseason replacement and debuted on January 17, 2006. &quot;Love Monkey&quot; was given an eight-episode order, but only three aired on CBS before the show was placed on indefinite hiatus due to low ratings. VH1 bought all eight episodes which was played in the entirety in the spring of 2006.

He starred in the Lifetime Movie Network television miniseries &quot;The Capture Of The Green River Killer&quot; in which he portrayed King County sheriff David Reichert. In March 2006, Cavanagh filmed &quot;My Ex-Life&quot;, a comedy pilot for CBS about a divorced couple who remain friends. The pilot featured &quot;Lost&quot; actress Cynthia Watros as his character&#x27;s ex-wife. CBS did not select the show for its fall 2006 schedule. Cavanagh portrayed the lead role Nick Snowden (the heir to the Santa Claus identity) in the made-for-TV movie &quot;Snow&quot; in 2005, which is shown annually on the Family Channel.

In 2008, Cavanagh appeared in the short-lived ABC series &quot;Eli Stone&quot;, playing the father of the title character. From January to April 2009, Cavanagh starred in the television drama &quot;Trust Me&quot;, co-starring Eric McCormack, which aired on TNT until cancellation due to low ratings.

Cavanagh hosted &quot;Stories from the Vaults&quot; on Smithsonian Networks from 2008 to 2009. He made a guest appearance in the mid-season premiere of the USA Network show &quot;Royal Pains&quot; as former professional golfer Jack O&#x27;Malley. In 2012, he starred in Lifetime&#x27;s &quot;A Killer Among Us&quot; remake.

From 2014 to 2021, Cavanagh was a series regular on The CW&#x27;s live-action television series &quot;The Flash&quot;, portraying Harrison Wells; most notably Eobard Thawne / Reverse-Flash impersonating the Earth-1 version in conjunction with several different doppelgängers, such as Earth-2&#x27;s Harry, Earth-19 writer H. R., Earth-221 detective Sherloque, and explorer Nash (also known as Pariah). He was a regular cast member for seven seasons, and made guest appearances in the final two seasons. In 2023, Cavanagh began hosting the game show &quot;Hey Yahoo!&quot;.

===Film performances===
Cavanagh starred in the 2002 film &quot;Bang Bang You&#x27;re Dead&quot;. Prior to &quot;Ed&quot;, Cavanagh&#x27;s film appearances were mainly in supporting roles. After that series ended, he had his first starring role as an escaped convict in the thriller &quot;Heart of the Storm&quot;. In 2005, he starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Alchemy&quot;, opposite Sarah Chalke; in 2006, he appeared in another romantic comedy, &quot;Gray Matters&quot;.

In 2006, Cavanagh began filming &quot;Breakfast with Scot&quot;, in which he plays a gay retired hockey player who becomes an adoptive father to a young boy. The film, released in 2007, drew attention as the first gay-themed film ever to win approval from a major league sports franchise to use its real name and logo; Cavanagh&#x27;s character formerly played for the Toronto Maple Leafs. In 2007 he starred in the second installment of the direct-to-DVD &quot;Raw Feed&quot; horror film series from Warner Home Video, &quot;Sublime&quot;. In 2008, Cavanagh starred in the Crime/Drama &quot; The Capture of the Green River Killer&quot;. He also starred as Ranger Smith in the feature film &quot;Yogi Bear&quot; (2010).

===Podcast===
From 2010 until 2016, Cavanagh co-hosted the podcast &quot;Mike and Tom Eat Snacks&quot;, with his &quot;Ed&quot; castmate Michael Ian Black, on the Nerdist Podcast Network. They re-launched the podcast in August, 2021 on the Starburns Audio podcast network.

==Personal life==
Cavanagh married Maureen Grise, an image editor for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, on July 31, 2004, in a Catholic ceremony on Nantucket, Massachusetts. The couple has two daughters and two sons.

Cavanagh ran the 2006 New York City Marathon.

In summer 2008, he founded the Cavanagh Classic, an annual celebrity basketball tournament in Rucker Park in Harlem to raise money and awareness for Nothing But Nets. The charity&#x27;s goal is to combat malaria by sending mosquito nets to families that need them. Cavanagh travelled to Rwanda on a March 2009 United Nations Foundation trip to distribute the nets and educate the recipients in their use.

<text>In the platonia dilemma introduced in Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s book &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot;, an eccentric trillionaire gathers 20 people together, and tells them that if one and only one of them sends them a telegram (reverse charges) by noon the next day, that person will receive a billion dollars. If they receive more than one telegram, or none at all, no one will get any money, and cooperation between players is forbidden. In this situation, the superrational thing to do is to send a telegram with probability 1/20.

==Luring Lottery==
A similar game, referred to as a &quot;Luring Lottery&quot;, was actually played by the editors of &quot;Scientific American&quot; in the 1980s. To enter the contest once, readers had to send in a postcard with the number &quot;1&quot; written on it. They were also explicitly permitted to submit as many entries as they wished by sending in a single postcard bearing the number of entries they wished to submit. The prize was one million dollars divided by the total number of entries received, to be awarded to the submitter of a randomly chosen entry. Thus a reader who submitted a large number of entries increased their chances of winning but reduced the maximum possible value of the prize. It can be shown mathematically that one maximizes one&#x27;s average winnings in this game by submitting a number of entries equal to the total number of entries of others. Of course, if others take this into account, then this strategy translates into a runaway reaction to unbounded number of entries being submitted.

According to the magazine, the superrational thing was for each contestant to roll a simulated die with the number of sides equal to the number of expected responders (about 5% of the readership), and then send &quot;1&quot; if you roll &quot;1&quot;. If all contestants had followed this strategy, it is possible that the magazine would have received a single postcard, with a &quot;1&quot;, and would have had to pay a million dollars to the sender of that postcard. Reputedly the publisher and owners were very concerned about betting the company on a game.

Although the magazine had previously discussed the concept of superrationality from which the above-mentioned algorithm can be deduced, many of the contestants submitted entries consisting of an astronomically large number (including several who entered a googolplex). Some took this game further by filling their postcards with mathematical expressions designed to evaluate to the largest possible number in the limited space allowed. As a result, the contestants caused the prize to become moot (as it would have been a minuscule fraction of a cent) and the magazine was unable to tell who won the prize.

<text>Griselinia littoralis, commonly known as kapuka, New Zealand broadleaf or pāpāuma, is a fast-growing small to medium-sized evergreen tree that is native to New Zealand.

== Description ==

&quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is a hardy evergreen shrub that grows up to about 10 metres tall. &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is round in shape and has dense foliage. The leaves are alternate, leathery, glossy yellow-green above, paler and matte below, long, oval with a smooth margin. This tree also has flowers and berries that grow in particular seasons annually.

In general, this tree can grow up to 10 m or longer to 15 m tall. It has rough and short branches which can stretch to 150 cm in diameter. The shape of apical leaf is broad-ovate to ovate-oblong or rounded with smooth margin. The yellow-green leaf is thick and its width can be 5–12 cm long by 4–5 cm wide, the leaf often be glossy and grow as alternative type, one side can be a little longer than the other side at base sometimes, this is one of the typical characters. The greenish flowers are borne on the slim twigs and they are quite small, they always grow up from late spring to mid-summer. The panicles are also small. Five petals are owned by the pistillate flowers. The dark purple or black berries can be 6–7 mm long and appear in mid-summer, ripening from autumn to winter.

== Natural global range ==

&quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is native to New Zealand, but has also become located in other areas of the world. It is widely cultivated both in New Zealand and in other areas with mild oceanic climates such as the south coast of Great Britain and the Faroe Islands, where it is valued for its tolerance of salt carried on sea gales.

The Latin specific epithet &quot;littoralis&quot; means &#x27;growing by the sea&#x27;, and in its native New Zealand it is to be found in large numbers in coastal areas. It is frequently grown as a screen to resist wind or other extreme situations.

== New Zealand range ==

&quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is found throughout New Zealand from sea level up to 900 m altitude and ranges from far north to Stewart Island geographically. It is most commonly found in coastal areas as it is a hardy plant. This plant is a native plant in New Zealand. It can be found everywhere in New Zealand from lowland to high hills or forest or shrub land. It can be found in larger quantities in the South Island than the North Island. In the North Island, it always grows at higher altitude than the South Island.

== Habitat ==

&quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is native to New Zealand and is found throughout the country particularly in coastal exposed areas, as it is a hardy plant that tolerates sea breeze and wind exposure. &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; can survive a range of habitats and external conditions but prefers the following particular conditions and habitat.

&quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; prefers free draining soil as in light loamy type. This species tolerates temperatures down to about and warm temperatures up to . &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; requires full sun or semi-shaded areas to thrive and will survive on very little nutrient like most native New Zealand plants, but will thrive in areas with the availability of higher nutrient levels. It favors high rainfall areas for good growth.

This plant can grow at a lot of growing environments. In moist climates this plant might be an epiphyte with roots deep to the ground to absorb the water and nutrients.

== Life cycle ==

The flowering time of &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is in spring when small greenish yellow flowers appear. The flowers are borne on long panicles, each panicle with 50-100 individual flowers, each flower 3–4 mm across, with five sepals and stamens but no petals. Following flowering, small blackish berries are formed, as long as male and female &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; are located in the same area so pollination can occur. Birds are a vector in spreading the seeds around the area, minimizing competition within the same species for water, sunlight and nutrients. Also allowing the &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; to establish in new areas. Germination of the seeds occur when the seeds drop to the ground and reproduction occurs. This plant has a long life span generally over fifty years.

There are three phases of the forest growth cycle: the gap phase, the building phase, and the mature phase. It is easier to tell from these three phases. The diameter grow faster during the gap and building phase (0.31 cm per year) that the leaves become bigger and bigger to absorb the sunlight to do photosynthesis than mature phase (just 0.19 cm per year). Broadleaf grow very quickly in building phase than other phases.

The gap phase is the period when the colonization forming by the canopy opening. The building phase is the period when the seeding attain canopy status. The mature phase is the period when the canopy keep intact. The average height of this plant is 15 cm per year (range 10–18 cm).

The flowers are borne on the slim twigs and they are very small, the color is green, they always appear from late spring to mid-summer. Greenish flowers have two type: male flowers and female flowers. They grow up at different trees. The wind and insects are good media to transfer the pollen from one flower to another flower.

Fruits keep green until they get ready to become mature and fall down from the tree to the ground. The dark purple or black berries can be 6–7 mm long and appearing in mid-summer and ripening from autumn to winter.

== Predation ==

&quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is susceptible to grazing herbivores and predators such as goat, deer, possums and insects. These predators graze on the leaves of this species however &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is generally a healthy and dense shrub that withstands foraging adequately.

== Other information ==

&quot;Griselina littoralis&quot; bark was traditionally used by Māori as medicine to treat skin infections before modern medicine became available. The name &quot;littoralis&quot; of this broadleaf species means &quot;growing by the sea&quot;. &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; is commonly used as a hedge or screen as it is a hardy shrub that can be clipped back easily and looks good all year round with minimal maintenance. This plant is a good coastal hedge resisting winds, especially in harsh coastal environment.

In cultivation in the UK, &quot;Griselinia littoralis&quot; and the cultivar &#x27;Variegata&#x27; have won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>An expansion draft, in professional sports, occurs when a sports league decides to create one or more new expansion teams or franchises. This occurs mainly in North American sports and closed leagues. One of the ways of stocking the new team or teams is an expansion draft. Although how each league conducts them varies, and they vary from occasion to occasion, the system is usually something similar to the following:

Each existing team is told it can &quot;protect&quot; a certain number of its existing contracted players by furnishing their names to the league office on or before a certain date. The expansion team(s) then are allowed to select players not on the protected lists in a manner somewhat similar to an entry draft. There are generally a maximum number of players that can be selected from any one team, at least without the team losing the player receiving something in compensation such as a future entry draft pick.

Teams subject to losing players usually tend to put most if not all of the players they truly need to stay competitive on the protected list. This means that the expansion franchise is often left to choose among players who are old, injury prone, failing to develop as the teams had intended, or perhaps so highly compensated that a team wishes to remove them from the payroll. For this reason, expansion teams are often noncompetitive in their early years in a league, although the advent of the free agent system has modified this somewhat. Marc-André Fleury, who won three Stanley Cups with the Pittsburgh Penguins, is a notable exception of a star player in their prime being left exposed in an expansion draft, being made available for the Vegas Golden Knights in the 2017 NHL expansion draft after Fleury was made expendable due to the rise of Matt Murray at goaltender. The rules of the draft can be tweaked by the league to make the expansion team more competitive if that is the business objective of the league&#x27;s expansion.

Most teams seem to try largely to make a team which will serve until it can begin to develop its own talent, although occasionally players discarded by their old teams benefit from the change in environment and become stars, either again or for the first time.

A similar process occurs when an existing franchise is disbanded and the players contracted to it become available to the remaining teams; this process is referred to as a dispersal draft.

==Expansion drafts==
===American football===
During its history, the NFL has held eight expansion drafts in order to accommodate newcoming teams. Half of them took place in 1960s, when the league was expanding quickly, facing the competition from AFL. The last was held in 2002, as the league reached its current state of 32 teams.

The first NFL expansion draft took place in 1960 to let the just-enfranchised Dallas Cowboys pick their initial players. Because the new franchise approval happened too late, this was the only time in NFL history that a new franchise could not participate in the normal league draft and thus missed on college players. Already in the next season, NFL added a 14th team to its roster, the Minnesota Vikings. In the ensuing expansion draft, the new team picked three players from each of the other franchises (except the still very new Cowboys). Together with the participation in the normal draft, this gave the Vikings enough strength to score three victories in their first season.

Later in 1960s, NFL added two more franchises. In 1966, an expansion draft was held for the new Atlanta Falcons, one year later another expansion draft happened for the 16th team of the league, New Orleans Saints. Like in previous drafts, new franchise could take three players from each of the existing teams (the still-new Falcons were exempt from giving up players to the Saints). However, existing teams were allowed to exclude large parts of their roster from the draft, to avoid losing their most valuable players.

During its ten-year existence, the American Football League had two expansion drafts, one in 1966 for the Miami Dolphins and one in season for the Cincinnati Bengals.

As of AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the league consisted of 26 teams. The merger itself didn&#x27;t require expansion drafts, as AFL teams were already well-established and of comparable strength. So, the next expansion draft happened in 1976, when two new teams joined the NFL: the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The last three expansion drafts took place between 1995 and 2002. In 1995, two new teams, the Carolina Panthers and the Jacksonville Jaguars were allowed to pick between 30 and 42 players each from existing teams&#x27; rosters. 1999 NFL expansion draft was held for the Cleveland Browns, the 31st team in the league. This one in particular was regarded as giving the new team too little, while letting existing teams to protect basically all players they wanted. Finally, as the Houston Texans joined the league in 2002 as the 32nd and, currently, the last team, 2002 NFL expansion draft was held for them. The rules of the draft had been adjusted following the reception of the 1999 one.

<text>The Lütschine () is a river in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. The Lütschine proper runs from Zweilütschinen, where its two tribututaries join, to Lake Brienz at Bönigen. The Schwarze Lütschine, or Black Lütschine, flows from Grindelwald to Zweilütschinen. The Weisse Lütschine, or White Lütschine, flows from the Lauterbrunnen Valley to Zweilütschinen. The common stretch of the river has a length of , whilst the Schwarze Lütschine is long and the Weisse Lütschine is long.

Both branches of the Lütschine include a large number of mountain streams as tributaries. A notable tributary of the Schwarze Lütschine, emerging from the gorge of the Lower Grindelwald Glacier, is confusingly referred to as &quot;Weisse Lütschine&quot;. The highest point of the drainage basin is the Jungfrau.

A story passed on by word of mouth showing friendly banter between villagers that lived on the two rivers is that the people on the Weisse Lütschine said the others &quot;were so dirty it turned the river black&quot; and the villagers on the Schwarze Lütschine claimed the others &quot;never even washed so the other tributary remained perfectly white&quot;.

A modern observer standing at Zweilütschinen in winter might note that during the day the Schwarze Lütschine valley to the east is dark, shaded and cold, whereas the south facing Weisse Lütschine valley to the south (the Lauterbrunnen Valley) is sunny and light.

From Wilderswil to Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, the banks of the Lütschine are closely followed by the tracks of the Berner Oberland Railway.

<text>Hugo Marie de Vries (; 16 February 1848 – 21 May 1935) was a Dutch botanist and one of the first geneticists. He is known chiefly for suggesting the concept of genes, rediscovering the laws of heredity in the 1890s while apparently unaware of Gregor Mendel&#x27;s work, for introducing the term &quot;mutation&quot;, and for developing a mutation theory of evolution.

==Early life==
De Vries was born in 1848, the eldest son of Gerrit de Vries (1818–1900), a lawyer and deacon in the Mennonite congregation in Haarlem and later Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1872 until 1874, and Maria Everardina Reuvens (1823–1914), daughter of a professor in archaeology at Leiden University. His father became a member of the Dutch Council of State in 1862 and moved his family over to The Hague. From an early age Hugo showed much interest in botany, winning several prizes for his herbariums while attending gymnasium in Haarlem and The Hague.

In 1866 he enrolled at the Leiden University to major in botany. He enthusiastically took part in W.F.R. Suringar&#x27;s classes and excursions, but was mostly drawn to the experimental botany outlined in Julius von Sachs&#x27; &#x27;Lehrbuch der Botanik&#x27; from 1868. He was also deeply impressed by Charles Darwin&#x27;s evolution theory, despite Suringar&#x27;s skepticism. He wrote a dissertation on the effect of heat on plant roots, including several statements by Darwin to provoke his professor, and graduated in 1870.

==Early career==
After a short period of teaching, de Vries left in September 1870 to take classes in chemistry and physics at the Heidelberg University and work in the laboratory of Wilhelm Hofmeister. In the second semester of that school year he joined the lab of the esteemed Julius Sachs in Würzburg to study plant growth. From September 1871 until 1875 he taught botany, zoology, and geology at schools in Amsterdam. During each vacation he returned to the lab in Heidelberg to continue his research.

In 1875, the Prussian Ministry of Agriculture offered de Vries a position as professor at the still to be constructed &quot;Landwirtschaftliche Hochschule&quot; (&quot;Royal Agricultural College&quot;) in Berlin. In anticipation, he moved back to Würzburg, where he studied agricultural crops and collaborated with Sachs. By 1877, Berlin&#x27;s College was still only a plan, and he briefly took up a position teaching at the University of Halle-Wittenberg. The same year he was offered a position as lecturer in plant physiology at the newly founded University of Amsterdam. He was made adjunct professor in 1878 and full professor on his birthday in 1881, partly to keep him from moving to the Berlin College, which finally opened that year.
De Vries was also professor and director of Amsterdam&#x27;s Botanical Institute and Garden from 1885 to 1918.

==Definition of the gene==
In 1889, de Vries published his book &quot;Intracellular Pangenesis&quot;, in which, based on a modified version of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of Pangenesis of 1868, he postulated that different characters have different hereditary carriers. He specifically postulated that inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles. He called these units &quot;pangenes&quot;, a term 20 years later to be shortened to genes by Wilhelm Johannsen.

==Rediscovery of genetics==
To support his theory of pangenes, which was not widely noticed at the time, de Vries conducted a series of experiments hybridising varieties of multiple plant species in the 1890s. Unaware of Mendel&#x27;s work, de Vries used the laws of dominance and recessiveness, segregation, and independent assortment to explain the 3:1 ratio of phenotypes in the second generation. His observations also confirmed his hypothesis that inheritance of specific traits in organisms comes in particles.

He further speculated that genes could cross the species barrier, with the same gene being responsible for hairiness in two different species of flower. Although generally true in a sense (orthologous genes, inherited from a common ancestor of both species, tend to stay responsible for similar phenotypes), de Vries meant a physical cross between species. This actually also happens, though very rarely in higher organisms (see horizontal gene transfer). De Vries&#x27; work on genetics inspired the research of Jantina Tammes, who worked with him for a period in 1898.

In the late 1890s, de Vries became aware of Mendel&#x27;s obscure paper of thirty years earlier and he altered some of his terminology to match. When he published the results of his experiments in the French journal &quot;Comptes rendus de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot; in 1900, he neglected to mention Mendel&#x27;s work, but after criticism by Carl Correns he conceded Mendel&#x27;s priority.

Correns and Erich von Tschermak now share credit for the rediscovery of Mendel&#x27;s laws. Correns was a student of Nägeli, a renowned botanist with whom Mendel corresponded about his work with peas but who failed to understand its significance, while, coincidentally, Tschermak&#x27;s grandfather taught Mendel botany during his student days in Vienna.

==Mutation theory==
In his own time, de Vries was best known for his mutation theory. In 1886, he had discovered new forms among a group of &quot;Oenothera lamarckiana&quot;, a species of evening primrose, growing wild in an abandoned potato field near Hilversum, having escaped a nearby garden. Taking seeds from these, he found that they produced many new varieties in his experimental gardens; he introduced the term mutations for these suddenly appearing variations. In his two-volume publication &quot;The Mutation Theory&quot; (1900–1903) he postulated that evolution, especially the origin of species, might occur more frequently with such large-scale changes than via Darwinian gradualism, basically suggesting a form of saltationism. De Vries&#x27;s theory was one of the chief contenders for the explanation of how evolution worked, leading, for example, Thomas Hunt Morgan to study mutations in the fruit fly, until the modern evolutionary synthesis became the dominant model in the 1930s. During the early decades of the twentieth century, de Vries&#x27; theory was enormously influential and continued to fascinate non-biologists long after the scientific community had abandoned much of it (while retaining the idea of mutations as a crucial source of natural variation). The large-scale primrose variations turned out to be the result of various chromosomal abnormalities, including ring chromosomes, balanced lethals and chromosome duplications (polyploidy), while the term mutation now generally is restricted to discrete changes in the DNA sequence. However, the popular understanding of &quot;mutation&quot; as a sudden leap to a new species has remained a staple theme of science fiction, e.g. the X-Men movies (and the comic books that preceded them).

In a published lecture of 1903 (&quot;Befruchtung und Bastardierung&quot;, Veit, Leipzig), De Vries was also the first to suggest the occurrence of recombinations between homologous chromosomes, now known as chromosomal crossovers, within a year after chromosomes were implicated in Mendelian inheritance by Walter Sutton.

Botanist Daniel Trembly MacDougal attended his lectures in United States on Mutation Theory. In 1905 he helped published these lectures into a book &quot;Species and Varieties: Their Origin by Mutation.&quot;

==Honors and retirement==

In 1878 de Vries became member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1903 and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1904. In May 1905, de Vries was elected Foreign Member of the Royal Society. In 1910, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1921, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was awarded the Darwin Medal in 1906 and the Linnean Medal in 1929.

He retired in 1918 from the University of Amsterdam and withdrew to his estate De Boeckhorst in Lunteren where he had large experimental gardens. He continued his studies with new forms until his death in 1935.

<doc id="665728" wikidata="Q898455" url="?curid=665728" title="Shape-memory alloy">
<text>In metallurgy, a shape-memory alloy (SMA) is an alloy that can be deformed when cold but returns to its pre-deformed (&quot;remembered&quot;) shape when heated. It is also known in other names such as memory metal, memory alloy, smart metal, smart alloy, and muscle wire. The &quot;memorized geometry&quot; can be modified by fixating the desired geometry and subjecting it to a thermal treatment, for example a wire can be taught to memorize the shape of a coil spring.

Parts made of shape-memory alloys can be lightweight, solid-state alternatives to conventional actuators such as hydraulic, pneumatic, and motor-based systems. They can also be used to make hermetic joints in metal tubing, and it can also replace a sensor-actuator closed loop to control water temperature by governing hot and cold water flow ratio.

== Overview ==
The two most prevalent shape-memory alloys are copper-aluminium-nickel and nickel-titanium (NiTi), but SMAs can also be created by alloying zinc, copper, gold and iron.
Although iron-based and copper-based SMAs, such as Fe-Mn-Si, Cu-Zn-Al and Cu-Al-Ni, are commercially available and cheaper than NiTi, NiTi-based SMAs are preferable for most applications due to their stability and practicability as well as their superior thermo-mechanical performance. SMAs can exist in two different phases, with three different crystal structures (i.e. twinned martensite, detwinned martensite, and austenite) and six possible transformations. The thermo-mechanic behavior of the SMAs is governed by a phase transformation between the austenite and the martensite.

NiTi alloys change from austenite to martensite upon cooling starting from a temperature below &quot;Ms&quot;; &quot;Mf&quot; is the temperature at which the transition to martensite completes upon cooling. Accordingly, during heating &quot;As&quot; and &quot;Af&quot; are the temperatures at which the transformation from martensite to austenite starts and finishes. 

Applying a mechanical load to the martensite leads to a re-orientation of the crystals, referred to as “de-twinning”, which results in a deformation which is not recovered (remembered) after releasing the mechanical load. De-twinning starts at a certain stress &quot;σs&quot; and ends at &quot;σf&quot; above which martensite continue exhibiting only elastic behavior (as long as the load is below the yield stress). The memorized deformation from detwinning is recovered after heating to austenite.

The phase transformation from austenite to martensite can also occur at constant temperature by applying a mechanical load above a certain level. The transformation is reversed when the load is released.

The transition from the martensite phase to the austenite phase is only dependent on temperature and stress, not time, as most phase changes are, as there is no diffusion involved. Similarly, the austenite structure receives its name from steel alloys of a similar structure. It is the reversible diffusionless transition between these two phases that results in special properties. While martensite can be formed from austenite by rapidly cooling carbon-steel, this process is not reversible, so steel does not have shape-memory properties.

In this figure the vertical axis represents the martensite fraction. The difference between the heating transition and the cooling transition gives rise to hysteresis where some of the mechanical energy is lost in the process. The shape of the curve depends on the material properties of the shape-memory alloy, such as the alloy&#x27;s composition and work hardening.

==Shape memory effect==

The shape memory effect (SME) occurs because a temperature-induced phase transformation reverses deformation, as shown in the previous hysteresis curve. Typically the martensitic phase is monoclinic or orthorhombic (B19&#x27; or B19). Since these crystal structures do not have enough slip systems for easy dislocation motion, they deform by twinning—or rather, detwinning.

Martensite is thermodynamically favored at lower temperatures, while austenite (B2 cubic) is thermodynamically favored at higher temperatures. Since these structures have different lattice sizes and symmetry, cooling austenite into martensite introduces internal strain energy in the martensitic phase. To reduce this energy, the martensitic phase forms many twins—this is called &quot;self-accommodating twinning&quot; and is the twinning version of geometrically necessary dislocations. Since the shape memory alloy will be manufactured from a higher temperature and is usually engineered so that the martensitic phase is dominant at operating temperature to take advantage of the shape memory effect, SMAs &quot;start&quot; highly twinned.

When the martensite is loaded, these self-accommodating twins provide an easy path for deformation. Applied stresses will detwin the martensite, but all of the atoms stay in the same position relative to the nearby atoms—no atomic bonds are broken or reformed (as they would be by dislocation motion). Thus, when the temperature is raised and austenite becomes thermodynamically favored, all of the atoms rearrange to the B2 structure which happens to be the same macroscopic shape as the B19&#x27; pre-deformation shape. This phase transformation happens extremely quickly and gives SMAs their distinctive &quot;snap&quot;.

Repeated use of the shape-memory effect may lead to a shift of the characteristic transformation temperatures (this effect is known as functional fatigue, as it is closely related with a change of microstructural and functional properties of the material). The maximum temperature at which SMAs can no longer be stress induced is called &quot;Md&quot;, where the SMAs are permanently deformed.

== One-way vs. two-way shape memory ==
Shape-memory alloys have different shape-memory effects. The two common effects are one-way SMA and two-way SMA. A schematic of the effects is shown below.
The procedures are very similar: starting from martensite, adding a deformation, heating the sample and cooling it again.

=== One-way memory effect ===
When a shape-memory alloy is in its cold state (below &quot;Mf&quot;), the metal can be bent or stretched and will hold those shapes until heated above the transition temperature. Upon heating, the shape changes to its original. When the metal cools again, it will retain the shape, until deformed again.

With the one-way effect, cooling from high temperatures does not cause a macroscopic shape change. A deformation is necessary to create the low-temperature shape. On heating, transformation starts at &quot;As&quot; and is completed at &quot;Af&quot; (typically 2 to 20 °C or hotter, depending on the alloy or the loading conditions). &quot;As&quot; is determined by the alloy type and composition and can vary between and .

===Two way effect ===
The two-way shape-memory effect is the effect that the material remembers two different shapes: one at low temperatures, and one at the high temperature.
A material that shows a shape-memory effect during both heating and cooling is said to have two-way shape memory. This can also be obtained without the application of an external force (intrinsic two-way effect).
The reason the material behaves so differently in these situations lies in training. Training implies that a shape memory can &quot;learn&quot; to behave in a certain way.
Under normal circumstances, a shape-memory alloy &quot;remembers&quot; its low-temperature shape, but upon heating to recover the high-temperature shape, immediately &quot;forgets&quot; the low-temperature shape. However, it can be &quot;trained&quot; to &quot;remember&quot; to leave some reminders of the deformed low-temperature condition in the high-temperature phases. One way of training the SMA consists in applying a cyclic thermal load under constant stress field. During this process, internal defects are introduced into the microstructure which generates internal permanent stresses that facilitate the orientation of the martensitic crystals. Therefore, while cooling a trained SMA in austenitic phase under no applied stress, the martensite is formed detwinned due to the internal stresses, which leads to the material shape change. And while heating back the SMA into austenite, it recovers its initial shape.

There are several ways of doing this. A shaped, trained object heated beyond a certain point will lose the two-way memory effect.

== Pseudoelasticity ==
SMAs display a phenomenon sometimes called superelasticity, but is more accurately described as pseudoelasticity. “Superelasticity” implies that the atomic bonds between atoms stretch to an extreme length without incurring plastic deformation. Pseudoelasticity still achieves large, recoverable strains with little to no permanent deformation, but it relies on more complex mechanisms.

SMAs exhibit at least 3 kinds of pseudoelasticty. The two less-studied kinds of pseudoelasticity are pseudo-twin formation and rubber-like behavior due to short range order.
The main pseudoelastic effect comes from a stress-induced phase transformation. The figure on the right exhibits how this process occurs.

Here a load is isothermally applied to a SMA above the austenite finish temperature, Af, but below the martensite deformation temperature, Md. The figure above illustrates how this is possible, by relating the pseudoelastic stress-induced phase transformation to the shape memory effect temperature induced phase transformation. For a particular point on Af, it is possible to choose a point on the Ms  line with a &quot;higher&quot; temperature, as long as that point Md also has a higher &quot;stress&quot;. The material initially exhibits typical elastic-plastic behavior for metals. However, once the material reaches the martensitic stress, the austenite will transform to martensite and detwin. As previously discussed, this detwinning is reversible when transforming back from martensite to austenite. If large stresses are applied, plastic behavior such as detwinning and slip of the martensite will initiate at sites such as grain boundaries or inclusions. If the material is unloaded before plastic deformation occurs, it will revert to austenite once a critical stress for austenite is reached (σas). The material will recover nearly all strain that was induced from the structural change, and for some SMAs this can be strains greater than 10 percent. This hysteresis loop shows the work done for each cycle of the material between states of small and large deformations, which is important for many applications.
In a plot of strain versus temperature, the austenite and martensite start and finish lines run parallel. The SME and pseudoelasticity are actually different parts of the same phenomenon, as shown on the left.

The key to the large strain deformations is the difference in crystal structure between the two phases. Austenite generally has a cubic structure while martensite can be monoclinic or another structure different from the parent phase, typically with lower symmetry. For a monoclinic martensitic material such as Nitinol, the monoclinic phase has lower symmetry which is important as certain crystallographic orientations will accommodate higher strains compared to other orientations when under an applied stress. Thus it follows that the material will tend to form orientations that maximize the overall strain prior to any increase in applied stress. One mechanism that aids in this process is the twinning of the martensite phase. In crystallography, a twin boundary is a two-dimensional defect in which the stacking of atomic planes of the lattice are mirrored across the plane of the boundary. Depending on stress and temperature, these deformation processes will compete with permanent deformation such as slip.

σms is dependent on parameters such as temperature and the number of nucleation sites for phase nucleation. Interfaces and inclusions will provide general sites for the transformation to begin, and if these are great in number, it will increase the driving force for nucleation. A smaller σms will be needed than for homogeneous nucleation. Likewise, increasing temperature will reduce the driving force for the phase transformation, so a larger σms will be necessary. One can see that as you increase the operational temperature of the SMA, σms will be greater than the yield strength, σy, and superelasticity will no longer be observable.

== History ==
The first reported steps towards the discovery of the shape-memory effect were taken in the 1930s. According to Otsuka and Wayman, Arne Ölander discovered the pseudoelastic behavior of the Au-Cd alloy in 1932. Greninger and Mooradian (1938) observed the formation and disappearance of a martensitic phase by decreasing and increasing the temperature of a Cu-Zn alloy. The basic phenomenon of the memory effect governed by the thermoelastic behavior of the martensite phase was widely reported a decade later by Kurdjumov and Khandros (1949) and also by Chang and Read (1951).

The nickel-titanium alloys were first developed in 1962–1963 by the United States Naval Ordnance Laboratory and commercialized under the trade name Nitinol (an acronym for Nickel Titanium Naval Ordnance Laboratories). Their remarkable properties were discovered by accident. A sample that was bent out of shape many times was presented at a laboratory management meeting. One of the associate technical directors, Dr. David S. Muzzey, decided to see what would happen if the sample was subjected to heat and held his pipe lighter underneath it. To everyone&#x27;s amazement the sample stretched back to its original shape.

There is another type of SMA, called a ferromagnetic shape-memory alloy (FSMA), that changes shape under strong magnetic fields. These materials are of particular interest as the magnetic response tends to be faster and more efficient than temperature-induced responses.

Metal alloys are not the only thermally-responsive materials; shape-memory polymers have also been developed, and became commercially available in the late 1990s.

== Crystal structures ==
Many metals have several different crystal structures at the same composition, but most metals do not show this shape-memory effect. The special property that allows shape-memory alloys to revert to their original shape after heating is that their crystal transformation is fully reversible. In most crystal transformations, the atoms in the structure will travel through the metal by diffusion, changing the composition locally, even though the metal as a whole is made of the same atoms. A reversible transformation does not involve this diffusion of atoms, instead all the atoms shift at the same time to form a new structure, much in the way a parallelogram can be made out of a square by pushing on two opposing sides. At different temperatures, different structures are preferred and when the structure is cooled through the transition temperature, the martensitic structure forms from the austenitic phase.

== Manufacture ==
Shape-memory alloys are typically made by casting, using vacuum arc melting or induction melting. These are specialist techniques used to keep impurities in the alloy to a minimum and ensure the metals are well mixed. The ingot is then hot rolled into longer sections and then drawn to turn it into wire.

The way in which the alloys are &quot;trained&quot; depends on the properties wanted. The &quot;training&quot; dictates the shape that the alloy will remember when it is heated. This occurs by heating the alloy so that the dislocations re-order into stable positions, but not so hot that the material recrystallizes. They are heated to between and for 30 minutes, shaped while hot, and then are cooled rapidly by quenching in water or by cooling with air.

== Properties ==
The copper-based and NiTi-based shape-memory alloys are considered to be engineering materials. These compositions can be manufactured to almost any shape and size.

The yield strength of shape-memory alloys is lower than that of conventional steel, but some compositions have a higher yield strength than plastic or aluminum. The yield stress for Ni Ti can reach . The high cost of the metal itself and the processing requirements make it difficult and expensive to implement SMAs into a design. As a result, these materials are used in applications where the super elastic properties or the shape-memory effect can be exploited. The most common application is in actuation.

One of the advantages to using shape-memory alloys is the high level of recoverable plastic strain that can be induced. The maximum recoverable strain these materials can hold without permanent damage is up to for some alloys. This compares with a maximum strain for conventional steels.

== Practical limitations ==

SMA have many advantages over traditional actuators, but do suffer from a series of limitations that may impede practical application. In numerous studies, it was emphasised that only a few of patented shape memory alloy applications are commercially successful due to material limitations combined with a lack of material and design knowledge and associated tools, such as improper design approaches and techniques used. The challenges in designing SMA applications are to overcome their limitations, which include a relatively small usable strain, low actuation frequency, low controllability, low accuracy and low energy efficiency.

=== Response time and response symmetry ===
SMA actuators are typically actuated electrically, where an electric current results in Joule heating. Deactivation typically occurs by free convective heat transfer to the ambient environment. Consequently, SMA actuation is typically asymmetric, with a relatively fast actuation time and a slow deactuation time. A number of methods have been proposed to reduce SMA deactivation time, including forced convection, and lagging the SMA with a conductive material in order to manipulate the heat transfer rate.

Novel methods to enhance the feasibility of SMA actuators include the use of a conductive &quot;lagging&quot;. this method uses a thermal paste to rapidly transfer heat from the SMA by conduction. This heat is then more readily transferred to the environment by convection as the outer radii (and heat transfer area) are significantly greater than for the bare wire. This method results in a significant reduction in deactivation time and a symmetric activation profile. As a consequence of the increased heat transfer rate, the required current to achieve a given actuation force is increased.

=== Structural fatigue and functional fatigue ===
SMA is subject to structural fatigue – a failure mode by which cyclic loading results in the initiation and propagation of a crack that eventually results in catastrophic loss of function by fracture. The physics behind this fatigue mode is accumulation of microstructural damage during cyclic loading. This failure mode is observed in most engineering materials, not just SMAs.

SMAs are also subject to functional fatigue, a failure mode not typical of most engineering materials, whereby the SMA does not fail structurally but loses its shape-memory/superelastic characteristics over time. As a result of cyclic loading (both mechanical and thermal), the material loses its ability to undergo a reversible phase transformation. For example, the working displacement in an actuator decreases with increasing cycle numbers. The physics behind this is gradual change in microstructure—more specifically, the buildup of accommodation slip dislocations. This is often accompanied by a significant change in transformation temperatures. Design of SMA actuators may also influence both structural and functional fatigue of SMA, such as the pulley configurations in SMA-Pulley system.

=== Unintended actuation ===
SMA actuators are typically actuated electrically by Joule heating. If the SMA is used in an environment where the ambient temperature is uncontrolled, unintentional actuation by ambient heating may occur.

== Applications ==

=== Industrial ===

==== Aircraft and spacecraft ====
Boeing, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Goodrich Corporation, NASA, Texas A&amp;M University and All Nippon Airways developed the Variable Geometry Chevron using a NiTi SMA. Such a variable area fan nozzle (VAFN) design would allow for quieter and more efficient jet engines in the future. In 2005 and 2006, Boeing conducted successful flight testing of this technology.

SMAs are being explored as vibration dampers for launch vehicles and commercial jet engines. The large amount of hysteresis observed during the superelastic effect allow SMAs to dissipate energy and dampen vibrations. These materials show promise for reducing the high vibration loads on payloads during launch as well as on fan blades in commercial jet engines, allowing for more lightweight and efficient designs. SMAs also exhibit potential for other high shock applications such as ball bearings and landing gear.

There is also strong interest in using SMAs for a variety of actuator applications in commercial jet engines, which would significantly reduce their weight and boost efficiency. Further research needs to be conducted in this area, however, to increase the transformation temperatures and improve the mechanical properties of these materials before they can be successfully implemented. A review of recent advances in high-temperature shape-memory alloys (HTSMAs) is presented by Ma et al.

A variety of wing-morphing technologies are also being explored.

==== Automotive ====
The first high-volume product (&gt; 5Mio actuators / year) is an automotive valve used to control low pressure pneumatic bladders in a car seat that adjust the contour of the lumbar support / bolsters. The overall benefits of SMA over traditionally-used solenoids in this application (lower noise/EMC/weight/form factor/power consumption) were the crucial factor in the decision to replace the old standard technology with SMA.

The 2014 Chevrolet Corvette became the first vehicle to incorporate SMA actuators, which replaced heavier motorized actuators to open and close the hatch vent that releases air from the trunk, making it easier to close. A variety of other applications are also being targeted, including electric generators to generate electricity from exhaust heat and on-demand air dams to optimize aerodynamics at various speeds.

==== Robotics ====
There have also been limited studies on using these materials in robotics, for example the hobbyist robot Stiquito (and &quot;Roboterfrau Lara&quot;), as they make it possible to create very lightweight robots. Recently, a prosthetic hand was introduced by Loh et al. that can almost replicate the motions of a human hand [Loh2005]. Other biomimetic applications are also being explored. Weak points of the technology are energy inefficiency, slow response times, and large hysteresis.

==== Valves ====
SMAs are also used for actuating valves. The SMA valves are particularly compact in design.

==== Bio-engineered robotic hand ====
There is some SMA-based prototypes of robotic hand that using shape memory effect (SME) to move fingers.

==== Civil structures ====
SMAs find a variety of applications in civil structures such as bridges and buildings. In the form of rebars or plates, they can be used for flexural, shear and seismic strengthening of concrete and steel structures. Another application is Intelligent Reinforced Concrete (IRC), which incorporates SMA wires embedded within the concrete. These wires can sense cracks and contract to heal micro-sized cracks. Also the active tuning of structural natural frequency using SMA wires to dampen vibrations is possible, as well as the usage of SMA fibers in concrete.

==== Piping ====
The first consumer commercial application was a shape-memory coupling for piping, e.g. oil pipe lines, for industrial applications, water pipes and similar types of piping for consumer/commercial applications.

=== Consumer electronics ===
==== Smartphone cameras ====
Several smartphone companies have released handsets with optical image stabilisation (OIS) modules incorporating SMA actuators, manufactured under licence from Cambridge Mechatronics.

=== Medicine ===
Shape-memory alloys are applied in medicine, for example, as fixation devices for osteotomies in orthopaedic surgery, as the actuator in surgical tools; active steerable surgical needles for minimally invasive percutaneous cancer interventions in the surgical procedures such as biopsy and brachytherapy, in dental braces to exert constant tooth-moving forces on the teeth, in Capsule Endoscopy they can be used as a trigger for biopsy action.

The late 1980s saw the commercial introduction of Nitinol as an enabling technology in a number of minimally invasive endovascular medical applications. While more costly than stainless steel, the self expanding properties of Nitinol alloys manufactured to BTR (Body Temperature Response), have provided an attractive alternative to balloon expandable devices in stent grafts where it gives the ability to adapt to the shape of certain blood vessels when exposed to body temperature. On average, of all peripheral vascular stents currently available on the worldwide market are manufactured with Nitinol.

==== Optometry ====
Eyeglass frames made from titanium-containing SMAs are marketed under the trademarks Flexon and TITANflex. These frames are usually made out of shape-memory alloys that have their transition temperature set below the expected room temperature. This allows the frames to undergo large deformation under stress, yet regain their intended shape once the metal is unloaded again. The very large apparently elastic strains are due to the stress-induced martensitic effect, where the crystal structure can transform under loading, allowing the shape to change temporarily under load. This means that eyeglasses made of shape-memory alloys are more robust against being accidentally damaged.

==== Orthopedic surgery ====

Memory metal has been utilized in orthopedic surgery as a fixation-compression device for osteotomies, typically for lower extremity procedures. The device, usually in the form of a large staple, is stored in a refrigerator in its malleable form and is implanted into pre-drilled holes in the bone across an osteotomy. As the staple warms it returns to its non-malleable state and compresses the bony surfaces together to promote bone union.

==== Dentistry ====
The range of applications for SMAs has grown over the years, a major area of development being dentistry. One example is the prevalence of dental braces using SMA technology to exert constant tooth-moving forces on the teeth; the nitinol archwire was developed in 1972 by orthodontist George Andreasen. This revolutionized clinical orthodontics. Andreasen&#x27;s alloy has a patterned shape memory, expanding and contracting within given temperature ranges because of its geometric programming.

Harmeet D. Walia later utilized the alloy in the manufacture of root canal files for endodontics.

==== Essential tremor ====
Traditional active cancellation techniques for tremor reduction use electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic systems to actuate an object in the direction opposite to the disturbance. However, these systems are limited due to the large infrastructure required to produce large amplitudes of power at human tremor frequencies. SMAs have proven to be an effective method of actuation in hand-held applications, and have enabled a new class active tremor cancellation devices. One recent example of such device is the Liftware spoon, developed by Verily Life Sciences subsidiary Lift Labs.

=== Engines ===
Experimental solid state heat engines, operating from the relatively small temperature differences in cold and hot water reservoirs, have been developed since the 1970s, including the Banks Engine, developed by Ridgway Banks.

=== Crafts ===
Sold in small round lengths for use in affixment-free bracelets.

=== Heating and cooling ===

German scientists at Saarland University have produced a prototype machine that transfers heat using a nickel-titanium (&quot;nitinol&quot;) alloy wire wrapped around a rotating cylinder. As the cylinder rotates, heat is absorbed on one side and released on the other, as the wire changes from its &quot;superelastic&quot; state to its unloaded state. According to a 2019 article released by Saarland University, the efficiency by which the heat is transferred appears to be higher than that of a typical heat pump or air conditioner.

Almost all air conditioners and heat pumps in use today employ vapor-compression of refrigerants. Over time, some of the refrigerants used in these systems leak into the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. If the new technology, which uses no refrigerants, proves economical and practical, it might offer a significant breakthrough in the effort to reduce climate change.

=== Clamping Systems ===
Shape memory alloys (SMAs), such as nickel-titanium (Nitinol), are used in clamping systems due to their unique thermo-responsive behavior. The clamps made from SMA are used in the dentofacial surgery to heal mandibular fractures.

<text>Julie Bowen (born Julie Bowen Luetkemeyer; March 3, 1970) is an American actress. She is best known for starring as Claire Dunphy in the ABC sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot; (2009–2020), for which she received widespread critical acclaim. She won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2011 and 2012.

Bowen also starred as Roxanne Please in NBC medical drama series &quot;ER&quot; (1998–1999), Carol Vessey in the NBC comedy series &quot;Ed&quot; (2000–2004), Denise Bauer in the ABC legal drama series &quot;Boston Legal&quot; (2005–2007), and Sarah Shephard in the ABC drama series &quot;Lost&quot; (2005–2007).

Bowen has appeared in many films, such as &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996), &quot;Multiplicity&quot; (1996), &quot;Joe Somebody&quot; (2001), &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; (2011), &quot;Life of the Party&quot; (2018), &quot;Hubie Halloween&quot; (2020), &quot;The Fallout&quot; (2021), and &quot;Totally Killer&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Bowen was born on March 3, 1970 in Baltimore, Maryland, the second of three daughters of Suzanne (&quot;née&quot; Frey) and John Alexander Luetkemeyer Jr., a commercial real estate developer. She is the sister of infectious disease specialist Annie Luetkemeyer and designer Molly Luetkemeyer. Bowen is of German descent.

Raised in suburban Ruxton-Riderwood, Maryland, Bowen first attended Calvert School, then Garrison Forest School, Roland Park Country School, and St. George&#x27;s School in Middletown, Rhode Island. She attended Brown University, majoring in Italian Renaissance studies. She spent her junior year in Florence, Italy. During college, she had roles in &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Stage Door&quot;, and &quot;Lemon Sky&quot;. Before graduating, she had the lead role in the independent film &quot;Five Spot Jewel&quot;. Bowen studied acting at the Actor&#x27;s Institute, among other places.

==Career==

Bowen had a role in the soap opera &quot;Loving&quot; (1992) and an episode of the college drama &quot;Class of &#x27;96&quot; (1993). She had the lead role in the television film &quot;Runaway Daughters&quot; (1994). She played the love interest of the title character in &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot; (1996). She appeared in the films &quot;Multiplicity&quot; (1996) and &quot;An American Werewolf in Paris&quot; (1997). She has had guest roles on television series such as &quot;Party of Five&quot; (1996) and &quot;Strange Luck&quot; (1996), as well as her role as Aunt Gwen in the drama series &quot;Dawson’s Creek&quot; (1999). 

Bowen had a recurring role as Roxanne Please on &quot;ER&quot; (1998–99). She first gained prominence on the television series &quot;Ed&quot; (2000–04), where she played high school English teacher Carol Vessey. She then guest starred as Sarah Shephard in five episodes of &quot;Lost&quot; (2005–07). She also played attorney Denise Bauer on the series &quot;Boston Legal&quot; (2005–08), and had a recurring role on &quot;Weeds&quot; (2008). She was a spokesmodel for Neutrogena, most recently advertising the Pure Glow products. She appeared on an episode of &quot;Celebrity Jeopardy!&quot; on August 31, 2010, and again on December 4, 2022.

From 2009 to 2020, Bowen starred as Claire Dunphy on the ABC sitcom &quot;Modern Family&quot;. For her portrayal, she received six consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (2010–15), winning the award in 2011 and 2012. Bowen has said that winning an Emmy is like &quot;German soldiers in the trenches of the World Wars&quot; and that &quot;when you win the award, it is like being pulled out of the trench.&quot; She also said, &quot;as exciting and wonderful as it is not to be in the trench, and to be recognized for what you do, it also means everyone has got a clear shot at you and that is a very frightening prospect for most of us.&quot;

In November 2021, Bowen&#x27;s production company, Bowen &amp; Sons, entered a first-look deal at Universal Television.

In March 2023, &quot;Prom Pact&quot;, a movie produced by Bowen, was released on the Disney Channel and Disney+ in the United States.

==Political views==
In 2016, Bowen appeared in &quot;Fight Song&quot;, a &quot;Pitch Perfect&quot;-inspired music video shown at the Democratic National Convention in support of nominee Hillary Clinton.

==Personal life==
Bowen suffers from the cardiovascular condition bradycardia: her regular heartbeat is below normal. As a result, she has had a pacemaker since her early twenties.

Bowen married Scott Phillips, a real estate investor and software developer, on September 9, 2004. They have three sons, the first born in April 2007, and twins born in May 2009, with whom she was visibly pregnant when shooting the pilot for &quot;Modern Family&quot;. She is a self-described &quot;low Protestant.&quot; In February 2018, she filed for divorce from Phillips and cited irreconcilable differences as the reason for the divorce. It was finalized on September 13, 2018.

<doc id="665738" wikidata="Q17141429" url="?curid=665738" title="Magnetic shape-memory alloy">
<text>A magnetic shape-memory alloy (MSMA) is a type of smart material that can undergo significant and reversible changes in shape in response to a magnetic field. This behavior arises due to a combination of magnetic and shape-memory properties within the alloy, allowing it to produce mechanical motion or force under magnetic actuation. MSMAs are commonly made from ferromagnetic materials, particularly nickel-manganese-gallium (Ni-Mn-Ga), and are useful in applications requiring rapid, controllable, and repeatable movement.

== Introduction ==
MSM alloys are ferromagnetic materials that can produce motion and forces under moderate magnetic fields. Typically, MSMAs are alloys of Nickel, Manganese and Gallium (Ni-Mn-Ga).

A &quot;magnetically induced deformation&quot; of about 0.2% was presented in 1996 by Dr. Kari Ullakko and co-workers at MIT. Since then, improvements on the production process and on the subsequent treatment of the alloys have led to deformations of up to 6% for commercially available &quot;single crystalline&quot; Ni-Mn-Ga MSM elements, as well as up to 10-12 % and 20% for new alloys in R&amp;D stage.

The large magnetically induced strain, as well as the short response times make the MSM technology very attractive for the design of innovative actuators to be used in pneumatics, robotics, medical devices and mechatronics. MSM alloys change their magnetic properties depending on the deformation. This companion effect, which co-exist with the actuation, can be useful for the design of displacement, speed or force sensors and mechanical energy harvesters.

The magnetic shape memory effect occurs in the low temperature martensite phase of the alloy, where the elementary cells composing the alloy have tetragonal geometry. If the temperature is increased beyond the martensite–austenite transformation temperature, the alloy goes to the austenite phase where the elementary cells have cubic geometry. With such geometry the magnetic shape memory effect is lost.

The transition from martensite to austenite produces force and deformation. Therefore, MSM alloys can be also activated thermally, like thermal shape memory alloys (see, for instance, Nickel-Titanium (Ni-Ti) alloys).

== The magnetic shape memory effect ==
The mechanism responsible for the large strain of MSM alloys is the so-called &quot;magnetically induced reorientation&quot; (MIR), and is sketched in the figure. Like other ferromagnetic materials, MSM alloys exhibit a macroscopic magnetization when subjected to an external magnetic field, emerging from the alignment of elementary magnetizations along the field direction. However, differently from standard ferromagnetic materials, the alignment is obtained by the geometric rotation of the elementary cells composing the alloy, and not by rotation of the magnetization vectors within the cells (like in magnetostriction).
A similar phenomenon occurs when the alloy is subjected to an external force. Macroscopically, the force acts like the magnetic field, favoring the rotation of the elementary cells and achieving elongation or contraction depending on its application within the reference coordinate system. The elongation and contraction processes are shown in the figure where, for example, the elongation is achieved magnetically and the contraction mechanically.

The rotation of the cells is a consequence of the large magnetic anisotropy of MSM alloys, and the high mobility of the internal regions. Simply speaking, an MSM element is composed by internal regions, each having a different orientation of the elementary cells (the regions are shown by the figure in green and blue colors). These regions are called twin-variants. The application of a magnetic field or of an external stress shifts the boundaries of the variants, called &quot;twin boundaries&quot;, and thus favors one variant or the other. When the element is completely contracted or completely elongated, it is formed by only one variant and it is said to be in a &quot;single variant state&quot;. The magnetization of the MSM element along a fixed direction differs if the element is in the contraction or in the elongation single variant state. The magnetic anisotropy is the difference between the energy required to magnetize the element in contraction single variant state and in elongation single variant state. The value of the anisotropy is related to the maximum work-output of the MSM alloy, and thus to the available strain and force that can be used for applications.

== Properties ==
The main properties of the MSM effect for commercially available elements are summarized in (where other aspects of the technology and of the related applications are described):
* Strain up to 6%
* Max. generated stress up to 3 MPa
* Minimum magnetic field for maximum strain: 500 kA/m
* Full strain (6%) up to 2 MPa load
* Workoutput per unit volume of about 150 kJ/m^3
* Energetic efficiency (conversion between input magnetic energy and output mechanical work) about 90%
* Internal friction stress of around 0.5 MPa
* Magnetic and thermal activation
* Operating temperatures between -40 and 60 °C
* Change in magnetic permeability and electric resistivity during deformation

=== Fatigue Properties ===
The fatigue life of MSMAs is of particular interest for actuation applications due to the high frequency cycling, so improving the microstructure of these alloys has been of particular interest. Researchers have improved the fatigue life up to 2x109 cycles with a maximum stress of 2MPa, providing promising data to support real application of MSMAs in devices. Although high fatigue life has been demonstrated, this property has been found to be controlled by the internal twinning stress in the material, which is dependent on the crystal structure and twin boundaries. Additionally, inducing a fully strained (elongated or contracted) MSMA has been found to reduce fatigue life, so this must be taken into consideration when designing functional MSMA systems. In general, reducing defects such as surface roughness that cause stress concentration can increase the fatigue life and fracture resistance of MSMAs.

== Development of the alloys ==
Standard alloys are Nickel-Manganese-Gallium (Ni-Mn-Ga) alloys, which are investigated since the first relevant MSM effect has been published in 1996. Other alloys under investigation are Iron-Palladium (Fe-Pd) alloys, Nickel-Iron-Gallium (Ni-Fe-Ga) alloys, and several derivates of the basic Ni-Mn-Ga alloy which further contain Iron (Fe), Cobalt (Co) or Copper (Cu). The main motivation behind the continuous development and testing of new alloys is to achieve improved thermo-magneto-mechanical properties, such as a lower internal friction, a higher transformation temperature and a higher Curie temperature, which would allow the use of MSM alloys in several applications. In fact, the actual temperature range of standard alloys is up to 50 °C. Recently, an 80 °C alloy has been presented.

Due to the twin boundary motion mechanism required for the magnetic shape memory effect to occur, the highest performing MSMAs in terms of maximum induced strain have been single crystals. Additive manufacturing has been demonstrated as a technique to produce porous polycrystalline MSMAs. As opposed to fully dense polycrystalline MSMAs, porous structures allow more freedom of motion, which reduces the internal stress required to activate martensitic twin boundary motion. Additionally, post-process heat treatments such as sintering and annealing have been found to significantly increase the hardness and reduce the elastic moduli of Ni-Mn-Ga alloys.

== Applications ==
MSM actuator elements can be used where fast and precise motion is required. They are of interest due to the faster actuation using magnetic field as compared to the heating/cooling cycles required for conventional shape memory alloys, which also promises higher fatigue lifetime. Possible application fields are robotics, manufacturing, medical surgery, valves, dampers, sorting. MSMAs have been of particular interest in the application of actuators (i.e. microfluidic pumps for lab-on-a-chip devices) since they are capable of large force and stroke outputs in relatively small spatial regions. Also, due to the high fatigue life and their ability to produce electromotive forces from a magnetic flux, MSMAs are of interest in energy harvesting applications.

The twinning stress, or internal frictional stress, of an MSMA determines the efficiency of actuation, so the operation design of MSM actuators is based on the mechanical and magnetic properties of a given alloy; for example, the magnetic permeability of an MSMA is a function of strain. The most common MSM actuator design consists of an MSM element controlled by permanent magnets producing a rotating magnetic field and a spring restoring a mechanical force during the shape memory cycling. Limitations on the magnetic shape memory effect due to crystal defects determine the efficiency of MSMAs in applications. Since the MSM effect is also temperature dependent, these alloys can be tailored to shift the transition temperature by controlling microstructure and composition.

<text>Bödeli (lit.: the Swiss German diminutive term for ground) is the tongue of land between Lake Thun and Lake Brienz in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland. Lake Thun and Lake Brienz were not yet separate after the last ice age. The rivers Lütschine from the south and the Lombach from the north brought enough debris to cause a partitioning over the millennia. Now Lake Brienz has a water level about higher than Lake Thun and the river Aare flows from one lake to the other through the Bödeli.

On the Bödeli are situated the villages and towns of Unterseen, Interlaken and Matten, which form a closed settlement area, and at the southern border are the villages of Wilderswil and Bönigen. From the south a hill range, the Ruuge, rises up.

==Bödelibahn==
Between 1870 and 1874 the Bödeli Railway (Bödelibahn) was constructed to link the steamer quay at Därligen on Lake Thun with the quay at Bönigen on Lake Brienz. The railway company cunningly arranged for the route to cross the Aare twice with bridges offering no headroom beneath for shipping, thus making it effectively impossible for a steamer company to compete with them.

<text>Rollerblade is a brand of inline skates owned by Nordica, part of the Tecnica Group of Giavera del Montello, Treviso, Italy.

The company was started by Scott Olson (b. 1960) in Minneapolis as Ole&#x27;s Innovative Sports; when they sold the company, it became Rollerblade, Inc. and has changed hands over time between Nordica, Benetton Group and Tecnica.

Inline-skates had been used for many years by ice speed skaters before they became mainstream. For the first few years after Rollerblade was developed, Rollerblade, Inc. were the only manufacturer of in-line skates that had worldwide distribution. This allowed the company to capitalize and grab a huge percentage of the world market share and almost total dominance of the North American market with aggressive advertising campaigns and sponsored in-line-only sporting events.

Rollerblade, Inc. manufactures different types of skates, such as those for aggressive skating, fitness, or recreational use with removable &quot;walkable&quot; liners, as well as adjustable skates for younger users.

<text>Burwell Baxter Bell III (born 9 April 1947) is a retired United States Army four-star general.

==Early life and education==
Bell was born and raised in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the son of Burwell B. Bell Jr. His father was a West Point graduate who worked in government nuclear facilities at Oak Ridge. Bell is the great-great-grandson of Arkansas Governor Henry Massie Rector and Mississippi governor and senator James L. Alcorn. He graduated from Oak Ridge High School in 1965 and played high school football for the &quot;Wildcats&quot;. In 1969 he graduated from the University of Chattanooga (now the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga), where he was a member of Kappa Sigma fraternity, with a degree in Business Administration. As a Distinguished Military Graduate of the university&#x27;s ROTC Program, Bell was commissioned in the United States Army in June 1969 as an Armor/Tank second lieutenant. Later, he received a Master of Science in Systems Management from the University of Southern California. Over the years, Bell also received Honorary Doctorate Degrees from the University of Maryland, University College; Keimyung University, South Korea; and the University of Tennessee.

==Military career==
During his military service, Bell completed the United States Army Armor School, Armor Officer Basic and Advanced Courses, United States Army Command and General Staff College, and the National War College. He also completed the army&#x27;s Ranger School where he was awarded the Ranger Tab.

From 1969 to 1972, Bell spent his initial assignment in the Army with the 3d Squadron, 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment in Bad Hersfeld, West Germany. During this initial three-year period of service during the Cold War, he led units patrolling the Iron Curtain between East and West Germany.

During his 39-year active duty career, Bell&#x27;s command positions included L Troop, 3d Squadron, 14th Armored Cavalry Regiment; D troop, 5th Reconnaissance Squadron; the 2nd Squadron, 9th Cavalry, 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized); and the 24th Infantry Division&#x27;s 2nd Brigade Combat Team.

<doc id="665779" wikidata="Q565495" url="?curid=665779" title="Joseph Wolpe">
<text>Joseph Wolpe (20 April 1915 in Johannesburg, South Africa – 4 December 1997 in Los Angeles) was a South African psychiatrist and one of the most influential figures in behavior therapy.

Wolpe grew up in South Africa, attending Parktown Boys&#x27; High School and obtaining his MD from the University of the Witwatersrand.

In 1956, Wolpe was awarded a Ford Fellowship and spent a year at Stanford University in the Center for Behavioral Sciences, subsequently returning to South Africa but permanently moving to the United States in 1960 when he accepted a position at the University of Virginia.

In 1965, Wolpe accepted a position at Temple University.

One of the most influential experiences in Wolpe&#x27;s life was when he enlisted in the South African army as a medical officer. Wolpe was entrusted to treat soldiers who were diagnosed with what was then called &quot;war neurosis&quot; but today is known as post traumatic stress disorder. The mainstream treatment of the time for soldiers was based on psychoanalytic theory, and involved exploring the trauma while taking a hypnotic agent – so-called narcotherapy. It was believed that having the soldiers talk about their repressed experiences openly would effectively cure their neurosis. However, this was not the case. It was this lack of successful treatment outcomes that forced Wolpe, once a dedicated follower of Freud, to question psychoanalytic therapy and search for more effective treatment options. Wolpe is most well known for his reciprocal inhibition techniques, particularly systematic desensitization, which revolutionized behavioral therapy. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Wolpe as the 53rd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, an impressive accomplishment accentuated by the fact that Wolpe was a psychiatrist.

== Reciprocal inhibition ==

In Wolpe&#x27;s search for a more effective way in treating anxiety he developed different reciprocal inhibition techniques, utilizing assertiveness training. Reciprocal inhibition can be defined as anxiety being inhibited by a feeling or response that is not compatible with the feeling of anxiety. Wolpe first started using eating as a response to inhibited anxiety in the laboratory cats. He would offer them food while presenting a conditioned fear stimulus. After his experiments in the laboratory he applied reciprocal inhibition to his clients in the form of assertiveness training. The idea behind assertiveness training was that you could not be angry or aggressive while simultaneously assertive at same time. Importantly, Wolpe believed that these techniques would lessen the anxiety producing association. Assertiveness training proved especially useful for clients who had anxiety about social situations. However, assertiveness training did have a potential flaw in the sense that it could not be applied to other kinds of phobias. Wolpe&#x27;s use of reciprocal inhibition led to his discovery of systematic desensitization. He believed that facing your fears did not always result in overcoming them but rather lead to frustration. According to Wolpe, the key to overcoming fears was &quot;by degrees&quot;. This idea was not necessarily original to Wolpe as a similar concept was discussed in works of Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, who lived about 1000 years earlier.

== Systematic desensitization ==

Systematic desensitization is what Wolpe is most famous for. Systematic desensitization is when the client is exposed to the anxiety-producing stimulus at a low level, and once no anxiety is present a stronger version of the anxiety-producing stimulus is given. This continues until the individual client no longer feels any anxiety towards the stimulus. There are three main steps in using systematic desensitization, following development of a proper case formulation or what Wolpe originally called, &quot;behavior analysis&quot;. The first step is to teach the client relaxation techniques.

Wolpe received the idea of relaxation from Edmund Jacobson, modifying his muscle relaxation techniques to take less time. Wolpe&#x27;s rationale was that one cannot be both relaxed and anxious at the same time. The second step is for the client and the therapist to create a hierarchy of anxieties. The therapist normally has the client make a list of all the things that produce anxiety in all its different forms. Then together, with the therapist, the client makes a hierarchy, starting with what produces the lowest level of anxiety to what produces the most anxiety. Next is to have the client be fully relaxed while imaging the anxiety producing stimulus. Depending on what their reaction is, whether they feel no anxiety or a great amount of anxiety, the stimulus will then be changed to a stronger or weaker one. Systematic desensitization, though successful, has flaws as well. The patient may give misleading hierarchies, have trouble relaxing, or not be able to adequately imagine the scenarios. Despite this possible flaw, it seems to be most successful.

== Achievements ==

Wolpe&#x27;s effect on behavioral therapy is long-lasting and extensive. He received many awards for his work in behavioral science. His awards included the American Psychological Associations Distinguished Scientific Award, the Psi Chi Distinguished Member Award, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Association for the Advancement of Behavior Therapy, where he was the second president. In addition to these awards, Wolpe&#x27;s alma mater, University of Witwatersrand, awarded him an honorary doctor of science degree in 1986. Furthermore, Wolpe was a prolific writer, some of his most famous books include, The Practice of Behavior Therapy and Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition. Joseph Wolpe&#x27;s dedication to psychology is clear in his involvement in the psychology community, a month before his death he was attending conferences and giving lectures at Pepperdine University even though he was retired. Moreover, his theories have lasted well beyond his death.

Wolpe developed the Subjective Units of Disturbance Scale (SUDS) for assessing the level of subjective discomfort or psychological pain. He also created the Subjective Anxiety Scale (SAS) and the Fear Survey Plan that are used in behavior research and therapy.

Wolpe died in 1997 of mesothelioma.

<text>Web traffic is the data sent and received by visitors to a website. Since the mid-1990s, web traffic has been the largest portion of Internet traffic. Sites monitor the incoming and outgoing traffic to see which parts or pages of their site are popular and if there are any apparent trends, such as one specific page being viewed mostly by people in a particular country. There are many ways to monitor this traffic, and the gathered data is used to help structure sites, highlight security problems or indicate a potential lack of bandwidth. 

Not all web traffic is welcomed.
Some companies offer advertising schemes that, in return for increased web traffic (visitors), pay for screen space on the site.

Sites also often aim to increase their web traffic through inclusion on search engines and through search engine optimization.

==Analysis==

Web analytics is the measurement of the behavior of visitors to a website. In a commercial context, it especially refers to the measurement of which aspects of the website work towards the business objectives of Internet marketing initiatives; for example, which landing pages encourage people to make a purchase.

==Control==

The amount of traffic seen by a website is a measure of its popularity. By analyzing the statistics of visitors, it is possible to see shortcomings of the site and look to improve those areas. It is also possible to increase the popularity of a site and the number of people that visit it.

===Limiting access===

It is sometimes important to protect some parts of a site by password, allowing only authorized people to visit particular sections or pages.

Some site administrators have chosen to block their page to specific traffic, such as by geographic location. The re-election campaign site for U.S. President George W. Bush (GeorgeWBush.com) was blocked to all internet users outside of the U.S. on 25 October 2004 after a reported attack on the site.

It is also possible to limit access to a web server both based on the number of connections and the bandwidth expended by each connection.

==Sources==
===From search engines===

The majority of website traffic is driven by search engines. Millions of people use search engines every day to research various topics, buy products, and go about their daily surfing activities. Search engines use keywords to help users find relevant information, and each of the major search engines has developed a unique algorithm to determine where websites are placed within the search results. When a user clicks on one of the listings in the search results, they are directed to the corresponding website and data is transferred from the website&#x27;s server, thus counting the visitors towards the overall flow of traffic to that website.

Search engine optimization (SEO), is the ongoing practice of optimizing a website to help improve its rankings in the search engines. Several internal and external factors are involved which can help improve a site&#x27;s listing within the search engines. The higher a site ranks within the search engines for a particular keyword, the more traffic it will receive.

===Increasing traffic===
Web traffic can be increased by the placement of a site in search engines and the purchase of advertising, including bulk e-mail, pop-up ads, and in-page advertisements. 

Web traffic can also be purchased through web traffic providers that can deliver targeted traffic. 

Web traffic can be increased not only by attracting more visitors to a site, but also by encouraging individual visitors to &quot;linger&quot; on the site, viewing many pages in a visit. (&quot;see Outbrain for an example of this practice&quot;)

If a web page is not listed in the first pages of any search, the odds of someone finding it diminishes greatly (especially if there is other competition on the first page). Very few people go past the first page, and the percentage that go to subsequent pages is substantially lower. Consequently, getting proper placement on search engines, a practice known as SEO, is as important as the website itself.

==Traffic overload==

Too much web traffic can dramatically slow down or prevent all access to a website. This is caused by more file requests going to the server than it can handle and may be an intentional attack on the site or simply caused by over-popularity. Large-scale websites with numerous servers can often cope with the traffic required, and it is more likely that smaller services are affected by traffic overload. Sudden traffic load may also hang your server or may result in a shutdown of your services.

===Denial of service attacks===

Denial-of-service attacks (DoS attacks) have forced websites to close after a malicious attack, flooding the site with more requests than it could cope with. Viruses have also been used to coordinate large-scale distributed denial-of-service attacks.

===Sudden popularity===
A sudden burst of publicity may accidentally cause a web traffic overload. A news item in the media, a quickly propagating email, or a link from a popular site may cause such a boost in visitors (sometimes called a flash crowd or the Slashdot effect).

== Fake traffic ==
Interactive Advertising Bureau estimated in 2014 that around one third of Web traffic is generated by Internet bots and malware.

==Traffic encryption==

According to Mozilla since January 2017, more than half of the Web traffic is encrypted with HTTPS. Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, and it secures information and data transfer between a user&#x27;s browser and a website.

<doc id="665790" wikidata="Q589968" url="?curid=665790" title="Wengen">
<text>Wengen () is a mountain village in the Bernese Oberland of central Switzerland. Located in the canton of Bern at an elevation of above sea level, it is part of the Jungfrauregion and has approximately 1,300 year-round residents, which swells to 5,000 during summer and to 10,000 in the winter. Wengen hosts the classic Lauberhorn ski races of the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup in January.

==History==
Wengen was first mentioned in official documents in 1268, and the origin of the name is unknown.

Primarily an alpine farming community, the village began to be visited by tourists in the early 19th century. Mary and Percy Bysshe Shelley&#x27;s &quot;History of a Six Weeks&#x27; Tour&quot; and Byron&#x27;s &quot;Manfred&quot;, in which the scenery of the area is described, were published in 1817. This literature became the advent of the modern tourism industry for the village. Felix Mendelssohn, to whom there is a memorial above the village, also visited in the early nineteenth century.

Guesthouses and hotels began to be built in the mid-19th century, with the opening of the &quot;Launerhaus&quot; in 1859, with accommodation for 30 guests, and in 1880 the &quot;Pension Wengen&quot; was available to 100 guests. The building and opening of the Wengernalpbahn in the 1890s made the village more accessible to tourists who previously had to walk up the steep slopes to the alpine village, opening the area for an expansion of tourism and the beginning of the ski industry.

In the early 20th century, British tourists started ski-clubs in the area, beginning in the nearby village of Mürren. By 1903 Wengen had an Anglican Church and two years later, Sir Henry Lunn formed the Public Schools Alpine Sports Club with Wengen as a destination ski area for the members. A British Methodist minister, Lunn first visited the area to organize a meeting of Protestant churches in nearby Grindelwald where he learned about winter sports such as skiing. He returned to the area in 1896 with his son Arnold, who quickly learned to ski, and both father and son realized the potential in the future of winter sports. The club was established a few years later. Members of the Public Schools Alpine Sports Club were required to have attended an English public school or one of the &quot;older universities&quot;. Wengen&#x27;s Curling Club was established in 1911.

The first ski races were held in the early 1920s with the British downhill championship held in 1921; the following year a ski race was held between Oxford and Cambridge. These events were the first to have downhill races as opposed to Nordic races, which were held in other Swiss resorts. In Wengen, skiers requested use of the train system for access to the slopes; for some years trains were the earliest ski-lifts in the area. Arnold Lunn used the natural terrain of the mountains for the courses; the downhill event followed the slopes above Wengen and was called the &quot;straight down&quot;: skiers went straight down the mountain. Also during this period, Lunn invented, and introduced in Wengen, the first slalom race, in which skiers followed the terrain through the trees, replaced with ski gates in later years. These events are considered the birth of modern ski racing and Alpine skiing.

From August 1944 to the end of World War II, Wengen served as a sort of open-air internment camp for allied prisoners, mostly US bomber crews. Since the only practical way in or out of Wengen was via the cog railway, it was difficult for internees to escape.

==Churches==

Wengen has three churches; Protestant English and Swiss and Roman Catholic.

The Swiss church was rebuilt in the 1950s and overlooks the Lauterbrunnen Valley.

English churches were established during the nineteenth century in nearby Grindelwald, Meiringen, and Murren. By 1912, Anglican services were taking place in Wengen&#x27;s Swiss church twice on Sundays. Desiring their own building, the Continental &amp; Colonial Church Society erected a new English church, which was consecrated on 15 January 1928 by the Bishop of Fulham. The building is on the road formerly leading to the Mannlichen cable car lift. The new cable car station is however nearer the centre of Wengen. St Bernard&#x27;s has been used for over 90 years for Sunday services and occasional offices, such as the memorial in 1949 for Anthony Carrick, a schoolboy who died in the mountains. The congregation in 1954 was described as consisting &#x27;of people from many parts of the British Commonwealth and America as well as English-speaking Continentals&#x27;. The congregation continues to be diverse.

The Roman Catholic church stands adjacent to the Falken Hotel and has a distinctive onion dome. Mass is celebrated on most Sundays in-season.

==Politics==
Together with villages of Mürren, Isenfluh, Gimmelwald, Stechelberg and Lauterbrunnen, Wengen forms the political commune of Lauterbrunnen.

==Transport==

There are generally no roads to Wengen/Mürren. It is one of very few car-free resort villages in Europe, although there are a few service vehicles, local farm vehicles, electric vehicles for taxiing to and from the railway station. This creates a tranquil atmosphere throughout the village and reduces traffic noise. For ecological reasons other resorts are considering following the car-free example. Across the Lauterbrunnen valley, Mürren, too, is largely car free.

Wengen is serviced by the Rack railway system Wengernalpbahn (WAB), and the village is accessible directly from Lauterbrunnen, or by train from Grindelwald via Kleine Scheidegg, as well as by a series of gondola lifts from Grindelwald via Mannlichen. In Kleine Scheidegg, the mountain pass at the foot of the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau, passengers must disembark and change trains to travel down to Grindelwald and Grund. The rail service from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen railway station runs daily from early in the morning until very late at night and is the most intensively operated section of the Wengernalpbahn. There are approximately 40 services between Lauterbrunnen to Wengen every day. Each service may consist of up to 4 separate trains, running closely behind each other because during busy periods, the scheduled train can be followed by additional trains as necessary, optimizing capacity.

The uphill journey takes around 14 minutes, and the downhill journey takes 17 minutes. The downhill services take longer because they arrive at the midpoint passing place below Wengwald slightly earlier than the uphill services, allowing the uphill services to pass them and proceed to Wengen without stopping. All trains now use the less steep but slightly longer route via Wengwald. The old route runs across the footpath to Wengen. It was used for freight transport after the new route was created, but has since been abandoned. All freight is delivered by rail from Lauterbrunnen into a depot underneath the passenger railway station, and refuse is returned from the village also by rail. Every day one or two goods trains goes from Lauterbrunnen to Wengen and back carrying large items such as furniture.

The cable car Luftseilbahn Wengen-Männlichen operates seasonally. The view from the tram and from Männlichen above, affords clear vistas of Wengen and much of Lauterbrunnen Valley and small villages.

== Recreation ==
Wengen hosts the internationally well-known Lauberhorn ski races, and it is on the route of the Jungfrau Marathon.

The classic ski races have been held in Wengen since 1930, and traditionally consist of a downhill, a slalom, and a combined event. In addition to being one of the technically most challenging downhill races, the Lauberhorn is the longest race in the FIS World Cup circuit and arguably the most scenic. The top racers complete the run in about 2½ minutes and the top speeds reached at &quot;Haneggschuss&quot; are the highest on the circuit, approaching a half-minute prior to the finish.

== Culture ==
A special cultural feature of Wengen is the so-called &quot;Pfeifende Lurch&quot; (German for &quot;whistling amphibian&quot;). It is a legendary creature from myths and tales that only exists in Wengen.

<text>Phantom Power is the sixth studio album by the Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. The album was released in 1998. It won the 1999 Juno Awards for Best Rock Album and Best Album Design.

==Songs==
The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Poets&quot;, reached #1 on &quot;RPM&#x27;s&quot; alternative chart, and stayed #1 for 12 weeks straight, longer than any other song in the history of that chart.

&quot;Bobcaygeon&quot; was also released as a single, and won the Juno Award for Single of the Year in 2000. It has since become recognized as one of the band&#x27;s most enduring and beloved signature songs.

The song &quot;Escape Is at Hand for the Travellin&#x27; Man&quot; is a tribute to Jim Ellison of Material Issue. The band recorded the song &quot;Something On&quot; while stuck in the studio during the ice storm of 1998.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Phantom Power&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart with 108,000 units sold. The album has been certified triple platinum in Canada. By February 1999, the album had sold more than 400,000 copies in Canada. Between 1996 and 2016, &quot;Phantom Power&quot; was the seventh best-selling album by a Canadian band in Canada.

==Reissue==
In August 2023, the band announced the release of a 25th anniversary box set edition of the album, set for November 23, 2023. Along with remastered versions of the original album&#x27;s songs, the anniversary edition will also feature a two-disc live set performed at the Metropol in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1998, five outtakes not included on the original album, and seven alternate versions of songs on the album.

<doc id="665796" wikidata="Q6314527" url="?curid=665796" title="The Ultimate Foe">
<text>The Ultimate Foe is the fourth and final serial of the larger narrative known as &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; which encompasses the whole of the 23rd season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. It was first broadcast in two weekly parts on BBC1 on 29 November and 6 December 1986. This segment is also cited in some reference works under its working title of Time Incorporated (or Time Inc.). The title &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot; is never used on-screen and was first used in relation to these episodes for the 1988 novelisation, with the two episodes that comprise the serial being referred to as &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; Parts Thirteen and Fourteen. This was the last story to feature Colin Baker as the Sixth Doctor, as Baker declined to do the regeneration (when he was dismissed from the role) for the following story, &quot;Time and the Rani&quot;.

In the serial, continuing from the events of &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot;, the genocide charges against the alien time traveller the Sixth Doctor for destroying the Vervoids are interrupted by the Doctor&#x27;s enemy the Master (Anthony Ainley), who seeks to have the Doctor and his prosecutor the Valeyard (Michael Jayston) destroy one another in the virtual micro-universe the Matrix, and to create a power vacuum where the High Council of the Time Lords is deposed so the Master can take command.

==Plot==

The Sixth Doctor boldly claims the Valeyard&#x27;s evidence has been falsified, and the Matrix has been tampered with. The Keeper of the Matrix insists this is impossible. Glitz and Mel arrive unexpectedly in the courtroom. The Master appears on the Matrix screen to claim responsibility and to demonstrate it&#x27;s possible to breach the Matrix. At the Master&#x27;s insistence, Glitz reveals the data he tried to obtain on Ravolox included technological secrets from the Matrix, which was stolen by the Sleepers. The Time Lords traced the Sleepers to their base on Earth and dragged the planet across space to the location in which the Doctor found it, nearly annihilating all life on the planet in the process. The Doctor denounces the Time Lords as decadent and corrupt. The Master explains that the Valeyard is a manifestation of the Doctor&#x27;s darker side &quot;somewhere between [the Doctor&#x27;s] twelfth and final incarnation&quot;; the High Council offered the Valeyard the Doctor&#x27;s remaining regenerations in exchange for falsifying evidence.

When the Doctor demands to halt the trial as he cannot be both the defendant and prosecutor, the Valeyard flees into the Matrix, a virtual reality where normal logic does not apply. The Doctor pursues with Glitz, emerging next to a building labelled &quot;The Fantasy Factory (proprietor: J. J. Chambers)&quot;. A clerk named Mr. Popplewick sends them to a deserted wasteland. To the Doctor&#x27;s horror, hands emerge from the ground and grab him, dragging him underground. Glitz is unable to rescue him, but the Doctor rises from the ground unharmed, insisting correctly that nothing that happens in the Matrix is real. The Valeyard appears and taunts the Doctor before unleashing nerve gas, forcing the Doctor and Glitz to take refuge in a run-down cottage. As they stumble inside, it dematerialises – it is the Master&#x27;s TARDIS.

The Master reveals that he wishes the Doctor to prevail over the Valeyard, since he fears the Valeyard&#x27;s ability to defeat him. He puts the Doctor into a catatonic state and sends him out of his TARDIS to lure the Valeyard out of hiding. The Valeyard emerges onto a balcony, but fires upon the Master, forcing him to flee. Mel emerges from a tunnel and the Doctor, recognising her voice, emerges from his trance. She leads him out of the Matrix and into the trial room. They agree that she should tell the truth, and she confirms to the court that the scenes of the Vervoids&#x27; destruction, the basis of the Valeyard&#x27;s charge of genocide, are as she witnessed them. The Inquisitor finds the Doctor guilty and declares that his life is forfeit. He accepts the verdict as the fulfilment of justice and is led off to execution.

However, this is another illusion. Mel is frantic that the Doctor needs help, grabbing the Keeper&#x27;s key and entering the Matrix. She finds the Doctor and warns him – but he had already realised the courtroom was a fake and merely wished to reach a final confrontation with the Valeyard. Bribed by the Master, Glitz returns to the Fantasy Factory; he finds the master tape of the data he thought was destroyed on Ravolox. Glitz escapes with the data to the Master&#x27;s TARDIS, while the Doctor asks Popplewick for Chambers; Popplewick doesn&#x27;t comply. The Doctor and Mel lay hold of him, and the Doctor peels away his face to reveal Popplewick as a disguised Valeyard. They realise that a concealed machine in the room is a particle disseminator, with which the Valeyard plans to murder the members of the court.

The Inquisitor learns the High Council has been deposed. The Master appears on the Matrix screen to offer to impose order in return for power. He loads Glitz&#x27;s master tape into his TARDIS systems, but a booby-trap is triggered, paralysing him and Glitz. Mel emerges from the Matrix to warn the Time Lords. They cannot turn off the Matrix screen, but the Doctor sabotages the Valeyard&#x27;s weapon and the Fantasy Factory explodes; he flees the Matrix, back to the courtroom. The Inquisitor drops the charges against him and reveals that Peri survived the events on Thoros Beta and became Yrcanos&#x27;s queen. She urges the Doctor to stand for Lord President of the new Council, but he suggests she should stand. He urges the Time Lords to be lenient towards Glitz, while he returns Mel back to her proper time.

As the Inquisitor leaves the trial room, she gives instructions to the Keeper of the Matrix. As he looks up at the camera, he is revealed to be the Valeyard.

==Production==

Robert Holmes was originally commissioned to write the two episodes. However, he died from a chronic liver ailment after completing a draft of the first and left nothing beyond a plot outline of the second. The series script editor Eric Saward resigned around this time due to disagreements with the producer, John Nathan-Turner, but agreed to write the final episode based on Holmes&#x27; outline, and also rewrite Holmes&#x27; draft to tie the two together, for which he was credited as Script Editor. Much of Holmes&#x27;s original draft, involving as it did a reenactment of one of the Whitechapel Murders ascribed to Jack the Ripper, was felt to be unsuitable, and most of the material set in the Matrix in the episode credited to Holmes is in fact Saward&#x27;s work. The original ending to the segment as a whole (and, indeed, the whole &quot;Trial&quot; story and possibly the series) would have seen the Doctor and the Valeyard in an inconclusive cliffhanger, both (seemingly) plunging into a void to their deaths as an extra &quot;hook&quot;. However, Nathan-Turner felt this was too downbeat and believed that it was important that the season did not end on an inconclusive note to demonstrate the series was back in business and avoid providing an excuse for BBC management to cancel the series altogether. Saward refused to change the ending and withdrew permission to use his script very late in the day, by which point the production team had been assembled and the segment was entering rehearsals.

John Nathan-Turner commissioned Pip and Jane Baker to write a replacement final episode. For copyright reasons they could not be told anything of the content of Saward&#x27;s script (and there were lawyers observing all the commissioning meetings). The only similarity between the two is the announcement that the High Council of the Time Lords have resigned, which was a natural development of the earlier scripts. The new script ended on an optimistic note, with the Doctor departing for new adventures. In keeping with this more optimistic stance, Nathan-Turner decided to amend the script at the last minute to show how Peri had not died as shown in &quot;Mindwarp&quot; but had in fact survived and became Yrcanos&#x27;s warrior queen. Her apparent death was a part of the Valeyard&#x27;s tampering with the Matrix. A shot from the earlier story was used to show this. Nicola Bryant was absolutely disappointed to learn how the fate of her character had been changed. The working title of this story was &quot;Time Incorporated&quot;. This title did not appear in the final scripts or on-screen.

Although the other episodes of this season were the usual 25 minutes in length, it proved impossible to edit episode 14 down to that length. Nathan-Turner applied for and received special permission for the episode to run 5 minutes over its scheduled time slot, making it 30 minutes.

==Commercial releases==

===In print===
A novelisation of this serial, written by Pip and Jane Baker, was published by Target Books in April 1988 as &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot;. &quot;The Ultimate Foe&quot; was the working title for the 9th to 12th parts of the season, now generally called &quot;Terror of the Vervoids&quot;. The novel ends with an additional scene in which Mel is returned to the Doctor&#x27;s future, and hints that the events of the following serial &quot;Time and the Rani&quot; took place after several other adventures and before the Sixth Doctor&#x27;s regeneration.

===Home media===
In October 1993, this story was released on VHS as part of the three-cassette &quot;The Trial of a Time Lord&quot; set.

<text>Cobham Analytic Solutions (formerly SPARTA, Inc.) is a United States defense contractor based in Lake Forest, California. It was started in 1979 and has more than 20 offices around the United States. The acronym, SPARTA, stood for &quot;Systems Planning Analysis Research and Technology Associates.&quot;

Prior to its acquisition by Cobham plc, SPARTA was unusual for a U.S. defense contractor in that it was publicly held but privately traded; it was more than 98% owned by its 1,300 employees. Employees were granted stock options based on various criteria, including corporate profit and individual contribution to bringing in new business. Employees could sell stock back to the company when their options vested, at a price determined by a formula for valuing the company.

Prior to the acquisition, some benefits and company procedures were decided upon by a council of employees which met annually. Slightly fewer than one third of the representatives to the council were elected by the employees.

In June 2008, SPARTA was acquired by Cobham plc for US$407 million. It was renamed Cobham Analytic Solutions.

<text>The Lauberhorn is a mountain in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland, located between Wengen and Grindelwald, north of the Kleine Scheidegg. Its summit is at an elevation of above sea level.

== Lauberhorn ski races ==

The mountain is best known for the &quot;Lauberhorn&quot; World Cup alpine ski races, held annually in mid-January above Wengen. The downhill course is currently (as of 2016) the longest in the world; its length of results in run times of two and a half minutes.

The Lauberhorn ski races (downhill, slalom, and combined) are among the highest-attended winter sports events in the world, attracting around 30,000 spectators each year.

Races are held on two famous courses &quot;Lauberhorn&quot; (downhill) and &quot;Männlichen&quot; (slalom).

<text>Highway 9, the &quot;Agassiz-Rosedale Highway&quot;, is a north-south route in the eastern part of the Fraser Valley. It acts as the last connection between the Trans Canada Highway (Highway 1) and the Lougheed Highway (Highway 7) eastbound before Hope, and is the main access to the resort village of Harrison Hot Springs and the town of Agassiz The highway first opened in 1953, originally going between Yale Road in Rosedale and Highway 7, with a ferry across the Fraser River. A bridge for Highway 9 across the Fraser opened in 1956. When the section of Highway 1 east of Chilliwack opened in 1961, Highway 9 was extended south to a junction with the new Highway 1 alignment, which replaced Yale Road as the main route between Chilliwack and Hope.

==Route details==

Highway 9 is long. In the south, the Highway starts at an interchange on Highway 1 between Rosedale and the Bridal Falls area. Highway 9 travels north for to its bridge over the Fraser River. After crossing the Fraser, Highway 9 travels north for to the centre of Agassiz. On the north side of Agassiz, Highway 9 meets Highway 7, and the two highways share a common alignment for . Highway 9 then travels north to terminate at Harrison Hot Springs.

== Major intersections ==

<text>Aggie Muster is a tradition at Texas A&amp;M University which celebrates the camaraderie of the university while remembering the lives of alumni who have died, specifically those in the past year. Muster officially began on April 21, 1903, as a day for remembrance of fellow Aggies. Muster ceremonies today take place in approximately 320 locations globally. The largest muster ceremony occurs in Reed Arena, on the Texas A&amp;M campus. The &quot;Roll Call for the Absent&quot; commemorates Aggies, alumni and current students, who died that year. Alumni, family, and friends light candles and as they answer “here” when the name of their loved one is “called”. Campus muster also serves as a 50th-year class reunion for the corresponding graduating class. Some non-campus muster ceremonies do not include the pageantry of the campus ceremony, and might consist simply of a barbecue.

==Early years==
On June 26, 1883, alumni of Texas A&amp;M University gathered together to &quot;live over again their college days, the victories and defeats won and lost upon the drill field and in the classroom.&quot; The same year, the Ex-Cadets Association established the &quot;Roll Call for the Absent&quot;. The event grew into a loosely organized annual tradition, but did not have a permanent date set aside until several decades later, when it merged with a different tradition.

In 1889, Texas A&amp;M administrators declared that April 21 (which in Texas is known as San Jacinto Day, the anniversary of the Battle of San Jacinto whereby Texas gained its independence from Mexico) would be an official school holiday. Each year on San Jacinto Day, the cadets would have a track and field competition. In 1903, then-A&amp;M President Davis Houston encountered much student resistance to the idea of cancelling the holiday. Houston agreed to retain the holiday as long as the students promised to use it for constructive purposes.

Beginning April 21, 1903, the tradition of Aggie Muster merged with the Texas Independence celebration, featuring athletic events and banquets to honor alumni. For the next 15 years, the event would occur unchanged as a day of play, celebration and fellowship. In 1918, though, with many alumni away involved in World War I and unable to return to campus, A&amp;M President Bizzell encouraged alumni and the student body to gather wherever they were on April 21, becoming the first Aggie administrator to officially support the tradition.

==A. and M. Day==
In the early 1920s, as alumni returned from the war and settled throughout Texas, regional A&amp;M clubs formed to reunite alumni. With the proliferation of these groups, the Muster tradition began to have a more formal atmosphere. In 1923, the student radio station WTAW broadcast a statewide program for over two dozen Aggie groups who had gathered at points across Texas. The March 1923 &quot;Texas Aggie&quot; urged, &quot;If there is an A&amp;M man in one-hundred miles of you, you are expected to get together, eat a little, and live over the days you spent at the A&amp;M College of Texas.&quot;

The tradition of reading aloud the roll call of the dead began in 1924, with the addition of the tune &quot;Taps&quot; in 1927. The following year, 23 alumni were added to the roll call. During the Great Depression, alumni continued to celebrate April 21, calling it &quot;A. and M. Day&quot;, and using the gathering to help raise money to support current students and alumni, as well as advancing job-placements.

==World War II==

The most well-known Aggie Muster took place during World War II in 1942 on the Philippine island of Corregidor at the entrance to Manila Bay. At this time, Corregidor was the last American stronghold against the Japanese forces in the Philippines, and Japanese artillery and warplanes were constantly attacking. The American artillery commander on Corregidor was Brigadier General George F. Moore, a 1908 graduate of Texas A&amp;M. With the help of Major Tom Dooley, class of 1935, Moore gathered the names of 25 other Aggies under his command. Despite the fierce fighting as the Japanese laid siege to the island, on April 21, 1942, Moore held a roll call—known as muster in army terms—calling the names of each of the Aggies under his command.

Only 12 of the 25 survived the battle and the POW camps to which the survivors were sent. Dooley told a United Press correspondent about the gathering, and the reporter sent an article back to the USA about the 25 Aggies who had &quot;Mustered&quot;. The story captured the imagination of the country and &quot;helped boost American spirits at a time a lift was badly needed.&quot; Lt. Col. (Ret.) William A. Hamilton Jr., Class of 1940, recognized as the last living survivor of the &quot;Muster on the Rock&quot;, died on January 4, 2018, at age 99.

Association of Former Students Executive Secretary E. E. McQuillen, Class of 1920, is credited with refocusing San Jacinto Day as a remembrance for fallen Aggies. He changed the April 21, 1943, celebration to be the first known as an Aggie Muster and sent packets to each A&amp;M club, Aggie Moms club, and to US military bases around the world with a detailed program of events for April 21. It included greetings from the A&amp;M President and a poem by Dr. John Ashton of A&amp;M&#x27;s class of 1906, which he had written at McQuillen&#x27;s request. Entitled &quot;The Heroes&#x27; Roll Call&quot; and also known as the &quot;Roll Call for the Absent&quot;, it also commemorates the 1942 Muster and is designed so that the number of years since 1942 can be inserted. The response was overwhelming, with 10,000 alumni worldwide mustering in 500 locations. The following year, McQuillen added a list of recently deceased Aggies to the packets, asking each local group to choose names from the list and call them aloud during their ceremony, and &quot;as each name is called a comrade will answer &#x27;Here&#x27;.&quot;

In April 1945, just eight weeks after the United States recaptured Corregidor, three Aggies conducted a Muster &quot;on the Rock&quot; and wrote letters home to McQuillen detailing the events. A year later, on April 21, 1946, an even larger Muster occurred on Corregidor as 128 Aggies gathered on the island from various posts for Muster and to remember their fallen comrades. They posed for a photograph at the mouth of the Malinta Tunnel with an improvised A&amp;M flag made from a bed sheet, and the photograph became famous.

With the war now over, A&amp;M held a special Victory Homecoming Muster on Easter morning in 1946. Over 15 thousand Aggies gathered at Kyle Field to listen to a speech by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. Lt. Col. Tom Dooley also presented the &quot;Muster Tradition&quot; and conducted a WWII Roll Call. To represent the 900 alumni who died in World War II, the names of the four deceased WWII Aggie Medal of Honor recipients were called.

Muster became a student organization in 1950, and students now coordinate all aspects of the campus Muster in College Station, Texas. On April 21, 2015, the university dedicated a monument on Corregidor designed by College of Architecture students.

==Modern Muster==

Randy Matson, the keynote speaker at the 2000 campus Muster, vowed, &quot;we&#x27;re here (tonight) to pledge that none of you will be forgotten as long as there are two Aggies left in the world.&quot;

The largest Muster each year, with over 12,000 in attendance, is held in Reed Arena on the campus of Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. This campus Muster is dedicated to the 50-year reunion class of that year, demonstrating unity among Aggies. During the day, a Camaraderie Barbecue is held at the Academic Plaza around noon to rekindle the spirit of the original Muster celebration. The evening Muster ceremony begins with a keynote speaker. Several poems are read, including &quot;The Last Corps Trip&quot;, which imagines a Judgement Day in which Aggies are welcomed into Heaven with open arms: Following the 1999 Aggie Bonfire collapse, additional verses of &quot;The Last Corps Trip&quot; honoring those who died were written.

Following the readings, the room is darkened for the Roll Call of the Absent. This Roll Call honors alumni who have died since the last Muster. As the names are called, a family member or friend answers &quot;Here&quot;, and lights a candle in remembrance of that person. Following the Roll Call, the Ross Volunteers perform a three-volley salute, and buglers play &quot;Silver Taps&quot;, a version of the US military&#x27;s melody of farewell.

Smaller Musters are held in over 300 other locations, including in Kosovo, Germany, Istanbul, Seoul, and almost every county in Texas. Names can be called at multiple Muster ceremonies. For example, a person may be honored at the Muster in his hometown, while the Muster in the town where his parents live may also choose to call his name. Most of the smaller Musters do not have the pageantry of the campus Muster. In all cases, a Roll Call for the Absent is held, but the ceremony may take place in conjunction with a barbecue or fish fry, to allow for fellowship.

In 2018, a Sunrise Muster has been added to the Campus Muster activities. In addition to the traditional muster activities, the name of every Aggie that died in the previous year, worldwide that year is read at the Clayton W. Williams Jr. Alumni Center at 6:51 am. This is to ensure that each alumna and each alumnus who has died in the preceding year will have someone say &quot;here&quot; for them. The event is streamed live on AggieNetwork.com.

<doc id="665809" wikidata="Q996599" url="?curid=665809" title="Long weekend">
<text>A long weekend is a weekend that is at least three days long (i.e. a three-day weekend), due to a public or unofficial holiday occurring on either the following Monday or the preceding Friday.

Many countries also have four-day weekends, in which two days adjoining the weekend are holidays. Examples are Good Friday / Easter Monday, and Christmas Day / Boxing Day (e.g. when Christmas Day occurs on a Thursday or Monday).

== Four-day &quot;bridge&quot; weekends ==
In many countries, when a lone holiday occurs on a Tuesday or a Thursday, the day between the holiday and the weekend may also be designated as a holiday, set to be a movable or floating holiday, or work/school may be interrupted by consensus unofficially. This is typically referred to by a phrase involving &quot;bridge&quot; in many languages; for example in some Spanish-speaking countries the term is &quot;puente&quot; (&quot;bridge&quot;) or simply &quot;fin de semana largo&quot;.

Four-day bridge weekends are commonplace in non-English speaking countries, but there are only a couple of examples in English-speaking countries:

In the United States, the fourth Thursday of November is Thanksgiving, a public holiday on which most workplaces are closed; many workplaces remain closed the following day to create a four-day weekend.

In Melbourne, Australia, the Melbourne Cup holiday is held on a Tuesday. The Monday is not a public holiday, but many people modify their work arrangements to also have the Monday off and many schools will have a &quot;pupil free day&quot;, so it is colloquially referred to as the &quot;Cup Day long weekend&quot;.

==Europe==
In Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium, &quot;brugdag&quot; (&quot;bridge&quot; day) is used.
In the Netherlands also &quot;Klemdag&quot; is used.

In France, a bridge idiom is used: &quot;faire le pont&quot; (&quot;to make the bridge&quot;) is used to mean taking additional holiday days. For example, if there is already an official holiday on Thursday, one could &quot;faire le pont&quot; on the Friday and thus have a four-day weekend (Thursday through Sunday inclusive).

In the German language, a bridge-related term is also used: a day taken off from work to fill the gap between a holiday Thursday (or Tuesday) and the weekend is called a &quot;Brückentag&quot; (&quot;bridge day&quot;) in Germany and Switzerland, and a &quot;Fenstertag&quot; (&quot;window day&quot;) in Austria. Since Ascension Day is a holiday throughout Germany and Corpus Christi is a holiday in large parts of the country (both of these holidays are always on Thursdays), such &quot;bridge days&quot; are fairly common, though always unofficial in character.

Italians use the idiom &quot;Fare il ponte&quot;: literally, &quot;make the bridge&quot;. This could be a Thursday–Sunday weekend if the bridge was over Friday, or a Saturday–Tuesday weekend if the bridge was over a Monday.

In Norway, the term &quot;oval weekend&quot; (&quot;oval helg&quot; in Norwegian) is used. An ordinary weekend is conceived of as &quot;round&quot; (although this is not stated explicitly), and adding extra days off makes it &quot;oval&quot;. Norwegians also refer to &quot;inneklemte&quot; (squeezed in) days, which are between a public holiday and a weekend. This is typical for the Friday after Ascension Day, which always falls on a Thursday. It is common not to work on such days, so as to be able to extend the weekend to four days.

In Poland, long weekends occur several times a year. The term &quot;długi weekend&quot; (&quot;long weekend&quot;) is commonly used in the Polish language. As well as the Easter weekend and the Christmas weekend, there is Corpus Christi weekend (Corpus Christi is always on Thursday and people usually take Friday off as well) and it may occur also around other holidays. However, the best-known long weekend is at the beginning of May, when there are holidays of Labour Day on May 1 and 3 May Constitution Day. The weekend can in fact be up to 9 days long (April 28 – May 6) and, taking one to three days off work, Poles often go for short holidays then.

Portugal also uses the bridge idiom with the Portuguese word &quot;ponte&quot;. 

In Slovenian, the term &quot;podaljšan vikend&quot; (&quot;prolonged weekend&quot;) is used for a three-day weekend. Four-day weekends also happen, because May 1 and May 2 are public holidays (both May Day). A peculiar coincidence are Christmas Day and Independence Day, falling on two consecutive dates.

In the United Kingdom, where the majority of public holidays are termed &quot;bank holidays&quot; by statute, five of the eight public holidays in England and Wales always fall on a Monday or a Friday. When a fixed-date holiday in the UK falls on a weekend, the next weekday is normally designated as a substitute holiday. As such, bank holidays normally form an extension of the weekend and are known as &quot;bank holiday weekends&quot;: terminology which is also common in some Commonwealth countries and the Republic of Ireland. There is, however, no automatic entitlement to time off on a bank holiday under British labour laws, and thus not everyone benefits from long weekends. If an employee is entitled to time off on a bank holiday, it may count towards their 5.6 weeks-equivalent of statutory annual leave, though many companies offer bank holidays as an addition to employees&#x27; contracted annual leave entitlement.

In Spain, the bridge becomes a &quot;macropuente&quot; when the anniversary of the Spanish Constitution of 1978 (December 6) and the Feast of the Immaculate Conception (December 8) fall on a Tuesday and Thursday, respectively.

In Sweden, a day between a weekend and a bank holiday is called a &quot;klämdag&quot; (&quot;squeeze day&quot;). Many Swedes take a vacation day to have a long weekend.

==Middle East==
In Israel, a &quot;bridge&quot; metaphor is also used: (&quot;&quot;, literally &quot;bridge day&quot;).

In Iran, the Arabic term (&quot;&quot;), which means &quot;between two holidays,&quot; is used.

==North America==
In the United States, the Uniform Monday Holiday Act officially moved federal government observances of many holidays to Mondays, largely at the behest of the travel industry. The resulting long weekends are often termed &quot;three-day weekends&quot; as a result. A well-known four-day weekend starts with Thanksgiving and Black Friday after.

==South America==
In Argentina, some national holidays that occur on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday (sometimes even on a Saturday) are officially moved to the closest Monday in order to create a long weekend.

In Brazil, when a holiday occurs in a Tuesday or a Thursday, some sectors of the society, as government and education, turn the day between the holiday and the weekend into a holiday. The four-day or even the three-day weekends are called in Brazilian Portuguese &quot;feriados prolongados&quot; (&quot;Extended holidays&quot;) or its popular form &quot;feriadão&quot; (&quot;big holiday&quot;). The bridge day is usually called &quot;imprensado&quot; (&quot;pressed (in between)&quot;) or &quot;enforcado&quot; (&quot;hanged&quot;). To some extent, the term &quot;ponte&quot; is also used. One could also use the verb &quot;emendar&quot; (&quot;splice&quot;), saying &quot;eu vou emendar o feriado e o fim de semana&quot; (&quot;I will splice together the holiday and the weekend.&quot;)

In Chile, a &quot;sandwich&quot; is a day that falls between two holidays, independently of whether it&#x27;s a holiday by itself or not. In the latter case, workers may take it off on account on vacation days, an action called &quot;tomarse el sandwich&quot; (lit.: &quot;taking the sandwich&quot;). In formal writings, the term &quot;interferiado&quot; is used instead of &quot;sandwich&quot;. In colloquial contexts, these days, almost always a Monday or a Friday, may be called &quot;San Lunes&quot; or &quot;San Viernes&quot; (lit.: &quot;Saint Monday&quot; and &quot;Saint Friday&quot;, respectively) as well.

==Asia==
In Indonesia, when a non holiday occurs between two holidays or one of them is a weekend, is colloquially termed &quot;Harpitnas&quot; (&#x27;Hari Kejepit Nasional&#x27;) (lit. National Clamped/Pinched Day, a play on &quot;Hardiknas&quot;, National Education Day) causing some institutions to declare a day off, or some students or employees unilaterally declaring a day off for themselves, thereby creating a long weekend.

In Japan, a weekday which falls between two public holidays is legally a public holiday.

<text>The Wengernalp is an alpine meadow at an elevation of 1874 m, above Wengen in the Bernese Oberland of Switzerland.

It lies on the southern slopes of the Lauberhorn, just below Kleine Scheidegg, a mountain pass connecting the valleys of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald. The pass is traversed by a railway bearing its name, the Wengernalp Railway (WAB) with a railway station serving the locality, the Wengernalp station.

The Wengernalp is a popular for its views over the giants of the Bernese Alps. In fact, it directly faces the huge northern walls of the Jungfrau, Mönch and Eiger, across the extremely narrow Trümmelbach valley.

In 1841 the hotel &quot;De la Jungfrau&quot; was opened; it was later rebuilt after a fire in 1865.

In winter, the Wengernalp (and Kleine Scheidegg) are part of a large ski area.

Amongst the many historical, famous people who have spent holidays on the Wengernalp are Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, Richard Wagner and Peter Tchaikovsky.

<doc id="665811" wikidata="Q7537947" url="?curid=665811" title="Skynd (troll)">
<text>Skynd is the name of a troll in a Danish fairy tale.

The tale was recorded by Just Mathias Thiele in &quot;Danmarks folkesagn&quot;, who localised it to Skjelverød, near Ringsted, where it was supposedly the origin of the place-name &quot;Kirstens Bjerg&quot; (Kirsten&#x27;s hill), and in English by Thomas Keightley in his &quot;The Fairy Mythology&quot;. Edwin Sidney Hartland included it in his &quot;The Science of Fairy Tales&quot;, as a double example of the power of the knowledge of names. Keightley stated that the tale was &quot;orally related to Mr. Thiele&quot;, but Thiele attributed it to Seyer Mahling Beyer&#x27;s &quot;En geographisk-historisk og oeconomisk, physisk-antiqvarisk Beskrivelse over Bringstrup og Sigersted Sogne ved Ringsted&quot; (published in 1791) and noted a similar tale from Normandy.

The story is that a hill-troll living in the hill of that name had stolen three wives in succession from a man in the village of Englerup. Late one night, the man was riding home from Ringsted and saw a crowd of hill-dwellers dancing and making merry, among whom he recognised all three of his former wives. He called out to Kirsten, his second wife, whom he had loved best; the troll, whose name was Skynd (the imperative mood of the Danish verb &quot;skynde&quot; (to hurry), asked him why he presumed to call her name, and the man explained how much he had cherished her and begged to be allowed to take her home again. Finally Skynd granted his wish, on condition that he must never hurry (&quot;skynde&quot;) her. For a long time the man obeyed, but one day when she took a long time bringing something down from the loft, he called out &quot;Skynd dig Kirsten!&quot; (Hurry up, Kirsten!), and at once she vanished, forced to return to the troll in the hill, which since then has been called Kirsten&#x27;s Bjerg.

According to Thiele, Beyer also wrote that the chalice in the church at Alsted had been taken from the underground dwellers (&quot;underjordiske&quot;) of Kirstens Bjerg.

The crater Skynd, on Uranus&#x27;s moon Umbriel, is named after the troll.

<text>The Breidbart Index, developed by Seth Breidbart, is the most significant &quot;cancel index&quot; in Usenet.

A cancel index measures the dissemination intensity of substantively identical articles. If the index exceeds a threshold the articles are called newsgroup spam. They can then be removed using third party cancel controls.

==Cancel Index==
*Crossposting is the act of posting the same message to multiple newsgroups
*Multiposting is the act of posting the same contents multiple times

The principal idea of the &quot;Breidbart-Index&quot; is to give these methods different weight.
With a crossposted message less data needs to be transferred and stored.
And excessive crossposts (ECP) are also a likely beginner&#x27;s error, while excessive multiposts (EMP) suggest deliberate usage of special software.

The crucial issue is categorizing multiple articles as &quot;substantively identical&quot;.
This includes
*byte-for-byte identical messages
*otherwise identical postings minimally customized for each group it appears in
*advertising the same service
*articles that consist solely of the same signature
*articles which consist of inclusions of other user&#x27;s postings, but are otherwise identical

==Breidbart Index (BI)==
The Breidbart Index of a set of articles is defined as the sum of the square root of &quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the number of newsgroups to which an article is cross posted.

;Formula
formula_1

;Example
Two copies of a posting are made, one to 9 groups, and one to 16.

formula_2

==Breidbart-Index, Version 2 (BI2)==
A more aggressive criterion, Breidbart Index Version 2, has been proposed. The BI2 is defined as the sum of the square root of &quot;n&quot;, plus the sum of &quot;n&quot;, divided by two. A single message would only need to be crossposted to 35 newsgroups to breach the threshold of 20.

;Formula
formula_3

;Example
Two copies of a posting are made, one to 9 groups, and one to 16.

formula_4

==Skirvin-Breidbart Index (SBI, BI3)==
The name &quot;Skirvin-Breidbart Index&quot; and the abbreviation SBI are mentioned in the &quot;Spam Thresholds FAQ&quot;. However, in hierarchy nl.* this index is called BI3.

The SBI is calculated similar to the BI2 but adds up the number of groups in Followup-to: (if present) instead of the number of groups in Newsgroups:. This encourages the use of Followup-to:.

;Example
Two posts contain the same text. One is crossposted to 9 groups. The other is crossposted to 16, with four groups in Followup-to:.

formula_5

==BI7 and BI30==
In hierarchy de.* the Breidbart index is used with a time range of seven days instead of 45. This is denoted by the abbreviation &quot;BI7&quot;.

In hierarchy codice_1 the Breidbart index is used with a time range of 30 days instead of 45. This is denoted by the abbreviation &quot;BI30&quot;.

==Cancel Index in at.*==
This is defined in the FAQ of the group at.usenet.cancel-reports.
The term used in the Call for Votes and in the FAQ is &quot;Cancel-Index&quot;.
Unofficial abbreviations are &quot;CI&quot; and &quot;ACI&quot;.

The ACI of a single post equals 3 plus the number of groups that the post was sent to. The index of multiple posts is the sum of the indices of the individual posts.

==Thresholds==
* According to RFC 1036 only the author of the target message or the administrator of the site that injected the message is allowed to send a cancel.
* According to the Spam Thresholds FAQ a BI of 20/45 applies to all hierarchies. Series of articles above this limit may be canceled by everyone.
* In some hierarchies alternative (stricter) limits were defined through a public vote.
* No cancel messages or any derivatives thereof are allowed within free.*.

In fact a cancel message is a just a non-binding request to remove a certain article.
News server operators can freely decide on how to implement the conflicting policies.

<text>In mathematics, particularly in algebra, the injective hull (or injective envelope) of a module is both the smallest injective module containing it and the largest essential extension of it. Injective hulls were first described in .

==Definition==

A module &quot;E&quot; is called the injective hull of a module &quot;M&quot;, if &quot;E&quot; is an essential extension of &quot;M&quot;, and &quot;E&quot; is injective. Here, the base ring is a ring with unity, though possibly non-commutative.

==Examples==

* An injective module is its own injective hull.

==Properties==
* The injective hull of &quot;M&quot; is unique up to isomorphisms which are the identity on &quot;M&quot;, however the isomorphism is not necessarily unique. This is because the injective hull&#x27;s map extension property is not a full-fledged universal property. Because of this uniqueness, the hull can be denoted as &quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;).
* The injective hull &quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is a maximal essential extension of &quot;M&quot; in the sense that if &quot;M&quot;⊆&quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) ⊊&quot;B&quot; for a module &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;M&quot; is not an essential submodule of &quot;B&quot;.
* The injective hull &quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is a minimal injective module containing &quot;M&quot; in the sense that if &quot;M&quot;⊆&quot;B&quot; for an injective module &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is (isomorphic to) a submodule of &quot;B&quot;.
* If &quot;N&quot; is an essential submodule of &quot;M&quot;, then &quot;E&quot;(&quot;N&quot;)=&quot;E&quot;(&quot;M&quot;).
* Every module &quot;M&quot; has an injective hull. A construction of the injective hull in terms of homomorphisms Hom(&quot;I&quot;, &quot;M&quot;), where &quot;I&quot; runs through the ideals of &quot;R&quot;, is given by .
* The dual notion of a projective cover does &quot;not&quot; always exist for a module, however a flat cover exists for every module. 

===Ring structure===
In some cases, for &quot;R&quot; a subring of a self-injective ring &quot;S&quot;, the injective hull of &quot;R&quot; will also have a ring structure. For instance, taking &quot;S&quot; to be a full matrix ring over a field, and taking &quot;R&quot; to be any ring containing every matrix which is zero in all but the last column, the injective hull of the right &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;R&quot; is &quot;S&quot;. For instance, one can take &quot;R&quot; to be the ring of all upper triangular matrices. However, it is not always the case that the injective hull of a ring has a ring structure, as an example in shows.

A large class of rings which do have ring structures on their injective hulls are the nonsingular rings. In particular, for an integral domain, the injective hull of the ring (considered as a module over itself) is the field of fractions. The injective hulls of nonsingular rings provide an analogue of the ring of quotients for non-commutative rings, where the absence of the Ore condition may impede the formation of the classical ring of quotients. This type of &quot;ring of quotients&quot; (as these more general &quot;fields of fractions&quot; are called) was pioneered in , and the connection to injective hulls was recognized in .

==Uniform dimension and injective modules==

An &quot;R&quot; module &quot;M&quot; has finite uniform dimension (=&quot;finite rank&quot;) &quot;n&quot; if and only if the injective hull of &quot;M&quot; is a finite direct sum of &quot;n&quot; indecomposable submodules.

==Generalization==
More generally, let C be an abelian category. An object &quot;E&quot; is an injective hull of an object &quot;M&quot; if &quot;M&quot; → &quot;E&quot; is an essential extension and &quot;E&quot; is an injective object.

If C is locally small, satisfies Grothendieck&#x27;s axiom AB5 and has enough injectives, then every object in C has an injective hull (these three conditions are satisfied by the category of modules over a ring). Every object in a Grothendieck category has an injective hull.

<doc id="665822" wikidata="Q7180579" url="?curid=665822" title="Phantom Power (Super Furry Animals album)">
<text>Phantom Power is the sixth album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, released on 21 July 2003 by Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The record was originally conceived as a ten-song concept album using D-A-D-D-A-D guitar tuning, but the band chose to abandon this idea during recording as they didn&#x27;t want to constrain themselves. The group did attempt to create a &quot;more coherent&quot; album than their past efforts by choosing songs which worked well together. &quot;Phantom Power&quot; was recorded at the band&#x27;s own studio, AV Happenings, in Cardiff with the Super Furries producing and engineering themselves for the first time. The album features a range of musical styles, from country rock to techno, although many of the tracks are based around the acoustic guitar. According to chief songwriter and vocalist Gruff Rhys, the album&#x27;s lyrics deal with &quot;broken relationships and war&quot;.

The album, like their previous record &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, was simultaneously released on CD, vinyl and DVD. The DVD featured a surround sound mix of the album along with animations, commentary by Mario Caldato Jr. (who mixed the record) and remixes. The majority of these remixes were re-released as the album &quot;Phantom Phorce&quot; in 2004. &quot;Phantom Power&quot; was well received, with many critics suggesting it was the best album of the band&#x27;s career.

==Origins and recording==

&quot;Phantom Power&quot; was originally conceived as a ten-song cycle in the &quot;unconventional&quot; D-A-D-D-A-D guitar tuning. Singer Gruff Rhys wrote many of the songs on the album in this tuning and in the key of D major during the space of a few days. These tracks, which included the &quot;Father Father&quot; instrumentals, &quot;Golden Retriever&quot;, &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Valet Parking&quot; and &quot;Out of Control&quot;, were then demoed at the house of regular producer Gorwel Owen with overdubs added at the band&#x27;s own office-block based studio, AV Happenings, in Cardiff.

The group took a hands-on approach to the actual recording sessions for &quot;Phantom Power&quot;, engineering and producing themselves for the first time. Recording largely took place at AV Happenings during the second half of 2002, with the band working through the night so as not to disturb staff who worked in other parts of the building during the day. According to bassist Guto Pryce this involved a fair amount of trial and error as the band &quot;didn&#x27;t really know what [they] were doing&quot;. Soundproof booths were improvised by setting up tents in the office corridors: &quot;we&#x27;d record a guitar and it&#x27;d sound rubbish and we had to figure out why. So we started experimenting with different tent designs. In the end it was the wigwam that was easiest to put up and sounded best&quot;. The band had to take these booths down before office workers arrived in the morning, a process that guitarist Huw Bunford has described as &quot;ghosts in the night ... a bit clandestine&quot;. A brief two-week session with Gorwel Owen at Rockfield Studios saw some of the album&#x27;s more &quot;straight ahead&quot; tracks recorded with live vocals before the band returned to AV Happenings and &quot;messed around&quot; with them. When the album was almost finished the band enlisted the services of Tony Doogan who engineered sessions during which several vocal parts were recorded.

The ten song D-A-D-D-A-D concept was eventually abandoned with Pryce stating &quot;we don&#x27;t like constraining ourselves and if you&#x27;ve got a concept, you&#x27;re doing that. And we had some other really nice tunes so we just chose the best songs&quot;. According to Rhys the only plan the group stuck to was to make a &quot;more coherent&quot; record: &quot;In the past ... we&#x27;d put ideas kind of side by side, and on this record we wanted all those sounds to be more blended&quot;. Following arguments over the track listing of previous album &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, after a &quot;lot of songs&quot; were recorded necessitating four months worth of discussions about which tracks to leave off the record, the group recorded just 16 largely acoustic based songs during the sessions for &quot;Phantom Power&quot;. Rhys&#x27;s initial batch of songs were augmented by, among others, the Huw Bunford penned &quot;Sex, War &amp; Robots&quot;, the first time the guitarist had had one of his songs included on a Super Furry Animals album and also the first time he had sung lead vocals for the group, &quot;Slow Life&quot;, which grew out of an electronic piece of music keyboardist Cian Ciaran had been working on for several years and &quot;The Piccolo Snare&quot; which was partly written in the studio.

==Music==

After the more produced &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, which relied heavily on computers and electronics, the group were keen to make &quot;Phantom Power&quot; &quot;a little more human&quot; with guitarist Huw Bunford stating: &quot;with technology you can do anything these days, but sometimes less is more&quot;. Many songs on the album are acoustic based and bass player Guto Pryce has claimed that they sounded &quot;pretty good right from the start&quot; which also contributed to the decision to avoid &quot;over-tweak[ing] them in the studio&quot;. Despite this the group did work electronic loops into several tracks after Ciaran bought a large number of &quot;sound effect and light music&quot; vinyl records from a man who worked in the same building. According to Rhys: &quot;he knocked on the door just as we were beginning the album: &quot;hey, I&#x27;ve got these records to sell, are ya interested?&quot; And Cian went down to check them out and gave him a hundred pounds on the spot and carried 700 albums back to our tiny room&quot;.

The album showcases an eclectic range of sounds from the country rock of &quot;Sex, War &amp; Robots&quot;, featuring pedal steel guitar, to the heavy metal and punk of &quot;Out of Control&quot; and the glam rock of first single &quot;Golden Retriever&quot;. &quot;Slow Life&quot;, a track which singer Gruff Rhys has described as the &quot;most sonically impressive&quot; song on &quot;Phantom Power&quot;, features techno influences and is based on a piece of electronic music written by keyboardist Cian Ciaran several years earlier. Ciaran encouraged the band to jam on top of his original track to produce a fusion of techno and guitar-pop. &quot;The Undefeated&quot; is inspired by ska and reggae music, although the group removed a &quot;cheesy white reggae&quot; section from the song because it sounded &quot;fucking horrible&quot; and actively tried not to make it sound too much like a ska or reggae track as they felt they &quot;couldn&#x27;t pull it off&quot;. Many tracks feature close vocal harmonies, with all the band apart from Pryce contributing. These harmonies give the album a California / West Coast of America feel, with comparisons being drawn to the work of The Beach Boys, particularly on the song &quot;Venus and Serena&quot;.

==Lyrical themes==
Singer and chief lyric writer Gruff Rhys has claimed that &quot;Phantom Power&quot; is about &quot;broken relationships and war&quot; with &quot;a positive outlook to the future&quot;. As &quot;BBC News 24 addicts&quot; Rhys and the band absorbed &quot;fucked up war images&quot; from the Iraq War during the making of the album which affected the way songs were written: &quot;We seem to be living in such a heavy time. We&#x27;re just absorbing all the words thrown at us from the TV and regurgitating them back.&quot; Frustration with the George Bush administration and its foreign policy influenced the record with Rhys claiming that he feels qualified to address the subject as United States foreign policy &quot;effectively decides what the foreign policy is in the UK&quot;.

The two most overtly &quot;political&quot; tracks on &quot;Phantom Power&quot; are &quot;The Piccolo Snare&quot; and &quot;Liberty Belle&quot;. &quot;The Piccolo Snare&quot; is about &quot;societies torn apart by war and the waste of human life&quot;. The track uses the vocabulary of the Falklands War (Tumbledown, Skyhawks etc.) but Rhys claims it is applicable to any war. &quot;Liberty Belle&quot; tells the story of two cartoon characters devised by Rhys, &#x27;Liberty Belle&#x27; and &#x27;Memory Lane&#x27;, the former representing the &quot;bells of freedom&quot;, specifically the American Dream, and the latter representing &quot;history&#x27;s harsh lessons&quot; which Liberty Belle has failed to learn. The song is told from the perspective of a &quot;bird living almost in a parallel universe to humans, oblivious to the gravity of the games which are being played around us&quot;, something which Rhys admits to feeling himself much of the time. &quot;Venus and Serena&quot; uses a story of a child who talks to his pet tortoises, Venus and Serena, as he can&#x27;t communicate with his elders to make a similar point: that people feel alienated from their elected leaders. Both &quot;Out of Control&quot; and &quot;Slow Life&quot; feature regurgitated media buzzwords, with &quot;Out of Control&#x27;s&quot; &quot;flippant&quot; lyrics designed to create the feel of &quot;an over-dramatic theme to a current affairs programme&quot;. &quot;Bleed Forever&quot; deals specifically with the nuclear fallout from the Chernobyl disaster which fell over North Wales, allegedly causing an increase in incidents of leukaemia among children in the area.

However, Rhys has been keen to point out that the record is not a forcefully political one, claiming that most of the band&#x27;s songs are &quot;fragments of daily life; occasionally politics are a part of that. Super Furry Animals is about exploration, not political campaigning&quot;. &quot;Valet Parking&quot;, for example, is a song about &quot;the glories of pan-European travel&quot;, documenting a road trip from Cardiff to Vilnius, &quot;Golden Retriever&quot; is about &quot;the relationship between [Gruff Rhys&#x27;s] girlfriend&#x27;s two dogs - a male and a female&quot; and &quot;The Undefeated&quot;, inspired by a poor run of results for the Welsh football team, is about &quot;underdogs and overdogs&quot;.

==DVD==

The DVD of &quot;Phantom Power&quot; contains the 14 songs featured on the CD version of the album in surround sound, 16 remixes, commentary by Mario Caldato Jr. who mixed the record and provided one of the remixes, and song lyrics.

According to singer Gruff Rhys, the concept behind the DVD was based on the success of platform games: the listener can play the album as if it were a game and spend &quot;months ... instead of weeks&quot; exploring the content. Unlike the DVD version of previous album &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, which featured videos for every track, the songs on the DVD are accompanied by slowly moving animations. Rhys has stated that the Super Furry Animals wanted to use &quot;really bland images&quot; as viewers began to place too much emphasis on the videos on &quot;Rings Around the World&quot; and the band wanted them to concentrate on the music.

Keyboardist Cian Ciaran stated at the time of &quot;Phantom Power&#x27;s&quot; release that the band would issue a DVD with every future album, claiming that &quot;this is just the way we make records now&quot;. However, the band&#x27;s next two albums, &quot;Love Kraft&quot; and &quot;Hey Venus!&quot;, were not made available on DVD and, in a 2008 interview with &quot;Uncut&quot;, Rhys suggested that the release had been something of a failure: &quot;no one gave a shit because people just want to rock n&#x27; roll!&quot;

The remixes on the DVD version of &quot;Phantom Power&quot; vary from radical reworkings such as Killa Kella&#x27;s beatbox treatment of &quot;Golden Retriever&quot; and Wauvenfold&#x27;s &quot;unrecognisable&quot; version of &quot;Sex, War and Robots&quot;, to the likes of Mario Caldato Jr&#x27;s take on &quot;Liberty Belle&quot; and High Llamas&#x27; &quot;Valet Parking&quot; which are merely &quot;spruced up&quot;. The majority of the remixes were reissued on CD as the album &quot;Phantom Phorce&quot; in 2004. According to drummer Dafydd Ieuan the band didn&#x27;t have the money to pay the artists involved for their remix work so, in order to provide them with royalties, promised to release an album featuring the tracks on their own label, Placid Casual.

Hidden footage of the band firing machine guns can be reached by selecting the song &quot;The Undefeated&quot;, waiting 22 seconds until the lettering starts to blink and pressing &#x27;Enter&#x27; (&#x27;Enter&#x27; must be pressed before the lettering blinks for a second time at 24 seconds). Guitarist Huw Bunford has described this footage as being &quot;exactly how it looked on the tin ... noisy, full of testosterone, with pumped up guys in the woods trying to kill furry animals!&quot;

==Release==

&quot;Phantom Power&quot; was released on CD, vinyl and DVD on 21 July 2003 in the United Kingdom on Sony&#x27;s Epic imprint. The album reached #4 in the UK Albums Chart. In America the album was released on 22 July 2003 by Beggars Banquet US. &quot;Phantom Power&quot; was released on 21 July 2003 in Japan with two additional tracks, &quot;Summer Snow&quot; and &quot;Blue Fruit&quot;, added after &quot;Slow Life&quot; at the end of the album. &quot;Golden Retriever&quot; was released as the first single from the album, reaching #13 in the UK Singles Chart, followed by &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot; in October 2003 which peaked at #31. The &quot;Slow Life&quot; EP was released as a free download from the website of the band&#x27;s record label, Placid Casual, on 12 April 2004, featuring the title track, &quot;Lost Control&quot; (a remix of &quot;Out of Control&quot;), and the Goldie Lookin Chain collaboration, &quot;Motherfokker&quot;. The majority of the remixes from the DVD version of &quot;Phantom Power&quot; were released as &quot;Phantom Phorce&quot; on Placid Casual on 19 April 2004. Initial copies of this album came bundled with a CD version of the &quot;Slow Life&quot; EP. &quot;Phantom Power&quot; has been certified silver in the United Kingdom, denoting sales of more than 60,000 copies.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Phantom Power&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics with a score of 87 on Metacritic, denoting &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; described the album as &quot;another fine, esoteric wonder of an LP&quot;, while the &quot;NME&quot; claimed it is the group&#x27;s &quot;most focussed, energetic pop record since &quot;Radiator&quot;&quot; and went on to state that &quot;for a band to be hitting such form six albums into a steady career is astonishing&quot;. &quot;Q&quot; called it &quot;the band&#x27;s best work to date, as accessible as it is inventive&quot;; &quot;The Times&quot; agreed, calling &quot;Phantom Power&quot; &quot;the Furries’ most satisfying album to date ... one to cherish.&quot; Several critics commented on the &quot;summery pop&quot; nature of the record with Tiny Mix Tapes likening the album to &quot;the sun shining through following a large and brooding thunderstorm&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; calling it &quot;mellow summer listening&quot; despite the &quot;grim view of the world&quot; expressed in Gruff Rhys&#x27;s lyrics. The &quot;NME&quot; found that &quot;Phantom Power&quot; compares favourably with the band&#x27;s previous release, &quot;Rings Around the World&quot;, losing some of that album&#x27;s mainstream polish. AllMusic agreed, expressing relief that the band had loosened up following &quot;Rings...&quot;, which the website described as &quot;often sounding constrained by its polished widescreen aspirations&quot;. Irish website entertainment.ie saw &quot;Phantom Power&quot; as &quot;a highly polished affair, filled with the widescreen classic pop that Gruff Rhys and co. carry off so effortlessly ... thankfully free of the techno experiments that marred so much of their previous work&quot;.

There was some criticism of the album with &quot;The Guardian&quot; accusing the band of &quot;treading water&quot;, the album suffering from overfamiliarity as the group&#x27;s sixth release despite being a &quot;lovely record&quot;. &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; expressed similar views, claiming that &quot;Phantom Power&quot; &quot;feels very much like business as usual for the Welsh wizards, as if they&#x27;ve made just another album&quot;. In a 2008 interview with &quot;Uncut&quot; Rhys described &quot;Phantom Power&quot; as his favourite Super Furries album, although he conceded that all the band&#x27;s records &quot;have their moments&quot;.

<doc id="665823" wikidata="Q44449" url="?curid=665823" title="Randy Orton">
<text>Randal Keith Orton (born April 1, 1980) is an American professional wrestler. He is signed to WWE, where he performs on the &quot;SmackDown&quot; brand. Orton is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, and has the tied-third most world championship reigns in history, with a career spanning over 20 years.

Orton is a third-generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Bob Orton, father Bob Orton Jr., and uncle Barry Orton were all wrestlers. Before being signed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), he trained in and wrestled for the Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association and Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling. He was then signed by the WWF and was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW), where he held the OVW Hardcore Championship twice. He became a member of the stable Evolution shortly after his WWE debut, which quickly led to an Intercontinental Championship reign, his first championship with the company. He also acquired the moniker &quot;The Legend Killer&quot; during a storyline where he began disrespecting and then physically attacking WWE Hall of Famers and wrestling veterans.

At the age of 24, Orton became the youngest world champion in WWE history after he won the World Heavyweight Championship. With this win, he was kicked from Evolution and a feud with his former stablemates began. In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO. Together, they held the World Tag Team Championship. After Rated-RKO disbanded in mid-2007, Orton gained two WWE Championship reigns in one night, becoming the second youngest two-time WWE Champion at the age of 27. In 2008, he formed The Legacy with Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase Jr., and served as its leader until the group&#x27;s disbandment in 2010. Orton was the winner of the 2013 Money in the Bank ladder match, and after successfully cashing his contract in, he aligned with The Authority until 2015, during which he was named the &quot;face of the WWE&quot;. In 2016, he joined The Wyatt Family, winning the SmackDown Tag Team Championship with Bray Wyatt and Luke Harper before turning on them in 2017. He won his first United States Championship in 2018, becoming the 18th overall Grand Slam Champion after already having been the 17th Triple Crown Champion.

Orton&#x27;s rivalry with John Cena is one of the longest rivalries in WWE history and ranked among its greatest. Orton has held the WWE Championship 10 times and WWE&#x27;s World Heavyweight Championship four times. He was the final holder of the World Heavyweight Championship, which he unified with the WWE Championship to become the WWE World Heavyweight Champion at in 2013. Orton is recognized by WWE as having the third-most world championship victories in history at 14, behind John Cena and Ric Flair (both 16) and tied with Triple H (also 14). All totaled, he has won 20 championships in WWE.

Orton is also a two-time Royal Rumble match winner (2009 and 2017) and has headlined multiple WWE pay-per-view events, including WrestleMania 25 and WrestleMania XXX. Following his match at the 2021 Survivor Series, he broke Kane&#x27;s record for wrestling the most PPV matches in WWE history.

== Early life ==
Randal Keith Orton was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, on April 1, 1980, to nurse Elaine and professional wrestler Bob Orton Jr. He is a grandson of Bob Orton and nephew of Barry Orton, both professional wrestlers. He has a younger brother named Nathan, who is a stand-up comedian, and a younger sister named Rebecca. Knowing the hardships of life as a professional wrestler, his parents tried to convince him to stay away from the business and his father warned him that life in the ring meant a life on the road and away from family.

Orton attended Hazelwood Central High School, where he was an amateur wrestler. After graduating in 1998, he enlisted with the United States Marine Corps. At the base, he received a bad conduct discharge in 1999 after going AWOL on two occasions and disobeying an order from a commanding officer. Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, he was tried and convicted under a special court-martial, subsequently spending 38 days in the brig at Camp Pendleton. He previously had a Marine tattoo on his left arm, but covered it up after receiving his bad conduct discharge.

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== Training and early career (2000–2001) ===
Orton made his wrestling debut in 2000 at the Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling (MMWA-SICW) in St. Louis, Missouri, an offshoot of the historic St. Louis Wrestling Club headed by Sam Muchnick. There, he was trained by both the staff of the promotion and his father, Bob Orton Jr. He wrestled for the promotion where he performed with wrestlers such as Ace Strange and Mark Bland. Orton also refereed a few matches with World Organized Wrestling (WOW), a promotion where his uncle Barry Orton worked.

=== World Wrestling Federation / World Wrestling Entertainment / WWE (2000–present) ===
==== Ohio Valley Wrestling (2000–2002) ====
In 2000, Orton signed a deal with the then World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and was sent to its developmental territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training. During his time in OVW, he wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed with Bobby Eaton during a tag team title tournament. He won the OVW Hardcore Championship twice by defeating Mr. Black on February 14, 2001, and Flash Flanagan on May 5, 2001, respectively. On several occasions he faced Rico Constantino on combined WWF/OVW events, and also lost to The Prototype (John Cena) in a tag match on July 28 in Jacksonville, Indiana. He also began appearing on several WWF house shows that were unaffiliated with OVW, the first being on May 1, 2001, when he faced Billy Gunn. After taking the mic and promising to beat Gunn, Orton was defeated. That fall he began appearing regularly on WWF house shows and dark matches, facing Chuck Palumbo, Steven Richards and Shawn Stasiak, but mostly wrestling in tag team matches. Orton&#x27;s promotion to the main roster made him a member of OVW&#x27;s now legendary Class of 2002 as part of what has now been dubbed as the &quot;OVW 4&quot; alongside the aforementioned Cena as well as Brock Lesnar and Dave Batista. In his farewell match in OVW, Orton was defeated by The prototype (Cena).

==== Main roster debut; Evolution (2002–2004) ====
One of Orton&#x27;s first official WWF appearances was March 16, 2002, at WrestleMania X8&#x27;s Fan Axxess, where he was defeated by Tommy Dreamer. Orton&#x27;s first televised WWF match was a victory against Hardcore Holly on &quot;SmackDown!&quot; on April 25, 2002. Soon after, Orton became a face and was placed in a rivalry with Holly. In September 2002, Orton was traded to the Raw brand, where he defeated Stevie Richards in his debut on the show. Within weeks of his debut on the Raw brand, Orton suffered a shoulder injury, leaving him sidelined for months. While recovering, Orton still appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; in his own &quot;Randy News Network&quot; (&quot;RNN&quot;) segment, a weekly vignette featuring him talking about his condition. The show interrupted other segments of Raw programming, which caused Orton to slowly transition himself into a narcissistic and self-centered heel.

After his injury healed, Orton joined the Evolution stable, which consisted of Ric Flair, Triple H, and relative newcomer Batista. He was injured once again in February 2003, and returned on 26 May 2003 as a masked man, interfering in a 2-1 Handicap match between Kevin Nash and Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H. He then proceeded unmasked himself and re-joined the stable. The group was pushed on &quot;Raw&quot; from 2003 to 2004, with the height of their dominance occurring after Armageddon in 2003 when all of the men&#x27;s titles on &quot;Raw&quot; were held by Evolution members. In 2003, Orton spent much of his time helping Triple H overcome challenges for the World Heavyweight Championship. He joined Triple H in an Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam on August 24, involved primarily to secure Triple H&#x27;s title defense, and was eliminated by Goldberg, but the stable managed to fulfill its purpose and Triple H went on to eliminate Goldberg and retain his title.

Orton then began proclaiming himself the &quot;Legend Killer&quot;, with his gimmick becoming that of a young upstart who was so talented that he touted himself as the future of wrestling. He embarked on numerous feuds with older, well-respected names in wrestling and gained infamy for blatantly disrespecting them. With the help of his stablemate and mentor Ric Flair, Orton defeated Shawn Michaels at Unforgiven on September 21 in the first of many high-profile matches billed as &quot;Legend vs. Legend Killer&quot;. During this time, Orton began using the move that would become his signature finisher, the &quot;RKO&quot;, a jumping cutter named after his initials. He defeated Rob Van Dam for the Intercontinental Championship at Armageddon on December 14. With this win, Orton started the longest Intercontinental Championship reign in seven years, holding the title for 210 days. Orton continued to establish himself as a &quot;Legend Killer&quot; throughout 2004, challenging the semi-retired wrestler Mick Foley. Famed for his brutal hardcore matches and ability to handle excruciating pain, Foley challenged Orton to a hardcore &quot;Legend vs. Legend Killer&quot; match for his Intercontinental Championship, which Orton reluctantly accepted. At Backlash on April 18, Orton defeated Foley in a hardcore match to retain the Intercontinental Championship, which included spots involving a table covered in barbed wire, fire, a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire (a signature weapon of Foley&#x27;s named &quot;Barbie&quot;), and Orton being thrown onto hundreds of thumbtacks. Orton later spat in the face of Harley Race on the April 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. Two months later at Bad Blood on June 13, he retained the Intercontinental Championship against Shelton Benjamin. On July 11 at Vengeance, he lost the title to Edge.

==== World Heavyweight Champion (2004–2005) ====

After losing the Intercontinental Championship, Orton became the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship after winning a 20-man battle royal on the July 26 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At SummerSlam on August 15, Orton defeated Chris Benoit to win the World Heavyweight Championship, thus becoming the youngest world champion in WWE history at the age of 24. Benoit congratulated Orton after the match, shaking his hand for showing the ability to &quot;be a man&quot;. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, after Orton successfully defended the title against Benoit in a rematch, Evolution threw Orton a celebration only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton propped on his shoulders in elation, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs-up and then abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down, which was followed by Batista dropping Orton to the mat. Triple H, Flair and Batista attacked Orton in the ring, resulting in Orton being kicked out of Evolution. The following week, he called out Orton and ordered him to hand over the championship, but he refused, spitting in Triple H&#x27;s face and hitting him with the title belt. Orton&#x27;s breakup with Evolution led to him turning face when he continued to feud with his former stablemates. A month later, Orton lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Triple H at Unforgiven on September 12 after interference from Flair, Batista, and Jonathan Coachman.

Seeking revenge, Orton lashed out at his former Evolution members, catching them by surprise during a show by giving them a large cake as a make-up gift, which he came out of nowhere to beat and humiliate the group. At Taboo Tuesday on October 19, Orton defeated Ric Flair in a fan-voted steel cage match. After this, Orton experienced another push, becoming general manager of the Raw brand for a week following a match stipulation at Survivor Series on November 14 where he picked up the win for his team by last eliminating Triple H in a four-on-four Survivor Series elimination match. He continued to feud with Triple H, using his authority to place his opponents at severe disadvantages during title defenses. On January 9, 2005 at New Year&#x27;s Revolution, Orton participated in an Elimination Chamber match for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship, where he was the last man eliminated by Triple H after interference from Ric Flair and Batista. On the January 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton defeated Batista to earn a match against Triple H at the Royal Rumble on January 30 for the World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost.

==== Feud with The Undertaker (2005–2006) ====
Orton began an on-screen relationship with Stacy Keibler and briefly feuded with Christian in February 2005. On the February 28 &quot;Raw&quot;, Superstar Billy Graham made an appearance, in which he advised Orton to &quot;go where no wrestler [had] gone before&quot;.
Orton then produced a copy of SmackDown! magazine, which featured The Undertaker on the cover. Heeding Graham&#x27;s advice, Orton said he would set himself apart from all other wrestlers by ending The Undertaker&#x27;s undefeated streak at WrestleMania. Throughout March 2005, Orton taunted The Undertaker, claiming he was unafraid of him. On the March 21 &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton delivered an &quot;RKO&quot; to his unsuspecting on-screen girlfriend, Stacy Keibler, knocking her unconscious, thus turning heel once again. During Orton&#x27;s promos, he ran for cover whenever signs of The Undertaker&#x27;s appearance (lightning, darkness, or smoke) occurred. When wrestler Jake Roberts advised Orton not to underestimate The Undertaker, Orton performed an RKO on Roberts as well. In the weeks leading up to WrestleMania, Orton became more defiant and unafraid of The Undertaker, taunting and assaulting him in the ring following distractions from his father, &quot;Cowboy&quot; Bob Orton. At WrestleMania 21, Orton lost the heavily hyped match. WWE offered Orton to end the streak but he refused out of respect to Undertaker and because he thought he wasn&#x27;t the right person to break it.
The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton faced Batista, who had become World Heavyweight Champion. Orton stated on-screen that his match with The Undertaker had aggravated a shoulder injury. While sidelined, Orton appeared on &quot;Raw&quot; and claimed that he was ineligible for the WWE Draft Lottery due to his injury. He was informed by WWE Chairman Vince McMahon that he was indeed a candidate for the draft, leaving a possibility of a return to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Orton returned to WWE programming for SmackDown! on June 16, announcing that he was the second pick in the 2005 draft lottery. He rekindled his feud with The Undertaker, defeating him at SummerSlam following a distraction from his father. Two months later at No Mercy, Orton and his father Bob Orton defeated The Undertaker in a handicap casket match and after the match, Randy Orton and his father Bob locked the Undertaker in the casket and, in a move similar to Kane at the 1998 Royal Rumble, chopped holes in the top of the casket with an axe, poured gasoline over the casket and set it ablaze, kayfabe killing The Undertaker. The following month, Orton replaced the late Eddie Guerrero as a participant in the annual elimination match of Team SmackDown! against Team Raw at Survivor Series, after having lost a qualifying match to Rey Mysterio. In the match, Orton was the last remaining wrestler in the match for the third straight year, as he pinned Shawn Michaels to get the victory for Team SmackDown!. After the match, The Undertaker returned by emerging from a flaming casket and attacked the SmackDown! superstars who came to the ring to celebrate Team SmackDown!&#x27;s victory. On the &quot;SmackDown!&quot; episode after Survivor Series, The Undertaker interfered in a match between Rey Mysterio and Big Show after Kane interfered. Randy Orton RKO&#x27;d the Undertaker, he then struck the Undertaker with a tire iron and set him on the back of the lowrider Mysterio had driven to the ring, he then reversed the lowrider into the SmackDown! set, causing an explosion. The feud was finally settled with a Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon. On the December 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, The Undertaker entered the ring to deliver a promo while one of his druids appeared to be standing in the ring. The Undertaker sustained an RKO from Orton in a surprise attack. The druid revealed himself to be Orton&#x27;s father, who gave Orton The Undertaker&#x27;s urn, which according to the storyline allowed whoever held it to control The Undertaker. The Undertaker, however, beat Orton in the Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon, ending their nine-month-long feud.

==== Rated-RKO (2006–2007) ====

After Armageddon, Orton entered the 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, but he was eliminated by the eventual winner of the match Rey Mysterio, who earned a world championship at WrestleMania 22. Orton challenged him to a match for his title shot at No Way Out. In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio&#x27;s friend who had died a few months previously, in an attempt to gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero&#x27;s death in November 2005. Orton defeated Mysterio at No Way Out, earning Mysterio&#x27;s title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio and then-champion Kurt Angle. On April 2 at WrestleMania, however, Orton lost after he was pinned by Mysterio. On the following episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Orton challenged Mysterio for the World Heavyweight Championship, but failed to win the title.

On April 4, Orton was suspended for sixty days for &quot;unprofessional conduct&quot;. In an interview, Orton stated, &quot;my conduct was unbecoming of a champion, which is what I will be again when I return&quot;. To cover for the suspension, a scripted injury was devised, where Kurt Angle broke Orton&#x27;s ankle during a King of the Ring quarterfinal match. Orton returned from his suspension in June to the Raw brand, where he entered a rivalry with Angle, culminating in matches at ECW One Night Stand (which he lost) and Vengeance (which he won) before engaging in a storyline feud with Hulk Hogan. Orton began cutting promos insulting the aging Hogan and flirted with Hogan&#x27;s then-eighteen-year-old daughter Brooke. At SummerSlam, the two met in a &quot;Legend vs. Legend Killer&quot; match, which Hogan won. He later defeated Carlito, at Unforgiven the following month.
After the newly reformed D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) cost Edge the WWE Championship, Edge approached Orton and asked him to join forces to defeat the team. Orton, whose championship reign had been ended by Triple H in 2004, agreed, forming the tag team Rated-RKO. The two defeated DX at Cyber Sunday with help from special guest referee Eric Bischoff, becoming the first team to defeat DX since their reunion in June and they quickly dominated the Raw brand&#x27;s tag team division to become World Tag Team Champions by defeating Ric Flair and Roddy Piper on the November 13 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. As part of the angle, Rated-RKO attacked Ric Flair with steel chairs to enrage DX on the November 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. At New Year&#x27;s Revolution, Rated-RKO defended the World Tag Team Championship against DX, but the match was declared a no-contest when Triple H suffered a legitimate injury during the match. Afterwards, Rated-RKO were attacked by DX. With Triple H out of action, Rated-RKO continued their on-screen rivalry with Michaels. At the Royal Rumble, both men competed in the eponymous match and made it to the final four, but both were eliminated by Michaels. Michaels later teamed with WWE Champion John Cena to defeat Rated-RKO to win the World Tag Team Championship the following night on &quot;Raw&quot;. After losing the tag team titles, both Edge and Orton focused on the WWE Championship, causing friction between them. On the February 5, 2007, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, they lost a triple threat match against Michaels to earn a WWE Championship match at WrestleMania 23. They both competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania, but the match was won by Mr. Kennedy. On the April 9 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton and Michaels wrestled to a no contest in a number one contender&#x27;s match for the WWE Championship after both men&#x27;s shoulders were down during the pinfall. Finally, Orton and Edge faced off in a fatal four-way match for the title against Cena and Michaels at Backlash, however Cena retained the title after pinning Orton. On the April 30 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, they competed against each other in a singles match, which Edge won. Their alliance was effectively ended once Edge joined the SmackDown! brand. Orton then continued his &quot;Legend Killer&quot; persona, attacking Shawn Michaels by using frequent attacks to the head, including an elevated DDT and a running punt to the face. Orton defeated Michaels at Judgment Day via knockout when Michaels suffered a kayfabe concussion and collapsed during the match. Orton continued his attacks when he engaged himself in feuds with Rob Van Dam at One Night Stand (after losing a stretcher match to Van Dam), Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, and Sgt. Slaughter. During this time the commentators noted how Orton slithered around and stalked his victims like a snake; this led to &quot;The Viper&quot; becoming a nickname for Orton.

==== WWE Champion (2007–2008) ====

On the July 23 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton was named number one contender for John Cena&#x27;s WWE Championship. Three times before their scheduled bout at SummerSlam, Orton assaulted Cena with the RKO. Orton lost the title match at SummerSlam when Cena pinned him after an &quot;FU&quot;. The next night on the August 27 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton demanded a rematch, but Raw General Manager William Regal denied him. He then appealed to Mr. McMahon, who offered him the shot if he &quot;proved himself&quot;. That night, Orton interfered in Cena&#x27;s match with King Booker, assaulting him before kicking his father, who was at ringside, in the head. McMahon granted Orton his rematch at Unforgiven, which he won by disqualification when Cena refused to stop punching him in the corner; however, Cena retained the championship because titles cannot change hands by disqualification. After the match, Cena&#x27;s father, who was again at ringside, kicked Orton in the head, which led to a match the next night on the September 17 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, in which Orton defeated Cena&#x27;s father by disqualification after Cody Rhodes interfered while Cena was handcuffed to the ropes. Cena suffered a legitimate injury during a match with Mr. Kennedy on the October 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after which Orton attacked Cena with an RKO. After this, he adopted the nickname of &quot;The Viper&quot;. Orton then threw him outside the ring, and gave him an RKO on the broadcast table. Due to this injury, John Cena was forced to vacate the WWE Championship.

At the start of No Mercy, Mr. McMahon awarded Orton the WWE Championship. Orton lost the title to Triple H in the opening match, but regained it later that night in a Last Man Standing match. Orton then restarted his feud with Shawn Michaels, who returned on the October 8 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; during Orton&#x27;s championship coronation and superkicked him. Michaels was chosen by fan voting over Jeff Hardy and Mr. Kennedy to meet Orton for the WWE Championship at Cyber Sunday, where Orton was disqualified after low blowing Michaels, but retained the title. They had a rematch at Survivor Series with a pre-match stipulation that if Michaels had used Sweet Chin Music, he would have lost and never had another chance at the title, while if Orton was disqualified, he would have lost the championship; Orton pinned Michaels at Survivor Series after an RKO to retain the title. Orton then began a feud with the returning Chris Jericho, who challenged Orton for the WWE Championship at Armageddon, in which Jericho won by disqualification after interference from SmackDown! color commentator John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL), but Orton retained the title. He then feuded with Jeff Hardy, during which he punted Hardy&#x27;s brother Matt in the head and Hardy performed a Swanton Bomb off the Raw set onto Orton. He successfully defended the title against Hardy at the Royal Rumble. He then restarted his feud with John Cena, who had returned from injury to win the 2008 Royal Rumble match. Instead of taking his title shot at WrestleMania XXIV, as Royal Rumble winners typically do, Cena took it at No Way Out and defeated Orton, who intentionally got himself disqualified by slapping the referee to retain the title. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Cena defeated Orton in a non-title match with Triple H as the special guest referee, resulting in Cena being added to Orton&#x27;s title match with Triple H at WrestleMania, making it a triple threat match. At WrestleMania, Orton retained the WWE Championship against Cena and Triple H by pinning Cena after Triple H executed a Pedigree on him. The next month at Backlash, Orton lost the title to Triple H in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Cena and John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield (JBL). After failing to win it back at Judgment Day in a steel cage match, he faced Triple H for the title once more in a Last Man Standing match at One Night Stand, which he lost after Triple H countered an &quot;RKO&quot; by throwing Orton over the top rope, legitimately breaking his collarbone and putting him out of action. During this time, he gained a new entrance theme, &quot;Voices&quot;, performed by the band Rev Theory.

==== The Legacy (2008–2010) ====

Upon being medically cleared to return to the ring, Orton was reinjured in a motorcycle accident. He returned to &quot;Raw&quot; on September 1, criticizing all the champions, including World Tag Team Champions Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase, who he berated and slapped for letting Cryme Tyme steal their belts. This inspired them to try to gain Orton&#x27;s respect. They achieved this at Unforgiven when, with new stablemate Manu, they assaulted World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk, forcing him to vacate his title before his scheduled defense that night. Orton returned to in-ring action on the November 3 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, losing to Punk by disqualification when DiBiase interfered, resulting in Orton punting DiBiase in the head in retaliation. At Survivor Series, Team Orton, which included Rhodes, defeated Team Batista with both Orton and Rhodes surviving as the sole survivors. On the December 1 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton proposed that he, Rhodes and Manu form an alliance. The stable, called &quot;The Legacy&quot;, debuted the next week, defeating Batista and Triple H, Orton&#x27;s former Evolution stablemates, in a three-on-two handicap match. At Armageddon, Orton lost to Batista in a singles match.
Orton began feuding with the McMahon family on the January 19, 2009, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; when he confronted both Mr. McMahon and Stephanie, claiming that he was worth more than her, and that she had become &quot;worthless&quot;. This infuriated Mr. McMahon, who demanded that Orton apologize, or he&#x27;d terminate him on the spot. As Mr. McMahon was about to fire him, Orton attacked and punted him in the head, leading to him being carried out of the arena on a stretcher. On January 25, Orton won the Royal Rumble match, last eliminating Triple H. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton claimed that he suffered from IED, and that he was not responsible for his actions towards Mr. McMahon, claiming that he suffered a &quot;loss of control&quot; because of the disorder. He also claimed that WWE knew of the condition, but did nothing, and threatened to sue WWE for that reason, and also, if Stephanie were to fire him, threatened a second lawsuit for breach of contract, due to the fact that he was legally entitled to compete at WrestleMania because he won the Royal Rumble. Though Stephanie teased firing Orton, she changed her mind and said that she had &quot;bigger plans&quot;, leading to Shane McMahon returning to &quot;Raw&quot; and attacking Orton. This led to Orton facing Shane in a No Holds Barred match at No Way Out, which he won. The next night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton faced Shane again in an unsanctioned match, which ended in a no contest when he punted Shane in the head, thus rendering him unable to continue the match. Stephanie then ran down to the ring to tend to her brother, but Orton attacked her with an &quot;RKO&quot;. This drew Triple H into the feud, who claimed that Orton &quot;crossed the line&quot; when he attacked Stephanie, his real-life wife. Later, Orton claimed that everything he had done was part of a plan to get revenge on Triple H after he kicked him out of Evolution back in 2004; according to Orton, Triple H &quot;ruined his life&quot;, so Orton was going to do the same and take everything that Triple H cared about away from him. He challenged Triple H for the WWE Championship at WrestleMania 25, where he was unsuccessful. He won it the next month at Backlash by pinning Triple H in a six-man tag team match between The Legacy and Triple H, Batista and Shane McMahon. At Judgment Day, Orton defended the championship against Batista, where he retained via disqualification after Rhodes and DiBiase interfered. At Extreme Rules, he lost the title to Batista in a steel cage match. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton and Legacy attacked Batista and injured his arm, forcing him to vacate the title. On the June 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton regained the title in a fatal four-way match against Big Show, Triple H and John Cena. The following week, Orton defended the WWE Championship against Triple H in a Last Man Standing match, which ended in a no-contest after both men failed to answer the referee&#x27;s ten count. They faced off for the championship once more at The Bash in a Three Stages of Hell match, which Orton won after interference from Legacy. At SummerSlam, he defended the title against John Cena, during which he used several underhanded tactics to retain the championship. He lost the title to Cena in an &quot;I Quit&quot; match at Breaking Point, but regained it from Cena in a Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell. At Bragging Rights, Orton again lost the championship to Cena in a one-hour Iron Man match to end the feud.

Orton then began a rivalry with Kofi Kingston, whom Orton blamed for him losing the WWE Championship due to Kingston interfering in his match with Cena to chase away Rhodes and DiBiase. On the November 16 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton and Kingston engaged in a brawl that ended with Kingston putting Orton through a table in the crowd. Both men were named captains for their respective teams at Survivor Series, where Kingston&#x27;s team defeated Orton&#x27;s team after Orton was last eliminated by Kingston. The two traded victories over each on following episodes of &quot;Raw&quot;, leading to a match at on December 13, which Orton won. The next night, he competed in a tournament to crown the 2009 Superstar of the Year, defeating The Undertaker by countout in the first round after interference from Legacy to advance to the finals later that night, where he lost to Cena. Orton won a triple threat match on January 11, 2010, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, with help from Rhodes and DiBiase, for the right to challenge Sheamus at the Royal Rumble for the WWE Championship. Orton lost by disqualification when Rhodes interfered, which prompted Orton to attack both Rhodes and DiBiase after the match. On the February 15 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Orton was again disqualified in a non-title rematch when Legacy interfered. Orton and DiBiase both competed in the WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at Elimination Chamber, where DiBiase eliminated Orton after hitting him with a pipe Rhodes had given him. The next night on the February 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, during a six-man tag team match, Orton attacked them in retaliation, turning face for the first time since 2005. At WrestleMania XXVI, Orton defeated Rhodes and DiBiase in a triple threat match.

==== World Heavyweight Championship reigns (2010–2013) ====
After The Legacy disbanded, Orton spent most part of the year in World Title feuds. He unsuccessfully challenged Jack Swagger for the World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules in April. At Fatal 4-Way in June, Orton competed in a fatal four-way WWE Championship match involving champion Cena, Edge, and Sheamus, who won the title after interference from The Nexus. On July 18 at Money in the Bank, Orton competed in a Money in the Bank ladder match for a WWE Championship contract, which was won by The Miz and, at SummerSlam, he faced the WWE Champion Sheamus in a match that ended in a disqualification, giving Orton the win, but not the title. Immediately afterward, Orton hit Sheamus with the chair and an RKO onto the broadcast table.
At Night of Champions, Orton won the WWE Championship in a six-pack challenge elimination match. After successfully defending the title against Sheamus in a Hell in a Cell match at Hell in a Cell, he feuded with Wade Barrett, who was blackmailing Cena to help him capture the title. Orton retained the title against him at Bragging Rights and Survivor Series. However, on the November 22 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, after Orton defeated Barrett again in a title match, he lost the championship against The Miz when he cashed his Money in the Bank contract. Orton received his rematch against The Miz in a tables match at and the Royal Rumble, but he lost both matches.

The next month at Elimination Chamber, Orton failed to win a WWE Championship number one contender Elimination Chamber match after being eliminated by CM Punk.

At the event on August 31, Orton failed to win the title from Gunther, thus keeping him on the SmackDown brand.

== Professional wrestling style and persona ==

Orton&#x27;s most notable move is his finishing maneuver, the RKO, a jumping variation of a cutter. The name is a pun on his initials (Randal Keith Orton) with &quot;Randy-KO&quot;. He also previously used a punt kick, which saw him run up to an opponent on their hands and knees and kick them in the head; within a storyline, this usually caused a concussion or some other sort of severe head injury to his opponent, and was often used to write off the on-screen characters of wrestlers who were scheduled to take time off. However, the move was legitimately banned by WWE management in 2012 due to the ease of imitation by viewers and the risk of injury should the move be botched. The move was brought back in June 2020 as part of the feud between Orton and Edge where Orton used the Punt Kick to defeat Edge at Backlash. Orton would then start using the move regularly again.

During his initial years in WWE, Orton&#x27;s gimmick was that of &quot;the Legend Killer&quot;, a young and cocky talent who disrespected and usually defeated several legends. In late 2007, in the midst of his second WWE Championship reign, his character changed to a more unstable and treacherous personality. He then adopted the nicknames of &quot;the Viper&quot; and &quot;the Apex Predator&quot; due to his untrustworthy, snake-like character. He has said numerous times that he prefers playing the villain, as it is easier and more natural for him. In January 2008, Orton told &quot;411Mania&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s easy for me to go out there and be a prick on the show because it&#x27;s me times ten. And even though you probably don&#x27;t like me anyway, give me five minutes and I&#x27;ll make you not like me more. Being a heel is fun. It comes so natural.&quot;

== Acting career ==
A former Marine, Orton was set to star in the action film &quot;The Marine 2&quot; (2009), but was replaced by Ted DiBiase Jr. after injuring his collarbone. He had a supporting role as the father of a school bully in the comedy-drama film &quot;That&#x27;s What I Am&quot; (2011). He signed on to star in the action film &quot;The Marine 3: Homefront&quot; (2013), but was replaced by The Miz due to his checkered military career. He later starred in the action films &quot;12 Rounds 2: Reloaded&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Condemned 2&quot; (2015). He had a guest role as James Richards, a former Navy SEAL and leader of a militia group, in a December 2016 episode of the USA action series &quot;Shooter&quot;. He also had a supporting role in the comedy-drama film &quot;Changeland&quot; (2019).

== Other media ==
In 2004, Orton appeared on the talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; to promote Taboo Tuesday. In March 2007, he appeared alongside Edge, John Cena and Bobby Lashley on the game show &quot;Deal or No Deal&quot;. He was the cover athlete for the video game &quot;WWE &#x27;12&quot;.

In October 2014, he became a popular figure on Vine and the internet, when a trend began of clips of a superimposed Orton performing his signature &quot;RKO&quot; move on internet &quot;fail&quot; victims.

== Personal life ==
Orton married Samantha Speno on September 21, 2007, and they had a daughter together before separating in late 2012 and divorcing in June 2013. Orton married Kimberly Kessler, who was previously a member of his fan club, on November 14, 2015. They have a daughter together, who is Orton&#x27;s second child and Kessler&#x27;s fourth, and he is also the step-father of Kessler&#x27;s three sons from her previous marriage. They reside in St. Charles, Missouri.

Orton suffers from hypermobility in both of his shoulders, which has been the cause of nearly all of his most notable injuries throughout his career, sidelining him through incidents ranging from performing one of his signature taunts during a match to innocuous things such as taking out the trash at home.

During the Bash in Berlin preshow, Orton mentioned that he is &#x27;almost 70% German.&#x27;

== Controversies and legal issues ==
In March 2007, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; posted an article on its website as part of its continuing series investigating a steroid and growth hormone ring used by a number of professional athletes in several sports. The article mentioned several current and former WWE wrestlers, including Orton, who was alleged to have obtained nandrolone, oxandrolone, stanozolol, and testosterone, as well as ancillary drugs anastrozole and clomiphene citrate. WWE simply claimed that the allegations preceded their Talent Wellness Program, launched in February 2006.

In August 2018, Orton was investigated by WWE for sexual harassment when it was claimed that he had exposed himself to new members of the company&#x27;s writing staff during his early career, though nothing came of the investigation.

Also in 2018, Orton&#x27;s tattoo artist Catherine Alexander filed a lawsuit against Take-Two Interactive and 2K Games for their unapproved use of her copyrighted tattoos on his likeness in their &quot;WWE 2K&quot; video game series. She argued that the copying of the tattoos infringed on her rights as the licensed creator. Take-Two argued fair use; since there was a material dispute on that question the judge denied the company&#x27;s motion for summary judgement while granting Alexander&#x27;s motion for the same on the copying issue, leaving fair use the only issue to try. A trial was scheduled for September 2021, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial went ahead in October 2022, with the judge ruling in favor of Alexander and declaring that she was entitled to $3,750 in damages.

In October 2019, Orton received criticism for saying &quot;nigga&quot; while playing a &quot;Call of Duty&quot; game on a live Twitch stream.

<doc id="665824" wikidata="Q1151586" url="?curid=665824" title="Dhimmitude">
<text>Dhimmitude is a neologism characterizing the status of non-Muslims under Muslim rule, popularized by the Egyptian-born British writer Bat Ye&#x27;or in the 1980s and 1990s. It is constructed from the Arabic &quot;dhimmi&quot;, &quot;non-Muslim living in an Islamic state&quot;. Akbarzadeh and Roose suggest that Ye&#x27;or equates Dhimmitude with servitude.

Bat Ye’or defines it as a permanent status of subjection in which Jews and Christians have been held under Islamic rule since the eighth century, and that forces them to accept discrimination or &quot;face forced conversion, slavery or death&quot;. The term gained traction among Bosnian Serb forces during the Balkan wars in the 1990s and is popular among self-proclaimed counter-jihadi authors. Some scholars have dismissed it as polemical.

==Origin==
The term was coined in 1982 by the President of Lebanon, Bachir Gemayel, in reference to attempts by the country&#x27;s Muslim leadership to subordinate the native Lebanese Christian minority. In a speech of September 14, 1982 given at Dayr al-Salib in Lebanon, he said: &quot;Lebanon is our homeland and will remain a homeland for Christians... We want to continue to christen, to celebrate our rites and traditions, our faith and our creed whenever we wish... Henceforth, we refuse to live in any dhimmitude!&quot;

The concept of &quot;dhimmitude&quot; was introduced into Western discourse by the writer Bat Ye&#x27;or in a French-language article published in the Italian journal in 1983. In Bat Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s use, &quot;dhimmitude&quot; refers to allegations of non-Muslims appeasing and surrendering to Muslims and discrimination against non-Muslims in Muslim majority regions.

Ye&#x27;or further popularized the term in her books &quot;The Decline of Eastern Christianity&quot; and the 2003 followup &quot;Islam and Dhimmitude: Where Civilizations Collide&quot;. In a 2011 interview, she claimed to have indirectly inspired Gemayel&#x27;s use of the term.

==Associations and usage==
The associations of the word &quot;dhimmitude&quot; vary between users:
* Bat Ye&#x27;or defined dhimmitude as the condition and experience of those who are subject to &quot;dhimma&quot;, and thus not synonymous to, but rather a subset of the &quot;dhimma&quot; phenomenon: &quot;dhimmitude ... represents a behavior dictated by fear (terrorism), pacifism when aggressed, rather than resistance, servility because of cowardice and vulnerability. ... By their peaceful surrender to the Islamic army, they obtained the security for their life, belongings and religion, but they had to accept a condition of inferiority, spoliation and humiliation. As they were forbidden to possess weapons and give testimony against a Muslim, they were put in a position of vulnerability and humility.&quot; The term plays a key role in the Islamophobic conspiracy theory of Eurabia.
*Sidney H. Griffith states that it &quot;has come to express the theoretical, social condition&quot; of non-Muslims &quot;under Muslim rule&quot;.
* According to Bassam Tibi, &quot;dhimmitude&quot; refers to non-Muslims being &quot;allowed to retain their religious beliefs under certain restrictions&quot;. He describes that status as being inferior and a violation of religious freedom.
==Influence on Judaism==

This Islamizing innovation, one of many formative Arabic impacts on Jewish philosophy, regarding servitude, apparent also in his language had little earlier basis in Jewish laws regarding residents in Israel (ger toshav). Noah Felodman and David Novak note that it bears a close parallel with what Islamic law requires of dhimmis, non-Muslims desiring to live unconverted in Islamic countries: &quot;Maimonides here both borrows the Islamic legal model of subordinate status for tolerated peoples and turns it on its head by putting Jews on top and others below.&quot;

==Criticism==
Robert Irwin&#x27;s review stated that her book &quot;Islam and Dhimmitude&quot; confuses religious prescriptions with political expediency, is &quot;relentlessly and one-sided polemical&quot;, &quot;repetitive&quot;, &quot;muddled&quot;, and poorly documented in terms of the original languages. Her book stretches from massacres of Jews from Muhammad&#x27;s time to the poor press Israel receives in modern times. It is, he opined, a book even Israel&#x27;s keenest supporters can do without. It denounces Christians for failing to back Jewish resistance to Muslim repression. Irwin thinks that the author is rankled by the failure of Palestinian Christian Arabs to assist Israel against their Muslim neighbours. He states that her facts are accurate but devoid of context: many ordinances for times of crisis had to be continually renewed and quickly fell into disuse. Both Jews and Christians often flourished, Irwin notes, under Muslim rule, and the laws of shari&#x27;a were frequently flouted. He cites Bernard Lewis&#x27;s analysis of an anti-Jewish poem in terms of the envy of the writer for the fact Jews were doing rather well in the poet&#x27;s milieu at that time, a point that concluded: &quot;To the citizen of a liberal democracy, the status of &quot;dhimmi&quot; would no doubt be intolerable - but to many minorities in the world today, that status, with its autonomy and its limited yet recognized rights, might well seem enviable&quot;.

Sidney H. Griffith, a historian of early Eastern Christianity, dismissed Bat Ye&#x27;or&#x27;s &quot;dhimmitude&quot; as &quot;polemical&quot; and &quot;lacking in historical method&quot;, while Michael Sells, a scholar of Islamic history and literature, describes the &quot;dhimmitude&quot; theory as nothing more than the &quot;falsification&quot; of history by an &quot;ideologue&quot;.

Mark R. Cohen, a leading scholar of the history of Jewish communities of medieval Islam, has criticized the term as misleading and Islamophobic.

<doc id="665829" wikidata="Q3640986" url="?curid=665829" title="First-degree atrioventricular block">
<text>First-degree atrioventricular block (AV block) is a disease of the electrical conduction system of the heart in which electrical impulses conduct from the cardiac atria to the ventricles through the atrioventricular node (AV node) more slowly than normal. First degree AV block does not generally cause any symptoms, but may progress to more severe forms of heart block such as second- and third-degree atrioventricular block. It is diagnosed using an electrocardiogram, and is defined as a PR interval greater than 200 milliseconds. First degree AV block affects 0.65-1.1% of the population with 0.13 new cases per 1000 persons each year.

== Causes ==

The most common causes of first-degree heart block are AV nodal disease, enhanced vagal tone (for example in athletes), myocarditis, acute myocardial infarction (especially acute inferior MI), electrolyte disturbances and medication. The medications that most commonly cause first-degree heart block are those that increase the refractory time of the AV node, thereby slowing AV conduction. These include calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, cardiac glycosides, and anything that increases cholinergic activity such as cholinesterase inhibitors.

== Diagnosis ==

In normal individuals, the AV node slows the conduction of electrical impulses through the heart. This is manifest on a surface electrocardiogram (ECG) as the PR interval. The normal PR interval is from 120 ms to 200 ms in length. This is measured from the initial deflection of the P wave to the beginning of the QRS complex.

In first-degree heart block, the AV node conducts the electrical activity more slowly. This is seen as a PR interval greater than 200 ms in length on the surface ECG. It is usually an incidental finding on a routine ECG.

First-degree heart block does not require any particular investigations except for electrolyte and drug screens, especially if an overdose is suspected.

In comparison to second-degree atrioventricular block, in first-degree block there is an absence of non-conduction or &quot;dropped beats.&quot;

In an electrophysiology study, this corresponds to a prolonged A-H interval that shows the time between atrial depolarization and His bundle depolarization near the AV node.

== Treatment ==

The management includes identifying and correcting electrolyte imbalances and withholding any offending medications. This condition does not require admission unless there is an associated myocardial infarction. Even though it usually does not progress to higher forms of heart block, it may require outpatient follow-up and monitoring of the ECG, especially if there is a comorbid bundle branch block. If there is a need for treatment of an unrelated condition, care should be taken not to introduce any medication that may slow AV conduction. If this is not feasible, clinicians should be very cautious when introducing any drug that may slow conduction; and regular monitoring of the ECG is indicated.

== Prognosis ==

Isolated first-degree heart block has no direct clinical consequences. There are no symptoms or signs associated with it. It was originally thought of as having a benign prognosis. In the Framingham Heart Study, however, the presence of a prolonged PR interval or first degree AV block doubled the risk of developing atrial fibrillation, tripled the risk of requiring an artificial pacemaker, and was associated with a small increase in mortality. This risk was proportional to the degree of PR prolongation.

A subset of individuals with the triad of first-degree heart block, right bundle branch block, and either left anterior fascicular block or left posterior fascicular block (known as trifascicular block) may be at an increased risk of progression to complete heart block.

== FAA controversy ==
In October 2022 the FAA quietly changed the medical policy in their Guide for Aviation Medical Examiners to define a first-degree AV block as a PR interval greater than 300ms. This was considered controversial in part because accepted guidelines for the PR interval remain unchanged at 200ms, and in part because at the time there was no explanation of why the FAA required the change. The FAA has subsequently provided a statement explaining its reasoning.

<doc id="665830" wikidata="Q2526084" url="?curid=665830" title="Ultra-royalist">
<text>The Ultra-royalists (, collectively Ultras) were a French political faction from 1815 to 1830 under the Bourbon Restoration. An Ultra was usually a member of the nobility of high society who strongly supported Roman Catholicism as the state and only legal religion of France, the Bourbon monarchy, traditional hierarchy between classes and census suffrage (privileged voting rights), while rejecting the political philosophy of popular will and the interests of the bourgeoisie along with their liberal and democratic tendencies.

The Legitimists, another of the main right-wing factions identified in René Rémond&#x27;s &quot;Les Droites en France&quot;, were disparagingly classified with the Ultras after the 1830 July Revolution by the victors, the Orléanists, who deposed the Bourbon dynasty for the more liberal king Louis Philippe.

== Second White Terror ==

Following the return of Louis XVIII to power in 1815, people suspected of having ties with the governments of the French Revolution or of Napoleon suffered arrest. Several hundred were killed by angry mobs or executed after an informal summary court-martial. The episodes happened primarily in the south of France.

Historian John Baptist Wolf argues Ultra-royalists—many of whom had just returned from exile—were staging a counter-revolution against the French Revolution and also against Napoleon&#x27;s revolution.
:Throughout the Midi — in Provence, Avignon, Languedoc, and many other places — the White Terror raged with unrelenting ferocity. The royalists found in the willingness of the French to desert the king fresh proof of their theory that the nation was honeycombed with traitors, and used every means to seek out and destroy their enemies. The government was powerless or unwilling to intervene.

== Bourbon Restoration ==

Inaugurating the Bourbon Restoration (1814–1830), a strongly restricted census suffrage elected to the Chamber of Deputies an Ultra-royalist majority (&quot;la Chambre introuvable&quot;) in 1815–1816 and again from 1824 to 1827. Known to be &quot;more royalist than the king&quot; (&quot;plus royalistes que le roi&quot;), the Ultras were the dominant political faction under Louis XVIII (1815–1824) and Charles X (1824–1830). Opposed to the limitation of the sovereign&#x27;s power under the constitutional monarchy, they hoped to restore the Ancien Régime and annul the rupture created by the French Revolution. Passionately espousing the ruling ideology of the Restoration, the Ultras opposed liberalism, republicanism and democracy. While Louis XVIII hoped for a moderate restoration of the Ancien Régime, acceptable to the masses who had participated in the Revolution, the Ultras held rigidly to the dream of an integral restoration. Their power was due in part to electoral laws which largely favored them: on one hand a Chamber of Peers composed of hereditary members and on the other hand a Chamber of Deputies elected under a heavily restricted census suffrage of approximately 100,000 voters.
In 1815, an Ultra majority was elected to the chamber of deputies. Louis XVIII dubbed them &quot;La Chambre Introuvable&quot;, &quot;the unfindable chamber&quot;, due to his astonishment at a group of deputies more royalist than himself. Under the guidance of his chief minister the Armand-Emmenuel de Vignerot du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu, Louis XVIII finally decided to dissolve this turbulent assembly, invoking Article 14 of the Constitutional Charter. There followed a &quot;Liberal Interlude&quot; from 1816–1820, a period of &quot;wilderness years&quot; for the Ultras. Then on 13February 1820, the Duke of Berry was stabbed by a republican assassin as he left the Paris Opera House with his wife and died the next day. This outrage strengthened the Ultras, who then introduced laws such as the which allowed them to further dominate the Chamber of Deputies. In addition to other factors, Louis XVIII&#x27;s health was in serious decline, reducing his resistance to Ultra demands: even before he came to the throne, the Comte d&#x27;Artois (Charles X) already dominated the government.

The 1824 death of Louis XVIII, whom they saw as too moderate, lifted the spirits of the Ultras: they expected their leader, the new king Charles X, would soon become an absolute monarch, answerable only to God. In January 1825, Villèle&#x27;s government enacted the Anti-Sacrilege Act, instituting capital punishment for the theft of sacred monstrance vases (with or without consecrated hosts). This &quot;anachronistic law&quot; (Jean-Noël Jeanneney) was never seriously applied and was repealed in the first months of Louis Philippe&#x27;s reign (1830–1848). The Ultras also wanted to create courts to punish Radicals and passed laws restricting freedom of the press.

== Legitimists, the successor of the Ultras ==
The 1830 July Revolution replaced the Bourbons with the more liberal Orléanist branch and sent the Ultras back to private life in their country chateaux. However, they retained some influence until at least the 16 May 1877 crisis and even further. Their views softened, their principal aim became the restoration of the House of Bourbon and they became known from 1830 on as Legitimists. The historian René Rémond has identified the Legitimists as the first of the &quot;right-wing families&quot; of French politics, followed by the Orléanists and the Bonapartists. According to him, many modern far-right movements, including parts of Jean-Marie Le Pen&#x27;s National Front and Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre&#x27;s Society of St. Pius X, should be considered as parts of the Legitimist family.

<text>Earth is a 1990 science fiction novel by American writer David Brin. The book was nominated for the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1991.

==Plot summary==
Set in the year 2038, &quot;Earth&quot; is a cautionary tale of the harm humans can cause their planet via disregard for the environment and reckless scientific experiments. The book has a large cast of characters and Brin uses them to address a number of environmental issues, including endangered species, global warming, refugees from ecological disasters, ecoterrorism, and the social effects of overpopulation. The plot of the book involves an artificially created black hole that has been lost in the Earth&#x27;s interior and the attempts to recover it before it destroys the planet. The events and revelations that follow reshape humanity and its future in the universe. It also includes a war pitting most of the Earth against Switzerland, fueled by outrage over the Swiss allowing generations of kleptocrats to hide their stolen wealth in the country&#x27;s banks.

The scope of the story expands vastly as the plot gradually reveals itself, bringing into question the future course—and even the survival—of humanity.

==Predictions==
Brin set this novel 50 years in the future from the time he was writing, using the book as an opportunity to predict what technologies might — at that future date — be taken for granted day to day. Three technologies he predicted came to pass within only 8 years of the writing, including a media-centric, hypertext Internet, email spam, and the proliferation of personal video recording devices.

Brin claims at least 15 predictive hits in &quot;Earth&quot;, including:

* The World Wide Web (including it as being a major news-media outlet, complete with videos and discussion forums) and blogging. (Brin did not predict the URL, rather using a clumsier numeric form of address.)
* E-mail spam and sophisticated personalized filtering software.
* Reduction of expectation of privacy.
* Time limits on secrets of a personal, corporate, and governmental nature.
* Levees breaking on the Mississippi.
* The dissolution and partitioning of the Soviet Union (though most contemporary scholars later claimed that they were fully aware of the Soviet Union&#x27;s impending collapse by 1989).
* Global warming associated sea level rise and severe storm seasons.
* Subvocal input devices.
* Artificially created black holes considered seriously.
* Crisis habitat arks for endangered species, with a view to later restoration to the wild.
* Eyeglass cameras.
* Eyeglass overlays on real environments.
* Art sculptures on a geologic scale.
* Decline of delivered mail.
* Lawyer software. 

==Reception==
Poet Frederick Turner describes &quot;Earth&quot; as, &quot;An interesting science fiction glimpse at a possible future.&quot;

The book received a number of reviews, including:

<doc id="665840" wikidata="Q5587255" url="?curid=665840" title="Goshen, Washington">
<text>Goshen was a pioneer town in western Whatcom County (approximately northeast of Bellingham, and south of the US border with Canada).

Goshen was a logging and farming community. The town was a stop on the rail line of the Bellingham Bay and British Columbia Railroad. 
At one point Goshen hoped to compete with Whatcom (now Bellingham) and Seattle for the western depot of the railroad line which was being laid north to Washington State, which would guarantee economic investment and much traffic. Tacoma won the contest.

The name remains in Goshen Road and, a short distance to the west, Everson-Goshen Road.

<doc id="665841" wikidata="Q2139282" url="?curid=665841" title="Molly Holly">
<text>Nora Kristina Greenwald (born on September 7, 1977) is an American retired professional wrestler. She is signed to WWE, under the ring name Molly Holly, as a producer. She is also known for her tenure in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Miss Madness and Mona from 1999 to 2000.

Holly began her professional wrestling career in WCW, where she also worked as a trainer. In 2000, Greenwald debuted in the then-WWF as part of The Holly Cousins stable, an alliance of storyline cousins. She was later aligned with The Hurricane. During her time with the WWF/WWE, Holly held the WWF Hardcore Championship once and the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship twice.

Holly continues to make sporadic appearances in WWE, including competing at WWE Evolution and in the 2018 and 2020, and 2022 Women&#x27;s Royal Rumble. Molly Holly was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in the 2021 class. She now serves as a backstage producer on WWE programming.

== Early life ==
Greenwald was born in 1977 to Rick and Bonnie Greenwald. She is named after her grandmother who she remained very close to her entire life. She has two brothers. Greenwald was interested in appearing on &quot;American Gladiators&quot; and trained to be a powerlifter from age 14 to age 18. At age 14, she broke the Minnesota state powerlifting record (75 pounds) for her age group by lifting 100 pounds. She also trained as a gymnast.

After she graduated from Forest Lake Area High School in 1996, Nora left home with $200 and a &#x27;65 Oldsmobile, which she drove from Minnesota to Florida, worked at a Subway restaurant and as a telemarketer, and out of curiosity tried out for wrestling.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1997–1999) ===
Greenwald began training as a wrestler under Dean Malenko in Tampa, Florida, in 1997. She debuted on August 2, 1997, in the World Professional Wrestling Federation (WPWF) under the ring name Starla Saxton. Greenwald wrestled on the independent circuit throughout 1997 and 1998, winning two championships. On August 21, 1998, she defeated Malia Hosaka to win the New Dimension Wrestling Women&#x27;s Title, but lost it one day later back to Hosaka. 

She appeared with both World Championship Wrestling and the World Wrestling Federation as Starla Saxon, unsuccessfully challenging Jacqueline for the WWF Women&#x27;s Championship on an October 1998 episode of &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; and on an episode of the U.K. version of &quot;Shotgun&quot;. In late 1999, she briefly feuded with Brandi Alexander while wrestling in the Florida independent circuit.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1999–2000) ===

Greenwald debuted in WCW as the evil Miss Madness, one of Randy Savage&#x27;s valets along with Gorgeous George and Madusa. Savage asked Greenwald and Madusa to train his then-girlfriend Gorgeous George in real life, highlights of which were shown on WCW television. As part of the storyline, this villainous alliance, called Team Madness, would interfere in matches for the benefit of Savage. Behind the scenes, Greenwald and Madusa trained the other women of WCW at the WCW Power Plant. Eventually, Savage betrayed Miss Madness by firing her from Team Madness along with Madusa after a championship loss. She then became Mona, a fan favorite, who wore a beauty pageant sash, tiara, white gloves, and heels to the ring and wrestled barefoot in a blue cocktail dress. She embarked on mini-feuds with Madusa, Little Jeannie, and Asya. Independent female wrestlers, such as Dee Dee Venturi and Brandi Alexander, were also brought in to wrestle Mona. WCW released Greenwald, however, in August 2000 in a cost-cutting move. In her final televised match, she teamed with Shawn Stasiak against Chris Candido and Tammy Sytch on the May 16, 2000, episode of &quot;WCW Worldwide&quot;.

=== World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (2000-present) ===

==== Lady Ophelia (2000) ====
Upon signing a contract with the World Wrestling Federation, she was sent to their training ground in Memphis Championship Wrestling to work off ring-rust. She became the manager of William Regal and was known as Lady Ophelia. While there, she squared off against The Kat, Bobcat, and Victoria. In 2000, she reappeared in the World Wrestling Federation under the Lady Ophelia gimmick, wrestling dark matches and valeting for William Regal.

==== The Holly Cousins (2000–2001) ====

Greenwald, however, had her first major run in the company as Molly Holly, where she joined her on-screen cousins Bob Holly and Crash Holly. At the time, The Holly Cousins were involved in a feud with T &amp; A (Test, Albert, and manager Trish Stratus). Greenwald says that Stratus was one of her favorite people with whom to work. Molly&#x27;s arrival on the November 6, 2000, edition of &quot;Raw&quot; started a short feud with Stratus, where Molly would beat Stratus on the November 16 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; for her first televised victory over Stratus. Her first PPV appearance was in a Six-Person intergender tag team match at Survivor Series on November 19. On the November 23 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Holly used the &quot;Molly-Go-Round&quot; finisher for the first time and defeated Stratus again. In 2001, Molly formed an on-screen relationship with Spike Dudley, in the midst of their storyline rivalry between her cousins and Spike&#x27;s brothers (The Dudley Boyz). In interviews in subsequent years, Greenwald recalled the &quot;relationship&quot; with Spike Dudley as the &quot;best time of her career.&quot; A subsequent fallout between her and Crash even led to an intergender singles match, with Molly pinning Crash.

==== Mighty Molly (2001–2002) ====

In September 2001, Molly dumped Spike to become Mighty Molly, the superhero sidekick of The Hurricane. Molly, however, eventually left The Hurricane to become a full-time solo wrestler, taking his Hardcore Championship after whacking him with a frying pan at WrestleMania X8 on March 17, 2002, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. She promptly lost it to Christian an hour later after getting a door slammed in her face.

==== Women&#x27;s Champion (2002–2003) ====
After splitting up with The Hurricane in April 2002, she returned to her previous ring name, Molly Holly. Upon her return to the newly renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), she drastically changed her look by shortening her trademark blonde hair and darkening it to autumn brown. Greenwald&#x27;s reasoning behind this was that it fit her new character better. Greenwald adopted a villainous, self-righteous prude character, who was appalled by the other WWE Divas continually using their &quot;assets&quot; and degrading themselves. During this gimmick, she would often refer to herself as being &quot;pure and wholesome.&quot;

After turning heel, Holly began her first rivalry as a villain with Trish Stratus after she attacked her in a post-match assault on the April 1, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, by breaking a paddle over Stratus head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 1/4/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the April 15, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Holly was defeated by Trish Stratus in a number one contenders match to Jazz&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 4/15/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the May 6, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Holly was defeated by Terri in a Diva&#x27;s showdown contest, after wearing a covered swim suit and claiming to have dignity as Terri was dressed with a more revealing swim suit, before attacking her and being stopped by Jerry Lawler, this led to a match between both of them the following week on the May 13, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, where Holly emerged victorious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 5/13/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, her feud with Stratus further escalated after Trish provoked Molly by making fun of Molly&#x27;s large bottom on the June 10 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, which led to a match that same night, where Holly defeated Stratus in a non–title match.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 6/10/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry led to a match at King of the Ring on June 23 for Trish&#x27;s Women&#x27;s title, where Molly successfully captured it for the first time after pinning Stratus by hooking her tights. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Holly teamed up with Jackie Gayda for a tag team match and stated that she finally had brought back dignity to the Women&#x27;s title by not being a &quot;tramp who sleeps her way to the top&quot; referring to Stratus, before being defeated by Trish and Linda Miles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 6/24/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the July 15, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Holly successfully defended her title against Trish Stratus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 7/15/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After multiple intergender tag team matches throughout mid-July, August and early September including the first intergender tag team tables match between both Molly and Stratus who started an alignment with Bubba who competed along with her,&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 7/22/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 9/2/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Trish received a rematch for Molly&#x27;s Championship on September 22 at Unforgiven, where she dropped the title back to Stratus. The following night on &quot;Raw&quot;, Holly tried to regain her title during a triple–threat match against Victoria and Stratus in an unsuccessful attempt, to end their feud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 9/23/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During this feud, Jerry Lawler also began to poke fun at Greenwald&#x27;s bottom-heavy figure, which Greenwald later revealed genuinely hurt her feelings in real-life, Greenwald, however, initially did not mind the storyline when Stephanie McMahon approached her with the idea.

After ending her feud with Stratus, Holly started competing in various singles and tag team matches until the end of 2002 and early 2003 including a second triple–threat match for the Women&#x27;s Championship on October 28, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, ending on both winning and losing sides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 10/14/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 12/23/02&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 2/4/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw 2/10/03&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alliance with Gail Kim (2003–2005) ====
Molly earned her second Women&#x27;s Championship by defeating Gail Kim on &quot;Raw&quot; on July 28, 2003. Kim later turned villainous and joined Molly in her feud with Stratus. During an attack on Stratus, Lita made her return, helping Trish fend off her attackers. Holly and Kim then lost a tag team match to Lita and Trish at Unforgiven, sparking a feud with Lita. This feud led to a match against Lita at Survivor Series for the Women&#x27;s title, which Holly retained.
Molly lost her championship to Victoria in a Four-Way Elimination match on February 23, 2004. The feud led to a Hair versus Title match at WrestleMania XX in March 2004, which Molly lost, resulting in her having her head shaved. Greenwald maintains that it was her idea to have her head shaved, suggesting the idea to Vince McMahon months before the match occurred because she wanted to do something shocking at WrestleMania. Over the next few months, in storyline, she desperately tried to disguise her bald head using loose-fitting wigs. Eventually on the April 19 episode of RAW, Molly&#x27;s bald head was revealed during a match against Victoria, causing her to snap and choke Victoria unconscious. Later in 2004, Molly feuded with Stacy Keibler, overpowering Stacy on the mat and pinning her in three consecutive occasions, the last one occurring in a number one contender&#x27;s match.

Molly Holly&#x27;s final WWE pay-per-view appearance occurred at Taboo Tuesday in 2004 as she appeared in the &quot;Fulfill Your Fantasy Battle Royal&quot; along with many other WWE Divas. The fans voted online for the Divas to wear schoolgirl uniforms, as opposed to French maid or nurse outfits. In contrast to the other girls who wore sexy schoolgirl uniforms, Molly wore a demure 1980s-style schoolgirl uniform with large pink panties underneath. Molly failed to win the match when Stratus eliminated her by tossing her through the ropes for the win. Molly&#x27;s efforts in subsequent attempts to regain the title failed. Due to several wrestlers from the company&#x27;s women&#x27;s division being released in late 2004 and the introduction of the Raw Diva Search program, Molly was mostly left off television, only occasionally appearing on &quot;Sunday Night Heat&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot; in losing efforts to the likes of Lita, Victoria, Trish Stratus, and Christy Hemme.

Greenwald left WWE and a full-time wrestling career in April 2005. Reportedly, she was beginning to become disenchanted with WWE, who began to focus on looks rather than wrestling ability. She also hated that her character had become a villain, but that was not the direct cause of her leaving the company. Greenwald stated that all of the aforementioned reasons were incorrect, but she would like to keep the real reason she left WWE private. She decided to take a break from WWE and spend some time with her family and enjoy life.

==== Sporadic appearances and Hall of Fame (2007–present) ====

In December 2007, at the &quot;Raw 15th Anniversary&quot;, Holly returned during a backstage segment with William Regal, Mickie James, and Hornswoggle.

On April 5, 2009, at WrestleMania XXV, Holly returned to compete on the 25-Diva Royal to crown Miss WrestleMania, which was won by Santina Marella.

On January 27, 2016, she appeared on WWE Network&#x27;s program Table for 3, along with Alundra Blayze and Ivory. She appeared once again on the program this time along with Candice Michelle and Michelle McCool, which aired on May 18.

On January 28, 2018, at the Royal Rumble, Holly made a surprise entrance at number 12 during the first women&#x27;s Royal Rumble match, in which she eliminated Sarah Logan before being eliminated by Michelle McCool. On April 6, she inducted Ivory into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the 2018 class. Molly also competed in the 20-women battle royal at the first ever all women&#x27;s pay-per-view, WWE Evolution.

She also made an appearance on the &quot;Raw Legends Night&quot; special on January 4, 2021.

On March 10, 2021, Holly was announced as the first inductee into the 2021 WWE Hall of Fame. She has since begun to work as a producer for the company.

On January 29, 2022, Mighty Molly was a surprise entrant at the Royal Rumble match but was quickly eliminated by Nikki A.S.H following a sneak attack during her entrance.

=== Independent circuit (2005–2007, 2018) ===
On November 20, 2005, Greenwald made her first public appearance since her WWE departure at Northern IMPACT Wrestling&#x27;s first ever card at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Hall in her hometown of Forest Lake, Minnesota. On January 8, 2006, in Amery, Wisconsin, Greenwald made her first in-ring appearance in nine months, appearing with Northern IMPACT Wrestling, a local Minnesota/Wisconsin wrestling promotion. In addition to refereeing a match between Rain and Ann-Thraxx (Ann Brookstone), Greenwald counted the pin for the main event match between Team Revolution and Team Invasion. She went on to referee an Impact Zone Wrestling match on February 14, 2006, in Tempe, Arizona, and an XJAM Wrestling match on February 16, 2006, in Minot, North Dakota, where she challenged Ann-Thraxx to wrestle her, with Ann-Thraxx refusing. On April 8, 2006, Greenwald appeared at the German Stampede Wrestling event &quot;International Impact III&quot; in Olsberg, Germany, commentating on a match along with former &quot;Pro Wrestling Illustrated&quot; senior editor Bill Apter and refereeing a women&#x27;s match. In subsequent months, she made (non-wrestling) appearances at several independent wrestling events.

On October 7, 2006, Greenwald returned to in-ring action for the first time since April 2005 by defeating Jonny Fairplay after a quick low blow and pinfall in a WCWA event.

Nora returned to several events as guest referee or for autograph signings. She first refereed an intergender match between Kassy Summers and Seito Hayashi for BAW Championship Wrestling on July 13, 2007, in McMinnville, Oregon, then was guest referee in a match between Ann-Thraxx and TNA&#x27;s Christy Hemme for Heavy on Wrestling in Superior, Wisconsin, on July 21. Greenwald is one of the stars of the wrestling documentary, &quot;Bloodstained Memoirs&quot;.

On August 31, 2018, Nora reprised her &quot;Mighty Molly&quot; gimmick and took part in Chikara&#x27;s King of Trios event.

=== Legacy ===
Holly was honored in a sign of respect by wrestler Beth Phoenix on March 31, 2017, during the latter&#x27;s Hall of Fame induction, in which Phoenix noted that Holly put her in touch with Nick Dinsmore and Nightmare Danny Davis., who helped to train her. Phoenix also mentioned that Holly had quietly paid her tuition so that she could chase her dreams. Phoenix then posited that strong women are the ones who build each other up instead of tearing each other down, and that Holly was such a woman.

<text>In computational complexity theory, an advice string is an extra input to a Turing machine that is allowed to depend on the length &quot;n&quot; of the input, but not on the input itself. A decision problem is in the complexity class P/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) if there is a polynomial time Turing machine &quot;M&quot; with the following property: for any &quot;n&quot;, there is an advice string &quot;A&quot; of length &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) such that, for any input &quot;x&quot; of length &quot;n&quot;, the machine &quot;M&quot; correctly decides the problem on the input &quot;x&quot;, given &quot;x&quot; and &quot;A&quot;.

The most common complexity class involving advice is [[P/poly]] where advice length &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) can be any polynomial in &quot;n&quot;. P/poly is equal to the class of decision problems such that, for every &quot;n&quot;, there exists a polynomial size Boolean circuit correctly deciding the problem on all inputs of length &quot;n&quot;. One direction of the equivalence is easy to see. If, for every &quot;n&quot;, there is a polynomial size Boolean circuit &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) deciding the problem, we can use a Turing machine that interprets the advice string as a description of the circuit. Then, given the description of &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) as the advice, the machine will correctly decide the problem on all inputs of length &quot;n&quot;. The other direction uses a simulation of a polynomial-time Turing machine by a polynomial-size circuit as in one proof of Cook&#x27;s theorem. Simulating a Turing machine with advice is no more complicated than simulating an ordinary machine, since the advice string can be incorporated into the circuit.

Because of this equivalence, P/poly is sometimes defined as the class of decision problems solvable by polynomial size Boolean circuits, or by polynomial-size non-uniform Boolean circuits.

P/poly contains both P and [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]] (Adleman&#x27;s theorem). It also contains some undecidable problems, such as the unary version of every undecidable problem, including the halting problem. Because of that, it is not contained in DTIME (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) or NTIME (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) for any &quot;f&quot;.

Advice classes can be defined for other resource bounds instead of P. For example, taking a non-deterministic polynomial time Turing machine with an advice of length &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) gives the complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]]/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). If we are allowed an advice of length 2&quot;n&quot;, we can use it to encode whether each input of length &quot;n&quot; is contained in the language. Therefore, any boolean function is computable with an advice of length 2&quot;n&quot; and advice of more than exponential length is not meaningful.

Similarly, the class [[L/poly]] can be defined as deterministic logspace with a polynomial amount of advice.

Known results include:

* The classes NL/poly and UL/poly are the same, i.e. nondeterministic logarithmic space computation with advice can be made unambiguous. This may be proved using an isolation lemma.
* It is known that coNEXP is contained in NEXP/poly.
* If NP is contained in P/poly, then the polynomial time hierarchy collapses (Karp-Lipton theorem).

<doc id="665846" wikidata="Q636680" url="?curid=665846" title="William S. Hart">
<text>William Surrey Hart (December 6, 1864 – June 23, 1946) was an American silent film actor, screenwriter, director and producer. He is remembered as a foremost Western star of the silent era who &quot;imbued all of his characters with honor and integrity.&quot; During the late 1910s and early 1920s, he was one of the most consistently popular movie stars, frequently ranking high among male actors in popularity contests held by movie fan magazines.

== Early life ==
Hart was born in Newburgh, New York, to Nicholas Hart ( 1834–1895) and Rosanna Hart ( 1839–1909). William had two brothers, who died very young, and four sisters. His father was born in England, and his mother was born in Ireland. He was a distant cousin of the western star Neal Hart.

He began his acting career on stage in his 20s, with his 1888 debut performance as a member of a company headed by Daniel E. Bandmann. The following year he joined Lawrence Barrett&#x27;s company in New York and later spent several seasons with Mlle. Hortense Rhéa&#x27;s traveling company. He toured and traveled extensively while trying to make a name for himself as an actor, and for a time directed shows at the Asheville Opera House in North Carolina, around the year 1900. He had some success as a Shakespearean actor on Broadway, working with Margaret Mather and other stars; he appeared in the original 1899 stage production of &quot;Ben-Hur.&quot; His family had moved to Asheville but, after his youngest sister Lotta died of typhoid fever in 1901, they all left together for Brooklyn until William went back on tour.

== Film career ==
Hart went on to become one of the first great stars of the motion picture Western. Fascinated by the Old West, he acquired Billy the Kid&#x27;s &quot;six shooters&quot; and was a friend of legendary lawmen Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. He entered films in 1914, and after playing supporting roles in two short films, he achieved stardom the same year as the lead in the feature &quot;The Bargain&quot;. Hart was particularly interested in making realistic Western films. His films are noted for their authentic costumes and props, as well as Hart&#x27;s acting ability, honed on Shakespearean theater stages in the United States and England.

Beginning in 1915, Hart starred in his own series of two-reel Western short subjects for producer Thomas Ince, which were so popular that they were supplanted by a series of feature films. Many of Hart&#x27;s early films continued to play in theaters, under new titles, for another decade. In 1915 and 1916 exhibitors voted him the biggest money making star in the United States. In 1917 Hart accepted a lucrative offer from Adolph Zukor to join Famous Players–Lasky, which merged into Paramount Pictures. In the films Hart began to ride a brown and white pinto he called &quot;Fritz&quot;. Fritz was the forerunner of later famous movie horses known by their own name, e.g., horses like Tom Mix&#x27;s &quot;Tony&quot;, Roy Rogers&#x27;s &quot;Trigger&quot; and Clayton Moore&#x27;s &quot;Silver&quot;. In 1917, to signify &quot;his patriotism and loyalty to Uncle Sam&quot; it was announced to &quot;change the name of his favorite horse from Fritz to one more truly American.&quot; He also volunteered from 1917 to 1918 with the Four Minute Men program to give short pro-war speeches across the country. Hart was now making feature films exclusively, and films like &quot;Square Deal Sanderson&quot; and &quot;The Toll Gate&quot; were popular with fans.

In 1919 Hart&#x27;s &quot;John Petticoats&quot; costar was a young actress named Winifred Westover. The film was made in New Orleans, and was a departure from Hart&#x27;s usual roles, as he played a lumberman who was informed he&#x27;d inherited a shop selling ladies clothing.

In 1921, Hollywood comic actor Roscoe Arbuckle was charged with rape and manslaughter in the death of aspiring actress Virginia Rappe. Amid the controversy, many of Arbuckle&#x27;s fellow actors declined public comment on the case. However, Hart, who had never worked with Arbuckle or even met him, made a number of damaging public statements in which he presumed the actor&#x27;s guilt. Arbuckle, who was eventually acquitted but saw his career ruined, later wrote a premise for a film parodying Hart as a thief, bully and wife beater, and it was bought by Buster Keaton. The following year, Keaton co-wrote, directed and starred in the 1922 comedy film &quot;The Frozen North&quot;. As a result, Hart refused to speak to Keaton for many years.

By the early 1920s, Hart&#x27;s brand of gritty, rugged Westerns with drab costumes and moralistic themes gradually fell out of fashion. The public became attracted by a new kind of movie cowboy, epitomized by Tom Mix, who wore flashier costumes and was involved in more action scenes. Paramount dropped Hart, who then made one last bid for his kind of Western. He produced &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; (1925) with his own money, arranging to release it independently through United Artists. The film turned out well, with an epic land-rush sequence, but did only fair business at the box office. Hart was angered by United Artists&#x27; failure to promote his film properly and sued the studio. The legal proceedings dragged on for years, and the courts finally ruled in Hart&#x27;s favor, in 1940.

After &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot;, Hart retired to his Newhall, California, ranch home, &quot;La Loma de los Vientos&quot;, which was designed by architect Arthur R. Kelly. In 1939 he appeared in his only sound film, a spoken prologue for a reissue of &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot;. In this segment, filmed at his ranch, the 74-year-old Hart reflected on the Old West and fondly recalled his silent movie heyday. The speech turned out to be his farewell to the screen. Most prints and video versions of &quot;Tumbleweeds&quot; circulating today include the speech.

== Personal life ==
Hart was always close to his sister Mary, and when he moved to California she came with him. In his autobiography &quot;My Life East and West&quot;, he called Mary “my constant advisor,” and stated that she took care of his fan mail. Mary is listed as cowriter for two of his published books, &quot;Pinto Ben and Other Stories&quot; (1919), and &quot;And All Points West&quot; (1940).

When Winifred Westover, Hart&#x27;s &quot;John Petticoats&quot; costar, was working in New York City Hart came to see her, and escorted her to dinner and shows. She was about to sign a five-year film contract with Lewis J. Selznick when Hart sent her a telegram, telling her not to sign anything until she&#x27;d received a letter he was mailing to her. The letter contained a marriage proposal. She telegraphed her acceptance.

On December 7, 1921, Hart married Westover in Los Angeles. She was 22 years old, and Hart was 57. The only guests were the bride&#x27;s mother, Hart&#x27;s sister Mary, and his attorney. On the day of her wedding Westover signed an agreement to retire from acting.

Westover moved into the house shared by Hart and his sister, Mary. Six months into the marriage Hart told his pregnant wife to leave his home, and she went to live with her mother in Santa Monica. During the divorce hearing Westover testified that Hart&#x27;s sister was the reason for the separation, and that her husband had insisted on keeping open the door that separated their bedroom from his sister&#x27;s room.

The couple&#x27;s son, William S. Hart Jr., was born on September 22, 1922. On February 11, 1927, Westover was granted a divorce in Reno, Nevada. She received $100,000, with the understanding she would not return to acting or have her photograph published. A trust fund of $100,000 was established for William S. Hart Jr., to be used for his support and education.

Hart&#x27;s son lived with his mother, and spent little time with his father, but when Hart&#x27;s sister Mary died in 1943 it was reported that the &quot;tall, erect cowboy&quot; entered the funeral service &quot;leaning on the arm of his son, William S. Hart, Jr.&quot;

== Death ==
Hart died on June 23, 1946, in Newhall, California, at the age of 81. He was buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. His Last Will and Testament stated: &quot;I have made no provision in this will for my son for the reason that I have amply provided for him during my lifetime.&quot;

== Dedications ==
For his contribution to the motion picture industry, William S. Hart has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6363 Hollywood Blvd. In 1975, he was inducted into the Western Performers Hall of Fame at the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

As part of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, California, Hart&#x27;s former home and 260-acre (1.1 km2) ranch in Newhall is now William S. Hart Park. The William S. Hart High School District as well as William S. Hart Senior High School, both located in the Santa Clarita Valley in the northern part of Los Angeles County, were named in his honor. A Santa Clarita baseball field complex is named in his honor.

The &quot;Range Rider of the Yellowstone,&quot; a statue commissioned by Hart and modeled from life, stands on the Rimrocks in front of the airport at Billings, Montana. Hart donated it to the city in 1927, where it remains a memorial to his memory.
On November 10, 1962, Hart was honored posthumously in an episode of &quot;The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Show&quot;, a short-lived western variety program on ABC.

== Filmography ==
== William S. Hart Ranch and Museum ==
When Hart died, he bequeathed his home to Los Angeles County so that it could be converted into a park and museum. His former home in Newhall, Santa Clarita, California, has become a satellite of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County and is free and open to the public. The home is a Spanish Colonial Revival style mansion and contains many of the movie star&#x27;s possessions including Native American artifacts and works by artists Charles Marion Russell, James Montgomery Flagg, and Joe de Yong. The Museum is an important part of Hart&#x27;s legacy as he said before he died: &quot;When I was making pictures, the people gave me their nickels, dimes, and quarters. When I am gone, I want them to have my home.&quot; The surrounding 265-acre William S. Hart Park includes the mansion, trails, an animal area with farm animals, bison, and a picnic area. Hart Park and Museum is located at 24151 Newhall Avenue, Santa Clarita, CA 91321. Since 2015, the park has been home to the Santa Clarita Cowboy Festival and Annual Hart of the West Powwow. The former was previously held at Melody Ranch.

<doc id="665853" wikidata="Q675392" url="?curid=665853" title="Mürren">
<text>Mürren is a traditional Walser mountain village in the Bernese Highlands of Switzerland, at an elevation of above sea level. It cannot be reached by public road. It is also one of the popular tourist spots in Switzerland, and summer and winter are the seasons when Mürren becomes busy with tourists. The village features a view of the three towering mountains Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau. Mürren has a year-round population of 450, but has 2,000 hotel beds.

Mürren has its own school and two churches, one Reformed and one Roman Catholic.

==History==

Mürren is first mentioned in 1257 as &quot;Mons Murren&quot; (Mount Murren). It was probably an alpine pasture until the settlement of immigrants from Lötschental shortly after 1300. 

The first hotel was built in 1857 by Mürren&#x27;s farming cooperative, the Bäuert. Before the opening of the Lauterbrunnen–Mürren Mountain Railway in 1891, guests could only reach Mürren by means of mule traffic (see picture). Nevertheless, the quickly growing resort already had 310 hotel beds around 1888. Up to World War I, mainly British tourists came to Mürren. An Anglican church was erected for them as early as 1878.
Winter sports have been an important part of Mürren&#x27;s history since the first British winter tourists arrived in 1911. During the First World War wounded prisoners of war stayed here pending repatriation and played a role in developing winter sports. In 1924, the Kandahar Ski Club was set up by Sir Arnold Lunn (whose statue stands outside the rail station) and eight other British skiers. The club takes its name from the Roberts of Kandahar Challenge Cup, first run in 1911. This, the world&#x27;s senior challenge cup for downhill ski-racing, was presented by Lord Roberts, who won the Battle of Kandahar in the Second Anglo-Afghan War.

==Politics==
Mürren is situated within the canton of Bern, in the district of Interlaken and belongs to the municipality of Lauterbrunnen, together with the villages of Wengen, Isenfluh, Gimmelwald and Stechelberg.

==Transport==

Mürren station is the terminus of the Bergbahn Lauterbrunnen-Mürren, which consists of a cable car and a connecting narrow gauge railway and connects Mürren to Lauterbrunnen.

A series of four cable cars, known as the &quot;Luftseilbahn Stechelberg-Mürren-Schilthorn (LSMS)&quot;, provides transportation from Mürren downhill to Gimmelwald and Stechelberg, and uphill to the summit of the Schilthorn and the revolving restaurant Piz Gloria. The Mürren station for these cable cars is approximately south-west of the railway station at the other end of Mürren. This was a principal filming location for the James Bond movie &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, released in 1969, in which fictional spy James Bond (George Lazenby) made his escape from the headquarters of Ernst Stavro Blofeld (Telly Savalas) and fled four of Blofeld&#x27;s henchmen in a car driven by his girlfriend Tracy (Diana Rigg).

There is an additional cable car that runs directly from Mürren to Stechelberg, but this is provided solely for the movement of freight and used for public transportation only in times of repair of the regular cable car.

Mürren is also the lower terminus of the Allmendhubelbahn, a funicular.
==Recreation==
There are a total of 52 km (32 mi) of ski runs with 14 ski lifts (six cable cars, seven chair lifts, three railways, and two drag lifts). There is also off-piste skiing, but guiding is often needed and should be used.

Within the village there is a large sports center with a 25 m swimming pool, sports hall, fitness room, café, information centre and other facilities. There is a large skating rink which is sometimes used for curling competitions as well as a specific curling rink that in the summer is a tennis court. The ice rink is turned into a mini-golf course during the summer months. In the summer there are also tennis courts near the sports chalet, located at 1650 meters above sea level, they are some of the highest altitude tennis courts in the world.

==Hotels==
There are many hotels in Mürren, including the Hotel Alpenblick, Hotel Alpenruh, Alpina, Hotel Bellevue, Hotel Blumental, Hotel Edelweiss, Hotel Eiger, Eiger Guesthouse, Hotel Jungfrau, Hotel Regina and Sportschalet.

<doc id="665854" wikidata="Q8010806" url="?curid=665854" title="William Handcock, 1st Viscount Castlemaine">
<text>William Handcock, 1st Viscount Castlemaine, PC (Ire) (28 August 1761 – 7 January 1839) was an Irish MP and a supporter of the union of Ireland with Great Britain.

==Life==
He was born in Dublin, Ireland to Reverend Richard Handcock and Sarah Toler. In 1783, Handcock stood for Athlone in the Irish House of Commons and represented the constituency until the Acts of Union in 1801. He was Constable and Governor of Athlone 1813–1839 and Governor of County Westmeath 1814–1831.

Handcock was killed on the Night of the Big Wind in 1839 when the wind blew his bedroom shutters open at Moydrum Castle and hurled him “so violently upon his back that he instantly expired”.

The Australian city of Castlemaine in the state of Victoria was named in his honour by his nephew Captain W. Wright.

==Family and title==
On 20 March 1782 he married Lady Florinda Trench (3 August 1766 – 9 February 1851), born in Twyford, Westmeath to William Power Keating Trench, 1st Earl of Clancarty and Anne Gardiner, Countess of Clancarty. William and Florinda had no children, and when Handcock was created Baron Castlemaine, of Moydrum (in the Peerage of Ireland) on 21 December 1812 the title had a special &quot;remainder&quot; &quot;failing heirs of his body to his brother&quot;. He was further created Viscount Castlemaine on 12 January 1822 but without a &quot;special remainder&quot;.

On his death the viscountcy became extinct. His barony passed to his brother, whose descendants still hold the title.

<doc id="665856" wikidata="Q269049" url="?curid=665856" title="Floodland (album)">
<text>Floodland is the second studio album by the English gothic rock band the Sisters of Mercy. It was released on 16 November 1987, through Merciful Release, a subsidiary of WEA, internationally and through Elektra Records in the United States. After the release of the band&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; (1985), members Craig Adams and Wayne Hussey left to form the Mission, causing the dissolution of the Sisters of Mercy. As a result, band frontman Andrew Eldritch formed a side project known as the Sisterhood. After the first Sisterhood album was received negatively overall, Eldritch restarted the Sisters of Mercy and hired the Sisterhood member Patricia Morrison for the recording of a new album.

Eldritch wrote the songs of &quot;Floodland&quot; in Hamburg; the city&#x27;s large amount of water influenced its title as well as the recurring lyrical theme of water. He then called upon Larry Alexander to produce the album with him and Jim Steinman to produce the songs &quot;Dominion&quot; / &quot;Mother Russia&quot; and &quot;This Corrosion&quot;. Recording sessions began at Power Station Studios in New York City during January 1987 and carried on throughout the first half of the year at Strawberry Studios in Stockport and The Wool Hall in Bath. Eldritch served as the vocalist, performed all instruments, and programmed the band&#x27;s drum machine, &quot;Doktor Avalanche&quot;.

The drum machine acted as the drum player; other than backing vocals, Morrison did not contribute to the album despite being a member of the Sisters of Mercy. In contrast to the conventional group-based recording sessions for &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;, &quot;Floodland&quot; was pieced together on computers using sequencers. The music incorporates the genres of gothic rock and dark wave, while the lyrical content sees Eldritch cast as the observer of a slowly deteriorating world. Some of the events that inspired certain songs include the Chernobyl disaster, the Cold War, and the band&#x27;s previous break-up.

The singles &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, &quot;Dominion&quot;, and &quot;Lucretia My Reflection&quot; were released in promotion. &quot;This Corrosion&quot; peaked at number 7 on the UK Singles Chart, while &quot;Dominion&quot; and &quot;Lucretia My Reflection&quot; peaked at number 13 and 20, respectively. &quot;Floodland&quot; debuted on the UK Albums Chart at number 9, later being certified gold in UK by the BPI for selling 100,000 copies. It also reached the top 40 in other European countries, including Switzerland. Despite initially receiving mixed reviews from music critics, &quot;Floodland&quot; has retrospectively received praise and been considered a seminal gothic rock album by several critics.

==Background==

After the release of the Sisters of Mercy debut studio album &quot;First and Last and Always&quot; in March 1985, frontman Andrew Eldritch intended for them to record an ABBA cover as a single, and tried to hire Jim Steinman as a producer. Eldritch originally contacted him when the ABBA song &quot;Gimme! Gimme! Gimme!&quot; (1979) was part of the band&#x27;s setlist. Steinman was interested in producing the cover version, but was too busy at that time. Shortly afterward, the Sisters of Mercy disbanded. The break-up occurred while the band prepared their second studio album in October 1985, which was going to be titled &quot;Left on Mission and Revenge&quot;. Eldritch, who had still intended to record the album but as a solo artist, called bassist Patricia Morrison that same month, who was on a tour of the United Kingdom with her band Fur Bible in support of Siouxsie and the Banshees, asking Morrison to collaborate.

The music press reported the break-up of the band on 2 November 1985, announcing that &quot;the Sisters of Mercy were down to singer Andrew Eldritch and his faithful drum machine [Doktor Avalanche] this week after guitarist Wayne Hussey and bassist Craig Adams left the band. Although this has scuppered recording plans for a new album this month, Andrew now intends to record the same album in the New Year and could well be using Wayne as a session guitarist. [...] Andrew has also approached former Gun Club bassist Patricia Morrison—now in Fur Bible—to play on the album, but it&#x27;s not yet known whether Andrew will continue with the name Sisters of Mercy.&quot; Eldritch had no intention to carry on under the disformed band&#x27;s name, as members who left to form the Mission had an agreement with him that the name the Sisters of Mercy would be used by no one after the break-up.

Eldritch released the single &quot;Giving Ground&quot; on 20 January 1986 as part of a project under the name the Sisterhood, which features vocals by his musician friend James Ray. At the end of February 1986, the record label Merciful Release announced that the &quot;forthcoming Andrew Eldritch album which for some months has had the working title &quot;Left on Mission and Revenge&quot;.&quot; The album was eventually titled &quot;Gift&quot;, being released in July 1986, again by the Sisterhood. It was recorded at Fairview Studios in Willerby, Hull. Eldritch did not sing on the album for contractual reasons, though Morrison collaborated with him for the first time, contributing a spoken passage on the track &quot;Jihad&quot;. &quot;Gift&quot; was negatively received overall and Eldritch lost his publishing deal with RCA Music Limited as a result of it. A 12-inch EP by the Sisterhood entitled &quot;This Corrosion&quot; was planned for release and set to feature an American vocalist, whose identity was meant to be kept secret until release. The EP had been recorded at Fairview Studios with Alan Vega but remained unreleased, with Eldritch instead keeping the idea for when he would reboot the Sisters of Mercy.
==Recording==

After what was dubbed the &quot;Sisterhood fiasco&quot; by &quot;Sounds&quot;, Eldritch decided to continue under the name the Sisters of Mercy, feeling as though doing so would improve the name&#x27;s reputation after the previous fallout. He also thought that it would have been nonsensical to change the name, as he still wrote songs the same way as before. Eldritch, who in 1985 first moved to Bramfeld and then to St. Pauli, began to compose a new album while in Hamburg, under the Warner Elektra Atlantic (WEA) label. The demos for the album were mainly recorded with a Casio CZ-101 synthesiser, acoustic guitars and a new drum machine. At the time, Eldritch was attempting to find a MIDI drum machine of a modest price that featured a &quot;tighter snare drum&quot; sound.

Despite hiring her to play bass guitar on the album, Eldritch later claimed that Morrison did not contribute to the songwriting for it, with him saying that it was practically a solo record. Eldritch insinuated that she suffered from writer&#x27;s block and was unable to come up with many musical ideas, also adding that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t even get her to pick up the bass in the first place.&quot; He reaffirmed this in a 2012 interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, stating that she &quot;didn&#x27;t make the cut&quot; and therefore did not appear on &quot;Floodland&quot;. Merciful Release office manager Boyd Steemson also gave confirmation that Morrison&#x27;s contributions were minimal. Eldritch denied that his approach to songwriting had changed since the band split, saying &quot;&#x27;This Corrosion&#x27; sounds like &#x27;Temple of Love&#x27; II, &#x27;1959&#x27; sounds like &#x27;Afterhours&#x27; part 2. I don&#x27;t see any difference or any real change. I think I just carry on where I stopped.&quot; He licensed the publishing to SBK Songs Limited, which is now part of EMI Music Publishing.
The starting point for the album was the song &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, which was set to be produced by Steinman. Eldritch had immediately thought of him when he came up with the idea for the song. He stated that &quot;when we were trying to sell &#x27;Corrosion&#x27; to Steinman, we told him it was like the high-point of a Borgia&#x27;s disco evening and he went for it.&quot; Eldritch also used Steinman to get his record label to concede an appropriate recording budget. He figured that the label would not grant money to use on choirs, but that they would immediately do so if Steinman were to ask for it. According to Steemson, Max Hole, the head of WEA&#x27;s A&amp;R, managed to get the band a budget of £50,000 for &quot;This Corrosion&quot;.

The recording of &quot;This Corrosion&quot; and &quot;Dominion&quot; / &quot;Mother Russia&quot; started during January 1987 in New York City. Steinman and Eldritch used Power Station Studios in the city&#x27;s Manhattan borough, where they worked with engineer Larry Alexander. On both songs, Steinman used six background singers and 40 members of the New York Choral Society. Eldritch recalled that he was unsure as to why so many vocalists sung all at once, but noted that this &quot;seemed like a good idea at the time&quot; and worked out well in the end. Steinman mainly focused on the production of the choral singings and did not contribute much to the actual composition and arrangements. This caused him to receive only partial production credit on &quot;Dominion / Mother Russia&quot;.

The remainder of &quot;Floodland&quot; was recorded in England. Initially, Eldritch worked with an unknown producer, whom he eventually fired. He called Alexander while in New York City and hired him as a co-producer. The two travelled to England, where they recorded at multiple studios. They spent time at Strawberry Studios in Stockport before transitioning to The Wool Hall in Bath to finish recording. The mixing for the album was then done at AIR Studios in London.

==Composition==
===Music===

The music of &quot;Floodland&quot; was described as a mix of gothic rock and dark wave. In contrast to the Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s previous album, &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;, which had been recorded in a conventional way, &quot;Floodland&quot; was pieced together on a computer that used sequencers to help. Eldritch worked on the recorded parts with a Voyetra Sequencer Plus, while a Yamaha SPX90 was used as an effects unit and the parts were saved on a Compaq Portable 286. The guitars were played by Eldritch himself, apart from the solo on &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, which was played by Steinman&#x27;s friend Eddie Martinez. The drum sounds on the album were sampled together from various drum machines with an Akai S900. The tom sound was from an Oberheim DMX, which had previously been used on &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;. The other drum sounds were from a Yamaha RX-5. The track &quot;1959&quot; features only the sound of a piano, but was pieced together with a sequencer by Eldritch and played without an actual piano.

===Lyrics===

Regarding the title &quot;Floodland&quot;, Eldritch realised that, after writing all the songs for the album, the theme of water came up repeatedly. He attributed the theme&#x27;s recurrence to the amount of water within Hamburg, where he was writing these songs. Michael Bonner of &quot;Uncut&quot; viewed Eldritch as casting himself in a role where he is a &quot;jaded observer, watching cynically as he and the world slouch towards Armageddon,&quot; adding that the songs are bonded together by &quot;images of the apocalypse that straddle the gap between the personal and the political.&quot;

&quot;Floodland&quot;″s two-part opening track, &quot;Dominion&quot; / &quot;Mother Russia&quot;, was inspired by &quot;Ozymandias&quot; (1818), a Shelley sonnet about a tyrant whose legacy of conquest diminishes as time passes by, from which one line is lifted. Bonner noted that the song seemed to have been inspired by geopolitics of the Cold War as well. Eldritch additionally took inspiration from his time in Central Europe during the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. He considered the song to be about &quot;the prostitution of Europe by the Americans,&quot; adding that this was a part of his &quot;hate/hate relationship with America. I just had the idea of all them huddled in their mobile homes while Mother Russia rained down on them.&quot; &quot;Flood I&quot; and &quot;Flood II&quot; both use the word &quot;flood&quot; as a metaphor for sex. Eldritch felt that a flood could be something stimulating, adding: &quot;most people [...] only get wet under certain circumstances.&quot; He called &quot;Lucretia My Reflection&quot; his &quot;Welcome on board, Patricia&quot; song, saying that he had always thought of her as a &quot;Lucretia-type person.&quot; &quot;1959&quot; is a partially-autobiographical song, which takes its title from Eldritch&#x27;s birth year. He thought that the song regards &quot;innocence–inherited as opposed to environmental.&quot;
The centrepiece of the album, &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, goes back to the conflict between Eldritch and his former bandmates, who had formed the Mission. The lyrics of the track are a parody of lyrics in the manner that Hussey especially wrote them, which Eldritch considered to be typically &quot;clichéd&quot; and &quot;meaningless&quot;. As a result, Eldritch felt that most of the lyrics &quot;should be thought of in quotation marks. It would be too confusing to print them all.&quot; He also noted that &quot;This Corrosion&quot; on the lyrics sheet is capitalised in the style of a song title because &quot;it&#x27;s the title of somebody else&#x27;s song,&quot; recalling a list of song titles that Hussey kept to himself. Eldritch claimed that Hussey would select the titles that he thought were the best and generate lyrics out of them. Eldritch claimed: &quot;It didn&#x27;t have to have any meaning, it just had to sound good.&quot;

&quot;Driven Like the Snow&quot;, similarly to &quot;Nine While Nine&quot; from &quot;First and Last and Always&quot;, is about Eldritch&#x27;s former girlfriend Claire Shearsby, even being noted as &quot;Nine While Nine Part 2&quot; by him. He thought of the song as a way to logically explain why their relationship had to fall apart. Speaking of &quot;Never Land&quot;, Eldritch commented that it imagines &quot;the entire population of the earth starting to travel from some indefinable point in space toward the earth at increasing speed. It would take an eternity to reach the earth—by which time you&#x27;d be reasonably spiritualised—and even when you reached the destination, you wouldn&#x27;t actually hit the ground. You&#x27;d be going so fast you&#x27;d just go through and out the other side, where there is another eternity of nothingness. I just tried to write a song about these impressions.&quot; The lyrics Eldritch spoke of were found on the full 12-minute version of the song, which remained unreleased until it was included on the 2006 reissue of &quot;Floodland&quot;.
==Release and promotion==
&quot;This Corrosion&quot; was selected as the lead single from &quot;Floodland&quot;, although Eldritch initially had pleaded for &quot;Dominion&quot; to be the lead single. The song was released on 21 September 1987 through Merciful Release, a subsidiary of WEA operated by Eldritch, being released as a 7-inch, 12-inch, CD and cassette; each version contained a different mix of the song. Eldritch originally wanted the long version on the single release, but the record label preferred an edited version. The mix of the LP version is similar to that of the 12-inch version, though the version lasts about 45 seconds longer. The cassette version was mixed by Steinman, and differs from other single versions. The B-side of the single was &quot;Torch&quot;, which Eldritch produced and played every instrument for. It had been written in 1985 for the scrapped album &quot;Left on Mission and Revenge&quot; album. The 12-inch single added Eldritch&#x27;s version of the Sisterhood song &quot;Colours&quot; (1985), while WEA conceded a budget of over £50,000 for the music video of &quot;This Corrosion&quot;. The video was shot at a warehouse in Wapping and directed by Stuart Orme. The Sisters of Mercy wanted to film in Kazakhstan of the Soviet Union, but at the same time, Russian record label Melodiya were in negotiations with the West regarding video rights, and filming there would have botched the negotiations.

&quot;Floodland&quot; was released in the United Kingdom on 16 November 1987, later receiving a release in the United States on 11 January 1988 through Elektra Records. The album had simultaneous releases on vinyl, cassette, and CD. The cassette release included &quot;Torch&quot;, the B-side to &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, and the CD release included both &quot;Torch&quot; and &quot;Colours&quot;, the latter being another B-side from the single releases for &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, as bonus tracks. Morrison&#x27;s name was not included in the credits for &quot;Floodland&quot;, although she was pictured on the sleeve and appeared under her real name of Anne Rainone in the &quot;Thanks&quot; section of the inner sleeve. She downplayed the lack of inclusion in interviews, saying: &quot;if you look at Sisters&#x27; records, the names for what people play usually aren&#x27;t there. Andrew writes the songs so there&#x27;s no reason for anyone else to be featured. I was well aware of that when the album came out but what I didn&#x27;t realise was that it would confuse other people. If people haven&#x27;t seen the press we&#x27;ve done, they don&#x27;t know I&#x27;m in the band.&quot; Eldritch still considered Morrison to be a vital part of the Sisters of Mercy, as she contributed greatly to the band&#x27;s visual identity by appearing in music videos released for &quot;Floodland&quot; and on the album cover. Eldritch chose not to embark on a tour to promote the album, feeling that it was not made to be played live. He later recalled not having a band ready to accompany him on a tour, which was the real reason why he chose not to tour and instead opted to promote &quot;Floodland&quot; through singles, music videos, and television appearances only.
Following the release of &quot;Floodland&quot; in November, a remix of &quot;Dominion&quot; was announced as the second single in December 1987 and released in the last week of February 1988. A cover version of the Hot Chocolate song &quot;Emma&quot; (1974) was recorded to be released as part of the single. The single&#x27;s other B-side tracks, made from various &quot;Dominion&quot; segments, were prepared shortly before the &quot;Dominion&quot; music video shoot. &quot;Sandstorm&quot; consists of various sampled saxophone and keyboard parts from &quot;Dominion&quot;, mixed to a moody short instrumental track, which was used in the opening section of the video. &quot;Untitled&quot; is a slowed-down instrumental excerpt from &quot;Dominion&quot;. The CD single for the song contained &quot;Ozymandias&quot;, which is &quot;Dominion&quot; played backwards. The video for &quot;Dominion&quot; was filmed during February 1988 in the Jordanian city of Petra; it was the first ever music video to have been shot in Jordan. After the commercial success of &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, WEA had again conceded a budget of £50,000 and they enlisted director David Hogan, who shot the video in two days after four-and-a-half months of preparation. Eldritch called the video &quot;&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; part two.&quot;

The third and final single from the album, a remix of &quot;Lucretia My Reflection&quot;, was released on 27 May 1988. The B-side of the single was &quot;Long Train&quot;; the title references lyrics from &quot;Lucretia My Reflection&quot;. An accompanying music video was filmed by director Peter Sinclair at locations in India, including a cotton mill in Bombay. Eldritch had also considered releasing &quot;1959&quot; as a single at some point; it was later released as a promotional single that aimed for radio play. The song also received a music video that was filmed in India.
==Reception==
===Critical===

&quot;Floodland&quot; was met with mixed reviews from music critics. Mark Coleman of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that the album was a step down from the Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s previous material. He described it as &quot;Meat Loaf joining the Cure for a remake of Lou [Reed]&#x27;s &quot;Berlin&quot;&quot;, adding that the album is &quot;hilarious, sure, but always listenable at the very least&quot;. Coleman provided praise, however, for &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, calling it a &quot;bona fide toe-tapper of a single.&quot; In &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau compared the band&#x27;s &quot;doldrums&quot; negatively to fellow gothic rock band Fields of the Nephilim, albeit less dumb as well as compensated with &quot;disco&quot; and &quot;proper nouns&quot;.

&quot;Floodland&quot; has since received retrospective praise from music critics, however. Writing for AllMusic, Chris True heralded the album as &quot;a definite milestone&quot;, complimenting its &quot;lush production&quot; and &quot;lyric imagery that is both scary and glorious.&quot; He added that the band create &quot;a black soundscape that is majestic and vast&quot; with &quot;Dominion&quot; / &quot;Mother Russia&quot; and that &quot;slower tracks, like &#x27;Flood&#x27; and &#x27;1959,&#x27; are some of the best ethereal sounds goth has to offer, and the downright regal &#x27;This Corrosion&#x27; is one of the best songs of the genre.&quot; Sputnikmusic staff member ManosG wrote that &quot;&quot;Floodland&quot; may not be as dark, influential or focused as the band’s debut but is still an excellent album with an amazing vocal performance by Andrew [Eldritch]&quot;. He also called &quot;Lucretia My Reflection&quot; one of the best songs in the Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s discography, alongside giving praise to &quot;Dominion / Mother Russia&quot;, &quot;1959&quot;, &quot;This Corrosion&quot;, and &quot;Flood II&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Sam Sodomsky described it as a &quot;goth rock masterpiece&quot; and &quot;a dramatic and winkingly macabre record&quot;. &quot;Floodland&quot; was later considered an essential gothic rock album by &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;Consequence&quot;, &quot;Spectrum Culture&quot;, &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Treble&quot;.

===Commercial===
&quot;Floodland&quot; reached number nine on the UK Albums Chart. Preorders alone assured the album silver certification on the day of its release, and on 11 March 1988 it was certified gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for selling 100,000 units. According to Eldritch, &quot;Floodland&quot; recouped the high production costs in 1989. In Germany, which Eldritch claimed was the band&#x27;s second largest market behind the UK, the album entered the Top 100 albums chart on 14 December 1987 at number 32, remaining on the chart for 20 weeks. In 1993, &quot;Floodland&quot; was certified gold in Germany by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for sales of 250,000 units. In the US, the album debuted at number 174 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 during the week of 6 February 1988. It went on to peak at number 101, after spending six weeks on the chart, during the week of 12 March 1988.

<text>Piz Gloria is a revolving restaurant at the -high summit of the Schilthorn near Mürren in the Bernese Oberland, Switzerland.

==Overview==

The cable car station and the restaurant were designed by Bernese architect Konrad Wolf. The Piz restaurant claims to be the world&#x27;s first revolving restaurant although others already existed at the time of Piz Gloria&#x27;s 1969 opening, such as the &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; in Seattle, Washington, United States, which opened in 1962. Given the difficult topographic and climatic conditions, parts had to be prefabricated. The outer skin of the circular upper floor is of aluminium-clad wooden panels. The roof originally was bare aluminium, but has since been coated. The rotative mechanism — a core with a annulus that completely rotates the upper floor in approximately an hour — allows every guest to have a view in turn. In 1990, the restaurant was enlarged to accommodate some 400 diners, while retaining its original architectural character.
The name &quot;Piz Gloria&quot; originated in Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;James Bond&quot; novel &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; (1963), in which it is the mountain-top hideout of the villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld and contains an allergy clinic. In the story, the location is the Languard range, above Pontresina somewhere in the Engadine near St. Moritz, where Romansh is spoken — &quot;piz&quot; is a local Romansh term for a mountain peak. However, the real restaurant is located in the Bernese Oberland, where Romansh is not spoken.

The movie production team found the restaurant partly constructed and contributed financially to its completion in return for exclusive use for filming the movie (released in 1969), in which the building has a prominent role.

After filming was completed, the restaurant retained the &quot;Piz Gloria&quot; name of the film location, and currently acknowledges the film&#x27;s significant contribution to its commercial reputation; the lower floor houses a James Bond exhibition containing memorabilia and film clips. In July 2015, a new and larger exhibition, called &quot;007 Walk of Fame&quot;, was opened. George Lazenby and members of the film crew attended the launch.

<text>Police Story () is a 1985 Hong Kong action Comedy film directed by and starring Jackie Chan, who co-wrote the screenplay with Edward Tang. It is the first film in the &quot;Police Story&quot; franchise. It features Chan as Hong Kong police detective &quot;Kevin&quot; Chan Ka-Kui, alongside Brigitte Lin and Maggie Cheung. In the film, Ka-Kui helps arrest a drug lord, but must clear his own name after being accused of murder.

Chan began work on the film after a disappointing experience working with James Glickenhaus on &quot;The Protector&quot; (1985), which was intended to be his entry into the American film market. &quot;Police Story&quot; contains many large-scale action sequences with elaborate, dangerous stunts performed by Chan and his stunt team, including car chases, Chan hanging off a speeding bus, parkour-like acrobatics, and a shopping mall fight with shattering glass panes, leading up to Chan sliding down a pole with exploding electric lights as he falls to the ground. Much of the film was created surrounding the action sequences, which Chan and the filmmakers developed via linear progression.

&quot;Police Story&quot; was a box-office success in Asia and Europe, grossing an estimated . It won the Best Film award at the 1986 Hong Kong Film Awards. According to Chan&#x27;s autobiography, he considers &quot;Police Story&quot; his best action film. Since its release, &quot;Police Story&quot; has been frequently listed as one of the greatest action films of all time. It is also considered one of the best martial arts movies of all time.
 In 2016, &quot;Police Story&quot; was voted the fifth best action movie of all time in &quot;Time Out&quot;″s poll of film critics, directors, actors and stunt performers. Chan&#x27;s final action sequence in the mall is considered one of the greatest stunts in the history of action cinema. A 4K restoration of the film had a limited theatrical release in North America on 1 February 2019. A sequel, &quot;Police Story 2,&quot; was released 1988.

==Plot==
The Royal Hong Kong Police Force is planning Operation Boar Hunt, a major undercover sting to arrest crime lord Chu Tao. Sergeant Chan Ka-Kui (or Kevin Chan in some versions) is part of the operation, along with undercover officers stationed in a shantytown. However, the criminals spot the officers and the shootout ensues between the two groups. Civilians either flee the town or are caught in the crossfire. Chu Tao and his men successfully flee in their car by driving through the town but crash it immediately after going downhill and escape on foot. Ka-Kui persists in his chase on foot as Chu Tao and his men attempt to escape in a double-decker bus. Ka-Kui manages to get in front of the bus and bring it to a halt by threatening to shoot the driver with his service revolver.

Later, Ka-Kui is reprimanded by Chief Inspector Raymond Li for letting the operation get out of hand, but is subsequently presented to the media as a model police officer to please the police brass. His next assignment is to protect Chu Tao&#x27;s secretary, Salina Fong, who is pressured to testify in court about Chu Tao&#x27;s illegal activities. At first, Salina insists that she does not require protection, but Ka-Kui has a fellow policeman break into her apartment and pose as a knife-wielding assassin. Ka-Kui and Salina fight him off and she agrees to be more cooperative. The two drive away in her car, but are ambushed by Chu Tao&#x27;s actual hitmen, who are scared away when Salina threatens them with Ka-Kui&#x27;s revolver.

When Ka-Kui arrives at his apartment with Salina, he is surprised to find his girlfriend, May, and her friends throwing a birthday party for him, but May becomes angry with Ka-Kui after seeing Salina only wearing lingerie and Ka-Kui&#x27;s jacket. Ka-Kui eventually explains to May that Salina is a witness, but only after much bumbling and embarrassment. While he tries to apologize to May, Salina discovers that the attack at her apartment was a sham, and decides to record over her taped confession about working for Chu Tao. She sneaks away while Ka-Kui is sleeping and is not present at the trial the next day, which ends with failure for the prosecution because of Salina&#x27;s absence and tampering with the recording.

Though Chu Tao is released on bail, he wants revenge against Ka-Kui. He captures Salina and threatens to kill her to ensure her silence. Ka-Kui finds and frees her, but is attacked by several of Chu Tao&#x27;s men. When fellow Police Inspector Man arrives (Kam Hing Ying), he reveals that he had been working with Chu Tao and thus Salina&#x27;s capture was merely a ruse to trap Ka-Kui. To Man&#x27;s grim surprise, the plan is also to include Tao&#x27;s men killing him with Ka-Kui&#x27;s gun to frame him for murder. Now a fugitive cop killer, Ka-Kui must try to catch Chu Tao and clear his name. He returns to the police station to plead his case, but the Chief Inspector orders him to be arrested. Ka-Kui takes the Chief Inspector as a hostage in order to escape custody, though he soon lets his co-operative superior go free to continue his investigation.

Salina goes to Chu Tao&#x27;s office at a shopping mall to download incriminating data from Chu Tao&#x27;s computer system. Chu Tao notices this and he and his men rush to the shopping mall to intervene. Ka-Kui and May, who are monitoring Chu Tao&#x27;s activities, follow. In the ensuing carnage, Ka-Kui defeats all of Chu Tao&#x27;s henchmen (and destroys a good portion of the mall). The briefcase containing the computer data falls to the bottom floor of the mall, but Chu Tao and his men retrieves it after attacking May. Ka-Kui, at the top floor, slides down a pole wrapped in light bulbs to the bottom floor and catches Chu, but the rest of the police force quickly arrives and prevent him from further taking matters into his own hands. Salina attests to them that Chu had Sergeant Man killed and evidence of his crimes is in the briefcase. Chu&#x27;s defense attorney shows up and accuses the police of misconduct, prompting a beating from an at-wit&#x27;s-end Ka-Kui, who goes on to extend the beating to Chu Tao before being stopped by his friends.

==Production==
The film contained many large-scale action scenes, including an opening sequence featuring a car chase through a shanty town, Chan dangling from a speeding double-decker bus before stopping it with his service revolver, and a climactic fight scene in a shopping mall. This final scene earned the film the nickname &quot;Glass Story&quot; by the crew, due to the huge number of panes of sugar glass that were broken. During a stunt in this last scene in which Chan slides down a pole from several stories up, the lights covering the pole had heated it considerably and resulted in Chan suffering second-degree burns, particularly to his hands. Chan also suffered a back injury and dislocation of his pelvis upon landing.

Screenwriter Edward Tang said that he did not write this film the way normal Hollywood screenwriters work. Chan instructed Tang to structure the film around a list of props and locations, e.g. a shopping mall, a village, a bus, etc.

In an interview with Chan, he discusses the stunt of sliding down the pole covered with lights. As with the clock tower stunt from &quot;Project A&quot; (1983), Chan described his fear at the thought of performing the stunt. During the filming of &quot;Police Story&quot;, there was the added pressure of strict time constraints, as the shopping mall had to be cleaned up and ready for business the following morning. One of Chan&#x27;s stuntmen gave him a hug and a Buddhist prayer paper, which he put in his trousers before finally performing the stunt.

Stuntman Blackie Ko doubled for Chan during a motorcycle stunt in which his character drives through glass towards a hitman. In the double decker bus scene, Jackie used a metal umbrella because a wooden one kept slipping when he tried to hang onto the bus.

==Box office==
The film grossed at the Hong Kong box office, becoming the third highest-grossing film of the year. In Taiwan, it grossed between 1985 and 1986, becoming one of the top ten highest-grossing films of 1986. In Japan, it was the eighth highest-grossing foreign film of 1986, grossing at the Japanese box office. In South Korea, it was the third highest-grossing film of 1988, with ticket sales in Seoul City.

In Europe, the film sold 245,452 tickets in France (released 1987), 846,700 tickets in Hungary (released 1988) and 65,700 tickets in Romania. In the United States, the film was screened in 1993 at the Hogg Memorial Auditorium in Austin, Texas, along with &quot;Police Story 3: Supercop&quot;, with both films well-received among Austin audiences at the time. The film later had a limited US release in 2019, grossing US$113,164.

==Critical reception==
Upon release, the film received critical acclaim in Hong Kong. At the 5th Hong Kong Film Awards in 1986, it won Best Picture and Best Action Choreography, out of six nominations.

Overseas, the film initially received a mixed reaction in contemporary English-language reviews. Kim Newman wrote, in the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot;, that &quot;Police Story&quot; starts well with its car chase described as an &quot;astonishing set-piece&quot;, but that &quot;once the mix of realistic settings and fantasy action seems to have been established, the film falls back on Chan&#x27;s clowning and turns into a slapstick comedy heavily dependent on cake-in-the-face jokes&quot;. The review concluded that the film &quot;still lacks much of the aesthetic appeal and occasional comic grace of the more traditional period kung fu films such as &quot;Project A&quot;, &quot;Drunken Master&quot;, &quot;Snake in the Eagle&#x27;s Shadow&quot; and &quot;Dragon Lord&quot;&quot;. Vincent Canby wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that at a screening of the film at the New York Film Festival Chan was promoted as a hybrid of Buster Keaton and Clint Eastwood, with Canby noting that Chan was &quot;more like a scaled-down, oriental Sylvester Stallone, with energy and a willingness to smile fondly at himself&quot;. Canby also noted the excessive pie-in-the-face gags, and that Chan &quot;participates in several elaborately staged gun fights and car chases&quot; which were &quot;mildly amusing&quot; but not as amusing as the dubbed dialogue. Canby concluded that the film &quot;is of principal interest as a souvenir of another culture&quot;.

The film went on to receive wide acclaim in later reviews. Michael Zey reviewed the film in &quot;The Daily Texan&quot; and rated it three-and-a-half stars in 1993, calling it a &quot;great action thriller&quot; that leaves &quot;most American action films in the dust.&quot; He praised the &quot;absolutely stunning&quot; action scenes, saying the &quot;film must have set a new record for the number of people thrown through windows in a single action film&quot; as Chan eventually &quot;perfects another action scene&quot; with his final stunt. He also praised Chan&#x27;s unique humor with the &quot;long complicated scenes of physical comedy&quot; rather than the usual &quot;awful one-liner your average hero spouts after wasting a bad guy.&quot; He called it &quot;great action entertainment&quot; but noted &quot;many people&quot; would &quot;snub it because they&#x27;ll have to read subtitles.&quot; He concluded that &quot;Jackie Chan is the true last action hero.&quot;

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on 27 reviews, with an average rating of 7.57/10; among top critics, it holds a 100% approval rating based on 6 reviews, with an 8.3/10 rating. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Blending brilliant physical comedy with thrillingly choreographed set pieces, &quot;Police Story&quot; makes a persuasive case for Jackie Chan as one of the all-time genre greats.&quot; On Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the film received a score of 78 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

A review from the &quot;Time Out Film Guide&quot; stated: &quot;In Jackie Chan-land vehicles are for trashing small buildings, while big buildings are for falling off or sliding down... The likeable and graceful Chan directs, sings and performs jaw-dropping stunts&quot;. In advance of the film&#x27;s 4K restoration release in 2018, Matt Zoller Seitz of &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, saying that &quot;Police Story&quot; &quot;is one of the great 1980s action films. It is also one of the &quot;most&quot; 1980s action films&quot;, commenting its &quot;cop-on-the-edge clichés&quot; and synthesizer music. Seitz further wrote that &quot;The entire film has the mentality of a master showman who wants to dazzle in every moment, big or small... A stunt near the end gets repeated at full length three times, from three different angles; this would seem like a display of narcissism if it weren’t one of the greatest stunts in the history of movies, right up there with the collapsing house in &quot;Steamboat Bill, Jr.&quot; and the final fall in &quot;Sharky’s Machine&quot;&quot;.

In 2016, when &quot;Time Out&quot; polled 50 film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films of all time, &quot;Police Story&quot; was voted the fourth best action film of all time. Film critic Trevor Johnston wrote that &quot;you have to go back to the silent-comedy era of Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton to find the equivalent of Jackie Chan in his Hong Kong prime—a star who’d put life and limb at risk to get the shot he wanted&quot;—and that &quot;Chan’s ’80s peak delivers a whole other level of insanity.&quot; He praised &quot;the exuberant blend of comic knockabout thrills and heart-stopping spills from this landmark cop flick,&quot; especially his &quot;batshit crazy&quot; final stunt which &quot;has since become celluloid legend.&quot;

=== Home video ===
The film was released on VHS in the United States by the distributor Cinema Group under the title &quot;Jackie Chan&#x27;s Police Force&quot;, using Golden Harvest&#x27;s export version created for international distribution, and featuring a new music score by composer Kevin Bassinson. The export cut is shorter than the original cut by 13 minutes.

New Line Cinema acquired the rights to the export version of the film, distributing it on VHS and Laserdisc on 4 August 1998, with a recycled soundtrack score from J. Peter Robinson replacing Bassinson&#x27;s music. On 19 December 2006, The Weinstein Company released the film on Region 1 NTSC DVD (under their Dragon Dynasty label) with special features and deleted scenes; it was also released in Canada on 23 January 2007.

In late 2004, Hong Kong&#x27;s Intercontinental Video Limited released a remastered anamorphic widescreen &quot;Police Story Trilogy&quot; boxed set in Region 0 NTSC format, featuring optional English subtitles and a choice of Chinese-language soundtracks. Hong Kong-based company Kam &amp; Ronsom Enterprise released the first three &quot;Police Story&quot; films on Blu-ray Disc in June 2009. The first film was released on Blu-ray on 14 September 2009.

Shout! Factory released &quot;Police Story&quot; and &quot;Police Story 2&quot; as a double feature on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on 16 April 2013.

The release also includes bonus features on Jackie Chan himself; new programs on his screen persona and action-filmmaking techniques, a stunt reel, and archival interviews with Chan and stuntman Benny Lai, as well as a 1964 TV program about Peking opera training that was akin to the education Chan received as a child.

==Sequels==
===&quot;Police Story 2&quot;===

&quot;Police Story 2&quot; (), made in 1988, features many of the same actors reprising their roles from the original. The story picks up with Chan Ka-Kui demoted to traffic cop for causing so much damage in his apprehension of Chu. Chu has been released from prison on the pretense that he is terminally ill, and Chu and his clan continue to harass Chan and his girlfriend May as Chan gets reinstated to the detective unit when criminal bombers begin extorting money from businessmen.

===&quot;Police Story 3: Super Cop&quot;===

&quot;Police Story 3&quot; () was made in 1992. Michelle Yeoh joins the cast, portraying a police officer from Mainland China. The story involves Chan and Yeoh&#x27;s characters going undercover to break up a drug smuggling ring in Malaysia. The action moves from China to Kuala Lumpur, where Chan&#x27;s girlfriend May is kidnapped. The film marks the last appearance of Maggie Cheung as May. Michelle Yeoh reprises her role in the spin-off, &quot;Project S&quot; (1993). Dimension Films released &quot;Police Story 3&quot; in the US in 1996 under the name of &quot;Supercop&quot; with some edits to the film, the complete replacement of all music and sound effects, and English dubbing.

===&quot;Police Story 4: First Strike&quot;===

&quot;Police Story 4&quot; (), made in 1996, is the only film in the &quot;Police Story&quot; series made partially in English. The action shifts away from Hong Kong and East Asia, with a globe trekking espionage plot, lending the film the air of a James Bond adventure. New Line Cinema&#x27;s US release contained several alterations. Filmed on location in Ukraine and Australia, the film also marks the last appearance of Bill Tung, who plays Chan&#x27;s superior in the series.

===&quot;New Police Story&quot;===

&quot;New Police Story&quot; (), made in 2004, is a reboot of the &quot;Police Story&quot; series. Chan portrays a disgraced detective named Wing, and acts alongside younger Hong Kong actors including Nicholas Tse, Charlene Choi and Daniel Wu. The story features a more dramatic focus, taking a darker and more serious tone.

===&quot;Police Story 2013&quot;===

&quot;Police Story 2013&quot; (&quot;Police Story: Lockdown&quot; in North America) is a 2013 Chinese-Hong Kong action crime film starring Jackie Chan in another reboot of the &quot;Police Story&quot; film series. The film is directed by Ding Sheng, who previously helmed Chan&#x27;s &quot;Little Big Soldier&quot;. According to Chan, unlike the previous &quot;Police Story&quot; films where he portrayed a Hong Kong cop, in the new film he portrays a mainland Chinese officer. Like &quot;New Police Story&quot;, &quot;2013&quot; is a stand-alone installment with a darker tone than the previous installments, which were comedies.

==Popular culture==
* The shanty town chase inspired a similar sequence in &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;. A similar scene also appeared in the 2004 Thai film &quot;Born to Fight&quot;.
* Jackie Chan fan Brandon Lee paid homage in his film &quot;Rapid Fire&quot; by filming a similar sequence from the mall fight scene, in which Jackie&#x27;s character rams a villain with a motorcycle, through multiple layers of glass.
* The scene where Chan stops a bus inspired a similar scene in the Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell film &quot;Tango &amp; Cash&quot;.
* Between 1994 and 2004, the Hong Kong TV series &quot;Police Report&quot; adopted the &quot;Police Story&quot; theme song sung by Jackie Chan, as its own theme. Since 2009, the same song is re-adopted as the theme song of &quot;Police Report&quot;, but sung by Hacken Lee. Televised job advertisements for the Hong Kong Police also adopted segments of the song.
* According to film critic Danny Leigh of &quot;Financial Times&quot;, the film &quot;Uncharted&quot; (2022) has action scenes inspired by &quot;Police Story&quot;. The film&#x27;s lead actor Tom Holland confirmed that Jackie Chan was an inspiration for several action scenes.

<text>The Schilthorn () is a summit in Europe, in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland. It overlooks the valley of Lauterbrunnen in the Bernese Oberland, and is the highest mountain in the range lying north of the Sefinenfurgge Pass. The Schilthorn lies above the village of Mürren, from where a cable car leads to its summit, holding the record of the steepest cable car in the world.

Administratively, the summit is within the municipality of Lauterbrunnen, although the western slopes are within the municipality of Reichenbach im Kandertal. Both municipalities are in the canton of Bern.

The summit has a panoramic view which spans from the Titlis, Jungfrau, Mönch, Eiger, over the Bernese Alps and the Jura mountains up to the Vosges Mountains and the Black Forest. Mont Blanc is also just visible.

== Access ==
To get to the Schilthorn from the valley floor, a series of cable cars must be taken. The cable cars begin in Stechelberg leaving to Gimmelwald and then onto Mürren. Since its renovation in 2024, it holds the record of the steepest cable car in the world, with a gradient of 159.4%.

From Mürren another cable car is taken to Birg, which is the final change before the Schilthorn. This cable airway is the longest and was the most technically challenging airway to be built. The other way up is to take the cable car from Lauterbrunnen to Grütschalp and a train to Mürren, from where the cable car must be taken. Between Birg and the summit, the cable car passes over Grauseeli, a small lake.

It is also possible to hike to the peak, along the myriad of small, but well-marked paths to the top. The hike to the top takes roughly five hours from Gimmelwald for a fit walker.

==&quot;Piz Gloria&quot;==
The panoramic revolving restaurant at the summit, &quot;Piz Gloria&quot;, was featured in the 1969 James Bond movie &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;. A black ski run featured in the film starts at the summit and leads down to the Engetal below Birg. The restaurant revolves a full 360 degrees in 45 minutes, slightly faster than the minute hand of a clock. 

After considering a number of locations, the stalled construction of the sports bar atop the Schilthorn was chosen when the film&#x27;s producer financed the completion of the famous revolving platform, for the right to use the facility for his next film, the first and only Bond film starring George Lazenby.

A number of scenes in the film were photographed by cameraman John Jordan hanging below a speeding helicopter. Jordan had previously lost a foot to a helicopter rotor while filming the previous Bond movie &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;. Within a year and fitted with a prosthetic limb, Jordan lost his footing and fell to his death when filming similar aerial imagery used in the film &quot;Catch-22&quot;.

==Inferno races==
During the winter, the Schilthorn is the traditional start for the world&#x27;s longest downhill ski race, the &quot;Inferno,&quot; which started in 1928. It is the largest amateur alpine ski race in the world.

During the summer, the Inferno Triathlon finishes at the summit after a run up from the Lauterbrunnen valley.

<text>Matthew Tapunu&#x27;u Anoaʻi (April 7, 1970 – April 17, 2017) was an American professional wrestler. He was best known for his tenure in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), under the ring name Rosey.

Anoa&#x27;i was a member of the Anoaʻi family, a renowned Samoan wrestling family. Anoa&#x27;i, along with his late cousins Eddie Fatu and Matt Fatu, was trained at the Wild Samoan Training Facility headed by his uncle, Afa Anoaʻi. Following his training, he competed in Afa&#x27;s World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) promotion. He began competing in tag team competition with Samu as the Samoan Gangsta Party. The team had a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). Throughout the mid-1990s, Anoaʻi competed in various independent promotions and international promotions including World Wrestling Council and Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling, winning various tag team championships. In 2001, Anoaʻi signed with the WWE and was assigned to Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) in Cincinnati, Ohio. While situated at HWA, he was placed in tag team competition, alongside Fatu, and the duo won the HWA Tag Team Championship.

After signing with WWE in 2002, Anoaʻi and Fatu were called up to the Raw roster. Known as 3-Minute Warning, they were utilized as enforcers for then-General Manager Eric Bischoff. Following the release of Fatu in 2003, Anoaʻi was &quot;discovered&quot; by The Hurricane and from there on they competed together as a team, known as The Hurricane and Rosey. After two years of teaming, they won the World Tag Team Championship, but disbanded shortly after losing the championship. Anoaʻi then did not re-sign his WWE contract in March 2006. 

Following his stint with WWE, Anoaʻi took time off to spend with his young children coaching his oldest sons teams. Anoa&#x27;i then continued his wrestling career, appearing at several independent promotions, including All Japan Pro Wrestling, Great Championship Wrestling, BAW Championship Wrestling, Appalachian Wrestling Federation, and Ohio Valley Wrestling. Aside from professional wrestling, Anoaʻi was a featured contestant on the reality television series &quot;Fat March&quot; where he lost 100 pounds but further injured his left knee.

==Early life==
Anoaʻi is part of the Anoaʻi family. He is the son of former Samoan professional wrestler Sika Anoa‘i, who competed as one half of the Wild Samoans, and Patricia Hooker. His younger brother, Joe Anoaʻi, was the starting defensive tackle for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team and is also a professional wrestler who works for the WWE under the name Roman Reigns. Anoaʻi inducted the Wild Samoans (his father Sika and his uncle Afa) into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007. Other cousins include The Usos, Solo Sikoa, Rikishi, Tama, Yokozuna, Akane, and Umaga.

Growing up, Anoaʻi played football alongside Emmitt Smith at Escambia High School in Pensacola, Florida. He hoped to play in the National Football League and played college football for Hawaii. He worked at various nightclubs in New Orleans before deciding to train as a professional wrestler.

==Professional wrestling career==
===Early career (1995–2001)===
Anoaʻi trained with his cousin Eddie Fatu at the Wild Samoan professional wrestling school operated by members of their family. When their training was completed, they debuted in their uncle Afa&#x27;s World Xtreme Wrestling (WXW) promotion. One of his first matches was for the World Wrestling Council (WWC) promotion in Puerto Rico. Competing under the name &quot;Kuhio&quot;, he had two matches for the promotion in November 1995. He first challenged Pulgarcito for the WWC Television Championship on November 24 and then took on future WWC Television Champion Jim Steele on November 25 but lost both. He later began teaming with Samu as the Samoan Gangsta Party, using the name Mack Daddy Kane. It was in the Samoan Gangsta Party where Anoa&#x27;i won his first title when he and Samu competed in International World Class Championship Wrestling where they won the vacant IWCCW Tag Team Championship in a tournament on December 26, 1995, and ultimately would be the last champions before the promotion shut down. 

The Samoan Gangsta Party had a brief stint in Extreme Championship Wrestling in the summer and fall of 1996, feuding with various tag teams, including The Gangstas, as well as the Eliminators and the Bruise Brothers. They debuted at Hardcore Heaven on June 22, 1996, taking on Axl Rotten and Hack Meyers which went to a No Contest. They returned on July 12, going a no contest with Big Dick Dudley and Buh Buh Ray Dudley. The following night at Heat Wave, they lost to The Gangstas. On August 3 at The Doctor Is In, Anoa&#x27;i and Samu took part in a four way for the ECW World Tag Team Championship against The Eliminators, The Gangstas, and The Bruise Brothers which was won by The Gangstas. From August to October, The Samoan Gangsta Party continued to get shots at the Tag Team Championship but were never able to win them. On September 20, Anoa&#x27;i would take on The Sandman but came up short.

Anoa&#x27;i returned to WXW in 1997, where he held the WXW Tag Team Championship as one half of the Samoan Gangstas with his cousin L. A. Smooth on two occasions. They defeated the Love Connection to begin their first title reign on May 24, and the Mad Russian and the Russian Eliminator on September 17 to begin their second. He also returned to the WWC in Puerto Rico during 1997, winning the WWC World Tag Team Championship with Tahiti as The Islanders on June 22 defeating Le Ley and Ricky Santana. They held the titles for two months before losing them to The Youngbloods by forfeit on August 16. Anoa&#x27;i and Smooth then went to the National Wrestling League where they won the vacant NWL Tag Team Championship by defeated The Grungers on December 12, 1997. They held the belts for three months until they were vacant in March 1998

In March 1999, Anoa&#x27;i traveled to Japan to wrestle for Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling (FMW). He originally teamed with Fatu as &quot;Armageddon&quot; with Fatu as Armageddon I and Anao&#x27;i as Armageddon II. He debuted on March 20, 1999, during FMW&#x27;s Round Robin Tag League tour teaming with Fatu and Ricky Fuji in a losing effort to Hideki Hosaka, Hisakatsu Oya, and Super Leather. After scoring one-on-one wins over Hosaka and Fuji, Anoa&#x27;i took part in a round robin tournament for the FMW Brass Knuckles Tag Team Championship but only finished with 2 points. In the summer of 1999, Anoa&#x27;i teamed with Fatu and Super Leather in a round robin tournament for the WEW 6-Man Tag Team Championship but missed the semifinals after losing a decision match to Hayabusa, Masato Tanaka, and Tetsuhiro Kuroda. In May 2000, Anoa&#x27;i and Fatu would drop the Armageddon gimmick and began competing as &quot;The Samoans&quot; with Anoa&#x27;i changing his name to Matty Samu while Fatu became Eddie Fatu. On June 21, Anoa&#x27;i and Fatu defeated Hosaka and Yoshinori Sasaki to win the FMW Hardcore Tag Team Championship. The two would hold the titles for a month and made two successful title defenses before dropping the titles back to Hosaka and Sasaki on July 28.

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2006)===
====Island Boys (2001–2002)====
Anoaʻi, along with Fatu, signed developmental contracts with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and were assigned to Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA), adopting the tag team name The Island Boyz, and with Anoaʻi using the ring name Kimo. They won the HWA Tag Team Championship in November 2001, by defeating Evan Karagias and Shannon Moore. They also competed for Memphis Championship Wrestling (MCW), holding the MCW Southern Tag Team Championship on three occasions.

====3-Minute Warning (2002–2003)====
Kimo (renamed Rosey) and Fatu (renamed Jamal) made their WWE debut on the July 22, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot; as 3-Minute Warning, a pair of villainous savages. The name Rosey was inspired by Rosey Grier, an American football player. They were &quot;hired&quot; as Eric Bischoff&#x27;s enforcers, attacking random wrestlers each week, after Bischoff either gave people three minutes to entertain him before they were attacked or decided that three minutes of a segment was enough before the team appeared to end it. They attacked numerous wrestlers at the orders of Bischoff, including D&#x27;Lo Brown and Shawn Stasiak. They also attacked non-wrestlers, including ring announcer Lilian Garcia and retired wrestlers Jimmy Snuka, Mae Young and The Fabulous Moolah. They also attacked two lesbians, which Anoaʻi later cited as his favorite 3-Minute Warning run-in.

In September, 3-Minute Warning began a feud with Billy and Chuck, interfering in their storyline commitment ceremony, and defeating them at the Unforgiven pay-per-view event. Rico, Billy and Chuck&#x27;s former manager, also began to manage 3-Minute Warning during this time. They competed regularly in Raw&#x27;s tag team division until June 2003, when Jamal was released from his WWE contract.

====Teaming with The Hurricane (2003–2006)====

Later in 2003, The Hurricane &quot;discovered&quot; Rosey&#x27;s potential as a superhero and christened him as &quot;Rosey, the Super Hero in Training&quot; (the S.H.I.T.). Rosey was involved in numerous sketches involving him training to be a superhero, including helping an old lady to cross the street and attempting to get changed into his superhero costume in a phonebox. Rosey and The Hurricane teamed regularly together during this time, wrestling against teams including Chris Jericho and Christian and Evolution. On the July 19, 2004, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Rosey appeared with a new costume, seemingly graduated to a full superhero, officially turning him into a fan favorite.

On May 1, 2005, at the Backlash pay-per-view, Rosey and Hurricane defeated La Résistance in the finals of a Tag Team Turmoil match to win the World Tag Team Championship. They were joined for a short while by WWE Diva Stacy Keibler, who they referred to as Super Stacy. Stacy, however, was then drafted to the SmackDown! brand. On September 5, 2005, Rosey and The Hurricane were defeated by Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch, during their debut match on &quot;Raw&quot;. This match earned the pair a tag team title shot at Unforgiven. During the title match, Murdoch delivered an elevated DDT on The Hurricane to the outside. The DDT caused Hurricane to suffer a storyline &quot;stinger&quot; and allowed Cade and Murdoch to beat the injured Hurricane later in the match to win the World Tag Team Title from him and Rosey.

The loss of the title eventually brought the team to an end, as they began a losing streak caused by Hurricane&#x27;s injuries. During the October 17, 2005, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle at the request of WWE Chairman Vince McMahon. After the beating footage was shown, Hurricane ripped off his mask and struck Rosey (who had come to the ring to his aid). The following week, Hurricane did not show up for a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions Cade and Murdoch alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared at the top of the entrance ramp, now going by the name Gregory Helms as he watched Rosey get double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up of being funny for the crowd, and that he had been carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. On the November 7, 2005, episode, Helms defeated Rosey in their first encounter since teaming together.

Shortly after this turmoil, Jamal was rehired by WWE, and he and Rosey were scheduled to reunite 3-Minute Warning. The duo wrestled as a tag team during a dark match before the January 9, 2006, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. However, on March 21, 2006, Rosey was released from his WWE contract, and the hinted return of 3-Minute Warning never made it to television.

===All Japan Pro Wrestling (2006–2007)===
Anoaʻi began competing for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) in 2006, using the name RO-Z. He made his debut on June 25, 2006, during the Crossover tour as a member of RO&amp;D where he teamed with Taiyo Kea in a winning effort against Arashi and Satoshi Kojima with Anoa&#x27;i scoring the win over Arashi. Two months later, Anoa&#x27;i betrayed RO&amp;D and defected to the Voodoo Murders. On September 17, Anoa&#x27;i teamed with Taru, Suwama, and &quot;brother&quot; Yasshi against Taka Michinoku, Taiyo Kea, D-Lo Brown, and Buchanan in a &quot;losing team must disband&quot; match where Anoa&#x27;i pinned Kea after Brown and Buchanan turned on Michinoku and Kea. In October, Anoa&#x27;i began pursuing Minoru Suzuki and the Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship. On October 29, Anoa&#x27;i challenged Suzuki for the Triple Crown Championship but was defeated. He teamed up with Suwama to wrestle in the 2006 World&#x27;s Strongest Tag Determination League where they placed first with nine points and Anao&#x27;i even scored a win over Keiji Mutoh along the way. Due to placing first, they made it to the finals where they were defeated by Satoshi Kojima and Hiroyoshi Tenzan. He continued to compete for AJPW throughout 2007, including in the 2007 January 4 Dome Show at the Tokyo Dome, where he teamed with Taru, Suwama, and Giant Bernard to defeat Riki Choshu, Manabu Nakanishi, Takashi Iizuka, and Naofumi Yamamoto. On February 17 at &quot;Pro Wrestling Love in Ryogoku Vol. 2&quot;, Anoa&#x27;i teamed with Suwama to take on Taiyo Kea and Toshiaki Kawada for the vacant World Tag Team Championship but came up short. Anoaʻi participated in the AJPW 2007 Champion Carnival tournament as a member of Block B, but he finished with two points in the series, coming last in Block B though he did score a win over Kawada. His last match was on March 30 teaming with TARU and Suwama in a winning effort over Akira Raijin, Kiyonari Sanada, and T28.

===Later career (2006–2017)===

During 2006 and 2007, he also competed for a number of independent promotions, including Great Championship Wrestling, BAW Championship Wrestling, and the Appalachian Wrestling Federation. He also returned to Heartland Wrestling Association for a few matches from 2006 to 2007 with one of the appearances being him challenging Jon Moxley for the HWA Heavyweight Championship on June 10, 2006, at &quot;HWA Road to Destiny&quot;.

He wrestled a dark match being billed under his real name for WWE on August 20, 2007, before an episode of &quot;Raw&quot;; he was defeated by Johnny Jeter. He returned the following day for the August 21 &quot;SmackDown!&quot; taping, where he was again defeated by Jeter. Anoaʻi began wrestling in Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in September 2007, WWE&#x27;s developmental territory, although he was not under contract with WWE. He wrestled several tag team matches with Afa Jr. as the Sons of Samoa, before leaving the promotion.

He returned to wrestling on the independent circuit, competing for companies including EWF. On Saturday, October 31, 2009, Anoaʻi (wrestling as Rosie – Super Hero In Training) made his debut for the Dynamic Wrestling Alliance defeating &quot;Sexy&quot; Sean Casey at the DWA&#x27;s &quot;Monster Ball&quot; event in Cincinnati, which became the promotion&#x27;s first televised event. His final match was on July 9, 2016, where he reunited with The Hurricane as the two teamed with Vinny Pacifico in a winning effort against Chris Benne, JGeorge, and Steve Scott.

Before his death, Rosey was running a wrestling promotion called Epic Championship Wrestling in Florida with his father, Sika.

==Other media==
Anoaʻi was a contestant in the ABC reality series, &quot;Fat March&quot; in 2007. The show featured 12 overweight people attempt to walk about in nine states, in order to lose weight and get fit, while competing for a prize pool of US$1.2 million. A press release for the show stated that Anoaʻi was participating because &quot;it wasn&#x27;t safe for him to compete&quot; as a professional wrestler, and he needed to &quot;lose weight to return to his career&quot;. Due to knee injuries, he quit during the fifth episode.

Outside of wrestling, Anoaʻi was involved in several business ventures including a restaurant in Cincinnati called Island Boi BBQ but returned to Florida to be closer to his family and was working with his father in Pensacola.

==Personal life and death==
Anoaʻi&#x27;s father was Samoan professional wrestler Sika Anoa‘i and his mother was Patricia Hooker. He was the brother of Joe Anoaʻi, better known in the WWE as Roman Reigns. Anoaʻi was half-Samoan and half-Italian. His ex-wife, Amanda Vandeberg Schall, current wife of former MMA fighter Kerry Schall, is from Mason, Ohio. They had two sons together, Jordan Iles and Koa Rodney Anoa&#x27;i, and a daughter Madison Alani Anoa&#x27;i.

In January 2014, Anoaʻi was hospitalized due to congestive heart failure (with which he had been diagnosed years earlier) and atrial fibrillation. Anoai&#x27;s CHF was related to weight gain as he struggled with a chronic knee injury that also caused hip issues. He died on April 17, 2017, 10 days after his 47th birthday, in Pensacola, Florida, due to complications related to congestive heart failure.

<text>Seilbahn Mürren-Allmendhubel (SMA), also Allmendhubelbahn, is a funicular in Bernese Oberland in Switzerland.

The Allmendhubelbahn was brought into service in 1912, in order to simplify trade with other communes. It was soon used by many tourists and mountain hikers, and in the winter by skiers. It begins in Mürren (at above sea level) with a maximum upward gradient of 61% up to the Allmendhubel (at ). The gauge line is long.

In 1999 the old red cars were replaced by new panoramic cars.

<text>Heloísa Eneida Paes Pinto Mendes Pinheiro (born July 7, 1943), better known as Helô Pinheiro (), is a Brazilian businesswoman and former model.

==Biography== 
At the age of 17, Pinheiro became the source of inspiration for the song &quot;The Girl from Ipanema&quot; when songwriters Antônio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes saw her walking to the beach in Ipanema, her native neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro.

Pinheiro became a Brazilian Playboy Playmate in 1987 and once again in 2003, when she did a pictorial along with her daughter Ticiane Pinheiro.

She also appeared in the second season of &quot;The Amazing Race&quot;, for the Beach portion of the first Detour clue, and on &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model, Cycle 12&quot;, for a modelling challenge in Brazil.

== Girl from Ipanema legal case ==
In 2001, the song&#x27;s copyright owners (the heirs of the composers) sued Pinheiro for using the title of the song &quot;Garota de Ipanema&quot; as the name of her boutique. In their complaint, they stated that her status as the inspiration for the song did not entitle her to use the title of the song commercially.

Public support was strongly in favor of Pinheiro. A press release by the composers, Jobim and de Moraes, that named Pinheiro as the original &quot;girl from Ipanema&quot; (&quot;garota de Ipanema&quot;) was cited as evidence that they had intended to bestow this title on her. The court ruled in favor of Pinheiro.

<doc id="665880" wikidata="Q1524782" url="?curid=665880" title="Gimmelwald">
<text>Gimmelwald is a small traffic-free village in the Bernese Oberland in the Canton of Bern, Switzerland, and is located between Stechelberg and Mürren, at an elevation of 1363 meters (4472 feet). The village is at the foot of the UNESCO World Heritage site the Jungfrau-Aletsch Protected Area. Gimmelwald is an allemanic linear village and a walser settlement first mentioned in a bill of sale in 1346. Because of its very typical and exceptional townscape, Gimmelwald is part of the inventory of Swiss heritage.

Gimmelwald is one of the few traffic-free villages in Switzerland where access by car is not possible due to a missing road connection. The Schilthorn cable car stops in Gimmelwald, where it is possible to board another cable car which runs between Gimmelwald and Mürren. Farming and tourism are the main source of income today. Farmers raise hay on tiny plots of land to feed small herds of cows. In winter, farmers often work as well for the Schilthorn cable car by performing jobs like running ski lifts or ski-slope grooming.

In the year 2003 the population of Gimmelwald was 130. The local school closed in 2010 due to the small number of students and students now attend the school in Lauterbrunnen. The school building was bought in 2019 by a cooperative to convert it into flats and to prevent it from being used as a holiday flat.

==Traffic and accessibility==
There is a walking path between Gimmelwald and Mürren, but lacking connection to the main road system, the main transportation to Gimmelwald is the Luftseilbahn Stechelberg-Mürren-Schilthorn (LSMS) aerial tramway famous for connecting the Lauterbrunnen valley to the Schilthorn.

The cable car connects Gimmelwald with the neighbouring elevated village Mürren and the village Stechelberg, which is situated at the floor of the Lauterbrunnen valley.

From Stechelberg a bus connects Lauterbrunnen where there are connections to the rest of Switzerland.

==Politics==
Gimmelwald, together with Wengen, Mürren, Isenfluh, Stechelberg, and Lauterbrunnen, belongs to the municipality of Lauterbrunnen. The parish covers the entire valley.

==Tourism==
The main source of income for Gimmelwald is tourism, and the village has a small hotel, former pension (now a British run hotel), a bed &amp; breakfast and the Mountain Hostel. Gimmelwald was stopped from being developed into a large ski resort by having it declared an avalanche zone which is only partly the case. In summer, Gimmelwald is mostly visited by tourists from North America, and in winter is mostly visited by European and Swiss tourists for winter sports.

Gimmelwald has a 2.2 km long via ferrata connecting the neighbouring village of Mürren.

<doc id="665882" wikidata="Q1938404" url="?curid=665882" title="Social informatics">
<text>Social informatics is the study of information and communication tools in cultural or institutional contexts. Another definition is the interdisciplinary study of the design, uses and consequences of information technologies that takes into account their interaction with institutional and cultural contexts. A transdisciplinary field, social informatics is part of a larger body of socio-economic research that examines the ways in which the technological artifact and human social context mutually constitute the information and communications technology (ICT) ensemble. Some proponents of social informatics use the relationship of a biological community to its environment as an analogy for the relationship of tools to people who use them. The Center for Social Informatics founded by the late Dr. Rob Kling, an early champion of the field&#x27;s ideas, defines the field thus:

:Social Informatics (SI) refers to the body of research and study that examines social aspects of computerization – including the roles of information technology in social and organizational change, the uses of information technologies in social contexts, and the ways that the social organization of information technologies is influenced by social forces and social practices.

==Research==
Historically, Western European concepts of social informatics research has been strong in the Scandinavian countries and the UK. The beginnings can be traced to the 1980s in Norway and Slovenia. The fundamentals of social informatics in the USA were laid by Kling in 1996 with his colleagues and students from Indiana University. Within North America, the field is represented largely through independent research efforts at a number of diverse institutions. There are several approaches, which were historically named or classified as social informatics: American, Russian, British, Norwegian, Slovenian, German and Japanese. The oldest concept of social informatics was founded in the USSR by A.V. Sokolov and his colleagues in the 1970s.

Social informatics research diverges from earlier, deterministic (both social and technological) models for measuring the social impacts of technology. Such technological deterministic models characterized information technologies as tools to be installed and used with a pre-determined set of impacts on society which are dictated by the technology&#x27;s stated capabilities. Similarly, the socially deterministic theory represented by some proponents of the social construction of technology (SCOT) or social shaping of technology theory as advocated by Williams &amp; Edge (1996) see technology the product of human social forces. In contrast, some social informatics methodologies consider the context surrounding technology and the material properties of the technology to be equally important: the people who will interact with a system, the organizational policies governing work practice, and support resources. This contextual inquiry produces &quot;nuanced conceptual understanding&quot; of systems that can be used to examine issues like access to technology, electronic forms of communication, and large-scale networks.

Research in social informatics can be categorized into three orientations. Normative research focuses on the development of theories based on empirical analysis that may be used to develop organizational policies and work practices. The heart of such analyses lies in socio-technical interaction networks, a framework built around the idea that humans and the technologies they build are &quot;co-constitutive&quot;, bound together, and that any examination of one must necessarily consider the other. Studies of the analytical orientation develop theory or define methodologies to contribute to theorizing in institutional settings. Critical analysis, like Lucy Suchman’s examination of articulation work, examine technological solutions from non-traditional perspectives in order to influence design and implementation.

==Future==
Social informatics is a young intellectual movement and its future is still being defined. However, because SST theorists such as Williams and Edge suggest that the amorphous boundaries between humans and technology that emerge in social shaping technology research indicate that technology is not a distinct social endeavor worthy of individual study, indicating that there is a need for social informatics research that bridges the gap between technological and social determinism. This observation, coupled with the many fields that contribute research, suggest a future in which social informatics theories and concepts settle to form a substrate, an &quot;indispensable analytical foundation&quot; for work in other disciplines. Such foundations can be found in social informatics frameworks such as The Web of Computing perspective or Socio-Technical Interaction Networks.

Relevant topics about future direction of social informatics are discussed in the book by Fichman and Rosenbaum. Conceptualization of international discourse, including current trends in research and direction of social informatics development is presented in an article by Smutny. This article discusses current possibilities of development of social informatics within the international discourse of various concepts including possible areas for future cooperation. Other topical article by Marcinkowski presents a perspective shift from studying only the effects of the implementation and use of technology to the primary discussion of what are the ideological implications of empirical work in social informatics connected with data analytics approach.

==In education==
Social informatics is also about teaching social issues of computing to computer science students. Depending on educational traditions, social informatics is scattered in the curriculum of different disciplines, as well as in computer science, information science, informatics (Europe) and web sociology. In some instances there might be a lack of understanding of why teaching social issues of computing is important, both by individual lecturers and students, resulting in a view that social informatics is boring and without importance. Some researchers have pointed out that in order to create awareness of the importance of social issues of computing, one has to focus on didactics of social informatics.

<text>Twin Dragons is a 1992 Hong Kong action comedy film directed by Ringo Lam and Tsui Hark, and starring Jackie Chan in a double role as identical twin brothers separated at birth.

The film also goes by titles such as Brother vs. Brother, Duel of Dragons, When Dragons Collide and Double Dragons.

==Plot==
In 1965, a Hong Kong couple are doting on their newborn identical twin boys. Meanwhile, a dangerous gang leader named Crazy Kung is being transported as a captive in the same hospital. Crazy Kung escapes and attempts to take one of the twins hostage, and in the ensuing chaos the twins are permanently separated. One of the twins, named Ma Yau, is taken to America by his parents and grows up to be a concert pianist and conductor. The other twin, Ma Wan, is found and raised by an alcoholic woman named Tsui, and becomes a street racer and martial artist named Bok Min. For years, neither of them is aware that he has an identical twin brother.

26 years later, the twins&#x27; lives intersect again: Bok Min and his best friend Tarzan get mixed up with a dangerous gang, while Ma Yau prepares to conduct a major concert in Hong Kong. In addition, the twins gain romantic interests: Bok Min meets Barbara, a club singer Tarzan is interested in, and Yau becomes acquainted with Tong Sum, a young woman from a respectable family who has a secret passion for fighter types. Eventually, the twins meet and discover that they share a strange connection with each other. As a result, a string of comedic mix-ups ensues when Ma Yau is accidentally enlisted by the gangsters to participate as an escape driver in the liberation of none other than Crazy Kung; Bok Min in turn is forced to conduct Yau&#x27;s concert (which becomes a smash hit despite him having absolutely no musical talent); and the two of them end up with the other&#x27;s girl as their respective love interest.

Eventually, things come to a head when the gangsters kidnap Tarzan to make Ma Yau surrender a briefcase meant for Crazy Kung, which Ma Yau had accidentally nabbed. The twins join up to defeat the gang that has turned their lives upside down, and in a showdown in a vehicle testing center Crazy Kung dies in a runaway crash test car. The film ends with the impending double wedding of the twins to their girls and Bok Min&#x27;s introduction to his real parents, but when Bok Min gets cold feet and Ma Yau goes looking for him, a final gag falls into place when the wedding guests catch the two twins together and are unable to tell them apart.

==Production==
According to co-director Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam handled most of the action scenes in the film. The action in the film has a larger focus on actual martial arts than on Jackie Chan&#x27;s usual comedic style.

===Music===
Ma Yau&#x27;s Concert depicted in the movie is the Ruslan and Lyudmila Overture, by Mikhail Glinka.

==Release==
The film received an American release on 9 April 1999 in a dubbed version. The American release of the film cuts 16 minutes of scenes involving Wong Jing and Lau Kar-leung in a hospital and a fantasy scene involving Maggie Cheung singing.

==Reception==
===Box office===
On the film&#x27;s release in Hong Kong, &quot;Twin Dragons&quot; was the ninth highest-grossing film of the year, earning 33,225,134 during its theatrical run. In Taiwan, it was the twelfth top-grossing film of 1992, earning . In Japan, the film grossed . In South Korea, it was the third top-grossing film of 1992, selling 768,951 tickets and grossing .

Upon release in North America, the film grossed US$8,332,431 in the United States, ending its North American run with a total of US$8,359,717 in the United States and Canada. In total, the film grossed worldwide, equivalent to US$86,265,362 adjusted for inflation.

===Critical response===
At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 54, based on 15 reviews. The &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; gave the film a positive review of three and a half stars out of five, noting that the film is &quot;only for those who are fully on the bus with Jackie&#x27;s approach...and who won&#x27;t let a little bad (okay, execrable) English-language dubbing get in the way of their movie enjoyment&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave a positive review, but noted that it &quot;probably won&#x27;t make anyone forget &quot;Dragons Forever&quot;, &quot;Wheels On Meals&quot;, &quot;Project A&quot;, or any number of other excellent Chan films&quot;. Some reviews critiqued the special effects, such as in &quot;Variety&quot; which noted that &quot;the camera trickery is glaringly cheesy in some shots, greatly undercutting the illusion of twin brothers in the same frame. When the two brothers first meet in a hotel lavatory, it&#x27;s easy to see how two shots have been overlapped&quot;. Writing for &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, Kim Newman found the film&#x27;s numerous cameo appearances to be annoying, stating that &quot;few of the distinguished participants show much skill with double-take comedy&quot;. &quot;TV Guide&quot; gave the film one star out of four, noting that it &quot;suffers from some very dicey twinning effects when the brothers are in frame together. Only die-hard and undemanding Chan fans need apply&quot;. Jackie Chan was unhappy with how &quot;Twin Dragons&quot; came out to be primarily based on the special effects. Chan stated that he worked with Tsui Hark who he felt would provide the film with better special effects. Chan was so soured with the results of the special effects that he decided he would only attempt more special-effect based work in his American productions.

==Remakes==
The film spawned several Indian film remakes. &quot;Hello Brother&quot; (1994) is a popular Telugu film based on &quot;Twin Dragons&quot;. In turn, &quot;Hello Brother&quot; was remade into the popular Hindi film &quot;Judwaa&quot; (1997) starring Salman Khan, which in turn spawned a reboot &quot;Judwaa 2&quot; (2017). &quot;Hello Brother&quot; was also remade as the Kannada film &quot;Cheluva&quot; (1997).

<doc id="665891" wikidata="Q2067413" url="?curid=665891" title="Thrashing (computer science)">
<text>In computer science, thrashing occurs in a system with virtual memory when a computer&#x27;s real storage resources are &quot;overcommitted&quot;, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults, slowing most application-level processing. This causes the performance of the computer to degrade or even collapse. The situation can continue indefinitely until the user closes some running applications or the active processes free up additional virtual memory resources.

After initialization, most programs operate on a small number of code and data pages compared to the total memory the program requires. The pages most frequently accessed at any point are called the working set, which may change over time. 

When the working set is not significantly greater than the system&#x27;s total number of real storage &quot;page frames&quot;, virtual memory systems work most efficiently, and an insignificant amount of computing is spent resolving page faults. As the total of the working sets grows, resolving page faults remains manageable until the growth reaches a critical point at which the number of faults increases dramatically and the time spent resolving them overwhelms the time spent on the computing the program was written to do. This condition is referred to as thrashing. Thrashing may occur on a program that randomly accesses huge data structures, as its large working set causes continual page faults that drastically slow down the system. Satisfying page faults may require freeing pages that will soon have to be re-read from disk. 

The term is also used for various similar phenomena, particularly movement between other levels of the memory hierarchy, wherein a process progresses slowly because significant time is being spent acquiring resources.

&quot;Thrashing&quot; is also used in contexts other than virtual memory systems –for example, to describe cache issues in computing, or silly window syndrome in networking.

==Overview==
Virtual memory works by treating a portion of secondary storage such as a computer hard disk as an additional layer of the cache hierarchy. Virtual memory allows processes to use more memory than is physically present in main memory. Operating systems supporting virtual memory assign processes a virtual address space and each process refers to addresses in its execution context by a so-called virtual address. To access data such as code or variables at that address, the process must translate the address to a physical address in a process known as virtual address translation. In effect, physical main memory becomes a cache for virtual memory, which is in general stored on disk in memory pages.

Programs are allocated a certain number of pages as needed by the operating system. Active memory pages exist in both RAM and on disk. Inactive pages are removed from the cache and written to disk when the main memory becomes full.

If processes are utilizing all main memory and need additional memory pages, a cascade of severe cache misses known as page faults will occur, often leading to a noticeable lag in the operating system responsiveness. This process together with the futile, repetitive page swapping that occurs is known as &quot;thrashing&quot;. This frequently leads to high, runaway CPU utilization that can grind the system to a halt. In modern computers, thrashing may occur in the paging system (if there is not sufficient physical memory or the disk access time is overly long), or in the I/O communications subsystem (especially in conflicts over internal bus access), etc.

Depending on the configuration and algorithms involved, the throughput and latency of a system may degrade by multiple orders of magnitude. Thrashing is when the CPU performs &#x27;productive&#x27; work less and &#x27;swapping&#x27; work more. The overall memory access time may increase since the higher level memory is only as fast as the next lower level in the memory hierarchy. The CPU is busy swapping pages so much that it cannot respond to users&#x27; programs and interrupts as much as required. Thrashing occurs when there are too many pages in memory, and each page refers to another page. Real memory reduces its capacity to contain all the pages, so it uses &#x27;virtual memory&#x27;. When each page in execution demands that page that is not currently in real memory (RAM) it places some pages on virtual memory and adjusts the required page on RAM. If the CPU is too busy doing this task, thrashing occurs.

===Causes===
In virtual memory systems, thrashing may be caused by programs or workloads that present insufficient locality of reference: if the working set of a program or a workload cannot be effectively held within physical memory, then constant data swapping, &quot;i.e.,&quot; thrashing, may occur. The term was first used during the tape operating system days to describe the sound the tapes made when data was being rapidly written to and read.
A worst case might occur on VAX processors. A single codice_1 crossing a page boundary could have a source operand using a displacement deferred addressing mode, where the longword containing the operand address crosses a page boundary, and a destination operand using a displacement deferred addressing mode, where the longword containing the operand address crosses a page boundary, and the source and destination could both cross page boundaries. This single instruction references ten pages; if not all are in RAM, each will cause a page fault. The total number of pages thus involved in this particular instruction is ten, and all ten pages must be simultaneously present in memory. If any one of the ten pages cannot be swapped in (for example to make room for any of the other pages), the instruction will fault, and every attempt to restart it will fail until all ten pages can be swapped in.

A system thrashing is often a result of a sudden spike in page demand from a small number of running programs. Swap-token is a lightweight and dynamic thrashing protection mechanism. The basic idea is to set a token in the system, which is randomly given to a process that has page faults when thrashing happens. The process that has the token is given a privilege to allocate more physical memory pages to build its working set, which is expected to quickly finish its execution and release the memory pages to other processes. A timestamp is used to hand over the tokens one by one. The first version of swap-token is implemented in Linux. The second version is called preempt swap-token. In this updated swap-token implementation, a priority counter is set for each process to track the number of swap-out pages. The token is always given to the process with a high priority, which has a high number of swap-out pages. The length of the time stamp is not a constant but is determined by the priority: the higher the number of swap-out pages of a process, the longer the time stamp for it will be.

==Other uses==
Thrashing is best known in the context of memory and storage, but analogous phenomena occur for other resources, including:
:Where main memory is accessed in a pattern that leads to multiple main memory locations competing for the same cache lines, resulting in excessive cache misses. This is most likely to be problematic for caches with associativity.
:Where the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) acting as a cache for the memory management unit (MMU) which translates virtual addresses to physical addresses is too small for the working set of pages. TLB thrashing can occur even if instruction cache or data cache thrashing is not occurring because these are cached in different sizes. Instructions and data are cached in small blocks (cache lines), not entire pages, but address lookup is done at the page level. Thus even if the code and data working sets fit into the cache, if the working sets are fragmented across many pages, the virtual address working set may not fit into TLB, causing TLB thrashing.
:Frequent garbage collection, due to failure to allocate memory for an object, due to insufficient free memory or insufficient contiguous free memory due to memory fragmentation is referred to as heap thrashing.
:A similar phenomenon occurs for processes: when the process working set cannot be coscheduled, i.e. such that not all interacting processes are scheduled to run at the same time, they experience &quot;process thrashing&quot; due to being repeatedly scheduled and unscheduled, progressing only slowly.

<text>Isenfluh is a hamlet in Switzerland, north of the road from Wilderswil to Lauterbrunnen. It is first mentioned in 1319 as &quot;Ysenfluo&quot; and in 1401 people from the Lötschental started to settle in the small hamlet. The hamlet belonged to the monastery in Interlaken since the 14th century was administered by the bailiff of Interlaken from 1528 to 1798.

In 1973, Isenfluh, together with Wengen, Muerren, Gimmelwald, Stechelberg and Lauterbrunnen, became part of the municipality of Lauterbrunnen. 
The infrastructure of Isenfluh is installed, but a lot of the support comes from self-help groups. Since the village school was closed for financial reasons by the government of the Canton of Bern, the children of Isenfluh attend school in Lauterbrunnen.

The main road (and bus route), Churchischlief, to Isenfluh traverses a spiral tunnel. This opened in 1992 and replaced a previous mountain road destroyed by a 1987 landslide.

Isenfluh is a base for hiking and sleigh-rides and ice-climbing. The Swiss Alpine Club (&quot;Schweizerischen Alpenclubs&quot;), SAC, is a few hours away.

<text>My Lucky Stars () is a 1985 Hong Kong action comedy film starring and directed by Sammo Hung. The film was written by Barry Wong, and produced by Leonard Ho. The film co-stars Jackie Chan, Yuen Biao, Sibelle Hu, Richard Ng, Charlie Chin, Eric Tsang, and Stanley Fung. It was released as 5 Lucky Stars in Japan and as Ninja Encounter in the Philippines. &quot;My Lucky Stars&quot; is the second film in the &quot;Lucky Stars&quot; series, and a semi-sequel to &quot;Winners and Sinners&quot;, with many of the same actors returning as the &quot;Five Lucky Stars&quot; troupe, albeit with different character names and slightly different roles.

==Plot summary==
Undercover cop Muscles (Jackie Chan) enlists his childhood friends, the &quot;Five Lucky Stars&quot;, to travel to Japan to help him catch a yakuza group.

A corrupt Hong Kong cop (Lam Ching Ying) flees to Tokyo to join his fellow mobsters, whose headquarters are secretly built under an amusement park (filmed in Fuji-Q Highland). Two loyal cops, Ricky (Yuen Biao) and Muscle (Jackie Chan), travel there to apprehend him and uncover the mobsters’ lair, but Ricky is kidnapped in a fight. 

Muscle goes into hiding and calls his supervisor to send help; since the mobsters already have information on the officers of the Hong Kong Royal Police Force, Muscle asks his supervisor to send his orphanage friends, nicknamed the Five Lucky Stars, over to assist. The supervisor agrees and collects the five friends, who are all either petty criminals or low-wage workers. They refuse to aid the police, but the supervisor cunningly sets up a false story in the media that accuses the five of robbing a bank of millions of dollars, blackmailing them into helping. They ultimately agree when the supervisor teams them up with a rookie policewoman, Swordflower, who becomes an object of lustful target to the five.

The group travels to Tokyo and that night, Kidstuff (Sammo Hung), the Stars&#x27; most rational and talented member, and Swordflower go to Muscle’s apartment. After defeating some thugs, Muscle reunites with Kidstuff. The operation is to send phony money to the mobsters to allow the five to enter their lair, and that way they can get closer to freeing Ricky and apprehending the criminals. After a prolonged battle at the bowels of the amusement park, the criminals lose and the Lucky Stars receive a place to live back at Hong Kong as their reward.

==Cast==
Despite being billed as one of the stars, Jackie Chan&#x27;s role in the film is relatively minor until the final half hour. The major star of the film is Chan&#x27;s longtime associate and former member of the Peking Opera School, Sammo Hung. The film also features another of that troupe, Yuen Biao.

In the first film, &quot;Winners and Sinners&quot;, Stanley Fung played an undercover policeman who was posing as the leader of the Lucky Stars gang. In &quot;My Lucky Stars&quot; and the third film, &quot;Twinkle, Twinkle Lucky Stars&quot;, Hung&#x27;s character is the nominal leader, and Fung&#x27;s character is not a cop.

John Shum (&quot;Curly&quot; in &quot;Winners and Sinners&quot;) was notably absent from the gang in this film, due to his commitments as a political activist. He is replaced in this film by Eric Tsang.

As with &quot;Heart of Dragon&quot;, Sammo Hung&#x27;s real-life brother makes a cameo appearance as a henchman.

<text>Stechelberg () is a small village in Switzerland located at the base of the Schwarzmönch mountain in the Bernese Alps, part of the district of Lauterbrunnen.

==History==
The name &quot;Stächelbärg&quot; is first recorded in 1749 to describe this part of the valley. The area was associated with iron ore mining, which led to widespread deforestation. Since then, reforestation programmes have largely restored the area around the village, which has been declared a protected natural area (&quot;Naturschutzgebiet&quot;)

The village is connected by the Luftseilbahn Stechelberg-Mürren-Schilthorn (LSMS), an aerial tramway constructed in 1965, to other amenities and locations in the area.

In February 2003, two avalanches struck the village, but did not cause significant damage.

As of 2009, Stechelberg has 255 inhabitants.

==Transport==
Stechelberg is accessed by Lauterbrunnen from the terminal train station, or by a small road that leads up the valley from Lauterbrunnen. The only other way to reach the village is by hiking over difficult terrain.

<doc id="665906" wikidata="Q11144095" url="?curid=665906" title="Toc H">
<text>Toc H (also TH) is an international Christian movement. The name is an abbreviation for Talbot House, &quot;Toc&quot; signifying the letter T in the signals spelling alphabet used by the British Army in World War I. A soldiers&#x27; rest and recreation centre named Talbot House was founded in December 1915 at Poperinghe, Belgium. It aimed to promote Christianity and was named in memory of Gilbert Talbot, son of Lavinia Talbot and Edward Talbot, then Bishop of Winchester, who had been killed at Hooge in July 1915. The founders were Gilbert&#x27;s elder brother Neville Talbot, then a senior army chaplain, and the Reverend Philip Thomas Byard (Tubby) Clayton. Talbot House was styled as an &quot;Every Man&#x27;s Club&quot;, where all soldiers were welcome, regardless of rank. It was &quot;an alternative for the &#x27;debauched&#x27; recreational life of the town&quot;.

In 1920, Clayton founded a Christian youth centre in London, also called Toc H, which developed into an interdenominational association for Christian social service. The original building at Poperinghe has been maintained and redeveloped as a museum and tourist venue. Branches of Toc H were established in many countries around the world. An Australian branch was formed in Victoria in 1925 by the heretical Rev. Herbert Hayes. Another was formed in Adelaide the same year.

Toc H members seek to ease the burdens of others through acts of service. They also promote reconciliation and work to bring disparate sections of society together. Branches may organise localised activities such as hospital visits, entertainment for the residents of care homes and organising residential holidays for special groups.

The organisation suffered a progressive decline in membership and closure of branches during the later 20th century. In 2008, continued operation was ensured by dispensing with paid staff. In the 21st century, Toc H trustees have planned for it to become a stronger, voluntary movement still guided by the ethos of the original Talbot House.

==Schools==
Toc H runs schools in India such as Toc-H Public School.
In 2004 it was reported that Toc H had decided to invest in an academy school in Bradford, England.
The then chief executive, Geoff Smith, said that the academy would reflect the charity&#x27;s commitment to community building. It was opened in 2008 by John Sentamu, the Archbishop of York.

==History==
===Foundation in World War I===

At the outbreak of World War I Neville Talbot, a senior Church of England chaplain in the British Army, sought to recruit chaplains who would minister to the battalions on the front lines. One of his recruits was the Reverend Phillip Byard Clayton, who was assigned to the East Kent and Bedfordshire regiments. In 1915 Clayton was sent to France and then on to the town of Poperinge in Belgium.

Sitting a few miles back from the trenches around Ypres (nowadays known by its Flemish name Ieper), Poperinge (or &quot;Pops&quot;, as the soldiers called it) was a busy transfer station where troops on their way to and from the battlefields of Flanders were billeted. Clayton, universally known as &quot;Tubby&quot;, was instructed by Neville Talbot to set up some sort of rest house for the troops.

Clayton chose the Coevoet house – temporarily vacated by its owner, a wealthy local hop merchant – to use as his base, paying rent of 150 francs a month. The house had received significant damage from shellfire, especially the hop loft and the garden. Repairs were begun in September by the Royal Engineers. It opened on 11 December 1915.

Clayton decided to steer away from the traditional church club and set up an Everyman’s House. It was named Talbot House in honour of Lieutenant Gilbert Talbot (Neville’s brother) who had been killed earlier in the year. Talbot House soon became known by its initials TH, and then, in the radio signallers’ phonetic alphabet of the day as Toc Aitch. 

The focus of religious services and devotions was a chapel created in the attic, known as the &quot;Upper Room&quot;. After the war&#x27;s end, in 1918, the interior of the Chapel was sent to London, and temporarily displayed in the crypt of All Hallows-by-the-Tower. From the concise guidebook Clayton compiled for its visitors, we learn why precisely these objects had to be taken home, and why they would return to Poperinge in 1929.

==Spirit==
The spirit of friendship fostered at Toc H across social and denominational boundaries inspired Clayton, the Rev. Dick Sheppard and Alexander Paterson to set out in 1920 what became known as the &quot;Four points of the Toc H compass&quot;:

# Friendship (&quot;To love widely&quot;)
# Service (&quot;To build bravely&quot;)
# Fairmindedness (&quot;To think fairly&quot;)
# The Kingdom of God (&quot;To witness humbly&quot;)

This followed the foundation of a new Toc H House in Kensington in 1919, followed by others in London, Manchester, and Southampton. The Toc H movement continued to grow in numbers and established, also, a women&#x27;s league. In 1930, Clayton led Toc H into creative support of the British Empire Leprosy Relief Association.
