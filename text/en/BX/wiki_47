<text>The South African Premier Division, officially referred to as the [[Betway]] Premiership for sponsorship purposes, and commonly referred to as the PSL after the governing body, is the premier men&#x27;s professional soccer league and the highest division in the league system of South Africa, organised since 1996.

The 2024–25 season started on 14 September 2024 with Sundowns being the most recent champions and looking to clinch yet another title under a new regime.

==History==

The league was founded in 1996 after an agreement between the National Soccer League and the remnants of the National Professional Soccer League. It is stated on its website that the former name still exists today, but for legal purposes, with the &quot;Premier Soccer League&quot; being its trade name.

The league was reduced from 18 to 16 teams after the end of the 2001–02 season to avoid fixture congestion, causing the disbandment of two teams; Ria Stars and Free State Stars, though the latter was reformed and competing as of the 2020–21 season. In 2004, a match-fixing scandal rocked the football/soccer landscape in South Africa. An investigation codenamed &quot;Operation Dribble&quot; was launched by the police system of South Africa police in June 2004. More than 40 arrests were made, ranging from club bosses to match commissioners, referees and their assistants. Kaizer Chiefs successfully defended their league title in 2005 after they won the prestigious trophy in 2004 for the first time in a decade. The 2005–06 season saw Mamelodi Sundowns capturing the title for a fourth time. Since the 2017–18 season, they have dominated the league, winning seven consecutuve titles.

In 2007, the PSL signed a television deal with SuperSport worth R 1.6 billion, which was the biggest sporting deal in the history of the country and ranked the league into the top 15 in the world in terms of commercial broadcast deals. In the same year, ABSA replaced Castle Lager as the title sponsor, with the latter having sponsored the league since its inception. SuperSport United won 3 league titles in a row between 2008 and 2010.

As of August 2024, the league is rated fourth in Africa according to the CAF 5-year ranking system.

For the 2018–19 season, the PSL gives each club a monthly grant of R 2 million, with funds coming from the television broadcasting rights and national sponsorships, with the league champion earning R 10 million.

In 2019, ABSA increased their sponsorship deal to the PSL to R 39.9 million, which meant that the league winners would secure R 15 million. ABSA would however announce its cancellation of its sponsorship with the PSL a year later on 4 June 2020.

On 24 September 2020, &quot;DStv&quot; were announced as the new sponsor, with the league being rebranded as the DStv Premiership. MultiChoice also announced that Showmax would replace &quot;DStv&quot; as the jersey sponsor of SuperSport United F.C. so the latter would be independent to sponsor the league outright.

On the 24th of July 2024, it was announced that Betway would be sponsoring the league, with DStv&#x27;s contract ending a year early due to MultiChoice&#x27;s financial troubles. This is one of the biggest sponsorships in South African football history worth R900-Million for the term of 3 years.

* CC: CAF Confederation Cup

==Sponsorship==
The league has had title sponsorships since its inception. Like the EFL League One and the Premier League divisions in England, the league takes its title sponsor&#x27;s name to determine its official common name:

* 1996–2007: Castle Lager (Castle Premiership)
* 2007–2020: ABSA (ABSA Premiership)
* 2020–2024: DStv (DStv Premiership)
* 2024–present: Betway (Betway Premiership)

==Format==
As of the 2024–25 season, the league is composed of 16 teams competing from August to May each season, similar to the format of most European football leagues. Each team plays the other teams twice in a double round-robin format using the three points for a win system.

At the conclusion of each season, the champion and runner-up of the Premiership qualify for the CAF Champions League, while the 3rd-place team and the Nedbank Cup champions qualify for the CAF Confederation Cup. The bottom team in the league is automatically relegated and replaced by the winner of the Motsepe Foundation Championship, whiles the team finishing immediately above the bottom team enters a mini-league playoff series with the 2nd and 3rd-placed league-finished teams of the National First Division, with the playoff winners earning their place in the Premiership for the following season.

==Broadcasting==
The league&#x27;s broadcaster is SuperSport, who in turn sub-leases the broadcasting rights to the SABC, so as to broadcast some matches on public television in South Africa. SuperSport was awarded an initial $277 million 5-year broadcast/TV rights deal in 2007 by the Premier Soccer League to help commercialize the league globally beyond South Africa. matches on sunset times between Tuesdays and Fridays and on weekends whereas the SABC telecast matches played on Wednesday nights and on weekends.

Since 2016, as SuperSport is a brand owned by the MultiChoice Group, the league is available to watch live and on demand via their specified services; the DStv App (formerly &quot;DStv Mobile&quot; and &quot;DStv Now&quot;) and Showmax Pro. Both are accessible via the DStv website for PC and Mac and as mobile apps on Android and iOS/iPadOS for mobile phones, tablets and Smart TVs.

<text>Kitchen Stories () is a 2003 Norwegian film by Bent Hamer, director of &quot;Eggs&quot; and &quot;O&#x27; Horten.&quot;

==Plot==
Swedish efficiency researchers come to Norway to study Norwegian men, in an effort to help optimize their use of their kitchens. Folke Nilsson (Tomas Norström) is assigned to study the habits of Isak Bjørvik (Joachim Calmeyer). By the rules of the research institute, Folke has to sit on an umpire&#x27;s chair in Isak&#x27;s kitchen and observe him from there, but never talk to him. Isak volunteered for the program with the promise of a horse, but he only receives a dala horse, a little painted wooden statue.

Isak stops using his kitchen and observes Folke through a hole in the ceiling instead. The two lonely men, observer and observed, slowly overcome the initial Norwegian-Swede and subject-observer distrust and become friends. Isak&#x27;s friend Grant visits him often. Grant is a concentration camp survivor and feels Folke is stealing his friend.

The friendship between Folke and Isak costs Folke his job during an inspection. He is forced to leave and drive up to the Swedish border, but then he returns, only to find Isak has died of a broken heart. Folke, now alone, occupies Isak&#x27;s home and takes up Isak&#x27;s friendship with Grant.

==Inspiration for the film==
Bent Hamer was amused after perusing post-World War II research books on the efficiency of the Swedish housewife, and pondered on the idea of research being done on men. This led him to make the film &quot;Kitchen Stories&quot; with Swedish researchers and a Norwegian man as the main character.

<text>Protoavis (meaning &quot;first bird&quot;) is a problematic taxon known from fragmentary remains from Late Triassic Norian stage deposits near Post, Texas. The animal&#x27;s true classification has been the subject of much controversy, and there are many different interpretations of what the taxon actually is. When it was first described, the fossils were described as being from a primitive bird which, if the identification is valid, would push back avian origins some 60–75 million years.

The original describer of &quot;Protoavis texensis&quot;, Sankar Chatterjee of Texas Tech University, interpreted the type specimen to have come from a single animal, specifically a 35 cm tall bird that lived in what is now Texas, USA, around 210 million years ago. Though it existed far earlier than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, its skeletal structure is more bird-like. &quot;Protoavis&quot; has been reconstructed as a carnivorous bird that had teeth on the tip of its jaws and eyes located at the front of the skull, suggesting a nocturnal or crepuscular lifestyle. Reconstructions usually depict it with feathers, as Chatterjee originally interpreted structures on the arm to be quill knobs, the attachment point for flight feathers found in some modern birds and non-avian dinosaurs. However, re-evaluation of the fossil material by subsequent authors such as Lawrence Witmer have been inconclusive regarding whether or not these structures are actual quill knobs.

However, this description of &quot;Protoavis&quot; assumes that &quot;Protoavis&quot; has been correctly interpreted as a bird. Many palaeontologists doubt that &quot;Protoavis&quot; is a bird, or that all remains assigned to it even come from a single species, because of the circumstances of its discovery and unconvincing avian synapomorphies in its fragmentary material. When they were found at the Tecovas and Bull Canyon Formations in the Texas panhandle in 1973, in a sedimentary strata of a Triassic river delta, the fossils were a jumbled cache of disarticulated bones that may reflect an incident of mass mortality following a flash flood.

==Description==
&quot;Protoavis&quot; is usually depicted as being a bipedal archosaur, similar to several poposaurids and rauisuchids that lived during roughly the same time as &quot;Protoavis&quot;. In a description published by Sankar Chatterjee, structures were identified as quill knobs, although there has been debate as to whether these are actually quill knobs or not.

===Skull and braincase===
The braincase of &quot;Protoavis&quot; is similar in some respects to &quot;Troodon&quot;, with an enlarged cerebellum that shifted the optic lobes ventrolaterally, and also has a large floccular lobe. The inner ear is also pretty similar and bird-like in both taxa. The canalicular systems and the cochlear process differ in both taxa, and the vestibular region is relatively small and located in a ventral position to most of the anterior and posterior semicircular canals. The anterior semicircular canal is significantly longer than the others, and the cochlear process is a relatively long, vertically oriented tube. However, &quot;Protoavis&quot; is also remarkedly non-bird like in that it possess only a single exit for the trigeminal. However, these characters are not robust enough to identify &quot;Protoavis&quot; as a bird.

The skull has an extremely narrow parietal with block like dorsal aspect, very broad, T-shaped frontals that form the &quot;lateral wings&quot; that Chatterjee applies to the lack of postorbitals. There are short curved ulnae with olecranon processes, and a possible scapula with bent shaft, and the cervicals have profiles and aspects to their exterior that are very similar to the &quot;Megalancosaurus&quot; cervical series. All the cervicals but the most posterior and axis/atlas have hypapophyses and those triangular neural spines; all characteristics that have been described in &quot;Megalancosaurus&quot;. This suggests that portions of &quot;Protoavis&quot; may be drepanosaurid in nature.

Chatterjee presents the skull of &quot;Protoavis&quot; as complete, although only the caudal aspect of the cranium is represented in the available fossils. Chatterjee argues that the temporal region displays a streptostylic quadrate with orbital process for attachment of the M. protractor pterygoidei et quadrati, with associated confluence of the orbits with the temporal fenestrae, thus facilitating prokinesis. He further asserts that the braincase of &quot;Protoavis&quot; bears a number of characters seen in Ornithurae, including the structure of the otic capsule, the widespread pneumatization of the braincase elements, a full complement of tympanic recesses, and the presence of an epiotic.

Of this material, only the quadrate and orbital roof, in addition to limited portions of the braincase are preserved with enough fidelity to permit any definitive interpretation. The quadrates of TTU P 9200 and TTU P 9201 are not particularly alike; a fact not easily explained away if the material is conspecific, as Chatterjee insists. There does not appear to be an orbital process present on either bone, and the modifications of the proximal condyle permitting wide range of motion against the squamosal, are not readily apparent. Furthermore, the quadratojugal and jugal appear far more robust in the &quot;Protoavis&quot; specimens themselves, than represented by Chatterjee. The size and development of the quadratojugal seems to contradict Chatterjee&#x27;s assertion that this bone contacted the quadrate via a highly mobile pin joint. These data render the assertion of prokinesis in the skull of &quot;Protoavis&quot; questionable at best, and it seems most parsimonious to conclude that the specimen displays a conventional opisthostylic quadrate.

The braincase is where &quot;Protoavis&quot; comes close to being as avian as Chatterjee has maintained. The otic capsule is allegedly organized in avian fashion, with three distinct foramina arranged as such: fenestra ovalis, fenestra pseudorotunda, and the caudal tympanic recess, with a bony metotic strut positioned between the fenestra pseudorotunda and caudal tympanic recess. The claim that the full complement of tympanic recesses seen in ornithurines, are similarly observed in &quot;Protoavis&quot; is questionable, as the preservation of the braincase is not adequate to permit concrete observations on the matter. Chatterjee omits in his 1987 account of the braincase, the presence of a substantial post-temporal fenestra, which in all Aves (including &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;), is reduced or absent altogether, and the lack of a pneumatic sinus on the paroccipital. Furthermore, the braincase possesses multiple characters symplesiomorphic of Coelurosauria, including an expanded cerebellar auricular fossa, and a vagal canal opening into the occiput. What is preserved of the preorbital skull curiously lacks apomorphic characters to be expected in a specimen, which is allegedly more closely allied to Pygostylia than is &quot;Archaeopteryx lithographica&quot;. Most telling is the complete absence of accessory fenestrae in the antorbital fossa, leading to maxillary sinuses.

===Post-cranial anatomy===
The post-cranial remains are as badly preserved, or worse, than the cranial elements, and their interpretation by Chatterjee are in many cases unsubstantiated or speculative. Of the postcranial skeleton, Chatterjee has isolated the axial skeleton as displaying a suite of avian characters, including heterocoelus centra, hypapophyses and reduction of the neural spines. First and foremost, the preservation quality of the vertebrae is poor. While the centra are modified, they do not appear to be truly heterocoelus. The presence of incipient hypapophyses in and of itself might be considered indicative of avian affinity, but their poor development and presence on vertebrae otherwise thoroughly non-avian, is most parsimoniously regarded as mild convergence until further material should be brought to light. The reduction of the neural spines is questionable.

Curiously, Gregory Paul has noted that the cervicals of &quot;Protoavis&quot; and drepanosaurs are astonishingly similar, such they are hardly distinguishable from one another. Considering the modification of the drepanosaur neck for the purposes of snap-action predation, it becomes more likely that superficial similarities in the cervicals of both taxa are in fact only convergent with Aves. Chatterjee does not identify the remaining vertebrae as particularly avian in their osteology.

====Pectoral girdle====
The pectoral girdle is discussed by Chatterjee as being highly derived in &quot;Protoavis&quot;, displaying synapomorphies of avialans more derived than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, including the presence of a hypocleidium-bearing furcula, and a hypertrophied, carinate sternum. Chatterjee&#x27;s interpretation of the fossils identified as such in his reviews of the &quot;Protoavis&quot; material are open to question due to the preservation quality of the elements and as of this time, it is not clear whether either character was in fact present in &quot;Protoavis&quot;. The glenoid appears to be oriented dorsolaterally permitting a wide range of humeral movement. Chatterjee implies that this is a highly derived trait which allies &quot;Protoavis&quot; to Aves, but why this should be so is not clearly discussed in the descriptions of the animal. In and of itself, the orientation of the glenoid is not a sufficient basis for placing &quot;Protoavis&quot; within Aves. The scapular blade is far broader than illustrated by Chatterjee in his 1997 account, and not particularly avian in its gross form. The coracoid, identified by Chatterjee as strut-like and retroverted, is, like the supposed furcula and sternum, too poorly preserved to permit accurate identification. Moreover, the original spatial relationship of the alleged coracoid to the scapula is entirely unknown. Uncinate processes and sternal ribs are missing.

====Pelvic girdle====
Chatterjee asserts that the pelvic girdle is apomorphic comparative to archaic birds and displays a retroverted pubis, fusion of the ischium and ilium, an antitrochanter, and the presence of a renal fossa. The pubis does appear to display opisthopuby, although this has yet to be verified. The alleged fusion of the ischium and ilium into an ilioischiadic plate is currently not substantiated by the fossils at hand, despite Chatterjee&#x27;s auspicious illustration to the contrary in &quot;The Rise of Birds&quot;. At this time the pelvic girdle is not sufficiently well preserved to ascertain whether or not a renal fossa was present, although as no known avian from the Mesozoic displays a renal fossa, it is not clear why &quot;Protoavis&quot; should, even if it is more derived than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. Similarly, it is unclear if the alleged antitrochanter has been correctly identified as such.

====Arms and legs====
The manus and carpus are among the few areas of the &quot;Protoavis&quot; material which are well preserved, and they are astonishingly non-avian. The distal carpals, while long, are in no way similar to those observed in the urvogel or other archaic birds. There is no semilunate element, and the structure of the radiale and ulnare would have limited the flexibility of the wrist joint. The manus is not tridactyl, and metacarpal V is present. In even the most basal avialian, &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, there is no vestige of the fifth metacarpal and its presence in &quot;Protoavis&quot; seems incongruous with the claim that it is a bird, let alone one more derived than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;.

Chatterjee claims that the humerus of &quot;Protoavis&quot; is &quot;remarkably avian&quot;, but as in all matters with the fossils referred to this taxon, accurate identification of the elaborate trochanters, ridges, etc., attributed to the humerus by Chatterjee is impossible at this time. The expanded distal condyles, which appear to be present in the humerus of &quot;Protoavis&quot; and enlarged deltopectoral crest (a ridge for the attachment of chest and shoulder muscles), are congruent with the morphology of ceratosaur humeri, as is the apparent presence of a distal brachial depression.

The femur of &quot;Protoavis&quot; is astonishingly similar to non-tetanurans, namely coelophysoids. The proximal femur displays a trochanteric shelf caudal to the lesser and greater trochanters, a feature distinguishing non-tetanurans theropods from Tetanurae. Further similarities between the proximal humerus of &quot;Protoavis&quot; and that of non-tetanuran theropods are found in the shared presence of an enlarged obturator ridge, whose morphology in &quot;Protoavis&quot; is again, uncannily like that observed in robust basal theropods, e.g., &quot;&quot;Syntarus&quot; kayentakatae&quot;. The resemblance between the femur of &quot;Protoavis&quot; and that of a non-tetanuran theropod becomes ever more pronounced at the distal end of the bone. Both share a crista tibiofibularis groove, a feature of a non-tetanuran theropod separating the medial and lateral condyles.

The tibia of &quot;Protoavis&quot; allegedly possesses both a lateral and cranial cnemial crest, though the validity of this claim is subject to question due to the preservation quality of the material. The fibula is continuous to the astragalocalcaneal unit. A tibiotarsus is absent, unusual considering Chatterjee&#x27;s claims for the pygostylian affinity of &quot;Protoavis&quot;, as is a tarsometatarsus. The ascending process of the astragalus is reduced, a character entirely incongruous with a highly derived status for &quot;Protoavis&quot;. Curiously, such abbreviation of the ascending process is found in ceratosaurs, and in its general osteology, the &quot;Protoavis&quot; tarsus and pes, is quite similar to those of non-tetanuran theropods. Chatterjee&#x27;s restoration of the hallux as reversed is nothing more than speculation, as the original spatial relationships of the pedal elements are impossible to ascertain at this time.

====Quill knobs====
Reconstructions usually depict &quot;Protoavis&quot; with feathers, as Chatterjee originally interpreted structures on the arm to be quill knobs, the attachment point for flight feathers found in some modern birds and non-avian dinosaurs. However, re-evaluation of the fossil material by subsequent authors such as Lawrence Witmer have been inconclusive regarding whether or not these structures are actual quill knobs.

In his 1997 account, Chatterjee infers the presence of feathers from alleged quill knobs on the badly smashed ulna and metacarpals III and IV, and infers the presence of remiges from such structures (though he does caution that this is uncertain). As is the case with the alleged quill knobs on the ulna, the metacarpal structures appear to be attributable to post-mortem damage. Moreover, the thumb, unlike the case in all birds, is not medially divergent. Considering how poorly preserved the ulna is, it is entirely premature to make any definitive conclusions as to the presence of quill knobs until such time as more adequate material becomes available. Upon further examination of the material no structures were isolated that could be deemed as homologous to remigial papillae.

==Classification and taxonomy==
The taxonomy of &quot;Protoavis&quot; is controversial, with several palaeornithologists considering it to be an early ancestor of modern birds, while most others in the palaeontological community regard it as a chimaera, a mixture of several specimens. American palaeontologist Gregory Paul suggested that &quot;Protoavis&quot; is a herrerasaur. In a paper by Phil Currie and X.J. Zhao discussing a braincase of a &quot;Troodon formosus&quot;, they compared the bird-like characters of &quot;Troodon&quot; and &quot;Protoavis&quot;. In the paper, they made a number of corrections involving both Chatterjee&#x27;s and Currie&#x27;s own misinterpretations of parts of &quot;Troodon&quot; cranial anatomy before the particular braincase being described was found. At least a couple of the corrections (the anterior tympanic recess, and the relatively kinetic quadrate-squamosal contact) made &quot;Troodon&quot; more bird-like than Chatterjee made out in his &quot;Protoavis&quot; paper, but overall these particular corrections seemed to have little bearing on the avian features of &quot;Protoavis&quot;. Currie and Zhao did not explicitly state whether or not they considered &quot;Protoavis&quot; to be a theropod, however they suggested that although &quot;Protoavis&quot; has characters suggesting avian affinities, most of these are also found in theropod dinosaurs.

===&quot;Protoavis&quot; is a bird===
Sankar Chatterjee and a few other palaeornithologists claimed that this material documents a Triassic origin of birds and the presence of a bird more advanced than &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;. Though it existed approximately 75 million years before the oldest known bird, its skeletal structure is allegedly more bird-like. &quot;Protoavis&quot; has been reconstructed as a carnivorous bird that had teeth on the tip of its jaws and eyes located at the front of the skull, suggesting a nocturnal or crepuscular lifestyle. The fossil bones are too badly preserved to allow an estimate of flying ability; although reconstructions usually show feathers, judging from thorough study of the fossil material there is no indication that these were present.

However, this description of &quot;Protoavis&quot; assumes that &quot;Protoavis&quot; has been correctly interpreted as a bird. Almost all palaeontologists doubt that &quot;Protoavis&quot; is a bird, or that all remains assigned to it even come from a single species, because of the circumstances of its discovery and weak avialan synapomorphies in its fragmentary material. When they were found at a Dockum Group quarry in the Texas panhandle in 1984, in a sedimentary stratum of a Triassic river delta, the fossils were a jumbled cache of disarticulated bones reflecting an incident of mass mortality following a flash flood.

===&quot;Protoavis&quot; is a chimaera===
 
Chatterjee was convinced that some of these crushed bones belonged to two individuals – one old, one young – of the same species. However, only a few parts were found, primarily a skull and some limb bones which moreover do not well agree in their proportions respective to each other, and this has led many to believe that the &quot;Protoavis&quot; fossil is chimaeric, made up of more than one organism: the pieces of skull appear like those of a coelurosaur, while the femur and ankle bone catalogued under TTU P-9200 and TTU P-9201 respectively suggest affinities to non-tetanuran theropods and at least some vertebrae are most similar to those of &quot;Megalancosaurus&quot;, a drepanosaurid. However, those supposed similarities between the cervicals of &quot;Protoavis&quot; and drepanosaurids were the same similarities that Feduccia and Wild (1993) used to argue for an affinity between &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and drepanosaurids.

&quot;Everywhere one turns; the very fossils ascribed thereto challenge the validity of &quot;Protoavis&quot;. The most parsimonious conclusion to be inferred from these data is that Chatterjee&#x27;s contentious find is nothing more than a chimera, a morass of long-dead archosaurs.&quot;

If it really is a single animal and not a chimera, &quot;Protoavis&quot; would raise questions about when birds began to diverge from other theropods, if they are a lineage of theropod dinosaurs at all, but until better evidence is produced, the animal&#x27;s status currently remains uncertain. Furthermore, paleobiogeography suggests that true birds did not colonize the Americas until the Cretaceous; the most primitive undisputed bird-like maniraptorans found to date are all Eurasian. Certainly, the fossils are most parsimoniously attributed to primitive dinosaurian and other reptiles as outlined above. However, coelurosaurs and ceratosaurs are in any case not too distantly related to the ancestors of birds and in some aspects of the skeleton not unlike them, explaining how their fossils could be mistaken as avian. Palaeontologist Zhonghe Zhou stated:

&quot;[&quot;Protoavis&quot;] has neither been widely accepted nor seriously considered as a Triassic bird ... [Witmer], who has examined the material and is one of the few workers to have seriously considered Chatterjee&#x27;s proposal, argued that the avian status of &quot;P. texensis&quot; is probably not as clear as generally portrayed by Chatterjee, and further recommended minimization of the role that &quot;Protoavis&quot; plays in the discussion of avian ancestry.&quot;

Welman has argued that the quadrate of &quot;Protoavis&quot; displays synapomorphies of Theropoda. Paul has demonstrated the drepanosaur affinities of the cervical vertebrae. Gauthier &amp; Rowe, and Dingus &amp; Rowe have argued convincingly for identifying the hind limb of &quot;Protoavis&quot; as belonging to a ceratosaur. Feduccia has argued that &quot;Protoavis&quot; represents an arboreal &quot;thecodont&quot;. In a study of early ornithischian dinosaurs, Sterling Nesbitt and others determined some of the partial remains of &quot;Protoavis&quot; to be a non-tetanuran theropod. The entire skull and neck are considered to be most likely from a drepanosaurid because the skull and neck are too big compared to the dorsal vertebrae of &quot;Protoavis&quot;.

===In discussions of evolution===
Scientists such as Alan Feduccia have cited &quot;Protoavis&quot; in an attempt to refute the hypothesis that birds evolved from dinosaurs. However, some scientists have claimed the only consequence would be to push the point of bird divergence further back in time. At the time when such claims were originally made, the affiliation of birds and maniraptoran theropods which today is well-supported and generally accepted by most ornithologists was much more contentious; most Mesozoic birds have only been discovered since then. Chatterjee himself has since used &quot;Protoavis&quot; to support a close relationship between dinosaurs and birds.

&quot;As there remains no compelling data to support the avian status of &quot;Protoavis&quot; or taxonomic validity thereof, it seems mystifying that the matter should be so contentious. The author very much agrees with Chiappe in arguing that at present, &quot;Protoavis&quot; is irrelevant to the phylogenetic reconstruction of Aves. While further material from the Dockum beds may vindicate this peculiar archosaur, for the time being, the case for &quot;Protoavis&quot; is non-existent.&quot;

===Phylogenetic implications===
It has been argued that if valid, &quot;Protoavis&quot; will represent the death knell to the theropod descent of birds. Palaeontologists counter that if valid, &quot;Protoavis&quot; in no way falsifies the theropod origin of birds. The very fact that Chatterjee used his putative bird to defend theropod origins for birds seems to contradict the argument of Alan Feduccia that a true bird from the Triassic would bring about the collapse of the theropod &quot;dogma&quot;.

==Discovery and history==
Archosaur discoveries are comparatively abundant in Texas, and have been recovered in some quantity since E. D. Cope worked the redbeds of the panhandle over a century ago. The holotype specimen of &quot;Protoavis&quot; (TTU P 9200), the paratype (TTU P 9201), and all referred materials, were discovered in the Dockum Group, from the panhandle of Texas. The Dockum dates from the Carnian through the early Norian, in the terminal Triassic and is composed of four units of decreasing age: the Santa Rose Formation, the Tecovas Formation, the Trujillo Formation, the Cooper Canyon Formation, and the Bull Canyon Formation. Many skeletal elements and partial elements of &quot;Protoavis&quot; were collected from the Post (Miller) Quarry of the Bull Canyon Formation in the 1980s and other specimens referred to &quot;Protoavis&quot; were collected from the underlying Kirkpatrick Quarry of the Tecovas Formation. The specimens altogether consists of a partial skull and postcranial remains belonging to possibly several large individuals. The bones were completely freed of the surrounding matrix, and some were heavily reconstructed and the identification of some of the elements have been questioned by other palaeornithologists and palaeontologists.

The type material was collected from mudstone deposits in June 1973 and initially identified as a juvenile &quot;Coelophysis bauri&quot;. The level of the Dockum group from which the &quot;Protoavis&quot; material was recovered, was most likely deposited in a deltaic river system. The bone bed excavated by Sankar Chatterjee and his students of Texas Tech University, in which &quot;Protoavis&quot; was discovered, likely reflects an incident of mass mortality following a flash flood. Chatterjee, who first described &quot;Protoavis&quot;, has assigned the binomial &quot;Protoavis texensis&quot; (&quot;first bird from Texas&quot;) to the small cache of bones, allegedly conspecific. He interpreted the type specimen to have come from a single animal, specifically a 35 cm tall bird that lived in what is now Texas, USA, between 225 and 210 million years ago.

Due to the nature of the bones being jumbled into sandstone nodules, and completely disarticulated, it has been suggested that &quot;Protoavis&quot; was reworked from later sediments. However, a basic stratigraphic principle, the &quot;principle of inclusions&quot;, is a special case of the principle of cross-cutting relationships. It states that rock has to exist before it can be included in other sedimentary rock. Reworking is the process of weathering fossils or rock containing fossils out of rocks already present, transporting them, and redepositing them in sediments which are later lithified as new sedimentary rocks. Since the Jurassic rocks occurred after the Triassic sediments of the Dockum Group, they could not have been reworked into the Dockum sediments as inclusions.

==Palaeoenvironment==
The inferred palaeoclimate of the Dockum Group would have been subtropical and governed by a distinct dry/wet season pattern, with the latter marked by monsoonal rains. The botanical evidence indicates that the area was densely forested, and the abundance of both invertebrate and vertebrate material from the site suggests that the locale was in general richly populated by a wide variety of species. Dinosaurs were still fairly rare in the Dockum group, and only some ceratosaurs and other basal forms are well documented. The principal carnivores of the locale would have been poposaurids such as &quot;Postosuchus&quot;, a species well represented in the Triassic redbeds of Texas. Other archaic archosaurs, such as rhynchosaurs and aetosaurs, were also fairly common.

===Taphonomy===

Both the holotype and paratype were recovered from disparate locations, both disarticulated and unassociated. Consequently, spatial relationships are impossible to determine. No record of the original orientation of the material even as recovered, exists. Further material assigned to the taxon has been recovered in isolation with no apparent spatial relationships to each other, and their referral to &quot;Protoavis&quot; is difficult to support.

Not only were the remains recovered disarticulated and unassociated, there are morphometric differences in the various components of the holotype and paratype. For instance, the scapulae and coracoids are heavily reduced, to the point that association with the axial skeleton is extremely difficult to support. Juvenile ontogeny cannot be invoked credibly to explain this discrepancy. Furthermore, the degree of morphometric variation in the holotype and paratype seems incongruent with the component material representing a conspecific assemblage of bones.

The fossils themselves display significant postmortem damage, and are in some cases so badly crushed and distorted at the hand of geological processes, that accurate interpretation thereof is impossible.

In his definitive analysis of the material, &quot;The Rise of Birds&quot; (1997), Chatterjee failed to illustrate the &quot;Protoavis&quot; fossils via pictures or sketches of the fossils proper, and instead offered artistic reconstructions. For this, Chatterjee has been criticized.

<text>Baltimora was an Italian music project from Milan, active from 1984 to 1987. They are best known for their 1985 single &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; and are often considered a one-hit wonder in the United Kingdom and the United States. In other European countries, including their native Italy, Baltimora scored a follow-up hit &quot;Woody Boogie&quot; the same year.

==History==

===Early years===
In early 1984, Maurizio Bassi, a music producer and musician from Milan, met Jimmy McShane, a native of Derry, Northern Ireland. They decided to form an act fronted by McShane, a trained singer, dancer and actor, who had previously tried to break into the West End theater scene and toured with Dee D. Jackson. McShane and Bassi chose the name Baltimora when, one evening together, McShane took a map of the United States, closed his eyes and happened to place his finger on Baltimore. They changed the final letter to an &#x27;a&#x27; to make the name more in keeping with the act&#x27;s Italian roots.

Bassi recruited prominent Italian sessionmen to record their first album, including Giorgio Cocilovo on guitar and Gabriele &quot;Lele&quot; Melotti on drums. Fellow Italo disco producer Tom Hooker has claimed that Baltimora&#x27;s lead vocals were performed by Maurizio Bassi, as he&#x27;d done with Carrara, with McShane sometimes providing the backing vocals. The bulk of Baltimora&#x27;s song writing fell on Bassi and American lyricist Naimy Hackett, though McShane wrote the lyrics to their track &quot;Survivor in Love&quot;.

===Success with &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot;===
Baltimora&#x27;s first single, &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot;, was released in April 1985, and became a huge European success, peaking at No. 6 on the Italian single chart and entering the top 5 in numerous European countries, including West Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, France, the Netherlands and Norway. The song eventually made it to the United Kingdom charts, where it reached No. 3 in August 1985.

&quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; was released in Canada in October 1985 and peaked on the Canadian charts at No. 5 by the end of the year. However, it took a while for the single to enter the Hot 100 single chart in the United States (where it was released on EMI). When it did, it remained on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart for six months, peaking at No. 13 in February 1986. Baltimora performed on the American TV show &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, which helped further their success in America. The second single, &quot;Woody Boogie&quot;, which also gained notable success, entered the top 20 in West Germany, Switzerland and Sweden.

Baltimora&#x27;s first album, &quot;Living in the Background,&quot; was released in Europe at the end of 1985 and in United States in 1986. Despite the success of &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot;, &quot;Living in the Background&quot; only charted moderately, entering the top 20 album charts only in a few countries in Europe, including Sweden, reaching the no. 49 spot on the US charts.

When Baltimora&#x27;s second album, &quot;Survivor in Love&quot; (1987) and the single &quot;Key Key Karimba&quot; failed to chart, Baltimora lost label support and Bassi decided to disband.

Jimmy McShane died of an AIDS-related illness in March 1995.

<text>James Harry McShane (23 May 1957 – 29 March 1995) was a Northern Irish singer who held both British and Italian citizenship. He achieved recognition as the lead singer of the Italian new wave band Baltimora, most notably with their 1985 hit song &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life and Baltimora===
James Harry McShane was born in Derry, Northern Ireland, on 23 May 1957. He was educated at Long Tower Primary School and then St Joseph&#x27;s and St Peter&#x27;s Secondary Schools. From a young age, he took a great interest in dancing and learned to play the guitar. In a 2018 interview, McShane&#x27;s brother Damien said that McShane had been bullied growing up, but that at the time they had attributed it to his &quot;loud personality,&quot; not realising that he was gay. After his education, he worked at Gransha Hospital and trained as a nurse with the Red Cross.

In the 1970s, McShane relocated to London to attend stage school and performed some small roles in a number of West End musicals. He then began working with English singer Dee D. Jackson and provided the &quot;robotic&quot; backing vocals on her 1978 hit &quot;Automatic Lover&quot;. He toured Europe for 18 months as a stage dancer and backing singer with Jackson and her band. During this time, he discovered Italy and, after becoming attracted to the country&#x27;s underground dance scene, relocated to Milan in 1983. He told Dick Clark on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; in 1986 that he fell in love with Italy, and would later become fluent in Italian and acquire Italian citizenship.

In 1984, McShane met Italian record producer and keyboardist Maurizio Bassi, with whom he created the band Baltimora. The act found worldwide success with its most popular single, &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot;, released in 1985. Some sources state that the lead vocals were performed by Bassi while McShane provided backing vocals, but this still remains uncertain, and McShane appears as the vocalist in the song&#x27;s music video rather than Bassi. The band released two studio albums, &quot;Living in the Background&quot; (1985) and &quot;Survivor in Love&quot; (1987), before disbanding in 1988.

===Final years and death===
In 1992, following the death of his partner of nine years, McShane discovered he was HIV positive and returned to live with his family at his childhood home in Derry. While his family was happy about his return, this was not the case for everyone and indeed at one time he was explicitly attacked for being gay while at a house party in Carnhill; &quot;They beat him, broke his nose and teeth, solely because he was gay,&quot; his brother recalled. On 25 November 1992, he appeared at the Rock Relief concert held at the local venue Rialto, where he provided backing vocals alongside Jeanette Hutton for rock band King Rat&#x27;s set. On 15 February 1993, he was one of the judges for the Gweedor Bar/Harp Lager Battle of the Bands &#x27;93 final, held at the Guildhall. McShane also went on to perform vocals with the local band the Jaywalkers later in the year.

Inspired by the success of Peter Cunnah and his group D Ream, and with encouragement from his friends, McShane booked himself into the local Big River Studios in January 1994 to record some new tracks, with the frontman of the Jaywalkers, Jim Walker, as a collaborator. McShane told the &quot;Derry Journal&quot; that his new music was &quot;much more funk/soul-influenced&quot; than his previous work with Baltimora. None of the recordings were released to the public. In January 1995, McShane announced his intention to re-record &quot;Tarzan Boy&quot; for release as a charity single. All proceeds were to have gone to the Northern Ireland AIDS Helpline and the AIDS clinic at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. There were also future plans to collaborate with Peter Cunnah and D Ream.

McShane died of an AIDS-related illness at his family&#x27;s home on 29 March 1995 at the age of 37. A family spokesman said that he &quot;faced his illness with courage and died with great dignity&quot;. He is buried in Derry City Cemetery next to his father, who died three years prior in 1992.

<doc id="672754" wikidata="Q1705294" url="?curid=672754" title="Pokémon Snap">
<text>is a 1999 first-person photography game with rail shooter style gameplay mechanics developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64. It was first released in Japan in March 1999 and was later released in July 1999 in North America and in September 2000 for PAL regions. It is a spin-off game in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; series, being one of the first console-based games for it, and featuring many Pokémon rendered for the first time in real-time 3D. The game was re-released for the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in December 2007, for the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2016, and for the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in June 2022.

Originally announced as a Nintendo 64DD title, the development of &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was moved to the Nintendo 64 due to the 64DD&#x27;s delays. The gameplay is similar to other first-person games, viewing from the perspective of protagonist Todd Snap as he moves automatically on a rail. The objective of the game is to take pictures of Pokémon with an in-game camera, using items such as apples and &quot;pester balls&quot; to achieve better shots. After each round, players are judged based on the quality of their photos. The Nintendo 64 cartridge could be taken to either Blockbuster or Lawson stores in North America and Japan to have pictures from the game printed on stickers, whereas the Virtual Console version features the ability to send pictures taken in the game to the Wii Message Board and send them to friends.

Its release was promoted heavily by Nintendo, including being featured in more than 86,000 hotels and a contest to send the winner to Australia. By the end of 1999, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; sold 1.5 million copies, and was a strong rental title in 1999 after its release. It was met with a mostly positive reception by critics, described as &quot;addictive&quot; by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot;, and &quot;innovative&quot; by &quot;Electric Playground&quot;. It has also been compared to other video games with photography, such as &quot;Afrika&quot;, &quot;Dead Rising&quot;, and &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot;. It has also been used as a notable example of video games with photography.

A sequel called &quot;New Pokémon Snap&quot; was released for the Nintendo Switch on April 30, 2021.

==Synopsis and gameplay==

, a Pokémon photographer, is summoned by Professor Oak to Pokémon Island, a place with a variety of climatic and geographic regions where Pokémon live relatively undisturbed by humans. Oak needs quality pictures to accompany his scientific findings and knows from past experience that Todd is the right person for the job. Using a motorized, amphibious buggy named the Zero-One, Todd explores the island and takes photographs of the wide variety of Pokémon that inhabit its environments.

From Professor Oak&#x27;s research hub, the player can select between the game&#x27;s levels and features using a menu system. The Zero-One follows a linear path throughout the level, similar to a rail shooter. Up to 60 pictures can be taken per visit. After completing a course, the player selects their best photos of each Pokémon to be rated by Professor Oak and added to the Pokémon Report. Scoring takes into account various aspects of the pictures, such as the Pokémon&#x27;s size, its pose, and keeping the Pokémon in frame. Extra points are awarded for capturing a &quot;special&quot; pose or Pokémon, such as a surfing Pikachu, and if there are multiples of the same Pokémon within the frame. Scoring well in the Pokémon Report and photographing a wide variety of Pokémon is required to make progress in the game. Players can also use an &quot;Album Mark&quot; to bookmark their favorite pictures; this adds the pictures to a personal in-game album to view at a later date or show to friends.

Players start out with only a camera, but as they progress, Professor Oak will provide them with a number of special accessories used to obtain better photographs. The game features seven levels: Beach, Tunnel, Volcano, River, Cave, Valley, and the special course &quot;Rainbow Cloud&quot;. However, the staggered acquisition of accessories ensures that the player must re-explore the courses to discover new material. Levels must be replayed after acquiring new accessories in order to locate hidden Pokémon, alternate routes, or photographic opportunities that yield the best scores. The first accessory, apple-shaped Pokémon food, can be thrown to either stun or attract Pokémon. Another, &quot;Pester Balls&quot;, are able to knock out Pokémon or flush them out of hiding. The Poké-Flute object is used in a variety of ways, such as awakening, irritating, or hatching Pokémon. It can also cause Pokémon to dance, and it can play three different songs, resulting in different dances from certain Pokémon. Additionally, players can obtain a Dash Engine for the Zero One, allowing the vehicle to accelerate and move faster than normal.

The game features 63 of the original generation of 151 Pokémon.

==Development==
===&quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;===
&quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was developed by HAL Laboratory with assistance from Pax Softnica. It originally started out as a non-Pokémon game called &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;. Named after the English fairy tale of the same name, the game was intended for the 64DD, a peripheral for the Nintendo 64. The game was developed at HAL&#x27;s office on the second floor of the Nintendo Kanda building in Sudachō, Tokyo, by a development team called &quot;Jack and Beans&quot;. This name can be seen in the intro video of &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;, as well as in the credits. &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; was first revealed in February 1995, a year before the Japanese release of the N64, but the game was not heard from again. No screenshots or videos have been publicly released of it, and little is known about what the game looked or played like. However, it is speculated that some gameplay elements ended up in &quot;EarthBound 64&quot;, which started development in 1994 but was cancelled in 2000. Benimaru Itoh, one of the art designers of &quot;EarthBound 64&quot;, said in an interview that the game was to feature seeds. When planted, these seeds would grow in real-time, utilising the 64DD&#x27;s internal clock.

===Conversion to Pokémon===
On 27 February 1996, Nintendo affiliate Game Freak released &quot;Pocket Monsters Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; (released in the west as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;). The pair of games became a sleeper hit and were followed the same year by manga and a trading card game. On 1 April 1997, an anime TV series debuted, turning the franchise into a national phenomenon that was later successfully exported to the rest of the world. After progress in the development of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; was deemed unsatisfactory, the idea arose to turn it into a Pokémon spin-off. The game, now known as &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;, was shown at Nintendo Space World &#x27;97. Satoru Iwata, one of the producers of the game, explained in a 2010 interview: &quot;Originally, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; for the Nintendo 64 system wasn&#x27;t a Pokémon game, but rather a normal game in which you took photos, but the motivation for playing the game wasn&#x27;t clear. We wondered what players would enjoy taking pictures of, and later on we made a somewhat forced switch to taking pictures of Pokémon.&quot; Masanobu Yamamoto, one of the character designers, initially had a negative reaction to the switch, since it meant that a lot of work he had put into the project had to be scrapped. He eventually realised the change was for the better though: &quot;That time, adopting the Pokémon world clarified what we should do and the direction we should head, and I came to like Pokémon, so I felt like that had saved us.&quot; During development, the team considered the ability to transfer photos to the Game Boy Camera using the Transfer Pak so that they could be printed using the Game Boy Printer; however, the low quality and black and white nature of the Game Boy Printer&#x27;s output led them to remove the feature.

In 1999, &quot;Mother&quot;/&quot;EarthBound&quot; creator Shigesato Itoi posted a five-part article series about &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; on his site, 1101.com. The series includes interviews with various people involved with the game, including Satoru Iwata and Shigeru Miyamoto.

===Support for 64DD dropped===
After turning the project into a Pokémon game, the title initially continued to be developed with support for the 64DD, an accessory for the Nintendo 64 that used magnetic disk cartridges with a bigger storage capacity, and which featured an internet modem and internal clock. The device made its first public appearance at Shoshinkai 1996, but after numerous delays, it eventually received a limited, Japan-only release on 1 December 1999, with only a handful of games. Almost all of the games that would have a 64DD version, including &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong 64&quot;, were given an N64-only release. In January 1999, the magazine &quot;Dengeki Nintendo 64&quot; announced that &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was also no longer appearing on the 64DD, being published only as an N64 cartridge. Two months later, the game saw its release in Japan.

==Release and promotion==

&quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was released on March 21, 1999, in Japan, July 26, 1999, in North America, and September 15, 2000, in PAL regions.

Nintendo and Japanese convenience store Lawson formed a deal where people could bring their copies of &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; to Lawson stores in Japan and have pictures from the game printed as stickers. A similar deal was formed with Blockbuster, which exclusively printed stickers from players&#x27; copies of &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; in the United States. They hosted a contest called &quot;Take Your Best Shot&quot;, where the player who produces the best picture from &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; to Nintendo would win a trip to Australia. Nintendo, partnering with LodgeNet, included Nintendo 64s with &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; for more than 86,000 hotels with the intent of capitalizing on the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise for the holiday travel season. Nintendo displayed &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; at a &quot;Pokémon&quot; event called &quot;Pokémon League Summer Training Tour&quot;. The game&#x27;s protagonist, Todd Snap, also briefly appeared in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series shortly before the game&#x27;s release.

===Re-releases===
In December 2007, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was re-released for the Wii as a Virtual Console title. While the original release supported the ability to take the cartridge into Blockbuster or Lawson stores in the United States to have taken pictures printed as stickers, the re-release replaced this with the ability to save photos to the Wii message board and share them with friends.

On April 4, 2016, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was re-released in Japan for Wii U as a Virtual Console title. This version was released in Europe and Australia on August 18, 2016, and North America on January 5, 2017.

On June 24, 2022, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was rereleased for Nintendo Switch Online’s Expansion Pack.

==Reception==

===Sales===
&quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was fourth on the chart for top-selling games in Japan for the week of its release, March 18 to March 24. For the week ending May 21, 1999, in Japan, it ranked fifth. In the United States, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; sold in excess of 151,000 copies in the first three days of its release. Since its release, it was the most rented game, up to October 22, 1999. For the month of November, it was featured in the United States&#x27; top 10 list of best-selling video games. For the week ending November 27, it ranked as the 10th best-selling video game, while it remained the most-rented video game for the same week. By the end of 1999, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was the sixth best-selling video game in the United States, having sold in excess of 1.5 million copies. &quot;IGN&quot; attributed this success with &quot;well targeted promotions&quot; and the tie in with Blockbuster. In the United Kingdom, it sold 6,500 units at launch, reaching No.9 in that week&#x27;s charts, and replacing &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; as the top-selling game in the N64 Top Ten chart.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; received positive reviews from the media, scoring 77/100 on Metacritic. &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was included among a test of video games that are fun, safe, easy to play, and of value for children. Ars Technica editor Frank Caron commented that &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; had become a &quot;fan favorite&quot;, while author Marina D&#x27;Amato called it &quot;famous&quot;. Author Amit Dhir called it one of the most popular video games of 1999, alongside &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;. &quot;Kotaku&quot; described it as a &quot;cash-in branded title&quot;. Before its US release, &quot;IGN&quot; praised it as &quot;strange&quot;, yet &quot;fun&quot;. Matt Casamassina of &quot;IGN&quot; called it an &quot;addictive, surprisingly fun&quot; game, noting however that &quot;Pokemaniacs are bound to be disappointed with the selection of Pocket Monsters in the game – roughly 62 out of a possible 151 in all.&quot;

&quot;GameSpot&quot; praised it as a &quot;refreshingly unique game&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; editors Mark Bozon and Casamassina commented on &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;″s likelihood of becoming a Virtual Console title; the former called it a &quot;cult classic&quot; as well as a &quot;fresh and entertaining little package&quot;. While Casamassina again criticized the lack of Pokémon and length, he noted that a Virtual Console re-release would be appropriate, due to it being &quot;simple and quick&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; also called it a &quot;wonderful game for kids of all ages&quot;, though again bemoaning its lack of length. &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; gave the game an 85%. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; four reviewers gave the game two 8/10 scores and two 8.5/10 scores. &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that while &quot;for Pokemon fans, this is a wonderful game&quot;, others will not find it as fun.

&quot;GameRevolution&quot; called it &quot;an absolute must-have for Pokemon fans and kids in general&quot; but &quot;for the rest of us, it&#x27;s actually a decent diversion&quot;. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; editor Victor Lucas called it &quot;innovative&quot; and &quot;worth taking a look at&quot;. Japanese gaming magazine, &quot;Famitsu&quot;, praised it for its &quot;sense of peace&quot;, as well as its reproduction of &quot;the feel of a safari or a theme park.&quot; The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; editor Mike Floyd commented that while it has a &quot;lot of initial flash&quot;, it &quot;lacks depth to make it a great title&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; editor Susan Arendt commented that while &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was considered the &quot;Bastard child of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise&quot; by some, the people in her office loved it. The &quot;Denver Post&quot; editor David Thomas commented that the concept of &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; should have &quot;never worked&quot;, but it turned out to be &quot;one of the most creative and entertaining games on the market&quot;.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editor Aaron Curtiss commented that while he strongly disliked the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was a great game. In the book &quot;Pikachu&#x27;s global adventure: the rise and fall of Pokémon&quot;, author Joseph Jay Tobin called it &quot;innovative&quot; in how it incorporated elements from the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. The magazine &quot;Boys&#x27; Life&quot; called it addictive, praising the reactions of the Pokémon as &quot;unique and always entertaining&quot;. &quot;Allgame&quot; editor Scott Alan Marriott commented that while the number of Pokémon was lacking and there were a small number of courses, the game has a &quot;substantial amount of replay value&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; commented that &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was &quot;just as much fun as the main entries&quot; in the series. 

At the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was awarded Console Children&#x27;s/Family Title of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences. Blockbuster nominated it for best Nintendo 64 game in its &quot;Blockbuster Awards&quot;.

&quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; has been used to describe several other video games, as well as used as an example of photography and aiming in video games; &quot;Game Infowire&quot; called &quot;Beyond Good &amp; Evil&quot; an &quot;odd mixture&quot; of &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank&quot;, &quot;Jak II&quot;, &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, and &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;. &quot;Wired&quot; compared &quot;Sea Life Safari&quot;″s premise to &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;″s. They also compared &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; to &quot;African Safari&quot;. An application called &quot;Virtual Stakeout&quot; was compared by &quot;Kotaku&quot; to &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;. The book &quot;Patterns in game design&quot; used &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; as an example of &quot;aim &amp; shoot&quot; gameplay. Author Raph Koster similarly used &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; in order to describe video games with photography. Author Shanna Compton used &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; as an example of a video game that required players to produce photographs for judges to determine their quality. Developer Wade Tinney attributed the inspiration for the game design of &quot;Snapshot Adventures: Secret of Bird Island&quot; to both &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; and the video game &quot;Spore&quot;. The PlayStation 3 video game &quot;Afrika&quot; was said by both &quot;UGO Networks&quot; and &quot;Shacknews&quot; to be &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;-like. &quot;Dead Rising&quot;″s photography mechanic was also likened to &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;″s by &quot;Kotaku&quot;.

The Virtual Console re-release was met with generally mixed reception. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; editor Marcel Van Duyn praised it as a &quot;fun and a relaxing break from the other &quot;Pokémon&quot; titles&quot;, but criticized it as &quot;super short&quot;. &quot;RPGamer&quot; editor Anna Marie Neufeld criticized it for having &quot;zero replayability&quot; and &quot;if nothing else, a good way to waste an afternoon or evening with the Wii.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; editor Lucas M. Thomas called the photo sharing feature a positive of its release, while criticizing its limited selection of Pokémon, similar to the review of the Nintendo 64 version from &quot;IGN&quot;. He added that a sequel updated to include Wii controls and Pokémon from recent generations would be welcome. &quot;IGN&quot; included &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; in its wish list of Nintendo 3DS remakes, commenting that it could take advantage of the 3DS&#x27; ability to produce stereoscopic 3D photos would be an enjoyable feature for &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; also included &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; in their retrospective of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game series, praising it as &quot;fun and innovative&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; praised it for its visual prowess, citing how it allows players in the United States to see Pokémon in three dimensions. In their &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; retrospective, &quot;Game, Set, Watch&quot; editor Danny Cowan commented that it was a &quot;turnoff for fans&quot;, calling how overlooked it was &quot;tragic&quot;. &quot;Retronauts&quot; speculated that the popularity of &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; was due to being released at the height of &quot;Pokémon&quot; fandom. However, one of the commentators on the podcast, Justin Haywald, found this odd, calling it &quot;horrible.&quot; The podcast discussed briefly the prospects of a &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; sequel, feeling that the Nintendo 3DS&#x27; gyroscope and augmented reality cards could be used, citing &quot;Steel Diver&quot; for its use of the former feature. Retronauts member Jeremy Parish commented that if they didn&#x27;t make such a sequel, it&#x27;s because they are “stupid and don&#x27;t like money.” &quot;IGN&quot; commented that a Pokémon game better than &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;White&quot; was &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot;, stating that &quot;It hasn&#x27;t become stale&quot;, &quot;It has better Pokémon&quot;, and &quot;It made the Pokémon world feel real&quot;. They commented that none of the past Pokémon games &quot;have managed to make the little critters seem as alive as Pokemon Snap did&quot;, and praised the 3D modeling, calling it &quot;glorious&quot;. 1UP.com used &quot;Pokémon Snap&quot; as an example of a game that would use the Wii U controller&#x27;s gyroscope to look around, calling it &quot;The coolest version of Pokémon Snap &quot;ever&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="672758" wikidata="Q3505263" url="?curid=672758" title="Worldsheet">
<text>In string theory, a worldsheet is a two-dimensional manifold which describes the embedding of a string in spacetime. The term was coined by Leonard Susskind as a direct generalization of the world line concept for a point particle in special and general relativity.

The type of string, the geometry of the spacetime in which it propagates, and the presence of long-range background fields (such as gauge fields) are encoded in a two-dimensional conformal field theory defined on the worldsheet. For example, the bosonic string in 26 dimensions has a worldsheet conformal field theory consisting of 26 free scalar bosons. Meanwhile, a superstring worldsheet theory in 10 dimensions consists of 10 free scalar fields and their fermionic superpartners.

== Mathematical formulation ==

=== Bosonic string ===

We begin with the classical formulation of the bosonic string. 

First fix a formula_1-dimensional flat spacetime (formula_1-dimensional Minkowski space), formula_3, which serves as the ambient space for the string.

A world-sheet formula_4 is then an embedded surface, that is, an embedded 2-manifold formula_5, such that the induced metric has signature formula_6 everywhere. Consequently it is possible to locally define coordinates formula_7 where formula_8 is time-like while formula_9 is space-like.

Strings are further classified into open and closed. The topology of the worldsheet of an open string is formula_10, where formula_11, a closed interval, and admits a global coordinate chart formula_12 with formula_13 and formula_14. 

Meanwhile the topology of the worldsheet of a closed string is formula_15, and admits &#x27;coordinates&#x27; formula_12 with formula_13 and formula_18. That is, formula_9 is a periodic coordinate with the identification formula_20. The redundant description (using quotients) can be removed by choosing a representative formula_21.

==== World-sheet metric ====
In order to define the Polyakov action, the world-sheet is equipped with a world-sheet metric formula_22, which also has signature formula_23 but is independent of the induced metric.

Since Weyl transformations are considered a redundancy of the metric structure, the world-sheet is instead considered to be equipped with a conformal class of metrics formula_24. Then formula_25 defines the data of a conformal manifold with signature formula_23.

<text>Po Bronson (born March 14, 1964) is an American journalist and author who lives in San Francisco.

==Early life and education==
Bronson was born in Seattle, Washington. After attending Lakeside School in Seattle, he graduated from Stanford University in 1986, and briefly worked as an assistant bond salesman in San Francisco.

==Career==
Bronson abandoned finance to pursue writing, publishing short stories and eventually a comedic novel based upon his bond trading experiences. This first novel, &quot;Bombardiers&quot; (1995), was an international bestseller. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; reviewed the book saying, &quot;Bronson writes with panache, and while his novel finally lacks the depth of feeling that can distinguish a great satire like &quot;Catch-22&quot;, it&#x27;s a witty and cutting send-up that marks him as a writer with a likely big and bright future.&quot;

Bronson went on to write articles for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; and others, but perhaps became best known for his work in &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and other technology-related publications.

Then, during the rise of the internet/high tech in the late 1990s, Bronson became a leading chronicler of Silicon Valley in its heyday, writing two more best sellers. The first, &quot;The First $20 Million Is Always the Hardest&quot;, was a novel sending up technology start-ups. The second, &quot;The Nudist on the Late Shift&quot;, was a nonfiction portrayal of those who had followed the modern-day gold rush to Silicon Valley.

With the collapse of the internet bubble in 2000, and after creating &quot;The $treet&quot;, a short-lived television drama for Fox again drawing upon his bond trading days, Bronson began searching for a new direction for his career. Realizing he was not alone in this quest, he began to focus on others in similar quandaries. Bronson spent the next two years working on a new nonfiction book, &quot;What Should I Do with My Life?&quot; which profiles about 50 people, exploring how each had confronted the question. The hardcover release of the book was a &quot;New York Times&quot; No. 1 bestseller. It remained on the bestseller list for 22 weeks, and a dozen more in paperback.

Bronson&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;What Should I Do with My Life?&quot; is &quot;Why Do I Love These People?&quot; For that book, Bronson spent three years researching and interviewing over 700 families. The book tells the stories of about 20 people who have had extraordinary experiences with their families.

Partly as a result of the research Bronson did for these two books, he became a columnist for TIME online. His columns frequently draw on his research data to challenge arguments that American society is on a moral decline. For example, he argues against the idea that the institution of marriage has disintegrated from an ideal past filled with stable nuclear families. He also argues that most young adults who live with their parents are not slackers, but are working, attending school, and volunteering full-time.

With co-author Ashley Merryman, he released a book in September 2009 entitled &quot;NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children&quot;. The book discusses theories and scientific aspects of parenting.

in 2015, Po joined Attention Span Media, a strategy consulting firm, as Futurist / Contributing Editor, where he worked on the &quot;Future of Sports&quot; and &quot;Future of Medicine&quot; projects.

In August 2018, Po joined IndieBio as Strategy Director.

<doc id="672766" wikidata="Q371394" url="?curid=672766" title="Bangladesh Liberation War">
<text>The Bangladesh Liberation War (, ), also known as the Bangladesh War of Independence and known as the Liberation War in Bangladesh, was an armed conflict sparked by the rise of the Bengali nationalist and self-determination movement in East Pakistan, which resulted in the independence of Bangladesh. The war began when the Pakistani military junta based in West Pakistan—under the orders of Yahya Khan—launched Operation Searchlight against East Pakistanis on the night of 25 March 1971, initiating the Bangladesh genocide.

In response to the violence, members of the Mukti Bahini—a guerrilla resistance movement formed by Bengali military, paramilitary and civilians—launched a mass guerrilla war against the Pakistani military, liberating numerous towns and cities in the war&#x27;s initial months. At first, the Pakistan Army regained momentum during the monsoon, but Bengali guerrillas counterattacked by carrying out widespread sabotage, including through Operation Jackpot against the Pakistan Navy, while the nascent Bangladesh Air Force flew sorties against Pakistani military bases. India joined the war on 3 December 1971, after Pakistan launched preemptive air strikes on northern India. The subsequent Indo-Pakistani War involved fighting on two fronts; with air supremacy achieved in the eastern theatre and the rapid advance of the Allied Forces of Mukti Bahini and the Indian military, Pakistan surrendered in Dhaka on 16 December 1971, in what remains to date the largest surrender of armed personnel since the Second World War.

Rural and urban areas across East Pakistan saw extensive military operations and air strikes to suppress the tide of civil disobedience that formed after the 1970 election stalemate. The Pakistan Army, backed by Islamists, created radical religious militias—the Razakars, Al-Badr and Al-Shams—to assist it during raids on the local populace. Members of the Pakistani military and supporting militias engaged in mass murder, deportation and genocidal rape, pursuing a systematic campaign of annihilation against nationalist Bengali civilians, students, intelligentsia, religious minorities and armed personnel. The capital, Dhaka, was the scene of numerous massacres, including the Dhaka University massacre. Sectarian violence also broke out between Bengalis and Urdu-speaking Biharis. An estimated 10 million Bengali refugees fled to neighbouring India, while 30 million were internally displaced.

The war changed the geopolitical landscape of South Asia, with the emergence of Bangladesh as the world&#x27;s seventh-most populous country. Due to complex regional alliances, the war was a major episode in Cold War tensions involving the United States, the Soviet Union and China. The majority of member states in the United Nations recognised Bangladesh as a sovereign nation in 1972.

== Background ==
Before the Partition of British India, the Lahore Resolution initially envisaged separate Muslim-majority states in British India&#x27;s eastern and northwestern zones. A proposal for an independent United Bengal was mooted by Prime Minister Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy in 1946 but opposed by the colonial authorities. The East Pakistan Renaissance Society advocated the creation of a sovereign state in eastern British India.

Political negotiations led, in August 1947, to the official birth of two states, Pakistan and India, giving presumably permanent homes for Muslims and Hindus, respectively, after the British departed. The Dominion of Pakistan comprised two geographically and culturally separate areas to the east and the west, with India in between.

The western zone was popularly (and, for a period, also officially) termed West Pakistan and the eastern zone (modern-day Bangladesh) was initially termed East Bengal and later East Pakistan. Although the two zones&#x27; population was close to equal, political power was concentrated in West Pakistan, and it was widely perceived that East Pakistan was being exploited economically, leading to many grievances. Administration of two discontinuous territories was also seen as a challenge.

On 25 March 1971, after an election won by an East Pakistani political party (the Awami League) was ignored by the ruling (West Pakistani) establishment, rising political discontent and cultural nationalism in East Pakistan was met by brutal and suppressive force from the ruling elite of the West Pakistan establishment, in what came to be termed Operation Searchlight. The Pakistan Army&#x27;s violent crackdown led to Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declaring East Pakistan&#x27;s independence as the state of Bangladesh on 26 March 1971. Most Bengalis supported this move, although some Islamists and Biharis opposed it and sided with the Pakistan Army instead.

Pakistani President Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan ordered the Pakistani military to restore the Pakistani government&#x27;s authority, beginning the civil war. The war led a substantial number of refugees (estimated at the time to be about 10 million) to flood India&#x27;s eastern provinces. Facing a mounting humanitarian and economic crisis, India actively aided and organised the Bangladeshi resistance army, the Mukti Bahini.

=== Language controversy ===
In 1948, Governor-General Muhammad Ali Jinnah declared that &quot;Urdu, and only Urdu&quot; would be Pakistan&#x27;s federal language. But Urdu was historically prevalent only in the north, central, and western subcontinent; in East Bengal, the native language was Bengali, one of the two most easterly branches of the Indo-European languages. Bengali speakers constituted over 56% of Pakistan&#x27;s population.

The government stand was widely viewed as an attempt to suppress the culture of the eastern wing. The people of East Bengal demanded that their language be given federal status alongside Urdu and English. The Language Movement began in 1948, as civil society protested the removal of Bengali script from currency and stamps, which were in place since the British Raj.

The movement reached its climax in 1952, when on 21 February, the police fired on protesting students and civilians, causing several deaths. The day is revered in Bangladesh as the Language Movement Day. In memory of the deaths, UNESCO declared 21 February International Mother Language Day in November 1999.

=== Disparities ===
Although, East Pakistan had the larger population, West Pakistan dominated the divided country politically and received more money from the common budget.
East Pakistan was already economically disadvantaged at the time of Pakistan&#x27;s creation yet this economic disparity only increased under Pakistani rule. Factors included not only the deliberate state discrimination in developmental policies but also the fact that the presence of the country&#x27;s capital and more immigrant businessmen in the Western Wing directed greater government allocations there. Due to low numbers of native businessmen in East Pakistan, substantial labour unrest and a tense political environment, there were also much lower foreign investments in the eastern wing. The Pakistani state&#x27;s economic outlook was geared towards urban industry, which was not compatible with East Pakistan&#x27;s mainly agrarian economy.

Also, Bengalis were underrepresented in the Pakistani military. Officers of Bengali origin in the different wings of the armed forces made up just 5% of the overall force by 1965; of these, only a few were in command positions, with the majority in technical or administrative posts. West Pakistanis believed that Bengalis were not &quot;martially inclined&quot;, unlike Pashtuns and Punjabis; Bengalis dismissed the &quot;martial races&quot; notion as ridiculous and humiliating.

Moreover, despite huge defence spending, East Pakistan received none of the benefits, such as contracts, purchasing and military support jobs. The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 over Kashmir also highlighted the sense of military insecurity among Bengalis, as only an under-strength infantry division and 15 combat aircraft without tank support were in East Pakistan to repulse any Indian retaliations during the conflict.

=== Ideological and cultural differences ===
In 1947, the Bengali Muslims had identified themselves with Pakistan&#x27;s Islamic project, but by the 1970s, the people of East Pakistan had given priority to their Bengali ethnicity over their religious identity, desiring a society in accordance with Western principles such as secularism, democracy and socialism. Many Bengali Muslims strongly objected to the Islamist paradigm the Pakistani state imposed.

Most members of West Pakistan&#x27;s ruling elite shared a vision of a liberal society, but nevertheless viewed a common faith as an essential mobilising factor behind Pakistan&#x27;s creation and the subsuming of Pakistan&#x27;s multiple regional identities into one national identity. West Pakistanis were substantially more supportive than East Pakistanis of an Islamic state, a tendency that persisted after 1971.

Cultural and linguistic differences between the two wings gradually outweighed any sense of religious unity. The Bengalis took great pride in their culture and language which, with its Bengali script and vocabulary, was unacceptable to the West Pakistani elite, who believed that it had assimilated considerable Hindu cultural influences. West Pakistanis, in an attempt to &quot;Islamise&quot; the East, wanted the Bengalis to adopt Urdu. The activities of the language movement nurtured a sentiment among Bengalis in favour of discarding Pakistan&#x27;s communalism in favour of secular politics. The Awami League began propagating its secular message through its newspaper to the Bengali readership.

The Awami League&#x27;s emphasis on secularism differentiated it from the Muslim League. In 1971, the Bangladeshi liberation struggle against Pakistan was led by secular leaders and secularists hailed the Bangladeshi victory as the triumph of secular Bengali nationalism over religion-centred Pakistani nationalism. While Pakistan&#x27;s government strives for an Islamic state, Bangladesh was established secular. After the liberation victory, the Awami League attempted to build a secular order and the pro-Pakistan Islamist parties were barred from political participation. The majority of East Pakistani ulama had either remained neutral or supported the Pakistani state, since they felt that the break-up of Pakistan would be detrimental for Islam.

=== Political differences ===
Although East Pakistan accounted for a slight majority of the country&#x27;s population, political power remained in the hands of West Pakistanis. Since a straightforward system of representation based on population would have concentrated political power in East Pakistan, the West Pakistani establishment came up with the &quot;One Unit&quot; scheme, whereby all of West Pakistan was considered one province. This was solely to counterbalance the East wing&#x27;s votes.

After the 1951 assassination of Liaquat Ali Khan, Pakistan&#x27;s first prime minister, political power began to devolve to the new position of President of Pakistan, which replaced the office of Governor General when Pakistan became a republic, and, eventually, the military. The nominal elected chief executive, the Prime Minister, was frequently sacked by the establishment, acting through the President.

The East Pakistanis observed that the West Pakistani establishment swiftly deposed any East Pakistanis elected leader of Pakistan, such as Khawaja Nazimuddin, Mohammad Ali Bogra, Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy, and Iskander Mirza. Their suspicions were further aggravated by the military dictatorships of Ayub Khan (27 October 1958 – 25 March 1969) and Yahya Khan (25 March 1969 – 20 December 1971), both West Pakistanis. The situation reached a climax in 1970, when the Bangladesh Awami League, the largest East Pakistani political party, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a landslide victory in the national elections. The party won 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan, and thus a majority of the 313 seats in the National Assembly. This gave the Awami League the constitutional right to form a government. However, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (a former Foreign Minister), the leader of the Pakistan People&#x27;s Party, refused to allow Rahman to become the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

Instead, he proposed the idea of having two Prime Ministers, one for each wing. The proposal elicited outrage in the east wing, already chafing under the other constitutional innovation, the &quot;One Unit scheme&quot;. Bhutto also refused to accept Rahman&#x27;s Six Points. On 3 March 1971, the two leaders of the two wings along with the President General Yahya Khan met in Dacca to decide the fate of the country.

After their discussions yielded no satisfactory results, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman called for a nationwide strike. Bhutto feared a civil war, therefore, he sent his trusted companion, Mubashir Hassan. A message was conveyed, and Rahman decided to meet Bhutto. Upon his arrival, Rahman met with Bhutto and both agreed to form a coalition government with Rahman as premier and Bhutto as president, but Sheikh Mujib later ruled out such a possibility. Meanwhile, the military was unaware of these developments, and Bhutto increased his pressure on Rahman to reach a decision.

On 7 March 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman (soon to be prime minister) delivered a speech at the Racecourse Ground (now the Suhrawardy Udyan). In this speech he mentioned a further four-point condition to consider at the National Assembly Meeting on 25 March:
* The immediate lifting of martial law.
* Immediate withdrawal of all military personnel to their barracks.
* An inquiry into the loss of life.
* Immediate transfer of power to the elected representative of the people before the assembly meeting 25 March.

He urged his people to turn every house into a fort of resistance. He closed his speech saying, &quot;Our struggle is for our freedom. Our struggle is for our independence.&quot; This speech is considered the main event that inspired the nation to fight for its independence. General Tikka Khan was flown into Dacca to become Governor of East Bengal. East-Pakistani judges, including Justice Siddique, refused to swear him in.

Between 10 and 13 March, Pakistan International Airlines cancelled all its international routes to urgently fly &quot;government passengers&quot; to Dacca. These &quot;government passengers&quot; were almost all Pakistani soldiers in civilian dress. MV &quot;Swat&quot;, a ship of the Pakistan Navy carrying ammunition and soldiers, was harboured in Chittagong Port, but the Bengali workers and sailors at the port refused to unload the ship. A unit of East Pakistan Rifles refused to obey commands to fire on the Bengali demonstrators, beginning a mutiny among the Bengali soldiers.

=== Response to the 1970 cyclone ===

The 1970 Bhola cyclone made landfall on the East Pakistan coastline during the evening of 12 November, around the same time as a local high tide, killing an estimated 300,000 people. A 2017 World Meteorological Organization panel considers it the deadliest tropical cyclone since at least 1873. A week after the landfall, President Khan conceded that his government had made &quot;slips&quot; and &quot;mistakes&quot; in its handling of the relief efforts due to a lack of understanding of the magnitude of the disaster.

A statement released by eleven political leaders in East Pakistan ten days after the cyclone hit charged the government with &quot;gross neglect, callous and utter indifference&quot;. They also accused the president of playing down the magnitude of the problem in news coverage. On 19 November, students held a march in Dacca protesting the slowness of the government&#x27;s response. Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani addressed a rally of 50,000 people on 24 November, where he accused the president of inefficiency and demanded his resignation.

As the conflict between East and West Pakistan developed in March, the Dacca offices of the two government organisations directly involved in relief efforts were closed for at least two weeks, first by a general strike and then by a ban on government work in East Pakistan by the Awami League. With this increase in tension, foreign personnel were evacuated over fears of violence. Relief work continued in the field, but long-term planning was curtailed. This conflict widened into the Bangladesh Liberation War in December and concluded with the creation of Bangladesh. This was one of the first times that a natural event helped trigger a civil war.

=== Operation Searchlight ===

A planned military pacification carried out by the Pakistan Army—codenamed &quot;Operation Searchlight&quot;—started on 25 March 1971 to curb the Bengali independence movement by taking control of the major cities on 26 March, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military, within one month. The Pakistani state used anti-Bihari violence by Bengalis in early March to justify Operation Searchlight.

Before the beginning of the operation, all foreign journalists were systematically deported from East Pakistan.

The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May. The operation also began the Bangladesh genocide. These systematic killings served only to enrage the Bengalis, resulting in East Pakistan&#x27;s secession later that year. Bangladeshi media and reference books in English have published casualty figures that vary greatly, from 5,000 to 35,000 in Dacca, and 300,000 to 3,000,000 for Bangladesh as a whole. Independent researchers, including the British Medical Journal, have put forward figures ranging from 125,000 to 505,000. American political scientist Rudolph Rummel puts total deaths at 1.5 million. The atrocities have been called acts of genocide.

According to the &quot;Asia Times:&quot;

Although the violence focused on the provincial capital, Dacca, it also affected all parts of East Pakistan. Residential halls of the University of Dacca were particularly targeted. The only Hindu residential hall—Jagannath Hall—was destroyed by the Pakistani armed forces, and an estimated 600 to 700 of its residents were murdered. The Pakistani army denied any cold-blooded killings at the university, but the Hamoodur Rahman Commission in Pakistan concluded that overwhelming force was used. This fact, and the massacre at Jagannath Hall and nearby student dormitories of Dacca University, are corroborated by a videotape secretly filmed by Professor Nurul Ula of the East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology, whose residence was directly opposite the student dormitories.

The scale of the atrocities was first made clear in the West, when Anthony Mascarenhas, a Pakistani journalist who had been sent to the province by the military authorities to write a story favourable to Pakistan, instead fled to the United Kingdom and, on 13 June 1971, published an article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; describing the systematic killings by the military. The BBC wrote: &quot;There is little doubt that Mascarenhas&#x27; reportage played its part in ending the war. It helped turn world opinion against Pakistan and encouraged India to play a decisive role&quot;, with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi saying that Mascarenhas&#x27; article led her &quot;to prepare the ground for India&#x27;s armed intervention&quot;.

Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was arrested by the Pakistani Army. Yahya Khan appointed Brigadier (later General) Rahimuddin Khan to preside over a special tribunal prosecuting Rahman with multiple charges. The tribunal&#x27;s sentence was never made public, but Yahya caused the verdict to be held in abeyance in any case. Other Awami League leaders were arrested as well, while a few fled Dacca to avoid arrest. The Awami League was banned by General Yahya Khan.

=== Declaration of independence ===
The violence unleashed by the Pakistani forces on 25 March 1971 proved the last straw to the efforts to negotiate a settlement. Following these incidents, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman signed an official declaration that read:

Sheikh Mujib also called upon the people to resist the occupation forces through a radio message. Rahman was arrested on the night of 25–26 March 1971 at about 1:30 am (as per Radio Pakistan&#x27;s news on 29 March 1971).

A telegram containing the text of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&#x27;s declaration reached some students in Chittagong. The message was translated into Bengali by Manjula Anwar. The students failed to secure permission from higher authorities to broadcast the message from the nearby Agrabad Station of Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation, but the message was read several times by the independent Swadhin Bangla Betar Kendro Radio established by rebel Bangali Radio workers in Kalurghat. Major Ziaur Rahman was requested to provide security for the station and also read the Declaration on 27 March 1971. He broadcast the announcement of the declaration of independence on behalf of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman:

The Kalurghat Radio Station&#x27;s transmission capability was limited, but the message was picked up by a Japanese ship in the Bay of Bengal. It was then re-transmitted by Radio Australia and later by the BBC.

M. A. Hannan, an Awami League leader from Chittagong, is said to have made the first announcement of the declaration of independence over the radio on 26 March 1971.

26 March 1971 is considered the official Independence Day of Bangladesh, and the name Bangladesh was in effect henceforth. In July 1971, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi openly referred to the former East Pakistan as Bangladesh. Some Pakistani and Indian officials continued to use the name &quot;East Pakistan&quot; until 16 December 1971.

== Liberation War ==
=== March–June ===
At first, resistance was spontaneous and disorganised, and was not expected to be prolonged. But when the Pakistani Army cracked down upon the population, resistance grew. The Mukti Bahini became increasingly active. The Pakistani military sought to quell them, but increasingly many Bengali soldiers defected to this underground &quot;Bangladesh army&quot;. These Bengali units slowly merged into the Mukti Bahini and bolstered their weaponry with supplies from India. Pakistan responded by airlifting in two infantry divisions and reorganising their forces. They also raised paramilitary forces of Razakars, Al-Badrs and Al-Shams (mostly members of the Muslim League and other Islamist groups), as well as other Bengalis who opposed independence, and Bihari Muslims who had settled during the time of partition.

On 17 April 1971, a provisional government was formed in Meherpur District in western Bangladesh bordering India with Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was in prison in Pakistan, as president, Syed Nazrul Islam as acting president, Tajuddin Ahmad as prime minister, and General Muhammad Ataul Ghani Osmani as Commander-in-Chief, Bangladesh Forces. As fighting grew between the occupation army and the Bengali Mukti Bahini, an estimated 10 million Bengalis sought refuge in the Indian states of Assam and West Bengal.

=== June–September ===

Bangladesh forces command was set up on 11 July, with Col. M. A. G. Osmani as commander-in-chief (C-in-C) with the status of Cabinet Minister, Lt. Col. Abdur Rabb as chief of Staff (COS), Group Captain A. K. Khandker as Deputy Chief of Staff (DCOS) and Major A. R. Chowdhury as Assistant Chief of Staff (ACOS).

Osmani had differences of opinion with the Indian leadership about the role of the Mukti Bahini in the conflict. Indian leadership initially envisioned a well trained force of 8,000 guerrillas, operating in small cells around Bangladesh to facilitate eventual conventional combat. With the Bangladesh government in exile, Osmani favoured a different strategy:
* Bengali conventional forces would occupy lodgments inside Bangladesh and the Bangladesh government would request international diplomatic recognition and intervention. Initially Mymensingh was picked for this operation, but Osmani later settled on Sylhet.
* Sending the maximum number of guerrillas into Bangladesh as soon as possible with the following objectives:
** Increasing Pakistani casualties through raids and ambush.
** Cripple economic activity by hitting power stations, railway lines, storage depots and communication networks.
** Destroy Pakistan Army mobility by blowing up bridges/culverts, fuel depots, trains and river crafts.
** The strategic objective was to make the Pakistanis spread their forces inside the province, so attacks could be made on isolated Pakistani detachments.

Bangladesh was divided into eleven sectors in July, each with a commander chosen from defected officers of the Pakistani army who joined the Mukti Bahini to lead guerrilla operations. The Mukti Bahini forces were given two to five weeks of training by the Indian army on guerilla warfare. Most of their training camps were near the border area and operated with assistance from India. The 10th Sector was placed under Osmani&#x27;s command and included the Naval Commandos and C-in-C&#x27;s special force. Three brigades (eventually 8 battalions) were raised for conventional warfare; a large guerrilla force (estimated at 100,000) was trained.

Five infantry battalions were reformed and positioned along the northern and eastern borders of Bangladesh. Three more battalions were raised, and artillery batteries were formed. During June and July, Mukti Bahini regrouped across the border with Indian aid through Operation Jackpot and began sending 2,000–5,000 guerrillas across the border, the so-called Monsoon Offensive, which for various reasons (lack of proper training, supply shortage, lack of a proper support network inside Bangladesh) failed to achieve its objectives. Bengali regular forces also attacked border outposts in Mymensingh, Comilla and Sylhet, but the results were mixed. Pakistani authorities concluded that they had successfully contained the Monsoon Offensive, which proved a near-accurate observation.

Guerrilla operations, which slackened during the training phase, picked up after August. Economic and military targets in Dacca were attacked. The major success story was Operation Jackpot, in which naval commandos mined and blew up berthed ships in Chittagong, Mongla, Narayanganj and Chandpur on 15 August 1971.

=== October–December ===

Bangladeshi conventional forces attacked border outposts. Kamalpur, Belonia and the Battle of Boyra are a few examples. 90 out of 370 border outposts fell to Bengali forces. Guerrilla attacks intensified, as did Pakistani and Razakar reprisals on civilian populations. Pakistani forces were reinforced by eight battalions from West Pakistan. The Bangladeshi independence fighters even managed to temporarily capture airstrips at Lalmonirhat and Shalutikar. Both of these were used for flying in supplies and arms from India. Pakistan sent another five battalions from West Pakistan as reinforcements.

== Indian involvement ==



Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi concluded that instead of taking in millions of refugees, India would be economically better off going to war against Pakistan. As early as 28 April 1971, the Indian Cabinet had asked General Manekshaw (Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee) to &quot;Go into East Pakistan&quot;. Hostile relations in the past between India and Pakistan added to India&#x27;s decision to intervene in Pakistan&#x27;s civil war.

As a result, the Indian government decided to support the creation of a separate state for ethnic Bengalis by supporting the Mukti Bahini. RAW helped to organise, train and arm these insurgents. Consequently, the Mukti Bahini succeeded in harassing Pakistani military in East Pakistan, creating conditions conducive to a full-scale Indian military intervention in early December.

The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) launched a preemptive strike on Indian Air Force bases on 3 December 1971. The attack was modelled on the Israeli Air Force&#x27;s Operation Focus during the Six-Day War and intended to neutralise the Indian Air Force planes on the ground. India saw the strike as an open act of unprovoked aggression, which marked the official start of the Indo-Pakistani War. In response to the attack, both India and Pakistan formally acknowledged the &quot;existence of a state of war between the two countries&quot; even though neither government had formally issued a declaration of war.

Three Indian corps were involved in the liberation of East Pakistan. They were supported by nearly three brigades of Mukti Bahini fighting alongside them, and many more who were fighting irregularly. That was far superior to the Pakistani army of three divisions. The Indians quickly overran the country, selectively engaging or bypassing heavily defended strongholds. Pakistani forces were unable to effectively counter the Indian attack, as they had been deployed in small units around the border to counter the guerrilla attacks by the Mukti Bahini. Unable to defend Dacca, the Pakistanis surrendered on 16 December 1971.

=== Air and naval war ===
The Indian Air Force carried out several sorties against Pakistan, and within a week, IAF aircraft dominated the skies of East Pakistan. It achieved near-total air supremacy by the end of the first week, as the entire Pakistani air contingent in the east, PAF No.14 Squadron, was grounded because of Indian and Bangladeshi airstrikes at Tejgaon, Kurmitola, Lalmonirhat and Shamsher Nagar. Sea Hawks from the carrier also struck Chittagong, Barisal and Cox&#x27;s Bazar, destroying the eastern wing of the Pakistan Navy and effectively blockading the East Pakistan ports, cutting off any escape routes for the stranded Pakistani soldiers. The nascent Bangladesh Navy (comprising officers and sailors who defected from the Pakistani Navy) aided the Indians in the marine warfare, carrying out attacks, most notably Operation Jackpot.

== Surrender and aftermath ==

On 16 December 1971, Lt. Gen Amir Abdullah Khan Niazi, Chief Martial Law Administrator of East Pakistan and Commander of Pakistan Army forces in East Pakistan signed the Instrument of Surrender. At the time of surrender only a few countries had provided diplomatic recognition to the new nation. Over 93,000 Pakistani troops surrendered to the Indian forces and Bangladesh Liberation forces, making it the largest surrender since World War II.

Bangladesh sought admission to the UN with most voting in its favour. China vetoed this as Pakistan was its key ally. The United States, also a key ally of Pakistan, was one of the last nations to accord Bangladesh recognition. To ensure a smooth transition, in 1972 the Simla Agreement was signed between India and Pakistan. The treaty ensured that Pakistan recognised the independence of Bangladesh in exchange for the return of the Pakistani PoWs.

India treated all the PoWs in strict accordance with the Geneva Convention, rule 1925. It released more than 93,000 Pakistani PoWs in five months. Further, as a gesture of goodwill, nearly 200 soldiers who were sought for war crimes by Bengalis were pardoned by India. The accord also gave back of land that Indian troops had seized in West Pakistan during the war, though India retained a few strategic areas, most notably Kargil (which was in turn the focal point of a war between the two nations in 1999). This was done as a measure of promoting &quot;lasting peace&quot; and acknowledged by many observers as a sign of maturity by India. But some in India felt the treaty had been too lenient to Bhutto, who had pleaded for leniency, arguing that the fragile democracy in Pakistan would crumble if Pakistanis perceived the accord as overly harsh.

=== Reaction in West Pakistan to the war ===
Reaction to the defeat and dismemberment of half the nation was a shocking loss to top military and civilians alike. Few had expected that they would lose the formal war in under a fortnight, and there was also unsettlement over what was perceived as a meek surrender of the army in East Pakistan. Yahya Khan&#x27;s dictatorship collapsed and gave way to Bhutto, who took the opportunity to rise to power.

General Niazi, who surrendered along with 93,000 troops, was viewed with suspicion and contempt upon his return to Pakistan. He was shunned and branded a traitor. The war also exposed the shortcomings of Pakistan&#x27;s declared strategic doctrine that the &quot;defence of East Pakistan lay in West Pakistan&quot;.

== Atrocities ==

During the war, there were widespread killings and other atrocities—including the displacement of civilians in Bangladesh (East Pakistan at the time) and widespread violations of human rights beginning with Operation Searchlight on 25 March 1971. Members of the Pakistani military and supporting paramilitary forces killed an estimated 300,000 to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Pakistan&#x27;s religious leaders openly supported the crime by labelling Bengali freedom fighters &quot;Hindus&quot; and Bengali women &quot;the booty of war&quot;. In fact, more than 80 percent of the Bengali people were Muslims at that time.

A large section of the intellectual community of Bangladesh were murdered, mostly by the Al-Shams and Al-Badr forces, at the instruction of the Pakistani Army. Just two days before the surrender, on 14 December 1971, Pakistan Army and the Razakar militia (local collaborators) picked up at least 100 physicians, professors, writers and engineers in Dacca, and murdered them, leaving the dead bodies in a mass grave.

Many mass graves have been discovered in Bangladesh. The first night of war on Bengalis, which is documented in telegrams from the American Consulate in Dacca to the U.S. State Department, saw indiscriminate killings of students of Dacca University and other civilians. Numerous women were tortured, raped, and killed during the war; the exact numbers are not known and are debated. The widespread rape of Bangladeshi women led to birth of thousands of war babies.

The Pakistan Army also kept numerous Bengali women as sex slaves inside the Dacca Cantonment. Most were captured from Dacca University and private homes. There was significant sectarian violence not only perpetrated and encouraged by the Pakistani army, but also by Bengali nationalists against non-Bengali minorities, especially Biharis. In June 1971, Bihari representatives said that 500,000 Biharis were killed by Bengalis. R. J. Rummel gives a prudent estimate of 150,000 killed.

On 16 December 2002, the George Washington University&#x27;s National Security Archive published a collection of declassified documents, consisting mostly of communications between U.S. embassy officials and United States Information Service centres in Dacca and India, and officials in Washington, D.C. These documents show that U.S. officials working in diplomatic institutions within Bangladesh used the terms &quot;selective genocide&quot; and &quot;genocide&quot; (see The Blood Telegram) for information on events they had knowledge of at the time. &quot;Genocide&quot; is the term still used to describe the event in almost every major publication and newspaper in Bangladesh, although in Pakistan, the accusations against Pakistani forces continue to be disputed.

== International reactions ==
Following Sheikh Mujibur Rahman&#x27;s declaration of independence in March 1971, a worldwide campaign was undertaken by the Provisional Government of Bangladesh to drum up political support for the independence of East Pakistan as well as humanitarian support for the Bengali people.

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi provided extensive diplomatic and political support to the Bangladesh movement. She toured many countries in a bid to create awareness of the Pakistani atrocities against Bengalis. This effort was to prove vital later during the war, in framing the world&#x27;s context of the war and to justify military action by India. Also, following Pakistan&#x27;s defeat, it ensured prompt recognition of the newly independent state of Bangladesh.

=== United Nations ===

Though the United Nations condemned the human rights violations during and following Operation Searchlight, it failed to defuse the situation politically before the start of the war.

After India entered the war, Pakistan, fearing certain defeat, made urgent appeals to the United Nations to intervene and force India to agree to a ceasefire. The UN Security Council assembled on 4 December 1971 to discuss the hostilities in South Asia. After lengthy discussions on 7 December, the United States made a resolution for &quot;immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of troops&quot;. While supported by the majority, the USSR vetoed the resolution twice. In light of the Pakistani atrocities against Bengalis, the United Kingdom and France abstained on the resolution.

On 12 December, with Pakistan facing imminent defeat, the United States requested that the Security Council be reconvened. Pakistan&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was rushed to New York City to make the case for a resolution on the ceasefire. The council continued deliberations for four days. By the time proposals were finalised, Pakistan&#x27;s forces in the East had surrendered and the war had ended, making the measures merely academic. Bhutto, frustrated by the failure of the resolution and the inaction of the United Nations, ripped up his speech and left the council.

Most UN member nations were quick to recognise Bangladesh within months of its independence.

===Bhutan===
As the Bangladesh Liberation War approached the defeat of the Pakistan Army, the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan became the first state in the world to recognise the newly independent country on 6 December 1971. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the first President of Bangladesh, visited Bhutan to attend the coronation of Jigme Singye Wangchuck, the fourth King of Bhutan in June 1974.

=== US and USSR ===
The US government stood by its old ally Pakistan in terms of diplomacy and military threats. US President Richard Nixon and his National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with which Nixon had been negotiating a &quot;rapprochement&quot; and which he intended to visit in February 1972. Nixon feared that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would mean total Soviet domination of the region, and that it would seriously undermine the global position of the United States and the regional position of United States new tacit ally, China.

To demonstrate to China the &quot;bona fides&quot; of the United States as an ally, and in direct violation of the US Congress-imposed sanctions on Pakistan, Nixon sent military supplies to Pakistan and routed them through Jordan and Iran, while also encouraging China to increase its arms supplies to Pakistan. The Nixon administration also ignored reports it received of the genocidal activities of the Pakistani Army in East Pakistan, most notably the Blood telegram.

Nixon denied getting involved in the situation, saying that it was an internal matter of Pakistan, but when Pakistan&#x27;s defeat seemed certain, he sent the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; to the Bay of Bengal, a move the Indians deemed a nuclear threat. &quot;Enterprise&quot; arrived on station on 11 December 1971. On 6 and 13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two groups of ships, armed with nuclear missiles, from Vladivostok; they trailed US Task Force 74 in the Indian Ocean from 18 December until 7 January 1972.

The Soviet Union supported Bangladesh and Indian armies, as well as the Mukti Bahini during the war, recognising that the independence of Bangladesh would weaken the position of its rivals—the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It gave assurances to India that if a confrontation with the U.S. or China developed, the USSR would take countermeasures. This was enshrined in the Indo-Soviet friendship treaty signed in August 1971. The Soviets also sent a nuclear submarine to ward off the threat posed by USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; in the Indian Ocean.

At the end of the war, the Warsaw Pact countries were among the first to recognise Bangladesh. The Soviet Union accorded recognition to Bangladesh on 25 January 1972. The United States delayed recognition for some months, before according it on 8 April 1972.

=== China ===
As a long-standing ally of Pakistan, the People&#x27;s Republic of China reacted with alarm to the evolving situation in East Pakistan and the prospect of India invading West Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir. On 10 December 1971, Nixon instructed Kissinger to ask the Chinese to move some forces toward the frontier with India. Nixon said, &quot;Threaten to move forces or move them, Henry, that&#x27;s what they must do now&quot;. Kissinger met with Huang Hua, China&#x27;s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, later that evening.

The Chinese did not respond to this encouragement, because unlike the 1962 Sino-Indian War, when India was caught entirely unaware, this time the Indian Army was prepared and had deployed eight mountain divisions to the Sino-Indian border to guard against such an eventuality. China instead threw its weight behind demands for an immediate ceasefire.

When Bangladesh applied for membership to the United Nations in 1972, China vetoed its application because two U.N. resolutions about the repatriation of Pakistani prisoners of war and civilians had not yet been implemented. China was also among the last countries to recognise independent Bangladesh, refusing to do so until 31 August 1975.

=== Sri Lanka ===
Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) saw the partition of Pakistan as an example for itself and feared India might use its enhanced power against it in the future. Despite the left-wing government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike following a neutral non-aligned foreign policy, Sri Lanka decided to help Pakistan in the war. As Pakistani aircraft could not fly over Indian territory, they would have to take a longer route around India and so they stopped at Bandaranaike Airport in Sri Lanka where they were refuelled before flying to East Pakistan.

=== Arab world ===
As many Arab countries were allied with both the United States and Pakistan, it was easy for Kissinger to encourage them to participate. He sent letters to both, the King of Jordan and the King of Saudi Arabia. Nixon gave permission for Jordan to send ten F-104s and promised to provide replacements. According to author Martin Bowman, &quot;Libyan F-5s were reportedly deployed to Sargodha AFB, perhaps as a potential training unit to prepare Pakistani pilots for an influx of more F-5s from Saudi Arabia.&quot;

Libyan dictator Gaddafi also personally directed a strongly worded letter to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi accusing her of aggression against Pakistan, which endeared him to all Pakistanis. In addition to these three countries, an unidentified Middle Eastern ally also supplied Pakistan with Mirage IIIs.

<text>Heart block (HB) is a disorder in the heart&#x27;s rhythm due to a fault in the natural pacemaker. This is caused by an obstruction – a block – in the electrical conduction system of the heart. Sometimes a disorder can be inherited. Despite the severe-sounding name, heart block may cause no symptoms at all in some cases, or occasional missed heartbeats in other cases (which can cause light-headedness, syncope (fainting), and palpitations), or may require the implantation of an artificial pacemaker, depending upon exactly where in the heart conduction is being impaired and how significantly it is affected.

Heart block should not be confused with other conditions, which may or may not be co-occurring, relating to the heart and/or other nearby organs that are or can be serious, including angina (heart-related chest pain), heart attack (myocardial infarction), any type of heart failure, cardiogenic shock or other types of shock, different types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), cardiac arrest, or respiratory arrest.

In severe cases where the heart&#x27;s ability to control and trigger heartbeats may be completely ineffective or unreliable, heart block can usually be treated by inserting an artificial pacemaker, a medical device that provides correct electrical impulses to trigger heart beats, compensating for the natural pacemaker&#x27;s unreliability. Therefore, heart block frequently has no effects, or mild and occasional effects, and is not life-threatening in the vast majority of cases, and is usually treatable in more serious cases.

The human heart uses electrical signals to maintain and initiate the regular heartbeat in a living person; incorrect conduction or interference from external sources can lead to mild or serious symptoms depending upon the location of the blockage and how severely conduction is being blocked. Conduction is initiated by the sinoatrial node (&quot;sinus node&quot; or &quot;SA node&quot;), and then travels to the atrioventricular node (&quot;AV node&quot;) which also contains a secondary &quot;pacemaker&quot; that acts as a backup for the SA nodes, then to the bundle of His and then via the bundle branches to the point of the apex of the fascicular branches. Blockages are therefore classified based on where the blockage occurs – namely the SA node (&quot;Sinoatrial block&quot;), AV node (&quot;AV block&quot; or AVB), and at or below the bundle of His (&quot;Intra-Hisian&quot; or &quot;Infra-Hisian block&quot; respectively). Infra-Hisian blocks may occur at the left or right bundle branches (&quot;bundle branch block&quot;) or the fascicles of the left bundle branch (&quot;fascicular block&quot; or &quot;Hemiblock&quot;). SA and AV node blocks are each divided into three degrees, with second-degree blocks being divided into two types (written either &quot;type I or II&quot; or &quot;type 1 or 2&quot;). The term &quot;Wenckebach block&quot; is also used for second degree type 1 blocks of either the SA or AV node; in addition second-degree blocks type 1 and 2 are also sometimes known as &quot; Mobitz 1&quot; and &quot;Mobitz 2&quot;.

Clinically speaking, the blocks tend to have more serious potential the closer they are to the &quot;end&quot; of the electrical path (the muscles of the heart regulated by the heartbeat), and less serious effects the closer they are to the &quot;start&quot; (at the SA node), because the potential disruption becomes greater as more of the &quot;path&quot; is &quot;blocked&quot; from its &quot;end&quot; point. Therefore, most of the important heart blocks are AV nodal blocks and infra-Hisian blocks. SA blocks are usually of lesser clinical significance, since in the event of SA block, the AV node contains a secondary pacemaker which would still maintain a heart rate of around 40–60 beats per minute, sufficient for consciousness and much of daily life in the majority of individuals.

==Types==


Following the path of the electrical signals, the places where conduction can be blocked give rise to different kinds of heart blocks:

SA and AV node blocks are each divided into three degrees, with second degree blocks being divided into two types (written either &quot;type I or II&quot; or &quot;type 1 or 2&quot;). In an SA block, the electrical impulse is delayed or blocked on the way to the atria, thus delaying atrial depolarization. By contrast, an AV block occurs in the AV node and delays ventricular depolarization. The term &quot;Wenckebach block&quot; is also used for some heart blocks, and can refer to a second degree type I block in &quot;either the SA node or the AV node&quot;, however the ECG features of the two are quite distinctly different.

===SA nodal blocks===
SA blocks rarely give severe symptoms, because even if an individual had complete block at this level of the conduction system (which is uncommon), the secondary pacemaker of the heart would be at the AV node, which would fire at 40 to 60 beats a minute, which is enough to retain consciousness in the resting state. However SA block is capable of causing problematic symptoms even so, and may also hint at conduction issues elsewhere in the heart, and therefore SA blocks are – despite their lower level of life-threatening risk – still &quot;the most common indication for pacemaker implantation in the US&quot;.

Types of SA nodal blocks include:
* SA node Wenckebach (Mobitz I)
* SA node Mobitz II
* SA node exit block

In addition to the above blocks, the SA node can be suppressed by any other arrhythmia that reaches it. This includes retrograde conduction from the ventricles, ectopic atrial beats, atrial fibrillation, and atrial flutter.

The difference between SA node block and SA node suppression is that in SA node block an electrical impulse is generated by the SA node that doesn&#x27;t make the atria contract. In SA node suppression, on the other hand, the SA node doesn&#x27;t generate an electrical impulse because it is reset by the electrical impulse that enters the SA node.

===AV nodal blocks===
There are three basic types of AV nodal block:
* First-degree AV block
* Second-degree AV block
** Type 1 second-degree AV block (Mobitz I), also known as a Wenckebach block
** Type 2 second-degree AV block (Mobitz II), also known as a Hay block – due to a block in or below the bundle of His
* Third-degree AV block (complete heart block)

===Infra-Hisian block===
Infra-Hisian block is that of the distal conduction system. Types of infra-Hisian block include:
* Type 2 second degree heart block (Mobitz II) – a type of AV block due to a block within or below the bundle of His
** Left anterior fascicular block
** Left posterior fascicular block
* Right bundle branch block
* Left bundle branch block

Of these types of infra-Hisian block, Mobitz II heart block is considered most important because of the possible progression to complete heart block.

<text>Ouistreham () is a commune in the Calvados department in Normandy region in northwestern France.

Ouistreham is a small port with fishing boats, leisure craft and a ferry harbour. It serves as the port of the city of Caen. The town borders the mouth of the Canal de Caen à la Mer.

== Etymology ==
The name Ouistreham derives from Saxon , meaning &#x27;village&#x27;. There is no clear explanation for the first part of the name. A popular etymology is based on Middle French (Old French ), meaning &#x27;oyster&#x27;. Most linguists agree on a Saxon origin, meaning Western or West (though some other linguists have claimed that it derives from the Saxon word meaning Eastern), because of the presence of Saxon-speaking settlers from England in Viking Normandy. Following this theory, &#x27;Ouistreham&#x27; is a homonym of &#x27;Westerham&#x27; in Kent.

== History ==
Ouistreham has been a trading port since the Middle Ages. The harbour is now a part of &quot;Port de Caen-Ouistreham&quot;. Since the beginning of the 20th century, it has been a bathing beach on the &quot;Riva Bella&quot;.

On 6 June 1944, No. 4 Commando landed at Ouistreham (codenamed Sword) and fought their way to Pegasus Bridge, with the 177 Free French of the No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando given the honour of spearheading the advance. The assault on Ouistreham was featured in the movie &quot;The Longest Day&quot;, although the film location for Ouistreham was at the nearby village of Port-en-Bessin.

A &quot;Roman camp&quot; (Catillon or Castillon) was located on the left bank of the Orne near Bénouville. It has been leveled, only a small part of the northwest rampart remains. In reality, modern archeology excludes the hypothesis that it is a Roman camp, at least not from the High Empire, archaeologists having never unveiled a Roman camp dating from this period in the North from Gaul, apart from Arlaines at Ressons-le-Long (Aisne), and probably not from the Lower Empire either. The expression Roman Camp or Caesar&#x27;s Camp generally applies to works dating from the Iron Age or the Middle Ages.

The Saint-Samson church and the tithe barn make from the border of the town of Ouistreham the heart of this city. Its proximity to the sea meant that the town developed towards the shore, to the north. Ouistreham was a village of fishermen and farmers where the activity was also linked to maritime trade. Ouistreham experienced the development of its port thanks to the extraction and export of Caen and Ranville stone. There are still some typical fishermen&#x27;s houses in this town.

In 1779, to protect the shore of the Orne from English attacks, it was decided to build three redoubts according to Vauban&#x27;s plans, at Ouistreham, Colleville and Merville. These redoubts were disarmed in 1816, that of Ouistreham was sold to a private individual who transformed it into a mansion. Remains of the redoubt are still visible at the &quot;Petit Château de la Redoute&quot; at 38 boulevard Boivin-Champeaux.

In 1866, a first villa was built near the beach. Its owner, Mr. Longpré, manufacturer of corsets in Caen, gave it the name of Belle Rive. A painter who had noticed that the sunsets on the shores of Ouistreham resembled those he had had the opportunity to admire in Italy, de Belle Rive made it Riva Bella. Little by little the dunes and swamps disappear to give way to villas and the first casino is built.

At the very beginning of the 20th century, the seaside resort developed around these luxurious villas and leisure facilities: thalassotherapy and the Ouistreham casino. On 15 August 1891 the société anonyme des Établissements Decauville Aîné provisionally opened a narrow-gauge railway of local interest (60 cm) between Ouistreham and Luc-sur-Mer. This line, extended in 1891–1892 to Dives-sur-Mer and Caen, was taken over in 1894 by the Société anonyme des Chemins de fer du Calvados. It will remain for a long time the most profitable line of the Calvados Railways network. While the other lines were closed one after the other in the 1930s, the Luc - Ouistreham - Caen line was retained. Damaged during the landing, it closed in 1944.

During the Second World War, Ouistreham was occupied by German troops. From 1942, the beach area became a no man&#x27;s land; 123 villas by the sea were demolished to make way for the defenses of the Atlantic Wall: 80 concrete structures and an artillery observation post overlooking the beach “the big bunker” were built. On 6 June 1944 this surveillance post became a strategic place and its capture ensured the landing point on the beach of Sword Beach. Commander Philippe Kieffer&#x27;s No. 4 commando comprising the 177 French marines (forming an integral part of Lord Lovat&#x27;s first special brigade) then reached the bridges of Bénouville (Pegasus Bridge) and Ranville and thus operated the junction with the paratroopers of the 6th DAP (British Airborne) after street fighting in Ouistreham.

On 6 June 2014 Ouistreham hosted the international ceremony for the 70th anniversary of the Normandy landings and battle (5 million viewers in France alone; 1.2 billion worldwide). There were 1,800 veterans, 19 heads of state and 8,000 guests of honor and people from Ouistreham in the stands.

==In literature==
Georges Simenon set a Maigret story in Ouistreham entitled &quot;Le port des brumes&quot; or &quot;The Misty Harbour&quot; in English. Published first in 1932, Simenon - who had a deep interest in canals and waterways - evoked the nature and atmosphere of the port at that time.

==Population==
==Transportation==
The port of Ouistreham has a scheduled cross-Channel ferry service to Portsmouth, operated by Brittany Ferries. During 2017, Ouistreham became a new focal point for migrants and refugees trying to cross the Channel, leading the British government to contribute to improved security there.

==International relations==
Ouistreham is twinned with:

* Angmering in England (since 1976)
* Braine-l&#x27;Alleud in Belgium
* Lohr am Main in Germany

==Government career==
After retiring from the Army in 2006, Kimmitt served as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Middle East Policy, responsible for military policy development, planning, guidance and oversight for the region. Kimmitt served in this position until July 31, 2008, before being nominated as Assistant Secretary of State. Kimmitt&#x27;s nomination was delayed because of two investigations into anonymous letters sent to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but was ultimately confirmed, and was sworn as Assistant Secretary of State on August 8, 2008. In this role, Kimmitt was responsible for State Department political-military policy, with particular emphasis on security assistance and sales of arms around the world, as well as serving as the primary liaison between the Departments of State and Defense. He was also instrumental in recent counter-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia, and negotiated the groundbreaking arrangements for the prosecution of pirates abroad. He left office in January 2009.

===Nomination delay===

Kimmitt&#x27;s nomination for Assistant Secretary of State was delayed because of two investigations into anonymous letters sent to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Upon receipt of each letter, Sen. Joseph Biden requested that the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (IG) investigate the allegations. After a four-month investigation, the IG concluded after the first investigation that &quot;BG Kimmitt&#x27;s leadership style was occasionally inconsistent with the standards expected for senior Government leaders&quot; and that &quot;cognizant management officials should continue to monitor his leadership style.&quot; &quot;[T]estimony indicated that morale In BG Kimmitt&#x27;s organization was negatively affected by BG Kimmitt&#x27;s leadership style, combined with the heavy workload and long hours. Finally, we found that BG Kimmitt&#x27;s leadership style discouraged subordinates from free and open communication with him.&quot; The report also stated that the IG &quot;obtained testimonial evidence that tended to mitigate the adverse impact of BG Kimmitt&#x27;s leadership lapses. In that regard several witnesses, primarily BG Kimmitt&#x27;s superiors, emphasized that BG Kimmitt brings superb qualifications and intellect to his position; that he has strengthened the overall performance of his office; and that he operates in a stressful, demanding environment, which could trigger confrontation.&quot; The Department of Defense Inspector General&#x27;s office, in a separate letter to the committee, also disclosed &quot;a substantiated allegation that Mr. Kimmitt ... failed to properly safeguard information, in violation of Army regulations,&quot; but it did not elaborate. The exact nature of this violation has not been disclosed.

==Controversy==
After the Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre in 2004, Kimmitt said, &quot;There was no evidence of a wedding: no decorations, no musical instruments found, no large quantities of food or leftover servings one would expect from a wedding celebration. There may have been some kind of celebration. Bad people have celebrations, too.&quot; 

Video footage obtained by the Associated Press seems to contradict this view. The video shows a series of scenes of a wedding celebration, and footage from the following day showing fragments of musical instruments, pots and pans and brightly colored beddings used for celebrations, scattered around a destroyed tent.

<doc id="672773" wikidata="Q5901972" url="?curid=672773" title="Horace Mann School">
<text>Horace Mann School (also known as Horace Mann or HM) is an American private, independent college-preparatory school in the Bronx, founded in 1887. Horace Mann is a member of the Ivy Preparatory School League, educating students from the New York metropolitan area from nursery school to the twelfth grade. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Divisions are located in Riverdale, a neighborhood of the Bronx, while the Nursery School is located in Manhattan. The John Dorr Nature Laboratory, a campus in Washington Depot, Connecticut, serves as the school&#x27;s outdoor and community education center. 

==History==

===19th century===
The school was founded in 1887 by Nicholas Murray Butler as a co-educational experimental and developmental unit of Teachers College at Columbia University. Its first location was 9 University Place in Manhattan&#x27;s Greenwich Village. The school moved in 1901 to 120th Street in Morningside Heights. Horace Mann became independent of the Columbia University and Teachers College in 1940.

===20th century===
The school split into separate all-male and all-female schools and in 1914, the Boys&#x27; School moved to 246th Street in Riverdale, Bronx, and during the 1940s it severed formal ties with Columbia University and became Horace Mann School. The Horace Mann School for Girls remained at Teachers College, and then merged with the Lincoln School in 1940, and finally closed in 1946.

The New York School for Nursery Years (founded in 1954 on 90th Street in Manhattan) became the Horace Mann School for Nursery Years in 1968, and was co-ed. In 1972, Horace Mann merged with the Barnard School for Boys, next door in Riverdale, to form the Horace Mann-Barnard Lower School for kindergarten through grade six, located on the former Barnard School campus. At that point, only the lower school was mixed. In 1975, the Horace Mann School returned to its roots as a co-educational learning environment and began admitting girls to the Upper School. The Class of 1976 is Horace Mann School&#x27;s last all-male class. In 1999, the sixth grade moved from the Horace Mann-Barnard campus to the main 246th Street campus and formed a distinct Middle Division along with the seventh and eighth grades.

The Horace Mann School was named after Horace Mann, who was a lawyer who served in the Massachusetts State Legislature and was the first secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education from 1837 and 1848, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the first president of Antioch College. He used each of his positions to proclaim that every person, regardless of their background, should receive a public education based on the principles and practices of a free society. Mann played a leading role in establishing the U.S. elementary school system.

==Institution==
The school is a private &quot;nonprofit organization under the Education Law of New York State and holds a charter from the New York State Board of Regents [and is] a 501(c) 3 [tax-exempt] organization authorized by the Internal Revenue Service&quot;.

===Divisions===

There are four divisions of Horace Mann, all co-educational: a Nursery Division (three-year-olds through kindergarten) located on 90th Street in Manhattan, a Lower Division (kindergarten through fifth grades) on the Horace Mann campus on Tibbett Avenue in Riverdale, a Middle Division (sixth through eighth grades) on the 246th Street campus in Riverdale, and an Upper Division (ninth through twelfth grades) also on the 246th Street campus. There is also the John Dorr Nature Laboratory, located on of land in Washington Depot, Connecticut, used for extended field trips for classes of students starting in second grade and an orientation program for new students entering the Middle or Upper Divisions. The Dorr facility was recently renovated and is currently LEED-certified by the U.S. Green Building Council.

Current tuition for students in the Lower Division through the Upper Division is $61,900 a year. Financial aid at the school is solely based on need. For the 2023–24 academic year, 15% of the students received more than $14 million in aid.

===Academics===
HM offers twenty-six Honors courses and seven foreign languages.

Students in the Upper Division are required to study English, United States history, biology, chemistry, or physics or both, geometry, algebra, and trigonometry, and also meet various requirements in the arts, computer science, health and counseling, and physical education. Students must go beyond these basic requirements in at least some, if not all, subjects. They are also required to take at least through the levels-three courses of either Chinese, French, Japanese, or Spanish. Half credit foreign language classes are also offered for Greek and Latin.

Starting in eleventh grade, students have more flexibility with their requirements and can choose from courses in biotechnology, calculus, economics, ethics, psychology, religion, political philosophy, United States legal history, art history, and statistics, among other elective classes.

===Non-academic requirements===
All students are required to take a swim test and American Red Cross CPR certification in order to graduate.

Community service is required throughout the curriculum. During high school students are required to attend grade-wide &quot;Service-Learning Days&quot;. The school additionally offers extracurricular additional &quot;service-learning&quot; to high school students as participants in its &quot;Service-Learning Team&quot; or &quot;HM 246&quot;. In eighth grade, one out-of-school project or three in-school projects are necessary for graduation to the ninth grade; in sixth and seventh grades a homeroom project is done cooperatively. In the Lower and Nursery Divisions, there is an annual &quot;Caring-in-Action&quot; day dedicated to community service that students and their families can attend.

===Admission===

Admission is selective with decisions based on recent grades, an interview, an essay, and the candidate&#x27;s score on either the ISEE or SSAT test. The largest point of entry is in sixth grade, with between 50 and 55 places available each year. In the ninth grade, 40 to 45 new students are traditionally enrolled.

===Rankings===
In 2017, Niche ranked HM the best private K-12 school in the United States. Three years later, in 2020, Niche ranked HM the third-best best K–12 private school in the country and the 12th-best private high school in the country. In 2024, the Niche survey ranked Horace Mann the fifth-best private high school in the country. 

== Sexual abuse scandal ==

=== Initial reports ===
On June 6, 2012, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; published an article by a former student, alleging multiple instances of sexual abuse of students by teachers at the school. The incidents occurred during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. The article also addressed how school administrators dealt with the incidents over time, both within the school community and, in the case of one teacher, in a post-employment reference. The victims were identified by partial name or letter. The New York State statute of limitations in most or all of the incidents ran out when the former students turned 23. Several of the central figures were dead, at least two by suicide—one of the accused, and one of the students. One of the accused, music teacher Johannes Somary, died in 2011. On June 23, 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Tek Young Lin, Horace Mann&#x27;s former chaplain who also served as an English teacher and track coach, admitted that he had had sexual relations with several male students.

=== Hilltop Cares Foundation ===
As a result of the sexual abuse and resulting controversy, the Hilltop Cares Foundation was formed in the summer of 2012 by members of the Horace Mann community, including alumni, to help victims from the school and to promote healing. The charitable organization helps alumni with their therapy costs and addresses related issues in the broader community. It is a nonprofit and independent of the school’s administration and board of trustees. The Chair for Hilltop Cares said they strive to bring healing to the Horace Mann community.

=== Negotiations ===
In March 2013, the school was reportedly in negotiation with more than thirty students for compensation related to the abuse claims. Eighteen different faculty members had been accused, and events spanning the four decades prior to 2000 identified. In March 2013, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; published an article discussing sexual abuse allegations against former Horace Mann English teacher Robert Berman. In April, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported the school had reached a settlement with about 27 of the 37 students identified as having been abused. The school formally apologized on May 24 to the community for the events that had occurred and published the actions the school has taken and protocols which were put in place to protect current and future students.

<doc id="672775" wikidata="Q1429430" url="?curid=672775" title="Genesis Live">
<text>Genesis Live is the first live album from the English rock band Genesis, released on 20 July 1973 on Charisma Records. Initially recorded for radio broadcast on the American rock program &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot;, the album is formed from the recordings of shows at Free Trade Hall, Manchester and De Montfort Hall, Leicester in February 1973 during the band&#x27;s tour supporting their fourth studio album &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972).

&quot;Genesis Live&quot; is the band&#x27;s first album to enter the top 10 in the UK, reaching No. 9. Following its US release in 1974, it peaked at No. 105.

== History ==
Genesis were persuaded by their label, Charisma Records, to release &quot;Genesis Live&quot; as a budget-priced title to mark time while the band recorded &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; in mid-1973. The group&#x27;s manager, Tony Stratton Smith said that the low price would allow it to be sold in stores such as Woolworths and WHSmith. &quot;Genesis Live&quot; was issued in the US several months after &quot;Selling England&quot;&#x27;s release, which upset Gabriel as the album included songs from their old live sets and was quickly recorded with little care given to the quality of the recordings. When Gabriel reluctantly agreed to have the album released, part of the deal was that it would not be issued in the US.

The album was recorded when the band was touring in support of &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, by the Pye Mobile Recording Unit, engineer Alan Perkins; all tracks were recorded at De Montfort Hall, Leicester, England on except for &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot;, which was recorded at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, England on the previous day. These recordings were originally made for the U.S. radio show King Biscuit Flower Hour, though they were never broadcast. John Burns mixed the multi-track tapes in July 1973.

A handful of early radio promotional double-LP test pressings were created which included a 23-minute version of &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; from the Leicester show. This album&#x27;s running order was &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;, &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, &quot;Get &#x27;Em Out by Friday&quot;, &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Giant Hogweed&quot;, &quot;The Knife&quot;, and included between-song patter by Gabriel. &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; was not included in the officially released version, even though the front cover photograph was taken during a live performance of the song (with Gabriel donning the &quot;Magog&quot; mask). A live recording of &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; from later that same year was released on 1998&#x27;s 4-CD boxed set, &quot;Genesis Archive 1967–75&quot;. However, Gabriel re-recorded some vocals for that release.

A remastered version was released on CD in 1994 by Virgin in Europe and Atlantic in the US and Canada. A remixed version was included in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Genesis Live 1973–2007&quot; set, also released by Virgin in Europe and Atlantic in the U.S. and Canada.

A surrealistic short story by Peter Gabriel was printed on the back cover of the album. William Friedkin, who directed the film &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, read the story and was interested in possibly working with Gabriel on a film. Discussions with Friedkin took Gabriel away from the 1974 recording of &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;, his final album with the group.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a brief but positive review, commenting that &quot;this album goes a long way toward capturing the gripping power and mysticism that has many fans acclaiming Genesis as &#x27;the greatest live band ever.

A retrospective review by AllMusic was also resoundingly positive. They remarked &quot;it&#x27;s doubtful that anyone ever got a richer sound out of a Mellotron on-stage than Tony Banks does on this album, and Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford, and Phil Collins&#x27; playing is all quite amazing as a whole unit, holding together some very complex music in a live setting&quot;. They judged all the recordings to be far superior to their studio originals.

== Geography ==
It bordered the district of Grevenmacher to the east, the district of Diekirch to the north, the Belgian province of Luxembourg (Wallonia) to the west and the French Département of Moselle (Grand Est) to the south. 

== History ==
When the districts were created on 24 February 1843, Luxembourg was one of the three of the country.

On 30 May 1857, the Mersch canton was taken from the Luxembourg district to made part of the new district of Mersch. on 4 May 1867, the new district was abolished and the Mersch canton was made again a part of the Luxembourg district.

On 2012, the communes of Bascharage and Clemency were combined to make the new commune of Käerjeng. So the number of communes changed from 47 to 46.

After the reorganization of Luxembourg&#x27;s administrative divisions in 2015, all three districts were abolished per 3 October 2015.

<text>St Germans () is a village and civil parish in east Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It stands on the River Tiddy, just upstream of where that river joins the River Lynher; the water way from St Germans to the Hamoaze is also known as St Germans River.
It takes its name from the St. German&#x27;s Priory, generally associated with St Germanus, although the church may have been associated initially with a local saint, who was gradually replaced by the 14th century. This Norman church is adjacent to the Port Eliot estate of the present Earl of St Germans.

The other villages in the historic parish were Tideford, Hessenford, Narkurs, Polbathic, and Bethany, but new ecclesiastical parishes were established in 1834 (St Anne&#x27;s Church, Hessenford) and 1852 (Tideford). In 1997 part of the St Germans parish was made into Deviock parish. The area of the civil parish is , and it has a population of 1,427, increasing to 1,453 at the 2011 census. An electoral ward with the name &quot;St Germans&quot; also exists. The population at the 2011 census was 4,301.

==Parliamentary borough==

The village was one of the rotten boroughs, electing two members to the unreformed House of Commons until the Reform Act 1832. As in many of the Cornish rotten boroughs, the franchise in St Germans was restricted to a tiny number of &quot;freemen&quot;, rather than to all residents, but even they were not numerous—by the time of the Reform Bill, the male population of the borough was only 247. However, the previous census had shown that the whole parish (of which the borough made up only a fraction) had a population of 2,404, and the initial proposal was that St Germans should lose only one of its two MPs; but the Whig government subsequently decided that the availability of sufficient population in a surrounding parish should not save a borough from disfranchisement unless a substantial part of that population was already within the borough boundaries, amending the bill&#x27;s schedules so as to extinguish both of the St Germans MPs. The Tory opposition attacked the decision as politically motivated (St Germans was a Tory borough), and the vote in the Commons was one of the narrowest in the entire Reform Bill debates.

The seal of the borough of St Germans was St German seated on a throne, with the legend &quot;S. Prepositure Sci Germani in laya&quot;.

==Landmarks==

There is a stone cross at Carracawn dedicated to the members of the parish who died in the First and Second World Wars .

==Church history==

===See of St Germans===
St Germans was originally the seat of the Bishop of Cornwall before the see was combined with that of Crediton in 1042. Today the Bishop of Truro&#x27;s assistant (suffragan) bishop is known as the Bishop of St Germans in acknowledgement of this, although he has no specific links with the village. The first of these bishops was appointed in 1905. Under its Latin name of &#x27;, the see is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees. The adjectival form of the name of the see is &#x27;, meaning &quot;Cornish&quot; or &quot;of Cornwall&quot;.

===St Germans Priory Church===
===John of Cornwall===
John of Cornwall, in Latin , was a Christian scholar and teacher, who was living in Paris about 1176. Little is known of his life. From his names, it is surmised that he was a native of St Germans.

==Almshouses==

Sir William Moyle&#x27;s Almshouses, also known as the Galleries, date from 1583. They are unusual in that they consisted of six one-room apartments on the ground floor and a further six on the first floor. The upper rooms open onto a gallery along the front of the range, which is reached by stairs at either end. The almshouses were converted into four separate dwellings in the 20th century; it is a Grade II* listed building.

==Fishing quay, railway station and viaduct==
It was originally a busy fishing village in the 19th century. The St Germans Quay was busy in the last century with cargoes of timber, coal and limestone and materials for the building of the railway that was to bring about the demise of river trade . Until the last war the trade in roadstone continued. Now St Germans Quay is home to the village sailing club: the Quay Sailing Club (QSC). The sailing club is now well established and plays a part in the life of the village.

St Germans railway station was opened on 4 May 1859 at the west end of St Germans viaduct, 106 feet above the quay. It is notable for having the best-preserved Cornwall Railway station buildings.

==May Fair==
There are references in St Germans to a fair in 1284, as well as a second fair on Lammas Day. A rental of Landrake Manor made in 1652 says &#x27;there was a Fayre keept yeerely within the Towne of St Germans upon the Last Tursday in Maye&#x27; but notes that the fair has decayed and ended under Cromwell&#x27;s government. However the fair was revived shortly after the Restoration, possibly due to the similarly timed Oak Apple Day to celebrate the Restoration, and there are multiple references to it from then on. Indeed, it is listed annually in local newspapers until the late 1950s, with the date of the fair held on the nearest possible day to 28 May.

Robert Hunt in &quot;Popular Romances of the West of England&quot; describes a two-day festival, that took place on the 28th and 29 May. On 28 May, a &#x27;mock mayor&#x27; was chosen &#x27;with many formalities, remarkable only for their rude and rough nature&#x27;, and cattle were brought into the village for the fair. On the 29th the mock mayor, who had been &#x27;supping too freely of the fair ale&#x27;, was pulled around on a cart to claim his pretend jurisdiction. On this day, anyone entering the village without the leaf or branch of an oak leaf in his hat was thrown in the trough of water fed by a stream on Nut Tree Hill.

On 27 May 2012, the fair was revived. A new &quot;mock mayor&quot; was elected, and a symbolic May tree was paraded through the village. This is a wooden, decorated garland that is symbolic of a walnut nut tree that once stood on the green at the top of present-day Old Quay lane. It was felled between 1865 and 1870, and it was rumoured the wood was used to build cabinets in Port Eliot. Recently a small walnut wood cabinet was re-discovered in church storage and shown to the community during the 2018 May Tree Fair.

== Cricket ==
In the late 19th Century the Earl of St Germans had a cricket ground purposely built about a mile West of St Germans along the B3249. The sloping land was excavated and tree trunks were laid as a base before being covered with top soil to give a flat playing surfaces thus making it one of the first purpose built cricket grounds in the county. St Germans Cricket Club played on the ground until folding in the early 1970s. From 1975 the ground has been the home ground of Tideford Cricket Club who re-located from a site they had been using near Trerulefoot. The views from the ground stretch out to the East as far as Maker Church (7 miles away) and several miles to the South across the valley to the Plymouth – Penzance railway line. To the North the ground is bordered by woods. Whilst the ground is very picturesque the facilities are basic with no mains electricity available (quoted £15K for installation in the 1990s). Tideford Cricket Club runs 2 adult teams (Cornwall Cricket League) and several junior age group teams (West Devon Youth League).

<text>The Egypt Exploration Society (EES) is a British non-profit organization. The society was founded in 1882 by Amelia Edwards and Reginald Stuart Poole in order to examine and excavate in the areas of Egypt and Sudan. The intent was to study and analyze the results of the excavations and publish the information for the scholarly world. 

The organization has worked at many major Egyptian excavation and sites. Their discoveries include the discovery of a shrine for the goddess Hathor, a statue of a cow from Deir el-Bahri, the mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut, and the sculpted model of Nefertiti from Amarna. The organization has made major contributions to the study of the ancient Egyptian world. It is based in London and is a registered charity under English law.

==History==
In 1873, the English writer Amelia Edwards was led to the sites of Egypt while encountering cold, wet climates in Europe. She and several friends ended up travelling up the Nile River from Cairo to Abu Simbel. She recorded the events and discoveries of this journey and eventually published it as &quot;A Thousand Miles up the Nile&quot; in 1876. The book became renowned for its description of 19th-century Egypt and the largely un-excavated antiques that she encountered. Edwards&#x27; descriptions changed the world&#x27;s perspective on both modern and ancient Egypt. This attracted the attention of both scholarly society and the rest of the world. It ended up becoming a bestseller due to this increased interest, which prompted Edwards to think about continuing her studies of ancient Egypt. 

In 1882, Amelia Edwards and Reginald Stuart Poole, an employee from the Department of Coins and Medals at the British Museum, decided to create the Egypt Exploration Fund as a way to raise funds for more excavations in the Nile Delta, which had been noted as being rarely visited. After announcing their intentions in &quot;The Times&quot;, they started off being funded by individuals such as the Archbishop of Canterbury, the poet Robert Browning, and Sir Erasmus Wilson. Wilson, in particular, showed enough interest to pledge £500 to the Egypt Exploration Fund. This marked the start of the Egypt Exploration Society.

===Beginning===
The first excavator of the Egypt Exploration Fund was Édouard Naville, a Swiss Egyptologist and Biblical scholar. In January 1883, Naville set out for Tell el-Maskhuta. His goal was to find the route of the Biblical exodus as the Fund had decided to broaden its interests in order to appeal to a wider audience. Naville&#x27;s work attracted much interest from the public and at the first General Meeting of the Fund, which happened on 3 July 1883, the society was seen to have a good amount of funds in its accounts. A copy of Naville&#x27;s work was distributed to the subscribers of the Fund. Eventually the Fund decided to have the subscribers become members instead.

===Second excavation===
During the second excavation, the Fund sent Flinders Petrie, an English Egyptologist, who went to Tanis, a site linked to the Biblical city of Zoan. Petrie focussed much of his work on the ordinary dwellings of the site. This presented a new array of discoveries for the society. Petrie was among the first to understand that there was more than æsthetically appealing objects. Rather, he understood that many objects could provide information about the society of that time. He developed many techniques in which he could excavate and record the objects he found and his overall findings. At the end of his excavation, Petrie was able to bring back many valuable findings and items that he donated to the British Museum. The society became one of the first to provide scientifically excavated objects around Britain as well as overseas.

===Third excavation===
By the time of the third excavation, and the third year since the Fund was established, the society was able to send Edouard Naville, Flinders Petrie and Francis Llewellyn Griffith to Egypt. During this time and for the next few years, the Fund was able to bring back many findings, which resulted in the advancement of knowledge on ancient Egypt. Some of the sites included the fortified camp and Tell Dafana and the temple of Bastet.

==Name change==
In 1919, at the end of World War I, the Egypt Exploration Fund changed its name to the Egypt Exploration Society.

==Publishing works and base==
Today, the EES continues to publish its annual organ, the &quot;Journal of Egyptian Archaeology&quot;, which details the society&#x27;s findings, for all of its members to read. They also publish a newsletter bi-annually called &quot;Egyptian Archaeology&quot;. The Egypt Exploration Society has been based in Doughty Mews, London WC1N since 1969.

==2019 theft case==
In October 2019 officials from the Egypt Exploration Society alleged that Oxford professor, Dirk Obbink, engaged in the theft and sale of &quot;at least 11 ancient Bible fragments to the Green family, the Hobby Lobby owners who operate a Bible museum and charitable organization in Washington.&quot; The Museum of the Bible said it will return the fragments to the Egypt Exploration Society and Oxford University.

<text>Koss Corporation is a company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US that manufactures headphones. The company created the first high-fidelity stereo headphones in 1958.

== History ==

John C. Koss founded the J.C. Koss Hospital Television Rental Company in 1953. After a short time Koss was looking for new ideas, and partnered with Martin Lange to eventually develop a stereo headphone. Based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States, in 1991 Koss Audio &amp; Video Electronics started producing and selling consumer electronics products as a separate company in Hazelwood, Missouri, United States. The Koss family owns more than 75% of the firm.

Having only a high school education, John C. Koss worked with Lange, an engineer, to develop the headphone that launched the company almost by accident, as they came upon the headphone idea as a result of an attempt to market a portable phonograph. What made this product unique was the privacy switch feature, which gave listeners the opportunity to listen to the first Koss SP/3 Stereophones. Initially, the product&#x27;s purpose was to demonstrate to consumers the high-fidelity stereo sound of the portable phonograph.

Until then headphones had only been used in communications applications. In 1958 the design was introduced at a hi-fi trade show in Milwaukee, and audiences approved of it. Soon after the trade show, Koss went into business manufacturing and marketing stereophones from his basement apartment. The technology was imitated by competing manufacturers.

In the early 1970s, Koss worked out of two locations near each other. One was Koss TV-Rental, which also did electronics and musical instrument repairs; the second was the main facility two blocks to the east. At this time, Koss pioneered the high-end &quot;electro-static&quot; &quot;ES series&quot; headphone market. These headphones set the standard for wide-range frequency response. Being very durable, they required service for wear and tear on cords and earpads during their lifespan, by K&amp;M Electronics (Klenworth &amp; Midwest based in Minneapolis), working out of the TV Rental location. Koss headphones were easy and cost-effective to repair. At this site, a separate garage was set up to support the musical instrument and electronics repair business. The TV rental and repair site was managed by John&#x27;s brother Pete Koss. Eventually, Koss dominated the headphone market, competing mainly with Telex. Koss was considered a higher quality unit at the time, offering a wide line of models.

In the late 1970s, to accommodate rapid growth, Koss moved to its present location on the north side of Milwaukee.

in the 1980s, Koss tried to diversify, unsuccessfully, into related areas of electronics; in 1984 the company filed for bankruptcy protection after a net loss that year of US$6 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Koss emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 1985.

In 1991, Michael J. Koss, son of founder John C. Koss, took over as president and chief executive officer.

In December 2009, former vice president of finance Sujata &quot;Sue&quot; Sachdeva was charged in federal court with wire fraud after the firm discovered her embezzlement of US$34 million (equivalent to $ million in ), and sentenced to eleven years in federal prison, of which she served six years. Koss was forced to restate five years of financials. It was able to recoup over US$12 million from its former auditor, from Sachdeva&#x27;s credit card company, and by auctioning Sachdeva&#x27;s stolen merchandise.

In 2020, Koss sued Apple, Bose, JLAB Audio, Plantronics Inc., and Skullcandy for patent infringement. In July 2022 Koss and Apple reached a settlement for an undisclosed amount regarding the alleged patent infringement on Koss&#x27; intellectual property. 

During the 2021 GameStop short squeeze, the executives and directors of Koss earned US$40 million by selling company stock. This was more than the value of the Koss Corporation at the end of 2020.

== Products ==
Koss headphones were also sold in RadioShack stores under their own brand. The Koss Plug and Koss Spark Plug are in-ear passive noise-isolating earphones; they can be adapted to take the high-end Etymotics ear tip, becoming the &quot;Koss Hybrid&quot;. Other models include the Koss Porta Pro and well-regarded budget-priced headphones including the KSC series. Since 1989, all headphones manufactured in North America by KOSS come with a limited lifetime warranty covering normal use by the initial owner. Returning to the pre-Koss use of headphones, Koss produces communications headsets with microphone.

<text>Selling England by the Pound is the fifth studio album by the English progressive rock band Genesis, released on 28 September 1973, by Charisma Records. The album was recorded in August 1973 following the tour supporting the previous album, &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972). The group set aside a short period of time to write new material, which covered a number of themes, including the loss of English folk culture and an increased American influence, which was reflected in the title. Following the album&#x27;s release, the group set out on tour, where they drew an enthusiastic reception from fans. Several of the album tracks became fan favourites and featured as a regular part of the band&#x27;s live setlist into the 1980s.

The album was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, reaching on the UK Albums Chart, but less so in the United States, peaking at No. 70 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. A single from the album, &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;, was released in February 1974 and became the band&#x27;s first top 30 hit on the UK singles chart. Critics and the band members themselves have given mixed opinions of the album. Its reputation has improved over time, appearing on various critical and fan-voted rankings of the best progressive rock albums. The album has continued to sell and received Gold certifications from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was remastered for CD in 1994 and 2007.

== Background ==
In May 1973, the Genesis line-up of frontman and singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist and guitarist Mike Rutherford, guitarist Steve Hackett and drummer Phil Collins completed their 1972–1973 tour supporting their previous album &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972). The tour marked the band&#x27;s first full-scale North American tour, which drew positive responses, but journalists were still criticising the band and comparing them to other progressive rock bands of the time such as Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Jethro Tull, and Pink Floyd. Charisma pushed to release new Genesis material to capitalise on the band&#x27;s newfound commercial success despite the band&#x27;s wishes against it, and released a compilation of live recordings from early 1973, originally intended for broadcast on the &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot; radio show in the US, as their first live album &quot;Genesis Live&quot; (1973). This budget-priced release also compensated for the cancellation of a proposed gig at Wembley Arena in May 1973 due to the inability to print tickets in time, and to act as a bridging album in between &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and the next studio album. It became their highest charting album in the UK at the time, peaking at No 9.

The group were too busy touring to write new material, so after coming off the road they set aside time to create new songs. Due to the success of &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, the group&#x27;s record label, Charisma Records, allowed them two to three months to come up with a new studio album, which Rutherford considered to be &quot;the kiss of death&quot;. Early into the sessions Collins formed a pick-up band with former Yes guitarist Peter Banks for a few gigs, and Rutherford revealed in an interview to &quot;Sounds&quot; in 1976 that &quot;there had been worries that Phil might want to leave the group&quot;. Despite this, Gabriel recalled this time as a &quot;relatively happy and calm period&quot;.

== Writing and recording ==
Rehearsal sessions for the album took place at a doctor&#x27;s house in Chessington and the Una Billings School of Dance in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, the same two places where &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was rehearsed. Banks recalled the group had some difficulty coming up with musical ideas. The Chessington sessions took place in what reporter Jerry Gilbert described as &quot;a rambling old stately home&quot;. The group practised in the living room, causing the neighbours to complain about the noise and impose a curfew. Hackett said of the setting, &quot;Because it was a house that belonged to a family, it gave the music a sense of happy amateurishness. It made it fun because you felt you shouldn&#x27;t really be there doing that kind of thing. It was designed as a canteen or a cafeteria; there was even a machine that used to dispense bubble gum for kids!&quot; The Chessington sessions were where most of the album was written. Collins had been listening to the jazz fusion group Mahavishnu Orchestra, which influenced him to play more complicated time signatures on the drums for &quot;Dancing With the Moonlit Knight&quot; and other parts on the album.

Rehearsals then moved to London in a space beneath the Una Billings School of Dance, during which &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; was written. Hackett had not contributed a great deal of material to the group during this time, since he found it hard to write due to the breakdown of his first marriage. Rather than pitch whole songs he instead devised guitar licks, which he believed gave the album a jazz fusion feel.

A simple guitar riff that Hackett had been playing on stage that the band liked and wanted to develop further became &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;, and three bits from Banks that he intended for different songs were pressed into a single work, &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;, by the other members of the band. A riff developed early on became the opening of &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot;. The band repeatedly performed these three pieces daily for a short while which Banks thought resulted in &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot; being too overworked.

One of the ideas that Gabriel wanted to convey with the album was the idea of looking at &quot;Englishness in a different way&quot;. This included his suggestion of the album&#x27;s title, itself a slogan adopted by the Labour Party manifesto, to ensure that the British press would not accuse the band of &quot;selling out&quot; to America. Rutherford later deemed the title to be among the band&#x27;s best album titles. It represented a decay of English folk culture and an increase in Americanisation. Banks said the English theme across the album was not an intentional idea at first, but merely the way the songs naturally developed. Gabriel later said he wrote all his lyrical contributions to the album in two days.

Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album, the group entered Island Studios in London in August 1973. The engineer of &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, John Burns, became co-producer. Burns&#x27; technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment, and this motivated the group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements. Gabriel was conscious of the greater use of lengthy instrumental sections on the album which he thought presented the risk of the material becoming boring. Genesis had expanded their equipment with an Echoplex and an ARP Pro Soloist, expanding the range of sounds available to them.

== Songs ==
===Side one===
&quot;Dancing with the Moonlit Knight&quot; evolved from a number of short piano pieces composed by Gabriel, which was combined with some of Hackett&#x27;s guitar figures. The a cappella opening was influenced by Scottish plainsong. The second section and outro section consist of improvisations from the whole band, with the exception of the 12-string guitar melody played by Rutherford in the outro, which was composed. Gabriel added English-themed lyrics to counter the impression from the music press that Genesis were trying too hard to appeal to the American audience, including references to Green Shield Stamps. Banks had upgraded to a new model of Mellotron and used the choir sound on the track. The track was originally supposed to segue into &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; to make a piece around 20 minutes in length, but this idea was dropped as the result was too comparable to the 23-minute &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; on &quot;Foxtrot&quot;. The working title for the outro section was &quot;Disney&quot; in reference to prominent American animation producer The Walt Disney Company, because the members of Genesis thought it sounded like a cartoon. Rutherford thought the song&#x27;s opening provided a good start to the album, but felt less enthusiastic towards it overall, calling it &quot;a bit busy&quot;.

&quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; came out of a jam session by the group around one of Hackett&#x27;s guitar riffs. He and Collins often played it around the time &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was recorded; the other three members did not join initially because they said it sounded too much like the Beatles, but became more invested in it by the time of &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;. Banks came up with the vocal melody for the chorus, and Gabriel wrote the lyrics, which were inspired by the painting &quot;The Dream&quot; which was later adapted into the album&#x27;s cover. Gilbert described an early listening of the song as &quot;Hints of quaint English romanticism&quot; that, according to Gabriel, was initially intended to have more of a folk-oriented melody. The percussion sounds heard at the beginning are Gabriel playing with a talking drum that Burns had purchased from Nigeria. It was released as a single from the album, which became the first of the group&#x27;s to chart in the UK.

Banks wrote a piece which included what became the solo piano introduction of &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; on his own, and presented it to the group for &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, but it was rejected. He reworked some sections of the song for &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;, where it drew a more positive reception. Banks recalled the difficulty of removing the noise created by the piano pedal in the studio, so he played the passage without it, which he also found difficult. Hackett took a theme which Banks had written for flute and piano and rearranged it as a guitar solo, which dominates the latter part of the track. Banks later deemed the lyrics, which he contributed with assistance from Rutherford, as one of the worst he had worked on. He had aimed to follow &quot;the idea of a river and then I got a bit caught up in the cosmos and I don&#x27;t quite know where I ended up&quot;.

&quot;More Fool Me&quot; is the second of two songs (the first being &quot;For Absent Friends&quot; from &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;) to feature Collins on lead vocals before he became the band&#x27;s lead singer in 1975. Uncharacteristically for the group&#x27;s output at the time, the song is a tender, romantic ballad. Its music was written by Rutherford, with lyrics by both him and Collins, while sitting on the steps outside the recording studio. It is performed on the album by just the song&#x27;s two writers, Rutherford playing 12-string acoustic guitar with reverb effect applied and Collins singing, frequently in falsetto range. Gabriel considered the pair&#x27;s contributions &quot;quite a breakthrough&quot;.

===Side two===

&quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot; was inspired by a news story that Gabriel had read several years previously about the territorial battles by two rival gangs in the East End of London that would fight in Epping Forest. He placed an advertisement in &quot;The Times&quot; and looked through library archives in attempt to find more about the story, but was unable to find any further information, so he created his own fictional characters, including &quot;Liquid Len&quot;, &quot;Harold Demure&quot; and &quot;The Bethnal Green Butcher&quot;. Upon hearing a rehearsal take of the song in July 1973, reporter Chris Welch wrote: &quot;&#x27;The &#x27;Battle&#x27; has a catchy march theme with typical Genesis drum and bass lines, clean and precise&quot;. As with &quot;Get &#x27;Em Out by Friday&quot;, Genesis wrote and recorded the entire musical composition as an instrumental before starting on the lyrics, and found that the song seemed overstuffed once the vocals were added. Collins commented, &quot;... there were like 300 words a line. There was no space; it was like all the air had been sucked out of it. I&#x27;m not saying that [Peter Gabriel] was in the wrong or we were in the wrong; it&#x27;s just that if we&#x27;d known we could have thinned it out a bit. In those days we didn&#x27;t go back and re-record things.&quot; The lyrics have since been praised for their humour and wit, but the band said they did not gel well with the music and made the piece complicated for the sake of being so. Gabriel thought its ending, which had each gang settling the issue over the toss of a coin, tied up the story well but is too much of an anti-climax.

Though Genesis fans have suggested with varying degrees of seriousness that &quot;After the Ordeal&quot; was titled to reflect its placement after the interminably long and wordy &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot;, according to Hackett the title was assigned well before the band decided where to place the song on the album, and was meant to reflect its role as a simple piece which would dispel the tension from the more complex works on the album. The song originated as an electric piece written by Hackett but the band found they could not make it work. Then Banks wrote an additional part for the song which inspired them to change the entire piece to an acoustic arrangement. This was the first Genesis track on which Hackett used a nylon guitar. Rutherford wrote the section where the electric guitar enters. Despite Banks&#x27;s key role in crafting &quot;After the Ordeal&quot; into a piece most of the band were happy with, both he and Gabriel did not want to include the song on the album, while Hackett argued it should be kept; Banks expressed little interest in its &quot;pseudo classical&quot; style. It was ultimately left on after Gabriel and Banks argued about the length of &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;, which meant everything was included as a compromise. Banks later said the compromise led to the album overrunning its desirable length on vinyl, resulting in a sound quality he thought came out as &quot;pretty rough&quot;.
&quot;The Cinema Show&quot; is divided into two sections. The first section is an acoustic piece composed by Rutherford, featuring an instrumental break with vocal harmonies between Gabriel and Collins, 12-string acoustic guitars played by Rutherford and Banks, 6-string electric guitar played by Hackett, flute and oboe played by Gabriel, and drums and wood blocks played by Collins. The second is a four-and-a-half-minute instrumental section written by Banks, Collins, and Rutherford, and consists of a lead on the ARP Pro Soloist and Rutherford and Collins playing a rhythm in a time signature. Rutherford came up with the main riff, then Banks and Collins improvised on it. The final melody on the synth was written by Collins. For the first section, rather than the standard practice of tuning each pair of strings on the 12-string guitar to the same note, Rutherford had each pair tuned to harmony notes. The lyrics, written by Banks and Rutherford, draw much of their inspiration from the T. S. Eliot poem &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

The album closes with a segue from the end of &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; into &quot;Aisle of Plenty&quot;, a reprise of &quot;Dancing with the Moonlit Knight&quot; which gives the album a bookend effect. The track uses word play such as &quot;Easy, love there&#x27;s the safe way home&quot; and &quot;Thankful for her fine fare discount, Tess co-operates&quot;, referring to the British supermarkets Fine Fare, Safeway, Tesco and the Co-op.

===Additional material===
During the album&#x27;s sessions Gabriel and Hackett developed a track named &quot;Déja Vu&quot;, but it remained unfinished and left off the album. Hackett prepared a finished version of the song for his album &quot;Genesis Revisited&quot; (1996). He performed the song live on his 2019 tour which featured &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; performed in its entirety.

== Sleeve design ==
The album cover is a painting by Betty Swanwick titled &quot;The Dream&quot;. Swanwick had designed posters for London Transport between the 1930s and 1950s. The original painting did not include a lawn mower; the band had Swanwick add it later as an allusion to the track &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; because Swanwick told them she did not have enough time to paint a new picture for the cover.

== Release ==
&quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; was released on 28 September 1973, reaching No. 3 in the UK charts and No. 70 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart. The album&#x27;s success in the U.S. benefitted from a switch from Buddah Records to Atlantic. &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; was released as a single, with &quot;Twilight Alehouse&quot; on the B-side, in February 1974. It was the band&#x27;s first single to enter the UK chart, and peaked at No. 21. It was successful enough for Genesis to be invited to perform the song on the British television show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, which the band declined. In 2013, the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry for selling 100,000 copies.

The album was digitally remastered for compact disc in 1994 and again in 2007 by Rhino Records.

== Critical reception and legacy ==
Contemporary reviews for the album were mixed. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Paul Gambaccini praised the band for attempting something utterly different amidst &quot;a stagnant pop scene&quot;, but criticised the album&#x27;s lyrics, feeling they overused British pop culture references, and complained about some musical passages. Despite this, Gambaccini thought the album &quot;merits some recognition&quot;. &quot;NME&quot;″s Barbara Charone said the album was &quot;the band&#x27;s best, most adventurous album to date&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Robin Denselow wrote that &quot;much of the material is indistinctive and tedious&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot; in June 1974, Robert Christgau assessed the record as &quot;down-to-earth progressive, which means that it indulges in snooty satire about the vulgar futility of working class youth. Would T.S. Eliot be proud? I doubt it. But I have the feeling that they&#x27;re saying right out what all their co-workers in the genre are thinking, and there&#x27;s some pretty dense music here.&quot;

Retrospective reviews have been more favourable. AllMusic and BBC Music remarked that the album returned to the whimsical eccentricity of &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot; while retaining the hard rock intensity and pessimism of &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, combining the best of both elements to make Genesis&#x27;s best album up to that point. Christgau, later writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), admitted that the songs &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; and &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot; have &quot;a complexity of tone that&#x27;s pretty rare in any kind of art&quot;, though he summarised the rest of the album by saying &quot;it sounds as snooty as usual&quot;.

In 2012, the album ranked seventh in &quot;Rolling Stone″&quot;s &quot;Readers&#x27; Poll: Your Favorite Prog Rock Albums of All Time&quot;. It was also included in IGN&#x27;s list &quot;10 Classic Prog Rock Albums&quot; in 2008, which praised its &quot;subtle elegance, sublime textures, and lyrical splendor&quot;. Rock author Edward Macan had mixed feelings towards the album, praising &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; (&quot;one of the finest nine and half minutes of music that Genesis ever put down&quot;) and &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; but questioning some of the other material. Motoring journalist and broadcaster Jeremy Clarkson is a fan of the album and wrote sleeve notes for it when it was included in the box set &quot;Genesis 1970–1975&quot;.

Hackett has said the album is his favourite Genesis record, and was happy with his extensive contributions to it. In 2017, he explained, &quot;It was an important watershed album for the band, and it was at the beginning of us struggling to find gigs in the States. If we could get into a club somewhere, wherever it was, that was good news for us at that time. A young, struggling band, but with an album that was due to become a classic in time.&quot; Banks and Rutherford have had mixed feelings, saying there are a lot of high points but also some lows. Charisma owner Tony Stratton Smith was disappointed with the album, which he thought contained too many instrumental sections. Band friend and former roadie Richard Macphail thought the power of Genesis live had not been captured on record properly until Burns started to work with them and that by the time of &quot;Selling England&quot;, the group had acquired better equipment. Biographer Robin Platts wrote that &quot;There were enough magic moments and inspired jam sessions to produce such enduring compositions&quot;.

&quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; has been praised by other songwriters and musicians. Rush drummer Neil Peart has said: &quot;I think &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; is an enduring masterpiece of drumming. Beautiful drumming, lovely sound, and the arrangements, I think they really nailed the best of what that band as an entity could have done with that album.&quot; Fish, solo artist and former lead singer of Marillion, has called it &quot;the definitive Genesis album&quot;, praised its &quot;emotive&quot; quality, said the wordplay was &quot;one of the things that became quite an influence on me – the games within the lyrics&quot; and concluded it &quot;took a whole jump forward and was the album that really got me into Genesis&quot;. According to Hackett, John Lennon said he liked the album during a radio interview, which the band took great encouragement from. Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen also cites the album as a major influence. In an interview, Robert Pollard of Guided by Voices said that &quot;&quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; is one of my top 10 records of all time&quot; and that &quot;Genesis with Peter Gabriel might be my biggest influence.&quot;

== Tour ==
Genesis supported the album with a concert tour of Europe and North America from September 1973 to May 1974. Initially they were to perform with a stage set that included inflatable objects that had images projected onto them, but a change in fire regulations following the Summerland disaster in August 1973 led to the idea being scrapped. Instead, they used a new and more elaborate setup with the performers all dressed in white and white light illuminating the same, while white keyboards, drum kit, and curtains had slides projected onto them. Gabriel devised new stories before songs, and wore a full costume with a helmet and shield representing the Britannia character for &quot;Dancing With the Moonlit Knight&quot; and sang &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot; with a stocking over his head. He also added elements to &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, for the first time performing it wearing an old man mask, singing in a stereotypical grumpy old man voice, and repeatedly thrusting his hips at the audience during the ending section.

The setlist was dominated by songs from the new album, with every song except &quot;After the Ordeal&quot; and &quot;Aisle of Plenty&quot; being played. In an unusual twist, &quot;Horizons&quot; from &quot;Foxtrot&quot; was also often part of the set, despite never having been played during the &quot;Foxtrot&quot; tour. The rest of the show was usually filled out with the tried-and-true favourites &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;, &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, and &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;. This was the first major Genesis tour in which their perennial show closer &quot;The Knife&quot; was not a regular part of the set, though it was on rare occasions used as an encore.

The tour began with a sold-out tour of the UK, but the promoters had to cancel the first date at the Green&#x27;s Playhouse, Glasgow due to electrical safety issues minutes before its start, with support act Ron Geesin already having finished his set. Genesis realised they were substantially in debt and needed better management, so recruited Tony Smith (no relation to Charisma boss Tony Stratton Smith). In October 1973 a pair of dates in the tour were filmed by Charisma for a possible cinema release, but the plan was rejected by the band who felt the film was not up to standard. Instead, the band performed a five-song set in front of an invited audience at Shepperton Studios that was filmed and broadcast as &quot;Tony Stratton Smith Presents Genesis in Concert&quot;. The group returned to the U.S. in December 1973 that included six shows in three nights at The Roxy in Los Angeles, and a performance of &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; and &quot;The Musical Box&quot; on the late night television show &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. However, most of their shows in the U.S. were on the college circuit.

January 1974 saw the band perform five nights at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane which saw Gabriel lifted in the air by steel wires during &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;. They then played shows in Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland before doing a well-received tour of Italy, the country where they were then most popular, in February. Following a two-week break, Genesis spent all of March and April touring the United States and Canada, including relatively remote areas like Iowa and Minnesota. During this last leg of the tour, the white colour scheme of their stage setup was replaced with a black scheme.

<text>The First Amendment of the Constitution Act 1939 amended the Constitution of Ireland to extend the constitutional definition of &quot;time of war&quot; to include a period during which a war occurs without the state itself being a direct participant. It was introduced and signed into law on 2 September 1939, the day after the Invasion of Poland by Germany and allowed the government to exercise emergency powers during World War II (known in Ireland as The Emergency) although the state was neutral.

==Background==
Article 28.3.3° of the Constitution grants the state sweeping powers during a state of emergency, but in the form in which the article was adopted in 1937, they could be invoked only during a &quot;time of war or armed rebellion&quot;. The First Amendment specified that &quot;time of war&quot; could include an armed conflict in which the state was not actually taking part.

The amendment was introduced by the Fianna Fáil government of Éamon de Valera on 2 September 1939, and passed swiftly through both houses of the Oireachtas. Unlike later amendments, the First and Second Amendments were not submitted to a referendum because under the terms of Article 51, one of the Transitory Provisions of the Constitution, the Constitution could be amended by a vote of the Oireachtas alone from 1938 to 1941.

==Changes to the text==
Addition of the text in bold to Article 28.3.3°:
===Irish text===
The First Amendment was passed only in English. That created a constitutional difficulty, as the Irish text of the Constitution has legal precedence. The error was rectified by the Second Amendment, passed in 1941, which included in its provisions, at Reference No. 21, the Irish text of the First Amendment.

==Legislation==
The Emergency Powers Act 1939 was passed and signed on the same day as the First Amendment. Further Acts were passed over the course of World War II. The Emergency Powers Act 1976 was passed in response to The Troubles.

==Later amendments==
Article 28.3.3° was amended on two further occasions. The Second Amendment, passed in 1941, also under Article 51, clarified that emergency provisions must be within the time of war or armed rebellion itself and added a clause at the end of the last sentence, which specified that a &quot;time of war&quot; could extend beyond the termination of hostilities. The Twenty-first Amendment, passed in 2001, prohibited the use of the death penalty in a new subsection in Article 15.5.2°, and provided that the emergency provisions of the Constitution could not be used to allow the death penalty. Those later changes are highlighted in bold:

<text>The Third Amendment of the Constitution Act 1972 is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland that permitted the State to join the European Communities, which would later become the European Union, and provided that European Community law would take precedence over the constitution. It was approved by referendum on 10 May 1972, and signed into law by the President of Ireland Éamon de Valera on 8 June of the same year.

The incorporation of the law of the European Communities into Irish domestic law was put into effect by the European Communities Act 1972, which became law on the day Ireland acceded to the European Communities on 1 January 1973.

==Background==
Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands formed the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951. In 1957, the same six countries formed the European Economic Community and European Atomic Energy Community. Together, these were known as the European Communities and shared common institutions.

In 1961, Ireland applied to join the European Communities. This application was withdrawn after President of France Charles de Gaulle exercised a veto in respect of the application of the United Kingdom. A second application was made in 1967, and in 1972, the six member states signed a Treaty of Accession with Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom. As Ireland had no nuclear power programme, nor any important coal and steel industries, membership of the Communities primarily concerned the European Economic Community.

In &quot;Costa v ENEL&quot; (1964), the European Court of Justice established the primacy of European Community law. Therefore, an amendment was needed in order to avoid a conflict with the Constitution of Ireland, which had granted powers exclusively to the Oireachtas (parliament) and the Government of Ireland. It was also possible that many provisions of the Constitution might be found to be incompatible with European law.

==Changes to the text==
Addition of a new subsection to Article 29.4 of the Constitution:
==Oireachtas debate==
The Third Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1971 was introduced in the Dáil by Tánaiste Erskine H. Childers of Fianna Fáil. Among the opposition parties, it was supported by Fine Gael and opposed by the Labour Party. At the Second Stage debates, it was moved by Taoiseach Jack Lynch. The Labour Party sought to defeat the reading of the bill at second stage; a government motion to prevent this passed by 106 votes to 17, and the bill proceeded to Committee Stage. At Committee Stage, the government accepted a Fine Gael amendment to the final sentence. As initiated, this sentence had begun, &quot;No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State consequent on membership of the Communities […]&quot;; the amendment replaced the words highlighted in bold with the words &quot;necessitated by the obligations of&quot;. It passed all stages in the Dáil on 26 January 1972. It passed all stages in the Seanad on 8 March 1972.

==Views on accession==
As well as parties represented in the Oireachtas, accession was also supported by employers&#x27; and farmers&#x27; interest groups. Then President Éamon de Valera privately opposed the state&#x27;s entry and voted &#x27;no&#x27;, citing the loss of sovereignty.

Official Sinn Féin (now the Workers Party) opposed the state&#x27;s entry, citing anti-imperialism and calling the EC a &quot;rich man&#x27;s club&quot;. Provisional Sinn Féin (now Sinn Féin) also opposed the entry, saying it would undermine Irish sovereignty and that the &quot;Common Market Empire would threaten Irish ownership of Irish land&quot;.

==Result==
The Third Amendment was approved with 83.1% in favour to 16.9% against. It was the first amendment to the Constitution to be approved by Irish voters in a referendum.


==Aftermath and later developments==
The European Communities Act 1972 was signed into law on 6 December 1972. This provided a legislative basis for the primacy and direct effect of European Community law. On 1 January 1973, Ireland, Denmark and the United Kingdom became member states of the European Communities (Norway had rejected membership in a referendum).

Unlike in the United Kingdom, where membership to the European Communities was the subject of continued political debate and a post-accession referendum, in Ireland the outcome of the Third Amendment referendum immediately settled the issue of Ireland&#x27;s place in Europe amongst both the Irish people and its politicians. In the decades that followed Irish support for continued membership would in fact continue to grow.

In &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot; (1987), the Supreme Court of Ireland held that further transfer of power to the European Communities that were not in themselves necessitated by membership of the European Communities (in that instance, approval of the Single European Act) would require further amendments to the Constitution, and therefore require approval by referendum. Subsequent changes to the Treaties of the European Communities and later of the European Union have also required amendments to the Constitution, and therefore have required approval by referendum. These amendments have substantially altered the initial wording of 29.4.3° as inserted by the Third Amendment. in particular, the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland approved in 2009, allowing the ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, created a different structure to the subsections in Article 29.4.

In later years the various European organisations (with the exception of EAEC) were integrated by the ratification of subsequent treaties into the European Union.

<text>Manishtushu (Man-ištušu) (, &quot;Ma-an-ish-tu-su&quot;; died 2255 BC) was the third (or possibly second) king of the Akkadian Empire, reigning 15 years c. 2270 BC until his death c. 2255 BC. His name means &quot;Who is with him?&quot;. He was the son of Sargon the Great, the founder of the Akkadian Empire, and he was succeeded by his son, Naram-Sin who also deified him posthumously. A cylinder seal, of unknown provenance, clearly from the reign of Naram-Sin or later, refers to the deified Manishtushu i.e. &quot;(For) the divine Man-istusu: Taribu, the wife of Lugal-ezen, had (this seal) fashioned&quot;. Texts from the later Ur III period show offerings to the deified Manishtushu (spelled ᵈMa-iš-ti₂-su or ᵈMa-an-iš-ti₂-su). The same texts mention a town of ᵈMa-an-iš-ti₂-su where there was a temple of Manishtushu. This temple was known in the Sargonic period as Ma-an-iš-t[i-s]uki.

== Biography ==
Manishtushu was the third king of the Akkadian Empire according to Old Babylonian tradition though listed as the 2nd, after Sargon, in the Ur III recension of the Sumerian King List. He was the son of Sargon of Akkad, brother of Enheduanna, Rimush, and Shu-Enlil, and the father of Naram-Sin. Only one year name is known. An unprovenanced tablet at the Iraq Museum from the Umma region on epigraphic grounds reads &quot;In the year that Dūr-Maništusu was established&quot;. From this it is also known that a &quot;fortress of Manishtusu&quot; was built though the location is unknown.
He became king c. 2270 BC after the death of his brother Rimush. Manishtushu, freed of the rebellions of his brother&#x27;s reign, led campaigns to distant lands. According to a passage from one of his inscriptions, he led a fleet down the Persian Gulf where 32 kings allied to fight him. Manishtushu was victorious and consequently looted their cities and silver mines, along with other expeditions to kingdoms along the Persian Gulf. He also sailed a fleet up the Tigris River that eventually traded with 37 other nations, conquered the city of Anshan in Elam, and rebuilt the destroyed temple of Inanna in Nineveh c. 2260 BC. In Elam and Pashime, in the coastal area of Iran, Manishtushu had governors installed for the Akkadian Empire: Eshpum was in charge of Elam, while Ilshu-rabi was in charge of Pashime.
An ellipsoidal axehead (copper or bronze) from the region of Elam (provenance is uncertain as it is in a private collection) reads &quot;(For) Maništušu, king of Kiš, Māšum, the charioteer, his servant&quot;. This form of axehead is known from other examples and from Akkadian Empire iconography. A marble mace head found at Sippar (BM 91018) reads &quot;Man-istusu, king of the world, dedicated (this mace) to the goddess Belat-Aia&quot;. An alabaster mace head found at Isin (IB 1878 - Iraqi Museum number unknown), in the shrine of Ninurta of the Gula temple, reads &quot;Man-istusu, king of the world, dedicated (this mace) to the goddess Ninisina.&quot;. Some inscriptions of the underlings of Manishtushu are known. A votive statue found at Susa reads &quot;Man-istusu, king of the world: Espum, his servant, dedicated (this statue) to the goddess Narunte.&quot; and a copper spear point found at Assur (VA 8300) read &quot;Man-istusu, king of the world: Azuzu, his servant, dedicated (this spear) to the god Be&#x27;al-SI.SL&quot;.

Around 2255 BC, Manishtushu died, possibly assassinated by members of his own court, and was succeeded by his son Naram-Sin. This supposed manner of his death is based on an Old Babylonian period extispicy omen text which reads &quot;if the heart is like the testicle(s) of a sheep, it is an omen of Manishtushu, whom his palace killed&quot;. He held the title &quot;King of Kish&quot; in some of his inscriptions.

The Manishtushu &quot;standard inscription&quot; is known from at least eight exemplars, statue fragments found at Nippur (CBS 19925), Sippar (BM 56630 and BM 56631), Susa (SB 51 and SB 15566), and Khafajah (KH II 162) as well as Old Babylonian tablet copies of Manishtushu inscriptions found at Nippur (CBS 13972 and NI 3200) and Ur (U 7725):

An inscribed door socket was found at an unexcavated mound on the Adaim river near where it meets the Tigris river, Khara&#x27;ib Ghdairife. It read &quot;Manistusu, king of Kis, builder of the temple of the goddess Ninhursaga in HA.A KI. Whoever removes this tablet, may Ninhursaga and Samas uproot his seed and destroy his progeny.&quot;

===Cruciform Monument of Manishtushu===

In the early days of ancient Near Eastern archaeology a cross shaped (from above) monument of Manishtushu (BM 91022), inscribed in twelve columns, was discovered in 1881 by Hormuzd Rassam at Sippar. The monument mainly deals with the refurbishment of the Ebabbar temple in Sippar. It was assumed to be a legitimate Old Babylonian period copy of an Old Akkadian period monument. Later research showed that it was actually an Old Babylonian forgery. More recently, scholarship has dated the forging of the cruciform monument even later, to the Neo-Babylonian period. Several Late Babylonian copies of the cruciform monument have also been found.
===Manishtushu Obelisk===
The diorite obelisk, damaged at the top and bottom, was found at the site of Susa in Elam in 1897 by Jacques de Morgan. The origin of the monument, considered a kudurru i.e. a land grant, is unknown though generally thought to be from Sippar based on locations mentioned in it and the fact that most texts carried back to Susa by the Elamites came from the Ebabbar temple of the god Shamash in Sippar. It is currently held in the Louvre Museum (SB 20). It records the purchase by Manishtushu of eight parcels of land totaling 3430 hectares. The kudurru is 144 centimeters in height (including a small plaster base added to the bottom to stabilize it). It has four inscribed sides (A-50 centimeters wide, B-45 centimeters wide, C-52 centimeters wide, and D-39 centimeters wide) which include a total of 76 columns of text with some lines at the top lost. The text is written in Akkadian language but with Sumerian orthography. This is the first written use of the talent measurement &quot;3 talents 33 minas silver (as) the price of a field&quot;.
A sample passage:
A number of locations and personal names are mentioned on the long text of the obelisk. The fields being procured are noted as being around four cities, Dur-Sin, Girtab, Marda, and Kish, with only the location of Dur-Sin unknown in modern times. All lie in the general area of Babylon, Nippur, and Kish near the ancient course of the Euphrates river. One of the personal names mentioned on the obelisk is &quot;(Son of) Ilshu-rabi, Governor of Pashime&quot;. It has been suggested that this refers to Ilshu-rabi, a vassal of Manishtushu and governor of Pashime. This is based on the discovery of a stele at Tell Abu Sheeja reading &quot;For the God Shuda, Ilsu-rabi of Pashime, the soldier, brought in this statue. May the one who erases the name (on this inscription) not find an heir; may he not acquire a name (for himself)&quot;.

===Miscellaneous fragments===

Various bits and pieces of the statues and monuments of Manishtushu have been found. They are identified by contemporary inscriptions, by added later inscriptions (mostly in the Elamite language where the name was rendered Ma-an-iš-du-uz-z) and, somewhat more controversial, on stylistic and iconographic bases. An example is the combination of fragment SB 49 (stool) and SB 50 (legs), held at the Louvre Museum, sometimes referred to as the &quot;throne of Manishtushu&quot;. It was found at Susa and carried an Elamite language inscription by ruler Shutruk-Nahhunte (c. 1184 to 1155 BC) who carried it away from Eshnunna after a raid.

Another exemplar, found at Susa and inscribed a millennium later by Shutruk-Nakhunte is the statue composed of fragments fragments SB 47 (body) + SB 9099 (hands) said by Shutruk-Nakhunte to be of Manishtushu.

<doc id="672839" wikidata="Q4515032" url="?curid=672839" title="Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1972 is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland which lowered the voting age for all national elections and referendums in the state from twenty-one to eighteen years of age. It was approved by referendum on 7 December 1972 and signed into law on 5 January 1973.

==Background==
The Fourth Amendment altered Article 16 which deals with elections to Dáil Éireann (the house of representatives of the Oireachtas). However other provisions of the constitution state that anyone entitled to vote in Dáil elections is also entitled to participate in the election of the President and in referendums, so the amendment affected these votes as well. The amendment did not, however, affect the minimum age at which one could be elected to the Dáil, and this remained at twenty-one.

It was submitted to a referendum on the same day as the Fifth Amendment, which removed from the constitution reference to the &quot;special position&quot; of the Catholic Church and recognition of certain other named denominations.

==Changes to the text==
The Amendment altered the text of Article 16.1.2° in the following manner:

Deletion from Article (removed text in bold):
Addition to Article 16.1.2 (added text in bold):
==Oireachtas debate==
On 16 February 1972, Brendan Corish, leader of the Labour Party, proposed a constitutional amendment as a private member&#x27;s bill to lower the voting age to 18. This was opposed by the Fianna Fáil government as it did not wish to hold such a referendum until after the referendum on the proposed Third Amendment on Accession to the European Communities (which was passed on 10 May 1972).

On 28 June 1972, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Patrick Hillery moved the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1972 on behalf of the Fianna Fáil government. At second stage, it was proposed by the Minister for Local Government Bobby Molloy. It was supported by the opposition parties Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and passed final stages in the Dáil on 11 July. It passed all stages in the Seanad on 13 July, and proceeded to a referendum on 7 December 1972.

==Result==


==Implementation==
The 19th Dáil was dissolved on 5 February 1973 and a general election was held on 28 February. However, the electoral register was updated only every 15 April, so those under 21 were unable to vote despite the amendment. A 20-year-old student, represented by Seán MacBride, asked the High Court to postpone the election to vindicate his right to vote. He lost his case, although he was awarded his costs due to its &quot;public importance&quot;.

Although the names of under-21s had already been added to the provisional register, it was the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1973 passed on 9 April which reduced the age limits in statute law in line with the amended constitution. The first under-21s to vote were a few graduates of the National University and Dublin University elections to the 13th Seanad.

The later Ninth Amendment passed in 1984 altered the text of Article 16.1.2° in a manner which would permit legislation to include certain people who are not citizens to be added to the register for elections to Dáil Éireann. However, the franchise for presidential elections and referendums remained restricted to Irish citizens.

<text>The Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA; ) was established in 1994, responsible for the conservation, protection, and regulation of all antiquities and archaeological excavations in Egypt. From 1994 to 2011, the SCA was a department of the Egyptian Ministry of Culture. In 2011, the Supreme Council of Antiquities became part of the independent department of the Ministry of State for Antiquites (MSA). In 2022, the department was folded into the Ministry of Antiquities and Tourism.

Although the name of the organization has changed over the years, the purpose and function of it has remained consistent.

The first government body responsible for the preservation and protection of Egypt&#x27;s rich historical landscape was the Department of Antiquities, established in 1858. This became the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation in 1971.
==Role==
As part of the Minister of Culture, The SCA is directed through the Administrative Council by the Secretary-General. The SCA was the only agent permitted to restore or preserve Egyptian monuments. It defined the boundaries around archaeological sites and required foreign archaeologists working in Egypt to report all discoveries and finds to the SCA before publication. This somewhat controversial rule led to the expulsion of some archaeologists from Egypt, but reduced the theft of archaeological finds dramatically and notified the authorities to set up security around new finds.

The SCA was also responsible for the recovery of antiquities previously stolen or illegally exported from Egypt: between 2002 and 2008, it retrieved 3,000 artefacts. It became embroiled in a dispute with the Egyptian Museum of Berlin over the bust of Nefertiti, which it claimed was removed from the country by deceit; previously it had asked for the return of the Rosetta Stone from the British Museum and the Dendara Zodiac from the Louvre.
== Antiquities service ==

The SCA consists of a team of experts whose aim is to protect Egypt and its history. The goals of the organization include conservation, preservation, excavations, and research of Egypt, its history, monuments, artifacts, and its peoples. In addition to these goals, the organization also was used to help promote tourism and to bring attention to the fight to have artifacts returned to Egypt. In the 21st century they also face the difficult task of keeping monuments safe from those who wish to destroy the Pharanoic monuments. The position may entail also, as was done by Zahi Hawass for many years, to stimulate tourism to Egypt, with charm and charisma. Sayed Tawfik was an Egyptologist who served from 1989–1990, when the body was called the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. 
At the end of 2011, Dr. Mohamed Ibrahim Aly was named antiquities minister and he promised to give new life to the body, by bringing in young archeologists and restarting projects which had been put on hold.

==History==
===Department of Antiquities===

In the 1850s, Auguste Mariette made several discoveries at Saqqara, which revived interest into Ancient Egypt, their culture, and their monuments. and revived an interest in Egyptology. In response to the renewed interest, in 1858 the Department of Antiquites was established, and its first Conservator was Mariette. In 1859, the Department of Antiquities was created and was in existence for more than a century. Although Mariette was the director of the organization, he was also French, and his loyalty was to France. This created situations where Mariette made decisions that were not always in the best interest of Egypt. Nevertheless, he did provide the infrastructure that was required and his energy and determination gave the body the strong foundation of an identity and a credibility.

Mariette was followed by Gaston Maspero, whose biggest contribution was the examination of the mummy of Ramses II in 1884. This event was witnessed by the Khedive and other high officials. The mummy of this great conqueror was well preserved, revealing a giant frame and a face expressive of sovereign majesty, indomitable will, and the pride of the Egyptian king of kings. He then unbandaged the mummy of Ahmose-Nefertari, wife of King Ahmose I. of the Eighteenth Dynasty, beside which, in the same sarcophagus, had been discovered the mummy of Ramses III. The physiognomy of this monarch is more refined and intellectual than that of his warlike predecessor; nor was his frame built upon the same colossal plan. The height of the body was less, and the shoulders not so wide. In the same season Maspero also discovered an ancient Egyptian romance known as the story of Sinuhe in a tomb in Thebes. A fragment on papyrus had been preserved at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, but the whole romance was now decipherable.&quot;

&quot;Professor Maspero resigned his office of directorship on June 5, 1886, and was succeeded in the superintendency of excavations and Egyptian archaeology by M. Eugène Grébaut. In the same month Grébaut started upon the work of unbandaging the mummy of the Theban king Seqenenra Tao, of the Seventeenth Dynasty. It was under this monarch that a revolt against the Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings, had originated, in the course of which the Asiatics were expelled from Egypt. The history of this king has always been considered legendary, but from the signs of wounds present in the mummy, it is certain that he had died in battle. In the same season the mummy of Seti I. was unbandaged, and also that of an anonymous prince.&quot;

&quot;The next season the work of clearing away the sand from around the Great Sphinx was vigorously prosecuted by Grébaut. In the beginning of the year 1887, the chest, the paws, the altar, and plateau were all made visible. Flights of steps were unearthed, and finally accurate measurements were taken of the great figures. The height from the lowest of the steps was found to be one hundred feet, and the space between the paws was found to be thirty-five feet long and ten feet wide. Here there was formerly an altar; and a stele of Thutmosis IV. was discovered, recording a dream in which he was ordered to clear away the sand that even then was gathering round the site of the Sphinx.&quot;

===Egyptian Antiquities Organization===
By the 1970s, the value of Antiquities to Egypt was well-understood: both as a permanent advertisement for its tourist industry, and as an instrument of cultural prestige, imbuing a sense of pride in the post-colonial era, and maintaining morale during the numerous internal and external conflicts affecting Egypt since its independence. After more than a century of existence, the Department of Antiquities was therefore renamed in 1971.The new title sounded less bureaucratic, and suggested a dynamic agency: reflecting the value of the past to the present.

The concept appeared sound, but the value, both metaphorical and literal, of the antiquities &#x27;industry&#x27; to Egypt indicated that, if anything, even more support and protection should be given. This led to the upgrade, firstly to a Supreme Council in 1994, then - in 2011 - to a full Ministry of State, devoted exclusively to a judicious development of the nation&#x27;s heritage.

===Sale room in the Egyptian Museum===
In January 1881, Gaston Maspero succeeded Mariette as director of the Antiquities service (&quot;Service des Antiquités d&#x27;Egypte&quot;). In August of the same year, Amelia Edwards wrote to Maspero that thefts and robberies would probably decrease if the museum offered certified objects for sale, and that travellers would prefer to buy their ‘souvenirs’ at regulated prices at the Bulaq Museum rather than from locals. The decree of 16 May 1883 stipulated that the antiquities of the Bulaq Museum, or those that might be kept there or in other museums established in the future, were the property of the Egyptian state and for this reason were &quot;inaliénables, insaisissables et imperscriptibles&quot; (inalienable, unseizable, indispensable).

Nevertheless, probably in the same year, Maspero, assisted by Emil Brugsch, began to make a selection of the less important pieces to sell before they were included in the Bulaq collection. Gradually, the director introduced the official sale of antiquities in order to increase the financial resources of the Department of Antiquities and especially of the excavations. From June 1884, the sale of various objects and mummies is duly registered in the account books. It represents an important source of income for the service. Maspero himself buys small objects from the Antiquities Service for his personal collection. Many of them are now in the Egyptian collection of the &quot;Institut d&#x27;Egyptologie Victor Loret&quot; in Lyon.

The official sale of antiquities initiated by Maspero proved to be very lucrative for the &quot;Service des Antiquités d&#x27;Egypte&quot; (Antiquities service).

For this reason, a sale room (&quot;Salle de ventes&quot;) was opened in 1892 in the palace of Ismail Pasha in Giza, which became the seat of the Egyptian Museum in the last decade of the 19th century. It was located in room 91 on the ground floor, directly accessible from the outside. When the Egyptian Museum moved to Tahrir, in the early years of the 20th century, the sale room was located in room 56 on the ground floor, accessible from the western entrance. The Egyptian state continued to operate the sale room in the Egyptian Museum until 1979, selling original ancient Egyptian artworks and other artefacts there. From a packing list as well as from other sources, such as the pages of the register of the sale room or the museums&#x27; inventories and archives, which have already been checked or reconciled, it can be deduced that the objects sold were: Reliefs, architectural elements, offering tables, coffins, complete or fragmentary statues, statue heads or torsos, headrests, capitals (mostly Coptic), canopic jars, as well as stone or glass vessels, ushabtis, weights, amulets and scarabs. Despite the opinion that the objects sold to public institutions were more important than those sold to private collectors or dealers, we can see from the register of the sale room that the latter were also able to acquire very important objects. All of these works could subsequently be legally exported. Many objects that are now kept in private collections or public museums originated here.

<doc id="672848" wikidata="Q5447458" url="?curid=672848" title="Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1972 is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland which deleted two subsections that recognised the special position of the Catholic Church and that recognised other named religious denominations. It was approved by referendum on 7 December 1972 and signed into law on 5 January 1973.

==Changes to the text==
The amendment renumbered Article 44.1.1° as Article 41.1 and deleted the following two subsections from Article 41.1:
==Background to the deleted provisions==

In drafting the Irish constitution in 1936 and 1937, Éamon de Valera and his advisers chose to reflect what had been a contemporary willingness by constitution drafters and lawmakers in Europe to mention and in some ways recognise religion in explicit detail. This contrasted with many 1920s constitutions, notably the Constitution of the Irish Free State of 1922, which, following the secularism of the initial period after World War I, simply prohibited any discrimination based on religion, or avoided religious issues entirely.

De Valera, his advisers (including John Charles McQuaid, the future Archbishop of Dublin), and the men who put words to de Valera&#x27;s concepts for the constitution (John Hearne and Mícheál Ó Gríobhtha) faced conflicting demands in drafting of the article on religion.

* The demand from conservative Roman Catholics that Catholicism be established as the state religion of Ireland;
* Protestants&#x27; fears of discrimination.
* Prevailing opposition to Judaism.
* The fact that most people in Ireland belonged to some religion, and that the education system and to a lesser extent the health system were denominational in structure, with Roman Catholicism, the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterian Church, the Methodist Church, the Jewish community, and others running their own schools and non-governmental agencies.

De Valera&#x27;s solution was Article 44. In contemporary terms, it marked a defeat for conservative Catholics, and Pope Pius XI explicitly withheld his approval from it:

* Catholicism was not made the state church.
* Catholicism was given an undefined &quot;special position&quot; on the basis of being the church of the majority. This was not consistent with the stance of pre-Vatican II Catholicism, which claimed the right to legal and political influence on the basis of the claimed objective truth of its teachings rather than the size of its following.
* Other religions were named and recognised on a lower level. The use of the Church of Ireland&#x27;s official name antagonised conservative Catholics, who saw Catholicism as being the proper and rightful &quot;church of Ireland&quot;.
* The Jewish community in Ireland was also given recognition. The explicit granting of a right to exist to the Jewish faith in Ireland marked a significant difference to the legal approach to Jewish rights in other European states, though contemporary Irish society was not free of antisemitism.

Though perceived in retrospect as a sectarian article, Article 44 was praised in 1937 by leaders of Irish Protestant churches (notably the Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin) and by Jewish groups. Conservative Catholics condemned it as &quot;liberal&quot;.

When the contents of Article 44 were put to Pope Pius XI by Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (then Cardinal Secretary of State, later Pope Pius XII), the pope stated in diplomatic language: &quot;We do not approve, nor do we not disapprove – we will remain silent.&quot; () It was said that the pope was privately more appreciative of the constitution, and Pius XII later praised it publicly.

During the 1950s the Catholic Integrist group Maria Duce, led by Irish Catholic priest Denis Fahey, launched a campaign to amend the Article 44 of the Constitution of Ireland.
Fahey argued that this was insufficient and that the Constitution should recognise the Catholic Church as being divinely ordained and separate from &#x27;man-made&#x27; religions. The campaign succeeded in securing a resolution of support from Westmeath County Council in 1950, but no further progress towards the goal of a constitutional amendment was made.

==Viewpoint in the 1970s==

By 1972, an article once condemned by critics as liberal and indeed by some as offensive to Catholicism, had come to be seen as out of place, dated, and potentially discriminatory to Protestants. The &quot;special position&quot; granted to the Catholic Church, albeit in an undefined manner, was a special status that was out of step with post-Vatican II Catholic thinking on the relationships between the churches. The Protestant churches, though they had declined in adherents, were more outspoken and willing to express their unhappiness than they had been in the Ireland of the 1920s and 1930s, when many were fearful that criticism of the Irish state would be seen as criticism of Irish independence and so implicitly a preference for the British regime that had ruled Ireland before 1922.

In addition, in the rapprochement between Northern Ireland and what was by then known as the Republic of Ireland, many southerners perceived the &quot;special position&quot; as a barrier to an improved north–south relationship, and even a potential source of discrimination against minorities. In addition, the explicit recognition of certain denominations was seen as unnecessary because of the provisions Article 44.2, which contains guarantees of freedom of worship and against religious discrimination.

==Oireachtas debate==
The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1972 was proposed by Fianna Fáil Taoiseach Jack Lynch. It was supported by the opposition parties Fine Gael and the Labour Party and passed final stages in the Dáil on 2 November 1972. It passed all stages in the Seanad on 3 November and proceeded to a referendum on 7 December 1972.

==Campaign==

The Catholic Church did not voice any objection to the amendment, but it was opposed by some conservative Catholics. Some leading members of the Church of Ireland and the Jewish Community said during the campaign that while they appreciated the Article&#x27;s recognition of their existence (and in the case of the Jewish Community, their right to exist, in contrast to anti-Jewish laws in other states) in 1937, it was no longer needed in the 1970s and had lost its usefulness.

The referendum on the amendment occurred on the same day as the referendum on the Fourth Amendment which lowered the voting age to eighteen.

After its approval by referendum, the amendment was made to the Constitution after it was signed into law by the President of Ireland, who was then Éamon de Valera, the man who had drafted the original article.

<text>The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution (Adoption) Act 1979 is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland ensured that certain adoption orders would not be found to be unconstitutional because they had not been made by a court. It was approved by referendum on 5 July 1979 and signed into law on 3 August 1979.

==Background==
In 1977 it came to light that for technical reasons child adoption orders made by &quot;An Bord Uchtála&quot; (the Adoption Board) might be found to be unconstitutional because they were not made by a court or judge. An amendment was therefore required to put the validity of these orders beyond question.

==Changes to the text==
The amendment renumbered Article 37 as Article 37.1 and inserted the following section as Article 37.2:
==Oireachtas debate==
The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution (Adoption) Bill 1978 was introduced by Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice Gerry Collins on 13 December 1978. It was supported by opposition parties Fine Gael and the Labour Party and it passed final stages in the Dáil on 28 February 1979. In the Seanad, Labour senators Justin Keating and Mary Robinson and Fine Gael senator Alexis FitzGerald proposed an amendment to include the words &quot;notwithstanding the status of such person&quot;, which would allow for the adoption of a child of a marital family. This was not approved, and the Bill passed the Seanad without amendment on 5 April 1979. It was put to a referendum on 5 July, on the same day as the similarly uncontroversial Seventh Amendment which dealt with university constituencies for the election of the Seanad.

==Result==
The Sixth Amendment was approved almost unanimously with 601,694 (99.0%) votes in favour and 6,265 (1.0%) against. This is the highest support there has been in any referendum for a proposal to amend the Constitution.

Note: For this referendum and the Seventh Amendment held on the same day, the constituencies used were each county and county borough (city), which were deemed under section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act 1979 to be constituencies for the purpose of the poll. Usually in Irish referendums the general election constituencies are used.

==Later developments==
The Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which took effect in 2015, added a new Article 42A on Children. It included a section which allowed for the adoption of any child, allowing for the first time the adoption of children of a marital family, as had been proposed in the amendment rejected in the Seanad in 1979. The new Article 42A.3 provided,

<text>The Seventh Amendment of the Constitution (Election of Members of Seanad Éireann by Institutions of Higher Education) Act 1979 is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland that provides that the procedure for the election of six members of the Senate in the university constituencies could be altered by law. It was approved by referendum on 5 July 1979 and signed into law on 3 August of the same year.

The first statutory change under the terms of the amendment was the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Act 2024, which replaced the three-seat National University of Ireland and Dublin University constituencies with a six-seat Higher Education constituency.

==Background==
In the new Seanad created by the Constitution adopted in 1937, six seats were elected by universities: three by the National University and three by Dublin University (or Trinity College Dublin). The government in 1979 proposed splitting up the National University of Ireland (NUI) and creating separate universities in Cork, Dublin, and Galway. It was concerned that the outline of seats in the Constitution could act as a bar to this proposal, or that the new proposed universities would lose any representation. The constitutional amendment allowed a redistribution of the six university seats between these universities and any other institutions of higher education in the State. It also ensured that the section could not be invoked to prohibit the dissolution of either of the named universities.

==Changes to the text==
*Alterations to Article 18.4 (new text is in bold):
==Oireachtas debate==
The Seventh amendment was introduced by Minister for Education John Wilson for the Fianna Fáil government.
He described the purpose of the bill as:
It was not opposed by the opposition parties Fine Gael and the Labour Party and the Bill passed final stages in the Dáil on 23 May. It passed all stages in the Seanad on 31 May and proceeded to a referendum on 5 July.

==Result==
The referendum was held on the same day as the Sixth Amendment, which dealt with the validity of certain child adoption orders, and was approved on a low turnout by 552,600 (92.4%) votes in favour to 45,484 (7.6%) against.

Note: For this referendum and the Sixth Amendment held on the same day, the constituencies used were each county and county borough (city), which were deemed under section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act 1979 to be constituencies for the purpose of the poll. Usually in Irish referendums the Dáil Éireann general election constituencies are used.

==Consequential changes==

Until 2024, no change was made to the distribution or electorate of the six university seats. The NUI was not disbanded, although the Universities Act 1997 upgraded its &quot;constituent colleges&quot; to &quot;constituent universities&quot;. Other institutes of higher education have increased in number and status, with the NIHEs and DIT of 1979 gaining university status in 1989 and 2019 respectively; graduation from none of them confers a vote in Seanad elections.

The Fine Gael–Labour government returned after the 2011 election proposed to abolish the Seanad in its entirety. After the proposal was rejected by referendum in 2013, the government agreed instead to consider reforming the Seanad. In February 2014, it published a draft Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill, which would create a single six-seat constituency in which anyone with a degree-level qualification from a recognised institution would be eligible to vote. In 2015, the Working Group on Seanad Reform appointed by the government issued its report (the &quot;Manning report&quot;), which endorsed the 2014 bill but also recommended that 30 of the 43 Vocational panel senators should be directly elected, and that university graduate voters would have to choose between voting in the university constituency or one of the five panel constituencies.

The Fine Gael-led government returned after the 2016 election made implementing the 2015 report a priority. Simon Coveney, answering a Dáil question in July 2016 as Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, said implementation of the 1979 amendment would be &quot;further considered in the context of [the 2015 report] … and having regard to the work of the last government on [the 2014 draft bill]. In February 2018, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar proposed to establish an Oireachtas special committee to meet for eight months and &quot;develop specific proposals to legislate&quot; implementation of the 2015 report; he added, &quot;The university panels should be retained as recommended. They have served us well, although they should be reformed to implement the result of the 1979 referendum and open up the franchise to graduates of all higher level institutions of education.&quot;

In 2018, Varadkar established an all-party committee - the Seanad Reform Implementation Group - to examine the 2015 Manning report and make recommendations on implementation of the report. The committee was chaired by former Minister for Justice, Attorney General and Tánaiste Michael McDowell, and reported to the Taoiseach in December 2018. It recommended that 34 senators should be directly elected by the people, 15 senators elected by TDs, senators and members of local authorities, and six elected by graduates of institutions of higher education across the state. The report also carried a proposed bill to implement the recommendations.

In the 2020 general election, the manifestos of Sinn Féin and the Green Party promised to implement the Manning report and the report of the Seanad Reform Implementation Group. Seanad electoral reform was excluded from the resulting Fianna Fáil–Fine Gael–Green coalition&#x27;s programme for government and the government gave no commitment to reform the Seanad electoral process. Fianna Fáil senators introduced a private member&#x27;s bill, the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill 2020, which would create a single university constituency encompassing &quot;All Universities in the State, and Institutions of Higher Education in the State as provided for by the Minister&quot;, with the franchise extended to holders of degrees or diplomas accredited by Quality and Qualifications Ireland. The second stage debate was adjourned in November 2020 at the request of Malcolm Noonan, the Minister of State for electoral reform, who suggested that gaps in the bill&#x27;s provisions could best be filled in by waiting for the Electoral Commission due by the end of 2021. Attempts by the Civil Engagement Group to include Seanad reform in the Electoral Commission legislation failed and the Fianna Fáil bill came to third stage debate on 5 July 2023. A number of independent senators also introduced a bill in 2020 to expand the Seanad franchise - it was identical to the proposed legislation included in the report of the Seanad Reform Implementation Group.

On 31 March 2023, the Supreme Court ruled in Heneghan v Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government that the Seventh Amendment provided for the mandatory expansion of the franchise rather than a discretionary government power to extend the franchise. The court suspended its decision to 31 July 2023. At a further hearing in June 2023 the Attorney General argued for a further four-year suspension by the Court. On 26 July 2023, the Supreme Court agreed to suspend the effect of its decision, but for a period of two years only, until 26 May 2025.
The case had been dismissed by the High Court in November 2021, however the applicant, Tomás Heneghan, appealed that decision directly to the Supreme Court.

During a debate in the Seanad in September 2023, Varadkar said &quot;I always felt that there would not be consensus on reform and that that was going to be one of the difficulties...There is a case for indirect election of a second Chamber, if we are going to have one. If we have a directly-elected Chamber, there is a case for indirect election to a second Chamber. I would not like to say to our councillors that they will no longer get to elect any Senators. That is what was proposed.&quot; Varadkar was interrupted during his statement by McDowell confirming removal of the vote from councillors was not proposed.

The government published a General Scheme for the Seanad Electoral (University Members) (Amendment) Bill for consultation in May 2024. The bill was enacted later in 2024, with the six- seat Higher Education constituency coming into being the following year. The 2025 Seanad election was thus the last to use the two old university constituencies.

<doc id="672878" wikidata="Q5896680" url="?curid=672878" title="Honolulu Harbor">
<text>Honolulu Harbor, also called Kulolia and Ke Awa O Kou and the Port of Honolulu, is the principal seaport of Honolulu and the State of Hawaii in the United States. From the harbor, the City &amp; County of Honolulu was developed and urbanized, in an outward fashion, over the course of the modern history of the island of Oahu. It includes Matson, Inc. harbors on Sand Island.

==History==
Archaeological surveys show that the area around Honolulu Harbor was bustling with human activity prior to 1100. The first European vessel to enter Honolulu Harbor was a long-boat from the British merchant ship &quot;King George&quot;. The boat rowed into the harbor on December 12, 1786, commanded by a Mr. Hayward and piloted by Towanooha, servant of a friendly Hawaiian priest. In 1794, &quot;Butterworth&quot;, a British ship commanded by Captain William Brown, entered the harbor by &quot;warping&quot; in. The crew dubbed it &quot;Brown&#x27;s Harbor&quot; to their captain&#x27;s dismay. Captain Brown insisted that the harbor be called &quot;Fair Haven&quot;, which is synonymous with the Hawaiian name &quot;Honolulu&quot;.
In 1850, Kamehameha III declared Honolulu to be the official capital of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi. With the proclamation came a series of investments to further develop the harbor to accommodate more vessels. Honolulu Harbor quickly became the chief port of call for the trans-Pacific sandalwood, fur and whaling industries. Foreign vessels that docked at Honolulu Harbor poured vast amounts of wealth into the kingdom&#x27;s coffers and provided for the well-being of native Hawaiians. The British subsequently built a fort to protect the entrance to the harbor.

In 1997, the largest and most crucial of Oahu’s and the State’s commercial harbors was Honolulu Harbor.  Honolulu has become a historical Hawaiian town and transformed into the state’s capital city mainly due to its status as the world-famous port.  The city title was taken from the harbor, which serves as the center of the state’s corporate and commercial operations as well as the major tourist attraction for the island’s 884,000 citizens. 

The harbor was dredged to allow the easy passage of trans-Pacific deepwater sailing vessels. The sediment was dumped in tidelands and marshes, forming new land. As the downtown waterfront was developed and the many high-rises along the waterfront were constructed, early artifacts such as poi pounders, fishing lures and even human remains were unearthed along the current waterfront and along the docks near the Aloha Tower adjacent to Alakea Street and Nimitz Highway.

==Statistics==
Honolulu Harbor is administered by the Hawaii Department of Transportation Harbors Division. Honolulu Harbor handles over 11 million tons of cargo annually. The services that the harbor provides are crucial as Hawaii imports over eighty percent of its required goods.

== Modernization Plans ==
Costs of completed projects 

* $13 million Honolulu Piers 12 &amp; 15 
* $20 million Honolulu Pier 35 (UH SOEST)
* $1 million Honolulu Pier 39 Shed

Costs &amp; ongoing projects 

* $6 million improvements to the Honolulu Piers 24-28 utilities 

Overall spending for staff

* $7 million, or 5% of total costs

* University of Hawaii, School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology from Snug Harbor to Pier 35 
* Pacific Shipyards International and Atlantis from Pier 41 to Pier 24

==Aloha Tower==

On September 11, 1926, after five years of construction, the Aloha Tower was officially dedicated at Pier 9 of Honolulu Harbor. The tallest building in Hawaii at that time, the Aloha Tower became a guiding beacon for vessels. Just as the Statue of Liberty greeted thousands of immigrants each year to New York City, the Aloha Tower greeted thousands of immigrants to Honolulu. By the time the Aloha Tower was dedicated, Honolulu was already a popular vacation destination for wealthy American and European families. They traveled on Matson steamers that docked at the Aloha Tower and were greeted by Hawaiian music, hula performers and leis.

==Recent developments==
=== Aloha Tower ===
In 1982, the Hawaii Maritime Center was opened near the Aloha Tower in an old royal pier to present the history of Honolulu Harbor and the relative industries it served. &quot;Falls of Clyde&quot;, a historic merchant ship, is docked at the royal pier. In 2002, the Hawaii Maritime Center became an incorporated institution of the Bishop Museum. The Center closed in 2009. In 1994, the Aloha Tower Marketplace opened.

=== Future Skyline Rail ===

The Honolulu Harbor will be served by five Skyline stations: (Kalihi), (Kapalama), (Iwilei), (Chinatown), and (Downtown) once it opens its city center phase in 2031.

<doc id="672879" wikidata="Q7868719" url="?curid=672879" title="USS Dale (1839)">
<text>USS &quot;Dale (later Oriole&quot;) was a sloop-of-war in the United States Navy commissioned on 11 December 1839. &quot;Dale&quot; was involved in the Mexican–American War, the American Civil War, operations along Africa to suppress slave trade, and was used by the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service and later the U.S. Coast Guard, among other activities. &quot;Dale&quot; was placed into ordinary (naval reserve) numerous times.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Dale&quot; was one of six warships authorized to be constructed by The Congressional Act of 3 April 1837. The first of this group was &quot;Princeton&quot;, the Navy&#x27;s first screw steamer. The other five became the third-class sloops &quot;Dale&quot;, , , , and and were built to the design of John Lenthall. &quot;Dale&quot; was the only one of the five built at the Philadelphia Naval Yard and was fastest of the five. She was built under the supervision of Charles Stewart, Commandant, of the navy yard at the time

&quot;Dale&quot; was launched on 8 November 1839, commissioned on 11 December 1839 with Commander John Gwinn in command and was taken to Norfolk Navy Yard to be readied for sea. She was named in memorial of Richard Dale (6 November 1756 – 26 February 1826) who was a prisoner of war three times during the American Revolutionary War, an officer upon the founding of the United States Navy and commodore of the Tripoli blockade during the First Barbary War in North Africa. &quot;Dale&quot; was the first of five ships named for Richard Dale.

==First and second cruise==
&quot;Dale&quot;″s first cruise, which she sailed from Norfolk on 13 December 1840, took her around Cape Horn to the Pacific Station. Based at Valparaíso, Chile, she patrolled the eastern waters of the Pacific Ocean to protect American commerce and the whaling industry. During the late summer of 1842 &quot;Dale&quot; Commanded by Dornin was part of the Pacific fleet under Commodore Thomas Jones. Commodore Jones, while stationed with his fleet in Callao, Peru understood, incorrectly, from local news papers that war had broken out between Mexico and the United States, prompting Commodore Jones to capture the Mexican town of Monterey, California. &quot;Dale&quot; was not present for the capture of Monterey as Dornin had been directed by Thomas to Panama with a dispatch to Washington, D.C., stating his intention to capture Mexican towns along the Pacific coast. Shortly after capturing Monterey Thomas realized that a state of war did not exist and regressed from Monterey.

Upon &quot;Dale&quot;″s return to the east coast in October 1843, she went into ordinary at New York City until early in 1846, when she was refitted for a second cruise in the Pacific. Sailing from New York on 6 June 1846, &quot;Dale&quot; arrived at Valparaiso on 8 September, and cruised the coast of South America.

==Mexican–American War==

With the outbreak of the Mexican–American War &quot;Dale&quot;, under Commander Thomas O. Selfridge, was ordered north. The sloop arrived off Monterey, California, in January 1847, and through the remaining year of the war, cruised the coasts of Mexico and California. Not only did she capture several Mexican privateers and merchantmen, but landing parties she sent ashore raised the U.S. flag over the towns of Guaymas on the main land and Mulege on the Baja California Peninsula.

&quot;Dale&quot; arrived in San José del Cabo on 19 September 1847 with . &quot;Dale&quot; was assigned the duty of preventing traffic between Guaymas and Mulege. On 27 September &quot;Dale&quot; stopped at Loreto while heading north and it was learned that approximately 200 men had been landed at Mulege from Guaymas. On 30 September she arrived in the port of Mulege under a flag of truce. The party led by Lt. Tunis A.M. Craven asking the local government to pledge support for the United States as the United States considered the area to be part of the United States. The Mexican Privateer &quot;Magdelina&quot; was confiscated from the port. On 2 October after the refusal by local leaders, fifty sailors plus marines were landed at Mulege, but they were faced by artillery and significant opposition. Using the excuse of encroaching nightfall at a later date to justify their sudden departure, in truth the Battle of Mulege was a substantial victory for the Mexican forces, hence the current official appellation for the town, i.e., &quot;Heroica Mulege&quot;.

Another account of the Battle of Mulege provides a different perspective. USS &quot;Dale&quot; commanded by Selfridge on way to Guaymas learned of enemy forces in Mulege with an estimated force of 150 men. Four boats from &quot;Dale&quot; commanded by Lt. Craven, under the protective cover of &quot;Dale&quot; commandeered a Mexican schooner without resistance. The following day, 1 October 1847, Lt. Craven with 50 sailors plus marines landed. Under barrage of round shell and shot from &quot;Dale&quot; the Mexican forces abandoned the village and were pursued up the valley by Lt. Craven&#x27;s forces. Craven&#x27;s forces scoured the valley for a distance of about three miles coming under occasional light assault from ambush. Craven, fearing the possibility than his men were being led into an ambush, returned with his men to &quot;Dale&quot;. Lt. Craven when patrolling later off Mulege on the &quot;Liberta&quot; gathered intelligence that actually only 100 fighters were in the Mulege area on 2 Oct.

&quot;Dale&quot; arrived in Guaymas on 8 November 1847 relieving from guarding the port. Commander Selfridge, under cover fire from &quot;Dale&quot;, captured the town of Guaymas. The only American injury was a serious musket shot in Commander Selfridge&#x27;s foot. &quot;Dale&quot; remained off Guaymas until 23 December when she was relieved by . Following the ending of the war in February 1848, &quot;Dale&quot; continued to patrol until the summer of 1849, when she sailed for the east coast, arriving at New York on 22 August 1849. &quot;Dale&quot; was placed in ordinary at New York from August 1849 – August 1850.

==African anti-slavery==
&quot;Dale&quot; made three extended cruises along the African coast as part of the Africa Squadron and Atlantic Anti-Slavery Operations of the United States to suppress the slave trade. In August 1850 she was recommissioned and left for the Cape Verde Islands to relieve the USS &quot;Yorktown&quot;. On 8 October 1850, upon arriving in the Cape Verde Islands, &quot;Dale&quot; picked up the survivors of the &quot;Yorktown&quot; on Maio Island. The &quot;Yorktown&quot; sunk, without loss of life, on an unmarked reef one mile north of Maio Island 33 days previous. The &quot;Yorktown&quot;″s crew were transported by &quot;Dale&quot; to Porto Praya where the USS &quot;John Adams&quot; transported them back to the United States. Near the end of this tour &quot;Dale&quot; bombarded the small Kingdom of Johanna, in August 1851. While part of the African Squadron in 1851 she sailed and 252 days averaging per day. &quot;Dale&quot; reportedly captured the slave ship &quot;W.G. Lewis&quot; 6 November 1857 off the coast of Kongo. &quot;Dale&quot; went out of commission in May 1859

==American Civil War==

&quot;Dale&quot; was recommissioned on 30 June 1861 at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, Kittery, Maine, and sailed to join the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, capturing two schooners on her passage to Port Royal, South Carolina. Here she served as store and guard ship until sailing north for repairs on 30 September 1862. After repairs &quot;Dale&quot; arrived at Key West on 10 December for duty as ordnance store ship until 3 July 1865.

==End of career in the Navy==

&quot;Dale&quot; was decommissioned again at Philadelphia on 20 July 1865, and was in ordinary at Norfolk until recommissioned on 29 May 1867. While at Norfolk on 22 January 1886, Landsman Joseph H. Davis rescued a fellow sailor from drowning, for which he was awarded the Medal of Honor. &quot;Dale&quot; was recommissioned to serve as a training ship at the United States Naval Academy Annapolis, MD, until 1884. After leaving Annapolis &quot;Dale&quot; served as a receiving ship at Washington Navy Yard until 1894.

==Other service==
Dale was transferred to the Maryland Naval Militia in 1895, and renamed &quot;Oriole&quot; on 30 November 1904. &quot;Dale&quot; was struck from the Navy List 27 February 1906 and on 23 July 1906 she was transferred to the United States Revenue Cutter Service at Baltimore, Maryland. She, along with the &quot;Salmon P. Chase&quot;, served as a dormitory-barracks ship for the cadets in the School of Instruction at Arundel Cove, Maryland. Due to open seams in the hull, &quot;Oriole&quot; required almost constant operation of her bilge pump, or she would sink at the dock. Finally, on 17 September 1921, almost 82 years since her launch, &quot;Oriole&quot; was returned to the U.S. Navy and sold as a hulk to Mr. William Mattson of Baltimore.

<doc id="672883" wikidata="Q4126745" url="?curid=672883" title="Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1983 was an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland which inserted a subsection recognising &quot;the equal right to life of the pregnant woman and the unborn&quot;. Abortion had been subject to criminal penalty in Ireland since at least 1861; the amendment ensured that legislation or judicial interpretation would be restricted to allowing abortion in circumstances where the life of a pregnant woman was at risk. It was approved by referendum on 7 September 1983 and signed into law on 7 October 1983. In 2018, it was repealed by referendum.

The amendment was adopted during the Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government led by Garret FitzGerald, but was drafted and first suggested by the previous Fianna Fáil government of Charles Haughey. The amendment was supported by Fianna Fáil and some of Fine Gael, and was opposed by the political left. Most of those opposed to the amendment insisted that they were not in favour of legalising abortion. The Catholic hierarchy and many lay Catholics supported the amendment, but it was opposed by the authorities of other mainstream churches. After a bitter referendum campaign, the amendment was passed by 67% voting in favour to 33% voting against.

In 2018, a referendum was passed, known as the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, which repealed the Eighth Amendment.

==Changes to the text==
The Amendment inserted a new sub-section after section 3 of Article 40. The resulting Article 40.3.3° read:
==Background==
As per sections 58 and 59 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, abortion was already illegal in Ireland. However, anti-abortion campaigners feared the possibility of a judicial ruling in favour of allowing abortion. In &quot;McGee v. Attorney General&quot; (1973), the Supreme Court of Ireland had ruled against provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 prohibiting the sale and importation of contraception on the grounds that the reference in Article 41 to the &quot;imprescriptable rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&quot; of the family conferred upon spouses a broad right to privacy in marital affairs.

The Pro-Life Amendment Campaign (PLAC) was founded in 1981 to campaign against a ruling in Ireland similar to Roe v. Wade. Prior to the 1981 general election, PLAC lobbied the major Irish political parties – Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party – to urge the introduction of a Bill to allow the amendment to the constitution to prevent the Irish Supreme Court so interpreting the constitution as giving a right to abortion. The leaders of the three parties – respectively Charles Haughey, Garret FitzGerald and Frank Cluskey – agreed although there was little consultation with any of their parties&#x27; ordinary members. All three parties were in government over the following eighteen months, but it was only in late 1982, just before the collapse of a Fianna Fáil minority government, that a proposed wording for the amendment was produced.

==Oireachtas debate==
The Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1982 was introduced on 2 November 1982 by Minister for Health Michael Woods. The bill introduced by the Fianna Fáil minority government proposed to add Article 40.3.3° to the Constitution, with the wording shown above.

On 4 November, the Fianna Fáil government led by Charles Haughey as Taoiseach lost a motion of confidence in the Dáil, leading to the November 1982 general election. After the election, a coalition government of Fine Gael and the Labour Party was formed, with Garret FitzGerald as Taoiseach. Minister for Health Barry Desmond declined to reintroduce the amendment; instead, it was Minister for Justice Michael Noonan who on 2 February moved to restore the Eighth Amendment to the Order Paper.

Attorney General Peter Sutherland advised that the wording as proposed was dangerously flawed. Speaking against the original wording during the Dáil debate Alan Shatter argued:
To remedy the perceived weaknesses in the original wording of the amendment bill, the government proposed an amendment to the bill during the committee stage with the following alternative wording:
This alternative wording was criticised by the opposition for not being &quot;pro-life&quot;. Speaking against the alternative wording Michael Woods said:
A number of backbench Fine Gael TDs supported the Fianna Fáil wording, and voted against the government amendment, which was defeated by 87 to 65. The majority of Fine Gael TDs then abstained in subsequent votes. The original wording proposed by Fianna Fáil was then approved by 85 votes to 11 votes in the Dáil, and by 14 votes to 6 in the Seanad, and put to a referendum.

==Referendum campaign==
The referendum was supported by PLAC, Fianna Fáil, some members of Fine Gael, the Catholic hierarchy, and opposed by various groups under the umbrella name of the Anti-Amendment Campaign (AAC), including Labour senator (and future President of Ireland) Mary Robinson, feminist campaigners, and trade unions. Few in Fine Gael or Labour campaigned against the referendum, and before the vote, Garret FitzGerald declared that he would vote against it. Sinn Féin and the Workers&#x27; Party opposed the amendment, and the Irish Council of Churches (representing the main Protestant churches) campaigned against it.

Anti-Amendment campaigners warned the vague nature of the amendment, the sectarian nature of it, the possible risk to the health treatment to pregnant women, and to the possible legal consequences for contraception, which the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign denied.

The Amendment passed on 7 September 1983 endorsed by 67% of those who voted.

==Result==


==Judicial interpretation==
In a number of cases, the Supreme Court had held that this provision of the Constitution prohibited information within the state on the availability of abortion services outside of the state. In &quot;AG (SPUC) v Open Door Counselling Ltd.&quot; (1988), the courts injunction restraining two counseling agencies from assisting women to travel abroad to obtain abortions or informing them of the methods of communications with such clinics, and in &quot;SPUC v Grogan&quot; (1989), the courts granted an injunction restraining three students&#x27; unions from distributing information in relation to abortion available outside the state. These rulings were overturned by the Thirteenth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment in 1992, which explicitly gave people the right to travel abroad for an abortion, and to receive information in Ireland about abortion available abroad.

In &quot;Attorney General v X&quot; (the X Case) in early 1992, the High Court granted an injunction to the Attorney General restraining a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped from obtaining an abortion in England. On appeal, Supreme Court found that as the girl had shown a risk of suicide, to safeguard &quot;the equal right to life of the mother&quot; in Article 40.3.3°, abortion was permissible in this instance.

The Pro Life Campaign, a successor to PLAC, accused the Supreme Court of misinterpreting both the law and the will of the people. The Government and former Attorney-General Peter Sutherland dismissed such claims, arguing that, as they had claimed in 1983, the &#x27;Pro-Life Amendment&#x27; was so poorly worded and ambiguous that it could facilitate either pro-abortion rights or anti-abortion interpretations in different circumstances. The Amendment was not reinterpreted by the Supreme Court on the grounds originally voiced by Peter Sutherland that it would lead to abortion prior to viability or kill women by refusing standard treatments for ectopic pregnancies, cancerous wombs, etc. There was no medical evidence called during the X Case hearings.

In &quot;PP v. HSE&quot; (2014), the High Court held that the constitution did not require a woman who was medically brain dead to be kept on life support to keep the foetus within her alive, because the chance of the foetus being born alive were &quot;virtually non-existent&quot;. It is unclear how the case would have been decided if the pregnancy was further along.

In &quot;HSE v. B.&quot; (2016), the High Court declined to grant an order sought by the Health Service Executive permitting it to carry out a caesarean section against the will of a pregnant mother.

In an application for leave seeking judicial review of an order for deportation of a Nigerian man, Humphreys J held for the High Court in August 2016 that leave should be granted, in part on the family rights of the unborn child at the time of the deportation. The state appealed this decision. On 7 March 2018, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court and dismissed the state&#x27;s appeal in a unanimous decision that the Minister is obliged to take into account the fact of pregnancy; however, it reversed other sections of the High Court and ruled the Minister is accordingly not obliged to treat the unborn as having constitutional rights other than the rights contained in Article 40.3.3°.

==Later referendums==
Three referendums were held in November 1992. The Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992 sought to exclude &quot;a risk of self-destruction&quot; as grounds for abortion, to overturn the central element of the decision in the X Case. This was rejected by 65% to 35%. The Thirteenth Amendment, permitting travel to obtain abortion in another jurisdiction, was approved by 62% to 38%. The Fourteenth Amendment, permitting information about services in other countries, was approved by 60% to 40%.

After these amendments, which became law on 23 December 1992, Article 40.3.3° read,
A further referendum which proposed to insert legislation into the Constitution which would permit abortion where there was a threat to life but not where there was a risk of suicide, the Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2001, was narrowly defeated by 50.4% to 49.6%.

==Maastricht protocol==
The Treaty on European Union, or the Maastricht Treaty, was signed on 7 February 1992. To assuage fears that free movement of services would lead to access in Ireland to abortion services, the government secured a protocol to the Treaty protecting the constitutional provision. The Maastricht Treaty was approved in a referendum in June 1992 by 69% to 31%. Following amendments to the Treaty on European Union affected by the Lisbon Treaty in 2009, this provision now reads:
==Legislation==
The Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013 replaced the abortion offences in the Offences against the Person Act 1861 and made statutory provision for the limited right to abortion established by the X Case. It replaced the offence of &quot;unlawfully procuring a miscarriage&quot; punishable to life imprisonment with the offence of &quot;destruction of unborn human life&quot;, punishable by up to 14 years&#x27; imprisonment.

==Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment==

The Campaign to Repeal the Eighth Amendment has its roots in the unsuccessful Anti-Amendment Campaign in 1983. There was a campaign to Repeal the Eight Amendment after the X Case in 1992, and the three abortion referendums which followed it (the 12th, 13th and 14th). The campaign lay dormant for more than 20 years until the death of Savita Halappanavar in 2012. The Abortion Rights Campaign was founded in 2012. The #RepealThe8th hashtag was started on Twitter in 2012. The use of a social media to campaign to #RepealThe8th was an effective way to gain momentum leading up to the 2018 referendum. Twitter is recognised as &#x27;one of the primary tools&#x27; for social justice, and in Ireland&#x27;s case, allowed women to connect for collaborative social change despite the physical distance between them.

This campaign is led by a coalition of pro-abortion rights groups, including the Association for Improvements in Maternity Services (AIMS) Ireland, the Coalition to Repeal the Eighth, the Abortion Rights Campaign, Doctors for Choice, the Termination for Medical Reasons group, etc., and has support from a number of legal academics and members of the medical profession, including the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. In the run up to the 2016 general election, a number of parties committed to a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment (Labour, Green Party, Social Democrats, Sinn Féin and Workers&#x27; Party) as well as a group of feminist law academics published model legislation to show what a post-Eighth Amendment abortion law could look like. In June 2016, Minister for Health Simon Harris stated his support for a referendum on repealing the 8th.

On 27 July 2016, the government appointed Supreme Court judge Mary Laffoy as chair of a Citizens&#x27; Assembly to consider a number of topics, including the Eighth Amendment. The Assembly recommended a referendum to remove and replace the 8th Amendment. In September 2017, the Oireachtas Committee on the 8th Amendment began its work considering how to give effect to this recommendation.

The 5th Annual March for Choice, organised by the Abortion Rights Campaign, took place in Dublin on Saturday 24 September 2016 marking the Global Day of Action for Access to Safe and Legal Abortion. The theme of the rally was Rise and Repeal. The attendance was estimated to be around 20,000. The 2017 March for Choice attracted 40,000 marchers, according to organisers.

On Saturday 21 July 2017, the Rally for Life was organised by prominent anti-abortion groups including the Life Institute, Youth Defence, and the Northern Ireland group Precious Life, in opposition to the campaign. A march held on 10 March 2018 at Merrion Square was estimated to have had a turnout of 15,000, although organisers claim up to 100,000 attended.

On 14 June 2017, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced his government&#x27;s intention to bring forward legislation to facilitate the holding of a referendum on abortion in 2018. On 9 March 2018, debate began in the Dáil on the Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2018, which would replace the current provisions on Article 40.3.3° with the following clause:
On 25 May 2018, the Irish people voted by 66.4% to remove the Eighth Amendment, choosing to replace it with the above text as a part of the Thirty-sixth Amendment to the Constitution, permitting the Oireachtas (parliament) to legislate for the regulation of termination of pregnancy. When it was signed in to law by the President of Ireland, it superseded the 8th, 13th and 14th amendments. 39 of the 40 Constituencies voted in favour, the constituency of Donegal being the only one to vote against.

<text>Pierrefitte-sur-Seine (, ) is a former commune in the Seine-Saint-Denis department and Île-de-France region of France, since 2025 a part of Saint-Denis, following a vote of both municipal councils on 30 May 2024. It forms part of the northern suburbs of Paris, and lies from the centre of the French capital.

Collège intercommunal Lucie-Aubrac in Villetaneuse also served Pierrefitte students, as did Lycée Polyvalent Maurice-Utrillo, a senior high school/sixth-form college in Stains.

Paris 8 University and Paris 13 University served area students.

<text>The San Carlos Fortress (in Spanish: Fortaleza de San Carlos) is an 18th-century fortress in the city of Perote, in the Mexican state of Veracruz. It is also known as the Fort of San Carlos, Perote Castle, the Castle of San Carlos, Perote Prison, San Carlos de Perote Fortress, and San Carlos de Perote Castle.

The fortress was built from 1770 to 1776 by Manuel de Santisteban as a guard post and repository for treasure prior to shipment to Spain. After the Mexican War of Independence, the remaining Spanish colonial troops were garrisoned in the neighboring castle of San Juan de Ulúa, prompting General Guadalupe Victoria to create, on 11 October 1823, the first military college in the new country: the Perote Military College.

Between 1841 and 1844, soldiers from the Republic of Texas, survivors of the Texan Santa Fe Expedition, the Dawson Massacre, and the Mier Expedition, were imprisoned here. 300 or so members of the failed Santa Fe expedition were held in the fortress during the winter of 1841–42. Then in December 1842, about fifty men who had been captured in San Antonio by General Adrián Woll, including fifteen from Dawson&#x27;s company, were confined. The following year, approximately 160 survivors of the 1842–43 Mier Expedition, an offshoot of the Somervell Expedition, after being used through the summer as laborers to work on roads near Mexico City, were taken to the Perote Prison in September 1843. The last of all these Texan prisoners, numbering by then about 105, were not released until a year later, in September 1844. Many had died from wounds, disease, or starvation; and several prisoners had managed to escape, or were released earlier in response to U.S. diplomatic efforts.) 

In March 1843, Guadalupe Victoria, who had served as Mexico&#x27;s first President in the 1820s, died in the San Carlos Fortress complex. He suffered from epilepsy and was receiving medical treatment in Perote.

During the Mexican–American War of 1846–48, American forces captured the fortress on April 22, 1847. They garrisoned it as a post to protect their line of communications between Veracruz and Mexico City from guerrillas. 

At the very end of the Second World War, after Mexico declared war against the Axis alliance, the facility served as a prison for German and Italian citizens.

Then the fortress became a state prison, from 1949 to March 2007, after which it was opened to the public.

<doc id="672904" wikidata="Q3147018" url="?curid=672904" title="Ninth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1984 (previously bill no. 11 of 1984) is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland that allowed for the extension of the right to vote in elections to Dáil Éireann (the house of representatives of the Oireachtas) to non-Irish citizens. It was approved by referendum on 14 June 1984, the same day as the European Parliament election, and signed into law on 2 August of the same year.

==Background==
Article 16 of the Constitution of Ireland as approved in 1937, and amended in 1972 to lower the voting age, provided that the franchise for elections to Dáil Éireann would be citizens who have reached the age of 18. The Electoral Amendment Bill 1983, proposed by the Fine Gael–Labour Party government led by Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald, would have amended the Electoral Act 1963 to allow British citizens as defined by the British Nationality Act 1981 to vote in elections to Dáil Éireann. This was to reciprocate the Representation of the People Act 1949, a British statute, which among other provisions had granted Irish citizens resident in the United Kingdom the right to vote in elections to the British parliament.

The Bill was referred by President Patrick Hillery to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution. In a judgment delivered on 8 February 1984, they found the bill to be unconstitutional.

In response, the government then proposed a constitutional amendment which would specifically allow the franchise in elections to Dáil Éireann to be extended to non-Irish citizens. This did not affect presidential elections or referendums, where the text of the Constitution continued to specify citizens only.

==Changes to the text==
Deletion of the entirety of Article 16.1.2°:
Substitution of new Article 16.1.2°:
Amendment to Article 16.1.3° by the addition of the text in bold:
==Oireachtas debates==
The Ninth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1984 was proposed by Minister for the Environment Liam Kavanagh on 11 April 1984. It had the support of opposition party Fianna Fáil and passed all stages of the Dáil without amendment on that day. It passed all stages of the Seanad on the same day.

==Information to voters==
Under the provisions of the Referendum Act 1984, the changes was described on the polling card sent to voters as:
==Result==

Note: For this referendum, the constituencies used were each county and county borough (city), which were deemed under section 2 of the Referendum (Amendment) Act 1984 to be constituencies for the purpose of the poll. Usually in Irish referendums the Dáil Éireann general election constituencies are used.

==Aftermath==
The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1985 was passed the following year. This amended the Electoral Act 1963 to grant the vote to British citizens. It also allowed the Minister for the Environment to extend the franchise to citizens of a member of the European Communities on a reciprocal basis. To date, no such order has been made for any other country.

<text>William Peter Hamill (June 24, 1935August 5, 2020) was an American journalist, novelist, essayist and editor. During his career as a New York City journalist, he was described as &quot;the author of columns that sought to capture the particular flavors of New York City&#x27;s politics and sports and the particular pathos of its crime.&quot; Hamill was a columnist and editor for the &quot;New York Post&quot; and the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;.

==Early life and education==
The eldest of seven children of Catholic immigrants from Belfast, Northern Ireland, Hamill was born in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn. His father, Billy Hamill, lost a leg as the result of an injury during a semi-professional soccer game in Brooklyn. Hamill&#x27;s mother, Anne Devlin Hamill, a high school graduate, arrived in New York on the day the stock market crashed in 1929.
Billy Hamill was introduced to Anne Devlin in 1933 and they married the following year. Billy Hamill had jobs as a grocery clerk, in a war plant, and later in a factory producing lighting fixtures. Anne Hamill was employed in Wanamaker&#x27;s department store, and she also worked as a domestic, a nurses&#x27; aide, and a cashier in the RKO movie chain. Hamill&#x27;s younger brother, Denis, also became a columnist for the &quot;Daily News&quot;.

Hamill attended Holy Name of Jesus grammar school and delivered the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; when he was 11. In 1949, Hamill attended the prestigious Regis High School in Manhattan, but he left school when he was 15 to work as an apprentice sheet metal worker in the Brooklyn Navy Yard; 59 years later, in June 2010, Regis awarded him an honorary diploma. Inspired especially by the work of Milton Caniff, he was set on becoming a comic book artist. Hamill attended night classes at the School of Visual Arts (then called the Cartoonists and Illustrators School), with the goal of becoming a painter. He also took courses at Pratt Institute, which awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1980. In the fall of 1952, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Following his discharge, in 1956–57, he was a student at Mexico City College on the G.I. Bill.

==Career==
===Journalism===
In 1958, while serving as the art director for a Greek-language newspaper the &quot;Atlantis&quot;, Hamill talked his way into writing his first piece about his friend, Puerto Rican professional boxer José Torres, then a neophyte middleweight and Olympic champion. This led Hamill to pursue writing a few letters to the editor for the &quot;New York Post&quot; of which two were printed. Hamill eventually attracted enough attention and was hired as a reporter for the &quot;New York Post&quot; in 1960. The 1962–63 New York City newspaper strike led Hamill to start writing magazine articles. By the fall of 1963 he was a correspondent for &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, stationed in Europe. Hamill spent six months in Barcelona and five months in Dublin, and traveled Europe interviewing actors, movie directors, and authors, as well as ordinary citizens. In August 1964 he returned to New York, reported on the Democratic Convention in Atlantic City, and was briefly employed as a feature writer at the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. He began writing a column for the &quot;New York Post&quot; in late 1965, and, by the end of that year, was reporting from Vietnam.

For more than four decades, he worked at the &quot;New York Post&quot;, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;New York Newsday&quot;. He served briefly as editor of the &quot;Post&quot;, and later as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Daily News&quot;. His resignation from the latter position after eight months prompted a letter of protest signed by more than a hundred of the paper&#x27;s writers. Hamill&#x27;s more extensive journalistic pieces have been published in &quot;New York&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and other periodicals. He wrote about wars in Vietnam, Nicaragua, Lebanon and Northern Ireland, and reported on America&#x27;s urban riots of the 1960s.

Hamill wrote about the New York underclass and racial division, most notably in an essay for &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, &quot;Breaking the Silence&quot;. He also wrote about boxing, baseball, art, and contemporary music, winning a Grammy Award in 1975 for the liner notes to Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;. However, while at the &quot;New York Post&quot;, Hamill defamatorally wrote of the later exonerated Central Park Five that the teens hailed “from a world of crack, welfare, guns, knives, indifference and ignorance…a land with no fathers…to smash, hurt, rob, stomp, rape. The enemies were rich. The enemies were white.”

Two collections of his selected journalism have been published: &quot;Irrational Ravings&quot; and &quot;Piecework&quot; (1996). For the Library of America he edited two volumes of the journalism of A.J. Liebling. In 1998, he published an extended essay on contemporary journalism titled &quot;News is a Verb: Journalism at the End of the Twentieth Century&quot;.

===Fiction===

Hamill also wrote fiction, producing ten novels and two collections of short stories. His first novel, a thriller called &quot;A Killing for Christ&quot;, about a plot to assassinate the Pope on Easter Sunday in Rome, was published in 1968. Drawing on his youth in Brooklyn he next wrote a semi-autobiographical novel called &quot;The Gift&quot;. Most of his fiction is set in New York City, including &quot;Snow in August&quot; (1997), &quot;Forever&quot; (2003), &quot;North River&quot; (2007), and &quot;Tabloid City&quot; (2011).

His 1971 column &quot;Going Home&quot;, about a released prisoner on his way home by bus, inspired the smash 1973 hit song &quot;Tie A Yellow Ribbon Round The Ole Oak Tree&quot;.

Hamill published more than 100 short stories in newspapers, including those that were part of a series called &quot;The Eight Million&quot; in the &quot;New York Post&quot;; in the &quot;Daily News&quot;, his stories ran under the title &quot;Tales of New York&quot;. He published two volumes of short stories: &quot;The Invisible City: A New York Sketchbook&quot; (1980) and &quot;Tokyo Sketches&quot; (1992).

===Nonfiction===
Hamill&#x27;s 1994 memoir, &quot;A Drinking Life&quot;, chronicled his journey from childhood into his thirties, his embrace of drinking and the decision to abandon it. According to Hamill, Frank McCourt was inspired by the book to complete his own memoir, &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;. Hamill&#x27;s memoir &quot;Downtown: My Manhattan&quot; includes his reporting for the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; on the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, at which he was present.

Hamill&#x27;s book on the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera was inspired by time spent in Mexico City in 1957 and his presence at Rivera&#x27;s funeral. In &quot;Tools as Art&quot; (1995), Hamill surveys the Hechinger Collection and the incorporation of utilitarian objects for aesthetic ends. His biographical essay on the artist was featured in &quot;Underground Together: The Art and Life of Harvey Dinnerstein&quot; (2008), whose work, like Hamill&#x27;s, often focuses on the people and cultural life of Brooklyn.

Hamill&#x27;s interest in photography informed his later essays in nonfiction. &quot;New York: City of Islands&quot; (2007), celebrates the photography of Jake Rajs. &quot;New York Exposed: Photographs from the Daily News&quot; (2001) contains an extended essay about the New York Daily News and its role in American photojournalism. In his introduction to &quot;Mexico: The Revolution and Beyond&quot; (2003), Hamill writes about Agustin Victor Casasola, whose photographs recorded the Revolution of 1910–1920. In his introduction to &quot;A Living Lens: Photographs of Jewish Life from the Pages of the Forward&quot; (2007), Hamill evokes the heyday of American Yiddish journalism. His text for &quot;The Times Square Gym&quot; (1996) enhances John Goodman&#x27;s photographs of prizefighters, while his introduction to &quot;Garden of Dreams: Madison Square Garden&quot; (2004) offers a context for the sports photography of George Kalinski. Hamill&#x27;s Irish heritage informs the text for &quot;The Irish Face in America&quot; (2004), as seen by the photographer Jim Smith.

Hamill also wrote about comic strips, of which he was a collector. Among his writings on the subject are an introduction to &quot;Terry and the Pirates: Volume Two&quot; by Milton Caniff (2007), and an introductory text for a revised version of Al Hirschfeld&#x27;s &quot;The Speakeasies of 1932&quot; (2003). He also contributed an introduction to &quot;Jerry Robinson: Ambassador of Comics&quot; (2010).

===Television and film===
Hamill penned a handful of teleplays and screenplays, including adaptations of his own novels, and had a few minor film roles, usually playing a generic &quot;reporter,&quot; or himself. According to Robert Rosen, the Producer on &quot;French Connection II&quot;, he re-wrote all of the dialogue in the film, working nearly non-stop for three days, for which he did not receive screen credit. He appeared as a commentator in several documentaries, including Ric Burns&#x27; &quot;New York: A Documentary Film,&quot; and Ken Burns&#x27; &quot;Prohibition&quot;. He also appeared as a speaker in the 2018, 4-part Netflix documentary titled &quot;Bobby Kennedy for President&quot;. Hamill played himself in the 1991 film The King of New York, directed by Abel Ferrara and starring Christopher Walken.

==Personal life==
Hamill married his first wife, Ramona Negron, in 1962. Together, they had two daughters, Adrienne and Deirdre. They divorced in 1970. Seventeen years later, he married Fukiko Aoki, a fellow journalist from Japan. His work meant that he resided for long periods of time in Spain, Ireland, Saigon, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Rome, Los Angeles, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.

A friend of Robert F. Kennedy, Hamill helped persuade the senator to run for the United States presidency. He subsequently worked for Kennedy&#x27;s campaign and covered it as a journalist. He was one of four men who disarmed Sirhan Sirhan of his gun in the immediate aftermath of the senator&#x27;s assassination.

Hamill died on August 5, 2020, at NewYork–Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital. He was 85, and suffered from heart and kidney failure at the time of his death, in addition to having fractured his right hip in a fall.

==Honors==
Hamill received the Ernie Pyle Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Society of Newspaper Columnists in 2005. In 2010 Hamill received an Honorary Doctor of Letters Degree from St. John&#x27;s University. In 2010 he was presented the Louis Auchincloss Prize from the Museum of the City of New York.

<text>The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1987 (previously bill no. 8 of 1987) is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland that permitted the state to ratify the Single European Act. It was approved by referendum on 26 May 1987 and signed into law on 22 June of the same year.

==Background==
The Single European Act (SEA) was signed in February 1986 by the member states of the European Economic Community. It amended the Treaty of Rome and established the European Single Market. The European Communities (Amendment) Act 1986 was passed to allow provisions of the SEA to become part of domestic Irish law. On 22 December 1986, Raymond Crotty sought an injunction preventing Minister for Foreign Affairs Peter Barry from ratifying the Treaty on behalf of the state. He was refused relief by Donal Barrington in the High Court but was successful in part in the Supreme Court. In a majority judgment delivered in &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot;, the Court held that Title III of the SEA would bind the State to concede part of its sovereignty in a manner not permitted by the Constitution under the amendment made in 1972 to allow accession to the European Communities. In response, the newly elected government of Taoiseach Charles Haughey proposed an amendment to the constitution.

==Changes to the text==
Amendment to Article 29.4.3° by the addition of the text in bold (emphasis added):
==Oireachtas debates==
The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1987 was proposed in the Dáil by Taoiseach Charles Haughey on 22 April 1987 on behalf of the minority Fianna Fáil government. It was also supported by Fine Gael, who had negotiated the SEA during the previous government. At Second Stage, it passed by 108 votes to 29, where was opposed by the Progressive Democrats, the Labour Party, the Workers&#x27; Party, and independent TDs Neil Blaney and Tony Gregory. It passed Final Stages in the Dáil on 24 April by 123 votes to 17, on this occasion with the Progressive Democrats supporting its passage. It passed the Seanad on 25 April and proceeded to a referendum.

==Campaign==
As well as the parties above, the SEA was also supported by employers&#x27; and farmers&#x27; organisations.

==Result==


==Aftermath==
The Single European Act came into effect on 1 July 1987 after Ireland had ratified it.

Because of the decision of the Supreme Court in &quot;Crotty v An Taoiseach&quot;, the constitution would need to be amended on every further occasion before a treaty could be ratified that would transfer sovereignty from the Irish government to a supranational authority. This has since occurred on the following occasions:

*Maastricht Treaty
**Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland approved by referendum in 1992
*Amsterdam Treaty
**Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland approved by referendum in 1998
*Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
**Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland approved by referendum in 2001
*Nice Treaty
**Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2001 rejected by referendum in 2001
**Twenty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland approved by referendum in 2002
*Lisbon Treaty
**Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008 rejected by referendum in 2008
**Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland approved by referendum in 2009
*European Fiscal Compact
**Thirtieth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland approved by referendum in 2012

<text>Indoor cycling, often called spinning, is a form of exercise with classes focusing on endurance, strength, intervals, high intensity (race days) and recovery, and involves using a special stationary exercise bicycle with a weighted flywheel in a classroom setting. When people took cycling indoors in the late 19th century, whether for reasons of weather or convenience, technology created faster, more compact and efficient machines over time.
The first iterations of the stationary bike ranged from the vertical Gymnasticon to regular bicycles on rollers.

== Class content and goals ==

Classes generally use specialized stationary bicycles. Features include a mechanical device to modify the difficulty of pedaling, specially shaped handlebars, and multiple adjustment points to fit the bicycle to a range of riders. Many have a weighted flywheel, which simulates the effects of inertia and momentum when riding a real bicycle. The pedals are equipped with toe clips as on sports bicycles to allow one foot to pull up when the other is pushing down. They may alternatively have clipless receptacles for use with cleated cycling shoes. Padded shorts aid comfort and avoid the chafing caused by the sewn seams in underwear.

If the exercise is not done correctly or the rider&#x27;s position is bad, injuries can occur; problems with the lower back and knees are most common. To avoid injury and aid comfort it is important to make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it is essential to obtain the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant&#x27;s height. The height of the seat should be in level with the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the ball of the foot when the pedal is pointing forward. This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat at the bottom of the pedal stroke. Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort. A reasonable reference point is to set it in level with the seat.
A typical class involves a single instructor at the front of the class who leads the participants through routines that are designed to simulate terrain and situations similar to riding a bike outdoors. Some of the movements and positions include hill climbs, sprints and interval training. A well-trained instructor uses music, motivation, visualization and enthusiastic coaching to lead students through a ride that best suits their fitness level and goals. Most instructors will lead what is called an interval ride, where students will sprint, run, climb, and jump all in the same ride, but there will not be definable pattern to the exercises. In the early 2000s, &quot;terrain-based&quot; classes that simulate outdoor conditions (e.g., wind resistance) were introduced. Terrain-based classes are designed to improve a rider&#x27;s outdoor skill set and increase endurance while providing an intense cardio-based workout.

Participants set goals based on their heart rate, which can be measured by hand or using a heart rate monitor and ride simulated variations in terrain by altering resistance and cadence. Some participants choose to maintain a moderate, aerobic intensity level, with a heart rate of between 50 and 85% of max while others drive their heart rates higher in intervals of anaerobic activity to levels of between 85 and 92%.

One of the major advantages of indoor cycling is that each participant can exactly control his/her level of intensity to suit ability or fitness level but still remain as a group together. The classes can therefore be heterogeneous. As an alternative, participants can judge their level of exertion relative to a perceived exertion scale. The instructor should advise a recommended exertion scale from 1 (no exertion at all) to 10 (maximum exertion). Each rider is permitted to dictate how hard he/she chooses to work with the instructor providing active and dynamic encouragement together with technical and practical advice throughout the class.

Besides burning (on average) between 300 and 500 kcal in 60 minutes, indoor cycling also strengthens the muscles of the lower body. It tones the quadriceps and hamstrings, along with working the back and hips without placing the same strain present in typical weight-bearing exercises. It can be difficult to stay at the moderate level in a class that is geared towards more intensity. The difficulty of the workout is modulated in two ways:

#By varying the resistance on a flywheel attached to the pedals. The resistance is controlled by a knob, wheel or lever that the rider operates, causing the flywheel brake (a common bicycle brake, a friction wheel, a magnetic eddy current brake, a viscoelastic fluid brake, or a strap running around the flywheel) to tighten. On most bikes the brake can be adjusted from completely loose, providing no resistance to pedaling beyond the inertia of the flywheel, to so tight that the rider cannot move the pedals. Usually riders who can&#x27;t pedal at the resistance called out by the instructor are encouraged to ride at a level at which they feel comfortable yet challenged.
#By changing the cadence (the speed at which the pedals turn). Pedaling at a higher rate expends more energy than pedaling at a lower rate with the same resistance. Correct cadence is between the range of 80 to 110 RPM for seated flat, standing flat (running) and jumping and 60 to 80 RPM for seated climb, standing climb, running with resistance and jumps on a hill. Sprints are taken under hill resistance building cadence up to no more than 110 RPM. Seated sprints are most suitable as the rider maintains full control of posture at all times and will avoid falling due to exhaustion. A correct sprint should last from 10 to 25 seconds, leaving the rider exhausted in the 85 to 92% max heart rate range.

There are five core movements in the Spinning programme.
*Seated flat, with hands at the center part of the handlebars. This is hand position one. This position should be used only when seated, for flat road simulations and during the warm-up and cool down. Cadence between 80 and 110 RPM.
*Standing flat (also known as running), with hands wide on the back 12–14″ part of the handlebars that crosses the rider&#x27;s body. This is hand position two. Proper form for standing while running requires the body to be more upright and the back of the legs touching or enveloping the point of the saddle, with the center of gravity directly over the crank. The pressure of body weight should never rest excessively on the handlebars. Cadence is between 80 and 110 RPM
*Jumps, (also known as lifts), a combination of seated and standing with riders hands at position two for durations of between two and eight seconds. Cadence between 80 and 110 RPM.
*Seated climb with hands at position two, increased resistance and lower cadence of 60–80 RPM.
*Standing climb with hands wide and forward so the thumb tips are touching the far end of the handlebars (hand position three). The rider is canted slightly forward so that maximum force can be exerted onto the pedals with heavy resistance and a cadence of 60–80 RPM.

These five movements each work a different part of the body and focus on different leg muscle groups. The rider should always maintain control of the flywheel by having resistance applied and remaining below a cadence of 110 RPM. Not all bikes have a freewheel, or &#x27;smart release&#x27;, and it is possible that the flywheel will &#x27;run away&#x27; with the rider with the potential for causing injury. The rider should be able to maintain perfectly even pedal rotations at high resistance. This becomes difficult below 60 RPM cadence and failing to make &#x27;perfect circles&#x27; increases the risk of knee and hip injury. A road cyclist will normally have a natural pedal cadence, of about 85 RPM and will control changes in terrain by changing gear to maintain this rate. The goal of the spinning programme is not to exceed this natural rate by more than 25 RPM higher (110 RPM) or lower (60 RPM)
There are five further advanced movements based on those listed above.
*Running with resistance
*Jumps on a hill
*Seated flat sprint
*Seated hill sprint
*Standing hill sprint

Most indoor cycling classes are coached with music. Riders may synchronize their pedalling to be in time with the rhythm of the music, thus providing an external stimulus to encourage a certain tempo. Often, the music chosen by the instructor is dance music or rock music set to a dance beat (i.e. 4/4 time), but not necessarily. Cover versions of well known songs with a pronounced beat may be included. This tends to help motivate participants to work harder than they might otherwise. The instructor also may choose specific songs for sprints, climbs, and jumps. While the music provides a tempo cue, the cadence does not need to be a multiple of the beat in order for the rider to feel in rhythm; the music therefore helps a rider maintain any constant cadence, not just a cadence that matches the beat. It may depend on the level of exertion whether or not someone changes position or the instructor can tell the class to change.

A variation known as &quot;aqua cycling&quot; or &quot;hydrospinning&quot; also exists. In this, the stationary bicycles are underwater in a pool.

<text>The Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution Act 1992 (previously bill no. 12 of 1992) is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland which permitted the state to ratify the Treaty on European Union, commonly known as the Maastricht Treaty. It was approved by referendum on 18 June 1992 and signed into law on 16 July of the same year.

==Overview==

The Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution was one of a number of amendments that have been made to expressly permit the state to ratify changes to the founding treaties of the European Union (then known as the European Community) (others have been the Tenth, Eighteenth, Twenty-sixth and the Twenty-eighth Amendments). These amendments were all adopted because of the finding of the Supreme Court in &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot; (1987) that major changes to the treaties are unconstitutional unless accompanied by an amendment.

The Eleventh Amendment was introduced by a Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government and was also supported by opposition parties Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Democratic Left and the Green Party were opposed to it. Some anti-abortion groups also opposed the treaty, arguing that it might lead to legalised abortion in Ireland.

==Changes to the text==
The Eleventh Amendment amended Article 29.4 by the deletion of the highlighted sentence from subsection 3°:
and by the addition of the following subsections:

<doc id="672928" wikidata="Q1770984" url="?curid=672928" title="Quart Festival">
<text>The Quart Festival was an annual popular music festival that took place in Kristiansand, Norway in the beginning of July, from 1991 to 2008. It was the most visited music festival in Norway.

It was first named Qvadradurmusivalen in 1991, but changed into the more ear-catching Quart Festival the following year. For several years Quart was the largest music festival in Norway, but went bankrupt in 2008 in part due to tough competition from the Hovefestivalen in Arendal and some Oslo-based festivals.

==Scandals==
There have been some scandals during the years. 
*A local band Flying Crap fired a shotgun from the stage in 1995.
*Marilyn Manson ripped a bible on stage in 1999.
*The Kovenant burned a bible on stage in 2000.
*Mayhem threw pigs&#x27; heads at the audience in 2001.
*Eight musicians from hiphop group Equicez were arrested for drug offences in 2003.
*Kristopher Schau attached an engine to a dead pig and used it as a boat in 2003.
*Two persons from rainforest charity group Fuck For Forest had live sex on stage during a concert with The Cumshots in 2004.

==2008 cancelling and bankruptcy==
On the evening of 6 June, citing low ticket sales (14,000 against a budget of 30,000), the festival management officially decided to cancel the 2008 festival (due to start on 1 July) and as well file the managing company for bankruptcy. Following the 2007 festival, the company had a deficiency of roughly 16 million kroner.

==2009 – The festival returns==
The Quart Festival was revived by one of the original organisers and was held on 30 June to 4 July 2009. Slash&#x27;s performance was backed by Teddy Andreadis, Jason Bonham, Chris Cheney, John 5 and Frankie Perez, and included guest performances from Ozzy Osbourne, Ronnie Wood and Fergie.

The festival was an economic disaster with low attendances and slow revenues. The festival was by mid-September 2009 still not able to pay their employees and is now threatened by bankruptcy.

<text>Delta is a state in the South-South geopolitical zone of Nigeria. Named after the Niger Delta—a large part of which is in the state—the state was formed from the former Bendel State, on 27 August 1991. It is bordered on the north by Edo State, the east by Anambra and Rivers states, and the south by Bayelsa State while to the west is the Bight of Benin which covers about 160 kilometres of the state&#x27;s coastline. The state was initially created with 12 local government areas in 1991, but was later expanded to 19 and now has 25 local government areas. Its capital city is Asaba which is located along the River Niger on the northeastern end of the state, while the state&#x27;s economic center is the city of Warri on the southwestern coastline.

Of the 36 states, Delta is the 23rd largest in the area and twelfth most populous with an estimated population of over 5.6 million as of 2016. Geographically, the state is divided between the Central African mangroves in the coastal southwest and the Nigerian lowland forests in most of the rest of the state as a small portion of the Niger Delta swamp forests are in the far south. The other important geographical features are the River Niger and its distributary, the Forçados River, which flow along Delta&#x27;s eastern and southern borders, respectively; while fellow Niger distributary, the Escravos River, runs through Warri and the coastal areas are riddled with dozens of smaller Niger distributaries that make up much of the western Niger Delta. Much of the state&#x27;s nature contains threatened dwarf crocodile, Grey parrot, African fish eagle, mona monkey, and African manatee populations along with potentially extirpated populations of African leopard and Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee. Offshore, the state is also biodiverse as there are populations of Lesser African threadfin, crabs, and blue mussel along with various cetacean species.

What is now Delta State has been inhabited for years by various ethnic groups, including the Isoko and Eruwa in the centre of the state; Ukwuani in the east; the Ika, Enuani, and Olukumi in the northeast; the Anioma in the northwest; and the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo, in the southwest. In the pre-colonial period, the now-Delta State was divided into various monarchial states like the Kingdom of Warri and Agbon Kingdom before the area became a part of the British Oil Rivers Protectorate in 1884. In the early 1900s, the British incorporated the protectorate (now renamed the Niger Coast Protectorate) into the Southern Nigeria Protectorate which later amalgamated into British Nigeria. However, colonial forces did not gain permanent control of modern-day Delta State until the 1910s, due to the uprisings of the Ekumeku Movement. Notably, Delta has one of the few parts of Nigeria to have been under French control as the UK leased the enclave of Forcados to France from 1903 to 1930.

After independence in 1960, the area of now-Delta was a part of the post-independence Western Region until 1963 when the region was split and the area became part of the Mid-Western Region. In 1967, the Igbo-majority former Eastern Region attempted to secede as the state of Biafra and invaded the Mid-Western Region in an attempt to capture Lagos and end the war quickly; Biafran forces were halted and eventually pushed back but briefly declared the captured Mid-Western Region (including now-Delta State) as the Republic of Benin. During the occupation there were widespread hostilities between the Biafran forces and the mainly non-Igbo inhabitants of now-Delta State with Biafran forces committing atrocities against ethnic Hausa, Urhobo, and Ijaw people; similarly, upon the liberation of the Mid-West, Nigerian forces committed the Asaba massacre against ethnic Igbos in Asaba. At the war&#x27;s end and the reunification of Nigeria, the Mid-Western Region was reformed until 1976 when it was renamed Bendel State. In 1991, Bendel State was split with the north becoming Edo State and the south becoming Delta State.

Economically, Delta State is based around the production of crude oil and natural gas as one of the main oil-producing states in the country. Key minor industries involve agriculture as the state has substantial oil palm, yam, and cassava crops along with fishing and heliciculture. In large part due to its vast oil revenues, Delta has the fourth highest Human Development Index in the country; however, disputes between oil companies and local communities along with years of systemic corruption have led to hostilities that are often tied to the lack of development in host communities.

== Geography ==
Delta State covers a landmass of about , of which more than 60% is land. The state lies approximately between 5°00&#x27; and 6°45&#x27; E and 5°00&#x27; and 6°30&#x27; N. It is geographically located in Nigeria&#x27;s Midwest, bounded in the north and west by Edo State for 350 km (218 miles), the east by Anambra, and Rivers States for about 93 km and about 50 km respectively, southeast by Bayelsa State across the Niger River for 17 km and the Forçados River for 198 km, and on the southern extreme is the Bight of Benin which covers about 160 kilometres of the state&#x27;s coastline. Delta State is generally low-lying without any remarkable hills. The state has a wide coastal belt inter-laced with rivulets and streams, which form part of the Niger Delta.

=== Climate ===

An important characteristic of the Climate of Delta State is flooding. The ecological attributes of Delta State also include heavy rainfall, which makes the state, like other states in the Niger-Delta Nigeria to be regarded as lowland rainforest, freshwater swamp and mangrove swamp. Delta State has a mean rainfall of 36.9 mm, as well as an increase in rainfall which in the year 2015 resulted in inundation of farmlands in the state. 2015 was also the year the state had the highest rainfall, amounting to 3183.6 mm. In the year 2007, the state had the lowest rainfall over the 11-year period, amounting to an annual rainfall of 2030.58 mm. While January has the lowest rainfall in the state, in July, rainfall is very high at 423.2 mm.

== History ==
Delta State was defined out of the former Bendel State on 27 August 1991. The state was actualized following agitations for the realization of a separate distinct state by the peoples of the old Delta Province. There was yet another state request proposed as &quot;Anioma State&quot; comprising the Asaba and Agbor Divisions of the old Midwest region. The then Military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, recognized Delta state but chose &quot;Asaba&quot; a prominent town within the &quot;Northwestern Lower Niger&quot; as capital city. The proposed capital was a virgin land in the heart of the two constituent divisions that constitutes the Northwestern Lower Niger. Delta state was once integrated in the Mid Western state from 1963 to 1976 and later Bendel state, from 1976 to 1991. The name &quot;Bendel&quot; (Ben-Del) was coined from the old Benin and Delta Provinces of Western Region-Delta to reflect the integration of Benin and Delta provinces.

=== Politics ===
The State government is governed by an elected governor who works closely with members of the state&#x27;s House of Assembly.

=== Electoral system ===
The electoral system of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the State local government Areas. If no candidate passes a threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government Areas.

== Demographics ==
Delta State is predominantly inhabited by the Urhobo, Anioma, Isoko, Uvwie, Okpe, Ijaw, Ukwuani, Ika, Enuani,Igbo, Itsekiri and the Olukumi people. The population of other groups in the state are negligible.

The Itsekiri a subgroup of Yoruba though the third largest with an estimated population of 1.035 million people.

They are also known for the their rich cultural heritage.

The Okpe is a dialect of the Urhobo language. The Okpe people occupy two local government areas (Sapele and Okpe) in Delta Central.

The Ijaws are a group of people related to the predominant people of neighbouring Bayelsa State, while the Olukumi are becoming culturally and linguistically extinct, due to acculturation and assimilation.

The vast majority of inhabitants are Christian, with very few practicing traditional religions.

<text>Roger Caillois (; 3 March 1913 – 21 December 1978) was a French intellectual and prolific writer whose original work brought together literary criticism, sociology, poetry, ludology and philosophy by focusing on very diverse subjects such as games, surrealism, south-American literature, the mineral world, dreams and images, ethnology, the history of religions and the sacred. He was also instrumental in introducing Latin American authors such as Jorge Luis Borges, Pablo Neruda and Miguel Ángel Asturias to the French public. After his death, the French Literary award Prix Roger Caillois was named after him in 1991.

==Biography==
Caillois was born in Reims in 1913 which he left for Paris at the age of 16. There he completed his secondary studies at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, an elite school where students prepared for entry examinations to France&#x27;s most prestigious École Normale Supérieure. Caillois&#x27; efforts paid off: he graduated as a &quot;normalien&quot; in 1933 before entering the École Pratique des Hautes Études, where he came into contact with such eminent linguists as Georges Dumézil and Alexandre Kojève. During these formative years Caillois extended his circle of friends that came to include many influential figures of the French intelligentsia like André Breton, Jacques Lacan, Michel Leiris or George Bataille.

The years before the war were marked by Caillois&#x27; increasingly leftist political commitment, particularly in his fight against fascism. He was also engaged in Paris&#x27; avant-garde intellectual life. With Georges Bataille he founded the College of Sociology, a group of intellectuals who lectured regularly to one another. Formed partly as a reaction to the Surrealist movement that was dominant in the 1920s, the college sought to move away from surrealism&#x27;s focus on the fantasy life of an individual&#x27;s unconscious and focus instead more on the power of ritual and other aspects of communal life. Caillois&#x27; background in anthropology and sociology, and particularly his interest in the sacred, exemplified this approach.

In June 1939, at the invitation of Victoria Ocampo whom he had met in Paris a few months earlier and with whom he engaged a close, life-long amorous friendship, Caillois left France for Argentina, where the start of World War II forced him to stay. There he played an active role against the spread of Nazism in Latin America through his conferences and his contributions to anti-fascist magazines such as &quot;Sur&quot; and &quot;Les Volontaires&quot; and as editor of the new periodical &quot;Lettres françaises&quot;.

Back to Paris in 1945, he persuades the publisher Gaston Gallimard to create a collection of books translated from contemporary Latin American authors; this will be &quot;La Croix du Sud&quot; which he directs as founding editor, and will play a key role in introducing authors such as Jorge Luis Borges, Alejo Carpentier and Pablo Neruda to the French-speaking public. In 1948 he is recruited by UNESCO - where he will retire 25 years later at the age of 60 - and begins to travel widely.

He finds the time to conduct serious, personal research on a broad range of subjects and publishes widely, receiving increasing praise and recognition in literary circles: among his most notable books &quot;Les jeux et les hommes&quot; (1958) translated to English by Meyer Barash in 1961 as &quot;Man, Play and Games&quot;, &quot;Puissances du rêve&quot; (1962), &quot;Pierres&quot; (1966), &quot;Cases d&#x27;un échiquier&quot; (1970).

In 1971 he is elected to the Académie française and publishes in 1978 a powerful &#x27;imaginary&#x27; autobiography, &quot;Le fleuve Alphée&quot; an award-winning autobiographical essay (Marcel Proust Awards and European Union Prize for Literature).

Roger Caillois died in Paris on 21 December 1978, aged 65, following a brain hemorrhage.

Today Caillois is also remembered for founding in 1952 &quot;Diogenes&quot;, an interdisciplinary quarterly journal edited in French, Spanish and English with initial funding by UNESCO and still published to this day. He is also widely cited in the nascent field of ludology, primarily from passages in his book &quot;Les Jeux et les hommes (1958).&quot;

==Key ideas on play==

Caillois built critically on an earlier theory of play developed by the Dutch cultural historian Johan Huizinga in his book &quot;Homo Ludens&quot; (1938). Huizinga had discussed the importance of play as an element of culture and society. He used the term &quot;Play Theory&quot; to define the conceptual space in which play occurs, and argued that play is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for the generation of culture.

Caillois began his own book &quot;Man, Play and Games&quot; (1961) with Huizinga&#x27;s definition of play:

&quot;Summing up the formal characteristics of play we might call it a free activity standing quite consciously outside &quot;ordinary&quot; life as being &quot;not serious,&quot; but at the same time absorbing the player intensely and utterly. It is an activity connected with no material interest, and no profit can be gained by it. It proceeds within its own proper boundaries of time and space according to fixed rules and in an orderly manner. It promotes the formation of social groupings which tend to surround themselves with secrecy and to stress their difference from the common world by disguise or other means.&quot;

Caillois disputed Huizinga&#x27;s emphasis on competition in play. He also noted the considerable difficulty in arriving at a comprehensive definition of play, concluding that play is best described by six core characteristics: 
* 1. it is free, or not obligatory
* 2. it is separate from the routine of life, occupying its own time and space
* 3. it is uncertain, so that the results of play cannot be pre-determined and the player&#x27;s initiative is involved
* 4. it is unproductive in that it creates no wealth, and ends as it begins economically speaking
* 5. it is governed by rules that suspend ordinary laws and behaviours and that must be followed by players
* 6. it involves make-believe that may be set against &#x27;real life&#x27;.

Caillois focuses on the last two characteristics, rules and make-believe. According to Caillois, they &quot;may be related&quot; but are mutually exclusive: &quot;Games are not ruled and make-believe. Rather, they are ruled &quot;or&quot; make-believe.&quot;

Caillois&#x27; definition has itself been criticized by subsequent thinkers; and ultimately, despite Caillois&#x27; attempt at a definitive treatment, definitions of play remain open to negotiation.

Caillois distinguished four categories of games:

* Agon, or competition. In this form of play, the players have equal chances but the winner succeeds because of &quot;a single quality (speed, endurance, strength, memory, skill, ingenuity, etc.), exercised, within defined limits and without outside assistance.&quot; Agon prioritizes skill, work, and professionalization.
* , or chance. In contrast to agon, games of alea depend on chance and fortune. Alea negates skill and highlights &quot;a surrender to destiny&quot;.
* Mimesis, or mimicry, or role playing Caillois defines it as &quot;When the individual plays to believe, to make himself or others believe that he is different from himself.&quot; E.g. playing an online role-playing game.
* Ilinx, which Caillois describes as &quot;voluptuous panic&quot; in the sense of altering perception by experiencing a strong emotion (panic, fear, ecstasy) the stronger the emotion is, the stronger the sense of excitement and fun becomes. E.g. bungee jumping or Caillois&#x27;s example of children spinning in a circle until they become dizzy.

It&#x27;s worth noting that these categories can be combined to create a more diverse experience and enhance the players interaction, for example poker is a form of Agon-Alea, Alea is present in the form of the cards and their combinations, but it&#x27;s not the only winning factor; since Agon is present in the form of bluffing, making your opponent think you have better cards by rising the bet, therefore putting pressure on the other players and thus making it possible to win by having a card combination but winning by implementing the bluff skill.

Caillois also described a dualistic polarity within which the four categories of games can be variously located:

* Paidia or uncontrolled fantasy, spontaneous play through improvisation, the rules of which are created during playing time. E.g. concerts and festivals.
* Ludus which requires effort, patience, skill, or ingenuity, the rules are set from the beginning and the game was designed before playing time. E.g. the Chinese game of Go.

Caillois disagreed particularly with Huizinga&#x27;s treatment of gambling. Huizinga had argued in &quot;Homo Ludens&quot; that the risk of death or of losing money corrupts the freedom of &quot;pure play&quot;. Thus to Huizinga, card-games are not play but &quot;deadly earnest business&quot;. Moreover, Huizinga considered gambling to be a &quot;futile activity&quot; which inflicts damage on society. Thus Huizinga argued that gambling is a corruption of a more original form of play.

Against this, Caillois argued that gambling is a true game, a mode of play that falls somewhere between games of skill or competition and games of chance (i.e. between the &quot;Agon&quot; and &quot;Alea&quot; categories). Whether or not a game involves money or a risk of death, it can be considered a form of &quot;Agon&quot; or &quot;Alea&quot; as long as it provides social activity and triumph for the winner. Gambling is &quot;like a combat in which equality of chances is artificially created, in order that adversaries should confront each other under ideal conditions, susceptible of giving precise and incontestable value to the winner’s triumph.&quot;

==Interest in mimicry==
When Caillois worked with Bataille at the College of Sociology, they worked on two essays on insects in the 1930s: &quot;‘La mante religieuse. De la biologie à la psychanalyse’&quot; (1934) and &quot;‘Mimétisme et la psychasthénie légendaire’&quot; (1935) Caillois identifies &quot;the praying mantis and mimicking animals as nature’s automatons and masquerades.&quot; He formulates &quot;in his peculiarly naturalist fashion what it would mean to act and create without the intervention of the sovereign ego, that magnificent artifact of the modern West that surrealism and the avant-garde have taken such drastic measures to counteract.&quot; These articles &quot;might read like two obscurantist entomological studies that, in a way some would describe as bizarre, try to contradict all evolutionary explications for animal cannibalism and mimicry. Their publication in the context of [the surrealist journal] &quot;Minotaure&quot; makes it possible to see them as the search for figures that evidence the possibility of intelligence without thought, creativity without art, and agency in the absence of the (human) agent.&quot;

<text>The Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1996 (previously bill no. 49 of 1996) is an amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which provides that a court can refuse bail to a suspect where it feared that while at liberty they would commit a serious criminal offence. It was approved by referendum on 28 November 1996 and signed into law on 12 December of the same year.

==Background==
In &quot;People (AG) v O&#x27;Callaghan&quot; (1966), the Supreme Court had ruled that the provisions of Article 40.4, which guarantees personal liberty and the principle of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, meant that an individual charged with a crime could only be refused bail if they were likely to flee or to interfere with witnesses or evidence. In a 1976 Dáil debate on &quot;the breakdown in law and order&quot;, Paddy Cooney, the Minister for Justice in the Fine Gael–Labour coalition, said the government favoured a referendum on reducing the right to bail.

A Law Reform Commission report published in August 1995 and chaired by former Supreme Court judge Anthony Hederman considered legal approaches to bail. The Sixteenth Amendment made it possible for a court to take into account whether or not a person had committed serious crimes while on bail in the past. The amendment was introduced by the Fine Gael–Labour Party–Democratic Left government led by Taoiseach John Bruton.

==Changes to the text==
Insertion of new Article 40.4.7°:

==Oireachtas debate==
A similar proposal had been proposed by Fianna Fáil Justice Spokesperson John O&#x27;Donoghue on 8 June 1995. On 4 October 1995, this was rejected by 65 votes to 47.

On 16 October 1996, Minister for Justice Nora Owen proposed the Sixteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 1996. It was supported by the two major opposition parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, and passed final stages in the Dáil on the same day. It passed final stages in the Seanad on 23 October and proceeded to a referendum on 28 November 1996.

==Result==


==Aftermath==
The Bail Act 1997 was passed as the provision to be made by law arising from the amendment.

<doc id="672934" wikidata="Q1196384" url="?curid=672934" title="The Lawnmower Man (film)">
<text>The Lawnmower Man is a 1992 science fiction horror film directed by Brett Leonard, written by Leonard and Gimel Everett, and starring Jeff Fahey as Jobe Smith, an intellectually disabled gardener, and Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Angelo, a scientist who decides to experiment on him in an effort to give him greater intelligence by stimulating his brain using nootropic drugs and virtual reality computer simulations. The experiments give Jobe superhuman abilities, but also increase his aggression, turning him into a man obsessed with evolving into a digital being.

The film was originally marketed as the adaptation of a 1975 short story by Stephen King, which featured a Pan-worshipping satyr using his mystical powers to operate a landscaping business and mow lawns. Allied Vision began developing the film after a planned adaptation of King&#x27;s book &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1978), an anthology the story was published in. However, it struggled to expand King&#x27;s original story into a feature film and instead rewrote an unrelated screenplay entitled &quot;CyberGod&quot; into an adaptation. The final film bears little resemblance to the original story beyond a single sequence of the antagonist telekinetically using a lawn mower to murder a character named “Harold Parkette.” Because of the deviation from his story, King successfully sued to have his name removed from the film, which was originally titled &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s The Lawnmower Man.&quot; King won further damages when his name was included in the title of the home video release.

A sequel, &quot;Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace&quot;, was released in 1996, with Austin O&#x27;Brien as the only returning actor from the original film.

==Plot==
Dr. Lawrence Angelo, a scientist at Virtual Space Industries (VSI), conducts experiments using psychoactive drugs and virtual reality to enhance cognitive performance in a program called &quot;Project 5.&quot; Although Angelo&#x27;s intentions are benevolent, VSI is funded by &quot;The Shop,&quot; a clandestine organization seeking military applications for his research. One of his test subjects, a chimpanzee named Rosco, gains enhanced intelligence, warfare training, and increased aggression; he eventually escapes but is killed by the laboratory&#x27;s security forces. In response, Angelo decides to recruit Jobe Smith, an intellectually disabled gardener, as a new test subject, promising him increased intelligence. Angelo redesigns the treatments to eliminate the &quot;aggression factors&quot; used in the chimpanzee experiments. Not only does Jobe&#x27;s intelligence improve, but he also develops psychokinesis and telepathy. He continues his training at the lab until an accident forces Angelo to halt the experiment.

Sebastian Timms, the project director, monitors the progress and secretly replaces Angelo&#x27;s new medications with the original Project 5 formula. When Jobe invites his new lover Marnie to the lab for cybersex, he accidentally lobotomizes her. Undeterred, Jobe continues the treatments on his own and begins killing those who mistreated him in the past, as well as the abusive father of his 10-year-old friend, Peter. Angelo discovers the drug switch and confronts Jobe, who captures him and reveals his plan to achieve the ultimate stage of evolution by transforming into a being of &quot;pure energy&quot; within the VSI computer mainframe, intending to connect to all the world&#x27;s computer systems. Jobe vows that his &quot;birth&quot; will be signaled by every phone on Earth ringing simultaneously.

The Shop sends a team to capture Jobe, but he uses his newfound abilities to destroy them. Jobe then enters the VSI mainframe, abandoning his physical body and becoming a digital being. Angelo remotely accesses the VSI computer, encrypting its connections to the outside world, thereby trapping Jobe in the mainframe. As Jobe frantically searches for an unencrypted network, Angelo sets bombs to destroy the building. Feeling responsible for Jobe&#x27;s fate, Angelo enters virtual reality, attempting to reason with him one last time, even if it means dying together. Jobe overpowers Angelo, crucifying his digital form. When Peter enters the building, Jobe realizes the boy is in danger from the bombs. Out of lingering care for Peter, Jobe allows Angelo to escape the mainframe to save the child. Jobe himself escapes through a maintenance line just before the building explodes.

Later, Angelo is at home with Peter and his mother, Carla, when the telephone rings. Soon, another phone rings, followed by phones ringing worldwide — Jobe&#x27;s signal that he has succeeded.

==Production==
The plot of Stephen King&#x27;s 1975 short story &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; concerns Harold Parkette, who hires &quot;Pastoral Greenery and Outdoor Services Inc.&quot; to cut his lawn. Parkette later spies on the serviceman, discovering his lawnmower mows the lawn by itself while he crawls after it, naked, eating the grass. The serviceman is actually a satyr who worships the Greek god Pan. When Parkette tries to call the police, the mower and its owner ritually kill him as a sacrifice to Pan.

Milton Subotsky and Andrew Donally first acquired the film rights to &quot;Night Shift&quot; (1978), the anthology the story appeared in, in 1978. Edward and Valerie Abraham wrote a screenplay for an anthology film adapting “The Lawnmower Man,” “The Mangler,” and “Trucks” revolving around the theme of humanity&#x27;s relationship with technology. Dino De Laurentiis purchased the rights to the screenplay in 1984 with the intention of making a series of King anthology films beginning with &quot;Cat&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1985). However, it was later decided that the stories should be made into individual films, beginning with the adaptation of “Trucks” as &quot;Maximum Overdrive&quot; (1986). Allied Vision acquired the rights to adapt “The Lawnmower Man” but struggled to adapt the story into a feature-length film.

Meanwhile, director Brett Leonard and producer Gimel Everett wrote an original screenplay about virtual reality technology titled &quot;Cyber God&quot;. They were inspired by seeing Jaron Lanier and his VPL Research technology at a San Francisco event called &quot;Cyberthon&quot;; Brosnan later suggested using some Lanier&#x27;s lines in the film, and both VPL&#x27;s DataSuit and EyePhone appear in the film as props. Allied Vision decided to combine the two projects, and between May and August 1990 they rewrote their script into &quot;The Lawnmower Man.&quot; The new screenplay carried minor elements of King&#x27;s original story, including the scene where Jobe kills Peter&#x27;s father with the lawnmower &quot;Big Red&quot;, and the aftermath in which the police state that they found some of his remains in the birdbath. The addition of a government agency known as &quot;The Shop&quot; was drawn from separate works of King&#x27;s, such as &quot;Firestarter&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Tommyknockers&quot; (1987).

The film has several elements in common with the 1959 Daniel Keyes novel &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, which also deals with a mentally disabled man whose intelligence is technologically boosted to genius levels. A similar parallel can be drawn with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series (second pilot) episode of 1966 titled &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;.

Principal photography on the film began on May 28, 1991, in Los Angeles with a $10 million budget. The computer-generated imagery (CGI) was created for the film by Angel Studios. The scene where the priest is set on fire is an early use of motion capture, and was done by an Italian company who used the technology as a tool for golf training. A technique called the Gemini process was used to transfer CGI onto film by putting the digital images on a high-resolution cathode-ray tube (CRT) screen, frame by frame, which were then shot with a motion picture camera. The supervising sound editor was Frank Serafine, who was hired as a result of his sound creation work in the 1982 film &quot;Tron&quot;. Fuji Creative&#x27;s Masao Takiyama is also credited as a co-producer.

==Release==

The film was tested in Jacksonville, Florida, Fresno, California, and Providence, Rhode Island on February 14, 1992 and released in the United States on March 6, in 1,276 theatres.

The film was released in Japan under the title &quot;Virtual Wars&quot;.

==Reception==
===Director&#x27;s cut===
The original theatrical release had a large element cut from it involving Rosco the chimpanzee. In the film&#x27;s opening Rosco escapes the lab and is helped by Jobe, who then witnesses him getting shot dead. This then led to several other cuts throughout the film to remove call back to this plot element. Another major difference includes moments with Lawrence&#x27;s wife. In the theatrical cut she just disappears, but in the director&#x27;s cut, Jobe controls her later on, and still later she is killed by the agents. Along with those major additions, there are also several scenes with extra dialogue. The director&#x27;s cut was initially released on VHS and laserdisc by New Line Cinema. The 1997 DVD, however, only included the theatrical cut with most of the director&#x27;s cut scenes included as deleted scenes. In 2017, Shout! Factory released both cuts on Blu-ray, both taken from 4K scans of the original elements.

===Critical reception===
, the film held a 37% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews with an average of 4.9 out of 10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;&quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; suffers from a predictable, melodramatic script, and its once-groundbreaking visual effects look dated today&quot;. Metacritic gives the film a rating of 42 out of 100 based on 14 reviews.

===Box office===
The movie debuted at number two at the box office with $7.7 million in its opening weekend behind &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;. It went on to gross $32.1 million in the United States and Canada, making it the highest-grossing independent film for the calendar year and the second biggest released in 1992 after Miramax&#x27;s &quot;The Crying Game&quot;. It did better internationally and grossed £3,622,720 ($6 million) in the United Kingdom and $112 million in other markets for a worldwide total of $150 million. It was the highest-grossing UK production in the United Kingdom for the calendar year.

==Stephen King lawsuit==
The film, originally titled &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s The Lawnmower Man&quot;, differed so much from the source material that King sued the filmmakers in May 1992 to remove his name from the title. King stated in court documents that the film &quot;bore no meaningful resemblance&quot; to his story.

A federal judge ruled in King&#x27;s favor in July 1992, the first successful such ruling since James Oliver Curwood had his name removed from 1922&#x27;s &quot;I Am the Law&quot;. On appeal, it was ruled in October that the on-screen credit could remain but that King&#x27;s name should be removed from advertising. King received $2.5 million in settlement.

Despite the ruling, New Line still did not comply and initially released the home video version as &quot;Stephen King&#x27;s The Lawnmower Man&quot;. In 1994, New Line was held in contempt of court.

==Home media==
New Line Home Video simultaneously released the 108-minute theatrical version of the film and an unrated 142-minute director&#x27;s cut on VHS and LaserDisc on August 26, 1992. The success of the unrated version alerted King to New Line&#x27;s continued defiance of the order that his name be stricken from the film&#x27;s credits and all marketing, as the back covers still stated &quot;Based on a Story by Stephen King&quot;. A third court order was needed to force the studio&#x27;s compliance. As before, the court upheld the two prior judgments, but it took the extra step of imposing a penalty of $10,000 directly payable to King for every day New Line remained in contempt by defying the order. Additionally, the studio would have to forfeit all profits earned on the film during that same period.

The film was released on VCD in 1996. The DVD, released in December 1997, contains only the theatrical cut, with scenes from the unrated edition included as deleted scenes.

In February 1997, the director&#x27;s cut was released in widescreen for the first time on double LaserDisc, featuring various special features on the C-side. The transfer used for the LaserDisc left King&#x27;s name in the opening credits, but removed it from the title screen.

The director&#x27;s cut was released on DVD with the inclusion of the sequel &quot;Lawnmower Man 2&quot; on October 25, 2010, in the United Kingdom. However, it is a direct port of the earlier open matte NTSC LaserDisc release converted to PAL.

Prior to the US Shout! Factory release, Blu-ray versions of the film were only available in Italy through Minerva Pictures and in Germany under the Alive brand. The Italian release contains edited Italian credits at the beginning. These are clearly taken from the DVD version, creating a visible difference in quality from the rest of the movie (notably interlaced framing).

Shout! Factory released &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; on Blu-ray for the first time in the United States in June 2017. The two-disc set includes new 4k digital restorations of the theatrical and director&#x27;s cuts, audio commentary with director Brett Leonard and producer Gimel Everett, an all-new retrospective documentary featuring Leonard and star Jeff Fahey, and all of the bonus features from the original New Line DVD. For unknown reasons, a line of dialogue from the theatrical release related to the killing of a chimp (which makes no sense in the context of the plot of the director&#x27;s cut - in that version, the chimp escaped from the VSI lab) was re-introduced to the director&#x27;s cut.

In Australia, the only version of the film to be released was the theatrical cut - the director&#x27;s cut was only available as a UK import. It was not released on DVD until 2008, when Force Entertainment released a budget DVD, containing the theatrical cut and the special features from the US DVD, on its own or as a two-pack with its sequel.

==Sequel and other media==
A graphic novel adaptation of the film was announced by Innovation Comics for April 1992 release, but was never published.

A sequel, &quot;Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace&quot;, was released in 1996 with Austin O&#x27;Brien as the only returning actor from the original film. It was retitled &quot;Lawnmower Man 2: Jobe&#x27;s War&quot; for its video release. The film received negative reviews from critics and fans of the first movie.

The film spawned two video games: &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; in 1993, and &quot;Cyberwar&quot; in 1994.

Comic book writer Grant Morrison said in an interview that they were contacted by the owners of the &quot;Lawnmower Man&quot; in 1995 and asked to write treatments for &quot;Lawnmower Man 2&quot; and &quot;Lawnmower Man 3&quot;. Morrison claims they were asked to &quot;bend the &quot;Lawnmower Man&quot; series in an X-Men superhero-type direction&quot;. Neither of Morrison&#x27;s script treatments was used and &quot;Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace&quot; was produced without their involvement.

Some of the CGI footage of &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot; was featured in the 1992 CG art film &quot;Beyond the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

Jaunt VR, a virtual reality studio, attempted to adapt the feature into a virtual reality experience with the original rights holders but ultimately went out of business before realizing its efforts.

==Short film==
An earlier short film, also titled &quot;The Lawnmower Man&quot;, was directed by Jim Gonis in 1987. That film was a direct adaptation of the short story by King.

<doc id="672936" wikidata="Q5977761" url="?curid=672936" title="USS Dale (DD-290)">
<text>The third USS &quot;Dale&quot; (DD-290) was a in the United States Navy. She was named for Richard Dale.

==Service history==
===United States Navy===
&quot;Dale&quot; was launched 19 November 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; sponsored by Mrs. A. J. Peters; and commissioned 16 February 1920.

From 3 March to 3 April 1920 &quot;Dale&quot; patrolled New England waters aiding in the recalibration of radio compass stations in the 1st Naval District. Assigned to Destroyer Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, she operated with destroyer squadrons along the Atlantic coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, and in the Caribbean Sea. Her activities included tactical exercises and battle practice; fleet maneuvers, war exercises, and fleet search problems; training naval reservists; and service from Norfolk, Virginia in the calibration of radio compass stations in the 5th Naval District.

On 17 June 1924 &quot;Dale&quot; sailed from Newport, Rhode Island under the command of William F. Halsey, Jr. to make courtesy visits to ports in Germany, Denmark, Norway, Scotland, England, France, Spain, and Portugal. Arriving at Gibraltar on 21 September, she cruised in the Mediterranean Sea until June, engaging in battle practice, intelligence work, and international goodwill calls. She departed Gibraltar on 2 July 1925 for New York City, arriving on 16 July.

&quot;Dale&quot; operated with Destroyer Squadrons, Scouting Fleet, on the United States East Coast, in the Caribbean, and in the Panama Canal Zone until arrival at Philadelphia, on 21 September 1929. She was decommissioned there on 1 May 1930 and sold on 17 January 1931.

===Commercial banana boat===
The destroyer equipped with a new propulsion plant, converted to a banana carrier and renamed MV &quot;Masaya&quot; operating for the Standard Fruit and Steamship Co., of New Orleans, Louisiana from 1933.

===United States Army and fate===
With the Philippines cut off by Japanese forces the War Department attempted to use blockade runners. Some were to make the attempt from Australia or Java, but some were to make the attempt directly from the United States. One recommendation, carried directly to the President of the United States, was the acquisition by bareboat charter and use of three World War I destroyers that had been converted to fast banana carriers, one immediately available in New Orleans. Cargos for two other vessels, then in the Caribbean, were to be sent to await their availability in New Orleans. Delays occurred, but &quot;Masaya&quot; departed New Orleans on 2 March 1942 with &quot;Matagalpa&quot; following on 11 March and &quot;Teapa&quot; on 18 March. All were delayed for repairs in Los Angeles with reloading for Corregidor. They reached Hawaii too late to relieve Corregidor. The ship was instead sent to the Southwest Pacific Area, entering the Southwest Pacific Area command&#x27;s permanent local fleet on 12 March 1942, where in an effort to support operations in Buna she was bombed and sunk five miles to the east of Oro Bay, New Guinea on 28 March 1943. Casualties were 10 killed + 1 DOW/4 wounded

<doc id="672941" wikidata="Q7457645" url="?curid=672941" title="Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1997 amended the Constitution of Ireland to provide that the confidentiality of meetings of the cabinet would not prevent the High Court from ordering that certain information be disclosed when this was in the public interest. It was approved by referendum on 30 October 1997 and signed into law on 14 November of the same year.

==Changes to the text==
Inserted a new subsection in Article 28.4:

The existing subsection 3° of Article 28.4 was renumbered as subsection 4°.

==Overview==
In 1992, during the Beef Tribunal, the Supreme Court ruled that, as the constitution stood, the confidentiality of meetings of the Government (the cabinet) was unbreachable and absolute. The court derived its ruling from Article 28.4.2°, which requires that the Government observe the principle of collective responsibility. The purpose of the Seventeenth Amendment was to allow cabinet confidentiality to be relaxed in certain circumstances.

The amendment was adopted during the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government led by Bertie Ahern but had been first drafted and suggested by the previous Fine Gael–Labour Party–Democratic Left government led by John Bruton. The amendment, therefore, had the support of all major parties. The referendum occurred on the same day as the 1997 presidential election.

<text>The Export–Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is the official export credit agency (ECA) of the United States federal government. Operating as a wholly owned federal government corporation, the bank &quot;assists in financing and facilitating U.S. exports of goods and services&quot;, particularly when private sector lenders are unable or unwilling to provide financing. Its current chairman and president, Reta Jo Lewis, was confirmed by the Senate on February 9, 2022.

The Export–Import Bank was established in 1934 as the Export-Import Bank of Washington by an executive order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Its stated goal was &quot;to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports and the exchange of commodities between the United States and other Nations or the agencies or nationals thereof.&quot; The bank&#x27;s first transaction was a $3.8 million loan to Cuba in 1935 for the purchase of U.S. silver ingots. In 1945, it was made an independent agency within the executive branch by the United States Congress.

Under federal law, the EXIM must be reauthorized by Congress every four to five years. Following a brief lapse in Congressional authorization on July 1, 2015, which prevented the bank from engaging in new business, it was reauthorized through September 2019 via the Fixing America&#x27;s Surface Transportation Act of December 2015. In December 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Export-Import Bank Extension into law as part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, which authorized the bank until December 31, 2026.

Over its lifetime, the Export-Import Bank has helped finance several historic projects including the Pan-American Highway, the Burma Road, and post-World War II reconstruction. While supporters argue that the bank allows small and medium-sized businesses to participate in the global market, critics allege that it shows favoritism to large corporations and special interests.

== Overview ==
The Export–Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is a government agency that provides a variety of tools intended to aid the export of American goods and services. The mission of the Bank is to create and sustain U.S. jobs by financing sales of U.S. exports to international buyers. EXIM equips U.S. exporters and their customers with tools such as buyer financing, export credit insurance, and access to working capital. Second, when U.S. exporters face foreign competition backed by other governments, EXIM provides buyer financing to match or counter the financing offered by almost 96 ECAs around the world. The Bank is chartered as a government corporation by the Congress of the United States; it was last chartered for a three-year term in 2012. The Charter details the Bank&#x27;s authorities and limitations. Among them is the principle that EXIM does not compete with private sector lenders, but rather provides financing for transactions that would otherwise not occur because commercial lenders are either unable or unwilling to accept the political or commercial risk inherent in the deal.

The EXIM&#x27;s products are intended to assist export sales for any American export company regardless of size. The bank&#x27;s charter provides that EXIM makes available &quot;not less than 20%&quot; of its lending authority to small businesses although they have often fallen short of the 20% threshold. In fiscal year 2013 however, 76% of the value of loans and guarantees went to the top 10 recipients.

Similar banks, known generally as export credit agencies (ECAs), are operated by 60 foreign countries. As the United States is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) they conduct their activities by obeying OECD rules and principles. The goal is to permit exporters in various countries to compete on the basis of the quality of their goods and services, not on preferential financing terms. ECAs of countries which are not participants of the OECD, such as the China Exim Bank are not required by their governments to follow OECD rules.

== Leadership ==
The Board of Directors consists of the President of the Export-Import Bank, who also serves as Chairman, the First Vice President, who serves as Vice Chairman, and three additional Directors appointed by the President of the United States by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. Of these five members of the Board, no more than three can be members of any one political party. In addition, at least one of the members must be selected from among the small business community. The members are appointed to staggered terms of four years. They can continue to serve on the board past the expiration of their term until their successor takes office, but not beyond six months after the expiration of their term.

The United States Trade Representative and the Secretary of Commerce shall serve, ex officio and without vote, as additional members of the Board of Directors of the Bank.

== History ==
=== Early history (1934–1944) ===
EXIM was organized originally as a District of Columbia banking corporation by Executive Order 6581 from Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 2, 1934, under the name Export–Import Bank of Washington. The stated goal was &quot;to aid in financing and to facilitate exports and imports and the exchange of commodities between the United States and other Nations or the agencies or nationals thereof&quot;, with the immediate goal of making loans to the USSR and Latin America. Roosevelt created a Second Export–Import Bank of Washington with Executive Order 6638 on March 9, 1934, with the specific goal of aiding trade with Cuba. The Bank&#x27;s first transaction was a $3.8 million loan to Cuba in 1935 for the purchase of U.S. silver ingots. The First and Second Export–Import Banks were combined in 1936 when Congress transferred the obligations of the Second Export–Import Bank to the first.

=== Independent agency (1945–present) ===
Congress made the bank an independent agency on July 31, 1945, with the Export–Import Bank Act of 1945. On March 13, 1968, further legislation changed the name to &quot;Export–Import Bank of the United States&quot;. EXIM became a self-sustaining (self-funding) agency in 2007, though the loans remain backed by the government.

The Government Corporation Control Act of 1945 requires the Bank to be reauthorized by Congress every four to five years. Reauthorizations have been approved several times:
It was last chartered for a three-year term in 2012 and in September 2014 was extended through June 30, 2015. Congressional authorization for the bank lapsed as of July 1, 2015. As a result, the bank could not engage in new business, but it continued to manage its existing loan portfolio. Five months later, after the successful employment of the rarely used discharge petition procedure in the House of Representatives, Congress reauthorized the bank until September 2019 via the Fixing America&#x27;s Surface Transportation Act signed into law on December 4, 2015, by President Barack Obama. In December 2019, President Donald Trump signed the Export-Import Bank Extension into law as part of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116–94) which authorized the bank until December 31, 2026.

EXIM institution the China and Transformational Exports program in an effort to assist American exporters in competing with Chinese companies and to maintain American advantages in specified industries.

== Projects assisted ==
=== Pan-American Highway ===
The Pan-American Highway runs from Alaska to Chile through 14 countries with important transportation links to nearly all of continental Latin America. The highway was constructed beginning in 1936 with the last phase complete in 1980.

EXIM Bank credits and loans supported construction of the Pan-American Highway in Mexico, Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile. In Paraguay, Argentina, and Bolivia EXIM supported construction of highway spurs connected to the Pan-American Highway. EXIM approved twenty credits to U.S. companies including Caterpillar, Koehring Co., Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing, The Galion Iron Works, and Thew Shovel to help build the highway.

=== Burma Road ===
Constructed between 1937 and 1938, the 717-mile Burma Road links Lashio in present-day Myanmar (previously Burma) to Kunming in Yunnan Province, China.

The $25 million credit approved by EXIM in December 1938 was crucial in ensuring that the supply route remained open by providing the transportation vehicles and support material to operate the new road and by providing China with purchasing power during WWII. An additional $20 million to the Universal Trading Corporation was approved in 1940. A 1939 journal article in Foreign Affairs noted that China used part of the $25 million to purchase 2,000 three-ton trucks from Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors.

=== Post-WWII reconstruction and the Marshall Plan ===
EXIM played a critical role during the years between the end of Lend-Lease (September 1945) and the beginning of the Marshall Plan and the World Bank&#x27;s first authorizations (May 1947 – 1948). At the end of WWII, it was recognized that the U.S. did not have a credit facility capable of handling the demand that would result from the cessation of hostilities. One of the major rationales behind the Export–Import Bank Act of 1945, the basis of EXIM&#x27;s current charter document, was the necessity to dramatically increase EXIM&#x27;s lending capacity to adequately respond to Europe&#x27;s post-war reconstruction needs. The 1945 EXIM Annual Report predicated EXIM&#x27;s role in the immediate post-WWII period: &quot;the Export–Import Bank was to be the principal source of long-term dollar loans for an extended period of time.&quot; This assertion was based on the lack of interest by private capital in lending to foreign government buyers and delays in ratification of the Articles of Agreement for the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Export–Import Bank Act of 1945 increased lending authority from $750 million to $3.5 billion, almost a fourfold increase to help address these shortfalls.

In 1945 and 1946 credit was offered to France, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Italy, Ethiopia, Greece, Poland and Austria to purchase equipment, facilities, and services from the United States. The financing was designed to aid reconstruction of the nations and to repair their import and export capability through the purchase of new machinery, currency exchange, and improvements and repairs to infrastructure and transportation systems.

When the Marshall Plan was initiated in 1948, EXIM concentrated its lending on non-Economic Recovery Act nations in North and South America.

=== First credits to post-Soviet nations ===
When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and the USSR was dissolved in 1991, U.S. companies were able to conduct business freely with Eastern Europe for the first time since the end of WWII. EXIM was one of the first financial institutions to provide financing for exports to the former Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the newly independent nations that emerged after 1991. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush waived the Jackson–Vanik amendment, which had officially blocked normal trade relations with communist countries since 1975. This waiver permitted all E guarantee and insurance programs to U.S. companies wanting to do business with the USSR and several former communist countries.

EXIM resumed business with Czechoslovakia in March 1990. On January 25, 1991, EXIM approved the first transaction to Czechoslovakia since 1947. Financed by First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles, CA, the guarantee allowed Tonak Hat Company to purchase computers from a U.S. company, Digital Equipment Corporation of Massachusetts. Since 1991, EXIM has supported exports to 25 of the nations that emerged after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

=== First credit to India ===
After a visit to India in January 2015, President Obama announced that the EXIM will finance $1 billion of exports of &#x27;Made-in-America&#x27; products, the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation will lend $1 billion to small- and medium-sized rural enterprises and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency will commit $2 billion for renewable energy. Obama and Modi agreed on issues that had previously stopped U.S. companies from establishing nuclear reactors in India.

== Support ==
Supporters say that the bank emphasizes trying to help small and medium size businesses expand their exporting capabilities. CEO and president of the National Association of Manufacturers Jay Timmons stated: &quot;The EXIM plays a critical role in manufacturer&#x27;s ability to export to new markets and keep up with growing global competition. The Bank assists nearly 290,000 export related jobs and each year is helping more and more small and medium-sized manufacturers grow their businesses and hire new workers. More than 85% of all EXIM transactions directly benefit small business exporters—the economic engine that powers our economy and job creation.&quot;

When Obama was campaigning for president in 2008, he stated that the Export–Import Bank had &quot;become little more than a fund for corporate welfare.&quot; During the Bank&#x27;s reauthorization struggle, May 2012, he said that the Export–Import Bank plays a very important role in reaching his goal of doubling exports over 5 years. At the reauthorization ceremony Obama stated: &quot;We&#x27;re helping thousands of businesses sell more of their products and services overseas, in the process, we&#x27;re helping them create jobs here at home. And we&#x27;re doing it at no extra cost to the taxpayer.&quot;
== Criticism ==
=== Special interests-based criticism ===
The Bank has been criticized for favoring special interests. These interests have included corporations such as Boeing or Enron as well as foreign governments and nationals, such as a 1996 $120 million low-interest loan to the China National Nuclear Power Corporation (CNNP) supporting the export of US-made technology.

More recently the bank authorized $33.6 million in loans to Abengoa, a Spanish Green energy company on which former Governor Bill Richardson is a member of the board of directors. As of May 2014, Richardson was also listed as a member of the advisory committee of the Export–Import Bank.

==== Boeing ====
65% of loan guarantees over 2007 and 2008 went to companies purchasing Boeing aircraft. In 2012, the Bank&#x27;s loan guarantees became even more skewed, with 82 percent of them going to Boeing customers.

However, EXIM supporters note that Boeing is the largest exporter in the United States by dollar value, and must be protected in their capacity as the only remaining comprehensive U.S. commercial aircraft manufacturer. Support of Boeing is seen as particularly critical as Comac, China&#x27;s state-owned and heavily subsidized commercial aircraft manufacturer, aggressively seeks to leech market share from both Boeing and Airbus. Also important to note, Boeing is not the only US aircraft manufacturer previously supported by EXIM. During the 1930s, 40s, and 50s, EXIM supported other US aviation manufacturers such as the Douglas Aircraft Company, the Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Company (Convair), and the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.

The cost and effectiveness of the bank are controversial. While the EXIM projects will earn the U.S. government an average of $1.4 billion per year for the next 10 years, an alternative analysis from the Congressional Budget Office found that the program would lose about $2 billion during the same period, partly due to discrepancies in how credit risk is accounted for. Both conservative and liberal groups have been critical of the bank, and some continue to demand its termination.

=== Budget-based criticism ===
Critics also purport the existence of &quot;unseen&quot; costs created by the Export–Import Bank&#x27;s subsidies, including artificially raising the price of new airplanes and potentially adding $2 billion to the deficit over the next decade.

&quot;Forbes&quot; contributor Doug Bandow wrote in 2014, &quot;The agency piously claims not to provide subsidies since it charges fees and interest, but it exists only to offer business a better credit deal than is available in the marketplace. The Bank uses its ability to borrow at government rates to provide loans, loan guarantees, working capital guarantees, and loan insurance.&quot;

If the normal principles of economics or finance are applied, then it is seen by critics as unlikely that the bank has profited and most unlikely that it makes the annual profit that it has stated, because the bank&#x27;s calculations of profit fail to make proper adjustment for risk. Best practice in finance and economics, as well as in banking, is to adjust the cost of capital or discount rate to reflect risk, or, equivalently, to use a fair-value estimate. On this basis the criticism is that &quot;This simple approach—which is based on a method outlined in a National Bureau of Economic Research paper by Debbie Lucas of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology—suggests that the EXIM&#x27;s long-term loan guarantee program actually provides guarantees at a loss for taxpayers, not a profit. Moreover, this analysis reveals that the EXIM&#x27;s loan guarantees are made at sufficiently generous terms that borrowers receive subsidies of about 1% of the amount borrowed. That translates into a $200 million cost for taxpayers on the $21 billion in loans that the bank will make in 2012.&quot;

=== Environment-based criticism ===
In February 2009, the EXIM settled a seven-year-long legal proceeding brought by Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace together with the cities of Boulder, Arcata and Oakland. The plaintiffs said that the EXIM and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation provided financial assistance to oil and other fossil fuel projects without first evaluating the projects&#x27; climate change impacts. In 2005, the plaintiffs were granted legal standing to sue. This is considered a landmark decision because it is the first time that a federal court has specifically granted legal standing for a lawsuit exclusively challenging the federal government&#x27;s failure to evaluate the impacts of its actions on the Earth&#x27;s climate and U.S. citizens. In its settlement agreement, the EXIM agrees to evaluate the carbon dioxide emissions as part of its determination for qualification for a project. However, EXIM fossil fuel financing and associated greenhouse gas emissions grew swiftly after the settlement agreement, coinciding with Chairman Hochberg&#x27;s tenure. Between 2009 and 2012, EXIM fossil fuel financing grew from $2.56 billion to nearly $10 billion.

Environmental groups in 2010 said that the EXIM was on a &quot;fossil fuel binge&quot;, which &quot;makes a mockery&quot; of President Obama&#x27;s stated commitment to phase out fossil fuel subsidies. In December 2009, EXIM Directors approved $3 billion in financing for the ExxonMobil-led Papua New Guinea Liquid Gas project in December 2009. The project has reportedly caused violence and in April 2012, the Papua New Guinea government ordered in troops to quell opposition from villagers after a landslide linked to a quarry that had been used by the project killed an estimated 25 people.

In 2010, environmental groups criticized the EXIM Directors for approving $917 million worth of financing for the 3,960 megawatt coal-fired Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project in India after initially rejecting the project on climate change grounds. Environmental groups say that in reversing the decision the agency&#x27;s Chairman, Fred Hochberg and Board of Directors &quot;caved in&quot; to political pressure from Wisconsin politicians. In 2011, several environmental groups protested at Export–Import Bank headquarters, unsuccessfully urging Chairman Hochberg and Board of Directors to reject $805 million in financing for the 4,800 megawatt Kusile coal-fired power plant in South Africa, which environmental groups say is the largest carbon emitting project in the agency&#x27;s history, which will not alleviate poverty but will emit excessive local air pollution, which health experts say causes damage the respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems and deaths resulting from heart disease, cancer, stroke, and chronic lower respiratory diseases. EXIM&#x27;s 2011 announcement of support for Kusile asserted claims of environmental advancements including that &quot;Kusile will be the first coal-fired power plant in South Africa to include sulfur dioxide scrubbers.&quot; However, in 2023 the South African energy utility Eskom proposed to circumvent the Kusile sulfur dioxide pollution control system, which the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air estimates could result in 680 deaths.

In December 2012, the Center for Biological Diversity, Pacific Environment, and Turtle Island Restoration Network filed a lawsuit against Chairman Hochberg and the EXIM for the agency&#x27;s financing of Australia Pacific LNG&#x27;s liquid natural gas projects inside the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. The lawsuit alleged that EXIM financing for the projects violates U.S. environmental and cultural heritage laws. Their amended lawsuit included EXIM&#x27;s loan for the Australia Pacific LNG project and a $1.8 billion loan for the Queensland Curtis which together totaled $4.8 billion. In March 2016, a California federal judge ruled against the environmentalists arguing that the EXIM financing represented only 10% of the project which is backed by ConocoPhillips, Origin Energy Ltd. and Sinopec and rejecting the loan would not stop the project. The environmentalists appealed the decision.

In 2019 Friends of the Earth (US) criticized EXIM President Kimberly A Reed for supporting the liquid natural gas (LNG) industry despite the lifecycle climate impacts of the fossil fuel, citing the U.S. government&#x27;s Fourth National Climate Assessment finding that more frequent and extreme weather events are severely damaging the environment and the economy, while increasing harm to human health and loss of life. Friends of the Earth (US) also criticized EXIM for approving $5 billion in financing the Mozambique LNG project, citing the project&#x27;s damage to the surrounding ecosystem (including to endangered species), displacement of local communities, and lack of economic benefits for local people.

In May, 2023 EXIM Chair Reta Jo Lewis, Vice Chair Judith Pryor and Director Spencer Bachus voted to approve nearly $100 million in Export-Import Bank financing for an oil refinery expansion project in Indonesia (EXIM Director Owen Herrnstadt abstained). Environmental groups criticize the approval as directly violating President Biden&#x27;s commitments to end overseas fossil fuel financing, including at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference. The approval was also repudiated by the White House National Security Council, which stated the &quot;decision does not reflect administration policy.&quot;

=== Criticism of green energy-based financings ===
Conversely the EXIM has also faced scrutiny for pursuing green energy projects. The EXIM provided $10 million of loan guarantees in 2011 to Solyndra, a company that ultimately became bankrupt.

<doc id="672946" wikidata="Q349653" url="?curid=672946" title="Shar-Kali-Sharri">
<text>Shar-Kali-Sharri (, &quot;DShar-ka-li-Sharri&quot;; died 2193 BC) reigned c. 2218–2193 BC (middle chronology) as the ruler of Akkad. In the early days of cuneiform scholarship the name was transcribed as &quot;Shar-Gani-sharri&quot;. In the 1870s, Assyriologists thought Shar-Kali-Sharri was identical with the Sargon of Akkad, first ruler of the Akkadian Empire, but this identification was recognized as mistaken in the 1910s. His name was sometimes written with the leading Dingir sign demarking deification and sometimes without it. Clearly at some point he was deified and two of his designations marked his divine status, &quot;heroic god of Akkade&quot;, and &quot;god of the land of Warium&quot;. He was the son and successor of Naram-Sin who deified himself during his lifetime.

==Biography==

Shar-Kali-Sharri succeeded his father Naram-Sin around 2218 BC. According to the Sumerian King List, his reign lasted 25 years, which is closely matched by the year name from his rule. He completed the establishment of direct Akkadian rule, a process initiated by his predecessor. It is known, from the seal impressions of three of her majordomos (example - &quot;Sar-kali-sarri, king of the subjects of the god Enlil. Tuta-sar-libbis, the queen: Iskun-Dagan, scr[ibe] and her major[d]omo, (is) [her] servant&quot;), that the wife and queen of Shar-Kali-Shari was Tuta-sar-libbis.

Naram-Sin maintained control over the various city-states by the simple expedient of appointing some of his many sons as key provincial governors, and his daughters as high priestesses. Shar-Kali-Shari would have inherited this system on his ascension but is not known if he had any offspring or, for the most part, the nature of his provincial governors. It has been suggested that he was governor of Nippur before assuming the crown. This is supported by the fact that text show that he was crowned in Nippur, a process that included his sister Tudanapšum who had been named high priestess of Enlil at Nippur.

It was traditional for rulers in Mesopotamia to make an occasional &quot;royal progress&quot; visiting the major cultic sites. One such progress is known from the reign of his father Naram-Sin, fourth ruler of the Akkadian Empire. He was accompanied by three of his children, Bin-kali-šarrē, Tudanapšum, and crown prince Shar-Kali-Shari. It is known that Shar-Kali-Sharri made a royal journey to Sumer early in his reign which lasted at least six months. Cities known to have been included in the royal progress were Umma, Zabala, Isin, Girsu, and Nippur with many royal gifts dispensed and much feasting. In a show of military strength at least five sagina (generals) accompanied Shar-Kali-Shari.
It is known that the governor of Adab under Shar-Kali-Shar was Lugal-gis based on three clay sealings reading &quot;[S]ar-kali-sam, god, hero of Agade: Lugal-gis, scribe and go[vernor] of Ad[ab, (is) his] servant.&quot; (noting that the Dingir followed the rulers name here). His successor as ensi of Adab under Shar-Kali-Shali was Ur-tur, known from tablets found there. Many Adab tablets dated to his reign remain unpublished in the Istanbul Museum. The governor of another city-state, Lagash is known. Lugal-ushumgal, was a governor (ensi) under Naram-Sin and that continued under Shar-Kali-Shari. Several inscriptions of Lugal-ushumgal are known, particularly seal impressions, which refer to him as governor of Lagash and at the time a vassal (, &quot;arad&quot;, &quot;servant&quot; or &quot;slave&quot;) of Naram-Sin, as well as his successor Shar-kali-sharri. One of these seals proclaims:


Lugal-ushumgal was Governor of Lagash, a vassal of Naram-Sin and later of Shar-Kali-Sharri. His successor as governor Puzer-Mama declared himself ruler of Lagash, possibly on the death of Shar-Kali-Shari, and began the 2nd Dynasty of Lagash
One of the primary duties of the ruler of Mesopotamia was the maintenance of the Ekur temple of the chief god Enlil. Work on the temple, initiated by Naram-Sin, was completed by Shar-Kali-Shari. So important was this process that it was featured in seven of his year names, even naming the general appointed to lead the task, Puzur-Eshtar. Inscribed bricks of Shar-Kali-Shari were found during the excavation of Nippur:
In a tablet inscription (HS 195) he also marked, after visiting the source of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, the giving of a cult object to Enlil at Nippur.
Shar-Kali-Shari also built new temples to Annunitum and to Ilaba (the tutelary deity deity of the Akkadian Empire) at Babylon, as reflected in a year name, with a further one to Ilaba at Zabala.
Based on his year names the reign of Shar-Kali-Shari was fairly peaceful with the usual scuffles with nomadic groups like the MAR.TU and the Gutians as well as the traditional butting of heads with the Elamites. The economic texts from that period also would indicate a reasonable degree of prosperity. Clearly the Gutians were growing in influence during his reign as at some point they made Adab their capital, though whether as a vassals of Akkad or not is unknown. That said, there was a historical tradition that the Akkadian Empire began to unravel during his rule. One much later Neo-Babylonian copy of an inscription (BM 38302) of Shar-Kali-Shari (which also marks the building of the temple of Ilaba in Zabala) indicated that he face a widespread revolt at one point which he overcame. This reflects the Great Revolt faced by his father Naram-Sin though it cannot be discounted that passage of millennia had blurred the history of one ruler with the other.
According to the Sumerian King List and later literary compositions, after Shar-Kali-Sharri&#x27;s death in c. 2193 BC, the region fell into anarchy, with no king able to achieve dominance for long. The king list states:

:&quot;Then who was king? Who was not the king? Igigi, Imi, Nanum, Ilulu: four of them ruled for only 3 years.&quot;

Akkad then resumed some resemblance of order for a time with the 21-year reign of Dudu followed by the 15-year reign of Shu-turul.

==Year names of Shar-Kali-Sharri==
Lists of year names can be found for many rulers from the time of the Akkadian Empire, including Shar-Kali-Sharri. They shed light on the length of his reign and the main events:

<text>The Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Act 1998 (previously bill no. 1 of 1998) is an amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which permitted the state to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam. It was approved by referendum on 22 May 1998 and signed into law on the 3 June of the same year. The referendum was held on the same day as the referendum on Nineteenth Amendment, which related to approval of the Good Friday Agreement.

==Background==
The Amsterdam Treaty was signed on 2 October 1997 by the member states of the European Union, amending provisions of the Maastricht Treaty (which had been approved by the Eleventh Amendment in 1992) and the Rome Treaty (which had been approved by the Third Amendment in 1972). Following the Supreme Court decision of &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot; (1987), a constitutional amendment was required before the state could ratify the Treaty. The Treaty of Amsterdam contained a number of optional protocols that member-states could activate at a later time after its adoption. The Eighteenth Amendment permitted the Republic to choose to exercise these options, provided it had the support of the Oireachtas (parliament).

==Changes to the text==
The following subsections were inserted after Article 29.4.4°:
The existing subsections 5° and 6° of Article 29.4 were renumbered as subsections 7° and 8° respectively.

==Oireachtas debates==
The Eighteenth Amendment was proposed by Minister for Foreign Affairs David Andrews on behalf of the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government led by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. It was also supported by Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left, while it was opposed by the Green Party, Sinn Féin and the Socialist Party. It passed final stages in the Dáil on 26 March 1998. It passed final stages in the Seanad on and proceeded to a referendum on 22 May 1998.

==Campaign==
A Referendum Commission was established by Minister for the Environment and Local Government Noel Dempsey. This was the first referendum at which a Referendum Commission was established. It was chaired by former Chief Justice Thomas Finlay. At the time, its role included setting out the arguments for and against the proposal.

==Result==


==Aftermath==
The European Communities (Amendment) Act 1998 amended the European Communities Act 1972 to provide a statutory basis for decisions under the Amsterdam Treaty. The Treaty took effect across the European Union on 1 May 1999.

<text>The Twentieth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2001 is an amendment to the Constitution of Ireland which provided constitutional recognition of local government and required that local government elections occur at least once in every five years. It was approved by referendum on 11 June 1999 and signed into law on 23 June of the same year. The referendum was held the same day as the local and European Parliament elections.

==Background==
The structure of local government in Ireland dates back to the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, subject to amendments since then. There was no reference to local government in the Constitution as adopted in 1937. Local elections were held at irregular intervals: the local elections held previous to the adoption of the Amendment were in 1991, 1985 and 1979. Constitutional recognition of local government was proposed by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, including a requirement to hold regular election.

==Changes to the text==
Insertion of a new Article:
==Oireachtas debate==
The Amendment was sponsored by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and was proposed in the Dáil on 11 May 1999 by Minister of State Dan Wallace on behalf of the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government led by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. It was passed final stages in the Dáil on 12 May where it was opposed by opposition parties Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party, the Socialist Party and Independent Tony Gregory. Their opposition was to elements of the drafting rather than the principle of constitutional recognition of local government. It passed final stages in the Seanad on the same day, and proceeded to a referendum on 11 June 1999.

==Campaign==
A Referendum Commission was established by Minister for the Environment and Local Government Noel Dempsey. At the time, its role included setting out the arguments for and against the proposal.

==Result==

Note: For this referendum, the constituencies used were each county and city, which were deemed to be constituencies for the purpose of the poll. Usually in Irish referendums the general election constituencies are used.

<doc id="672959" wikidata="Q654036" url="?curid=672959" title="Jesse Carver">
<text>Jesse Carver (7 July 1911 – 29 November 2003) was an English football player and manager, best remembered for his management of some of Europe&#x27;s finest clubs.

==Club career==
Carver started out in football as a player, joining Blackburn Rovers as an 18-year-old groundstaff boy and spent seven years at Ewood Park, becoming the first choice centre-half in 1931, playing almost 150 games for the First Division side. Although under six foot and short for a stopper his strong tackling and intelligent reading of the game more than made up for his lack of inches. In 1936, he joined Newcastle United for £2,000, making his debut against Barnsley in August, and with Carver playing the Toon&#x27;s highest finish was 4th in the Second Division. After playing 70 times in the league and six in the FA Cup between 1936 and 1939 for Newcastle United, Carver&#x27;s playing career was cut short by the Second World War. During the war years, he worked as a policeman.

==Managerial career==
After the war, Carver became assistant trainer at Huddersfield, and he began to realise that he had more talent as a coach than as a player. He successfully applied to coach Dutch club Xerxes in Rotterdam. He built his training routines around using the ball, instead of boring repetitive lapping, Xerxes flourished, and heading the championship and he was asked to coach the national team, a position he held for two years.

After one season coaching at Millwall, he was appointed trainer to the England &#x27;B&#x27; team on the successful 1949 tour of Holland and Finland. A job at the FA looked likely, but as the FA hesitated, Juventus jumped in and offered him the coach&#x27;s job. He led Juve to the championship in his first season at the club.

Carver still wanted to prove himself in England, however, and in the summer of 1952, he was persuaded to return to coach West Brom. He had an immediate impact, with the team playing attacking football and up among the league leaders. Carver left late January 1954, as he wasn&#x27;t appointed manager, despite his success, leaving the job to his assistant Vic Buckingham. Torino lured him back to Italy, and he ultimately saved the club from relegation.

He only stayed at Torino a year, before moving to Roma. His salary at Roma was £5,000; he and his wife had an apartment in the Via Archemedes, where his neighbours included ex-King Farouk and Ingrid Bergman. Several English First Division clubs coveted him, but in early 1955, Coventry City tempted him with a salary close to £100 per week (at a time when most players were earning £15). But perhaps the challenge at Coventry was more compelling, than the lure of the cheque book.
Football writer Brian Glanville who was close to Jesse in Italy, revealed in recent years, that months after accepting the Coventry job, Carver was offered the England manager&#x27;s job but turned it down because he had given his word to City chairman Erle Shanks. The FA were prepared to sack Walter Winterbottom to make the position his.

Carver arrived in Coventry with a tan that complemented his man-about-town personality, and with his tailored light grey suits and camel coat, he looked more like a Hollywood film mogul than a football manager. He warned supporters not too expect too much but his words went unheeded – promotion talk was, as always, in the air.

His innovations were far-reaching, from wooden shoes and bathrobes for the players to prevent them catching cold whilst getting out of the showers, to made-to-measure lightweight continental boots for all the players. He also bought 40 footballs, one for each player on the staff as he expected them to practice their ball skills at all times.

He also brought over from Italy former Swedish national coach George Raynor as his number two, another man with an outstanding reputation on the continent.

Over 24,000 fans were at the opening day win over Bournemouth, and the football was slick and exciting. At home, Carver&#x27;s team were unbeatable, but away from home, they struggled for results and promotion hopes looked slim. Throughout the autumn, rumours persisted of a move back to Italy, but these were quashed by chairman Shanks.

By now, it had become apparent that Carver and Raynor&#x27;s continental style was not quite enough to win promotion amidst the hurly-burly of the Third Division, and Carver re-shaped his approach. In December, he bought Ken McPherson from Middlesbrough, a big bustling centre-forward, and the team won five games on the trot, culminating in a 5–1 thrashing of Millwall in front of a crowd of 30,000.

But there was another major story brewing. Behind the scenes, Carver had made it clear to Shanks – he wanted to leave. The Midlands didn&#x27;t suit his wife&#x27;s health and he made an urgent request to be released from his three-year contract. The board reluctantly agreed and Carver left the club on New Year&#x27;s Eve. City released him on the understanding that he didn&#x27;t work in England during the remaining period of his Coventry contract. He denied that there were any other offers for his services, but within hours of him returning to Italy, on 3 January Lazio announced he would be their new manager.

He led Lazio from 13th place to fourth place in the second half of the 1955–56 Serie A season. In 1956–57, he finished third.

He did return to a coaching job at Tottenham Hotspur in 1958, but failed to settle; later, he moved to Portugal. After a spell in the US, he retired to England in the 1970s.

He died on 29 November 2003, in Bournemouth.

<text>Monopolowa, originally a Polish brand, is a vodka made in Austria by Gessler. It is distilled from potatoes and is marketed under the brand name of J. A. Baczewski.

== History ==

&quot;Monopolowa&quot; means &quot;under monopoly&quot;, in this case referring to a privilege given to the &quot;szlachta&quot; (nobility) in Poland, giving them exclusive rights to produce and sell vodka in their territories. 

Monopolowa was produced by J. A. Baczewski, a distillery founded by Jewish merchant, Lejb Beczeles, from 1782 until World War II. After the war, Gessler, an Austrian company, bought the licence and the rights to production. In 1990, the Starogard Gdański based branch of Polmos, a privatized offshoot of the former state-owned monopoly, started to produce several of J.A. Baczewski&#x27;s products under license from Altvater Gessler - J.A. Baczewski International (USA) Inc. However, in the late 1990s, that license was terminated and production in Poland was halted.

<doc id="672964" wikidata="Q341219" url="?curid=672964" title="Achzarit">
<text>The Achzarit ( in Hebrew: &quot;cruel&quot;, feminine inflection) is a heavily armored personnel carrier manufactured by the Israeli Defence Forces Corps of Ordnance.

==History==
The Achzarit is based on the Soviet-built T-54/T-55 tank, beginning with those captured from Arab armies during the Arab–Israeli wars. To make space for a troop compartment, the eight-and-a-half tonnes turret, the original superstructure of the chassis and the transversely mounted engine were removed. 
Non-Explosive Reactive Armour was installed over the original hull. The first model of the Achzarit entered in service in 1988.

==Design==
===Protection===
The Achzarit can withstand both shaped-charges and armor-piercing projectiles which would destroy conventional IFVs. The manufacturers claim that the machine can withstand repeated 125 mm APFSDS hits over its frontal arc. At 44 tonnes, the machine is exceptionally heavy for an infantry carrier. The fact that 14 tonnes of the vehicle&#x27;s weight is made up of additional advanced special composite armor, gives some indication as to its high degree of protection.

===Weapons===
It is armed with three 7.62 mm machine guns, including one Rafael Overhead Weapons Station, a machine gun controlled from within the cabin, developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. As a lesson from the Second Intifada, a ballistic glass turret was installed over one of the hatches to enable the commander to see outside without being exposed to small arms fire and shrapnel.

Several Achzarit in service have been upgraded with a 12.7 mm Samson Remote Controlled Weapon Station in place of the standard 7.62 mm Rafael Overhead Weapon Station.

A version with RCWS-30 was also built.

==Operations==
Because of its heavy armor, the Achzarit is sometimes called a Heavy APC (HAPC).

Achzarit APCs took part in Operation Rainbow in Rafah, after a comparatively lightly armored M113 APC was destroyed by an RPG. Achzarit APCs were also involved in the Gaza War (2008–09).

On October 7, 2023, several old APCs were captured by Palestinian militants in Nahal Oz.

<doc id="672965" wikidata="Q756462" url="?curid=672965" title="Atlantic Sun Conference">
<text>The Atlantic Sun Conference (ASUN) is a collegiate athletic conference operating mostly in the Southeastern United States. The league participates at the NCAA Division I level, and began sponsoring football at the Division I FCS level in 2022. Originally established as the Trans America Athletic Conference (TAAC) in 1978, it was renamed as the Atlantic Sun Conference in 2001, and briefly rebranded as the ASUN Conference from 2016 to 2023. The conference still uses &quot;ASUN&quot; as an official abbreviation. The conference headquarters are located in Jacksonville.

==History==
=== Formation ===
The conference was first formed on September 19, 1978, as the Trans America Athletic Conference, at the Dallas–Fort Worth Regional Airport Marina Hotel. Its charter members were Oklahoma City University, Pan American University (later renamed University of Texas-Pan American), Northeast Louisiana University (now known as the University of Louisiana at Monroe), Houston Baptist University (now Houston Christian University), Hardin-Simmons University, Centenary College of Louisiana, Samford University, and Mercer University, all of whom were previously D-I independents. None of the eight charter members remain in the conference today.

Almost immediately after its formation, the conference experienced a shake-up in its membership. Oklahoma City departed to become a charter member of the Midwestern City Conference (known today as the Horizon League), while UTPA returned to D-I independent status—both had only played a single season in the infant league. The TAAC was quick to replace the outgoing members with Northwestern State University and the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, along with Georgia Southern University in 1980, but this instability would prove to be a trend through the coming years—over the next 20 years, the conference would accept 16 new members, with many of these leaving after only playing a handful of seasons. 1982 saw the departure of another charter member, Northeast Louisiana, to the Southland Conference. Additionally, it saw the arrival of Nicholls State University, who originally planned to join the TAAC as a full member. However, due to an oversight by the NCAA, adding in a new program who had not competed in Division I for at least five years would result in the offending conference forfeiting their automatic bid to the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament. To get around this, the TAAC announced that Nicholls State would compete as a provisional member, ineligible for the men&#x27;s basketball tournament until it completed its D-I transition in 1985. However, it, along with Northwestern State, left the conference in 1984 to join the Gulf Star Conference instead.

=== Expansion, contraction, and rebranding ===
The remainder of the 1980s saw mostly growth for the conference, adding Georgia State University in 1983, Stetson University in 1985, and the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1986. However, near the end of the decade, the conference was hit with 5 departures over 4 consecutive years, beginning with Houston Baptist transitioning to the NAIA in 1989. This was followed by Hardin-Simmons dropping to NCAA Division III in 1990, UTSA and Arkansas–Little Rock leaving for the Southland and Sun Belt conferences in 1991, respectively, and Georgia Southern leaving for the Southern Conference in 1992. In the midst of this, the conference began to relentlessly pursue expansion throughout the 1990s to offset these losses, adding Florida International University in 1990, Southeastern Louisiana University and the College of Charleston in 1991, the University of Central Florida in 1992, Florida Atlantic University in 1993, Campbell University in 1994, Jacksonville State University in 1995, Troy State University in 1997, and Jacksonville University in 1998. Of these 9 schools, though, only 2 ended up staying with the conference for longer than 15 years.

The turn of the millennium saw another charter member in Centenary depart in 1999 for the Mid-Continent Conference (now the Summit League); the league was able to offset this with the addition of Belmont University in 2001. Around this same time, the conference sought to rebrand itself, changing its name from the Trans America Athletic Conference to the Atlantic Sun Conference. The newly rebranded A-Sun continued to expand into the 2000s, adding Gardner–Webb University in 2002, Lipscomb University in 2003, East Tennessee State University, Kennesaw State University, and the University of North Florida in 2005, and Florida Gulf Coast University &amp; the University of South Carolina Upstate in 2007. It also lost its fair share of members as well—largely some of the aforementioned members that had been added during the &#x27;90s, such as FIU, Florida Atlantic, and Troy to the Sun Belt, Georgia State to the Colonial Athletic Association, and UCF to Conference USA, but it also saw the departure of Samford to the Ohio Valley Conference, leaving Mercer as the only remaining charter member.

=== Present ===
The start of the 2010s gave the A-Sun a bit of a reprieve from conference realignment, losing only Campbell and Belmont in 2011 and 2012 to the Big South and OVC, respectively, and only adding recent D-I upgrader Northern Kentucky University in 2012. 2014 saw the departure of its final charter member, Mercer, to the Southern Conference in 2014; however, the Bears continued to compete in the ASUN as an affiliate for beach volleyball and added men&#x27;s lacrosse to its ASUN membership in 2022. The ASUN continued to expand and contract slowly through the mid-2010s, losing only Northern Kentucky and East Tennessee State (along with Mercer), and only adding the New Jersey Institute of Technology in 2015.

This slow pace didn&#x27;t stay for long, however. The second half of the decade saw the conference rebranding a second time, to simply the ASUN Conference Two years later, the University of North Alabama arrived from the Division II Gulf South Conference, and Liberty University left the Big South for the ASUN. More recently, Bellarmine University joined from the Division II Great Lakes Valley Conference and NJIT left for the America East Conference in 2020–21. On July 1, 2024, the University of West Georgia joined from the Division II Gulf South Conference.

====Failed CCSA merger====
On January 22, 2020, it was announced that the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association and the ASUN would merge to create a new Division I multisport conference. The timeline below was released with the announcement of this merger and expansion plan:

*June, 2023 – ASUN Conference expands to 20 members.
*Before July 1, 2023 – ASUN transfers rights to the ASUN name and marks to the CCSA.
*July 1, 2023 – ASUN 7 joins the CCSA. The CCSA adopts the ASUN name as a multisport conference. The 13 remaining members would adopt the name United Athletic Conference.

The ASUN had planned on expanding to 20 members and then splitting the conference similar to how the Original Big East Conference was split in 2013 into the American Athletic Conference and the New Big East Conference. The new ASUN Conference governed by the CCSA would have made up of the ASUN 7 including all of the members that would have been in the ASUN Conference for at least 8 years to meet the requirements for a new multisport conference. The members would have included Florida Gulf Coast University, Jacksonville University, Kennesaw State University, Lipscomb University, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University of North Florida, and Stetson University. The United Athletic Conference (not to be confused with the United Athletic Conference, the football merger between the Western Athletic Conference and the ASUN in 2023) governed by the original ASUN Conference would have included Bellarmine University, Liberty University, University of North Alabama, and ten other undisclosed schools that would have joined through expansion.

On November 16, 2020, The ASUN Conference announced that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the quickly changing landscape in conference realignment, the creation of a new multisport conference would not be possible at the time of the release or with the aforementioned timeline. This comes after the news that NJIT would be leaving the ASUN for the America East Conference in 2021, weakening the ASUN 7 and lowering the chances that a new conference would be created with only six members.

====Addition of football====
Arguably its biggest move in recent years was the announcement that the conference would be adding the University of Central Arkansas, Eastern Kentucky University, and former member Jacksonville State University, as incoming members on January 29, 2021, with the intent of sponsoring football in the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) in 2022. However, with these three schools joining in 2021, the league partnered with another conference beginning to sponsor football also in 2022, the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), to allow the three teams to join the WAC as football affiliates for 2021, branding it interchangeably as the &quot;ASUN–WAC Challenge&quot; and &quot;WAC–ASUN Challenge&quot;; the two leagues will receive a combined bid to the FCS playoffs.

As soon as it was announced, however, the football league was thrown into jeopardy, as Jacksonville State announced it would be leaving once again in 2023 for Conference USA (C-USA), an FBS conference. Liberty was also invited to C-USA for 2023, but had already competed as an FBS independent for some time and was not included in the ASUN&#x27;s new football league. With the WAC also losing Sam Houston, another football-sponsoring school, to C-USA, the two conferences announced they would be renewing their alliance for the 2022 season. On September 17, 2021, the ASUN announced Austin Peay State University, a football-sponsoring school, as a new member for the 2022–23 season. In May 2022, local media in Charlotte, North Carolina, also reported that Queens University of Charlotte would start a transition from the Division II South Atlantic Conference as a new ASUN member, also effective on July 1 of that year. The ASUN officially announced this move on May 10.

The ASUN also expanded its associate membership in the 2020s. The conference started the decade with five associate members—Coastal Carolina in both beach volleyball and women&#x27;s lacrosse, Mercer in beach volleyball only, and Akron, Kent State, and Howard in women&#x27;s lacrosse. All of the women&#x27;s lacrosse associates left by the 2021–22 school year. Akron and Kent State left after the 2020 season when their full-time home of the Mid-American Conference began sponsoring the sport. Coastal Carolina also left after the 2020 season for the SoCon. Howard moved several sports not sponsored by its full-time home of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference to the Northeast Conference, with women&#x27;s lacrosse moving after the 2021 season. Coastal Carolina moved beach volleyball to C-USA after the 2020–21 school year.

However, the 2021–22 school year saw the arrival of eight new associates, as well as the return of former women&#x27;s lacrosse associates Coastal Carolina and Delaware State for that sport. ASUN beach volleyball added Charleston, Stephen F. Austin, and UNC Wilmington. The largest change in associate membership involved the relaunch of ASUN men&#x27;s lacrosse. Full member Bellarmine was joined by five new associates—Air Force, Cleveland State, Detroit Mercy, Robert Morris, and Utah.

The ASUN lost five beach volleyball members for 2022–23. The conference&#x27;s four associates in that sport left for the Sun Belt Conference (SBC), which added that sport. Charleston, Stephen F. Austin, and UNC Wilmington all left the ASUN after a single season and Mercer also moved beach volleyball to the SBC. Also, departing full member Jacksonville State moved beach volleyball to its future home of C-USA a year before its all-sports move to that league.

Also for 2022–23, Mercer moved men&#x27;s lacrosse into the ASUN after the SoCon shut down its men&#x27;s lacrosse league, and new D-I member Lindenwood became an associate in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse.

On October 14, 2022, Conference USA and Kennesaw State jointly announced that KSU would start a transition to FBS after the 2022 football season and join C-USA in 2024.

ESPN reported on December 9, 2022, that the ASUN and WAC had agreed to form a new football-only conference that plans to start play in 2024. The initial membership would consist of Austin Peay, Central Arkansas, Eastern Kentucky, and North Alabama from the ASUN, and Abilene Christian, Southern Utah, Stephen F. Austin, Tarleton, and Utah Tech from the WAC. UTRGV would become the 10th member upon its planned addition of football in 2025. The new football conference also reportedly plans to move &quot;from what is currently known as FCS football to what is currently known as FBS football at the earliest practicable date.&quot; On December 20, the two conferences confirmed the football merger, announcing that the new football league would start play in 2023 under the tentative name of ASUN–WAC Football Conference. This was followed in April 2023 by the new league rebranding itself as the United Athletic Conference (UAC). The UAC is playing a six-game schedule, and initially planned to start full round-robin conference play in 2024, although this is likely to change with two schools joining by 2025. Neither conference&#x27;s announcement mentioned any plans to move to FBS.

====Return of Atlantic Sun====
On September 1, 2023, it was announced that the ASUN would undergo another rebranding to reinstate the use of the name Atlantic Sun. The conference still uses &quot;ASUN&quot; as its official abbreviation.

==== Addition of swimming and diving ====
The ASUN added men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving for the 2023–24 season, taking most of its initial membership from the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association, which had been founded as a partnership of several all-sports conferences, including the ASUN, as a home for that sport (the CCSA&#x27;s scope would later expand to include beach volleyball). Two associate members came from the American Athletic Conference, which dropped men&#x27;s swimming as a sponsored sport after the 2022–23 season. The initial membership for that sport was:
* Two full members, Bellarmine and Queens, compete in both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s leagues.
* Two other full members, Florida Gulf Coast and North Florida, sponsor only the women&#x27;s sport.
* The two full men&#x27;s members were joined by associate members Florida Atlantic, Gardner–Webb, Old Dominion, and SMU. SMU only competed in the 2023–24 season, after which it joined the Atlantic Coast Conference, which sponsors the sport for both sexes.
* Gardner–Webb is also an associate in women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving; it was joined in that status by former full ASUN member Liberty and UNC Asheville.

* Northeast Louisiana became the University of Louisiana at Monroe (Louisiana–Monroe) in 1999.
* Pan American, later known as Texas–Pan American or UTPA, merged with the University of Texas at Brownsville in 2015 to create the new University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV). The new school inherited UTPA&#x27;s athletic program.

==Sports sponsored==
As of the 2023–24 school year, the ASUN sponsors championship competition in 10 men&#x27;s and 12 women&#x27;s NCAA sanctioned sports.

In 2008, the ASUN, in an agreement with the Southern Conference (SoCon), Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), and Big South Conference, formed the Coastal Collegiate Swimming Association (CCSA) for schools sponsoring men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming and diving within the associated conferences. For the past several years, the ASUN&#x27;s Commissioner has served as the president of what was initially a swimming &amp; diving-only conference. In 2014 the CCSA expanded to include several other schools from other conferences, and the following year the conference added beach volleyball (women-only at the NCAA level) as a sponsored sport, changing its name to the Coastal Collegiate Sports Association. Currently the conference has 17 member schools, with five men&#x27;s swimming and diving teams, nine women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving teams, and six beach volleyball teams. 
A more recent change to the roster of ASUN sports took place after the 2013–14 school year. Under a cooperative agreement between the ASUN and SoCon, the two leagues agreed to split lacrosse sponsorship. The SoCon took over the ASUN men&#x27;s lacrosse league, while women&#x27;s lacrosse sponsorship remained with the ASUN. The full alliance in women&#x27;s lacrosse amicably ended after the 2017 season, with the SoCon sponsoring that sport from the 2018 season forward, but the two leagues continued in a cross-scheduling agreement until the SoCon dropped women&#x27;s lacrosse after the 2021 season.

Still more recently, on September 13, 2016, the ASUN and Big South announced a football partnership that allows any ASUN members with scholarship football programs to become Big South football members, provided they are located within the general geographic footprint of the two conferences. At the time of announcement, the only ASUN member with a scholarship football program, Kennesaw State, was already a Big South football member. Should any ASUN member add scholarship football, or any non-scholarship football program of an ASUN school (at the time of announcement, Jacksonville and Stetson) upgrade to scholarship football, that team will automatically join Big South football. North Alabama joined Big South football under the terms of this agreement; although the school&#x27;s home state of Alabama had no schools in either conference at the time it was announced as a future ASUN member, three of its neighboring states were home to six of the ASUN&#x27;s eight members at that time.

When the ASUN announced the July 2021 entry of Central Arkansas, Eastern Kentucky, and Jacksonville State, it also stated that it would launch a scholarship FCS football league, but did not specify when football competition will begin. No current member is required to add football or change its current football standing. At a press conference on February 23, 2021, the ASUN announced that it had entered into a separate football partnership with the Western Athletic Conference (WAC), which had previously announced the relaunch of its football league at the FCS level in fall 2021 with the arrival of four new FCS member schools. The three incoming ASUN members joined the four incoming WAC members in a round-robin schedule branded as the &quot;ASUN–WAC Challenge&quot;. Both conferences proposed an amendment to NCAA bylaws that would allow the alliance to receive an automatic bid to the FCS playoffs. The alliance had seven members, one more than the six normally required for an automatic bid, but were not in the same league for an adequate period to meet the current NCAA &quot;continuity&quot; requirement. The two leagues&#x27; proposal was successful, resulting in an automatic qualifier from the seven-team Challenge, colloquially dubbed &quot;AQ7&quot;. With the 2022 arrival of Austin Peay providing the ASUN its sixth scholarship FCS program, the ASUN will start its football league in the 2022 season. However, because the ASUN and WAC were each left with only five playoff-eligible football members for 2022 after Jacksonville State (ASUN) and Sam Houston (WAC) started FBS transitions in that season, both leagues renewed their football partnership for 2022. As noted earlier, the two conferences fully merged their football leagues in 2023 as the United Athletic Conference.

Shortly after the addition of football was announced, the ASUN announced that it would reinstate men&#x27;s lacrosse in the 2022 season, with the lacrosse partnership with the SoCon retained for the time being. The two full ASUN members with men&#x27;s lacrosse programs, Bellarmine and Jacksonville, separated for that sport, with Bellarmine joining the new ASUN lacrosse league and Jacksonville remaining in SoCon men&#x27;s lacrosse. Air Force moved from SoCon men&#x27;s lacrosse; men&#x27;s lacrosse independent Utah joined; and all three Horizon League members with men&#x27;s lacrosse programs also joined, with Detroit Mercy moving from the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference and Cleveland State and Robert Morris moving from independent status. The SoCon maintained its automatic NCAA tournament berth by adding another lacrosse independent, Hampton. The ASUN men&#x27;s lacrosse league was initially to be administered through the CCSA while operating under the ASUN name as part of the ASUN&#x27;s intended plan to split into two conferences. This arrangement was scrapped along with the planned conference split once NJIT left for the America East; the men&#x27;s lacrosse league is now directly administered by the ASUN.

The ASUN added two new beach volleyball members, Charleston and UNCW, in July 2021. At the same time, Coastal Carolina left ASUN beach volleyball for the newly formed Conference USA beach volleyball league. With the demise of SoCon women&#x27;s lacrosse after the 2021 season, Coastal Carolina and Delaware State returned to the ASUN in that sport after respectively spending one and four seasons in the SoCon.

The SoCon dropped men&#x27;s lacrosse after the 2022 season due to further conference realignment. Jacksonville returned men&#x27;s lacrosse to the ASUN, and full SoCon member Mercer became an ASUN men&#x27;s lacrosse affiliate. Lindenwood, which started a transition from D-II to D-I in 2022 as a new member of the Ohio Valley Conference, became an affiliate in both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse (neither of which is sponsored by the OVC). Also in 2022–23, the ASUN lost all four of its beach volleyball affiliates (Charleston, Mercer, Stephen F. Austin, UNCW) to the new beach volleyball league of the Sun Belt Conference.

As noted previously, the ASUN added men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving in 2023–24.

===Men&#x27;s sports===
Men&#x27;s varsity sports not sponsored by the league which are played by ASUN schools:&lt;br&gt;

In addition to the aforementioned sports:
* Queens sponsors men&#x27;s rugby and triathlon, neither of which has NCAA recognition of any type. It also considers its male cheerleaders to be varsity athletes.

===Women&#x27;s sports===

Women&#x27;s varsity sports not sponsored by the league which are played by ASUN schools:&lt;br&gt;

In addition to the aforementioned sports:
* Bellarmine considers the members of its all-female dance team to be varsity athletes.

<doc id="672968" wikidata="Q7857743" url="?curid=672968" title="Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Twenty-first Amendment of the Constitution Act 2001 (previously bill no. 16 of 2001) is an amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which introduced a constitutional ban on the death penalty and removed all references to capital punishment from the text. It was approved by referendum on 7 June 2001 and signed into law on 27 March 2002. The referendum was held on the same day as referendums on the ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, which was also approved, and on the ratification of the Nice Treaty, which was rejected.

==Background==

Capital punishment in Ireland had been abolished by the Criminal Justice Act 1990. The purpose of the amendment was therefore not to end the practice, but rather to forbid the Oireachtas from reintroducing the death penalty in future, even during a state of emergency. This is the only explicit exception to the sweeping powers otherwise granted to the state during such an emergency.

The last execution in Ireland occurred in 1954 when the murderer Michael Manning was hanged, the sentence being carried out by Albert Pierrepoint who travelled from Great Britain where he was an official hangman. The penalty has been abolished in law since 1990. It is furthermore a condition of the membership of any country of the European Union that it abolish capital punishment. Ireland is also party to a number of international agreements forbidding the death penalty. These include Protocol No. 13 to the European Convention on Human Rights which forbids capital punishment even during time of war.

==Changes to the text==
Article 15.5 to be renumbered as 15.5.1° and the insertion of a new subsection to Article 15.5:
Addition of the highlighted text to the first sentence of Article 28.3.3°:
Deletion of the highlighted text from Article 13.6:
Deletion of the following subsection from Article 40.4:
Subsections 6° and 7° of Article 40.4 renumbered as subsections 5° and 6° respectively.

==Oireachtas debate==
The Twenty-first Amendment was proposed in Dáil Éireann by Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform John O&#x27;Donoghue on 11 April 2001 on behalf of the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government led by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. One member spoke against, Fine Gael TD Brendan McGahon; otherwise, it had the support of all members of the Dáil. It passed final stages without amendment on the same day. It passed all stages in Seanad Éireann on 1 May, and proceeded to a referendum on 7 June 2001.

==Campaign==
A Referendum Commission was established by Minister for the Environment and Local Government Noel Dempsey. It was chaired by former Chief Justice Thomas Finlay. At the time, its role included setting out the arguments for and against the proposal.

==Result==
The Twenty-first Amendment was approved on a low turnout (34%), by 62% in favour to 38% against. There were media reports after the referendum on the Twenty-first Amendment that opponents of the death penalty had mistakenly cast a &quot;no&quot; vote, in the belief that they were being asked to vote on capital punishment &quot;per se&quot; rather than on an amendment that would prohibit it.

<doc id="672970" wikidata="Q15070130" url="?curid=672970" title="John Pardoe">
<text>John Wentworth Pardoe (born 27 July 1934) is a British retired businessman and Liberal Party politician. He was Chairman of Sight and Sound Education Ltd from 1979 to 1989.

==Early life and education==
Pardoe was the son of Cuthbert B. Pardoe and Marjorie E. W. (&quot;née&quot; Taylor). He attended King&#x27;s College School, Cambridge, and was a chorister in the Choir of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He then went to Sherborne School, a boarding independent school for boys in the market town of Sherborne in Dorset, followed by Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. He was active in the famous Footlights drama club; one critic of their 1955 revue panned future comedian Jonathan Miller, whilst predicting a bold comedic future for Pardoe. He gained an MA at Cambridge.

== Early career ==
Pardoe worked for Television Audience Measurement Ltd from 1958 to 1960, Osborne Peacock Co. Ltd from 1960 to 1961 and &quot;Liberal News&quot; from 1961 to 1966.

==Political career==
In the 1964 general election, Pardoe unsuccessfully stood as the Liberal candidate against Margaret Thatcher in Finchley. In the 1966 election, the Liberal Party increased its number of MPs from nine to twelve: one of them was Pardoe, who captured the North Cornwall seat from the Conservative Party&#x27;s James Scott-Hopkins. He rapidly became the party&#x27;s Economic Affairs spokesman in parliament and was respected for the intellect of his views, if not for the often partisan nature of his comments. Pardoe was Treasurer of the Liberal Party from 1968 to 1969.

In the 1960s, Pardoe was a member of Mebyon Kernow as well as the Liberal Party.

In 1976, after the resignation of Jeremy Thorpe, Pardoe was a candidate for the leadership of the Liberal Party. He lost to David Steel, who received 12,541 votes to Pardoe&#x27;s 7,032.

Pardoe played the fairy-tale Liberal prime minister in BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Christmas pantomime, &quot;Black Cinderella Two Goes East&quot; in 1978, on the basis that Liberal prime ministers exist only in fairy tales.

At the 1979 general election, he lost his seat, possibly because of his outspoken support for neighbouring MP Jeremy Thorpe, who was then about to stand trial at the Old Bailey for conspiracy and incitement to murder.

At the general election of 1987, Pardoe served as campaign manager of the SDP-Liberal Alliance.

== Outside politics ==
From 1967 to 1973, Pardoe was a consultant to the National Association of Schoolmasters. He was a director at William Schlackman Ltd from 1968 to 1971, Gerald Metals (1972–83) and a Member of the London Metal Exchange from 1973 to 1983.

Pardoe was a presenter of LWT&#x27;s &quot;Look Here&quot; television programme from 1979 to 1981. In the same period, he was also a Senior Research Fellow at the Policy Studies Institute. From 1985 to 1989, he was a member of the Youth Training Board.

== Personal life ==
In 1958, Pardoe married Joyce R. Peerman; the couple have two sons and a daughter. Pardoe lives in Hampstead, north west London.

His recreations are walking, reading, music and carpentry.

<doc id="672976" wikidata="Q16632373" url="?curid=672976" title="Igigi">
<text>Igigi are the mythological figures of heaven in the mythology of Mesopotamia. Though sometimes synonymous with the term &quot;Anunnaki&quot;, in the Atrahasis myth the Igigi were the younger beings who were servants of the Annunaki, until they rebelled and were replaced by the creation of humans.

==Etymology==
The name has unknown origin. It was originally spelt i-gi4-gi4, but was later also written as í-gì-gì. This latter may have been a play on words, as in Sumerian, the combination can be interpreted as numerals adding to 7 (the number of Great Gods), or multiplying to 600 (which in some traditions was the total number of gods).

== &quot;Atrahasis&quot; ==
Akkadian Paradise is described as a garden in the myth of &quot;Atrahasis&quot; where lower rank deities (the Igigi) are put to work digging a watercourse by the more senior deities (the Anunnaki).

:When the gods, man-like,
:Bore the labour, carried the load,
:The gods&#x27; load was great,
:The toil grievous, the trouble excessive.
:The great Anunnaku, the Seven,
:Were making the Igigu undertake the toil.

The Igigi then rebel against the dictatorship of Enlil, setting fire to their tools and surrounding Enlil&#x27;s great house by night. On hearing that toil on the irrigation channel is the reason for the disquiet, the Anunnaki council decide to create man to carry out agricultural labour.

<text>The Zeppelin NT (&quot;Neue Technologie&quot;, German for &quot;new technology&quot;) is a class of helium-filled airships being manufactured since the 1990s by the German company Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH (ZLT) in Friedrichshafen. The initial model is the N07. The company considers itself the successor of the companies founded by Ferdinand von Zeppelin which constructed and operated the very successful Zeppelin airships in the first third of the 20th century. There are, however, a number of notable differences between the Zeppelin NT and original Zeppelins as well as between the Zeppelin NT and usual non-rigid airships known as blimps. The Zeppelin NT is classified as a semi-rigid airship.

There are various roles for the Zeppelin NT; traditional roles have been aerial tourism purposes and for conducting passenger services. The hull surfaces of the aircraft have also been used for advertising purposes. The Zeppelin NT have also been used for observation platforms, such as for aerial photographers and by television commentators covering major events. Due to their capability for low-vibration flight for up to 24 hours at a time, ZLT considers the airships suitable for research missions for environmental observation, troposphere research and natural resource prospecting.

==Development==
The modern development and construction embodied by the Zeppelin NT had been financed by a long-standing endowment, which had been initially funded with money left over from the earlier Zeppelin company, that had been under the trusteeship of the Mayor of Friedrichshafen. A stipulation had been placed upon the endowment that limited the use of its funds to the field of airships. Over the many years, the investment value of the endowment grew to a point where it had become viable for the funds to be put to use for the purpose of designing, developing, and constructing of a new generation of Zeppelins.

In 1988, the first considerations into the technological and economic feasibility of reviving the Zeppelin industry began; this included examinations of historic Zeppelin documentation as well as current designs for airships. In December 1990, a feasibility study and accompanying market research program found an initial sales potential for around eighty Zeppelin airships for purposes such as tourism, advertising, and scientific research. In mid 1991, the newly formed development team filed several patents on various technologies that would be later used on the subsequent airship, these included propeller arrangements, structure and girder design, and ballonet implementation. In March 1991, a flyable remote control proof of concept model was demonstrated, which is claimed to have revealed excellent flight characteristics from the onset.

In September 1993, the Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH (ZLT) was founded in Friedrichshafen as a corporate spin-off of the original Zeppelin company to pursue development and production of the new generation of Zeppelins, later known as the Zeppelin NT (New Technology). By spring 1994, preparatory studies for a full-sized prototype were underway. In 1995, the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt, Germany&#x27;s civil aviation authority, officially recognized ZLT as a design organisation, and approved new construction regulations for airships. In November 1995, final assembly of the first airship prototype commenced, it was promoted as being the first rigid airship to be produced by the firm since the Second World War. In July 1996, the under-construction prototype of the Zeppelin N07 was presented to the public and the media. In September 1997, the prototype performed its maiden flight at Friedrichshafen; piloted by US test pilot Scott Danneker, it flew for a total of 40 minutes.

On 8 August 1998, the Zeppelin N07 prototype performed a cross-country flight via Altenrhein, Switzerland to Echterdingen near Stuttgart, Germany; at the end of this journey, the prototype also accomplished its first masting away from Friedrichshafen upon landing at Stuttgart Airport. The test program included noise level measurements, avionics tests, and take-offs and landings. In October 1999, the prototype completed a journey, its longest distance flight at that point. According to the manufacturer, the Zeppelin N07 prototype had proven the technical design by mid 1998, and thus could be applied to production models without major modifications.

On 2 July 2000, the centennial of the first Zeppelin flight, the prototype was christened &quot;D-LZFN Friedrichshafen&quot; by Count Zeppelin&#x27;s granddaughter, Elisabeth Veil. In July 2000, the prototype performed a high-profile tour of Germany, travelled more than in about 75 flight hours and appearing at the Expo 2000 at Hannover. By December 2000, the flight test programme was completed; during which, the prototype had accumulated in excess of 800 flight hours over roughly 220 flights. In June 2001, the prototype appeared at the Paris Air Show, the occasion being the first time that a Zeppelin had cruised above Paris since the 1920s.

In May 1999, the production of the components for the first production airship was started. In February 2000, the support structure assembly of the first series airship was completed, while the envelope was attached to the support structure in May that year. In 2001, the company formally commenced series manufacturing of the Zeppelin NT, and began the commercial exploitation of the airships. In April 2001, the Luftfahrt-Bundesamt issued type certification for the Zeppelin N07, a key step towards commercial operations; that same month, ZLT became a certified airship-manufacturing company. On 19 May 2001, the first production airship conducted its maiden flight, flying for two and a half hours. On 10 August 2001, the first production airship &quot;SN 02&quot; was christened &quot;D-LZZR Bodensee&quot; by Carl, Duke of Württemberg; five days later, it began providing commercial passenger services, initially involving one-hour sightseeing flights over Lake Constance to members of the public up to ten times per day.

==Design==

===Overview===

The Zeppelin NT series are a family of &quot;semi-rigid&quot; airships, combining the design principles of rigid airships and blimps together. The Zeppelin N07, the base model and most commonly constructed to date, are long, with a volume of . They are thus considerably smaller than the old Zeppelins, which reached a maximum volume of , such as the LZ 129 &quot;Hindenburg&quot;. Furthermore, they are inflated exclusively with the non-flammable noble gas helium, rather than with hydrogen.

The Zeppelin NT, designed more than 60 years after the last generation of Zeppelins were built and making use of advances in material science and computer-aided design, is claimed to overcome some of the typical maneuverability, safety, and economic disadvantages of airships. In particular, the propulsion system offers significantly increased safety. In standard operations with a maximum payload, the gas cells do not create enough buoyancy to make the whole ship &quot;lighter-than-air.&quot; The negative buoyancy is overcome with the application of engine power. The buoyancy can change when traveling with a reduced payload and partially emptied fuel tanks, but typically the Zeppelin NT starts a journey with a net downward force of about ; on long trips, the airship can become lighter–than–air if much of its fuel is consumed.

The design typically has a range of some and reaches top speeds of . The standard cruising speed of for tourist flights can be attained using the rear propeller only. Standard operational altitude is , but up to is possible. Their maximum permitted takeoff weight is , with a payload of . A long endurance system can also be installed for extended range and longer flight times.

===Hull and structure===
The Zeppelin NT is a &quot;semi-rigid&quot; airship. It is unlike both the original Zeppelins that had a rigid skeleton and non-rigid blimps. It has an internal triangular truss made of graphite-reinforced plastic and three longitudinal girders made of welded aluminium which connect the triangular elements along the length of the frame. Additionally, the structure is tightened with aramid cords to provide for extra rigidity. All major components, such as the engines, control cabin and the steering fins, are mounted upon the structure; this allows maneuverability to be maintained even in the event of envelope pressure being lost. The whole structure weighs only about .

The envelope contains the lighter-than-air helium which gives the airship its buoyancy. Inside historical Zeppelins, the gas cells were separate entities from the hull; however, on the Zeppelin NT, the envelope serves both as the aircraft&#x27;s hull and as the gas cell. It is made of a three-layered laminate: one gas-tight layer of Tedlar (PVF), one polyester fabric layer to provide stability and one polyurethane layer suitable for plastic welding that acts to connect the separate laminate panels. To preserve its outer form, a slight overpressure of about is maintained within the hull. As in blimps, the interior pressure is kept constant at all flight altitudes by using ballonets. The ballonets have a total volume of .

On the external surfaces of the Zeppelin NT are several equipment attachment points, including multiple hardpoints present for the purpose of installing cameras of up to 65 kg weight; an optional nose-mounted boom can be installed for attaching sensor equipment or scientific probes. Payloads can also be suspended underneath the airship via a cargo hook arrangement using the floor hatch present in the cabin. Due to the center of gravity and the location of the cabin being different, two sets of non-retractable landing gear are installed on the underside of the airship, the forward set being directly attached to the cabin&#x27;s underside and the aft set upon the primary structure itself.

===Propulsion and steering===

Power for the Zeppelin NT&#x27;s propulsion systems is provided by a trio of Textron Lycoming IO-360 boxer aviation engines, fueled by standard aviation gasoline. These engines are mounted on the sides and rear of the structure itself to provide optimum efficiency; this arrangement also increases in-flight comfort due to reduced levels of propeller noise and vibration. In addition to thrust, each engine also provides maneuverability via their swiveling propellers; the two forward engines are equipped with hydraulically-actuated tilting propellers which are usually aligned horizontally, but can be turned 90° upward or 30° downward, while the aft engine powers a fixed lateral propeller. Each engine is furnished with separate fuel tanks and supply systems that typically operate independently of one another.

The swiveling propellers have been claimed to have provided the Zeppelin NT with unique flight characteristics, such as being able to hover precisely, fly backwards, take off vertically, and turn on its axis. The functionality of the swiveling propellers allows the Zeppelin NT to carry out both take-offs and landing operations entirely in the vertical plane. During such operations, only three ground personnel are required, lowering costs and minimizing turnaround times as a consequence. In 2010, development of an improved propeller capable of quieter operation was completed.

Instead of four rudder and elevator fins set on the airship&#x27;s empennage, the Zeppelin NT uses only three identical fins; one fin being set at the top with the others offset at an angle of 120 degrees to either side of the top fin. This arrangement not only saves weight, but as a side effect, the loss of one fin can be compensated with the remaining two. The aerodynamically balanced rudders are equipped with independent electrical actuators.

===Cockpit and cabin===

The two-man cockpit of the Zeppelin NT is equipped with modern avionics systems and provides similar levels of external visibility to that of a helicopter. The flight controls make use of fly-by-wire technology to reduce physical demands upon the pilot as well as enable the execution of precision maneuvers; the pilot uses a single joystick to steer the airship across the three dimensions. The Zeppelin NT is certified for single pilot operations; the second seat is often used by a flight attendant during tourist operations. Elements of the airship&#x27;s avionics, including navigation, communication, and air data systems, can be directly interfaced with the mission support systems; an 8kVA additional electrical power system is also present. In early 2012, ZLT and Goodyear signed an agreement to replace the Zeppelin NT&#x27;s instrumentation and display systems, upgrading the cockpit to feature a glass cockpit.

The base model of the Zeppelin NT has a passenger capacity of 12 in addition to a crew of two; alternatively, it is capable of lifting payloads of up to . In contrast, the original Zeppelin designs carried over a hundred passengers and crew, with a nearly even ratio of passengers to crew members. The Zeppelin NT has been equipped with a variable cabin structure, allowing it to be quickly changed for various purposes and missions. Entrance and egress of the cabin for both cargo and passengers is provided by a pair of large hinged floor-level doors. In a passenger configuration, up to 13 seats equipped with seatbelts may be installed along with heating/air conditioning systems, a kitchenette, and a restroom in the rear cabin area; large wraparound windows are also present to provide panoramic views of the outside. Amongst the possible seating configurations, more luxurious VIP layouts are also available. Alternatively, mission equipment can be installed in the cabin area.

==Operational history==

Seven Zeppelin NTs have been built to date.

===&quot;D-LZFN, Friedrichshafen&quot;===

The prototype Zeppelin NT (SN 01), &quot;D-LZFN, Friedrichshafen&quot;, was intended to be used for training pilots for special flights and for presentations. During the Oktoberfest of 2002 a Zeppelin NT was used for radio experiments in connection with the European Galileo positioning system project for the German Aerospace Center and the ESA. It was intended that all further ships would be used commercially or sold. As a tribute to the days of Zeppelin mail, a number of mail-carrying flights were planned. Steve Fossett and Paul Stroehle set the current speed record for airships over a distance of one kilometer on Wednesday, October 27, 2004 in Friedrichshafen, Germany with a Zeppelin NT. The new world record was set to , an improvement of .

Starting in late 2005 the &quot;Friedrichshafen&quot; was based in Jwaneng, a diamond mining town in southern Botswana, where it conducted an airborne geophysical survey on behalf of De Beers Prospecting Botswana. The airship was moved from Amsterdam to Cape Town by ship and then flown to Gaborone where a Lockheed Martin full tensor gravity gradiometer was installed. This instrument, owned and operated by Bell Geospace, measures changes in the Earth&#x27;s gravity field associated with geological density variations. The technology is based on accelerometers and the data quality is sensitive to the turbulence and motion usually associated with fixed wing aircraft installations. The airship, flying slowly at night in relatively cool calm air, provides a very stable and vibrationally quiet platform. The resulting data is capable of revealing the rather faint gravity signals associated with Kimberlite pipes – a source of diamonds – buried under the Kalahari sands. This survey came to an end on 20 September 2007, when &quot;D-LZFN&quot; was irreparably damaged by a whirlwind while moored at its mast.

Registration number &quot;D-LZFN&quot;, was later given to SN 02 when it returned from Japan.

===&quot;D-LZZR, Bodensee&quot;===

The second Zeppelin NT and first production model (SN 02) was named D-LZZR &quot;Bodensee&quot; and began the first commercial tourist operations on August 15, 2001 by Deutsche Zeppelin Reederei (DZR). On March 2, 2004 the DZR sold it to &quot;Nippon Airship Corporation&quot; in Japan. Transferred in June 2004, it was to have followed the historical route of the 1929 World Tour of the famous dirigible LZ127 &quot;Graf Zeppelin&quot;. After problems with Russian authorities (unattested air security), a special ship for huge parts from the Netherlands was chartered and the Zeppelin was shipped from Italy to Japan by sea. The company used the airship mainly for tours and advertising. In May 2010, due to economic problems at Nippon Airship Corporation, the SN 02 was shipped back to Germany. The craft regained her old name &quot;Bodensee&quot; and resumed passenger operations in 2012. In winter 2015–16, &quot;Bodensee&quot; was rebuilt to -101 configuration, with its passenger capacity increased to 14.

===&quot;D-LZZF, Baden-Württemberg&quot;===
The third Zeppelin NT (SN03) and second production model, designated &quot;D-LZZF, Baden-Württemberg&quot;, first flew in February 2003. It is currently flown in revenue passenger service by the DZR. It was painted in Goodyear colors for the summer season 2010 to promote a new joint venture between Goodyear and the Zeppelin Luftschiffbau, the first in 70 years.

===&quot;D-LZNT, Eureka&quot;===
In January 2006, the &quot;Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik&quot; GmbH announced the start of construction of a fourth Zeppelin N07. In 2007, it was optioned by California-based Airship Ventures. On 21 May 2008, the new airship completed its first flight. Between July and September 2008, the airship, registered &quot;D-LZNT&quot;, operated sightseeing and pleasure flights over eastern London and the Thames Estuary from an airfield close to Upminster, in Essex, England, advertising Stella Artois beer and the DrinkAware responsible alcohol use campaign. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the type certificate for the Zeppelin N07, allowing the airship to fly legally in the United States. In late September 2008, the airship arrived at the Port of Beaumont, Texas; after spending three days tethered at the Southeast Texas Regional Airport, the airship flew cross-country to its base at Moffett Federal Airfield. Upon its arrival, the airship was given the US registration &quot;N704LZ&quot;, and was christened &quot;Eureka&quot; (after the California state motto). In November 2008, Airship Ventures began commercial operations, offering flightseeing tours over the San Francisco and Monterey Bay areas, operating both out of Moffett Field and Oakland Terminal. On 14 November 2012, Airship Ventures ceased operations and grounded &quot;Eureka&quot;. &quot;Eureka&quot; was disassembled and shipped back to Germany. In 2019-2020, &quot;D-LZNT&quot; was rebuilt to N07-101 -standard and brought back to service, with a completely new gondola for 16 passengers and crew. 

===Goodyear===

On 3 May 2011, Goodyear confirmed their intentions to reinstate their long-lost partnership with Zeppelin. Goodyear placed an order for three Zeppelin NT LZ N07-101 models with plans to start operation in January 2014. The Zeppelin NT is the successor to Goodyear&#x27;s non-rigid airship, the GZ-20 in Goodyear airship advertising. Goodyear&#x27;s first zeppelin, &quot;Wingfoot One&quot;, was unveiled on 14 March 2014 and is currently stationed in Pompano Beach, Florida, USA. The second zeppelin, &quot;Wingfoot Two&quot; made its maiden flight on 12 March 2016. &quot;Wingfoot Two&quot; is stationed in Carson, California. The third zeppelin, &quot;Wingfoot Three&quot; made its maiden flight on 25 June 2018 and will be permanently stationed in Suffield Township, Ohio.

===Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei===
In January 2001, ZLG founded the &quot;Deutsche Zeppelin-Reederei&quot; (DZR) (German for &quot;German Zeppelin shipping company&quot;) as a subsidiary. Since 15 August 2001, DZR has offered aerial sightseeing tours using a number of Zeppelin NT airships; in June 2010, the 100,000th passenger was carried, less than nine years after commercial operations were launched. In March 2004, DZR became the first company in the world to receive certification as a flight school for airships, initially providing such services to the Japanese Nippon Airship Corporation.

==Variants==
;LZ N07-100
:Original production version.
;LZ N07-101
:Slightly improved version produced since 2011. New avionics and slightly longer gondola increasing max passenger capacity to 14. Goodyear ships are seated for ten passengers, with addition of on-board toilet.

<text>Elulu (, ; ) is listed as the third king of the First Dynasty of Ur on the &quot;Sumerian king list&quot;, which states he reigned for 25 years.

One early inscription for an &quot;Elulu (or Elili), king of Ur&quot; was found at nearby Eridu, stating that this king had built up the &quot;abzu&quot; ziggurat for Enki.

Some scholars have further connected Elulu with the &quot;Elilina&quot; who was said to be the father of the later king Enshakushanna of Uruk, but this theory is uncertain, owing to chronological difficulties. The inscription states that Enshakushanna&#x27;s father was &quot;Elilina&quot;, possibly King Elulu of Ur:

<doc id="672982" wikidata="Q7857764" url="?curid=672982" title="Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Twenty-third Amendment of the Constitution Act 2001 of the Constitution of Ireland is an amendment that permitted the state to become a party to the International Criminal Court (ICC). It was approved by referendum on 7 June 2001 and signed into law on the 27 March 2002. The referendum was held on the same day as referendums on the prohibition of the death penalty, which was also approved, and on the ratification of the Nice Treaty, which was rejected.

==Background==
The Statute of the International Criminal Court established the International Criminal Court. As its ratification would affect Ireland&#x27;s sovereignty and powers and functions elsewhere in the Constitution, under the decision of the Supreme Court in &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot; (1987), an amendment was required before it could be ratified.

==Changes to the text==
Insertion of new Article 29.9:
==Oireachtas debate==
The Twenty-third Amendment was proposed in Dáil Éireann by Minister for Foreign Affairs Brian Cowen on behalf of the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government led by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. It had the support of all parties and it passed final stages in the Dáil on 12 April. It passed final stages in the Seanad on 2 May and proceeded to a referendum on 11 June 2001.

==Result==


==Aftermath==
The International Criminal Court came into force on 1 July 2002.

==Note on numbering==
The Twenty-third Amendment Bill was put to the people with the Twenty-first and Twenty-fourth Amendment Bills. This is because the Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution Bill was withdrawn by the government during the course of debate in the Oireachtas. There was therefore no Twenty-second Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, as the title of legislation is not changed on its enactment.

<text>The CDU donations scandal was a political scandal resulting from the illegal forms of party financing used by the German Christian Democratic Union (CDU) during the 1990s. These included accepting hidden donations, the non-disclosure of cash donations, the maintenance of secret bank accounts, and illegal wire transfers to and from foreign banks.

The scandal was uncovered in late 1999 and remained the dominant subject of political discussion and news coverage in Germany for several months. The &quot;Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache&quot; selected the term &quot;Schwarzgeldaffäre&quot; (literally, &quot;black money affair&quot; i.e. &quot;illegal earnings scandal&quot;) as German Word of the Year 2000. Opinion polls conducted by the Allensbach Institute suggest that in November 1999 (before the scandal became known), the CDU was expected to receive around 45 percent of the popular vote in a hypothetical German federal election. By February 2000, this value had plummeted down to 31 percent.

As a consequence, two of the leading CDU figures of the 1980s and 1990s, Helmut Kohl and Wolfgang Schäuble lost their political influence, with Angela Merkel and Roland Koch emerging as the most powerful German conservative politicians.

<text>(complete title in historical spelling: &quot;&quot;; The Obligation of the First and Foremost Commandment), K. 35, is a sacred musical play (&quot;geistliches Singspiel&quot;) composed by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1767 when he was 11 years old. It is Mozart&#x27;s first opera or, more specifically, &quot;sacred drama&quot;, as is suggested by the name. The libretto is now attributed to , although Johann Adam Wieland or Jakob Anton Marianus Wimmer had been suggested earlier. (The title page of the libretto ascribes it only to &quot;J.A.W.&quot;.) Only the first part of the opera was composed by Mozart; the second and third parts were contributed by Michael Haydn and Anton Cajetan Adlgasser respectively. However, these other two parts have not survived. Part 1 of the opera was first performed on March 12, 1767, in the Knight&#x27;s Hall of the Palace of the Archbishop, the Salzburg Residenz. Part 2 was performed on March 19, and part 3 on March 26.

==Background and performance history==
Mozart composed the work at age 11 with the help of his two teachers, Michael Haydn and Anton Cajetan Adlgasser. In Salzburg, dividing up a sacred singspiel between other composers was common. The libretto was written by Ignatz Anton von Weiser even though it was said that Johann Adam Wieland suggested the idea first and his name is written on the libretto. Mozart composed only the first part of the opera, and the others composed &quot;part two&quot; and &quot;part three.&quot; However, these other two parts have not survived. The performances were predominantly in Salzburg in St. Peter&#x27;s, in Cathedrals, on the Nonnberg, and in Residenz. The opera includes many recitatives for all of the characters, and each character sings one to three arias. The characters of the opera are two tenors: Christgeist and Christ (a Christian), and three sopranos: Barmherzigkeit, Gerechtigkeit, and Weltgeist. The opera does not have a chorus.

Part I of the opera was first performed on 12 March 1767 in the Knight&#x27;s Hall of the Palace of the Archbishop, Salzburg. Part II was performed on 19 March, and Part III on 26 March.

<doc id="672992" wikidata="Q4009720" url="?curid=672992" title="Twenty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland">
<text>The Twenty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Act 2002 (previously bill no. 32 of 2003) is an amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which permitted the state to ratify the Treaty of Nice. It was approved by referendum on 19 October 2002 (sometimes known as the second Nice referendum) and signed into law on 7 November of the same year. The amendment followed a previous failed attempt to approve the Nice Treaty which was rejected in the first Nice referendum held in 2001.

==Background==
The Treaty of Nice was signed by the member states of the European Union in February 2001, amending the Treaties of the European Union. Under the decision of the Supreme Court in &quot;Crotty v. An Taoiseach&quot; (1987), an amendment to the Constitution was required before it could be ratified by Ireland. In June 2001, an amendment to the Constitution of to allow the ratification of the Nice Treaty was rejected in a referendum. One of the reasons the No side had called for its rejection was that it would affect Irish neutrality. When the Nice Treaty was put to a second vote, the wording of the constitutional amendment excluded participation in common defence. The Treaty of Nice contained a number of optional discretionary provisions that member-states could activate at a later time after its adoption. The Government of Ireland and the European Council jointly made the Seville Declarations on the Treaty of Nice in June 2002 to recommit themselves to shared interests ahead of the second vote. The Twenty-sixth Amendment permitted the Republic to choose to exercise these options, provided its decision was approved by the Oireachtas.

==Changes to the text==
Insertion of the following subsections in Article 29.4:
Existing subsections 7° and 8° of Article 29.4 renumbered as 10° and 11° respectively.

==Oireachtas debate==
The Twenty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill was proposed in Dáil Éireann by Minister for Foreign Affairs Brian Cowen on 4 September 2002 on behalf of the Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats coalition government led by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern. It passed final stages in the Dáil on 11 September, where it also had the support of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and was opposed by Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the Socialist Party and a number of Independent TDs. It passed final stages in Seanad Éireann on 13 September and proceeded to a referendum on 19 October.

==Campaign==
A Referendum Commission was established by Minister for the Environment and Local Government Noel Dempsey. It was chaired by former Chief Justice Thomas Finlay. Its role was to prepare one or more statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal and of the text of the proposal in the amendment bill.

==Result==

The &#x27;± Yes 2001&#x27; column shows the percentage point change in the Yes vote compared to the first Nice referendum which was rejected in a referendum in 2001.

==Note on numbering==
The Twenty-sixth Amendment follows directly after the Twenty-third Amendment in the list of passed Amendments. This is because the Twenty-fourth and Twenty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution Bills were both rejected in referendums, and the government decided not to reuse the numbers. Numbers have been re-used before, for example, there were rejected proposals titled the Third Amendment in 1959 and in 1968, before the Third Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland was passed in 1972.

<text>Shu-turul (Shu-durul, , &quot;shu-tur2-ul3&quot; also Šu-Turul; died 2154 BC) was the last king of Akkad, ruling for 15 years according to the Sumerian king list. It indicates that he succeeded his father Dudu. A few artifacts, seal impressions etc. attest that he held sway over a greatly reduced Akkadian territory that included Kish, Tutub, Nippur, and Eshnunna. The Diyala River also bore the name &quot;Shu-durul&quot; at the time.
==Sumerian King List==
The king list asserts that Akkad was then conquered, and the hegemony returned to Uruk following his reign. It further lists six names of an Uruk dynasty; however only two of these six rulers, Ur-nigin, and Ur-gigir, have been confirmed through archaeology. With Akkad&#x27;s collapse the Gutians, who had established their capital at Adab, became the regional power, though several of the southern city-states such as Uruk, Ur and Lagash also declared independence around this time.

==Inscriptions==
A few inscriptions in his name are known. One, on an administrative clay sealing found at Kish reads:

A clay sealing of Shu-turl was found at Nippur. Another reading &quot;[S]u-Turul, the [m]ighty, [ki]ng of [Aga]de: ... [(is) his servant].&quot; was found at Tell Asmar.

A votive mace, made of dark green marble, is also known with an inscription mentioning Shu-turul and the dedication of a temple to Nergal:

A seventeen centimeter long copper axe, acquired on the antiquities market, reads &quot;Su-Turul, the mighty, king of Agade&quot;.

A tablet found at Adab contains the year name &quot;year when Shu-Durul assumed the kingdom&quot;.

A one manna weight(in the shape of a duck), now held at the Urfa Museum, is inscribed with the name of an official of Akkadian ruler Shu-durul was recovered from a looted context in Titris Hoyuk.

<text>A base transceiver station (BTS) or a baseband unit (BBU) is a piece of equipment that facilitates wireless communication between user equipment (UE) and a network. UEs are devices like mobile phones (handsets), WLL phones, computers with wireless Internet connectivity, or antennas mounted on buildings or telecommunication towers. 
The network can be that of any of the wireless communication technologies like GSM, CDMA, wireless local loop, Wi-Fi, WiMAX or other wide area network (WAN) technology.

BTS is a part of a &quot;base station&quot; (BS).

Though the term BTS can be applicable to any of the wireless communication standards, it is generally associated with mobile communication technologies like GSM and CDMA. In this regard, a BTS forms part of the base station subsystem (BSS) developments for system management. It may also have equipment for encrypting and decrypting communications, spectrum filtering tools (band pass filters) and so on. Antennas may also be considered as components of BTS in general sense as they facilitate the functioning of BTS. Typically a BTS will have several transceivers (TRXs) which allow it to serve several different frequencies and different sectors of the cell (in the case of sectorised base stations). A BTS is controlled by a parent base station controller via the base station control function (BCF). The BCF is implemented as a discrete unit or even incorporated in a TRX in compact base stations. The BCF provides an operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) connection to the network management system (NMS), and manages operational states of each TRX, as well as software handling and alarm collection. The basic structure and functions of the BTS remains the same regardless of the wireless technologies.

== General architecture ==

A BTS is usually composed of:
; Transceiver (TRX): Provides transmission and reception of signals. It also does sending and reception of signals to and from higher network entities (like the base station controller in mobile telephony). This can be separated into a dedicated device known as a Remote radio head (RRH).
; Power amplifier (PA): Amplifies the signal from TRX for transmission through antenna; may be integrated with TRX.
; Combiner: Combines feeds from several TRXs so that they could be sent out through a single antenna. Allows for a reduction in the number of antenna used.
; Multiplexer: For separating sending and receiving signals to/from antenna. Does sending and receiving signals through the same antenna ports (cables to antenna).
; Antenna: This is the structure that the BTS lies underneath; it can be installed as it is or disguised in some way (concealed cellular sites).
; Alarm extension system: Collects working status alarms of various units in the BTS and extends them to operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) monitoring stations.
; Control function: Controls and manages the various units of BTS, including any software. On-the-spot configurations, status changes, software upgrades, etc. are done through the control function.
; Baseband receiver unit (BBxx): Frequency hopping, signal DSP.

== Terms regarding a mobile BTS ==
; Diversity techniques: To improve the quality of the received signal, often two receiving antennas are used, placed at a distance equal to an odd multiple of a quarter of the corresponding wavelength. For 900 MHz, this wavelength is 33 cm. This technique, known as antenna diversity or space diversity, avoids interruption caused by path fading. The antennas can be spaced horizontally or vertically. Horizontal spacing requires more complex installation, but brings better performance.

: Other than antenna or space diversity, there are other diversity techniques such as frequency/time diversity, antenna pattern diversity, and polarization diversity.

: Splitting refers to the flow of power within a particular area of the cell, known as a sector. Every field can therefore be considered like one new cell.

Directional antennas reduce LoRa (long-range) interference. If not sectorised, the cell will be served by an omnidirectional antenna, which radiates in all directions. A typical structure is the trisector, also known as clover, in which there are three sectors served by separate antennas. Each sector has a separate direction of tracking, typically of 120° with respect to the adjacent ones. Other orientations may be used to suit the local conditions. Bisectored cells are also implemented. These are most often oriented with the antennas serving sectors of 180° separation to one another, but again, local variations do exist.
