<text>Wharton State Forest is the largest state forest in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is the largest single tract of land in the state park system of New Jersey, encompassing approximately of the Pinelands northeast of Hammonton. Its protected acreage is divided between Burlington, Camden, and Atlantic counties. The entire forest is located within the Atlantic coastal pine barrens ecoregion as well as the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve. The forest is located in the forested watershed of the Mullica River, which drains the central Pinelands region into the Great Bay. The forest is under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.

The forest is also the location of the historic Batsto Village, a former bog iron and glass manufacturing site from 1766 to 1867. The forest includes extensive hiking trails, including a section of the Batona Trail, which connects the forest to nearby Brendan T. Byrne State Forest and Bass River State Forest. It also includes over of unpaved roads. The rivers, including the Mullica, are popular destinations for recreational canoeing.

The forest is named for Joseph Wharton, who purchased most of the land that now lies within the forest in the 19th century. Wharton wanted to tap the groundwater under the Pine Barrens to provide a source of clean drinking water for Philadelphia; however, the New Jersey Legislature quashed the plan by passing a law that banned the export of water from the state. The state bought the vast tract from Wharton&#x27;s heirs in the 1950s.

==History==

In the 1800s, various bog iron and paper industries developed in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. In 1873, Philadelphia industrialist Joseph Wharton began purchasing property and abandoned towns in the Pine Barrens, eventually acquiring about . Wharton planned to build dams to redirect freshwater to Philadelphia, but the plan was blocked by the New Jersey legislature in 1884, with a law that blocked transporting waters outside of the state. After Joseph Wharton died in 1909, his family estate tried selling his property to New Jersey for $1 million, which was defeated by a referendum in 1915. For the next few decades, the Wharton estate was managed by a trust company.

In the 1950s and 1960s, the federal government sought to build a jetport in the Pine Barrens. To preserve the land of the Wharton estate, the New Jersey government purchased the lands containing large portions of the Mullica River in 1954, which was designated &quot;Wharton State Forest&quot; on December 30, 1954. New Jersey purchased additional land in 1956, totaling in its entirety, for a sum of $3 million. To prevent additional development, local residents and farmers worked to preserve the Pine Barrens, eventually leading to the formation of the Pinelands National Reserve in 1978.

A large fire, dubbed the Mullica River Fire, broke out at the Wharton State Forest in June 2022.

==Atsion Mansion==
Within the state forest, once a residence and cranberry packing facility, Atsion Mansion has been vacant since 1882. The mansion was constructed in 1826 by Samuel Richards, Ironmaster of the Atsion Iron Furnace &amp; Forge. It was built as a summer residency and used by Richards until his death in 1842. In 1960, the building lost even more of its glory when its west porch was torn down. Under the guidelines of the State of New Jersey, area contractors Wu &amp; Associates undertook the restoration of the site. The existing exterior stucco was removed and replaced with new material; the interior plaster, wood windows and shutter were restored; fireplace mantels, stone and wood floors in the basement, and the existing cedar roof were all repaired; and a new exterior sidewalk was added to a handicap ramp. The reconstruction of a western porch provided a historically accurate interpretation of the building to represent the way it was originally. The mansion is unique, in that the mansion is equipped with no electricity or indoor plumbing, allowing visitors to imagine how the Richards Family lived in the early 19th century.

==Inside Wharton==

A monument marks the location where Mexican aviation pioneer Emilio Carranza crashed on July 12, 1928 while attempting to fly his Ryan Brougham airplane, the Mexico Excelsior, non-stop from New York to Mexico City, final leg of a historic goodwill flight to the United States. The monument, installed with funds donated by Mexican schoolchildren, depicts a falling eagle of Aztec design. Every July on the Saturday nearest the anniversary of his crash (second Saturday in July) at 1:00 p.m. he is honored at the monument site by local residents and representatives from the Mexican consulates in New York City and Philadelphia.

The forest has ten campgrounds, ranging from family camping at Atsion Recreation Area, with showers and a guarded beach, to wilderness camping that can be reached only by hiking or canoe/kayak.

Apple Pie Hill is a popular hiking destination along the Batona Trail in the forest. The hill, topped with a New Jersey Forest Fire Service fire tower, provides impressive panoramic views across the Pinelands region.

<doc id="669099" wikidata="Q8661" url="?curid=669099" title="(434326) 2004 JG6">
<text>, provisional designation , is an eccentric, sub-kilometer sized asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Atira group. It is one of the closest orbiting objects to the Sun. While its perihelion lies within the orbit of Mercury its orbital trajectory is highly elliptical, causing its aphelion to cross the orbit of Venus. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria for a vulcanoid or ꞋAylóꞌchaxnim asteroid, which would require it have a wholly intra-Mercurian and intra-Venusian orbit respectively.

Only the second Atira asteroid to be confirmed, was at the time of its discovery the asteroid with the smallest known semi-major axis, however it has since been eclipsed in this regard by several other asteroids.

== Discovery ==
 was discovered on 11 May 2004, by leading astronomer Brian Skiff of the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) at Anderson Mesa Station near Flagstaff, United States.

The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa, as no precoveries were taken and no prior identifications were made.

== Orbit and classification ==

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.3–1.0 AU once every 6 months (185 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.53 and an inclination of 19° with respect to the ecliptic.

 is the second known Atira asteroid the first being the group&#x27;s namesake 163693 Atira which means its entire orbit lies within that of the Earth. Its orbital period is less than that of Venus, making it one of the closest known objects to the Sun, after Mercury. Due to its eccentric orbit, it crosses the orbits of both Mercury and Venus, which also makes it a Mercury- and Venus-crosser. It has an &quot;Earth minimum orbital intersection distance&quot; of which translates into 14.8 lunar distances.

== Physical characteristics ==

Based on a generic conversion from absolute magnitude, the asteroid measures between 0.6 and 1.4 kilometers in diameter.

== Naming ==

As of 2023, this minor planet remains unnamed.

<text>Las Noticias TeleOnce is the flagship news program for Puerto Rican television network TeleOnce it is currently anchored by Celimar Adames Casalduc during its evening editions, Maricarmen Ortiz and Manuel Crespo Feliciano during the day editions and by Shirlyan Odette during its night edition.

The news program originated in 1986 and ran four editions weekdays and two on weekends until its abrupt cancellation in 2014 by Univision who decided to close the station&#x27;s news department. In 2020, Univision sold TeleOnce to Liberman Media Group and the new ownership quickly reopened the station&#x27;s news department and revived &quot;Las Noticias&quot;.

==History==

=== Las Noticias TeleOnce (1986–2002)===
News programming on WLII began in May 1986, with Ramón Enrique Torres and Jennifer Wolff as anchors of the 5:00 p.m. newscast. In 1990, a noon newscast premiered with Torres and Margarita Aponte as its anchors, followed by the 10:30 p.m. newscast with Torres. On March 11, 1991, a weekday morning news program, &quot;Tu Mañana&quot;, made its debut; the program was anchored by Carlos Ochoteco and Cyd Marie Fleming and featured segments such as panels of experts on different topics.

Over the years, many people worked on &quot;Tu Mañana&quot; and &quot;Las Noticias&quot;. Reporters such as Carmen Dominicci, Elwood Cruz, Susan Soltero, Bruni Torres, Nuria Sebazco, Rommy Segarra, Felipe Gómez (now at WAPA-TV), Ada Monzón (now at WAPA-TV), and Liza Lugo have been featured.

In 1996, a monthly investigative/tabloid newsmagazine called &quot;Las Noticias Xtra&quot; began airing, which offered reports considered to be shocking by audiences. Taboo themes in Puerto Rican society such as homosexuality were featured. &quot;Las Noticias Xtra&quot; eventually was reduced to a weekly segment seen during the 6:00 and 11:00 p.m. newscasts. During WLII&#x27;s TeleOnce years, the station&#x27;s slogan was &quot;&quot; (), paralleling the 24-hour news source trend in the United States at the time.

=== Las Noticias Univision (2002–2014) ===

After the Univision integration in 2002, &quot;Las Noticias&quot; became &quot;Las Noticias Univision&quot; and acquired the branding of all other Univision O&amp;O stations news broadcasts. WLII began broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition on September 26, 2010. Due to budget cuts that were imposed by Univision in Miami, WLII reduced its news department by between 20 and 50 employees, and &quot;Las Noticias a las 6&quot; was reduced from 60 to 30 minutes. The station discontinued its weekend newscasts on January 5, 2014; following this, it reduced its news operation from to hours each week, which led to the firing of 19 employees.

On October 17, 2014, Univision announced that Jaime Bauzá had been promoted to senior vice-president and general manager of all of the network&#x27;s operations in Puerto Rico. The first change he made was the firing of 109 employees. This caused the closing of the entire news department, including reporters, anchors, and cameramen. On that day, the morning show &quot;Tu Mañana&quot; was shown as normal, but the midday show &quot;Tu Mediodia&quot; was not, during which time reporter Daisy Sánchez published on her Twitter account the announcement of the news department&#x27;s closing.

The roundtable talk show &quot;Rubén &amp; Co.&quot; replaced the 5:00 p.m. spot left by &quot;Las Noticias&quot;. The show was extended from 30 to 60 minutes, and filled the 5:00 p.m. timeslot until its cancellation on January 20, 2016.

=== Las Noticias TeleOnce revival (since 2021) ===

On February 18, 2021, TeleOnce hired José Enrique &quot;Kike&quot; Cruz, who was news director at WAPA-TV for 32 years (from 1976 until his retirement in 2018), as an adviser for the revamped news department after more than six years without newscasts. On April 14, 2021, TeleOnce hired Jenny Suarez, a former news producer at WAPA-TV, as its vice-president of the revamped news department.

On June 7, 2021, WLII-DT confirmed their intentions to relaunch their newscasts with the new telecast set to premiere in late July/early August 2021 in the 5 p.m. timeslot. Celimar Adames Casalduc (who anchored WAPA-TV&#x27;s &quot;NotiCentro&quot; for 18 years) would join TeleOnce as the lead anchor for the newscast, and Deborah Martorell (who served as WAPA-TV&#x27;s Chief Meteorologist for 27 years) would also be joining as TeleOnce&#x27;s Chief Meteorologist. It was also announced that Tatiana Ortiz and Nuria Sebazco (who previously hosted TeleOnce&#x27;s morning newscast &quot;Tu Mañana&quot;) would return to the network, both migrating from WKAQ-TV. On June 8, 2021, WLII-DT announced that Ricardo Currás (formerly of WKAQ-TV and who anchored morning newscasts from Univision O&amp;O WXTV-DT) would join Adames as co-anchor.

On June 23, 2021, WLII-DT announced that their relaunched newscast would be called &quot;Las Noticias TeleOnce&quot;, thus reviving the original brand which ran for almost 30 years. &quot;Las Noticias TeleOnce&quot; premiered on July 12, 2021, with three editions: &quot;Las Noticias: Ahora&quot; (&#x27;&quot;The News: Now&quot;&#x27;) at 3:55 p.m., &quot;Las Noticias: Prime&quot; (&#x27;&quot;The News: Prime&quot;&#x27;) at 4:55 p.m., and &quot;Las Noticias: Última Edición&quot; (&quot;&#x27;The News: Final Edition&quot;&#x27;) at 10:00 p.m. All three editions were anchored by Adames and Currás, and featured Martorell on weather and Luis Joel Aymat (who anchored the former &quot;Edicion Puerto Rico&quot; newscast) in sports.

On October 4, 2021, &quot;Las Noticias&quot; added a political analysis team composed of former Puerto Rican Governor Anibal Acevedo Vila, former gubernatorial candidate Alexandra Lúgaro, journalist and &quot;Jugando Pelota Dura&quot; contributor Leo Aldridge, and lawyer Ramón Rosario Cortés. The segment entitled &quot;El Comentario de la Tarde&quot; features one of the aforementioned commentators breaking down a news item alongside anchors Currás and Adames.

On October 11, 2021, the nightly newscast &quot;Las Noticias: Última Edición&quot; moved from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. due to premiere of WLII&#x27;s new late-night talk show, &quot;Acuéstate con Francis&quot;.

On November 18, 2021, WLII-DT announced that &quot;Las Noticias&quot; would add another daily newscast, this one during the midday time slot. The newscast, titled &quot;Las Noticias Al Mediodía&quot; (&quot;&#x27;The News at Noon&quot;&#x27;), debuted December 6, 2021, at 12 p.m. and features Celimar Adames, Nuria Sebazco and Deborah Martorell, which, according to WLII, is the first all-female local news team in Puerto Rico. This edition follows a different format from the other newscasts, and features segments on lifestyle, travel, and finances.

On December 3, 2021, Celimar Adames announced that she will no longer anchor the 11 p.m. broadcast of &quot;Última Edición&quot;, and would instead focus on anchoring the midday and afternoon broadcasts; field reporter Shirlyan Odette would replace her for the 11 p.m. broadcast.

On December 9, 2021, during the station&#x27;s upfront presentation, VP of News Jenny Suarez and consultant José Enrique &quot;Kike&quot; Cruz announced the revival of the morning news show &quot;Tu Mañana&quot;. The show was slated to return in early 2022—over 8 years after its abrupt cancellation in October 2014. However, the following year, it was delayed until late 2023.

On December 14, 2021, WLII-DT launched a new investigative unit for the news department headed by journalist and lawyer Mardelis Jusino, who worked at the investigative division of &quot;Jugando Pelota Dura&quot;, as well as for WAPA-TV and WMTJ. The investigative unit team consists of Melissa Correa, who worked for 18 years at El Vocero; Tatiana Ortiz and Arnaldo Rojas, who worked as an anchor and reporter for WAPA-TV from 2002 to 2008.

On January 11, 2022, WLII-DT announced that former representative Gary Rodriguez, who worked for WAPA-TV&#x27;s &quot;Lo Sé Todo&quot; would be joining &quot;Las Noticias&quot; as a political commentator. His on-air debut was on January 15, 2022. The new section titled &quot;El Fuetazo de Gary&quot; officially began on January 24, 2021, and airs during the midday and evening newscasts.

On January 23, 2022, WLII-DT announced that Liam Rodríguez Muñoz, who worked for ABC News Extra, would join the news department as a video journalist and reporter. Rodríguez Muñoz previously worked for the station, as a panelist for &quot;Los Seis de la Tarde&quot; and as a reporter and content producer for &quot;Jugando Pelota Dura&quot;.

On March 22, 2022, Andrea Rivera, who worked for WAPA-TV as a host for &quot;Viva la Tarde&quot;, joined WLII-DT&#x27;s news department as an entertainment reporter, and premiered its segment called &quot;Primera Fila&quot; on April 4, 2022. She also co-hosts &quot;La Boveda de Teleonce&quot;, which serves as a lead-in for &quot;Las Noticias&quot;.

On July 3, 2023, the station announced Cristina Pagán as its new sports reporter. Pagán comes from WKAQ-TV where she worked as segment producer, she replaces Luis Joel Aymat who was dismissed from the position earlier in the year.

On October 12, 2023, WLII announced the hiring of Carlos Tolentino Rosario to &quot;Las Noticias&quot;. Rosario previously worked as a reporter for newspaper &quot;El Nuevo Día&quot; and will be taking over the weather report segment on the night broadcast after Manuel Crespo Feliciano was promoted to anchor of the station&#x27;s upcoming morning show &quot;En La Mañana&quot;.

On November 1, 2024, Ricardo Currás has exited WLII after three years as an anchor and reporter.

==En La Mañana==

WLII debuted on the morning show format with &quot;Tu Mañana&quot; in 1991. The show quickly became a leader in morning news with anchors Bruni Torres and Felipe Gomez Martinez and ran until 2014 when the decision to close of the station&#x27;s news department effectively cancelled the program.

<text>The Rocket Summer is the solo project of Bryce Avary, a multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter, and record producer based in Dallas–Fort Worth, Texas. 

He has released eight studio albums and several EPs. His fifth release, 2012&#x27;s &quot;Life Will Write the Words&quot;, reached No. 58 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 12 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums chart as well as No. 12 on Top Independent Albums chart. His fourth release, &quot;Of Men and Angels&quot;, held the No. 1 Top Album spot on iTunes upon its release in 2010. &quot;AP Magazine&quot; called him one of &quot;100 bands you need to know.&quot;

==Early life and musical interest==
Avary was born in Fort Worth, Texas. He first became interested in music around the age of 12 when his father bought him his first guitar which was an imitation brand from a pawn shop for 50 dollars. Avary subsequently began teaching himself other instruments including the drums and piano.

Avary joined his first band at the age of 14. He later joined a high school &quot;indie rock punk&quot; band at Grapevine High School where he was also a photographer of the school&#x27;s yearbook, inspired by Pavement, Archers of Loaf and Weezer, called Charlie 27. After the band broke up, Avary began performing local acoustic shows as a teenager in Dallas, Fort Worth and Denton.

==Music career==
===2000–2003: Self-titled EP===
In 2000, Avary self-released his first EP at the age of 17. The EP included songs he had written between the ages 14 to 16. He distributed the EP under the name &quot;The Rocket Summer,&quot; at the suggestion of a friend, to local stores to be sold on consignment; the name was inspired by Ray Bradbury&#x27;s short story collection &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, which his friend was reading at the time. Avary described the project as initially &quot;just a really fun experiment.&quot; After the EP&#x27;s original 1000 copies sold out, it went out of print until it was later re-released as &quot;The Early Years EP&quot; under The Militia Group in November 2006.

His music appeared on The Adventure Club (with Josh Venable) segment of the KDGE radio station, and quickly became the most requested local band on the program that year.

===2003–2005: &quot;Calendar Days&quot; and &quot;Hello, Good Friend&quot;===
Avary recorded, produced, and released his debut album, &quot;Calendar Days&quot;, in 2003. The album was recorded in Eudora, Kansas.

In November 2004, Avary began working on his second album, &quot;Hello, Good Friend&quot;. The album peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard Heatseekers chart. To promote the album, The Rocket Summer toured the US and Japan.

===2005–2008: &quot;The Early Years EP&quot; and &quot;Do You Feel&quot;===
In November 2006, The Militia Group re-released The Rocket Summer&#x27;s self-released 1999 EP as &quot;The Early Years EP&quot;, and Avary signed with major record label Island Def Jam Records. &quot;Do You Feel&quot; was released in July 2007; the album reached No. 44 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 16 on the Billboard Top Rock Albums charts.

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;So Much Love&quot;, was warmly received by critics for its uniqueness and use of a horn section. The &quot;So Much Love&quot; music video was directed by MTV Music Video Award-winning director Shane Drake. 
The Rocket Summer released the second single, &quot;Do You Feel&quot;, and its music video on September 5, 2008. The video was co-directed and funded by Bryce Avary with director Nate Weaver. The video featured stories of people with issues such as homelessness, addiction, disease and abuse. The video also featured cameos from artists Andrew McMahon of Jack&#x27;s Mannequin, Matt Thiessen of Relient K, Josh Farro and Jeremy Davis of Paramore, Mike Herrera of MxPx, Forrest Kline of Hellogoodbye and Alex Gaskarth of All Time Low.

Avary was featured on the cover of &quot;Alternative Press Magazine&quot; while co-headlining the AP Tour.

===2008–2011: &quot;You Gotta Believe EP&quot;, &quot;Of Men and Angels&quot; and &quot;Bryce Avary, His Instruments and Your Voices&quot; ===
Avary recorded his fourth studio album, &quot;Of Men and Angels&quot; at Ocean Studios in Burbank, CA, from February to April 2009. 
Mixed with Neal Avron and engineered / co-produced with CJ Eiriksson, Avary described the album as &quot;the most substance-filled Rocket Summer album to date.&quot; 
The Rocket Summer released a digital 4-track EP entitled &quot;You Gotta Believe&quot; in October 2009. The EP featured three tracks off the LP &quot;Of Men and Angels&quot; and one bonus track. The EP debuted at No. 23 on the Billboard charts for Digital Albums. The video for the title song was directed by director Randy Scott Slavin.

On February 23, 2010, The Rocket Summer released his fourth studio album, &#x27;Of Men and Angels on Island Def Jam. The album debuted at No. 1 on iTunes, surpassing The Black Eyed Peas&#x27; The E.N.D. which had previously held the No. 1 spot for Top Album. To promote the new album, Avary performed the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Walls&quot; on KDFW&#x27;s &quot;Good Day Dallas&quot; and KTBC&#x27;s &quot;Good Day Austin&quot;.
The Rocket Summer toured with OneRepublic, Goo Goo Dolls and the 16th annual Vans Warped Tour in promotion of the record. 
On October 19, 2010, The Rocket Summer released a five-song digital-only EP, entitled &quot;Of Men and Angels: B-Sides&quot;.
Avary co-wrote the song &quot;Stomping The Roses&quot; for American Idol alum, David Archuleta which appeared on his second full-length album, &quot;The Other Side Of Down&quot; debuted in October 2010.

===2011–2014: &quot;Life Will Write the Words&quot; and &quot;Christmas Madness EP&quot; ===
On June 5, 2012, The Rocket Summer released their fifth full-length studio album, &quot;Life Will Write the Words&quot; on their own record label Aviate Records. It debuted 58 on The Billboard 200 and 12 on The &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums and 12 on the Top Independent Albums charts. This record was well received by fans who enjoyed a full Rocket Summer US Tour. Soon after releasing the album, the music video &quot;200,000&quot; debuted on Alternative Press.

The Rocket Summer digitally released &#x27;Christmas Madness EP&#x27; on Aviate Records December 3, 2013 debuting 45 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Independent Albums and performed two sold-out shows in Anaheim and Dallas to support this digital release.

===2015–2018: &quot;Zoetic, Do You Feel&quot; 10 Year Anniversary&quot;, Gone Too Long single&quot;===
Avary&#x27;s sixth full-length album &quot;Zoetic&quot; released on February 26, 2016. The album has received the most favorable reviews to date. Alternative Press magazine gave the album 4.5 of 5 stars stating &quot;the album proves true to its namesake by roaring to life with unyielding passion, authenticity and a whole lot of guitars.&quot; A music video was shot for the first single &quot;Same Air&quot; which features &quot;New Girl&quot; actress, Hannah Simone. New Noise Magazine writes &quot;This is undoubtedly The Rocket Summer&#x27;s best release, and it&#x27;s an album that no one expected.&quot; HM Magazine states &quot;The intimacy of his performances is impossible to shake, and with a new record that will no doubt be labeled his boldest, Zoetic&#x27;s bravery will go down in history.&quot; Paste Magazine wrote &quot;The Rocket Summer&#x27;s new album Zoetic proves Bryce a master at creating catchy, upbeat anthems.&quot;

The Rocket Summer performed a DJ set at Emo Nite in Los Angeles in December 2016.

In the summer of 2017, The Rocket Summer celebrated the 10 Year Anniversary of the album, &quot;Do You Feel&quot; which included a first time release of the album on vinyl and a headlining tour of North America and the UK. The vinyl album debuted #20 on the Billboard Vinyl Album Charts upon its release in June.

On July 7, Avary released a new song titled, &quot;Gone Too Long.&quot; Billboard writes &quot;the new track proves he is just as much of a force as ever. With a guitar-driven melody and impassioned lyrics, the one-man band is in top form in a song that will easily fit with the alt-pop tendencies of staples like &quot;So Much Love&quot; and &quot;You Gotta Believe.&quot; The track was released digitally and on a limited edition cassette tape which included an acoustic version of &quot;FL, CA&quot;, and was later included on &quot;Bee Sides: Select Rarities 2015-2020&quot;.

In the summer of 2018, The Rocket Summer went on an 26 city acoustic tour, supporting Sleeping with Sirens. Avary co-wrote, co-produced, and performed with Sleeping with Sirens on a single called &quot;Another Day&quot;, released on July 6, 2018.

=== 2019 - 2022: &quot;Sweet Shivers&quot;, B.A.treon Fun Club, &quot;Bee Sides: Select Rarities 2015-2020&quot; ===
&quot;Sweet Shivers&quot;, the seventh studio album by The Rocket Summer, was released on August 2, 2019. The album release was followed by &quot;The Rocket Summer US Tour 2019&quot;, beginning on September 10, 2019 and ending on October 19, 2019. Supporting acts included Royal Teeth, Mike Mains and The Branches, and Katelyn Tarver. The first single from the album, &quot;Shatter Us&quot;, was released on May 24, 2019. Billboard Magazine stated &quot;Sweet Shivers really is just the beginning.&quot;

On September 4, 2019, Avary launched the B.A.treon Fun Club through Patreon. Initial monthly perks for Fun Club subscribers included 2 unreleased tracks, &quot;q &amp; a hangs&quot;, occasional dissection of songs and mixes, merch and tour discounts, livestream music listening parties, and online livestream mini shows from Bryce&#x27;s studio. Different perks and subscription tiers were introduced on July 13, 2020.

On October 27, 2020, Avary announced a new album, &quot;Bee Sides: Select Rarities 2015-2020&quot;, to be released on November 13, 2020, containing 14 tracks. 11 of the 14 tracks had been previously released in the Fun Club. The announcement included a vinyl pre-order.

The Fun Club would go on what was believed to be a temporary pause beginning in March 2021, yet, as of 2023, the Club has remained defunct with the exception of two separate one-off months.

A new single, &quot;M4U&quot;, debuted digitally on November 18, 2022, and was followed by both a music video and cassingle release. The cassingle included a remixed version of the song, exclusive to the cassingle.

=== 2023 - Current: &quot;Shadowkasters&quot; and &quot;Calendar Days&quot; 20th Anniversary ===
A second single, &quot;Stuck Inside Your Light&quot;, was digitally released on January 20, 2023 and its release was accompanied by a music video.

On March 21, 2023, it was announced The Rocket Summer&#x27;s eighth studio album, &quot;Shadowkasters&quot;, would be released on May 12, 2023 and feature 11 tracks. A pre-order was launched the same day, to include vinyl variants, glow-in-the-dark cassettes, CDs, pins, hoodies, and shirts. Avary, &quot;A lot of this album has been done for quite some time and was made during the isolation period of the pandemic, so it&#x27;s almost like a compilation album of songs recorded over a couple of years that I felt made sense together in a sequence... Still, there was a different energy that fueled many of these songs that came from seeking joy by way of discovering, manipulating, and getting lost in new sounds because I was simply alone for so much of it. It is by far the most instrumentally nuanced album I&#x27;ve ever made.&quot; Recent singles &quot;M4U&quot; and &quot;Stuck Inside Your Light&quot; will be part of the album, and a third single, &quot;Sing At The Top&quot; would be released on March 24, 2023.

In November 2023, Avary announced he would be embarking on a 20th anniversary headlining tour of &quot;Calendar Days&quot; in early 2024. Avary, &quot;Celebrating 20+ years of The Rocket Summer by performing my first full-length album &quot;[C]alendar [D]ays&quot; in its entirety, as well as an additional set of songs from every album to date... [T]he album will indeed officially be 21 by the first show kick off, so I suppose it&#x27;s technically more like a raging 21st birthday party night after night.&quot; For the last show of the tour, in Dallas, a few members of Avary&#x27;s younger sister&#x27;s middle school choir who sang the background vocals on &quot;What We Hate, We Make&quot; joined him on stage for the song. A vinyl re-release of the album was made available prior to the tour and for sale during the tour.

A new single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Yourself&quot;, was digitally released on February 23, 2024.

==Musical style and influence==
Often labeled as indie rock power pop with emphasis on Avary&#x27;s distinctive vocals and instrumental diversity.

Rick Anderson of Allmusic described his music as a range of &quot;headlong blasts of pure power pop cheer&quot; to &quot;sonata form&quot; and ballads—all of which Anderson categorized as &quot;infectiously joyful.&quot; The Rocket Summer&#x27;s music is marked by his use of guitar, piano, bass, percussion, and melodic hooks.

<text>Toronto City Council is the governing body of the municipal government of Toronto, Ontario. Meeting at Toronto City Hall, it comprises 25 city councillors and the mayor of Toronto. The current term began on November 15, 2022.

==Structure==
The current decision-making framework and committee structure at the City of Toronto was established by the &quot;City of Toronto Act, 2006&quot; and came into force January 1, 2007. The decision-making process at the City of Toronto involves committees that report to City Council. Committees propose, review and debate policies and recommendations before their arrival at City Council for debate. Citizens and residents can only make deputations on policy at committees, citizens cannot make public presentations to City Council. The mayor is a member of all committees and is entitled to one vote.

There are three types of committees at the City of Toronto: the executive committee, four other standing committees, and special committees of council.

=== Executive committee ===
The executive committee is an advisory body chaired by the mayor. The executive committee is composed of the mayor, deputy mayor, and the chairs of the four standing committees who are appointed by the mayor and three &quot;at-large&quot; members appointed by City Council. The role of the executive committee is to set the City of Toronto&#x27;s priorities, manage financial planning and budgeting, labour relations, human resources, and the operation of City Council. The committee existed in the old City of Toronto beginning in 1969. Before that Toronto had a Board of Control, as did former cities North York and Etobicoke.

The executive committee makes recommendations to city council on:
* strategic policy and priorities
* governance policy and structure
* financial planning and budgeting
* fiscal policy (revenue and tax policies)
* intergovernmental and international relations
* Council operation
* Human resources and labour relations
=== Other committees ===
Following the sudden decision by the provincial government to reduce the size of City Council in summer 2018, the committee structure went under review. Before December 1, 2018, there were eleven other committees that reported to Toronto City Council. As of the 2022-2026 term, the four standing policy committees are:
There are five other committees that report to Council:

===Community councils===
All members of Toronto City Council serve on a community council. Community councils report to City Council but they also have final decision-making power on certain items, such as front yard parking and appointments to local boards and Business Improvement Areas. The city is divided into four community councils. Their meeting locations are as follows:

* Etobicoke and York – Etobicoke Civic Centre
* North York – North York Civic Centre
* Scarborough – Scarborough Civic Centre
* Toronto and East York – Toronto City Hall

==2022–2026 City Council==
The current council term began on November 15, 2022.

=== Present composition of Toronto City Council ===
===Vacancies===
Vacancies in a councillor&#x27;s seat may be filled in one of two ways, either by the holding of a by-election or through direct appointment of an interim councillor chosen by the council in an internal vote. Normally the council is allowed to decide which process to follow in each individual case; however, if the vacancy occurs after March 31 in the year of a regularly scheduled municipal election, then the vacancy must be filled by direct appointment as provincial law prohibits the holding of a by-election in the final six months of a council term.

Vacancies in the office of mayor must be filled by by-election unless the vacancy occurs after March 31 in an election year, in which case council appoints. There is no appointment option for mayoral vacancies before that time.

The process often results in public debate, however. The by-election process is widely seen as more democratic, while the appointment process is seen as less expensive for the city to undertake.

When the appointment process is followed, people who are interested in the appointment are asked to submit their names to the local community council for the area where the vacant seat is located; the community council then evaluates and interviews the applicants, and submits a recommendation to the full city council for a final vote. The full council can, however, reject the community council&#x27;s recommendation and choose a different candidate instead; in 2013, for example, the city council passed over former member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) Chris Stockwell, the recommended candidate of the Etobicoke Community Council, in favour of Peter Leon.

Usually, although there is no legal barrier to doing so, candidates for appointment are asked if they intend to run as a candidate in the next regular election, so that the appointed councillor does not gain an unfair incumbency advantage. Council cannot impose this restriction on appointees but nonetheless it usually factors into the debate. There have been instances in which appointed councillors have done so; most notably, Paul Ainslie did so in 2006 by running for re-election in a different ward than the one where he had been appointed, and after the ward boundaries were adjusted in 2018, former ward 28 councillor Lucy Troisi ran in the new ward 13 against the former ward 27&#x27;s elected incumbent Kristyn Wong-Tam. Peter Leon considered registering as a candidate in the 2014 election following his appointment as an interim councillor in 2013, but ultimately did not do so.

If a full byelection is pursued, however, then the winner of that by-election is &quot;not&quot; barred from running in the next regular municipal election.

In the event of a vacancy in the mayor&#x27;s office, the deputy mayor is immediately elevated to acting mayor on an interim basis until the permanent new mayor is selected in a by-election. Unlike a city council seat, however, a by-election must always be held, unless the vacancy occurs less than 90 days before a regular municipal election. The situation does not trigger additional council vacancies, however; the deputy mayor is not deemed to have vacated their council seat during the acting period, and a sitting councillor who runs in the mayoral by-election does not have to resign their council seat unless they win the election.

Three vacancies occurred during the 2010-14 council term. Doug Holyday resigned from council in 2013 after winning election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in a byelection, and was succeeded by Peter Leon. Adam Vaughan resigned from council in 2014 to contest a federal byelection for the House of Commons, and was succeeded by Ceta Ramkhalawansingh. Peter Milczyn resigned in 2014 after winning election to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 2014 election and was succeeded by James Maloney.

Since amalgamation there are five instances that a councillor died while in office:

* Frank Faubert - ward 16 councillor and former mayor of Scarborough died in 1999 (after about a year and a half into his council term). The seat was filled with by-election: filled by former Ward 43 councillor David Soknacki.
* Rob Ford - ward 2 councillor and former mayor of Toronto died in 2016, one year and three months into his council term. The seat was filled with by-election: won by Ford&#x27;s nephew and former Ward 1 public school trustee Michael Ford.
* Ron Moeser - ward 44 councillor and former Scarborough councillor died on April 18, 2017. The seat filled by an appointment with former city staffer Jim Hart.
* Pam McConnell - ward 28 councillor died on July 7, 2017, after being hospitalized for a health complication. The vacancy was filled by voting by members of council, who selected Lucy Troisi over rival Michael Creek.
* Jaye Robinson - ward 15 councillor died on May 16, 2024. The by-election scheduled for November 4 was filled by former school trustee Rachel Chernos Lin over her nearest rival, former mayoral candidate Anthony Furey.

=== Compensation ===
The Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 223 sets the salary of the mayor and city councillors and is annually adjusted to the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In 2022, the salary of a councillor is $120,502.20 and the salary of the mayor is $202,948.20.

== Staff ==

===City Clerk of Toronto===
The city clerk is the senior administrative officer of the municipal government of Toronto. The city clerk is charged with building public trust and confidence in the city government.

There are five divisions in the Clerk&#x27;s office:

* Corporate Information Management Services
* Member Services and Program Support
* Elections Services
* Strategic Protocol and External Relations 
* Secretariat

City clerk staff are seated in the diamond shaped table located in front of the speaker&#x27;s podium in the council chambers.

=== Sergeant-at-Arms ===
City Council has a sergeant-at-arms, who is present at each council and committee meeting as per Toronto Municipal Code Chapter 27-50 to ensure order and safety of all members. In 2014 a second post was created to have two sergeants-at-arms present during council meetings. They are posted on the floor or near the entrances beside the speaker&#x27;s desk.

==History==
===Original ward system===

Toronto was divided into a group of wards, each named after a Christian saint. In 1834, the city had five wards and the number of wards would expand to nine by 1891. While out of use for over a century, these ward names continue to appear in neighbourhood names and subway stations and, until the 1990s, provincial electoral districts. The old wards and their boundaries in their final form, used from 1871 to 1891, were:

* St. Andrew&#x27;s (named for Saint Andrew)- bounded by Dufferin, King, Queen, and Yonge Streets – St. Andrew&#x27;s Church (Toronto) is located within the ward
* St. David&#x27;s (named for Saint David) – bounded by Ontario, Don Mills Road (now Broadview Ave), Bloor and Queen
* St. George&#x27;s (named for Saint George) – bounded by King, Yonge, Dufferin Streets and lakefront
* St. Lawrence&#x27;s (named for Lawrence of Rome) – bounded by Queen, Yonge, lakefront, McGee
* St. Patrick&#x27;s (named for Saint Patrick) – bounded by Bloor, Bathurst, Queen and College Streets (now part of Trinity-Spadina) – St. Patrick&#x27;s Church is located within this ward
* St. John&#x27;s (either for John the Apostle or John the Baptist) – bounded by Yonge, university, Bloor and Queen. The area would continue to be known as The Ward up to the mid-20th century.
* St. Stephen&#x27;s (named for Saint Stephen) – bounded by Bathurst, Bloor, Queen and Dufferin Streets
* St. Thomas&#x27;s (named for Thomas the Apostle) – bounded by Jarvis, Ontario, Bloor, Queen Streets
* St. James&#x27;s (named for James, son of Zebedee) – bounded by Yonge, Jarvis, King and Bloor – Cathedral Church of St. James is located within the ward

By 1891, there were 13 wards, with three aldermen elected per ward: St. Alban&#x27;s, St. Andrew&#x27;s, St. David&#x27;s, St. George&#x27;s, St. James&#x27;s, St. John&#x27;s, St. Lawrence&#x27;s, St. Mark&#x27;s, St. Matthew&#x27;s, St. Patrick&#x27;s, St. Paul&#x27;s, St. Stephen&#x27;s, and St. Thomas&#x27;s.

When Yorkville was annexed in 1883, it became St. Paul&#x27;s Ward (named for Paul the Apostle or Saint Paul). When Riverdale was annexed in 1884, it became St. Matthew&#x27;s Ward (named for Matthew the Apostle or Saint Matthew). Brockton was also annexed in 1884, and it became the ward of St. Mark&#x27;s (named for Mark the Evangelist or Saint Mark). When Parkdale was annexed in 1889, it became St. Alban&#x27;s Ward (named for Saint Alban).

===Post-1891 ward structure===

In June 1891, the city approved a re-organization to Council changing the number of wards to six; each ward was known by a number. Each ward elected four aldermen. Over the next three decades three new wards were added, one each in the north, east, and west, as new areas were annexed to the City of Toronto. In 1896, the Board of Control executive branch of Council was established to handle all daily council business and report to Council. Mayor Robert John Fleming presided over the first Board of Control.

Eventually, the numbers of aldermen was reduced to two aldermen per ward as the number of wards was increased. When a higher level of municipal government, Metro Toronto, was introduced in 1953, the alderman with the most votes of the two elected councillors from each ward was also a member of Metro Council.

Until 1955 municipal elections were held annually, either on New Year&#x27;s Day or on the first Monday in December. In 1955 council moved to two-year terms, and in 1982 three-year terms were introduced. Along with the other municipalities of Ontario, Toronto moved to a four-year municipal term in 2006.

Starting in 1904 the Board of Control was elected directly. Until 1969 there was a four-person Board of Control in addition to city council. The board was elected at large across the city, and its members had considerably more power than the city councillors. In 1969, the Board of Control was abolished and the four controllers were replaced by four new councillors from two new wards. The ward map was rebalanced to give more equitable representation.

In 1985, the system of electing Metro councillors was changed so that two separate ballots were held in each ward, one for the city the other for Metro. In the next election, a separate set of wards was established for Metro councillors. Each Metro ward consisted of two city wards, each electing only one councillor.

With the amalgamation of the City of Toronto with the suburban municipalities of Metro in 1997, the councils of the six former cities were abolished. The new council for the &quot;megacity&quot; kept the ward map of Metro Toronto but doubled the number of councillors by adopting the system of electing two councillors from each ward. East York had only one ward and was thus greatly underrepresented. Former East York mayor Michael Prue lobbied successfully for a third councillor to be elected from that ward, and this was implemented mid-term.

This system was only used for the first megacity election. In 2000 a new ward map was devised based on the federal ridings (electoral districts) that covered Toronto. Each riding was split in half to create a 44-ward system.

===Current ward names since 2000===

The current ward names are based on the federal and provincial electoral districts, but some no longer shared the same name as those district names have changed since 2000.

===Political history===

When the City of Toronto was incorporated in 1834, a city council was created. It provided direct representation in the government of Toronto to the population. The Town of York had been governed by the then-province of Upper Canada, with electoral representation in the Upper Canada assembly.

The first councils were elected yearly. Each of the five wards elected two aldermen and two common councillors by the votes of male householders. The first councils were dominated by two factions: the Family Compact and its loyalists; and the reformers under the leadership of William Lyon Mackenzie, Member of Parliament for York. Mackenzie won election to Council and was elected by Council as the city&#x27;s first mayor, but was defeated in the next election, after proposing increased taxation. After the defeat of the Upper Canada Rebellion in 1837, the reformers were marginalized, as several were executed for treason, and others, such as Mackenzie, went into exile.

For the next century, the Tories dominated Toronto municipal politics, as they did the other levels in &quot;Tory Toronto&quot;. The Tories were associated with staunch Protestantism, shown through membership in the Orange Order, and support for the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot;.

In the 1930s, various forms of left-wing opposition arose to the Tory-dominated council. The Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) was founded in 1932. The pro-labour social democratic party found support in various working-class areas of Toronto and several of its members were elected to city council. Unaffiliated anti-poverty activists like May Birchard also were elected to Council in this era. An important faction in Toronto politics in the 1930s and 1940s were the communists. There was considerable communist support in the downtown areas covered by Ward 4 and Ward 5, especially in the heavily Jewish areas of Kensington Market and the Garment District around Spadina Avenue and further west along College and up to Christie Pits including what is now Little Italy. The peak of communist influence was in the 1946 election when leader Stewart Smith was elected to the Board of Control and three other communists won seats on city council. With the beginning of the Cold War and staunch opposition from the other political groups, the communist presence quickly disappeared. The last communist alderman lost his seat in 1950.

The first part of the 20th century was the era of the newspaper slates. Each of the daily newspapers would endorse a full slate of candidates for office. The two most influential were the right-wing &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot; and the more left-leaning &quot;Toronto Daily Star&quot;. In the early parts of the century, the duelling papers ran the communications portion of the campaign of the candidates they supported, using yellow journalism to extol those they supported and denigrate those they opposed. The newspaper slates did not have a unified ideology: all the papers claimed to be seeking a balanced council, making sure that groups such as labour and Roman Catholics had representation on the council. Beyond these few exceptions, the slates of all the papers were largely made up of male, white, Conservative, Orangemen. Many candidates also appeared on the slates of several newspapers. With the exception of James Simpson, who became Toronto&#x27;s first socialist mayor in 1935, the city&#x27;s mayors were Tories in the first half of the 20th century.

The character of Toronto politics began to change in the 1950s and 1960s as the Anglo Tory lock on power faded in the increasingly diverse city. In 1952, Orangeman Allan Lamport became the first Liberal elected mayor in over 40 years. He resigned to become TTC chair and his administration was implicated in a municipal corruption scandal. In 1954, Leslie Saunders, another Orangeman became interim mayor. His staunch defence of Protestantism became an issue in the 1954 election. Nathan Phillips, a long-serving Jewish alderman, was elected mayor. He was a staunch Tory. His religion was an important issue in the election, in which his opponent proclaimed himself to be running as &quot;Leslie Saunders, Protestant&quot;. The Orange Order influence dropped sharply. Only seven of 23 councillors elected that year were members of the Orange Order. Phillips was dubbed &quot;Mayor of all the People&quot; and governed in a non-partisan manner. During his term, Phillips enraged the Order by accepting funding from O&#x27;Keefe Brewing for the new O&#x27;Keefe Centre auditorium. In 1956, Phillips initiated the international architectural competition for a new City Hall.

In 1966, former CCF Member of Provincial Parliament William Dennison was elected mayor. He was an Orangeman and the last member of the Orange Order to be a Toronto mayor.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, a new division arose on city council between two groups that became known as the &quot;Reformers&quot; and the &quot;Old Guard&quot;. Both groups crossed party lines and were divided by their approach to urban issues. The Reform faction arose in opposition to the urban renewal schemes that had been in favour in the previous decades. Two key battles were over the proposal for the Spadina Expressway and the replacement of the Trefann Court neighbourhood with a housing project. The Reformers opposed the destruction of existing neighbourhoods and followed the urban theories of recent Toronto arrival Jane Jacobs. The Old Guard supported new highways and housing projects, in part because of their close ties to the development industry. The debate between the two groups became the central issue of the 1969 municipal election with mayoral candidate Margaret Campbell running on an explicit reform platform. Campbell lost the mayoralty, but on City Council, six veteran members of the Old Guard were defeated.

One example of the close ties was revealed in 1971; a conflict of interest case of alderman Ben Grys, who chaired the Buildings and Development Committee. His wife Gladys, bought properties in the High Park area, then resold them to a developer. Grys then helped get rezoning for the area to allow developers to increase the number of units they could build, without disclosing his interest. Alderman John Sewell learned of the Grys purchases through a resident of the area. Grys launched a lawsuit against Sewell but it was dropped. Grys was defeated in 1972, the same election that Reformer David Crombie was elected mayor. Crombie was mayor until 1978 and during his term, the city enacted a holding by-law to curb the development industry. In 1978, Crombie was succeeded by Sewell as mayor.

In 1980, Liberal Art Eggleton was elected mayor. Eggleton was mayor until 1991. During his term, Council enacted a new official plan to control redevelopment within the city. Council approved the redevelopment of the railway lands south-west of downtown. Eggleton negotiated the agreement to administer Toronto Island Airport, allowing scheduled airlines, but disallowing jets. Social housing was built and environmental programs were introduced by the city during that period.

In 1998, the Metro Toronto Council was merged with Toronto City Council. The amalgamation added the councillors from the other cities of Metro. The first mayor of the merged council was Mel Lastman, former mayor of North York. The council spent the term working on merging the departments of the various municipalities and working on funding for the increased services downloaded by the province. In 2003, David Miller became Toronto mayor. A new &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot; was enacted by the Province of Ontario and Council used the opportunity to introduce new tax measures to increase revenues for city services. A planned bridge to the Island Airport was cancelled.

In 2010, Councillor Rob Ford won the mayoralty on promises to cut taxes. During his term, Council cancelled the vehicle registration tax, the Toronto transit plan, made various department &#x27;essential services&#x27; and out-sourced some garbage pickup services. Council removed some of Ford&#x27;s mayoral powers following the disclosures of Ford&#x27;s drug abuse, giving powers to the deputy mayor. Although Ford ran for re-election, ill-health forced him to drop out. The mayoralty was won by John Tory, former leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives.

In 2017, after a petition to Council under the &quot;City of Toronto Act&quot;, Council initiated a process to revise its ward boundaries. The final result of the process was an increase to 47 seats. This was opposed in Court by several councillors, who ultimately failed in their challenge. In 2018, a newly elected Ontario government passed a bill, after the municipal election had started, to override the ward revisions and impose a 25-person council. This was overturned on September 10, 2018, after City Council and several private respondents challenged the law in Ontario Superior Court. The judge found that the Ontario government erred constitutionally in making the change during the election campaign, thus depriving voters and political candidates of their &quot;freedom of expression&quot; rights. After this decision, the provincial government decided to appeal the judge&#x27;s decision, and prepared a new version of the bill that would invoke the Notwithstanding clause to overrule the judge&#x27;s decision. On September 19, 2018, a 3 court panel of the Court of Appeal for Ontario unanimously granted a stay on the lower court&#x27;s ruling, thus setting the number of wards to 25, and removing the need to invoke the Notwithstanding clause. The decision was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in &quot;Toronto (City) v Ontario (Attorney General)&quot;.

<text>Visual communication is the use of visual elements to convey ideas and information which include (but are not limited to) signs, typography, drawing, graphic design, illustration, industrial design, advertising, animation, and electronic resources. This style of communication relies on the way one&#x27;s brain perceives the outside images. These images come together within the human brain making it as if the brain is what is actually viewing the particular image. Visual communication has been proven to be unique when compared to other verbal or written languages because of its more abstract structure. It stands out for its uniqueness, as the interpretation of signs varies on the viewer&#x27;s field of experience. The brain then tries to find meaning from the interpretation. The interpretation of imagery is often compared to the set alphabets and words used in oral or written languages. Another point of difference found by scholars is that, though written or verbal languages are taught, sight does not have to be learned and therefore people of sight may lack awareness of visual communication and its influence in their everyday life. Many of the visual elements listed above are forms of visual communication that humans have been using since prehistoric times. Within modern culture, there are several types of characteristics when it comes to visual elements, they consist of objects, models, graphs, diagrams, maps, and photographs. Outside the different types of characteristics and elements, there are seven components of visual communication: color, shape, tones, texture, figure-ground, balance, and hierarchy.

Each of these characteristics, elements, and components play an important role in daily lives. Visual communication holds a specific purpose in aspects such as social media, culture, politics, economics, and science. In considering these different aspects, visual elements present various uses and how they convey information. Whether it is advertisements, teaching and learning, or speeches and presentations, they all involve visual aids that communicate a message. In reference to the visual aids, the following are the most common: chalkboard or whiteboard, poster board, handouts, video excerpts, projection equipment, and computer-assisted presentations.

==Overview==
The debate about the nature of visual communication dates back thousands of years. Visual communication relies on a collection of activities, communicating ideas, attitudes, and values via visual resources, i.e. text, graphics, or video. The evaluation of a good visual communication design is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of aesthetics. Visual communication by e-mail, a textual medium, is commonly expressed with ASCII art, emoticons, and embedded digital images. Visual communication has become one of the most important approaches using which people communicate and share information.

The term &#x27;visual presentation&#x27; is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on web design and graphically-oriented usability.

===Important figures===
Aldous Huxley is regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories. Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness influenced his approach, and his work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;The Art of Seeing&quot;. He described &quot;seeing&quot; as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is &quot;The more you see, the more you know.&quot;

Max Wertheimer is said to be the father of Gestalt psychology. Gestalt means &quot;form&quot; or &quot;shape&quot; in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or color, continuity, and proximity. Additional laws include closure and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.

Kurt Koffka and Wolfgang Köhler are also prominent figures in early visual communication research. 

=== Image analysis ===
Visual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires image analysis. Images can be analyzed through many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by Paul Martin Lester: Personal, Historical, Technical, Ethical, Cultural, and Critical.
* Personal perspective: When a viewer has an opinion about an image based on their personal thoughts. Personal response depends on the viewer&#x27;s thoughts and values, individually. However, this might sometimes conflict with cultural values. Also when a viewer has viewed an image with a personal perspective, it is hard to change the view of the image on the viewer, .
* Historical perspective: An image&#x27;s view can be arising from the history of the use of media. Through times sort images have been changed, because the use of different (new) media. For example: The result of using the computer to edit images (e.g. Photoshop) is quite different when comparing images that are made and edited by craft.
* Technical perspective: When the view of an image is influenced by the use of lights, position and the presentation of the image. The right use of light, position and presentation of the image can improve the view of the image. It makes the image looks better than the reality.
* Ethical perspective: From this perspective, the maker of the image, the viewer and the image itself must be responsible morally and ethically to the image. This perspective is also categorized in six categories: categorical imperative, utilitarianism, hedonism, golden mean, golden rule, and veil of ignorance.
* Cultural perspective: Symbolization is an important definition for this perspective. Cultural perspective involves identity of symbols. The uses of words that are related with the image, the use of heroes in the image, etc. are the symbolization of the image. The cultural perspective can also be seen as the semiotic perspective.
* Critical perspective: The view of images in the critical perspective is when the viewers criticize the images, but the critics have been made in interests of the society, although an individual makes the critics. This way this perspective differs from the personal perspective.

=== Visual aid media: Simple to advanced ===
* Chalkboard or whiteboard: Chalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are available. They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility. The use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid. Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom. Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.
* Poster board: A poster is a very simple and easy visual aid. Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional. Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over. The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.
* Handouts: Handouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over. This can help the person better remember what was discussed. Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting. Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience&#x27;s attention. The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it. Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.
* Video excerpts: A video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech. There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture. First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk. Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting. The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.
* Projection equipment: There are several types of projectors. These include slide projectors, overhead projectors, and computer projectors. Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used. Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use. In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen. This takes time and costs money. Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors. When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen. Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.
* Computer-assisted presentations: Presentations through presentation software can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a deck of slides. For longer presentations, however, they can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track. A potential drawback of using them is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together. There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.

== Components ==
Components of visualization make communicating information more intriguing and compelling. The following components are the foundation for communicating visually. Hierarchy is an important principle because it assists the audience in processing the information by allowing them to follow through the visuals piece by piece. When having a focal point on a visual aid (i.e. Website, Social Media, Poster, etc...), it can serve as a starting point for the audience to guide them. In order to achieve hierarchy, we must take into account the other components: Color, Shape, Tones, Texture, Figure-Ground, Balance.

Colors is the first and most important component when communicating through visuals. Colors displays an in-depth connection between emotions and experiences. Additive and subtractive color models help in visually communicating aesthetically please information. Additive color model, also known as RGB color (Red, Green, Blue) goes from dark to light colors, while subtractive color model is the opposite. The subtractive color model includes the primary CMYK colors (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black) which go from light to dark. Shape is the next fundamental component that assists in creating a symbol that builds a connection with the audience. There are two categories that shapes can fall under: Organic or Biomorphic shapes, and Geometric or Rectilinear shapes. Organic or biomorphic shapes are shapes that depict natural materials (which include curvy lines), while Geometric or Rectilinear shapes are shapes that are created by man (including triangles, rectangles, ovals, and circles).

Tone refers to the difference of color intensity, meaning more light or dark. The purpose of achieving a certain tone is to put a spotlight on a graphical presentation and emphasize the information. Similarly, texture can enhance the viewers optics and creates a more personal feel compared to a corporate feel. Texture refers to the surface of an object, whether is it 2-D or 3-D, that can amplify a user&#x27;s content.

Figure-ground is the relationship between a figure and the background. In other words, it is the relationship between shapes, objects, types, etc. and the space it is in. We can look at figure as the positive space, and ground as the negative space. In comparison, positive space is the objects that hold dominance visually, while negative space (as mentioned previously) is the background. In addition to creating a strong contrast in color, texture, and tone, figure-ground can highlight different figures. As for balance, it is important to have symmetrical or asymmetrical balance in visual communication. Symmetrical balance holds a stable composition and is proper in conveying informative visual communication. As for asymmetrical balance, the balance of visuals is weighted more to one side. For instance, color is more weighted to one color than the other, while in a symmetrical balance all colors are equally weighted.

== Visual literacy ==
Studies often define visual literacy (or visual competence) as the ability to understand and process what is being seen in order to make sense of the world. Being visually literate has been shown to be an important aspect of life to those with sight. The function of sight itself has mechanisms that must work together in order to transform the lines, shapes, and colors around a person&#x27;s environment into a cohesive picture that can then hold meaning. These mechanisms are what occur in the human body that allow a person&#x27;s eye to make sense of what the viewer sees and then the signals that are sent to relay information to their brain to be processed. However, studies conducted state that visual intelligence is not something that is taught but rather observed. It is also noted within this study that this skill often goes unnoticed until it is impaired. This act of processing what is being seen has been shown to happen quickly and oftentimes without the viewer&#x27;s cognizant awareness.

The effect visual literacy has on a viewer has also been shown to influence aspects of their life such as, attitudes, values, beliefs, as well as cultural views. Scholars have noted how society and culture is often dominated by imagery, especially with the rise of mass technological media. The dominance of visuals in culture such as film, television and social media, have now been used by various companies for their advertisements. Presidential and political candidates have also turned to the media to visually promote their campaigns. With many of these advertisements present in everyday life, the viewers of this content may often be open to influence without being cognizant of it.

== Study of symbols ==

=== Semiotics ===
Semiotics is the study of signs and visuals within society that relay meaning. The symbols used in different cultures to convey a meaning also entails the hidden systems and functions that make up the symbols. Logos, gestures, and technological signs such as emoticons, are a few examples of symbols used in culture.

=== Semiology ===
The term semiology is the study of signs and symbols and their arrangements as a visual language. The characterization of what is considered a language is the existence of an alphabet that can be arranged to create meaning. An example of signs, or an alphabet, that can be arranged to create meaning are the 26 letters that make up the Modern English Alphabet which can then be used to compose written messages that can then be relayed orally. However, in semiology, the signs that create the alphabet of visual communication are more abstract than a written or verbal languages alphabet. In comparison to the English Alphabet, the visual alphabet is still being studied due to the various channels that may be used to relay visuals. Components of a still graphic compared to film, for instance. Another category of study within the field of semiotics is how the interpretation of visual signs depends on the experiences of the person interpreting the visual components of symbols, commonly referred to as the interpretant.

=== Theory of semiotics ===
Collectively, the study of visual imagery and gestures as a language has two major schools of thought. The contributors who are commonly referred to are; Charles Sanders Peirce and his descendants and Ferdinand de Saussure. Peirce&#x27;s school of thought is the meaning that the interpreter assigns to a particular sign instead of the study of the sign itself. His work focuses on the pragmatics, semantics, and structure of a symbol in visual communication. Saussure, however, focused primarily on the structure and value of a sign and its relation to other symbols within the language system. The school of thought that Saussure curated contributed to the rise of structuralism as well as later theories developed by various scholars in the field of communication.

== Prominence and motive ==

=== Social media ===

Social media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size. Despite the potential drawback, there has been a shift towards more visual images with the rise of YouTube, Instagram, and Snapchat. In the rise of these platforms, Facebook and Twitter, have followed suit and integrated more visual images into their platform outside the use of written posts. It can be stated that visual images are used in two ways: as additional clarification for spoken or written text, or to create individual meaning (usually incorporating ambiguous meanings). These meanings can assist in creating casual friendships through interactions and either show or fabricate reality. These major platforms are becoming focused on visual images by growing a multi-modal platform with users having the ability to edit or adjust their pictures or videos these platforms. When analyzing the relationship between visual communication and social media, four themes arise:
* Emerging genres and practices: The sharing of various visual elements allow for the creation of genres, or new arrangements of socially accepted visual elements (i.e. photographs or GIFs) based on the platforms. These emerging genres are used as self-expression of identity, to feel a sense of belonging of different sub-group of the online community.
* Identity construction: Similar to genres, users will use visuals through social media to express their identities. Visual elements can change in meaning over a period of time by the person who shared it, which means that visual elements can be dynamic. This makes visuals uncontrollable since the person may not identify as that specific identity, but rather someone who has evolved.
* Everyday public/private vernacular practices: This theme presents the difficulty of deciphering what is considered public, or private. Users can post the privacy from their own home, however, their post is interacting with users from the online public.
* Transmedia circulation, appropriation, and control: Transmedia circulation refers to visual elements being circulated through different types of media. Visual elements, such as images can be taken from one platform, edited, and posted to another platform without recognizing where it originally came from. The concept of appropriation and ownership can be brought into question, making aware the idea that if a user can appropriate another person work, then that user&#x27;s work can appropriated, as well.

=== Culture ===
Members of different cultures can participate in the exchange of visual imagery based on the idea of universal understandings. The term visual culture allows for all cultures to feel equal, making it the inclusive aspect of every life. When considering visual culture in communication, it is shaped by the values amongst all cultures, especially regarding the concepts of high and low-context. Cultures that are generally more high-context will rely heavily on visual elements that have an implied and implicit meaning. However, cultures that are low-context will rely on visual elements that have a direct meaning and rely more on the textual explanations. Visual communication can be defined in different ways (Volli 1994). An effective one is through opposition with signification (Volli 2010). Whereas visual signification can be unintentional, there is no communication without intentionality. A sunset &quot;signifies&quot; something, whereas a painting signifies something but also &quot;communicates&quot;, because culture marks it as product of communicative intentionality. However, imputation of intentionality changes across cultures and epochs. Whereas religion may see a sunset as a divine message, secular observers will attach to it an unintentional meaning of nostalgia.

=== Politics ===
Visual communication in politics have become a primary sense of communication, while dialogue and text have become a secondary sense. This may be due to the increased use of televisions, as viewers become more dependent on visuals. Sound bite has become a popular and perfected art among all political figures. Despite it being a favored mode of showcasing a political figure&#x27;s agenda, it has shown that 25.1% of news coverage displayed image bites - instead of voices, there are images and short videos. Visuals are deemed an essential function in political communication, and behind these visuals are 10 functions for why political figures use them. These functions include:
* Argument function: Although images do not indicate any words being said, this function conveys the idea that images can have an association between objects or ideas. Visuals in politics can make arguments about the different aspects of a political figure&#x27;s character or intentions. When introducing visual imagery with sound, the targeted audience can clarify ambiguous messages that a political figure has said in interviews or news stories.
* Agenda setting function: Under this function, it is important that political figures produce newsworthy pictures that will allow for their message to gain coverage. The reason for this is due to the agenda-setting theory, where importance of public agenda is taken into consideration when the media determines the importance of a certain story or issue. With that said, if politicians do not provide an interesting and attention-grabbing picture, there will likely be no news coverage. A way for a politician to gain news coverage, is to provide exclusivity for what the media can capture from a certain event. Despite not having the ability to control whether they receive coverage, they can control if the media gets an interesting and eye-catching visual.
* Dramatization function: Similar to agenda setting, the dramatization function targets a specific policy that a political figure wants to advocate for. This function can be seen when Michelle Obama promoted nutrition by hosting a media event of her planting a vegetable garden, or Martin Luther King Jr. producing visuals from his 1963 campaign for racial injustice. In some cases, these images are used as icons for social movements.
* Emotional function: Visuals can be used as a way to provoke an emotional response. A study that was performed found that motion pictures and video has more of an emotional impact than still images. On the other hand, research has suggested that the logic and rationality of a viewer is not barred by emotion. In fact, logic and emotion are interrelated meaning that images not only can have emotional arousal, but also influence viewers to think logically.
* Image-building function: Imagery gives a viewer a first impression of a candidate when they are running for office. These visuals give voters a sense of who they will be voting for during the elections, regarding their background, personality, or demeanor. They can create their image by appearing be family-oriented, religiously involved, or showing a commonality with the disadvantaged community.
* Identification function: Through the identification function, visuals can create an identification between political figures and audiences. In other words, the audience may perceive a type of similarity with the political figure. When a voter finds a similarity with a candidate they are more likely to vote for them. This is the same when a voter notices a candidate who does not have any perceived similarities, then they are less likely to vote for them.
* Documentation function: Similar to a stamp on a passport that indicated you have been to a certain country, photographs of a political figure can document that an event had happened and they were there. By documenting an event that occurred, there is evidence and proof for argumentative claims. If a political figure claims one thing, then there is evidence to either back it up or disprove it.
* Societal symbol function: This function is used in visuals when political figures use iconic symbols to draw on emotional power. For instance, political figures will stand with American flags, be photographed with military personnel, or even attending a sport. These three areas of societal symbols hold a strong sense of patriotism. In comparison, congressional candidates may be pictured with former or current presidents to gain an implied endorsement. Many places like the Statue of Liberty, Mount Rushmore, or the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier can be seen and iconic, societal symbols that hold a sense of emotional power.
* Transportation function: The transportation function of using visuals is to transporter the viewer to a different time or place. Visuals can figuratively bring viewers to the past or to an idealized future. Political figures will use this tactic as a way to appeal to the emotional side of their audience and get them to visually relate to the argument that is at hand.
* Ambiguity function: Visuals can be used to interpret different meanings without having to add any words. By not adding any words, visuals are normally used for controversial arguments. On the basis that visual claims can be controversial, they are held to a less strict standard compared to other symbols.

=== Economic ===
Economics has been built on the foundation of visual elements, such as graphs and charts. Similar to the other aspects of why visual elements are used, graphs are used by economists to clarify complex ideas. Graphs simplify the process of visualizing trends that happen over time. Along the same lines, graphs are able to assist in determining a relationship between two or more variables. The relationship can determine if there is a positive correlation or negative correlation between the variables. A graph that economists rely heavily on is a time-series graph, which measures a particular variable over a period of time. The graph includes time being on the X-axis, while a changing variable is on the Y-axis.

=== Science and medicine ===
Science and medicine has shown a need for visual communication to assist in explaining to non-scientific readers. From Bohr&#x27;s atomic model to NASA&#x27;s photographs of Earth, these visual elements have served as tools in furthering the understand of science and medicine. More specifically, elements like graphs and slides portray both data and scientific concepts. Patterns that are revealed by those graphs are then used in association with the data to determine a meaningful correlation. As for photographs, they can be useful for physicians to rely on in figuring out visible signs of diseases and illnesses.

However, using visual elements can have a negative effect on the understanding of information. Two major obstacles for non-scientific readers is: 1.) the lack of integration of visual elements in every day scientific language, and 2.) incorrectly identifying the targeted audience and not adjusting to their level of understanding. To tackle these obstacles, one solution is for science communicators must place the user at the center of the design, which is called User-Centered Design. This design focuses on strictly the user and how they can interact with the visual element with minimum stress, but maximum level of efficiency. Another solution could be implemented at the source, which is university-based programs. In these programs, universities need to introduce visual literacy to those in science communication, helping in producing graduates who can accurately interpret, analyze, evaluate, and design visual elements that further the understanding of science and medicine.

<text>The Minister of Police () was the leader and most senior official of the French Ministry of Police. It was a position in the Government of France from 1796 to 1818 and briefly from 1852 to 1853.

== History ==
The office was created on 2 January 1796 by taking police powers away from the Minister of Interior and giving them to the new Minister of Police. The move was motivated by an apparent overload of the Interior department. The first minister, Philippe-Antoine Merlin, was appointed two days later, as Armand-Gaston Camus refused the office. The most famous minister was Joseph Fouché, whose service spanned over a decade.

It was a major French ministerial position under the Directory, Consulate, First Empire, and Restored Bourbon Dynasty. The position was merged into the Ministry of Interior in 1818, although it was briefly restored by Napoleon III in 1852.

<text>A machine postmark or machine cancellation is a postmark or cancellation on mail that is applied by a mechanical device rather than with the use of a handstamp. Nearly all machine-cancellation devices apply both postmark and cancellation simultaneously. While some mail is cancelled using handstamps, machine cancellation is ubiquitous, and in the industrialized nations the vast majority of mail is cancelled by machine.

== United States ==
In the United States, the first successful postmarking machine was developed by Thomas Leavitt in the 1870s, with covers known from 1876. By 1880 Leavitt machines were in use in twenty cities. Cancellations were of a variety of forms, including horizontal and diagonal lines, as well as &quot;football&quot; shapes. The American Postal Machines Company soon got into the business, with postmarks appearing from 1884, and became successful with a machine known for its speed of processing.

APMC introduced the flag cancel in 1894, which used the wavy lines of the cancel to depict an approximate image of an American flag. During the 1890s dozens of other companies got into the business, although most were short-lived, and only about six, including Pitney-Bowes, lasted past the 1920s.

Slogan cancels also first appeared in the 1890s, initially to advertise the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York, gradually expanding to include a wide variety of uses. Slogans are commonplace today, with the US Postal Service still using them to promote special events, as well as to encourage better mailing practices (use of ZIP Code, proper addressing, etc.).

<text>John Byrne&#x27;s Next Men (also known as Next Men or JBNM) is an American comic book series written and drawn by John Byrne. The first volume of the series was published by Dark Horse Comics between 1991 and 1995. A nine-issue miniseries was published by IDW Publishing in 2010 and 2011, followed by another series titled &quot;Next Men: Aftermath&quot; in 2012.

==Publication history==
The Next Men characters made a prototypical appearance as &quot;Freaks&quot; in a lithography plate that was published within the &quot;History of the DC Universe Portfolio&quot; in 1986. Byrne had originally pitched the series to DC Comics, but the series never surfaced there. With some changes, Byrne changed the concept to fit in with his work on the graphic novel &quot;2112&quot;, to become the &quot;John Byrne&#x27;s Next Men&quot; series. Two characters from the &quot;Freaks&quot; artwork somewhat retained their physical looks and became the lead characters of the &quot;Next Men&quot; series: heroine Jasmine (aka &quot;Jazz&quot;) and villain Aldus Hilltop.

The Next Men officially debuted in a four–part storyline in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot; #54–57 (Sept.–Dec. 1991), later reprinted, in color, as &quot;John Byrne&#x27;s Next Men&quot; #0 (Feb. 1992). The series ran until issue #30 (Dec. 1994) and ended with a cliffhanger. According to Byrne, he intended the series to be science-fiction that had a &quot;sort of smell&quot; of being a super-hero book. In addition to exploring mature topics such as sex, abortion, and child abuse, Byrne also set aside some of the more-traditional conventions of the medium, such as &quot;thought-bubbles&quot; and sound-effects.

Byrne had intended to conclude the story in a second series after a six-month hiatus, but the financial weakness of the American comic-book industry in the mid-1990s made it financially unfeasible for him to do so, and he returned to working for hire at DC Comics and Marvel Comics.

On October 12, 2007, Byrne announced on his website that comic publisher IDW would release black and white &quot;phonebook&quot;-sized reprints of the &quot;Next Men&quot; series sometime in 2008, with the first collection released in May 2008. He stated on his message board:
In an interview with IDW appearing in the publisher&#x27;s April 2008 comic books, when asked about the possibility of a new &quot;Next Men&quot; series, Byrne answered,
At the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con, Byrne revealed that he was creating new issues of &quot;JBNM&quot; to be published by IDW Publishing. Byrne said that the new series would be both a continuation of the previous series as well as a place for new readers to discover the characters. He expected the entire story, previous series plus new series, to run about 50 issues. IDW&#x27;s John Byrne&#x27;s Next Men #1 was released on December 15, 2010.

It was announced in February 2011 that Byrne would finish the &quot;Next Men&quot; series with issue #9 of the 2010–2011 series, but a sequel titled &quot;Next Men: Aftermath&quot; immediately followed.

==Synopsis==
===First series (Dark Horse, 1991–1995)===
In 1955, an explosion in Antarctica draws the attention of a group of scientists. There they discover dozens of charred bodies, some of which do not appear to be human. Among them is a creature in a mechanical exoskeleton, named Sathanas, who kills all but one of the scientists, whom Sathanas uses to meet Senator Aldus Hilltop. Together, with Sathanas&#x27; existence kept secret, the three construct &quot;Project Next Men&quot;, whose goal is to create superhumans. The project used babies who were given up for adoption by single mothers. Due to Hilltop&#x27;s racial concerns, all of the mothers were white. The children were experimented on and grew to maturity in a lab while in their minds they experienced an idyllic virtual-reality world.

Eventually five of these &quot;Next Men&quot; manage to escape from confinement, but once free, they find that their powers are very greatly enhanced from how they were in their virtual world. The Next Men are:

*Nathan, whose mutated eyes allow him to see a wide spectrum of light. Team leader.
*Jasmine, a young super-acrobat. Nathan nicknames her &quot;Jazz&quot;.
*Jack, who is super-strong but cannot control his strength.
*Bethany, who is invulnerable to harm to the point of having razor-sharp hair, but who loses physical sensation and whose skin bleaches white.
*Danny, who can run at superhuman speeds.

After escaping from the Project, the Next Men have a number of interactions with outsiders, including a previous escapee who is deformed. Eventually, they are taken in by a US government agent, Tony Murcheson, who works for an individual known as Control. Murcheson works as their handler from that point in the series, intervening when she can and offering a reality check to her naive charges. During their first official mission in Russia, the Next Men are captured. Jasmine, afraid they will be killed, seeks solace in the arms of teammate Nathan, and the two unknowingly conceive a child. Meanwhile, Danny, the youngest member of the team who was not allowed to go on the mission, goes on a quest to find his birth mother. Reunited with her, she reveals the identity of his father: Aldus Hilltop. Afterward, his new half-sister convinces Danny to take her away from their abusive mother. The two run off to New York City, where Danny hopes to meet his hero, the fictional comic-book character, Action Maxx. He finds instead the character&#x27;s publisher, who decides to exploit Danny and the other Next Men for a new comic-book series, once Danny convinces him that his claim of having superpowers is real. This brings the Next Men to the attention of law-enforcement authorities investigating the damage left in the wake of the Next Men&#x27;s escape from the Project. After a publicity stunt for their upcoming comic book, the Next Men are arrested, tried and convicted on multiple counts of murder. Before they can be sent to prison, Murcheson helps the Next Men escape, and the team lives for a time in a subterranean community of the homeless and disenfranchised.

During his time at the comic-book publisher, Danny is befriended by a young woman named Sandy who is in charge of babysitting him. The two eventually have sex, and the woman goes on to develop reality-altering powers. These powers cause her to go crazy and attempt to remake the island of Manhattan. Once she is stopped by the Next Men, it is discovered that the powers which they have are sexually contagious; anyone who has sex with one of the Next Men will develop their own superhuman abilities.

As the series progresses, Sathanas continues to influence Senator Hilltop, who becomes Vice President and then President, and attempts to manipulate the Next Men for his own ends. As part of this effort, he brainwashes Jasmine into believing that she is his wife and that her time with the Next Men was merely an involved dream. Towards the end of the series, Hilltop has sex with Jasmine and develops powers similar to Sathanas, leading him to realize that Sathanas is in fact a future version of himself in an example of a predestination paradox.

In issue #7, a backup story, &quot;M4&quot; (Mark IV) started. It dealt with an android, Mark IV, or &quot;Mark Ivey&quot; as one character called him. Initially appearing as a separate storyline, eventually the series started to tie into the &quot;Next Men&quot; storyline, and finally merged with it in issue #23.

===Second series (IDW, 2010–2011)===
The 2011 miniseries (which Byrne labels with a &quot;3&quot; in superscript beside each issue number, to continue the numbering of the original series) expands on the time-travel and alternate-reality plots from the initial series, picking up from the cliffhanger ending by stranding each teammate and Agent Murcheson in divergent time periods. Nathan ends up stranded in Nazi Germany and is experimented on by a Nazi scientist. Jasmine is stranded in Elizabethan era England, and succumbs to the Plague. Murcheson is stranded in the South during the American Civil War and is forced into slavery; she later escapes and uses her knowledge of the past to prevent the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Bethany is stranded in a futuristic setting by an unknown captor, who claims to be punishing her friends for having betrayed her.

It is later revealed that Bethany&#x27;s captor is Bethany herself, who came from a future alternate timeline where an accident left her buried alive for over 200 years and drove her insane. Having been retrieved by scientists who mastered control over time, she ended up travelling to the past and kidnapped her former friends to scatter them throughout time. Soon, the scientists who retrieved Bethany arrive to stop her. They then retrieve Jasmine and Nathan, and one of the scientists, Gil, reveals to them his intention to send them back in time one last time to prevent Sathanas from arriving in 1955 (thereby undoing the events of the original Next Men series).

Jasmine, who has second thoughts about the mission, backs out, leaving Nathan and Bethany to go alone. Having successfully arrived in 1955, Bethany explodes a bomb which prevents the arrival of Sathanas and his mutates.

A sequel series, titled &quot;Next Men: Aftermath&quot;, by Byrne was published by IDW after the conclusion of the &quot;Next Men&quot; series proper. The sequel continued the numbering from the original series, starting with #40 and concluding with #44.

<text>Mempricius (&quot;Welsh:&quot; Membyr) was a legendary king of the Britons, as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He came to power in 1060BC. He was the son of King Maddan, brother of Malin, and father of king Ebraucus.

==War==
Upon his father&#x27;s death, war broke out between Mempricius and his brother, Malin, over who would dominate Britain. Mempricius called a conference with his brother and other delegates to end the war between the two brothers. Once there, Mempricius killed Malin and took the throne of the Britons for himself.

==Tyranny==
He ruled as a tyrant for 20 years, killing most of the distinguished men on the island. More so, he defeated and killed all other claimants to the throne. He abandoned his wife and his son, Ebraucus, to live a life of sodomy.

According to Geoffrey of Monmouth, he reigned at the same period of time as Saul, the King in Judea, and Eurysthenes, King in Sparta.

==Death==
While on a hunting expedition, he was separated from his companions and attacked by a pack of wolves. He died and was succeeded by his son Ebraucus as monarch.

<text>Legend of the Liquid Sword is a 1993 Hong Kong &quot;wuxia&quot; comedy film loosely based on Gu Long&#x27;s &quot;Chu Liuxiang&quot; novel series. The film was written and directed by Wong Jing and stars Aaron Kwok as the titular protagonist. The film inspired the title of American rapper GZA&#x27;s albums &quot;Liquid Swords&quot; (1995) and &quot;Legend of the Liquid Sword&quot; (2002).

==Plot==
The young Chor Lau-heung learns martial arts from Tuk-ku Kau-pai and has attained a high level of skill. His teacher sends him to Shaolin Monastery to attend a contest that is held once every ten years. On the journey, Chor meets Wu Tit-fa and Chung-yuen Yat-dim-hung. When Chor arrives at Shaolin, he fights with a Shaolin student called Mo-fa but neither of them is able to defeat each other. They decide to have a match again on another day. One night, Chor meets Mo-fa and strike up a conversation with her. Both of them decide to enter the palace in search of adventure. They disturb the prince on his wedding night but are accidentally caught in a trap and only manage to escape with the help of Chor&#x27;s friends.

Meanwhile, Bat Prince breaks into Shaolin and kills Mo-fa&#x27;s teacher, Tuk-ku Kau-pai and the Demonic Cult&#x27;s leader. Bat Prince is actually the son of a Japanese ninja called Tin-fung Sap-say-long, and he wants to avenge his father. 17 years ago, his father came to challenge the three best fighters in China, but was defeated and committed suicide in shame. Bat Prince is not satisfied even after his victory and wants to dominate the Chinese martial arts world. Chor is injured by Bat Prince in a fight and loses his powers. Mo-fa brings him to the Holy Water Palace for treatment. Sui-mo Yam-kei heals Chor&#x27;s wounds and teaches him new skills. Chor faces the Bat Prince in an epic battle.

Mei Ah Entertainment released a dual-subtitle DVD that they have since taken out of print. Xenon Pictures handled the U.S. release which basically contains the Mei Ah version with the only difference that the entire opening sequence was replaced with a card reading simply &quot;Liquid Sword.&quot; The original burned-in subtitles are used.

==Video==
The full uncut print runs 12 minutes longer than the Mei Ah (Hong Kong) and Xenon (U.S.) releases and was released in Taiwan on video by ERA Home Video.

<doc id="669151" wikidata="Q541440" url="?curid=669151" title="African paradise flycatcher">
<text>The African paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone viridis) is a medium-sized passerine bird. The two central tail feathers of the male are extended into streamers that commonly are more than twice as long as the body. The female tail feathers are of moderate length and without streamers. The upper parts of the male body, wings, and tail are boldly coloured in chestnut or rusty shades, but the underparts and the head are variably grey to blue-gray, with the head of the mature male being darker, commonly glossy black with greenish highlights. The beak and other bare areas, including a wattle ring round the eye, match the colour of the surrounding feathers. The female coloration is similar, though not so showy and glossy and with the head paler.

The African paradise flycatcher feeds mainly on insects. It builds a neat cup nest in which it lays a clutch, usually of two or three eggs. It generally inhabits open forest and savanna, and is a locally common resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The African paradise flycatcher was originally described in the genus &quot;Muscicapa&quot;. Alternate names include the grey-headed paradise flycatcher, red-winged paradise-flycatcher and Southern paradise-flycatcher.

===Subspecies===
Ten subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;T. v. harterti&quot; - : Found on southern Arabian Peninsula
* &quot;T. v. viridis&quot; - : Found from Senegal and Gambia to Sierra Leone
* &quot;T. v. speciosa&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found from southern Cameroon to south-western Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo and north-eastern Angola
* Abyssinian paradise-flycatcher (&quot;T. v. ferreti&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found from Mali and the Ivory Coast to Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania
* &quot;T. v. restricta&quot; - : Found in southern Uganda
* &quot;T. v. kivuensis&quot; - : Found from south-western Uganda to eastern Democratic Republic of Congo and north-western Tanzania
* Swaheli paradise-flycatcher (&quot;T. v. suahelica&quot;) - : Formerly classified as a separate species by some authorities. Found in western Kenya and northern Tanzania
* &quot;T. v. ungujaensis&quot; - : Found in eastern Tanzania and nearby islands
* &quot;T. v. plumbeiceps&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found from Angola to south-western Tanzania, Mozambique and northern South Africa
* &quot;T. v. granti&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in eastern and southern South Africa

==Description==
The adult male African paradise flycatcher is about long, but the very long tail streamers double this. It has a black head, neck and underparts, and chestnut wings and tail. There is a prominent white wingbar. The female has a browner tint to the underparts and lacks the wingbar and tail streamers. Young birds are similar to the female but duller.

The males show considerable variation in plumage in some areas. There is a morph of this species in which the male has the chestnut parts of the plumage replaced by white, and some races have black tail streamers.

This species readily hybridizes with the genetically similar Rufous-vented paradise flycatcher. The red-bellied paradise flycatcher is also closely related to this species, and hybrids occur with the underparts a mixture of black and red.

==Distribution and habitat==

The African paradise flycatcher is found in most parts of Africa south of the Sahara Desert and also the Arabian Peninsula. Its typical habitat is savannah woodland, open grassland with isolated trees, plantations, open woodland and scrubland.

==Behaviour==
The African paradise flycatcher is a noisy bird with a harsh scolding call. It has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a shrike. It is insectivorous, often hunting by catching flies on the wing, and eating eggs, larvae and adults. It also feeds on spiders and sometimes consumes berries. The cup-shaped nest is built in a tree and a clutch of two or three eggs are laid.

<doc id="669155" wikidata="Q178092" url="?curid=669155" title="British Columbia Highway 5A">
<text>Highway 5A is Highway 5&#x27;s pre-1986 alignment south of Kamloops. Unlike the main route, a section of BC Highway 5 known as the Coquihalla, which is a twinned highway consisting of at least 4 lanes at any given point, the 182 km (113 mi) long Highway 5A is only two lanes, with one four lane section between Highway 5 and Highway 97C (known as the Okanagan Connector), lasting along BC Highway 5A for approximately 23 km (14 mi).

==Route details==

Starting at the junction of the Crowsnest Highway (Highway 3) in Princeton, Highway 5A goes through of undeveloped land north to its junction with the Okanagan Connector (Highway 97C) at Aspen Grove. Past Aspen Grove, Highway 5A and Highway 97C travel in a shared designation northwest for 23 km (14 mi) in a four lane alignment before intersecting the Coquihalla Highway 5 and Highway 8 at Merritt. After a gap, Highway 5A continues north northeast for 89 km (55 mi), passing through the community of Quilchena, before terminating within Kamloops at its junction with Highways 5, 1 and 97 (which are overlapped at the point where 5A terminates).

Highway 5A used to circle through Merritt for 7 km (4 mi), following Nicola Street (Highways 8 and 97C) and Voght Street, to its second crossover of Highway 5 in the north area of Merritt; however, it was dropped by the province in 2008. The two segments can be access by either traveling through Merritt or following Highway 5. The city of Merritt has left most 5A signage in place.

Highway 5A is often considered to be a back country highway due to its low traffic volumes and features unusual to highways (e.g. cattle guards). Highway 5A between Aspen Grove and Merritt saw major upgrades in the late 1980s to prepare for the opening of the Okanagan Connector, but still remained two lanes for several years after. When the Okanagan Connector opened on October 1, 1990, the Hamilton Hill section was moved to a new four lane alignment north of the former route which can still be accessed by following a short dirt trail from the traffic light near the Coquihalla and 97c interchange. Controversial plans once called for the Okanagan Connector to continue past Aspen Grove and Highway 5A to meet with Highway 5 south of Merritt. When it became apparent that this extension was unlikely, the highway was four lanes in stages from Aspen Grove to the Hamilton Hill Brake Check. Although upgraded for Okanagan Connector traffic, Highway 5A from Aspen Grove to Merritt is not considered to be a freeway, due to its numerous at-grade intersections and undivided nature. The speed limit on this stretch is 110 km/h, which is 10 km/h lower than both the Okanagan Connector and the Coquihalla Highways.

<text>Cylindrical perspective is a form of distortion caused by fisheye and panoramic lenses which reproduce straight horizontal lines above and below the lens axis level as curved while reproducing straight horizontal lines on lens axis level as straight. This is also a common feature of wide-angle anamorphic lenses of less than 40mm focal length in cinematography, as well as the basis for creating the 146-degree peripheral vision of Cinerama when projected into a matching, cylindrically curved screen.

<text>One of France&#x27;s Secretaries of State under the Ancien Régime was entrusted with control of the French Navy (Secretary of State of the Navy (France).) In 1791, this title was changed to Minister of the Navy. Before January 1893, this position also had responsibility for France&#x27;s colonies, and was usually known as Minister of the Navy and Colonies, a role thereafter taken by the Minister of the Overseas. In 1947 the naval ministry was absorbed into the Ministry of Defence, with the exception of merchant marine affairs which had been split in 1929 to the separate Ministry of Merchant Marine.

== History ==

The two primary formations of the French Navy, the Ponant Fleet and Levant Fleet, were placed under the control of Jean-Baptiste Colbert in 1662, whilst he was &quot;intendant des finances&quot; and &quot;minister of state&quot; – but not &quot;secretary of state&quot; : he only became secretary of state in 1669 after having bought his way into the post. From then on, right up to the French Revolution, a secretary of state had responsibility for the French navy.

The secretary of state was responsible for the administration of both the navy (the &quot;marine royale&quot;) and civilian (merchant marine) fleets, and for all France&#x27;s ports, arsenals, consulates, and colonies, as well as the guardianship for all her commercial companies.

To his two original offices (the bureau du Ponant and bureau du Levant) other services were added over time:

*archives department, 1669; 
*office of the Ponant consulates, 1709; 
*office of the colonies, 1710; 
*bureau des classes, 1711; 
*department of maps and plans, 1720; 
*Office of the Levant Consulates, 1738, which was in 1743 merged with the Office of the Ponant Consulates under the name of Office of Commerce and Consulates

These different offices and departments were regrouped into four super-departments by marshal de Castries in 1786.

<doc id="669163" wikidata="Q2168182" url="?curid=669163" title="Ebraucus">
<text>Ebraucus (/Efrog) was a legendary king of the Britons, as recounted in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistory &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (). Later estimations from the dates given in the text place the events of this story around 1040 BC. He was the son of King Mempricius and father of Brutus Greenshield.

==&quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;==
According to the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, Ebraucus was the son of King Mempricius, who ruled as a tyrant for twenty years, abandoning his wife and young Ebraucus, &quot;and addicted himself to sodomy&quot;. Following the death of his father, Ebraucus became king and reigned for 39 years. He is described as being admired, tall, and remarkably strong. He was the first to wage war on the Gauls since the time of Brutus. By pillaging the cities and shores and slaughtering many men, he became extremely wealthy and enriched the lands of Britain.

He founded two settlements: Kaerebrauc, the City of Ebraucus (Eboracum), north of the Humber (this later became York, whose Welsh name is &quot;Efrog&quot;); and Alclud in Albany (now part of Dunbarton, capital of Strathclyde).

He had twenty wives who produced twenty sons and thirty daughters, including Galaes &quot;the most celebrated beauty at that time in Britain or Gaul&quot;. All his daughters he sent to his cousin Silvius Alba in Alba Longa (Italy) to be married to the other Trojan descendants. Except for Brutus Greenshield, all of Ebraucus&#x27;s sons, led by Assaracus, went to Germany, creating a kingdom there. Brutus Greenshield thus succeeded Ebraucus upon his death.

==Later tradition==
&quot;Brutus&quot; (), the first major poem based on the &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;, was written to celebrate the founding of York, and ends with lines about Ebraucus:

Alexander Neckam&#x27;s () also mentions him, saying &quot;Behold what a city the blessed Ebraucus built!&quot;

Others expanded on the story of Ebraucus, including two chronicles of the Church of York from the fourteenth century. According to Polydore Vergil he &quot;builded the town of Maidens, now called Edinburgh Castle, being planted in the uttermost part of Britain, now called Scotland&quot;. The &quot;Registrum Malmesburiense&quot; also says he built the &quot;castle of Montrose&quot;. Giacomo Filippo Foresti claimed he founded many cities and reigned sixty years.

When Henry VII reached York on his progress through the country in 1486, he was met by an actor playing Ebraucus, who described himself as &quot;the begynner of the same [citie] callid Ebrauk&quot;, who presented Henry with the keys of the city &quot;thenheritaunce [the inheritance] of the said Ebrauk&quot;, declared Ebraucus&#x27; achievements as conqueror of France, and reminded Henry that Ebraucus, his supposed ancestor, had founded the city, in an attempt to diffuse any potential hostility the king may have felt for its previous support for Richard III.

In York, an ancient statue traditionally said to depict Ebraucus, and called &quot;Old York&quot;, stood at the junction of St Saviourgate and Colliergate, where it served as a boundary marker in the fifteenth century. It may originally have been part of a Roman monument. In 1501, the statue was &quot;was taken doun, newe maid and transposed from thens&quot; to the Guildhall, and a tablet was inscribed to mark its original location, saying &quot;Here stood the image of York&quot; (this tablet is now in the Yorkshire Museum). According to Thomas Gent, the statue was moved from the site of Mansion House to inside the Guildhall during the construction of Mansion House in 1726. This repaired or replacement statue, which depicted a king in armour, crowned, and holding an orb and sceptre, was transferred to a niche at Bootham Bar city wall gatehouse in 1738, where it remained until 1834.

<doc id="669165" wikidata="Q1438261" url="?curid=669165" title="Mahindra United FC">
<text>Mahindra United Football Club (formerly known as Mahindra &amp; Mahindra) was an Indian professional football club based in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Founded in 1962, the club competed in the I-League, then top tier of Indian football league system, before closing down at the end of 2009–10 season. Affiliated with Mumbai Football Association, the club participated in both the National Football League, and MDFA Elite League.

Nicknamed &quot;Jeepmen&quot;, the club was popularly referred as India&#x27;s MU after the English Premier League powerhouse Manchester United. It was one of the most popular football clubs in the country and was known for its consistent good performance in the last four decades of its existence. The club had won many major tournaments in India, and also clinched an international tournament, 2003 POMIS Cup in the Maldives.

==History==
===Formation and journey===

The club was founded in 1962 as the &quot;Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Allied Sports Club&quot; under the patronage of Mahindra Group. Being predominantly a corporate sporting entity, they secured admission into Bombay&#x27;s Harwood League in 1964 and won the first title in 1970. Players like renowned goalkeeper E.N. Sudhir appeared with the club at that time. The club later lifted its first knock-out tournament, Bandodkar Gold Trophy in 1980. The club later became Durand Cup champion in 1998, under coaching of legendary football manager Syed Shahid Hakim, and went on to clinch the title again in 2001–02.

====In leagues of Mumbai====
Since their inception, Mahindra became a member of Western India Football Association (WIFA) and later in 1983, became affiliated with Mumbai District Football Association (formerly &quot;BDFA&quot;). They participated in later editions of Bombay Harwood League alongside Maharashtra Football League, and won the Harwood League four times in 1970, 1982, 1984 and 1985.

Mahindra later participated in W.I.F.A. Super Division from 1990 to 1999 and clinched WIFA title in 1995.

They later participated in MDFA Elite Division and lifted trophies consecutively from 2000 to 2004 and 2006 to 2009.

===NFL and other domestic competitions===
From 2002 to 2003, Czech coach Karel Stromšík managed club in the National Football League. In the summer of 2006, it was renamed to &quot;Mahindra United&quot;. The shirt colour was also changed from orange to red.

Team played its NFL home matches at the Cooperage Ground in Mumbai, but due to the bad state of the stadium, as of February 7, 2006, they had to play almost all of their NFL games at away venues.

Mahindra were crowned champions of NFL Premier Division for the first time in club&#x27;s history in the 2005–06 season, with two games to spare. They followed it up by beating their arch-rivals, Air India for the first time in the season. They are also two-time winners of the Indian Federation Cup, having won the title in 2003 and 2005. The win in 2005 ensured that Mahindra became the first club in the history of Indian football to win the Federation Cup and National Football League double in the same season.
They did however lose the NFL Super Cup to East Bengal by a margin of 1–2.

===Later years===

In the 2006 edition of IFA Shield, Mahindra United emerged as champions, defeating Mohun Bagan AC by 1–0 in Kolkata. They also participated in the 2006 Federation Cup and achieved third place, defeating Dempo SC 4–2 in the penalty-shootout. In the 2008 edition of IFA Shield, they defeated South African side Santos FC by 3–1 to win the title.
Head coach of the team was Derrick Pereira. Players like Subhashish Roy Chowdhury, Manjit Singh and Surojit Bose have been associated with the team. The club also tried forming under-15 and under-19 teams in order to nurture the young talent in the country.

==Stadium==

Mahindra United mainly used Cooperage Football Ground. It is located in Nariman Point, Mumbai, The stadium hosted home matches of both the National Football League and I-League, alongside MDFA Elite League; It had a seating capacity of nearly 12,000 spectators.

==Rivalry==
During the existence and playing days, Mahindra United shared rivalry in the NFL, predominantly with fellow Mumbai-based club Air India.

==Disbanding the club==
In 2010, it was announced that club will be disbanded after the end of the 2009–10 I-League. The decision was a major blow for football in Mumbai, and financial reason was one of the main factors behind it. Alan Durante, the chairman of Mahindra United, who had been with the team since 1991 and under whom Mahindra have won almost everything in Indian football, said it wasn&#x27;t about costs.

Ruzbeh Irani, executive vice-president of the club, said: &quot;It was in line with our group&#x27;s philosophy and shift, from taking part in professional sport to developing it. We feel we can make much difference to sport in India at the school level in football, instead of running a professional team.&quot; Due to the dysfunction of Mahindra United, the All India Football Federation allowed AIFF XI to take part in I-League directly.

==Achievements==
===Overall===
Mahindra United had won almost all the major competitions in India until its dissolution. The club was one-time winner of the National Football League. It was also the first team from Maharashtra to win the Harwood League and Nadkarni Cup three times in a row, and also first team from the state to compete in domestic highest division. The club has also been two-time winner of IFA Shield and Federation Cup. There are several other championships like Mammen Mappillai Cup, Rovers Cup, Chief Minister&#x27;s Cup and Super Cup where Mahindra United has registered victories.

On international level, Mahindra United achieved success through lifting the 2003 POMIS Cup trophy in the Maldives, beating Club Valencia 3–1. They also became the first Indian club to reach the quarter-finals of the 2007 AFC Cup, but their journey ended with an aggregate 4–5 defeat to Lebanese side Al-Najmeh SC. In 2003, Debjit Ghosh of Mahindra United, won &quot;IndianFootball.com&quot; &#x27;player of the Year&#x27; award.

===Ranking===
Mahindra United emerged as top ranked Indian team, and 464 universally, in the international rankings of clubs during the first ten years of the 21st century (2001–2010), issued by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics in 2011.

===Individual===
In three consecutive seasons, Indian players (while representing Mahindra United) have been awarded the AIFF Player of the Year: S Venkatesh in 2004, Climax Lawrence in 2005, and Surkumar Singh in 2006.

<doc id="669168" wikidata="Q2448083" url="?curid=669168" title="Brutus Greenshield">
<text>Brutus Greenshield () was a legendary king of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He was the son of King Ebraucus and came to power in 1001BC.

==Geoffrey&#x27;s account==
According to Geoffrey, Brutus, called Greenshield (&quot;Latin:&quot; &quot;Viridescutum&quot;), was the eldest of twenty sons and the only remaining son of Ebraucus in Britain at the time of his death. All Ebraucus&#x27;s other sons were in Germany establishing a new kingdom there. He reigned for twelve years after his father&#x27;s death. He was succeeded by his son, Leil. This is all that Geoffrey says of him.

==In Elizabethan culture==
Polydore Vergil says that Greenshield &quot;was greatly renowned neither at home nor in warfare&quot;. However, in Elizabethan England he acquired a reputation as a great warrior who is supposed to have led an expedition against the French at Hainaut. Michael Drayton refers to him in &quot;Poly-Olbion&quot; as &quot;Brute Green-Shield, to whose name we providence impute / Divinely to revive the land&#x27;s first conqueror, Brute&quot;. Greenshield&#x27;s supposed conquest of Hainaut is also described in Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, in which it is stated that &quot;to repair his father&#x27;s loss&quot; he fought &quot;a second battle at Henault with Brunchild [Prince of Hainaut] at the mouth of the river Scaldis&quot;. The battle turned his green shield red with blood. Greenshield also appears in other works. &quot;Brute Greenshield&quot;, a play about the king, was performed by the Admiral&#x27;s Men in 1598, but the text is lost. It may have been written by John Day and Henry Chettle.

In all these works Greenshield&#x27;s Hainaut expedition becomes the mythical foundation of the British empire, the first foreign venture to expand British influence in the world. Hainaut was also important to Elizabethans because the Earl of Leicester had led Elizabeth&#x27;s army against the Spanish there in 1579, so &quot;the Greenshield episode thus prefigures Merlin&#x27;s prophecy that Elizabeth shall &#x27;stretch her white rod over the &quot;Belgicke&quot; shore&#x27;&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Greenshield is the namesake of a dungeon synth group, Brutus Greenshield, who have released several albums on the popular music site bandcamp.

<doc id="669169" wikidata="Q165856" url="?curid=669169" title="Red-bellied paradise flycatcher">
<text>The red-bellied paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), also known as the black-headed paradise flycatcher, is a medium-sized passerine bird of the family of monarch flycatchers. It is native to intra-tropical forests of Africa. The male bird is about long and has a black head, a mainly chestnut body, and a tail with streamers nearly twice as long as the body. The colouring is somewhat variable across the bird&#x27;s range. Both females and juveniles lack the tail streamers and are a duller brown colour. It is closely related to the African paradise flycatcher, and the two can hybridise.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The name &quot;red-bellied paradise flycatcher&quot; is also used as an alternate name for Bedford&#x27;s paradise flycatcher.

===Subspecies===
Ten subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;T. r. rufiventer&quot; - : Found in Senegal, Gambia and western Guinea
* &quot;T. r. nigriceps&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found from Sierra Leone and Guinea to Togo and south-western Benin
* Fagan&#x27;s paradise-flycatcher (&quot;T. r. fagani&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in Benin and south-western Nigeria
* Ashy-tailed paradise-flycatcher (&quot;T. r. tricolor&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found on Bioko (Gulf of Guinea)
* Cameroon ashy-tailed paradise-flycatcher (&quot;T. r. neumanni&quot;) - : Found from south-eastern Nigeria to northern Angola
* &quot;T. r. schubotzi&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in south-eastern Cameroon and south-western Central African Republic
* &quot;T. r. mayombe&quot; - : Found in Congo and western Democratic Republic of Congo
* &quot;T. r. somereni&quot; - : Found in western and southern Uganda
* Uganda black-headed paradise-flycatcher (&quot;T. r. emini&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in south-eastern Uganda, western Kenya and north-western Tanzania
* Fiery paradise-flycatcher (&quot;T. r. ignea&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species. Found in eastern Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, north-eastern Angola and north-western Zambia

Until 2009, the Annobón paradise flycatcher was classified as a subspecies (&quot;T. r. smithii&quot;) of the Red-bellied paradise flycatcher.

==Description==
The adult male of this species is about 17 cm long, but the long tail streamers nearly double the birds length. It has a black head, and the rest of the plumage is chestnut, other than a prominent black wingbar. The female is duller and lacks the tail streamers. Young birds are plain brown.

The males show considerable variation in plumage in some areas. There is a morph of this species in which the male has the chestnut parts of the plumage replaced by white, and some races have black tail streamers.

The red-bellied paradise flycatcher is a noisy bird with a sharp &quot;zweet&quot; call. It has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a shrike. It is insectivorous, often hunting by flycatching.

The black-bellied African paradise flycatcher, &quot;Terpsiphone viridis&quot;, is closely related to this species, and hybrids occur with the underparts a mixture of black and red.

==Distribution and habitat==
The red-bellied paradise flycatcher is a common resident breeder in tropical western Africa south of the Sahara Desert. This species is usually found in thick forests and other well-wooded habitats. Two eggs are laid in a tiny cup nest in a tree.

<text>Leil was a legendary king of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He was the son of King Brutus Greenshield and came to power in 989BC.

Leil was a peaceful and just king and took advantage of the prosperity afforded him by his ancestors. He founded Carlisle, Cumbria (Caerleil: Fort of Leil) in the north as a tribute to this prosperity. He reigned for twenty-five years until he grew old and feeble. His inactivity sparked a civil war, during which he died. He was succeeded by his son Rud Hud Hudibras.

Geoffrey asserts that Leil reigned at the time when Solomon built the Temple in Jerusalem and Silvus Epitus was king of Alba Longa.

<text>Mohun Bagan Athletic Club is an Indian professional multi-sports club based in Kolkata, West Bengal. Founded in 1889, it is one of the oldest multi-sports clubs in Asia. The club has various sports departments like football, cricket, hockey, tennis, athletics, eSports etc.

== History ==

The foundation of Mohun Bagan stretches back into the 1880s when the neighborhood youth of presently known Fariapukur Lane in Shyambazar had set out in search for an ideal place to establish a football club, and came across a marble palace, &quot;Mohun Bagan Villa&quot;, owned by the family of a leading jute trader, Kirti Chandra Mitra.

On 15 August 1889, after a meeting of three prominent aristocratic Bengali families of North Kolkata – the Mitra family, the Basu family, and the Sen family – presided over by Bhupendra Nath Basu himself, &quot;Mohun Bagan Sporting Club&quot; was formed. Bhupendra Nath Basu became the first president of the newly founded club and Jyotindra Nath Basu was the first secretary of it.

During the initial years, the meager ground inside the palace was used by the club for hosting matches, including their first match that was played against the team of Eden Hindu Hostel students, and lost 1–0. The club management hugely emphasized providing memberships to the youth and maintained a strict code of conduct with an avowed objective of producing excellent sportsmen and imbuing them with impeccable moral and social values.

At the first-anniversary assembly, the Presidency College students and members of the club invited their professor, F. J. Rowe, to attend. Rowe pointed out the inappropriate naming of the club and suggested replacing &quot;Sporting&quot; with &quot;Athletic&quot; since the club didn&#x27;t indulge in sporting activities, like angling or rifle shooting. Thus, the members agreed and renamed the club as &quot;Mohun Bagan Athletic Club&quot;.

The second-anniversary assembly was presided by Sir Thomas Holland, who later became a member of the Executive Council of Governor-General of India. In 1891, with the help of the Maharaja Durga Charan Laha of Shyampukur, the club ground was relocated within his residential estate, now known as Laha Colony. The club ground was later relocated to Shyam Square in Bagbazar, with the help of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation chairman, Henry Lee. In 1900, Mohun Bagan became the partner of Presidency College and shared their ground at Maidan, where they would continue to play for 15 years.

== Structure ==

Mohun Bagan is registered as a society under Societies Registration Act, 1860 and West Bengal Societies Registration Act, 1961. Unlike many other top sports clubs in the country which are limited companies, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only membership. The registered members forms the &quot;Mohun Bagan Society&quot;, which takes part in the general elections for the appointment for various posts. The club is governed by its own &quot;constitution&quot;. Amendments and resolutions are passed via annual general meetings.

<doc id="669185" wikidata="Q152761" url="?curid=669185" title="Gorgoroth">
<text>Gorgoroth is a Norwegian black metal band based in Bergen. It was formed in 1992 by guitarist Infernus, who is the sole original member remaining, and has released nine studio albums. Gorgoroth are a Satanic band and have drawn controversy due to some of their concerts, which have featured impaled sheep heads and mock crucifixions. The band is named after the dead plateau of darkness in the land of Mordor from J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

==History==

===Early years (1992–1995)===
Gorgoroth was founded in 1992 by guitarist Infernus. In 1993, the band released their first demo, entitled &quot;A Sorcery Written in Blood&quot;. On 7 January 1994, Firda, the major newspaper in the county of Sogn og Fjordane where the band originated from, ran a cover story on the demo, with the headline &quot;Local music with Satanic symbolism&quot;. According to the article, the release of the demo and flyers with Satanic symbols led to &quot;concerned parents contacting the Sheriff&#x27;s Office in Fjaler&quot;. After the demo was released, Gorgoroth signed a record deal with Embassy Productions and started work on their debut full-length &quot;Pentagram&quot;. When bassist Kjettar left the band in 1993, Samoth of Emperor joined Gorgoroth as their new bassist, and participated in the recording of the album. After &quot;Pentagram&quot; was completed and released in 1994, drummer Goat left the band and was replaced by Frost from Satyricon. The band performed their first concert at Lusa Lottes Pøbb in Oslo on 3 May 1994 at a four-day Black Metal Nights festival with bands such as Dark Funeral (who also made their live debut), Dissection, Enslaved, Marduk (who played their first gig abroad), Gehenna and Hades Almighty.

This was followed by gigs with Enslaved in Bergen (in June and September) and in Haugesund (in November), and the band performed their first gig abroad in Annaberg-Buchholz in Germany on 10 December 1994. The same year, the band commenced the recording of &quot;Antichrist&quot; (originally titled &quot;Død&quot;), their second full-length album.

===With Pest (1995–1997)===

Vocalist Hat decided to leave Gorgoroth in September 1995, but agreed to finish recording the vocal tracks for &quot;Antichrist&quot;. After Hat left, Infernus recruited vocalist Pest from Obtained Enslavement as Gorgoroth&#x27;s new vocalist. In December 1995, the band supported Cradle of Filth at the London Astoria, a show which also included the band Primordial. This marked the first Gorgoroth live appearance of both vocalist Pest and bassist Ares. In 1995 the band had been offered a record deal with Moonfog Productions, but this offer was rejected in favour of an offer made by German label Malicious Records. Malicious Records released the band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Antichrist&quot;, in 1996, and also re-released the debut album &quot;Pentagram&quot;. The band went on a European tour with Satyricon and Dissection in April 1996, followed by a one-off gig in Bergen with Hades Almighty and Gehenna, at which the live EP &quot;The Last Tormentor&quot; was recorded. The band also played a one-off gig in the fall in Bischofswerda, Germany, with Behemoth. Soon the name Gorgoroth was commonplace in the black metal underground, both in Norway and in the rest of Europe, if somewhat overshadowed by some of the more famous black metal bands such as Mayhem or Emperor. The band&#x27;s third full-length album, &quot;Under the Sign of Hell&quot;, was recorded in spring 1996, and guitarist Tormentor joined the band later in the year. &quot;Under the Sign of Hell&quot; was released in 1997, and Gorgoroth went on their first headlining European tour in fall 1997, with support by Mystic Circle. It was on this tour that Infernus and Tormentor were approached by the major German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast, who wanted to sign the band. The band accepted the offer in late 1997.

===Tenure with Nuclear Blast (1997–2003)===
The move to Nuclear Blast was controversial among many black metal enthusiasts who pertained to the tenets of an &#x27;underground black metal scene&#x27;. The first album recorded and released for Nuclear Blast was &quot;Destroyer&quot; (1998). New singer Gaahl joined the band at this time, but was heard on only one song, the title track &quot;Destroyer&quot;. The music and lyrics on the album were mainly written by Infernus, but guitarist Tormentor also contributed as composer, most notably on the title track, and former vocalist Pest wrote the lyrics on 4 tracks. In May 1998, Gorgoroth played five dates in Germany on Cradle of Filth&#x27;s European tour, with support from Old Man&#x27;s Child and Einherjer. Gorgoroth also performed at Wacken Open Air in summer 1998, and performed at the Tuska Open Air Metal Festival in Helsinki, Finland, and in Oslo, Norway with Gehenna and Dødheimsgard.

In 1999, Gorgoroth began journeying into unknown territory with the recording of &quot;Incipit Satan&quot;. Though mainly written by Infernus once again, the album delved into musical ideas not expanded upon by the group in previous recordings. Songs such as &quot;Will to Power&quot; showcased strong industrial, dark ambient and noise influences (more so than on &quot;Destroyer&quot; and &quot;Under the Sign of Hell&quot;, both of which showed signs of experimentation). The song &quot;When Love Rages Wild in My Heart&quot; featured clean, bluesy vocals. Overall, the album displayed progressive tendencies, yet still retained a traditional black metal edge and Infernus&#x27; signature sound. The album was recorded during 1999, after drummer Vrolok and bassist T-Reaper had left the band and been replaced by drummer Erlend Erichsen (a.k.a. Sjt. Erichsen) and bassist King ov Hell. Drummer Erlend Erichsen left the band after the recordings were finished, and &quot;Incipit Satan&quot; was released in 2000, preceded by a European tour in December 1999, supporting Morbid Angel. In May 2000, Gorgoroth headlined a European tour, with bands like Old Man&#x27;s Child and Krisiun as supporting acts. In early June 2000, Gorgoroth performed at the first Hole in the Sky festival in Bergen, Norway. This festival was arranged in memory of former Gorgoroth drummer Grim, and also included bands such as Immortal, Enslaved, Obtained Enslavement, Hades Almighty and Aeternus. On 23 June 2000, Gorgoroth headlined the &quot;Knüppelnacht&quot; stage at the With Full Force festival in Leipzig, Germany.

After a couple of Norwegian concerts in 2000 and 2001, Gorgoroth made their hitherto only live appearance in the US at the Milwaukee Metalfest in August 2001. In September and October 2001, the band went on two mini tours of Mexico and Colombia. In 2001, Gorgoroth was also featured on a tribute album to the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem, with a cover version of that band&#x27;s &quot;Life Eternal&quot; from the &quot;De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas&quot; album. This song had been recorded in 1998, and featured Gaahl on vocals, as well as Infernus and Tormentor on rhythm guitars, T-Reaper on lead guitar and bass, and Vrolok on drums. This is the only released Gorgoroth recording which has not appeared on a full-length Gorgoroth album. In February 2002, vocalist Gaahl was taken into custody after being accused of having beaten a man at an after-party. The singer was sentenced to 12 months in prison in 2002, due to an already existing unserved 1-year sentence for previously committed acts of violence.

In 2002, Tormentor decided to quit the band due to no longer being able to cooperate with King, ending the stable 5-piece line-up of Gaahl, Infernus, Tormentor, King ov Hell and Kvitrafn, which had been formed in 2000. Following Tormentor&#x27;s departure, Gorgoroth began recording their new album, &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot;, in Bergen. The album showed a return to a more solidified black metal style, but was still quite different from early Gorgoroth releases, mainly due to the fact that most of the album&#x27;s songs were written by bassist King and drummer Kvitrafn rather than Infernus. The band played their first live gig in a year and a half at Garage in Bergen in April 2003, with Tormentor returning as guitarist for a one-off show. &quot;Twilight of the Idols&quot; was released by Nuclear Blast in May 2003, and the band subsequently performed at Hole in the Sky in Bergen in August 2003. This marked the first Gorgoroth live appearance of session guitarist Apollyon of Aura Noir.

===Controversy in Kraków (2004)===


On 1 February 2004, during a concert being recorded for a DVD in Kraków, Poland, the band displayed sheep heads on stakes, a bloodbath of 80 litres of sheep&#x27;s blood, Satanic symbols, and four naked crucified real-life models on stage. A police investigation took place with allegations of religious offence (which is prosecutable under Polish law) and cruelty to animals. Though these charges were considered, the band was not charged as it was ruled that they were unaware of the fact that what they were doing was illegal, although the concert organiser was eventually fined 10,000 zł in 2007 as he knew about it and neither informed the band that it was against the law nor intervened. The whole controversy led to the band being dropped from the roster of the Nuclear Blast Tour and the footage of the concert being confiscated by the police. Following this controversy – and with Gorgoroth also having achieved a larger degree of worldwide recognition through Nuclear Blast&#x27;s distribution facilities – the contract between both parties was bilaterally terminated. Gorgoroth further secured a reputation as a band with a vehement anti-right-hand path agenda, regarding which certain employees in the company were alleged to have felt uneasy due to their own personal beliefs.

After a successful South American tour of Brazil, Chile and Argentina, and a performance at Norway&#x27;s Inferno Festival, it was announced in April 2004 that drummer Kvitrafn had decided to leave the band. For the band&#x27;s European and Central American headlining tours of October and November 2004, drummer Dirge Rep (ex-Enslaved, Gehenna) and guitarist Teloch (Nidingr) were recruited.

===&quot;Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam&quot; (2005–2007)===
In early 2005, Infernus and a friend was sentenced to three years in prison for repeatedly raping a woman at an after-party in his apartment in 2003, and subsequently appealed the decision. After various shows around Europe in the first half of 2005, including the With Full Force Festival in July, Gorgoroth then went out on a month-long European tour with 1349 in November 2005, this time with Skagg (Gaahlskagg) replacing Teloch as live guitarist. On 10 December 2005, Gorgoroth played live in Trondheim, Norway, a gig which was to be their last live performance until summer 2007.

In January 2006, Infernus was acquitted of his previous rape conviction, but convicted of gross negligent rape and sentenced to one year in prison, while his friend&#x27;s sentence was upheld. Gorgoroth released &quot;Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam&quot; in June 2006 through Regain Records. This was only the second Gorgoroth album to be released since 2000&#x27;s &quot;Incipit Satan&quot; – a noticeable reduction in productivity from a band that had previously released 2 demos, 5 full-length albums and 1 live EP between 1993 and 2000. For the recording of the new album, Frost again performed on the drums. This album helped the band to expand its fan base. A short time after the album was released, bassist King temporarily left the band. According to the official website, King left because he &quot;had problems fronting some of the ideological aspects of his band GORGOROTH&#x27;s agenda&quot;. In a later interview, King stated that he left the Gorgoroth due to being dissatisfied with Infernus&#x27; lack of contributions to the band and was asked to rejoin the band by Gaahl in 2007. Gorgoroth was nominated in the &quot;Metal&quot; category at the 35th annual Spellemann Awards for &quot;Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam&quot; (the Norwegian equivalent to the Grammy Awards).

Gaahl served a sentence in jail from spring to December 2006 for the assault which happened in February 2002, and Infernus served a 4-month sentence for his rape conviction between October 2006 and March 2007. When the latter was released on parole, it was reported that Infernus had started &quot;working on new material, both music and lyrics for an upcoming album, title yet undecided&quot;.

In January 2007, it was reported that Gaahl was under investigation by Norwegian Police for his comments in an interview in &quot;&quot; (2005), which had been broadcast on Norway&#x27;s Lydverket NRK 1 on 24 January 2007, where he said &quot;church burnings are things that I support one-hundred percent, and they should have been done much more and will be done much more in the future&quot;. In April 2007, a 5-part series entitled &quot;True Norwegian Black Metal&quot;, produced by Peter Beste for Vice, aired on VBS.tv, covering some of the aspects of Gaahl&#x27;s life. With King back in the band, the video for &quot;Carving a Giant&quot; off &quot;Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam&quot; was also filmed and broadcast on Norwegian MTV that month.

In July and August 2007, Gorgoroth returned to the live arena with performances at festivals in Norway, Germany and the Czech Republic. In September 2007, the band went on a South American tour of Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Ecuador and Chile with Belphegor. These would be the last Gorgoroth concerts to feature Gaahl and King.

===&quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot; (2007–2011)===

In October 2007, Infernus announced the decision of Gaahl and King ov Hell to part ways on the band&#x27;s official Myspace page. Gaahl and King claimed that they had &quot;fired&quot; Infernus from Gorgoroth and claimed the rights to the name of the band, with King having made a trademark application the previous month. The duo explained in an interview that they tried to fire Infernus due to the guitarist having no interest in promoting the band or participating creatively and his behaviour after being released from prison, along with the claim of having &quot;creatively defined&quot; the band through the past eight years. King also cited feeling averse to being associated with Infernus both during and after the latter&#x27;s trial and conviction for rape. The dispute was concluded in March 2009 when a court verdict was announced, which recognised Infernus as the legitimate user of the name and that Gaahl and King had excluded themselves from Gorgoroth upon attempting to remove the founding member.

Shortly after parting ways with Gaahl and King, Infernus said that he was in the process of finishing and preparing the material he reportedly started in October 2006 and was first reported writing when he was released on parole in March 2007, declaring the title to be &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot;, to be released on Regain Records. He also stated that future live performances would minimise use of the Gorgoroth songs written between 2002 and 2004 (although only three songs by King ov Hell and two by Kvitrafn – four of which had lyrics written by Gaahl – were ever performed live), and that priority would be given to both older and brand new material. In December 2007, he revealed Tomas Asklund and Frank Watkins had joined Gorgoroth as drummer and bassist, respectively. Watkins later took the stage name &quot;Bøddel&quot;, which is the Norwegian word for &quot;Executioner&quot;, the old name of Obituary.

In April 2008, Infernus announced he was to depart for Stockholm, Sweden, where the next few months were spent rehearsing the material for &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot; in Tomas Asklund&#x27;s Monolith Studio.

The controversial 2004 Kraków concert was finally released on DVD in June 2008, more than 4 years after its recording. It was released by Metal Mind Productions under the title &quot;Black Mass Krakow 2004&quot;, and entered the Norwegian music DVD chart at position 4 in its first week of release. It remained in the charts for five weeks, peaking at a number 3 position.

On 30 May 2008, Regain Records announced the June 2008 release of &quot;True Norwegian Black Metal - Live in Grieghallen&quot;, a new Gorgoroth album which had been recorded live in studio in mid-October 2007. The recording line-up consisted of Infernus on guitars and bass, Gaahl on vocals, Teloch on session guitars, and Garghuf on session drums. However, ostensibly in part due to the circumstances of the ongoing name dispute, the distribution of the album was temporarily halted in July 2008, with the final decision to be made in a yet-to-be announced trial in Sweden.

Infernus also announced in August that a pre-recording for &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot; was made with guitars, bass and drums. After having spent the previous few months rehearsing in Monolith Studio, Infernus said that he was working on arrangements with assistance from former Gorgoroth guitarist Tormentor.

In September 2008, Infernus announced Tormentor had accepted his offer to rejoin Gorgoroth, together with Tomas Asklund and Bøddel. On 4 December 2008, it was announced that Pest had returned as the vocalist.

Shortly after the conclusion of the Gorgoroth name dispute, recording of &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot; began when Tomas Asklund commenced with the drum tracks in Monolith Studio. Infernus &quot;manually recorded six basic guitars&quot; for the album, and Bøddel and Pest recorded bass and vocals respectively in June.
In May 2009, it was announced that Gorgoroth would play live again on 29 August 2009 at the 10th anniversary edition of the Hole in the Sky festival in Bergen, Norway. This would be the band&#x27;s first live appearance since September 2007.

In late June 2009, it was announced that the vocals on &quot;True Norwegian Black Metal - Live in Grieghallen&quot; were rerecorded by Pest. A week later the release dates and track listing for &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot; were revealed.

At the band&#x27;s headlining concert at the Hole in the Sky festival on 29 August the set list consisted mainly of older material, including two songs off the &quot;Pentagram&quot; album which had not been performed live since October 1997. The band also performed live, for the very first time, the new song &quot;Aneuthanasia&quot; off &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot;. Gorgoroth also performed at UKA 2009 in Trondheim, Norway, on 19 October 2009. This concert coincided with the release of &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot;.

Upon its release the album was well received, with many reviewers commenting on the band&#x27;s return to its roots, comparing the album with earlier releases like &quot;Antichrist&quot; (1996). It was revealed in October 2009 that work on the follow-up to &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot;, including rehearsals by Infernus and Tomas Asklund in Stockholm, had taken place around that time. On 1 April 2010, it was officially announced that half of the yet-to-be-titled new album had been prerecorded in pre-production form, and that work on the album would continue through the year in between touring and festival appearances, with a tentative 2011 release date.

In April 2010 Gorgoroth embarked on a mini-tour of Europe consisting of five dates in Germany as well as one each in France, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands, to promote &quot;Quantos Possunt ad Satanitatem Trahunt&quot;. The band also performed at five European festivals in summer 2010: Germany&#x27;s Summer Breeze Open Air festival,
the Ragnarök Festival in Germany, Brutal Assault in the Czech Republic, Bloodstock Open Air in the UK, and the Finnish festival Jalometalli. In September 2010, Gorgoroth embarked on a mini-tour in South America and were announced to be touring Europe again in November 2010 after switching to Massive Music booking agency.

It was announced in October 2010 that the band was about to put the finishing touches on a re-recording of their 1997 release &quot;Under the Sign of Hell&quot;. The re-recording, with Pest on vocals and Tomas Asklund on drums, was released as &quot;Under the Sign of Hell 2011&quot; in December 2011. Phobos of Aeternus joined the band as a live drummer earlier that year.

===&quot;Instinctus Bestialis&quot; and Bøddel&#x27;s death (2012–present)===
In August 2012, Pest notified the band members that he would not be able to take part in Gorgoroth&#x27;s September 2012 tour of Latin America. In response, Infernus fired Pest from the band and announced that Hoest of Taake would perform vocals for the band&#x27;s coming tour, while Atterigner of the Serbian band Triumfall would be the vocalist for Gorgoroth&#x27;s next studio album, titled &quot;Instinctus Bestialis&quot;. The album was recorded in autumn 2013, with mixing being completed by June 2014 and mastering finished the following month. On 6 March 2015, the album artwork and track listing was revealed, along with a release date. &quot;Instinctus Bestialis&quot; was released in June 2015. On 18 October 2015, bassist Bøddel (Frank Watkins) passed away from cancer. In 2019, Infernus and Phobos announced creation of their own beer, Radix Malorum, in collaboration with Lysefjorden Microbrewery. In early August 2023, Infernus was assaulted and hospitalized following the band&#x27;s appearance at the Beyond the Gates Festival in Bergen, which led to the cancellation of a planned tour of Mexico in October. On 29 March 2024, Atterigner performed live with the band for the first time at the Inferno Metal Festival in Oslo.

==Suppression of lyrics and tablature==
Gorgoroth not only refuses to publish their lyrics but also actively suppresses any public showings of fan-written reconstructions. The reason for this suppression is not fully known, though Infernus has expressed disdain towards the prospect of material being covered by other bands, among other reasons.

The limited edition of &quot;Ad Majorem Sathanas Gloriam&quot; on CD did however include the lyrics to the song &quot;Prosperity and Beauty&quot; for reasons unknown.

The metal-lyric website Darklyrics.com contains the message &quot;Gorgoroth lyrics removed due to copyright complaint by the band&quot;, in lieu of any actual lyrics. Lyricsondemand.com displays a cease-and-desist message from Prophecies Publishing.

==Lyrics and satanism==
Gorgoroth are known for their satanic-themed and anti-Christian lyrics. The band&#x27;s founder and guitarist Infernus is openly a theistic satanist and considers himself &quot;Satan&#x27;s minister on Earth&quot;. He formed Gorgoroth to express his Satanist beliefs. The band&#x27;s former vocalist Gaahl is openly anti-Christian. In an interview for the 2005 heavy metal documentary &quot;&quot;, Gaahl was asked what inspired Gorgoroth&#x27;s music and his reply was simply &quot;Satan&quot;. When asked what he believes Satan represents, he said &quot;Freedom&quot;.

Gaahl explained his use of Satanic and anti-Christian themes: &quot;We live in a Christian world and we have to speak their language ... When I use the word &#x27;Satan&#x27; it means the natural order, the will of a man, the will to grow, the will to become the superman and not to be oppressed by any law such as the church, which is only a way to control the masses.&quot;

Gaahl and Infernus were openly supportive of the church burnings perpetrated by members of the black metal scene in the early 1990s. Gaahl further said, &quot;there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them&quot;.

<text>Christian Boehmer Anfinsen Jr. (March 26, 1916 – May 14, 1995) was an American biochemist. He shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Stanford Moore and William Howard Stein for work on ribonuclease, especially concerning the connection between the amino acid sequence and the biologically active conformation (see Anfinsen&#x27;s dogma).

==Background==
Anfinsen was born in Monessen, Pennsylvania, into a family of Norwegian-American immigrants. His parents were Sophie (née Rasmussen) and Christian Boehmer Anfinsen Sr., a mechanical engineer. The family moved to Philadelphia in the 1920s. In 1933, he went to Swarthmore College where he played varsity football and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry in 1937.

In 1939, he earned a master&#x27;s degree in organic chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania and was awarded an American-Scandinavian Foundation fellowship to develop new methods for analyzing the chemical structure of complex proteins, namely enzymes, at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, Denmark. In 1941, Anfinsen was offered a university fellowship for doctoral study in the Department of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School where he received his PhD in biochemistry in 1943. During World War II he worked for the Office of Scientific Research and Development.

Anfinsen had three children with his first wife, Florence Kenenger, to whom he was married from 1941 to 1978. In 1979, he married Libby Shulman Ely, with whom he had 4 stepchildren, and converted to Orthodox Judaism. However, Anfinsen wrote in 1987 that &quot;my feelings about religion still very strongly reflect a fifty-year period of orthodox agnosticism.&quot;

His papers were donated to the National Library of Medicine by Libby Anfinsen between 1998 and 1999.

Anfinsen converted to Judaism and was Jewish since.

==Career==

In 1950, the National Heart Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, recruited Anfinsen as chief of its laboratory of cell physiology. In 1954, a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship enabled Anfinsen to return to the Carlsberg Laboratory for a year and a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship allowed him to study at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel from 1958 to 1959. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958.

In 1962, Anfinsen returned to Harvard Medical School as a visiting professor and was invited to become chair of the department of chemistry. He was subsequently appointed chief of the laboratory of chemical biology at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases (now the National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases), where he remained until 1981. In 1981, Anfinsen became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. From 1982 until his death in 1995, Anfinsen was Professor of Biology and (Physical) Biochemistry at Johns Hopkins.
Anfinsen published more than 200 original articles, mostly in the area of the relationships between structure and function in proteins, as well as a book, The Molecular Basis of Evolution (1959), in which he described the relationships between protein chemistry and genetics and the promise those areas held for the understanding of evolution. He was also a pioneer of ideas in the area of nucleic acid compaction. In 1961, he showed that ribonuclease could be refolded after denaturation while preserving enzyme activity, thereby suggesting that all the information required by protein to adopt its final conformation is encoded in its amino-acid sequence. He belonged to the National Academy of Sciences (USA), the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters and the American Philosophical Society.

==Christian B. Anfinsen Award==

Established in 1996, The Christian B. Anfinsen Award is presented annually to distinguished scientists, the Awards recognize excellence and outstanding achievements in the multidisciplinary fields of protein science, and honor distinguished contributions in the areas of leadership, education, or service. It is sponsored by The Protein Society, and recognizes significant technical achievements in the field of protein science.

<doc id="669206" wikidata="Q7248744" url="?curid=669206" title="Progressive Green Party (New Zealand)">
<text>The Progressive Green Party was an environmentalist political party in New Zealand in the 1990s. It was a &quot;blue-green&quot; party – that is, one that is economically right-wing (&quot;blue&quot;), rather than left-wing (&quot;red&quot;), as well as environmentalist (&quot;green&quot;).

==History==
The Party was established on 9 August 1995 as a splinter group of the larger Green Party. The founders of the Progressive Greens were unhappy at the direction taken by the Green Party, which they believed was too left-wing. The Progressive Greens particularly opposed the Green Party&#x27;s membership in the Alliance, a broad left-wing coalition. The party was led by environmental businessman Rob Fenwick (Living Earth Ltd) and included prominent environmentalists including Stephen Rainbow (a former Wellington city councillor), Guy Salmon (head of the Maruia Society, forerunner to today&#x27;s Ecologic Foundation), and Gary Taylor (a former Waitemata city councillor).

In the 1996 election, conducted under the new MMP system, the Progressive Green Party won 0.26% of the vote, considerably below what they had hoped for, and had no members elected to Parliament. The Party did not contest any further elections, and eventually disbanded. In December 1998 the Progressive Greens were de-registered by the Electoral Commission. Many of the party&#x27;s members are now associated with the Bluegreens, an environmental &quot;task force&quot; within the National Party – Fenwick was the first convener of the Bluegreens and went on to co-found the NZ Business Council for Sustainable Development. Stephen Rainbow and Guy Salmon stood as list candidates for the National Party in the 1999 election and 2002 election, respectively, but were not elected. Gary Taylor re-established and led the Environmental Defence Society.

<doc id="669221" wikidata="Q15114900" url="?curid=669221" title="Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority">
<text>The Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority (NFTA) is the public agency responsible for operating most public transportation services in the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area. The NFTA, as an authority, oversees a number of subsidiaries, including the NFTA Metro bus and rail system, the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, the Niagara Falls International Airport and NFTA Small Boat Harbor. The NFTA Metro bus and rail system is a multi-modal agency, utilizing various vehicle modes (diesel bus, diesel-hybrid bus, CNG bus, light rail and cut-away van), using the brand names: NFTA Metro Bus, NFTA Metro Rail, NFTA Metrolink and NFTA PAL (Para-transit Access Line). In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

In addition, the NFTA also owns and manages a number of properties, including the Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center in Downtown Buffalo (which serves as the agency&#x27;s headquarters); the Niagara Falls Transportation Center on Factory Outlet Boulevard; the Portage Road Transit Center in Niagara Falls; and a number of strategically located bus loops and transit centers in the Buffalo Niagara region. Of note, many of the bus loops have been in continuous operation since the days of the International Railway Company, a predecessor to the NFTA. Agency-wide, the NFTA employs 1,500 full-time and part-time employees.

There are three business centers that operate as the NFTA organization: Surface Transportation, which handles ground transportation throughout Erie and Niagara counties, Aviation, which handles air related business at the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport and Niagara Falls International Airport and Property Risk/Management, which operates the NFTA-Boat Harbor and handles other properties that are owned and/or operated by the NFTA.

==History==

Before the creation of the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority, the first bus operations in Buffalo dates back to 1923 under the private operator International Bus Company. The International Railway Company (also under the same parent company of the International Traction Company) operated the vast network of streetcar routes in Erie and Niagara counties. In 1947, the proposed Niagara Frontier Rapid Transit Commission received ownership of the International Railway Company, which declared bankruptcy, and gave way to the creation of the Niagara Frontier Transit System, incorporated in 1950.

The Niagara Frontier Transit System was replaced by the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority Corp. (NFTA) in 1967, as part of New York State&#x27;s efforts in the late 1960s and early 1970s at creating public agencies that would oversee the development and continuation of public transportation in a number of key urban areas of the state; other such agencies include the Rochester Genesee Regional Transportation Authority (RGRTA), the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority (Centro) and the Capital District Transportation Authority (CDTA). In 1974, the NFTA purchased the street transportation rights from a number of other agencies, starting with the Niagara Falls Municipal Transit System on September 8, D&amp;F (Dunkirk and Fredonia) Transit on September 15, T-NT (Tonawanda-North Tonawanda) Transit on October 7, Lockport Bus Lines on March 15, 1975, and Grand Island Transit on April 20, 1975. Administrative offices and buses were housed in the former Niagara Frontier Transit Buildings at 855 Main Street (now the site of Buffalo Manufacturing Works) until 1977, at which point the offices were moved to the Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center.

==Governing body and executive director==
The NFTA&#x27;s operations are overseen by a 12-member Board of Commissioners that the executive director reports to. The members are nominated by the Governor of the State of New York, with two chosen by the Erie County Executive. Most appointments are for five-year terms, but some commissioners have been appointed partway into a term, replacing a previous commissioner.

==NFTA Airports Division==
==NFTA Metro Division==
===Benefit (service) area===
NFTA&#x27;s Metro system serves the highly urbanized areas of Erie and Niagara counties with service throughout the day and selected suburban and rural areas of Erie and Niagara counties. The cities receiving service include Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Lockport, Lackawanna, Tonawanda and North Tonawanda. Service to less populated areas during prime ridership hours extend to Alden, Amherst, Boston, Cheektowaga, Grand Island, Hamburg, Lancaster, Elma, Evans, Orchard Park, Tonawanda (Township), East Aurora and West Seneca in Erie County; Cambria, Lewiston, Niagara, Pendleton and Wheatfield in Niagara County.

===Transit fleet===
====Retired fleet====
The NFTA inherited a large number of General Motors New Look buses from the private carriers that were absorbed into the agency. In addition, a small fleet of Highway Products&#x27; Twin Coaches and Mack buses that were nearing the end of their life span were also added to the fleet. The first major purchase of new buses by the NFTA began in 1975 with AM General&#x27;s &quot;Metropolitan&quot; series buses. These buses were later withdrawn from service in 1987 due to severe structural issues. To address this immediate shortage of buses, the NFTA purchased a number of recently mothballed GMC buses from the Dallas Area Rapid Transit system (DART), Flxible buses from Rochester&#x27;s Regional Transit Service and General Motors New Looks from Broome County Transit (BC Transit) of Binghamton. This temporary arrangement filled most of the gap left by the removal of the AM General buses.

The next major purchase of new buses came from GMC, in their RTS-II Series. These buses were purchased between 1978 and 1983. As mentioned earlier, in 1987, due to the premature retirement of the AM General buses, the NFTA purchased a number of used, earlier series RTS series buses from Dallas&#x27; DART system. These buses provided comfortable padded seats, normally not seen on standard NFTA transit coaches. These buses operated for a number of years and were a deal to the NFTA in that the coach bodies previously did not experience earlier damage from road salt, sometimes referred to as &quot;salt-free&quot; miles, extending their usefulness a number of years because of the frames having a later start being introduced to corrosion from road salt.

In 1985, the NFTA purchased seven new suburban-configuration buses from Orion Bus Industries (OBI) to begin replacing the older inherited GMC buses from previously private agencies. This purchase marked the last purchase of non-lift equipped buses, and the first non-American purchase of new buses. Over the next seven years, OBI received additional orders of buses from the NFTA with purchases of two different models, the Orion I series and the Orion V, which the NFTA later purchased in 1993 as their first natural gas powered buses.

In 1992 and 1994, the NFTA purchased from two manufacturers, new to the NFTA; Motor Coach Industries, in their Classic series of transit coaches and New Flyer Industries, in their D40 series. In 1995, a third manufacturer was added, with North American Bus Industries/American Ikarus in their 416 series transit bus.

====Current fleet====
The NFTA operates a fleet of approximately 310 transit buses (all of which are low-floor, wheelchair-accessible and ADA compliant), 64 paratransit and Metrolink cutaway vans and 27 light rail cars, all operating up to 22 hours daily on 78 distinct routes.

The bus fleet contains buses purchased from manufacturers such as Nova Bus in their LFS transit bus (in both standard diesel and Compressed Natural Gas options) and Gillig in their Advantage transit bus (later recognized as their low floor T40 series, in standard diesel and diesel/electric hybrid options). The distribution of buses are split between three bus depots: Gisel-Wolford (also known as Babcock-William), located at 721 New Babcock Street (at Howard Street), Cold Spring (also known as Main-Michigan), located at 1581 Michigan Avenue (at Main Street)-- both on the east side of Buffalo—and Frontier (also known as Kenmore-Military), located at 1000 Military Road (at Kenmore Avenue) on the Buffalo-Kenmore border. The light rail fleet operates from the DL&amp;W terminal on South Park Avenue behind KeyBank Center in the Cobblestone District.

===Bus routes===

Many of the routes in the City of Buffalo operate along nearly the same alignment of the previous International Railway Company&#x27;s streetcar lines. After the elimination of streetcar service, many adjustments have been made in routing through Downtown Buffalo to allow better connections between routes connecting the city&#x27;s east side and west side, with many of the routes operating through at least one of two of the major transfer points: the Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center at the corner of North Division and Ellicott Streets and on Court Street between Niagara Square and Main Streets. The Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center is also the transfer point for inter-city bus service using Greyhound, Coach USA or Greyhound Lines of Canada. The routes follow a certain numbering schematic.

* 1-49: Erie County routes
* 50-57: Niagara County routes
* 60-81: express routes
* 90-99: special services (Buffalo Bills, Darien Lake, etc.)
* 100-121: Buffalo Public School trips
* 200-216: Metro Link routes

It has been normal practice for each route to be given a separate timetable, which includes a map of the route on the front, fare and pass information on the back panel and information on the times and days service is offered. Not all stops are listed in the timetables, however, but passengers can expect to see at least major transfer points and busy intersections. When boarding a bus or light rail car, the rider should note the following:
* The front of the vehicle destination sign shows the route number, the routing letter (for routes with multiple branches) and the destination (usually a community or the major street where the trip terminates). The side of the bus will carry the route number and the route name, to assure the passenger they are boarding the correct route. On occasion, a bus may also show a second message, such as &quot;via Expressway&quot; or &quot;via Thruway.&quot; The service planning department of the NFTA monitors ridership levels, historical data from previous years and looks for the most efficient way to offer services on an approximately quarterly basis. With this, timetables are generally updated four times a year: March, June, September and December. When Buffalo Public Schools are on break or summer recess, there may be decreases in the service levels to accommodate for decreased ridership. Beginning Labor Day weekend, service reverts to the normal levels.

====Planned routes====
=====Hublink (MetroLink)=====
The NFTA&#x27;s original &quot;Hublink&quot; concept, now renamed &quot;MetroLink,&quot; created a network of routes (numbered in the 200 and 300 series range) linking multiple transit centers together, using cutaway vans. A minimum service standard was created, where buses were to operate on a frequent schedule through the day, moving passengers across the region. Additionally, circulatory routes were to be created linking passengers with community-based services for a number of high-density areas that cannot support normal city bus transit service. Though refined from the earlier plans, some routes came to reality. Routes 200 and 201 were the first two routes; route 200 North Tonawanda-Wheatfield operating across the width of the City of North Tonawanda to get to Creekside Park and Ride lot and then Niagara Falls Boulevard to Niagara Falls International Airport and route 201 Lockport serving the City of Lockport on a circulatory route serving the Lockport Memorial Hospital, the senior citizens center and Downtown Lockport. Both routes were also scheduled to connect to conventional service routes at their end terminals or transit centers they arrive at along the route.

=====2010 restructuring=====
In the middle part of 2009, the NFTA hired Transportation Management and Design, Inc. to begin a &quot;Transit Service Restructuring and Fare Study,&quot; that would involve some of the largest changes that the riding public has seen since March 24, 1993, when the NFTA&#x27;s &quot;New&quot; Metro system was introduced. Some of the new proposals included reducing the number of fare zones to a single zone and creating a uniform boarding fare without additional fees for crossing particular fare zone lines, elimination of bus-to-bus transfers and modifying the pricing of cash fares, monthly and daily passes. The proposals were passed and went into effect effective September 1, 2010.

On the scheduling side, more emphasis would be taken on urban services, primarily within the City of Buffalo. Service on primary corridors, such as those serving densely patronized routes could find an increase in service levels during non-peak hours, promoting spontaneous usage. Lightly patronized routes were reduced to fit ridership statistics and allow the agency to more effectively use the buses on heavier patronized routes. In addition, weekend service was improved significantly on many city routes with Sunday service nearly tripled on certain portions of some routes. Approval of the plan was reached between TMD, Inc. and the NFTA executive board in late June 2010 and the changes were implemented with a special later autumn schedule change on October 31, 2010. The NFTA Metro service planning department adjusted the schedules leading up to the following schedule change, based on driver input, customer complaints and other sources, most notably adding services where necessary due to excessive passenger loads.

=====2012 restructuring=====
On September 26, 2011, the NFTA reported that the agency could face as much as a $15 million shortfall in funding due to cuts in funding at the state level. Facing a directive to cut into the deficit created, the NFTA considered a fare hike, in addition to a number of service cuts to routes with low usage. Four days later, on September 30, patrons of the system came back crying &#x27;foul,&#x27; demanding retaining the present service levels and fares. The following month, the NFTA lobbied the state to return $10 million in cuts previously made.

In December 2011, the NFTA held a number of public hearings regarding a fare increase that was quickly met with hostility from the riding public. On December 7, the NFTA rejected the fare hike and focused on a severe reduction (22%) to bus service that would effective eliminate express bus services, gut bus services to Niagara County and reduce and eliminate hours and days of operation on a number of bus services. Again, public hearings were held and met with the same hostility as the fare cut proposal. On January 19, 2012, the NFTA was assured of a return of $2.9 million to reduce some of the service cuts the NFTA had planned. A final hearing brought a plan to lessen the impact of the previous number of service cuts and raise the adult fare by 25 cents, with small increases to other Metro fare plans. The board approved the plan to make the changes in late March, to take effect on April 29 (bus and rail modifications) and May 1 for fare increases. The NFTA plans to monitor many of the routes over the months following to find efficiencies in potential changes.

=====Bus rapid transit=====
In the January 24, 2013 edition of &quot;The Buffalo News,&quot; the NFTA was reported to be in the planning stages of adding what is essentially bus rapid transit to its route 5 Niagara-Kenmore corridor. Plans include transforming the corridor into an efficient limited-stop corridor that would remove a number of minutes from the time between the Downtown Buffalo area and the Riverside community near the city line. Some of the plans are said to include signal prioritization, modern electronic signage showing the time for the next due bus, creating a new transit center in Riverside that would connect a number of routes into one location, including a park-and-ride lot at the transit center and new natural-gas powered buses that would be used on the line. The success of this project would eventually open the doors to other key corridors being switched to bus rapid transit over time. In addition, the project aims to also improve the reliability and timeliness of the buses. 

On December 6, 2015, NFTA Metro opened the Black Rock/Riverside Transit Hub in North Buffalo, resulting in a number of routing and schedule changes to several bus routes so that buses can take advantage of serving the new transportation hub. Years later, on December 22, 2023, the federal government awarded a $102 million grant the NFTA to design and construct a BRT line through Bailey Avenue in the East Side of Buffalo, as part of an effort to improve transportation and the quality of life in that part of the city.

===Connecting services===
====Air====
Although the NFTA has previously offered service into the region&#x27;s airports, it has made further efforts to improve these services to passengers arriving and departing. The region&#x27;s primary commercial airport, the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, connects with NFTA-Metro services on route 24 Genesee, while the Niagara Falls International Airport serves a number of low-cost and charter airlines and is served by routes 55 Pine Avenue and 59 Niagara Falls Airport-NCCC.

====Amtrak====
The Buffalo-Niagara region has three Amtrak stations, two of which are located in Erie County and the third located in Niagara County. The Depew Station, located on Dick Road in the village of Depew, New York, is served weekdays only by route 46 Lancaster. Of all regional stations, this is the only station that serves the Lake Shore Limited train, to and from Chicago. The Exchange Street Station, located on Exchange Street, is a short walk from the Metro Rail and a number of other bus routes that serve Washington Street. A disadvantage of the station, however, is its limited hours, necessitating passengers to wait outside for arriving and departing trains. Of the three region&#x27;s stations, this station is the only one to receive public transportation service daily. The Niagara Falls Station and Customhouse Interpretive Center, near the corner of Main Street and Depot Avenue West in Niagara Falls, is served weekdays and Saturdays only by route 50 Main-Niagara.

====Inter-city bus====
Most buses that service Downtown Buffalo operate within a couple of blocks from the Buffalo Metropolitan Transportation Center, located at the northeast corner of Ellicott and North Division Streets. The BMTC hosts bus services operated by Greyhound, Coach USA, Coach Canada, Megabus, various Trailways franchisees and Lakefront Lines. The BMTC also houses at one of its gates, the starting point of routes 40 Grand Island and 60 Niagara Falls buses, operated by the NFTA.

====Local bus====
Upon the elimination of service on route 201 serving Lockport, the NFTA made arrangements to advertise alternate service operated by Rural Niagara Transit within the city of Lockport. The replaced service, with lesser trips offered, served a similar service area and would allow residents of Lockport (off the route 44 Lockport) continued service. Rural Niagara Transit operates out of its primary hub at Niagara County Community College and spreads throughout the Niagara County area with connections between buses at the college three times daily. The service in Lockport is part of slightly modified service on the NCCC-Olcott and NCCC-Middleport routes.

===Cash and passes===
The NFTA operates on an &quot;exact fare&quot; system, in which passengers are responsible for having the exact fare ready or proof-of-payment upon boarding a Metro vehicle. Drivers and operators do not make change; however, vending machines are able to make change for customers in coins. Passengers can pay boarding fares on buses in coins, tokens or bills using Genfare &quot;Odyssey&quot; fareboxes, while passengers using the Metro Rail light rail line pay for their boarding fares using farecard vending machines located at each station. Rail ticket vending machines at one time were able to accept credit cards for fare payment, however, this practice was discontinued. There are presently seven fare categories. Previously, transfers were allowed between immediately connecting lines for a lesser charge than full-fare (with the exception being between bus and rail and vice versa). This practice was permanently discontinued on May 1, 2012, at which point passengers are required to pay a boarding fare upon each boarding or get a pass.

====College cooperative agreements====
In recent years, the NFTA has aggressively pursued agreements with many local colleges and universities, using their &quot;NFTA Unlimited Access&quot; program. Under the program, students are offered semester passes that allow the user unrestricted travel on any Metro regularly scheduled service. Erie Community College was at the forefront of this service and originally provided students a shuttle service linking the three campuses through the City Campus. Route 80 operated for approximately two calendar years, but service was eliminated and students were given the opportunity to use alternate service on local bus routes. Later, a Metrolink shuttle service operates on a similar plan, assigned route 211 ECC Circulator, but that route has since been eliminated and replaced with ECC&#x27;s own tri-campus shuttle. Buffalo State College is another large college participating in the Unlimited Access program. At the start, the NFTA had operated three circulator routes, one (assigned route 206 Buffalo State College Circulator) primarily served the college grounds, in addition to two grocery stores near the college; Tops Friendly Markets at Grant Street and Amherst Street and Wegmans on Amherst Street and two additional routes (assigned routes 207 Elmwood Circulator and 208 Grant Circulator) circulating over the same route as Route 206, with service extended over Elmwood Avenue on route 207 and Grant Street on route 208. Due to route duplication on both the 20 Elmwood and 3 Grant bus routes, routes 207 and 208 were eliminated, while route 206 was eliminated as of September 2, 2018. Other colleges and universities that are presently included in the program are:
* Buffalo State College
* Canisius College
* Bryant and Stratton Business College

===Metro Rail (light rail rapid transit)===
====Light rail and rapid transit====
Buffalo&#x27;s first street railway began operations in 1832 with horse car routes on Pearl Street and Terrace operating to the Canada Ferry terminal. In 1860, the Buffalo Street Railway Company was established. Electric streetcars began operating in Buffalo in 1889 and the last horse car retired in 1894. In Niagara Falls, the first electric cars began in 1883, In 1902, the International Railway Company was created from the merger of the Buffalo&#x27;s first street railway operator and Buffalo Street Railway Company. The trolley service ended in 1950 and would not resume until construction of the present LRT began in 1979, opening on May 20, 1985. As of February 18, 2013, there are 13 stations on the 6.4-mile (10.3-km) Metro Rail line, with five above-ground and eight underground.

====Future plans for the Metro Rail====

The Citizens Regional Transit Corporation (CRTC) has continuously lobbied local and state politicians to provide funding or support for extensions to the one-line system. A proposed Airport Corridor line follows the Division Street area, cutting through to the old New York Central Terminal around Jefferson Avenue, following old track bed through the CSX line between Walden and Broadway to Thruway Plaza, Walden Galleria Mall and Buffalo-Niagara International Airport. A proposed Tonawanda Corridor line follows the old Erie RR right-of-way (ROW) from LaSalle Station through to the Town and City of Tonawanda and the City of North Tonawanda. This line would have a number of branches: one operating through North Buffalo to Elmwood (known as the North Buffalo Branch) to Niagara Falls following the old New York Central Railroad&#x27;s &quot;Beeliner&quot; service (known as the Niagara River Corridor) and to the North Campus of the university at Buffalo, using abandoned railroad right-of-ways (known as the Youngmann Branch). The extension to North Campus is currently undergoing a study by the local government, having secured funding in recent years. In addition, local officials are considering redeveloping the NFTA Rail Maintenance Yard into a multi-modal transportation center.

====LRV fleet details====
* Manufacturer: Tokyu Car Corporation, Japan
* Fleet size: 27 (one car {125} damaged in transit upon delivery in 1983, but has since been repaired)
* Fleet No.:: 101-127
* Length: 
* Width: 
* Weight: 35.5 tons
* Normal capacity: 140 (including 51 seated)
* Control: 4 chopper controlled Westinghouse motors (at 650 V DC)
* Track gauge: (standard gauge)

=====Fleet refurbishment=====
Two rail cars (fleet numbers 114 and 123) were shipped to Dansville, NY in February 2010, where AnsaldoBreda Inc., a unit of AnsaldoBreda S.p.A. of Italy, has been making wholesale improvements to the cars, each receiving a top-to-bottom $1.5 million transformation and were returned to full revenue service on March 9, 2012, nearly two years behind schedule. In the nearly ten years since, 24 more cars (fleet numbers 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 124, 125, 126 and 127) were all refurbished and have since returned to full service as of February 1, 2022. Among the items being refurbished, passengers will experience new seating, stanchions, electronic signage and new audio systems, similar to the train service at Atlanta&#x27;s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Operation-wise, the shells of the car will be placed on refurbished trucks, with new wheels, gear boxes, overhauled traction motors, new pantographs, brakes and air compression systems.

===Corporate identity===
====Coloring and print media====
The current color scheme (navy, light-gray and gray) first appeared on the 2000 series (Nova Bus LFS) coaches in early 2000. The color scheme met with approval on most sides. According to a past &quot;Buffalo News&quot; article, the colors and logo were chosen to link the area&#x27;s &quot;water&quot; image with the company. The force of the Niagara River and Niagara Falls contribute to the idea of the &quot;wave&quot; design that was chosen. With the arrival of the 6000 series GMC RTS-04 buses in 1984, the NFTA&#x27;s Metro system operated its vehicles using a color scheme of yellow, orange and brown, referred to as &quot;earth tone&quot; or &quot;candy corn.&quot; As of February 1, 2022, this color scheme can only be found on one Metro Rail car (fleet number 107), but it is expected that car 107 will eventually be painted in the newer livery during its mid-life overhaul being performed.

Prior to 1984, the Niagara Frontier Transit Metro System had painted their fleet with a yellow and black scheme (during the 1970s), similar to that of the Pittsburgh Steelers&#x27; football uniform colors, the Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; hockey uniform colors and the Pittsburgh Pirates&#x27; baseball uniform colors and maintained the red and cream color scheme used by the Niagara Frontier Transit System (1950-1960s). The International Railway Company, the predecessor to the Niagara Frontier Transportation System used either an orange and cream or forest green and vermilion scheme for their vehicles. The NFTA used a circular logo during the 1970s for the parent corporation, showing a nested combination of a bus, airplane and ship. For the NFTA Metro system, a simple typeface, similar to blippo spelled out &quot;metro bus.&quot; Towards the end of the 1990s, a modified &quot;M&quot; in the same typeface, except with a &quot;swoosh&quot; style to the left of the letter. In 2000, the NFTA replaced its logo type with a variation of &quot;Helvetica&quot; in the &quot;italicized&quot; version. This style is present on all NFTA correspondence, including the NFTA Metro Bus and Rail system, the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, the Niagara Falls International Airport and the NFTA Small Boat Harbor, among others.

===Timeline===

* April 1, 1974: The NFTA takeover of the Niagara Frontier Transit System, Inc. occurs.
* October 9, 1984: Metro Rail begins service in the Downtown Central Business District, between Auditorium and Theater Stations.
* May 18, 1985: Metro Rail officially opens for regular service between Auditorium and Amherst Street Stations. Due to construction issues at LaSalle Station, LaSalle and South Campus Stations officially open on November 10, 1986.
* April 1, 1990: The NFTA experiences a two-day shutdown due to budgeting and funding issues with state and local governments. Prior to this closure, the NFTA distributed &quot;red&quot; schedules for the first time, clearly giving passengers a preview of pending service cuts to the Metro System. The most severe plan had the closure of the Metro Rail line entirely, as well as all service eliminated after 7:00pm weekdays and no service offered on Saturdays, Sundays or major holidays. Due to this alarming preview and subsequent closure, emergency funding was established by elected Erie County officials and service resumed later in the day following (Monday, April 2, 1990) without cuts to service.
* March 24, 1993: The &quot;New&quot; Metro System is introduced, creating a streamlined version of the previous Metro system, increasing bus frequencies, adding a number of new routes and new destinations not previously served by bus. With this new service, a number of branches with low ridership are eliminated and the service was redirected to supplement the new service.
* December 14, 1995: 17-year-old Cynthia Wiggins is struck by a ten-ton dump truck while crossing a seven lane roadway (Walden Avenue) across from the Walden Galleria Mall. She dies of her injuries almost three weeks later, on January 2, 1996. Her death sparks a number of lawsuits against the NFTA, the Pyramid Corporation (the owner of the mall) and many others, charging racial discrimination due to the inability of the NFTA to have their buses enter the mall. This lawsuit is eventually settled, in which the Pyramid Corporation pays $2 million and the dump truck driver pays $250,000 to Cynthia&#x27;s then-four-year-old son. Effective with the December 1997 schedule changes, all NFTA buses are finally allowed to enter the Walden Galleria Mall, Boulevard Mall, McKinley Mall and Eastern Hills Mall, previously not allowed by mall management.
* October 26, 1999: Longtime Metro Bus driver Gilbert Rogers is killed in an accident across Genesee Street at the Buffalo-Niagara International Airport. The bus Rogers was driving is reported to have collided with a tractor-trailer loaded with crushed stone shortly before 7:00 am. John R. Battle, the NFTA police chief at the time, was quoted as saying, &quot;...it appears that the bus driver, who was turning into the airport, had the right-of-way and that the truck driver, who was traveling westbound (on Genesee) when the accident occurred, was unable to stop his vehicle at the intersection. There&#x27;s a lot of momentum when you have a truck loaded with that much stone.&quot; Witnesses told police that the truck had already begun wobbling and losing some of its stones as it approached the intersection, which is controlled by a traffic light. The driver of the truck later pleaded guilty in March 2000 and was subsequently fined $1,100.00, but was spared jail time, as prosecution dismissed charges of unreasonable speed and an overweight vehicle due to the plea deal.
* September 1, 2003: Four NFTA Metro stations are permanently renamed: South Campus Station becomes University Station; Delavan-College Station becomes Delavan/Canisius College Station; Allen-Hospital Station becomes Allen/Medical Campus Station and Auditorium Station becomes Erie Canal Harbor Station.
* December 23, 2007: NFTA Metro introduces the newly built Niagara Falls Transportation Center in the Town of Niagara. This results in a number of routing and schedule changes to all Niagara Falls routes, so that buses can take advantage of serving the new transportation center. The building is the first new build of a transportation in more than 30 years by the NFTA. It is also built in the Town of Niagara, compared to Downtown Niagara Falls so that it is more central in Niagara County.
* May 25, 2008: NFTA Metro implements a new bus route (#210 Airport-Niagara Falls Express) between the Greater Buffalo-Niagara International Airport, the Niagara Transit Center and Downtown Niagara Falls. Created to coincide with the start of the peak tourist season in Niagara Falls, this trip takes 50 minutes from end-to-end.
* September 5, 2008: Reminiscent of the Cynthia Wiggins lawsuit of 1995, the NFTA is banned by the owners of the Quaker Crossing shopping complex in Orchard Park. Allegations of the ban being racially motivated were denied by the mall owners, who instead cited safety concerns for pedestrians walking in the plaza. In the interim, the NFTA began operating buses over Amanda and Amelia Lanes, roadways that bisect the plaza.
* October 31, 2010: NFTA-Metro embarks on a sweeping change to its service network, following a multi-year study by TMI, Inc. The resulting changes included dropping zone fare charges for a uniform boarding fare regardless of the distance traveled, either removing or reducing service from low patronized areas in favor of improving service during middays and weekends. Passengers experienced these changes during a time when it normally is not adjusted, due to the scope of the changes made.
* February 18, 2013: After 10,359 days of service, Theater Station permanently closes, reducing the number of free fare zone stations from six to the current five, with Fountain Plaza Station, located 546 feet south, now serving as the beginning (southbound) and ending (northbound) of the free fare zone.
* June 24, 2013 – October 14, 2013: NFTA-Metro begins phase two of the &quot;Returning Cars to Main Street&quot; project by single tracking along the 600 block of Main Street from the tunnel entrance to Chippewa Street, just north of where Fountain Plaza Station currently stands. From June 24, 2013 – August 8, 2013, the outbound track from Allen/Medical Campus Station to Church Station is used, as the inbound track is redone. During the weekend of August 8–10, 2013, Allen/Medical Campus temporarily serves as the southern terminus of the Metro Rail as construction shuts down above-ground service. As a result, NFTA-Metro offers shuttle buses to accommodate passengers between Allen/Medical Campus Station and Erie Canal Harbor Station, with each shuttle running every 15 minutes. From August 11, 2013 – October 14, 2013, the inbound track is used, as the outbound track is redone.
* March 30, 2014 – October 14, 2014: NFTA-Metro begins phase three of the &quot;Returning Cars to Main Street&quot; project by single tracking along the 500 block of Main Street from Chippewa Street to Mohawk Street, just north of where Lafayette Square Station currently stands. From March 30, 2014 – July 17, 2014, the inbound track from Allen/Medical Campus Station to Church Station is used, as the outbound track, along with Fountain Plaza Station&#x27;s outbound platform, is redone. During the weekend of July 18–20, 2014, Allen/Medical Campus temporarily serves as the southern terminus of the Metro Rail as construction shuts down above-ground service. As a result, NFTA-Metro offers shuttle buses to accommodate passengers between Allen/Medical Campus Station and Erie Canal Harbor Station, with each shuttle running every 15 minutes. From July 21, 2014 – October 10, 2014, the outbound track is used, as the inbound track, along with Fountain Plaza Station&#x27;s inbound platform, is redone.
* June 10, 2015: NFTA-Metro introduces its revamped customer care information line which includes a new &quot;Smart Traveler Stop Lookup ID&quot; option so that passengers can check exactly what time their bus (or train) gets to a certain stop.
* December 6, 2015: NFTA Metro introduces the newly built Black Rock/Riverside Transit Hub in North Buffalo. This results in a number of routing and schedule changes to several bus routes so that buses can take advantage of serving the new transportation hub.

==NFTA Properties Division (stations/garages/barns)==
The NFTA Properties Division is charged with management of the facilities owned and operated in the NFTA organization.

<text>Threshold are an English progressive metal band formed in Surrey in the late 1980s. The guitarist and producer Karl Groom has been the band&#x27;s only consistent member.

== History ==
=== 1988–1992 ===
Threshold began their career in 1988, initially playing covers of metal groups like Ratt and Testament. As they continued playing together, they began to write their own songs, and eventually stopped playing covers altogether. Early recordings were released locally on cassette under the band name &quot;If Not, Why?&quot;. They played their first gig at The Compasses in Egham, Surrey, with Jon Jeary on vocals and Ian Bennett on bass. In 1992, they signed their first record deal, and after adding vocalist Damian Wilson to the group alongside guitarists Karl Groom and Nick Midson, bassist Jon Jeary and drummer Tony Grinham, produced their first commercial recording, &quot;Intervention,&quot; which was released on a Dutch progressive rock compilation album. Shortly afterwards, keyboardist Richard West joined the band, and he remains with them to this day.
;1993–1999
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Wounded Land&quot;, was released in 1993, taking its name and some thematic elements from Stephen R. Donaldson&#x27;s novel of the same name. Wilson was unavailable to join the band for the follow-up tour, and so Glynn Morgan was recruited to replace him. He sang on the band&#x27;s 1994 second recording, &quot;Psychedelicatessen&quot;, which spawned a music video for the song &quot;Innocent,&quot; the band&#x27;s first. The following year, Morgan and the band toured Europe and recorded some of their performances for the short live album, &quot;Livedelica&quot;.

Threshold took a break before their next effort, during which time Morgan and then-drummer Jay Micciche left to form Mindfeed. Rather than finding an unknown singer to replace him, the band turned again to Damian Wilson, and together they recorded 1997&#x27;s &quot;Extinct Instinct&quot;. They followed this with another tour of Europe, this time supported by Enchant. Additionally, Johanne James, the band&#x27;s current drummer, played with them for the first time during this tour. Wilson was unavailable for their next album, so former Sargant Fury vocalist Andrew &quot;Mac&quot; McDermott, joined to record &quot;Clone&quot; and would remain with them until 2007.

=== 2000–2005 ===
In 2001, Threshold released &quot;Hypothetical&quot;, which saw Johanne James firmly cemented as the band&#x27;s permanent drummer. Another lineup change occurred in 2003, when bassist Jon Jeary left and was replaced by Steve Anderson. Around this time the band also re-released their first three studio albums in Special Editions, with bonus tracks, a remastered sound, expanded liner notes and, in the case of &quot;Wounded Land&quot; and &quot;Psychedelicatessen&quot;, special CD-ROM content. Their newer albums, starting with &quot;Hypothetical&quot;, were released in Limited Editions, with similar bonus content. The albums &quot;Critical Mass&quot; (2002) and &quot;Subsurface&quot; (2004) followed, interspersed by the double live album and DVD &quot;Critical Energy&quot;.

=== 2006–2011 ===

Threshold left their longtime label, InsideOut Music, in 2006 to join Nuclear Blast Records. Guitarist Nick Midson left the band in early 2007 for unknown reasons. The band released &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot; which spawned a music video for an edit of the song &quot;Pilot in the Sky of Dreams&quot;. The song also appeared on the 2008 movie soundtrack &quot;In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale&quot;. This marks the first occasion of a song by the band appearing in a motion picture. In July 2007 vocalist Mac left the band and original singer Damian Wilson returned as Threshold&#x27;s frontman for the first time in nearly a decade for the band&#x27;s tour dates which extended into 2009. Pete Morten replaced Midson as guitarist for the tour and later albums. InsideOut Music released the first official Threshold compilation in November 2007. The album &quot;The Ravages of Time&quot; is a two-disc set covering all of the band&#x27;s official albums from &quot;Wounded Land&quot; to &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;. In 2009 the band released a limited edition eight-disc singles box set, including previously unreleased b-sides and brand new re-recordings of old demo songs released in other forms before, including &quot;Smile at the Moon&quot;, (which was debuted live on the 2009 Essence of Progression Tour), &quot;Shifting Sands&quot;, &quot;Half Way Home&quot; and &quot;Fist of Tongues&quot;. On 3 August 2011, former vocalist Andrew McDermott died of kidney failure.

=== 2012–2017 ===
On 24 August 2012, Nuclear Blast announced the release of &quot;March of Progress&quot;. It was the first album to feature Damian Wilson on vocals since 1997. The album was followed on 19 September 2014 by the band&#x27;s tenth studio album &quot;For the Journey&quot;. The following year the band released the double live album &quot;European Journey&quot; recorded during their November 2014 tour. In February 2017, Pete Morten left Threshold to focus on his own projects, and the following month Threshold announced that they had parted ways with Damian Wilson.

=== 2017–present ===
Glynn Morgan, the band&#x27;s former vocalist from 1994 to 1996 replaced Damian Wilson for the album &quot;Legends of the Shires&quot; released in September 2017. The album entered the top 20 of the national album charts in Germany and Switzerland and spawned a music video for the song &quot;Small Dark Lines&quot;. The following year the band released the live album &quot;Two-Zero-One-Seven&quot; recorded during their 2017 European tour. In July 2021 Threshold announced that they were back in the studio recording their twelfth studio album, teasing that &quot;if &quot;Legends of the Shires&quot; had a slightly darker, moodier older brother then this would be it&quot;. In July 2022, the band announced their 12th album would be titled &quot;Dividing Lines&quot;, and it was released on 18 November 2022, entering the top 20 of the national album charts in Switzerland and the top 40 in Germany. The album had started life as sequel to &quot;Legends of the Shires&quot;, but following a decision not to continue with the story, keyboard player Richard West recorded his own sequel &quot;The Fall of the Shires&quot; under the &quot;Oblivion Protocol&quot; moniker. At the same time West&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Maybe A Writer - My Life In Threshold&quot; was published by Kingmaker Publishing.

In 2024 Threshold released newly remixed versions of their first four albums &quot;Wounded Land&quot;, &quot;Psychedelicatessen&quot;, &quot;Extinct Instinct&quot; and &quot;Clone&quot; on CD and vinyl formats. The band promoted the remixes with the retrospective &quot;Threshold Through Time Tour&quot; where they performed songs from all twelve of the studio albums. For these shows Alessio Garavello stood in for vocalist Glynn Morgan who was suffering from a throat condition.

<doc id="669228" wikidata="Q367858" url="?curid=669228" title="Adriaen Isenbrandt">
<text>Adriaen Isenbrandt or Adriaen Ysenbrandt (between 1480 and 1490 – July 1551) was a painter in Bruges, in the final years of Early Netherlandish painting, and the first of the Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting of the Northern Renaissance. Documentary evidence suggests he was a significant and successful artist of his period, even though no specific works by his hand are clearly documented. Art historians have conjectured that he operated a large workshop specializing in religious subjects and devotional paintings, which were executed in a conservative style in the tradition of the Early Netherlandish painting of the previous century. By his time, the new booming economy of Antwerp had made this the centre of painting in the Low Countries, but the previous centre of Bruges retained considerable prestige.

He was believed by Georges Hulin de Loo to be the same person as the anonymous &quot;Master of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin&quot; or &quot;Pseudo-Mostaert&quot;. Other art historians doubt that any works can be reliably attributed to him, and the number of paintings attributed to him by major museums has been in decline for many decades.

==Personal life==
There are only a few documentary records of his life, and some mentions in literature from the artist&#x27;s lifetime or soon after. Even so, there are no documents which link him as the creator of any surviving works. It is possible that he was born in Haarlem or Antwerp around 1490. It is not known where or with which painter he served his apprenticeship.

He is named for the first time in 1510, when he came to Bruges and bought his burghership. In November of the same year he became master in the local painters&#x27; Guild of St. Luke and the goldsmiths&#x27; guild of St. Elooi. He was later elected nine times as a &quot;deacon&quot; (in Old Dutch : &quot;vinder&quot;) and twice as the governor (in Old Dutch : &quot;gouverneur&quot; = treasurer) of the guild.

He quickly established an important workshop, probably in the &quot;Korte Vlaminckstraat&quot; in Bruges. This was close to the workshop of Gerard David, at the &quot;Vlamijncbrugghe&quot; and the former workshop of Hans Memling. Bruges, at that time, was one of the richest towns in Europe. Rich traders and merchants ordered diptychs and portraits for personal use. Isenbrandt painted mainly for private clients. However, there were some paintings that were created without any particular commission. He had enough work to even put out work to other painters in Bruges, as a legal suit from 1534 by Isenbrandt against Jan van Eyck (not the famous one) for non-delivery of paintings he had ordered, demonstrates. He was also appointed the agent in Bruges of the painter Adriaan Provoost (son of Jan Provoost), who had moved to Antwerp in 1530. Contemporary sources therefore mention Isenbrandt as a famous and well-to-do painter.

He married twice, the first time with Maria Grandeel, daughter of the painter Peter Grandeel. They had one child. After her death in 1537, he married again with Clementine de Haerne with whom he was married by 1543. This second marriage resulted in two daughters and a son. He also had an extramarital daughter with the innkeeper Katelijne van Brandenburch (who was at the same the mistress of the painter Ambrosius Benson).

When he died, at Bruges, in 1551, he was buried alongside his first wife at the cemetery of the St. Jacob church there; his children inherited no less than four houses with surrounding property.

==Professional life==
 
Along with Albert Cornelis (before 1513–1531) and Ambrosius Benson (before 1518–1550), a painter from Lombardy, he worked in the workshop of Bruges&#x27; leading painter Gerard David, while he was already a master at that time. Isenbrandt is mentioned in the book &quot;De Gandavensibus et Brugensibus eruditionis laude claris libri duo&quot; by the priest Antonius Sanderus, published in Amsterdam in 1624. This writer refers to texts of the Florentine Lodovico Guicciardini, the Schilderboeck of Karel van Mander and the (lost) notes of the Ghent jurist Dionysius Hardwijn (or Harduinus, 1530–1604). The latter, who had spent several years in Bruges about 1550, mentions Isenbrandt as a disciple of the old Gerard David, who excelled &quot;in nudes and in portraits&quot;. He may have travelled to Genoa in 1511 together with Joachim Patinir and Gerard David. The influence of Gerard David shows clearly in the composition and the landscape background of the works attributed to Isenbrandt.

In his critical exhibition catalogue of Early Flemish Masters in Bruges in 1902, the Ghent great connoisseur of early Flemish Art and art historian Georges Hulin de Loo, came to the conclusion that Isenbrandt was actually the anonymous &quot;Master of the Seven Sorrows of the Virgin&quot; and the author of a large body of paintings previously attributed to Gerard David and Jan Mostaert by the German art historian Gustav Friedrich Waagen. He is therefore sometimes called the Pseudo-Mostaert. Even if this attribution to Isenbrandt cannot be proven without doubt, it is now generally accepted by some art historians, although many others regard Isenbrandt as a convenient label for a body of work by many different artists.

No surviving painting can be firmly documented as by Isenbrandt. A document stating that he sent some paintings from Antwerp to Spain shows that worked for export as well as the local market, and suggests his international reputation. Two paintings usually associated with him are dated, both in 1518 :
*&quot;Portrait of Paulus de Nigro&quot; (Groeninge Museum, Bruges) (1518)
*The &quot;Bröhmse&quot; triptych with the &quot;Adoration by the Magi&quot;. This was his most monumental work, but it was destroyed in 1942 when the Marienkirche in Lübeck was bombed. For Max J. Friedländer, this was the key work to be used in establishing his style.

One of his first paintings (c. 1518–1521) was the &quot;Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows, adored by the family Van de Velde&quot;, a diptych that can be seen in the Church of Our Lady in Bruges and its left panel in the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels.

It was common practice for major artists, such as Isenbrandt, to paint only the major parts of his paintings, such as faces and the flesh parts of his figures. His faces and flesh areas are set apart by brown pigment. The background was then filled in by assistants. The end quality of a work depended largely on the quality of the execution and the competency of the assistants, leading to an uneven quality of his works. These assistants also painted, as this was common practice in those times, many versions of the &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, that were then attributed to Isenbrandt, giving him the reputation of having had an enormous body of work. The exhibition in Bruges of Early Netherlandish painting in 1902 showed therefore a large collection of his works. Unlike many contemporary colleagues, he is only documented with one assistant, Cornelis van Callenberghe, who joined his workshop in 1520.

In 1520 he worked, together with Albert Cornelis and Lanceloot Blondeel, on the decorations for the Triumphal Entry of Emperor Charles V into Bruges.

His paintings are executed meticulously and with great refinement. His figures are painted in warmer tones and more lively colours, than the works of Gerard David. Especially the flaming red or the dark blue set against an idyllic background of a lush, hilly landscape with castles situated on top of a vertical rock (typical for Isenbrandt), sinuous rivers and thick-leaved trees (showing the influence of Gerard David). He not only copied the compositions of Gerard David, but also from older painters such as Jan van Eyck, Hugo van der Goes and Hans Memling. He borrowed compositions from Jan Gossaert (leading to the confusion with this painter) and drawings from Albrecht Dürer and Martin Schongauer. Such borrowing from older compositions was the order of the day and common practice. Nevertheless, the paintings of Adriaen Isenbrandt retain their individuality.

He also painted some portraits, such as the portrait of Paulus de Nigro (), &quot;Man weighing gold&quot; (1515–1520) () and &quot;Young Man with a Rosary&quot; (). These portraits, even if they are stereotypical and lifeless, are executed with a soft touch and sfumato effect in the contours.

The influence of the Italian Renaissance can be seen in the detailed addition of fashionable scenery elements such as volutes, antique pillars and ram&#x27;s heads, such as in his painting of the &quot;Mass of Saint Gregory the Great&quot; (). and &quot;Mary and Child&quot; (1520–1530) (). Through these elements he may be regarded as a precursor of the Renaissance painter Lanceloot Blondeel.

He is often compared with Ambrosius Benson (c. 1495–1550), a painter from Lombardy who emigrated to Bruges. He may have introduced the sfumato technique to Isenbrandt.

Together with Benson, Isenbrandt belongs to a generation overlapping and succeeding the generation of Gerard David and Jan Provoost.

<text>Paul Charles Caravello (July 12, 1950 – November 24, 1991), better known as Eric Carr, was an American musician. He was the drummer for the rock band Kiss from 1980 until his death in 1991. Caravello was selected as the new Kiss drummer after Peter Criss departed. He created the stage name &quot;Eric Carr&quot; and designed his on-stage Fox persona. He remained a member of Kiss until his death from heart cancer in 1991.

== Early life ==
Born as Paul Charles Caravello on July 12, 1950, to Albert (1927–2022) and Connie Caravello (1929–2010), Carr was of Italian descent. He grew up at 1043 Belmont Ave. in the East New York section of Brooklyn in New York City. Because his father worked most of the time, Carr did not see that much of him, and &quot;never went to a baseball game or that kind of stuff&quot; with his father. He spent a lot of time alone in his room, playing with toy soldiers and toy monsters.

Caravello attended the High School of Art and Design. He planned at first to be a cartoonist, then changed his mind quickly thereafter and decided to study photography. According to him, he ended up wasting &quot;absolutely every day of high school. I got no work done, did nothing to further my career, wasted time, and wound up getting drunk in the darkroom with my friends all the time. We never got caught because we could see through the one-way glass whenever a teacher would come. It wasn&#x27;t like I was getting drunk every day, you know. Half a cup of vodka in those days was enough to get you drunk.&quot; However, he has described himself as overall &quot;a real good kid. I didn&#x27;t do anything to make trouble.&quot;

In February 1964, Caravello watched the Beatles performance on The Ed Sullivan Show and was immediately captivated by the group, particularly Ringo Starr. He collected several books and pots from the kitchen to create a makeshift drum kit and began teaching himself how to play drums.

Caravello was one of only two students in his high school who had long hair, mostly due to his love of the Beatles. He recalled that &quot;I used to Dippity-Do my hair down, to make it stay flat. I used to have a Beatles haircut, but my hair&#x27;s curly, so I couldn&#x27;t get it to lay flat like the Beatles&#x27;. So I&#x27;d get the stuff Dippity-Do, drench my hair with it, and I&#x27;d take a piece of my Mom&#x27;s nylon stocking, tie a knot in one end, and pull it over my head like a burglar. I was sleeping like that for probably two years with that on my head every night.&quot;

Caravello graduated from high school in 1967. At around that time, riots started to occur in New York City, followed by white flight that started to make his neighborhood more predominantly African-American. Caravello stated that this was not a concern to him, because &quot;I never had any problems with anybody, I had black friends, and I never grew up thinking in those kinds of terms.&quot;.

== Early career ==
Caravello purchased a small drum kit that consisted of snare, kick, and a tom. The kit had a black oyster finish that was similar to Ringo&#x27;s kit. Within a few months he added a floor tom. Sometime in 1965 he joined his first band, The Allures. They played a blend of Latino music and Beatles songs. The Allures did not last long, perhaps only a few months.

Caravello then asked his friend in junior high school, Thomas, to join him on bass while they looked for other musicians. Shortly after starting high school he met John, who was interested in learning to play the guitar. The three young musicians called the group The Cellarmen because they practiced in Caravello&#x27;s cellar. Thomas and Caravello soon began working as a team and eventually wrote two Beatles-inspired songs, &quot;Your Turn to Cry&quot; and &quot;I Cry at Night.&quot; The drummer felt confident in the band and soon designed stylized lettering of the band&#x27;s name and printed The Cellarmen on the front of his kick drum. However, the band broke up in late 1965 or early 1966.

In March 1966, Caravello met keyboardist Victor Cohen and bassist Dave Bartky. Guitarist Bob Pryor joined the band within a few weeks. They played cover songs and their goal was to become good enough to play in the clubs. They practiced several times a week and soon had considerable number of songs ready. They kept The Cellarmen name because at the time they did not have enough money to purchase a new kick drum skin. Besides, the band still practiced in Caravello&#x27;s cellar, so the name was appropriate. The Cellarmen&#x27;s first gig was in August 1966. They were strictly a cover band playing popular music of the times.

The Cellarmen played together until late 1968. In the two year and a half years together they had progressed musically and financially, and were represented by Ruston &amp; Brenner, a large booking agency in New York City. They also recorded the two songs Caravello had written with the previous iteration of The Cellarmen. The two songs appear on the Jody Records label.

During the last few months with The Cellarmen, Caravello added a second kick drum to his kit. He began exploring heavier music, such as Cream and Jimi Hendrix. After The Cellarmen disbanded. Caravello formed a new band called Things That Go Bump In The Night. This band played heavy music, but failed to gain traction in the clubs and soon disbanded.

In the spring of 1969, Caravello joined his three former bandmates from The Cellarmen and vocalist Gary Fray in their band, Smack. Caravello insisted he would work with this cover band only until the fall. Ruston &amp; Brenner continued booking Smack through the summer and band was soon in demand in the clubs.

In the fall of 1969, Caravello left Smack, but he did not have another band to join. In November 1970 he joined a band called Salt &amp; Pepper, a cover band playing music from multiple genres; the band was named that because half of the members were black and half were white. His old bandmate, Victor Cohen, was the keyboardist and recommended Caravello to the band. Salt &amp; Pepper played mostly Top 40 songs. As he described it later, &quot;Top-40 in those days was everything – funk, ballads, rock, country, and everything. It was a great time for radio.&quot;. Salt &amp; Pepper had marginal success playing other events, such as opening for Nina Simone in December 1971 at the Academy of Music (New York City).

In 1973 the band changed their name to &quot;Creation,&quot; now performing disco music as well as Top 40, Motown, and funk. In March 1973, Salt &amp; Pepper opened for Stevie Wonder at a benefit concert. By this time Caravello was playing an acrylic [Fibes Drums] kit.

In 1974 a fire broke out during a discothèque gig at Gulliver&#x27;s nightclub in Port Chester, New York, killing dozens of people including the band&#x27;s keyboardist, Damon DeFreis, and lead singer George D. Chase. Caravello escaped and was credited with saving two people, the other two members of Creation (not including himself), husband and wife John and Sarita Henderson. It was determined that the fire had been started by a thief in an adjacent building hoping to cover his tracks.

Ruston &amp; Brenner held a benefit to replace their ruined equipment. and Creation was back playing the clubs by the end of the year.

In 1975, Creation changed its name to Mother Nature/Father Time. They continued playing the mostly disco songs in the clubs.

In early 1978 Gregg Diamond, who had recently released an album title &quot;Bionic Boogie&quot;, hired Mother Nature-Father Time to play as the touring. Gregg did not go on tour as he was strictly a studio musician. Over the next year, Mother Nature-Father Time played gigs under that name and as Bionic Boogie. They enjoyed some success, such as playing in Walt Disney World in Florida, and playing on disco TV shows in Florida and Canada.

In the spring of 1979, producer Lewis Merenstein, who knew Casablanca Records founder Neil Bogart, received an offer to produce a disco record. He soon recruited Mother Nature-Father Time with guitarist Tom Siano writing three of the five songs. Caravello sang background vocals and played drums on the record. The album was titled &quot;Lightning&quot; and Casablanca released the band&#x27;s self-titled album on August 13, 1979.

The &quot;Lightning&quot; album and Diamond&#x27;s latest album &quot;Tiger, Tiger&quot; both failed to chart. The result was the end of the Caravello&#x27;s work with people he had known since 1970. Diamond did not hire Mother Nature-Father Time to tour and Mother Nature-Father Time broke up in October 1979. Caravello later described the band as &quot;like my family basically for nine years.&quot;

In December 1979, Caravello successfully auditioned for a four-piece rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll cover band called &quot;Flasher&quot;. After three weeks of rehearsals, they started playing at clubs. Flasher played the club circuit in New York City and Long Island for several months before Paul Turino, their keyboard player, quit to join a band that was signed to a record label and touring. Flasher continued as a power trio, with the three sharing vocal duties. They played songs by Joe Jackson, Van Halen, Led Zeppelin and Jimi Hendrix, among others.

Eventually, bookings diminished and Caravello become discouraged about his musical future after so many years trying to make it without a break and considered settling down with a non-musical career. &quot;We were making real (lousy) money – something like $10, $7 a night, whatever it was it was. Really, really terrible. Just by contrast, I used to make $15 a night when I was like 16 years old, and here I am almost 30 years old, and I&#x27;m making like $7 a night! So I wasn&#x27;t doing better, obviously – I was going in reverse.&quot; Caravello handed in his resignation in late May 1980 but agreed to play the remaining shows the band were booked for. At that point, he considered quitting music, having reached the age of 30 without any real success. In early June, Caravello had a chance meeting with Turino in a club in Queens called Poets. Caravello invited Turino to see Flasher play the following night at the same club. The next night, Turino told Caravello about Peter Criss&#x27;s departure from Kiss, and urged Caravello to audition to become Kiss&#x27; drummer.

== Kiss ==
=== Audition ===
Caravello applied for Kiss, submitting a cassette tape of Kiss&#x27; current single &quot;Shandi&quot; but with his vocals over the music instead of Paul Stanley&#x27;s vocals. &quot;It sounded great!&quot; he enthused years later. The application was put into a bright orange folder to make it stand out visually. Jayne Grodd, a Kiss staffer, told him later she had noticed the brightly colored envelope and so picked it to be one reviewed from the pile.

While sitting outside the room used for the audition, Caravello watched the three members of Kiss – Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons and Stanley – walk by to enter the room. He was one of the few people outside of the band&#x27;s circle of friends, family and music business partners, to see Kiss without make-up. &quot;Paul, I knew right away&quot;, he told a fanzine in 1990. &quot;The others I wasn&#x27;t sure about.&quot;

Caravello was the last drummer to audition for the band and asked Stanley, Simmons and Frehley to autograph the list of Kiss songs he was to play with the band, in case he never saw them again. &quot;But I knew I had it&quot;, he told a fanzine in 1990. According to Caravello, his audition was videotaped. He was also immediately comfortable, feeling the songs he had to play &quot;...were a snap.&quot; He knew the arrangements better than the band did, from learning the recorded versions of Kiss&#x27; albums. &quot;They had been on tour, and changed little things around,&quot; he said. He was not impressed with Kiss&#x27; performance at the audition. &quot;They were awful!&quot; he emphasized, &quot;I had to remind them, &quot;&#x27;No, I sing this harmony, you sing that one&#x27;, stuff like that. It was great! Right away we were working together. I know it impressed them.&quot;

Stanley later described Caravello&#x27;s audition: &quot;He was this guy who cleaned stoves for a living, and the first thing he said to us was &#x27;It&#x27;s a real pleasure to meet you. Let&#x27;s play.&#x27; We started playing and it was like thunder, even though he was the shortest guy in the room. It just fit like a glove. The one thing that probably sealed it for us was when, after the audition, he asked us for autographs. It wasn&#x27;t brown-nosing, it&#x27;s just that he was a real person.&quot;

A significant advantage for Caravello may have been his relative anonymity, as it was important for the band to maintain the mystique surrounding the members. Said Paul Stanley, &quot;It was really important to us that we got somebody who was unknown... We didn&#x27;t want somebody who last week was in Rod Stewart&#x27;s band or in Rainbow.&quot; Before they issued a press release announcing the induction of Caravello into Kiss, they subtracted three years from his actual age - in part to confuse those seeking information about his true identity, but also to help create an identification with Caravello: a young fan chosen from the crowd to be the new Kiss drummer!

=== Stage makeup and persona ===

After Caravello passed the audition, time was short and the band had some trouble coming up with a character persona and a stage name for him before his debut concert. &quot;We never actually told him he was in the band,&quot; stated Paul Stanley on USA Network&#x27;s &quot;Night Flight&quot; program in 1983, &quot;We just said: &quot;In two weeks we&#x27;re playing.&#x27;&quot;

Paul Stanley alleged that Caravello wanted to use the stage name &quot;Rusty Blade&quot; until Stanley dissuaded him. Caravello decided on &quot;Eric Carr&quot; quite carefully. He noticed that while the four members&#x27; full stage names were each three syllables long, Criss&#x27; name was the inverse of the other three band members&#x27; name syllable pattern – &#x27;Peter Criss&#x27; was two syllables followed by a single syllable. He decided to make his stage name sound the same rhythmically as Peter Criss&#x27; by choosing a double syllable first name and a single syllable last name so that when people said all four names together it would still fit the same to the ear. Carr was shortened from his birth name Caravello, and he chose Eric from a list of first names his girlfriend at the time had created. Paul Caravello remained his legal name.

For his Kiss persona, Carr initially tried &quot;The Hawk&quot;; this concept was apparently very difficult to realize in greasepaint – a suitable make-up design was never created, and the &quot;Hawk&quot; costume was a &quot;bright orange yellow!&quot; The idea was dropped after Paul Stanley mentioned that it looked like Big Bird. With the band on deadline (only two weeks before Carr&#x27;s stage debut), Carr came up with the make-up design for the persona of &quot;The Fox&quot;; Simmons liked it and thus the character was born. The original design was modified within days of Carr&#x27;s initial photo sessions and debut concert as a KISS member.

Carr&#x27;s first public performance was with the band in New York City&#x27;s Palladium on July 25, 1980. His parents, warned to not tell anyone their son was in Kiss (to maintain the mystique that no one knew what the new member looked like without make-up), attended the concert, and were recognized by a friend who worked with Carr at a repair shop – and had no idea the new Kiss member behind the kit was his former coworker. &quot; &#x27;What are you doing here?&#x27; &quot;, Carr&#x27;s father, Albert Caravello, related in the &quot;Tale of the Fox&quot; DVD, &quot; &#x27;You like Kiss?&#x27; I said, &quot;Yeah!&#x27; &quot; The next day, Bill Aucoin, KISS manager, told Carr that his makeup was indistinguishable from the audience and asked the drummer to refine his Fox makeup. On July 30, Carr was introduced to the public on an episode of the syndicated television youth show &quot;Kids Are People Too!,&quot; which aired in September 1980. This was the first time he wore the makeup that most fans identity him with. For Christmas in 1980, the Kiss organization bought Carr a Porsche—so their new drummer would ride around in appropriate rock-star style. The car broke down often, and caused Carr quite a bit of grief.

His persona remained consistent for three years until the band&#x27;s well-publicized removal of their stage makeup in September 1983, live on MTV. The drastic move came after declining album sales and a poorly attended US tour. Carr thought the band was coming to an end, but Kiss slowly turned their career descent into a rebound, and the band thrived once again. Carr earned a reputation amongst fans for being very friendly and approachable. He answered more mail than other band members, and often added messages to his autographs. Despite replacing an original member, he gained popularity among fans based on his personality and percussion skills.

=== Tenure in Kiss ===

On August 29, 1980, KISS began a European tour to support the &quot;Unmasked&quot; album. This was Carr&#x27;s introduction to playing to large audiences, such as the 30,000 fans in Milan, Italy on September 2. The European tour ended in mid-October, after which KISS flew to Australia for a four-week run on the Southern Continent and New Zealand, beginning on November 8 and concluding on December 2. Of the 11 shows, 10 were sold out and the highest attendance occurred in Melbourne (45,000). Carr&#x27;s first tour with KISS saw the band play 41 shows in 13 countries.

Carr&#x27;s first album with Kiss was 1981&#x27;s &quot;(Music from) The Elder&quot;, which marked a departure for the band toward a mystical art-rock direction. One of Carr&#x27;s contributions to the album, &quot;Under the Rose&quot;, is one of the few Kiss songs written in time and featured a Gregorian chant-style chorus. Carr also cowrote &quot;Escape From The Island&quot; with Frehley and producer Bob Ezrin. It was only the second instrumental recorded by Kiss. Poor album sales and lower chart position did not allow Kiss to tour to support &quot;The Elder&quot;.

During the summer of 1982, KISS dedicated themselves to creating a hard rock album that predominantly featured Carr&#x27;s drumming and his unique style. &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; was released on October 25, 1982. The heavy reverb on Carr&#x27;s drums was a unique sound not previously heard on a Kiss album. The album featured nine songs, none of which were written by Carr. In late December 1982, Kiss began their first tour of North America since the 1979 &quot;Dynasty&quot; tour. It was Carr&#x27;s first North American tour. The tour was poorly attended and ended in early April 1983 after only 53 shows. In June Kiss played in Brazil for the first time. The pent-up demand for Kiss resulted in high attendance, with approximately 137,000 people at the Rio de Janeiro show.

Carr received writing credits on &quot;All Hell&#x27;s Breakin&#x27; Loose&quot; from &quot; Lick It Up&quot;, &quot;Under the Gun&quot; from &quot;Animalize&quot;, and &quot;No, No, No&quot; from &quot;Crazy Nights&quot;. Carr said he found writing lyrics harder than writing music.

Besides drumming, Carr also played guitar, bass guitar and piano, and also sang background vocals. Occasionally he sang lead vocals, such as on &quot;Black Diamond&quot; and &quot;Young and Wasted&quot; live with Kiss. His first lead vocal in the studio was a re-recording of &quot;Beth&quot; (a song originally sung by Peter Criss) for the 1988 compilation album &quot;Smashes, Thrashes &amp; Hits&quot;. Carr recorded his version of the song in the same room in the Record Plant where the song was originally recorded, using the same backing track as Criss.

In 1989, he recorded a demo with Kiss lead guitarist Bruce Kulick. Carr wrote the music, played bass and drums, while Kulick played guitar. As Carr was not a proficient lyricist, he presented the demo to Simmons with the words to Marvin Gaye&#x27;s 1965 classic &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Peculiar&quot;. Simmons wrote new lyrics, which Carr recorded for the subsequent &quot;Hot in the Shade&quot; release. The song was released as &quot;Little Caesar&quot;. He performed the song a few times, but it wasn&#x27;t performed beyond the first month of the tour. Carr&#x27;s last live performance with Kiss was November 9, 1990, in New York City, at Madison Square Garden.

As a replacement member, Carr was a paid employee and did not have voting privileges, unlike the four founding members who shared profits and voting rights equally. Through Carr&#x27;s years in Kiss, his rank as an employee was a source of significant discontent for him. He felt excluded and unfairly treated as a second-class Kiss citizen, for instance not being allowed to share Simmons&#x27; and Stanley&#x27;s limousine, only getting minimal exposure in videos such as the Kiss eXposed VHS, or being partially cropped out of the &quot;Asylum&quot; album cover. Unlike fellow bandmember Bruce Kulick with the same status, Carr grew ever more frustrated and unhappy, culminating in his feeling of being ditched by Kiss during his 1991 hospitalization. In his autobiography, Peter Criss listed Carr as one of the people that Simmons and Stanley &quot;drove mad&quot;: Carr &quot;was reduced to sitting in his hotel room naked with the blinds all drawn, drinking and refusing to come out.&quot;. However, this account is questionable as Carr and Criss only met a few times during the 11 years Carr was in KISS. The two drummers were on friendly terms but did not regularly contact each other and were not friends.

Carr&#x27;s last recording with Kiss was for the song &quot;God Gave Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll to You II&quot;, which featured him on backing vocals. The last time Carr worked with Kiss was in July 1991 when Kiss filmed the video for &quot;God Gave Rock &#x27;N Roll to You&quot; with Carr playing drums. Carr&#x27;s last public appearance with the band was at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1991.

=== Paul Stanley memoir ===
In his 2014 memoir &quot;Face the Music: A Life Exposed&quot;, Kiss frontman Paul Stanley described Carr as a kind and talented, but troubled, soul. Carr allegedly fixated on the fact that he was neither going to be a founding member of Kiss, nor the band&#x27;s first drummer. After having just met drummer Eric Singer and remaining insecure despite being in good standing with Kiss, Carr made the prescient claim that Singer was going to replace him as the new drummer in the band, which ultimately did occur in 1992 (after Carr&#x27;s death). For long periods, he would not even talk to Stanley. In his book, Stanley also recalls several memorable Carr episodes, including one in which he went out with a female photographer who later took nude photos of him in a bathtub holding a glass of champagne, claiming that the photographer had promised not to publish them (the photos were soon publicized in the journal with which the photographer was associated).

== Influences and style ==
Carr was a powerful hard-hitting drummer and one of the first drummers to adopt the classic 1980s snare drum sound: a highly reverberated and low-tuned sound. In his 1980 resume sent to Kiss, Carr stated that his drumming style ranged from heavy metal and hard rock to pop and new wave claiming that &quot;I can adapt to most situations easily.&quot; He listed drummers John Bonham, Keith Moon and Lenny White as influences.

In addition, Carr was an avid fan of The Beatles and the band&#x27;s drummer Ringo Starr. In an interview he recalled, &quot;I was caught up in the whole Beatlemania thing. I guess I was attracted to the drums because of the feeling of the rhythm and how it moved you, just sitting in your seat. I loved the way Ringo moved. I identified with him at the time&quot;. Photographs of Carr during his high school years show his hair cut and styled in the iconic Beatles haircut.

Carr&#x27;s interest in double bass drumming came from his admiration of Ginger Baker and John Bonham, once telling &quot;16&quot; magazine, &quot;I just loved the way John Bonham played drums&quot;. Carr also had a love of all types of music; songwriter Adam Mitchell once described Carr as knowing a lot about folk, R&amp;B and other non-rock styles. In a 1983 interview, Carr told USA Network interviewer Al Bandero that he listened to &quot;a lot&quot; of Neil Young, and liked many different types of music. Simmons has stated that Carr&#x27;s harder drumming style pushed Kiss into becoming a heavier band than it had been when jazz-inspired Criss was the band&#x27;s drummer.

== Illness and death ==
In February 1991, Carr began feeling ill. Medical tests initially revealed what appeared to be manageable health issues. However, further tests determined that he had heart cancer. In April 1991, Carr underwent a series of surgeries to remove tumors in his right atrium and lungs in an effort to restore heart function and prevent the cancer&#x27;s growth. Soon after Carr&#x27;s diagnosis, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons replaced him with session drummer Eric Singer to commence new recordings for the band&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;Revenge&quot;. After recovering from the multiple surgeries, Carr pressed Stanley and Simmons to let him back in the band. Stanley and Simmons refused; both have stated they repeatedly told Carr to focus on his cancer treatments and they would allow him to return to Kiss once he regained his health. The doctors refused to let Carr leave the hospital on any conditions, no matter how he pleaded with them. Gene Simmons revealed that Eric Carr&#x27;s favorite food was McDonald&#x27;s, and that he and Paul Stanley would sneak out to bring back fries and other food to share with everyone, including Carr.

By mid-1991, the band was preparing to shoot the music video for their upcoming single &quot;God Gave Rock and Roll to You II&quot;. Despite his poor health, Carr asked Stanley and Simmons to allow him to be in the video. They ultimately agreed, after the doctors let the band know that Carr had only two or three months left to live. The doctors decided that Carr might as well do what he wanted and be happy in his last few weeks.

Carr flew to Los Angeles to film the video in July 1991. By that point, he had lost his hair due to chemotherapy treatments and was wearing a wig. During the filming of the video, Carr was in enormous pain, taking medications periodically throughout the filming. After the video shoot, Carr flew back to New York to continue cancer treatments; his health had deteriorated to the point where he was unable to play drums for the recording sessions for &quot;Revenge&quot;. Carr&#x27;s replacement, Eric Singer, played on the album&#x27;s tracks.

Carr&#x27;s last public appearance with Kiss was at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1991. Not long afterwards, he suffered an aneurysm and was rushed to the hospital. Several days later, he suffered a brain hemorrhage and never regained consciousness. He died on November 24, 1991, at the age of 41. His death came on the same day as Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of the British rock band Queen, whose death attracted more media attention. Carr had also been in a nearly four-year relationship with future model/actress Carrie Stevens at the time of his death. He had been planning on giving her an engagement ring for her birthday.

In keeping with Carr&#x27;s accessibility to his fans, his family decided to open his funeral service to the public while reserving the interment as a private event. Carr is interred in Cedar Hill Cemetery in the town of Newburgh, New York.

Although it was not publicized at the time, Carr&#x27;s death was considered controversial amongst his family and Kiss. Both Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons were labeled the &quot;bad guys&quot; by Carr for booting him out of the band and not supporting him in his time of need. The two were not made aware of this until they attended his funeral and were treated with hostility by Carr&#x27;s family and friends. Stanley wrote in his autobiography that, at the time, he believed the allegation of mistreating Carr was simply untrue and that he did what he thought was right to support him. However, during Carr&#x27;s service, Stanley admitted to &quot;sobbing uncontrollably&quot; and came to regret how he had treated Carr during his illness.

== Legacy and accolades ==
=== &quot;Rockology&quot; and &quot;Rockheads&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; ===
Former Kiss guitarist Bruce Kulick, along with Carr&#x27;s family, released Carr&#x27;s first and only solo album in 1999, titled &quot;Rockology&quot;, which featured many demos that Kulick and Carr worked on together (along with songwriter and friend Adam Mitchell). The CD features several songs with Carr on lead vocals as well as on bass guitar, along with Kulick on guitars and Mitchell assisting Carr with many of the background vocals. This album includes &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Waiting&quot; and &quot;Tiara&quot;, a song that he originally wrote for his planned children&#x27;s cartoon show called &quot;Rockheads&quot;, a rock band parody featuring four characters (Slider, Clive, Scruffy and Punky) with different characteristics and personalities. It is speculated that Carr is a relative of skater Perry Caravello, star of the cult film classic &quot;Windy City Heat&quot;. However, when contacted via Instagram in late 2021, he responded with “Eric Carr, from the band KISS? I am not sure… It might be possible though”. In 2011, Carr&#x27;s family released an album of his unreleased songs called &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. The album consists of 18 songs and runs 43 minutes in length, and includes Carr singing &quot;Shandi&quot;, which was taken directly from his 1980 tape he sent into KISS for his audition.

=== Tributes ===
As a tribute, the group&#x27;s 1992 release &quot;Revenge&quot; featured what is said to be the only drum solo Carr ever recorded with the band, entitled &quot;Carr Jam 1981&quot;, a jam session recorded for the &quot;Music From &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot; sessions (former Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley&#x27;s original guitar part was overdubbed by Bruce Kulick). Much of the soloing was seasoned during Kiss&#x27; 1980 Unmasked Tour of Europe and Australia, and put down during the &quot;Music From &quot;The Elder&quot;&quot; sessions. Carr had for years been trying to get his hands on a copy of the solo for his personal collection, but his request was always rebuffed by Bob Ezrin with the excuse that he did not know where the masters for the session were. After Carr&#x27;s death, the solo surfaced as &quot;Carr Jam 1981&quot;.

The &quot;Revenge&quot; album was dedicated to Carr. He was also paid homage on the &quot;Kiss My Ass&quot; and &quot;Kissology 2&quot; videos. However, the band declined a tribute concert that was requested by a circle of fans the year after his death. Simmons stated, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to do a tribute concert. We are dedicating the album to his name, but no concerts in his name. It&#x27;s not our style.&quot;

A further tribute was produced in 1992 called &quot;Eric Carr: The Memorial Tribute&quot;. It was first broadcast live on 88.1 FM / WCWP, where Carr had been interviewed three years earlier while doing press for the &quot;Hot in the Shade&quot; album. Running for approximately three hours, the tribute featured a re-broadcast of the interview, interspersed with biographical information and details of Carr&#x27;s extracurricular projects, along with all the officially released songs Carr had written or cowritten. Though broadcast just once, &quot;Eric Carr: The Memorial Tribute&quot; was released several years later (seemingly in an unofficial capacity) as a two-tape box set, designed to resemble the Kiss solo albums. It featured a newly commissioned painting of Carr in his fox makeup, patterned after the rarely seen original by Eraldo Carugati (the artist who did the paintings for the original four Kiss solo album covers, plus one of Carr that was never officially released).

Only July 25, 1995, 15 years to the day of Carr&#x27;s Kiss debut, he was posthumously inducted into the &quot;Rock Walk Hall of Fame&quot; at Guitar Center in Hollywood. Carr&#x27;s parents, Albert and Connie Caravello, accepted a plaque in Carr&#x27;s honor. Former Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley was inducted in the &quot;Rock Walk&quot; during the same ceremony. Frehley&#x27;s handprint was placed to the right of the Kiss display. Carr&#x27;s acknowledgment was a bronze plaque with his name, autograph and a separate icon of the Fox makeup he wore. Peter Criss was added to the Rock Walk in 1996, with his handprints placed to the left of the KISS display.

On numerous solo tours since Carr&#x27;s death, Frehley would play &quot;Breakout&quot; (with lyrics written by Carr and Frehley and later re-recorded as &quot;Carr Jam &#x27;81&quot; on Kiss&#x27;s &quot;Revenge&quot; album) and dedicate it to Carr, who Frehley hopes is &quot;checking out the show up there&quot;. Frehley also dedicated his 2009 solo album &quot;Anomaly&quot; to Carr.

There is a hidden &quot;easter egg&quot; in the 2007 &quot;Kissology II&quot; DVD collection (on disc three at the end of the production credits) showing a family videotape made of Carr, on his hospital bed, speaking into the camera thanking his fans for their cards, letters, and concern about his health. Dressed in white, Carr then exits the bed, and begins walking away only to return and moon the camera in rock n&#x27; roll style.

On March 21, 2011, a book that explored Carr&#x27;s entire life and musical career was released, titled &quot;The Eric Carr Story&quot;.

On August 13, 2011, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Carr&#x27;s death, a tribute concert was held in Atlanta, Georgia called &quot;Night of the Fox: The Eric Carr Tribute Concert&quot;. The main act, going under the name Little Caesar, played a 90-minute set of songs related to Carr. Made up mostly of Kiss songs from Carr&#x27;s time in the band, the show also featured a song from &quot;Rockology&quot; (&quot;Eyes of Love&quot;) plus songs written or co-written by Carr but recorded by other artists, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave Me Lonely&quot;, a song recorded by Bryan Adams which was written by Carr for inclusion on &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot; album, but was rejected. Also, a tribute album featuring never released songs and interviews called &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; was released by his family. The album featured members and former members of Kiss, Twisted Sister, Seether, ZO2, Europe. The album was released on November 8, 2011.

In July 2005, Carr was voted the tenth best drummer of all time by Planet Rock. No other member of Kiss was given the distinction of making the top ten in the categories of vocalist, bassist or guitarist. Carr was one of only two American drummers to make the list, with all others being either British or Canadian.

Bruce Kulick released a YouTube video titled Eric Carr &quot;The Legend Lives On&quot; (30th Anniversary Tribute) in 2021.

On November 9, 2023, the first book in an unauthorized biographical series, Eric Carr Revealed, was published. &quot;The Rise of the Fox&quot; explores Carr&#x27;s life in detail from his birth in 1950 up to KISS entering the studio to record the 1982 album &quot;Creatures of the Night&quot;.

On January 9, 2024, Goldmine (magazine) placed Carr fourth on a list of drummers who improved or transformed existing bands when they joined.

<text>Gelonus () was, according to Herodotus, the capital of the Gelonians.
== Search for Gelonus ==

In his account of Scythia (&quot;Inquiries&quot; book 4), Herodotus writes that the Gelonii were formerly Greeks, having settled away from the coastal emporia among the Budini, where they &quot;use a tongue partly Scythian and partly Greek&quot;:&quot;The Budini for their part, being a large and numerous nation, are all mightily blue-eyed and ruddy. And a city among them has been built, a wooden city, and the name of the city is Gelonus. Of its wall then in size each side is of thirty stades and high and all wooden. And their homes are wooden and their shrines. For indeed there is in the very place Greek gods’ shrines adorned in the Greek way with statues, altars and wooden shrines and for triennial Dionysus festivals in honour of Dionysus...Above the Sauromatae (Sarmatians), possessing the second region, dwell the Budini, whose territory is thickly wooded with trees of every kind. The Budini are a large and powerful nation: they have all deep blue eyes, and bright red hair. The Budini, however, do not speak the same language as the Geloni, nor is their mode of life the same. They are the aboriginal people of the country, and are nomads; unlike any of the neighbouring races, they eat &#x27;phtheir&#x27;. Their country is thickly planted with trees of all manner of kinds. In the very woodiest part is a broad deep lake, surrounded by marshy ground with reeds growing on it. Here otters are caught, and beavers, with another sort of animal which has a square face. With the skins of this last the natives border their capotes: and they also get from them a remedy, which is of virtue in diseases of the womb...Beyond the Budini, as one goes northward, first there is a desert, seven days&#x27; journey across...&quot;The fortified settlement of Gelonus was reached by the Persian army of Darius in his assault on Scythia during the late 6th century BC, already burned to the ground, the Budini having abandoned it before the Persian advance. The Scythians sent a message to Darius: &quot;We are free as wind and what you can catch in our land is only the wind&quot;. By employing a scorched earth strategy, they avoided battles, leaving &quot;earth without grass&quot; by burning the steppe in front of the advancing Persians (Herodotus). The Persian army returned without a single battle or any significant success.

According to some researchers, the Budinis were a Finnic tribe ruled by the Scythians.

Excavations at near the village of Bilsk near Poltava in Ukraine (Coordinates ) have led to suggestions by archaeologist Boris Shramko and others identifying it as the Scythian capital Gelonus. It is strategically situated on the exact boundary between the steppe and forest-steppe. Several other locations have traditionally been named by Russian archaeologists, such as Saratov (according to Ivan Zabelin) or a location near the Don River closer to the Volga River.

According to Herodotus, each side of Gelonus is 30 stades long, the area in today&#x27;s units would be about 30 square kilometres. The archeological site around Bilsk, including necropolis, comprises about 80 km², and the fortifications enclose some 40 km². The north-south axis, along the Vorskla River is 17 km long. The remains of walls up to 12 metres are visible today and stretch over the horizon. The total length of the ramparts is 33 km. Inside the fortification, lay three &quot;keeps&quot;, 150,000 m², 650,000 m², and 720,000 m² in area, surrounded by eroded earth walls still up to 16 metres high. Several kurgans reminded the inhabitants of the ancient Scythian burial tradition.

== Mythology ==
In Greek mythology, Gelonus was the son of Echidna and Heracles, he had an older brother Agathyrsus and a younger Scythes. Hylea is pointed to be where was the Echidna&#x27;s cave between people Arimi or Harimi, the Greeks on the Euxine believed that this was somewhere in Scythia.

<text>The United States Army War College (USAWC) is a U.S. Army staff college in Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, with a Carlisle postal address, on the 500-acre (2 km2) campus of the historic Carlisle Barracks. It provides graduate-level instruction to senior military officers, government officials, and civilians to prepare them for senior leadership assignments and responsibilities. Each year, a number of Army colonels and lieutenant colonels are considered by a board for admission. Approximately 800 students attend at any one time, half in a two-year-long distance learning program, and the other half in an on-campus, full-time resident program lasting ten months. Upon completion, the college grants its graduates a master&#x27;s degree in Strategic Studies.

The Army War College is a split-functional institution. Emphasis is placed on research and students are also instructed in leadership, strategy, and joint-service/international operations. It is one of the senior service colleges including the Naval War College and the USAF Air War College. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Defense operates the National War College.

==Mission==
According to U.S. Army Regulation 10–87, the Army War College &quot;educates and develops leaders for service at the strategic level while advancing knowledge in the global
application of landpower.&quot;

==History==

Established from the principles learned in the Spanish–American War, the college was founded by Secretary of War Elihu Root and President Theodore Roosevelt, and formally established by General Order 155 on 27 November 1901. Washington Barracks, now called Fort Lesley J. McNair, in Washington, D.C. was chosen as the site. Roosevelt attended the Masonic laying of the cornerstone of Roosevelt Hall on 21 February 1903.

The first president of the Army War College was Major General Samuel B. M. Young in July 1902 and the first students attended the college in 1904.

During the presidency of Montgomery M. Macomb in 1916, President Woodrow Wilson accused students and staff of planning for taking part in an offensive war, even though the United States had not entered World War I. Wilson was unconvinced by Macomb&#x27;s explanation that the college was concerned only with the intellectual growth and professional development of its students, and insisted that the school curtail its activities in order to ensure that the U.S. maintained its neutrality.

Malin Craig served as commandant prior to being appointed Chief of Staff of the United States Army in 1936, and he was succeeded by Walter S. Grant. The college remained at Washington Barracks until the 1940s, when it was closed due to World War II. It reopened in 1950 at Fort Leavenworth, and moved one year later to its present location.

==Center for Strategic Leadership==
The Center for Strategic Leadership (CSL) emphasizes experiential education, senior leader education, support to Army senior leader research, and support to both U.S. Army War College (USAWC) and Army Senior Leader strategic communication efforts. CSL&#x27;s professional staff and Collins Hall facility host, support, develop, and conduct events, including workshops, symposia, conferences, games, and exercises focused on a broad range of strategic leadership and national security issues and concepts in support of the USAWC, the U.S. Army, and the Interagency and Joint Communities.

===Basic Strategic Art Program===

The Basic Strategic Art Program is one of the academic programs taught at the U.S. Army War College. When the program was founded in 2003, its purpose was to provide those officers who had been newly designated into Functional Area 59 (Strategist, formerly Strategic Plans &amp; Policy) an introduction to strategy and to the skills, knowledge, and attributes needed as a foundation for their progressive development as army strategists.

FA 59 officers have been deployed to combat since the onset of the War on Terror following the September 11 attacks in 2001. Since then, graduates of this program served in key positions in Iraq and Afghanistan, all combatant commands, and at the Pentagon.

==Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute==
The Peacekeeping and Stability Operations Institute (PKSOI) is located at the War College. The institute&#x27;s mission is to serve as the U.S. Military&#x27;s Center of Excellence for Stability and Peace Operations at the strategic and operational levels in order to improve military, civilian agency, international, and multinational capabilities and execution.

<text>Frederick I (1145–1167) was duke of Swabia, succeeding his cousin Frederick Barbarossa in 1152.

He was the son of King Conrad III of Germany and his second wife Gertrude von Sulzbach and thus the direct heir of the crown, had there been true heredity. However, on his death bed, Conrad III allegedly advised the only two persons present, his nephew Frederick Barbarossa and the bishop of Bamberg, to nominate Frederick Barbarossa; and handed the Imperial insignia to him.

Barbarossa wasted no time in getting the Bavarian clerics to endorse him, and had the archbishop of Cologne convene a hurried election. There the electors of the Empire (minus their &quot;primus inter pares&quot;, Archbishop Henry of Mainz, an ally of the pope) elected Frederick Barbarossa to be king, instead of his six-year-old cousin Frederick. The younger man became duke of Swabia instead.

Frederick participated in Barbarossa&#x27;s campaigns in Italy, becoming one of the many casualties of the Imperial army. He succumbed to disease after occupying Rome in 1167. Barbarossa then gave Swabia to his own three-year-old son, Frederick V.

==Marriage==
Frederick IV married Gertrude of Bavaria. She was a daughter of Henry the Lion and his first wife Clementia of Zähringen. They had no known children.

Gertrude survived him and married Canute VI of Denmark. She died childless.

<doc id="669254" wikidata="Q2190533" url="?curid=669254" title="Frederick V, Duke of Swabia">
<text>Frederick V of [[Hohenstaufen]] (Pavia, 16 July 1164 – c. 1170) was Duke of Swabia from 1167 to his death. He was the eldest son of Frederick I Barbarossa and Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy.

==Life==

In April 1165 Frederick was betrothed to Eleanor, daughter of King Henry II of England and his wife Eleanor of Aquitaine. The marriage, however, never took place due to Frederick´s early death.

In August 1167, Duke Frederick IV of Swabia died on an Italian campaign. As the only living son of King Conrad III of Germany (uncle and predecessor of Barbarossa) and without any offspring from his short-lived marriage with Gertrude of Bavaria, with him his line died out and his domains were devolved to Barbarossa. The Emperor appointed three-years-old Frederick as the new Duke of Swabia, becoming in Frederick V.

In June 1169 during the &quot;Hoftag&quot; in Bamberg, Frederick V&#x27;s younger brother Henry was elected King of the Romans and crowned on 15 August at Aachen Cathedral. It can be assumed that Frederick V was bypassed from the royal succession because he had a weak constitution since birth and wasn&#x27;t expected to survive infancy.

Two medieval sources confirms that Frederick V was still alive when his brother was elected King of the Romans. Since his fiancée Eleanor was married to King Alfonso VIII of Castile in 1170, is assumed that he died in mid-1169 or early 1170.

Frederick V was buried in Lorch Abbey, the royal necropolis of the Staufen dynasty, donated by his great-grandfather Frederick I, Duke of Swabia. In 1475 Abbot Nikolaus Schenk von Arberg had the remains of all the members of the Staufen dynasty buried in Lorch transferred to a late Gothic tombstone, which is now in the central nave of Lorch Abbey.

After his death, Frederick V&#x27;s name passed to Barbarossa&#x27;s third son, who was originally called Conrad, who succeeded his late brother as Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia; in this way, the familiar and leading Staufen name Frederick must be preserved. Since Otto, the next son of Barbarossa born after Conrad/Frederick VI, was probably born during June–July 1170, Frederick V must have died some time before, otherwise the rather unusual renaming of Conrad would have been without purpose, because the Emperor could simply have called the next son Frederick (instead of Otto).

<text>Frederick VI of [[Hohenstaufen]] (February 1167 – 20 January 1191) was Duke of Swabia from 1170 until his death at the siege of Acre.

==Life==
Frederick VI of Hohenstaufen was born in Modigliana in the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna. He was the third son of Frederick I Barbarossa and Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy. Originally named Conrad, he took the name of Frederick after the death of his eldest brother Frederick V, Duke of Swabia in 1170. He also succeeded him as Duke Frederick VI of Swabia, being the sixth in unbroken succession Duke of Swabia with the leading Staufen name of Frederick.

In the older literature, Conrad/Frederick VI&#x27;s older brother and predecessor Duke Frederick V of Swabia was partly overlooked, because was thought to be identical to as Conrad/Frederick VI, and for this reason he was therefore not counted as Frederick VI, but referred to as Frederick V. The fact that a younger brother born in 1172, the later Conrad II, Duke of Swabia, was given the name Conrad, which had been able to use because Conrad/Frederick VI renaming and which also had a long tradition within the Staufen dynasty, creates additional confusion when identifying these three sons of Frederick I Barbarossa.

Frederick I Barbarossa appointed the noble Degenhard von Hellenstein as &quot;Prokurator&quot; (Governor) for the Duchy of Swabia while his son was underage. In 1179 the Emperor granted to Frederick VI in addition to the Duchy of Swabia, some areas acquired in Upper Swabia and Bavaria on the basis of contracts of inheritance with Duke Welf I of Bavaria and Count Rudolf of Pfullendorf. For the first a lion was found on a Hohenstaufen coat of arms in a seal of Frederick VI dated around 1181. This design was in also in a 1220 seal of Duke Henry of Swabia, later Staufen King Henry (VII) of Germany. The extended version of this seal with a three-lion crest was currently part of the Coat of arms of Baden-Württemberg.

In 1181, Frederick VI was betrothed to a seven-years-old daughter of King Valdemar I of Denmark, whose identity is uncertain. After the brother of the bride and new King Canute VI of Denmark refused to give half of her dowry, the Emperor decided to send the princess (who had been living in Germany for five years at the time in preparation for her marriage) back to Denmark in 1187 still a virgin (lat: &quot;intacta&quot;). The Danish princess could be Ingeborg —whose assumed birth year was around 1175 and would fit with the repudiated child bride—, who later had an unhappy marriage with King Philip II of France.

At the Diet of Pentecost in Mainz on 20 May 1184, Frederick VI, together with his brother Henry VI, King of the Romans, personally received the accolade from their father. The Emperor&#x27;s sons and many princes, who followed their example and did not want to be inferior to them in this respect, gave the knights and minstrels gifts in the form of horses, precious clothes, gold and silver. This was followed by a riding event called gyrum, at which the knights showed their skills in swinging shields, banners and lances. Among the alleged 20,000 participants were the emperor and his sons. The next day the riding events continued. In the following week fighting games were to take place in Ingelheim. However, a storm caused several tents and the wooden church to collapse and also caused deaths among the celebrants. This was interpreted as a divine sign and the celebration was not continued.

On 27 March 1188, Frederick VI made a solemn oath to join his father on the Third Crusade. On 11 May 1189, he set out with the Crusader army from Regensburg. In his journey he arrived to the Kingdom of Hungary, where he was betrothed to Constance, a daughter of King Béla III, an ally of Barbarossa. Frederick VI&#x27;s early death in the Crusade prevented the marriage from proceeding; some years later, in 1198, Constance became in the second wife of King Ottokar I of Bohemia.

As part of his father&#x27;s army, Frederick VI commanded the van while Barbarossa commanded the rearguard. Upon hearing his father&#x27;s troops were under attack, he rushed back on horseback with his troops to reinforce them. However, he also had an important role at both the Battle of Philomelion and Battle of Iconium in May 1190. Following his father&#x27;s death on 10 June 1190 in the Saleph River in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, Frederick VI took command of the German forces and led them south towards Antioch. Although a large number of the Crusaders left the army and sailed from Antioch to their homeland, Frederick VI wanted to move to Jerusalem with his remaining army. In Tripoli, a large part of his companions became ill on malaria, which is why only around 700 knights arrived with him in early October 1190 to besiege the city of Acre. While at Acre, Frederick VI wrote his brother, Henry VI, asking for him to gain papal recognition for the hospital at Acre. Having also been stricken with malaria, Frederick VI died on 20 January 1191 and was buried in Acre. Due to Acre remaining occupied by Saladin&#x27;s troops at that time, the remaining crusaders were unable to enter the city and left the Holy Land after Frederick VI&#x27;s death.

<doc id="669256" wikidata="Q664749" url="?curid=669256" title="Conrad II, Duke of Swabia">
<text>Conrad II (February/March 1172 – 15 August 1196), was Duke of Rothenburg (1188–1191) and Swabia from 1191 until his death. He was the fifth son of Frederick I Barbarossa and Beatrice I, Countess of Burgundy.

==Life==

After the third-born son of the Emperor, who was originally called Conrad, had been renamed Frederick around 1170, this first name, which had a long tradition in the Staufen dynasty, had been freed up for a younger son.

Conrad was invested by his father with the Franconian domains which reverted to the German crown after the death of Frederick IV, Duke of Swabia in 1167; this certainly happened at the latest in 1188 when he was first referred to as &quot;dux de Rotenburch&quot; (Duke of Rothenburg). In addition, the young prince also received the lands of Weißenburg and Eger.

On 23 April 1188 Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and King Alfonso VIII of Castile signed the Treaty of Seligenstadt, under which was arranged the betrothal between Conrad —son of the German Emperor— and Berengaria —eldest and only surviving child of the Castilian King, and thus the heiress presumptive of her father. Conrad then marched to Castile, where in Carrión de los Condes the engagement was celebrated and he was knighted in July 1188, making him a servant of his new lord and future father-in-law, King Alfonso VIII. Berengaria&#x27;s status as heiress of Castile was based in part on documentation in the treaty and marriage contract, which specified that she would inherit the Castilian throne after her father or any childless brothers who may come along. Conrad would only be allowed to co-rule as her spouse, and Castile would not become part of the Holy Roman Empire. Furthermore, he was not allowed to claim the throne for himself in case of Alfonso VIII&#x27;s death but was obliged to defend and protect the kingdom until Berengaria would arrive in case of her absence. The treaty also documented traditional rights and obligations between the future sovereign and the nobility.

The wedding was never solemnized, due to the bride&#x27;s young age. In addition, Conrad and Berengaria never saw each other: on Christmas Day of 1190, according to the marriage contract, Berengaria was supposed to arrive in Germany, but this did not happen. Pope Celestine III did not want the Staufen dynasty to extend its influence over the Iberian Kingdoms, and when in the autumn of 1191 Berengaria (influenced, no doubt, by third parties such as her grandmother Eleanor of Aquitaine, who was not interested in having a Staufen as a neighbor to her French fiefdoms), requested an annulment of the engagement, the Pope quickly agreed: the betrothal was broken in early 1192 by the Archbishop Gonzalo of Toledo and the Papal Legate Gregor, Cardinal-Deacon of San Angelo, on the grounds that the bride was against the continuation of the engagement.

Conrad joined the army under the leadership of his oldest brother Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor in traveling to Rome for Henry VI&#x27;s imperial coronation on 15 April 1191. After the coronation, the army set out to the invasion of the Kingdom of Sicily. Due to the malaria epidemic that broke out in August 1191, the campaign was stopped in Naples. Documents issued in Italy indicate that Conrad took part in this campaign.

Conrad&#x27;s older brother Frederick VI, Duke of Swabia died in January 1191 at Acre during the Third Crusade. According to the chronicle of Otto of Sankt Blasien in 1191, Henry VI left the Duchy of Swabia to his brother Conrad after returning from Italy. The chronicler also described Conrad as &quot;&quot;a man thoroughly given to adultery, fornication, defilement, and every foulness; nevertheless, he was vigorous and brave in battle and generous to his friends&quot;.&quot;

In a royal charter dated 24 May 1192, when he is said to have received his sword &quot;tail&quot; at a court in Worms, he appears for the first time as &quot;dux Suevie&quot; (Duke of Swabia) and from then on his previous title of Duke of Rothenburg was not used.

During the &quot;Italienzug&quot; of Henry VI in 1194–95 Conrad seems to have stayed away and acted as the King&#x27;s deputy in Swabia and Franconia. This emerges from documents from Salem and Steingaden Abbeys, which were issued by Conrad during this period.

Conrad died aged 24, a very young age even by medieval standards. The Marbach Annals date Conrad&#x27;s death to 15 August 1196. His early death prevented him from succeeding his brother Henry VI, who died in Messina just one year later in September 1197. Instead, his youngest surviving brother Philip succeeded him as Duke of Swabia and in 1198 became the next king from the Staufen dynasty.

According to the chronicle of Burchard of Ursperg, Conrad died in Durlach during a campaign against Berthold V, Duke of Zähringen and was buried at Lorch Abbey. This chronicle is uncertain whether he was killed by a woman whom he had raped or by her husband. But the Annals of Konrad von Scheyern recorded specifically that he was bitten in the left nipple by a girl he was attempting to rape; although an increasingly large wound developed, he did not want to be treated and died three days later. Other reports stating that he died in Oppenheim and was buried in Speyer are considered inaccurate.

Conrad&#x27;s burial place, Lorch Abbey, was the necropolis of the Staufen dynasty, donated by his great-grandfather, Frederick I, Duke of Swabia. In 1475 Abbot Nikolaus Schenk von Arberg had the remains of all the Staufen buried in Lorch transferred to a late Gothic &quot;tumba&quot;, which is now in the central nave of the Lorch Abbey church.

<text>Arena (formerly Fox Arena) is an Australian general entertainment cable and satellite channel available on Foxtel, Austar, and Optus Television&#x27;s subscription platforms.

==History==

In the late 1990s, Arena had the slogan &quot;The Art of Television&quot;. It ran a mix of programs, including UK serial &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, and cult horror and science fictions films presented by Tabitha Clutterbuck. This included programs from E! prior to the launch of E! in Australia.

On 1 March 2001, it relaunched, with an added focus on talk shows and celebrity.

On 31 July 2005, its look was again updated, with a new logo and the new slogan, &quot;Great TV Any time&quot;.

It was owned and operated by XYZnetworks until 1 October 2007, when management and programming were taken over by Foxtel, with XYZ Networks still retaining ownership.

In April 2008, Foxtel announced a partnership with Universal Networks International, where Arena would be re-branded as an Australian version of the American channel Bravofeaturing original series from the network, and adopting a variation of Bravo&#x27;s branding and slogan, whilst retaining the previous Arena name.

On 1 June 2010, Arena TV switched from standard 4:3 to 16:9 widescreen programming. Many of Arena&#x27;s programmes like &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;, &quot;Two and a Half Men&quot;, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; and &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; amongst other shows are originally presented in widescreen. Arena TV&#x27;s switch to widescreen is part of Foxtel&#x27;s plan to have every channel in widescreen by the end of 2010.

On 3 November 2014, Arena launched a HD feed. In addition, Arena + 2 moved from channel 154 to channel 151.

On 1 July 2020, the channel rebranded as FOX Arena with a new logo and tagline ‘Live Out Loud.’ The channel now operates as part of Foxtel&#x27;s LifeStyle suite of television networks.

On 28 September 2023, the channel rebranded to its former name, &quot;Arena&quot;, with a new logo.

<doc id="669276" wikidata="Q5978227" url="?curid=669276" title="2004 Malawian general election">
<text>General elections were held in Malawi on 20 May 2004 to elect a President and the National Assembly. The election had originally been scheduled for 18 May but was postponed for two days in response to opposition complaints of irregularities in the voter roll. By 22 May no results had been announced, leading to protests from the opposition and threats of disorder. On 25 May the Malawi Electoral Commission finally announced the results of the election. Bingu wa Mutharika, the candidate of the ruling United Democratic Front, was declared the winner of the presidential poll, whilst the Malawi Congress Party had won most seats in the National Assembly vote. Voter turnout was around 62%.

==Campaign==
===President===
There were five candidates for the presidential election:
*Gwanda Chakuamba, aged 69, was the candidate of a seven-party opposition coalition, the Mgwirizano Coalition or Unity Coalition. Chakuamba has a colourful past, having been a senior minister and militia commander under former President-for-life Hastings Banda. In 1980 he fell out with Banda, whose assassination he was accused of plotting. He spent 12 years in prison and emerged a popular hero, then succeeded Banda as leader of his party, the Malawi Congress Party. 
*Justin Malewezi, Vice-President of Malawi under Bakili Muluzi, stood as the candidate of the People&#x27;s Progressive Movement, having been passed over by the ruling party.
*Brown Mpinganjira, aged 55, was the candidate of the National Democratic Alliance, a breakaway group from the ruling party.
*John Tembo, aged 72, was the candidate of the Malawi Congress Party.
*Bingu wa Mutharika, a 70-year-old economist and veteran politician who was the candidate of the ruling United Democratic Front, although he had previously run for president under the United Party banner. He was supported by the outgoing president, Bakili Muluzi.

===National Assembly===
A total of 1,268 candidates ran in the election of which 373 were independents and the rest representing fifteen parties.

Seven parties contested the elections as the Mgwirizano Coalition; the Republican Party, the People&#x27;s Progressive Movement, the Movement for Genuine Democratic Change, the People&#x27;s Transformation Party, the Malawi Forum for Unity and Development, the National Unity Party and the Malawi Democratic Party.

==Results==
===President===
===National Assembly===
Polling in six constituencies was delayed due to printing errors on the ballot papers.

<doc id="669281" wikidata="Q1890008" url="?curid=669281" title="Wetlook">
<text>Wetlook is a paraphilic behaviour where sexual enjoyment is derived from wearing or seeing people wearing wet clothes. 

== Common terminology ==

=== Phat dipping ===

The expression &quot;phat dipping&quot; refers to the act of jumping or diving clothed. The term originates from the 2009 rap song &quot;Phatdippin&#x27; Rap&quot; by duo Rhett &amp; Link, showing people jumping fully clothed into a pool. The lyrics encourage people to jump into the water with their clothes on rather than a swimsuit. The neologism became popular, especially in the United States due to the contest organized upon the release of the song inviting viewers to upload their own version. 

=== Wetfun ===
&quot;Wetfun&quot; refers to the enjoyment derived from the feeling of swimming clothed. This fetishistic attitude is distinct from any non-sexual enjoyment people may feel from swimming while dressed. 

=== Wetlook ===

The term &quot;wetlook&quot; refers to the sight of wet clothes clinging to the skin.

=== Wetters ===
Online, the community refers to themselves as &quot;wetters&quot;. Subcommunities of wetters include:

==== Get-wets ====
Wetters for whom the manner and conditions of getting wet are important, plunging them into deep emotional states.

==== Jumpers ====
Wetters who enjoys getting wet quickly or in an unintended or undeserved manner, such as being pushed into water.

==== Stay-wets ====
Wetters who keep their clothes on once out of the water.

==== Walkers ====
Wetters who enjoy getting wet slowly.

==As sexual stimuli==
Alex Comfort writing in &quot;The Joy of Sex&quot; suggests that wetlook clothing functions as a kind of &quot;superskin&quot;, enhancing the visual and tactile qualities of shininess and tightness, stating that if your lover &quot;likes you to look like a cross between a snake and a seal, wear what he gives you&quot;.

According to Desmond Morris, water on the skin is seen as mimicking the sweat of sexual arousal.

The erotic aspect of the shininess can be compared to latex fetishism.

== In culture ==
In Western culture, swimming fully clothed is sometimes prohibited in public places or considered socially unacceptable.

In Denmark and Germany, wetlook has become a minor cultural movement. Meeting groups and associations organize events. The annual end-of-summer beach party in Borgentreich is a major event for wetters, and some people travel hundreds of kilometres to participate. Similar events take place regularly.New Kingdom of Egyptian poetry has a girl telling her lover: &quot;It is pleasant to go to the pool...That I may let you see my beauty in my tunic of finest royal linen when it is wet&quot;.

<doc id="669303" wikidata="Q1580985" url="?curid=669303" title="Coastal Party">
<text>The Coastal Party () is a regionalist, agrarian political party in Norway. The party has district, fishing and coastal issues among its primary policies with its main political base in Northern Norway, and is a staunch opponent of Norwegian membership in the European Union. It was represented in the Norwegian Parliament from 2001 to 2005, and its predecessor, the Non-Partisan Deputies, from 1997 to 2001. Originally led by the fisherman and whale hunter Steinar Bastesen, its current leader is Bengt Stabrun Johansen (since 2012).

==History==
The Coastal Party was formally founded on 1 February 1999 although the party participated, and won one seat, in the 1997 parliamentary election as the Non-Partisan Deputies. Since 1997 however, the name &quot;Coastal Party&quot; was commonly used to describe the parliamentary party, at least in its base in Northern Norway. In the county of Nordland, the list which ran in 1997 even went as &quot;program for the Non-Partisan Deputies-Coastal Party&quot;. In February 2001, Conservative Party Member of Parliament Inger Stolt-Nielsen from Rogaland left the Conservatives and finished her term for the Coastal Party, giving the party two Members in Parliament until the 2001 election. The party&#x27;s leader Steinar Bastesen, a fisherman and whale hunter, was elected to the parliament for a second period in 2001.

In 2005, the party announced that they would for the first time participate in the parliamentary election in all of Norway&#x27;s 19 counties, even though two of them do not have a coastline. This is important for all political parties, however, as it is the only way to secure a place in the national pre-election television debates. On 13 March 2005, the party convention elected Roy Waage, a former member of the Christian Democratic Party, as the new party leader. In 2008, former party leader Steinar Bastesen was expelled from the party, and internal conflicts and poor leadership of the party has been cited to have contributed to the party&#x27;s steady decline in subsequent elections.

==Political platform==
The Coastal Party describe itself as a &quot;culturally conservative centrist party&quot;, and its central value as being &quot;safety&quot;. Other core issues are Christian values, environmentalism, and a mixed economy. The party is also against European Union and EEA membership, seeks a restrictive immigration policy, and preservation of the family, local community and nation.

==Election results==

The Coastal Party is to a very large degree regionally based. So far, it has not been able to pass the national 4% election threshold for leveling seats, but won a district seat in Nordland county in both 1997 (as the Non-Partisan Deputies) and 2001. In the 2005 parliamentary election, 59% of the party&#x27;s votes came from the three northernmost counties: Finnmark, Troms and Nordland. Their best result came in Troms county, where they won 8.6% of the vote. In Karlsøy Municipality and Skjervøy Municipality, they received the highest vote count of all parties. In the country as a whole, however, they only won 0.8% of the vote (down from 1.7% in 2001) and lost its only seat in the Storting. The party&#x27;s support has dropped further in parliamentary elections in 2009 and 2013 to 0.1%.

<text>WCPE (89.7 FM) in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a listener supported non-commercial, non-profit radio station, and the program contributor for The Classical Station, a classical music network. The station went on the air July 17, 1978, and switched to a 24-hour classical music format in 1984. Both are owned by the Educational Information Corporation, a nonprofit community organization.

WCPE&#x27;s studios are located just outside Wake Forest, North Carolina. Its main signal extends from the South Carolina state line to the suburbs of Richmond, Virginia, and some parts of Charlotte, North Carolina, as well.

==Overview==
WCPE operates three full-power satellite stations in the Outer Banks of eastern North Carolina, as well as a network of low-powered translators across the state. It can also be heard on cable television systems, on free-to-air (open format) &quot;small dish&quot; home satellite systems via the AMC-1 satellites, and around the world via six streaming audio formats on the Internet, including mp3, AAC, Ogg Vorbis, QuickTime, RealAudio, iTunes, and WMA. The station also streams via IPv6. The station&#x27;s call letters were randomly assigned.

In September 2023, WCPE sent a survey to listeners describing concerns over modern works in the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s upcoming season, writing that they were &quot;written in a nonclassical music style, have adult themes and language, and are in English&quot;. The survey suggested that WCPE would not air the productions. Three of the works selected for exclusion were by Black or Mexican composers. After much national criticism and accusations of censorship, the station announced that it would broadcast the operas.

==Helms-Leahy Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002==
In November 2002, WCPE and its founder and General Manager, Deborah Proctor was recognized by Senator Jesse Helms for her contribution in the Helms-Leahy Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002. This act helped settle a dispute regarding the amount of royalties webcasters must pay in order to perform sound recordings over the Internet bringing stability to the then-emerging webcasting industry.

==The North Carolina Award==
On Saturday, November 6, 2019, founder and General Manager, Deborah Proctor was recognized by Governor Roy Cooper with North Carolina&#x27;s highest civilian honor, the North Carolina Award. Proctor was recognized for her efforts to promote and help small, independent and public broadcasters remain viable in the era of online broadcasting.

==Simulcasts and translators==
WZPE is owned by the Educational Information Corporation, while WURI is owned by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and leased to WCPE.

In 2016, WCPE&#x27;s programming in Buxton moved from high-power WBUX (90.5 FM) to W216BE (now W219DW). Both facilities are owned by WUNC, which WBUX now retransmits.

<doc id="669326" wikidata="Q3376669" url="?curid=669326" title="Wang Wei (Gējì)">
<text>Wáng Wēi (; 1597–1647), also known by her courtesy name Xiūwēi (), was a Chinese Gējì, poet, and traveller during the late Ming dynasty.

==Biography==
Nothing is known of her family background, other than that she was from Yangzhou. At the age of seven, Wang&#x27;s father died, leaving her orphaned without any family support. The change in circumstances let to her entering a song and dance venue, where she was trained as Geji. The training included literacy and artistic skills. During this time, she developed a friendship with another Geji, , the two calling themselves &quot;sworn sisters&quot; due to their similar backgrounds. When Wang Wei married the military official and scholar , Yang Wan became his concubine.

Wang referred to herself as the &quot;Straw-coated Daoist&quot;. As a Geji she travelled by skiff between Suzhou and Kuaiji (now Shaoxing). The boat carried many books and she was often accompanied by well known literary figures of the day, including Zhong Xing and Tan Yuanchun, founders of the Jingling school of poetry. She also travelled to West Lake in Wulin (now Hangzhou), a hotspot for literati at the time, and as far as Hunan. Wang Wei was renowned for her outstanding poetry, leading to her being called the &quot;Female Editor&quot; (女校書).

Wishing to change her life, she turned to Buddhism and started to travel, dressed in a simple cotton robe. During her travels she climbed to the peaks of Mount Dabie, Mount Xuan, Mount Tianzhu, Mount Kuang and Mount Lu. After travelling she settled in Wulin. She intended to spend the rest of her life there and prepared a tomb for her eventual death. As the Ming dynasty began to crumble, leading to widespread violence and a breakdown of social norms, she turned away from Buddhism.

Wang married a Censorate official, . Xu was a man of integrity, and was later dismissed from his post after disagreements with the Chongzhen Emperor. The couple were uprooted after Ming fell in 1644, and moved around the south. Although the couple vowed to live and die together, when Wang died of an illness in 1647, Xu lived on to mourn her.

==Writing==
Wang was a writer and anthologist of travelogues. She is known to have written several hundred, perhaps partly as a commercial venture catering to the late Ming travel boom. One of these, &quot;Ming shan ji&quot; (Records of the Famous Mountains), ran to several hundred chapters. Other works of Wang&#x27;s include &quot;Yueyuan Poetry Collection&quot; (樾媛诗集), &quot;Yuanyoucao&quot; (远游草), &quot;Qishancao&quot; (期山草), &quot;Famous Mountain Records&quot; (名山记), &quot;Yuanyou Manuscript&quot; (远游稿), &quot;Fushantingcao&quot; (浮山亭草), &quot;Yueguan Poetry Collection&quot; (樾馆诗集)&quot;, and &quot;Selected Unburned Manuscripts&quot; (未焚稿选). While much of Wang&#x27;s poetry dealt with the landscape, Tina Lu has argued that nature was only the secondary topic of her work, with the primary focus being a &quot;landscape of nostalgia&quot; that Wang used to express her identity as a traveller.

Her poetry appears in the &quot;Zhong Xiang Ci&quot;, an anthology of late Ming-early Qing female poets.

Wang&#x27;s shi poems were described by Qing dynasty commentators as comparable to those of Li Qingzhao and Zhu Shuzhen in their beauty and serenity.

<text>The Scottish Open is a ranking professional snooker tournament held in the United Kingdom. The tournament had many name changes in its history, as the tournament was formerly called International Open, Matchroom Trophy and Players Championship. Apart from a hiatus in the 1990/1991 and 1991/1992 seasons, the tournament remained a ranking event until 2003/2004. In the 2012/2013 season the tournament was added back to the calendar as part of the Players Tour Championship minor-ranking series.

On 29 April 2015, Barry Hearn announced it would return to the main tour in 2016 at the Emirates Arena Glasgow, as part of the new Home Nations Series with the existing Welsh Open, and the new English Open and Northern Ireland Open tournaments. The winner of the Scottish Open is awarded the Stephen Hendry Trophy, which is named in honour of the Scottish seven-time world champion. The reigning champion is Lei Peifan.

== History ==
The tournament began in 1981 as the International Open at the Assembly Rooms in Derby, and became the following year the second ranking event after the World Championship. The event moved to the Eldon Square in Newcastle upon Tyne. Until 1984 the event was sponsored by Jameson Whiskey.

In 1985 the event moved to the Trentham Gardens in Stoke-on-Trent and was renamed (for this year only) to the Matchroom Trophy due to sponsorship from Matchroom and Goya. The International Open name returned the following year and the sponsorship was overtaken by BCE (1986 and 1989) and Fidelity Unit Trusts (1987 and 1988). After 1989 the event went on a two-year hiatus.

The event returned in the 1992/1993 season with the sponsorship of Sky Sports. The event was moved to the second half of the season and was played at the Plymouth Pavilions. The event was moved again in 1994, this time to the Bournemouth International Centre. After an unsponsored year Sweater Shop took over for 1995 and 1996. In 1997 the event was moved to the Aberdeen Exhibition Centre and it was sponsored by Highland Spring.

In 1998 the event was renamed to Scottish Open, and it was sponsored by Imperial Tobacco through their Regal brand, who also sponsored the Scottish Masters and Welsh Open. In 2003 the event was moved to Royal Highland Centre in Edinburgh. For the first time in twelve years no top 16 player reached the final. The event than was renamed to the Players Championship for 2004, as it became the final event in the LG Electronics Tour. The event was sponsored by Daily Record and held at the SECC in Glasgow. After the event Sky decided not to renew their contract, and without television coverage the event was dropped. The event was added back to the calendar in the 2012/2013 season as minor-ranking tournament and was known as the Scottish Open. It was held at Ravenscraig as the fifth event of the European Tour.

In 2015 Barry Hearn announced that the tournament would return in the 2016/17 season, held in Glasgow, as part of the Home Nations Series events, which would feature tournaments in the other home nations of snooker and have a one million pound bonus.

Steve Davis was the tournament&#x27;s most prolific winner, with a record 6 wins from 8 finals. This included a 9–0 whitewash of Dennis Taylor in the 1981 final. There have been eight maximum breaks in the history of the tournament, out of which two were made at the 2000 event: one by Stephen Maguire at the first qualifying round against Phaitoon Phonbun, and the other by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the last 32 against Quinten Hann. In 2012 Kurt Maflin achieved a 147 in the last 32 against Stuart Carrington. In 2017, eventual runner-up Cao Yupeng made a maximum break in his first round match against Andrew Higginson, and the following year, John Higgins compiled his ninth career 147 in his second round match against Gerard Greene. In 2020, Zhou Yuelong made a maximum break in his first round match with Peter Lines, and in 2021 Xiao Guodong made the first maximum break of his career in his qualifying match against Fraser Patrick. The most recent maximum break was made in 2022 by Judd Trump in his second-round match against Mitchell Mann.

<text>Gao Qi (, 1336–1374), courtesy name Jidi (), pseudonym Qingqiuzi (), was a Chinese poet who lived in the early Ming dynasty. He is generally acknowledged as one of the greatest creators of Ming poetry. Gao Qi was born and raised in the shore of Wusong River, north of Puli Town near Suzhou. His life was much influenced by events arising in connection with the fall of the Yuan dynasty and the rise and establishment of the succeeding Ming dynasty.

During the reign of the Hongwu Emperor, Gao Qi was called on as editor of the historical text &quot;History of Yuan&quot;. Soon afterward, he was promoted to the post of deputy finance minister; but he declined, on pretext that he had no ability to manage finance. He retired to Blue Hill of Puli Town and taught students for a living. The Hongwu Emperor deemed him not cooperative; in 1374 he was accused of involvement in a &quot;rebellion conspiracy&quot; and was executed by being sliced into eight parts, at the age of 39 years old.

:Mingled with sound of flowing water,
:Sight of wooden bridge,
:Flowerless trees in hazy spring,

:Ah, next neighbor is brewing afternoon tea!

<text>This is a list of mayors of [[Saskatoon]], the largest city in the central Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The mayor leads Saskatoon City Council, the city&#x27;s governing body. The 29th and current mayor is Cynthia Block, who was first elected in 2024.

== Background ==
Saskatoon received a town charter in July 1903, which led to the inception of a town council. In May 1906 the Town of Saskatoon merged with the settlements of Riversdale and Nutana, and the City of Saskatoon was incorporated. Until 1954, Saskatoon&#x27;s mayor was elected annually. From 1954 until 1970, the mayor was elected biannually. The term was then extended to three years, and in 2012 it was extended to four.

From 1920 to 1926 and from 1938 to 1942, Saskatoon mayors were elected using instant-runoff voting. All other times the first past the post system was used.

Until 1976, mayor and council were sworn in during the first meeting of the new year, meaning that terms could be measured in calendar years. From 1976, mayor and council have been sworn in during the first meeting following the election.

<text>Cui Hao (, 704?–754) was a Chinese poet of the Tang dynasty in China and considered a main early exponent of the regulated verse form of Classical Chinese poetry (also known as &quot;jintishi&quot;).

==Biography==
Cui Hao was born in Biànzhōu (汴州, present day Kaifeng, Henan) and passed the imperial examinations in 723. He is known to have traveled extensively as an official, particularly between the years 723–744. He was known for three poetry topic - women, frontier outposts, and natural scenery. His life was initially conventional; along with Wang Wei, he was one of the perfectors of the &quot;jintishi&quot; form. Later, however, he acquired a reputation for disreputable personal behaviour and passed through several marriages. His later verse is similarly unconstrained.

==Poems==
Fifteen poems exist on the topic of women and fifteen poems exist on the latter two topics. A famous poem of his is the Yellow Crane Tower; which is one of the four of his poems included in the Three Hundred Tang Poems anthology, written in seven-character-per-line regulated verse, and which was later translated into English by Witter Bynner as &quot;The Yellow Crane Terrace&quot;. Also included in the &quot;Three Hundred Tang Poems&quot; is a seven-character-per-line regular verse form poem written in the &quot;huaigu&quot; genre style on his passage through Huayin, north of Hua Shan, as well as two old or folk style pieces with erotic overtones.

<doc id="669358" wikidata="Q1792977" url="?curid=669358" title="The War Games">
<text>The War Games is the seventh and final serial of the sixth season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which originally aired in ten weekly parts from 19 April to 21 June 1969.

In the serial, an unnamed alien race led by the War Lord kidnap and brainwash soldiers from wars throughout Earth&#x27;s history to fight in war games on another planet as part of the aliens&#x27; plot to conquer the galaxy. The time travelling Second Doctor and his travelling companions Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Heriot form a resistance army to stop this plot and return the kidnapped soldiers to their correct times on Earth.

&quot;The War Games&quot; was the last regular appearance of Patrick Troughton as the Doctor and the last serial to be recorded in black and white. It also marks the last regular appearances of Wendy Padbury and Frazer Hines as companions Zoe and Jamie, and the first appearances of the Doctor&#x27;s race, the Time Lords, and their home planet, Gallifrey. The latter was not named until &quot;The Time Warrior&quot; (1973).

==Plot==
On an alien planet, the Doctor uncovers a plot to conquer the Galaxy with brainwashed soldiers abducted from Earth and forced to fight in simulated &quot;war games&quot;, representing the periods in history whence they were taken. The aliens&#x27; aim is to produce a super-army from the survivors; to this end, they have been aided by a renegade Time Lord, calling himself the War Chief.

Joining forces with rebel soldiers who have broken their conditioning, the Doctor and his companions foil the plot and end the fighting. The War Chief is apparently killed when the leader of the aliens, the War Lord, realises he has been plotting against him. The Doctor admits he needs the help of the Time Lords to return the soldiers to their own timelines, but in asking, risks capture for his own past crimes, including the theft of his TARDIS. After sending the message, he and his companions attempt to evade capture, but are caught.

Having returned the soldiers to Earth, the Time Lords place the War Lord on trial and dematerialise him. They erase Zoe and Jamie&#x27;s memories of travelling with the Doctor, and return them to the respective point in time when each of them first entered the TARDIS. They then place the Doctor on trial for stealing a TARDIS and breaking the law of non-interference. The Doctor presents a spirited defence, citing his many battles against the evils of the universe. Accepting this defence, the Time Lords proclaim that his punishment is exile to Earth in the 20th century - a planet and period of which he is fond. The Doctor points out he is too well known on Earth, so the Time Lords tell him he must change his appearance, as he has before, and present him with images of four faces. He does not like any of them; impatient, the Time Lords inform him that a decision has been made for him. He cries out indignantly as the forced regeneration is triggered.

==Production==
As the TARDIS crew try to escape the Time Lords in Episode Ten, brief clips from &quot;The Web of Fear&quot; and &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot; are used to show the TARDIS in locations supposedly out of the Time Lords&#x27; reach. A model shot from Episode 1 of &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; is used after Zoe is sent back to her own time and place by the Time Lords. Since this episode is missing, the shot sampled in &quot;The War Games&quot; is the only known surviving footage from this episode. Similarly, the shot of the TARDIS landing vertically on the sea is sampled from &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot; Episode 1, which is the only surviving footage from this episode.

==Broadcast and reception==
The BBC&#x27;s Audience Research Report showed that &quot;The War Games&quot; was received positively, though not enthusiastically, by viewers.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote of the serial in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995), &quot;It might be six episodes too long, but &quot;The War Games&quot; is pivotal in the history of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The introduction of the Time Lords ... sees the series lose some of its mystery, but gain a new focus.&quot; In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker stated that the serial &quot;gets off to a cracking start&quot;, though they noted that &quot;A commonly expressed view is that, after this strong beginning, the story becomes dull and repetitive, picking up again only in the closing stages when the Time Lords are introduced.&quot; They praised the design work of the different war zones, the dialogue, and the conclusion. In 2009, &quot;Radio Times&quot; reviewer Patrick Mulkern was positive towards the detailed scripts and the various villains, especially the War Chief. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; reviewer praised the way the serial subverted viewers&#x27; expectations of a typical historical story. He noted that there was padding to fill the running time, but felt that it was done well and that it worked better than in &quot;The Dalek Invasion of Earth&quot;. He also wrote positively of Madoc&#x27;s War Lord and Jamie and Zoe&#x27;s departure, and said that the story purposefully &quot;doesn&#x27;t resolve neatly or satisfyingly&quot;. Alasdair Wilkins of io9 praised Troughton&#x27;s performance and the way that it was structured to &quot;constantly [expand] the story&#x27;s scope&quot;, though he admitted there was still padding. In a 2010 article, Charlie Jane Anders of the same site listed the cliffhanger to the ninth episode — in which the Doctor and his companions escape the base and try to get back to the TARDIS but their movements are slowed down as the Doctor tries to unlock and open the TARDIS doors — as one of the greatest &quot;Doctor Who&quot; cliffhangers ever.

A viewing of &quot;The War Games&quot;, and in particular the character of Jamie McCrimmon, inspired author Diana Gabaldon to set her &quot;Outlander&quot; series in Jacobite Scotland, and to name its protagonist &quot;Jamie&quot;.

<text>György (George) Konrád (2 April 1933 – 13 September 2019) was a Hungarian novelist, pundit, essayist and sociologist known as an advocate of individual freedom.

== Life ==
George Konrad was born in Berettyóújfalu, near Debrecen, into a wealthy Jewish family. His father, József Konrád, ran a hardware business; his mother was Róza Klein, a member of a Nagyvárad Jewish middle-class family. His older sister Éva was born in 1930.

Konrad&#x27;s parents were arrested and deported to Austria after the German invasion of Hungary, and the two children and two cousins travelled to relatives in Budapest, a day before all Jewish inhabitants of Berettyóújfalu were sent to the ghetto in Nagyvárad, and on to Auschwitz. Most of Konrád&#x27;s classmates died in Birkenau. 

In February 1945, George and his sister went back to Berettyóújfalu, and in June their parents were released from Strasshof concentration camp The Konrád family were the only family among the Jewish inhabitants of Berettyóújfalu to survive intact. Konrad started school in 1946 at the Main Reformed Gimnázium in Debrecen, moving on the following year to 1951, he attended the Madách Gimnázium in Budapest. He left in 1951 to study literature, sociology and psychology at the Lenin Institute of Eötvös Loránd University. In 1950, his father&#x27;s business and their house at Berettyóújfalu were appropriated by the government. 

Konrad completed his university education in the Department of Hungarian literature and language at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest. In 1956 he was involved in the Hungarian Uprising, and served in the National Guard, made up mostly of university students. Most of his family left for the west, but Konrád decided to remain in Hungary. The story of Konrád&#x27;s survival as a child is told in his autobiographical novel &quot;Departure and Return&quot;.

He made his living through ad hoc jobs: he was a tutor, wrote reader reports, translated, and worked as a factory hand. Beginning in the summer of 1959, he secured steady employment as a children&#x27;s welfare supervisor in Budapest&#x27;s seventh District. He remained there for seven years, during which time he amassed the experiences that would serve as the basis for his novel &quot;The Case Worker&quot; (1969). The book drew a vigorous and mixed response: the official criticism was negative, but the book quickly became very popular and sold out in days.

Between 1960 and 1965 Konrad was employed as a reader at the Magyar Helikon publishing house, where he was chief editor of works by Gogol, Turgenev, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Babel, and Balzac. In 1965, he joined the Urban Science and Planning Institute, there undertaking research in urban sociology with the sociological research group of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He was working closely with urban sociologist Iván Szelényi with whom he wrote a book, &quot;On the Sociological Problems of the New Housing Developments&quot; (1969), and two extensive works on the management of the country&#x27;s regional zones, as well as on urbanistic and ecological trends in Hungary.

His experiences as an urbanist provided material for his next novel, &quot;The City Builder&quot;, in which he radically extended the experiments in language and form that marked &quot;The Case Worker&quot;. &quot;The City Builder&quot; was allowed to appear in Hungarian only in censored form from Magvető Publishers in 1977. It was published abroad by Suhrkamp, Seuil, Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch, and Philip Roth&#x27;s Penguin Series, with a foreword by Carlos Fuentes. Konrád lost his job by order of the political police in July 1973. For half a year he worked as a nurse&#x27;s aide at the work-therapy-based mental institution at Doba.

Together with Iván Szelényi, Konrád published &quot;The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power&quot; in 1974. Shortly after the completion of &quot;The Intellectuals&quot; (intended for foreign publication), the political police bugged and searched Szelényi&#x27;s and Konrád&#x27;s apartments. A significant part of Konrád&#x27;s diaries were confiscated and the authors were arrested for incitement against the state. They were placed on probation and informed that they would be permitted to emigrate with their families. Szelényi accepted the offer, while Konrád remained in Hungary, choosing internal emigration and all that it entailed. A smuggled manuscript of &quot;The Intellectuals on the Road to Class Power&quot; was published abroad and it remains on university reading lists.

He was published in Hungarian samizdat and by publishers in the West. Virtually from this period until 1989, Konrád was a forbidden author in Hungary, deprived of all legal income. He made a living from honoraria abroad. His works were placed in restricted sections in libraries. Naturally he was also forbidden to speak on radio or television. When the restriction of travel expired in 1976, Konrád spent a year in Berlin on a DAAD fellowship, and another year in the U.S., on a stipend from his American publisher. During this period, he wrote his novel &quot;The Loser&quot;.

Between 1977 and 1982, two volumes of Konrád&#x27;s essays appeared: &quot;The Temptation of Autonomy&quot; (not translated into English) and &quot;Antipolitics&quot;. These works called into question the European political status quo. &quot;Antipolitics&quot; portrayed the Yalta Agreement and the spheres of influence system as the potential cause of a possible Third World War. The book&#x27;s subtitle was Central-European Meditations, and it was to become one of the voices demanding that region&#x27;s secession from the Soviet bloc as a requisite for peace in Europe. Konrád was one of the first to predict the imminent disappearance of the Iron Curtain. In 1984, he read his essay &quot;Does the Dream of Central Europe Still Exist?&quot; in the Schwarzenberg Palace as he received the Herder Prize from the University of Vienna. Critics have compared his essays to the writings of Adam Michnik, Milan Kundera, Václav Havel, Czeslaw Milos and Danilo Kiš.

The years between 1973 and 1989 witnessed the evolution of a dissident political and artistic subculture, independent of official culture. Konrád was one of the determining voices in the democratic opposition. His works appeared in the underground so-called samizdat journals of the opposition. In interviews given to Radio Free Europe, Konrad&#x27;s ideas reached a wider Hungarian audience. Beginning in September 1982, he was a year-long guest at the Wissenschaft-skolleg zu Berlin; the following year he received a fellowship at the New York Institute for the Humanities. Over the four years that followed, Konrád wrote &quot;A Feast in the Garden&quot; (Hungarian version 1985). Now released from the official prohibition against publication, he sent the manuscript to the Magvető publishing house in Hungary.

In 1986 Konrad received an invitation from the Jerusalem Literary Fund, spending a month in that city. This was the period when Konrád primarily penned those essays and diary entries that would be collected for the volume &quot;The Invisible Voice&quot; (Hungarian version 1997). Konrád returned to Israel in 1992 and 1996. During his first visit he gave a long biographical interview for the University of Jerusalem, while on the second, he gave a lecture entitled &quot;Judaism’s Three Paths&quot; at the Ben Gurion University in Beer Sheva. In 1988 he taught world literature at Colorado College in Colorado Springs.

In the first years after the fall of the old regime, beginning in 1989, Konrád took an active part in public life in Hungary, and was one of the thinkers who paved the way for the transition to democracy. He was a founding member of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), and one of the founders and spokespeople for the Democratic Charter. He made frequent appearances in both the print and electronic media. In the spring of 1990 Konrád was elected President of PEN International, holding this office for the full term until 1993. He made strenuous efforts on behalf of imprisoned and persecuted writers and called the writers of disintegrating nations together to roundtable conferences in the interest of peace.

Between 1997 and 2003, Konrád was twice elected President of the Academy of Arts, Berlin. As the first foreigner to hold that post, Konrád was an effective contributor to the intellectual rapprochement between the East and West of Europe, and did much to introduce writers and other creative figures from Central Europe, and particularly from Hungary, to the West. His efforts were greeted by an appreciative German public. During his presidency, he received the Internationale Karlspreis zu Aachen (2001) and the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2003).
Though Konrád frequently portrayed his Berettyóúfalu childhood in his novels, and particularly in &quot;The Feast in the Garden&quot;, he attempted to present this period in a more precise documentary form in two books, &quot;Departure and Return&quot; (2001) and &quot;Up on the Hill During a Solar Eclipse&quot; (2003). The first of these books treats a single year – 1944–45 – while the second covers fifty, after beginning with a reflection on the final years of the twentieth century, more precisely the morning solar eclipse of 1999, experienced from the peak of St. György Hill. These books were published separately in Europe, and together in New York as &quot;A Guest in My Own Country&quot; (2007).
The year 2006 saw the publication of his volume &quot;Figures of Wonder&quot;, subtitled &quot;Portraits and Snapshots&quot;. These portraits are modeled primarily on friends, some still living – descriptions that constitute a continuation of the series presented by Konrád in his book &quot;The Writer and the City&quot; (2004) together with longer essays. His books &quot;The Rooster’s Sorrow&quot; (2005), &quot;Pendulum&quot; (2008), &quot;The Chimes&quot; (2009), and &quot;The Visitor’s Book&quot; (2013) present his philosophy of life with a near-poetic density.

Konrád was married three times. In 1955 he married Vera Varsa, with whom he lived until 1963, then married Júlia Lángh, with whom he had two children, Anna Dóra in 1965, and Miklós István in 1967. From 1979, Konrád lived with Judith Lakner, his third wife, and together they had three children, Áron (1986), József (1987), and Zsuzsanna (1994).

<doc id="669367" wikidata="Q2268573" url="?curid=669367" title="Smartdust">
<text>Smartdust is a system of many tiny microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) such as sensors, robots, or other devices, that can detect, for example, light, temperature, vibration, magnetism, or chemicals. They are usually operated on a computer network wirelessly and are distributed over some area to perform tasks, usually sensing through radio-frequency identification. Without an antenna of much greater size the range of tiny smart dust communication devices is measured in a few millimeters and they may be vulnerable to electromagnetic disablement and destruction by microwave exposure.

==Design and engineering==
The concepts for Smart Dust emerged from a workshop at RAND in 1992 and a series of DARPA ISAT studies in the mid-1990s due to the potential military applications of the technology. The work was strongly influenced by work at UCLA and the University of Michigan during that period, as well as science fiction authors Stanislaw Lem (in novels &quot;The Invincible&quot; in 1964 and &quot;Peace on Earth&quot; in 1985), Neal Stephenson and Vernor Vinge. The first public presentation of the concept by that name was at the American Vacuum Society meeting in Anaheim in 1996.

A Smart Dust research proposal was presented to DARPA written by Kristofer S. J. Pister, Joe Kahn, and Bernhard Boser, all from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1997. The proposal, to build wireless sensor nodes with a volume of one cubic millimeter, was selected for funding in 1998. The project led to a working mote smaller than a grain of rice, and larger &quot;COTS Dust&quot; devices kicked off the TinyOS effort at Berkeley.

The concept was later expanded upon by Kris Pister in 2001. A recent review discusses various techniques to take smartdust in sensor networks beyond millimeter dimensions to the micrometre level.

The Ultra-Fast Systems component of the Nanoelectronics Research Centre at the University of Glasgow is a founding member of a large international consortium which is developing a related concept: smart specks.

Smart Dust entered the Gartner Hype Cycle on Emerging Technologies in 2003, and returned in 2013, as the most speculative entrant.

In 2022, a Nature paper written by Shyamnath Gollakota, Vikram Iyer, Hans Gaensbauer and Thomas Daniel, all from the University of Washington, presented tiny light-weight programmable battery-free wireless sensors that can be dispersed in the wind. These devices were inspired by Dandelion seeds that can travel as far as a kilometer in dry, windy, and warm conditions.

==Examples==
Dust Networks started a project exploring the application of Smartdust, which included:

* Defense-related sensor networks such as battlefield surveillance, treaty monitoring, transportation monitoring, and scud hunting.

* Virtual keyboard sensors: by attaching miniature remotes to each fingernail, accelerometers could then sense the orientation and motion of each fingertip, and communicate this data to a computer in a wristwatch.
* Inventory control: by placing miniature sensors on each object in the inventory system (product package, carton, pallet, truck warehouse, internet), each component could &quot;talk&quot; to the next component in the system. This evolved into today&#x27;s RFID inventory control systems.
* Product quality monitoring: temperature and humidity monitoring of perishables such as meat, produce, and dairy.
* Impact, vibration and temperature monitoring of consumer electronics, for failure analysis and diagnostic information, e.g. monitoring the vibration of bearings to detect frequency signatures that may indicate imminent failure.

<text>TinyOS is an embedded, component-based operating system and platform for low-power wireless devices, such as those used in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), smartdust, ubiquitous computing, personal area networks, building automation, and smart meters. It is written in the programming language nesC, as a set of cooperating tasks and processes. It began as a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley, Intel Research, and Crossbow Technology, was released as free and open-source software under a BSD license, and has since grown into an international consortium, the TinyOS Alliance.

TinyOS has been used in space, being implemented in ESTCube-1.

==Implementation==

TinyOS applications are written in the programming language nesC, a dialect of the C language optimized for the memory limits of sensor networks. Its supplementary tools are mainly in the form of Java and shell script front-ends. Associated libraries and tools, such as the nesC compiler and Atmel AVR binutils toolchains, are mostly written in C.

TinyOS programs are built of software components, some of which present hardware abstractions. Components are connected to each other using interfaces. TinyOS provides interfaces and components for common abstractions such as packet communication, routing, sensing, actuation and storage.

TinyOS is fully non-blocking: it has one call stack. Thus, all input/output (I/O) operations that last longer than a few hundred microseconds are asynchronous and have a callback. To enable the native compiler to better optimize across call boundaries, TinyOS uses nesC&#x27;s features to link these callbacks, called events, statically. While being non-blocking enables TinyOS to maintain high concurrency with one stack, it forces programmers to write complex logic by stitching together many small event handlers. To support larger computations, TinyOS provides tasks, which are similar to a Deferred Procedure Call and interrupt handler bottom halves. A TinyOS component can post a task, which the OS will schedule to run later. Tasks are non-preemptive and run in first in, first out order. This simple concurrency model is typically sufficient for I/O centric applications, but its difficulty with CPU-heavy applications has led to developing a thread library for the OS, named TOSThreads. TOSThreads are unmaintained and have been deprecated.

TinyOS code is statically linked with program code and is compiled into a small binary, using a custom GNU toolchain. Associated utilities are provided to complete a development platform for working with TinyOS.

<text>Nahwa is a territory that forms part of the Emirate of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates. It is a counter-enclave (or second-order enclave) within the Omani territory of Madha, which is itself an exclave of Oman and an enclave within the United Arab Emirates.

Access to the village of Nahwa is through the northernmost road into the Madha enclave south of Khor Fakkan which leads to New Madha. From New Madha, there is a paved but winding road (about ) leading to Nahwa.

Entering Nahwa, there is an Emirati police outpost some after the boundary marker. The village itself is further up the road, on the same side as the police outpost. It consists of about 40 buildings and has its own clinic. This part of the village is called New Nahwa, and there are more houses further down the road in Old Nahwa. The third part of Nahwa is the village of Shis.

While the situation is uncommon, Nahwa is not the only exclave in the world surrounded by another enclave; some exclaves of Dutch Baarle-Nassau are embedded in Belgian Baarle-Hertog enclaves.

==History==

Nahwa&#x27;s counter-enclave was formed as a result of Madha&#x27;s decision to declare allegiance to Oman instead of Al Qawasim of Sharjah, Al Qawasim of Ras Al Khaimah, or Al Sharqi of Fujairah which today all form part of the United Arab Emirates. 

In the late 1930s or early 1940s the leaders of the four rival clans who ruled the Musandam Peninsula (Al Qassimi of Ras Al Khaimah, Al Qassimi of Sharjah, Al Sharqi of Fujairah, and the Bu Said of Oman) gathered a group of village elders of the nearby village of Madha and posed the question as to which sheikhdom the Madhanis would declare allegiance. While Madha chose Oman, Nahwa chose to stay loyal to Al Qawasim of Sharjah, effectively making them a counter enclave within the exclave of Madha. Following consultations between the area&#x27;s tribes and Julian F. Walker, the British representative to the Trucial States, the borders were established and later finalized in 1969.

<doc id="669371" wikidata="Q21948535" url="?curid=669371" title="Okinawa woodpecker">
<text>The is a woodpecker endemic to the Okinawa Prefecture of Japan. 

== Taxonomy ==
Other common names for this species are Noguchi&#x27;s woodpecker, Okinawan woodpecker, Pryer&#x27;s woodpecker and Ryukyu woodpecker. Some taxonomic authorities place this species in the monotypic genus &quot;Sapheopipo&quot;.

== Description ==

This is a medium-sized (31 cm), dark woodpecker. It is dark brown in color with red-tipped feathers. It has white spots on the primaries. The head is a paler brown, with a dark red crown on the male and a blackish-brown one on the female. The call is a sharp whit call and a variable &quot;kyu-kyu kup kup kup&quot; or &quot;kyu kyu kup&quot;.

== Habitat ==
Their breeding habitat is subtropical, evergreen broad-leaved forest that is at least 30 years old on Okinawa Island, with tall trees of more than 20 cm in diameter. Nesting is between late February and May.

== Conservation ==
This woodpecker is critically endangered. It has a single tiny, declining population which is threatened by habitat loss of mature forest due to logging, dam construction, agriculture, military and golf course developments. A major problem now is that one of their main habitats is being destroyed. The current population is estimated at less than 600. This species is suspected to be declining at a rate of 10-19% over ten years, as a result of ongoing clearance of old-growth forests.

This woodpecker is legally protected in Japan. It occurs in Yonaha-dake Prefecture Protection Area and small protected areas on Mount Ibu and Mount Nishime and conservation organisations have purchased sites where it occurs, but it is mainly found in the Okinawa Prefecture. In 1996, Yambaru was designated as a national park.

=== Threats to the species ===
The habitat of the Okinawa woodpecker is threatened by the construction of six new American helipads located about 9.5 km Southwest of the Yanbaru forest of Takae. The lives of the birds themselves are also put at risk by the flights of V-22 Ospreys over the island.

<text>The Omani territory of Madha () is an exclave of the Musandam Governorate, enclaved by the United Arab Emirates (UAE); inside it, there is a second-order enclave: Nahwa, which is part of the UAE Emirate of Sharjah. Madha is located halfway between the Musandam Peninsula and the rest of Oman.

The exclave is on the Fujairah–Khor Fakkan road, which is mostly in the Emirate of Sharjah, and covers approximately . There are two exits to Madha on the Fujairah–Khorfakkan road. This territory is the only territory between UAE and Oman which is not lined with any barrier and there is no border crossing between Madha, Nahwa, or the UAE.

==History==
At the start of the 19th century, Madha belonged to the Qawasim of Ras Al Khaimah but the Shihuh of Dibba Bai&#x27;ah took it by force some time between 1869 and 1900. From that point, they had been aligned with the Shihuh from Dibba Bai&#x27;ah and their leader Muhammad bin Salih. The Madhanis determined that there was no point of staying with him and they needed a stronger government.

In the late 1930s or early 1940s, the leaders of the four rival clans who ruled the Musandam Peninsula (Al Qassimi of Ras Al Khaimah, Al Qassimi of Sharjah, Al Sharqi of Fujairah, and the Bu Said of Oman) gathered a group of village elders of Madha and posed a question as to which sheikhdom the Madhanis wanted to have allegiance to. While all the other villages and towns around them (including the village of Nahwa that is within Madha) aligned themselves with the ruling families of Sharjah, Fujairah and Ras Al Khaimah, the Madhanis were swayed by the local representative, or wali, of the sultan of Oman Hamad bin Saif Al bu Sa&#x27;idi. The Madhanis chose Oman in the 1930s based on the firm belief that Oman was wealthier, had a stronger government, and would be better placed to protect the village&#x27;s water supply. The boundary was settled in 1969 and Madha residents&#x27; decision to align with Oman made them an exclave of the Sultanate of Oman.

Madha is mostly empty, with the developed portion, called &quot;New Madha&quot;, containing roads, a school, post office, an &#x27;Eid ground, police station, an Omani bank, electricity and water supply, and an airstrip. There is also a Royal Oman Police patrol.

The population is less than 3,000.

In 2014, it was announced that a museum would be built to house the collection of local historian Mohammed bin Salem al Mad’hani.

==Climate==
Madha is a mountainous area with rugged terrain, and the climate is hot and dry in the summers and mild in winters.

== Tourist attractions ==
===Water springs===
In the Wilayat of Madha there are some water springs, such as: Ain Al-Samay, which has a flow rate of three liters per second, and Ain Hajar Bani Hamid, which has a flow rate of about four liters per second.

===Sarooj Dam===
The Sarooj Dam is one of the city&#x27;s main attractions. Following the recent rains, the dam has significantly filled up, creating a lake of fresh water, making it a well-liked destination for travelers who wish to take in the gorgeous views and the fresh water.

===Madha Fort===
A number of historical structures can be found in Madha, including the Madha Fort, which is thought to have been constructed in the 17th century under the rule of Sultan bin Saif Al-Yarubi. The fort is a must-see for history aficionados and a superb illustration of traditional Omani architecture.

=== Madha Banyan Trees ===
In the farming area a group of well-established banyan trees are found. The farming area is watered by falaj system with water coming from the mountain springs.

===Madha House Museum===
Muhammad bin Salem Al Madhani founded it and started gathering his exhibits in 1976 AD. Numerous items and antiques from before the birth of Christ can be found at the museum, including pottery, coinage, and agricultural implements.

Inscriptions on stones, fragments of arrows, spears, and other ancient weaponry as well as seals, timepieces, and various Omani rocks are also included.

The museum displays a number of documents, manuscripts, and historical coins dating back to the tenth century AD, such as: a Greek silver coin used during the reign of Alexander the Great, a very small coin with a star made of stone on both sides, and a group of coins that were minted during the Umayyad and Abbasid eras.

===Cultural festivals===
Additionally, Madha is well-known for its annual cultural festivals. These celebrations feature traditional music and dance performances, culinary festivals, and arts and crafts exhibitions as they honor the region&#x27;s rich history and culture.

<doc id="669379" wikidata="Q739438" url="?curid=669379" title="D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson">
<text>Sir D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson CB FRS FRSE (2 May 1860 – 21 June 1948) was a Scottish biologist, mathematician and classics scholar. He was a pioneer of mathematical and theoretical biology, travelled on expeditions to the Bering Strait and held the position of Professor of Natural History at University College, Dundee for 32 years, then at St Andrews for 31 years. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, was knighted, and received the Darwin Medal and the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal.

Thompson is remembered as the author of the 1917 book &quot;On Growth and Form&quot;, which led the way for the scientific explanation of morphogenesis, the process by which patterns and body structures are formed in plants and animals.

Thompson&#x27;s description of the mathematical beauty of nature, and the mathematical basis of the forms of animals and plants, stimulated thinkers as diverse as Julian Huxley, C. H. Waddington, Alan Turing, René Thom, Claude Lévi-Strauss, Eduardo Paolozzi, Le Corbusier, Christopher Alexander and Mies van der Rohe.

==Life==
===Early life===

Thompson was born at 3 Brandon Street in Edinburgh to Fanny Gamgee (sister of Sampson Gamgee) and D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1829–1902), Classics Master at Edinburgh Academy and later Professor of Greek at Queen&#x27;s College, Galway. His mother, Fanny Gamgee (1840–1860), died 9 days after his birth as a result of complications and he was brought up by his maternal grandfather Joseph Gamgee (1801–1895), a veterinary surgeon. He lived with his grandfather and uncle, John Gamgee, at 12 Castle Terrace, facing north onto Edinburgh Castle.

From 1870 to 1877 he attended The Edinburgh Academy and won the 1st Edinburgh Academical Club Prize in 1877. In 1878, he matriculated at the University of Edinburgh to study medicine. Two years later, he moved to Trinity College, Cambridge to study zoology. As a student at Cambridge, D&#x27;Arcy Thompson was first a sizar, and then received a scholarship. To earn money to support his education he translated Hermann Müller&#x27;s work on the fertilisation of flowers, because the topic appealed to him. His translation was published in 1883, and included an introduction by Charles Darwin. He speculated later, that if he had chosen to translate Wilhelm Olbers Focke&#x27;s hybridisation of flowers, he &quot;might have anticipated the discovery of Mendel by twenty years&quot;. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Science in 1883.

===Career===
From 1883 to 1884, Thompson stayed in Cambridge as a Junior Demonstrator in physiology, teaching students. In 1884, he was appointed Professor of Biology (later Natural History) at University College, Dundee, a post he held for 32 years. One of his first tasks was to create a Zoology Museum for teaching and research, now named after him.

In 1885 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Patrick Geddes, Frank W. Young, William Evans Hoyle and Daniel John Cunningham. He served as vice president to the Society from 1916 to 1919 and as president from 1934 to 1939.

In 1896 and 1897, he went on expeditions to the Bering Straits, representing the British Government in an international inquiry into the fur seal industry to assess the fur seal&#x27;s declining numbers. &quot;Thompson&#x27;s diplomacy avoided an international incident&quot; between Russia and the United States which both had hunting interests in this area.

His final report for the government drew attention also to the near extinction of the sea otter and whale populations. He became one of the first to press for conservation agreements, and his recommendations contributed to the issuing of species protection orders. He subsequently was appointed Scientific Adviser to the Fisheries Board of Scotland and later, representative to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

He took the opportunity to collect many valuable specimens for his museum, one of the largest in the country at the time, specialising in Arctic zoology, through his links to the Dundee whalers. The D&#x27;Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum still has (in 2012) the Japanese spider crab that he collected, and the rare skeleton of a Steller&#x27;s Sea Cow.

Whilst in Dundee, Thompson sat on the committee of management of the Dundee Private Hospital for Women. He was a founder member of the Dundee Social Union and pressed for it &quot;to buy four slum properties in the town&quot;, which they renovated so that &quot;the poorest families of Dundee could live there.&quot; He encouraged and supported the social reformer Mary Lily Walker in her work with the social union.

In 1917, aged 57, Thompson was appointed to the Chair of Natural History at the University of St Andrews, where he remained for the last 31 years of his life. In 1918 he delivered the Royal Institution Christmas Lecture on &quot;The Fish of the Sea&quot;. The German British mathematician Walter Ledermann described in his memoir how, as an assistant in Mathematics, he met the biology Professor Thompson at St Andrews in the mid 1930s and how Thompson &quot;was fond of exercising his skills as an amateur of mathematics&quot;, that &quot;he used quite sophisticated mathematical methods to elucidate the shapes that occur in the living world&quot; and &quot;[...] differential equations, a subject which evidently lay outside d&#x27;Arcy Thompson&#x27;s fields of knowledge at that time.&quot; Ledermann wrote how on one occasion he helped him, working and writing out the answer to his question.

In &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine in October 1923, he wrote:

===Family===

On 4 July 1901 Thompson married Maureen, elder daughter of William Drury, of Dublin. His wife and three daughters survived him.

He died at his home in St Andrews after flying home from India in 1948, at the age of 87, having attended the Science Congress at Delhi, and staying in India for some months. Upon returning, &quot;he suffered a breakdown in health, from which he never fully recovered.&quot; He is buried with his maternal grandparents, the Gamgees, and half-sisters in Dean Cemetery in western Edinburgh.

==Major works==
===&quot;History of Animals&quot;===

In 1910, Thompson published his translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;History of Animals&quot;. He had worked on the enormous task intermittently for many years. It was not the first translation of the book into English, but the earlier attempts by Thomas Taylor (1809) and Richard Cresswell (1862) were inaccurate, and criticised at the time as showing &quot;not only an inadequate knowledge of Greek, but an extremely imperfect acquaintance with zoology&quot;. Thompson&#x27;s version benefited from his excellent Greek, his expertise in zoology, his &quot;full&quot; knowledge of Aristotle&#x27;s biology, and his command of the English language, resulting in a fine translation, &quot;correct, free and .. idiomatic&quot;. More recently, the evolutionary biologist Armand Leroi admired Thompson&#x27;s translation:

===&quot;On Growth and Form&quot;===

Thompson&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;On Growth and Form&quot;, led the way for the scientific explanation of morphogenesis, the process by which patterns and body structures are formed in plants and animals. It was written in Dundee, mostly in 1915, though wartime shortages and his many last-minute alterations delayed publication until 1917. The central theme of the book is that biologists of its author&#x27;s day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. 
He had previously criticized Darwinism in his paper &quot;Some Difficulties of Darwinism&quot; in an 1884 meeting for the British Association for the Advancement of Science. &quot;On Growth and Form&quot; explained in detail why he believed Darwinism to be an inadequate explanation for the origin of new species. He did not openly reject natural selection, but regarded it as secondary to the origin of biological form. Instead, he advocated structuralism as an alternative to natural selection in governing the form of species, with a hint that vitalism was the unseen driving force.

On the concept of allometry, the study of the relationship of body size and shape, Thompson wrote: 

Using a mass of examples, Thompson pointed out correlations between biological forms and mechanical phenomena. He showed the similarity in the forms of jellyfish and the forms of drops of liquid falling into viscous fluid, and between the internal supporting structures in the hollow bones of birds and well-known engineering truss designs. He described phyllotaxis (numerical relationships between spiral structures in plants) and its relationship to the Fibonacci sequence.

Perhaps the most famous part of the work is chapter XVII, &quot;The Comparison of Related Forms,&quot; where Thompson explored the degree to which differences in the forms of related animals could be described by means of relatively simple mathematical transformations.

The book is a work in the &quot;descriptive&quot; tradition; Thompson did not articulate his insights in the form of experimental hypotheses that can be tested. He was aware of this, saying that &quot;This book of mine has little need of preface, for indeed it is &#x27;all preface&#x27; from beginning to end.&quot;

==Honours==
Elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1916, elected an International honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1928, knighted in 1937 and received the Gold Medal of the Linnean Society in 1938. In 1941, he was elected to the American Philosophical Society. 
He was awarded the Darwin Medal in 1946.
For his revised &quot;On Growth and Form&quot;, he was awarded the Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal from the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1942. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1885, and was active in the Society over many years,
serving as president from 1934 to 1939.

==Legacy==

===Interdisciplinary influence===

&quot;On Growth and Form&quot; has inspired thinkers including the biologists Julian Huxley, Conrad Hal Waddington and Stephen Jay Gould, the mathematicians Alan Turing and René Thom, the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss and artists including Richard Hamilton, Eduardo Paolozzi, and Ben Nicholson with his ideas on the mathematical basis of the forms of animals, and perhaps especially on morphogenesis. Jackson Pollock owned a copy. Waddington and other developmental biologists were struck particularly by the chapter on Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Transformations&quot;, where he showed that the various shapes of related species (such as of fish) could be presented as geometric transformations, anticipating the evolutionary developmental biology of a century later.
The book led Turing to write a famous paper &quot;The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis&quot; on how patterns such as those seen on the skins of animals can emerge from a simple chemical system.
Lévi-Strauss cites Thompson in his 1963 book &quot;Structural Anthropology&quot;.

&quot;On Growth and Form&quot; is seen as a classic text in architecture and is admired by architects &quot;for its exploration of natural geometries in the dynamics of growth and physical processes.&quot; The architects and designers Le Corbusier, László Moholy-Nagy and Mies van der Rohe were inspired by the book. Peter Medawar, the 1960 Nobel Laureate in Medicine, called it &quot;the finest work of literature in all the annals of science that have been recorded in the English tongue&quot;.

===150th anniversary===
In 2010, the 150th anniversary of his birth was celebrated with events and exhibitions at the Universities of Dundee and St Andrews; the main lecture theatre in the University of Dundee&#x27;s Tower Building was renamed in his honour, a publication exploring his work in Dundee and the history of his Zoology Museum was published by University of Dundee Museum Services, and an exhibition on his work was held in the city.

===Museum and archives===
The original Zoology Museum at Dundee became neglected after his move to St Andrews. In 1956 the building, which it was housed in, was scheduled for demolition and the museum collection was dispersed, with some parts going to the British Museum. A teaching collection was retained and forms the core of the University of Dundee&#x27;s current D&#x27;Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum.
In 2011, the University of Dundee was awarded a £100,000 grant by The Art Fund to build a collection of art inspired by his ideas and collections, much of it displayed in the Museum.

Special Collections at the University of St Andrews hold Thompson&#x27;s personal papers which include over 30,000 items. Archive Services at the University of Dundee hold records of his time at Dundee, and a collection of papers relating to Thompson collected by Professor Alexander David Peacock, a later holder of the chair of Natural History at University College, Dundee.

In 1892 D&#x27;Arcy Thompson donated Davis Straits specimens of crustaceans, pycnogonids, and other invertebrates to the Cambridge University Museum of Zoology.

<text>Guido Knopp (born 29 January 1948 in Treysa, Hesse) is a German journalist and author. He is well known in Germany, mainly because he has produced a great number of TV documentaries, predominantly about the &quot;Third Reich&quot; and National Socialism, but also about other topics, such as Stalinism.

== Life and work ==
After earning his doctoral degree in history and political science, Knopp worked as a newspaper editor at the Welt am Sonntag and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. In 1978 he took up employment at the German TV station ZDF. Since then, he has produced many documentaries about the Nazi dictatorship like &quot;Hitlers Helfer&quot; (&quot;Hitler&#x27;s Henchmen&quot;), &quot;Hitler-Eine Bilanz&quot; (&quot;Hitler-taking stock&quot;) or &quot;Die SS: Eine Warnung der Geschichte&quot; (&quot;The SS: A warning from history&quot;), but also, for example, &quot;Vatikan&quot; (about the power of the popes) or &quot;Kanzler: Die Mächtigen der Republik&quot; (about Germany&#x27;s post-war federal chancellors). Knopp hosts a weekly German television program, usually broadcast on Sundays, called &quot;History&quot;. In 1999, he produced a series called &quot;100 Jahre – der Countdown&quot;, which sums up the whole 20th century, year by year, and is still sometimes broadcast during holidays by the Phoenix television station. For the publication of his book &quot;Top Spies – Traitors in the Secret War&quot; (1994), Knopp worked with the German Federal Intelligence Service and several retired spies to present their personal story and explain their work to a broad public.

Knopp&#x27;s history films are often criticised for presenting the Third Reich too superficially and for &quot;editing history&quot; to play down the role of the German public in building and supporting Hitler&#x27;s regime. He was condemned for rewriting history by leaving out the role of the Wehrmacht (former German Army) in the cruelties of World War II. In 2004, a group of international historians warned that documentaries like the ones produced by Knopp could reduce important historic facts to mere infotainment. 

In 2003, Knopp pleaded for Konrad Adenauer to be featured in the &quot;Unsere Besten&quot; list of greatest Germans, compiled by ZDF-TV. In 2004, he received the Goldene Kamera and the Bavarian and European TV award for his work. He teaches journalism at the Gustav-Siewerth-Akademie in Weilheim-Bierbronnen (Baden-Württemberg) and lives in Mainz. His publishing house is the German Random House group (Bertelsmann group). In 2008 Knopp worked on a movie about failed Hitler assassin Berthold Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg.

<text>The mayor of Winnipeg is a member of Winnipeg City Council, but does not represent a ward.
The position of mayor was created in 1873 following the incorporation of Winnipeg. Since 1998, the term of office has been for four years.

The 44th and current mayor of Winnipeg is Scott Gillingham, elected on October 26, 2022.

==History==
The position of mayor was created in 1873 following the incorporation of Winnipeg (renamed from Fort Garry), now the provincial capital of Manitoba. From 1874 to 1955, the mayor of Winnipeg was elected for one year only; then, from 1955 until 1972, the term of office was extended to two years.

The election of the first City Council was held on 6 October 1971 and the new City of Winnipeg was amalgamated on 1 January 1972. Thereafter, the new Council consisted of 50 councillors—elected from each of Winnipeg&#x27;s wards—and 1 mayor, who is elected by the city as a whole. From 1972 onward, the mayor held office for a term of three years. Finally, in 1998, the term of office was extended to four years.

<text>Victoria de los Ángeles López García (1 November 192315 January 2005) was a Spanish operatic lyric soprano and recitalist whose career began after the Second World War and reached its height in the years from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s.

==Early life==
She was born Victoria de los Ángeles López García in the porter&#x27;s lodge of the University of Barcelona, to Bernardo Lopez Gómez (or Gamez), a university caretaker, and Victoria García. She studied voice under Dolores Frau, and guitar with Graciano Tarragó, at the Barcelona Conservatory, graduating in 1941 after just three years, at the age of 18.

==Career in music==
In 1941, while still a student, she made her operatic debut as Mimì in &quot;La bohème&quot; at the Liceu, afterwards resuming her musical studies. In 1945, she returned to the Liceu to make her professional debut as the Countess in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;.

After winning first prize in the Geneva International Music Competition in 1947, she sang Salud in Falla&#x27;s &quot;La vida breve&quot; with the BBC in London in 1948. She was accompanied on many of her early recordings by both and his daughter, the guitarist Renata Tarragó.

In her early years in particular, she also sang a lot of florid music (&quot;music antiche&quot;). While she later made fewer appearances in opera, she continued to give recitals focusing on mostly French, German Lieder and Spanish art songs or songs with Nahuatl texts by Mexican composer Salvador Moreno Manzano into the 1990s.

In 1949, she made her first appearance in the Paris Opéra as Marguerite. The following year, she made her debut in Salzburg and at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden as Mimì, and in the United States with a recital at Carnegie Hall. In March 1951, she made her Metropolitan Opera debut in New York as Marguérite, and she went on to sing with the company for ten years. In 1952, she became an instant favourite in Buenos Aires at the Teatro Colón as the title role in &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. She returned to Buenos Aires many times until 1979. She sang at La Scala in Milan from 1950 to 1956 and, in 1957, she sang at the Vienna State Opera. 

After making her debut at the Bayreuth Festival as Elisabeth in &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; in 1961, she devoted herself principally to a concert career. However, for the next twenty years, she continued to make occasional appearances in one of her favourite operatic roles, Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. She was among the first Spanish-born operatic singers to record the complete opera, having done so in 1958 in a recording conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham, using the recitatives added by Ernest Guiraud after Bizet&#x27;s death. Though Carmen lay comfortably in her range, she nevertheless also sang major soprano roles, the best known of which were Donna Anna, Manon, Nedda, Desdemona, Cio-Cio-San, Mimi, Violetta and Mélisande.

James Hinton, Jr. praised the curious means she used to achieve her characterisation of Rosina in the 1954 Met&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;: 
:...she — almost literally – does nothing at all that is in the conventional sense &#x27;effective&#x27;. She is rapidly becoming one of those great rarities... a personality who makes everyone believe in her characterizations. Even in that there is a flaw, for she really offers no characterization. The personality is always the same... Yet the audience believes... that this is the way whichever character she happens to be dressed as must have been...&quot;
De los Ángeles performed regularly in song recitals with pianists Gerald Moore and Geoffrey Parsons, occasionally appearing with other eminent singers, such as Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau. Her recitals of Spanish songs with the pianist Alicia de Larrocha, a fellow Barcelona native who was her close friend, were also legendary. She sang at the closing ceremony of the 1992 Summer Olympics, aged 68.

She made many widely acclaimed recordings, including those of &quot;La vida breve&quot;, &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. The last three paired her with the outstanding tenor Jussi Björling. She was particularly appreciative of Björling&#x27;s unique talent. In de los Ángeles&#x27; biography by Peter Roberts, de los Ángeles noted that &quot;in despite of technical developments, none of the Jussi Björling recordings give you the true sound of his voice. It was a far, far more beautiful voice than you can hear on the recordings he left&quot;.

The government of France named her a Chevalier the Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1994.

==Personal life and death==
She married Enrique Magriña in 1948. He and one of their two sons predeceased her.

She was hospitalized for a bronchial infection on December 31, 2004, and died of respiratory failure on 15 January 2005, aged 81. She was buried in the Montjuïc Cemetery, Barcelona.

==Recognition==
Her obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; (UK) noted that she must be counted “among the finest singers of the second half of the 20th century&quot;. James Hinton, Jr. praised her &quot;meltingly lovely middle voice&quot;. Elizabeth Forbes, writing in UK&#x27;s &quot;The Independent&quot;, also noted that &quot;It is impossible to imagine a more purely beautiful voice than that of Victoria de los Ángeles at the height of her career in the 1950s and early 1960s&quot;. She was ranked number 3, after Maria Callas and Dame Joan Sutherland, in the &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot;″s List of The Top Twenty Sopranos of All Time (2007).

The municipal music school of Sant Cugat del Vallès is named for her (&quot;Escola Municipal de Música Victòria dels Àngels&quot;) and is located on a plaza bearing her name (Plaça Victòria dels Àngels). This school preserves her first grand piano, a Steck no. 49253 from 1913, purchased in Barcelona in 1948, which has a beautiful sound. Several other municipalities in Catalonia and many other in all of Spain have streets named after her.

In 2007 a private foundation was established in order to preserve her legacy and promote her figure, named Fundació Victoria de los Ángeles.

<text>Sui iuris (), also spelled sui juris, is a Latin phrase that literally means &quot;of one&#x27;s own right&quot;. It is used in both the Catholic Church&#x27;s canon law and secular law. The term church &quot;sui iuris&quot; is used in the Catholic &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; (CCEO) to denote the autonomous churches in Catholic communion. The Catholic Church consists of 24 churches, including the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic churches. 

==Etymology and spelling==
The Latin &quot;sui iuris&quot; (the individual words meaning &#x27;self&#x27; and &#x27;law&#x27;) corresponds to the Greek &#x27;αὐτόνομος&#x27;, from which the English word autonomy is derived.

The spelling in Classical Latin is &quot;sui iuris&quot;, and in Medieval Latin &quot;sui juris&quot;. English Law gets the term from Medieval Latin, and so spells it &quot;sui juris&quot;.

==Catholic canon law==

Church documents such as the &quot;Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches&quot; apply the Latin term &quot;sui iuris&quot; to the particular Churches that are together the Catholic Church, the Roman Catholic Church and those in communion with it. 

By far the largest of the &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches is the Latin Church. Over that particular church, the Pope exercises his papal authority, and the authority that in other particular churches belongs to a Patriarch. He has, therefore, been referred to also as Patriarch of the West. The other particular Churches are called Eastern Catholic Churches, each of which, if large enough, has its own patriarch or other chief hierarch, with authority over all the bishops of that particular Church or rite.

The same term is applied also to missions that lack enough clergy to be set up as apostolic prefectures but are for various reasons given autonomy and so are not part of any diocese, apostolic vicariate or apostolic prefecture. In 2004, there were eleven such missions: three in the Atlantic, Cayman Islands, Turks and Caicos, and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha; two in the Pacific, Funafuti (Tuvalu), and Tokelau; and six in central Asia, Afghanistan, Baku (Azerbaijan), Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.

===Categories of &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches===

According to CCEO, the Oriental Catholic churches &quot;sui iuris&quot; are of four categories.

====Patriarchal churches====
A patriarchal church is a full-grown form of an Eastern Catholic church. It is &#x27;a community of the Christian faithful joined together by&#x27; a Patriarchal hierarchy. The Patriarch together with the synod of bishops has the legislative, judicial and administrative powers within jurisdictional territory of the patriarchal church, without prejudice to those powers reserved, in the common law, to the Roman pontiff (CCEO 55-150). Among the Eastern Catholic Churches the following churches are of patriarchal status:

#Coptic Catholic Church (1741): Cairo, Egypt
#Maronite Church (union re-affirmed 1182): Bkerke, Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Syria, Argentina, Brazil, United States, Australia, Canada, Mexico
#Syriac Catholic Church (1781): Beirut, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Palestine, Egypt, Sudan, Syria, Turkey, United States and Canada, Venezuela
#Armenian Catholic Church (1742): Beirut, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, Jordan, Palestine, Ukraine, France, Greece, Latin America, Argentina, Romania, United States, Canada, Eastern Europe
#Chaldean Catholic Church (1552): Baghdad, Iraq, Iran, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Turkey, United States
#Melkite Greek Catholic Church (definitively 1726): Damascus, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Brazil, United States, Canada, Mexico, Iraq, Egypt and Sudan, Kuwait, Australia, Venezuela, Argentina

====Major archiepiscopal churches====
Major archiepiscopal churches are the oriental churches, governed by the major archbishops being assisted by the respective synod of bishops. These churches also have almost the same rights and obligations of Patriarchal Churches. A major archbishop is the metropolitan of a see determined or recognized by the Supreme authority of the Church, who presides over an entire Eastern Church &quot;sui iuris&quot; that is not distinguished with the patriarchal title. What is stated in common law concerning patriarchal Churches or patriarchs is understood to be applicable to major archiepiscopal churches or major archbishops, unless the common law expressly provides otherwise or it is evident from the nature of the matter&quot; (CCEO.151, 152). Following are the Major Archiepiscopal Churches:

#Syro-Malankara Catholic Church (1930): Thiruvananthapuram, India, United Arab Emirates, United States of America
#Syro-Malabar Church (1923): Ernakulam, India, Middle East, Europe and America
#Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic (1697): Blaj, Romania, United States of America
#Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (1595): Kyiv, Ukraine, Poland, United States, Canada, Great Britain, Australia, Germany and Scandinavia, France, Brazil, Argentina

====Metropolitan churches====
A &quot;sui iuris&quot; church which is governed by a Metropolitan (Bishop) is called a metropolitan church &quot;sui iuris&quot;. &quot;A Metropolitan Church &quot;sui iuris&quot; is presided over by the Metropolitan of a determined see who has been appointed by the Roman Pontiff and is assisted by a council of hierarchs according to the norm of law&quot; (CCEO. 155§1). The Catholic metropolitan churches are the following:

#Ethiopian Catholic Church (1846): Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
#Ruthenian Catholic Church (1646) – a &quot;sui juris&quot; metropolia, an eparchy, and an apostolic exarchate: United States (594,465), Canada, Ukraine, Czech Republic.
#Slovak Greek Catholic Church (1646): Prešov, Slovakia.
#Eritrean Catholic Church (2015): Asmara, Eritrea
#Hungarian Greek Catholic Church (2015) – Hajdúdorog, Hungary

====Other &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches====
Other than the above-mentioned three forms of &quot;sui iuris&quot; churches there are some other &quot;sui iuris&quot; ecclesiastical communities. It is &quot;a Church &quot;sui iuris&quot; which is neither patriarchal nor major archiepiscopal nor Metropolitan, and is entrusted to a hierarch who presides over it in accordance with the norm of common law and the particular law established by the Roman Pontiff&quot; (CCEO. 174). The following churches are of this juridical status:

#Albanian Greek Catholic Church (1628) – apostolic administration: Albania
#Belarusian Greek Catholic Church (1596) – apostolic administration: Belarus
#Bulgarian Greek Catholic Church (1861) – apostolic exarchate: Sofia, Bulgaria
#Byzantine Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia (1611) – an eparchy and an apostolic exarchate: Eparchy of Križevci for Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia
#Greek Byzantine Catholic Church (1829) – two apostolic exarchates: Athens, Greece, Turkey
#Italo-Albanian Catholic Church (never separated) – two eparchies and a territorial abbacy: Italy
#Macedonian Greek Catholic Church (1918) – an eparchy: Skopje, Republic of Macedonia
#Russian Greek Catholic Church (1905) – two apostolic exarchates, at present with no published hierarchs: Russia, China; currently about 34 parishes and communities scattered around the world, including 20 parishes and 5 missions in Russia itself, answering to bishops of other jurisdictions

====Former Byzantine Rite Church====

The Catholic Church in Georgia used to be able to do the Byzantine Rite. However, after grueling Soviet oppression, their church was effectively forced underground and Georgian Greek Catholics are now a minority.
# Georgian Byzantine-Rite Catholics (1900s, with first Uniate movement which joined the Roman Catholic Church appearing in the 1600s) – the Church of Colchin and Iberia

== Secular law ==
In civil law, the phrase &quot;sui juris&quot; indicates legal competence, and refers to an adult who has the capacity to manage his or her own affairs. It is opposed to &quot;alieni juris&quot;, meaning one such as a minor or mentally disabled person who is legally incompetent and under the control of another. It also indicates a person capable of suing and/or being sued in a legal proceeding in his own name (&quot;suo nomine&quot;) without the need of an &quot;ad litem&quot;, that is, a court appointed representative, acting on behalf of a defendant, who is deemed to be incapable of representing himself.

<text>Joged bumbung is a style of gamelan music from Bali, Indonesia on instruments made primarily out of bamboo. The ensemble gets its name from joged, a flirtatious dance often performed at festivals and parties. This style of Gamelan is especially popular in Northern and Western Bali, but is easily found all over the island. Unlike many styles of Balinese Gamelan which have sacred roles in religious festivals, Joged music is much more secular, and in many ways has become the folk music of Bali. With the rapid rise of tourism in recent decades, Joged music is now often found being performed at hotels and restaurants.

The bamboo instruments of the Joged, called Grantang (or commonly Tingklik in central Bali), are marimba-like instruments made out of bamboo. 11 to 14 bamboo canes, split halfway down their length, are then carved so that a closed tube resonator remains on the un-split half. The completed keys are mounted to a wooden or bamboo frame with string or rubber strips. Striking the keys with rubber tipped mallets called pangguls results in a dry sound with little sustain. The instruments are played with both hands: the left hand plays the melody on the lower register, while the right hand plays a faster elaborated version of the melody. When the fast elaboration is too fast for one person to play alone, it is broken into two interlocking parts in a style called Kotekan. 

Most ensembles are tuned to a slendro scale, except in Northern and Western Bali where pelog scales are more common. A typical ensemble will have 4 to 6 grantangs and are accompanied by Suling (flutes), Kendang (Drum), Ceng-ceng (cymbals), and a beat keeping instrument made out of bamboo or bronze. There will also be gongs of various types and a larger bass gramtang called a Jegog playing the underlying melody. In recent years ensembles that incorporate bronze instruments have become more popular and often play compositions from the Gamelan Gong Kebyar repertoire.

<text>The Classic was a professional snooker tournament, which began in 1980 and ended in 1992. It was originally a non-ranking event, but became ranking in 1984. Steve Davis won the event six times and was the last champion.

==History==
The tournament started as the &quot;Wilsons Classic&quot; in January 1980. It was an eight-man invitation event recorded by Granada Television. John Spencer defeated Alex Higgins 4–3 in the final to become the inaugural champion. The second event was held in December the same year, with Steve Davis defeating Dennis Taylor 4–1 in the final.

In 1982, the Russian automobile manufacturer Lada became the sponsor of the event and it was renamed to &quot;Lada Classic&quot;. Steve Davis made the first televised maximum break (147) in his quarter-finals match against John Spencer. Terry Griffiths won in the final 9–8 against Steve Davis. In 1983 the field was expanded to 16 players and moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington. Bill Werbeniuk reached the only final of his career, but lost 9–5 against Steve Davis.

In 1984, the event was granted ranking status. Steve Davis met Tony Meo in the final. Davis was level at 8 frames each with Tony Meo and only the colours were left in the deciding frame. As Meo lined up on the yellow, a spectator yelled out &quot;Come on, Tony!&quot;. Although Meo took time to compose himself after the shout, he missed the yellow and Davis cleared the colours to win.

Mercantile Credit took over the sponsorship for the 1985 and the event was renamed &quot;Mercantile Credit Classic&quot;. Willie Thorne won the only ranking tournament of his career, by beating Cliff Thorburn 13–8 in the final. In 1986 Jimmy White won his first ranking tournament by defeating Thorburn 13–12 in the final. In 1987 the event moved to the Norbreck Castle Hotel in Blackpool, but only just the last 16 played in the final stages, as the opening rounds were played earlier in the season. Steve Davis won in the final 13–12 against Jimmy White. Davis won the event the following year, this time defeating John Parrott 13–11.

In 1989, Doug Mountjoy won his second consecutive ranking tournament, having previously won the UK Championship, by defeating Wayne Jones 13–11. The following year was a tournament of upsets, as only of four of the top sixteen players reached its seeded place. Steve James won his only ranking tournament by defeating Warren King 10–6 in the final. The tournament moved to the Bournemouth International Centre in 1991. Stephen Hendry reached the final of the tournament in 1991 and 1992, but lost 4–10 against Jimmy White and 8–9 against Steve Davis respectively. After the 1992 event, it was discontinued and replaced with the Welsh Open.

<doc id="669402" wikidata="Q2485866" url="?curid=669402" title="Zonohedron">
<text>In geometry, a zonohedron is a convex polyhedron that is centrally symmetric, every face of which is a polygon that is centrally symmetric (a zonogon). Any zonohedron may equivalently be described as the Minkowski sum of a set of line segments in three-dimensional space, or as a three-dimensional projection of a hypercube. Zonohedra were originally defined and studied by E. S. Fedorove, a Russian crystallographer. More generally, in any dimension, the Minkowski sum of line segments forms a polytope known as a zonotope.

== Zonohedra that tile space ==

The original motivation for studying zonohedra is that the Voronoi diagram of any lattice forms a convex uniform honeycomb in which the cells are zonohedra. Any zonohedron formed in this way can tessellate 3-dimensional space and is called a primary parallelohedron. Each primary parallelohedron is combinatorially equivalent to one of five types: the rhombohedron (including the cube), hexagonal prism, truncated octahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, and the rhombo-hexagonal dodecahedron.

== Zonohedra from Minkowski sums ==

Let formula_1 be a collection of three-dimensional vectors. With each vector formula_2 we may associate a line segment formula_3. The Minkowski sum formula_4 forms a zonohedron, and all zonohedra that contain the origin have this form. The vectors from which the zonohedron is formed are called its generators. This characterization allows the definition of zonohedra to be generalized to higher dimensions, giving zonotopes.

Each edge in a zonohedron is parallel to at least one of the generators, and has length equal to the sum of the lengths of the generators to which it is parallel. Therefore, by choosing a set of generators with no parallel pairs of vectors, and by setting all vector lengths equal, we may form an equilateral version of any combinatorial type of zonohedron.

By choosing sets of vectors with high degrees of symmetry, we can form in this way, zonohedra with at least as much symmetry. For instance, generators equally spaced around the equator of a sphere, together with another pair of generators through the poles of the sphere, form zonohedra in the form of prism over regular formula_5-gons: the cube, hexagonal prism, octagonal prism, decagonal prism, dodecagonal prism, etc.
Generators parallel to the edges of an octahedron form a truncated octahedron, and generators parallel to the long diagonals of a cube form a rhombic dodecahedron.

The Minkowski sum of any two zonohedra is another zonohedron, generated by the union of the generators of the two given zonohedra. Thus, the Minkowski sum of a cube and a truncated octahedron forms the truncated cuboctahedron, while the Minkowski sum of the cube and the rhombic dodecahedron forms the truncated rhombic dodecahedron. Both of these zonohedra are simple (three faces meet at each vertex), as is the truncated small rhombicuboctahedron formed from the Minkowski sum of the cube, truncated octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron.

== Zonohedra from arrangements ==

The Gauss map of any convex polyhedron maps each face of the polygon to a point on the unit sphere, and maps each edge of the polygon separating a pair of faces to a great circle arc connecting the corresponding two points. In the case of a zonohedron, the edges surrounding each face can be grouped into pairs of parallel edges, and when translated via the Gauss map any such pair becomes a pair of contiguous segments on the same great circle. Thus, the edges of the zonohedron can be grouped into zones of parallel edges, which correspond to the segments of a common great circle on the Gauss map, and the 1-skeleton of the zonohedron can be viewed as the planar dual graph to an arrangement of great circles on the sphere. Conversely any arrangement of great circles may be formed from the Gauss map of a zonohedron generated by vectors perpendicular to the planes through the circles.

Any simple zonohedron corresponds in this way to a simplicial arrangement, one in which each face is a triangle. Simplicial arrangements of great circles correspond via central projection to simplicial arrangements of lines in the projective plane. There are three known infinite families of simplicial arrangements, one of which leads to the prisms when converted to zonohedra, and the other two of which correspond to additional infinite families of simple zonohedra. There are also many sporadic examples that do not fit into these three families.

It follows from the correspondence between zonohedra and arrangements, and from the Sylvester–Gallai theorem which (in its projective dual form) proves the existence of crossings of only two lines in any arrangement, that every zonohedron has at least one pair of opposite parallelogram faces. (Squares, rectangles, and rhombuses count for this purpose as special cases of parallelograms.) More strongly, every zonohedron has at least six parallelogram faces, and every zonohedron has a number of parallelogram faces that is linear in its number of generators.

== Types of zonohedra ==
Any prism over a regular polygon with an even number of sides forms a zonohedron. These prisms can be formed so that all faces are regular: two opposite faces are equal to the regular polygon from which the prism was formed, and these are connected by a sequence of square faces. Zonohedra of this type are the cube, hexagonal prism, octagonal prism, decagonal prism, dodecagonal prism, etc.

In addition to this infinite family of regular-faced zonohedra, there are three Archimedean solids, all omnitruncations of the regular forms: 
* The truncated octahedron, with 6 square and 8 hexagonal faces. (Omnitruncated tetrahedron)
* The truncated cuboctahedron, with 12 squares, 8 hexagons, and 6 octagons. (Omnitruncated cube)
* The truncated icosidodecahedron, with 30 squares, 20 hexagons and 12 decagons. (Omnitruncated dodecahedron)

In addition, certain Catalan solids (duals of Archimedean solids) are again zonohedra:
* Kepler&#x27;s rhombic dodecahedron is the dual of the cuboctahedron.
* The rhombic triacontahedron is the dual of the icosidodecahedron.

Others with congruent rhombic faces:
* Bilinski&#x27;s rhombic dodecahedron.
* Rhombic icosahedron
* Rhombohedron

There are infinitely many zonohedra with rhombic faces that are not all congruent to each other. They include:
* Rhombic enneacontahedron

== Dissection of zonohedra ==

Every zonohedron with formula_6 zones can be partitioned into formula_7 parallelepipeds, each having three of the same zones, and with one parallelepiped for each triple of zones.

The Dehn invariant of any zonohedron is zero. This implies that any two zonohedra with the same volume can be dissected into each other. This means that it is possible to cut one of the two zonohedra into polyhedral pieces that can be reassembled into the other.

== Zonohedrification ==

Zonohedrification is a process defined by George W. Hart for creating a zonohedron from another polyhedron.

First the vertices of any seed polyhedron are considered vectors from the polyhedron center. These vectors create the zonohedron which we call the zonohedrification of the original polyhedron. If the seed polyhedron has central symmetry, opposite points define the same direction, so the number of zones in the zonohedron is half the number of vertices of the seed. For any two vertices of the original polyhedron, there are two opposite planes of the zonohedrification which each have two edges parallel to the vertex vectors.

==Zonotopes==
The Minkowski sum of line segments in any dimension forms a type of polytope called a zonotope. Equivalently, a zonotope formula_8 generated by vectors formula_9 is given by formula_10. Note that in the special case where formula_11, the zonotope formula_8 is a (possibly degenerate) parallelotope.

The facets of any zonotope are themselves zonotopes of one lower dimension; for instance, the faces of zonohedra are zonogons. Examples of four-dimensional zonotopes include the tesseract (Minkowski sums of &quot;d&quot; mutually perpendicular equal length line segments), the omnitruncated 5-cell, and the truncated 24-cell. Every permutohedron is a zonotope.

===Zonotopes and Matroids===
Fix a zonotope formula_8 defined from the set of vectors formula_14 and let formula_15 be the formula_16 matrix whose columns are the formula_2. Then the vector matroid formula_18 on the columns of formula_15 encodes a wealth of information about formula_8, that is, many properties of formula_8 are purely combinatorial in nature.

For example, pairs of opposite facets of formula_8 are naturally indexed by the cocircuits of formula_23 and if we consider the oriented matroid formula_23 represented by formula_25, then we obtain a bijection between facets of formula_8 and signed cocircuits of formula_23 which extends to a poset anti-isomorphism between the face lattice of formula_8 and the covectors of formula_23 ordered by component-wise extension of formula_30. In particular, if formula_15 and formula_32 are two matrices that differ by a projective transformation then their respective zonotopes are combinatorially equivalent. The converse of the previous statement does not hold: the segment formula_33 is a zonotope and is generated by both formula_34 and by formula_35 whose corresponding matrices, formula_36 and formula_37, do not differ by a projective transformation.

====Tilings====
Tiling properties of the zonotope formula_8 are also closely related to the oriented matroid formula_23 associated to it. First we consider the space-tiling property. The zonotope formula_8 is said to &quot;tile&quot; formula_41 if there is a set of vectors formula_42 such that the union of all translates formula_43 (formula_44) is formula_41 and any two translates intersect in a (possibly empty) face of each. Such a zonotope is called a &quot;space-tiling zonotope.&quot; The following classification of space-tiling zonotopes is due to McMullen: The zonotope formula_8 generated by the vectors formula_47 tiles space if and only if the corresponding oriented matroid is regular. So the seemingly geometric condition of being a space-tiling zonotope actually depends only on the combinatorial structure of the generating vectors.

Another family of tilings associated to the zonotope formula_8 are the &quot;zonotopal tilings&quot; of formula_8. A collection of zonotopes is a zonotopal tiling of formula_8 if it a polyhedral complex with support formula_8, that is, if the union of all zonotopes in the collection is formula_8 and any two intersect in a common (possibly empty) face of each. Many of the images of zonohedra on this page can be viewed as zonotopal tilings of a 2-dimensional zonotope by simply considering them as planar objects (as opposed to planar representations of three dimensional objects). The Bohne-Dress Theorem states that there is a bijection between zonotopal tilings of the zonotope formula_8 and &quot;single-element lifts&quot; of the oriented matroid formula_23 associated to formula_8.

== Volume ==
Zonohedra, and &quot;n&quot;-dimensional zonotopes in general, are noteworthy for admitting a simple analytic formula for their volume.

Let formula_56 be the zonotope formula_10 generated by a set of vectors formula_58. Then the n-dimensional volume of formula_56 is given by
:formula_60

The determinant in this formula makes sense because (as noted above) when the set formula_61 has cardinality equal to the dimension formula_6 of the ambient space, the zonotope is a parallelotope.

Note that when formula_63, this formula simply states that the zonotope has n-volume zero.

<text>Alford Windmill is a five-sailed windmill in Alford, Lincolnshire and the only surviving windmill out of four. Though the windmill has been restored to working order, it no longer supplies flour for sale.

==Construction==

Alford Windmill is a seven-storeyed Lincolnshire type tower windmill with a stage – featuring a slender, tapering brick tower, tarred to keep the moisture out, covered with a white onion-shaped (ogee) cap with fan-stage, huge fantail, and white sails. She has five patent-shutter sails and originally three, later on four, pairs of stones (two pairs of grey or peak stones (cut from rock found in the Peak District) and two French &quot;quartzite&quot; stones).

==The Seven Storeys==

#ground floor (contains a hurst frame with the engine-driven (from the outside) fourth pair of (grey) stones)
#storage floor
#spout (stage) floor (also called meal floor)
#stones floor (with the original three pairs of stones (one grey pair, two French pairs)
#lower bin floor
#upper bin floor (with the sack hoist)
#dust or cap floor (providing access to the inside of the cap)

The mill provides a flywheel at the mill&#x27;s base connected by pulley to a town gas driven engine in the adjacent shed. This engine makes the mill independent of wind if it is insufficient to drive the sailcross. In its heyday Alford Mill was capable of grinding 4 to 5 tonnes of corn a day.

==History==
Built as a seven-storeyed windmill in 1837 by the well-known local millwright John Oxley the mill belonged to a group of four windmills and is the sole survivor today. At the end of the 19th to the beginning of the 20th century Alford featured a four-sailed mill, &quot;Wallace&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;Station Mill&quot;, now a stump; a five-sailed windmill, &quot;Hoyles&#x27;s Windmill&quot;, today&#x27;s &quot;Alford Mill&quot;; and a six-sailer, the six-storeyed &quot;Myers&#x27;s Windmill&quot;, built in 1827 with six left-handed sails, and also called the &quot;Alford Mill&quot; dismantled in 1973.

The last commercial operators of the windmill were the Hoyles family. Purchased by Harry Hoyles, a local farmer and land owner, in the early 20th century, the business of milling and baking continued until 1955, run by his sons Walter, Arthur and Winston (The Miller). In those times the mill was known as the &quot;Hoyles&#x27;s Mill&quot;. The business closed due to advancements in technology in 1955 and the mill was initially sold to Fred Banks of Kirton in Lindsey in 1957, a private buyer and owner of Mount Pleasant Mill, who subsequently restored the windmill to working order. The last surviving windmill became then known as the &quot;Alford Windmill&quot;.

In 1978, miller Fred Banks had to replace the mill&#x27;s cap and all five sails. The same year the mill changed hands to the Lincolnshire County Council which took care for the mill&#x27;s restoration over many years. The mill remained leased to Mr Banks, the former owner, until 1986 when he gave up his milling business, his place being taken by James Waterfield of Boston in the following year, owner of the famous Maud Foster Windmill. The mill was then leased to Geoff Dees for some years, until the lease was sold in January 2010 to the current lease holder, Ian Shepherd.

<doc id="669421" wikidata="Q193361" url="?curid=669421" title="Carlos Moyá">
<text>Carlos Moyá Llompart (; born 27 August 1976) is a Spanish former professional tennis player and coach. He was ranked as the world No. 1 in men&#x27;s singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). Moyá won 20 ATP Tour-level singles titles, including the 1998 French Open, and was part of the victorious Spanish Davis Cup team in 2004. He was also the runner-up at the 1997 Australian Open. After his playing career, Moyá served as Rafael Nadal&#x27;s primary coach from 2016 to 2024.

==Tennis career==
In November 1995, at the age of 19, Moyá won his first tournament at the top-level in Buenos Aires, defeating Félix Mantilla in the final. In May 1996, Moyá defeated the clay-court champion Thomas Muster, in the semifinals of the tournament in Munich, ending Muster&#x27;s streak of winning 38 matches in a row on clay-courts. It was the fourth time in four weeks that Moyá had played a match against Muster. In the final of Munich, Sláva Doseděl defeated Moyá.

In 1997, Moyá reached his first Grand Slam final at the Australian Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the first round of the tournament, Jonas Björkman in the fourth round, and world No. 3 Michael Chang in the semifinals, in straight sets, before losing in straight sets to Pete Sampras. Before the US Open, he won brilliantly in Long Island. His opponent in the final was the future winner of US Open a few days later, the Australian Patrick Rafter. Moyá lost due to an injury in the first round of the US Open.

In 1998, Moyá won the French Open. He defeated Sébastien Grosjean, Pepe Imaz, Andrew Ilie and Jens Knippschild before beating the tournament favourite, Marcelo Ríos in the quarterfinal. He then defeated Félix Mantilla Botella in the semifinal and fellow-Spaniard Álex Corretja in the final with a straight-sets win. He also won his first Tennis Masters Series tournament that year at Monte Carlo. He reached the semifinals of the US Open, losing to Mark Philippoussis. He concluded the year by finishing runner-up at the ATP World Championships (now known as the ATP World Tour Finals), where he lost in a five-set final to Corretja, having won the first two sets.

In March 1999, after finishing runner-up at Indian Wells, Moyá reached the world No. 1 singles ranking, the first Spanish player in history to achieve this feat. He held the top spot for two weeks. Later that year, he entered the French Open as defending champion and lost in the fourth round to eventual winner Andre Agassi. At the US Open, Moyá withdrew in the second round with a back injury and only played in two tournaments for the rest of the year.

Despite being hampered with a stress fracture in his lower back from the 1999 US Open through the early part of 2000, Moyá still finished in the top 50 in the world for the fifth straight year. He reached the fourth round of the US Open, where he held a match point in the fourth set, but eventually lost to Todd Martin in five sets, 7–6, 7–6, 1–6, 6–7, 2–6. Moyá&#x27;s best result for the rest of 2000 was winning at the Portugal Open final over his countryman Francisco Clavet.

In 2001, Moyá won the title at Umag. He also finished runner-up at Barcelona, where he lost in a four-hour marathon final to countryman Juan Carlos Ferrero.

2002 saw Moyá win four titles from six finals. He captured his second career Tennis Masters Series title, and the biggest hard-court title of his career, at Cincinnati, where he defeated world No. 1, Lleyton Hewitt, in the final.

Moyá captured three clay-court titles in 2003. He also helped Spain reach the final of the Davis Cup, compiling a 6–0 singles record. In the semifinals, he won the deciding rubber against Gastón Gaudio as Spain beat Argentina, 3–2. He beat Mark Philippoussis on grass in the final. But that proved to be Spain&#x27;s only point, as they lost the final 1–4 to Australia.

In 2004, Moyá helped Spain go one better and win the Davis Cup. In the final, he won two critical singles rubbers against Andy Roddick and Mardy Fish, as Spain beat the United States 3–2. The year also saw Moyà capture his third career Masters Series title at Rome, where he defeated David Nalbandian in the final. He was the only player on the tour to win at least 20 matches on both clay courts and hardcourts that year.

In July 2004, Moyá&#x27;s kind-hearted gesture to hit with ball boy Sandeep Ponniah at the 2004 Tennis Masters Series Toronto event captured audiences during an injury timeout against opponent Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. To the crowd&#x27;s surprise, Ponniah shuffled Moyá across the baseline and received an ovation for an overhead smash on a Moyá lob.

Moyá won his 18th career title in January 2005 at Chennai. He donated his prize money for the win to the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake and Tsunami victims.

In January 2007, Moyá was the runner-up at the Sydney International, losing to defending champion James Blake.

In May 2007, at the Hamburg Masters, he defeated Mardy Fish, world No. 12 Tomáš Berdych, world No. 9 Blake, and world No. 6 Novak Djokovic, a run which saw him reach his first Masters semifinal since 2004 Indian Wells, where he lost to Roger Federer.

Moyá lost against Rafael Nadal in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the 2007 French Open.

During Wimbledon, Moyá lost in the first round to Tim Henman in a five-set thriller, the fifth set stretching to 24 games (Henman won 13–11). Despite the loss, Moyá had no points to defend (he had not played a grass-court match in a few years), resulting in his moving to world No. 20, his first time inside the top 20 since 13 June 2005.

In July 2007, Moyá won the Croatia Open in Umag, defeating Andrei Pavel. The win brought him to world No. 18 in the rankings, his highest rank since 23 May 2005, when he was world No. 15. In 2007 at Cincinnati, he reached the quarter-finals, where he lost to Lleyton Hewitt.

In 2008 at the Cincinnati Masters, Moyá defeated Nikolay Davydenko, the match being played over the course of two days because of rain. Hours after his match with Davydenko, Moyá beat Igor Andreev.

Moyá made a slow start in 2009. He failed to progress beyond the second round of his first four tournaments, including a first-round loss at the Australian Open. In March 2009, he announced that he would have an indefinite hiatus from tennis to recover from injured tendons and ischium in his hip. He returned to professional tennis in January 2010, losing against Janko Tipsarević in the first round of the Chennai Open, then losing in the first round of the 2010 Australian Open to Illya Marchenko.

On 17 November 2010, he announced his retirement from tennis owing to a long-standing foot injury from which he failed to recover. He received a special ceremony at the O2 Arena in London during the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals, with all top eight singles and doubles players attending. Other players who attended included Fernando Verdasco, Mikhail Youzhny, Àlex Corretja, Jonas Björkman, and Thomas Johansson.

He has won ATP Tour singles titles in eleven countries: Argentina, Croatia, France, Italy, India, Mexico, Monaco, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United States.

<text>The Hollywood Heritage Museum, also known as the &quot;Hollywood Studio Museum,&quot; is located on Highland Ave. in Hollywood, California, United States.

The museum is opposite the Hollywood Bowl and is housed in the restored Lasky-DeMille Barn, which was acquired in February 1983 by Hollywood Heritage, Inc., and moved to its present site. It was dedicated on December 13, 1985.

Hollywood Heritage was founded in 1980 to address the preservation, restoration and maintenance of early Hollywood treasures. The first major success was acquiring, moving, and restoring the Lasky-DeMille Barn, opening it in 1985 as its museum. The museum features archival photographs from the silent era of motion pictures, movie props, historic documents and other movie related memorabilia. Also featured are historic photographs and postcards of the streets, buildings and residences of Hollywood during its golden age. Special events entitled &#x27;Evenings at the Barn&#x27; are open to the public and regularly programmed including speakers, screenings and/or slideshows with a focus toward Hollywood&#x27;s early history. Occasionally, historic silent films are screened in cooperation with the Silent Society.

==Building history==

The building which houses the Hollywood Heritage Museum (Lasky-DeMille Barn; known from 1985 to 2003 as The Hollywood Studio Museum) was built in 1901 as a stable by the landowner, Col. Robert Northam, whose estate extended to both sides of Vine Street, the East side beginning at Selma and extending down to Sunset. A few other individually owned parcels were also contained within the eastern block. Col. Northam&#x27;s home was on the West side, where the Hollywood Plaza Hotel is currently located. Col. Northam sold the property in 1903 to Jacob Stern, a realtor interested in the then-booming Hollywood real estate market. Hollywood became a city that year and the prohibitionist sentiments of the populace also made it illegal to show movies in Hollywood. Hollywood merged with the City of Los Angeles in 1910, and in October 1911, the first movie studio was located in the former Blondeau Tavern at Sunset Blvd. and Gower St. The Stern barn became the 2nd studio following the establishment of the Burns and Revier Company in May 1912. Louis Loss Burns (founder of Western Costume Company) and Harry Revier rented the barn from Mr. Stern sometime before May 1912, as a building permit to create an office within the barn was issued in May 1912. The Burns and Revier had the advantage of having a film laboratory on the lot; it was renamed the Burns and Revier Studio and Laboratory. The barn structure was used for dressing rooms and editing rooms, while the office served the heads of the company.

In December 1913, Cecil B. DeMille, as a partner in the newly formed Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, which consisted of Lasky, DeMille and Lasky&#x27;s brother-in-law, Samuel Goldfish (before name change to Samuel Goldwyn), traveled to California and met with Burns and Revier at the Alexandria Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. They drove DeMille to the studio and on December 22, a lease agreement between the three parties was executed on Hotel Alexandria stationery, followed by a second agreement between Stern and DeMille allowing them to sublease the Burns and Revier Studio. They leased the barn and studio facilities for $250.00 a month and began production of &quot;The Squaw Man&quot; (February 14, 1914), the first feature film to be produced in the Hollywood area. At the same time, DeMille bought out the interests of Burns and Revier and entered into lease extensions with Stern.

In 1916, the Lasky Company merged with Adolph Zukor&#x27;s Famous Players to become The Famous Players - Lasky Corporation, and in 1917 merged with Paramount Distributing Company and would in time, become Paramount Pictures Corporation. In 1926, the company moved from the two square city block lot that had grown from the small barn, to a larger site composed of the former Brunton, Peralta, and United Studios on Melrose Ave., where Paramount Studio remains. The sentimental founders moved the barn to the new lot with them; it went through several uses as a film set, research library, conference area and later the Paramount gymnasium (1929). It remained as the gym until 1979. It was moved to a couple of different locations on the Paramount lot, its last location being adjacent to Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s office and becoming an integral part of Paramount&#x27;s Western Street backlot. The barn is visible in a number of movies including &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; and in series such as &quot;Bonanza.&quot;

In a ceremony attended by its founders, the Lasky-DeMille Barn was dedicated on December 27, 1956, as &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s First Major Film Company Studio&quot; and designated California State Historic Landmark No. 554, representing the birth of the Hollywood motion picture industry and becoming the first landmark associated with it.

==Path to museum==
In 1979 Paramount donated the building to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce&#x27;s Hollywood Historic Trust and it was moved to a parking lot on the West side of Vine Street.

Hollywood Heritage, Inc., a California State non-profit, was founded in 1980 by Marian Gibbons, Christy Johnson McAvoy, Frances Offenhauser McKeal, and Susan Peterson St. Francis. The organization&#x27;s goal is the preservation, restoration and maintenance of early Hollywood treasures.

The building remained in the Vine Street parking lot until the Chamber and Paramount donated it to Hollywood Heritage. The Chamber moved it to the parking lot of The Hollywood Palace theater, where it was boarded up and fenced in until a permanent site could be found.

Hollywood Heritage learned of land on Highland Ave. that had been designated in 1960 for a film museum; the museum had not been built, but it had received a good deal of publicity due to a former marine who resisted vacating his home until such time as budgeted and approved plans for an actual museum had been put in place. Hollywood Heritage merged their efforts with the 1960 plan, moving the Lasky-DeMille Barn to the designated Highland Ave. site in February 1982; the following three years were spent in restoring the building with donated goods and services and with volunteer labor. The building was officially opened in December 1985, on the 72nd anniversary of the various contracts and agreements between the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company, the Burns and Revier Company, and Stern.

It was closed from 1997 to 2003 due to a fire, which although damaging a small portion of the building, did not damage any part of the museum&#x27;s permanent collection.

==California Historical Landmark Marker==
The Lasky-DeMille Barn, already a California State Historic Landmark (see above), was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013, 100 years after the arrival of Lasky and DeMille.

California Historical Landmark Marker NO. 554 the site reads:
*&quot;NO. 554 CECIL B. DeMILLE STUDIO BARN - Cecil B. DeMille rented half of this structure, then used as a barn, as the studio in which was made the first feature-length motion picture in Hollywood-The Squaw Man-in 1913. Associated with Mr. DeMille in making The Squaw Man were Samuel Goldwyn and Jesse Lasky, Sr. Originally located at the corner of Selma and Vine Streets, in 1927 the barn was transferred to Paramount Studios.&quot;

<doc id="669440" wikidata="Q4493388" url="?curid=669440" title="Fundamental class">
<text>In mathematics, the fundamental class is a homology class [&quot;M&quot;] associated to a connected orientable compact manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot;, which corresponds to the generator of the homology group formula_1 . The fundamental class can be thought of as the orientation of the top-dimensional simplices of a suitable triangulation of the manifold.

==Definition==
===Closed, orientable===
When &quot;M&quot; is a connected orientable closed manifold of dimension &quot;n&quot;, the top homology group is infinite cyclic: formula_2, and an orientation is a choice of generator, a choice of isomorphism formula_3. The generator is called the fundamental class.

If &quot;M&quot; is disconnected (but still orientable), a fundamental class is the direct sum of the fundamental classes for each connected component (corresponding to an orientation for each component).

In relation with de Rham cohomology it represents &quot;integration over M&quot;; namely for &quot;M&quot; a smooth manifold, an &quot;n&quot;-form ω can be paired with the fundamental class as

:formula_4

which is the integral of ω over &quot;M&quot;, and depends only on the cohomology class of ω.

=== Stiefel-Whitney class ===
If &quot;M&quot; is not orientable, formula_5, and so one cannot define a fundamental class &quot;M&quot; living inside the integers. However, every closed manifold is formula_6-orientable, and 
formula_7 (for &quot;M&quot; connected). Thus, every closed manifold is formula_6-oriented (not just orient&quot;able&quot;: there is no ambiguity in choice of orientation), and has a formula_6-fundamental class.

This formula_6-fundamental class is used in defining Stiefel–Whitney class.

===With boundary===
If &quot;M&quot; is a compact orientable manifold with boundary, then the top relative homology group is again infinite cyclic formula_11, and so the notion of the fundamental class can be extended to the manifold with boundary case.

==Poincaré duality==
The Poincaré duality theorem relates the homology and cohomology groups of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional oriented closed manifolds: if &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring and &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional &quot;R&quot;-orientable closed manifold with fundamental class &quot;[M]&quot;, then for all &quot;k&quot;, the map 
: formula_12
given by 
: formula_13
is an isomorphism.

Using the notion of fundamental class for manifolds with boundary, we can extend Poincaré duality to that case too (see Lefschetz duality). In fact, the cap product with a fundamental class gives a stronger duality result saying that we have isomorphisms formula_14, assuming we have that formula_15 are formula_16-dimensional manifolds with formula_17 and formula_18.

See also Twisted Poincaré duality

==Applications==

In the Bruhat decomposition of the flag variety of a Lie group, the fundamental class corresponds to the top-dimension Schubert cell, or equivalently the longest element of a Coxeter group.

<doc id="669445" wikidata="Q1475619" url="?curid=669445" title="Type 26 frigate">
<text>The Type 26 frigate, also known as City-class frigate, is a class of frigates and destroyers being built for the United Kingdom&#x27;s Royal Navy, with variants also being built for the Australian and Canadian navies. The programme, known as the Global Combat Ship, was launched by the British Ministry of Defence to partially replace the navy&#x27;s thirteen Type 23 frigates, and for export. Its primary role is to conduct advanced anti-submarine warfare missions while supporting air defence and general purpose operations. The type is the first naval platform shared between Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom since the pre-Second World War Tribal-class destroyer.

The programme began in 1998, under what was then known as the Future Surface Combatant (FSC). By March 2010 however, this procurement programme had evolved to become the Global Combat Ship, following the announcement of a four-year, £127 million design contract being awarded to BAE Systems Maritime – Naval Ships. The primary development phase started on 1 April 2015 and in August 2015, the first long lead time items for Type 26 were ordered, with manufacturing then expected to begin in 2016 and the first Type 26 to be delivered in 2023. Subsequently, the commissioning date for the first ship of the class slipped to late 2026, with initial operating capability now anticipated from 2028. The frigates will be built at BAE Systems&#x27; Govan and Scotstoun yards on the River Clyde in Glasgow.
The contract award to manufacture the Type 26 was announced by BAE Systems on 2 July 2017, with steel cut for the first of class, HMS &quot;Glasgow&quot; on 20 July 2017.

In June 2018, the Australian Government announced that it had selected a modified version of the Type 26 platform as the planned replacement for its . The Royal Australian Navy will procure six s which will be constructed by BAE Systems Australia at ASC&#x27;s shipyard in Osborne, South Australia.

On 8 February 2019, the Canadian government awarded Lockheed Martin Canada a C$185 million contract to design a fleet of up to 15 warships based on the Type 26 (the Canadian Surface Combatant), with a total program cost of $60 billion. The amount of the contract will increase as the design work increases. The initial design contract is with Irving Shipbuilding of Halifax, Nova Scotia.

==Development==
===Future Surface Combatant===
The Global Combat Ship started development under the original Future Surface Combatant (FSC) programme intended to replace the Royal Navy&#x27;s Type 22 and Type 23 frigates. Planning for a replacement escort vessel started in 1998 with the ordering of a research vessel, , to study whether a trimaran design was practical for such a large and complex vessel. More conventional designs however, were ultimately preferred. In March 2005, plans were released for a two-class solution, a cheaper &quot;Medium Sized Vessel Derivative&quot; entering service in 2016–19 and a more capable &quot;Versatile Surface Combatant&quot; entering service around 2023.

In early 2006 the MoD started a Sustained Surface Combatant Capability (S2C2) programme which explored synergies between the FSC and other needs, for minesweepers, patrol ships and survey ships. By early 2007 this had crystallised into the three requirements; C1, C2 and C3. The C1 was to be an anti-submarine warfare task group-enabled platform and would displace around 6,000 tonnes. C2 was to be a more general purpose platform displacing somewhere in the region of 4–5,000 tonnes, and C3 was to be a Global Corvette to replace a larger number of smaller vessels in service, such as minesweepers, patrol and survey ships. The Global Corvette was to displace around 2–3,000 tonnes.

The C3 concept began in early 2004 when the MoD issued a Request for Information (RFI) for a smaller class of ship known as the Global Corvette. Low running costs and the ability to operate forward in shallow, coastal areas where larger ships cannot were both important. BAE Systems, VT Group, Thales and Rolls-Royce responded in the autumn of 2004 with concepts ranging from a well-equipped Offshore Patrol Vessel (OPV) of 1,500 tonnes to an advanced and very capable &quot;corvette&quot; of 3,000 tonnes, along the lines of the USN&#x27;s Littoral Combat Ship programme (LCS).

The FSC concept was brought forward in the 2008 budget, at the expense of options for two Type 45 destroyers not being taken up (ships 7 and 8). In 2009 BAE Systems received a contract to design the C1 and C2 frigates with a planned 25-year life. A total of 18 vessels (10 C1 and 8 C2) were planned to enter service from 2020, at a pace of roughly one per year. In early 2010 the C3 variant was dropped in favour of the Mine Countermeasures, Hydrography and Patrol Capability (MHPC) programme.

===Global Combat Ship===
Official mention of the Future Surface Combatant had all but disappeared by 2010, and on 25 March of that year, BAE Systems were given a four-year, £127 million contract by the Ministry of Defence to fully design a new class of warship, the &quot;Global Combat Ship&quot;, previously C1 of the FSC. Expectations at the time were for the first ship to be &quot;in service&quot; by 2021. The October 2010 Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) reaffirmed the government&#x27;s commitment to the Global Combat Ship, saying; &quot;As soon as possible after 2020 the Type 23 will be replaced by Type 26 frigates, designed to be easily adapted to change roles and capabilities depending on the strategic circumstances&quot;. As part of the defence review it was also announced that the remaining Type 22 frigates would be decommissioned without replacement, reducing the Royal Navy&#x27;s escort fleet from 23 destroyers and frigates to 19 (6 Type 45 destroyers and 13 Type 23 frigates).

BAE Systems&#x27; original working baseline for the Global Combat Ship design was a vessel 141 metres long with a displacement of 6,850 tonnes and a range of 7,000 nautical miles at 18 knots. On 30 November 2010 however, it was reported that the specifications had been pared down, in effort to reduce the cost from £500M to £250–350M per ship. Subsequently, new specification details began to emerge of a smaller 5,400 tonne ship emphasising flexibility and modularity.

Unlike the FSC, the Global Combat Ship has only one hull design. Like the Franco-Italian family of FREMM multipurpose frigates however, three versions are proposed for export: a design optimised for anti-submarine warfare (ASW), an anti-aircraft warfare (AAW) variant and a general purpose (GP) variant.

Although a decision was made in November 2010 to reduce the specifications and capability requirements of the Global Combat Ship design, BAE Systems&#x27; design concepts by 2014 had returned to their original working baseline of a large 6,900 tonne warship. In February 2015, the MoD and BAE Systems signed a £859 million contract to continue development and progress towards manufacturing. A 12-month demonstration phase began on 1 April 2015 and, after a 12-month extension in March 2016, was scheduled to be completed in June 2017.

Primarily due to the costs of the ship, the 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review reduced the planned procurement of Type 26 vessels from 13 ships to 8. The resulting gap would now be filled by a new class of cheaper frigate designated Type 31.

On 2 July 2017, BAE Systems announced it had been awarded a £3.7 billion contract by the UK MoD to manufacture the first three Type 26 ships. The statement said that steel would be cut for the first ship in Glasgow &quot;in the coming weeks.&quot;
In September 2015, the programme cost was estimated at £11.5 billion, for what was then assumed to be for 13 Global Combat Ships. The cost for the current eight ships was quoted as £8 billion in 2016. Three ships were ordered in 2017 for £3.7 billion.
In July 2021 it was revealed in response to a Parliamentary question that it was intended that the Type 26 frigate would be equipped with a new Future Cruise/Anti-ship Weapon from 2028.

==Partnerships==
The Global Combat Ship has been designed from the outset with export in mind. During a House of Commons debate on 31 January 2011, it was revealed that Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Turkey had all expressed interest in collaborating on the Global Combat Ship.

===Australia===

The governments of the United Kingdom and Australia had previously been exploring the potential for cooperation on the C1 and C3 designs of the Future Surface Combatant, which corresponded closely to the Royal Australian Navy&#x27;s requirements in replacing its s with a new class of frigate. The two countries signed a defence cooperation treaty in January 2013 and Australia pledged cooperation on the Global Combat Ship design in order to investigate its suitability for their own procurement programme. In April 2016, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull confirmed that the Global Combat Ship was one of three designs shortlisted for the replacement of the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates.

In September 2016 the Australian government awarded BAE Systems a contract to further refine the design of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship for the Royal Australian Navy under the SEA 5000 (Future Frigate) programme. Australia issued a request for tenders (RFT) in support of the programme in late March 2017. The programme is valued at AUD35 billion (US$26.25 billion). On 10 August 2017 BAE Systems announced it had submitted its bid for the SEA 5000 programme. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced in June 2018 that BAE had won the contract and Australia would build nine units of a modified version of the Type 26 concept vessel in Adelaide.

On 20 February 2024 the Australian government announced the &quot;Hunter&quot; class order will be reduced from nine to six ships. Another class of 11 new general-purpose frigates would be selected to serve alongside the &quot;Hunter&quot; class.

===Canada===
During the House of Commons debate of 31 January 2011, it was also disclosed that the Canadian government was interested in collaborating on the Global Combat Ship and that the UK and Canada were in &quot;close discussion&quot;. However, a Canadian union campaigned that the Global Combat Ship threatened Canadian shipbuilders, and in the run-up to the May 2011 election a spokesman for Peter MacKay, at the time Canadian Defence Minister, ruled out involvement with the British programme. Turkey also later rejected the design in 2012 as not meeting its requirements.

Although Canada had previously ruled out partnership with the British programme, in May 2016 IHS Janes reported that the Global Combat Ship was still one of the contenders for the Canadian Surface Combatant requirement. Indeed, in November 2017, a Lockheed Martin-led consortium put forward their &quot;CSC Proposal&quot;, based on the Type 26 design by BAE Systems, for the Royal Canadian Navy&#x27;s future frigate project.

On 19 October 2018 it was announced that BAE-Lockheed Martin was selected as the &#x27;preferred&#x27; bidder in the Canadian Surface Combatant programme and that the Canadian government would begin negotiations to award a contract for 15 ships worth CAD$60 billion with BAE and Lockheed Martin Canada, the primary contractors. The preferred bid beat out offers from Alion Science and Technology and their proposal based on the Dutch &quot;De Zeven Provinciën&quot; air defence and command (LCF) frigate and Navantia/Saab/CEA Technologies with their proposal based on the Spanish Navy F-105 frigate.

On 21 November 2018 Alion Science and Technology asked the Federal Court for a judicial review of the decision, claiming the winning bid was &quot;incapable of meeting three critical mandatory requirements&quot; of the design tender, including the mandatory speed requirements set by the Royal Canadian Navy.

On 27 November 2018, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal (CITT) ordered the Government to postpone the finalising of the deal to purchase the ships, while the complaint from Alion was investigated. On 11 December 2018, the CITT gave the government a green light to proceed with the Lockheed contract, but its inquiry into the compliance of the Type 26 with Canada&#x27;s requirements continued. The Tribunal dismissed the case entirely in February 2019.

The Canadian Surface Combatant design contract was signed on 7 February 2019 by the Liberal government. The design contract with Irving and the Lockheed Martin-BAE consortium was negotiated in near record time, taking only three months.

On 28 June 2024, the construction of production test modules for the first three ships began, with the new ships designated as the River class; the names of the first three ships were also announced as HMCS &quot;Fraser&quot;, HMCS &quot;Saint-Laurent&quot; and HMCS &quot;Mackenzie&quot;. The ships were to be rated as &quot;destroyers&quot; in the RCN. Full rate production was expected to begin in 2025 with the first ship planned for service entry in the early 2030s.

==Possible partnerships==

===Brazil===
In September 2010, the British and Brazilian governments reached a defence agreement, including the potential sale of five or six Global Combat Ships to the Brazilian Navy. The following month, BAE Systems formally made a detailed proposal to the Brazilian Navy, for a package including the Global Combat Ship as well as variants of the Wave-class tanker and River-class patrol vessel.

===Norway===
On 15 April 2024, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Norway, which had a plan to purchase at least five frigates, was a potential customer for the Type 26 frigate. However, as Norway was reportedly seeking at least one frigate by 2029, the article stated that this would require the Royal Navy to sell one of its early-stage hulls, as BAE is committed to deliver the Type 26 to the UK first. The MoD confirmed that it was involved in discussions about the issue but that no decisions had been made.

==Characteristics==
The Global Combat Ship is designed with modularity and flexibility in mind to enhance versatility across the full range of operations, including maritime security, counter-piracy, counter-terrorist and humanitarian and disaster relief operations. The adaptable design will facilitate through-life support, ensuring upgrades can easily be undertaken as technology develops.
, BAE Systems&#x27; website suggests a displacement of 6,900 tonnes, a length of a beam of and a top speed in excess of . The Global Combat Ship will have a core crew of 157 with room for a total of 208.

The Global Combat Ship is designed for up to 60 days&#x27; endurance and a range of approximately . Located at the stern are facilities allowing for the deployment of rigid-hulled inflatable boats, unmanned surface vehicles or a towed array sonar. A large Integrated Mission Bay and hangar is located amidship, enabling a variety of missions and associated equipment. Aircraft similar in size to the Boeing Chinook can be flown off the large flight deck, and the hangar can accommodate up to two helicopters the size of an AgustaWestland AW159 Wildcat or AgustaWestland Merlin. The hangar also has space to accommodate unmanned aerial vehicles.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s version of the Global Combat Ship is referred to as the Type 26 frigate. This will be equipped with the Type 997 Artisan 3D search radar and Sea Ceptor (CAMM) air-defence missiles launched via 48 vertical launching system (VLS) canisters. Following a renovation of the Royal Navy&#x27;s website in mid-2023 the section outlining the Type 26&#x27;s weapon suite refers to Sea Ceptor being quad-packed into a separate 12-cell vertical launch system, seemingly indicate of an Extensible Launching System (ExLS) outfit for the same number of missiles, however there has been no official information outside of the website to confirm any such change. Additionally, 24 Mark 41 &quot;strike-length VLS&quot; cells are positioned forward of the bridge. On 8 July 2021, it was confirmed that the Anglo-French-Italian Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapon(s) would be brought into service on the Type 26, which is likely to be launched from the Mark 41 VLS. The Mark 41 is also capable of firing missiles such as the Tomahawk land-attack cruise missile, anti-submarine rockets, or quad-packed ESSMs.

Like the Type 23 frigate it will replace, the Global Combat Ship will have an acoustically quiet hull for anti-submarine warfare and fitted with an Ultra Electronics Type 2150 next-generation bow sonar and a powerful Sonar 2087 towed array. The Global Combat Ship will also be fitted with guns of various calibres. Instead of the RN&#x27;s current 4.5-inch Mark 8 naval gun, the Global Combat Ship will be equipped with a NATO-standard BAE 5-inch, 62-calibre Mark 45 naval gun. Smaller guns include two Phalanx CIWS, two 30mm DS30M Mark 2 Automated Small Calibre Guns and a number of miniguns and general-purpose machine guns. On 26 March 2024, it was announced that Sea Gnat fixed decoy launching system would be replaced across the entire Royal Navy&#x27;s escort fleet with SEA&#x27;s Ancilia trainable decoy launcher including on the Type 26 following a £135 million contract. A pair of launchers will be mounted to the deck and will each provide twelve ready rounds of Infrared seduction decoys and radio frequency distraction decoys to defeat missile threats and possibly the ability to launch Martlet missiles in the future.

The propulsion system of the RN ships will have a gas turbine direct drive and four high speed diesel generators driving two electric motors in a combined diesel-electric or gas (CODLOG) configuration. In 2012 Rolls-Royce repackaged the MT30 used in the s so that it would fit into smaller ships. The MT30 will be used in the Type 26. BAE Systems has suggested that some customers will install gas turbine engines and others will prefer to sacrifice 2–3 knots of speed by choosing cheaper diesel engines. The CODLOG configuration for propulsion is a simpler version of the Combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion used on the Type 23 which this ship is to replace, and both of the Global Combat Ship&#x27;s design contemporaries – the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class aircraft carrier and the Type 45 destroyer – use integrated electric propulsion (IEP).

== Construction ==
The first steel for the first three of eight Royal Navy ships was cut on 20 July 2017. BAE Systems announced the award of the Type 26&#x27;s first seven equipment manufacturing contracts in July 2015, these worth in excess of £170 million. Contracts were awarded to Babcock International for the ship&#x27;s air weapons handling system; David Brown Gear Systems Ltd for the propulsion gearbox and the test facility; GE Power Conversion for the electric propulsion motor and drive system and testing facility; Raytheon Anschütz for the integrated navigation and bridge system including customer-specific design and development, a land-based integration facility, and a wide range of services; Rolls-Royce Power Engineering for the gas turbine; Rohde &amp; Schwarz UK Ltd for the communications systems; WR Davis of Canada for the uptakes and downtakes of the ship&#x27;s funnel and exhaust system.

In December 2016, BAE Systems announced the award of six additional Type 26 equipment manufacturing contracts with Detegase of Spain for sewage and water treatment, Salt Separation Services for desalination equipment, Johnson Controls for chilled water plants, Marine Systems Technology Ltd for gas-, weather-, and water-tight doors, hatches, and Rolls-Royce for stabilisers and steering components. Also awarded a contract was Pellegrini Marine Equipments of Italy. These awards brought to £380 million the total investment in the supply chain for the Type 26.

According to Gary McCloskey, head of Type 26 supply chain at BAE Systems, by March 2017 between 40 and 50 suppliers were engaged in the Type 26 programme, and about 33 had full contracts.

On 5 April 2017 Raytheon Anschütz announced successful integration of Warship Electronic Chart Display Information System (WECDIS) into their Integrated Navigation and Bridge Systems (INBS) for the Type 26.

In July 2017 BAE Systems stated that the Type 26 programme currently employs more than 1,200 people in the UK supply chain, and in the future, the programme would secure more than 3,400 jobs across BAE Systems and the wider UK maritime supply chain. It was also stated in July 2017, coinciding with the announcement of additional contracts, total investment in the Type 26 supply chain had reached £500 million. The 14 companies awarded contracts in the July announcement include Babcock for the helicopter landing grid, MSI Defence Systems for the small calibre gun, and Thales for the towed array system. The largest of the July-announced contracts are for the procurement of structural steel for the first three ships from UK and European steel mills by Dent Steel Services Ltd.

==Ships of the class==

The original planning assumption for the Royal Navy was for thirteen Global Combat Ships (eight ASW and five GP), replacing the Type 23 frigate fleet like-for-like. As a result of the November 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review however, it was decided that only the eight anti-submarine warfare Type 26 frigates would be ordered. The funding for the remaining five general purpose Type 26 frigates is instead to be spent on developing a new class of lighter and more affordable general purpose frigates (GPFF).

Due to an expected lower cost, the government suggested it may allow an eventual increase in the total number of frigates in the Royal Navy. This general purpose frigate will be designated as the Type 31 frigate. In July 2016, BAE revealed two general purpose frigate designs to meet the requirement; the Avenger class and the Cutlass class. On 12 September 2019 it was announced that Babcock&#x27;s Arrowhead 140 design, based on the Danish , had been selected for the Type 31 frigate program.

===Naming the ships===
====Royal Navy====
During 2014, a campaign emerged to name one of the ships , although Royal Navy ship names are formed via the Ships&#x27; Names and Badges Committee. In July 2017, construction of the first ship began in Govan; at the same time as work on the ship was started, it was announced that it would be named . The second named unit (although planned as the third ship of Batch 1) was announced as HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; in September 2017. The Second World War era light cruiser , a museum ship, will be named &quot;HMS &quot;Belfast&quot; (1938)&quot; by the Imperial War Museum to avoid &quot;any possibility of confusion&quot;.

In March 2018 the First Sea Lord, Admiral Philip Jones, announced that the second ship of the class would be . In September 2018 it was announced that the first of the planned five Batch 2 ships would be . In November 2018, subsequent Batch 2 ships were announced as HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot;, , and . Of the eight names, six were previously used as names of Type 42 destroyers, while the previous HMS &quot;London&quot; was a Type 22 frigate. HMS &quot;Sheffield&quot; was previously used on both a Type 22 frigate and a Type 42 destroyer before that. An order for the final five ships in the class was formally placed in November 2022.

====Royal Australian Navy====
In June 2018, on the announcement that the Type 26 had been selected as the basis for the Future Frigate programme of the Royal Australian Navy, it was also announced that they would be known as the &quot;Hunter&quot;-class, with the names of the first three given as HMAS &quot;Hunter&quot;, HMAS &quot;Flinders&quot; and HMAS &quot;Tasman&quot;. All three were named for seafarers that had played a significant role in the early history of modern Australia - John Hunter was an officer of the Royal Navy who, between 1795 and 1800, served as the second Governor of New South Wales; Matthew Flinders was a cartographer who undertook the first inshore circumnavigation and survey of the Australian continent between 1802 and 1803; and Abel Tasman was a Dutch explorer who discovered the island that came to be called Tasmania in 1642. Of the first three, only &quot;Flinders&quot; has been used previously in the RAN, having been used as the name of a survey ship in service between 1973 and 1998.

====Royal Canadian Navy====
In June 2024, the announcement of the order being placed for the first three ships of the Canadian Surface Combatant programme also saw them being named as River class (with the Canadian ships being classed as destroyers rather than frigates). The names of the three individual ships was also announced, with each being named for a Canadian river. All three had previously been used as the names of ships from a series of destroyer escorts in service with the Royal Canadian Navy from the 1950s to the 1990s. HMCS &quot;Fraser&quot; and HMCS &quot;Saint-Laurent&quot; are named for members of the , a class of ASW destroyers commissioned in the mid to late 1950s. HMCS &quot;Mackenzie&quot; is named for the lead ship of the , a type of destroyer used for general purpose and training duties.

<text>The 1957 and 1958 Packard lineup of automobiles were based on Studebaker models: restyled, rebadged, and given more luxurious interiors. After 1956 production, the Packard engine and transmission factory was leased to the Curtiss-Wright Corporation while the assembly plant on Detroit&#x27;s East Grand Boulevard was sold, ending the line of Packard-built cars. However, Studebaker-Packard executives hoped to keep the Packard name alive until a fully restyled model could be funded, developed, and produced. These cars were built in hopes that enough would be sold to enable the company to design and build a completely new luxury Packard.

==1957 Packard Clipper==
For the 1957 model year, Studebaker-Packard took its top-of-the-line model, the President, and added a revised front clip with new fenders and hoods while using the 56 Packard Front Bumper. The Packard Clipper emblem was used in the grill to replicate the styling of the 56 Clipper. The designers also changed the quarter panels to accept 1956 Packard taillights. along with a Packard dash gauges from the 1956 to make a new dash board for the Packard. and called the car the Packard Clipper. Two models were produced in 1957, a four-door Town Sedan and a station wagon Clipper Country Sedan.

Carryover parts from earlier Packard models included taillights, wheel covers, block letters on hood, instruments and radios. The headlight &#x27;eyebrows&#x27; and front bumper assembly were styled for a Packard appearance. A 1955 hood ornament was modified to fit the Studebaker hood shape and the long, wide side trim was designed to be reminiscent of recent Packard trim. A stamped overlay for the lower rear fenders also gave them a body crease line suggestive of the side trim of the 1956 Caribbean.

Dashboard and interior were all Packard styled. Some former president features like the rear folding seat armrest and faired-in door armrests were reserved for the Clippers, with the addition of door mounted ashtrays, thick pile carpeting, and exclusive Packard-style cloth/vinyl fabrics. Other unique features included under-dash courtesy lights, fully padded dash top (that did not hold up well long term in the sun), padded sun visors, and gold-plated horn ring.

When Packard dealers saw the resulting car at regional previews, the response was quick, angry, and loud. Many dealers felt the Clipper was too similar to the Studebaker on which it was based and dropped Packard completely. Sales were a low 4,809, almost all of which were the Town Sedan. Critics bestowed the derisive name &quot;Packardbaker&quot; on the cars.

In order to produce an engine of appropriate power for a Packard, a McCulloch-supercharged version of Studebaker&#x27;s 289 in3 (4.7 L) small-block V8 was used, giving 275 bhp (205 kW), equivalent to the Packard engines in use the year before (and likewise used in the Studebaker Golden Hawk). Since the Studebaker-bodied cars were quite a bit lighter than the previous year&#x27;s Packards, the 1957 Packard range actually had quite exceptional performance for the time.

Writer and auto historian Richard Langworth has noted that while these cars were not truly Packards, they were, however, very good Studebakers.

==Final Packards==

1958 saw the Packard line expanded to four models; a 4-door sedan, a 2-door hardtop (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Starlight&quot;, a name used by Studebaker), a 4-door station wagon, and the Packard Hawk, a modification of Studebaker&#x27;s Golden Hawk with a &quot;fishmouth&quot; Packard grille.

Restyled by Duncan McRae, Studebaker-Packard&#x27;s finances dictated that the changes for 1958 be made as cheaply as possible. Quad headlights, as on Studebakers, were achieved by affixing pods to the previous year&#x27;s front fenders designed for two headlights. In the rear, McRae attempted to follow the tailfin craze established by Chrysler&#x27;s 1957 &quot;Forward Look&quot; by crafting outward-canted steel fin extensions that were mounted to the tops of the existing vertical rear fenders, they were very reminiscent of the 1957 Dodge Custom Royal in styling. This same trick of adding fins was used by Studebaker on the 1957 Hawks and the Raymond Loewy designed Rootes group cars of 1957. 1956 Clipper taillight units continued to be used. Packards also adopted a low, wide &quot;fishmouth&quot; grille to further distinguish them from their Studebaker cousins. Other notable changes included the hardtops&#x27; astonishingly attractive rooflines, very similar to concurrent Chrysler/Desoto designs. Also, the switch to a one-piece drive shaft allowed Studebaker engineers to flatten the floor, which also allowed flattening of the roof panels on sedan and hardtop models. Packard (and Studebaker) also switched to 14&quot; wheels so most 1958 models are noticeably lower.
Despite McRae&#x27;s efforts, the car that emerged appeared cobbled together, rather than as a cohesive design. Auto reviewer &quot;Uncle&quot; Tom McCahill remarked that from the rear it looked as if the cars had been left in the sun too long and the canted fiberglass fins had started to melt down the straight rear fender sides.

Only 2,034 of the three standard models (sedan, hardtop and station wagon) were produced; an additional 588 Packard Hawks were built as well. The rarest of all &#x27;58 Packards is the station wagon, with only 159 produced. The last Packard rolled off the South Bend assembly line on July 25, 1958.

In 1962 the Studebaker-Packard Corporation officially dropped &quot;Packard&quot; from its name.

==Trivia==

A pink, purple, and gold 1958 Packard estate car is seen in the 2001 film &quot;Hearts in Atlantis&quot;.

<doc id="669466" wikidata="Q3495303" url="?curid=669466" title="St. Roch (ship)">
<text>RCMPV St. Roch is a Royal Canadian Mounted Police schooner, the first ship to completely circumnavigate North America, and the second vessel to transit the Northwest Passage. She was the first ship to complete the Northwest Passage in the west to east direction (Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean), using the same route that Amundsen on the sailing vessel &quot;Gjøa&quot; had traversed east to west, 38 years earlier.

The ship was most often captained by Henry Larsen.

Liverpool-born Sgt. Fred S. Farrar RCMP (1901-1954) was a crew member of &quot;St. Roch&quot; for various voyages including the 1950 voyage that circumnavigated North America; he wrote the book &quot;Arctic Assignment: The Story of the St. Roch&quot; which was published posthumously in 1955.

The Stan Rogers song &quot;Take It From Day To Day&quot; is the lament of a crew member on &quot;St. Roch&quot;.

The ship is located at the Vancouver Maritime Museum in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and is open to the public for scheduled visits.

==Construction==
&quot;St. Roch&quot; was made primarily of thick Douglas fir, with very hard Australian &quot;ironbark&quot; eucalyptus on the outside, and an interior hull reinforced with heavy beams to withstand ice pressure during her Arctic duties. &quot;St. Roch&quot; was designed by Tom Halliday and was based on Roald Amundsen&#x27;s ship &quot;Maud&quot;.

==Service history==
&quot;St. Roch&quot; was constructed in 1928 at the Burrard Dry Dock Shipyards in North Vancouver. Between 1929 and 1939 she supplied and patrolled Canada&#x27;s Arctic.

In 1940–1942 she became the first vessel to complete a voyage through the Northwest Passage in a west to east direction, and in 1944 became the first vessel to make a return trip through the Northwest Passage, traversing the more northerly route considered the true Northwest Passage, and was also the first to navigate the passage in a single season. Between 1944 and 1948 she again patrolled Arctic waters. On May 29, 1950, she became the first vessel to circumnavigate North America, travelling from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Vancouver via the Panama Canal. In all she made three arctic voyages.

==Exhibition==
In 1954, the &quot;St. Roch&quot; was decommissioned in Halifax and returned to Vancouver. In 1958, she was placed in dry dock at Kitsilano Point for restoration, partly inspiring the location of the planned Vancouver Maritime Museum, which opened the following year. In 1962, &quot;St. Roch&quot; was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. Although the ship was placed indoors in an A-frame building adjoining the museum, it remained formally under the control of Parks Canada. In 1995 Parks Canada handed over full control of the &quot;St. Roch&quot; to the museum.

<text>The Academy of Arts () is a state arts institution in Berlin, Germany. The task of the Academy is to promote art, as well as to advise and support the states of Germany.

The academy&#x27;s predecessor organization was founded in 1696 by Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg as the Brandenburg Academy of Arts, an academic institution in which members could meet and discuss and share ideas. The current Academy was founded on 1 October 1993 as the re-unification of formerly separate East and West Berlin academies.

==Membership==
The academy is an incorporated body of the public right under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. New members are nominated by secret ballot of the general assembly, and appointed by the president with membership never to exceed 500.

The academy&#x27;s recent presidents include:
* Adolf Muschg – (2003–2006)
* Klaus Staeck – (2006–2015)
* Jeanine Meerapfel – (2015–2024)
* Manos Tsangaris – (2024–)

==History==

Beginning in the 1690s, the Prussian Academy of Arts, under various names, served as an arts council and learned society for the Prussian government. Founded by the Hohenzollern elector Frederick III (King in Prussia from 1701), it was the third-oldest such academy in Europe. The institution was housed on No. 8 Unter den Linden, until from 1902 the site was cleared and rebuilt as seat of the Berlin State Library. The academy then moved to Pariser Platz next to Hotel Adlon, where the Palais Arnim, former residence of Prime Minister Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg, was refurbished according to plans designed by Ernst von Ihne.

The academy also served as a training school since its founding, and created a number of affiliated schools. The first was the Bauakademie for architectural training, founded in 1799. The academic arm was fully separated in 1931 and developed into the present-day Berlin University of the Arts (&quot;Universität der Künste Berlin&quot;). In 1938 the academy building was seized by Hitler&#x27;s chief architect Albert Speer to evolve his &quot;Welthauptstadt Germania&quot; plans; temporarily relocated to the Kronprinzenpalais, the Prussian Academy ultimately ceased operations in 1945.

In postwar divided Germany, two parallel organizations took its place. The western successor organization was called the &quot;Akademie der Künste&quot;, founded in 1954 under President Hans Scharoun, which resided in the rebuilt Hansaviertel quarter of West Berlin. The eastern successor organization was founded on 24 March 1950 as the &quot;Deutsche Akademie der Künste&quot; in East Berlin, which became the Akademie der Künste der DDR in 1972, then the &quot;Akademie der Künste zu Berlin&quot; in 1990. Its presidents included Arnold Zweig, Ludwig Renn, Johannes R. Becher, Otto Nagel, Willi Bredel, Konrad Wolf, Manfred Wekwerth, and Heiner Müller.

The two were merged on 1 October 1993 into the present-day academy, which took its seat in a new building at the former location on Pariser Platz

==Estates==
The Otto Dix Foundation, created by artist Otto Dix’s widow Martha, entrusted his estate to the academy. It includes 4,000 index cards of his works, around 300 letters to the artist, catalogues and publications that include mention of exhibitions of his work and even his paintbox containing all his equipment. It opened to the public at the academy in 2024.

==Awards and honours==
*Berliner Kunstpreis
*Käthe Kollwitz Prize
*Heinrich Mann Prize
*Konrad Wolf Prize
*Alfred Döblin Prize
*Joana Maria Gorvin Prize
*Will Lammert Prize

<doc id="669475" wikidata="Q1517914" url="?curid=669475" title="Closed manifold">
<text>In mathematics, a closed manifold is a manifold without boundary that is compact.
In comparison, an open manifold is a manifold without boundary that has only &quot;non-compact&quot; components.

== Examples ==

The only connected one-dimensional example is a circle. 
The sphere, torus, and the Klein bottle are all closed two-dimensional manifolds. The real projective space RP&quot;n&quot; is a closed &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold. The complex projective space CP&quot;n&quot; is a closed 2&quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold.
A line is not closed because it is not compact. 
A closed disk is a compact two-dimensional manifold, but it is not closed because it has a boundary.

== Properties ==

Every closed manifold is a Euclidean neighborhood retract and thus has finitely generated homology groups. 

If formula_1 is a closed connected n-manifold, the n-th homology group formula_2 is formula_3 or 0 depending on whether formula_1 is orientable or not. Moreover, the torsion subgroup of the (n-1)-th homology group formula_5 is 0 or formula_6 depending on whether formula_1 is orientable or not. This follows from an application of the universal coefficient theorem.

Let formula_8 be a commutative ring. For formula_8-orientable formula_1 with
fundamental class formula_11, the map formula_12 defined by formula_13 is an isomorphism for all k. This is the Poincaré duality. In particular, every closed manifold is formula_6-orientable. So there is always an isomorphism formula_15.

== Open manifolds ==

For a connected manifold, &quot;open&quot; is equivalent to &quot;without boundary and non-compact&quot;, but for a disconnected manifold, open is stronger. For instance, the disjoint union of a circle and a line is non-compact since a line is non-compact, but this is not an open manifold since the circle (one of its components) is compact.

== Abuse of language ==

Most books generally define a manifold as a space that is, locally, homeomorphic to Euclidean space (along with some other technical conditions), thus by this definition a manifold does not include its boundary when it is embedded in a larger space. However, this definition doesn’t cover some basic objects such as a closed disk, so authors sometimes define a manifold with boundary and abusively say &quot;manifold&quot; without reference to the boundary. But normally, a compact manifold (compact with respect to its underlying topology) can synonymously be used for closed manifold if the usual definition for manifold is used.

The notion of a closed manifold is unrelated to that of a closed set. A line is a closed subset of the plane, and it is a manifold, but not a closed manifold.

== Use in physics ==

The notion of a &quot;closed universe&quot; can refer to the universe being a closed manifold but more likely refers to the universe being a manifold of constant positive Ricci curvature.

<doc id="669480" wikidata="Q681815" url="?curid=669480" title="The Company (film)">
<text>The Company is a 2003 American drama film directed by Robert Altman with a screenplay by Barbara Turner from a story by Turner and star and co-producer Neve Campbell. The film also stars Malcolm McDowell and James Franco, and is set in the company of the Joffrey Ballet.

==Plot==
Without focusing on a single main character, the film depicts a season of rehearsals and performances at the Joffrey Ballet. Its artistic director is the warm yet demanding former dancer Alberto Antonelli, who steadily guides the company through the rigors of training, injuries, scheduling challenges, financial difficulties, and conflicts between dancers and choreographers. As the film begins, Antonelli has his eye on a talented dancer, Loretta &#x27;Ry&#x27; Ryan, and chooses to grant her more and more prominent roles within the Ballet&#x27;s performances in spite of her lack of cohesion with some of its members (one dancer requests to be removed from a number after his relationship with Ry ends acrimoniously).

Like many of the company&#x27;s less senior members, Ry needs to work a second job. Against her mother&#x27;s protests, she waitresses at a trendy bar. Ry meets Josh Williams, a young chef whose slowly ascending position in a restaurant&#x27;s kitchen mirrors her own journey to stardom. The two begin a happy relationship after Josh sees Ry seductively playing pool to Elvis Costello&#x27;s recording of &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; a song which recurs throughout the movie.

One of the central threads of the film is the Joffrey Ballet&#x27;s preparations to stage a new work by Robert Desrosiers based on Hindu mythology. (The performance depicted is &quot;Blue Snake&quot;, which Desrosiers had actually choreographed in 1989 with the National Ballet of Canada). Antonelli and Desrosiers quickly pick Ry to be the featured female dancer in the work after she impresses them by dancing Lar Lubovitch&#x27;s &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; outside during a thunderstorm. The work proves difficult to stage, with another dancer suffering a career-ending injury to her Achilles tendon in rehearsals; its demands also strain Ry&#x27;s personal life, at one point causing her to miss a complicated dinner made for her by Josh. In between the preparations for &quot;Blue Snake&quot;, the company stages and rehearses many other pieces, including a dance on a swing set to Julee Cruise&#x27;s &quot;The World Spins.&quot; To release tension, many of the dancers host an impromptu &quot;roast night&quot; dance on Christmas Eve, in which Antonelli and Desrosiers&#x27; personalities are lampooned.

&quot;Blue Snake&quot; eventually premieres at the Kennedy Center. During the performance, Ry injures her arm at the end of a solo section, forcing Desrosiers to improvise until another dancer can be fitted into her elaborate costume. The work is still a resounding success. Josh, who has been similarly injured in a kitchen accident, sneaks onto the stage during bows to congratulate Ry. They celebrate as the main curtain descends.

==Cast==
* Neve Campbell as Loretta &#x27;Ry&#x27; Ryan
* Malcolm McDowell as Alberto Antonelli
* James Franco as Josh Williams
* Barbara Robertson as Harriet 
* William Dick as Edouard
* Susie Cusack as Susie
* Marilyn Dodds Frank as Ryan&#x27;s mother
* John Lordan as Ryan&#x27;s father
* Lar Lubovitch as himself
* Robert Desrosiers as himself 

The part of Alberto Antonelli was reportedly inspired by the real life dancer and choreographer Gerald Arpino.

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;The Company&quot; was an idea of Campbell&#x27;s for a long time—she began her career as a ballet dancer, having been a student at Canada&#x27;s National Ballet School. Altman was initially reluctant to direct the film, reportedly remarking, &quot;Barbara, I read your script and I don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t understand. I don&#x27;t know what it is. I&#x27;m just the wrong guy for this.&quot; The director eventually relented, and &quot;The Company&quot; turned out to be his penultimate film. Neve Campbell and James Franco prepared for their roles as restaurant workers by training under Mickaël Blais, the chef of &quot;Marche&quot;, an upscale bistro in Chicago.

===Dance lighting===
Dance lighting for the Joffrey Ballet portions was composed by the dance lighting designer Kevin Dreyer.

===Pieces in the film===
Excerpts of the following dance pieces are included in the film:

* Alwin Nikolais&#x27;s &quot;Tensile Involvement&quot; (opening piece, with ensemble bound by elastic)
* Gerald Arpino&#x27;s &quot;Light Rain&quot;, &quot;Suite Saint-Saëns&quot;, and &quot;Trinity&quot;
* Moses Pendleton&#x27;s &quot;White Widow&quot; (dance with the swing)
* Robert Desrosiers&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Snake&quot;
* Arthur Saint-Leon&#x27;s &quot;La Vivandière&quot; (excerpt from Pas de Six)
* Lar Lubovitch&#x27;s &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot; (pas de deux; the performance in the thunderstorm)
* Laura Dean&#x27;s &quot;Creative Force&quot; (Campbell&#x27;s flashback; the excerpt for 10 dancers in red costumes)

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Company&quot; was given a limited release on December 25, 2003, earning $93,776 in eleven theaters over its opening weekend. The film ultimately grossed $2,283,914 in North America and $4,117,776 in foreign markets, bringing its worldwide box office total to $6,401,690—well below its estimated $15 million budget.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a 71% rating based on reviews from 134 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Its deliberately unfocused narrative may frustrate some viewers, but &quot;The Company&quot; finds Altman gracefully applying his distinctive eye to the world of dance.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 73% based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the film, awarding it stars out of four. Ed Gonzalez of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; similarly declared it the best movie of 2003. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;enjoyably lithe and droll&quot; and attributed a &quot;great deal of the film&#x27;s appeal&quot; to McDowell&#x27;s performance, while opining that the film &quot;doesn&#x27;t stick with you as a whole.&quot;

<text>Broadcom Corporation was an American fabless semiconductor company that made products for the wireless and broadband communication industry. It was acquired by Avago Technologies for $37billion in 2016 and operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of the merged entity Broadcom Inc.

Founded in 1991 by a professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from the University of California, Los Angeles, the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles, office to Irvine, California, in 1995. Broadcom became a public company three years later with a listing on the Nasdaq. The company was known for its aggressive acquisition strategy, which led to significant growth and market share.

==History==
===Founding and growth===

Broadcom Corporation was founded by professor-student pair Henry Samueli and Henry Nicholas from UCLA in 1991. In 1995 the company moved from its Westwood, Los Angeles office to Irvine, California. In 1998, Broadcom became a public company on the NASDAQ exchange (ticker symbol: BRCM) and employs about 11,750 people worldwide in more than 15 countries.

Broadcom Corporation acquired ServerWorks Corporation, a maker of chipsets for IA-32-based servers, in 2001 for $957 million. This acquisition was one in a string of purchases of companies by Broadcom in the beginning of the 2000s. Unlike the others, which were struggling start-ups, ServerWorks was revenue-generating and profitable.

In 2012, Broadcom&#x27;s total revenue was $8.01 billion. As of 2011, Broadcom was among Gartner&#x27;s Top 10 Semiconductor Vendors by revenue. Broadcom first landed on the Fortune 500 in 2009, and climbed to spot #327 in 2013.

===Battle with Qualcomm===
In June 2007, the U.S. International Trade Commission blocked the import of new cell phone models based on particular Qualcomm microchips. They had found that these Qualcomm microchips infringed on patents owned by Broadcom. In January 2017, the FTC sued Qualcomm, who allegedly made use of unlawful tactics to maintain &quot;a monopoly on cellular-communications chips.&quot;

On April 26, 2009, Broadcom settled its four-year legal battle with Qualcomm over wireless and other patents. The deal also ended the complaints of anti-competitive behavior. As part of the settlement, Qualcomm paid $891 million in cash to Broadcom over a four-year period ending June 2013.

===Stock options backdating scandal===

In March 2006, a report by the Center for Financial Research and Analysis identified Broadcom as one of 17 companies &quot;at risk&quot; for having back-dated stock options grants between 1997 and 2002. On May 18, 2006, amid media reports about options practices, Broadcom said it had started an internal review of its stock options grants. On June 12, 2006, Broadcom announced it had received a &quot;request for information&quot; from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that it might soon be the subject of an informal inquiry.

On July 14, 2006, Broadcom estimated it would have to subtract $750 million from earnings due to stock options irregularities. On September 8, 2006, the company announced the amount was at least $1.5 billion, &quot;and could be substantially more.&quot; On December 18, 2006, the SEC opened a formal investigation of Broadcom&#x27;s options practices. On January 24, 2007, Broadcom announced a restatement of its financial results from 1998 to 2005 to include a total of $2.24 billion-worth of expenses related to stock option-based compensation. The grants remained the subject of the formal inquiry by the SEC, and an informal inquiry by federal prosecutors.

In between March and May 2008, the SEC announced charges against Broadcom for fraudulently backdating stock options for nearly five years, from June 1998 to May 2003. In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Broadcom&#x27;s top officers at the time had misrepresented the dates on which stock options were granted to executives and employees. In describing the scheme, the SEC said: &quot;Through backdating, Broadcom made it appear that the options were granted at times corresponding to low points of the closing price of Broadcom&#x27;s stock — despite the fact that the purported grant date bore no relation to when the grant was actually approved. This resulted in artificially and fraudulently low exercise prices for those options.&quot;

On May 15, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and CTO Henry Samueli resigned as chairman of the board, and took a leave of absence as Chief Technology Officer. On June 5, 2008, Broadcom co-founder and former CEO Henry Nicholas and former CFO William Ruehle were indicted on charges of illegal stock-option backdating. Nicholas was also indicted for violations of federal narcotics laws. However, in December 2009, federal judge Cormac J. Carney threw out the options backdating charges against Nicholas and Ruehle because of prosecutorial misconduct, after finding that federal prosecutors improperly tried to prevent three defense witnesses from testifying.

In 2008, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged executives of Broadcom with fraudulently backdating stock options. Through the scheme, company executives allegedly avoided reporting $2.22 billion in compensation expenses. The company also allegedly overstated its income by between 15% and 422%, and understated its loss by between 16% and 38%, according to the SEC. A judge dismissed the charges against company executives Henry Nicholas and Henry Samueli, citing witness intimidation on the part of prosecutors. The judge also dismissed charges against chief financial officer William Ruehle. In the end, the company had to pay $160M to settle with the SEC.

=== Acquired ===
On May 28, 2015, chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd. agreed to buy Broadcom Corp. for $37 billion in cash and stock. At closing, which completed on February 1, 2016, Broadcom shareholders held 32% of the new Singapore-based company to be called Broadcom Limited. Hock Tan, Avago President and CEO, was named CEO of the new combined company. Dr. Samueli became Chief Technology Officer and member of the combined company&#x27;s board, and Dr. Nicholas serves in a strategic advisory role within the new company.

The new merged entity was initially named Broadcom Limited but inherits the ticker symbol AVGO. The BRCM ticker symbol was retired.

== Products ==

Broadcom&#x27;s product line spans computer and telecommunication networking products. Examples of such are products for enterprise/metropolitan high-speed networks, as well as products for small office/home office (SOHO) networks. Additionally, the company produces transceiver and processor ICs for Ethernet and wireless LANs, cable modems, digital subscriber lines, servers, home networking devices (router, switches, port-concentrators) and cellular phones (GSM/GPRS/EDGE/W-CDMA/LTE). It is also known for its series of high-speed encryption co-processors, which serve to offload processor-intensive tasks to a dedicated chip.

The company also has a history of producing ICs for carrier access equipment, audio/video processors for digital set-top boxes and digital video recorders, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi transceivers, and RF receivers/tuners for satellite TV. On September 19, 2011, Broadcom shut down its digital TV operations, along with its Blu-ray chip business.

On June 2, 2014, Broadcom announced its intentions to exit the cellular baseband business.

=== Trident+ ASIC ===
Some vendors offer switching equipment based on Broadcom hardware and firmware (e.g. Dell PowerConnect classics) while other well-known vendors use Broadcom hardware with their own firmware. The Broadcom Trident+ ASIC has been used in many high-speed 10Gb+ switches from vendors such as Cisco Nexus switches running NX-OS, Dell Force10 (now Dell Networking) running FTOS/DNOS, all Arista 7050-series switches, the IBM/BNT 8264, and the Juniper QFX3500.

, the latest member of the Trident family is the Trident II XGS, which can support up to 32 x 40G ports or 104 x 10G ports, as well as a mix of both, on a single chip. Examples of switches using the Trident II XGS chip are the Dell Networking S6000, Cisco Nexus 9000, and some smaller vendors like the EdgeCore AS6700, Penguin Arctica 3200XL, and QuantaMesh T5032.

=== Graphics processing unit ===
VideoCore is the GPU found on some systems-on-a-chips by Broadcom, the most widely known one being the BCM2835, containing a VideoCore IV found in the Raspberry Pi.

=== Video acceleration ===
The Broadcom Crystal HD is capable of video acceleration.

===WiFi chipsets===

The Broadcom &quot;BCM43&quot; series of chips implements WiFi support for many Android and iPhone devices. Models include the BCM4339 used in phones such as the Nexus 5 (2013) and the BCM4361 used in the Samsung Galaxy S8 (2017). These are system-on-a-chip devices with a Cortex R4 for processing the MAC and MLME layers and a proprietary Broadcom processor for the 802.11 physical layer. The chips are also capable of handling Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth, and NFC signals.

* Broadcom supplies the WiFi+Bluetooth combo chip for the iPhone 3GS and later generations, as well as their corresponding iPod Touch generations.
* In 2005, Broadcom Corporation announced it would be providing Nintendo its “online solution on a chip”, as deployed in laptops and PDAs, enabling 802.11b connectivity with the DS and 802.11g connectivity for the Wii. More specifically, Broadcom would provide Bluetooth connectivity for Wii&#x27;s controller.
* In 2013, Broadcom unveiled the first 802.11ac 5G Wifi SoCs, which is adopted across many mobile phones, including the Samsung Galaxy S4 and S5, the HTC One series, and the LG Nexus 5. Additionally, routers from Motorola, Netgear, Huawei, and Belkin also include Broadcom&#x27;s 802.11ac chips.

===BroadVoice===
Broadcom authored its own VoIP codecs in 2002, and released them as open source with the LGPL license in 2009. Such codecs are:
* The BroadVoice 16 with a declared bitrate of 16 kbit/s and an audio sampling frequency of 8 kHz
* The BroadVoice 32 with a declared bitrate of 32 kbit/s and an sampling rate of 16 kHz (note, however, that X-Lite SIP phone&#x27;s menu declares the bitrate as 80,000 bit/s)

=== Linux products===

Some free and open source drivers are available and included in the Linux kernel source tree for the 802.11b/g/a/n family of wireless chips that Broadcom produces. Since the release of the 2.6.26 kernel, some Broadcom chips have kernel support, but require external firmware to be built.

In 2003, the Free Software Foundation accused Broadcom of not complying with the GNU General Public License, as Broadcom distributed GPL code in a driver for its 802.11g router chipset without making its source code public. The chipset was later adopted by Linksys, which was later purchased by Cisco. Cisco eventually published the source code for its WRT54G wireless broadband router under the GPL license.

In 2012, the Linux Foundation listed Broadcom as one of the top 10 companies contributing to the development of the Linux Kernel for 2011, placing it in the top 5 percent of an estimated 226 contributing companies. The foundation&#x27;s Linux Kernel Development report also noted that, during the course of the year, Broadcom submitted 2,916 changes to the kernel. That October, Broadcom released parts of the Raspberry Pi userland under a BSD-style license. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, this made it &quot;the first ARM-based multimedia SoC with fully functional, vendor-provided (as opposed to partial, reverse-engineered) fully open-source drivers&quot;, although due to substantial binary firmware code, which must be executing in parallel with the operating system, and which executes independently and prior to loading of the operating system, this claim has not been universally accepted.

Broadcom provided a Linux driver for their Broadcom Crystal HD, in addition to hiring Emma Anholt – a former Intel employee – to work on a free and open-source graphics device driver for their VideoCore IV.

===Raspberry Pi===
The charitable Raspberry Pi Foundation requested help from Broadcom for design and manufacture of the Raspberry Pi card, a DRM-free motherboard capable of interaction with external hardware. Broadcom Corporation organized the fabrication of the processor chip for the Raspberry Pi, with the last before the company&#x27;s acquisition in 2016 being the BCM2837 chip and the WiFi processor BCM43438, which was used by the Foundation.

==Business==
===Notable employees===
* Henry Samueli, co-founder and CTO
* Henry T. Nicholas III, co-founder and CEO until 2003
* Scott A. McGregor, President and CEO from 2005 to the company&#x27;s acquisition in 2016
* Gottfried Ungerboeck, inventor of trellis coded modulation
* Sophie Wilson, designer of the ARM CPU instruction set
* Eben Upton, creator of the Raspberry Pi single-board computer
* Broadcom Fellows, Broadcom Fellow is the highest honor bestowed upon Broadcom engineers.
===Notable alumni===
Many Broadcom employees have gone on to take key positions in successful tech enterprises and starts ups, including:

* Bagher Afshar, who became principal RFIC engineer at SpaceX 
* Michael Hurlstone, who became CEO at Synaptics 
* Nariman Yousefi, who became Senior VP at Inphi Corporation 
* Michael de Nil and Andrew Terry who founded Morse Micro

===Manufacturing===

Broadcom is known as a &quot;fabless&quot; company. It outsources all semiconductor manufacturing to foundries, such as GlobalFoundries, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, Silterra, TSMC and United Microelectronics Corporation.

The company planned a custom-built headquarters campus just south of the Orange County Great Park in Irvine, California. It originally intended to occupy the entire campus, but after the Avago acquisition, it sold the site to FivePoint Holdings and then leased back only two of the four buildings. 
Broadcom was previously headquartered in the University Research Park on the University of California, Irvine campus from 2007 on, and before that was headquartered near the Irvine Spectrum. The company has many other research and development sites including Silicon Fen, Cambridge (UK), Bangalore and Hyderabad in India, Richmond (near Vancouver) and Markham (near Toronto) in Canada and Sophia Antipolis in France.

===Acquisitions===
Broadcom was known for its aggressive acquisition strategy that helped it achieve significant growth and market share, and with quickly entering new markets.

In September 2011, Broadcom bought NetLogic Microsystems for a deal of $3.7 billion in cash, excluding around $450 million of NetLogic employee shareholdings, which will transfer to Broadcom.

===Branding===
The Broadcom logo was designed by Eliot Hochberg, based on the logo for the company&#x27;s previous name, Broadband Telecom. The Broadband Telecom logo was designed by co-founder Henry Nicholas&#x27; then wife, Stacey Nicholas, who was inspired by the mathematical sinc function.

==Philanthropy==
In 2009, the company founded the Broadcom Foundation as a non-profit corporation with a $50M investment, at the direction of Henry Samueli, the company&#x27;s co-founder, and then-Broadcom Chief Executive Scott A. McGregor, who cited a history of science fair involvement as a factor for his own success. McGregor was named the foundation&#x27;s first president and chairman.

<text>In mathematics, local class field theory, introduced by Helmut Hasse, is the study of abelian extensions of local fields; here, &quot;local field&quot; means a field which is complete with respect to an absolute value or a discrete valuation with a finite residue field: hence every local field is isomorphic (as a topological field) to the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, a finite extension of the &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers Q&quot;p&quot; (where &quot;p&quot; is any prime number), or the field of formal Laurent series F&quot;q&quot;((&quot;T&quot;)) over a finite field F&quot;q&quot;.

==Approaches to local class field theory==
Local class field theory gives a description of the Galois group &quot;G&quot; of the maximal abelian extension of a local field &quot;K&quot; via the reciprocity map which acts from the multiplicative group &quot;K&quot;×=&quot;K&quot;\{0}. For a finite abelian extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot; the reciprocity map induces an isomorphism of the quotient group &quot;K&quot;×/&quot;N&quot;(&quot;L&quot;×) of &quot;K&quot;× by the norm group &quot;N&quot;(&quot;L&quot;×) of the extension &quot;L&quot;× to the Galois group Gal(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;)
of the extension.

The existence theorem in local class field theory establishes a one-to-one correspondence between open subgroups of finite index in the multiplicative group &quot;K&quot;× and finite abelian extensions of the field &quot;K&quot;. For a finite abelian extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot; the corresponding open subgroup of finite index is the norm group &quot;N&quot;(&quot;L&quot;×). The reciprocity map sends higher groups of units to higher ramification subgroups, see e.g. Ch. IV of.

Using the local reciprocity map, one defines the Hilbert symbol and its generalizations. Finding explicit formulas for it is one of subdirections of the theory of local fields, it has a long and rich history, see e.g. Sergei Vostokov&#x27;s review.

There are cohomological approaches and non-cohomological approaches to local class field theory. Cohomological approaches tend to be non-explicit, since they use the cup-product of the first Galois cohomology groups.

For various approaches to local class field theory see Ch. IV and sect. 7 Ch. IV of They include the Hasse approach of using the Brauer group, cohomological approaches, the explicit methods of Jürgen Neukirch, Michiel Hazewinkel, the Lubin-Tate theory and others.

==Generalizations of local class field theory==
Generalizations of local class field theory to local fields with quasi-finite residue field were easy extensions of the theory, obtained by G. Whaples in the 1950s, see chapter V of.

Explicit p-class field theory for local fields with perfect and imperfect residue fields which are not finite has to deal with the new issue of norm groups of infinite index. Appropriate theories were constructed by Ivan Fesenko.
Fesenko&#x27;s noncommutative local class field theory for arithmetically profinite Galois extensions of local fields studies appropriate local reciprocity cocycle map and its properties. This arithmetic theory can be viewed as an alternative to the representation theoretical local Langlands correspondence.

==Higher local class field theory==
For a higher-dimensional local field formula_1 there is a higher local reciprocity map which describes abelian extensions of the field in terms of open subgroups of finite index in the Milnor K-group of the field. Namely, if formula_1 is an formula_3-dimensional local field then one uses formula_4 or its separated quotient endowed with a suitable topology. When formula_5 the theory becomes the usual local class field theory. Unlike the classical case, Milnor K-groups do not satisfy Galois module descent if formula_6. General higher-dimensional local class field theory was developed by K. Kato and I. Fesenko.

Higher local class field theory is part of higher class field theory which studies abelian extensions (resp. abelian covers) of rational function fields of proper regular schemes flat over integers.

<doc id="669538" wikidata="Q7497964" url="?curid=669538" title="Ship of Fools (website)">
<text>Ship of Fools is a UK-based Christian satirical website.

==Origins==
Ship of Fools was first launched as a magazine in 1977. The magazine folded in 1983 and was resurrected as an internet magazine website and bulletin board system community forum in 1998. Subtitled &quot;the magazine of Christian unrest&quot;, Ship of Fools pokes fun and asks critical questions about the Christian faith. The site is part magazine and part web community.

==Leadership==
Ship of Fools was founded and is edited by Simon Jenkins (editor) and Stephen Goddard (co-editor). Jenkins is an author, designer and cartoonist from London (not to be confused with Sir Simon Jenkins, former Editor of The Times and author of &quot;England&#x27;s Thousand Best Churches&quot;). Goddard is a journalist and public relations consultant; both have formal theological education. They also perform a show, &quot;Ship of Fools Live&quot;, in churches, universities and elsewhere, with excerpts from the site&#x27;s magazine content. The show toured in the United States in February 2004.

==Website==
The website presents itself as ecumenical/pan-Christian, although the prevailing ethos is English-speaking Trinitarian Christianity. The diversity of the users range from complete atheists to evangelical and liberal Christians.

Notable features of Ship of Fools website are:

* &quot;The Mystery Worshipper&quot; – reports on church services made by anonymous worshippers. The intention is to give feedback on how they appear to outsiders and first-time visitors.
* &quot;Gadgets for God&quot; – kitsch Christian-based products on the internet.
* &quot;Features &amp; Projects&quot; – irregular columns and a range of projects including &quot;R Father&quot; (2001 competition for rewriting the Lord&#x27;s prayer as a text message) and &quot;Church of Fools&quot; (see below).
* Discussion boards – debate and discussion amongst registered members, who are known as (&quot;shipmates&quot;).

&quot;Church of Fools&quot;, an online 3D interactive church, originally ran as a multi-user environment from May to September 2004, before moving to its own website and eventually becoming St Pixels (whose last service was on Facebook in 2015).
In April 2020, &quot;Church of Fools&quot; returned to the Ship of Fools website in response to the COVID-19 crisis.

==Other Activities==
Ship of Fools sometimes leaves the internet for the real world. There are frequent &quot;Shipmeets&quot; where shipmates get together at different locations around the world. Ship of Fools also ran a Ned Flanders Night at the Christian festival Greenbelt.

<text>Ship of Fools (Modern German: ; ; original medieval German title: ) is a satirical allegory in German verse published in 1494 in Basel, Switzerland, by the humanist and theologian Sebastian Brant. It is the most famous treatment of the ship of fools trope and circulated in numerous translations.

==Overview==
The &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; was published in 1494 in Basel, Switzerland, by Sebastian Brant. It was printed by Michael Furter for Johann Bergann von Olpe. The book consists of a prologue, 112 brief satires, and an epilogue, all illustrated with woodcuts. Brant takes up the ship of fools trope, popular at the time, lashing with unsparing vigor the weaknesses and vices of his time. He conceives Saint Grobian, whom he imagines to be the patron saint of vulgar and coarse people.

The concept of foolishness was a frequently used trope in the pre-Reformation period to legitimize criticism, as also used by Erasmus in his &quot;Praise of Folly&quot; and Martin Luther in his &quot;&quot; (&quot;Address to the Christian Nobility&quot;). Court fools were allowed to say much what they wanted; by writing his work in the voice of the fool, Brant could legitimize his criticism of the church. The abbot of Sponheim Johannes Trithemius lamented Brant&#x27;s title choice and would have preferred the book to be called &quot;Divina Satyra&quot;. He compared the work to Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divina Commedia&quot; for the use in both of their local languages. The educator Jacob Wimpfeling deemed the book worthy to be taught in school and Ulrich von Hutten praised Brant for his mixture of classical metrics with a barbarian dialect and the organization of the poetry in the &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;. 
The work immediately became extremely popular, being published in Reutlingen, Nuremberg, Strasbourg and Augsburg, with six authorized and several unauthorized editions until 1512. Brant&#x27;s own views on humanism and the new, revolutionary views on Christianity emerging in the 16th century are unclear. The debate still continues about whether &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; is itself a humanist work or just a remnant of medieval sensibilities.

The book was translated into Latin by in 1497, into French by in 1497 and by in 1498, into English by Alexander Barclay and by in 1509.

Of the 103 woodcuts, two-thirds are attributed to the young Albrecht Dürer, and the additional wood-cuts are the work of the so-called , the gnad-her-Meister and two other anonymous artists.

An allegorical painting by Hieronymus Bosch, The &quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, a fragment of a triptych said to have been painted by Bosch between 1490 and 1500, may have been influenced by the frontispiece for the book. The painting is on display in the Louvre Museum in Paris.

<text>Ship of Fools is a 1965 American drama film directed by Stanley Kramer, set on board an ocean liner bound for Germany from Mexico in 1933. It stars a prominent ensemble cast of 11 stars — Vivien Leigh (in her final film role), Simone Signoret, Jose Ferrer, Lee Marvin, Oskar Werner, Elizabeth Ashley, George Segal, Jose Greco, Michael Dunn, Charles Korvin and Heinz Ruehmann.

&quot;Ship of Fools&quot;, which was based on Katherine Anne Porter&#x27;s 1962 novel of the same name, was highly regarded, with reviewers praising the cast&#x27;s performance but also noting, at 150 minutes, the movie&#x27;s overlong (for 1965) runtime. The film was nominated for eight Academy Awards in 1966, including for Best Picture, Best Actor for Oskar Werner, Best Actress for Simone Signoret, and Best Supporting Actor for Michael Dunn. It won for Best Art Direction, Black-and-White and Best Cinematography, Black-and-White. The title is also a reference to the popular trope and medieval satire of the same name.

&quot;Ship of Fools&quot; was the only English-language film in the nearly 70-year acting career of German film actor Heinz Rühmann, one of the most famous German actors of the 20th century.

==Synopsis==
The action takes place almost entirely on board a passenger ship in 1933, between Veracruz Mexico and Bremerhaven, Germany. Most of the scenes unfold on the First Class deck or among the upper middle-class passengers, but the ship is carrying 600 displaced workers, far more than the ship is certified to carry and they&#x27;re assigned to squalid conditions in steerage. They are all being deported back to Spain by the order of the Cuban dictator, Gerardo Machado. Many passengers bound for Nazi Germany are happy, some are apprehensive, while others downplay the significance of fascist politics. Passenger attitudes differ among those who feel &quot;superior&quot;, who exclude and demean others, and the &quot;excluded&quot; passengers, who tend to be sympathetic and supportive of others.

==Plot==
The ship&#x27;s medical officer, Dr. Schumann, takes a special interest in , a Spanish countess being deported from Cuba who has an opiate addiction which he reluctantly accommodates with prescriptions. Under arrest, she is being transported to a Spanish prison in Tenerife for illegally hiding and helping arm agitators. The 600 laborers in steerage, deported to Spain because of the low market price of Cuban sugar, cheer the activist Condesa as she boards the ship under police escort. The Condesa reveals to the doctor that she was motivated by seeing the impoverished conditions under which the 5,000 laborers lived, under patronage of the man with whom she lived in luxury, supported by their labor. While she manipulates the doctor to cope with her sense of doom, her activism is in sympathy with the doctor&#x27;s humanitarian insistence that the laborers in steerage be treated like human beings rather than cargo. Their shared sympathies soon evolve into love, though both realize it is a hopeless passion. The doctor conceals having a heart condition.

Selected passengers—mostly Germans—are invited to dine each night at the captain&#x27;s table. Some are amused and others offended by the anti-Semitic rants of a German (originally Austrian) businessman, Rieber, who begins an affair with Lizzi, who admires him until learning he is married. Rieber pontificates on topics such as &quot;how we can expunge foreign influences and restore Germany to its national greatness&quot; and the desirability of &quot;exterminating the unfit at birth&quot;. The captain is reassured by Rieber&#x27;s rants, believing that nobody can ever take his party seriously. Though Jews and dwarfs are excluded from the table, the Hutten’s dog, Baby, is allowed. When an animal-loving steerage laborer drowns saving Baby, who was thrown overboard by mischievous children, the Huttens worry about Baby and ignore the dead rescuer.

The Jewish Lowenthal is seated at a side table with a dwarf named Glocken, and the two bond over their social exclusion. Later Freytag, a German passenger, is shocked to find himself forbidden from the captain&#x27;s table when Rieber learns Freytag&#x27;s wife is Jewish. Eventually Freytag discloses that he is separated from his Jewish wife, having found his marriage too detrimental for his career. Lowenthal, displaying the Iron Cross he earned in World War I, counsels Glocken regarding tactical accommodation to the Nazis, stating that Germany has been good for the Jews and the Jews have been good for Germany, &quot;We are Germans first and Jews second...There are nearly a million Jews in Germany. What are they going to do, kill all of us?&quot; Glocken tells him that he may be the biggest fool on the ship.

An American artist couple, David and Jenny, have a passionate but rocky relationship. David is disconsolate at his lack of success as a socially committed artist; the independent Jenny finds his art unsellable and is not sufficiently willing to build him up. He is dismissive of her artistic talent, which she herself undervalues. David expresses that whoever shares his life will need to accept that his art will always supersede her. Jenny fears that their life together will be endlessly fighting with neither willing to put the other’s needs before their own.

Passengers are entertained nightly by a troupe of flamenco musicians and dancers, whose leader pimps the women in the troupe. Johann, an unpaid caregiver to Herr Graf, his invalid uncle, ignores the wholesome and insecure Elsa, who is traveling with her parents. Instead, Johann is attracted to one of the dancers, who rejects him for inability to pay. Johann threatens his stingy uncle if he does not give him money which has been promised to him in his uncle&#x27;s will. He loses his virginity to one of the dancers, who treats him with gentleness when he pays.

Mary Treadwell, a divorced fading beauty hoping to recapture her youth in Paris, is &quot;too far from the cradle&quot; to interest the captain. She disdains the lieutenant who shows interest, dismissing him first as doing his duty to &quot;unattended&quot; women and later as insignificant. When fellow American, former baseball player Bill Tenny is seated at her table, she finds him crass. Bill expresses surprise at the open hostility toward the Jews onboard; she sarcastically replies that &quot;maybe he was too busy lynching Negroes to take time out for the Jews.&quot; Tenny pesters one of the flamenco dancers, believing that buying a magnum of champagne entitles him to her favors. She gives him the cabin number of the &quot;snotty&quot; Mrs. Treadwell. In a drunken stupor, Tenny accosts Mrs. Treadwell, who momentarily responds passionately until she realizes that he has mistaken her for a prostitute; she then slaps him repeatedly, crying out for help.

The ship arrives in Tenerife where the deported workers from steerage disembark. The doctor briefly considers staying with the Condesa, but the captain calls him foolish, contending that the Condesa manipulated him for drugs. After an emotionally painful farewell with the doctor, the Condesa is forced to exit the ship under Civil Guard escort. When the captain tells the distraught doctor she isn’t worth his anguish, the doctor replies, &quot;When I think of the things I have seen on this ship, the stupid cruelties, the vanities…she looked into the garbage dump, she did something about it, and we are the intelligent, civilized people who carry out orders we are given no matter what they may be.&quot; The doctor dies of a heart attack before the ship reaches Bremerhaven; upon arrival his body is unloaded in a coffin with his estranged wife and sons in attendance.

At disembarkation, as in a parade, most characters proceed with &quot;business as usual&quot;, having learned nothing on the voyage. The last passenger to leave the ship is Glocken, who speaks directly to camera, as he did in the opening minutes of the film. Glocken asks the film&#x27;s audience if they are thinking, &quot;What has all this to do with us? Nothing&quot;, then exits into the crowd.

==Production==
Katherine Anne Porter&#x27;s novel &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; was published in 1962. The essayist and short story author&#x27;s only novel was the culmination of a 20-year-long project that was based on her reminiscences of a 1931 ocean cruise she had taken from Veracruz to Germany.

Producer David O. Selznick wanted to purchase the film rights, but United Artists owned the property and demanded $400,000. The novel was adapted for film by Abby Mann. Producer and director Stanley Kramer, who ended up with the film, planned to star Vivien Leigh but was initially unaware of her fragile mental and physical health. The film proved to be her last film and in later recounting her work, Kramer remembered her courage in taking on the difficult role, &quot;She was ill, and the courage to go ahead, the courage to make the film--was almost unbelievable.&quot; Leigh&#x27;s performance was tinged by paranoia and resulted in outbursts that marred her relationship with other actors, although both Simone Signoret and Lee Marvin were sympathetic and understanding. In particular, during one scene shoot, she hit Lee Marvin so hard with a spiked shoe, that it bruised his face.

At the conclusion of filming, screenwriter Mann reportedly threw a party for almost the entire cast and crew except Gila Golan, whose performance Mann was reputedly not happy with.

==Reception==
Although well received by audiences, &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; was compared to &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. &quot;Preachy and melodramatic&quot; was another criticism, although the cast was universally praised.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the film:

Stanley Kramer has fetched a powerful, ironic film ... there is such wealth of reflection upon the human condition in &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; and so subtle an orchestration of the elements of love and hate, achieved through an expert compression of the novel by Mr. Kramer and his script writer, Abby Mann, that it is really not fair to tag it with the label of any previous film. It has its own quiet distinction in the way it illuminates a theme.

Crowther also singled out the work of Oskar Werner. Similarly, &quot;Variety&quot; noted, &quot;Director-producer Stanley Kramer and scenarist Abby Mann have distilled the essence of Katherine Anne Porter&#x27;s bulky novel in a film that appeals to the intellect and the emotions.&quot;

The film was banned in Francoist Spain because of its anti-fascist stance.

On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Ship of Fools&quot; holds a rating of 58% from 24 reviews.

==Awards and nominations==
Vivien Leigh won the L&#x27;Étoile de Cristal for her performance in a leading role.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores – Nominated

==Home media==
The film has been issued on VHS, laserdisc and DVD. The film&#x27;s standalone DVD release is an open matte 1.33:1 transfer with no supplements. The film was later reissued in widescreen with supplements in a Stanley Kramer box set from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Currently, the film is also available in a budget-priced two-disc, four-movie collection DVD licensed from Sony to Mill Creek Entertainment. All four films are presented in their original theatrical aspect ratios and are anamorphically enhanced. The film has been released on Blu-ray in a double feature pack with the film &quot;Lilith&quot; via Mill Creek.

Andrew Kirkpatrick was born in Mine Brook, New Jersey on February 17, 1756. He graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1775.

He served one term as a member of the New Jersey General Assembly from 1797 to 1798. He was appointed to the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1798. In 1799, Kirkpatrick was governor Richard Howell&#x27;s sole opponent in the state assembly for reelection; he was defeated 33 to 15. In 1804, he became the chief justice of that Court, and remained so until 1825.

For many years Kirkpatrick was a trustee of the College of New Jersey, and trustee of Queen&#x27;s College (now Rutgers) from 1792 to 1809. He also served as a vice-president of the American Bible Society. He died on January 7, 1831, at New Brunswick, New Jersey.

==Marriage and family==
Kirpatrick married Jane Bayard in 1792, and they had four children. Their son Littleton Kirkpatrick also became an attorney and politician, serving in Congress and as mayor of New Brunswick, New Jersey.

His namesake grandson, Andrew Kirkpatrick became an attorney and a United States District Court judge.

<text>In number theory and algebraic geometry, a modular curve &quot;Y&quot;(Γ) is a Riemann surface, or the corresponding algebraic curve, constructed as a quotient of the complex upper half-plane H by the action of a congruence subgroup Γ of the modular group of integral 2×2 matrices SL(2, Z). The term modular curve can also be used to refer to the compactified modular curves &quot;X&quot;(Γ) which are compactifications obtained by adding finitely many points (called the cusps of Γ) to this quotient (via an action on the extended complex upper-half plane). The points of a modular curve parametrize isomorphism classes of elliptic curves, together with some additional structure depending on the group Γ. This interpretation allows one to give a purely algebraic definition of modular curves, without reference to complex numbers, and, moreover, prove that modular curves are defined either over the field of rational numbers Q or a cyclotomic field Q(ζ&quot;n&quot;). The latter fact and its generalizations are of fundamental importance in number theory.

== Analytic definition ==
The modular group SL(2, Z) acts on the upper half-plane by fractional linear transformations. The analytic definition of a modular curve involves a choice of a congruence subgroup Γ of SL(2, Z), i.e. a subgroup containing the principal congruence subgroup of level &quot;N&quot; for some positive integer &quot;N&quot;, which is defined to be

:formula_1

The minimal such &quot;N&quot; is called the level of Γ. A complex structure can be put on the quotient Γ\H to obtain a noncompact Riemann surface called a modular curve, and commonly denoted &quot;Y&quot;(Γ).

=== Compactified modular curves ===
A common compactification of &quot;Y&quot;(Γ) is obtained by adding finitely many points called the cusps of Γ. Specifically, this is done by considering the action of Γ on the extended complex upper-half plane H* = }. We introduce a topology on H* by taking as a basis:
* any open subset of H,
* for all &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, the set formula_2
* for all coprime integers &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot; and all &quot;r&quot; &gt; 0, the image of formula_2 under the action of 
::formula_4 
:where &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot; are integers such that &quot;an&quot; + &quot;cm&quot; = 1.

This turns H* into a topological space which is a subset of the Riemann sphere P1(C). The group Γ acts on the subset }, breaking it up into finitely many orbits called the cusps of Γ. If Γ acts transitively on }, the space Γ\H* becomes the Alexandroff compactification of Γ\H. Once again, a complex structure can be put on the quotient Γ\H* turning it into a Riemann surface denoted &quot;X&quot;(Γ) which is now compact. This space is a compactification of &quot;Y&quot;(Γ).

== Examples ==
The most common examples are the curves &quot;X&quot;(&quot;N&quot;), &quot;X&quot;0(&quot;N&quot;), and &quot;X&quot;1(&quot;N&quot;) associated with the subgroups Γ(&quot;N&quot;), Γ0(&quot;N&quot;), and Γ1(&quot;N&quot;).

The modular curve &quot;X&quot;(5) has genus 0: it is the Riemann sphere with 12 cusps located at the vertices of a regular icosahedron. The covering &quot;X&quot;(5) → &quot;X&quot;(1) is realized by the action of the icosahedral group on the Riemann sphere. This group is a simple group of order 60 isomorphic to &quot;A&quot;5 and PSL(2, 5).

The modular curve &quot;X&quot;(7) is the Klein quartic of genus 3 with 24 cusps. It can be interpreted as a surface with three handles tiled by 24 heptagons, with a cusp at the center of each face. These tilings can be understood via dessins d&#x27;enfants and Belyi functions – the cusps are the points lying over ∞ (red dots), while the vertices and centers of the edges (black and white dots) are the points lying over 0 and 1. The Galois group of the covering &quot;X&quot;(7) → &quot;X&quot;(1) is a simple group of order 168 isomorphic to PSL(2, 7).

There is an explicit classical model for &quot;X&quot;0(&quot;N&quot;), the classical modular curve; this is sometimes called &quot;the&quot; modular curve. The definition of Γ(&quot;N&quot;) can be restated as follows: it is the subgroup of the modular group which is the kernel of the reduction modulo &quot;N&quot;. Then Γ0(&quot;N&quot;) is the larger subgroup of matrices which are upper triangular modulo &quot;N&quot;:

:formula_5

and Γ1(&quot;N&quot;) is the intermediate group defined by:

:formula_6

These curves have a direct interpretation as moduli spaces for elliptic curves with &quot;level structure&quot; and for this reason they play an important role in arithmetic geometry. The level &quot;N&quot; modular curve &quot;X&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) is the moduli space for elliptic curves with a basis for the &quot;N&quot;-torsion. For &quot;X&quot;0(&quot;N&quot;) and &quot;X&quot;1(&quot;N&quot;), the level structure is, respectively, a cyclic subgroup of order &quot;N&quot; and a point of order &quot;N&quot;. These curves have been studied in great detail, and in particular, it is known that &quot;X&quot;0(&quot;N&quot;) can be defined over Q.

The equations defining modular curves are the best-known examples of modular equations. The &quot;best models&quot; can be very different from those taken directly from elliptic function theory. Hecke operators may be studied geometrically, as correspondences connecting pairs of modular curves.

Quotients of H that &quot;are&quot; compact do occur for Fuchsian groups Γ other than subgroups of the modular group; a class of them constructed from quaternion algebras is also of interest in number theory.

== Genus ==
The covering &quot;X&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) → &quot;X&quot;(1) is Galois, with Galois group SL(2, &quot;N&quot;)/{1, −1}, which is equal to PSL(2, &quot;N&quot;) if &quot;N&quot; is prime. Applying the Riemann–Hurwitz formula and Gauss–Bonnet theorem, one can calculate the genus of &quot;X&quot;(&quot;N&quot;). For a prime level &quot;p&quot; ≥ 5,

:formula_7

where χ = 2 − 2&quot;g&quot; is the Euler characteristic, |&quot;G&quot;| = (&quot;p&quot;+1)&quot;p&quot;(&quot;p&quot;−1)/2 is the order of the group PSL(2, &quot;p&quot;), and &quot;D&quot; = π − π/2 − π/3 − π/&quot;p&quot; is the angular defect of the spherical (2,3,&quot;p&quot;) triangle. This results in a formula

:formula_8

Thus &quot;X&quot;(5) has genus 0, &quot;X&quot;(7) has genus 3, and &quot;X&quot;(11) has genus 26. For &quot;p&quot; = 2 or 3, one must additionally take into account the ramification, that is, the presence of order &quot;p&quot; elements in PSL(2, Z), and the fact that PSL(2, 2) has order 6, rather than 3. There is a more complicated formula for the genus of the modular curve &quot;X&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) of any level &quot;N&quot; that involves divisors of &quot;N&quot;.

===Genus zero===
In general a modular function field is a function field of a modular curve (or, occasionally, of some other moduli space that turns out to be an irreducible variety). Genus zero means such a function field has a single transcendental function as generator: for example the j-function generates the function field of &quot;X&quot;(1) = PSL(2, Z)\H*. The traditional name for such a generator, which is unique up to a Möbius transformation and can be appropriately normalized, is a Hauptmodul (main or principal modular function, plural Hauptmoduln).

The spaces &quot;X&quot;1(&quot;n&quot;) have genus zero for &quot;n&quot; = 1, ..., 10 and &quot;n&quot; = 12. Since each of these curves is defined over Q and has a Q-rational point, it follows that there are infinitely many rational points on each such curve, and hence infinitely many elliptic curves defined over Q with &quot;n&quot;-torsion for these values of &quot;n&quot;. The converse statement, that only these values of &quot;n&quot; can occur, is Mazur&#x27;s torsion theorem.

=== &quot;X&quot;0(&quot;N&quot;) of genus one ===

The modular curves formula_9 are of genus one if and only if formula_10 equals one of the 12 values listed in the following table. As elliptic curves over formula_11, they have minimal, integral Weierstrass models formula_12. This is, formula_13 and the absolute value of the discriminant formula_14 is minimal among all integral Weierstrass models for the same curve. The following table contains the unique &quot;reduced&quot;, minimal, integral Weierstrass models, which means formula_15 and formula_16. The last column of this table refers to the home page of the respective elliptic modular curve formula_9 on &quot;The L-functions and modular forms database (LMFDB)&quot;. 

== Relation with the Monster group ==
Modular curves of genus 0, which are quite rare, turned out to be of major importance in relation with the monstrous moonshine conjectures. First several coefficients of &quot;q&quot;-expansions of their Hauptmoduln were computed already in the 19th century, but it came as a shock that the same large integers show up as dimensions of representations of the largest sporadic simple group Monster.

Another connection is that the modular curve corresponding to the normalizer Γ0(&quot;p&quot;)+ of Γ0(&quot;p&quot;) in SL(2, R) has genus zero if and only if &quot;p&quot; is 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 47, 59 or 71, and these are precisely supersingular primes in moonshine theory, i.e. the prime factors of the order of the monster group. The result about Γ0(&quot;p&quot;)+ is due to Jean-Pierre Serre, Andrew Ogg and John G. Thompson in the 1970s, and the subsequent observation relating it to the monster group is due to Ogg, who wrote up a paper offering a bottle of Jack Daniel&#x27;s whiskey to anyone who could explain this fact, which was a starting point for the theory of monstrous moonshine.

The relation runs very deep and, as demonstrated by Richard Borcherds, it also involves generalized Kac–Moody algebras. Work in this area underlined the importance of modular &quot;functions&quot; that are meromorphic and can have poles at the cusps, as opposed to modular &quot;forms&quot;, that are holomorphic everywhere, including the cusps, and had been the main objects of study for the better part of the 20th century.
