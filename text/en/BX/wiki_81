<text>Some Girls Wander by Mistake is a compilation album by English band the Sisters of Mercy, released on 27 April 1992 on their own label Merciful Release, distributed by East West/Warner Music UK.

The album collected the complete and unedited studio recording work of the band from 1980 to 1983: their first six singles and EPs, &quot;The Damage Done&quot;, &quot;Body Electric&quot;, &quot;Anaconda&quot;, &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;The Reptile House&quot;, and the 12-inch edition of &quot;Temple of Love&quot;. The 2017 release includes two alternate mixes of &quot;Under the Gun&quot;: Metropolis mix and Jutland mix, originally released in 1993 on the 12-inch vinyl of &quot;Under the Gun&quot;.

== Background ==
&quot;Temple of Love&quot; is the only song from the 1980–1983 time period that was published with an &quot;extended version&quot;. The album does not contain the 7-inch version of the song, which is the same as the extended version but faded out halfway. Although &quot;Temple of Love&quot; was re-recorded in 1992 to promote the compilation album&#x27;s release, the new version was not initially included on the album. &quot;Temple of Love (1992)&quot; featured Israeli vocalist Ofra Haza.

The compilation includes cover versions of &quot;1969&quot;, originally recorded by the Stooges, and &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, originally recorded by the Rolling Stones, which appeared on the &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;Temple of Love&quot; 12 inch EPs, respectively.

The album title derived from the Leonard Cohen song &quot;Teachers&quot;, from the 1967 album &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;, which was a staple live cover for the band throughout its career. The full line is: &quot;Some girls wander by mistake / Into the mess that scalpels make&quot;. &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; also included the Cohen song &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;, which provided the band&#x27;s name.

== Release ==
The album was issued as a limited-edition CD with artwork &quot;postcards&quot; of the early vinyl singles, and as a regular CD without such cards.

==Track listing==
The B-side to &quot;Anaconda&quot; was &quot;Phantom&quot;, previously made available on the &quot;Alice&quot; EP. Digital versions of the album feature the extended version of &quot;Temple of Love (1992)&quot;, in addition to or replacing the original extended version.

<text>Darren Morgan (born 3 May 1966) is a Welsh former professional snooker player who now competes as an amateur and is considered amongst the best in the world.

Morgan won the World Amateur Championship in 1987 and played on the professional main tour from 1988 until 2006. He reached a high ranking of eight and was ranked within the top 16 for six years despite never winning a ranking event. He compiled 111 in his career.

==Career==
Morgan was born in Newport, South Wales

His best achievements as a professional were to win the Irish Masters in 1996, beating Steve Davis 9–8 in the final, and he captained Wales to victory in the 1999 Nations Cup. He was also a semi-finalist in the 1994 World Championship, beating Mark King 10–5, Willie Thorne 13–12 and John Parrott 13–11 before losing to Jimmy White 9–16. He was also a quarter-finalist on three occasions, beating Ken Doherty and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in 1996 and 1997 respectively at the Crucible. When he beat O&#x27;Sullivan in 1997 it was in the round after O&#x27;Sullivan had scored his memorable 5 minute and 8 seconds 147 break against Mick Price.

Morgan still plays in amateur and pro-am events, and won the EBSA Masters and World Masters Championship titles in 2007. On 22 October 2009 he won the TCC Pro-Am by beating fellow Welshman Mark Williams 7–4 in the final.

On 23 November 2009 Morgan won his second IBSF World Snooker Championship in the Masters section, defeating three-time defending champion Dene O&#x27;Kane of New Zealand 6–0 in the final.

Morgan entered the 2010 World Open as an amateur along with fellow senior Tony Knowles and caused an upset by reaching the last 64 of the competition, before narrowly losing to former world number four Matthew Stevens 3–2 in round three.

In November 2011, he entered the World Seniors Championships in Peterborough and came away with victory over Steve Davis in the final. Morgan beat former world champion Cliff Thorburn and &#x27;Whirlwind&#x27; Jimmy White in the previous rounds before facing the six-times world champion in the final. In fact, Morgan had to win qualifying matches just to reach the final stages of the tournament. He beat Davis 2–1 in the final and came home to his Club in Cross Keys with the trophy.

In June 2016, as a wildcard entry to the Riga Masters having won the EBSA European Open title several weeks prior, Morgan overcame Bradley Jones 4–3, Adam Stefanow 4–2, Zhao Xintong 4–1, Doherty 4–3 and Xiao Guodong 4–2 to set up a semi-final encounter with Neil Robertson. Appearing at this stage of a ranking event for the first time since 2002, and becoming the oldest ranking semi-finalist since Rex Williams in 1986, Morgan was whitewashed 5–0 by the eventual champion.

Morgan made a maximum break of 147 against Gareth Edwards in an amateur Seniors event in 2023; this possibly makes him the oldest player to achieve a maximum break in competition.

==Personal life==
He lives with his wife, Tracy, and their three daughters in Newbridge, and owns a nearby snooker club and sports shop that provides printing, embroidery, trophies and engraving in Crosskeys, Newport, named The Red Triangle, where he coaches young players. Darren now lives in a mansion in Pentwynmawr, Newbridge where he is starting up a property portfolio

<doc id="682914" wikidata="Q6394515" url="?curid=682914" title="Kerry Earnhardt">
<text>Kerry Dale Earnhardt (born December 8, 1969) is an American former NASCAR driver and the eldest son of seven-time NASCAR Cup Series champion Dale Earnhardt. He is the half-brother of former NASCAR Cup Series driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kelley Earnhardt Miller. He was employed by Dale Earnhardt, Inc. as a consultant specializing in driver development until 2011. His younger son, Jeffrey Earnhardt, began racing for DEI in 2007 and currently competes in the NASCAR Xfinity Series. Kerry Earnhardt is known for his physical similarity to his father.

==Early life==
Kerry Earnhardt&#x27;s mother, Latane Brown, was Dale Earnhardt&#x27;s first wife. Dale Earnhardt was 18 years old and a local North Carolina dirt racer at the time of Kerry&#x27;s birth. The couple divorced when Kerry was one year old. Brown eventually married Jack Key, who adopted Kerry; Kerry used his stepfather&#x27;s surname for much of his life. Until he was 16, he saw little of his biological father.

Prior to his racing career, Earnhardt dropped out of high school and worked several odd jobs to support his family. This included working at a Pizza Hut and in the Cannon Mills in Kannapolis, North Carolina, where his grandfather, Ralph Earnhardt, also worked.

==Racing career==
Earnhardt began racing in 1992 driving street stocks. That same season, he raced in the NASCAR Goody&#x27;s Dash Series. He raced at various tracks in 1993, including the East Carolina Motor Speedway near Robersonville, North Carolina and Langley Speedway in Hampton, Virginia. He scored two top fives and eight top 10s in 11 races and was the 1992 Rookie of the Year.

Earnhardt won a pole position and recorded eight top 5s and 40 top 10s as well as 1994 Rookie of the Year honors at his local track, Hickory Motor Speedway, in the NASCAR Dodge Weekly Racing Series. His first NASCAR start came in the Busch Series at Myrtle Beach in 1998. After select Busch races in 1998 and 1999, he raced in the Automobile Racing Club of America&#x27;s ARCA Racing Series in 2000 and 2001 for Dale Earnhardt, Inc. (DEI) using DEI NASCAR Cup Series (known as the Winston Cup Series to 2003) equipment formerly used by Steve Park. During this stint, he won four of his 11 starts, with seven top fives and eight top 10s.

In 2000, Earnhardt made his Winston Cup debut at Michigan driving for Marcis Auto Racing, racing against both his father and his half-brother, Dale Earnhardt Jr. He wrecked out of the race on lap five. It was the first of his seven Winston Cup starts. In 2001, the same year his father was killed at Daytona, Earnhardt was involved in a massive crash on October 4 in an ARCA race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. On lap 63 of 67, Earnhardt had to dodge a lapped car by hitting his brakes, which caused Blaise Alexander&#x27;s No. 75 car to catch up to Earnhardt. Alexander began to inch into the lead when Earnhardt&#x27;s car made contact with Alexander&#x27;s, sending Alexander&#x27;s car head-on into the wall and back into Earnhardt&#x27;s car, causing Earnhardt to flip over onto his roof and slide into the grass. Earnhardt managed to climb out by himself. Alexander was given a red flag and the race director called it official, which gave Earnhardt the victory. Alexander was pronounced dead in the infield care center at 10:20 p.m.

In late November 2001, it was announced that Earnhardt would run the full 2002 Busch Series for FitzBradshaw Racing, owned by Armando Fitz and Terry Bradshaw. The entry was sponsored by Supercuts and 10-10-220, with a technical alliance with DEI. The car was initially numbered 8, but later numbered 12. He finished 22nd in points, scoring three top fives and six top 10s. This was one of his two full seasons in any of NASCAR&#x27;s top three series (Cup, Busch, and Truck). He also attempted to make several Winston Cup races in 2002 and 2003 in the No. 83 Aaron&#x27;s, Inc./Hot Tamales Chevrolet for FitzBradshaw, but failed to qualify for every race he attempted. Midway through the 2003 season, Earnhardt was released by FitzBradshaw, replaced by Tim Fedewa.

In 2004 and 2005, Earnhardt raced in six Cup Series races for Richard Childress Racing in the No. 33 car. All six starts were restrictor plate races (Daytona and Talladega). His highest finish was a 17th-place run at Talladega in the 2005 Aaron&#x27;s 499. Also in 2004, Earnhardt made eight starts in the K&amp;N Pro Series West for Bill McAnally Racing, scoring two top fives and five top 10s.

In 2005, Earnhardt joined Billy Ballew Motorsports in the Craftsman Truck Series, replacing Shane Hmiel. Earnhardt won the pole position for the season opening Florida Dodge Dealers 250, but he lost his ride after two races due to lack of sponsorship, with Hmiel returning. For the 2006 season, he signed with ThorSport Racing and drove the No. 13 Chevrolet the full season with occasional sponsorship from the National Pork Board. His best finish of the season was 11th place at Nashville and Las Vegas. At the conclusion of the season, he and ThorSport Racing went their separate ways.

In December 2007, Earnhardt announced his retirement as a competitive driver in a letter to fans on his website.

Earnhardt is still an active test driver for DEI and occasionally drove in the Nationwide Series (NNS). His last appearance in a national touring series was the NNS&#x27; Subway Jalapeño 250 on July 3, 2009 at Daytona International Speedway driving the No. 31 car for Rick Ware Racing. In 2016, he drove one of his father&#x27;s original race cars, a No. 3 1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in England.

==Family life==
He and wife, René, married in 1999. They have a daughter, Kayla. From their previous marriages, Kerry has two sons, Bobby and Jeffrey, and René has a daughter, Blade. In 2017, Bobby Earnhardt raced part-time in the ARCA Racing Series, driving the number 3 Chevrolet for Hixson Motorsports and the number 96 Ford for Brian Kaltreider Racing. He made his NASCAR debut in the Xfinity Series driving the No. 40 Chevy Camaro for MBM Motorsports at Richmond in 2017. As of 2022, Jeffrey Earnhardt races in the NASCAR Xfinity Series for Sam Hunt Racing and Richard Childress Racing, and has previously raced in the NASCAR Cup Series. Bobby and Jeffrey are the fourth generation of Earnhardts in professional motorsports.

===Legal issues===
In May 2016, Earnhardt&#x27;s stepmother, Teresa Earnhardt, sued him for using the Earnhardt name when he and his wife were planning to market a line of homes and furniture under the name &quot;The Earnhardt Collection&quot;. On July 27, 2017, Teresa Earnhardt won an appeal which required the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board to clarify its decision to allow him to use the name &quot;Earnhardt Collection&quot; in his business.

<text>The Lightning and the Sun is a 1958 book by Savitri Devi, in which the author outlines her philosophy of history along with her critique of the modern world. The book is known for the author&#x27;s claim that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu. It was the first book to espouse esoteric Nazism.

== Summary ==
Begun in 1948, completed in 1956, and first published in 1958 in Calcutta, she said it &quot;could be described as a personal answer to the events of 1945 and of the following years.&quot; It is dedicated &quot;To the godlike Individual of our times; the Man against Time; the greatest European of all times; both Sun and Lightning: Adolf Hitler, as a tribute of unfailing love and loyalty, for ever and ever.&quot; It opens with quotations from &quot;The Bhagavad Gita&quot; and Rudolf Hess.

In &quot;The Lightning and the Sun&quot;, Devi attempts to weave Nazism with a cyclic view of history, arguing that time begins with a Golden Age and gradually decays through a Silver Age and Bronze Age into a final Kali Yuga, or Dark Age. She elucidates her concept of &quot;Men in Time,&quot; &quot;Men above Time,&quot; and &quot;Men against Time&quot; using the lives of Genghis Khan, Akhnaton, and Adolf Hitler respectively. Genghis Khan is used as an example of a &quot;Man in Time&quot; who exhibits Lightning (destructive) qualities and furthers historical decay. Akhnaton is used to illustrate a &quot;Man above Time&quot; who exhibits Sun (creative/life-affirming) qualities and seeks to transcend the process of historical decay. The book claims that Adolf Hitler was an avatar of the Hindu God Vishnu.

Hitler is used to illustrate a &quot;Man against Time&quot; who exhibits both Lightning and Sun qualities (destructive power harnessed for a life-affirming purpose) and seek to fight historical decay by using violent, Dark-Age methods to achieve a Golden Age state of existence. In the final chapter of the book, Savitri Devi expands further upon her cyclic view of history and argues that at the end of the Dark Age, Kalki will appear and usher in a new Golden Age.

==Publication==
Originally published in 1958 as a self-published samisdat, an abridged version was published by the far-right National Vanguard Books. Resistance Records, a neo-Nazi and white separatist record label, released an audio recording of readings from the book. An unabridged version was also made available online by the Savitri Devi archive. Most recently, an unabridged version was published by the white nationalist Counter-Currents Publishing. The cost of producing the book (as well as &quot;Pilgrimage&quot;) was covered by Devi&#x27;s job as an interpreter. 

The response among readers of &quot;National Socialist World&quot; (a periodical of the neo-Nazi World Union of National Socialists group) to the book was enthusiastic, resulting in William L. Pierce including more of her writings later.

== Legacy and analysis ==
Alexandra Minna Stern described the book as Devi&#x27;s &quot;most well known and far-fetched work&quot;, and as &quot;more a mystical treatise than a narrative interpretation of the rise and fall of the Third Reich&quot;. It was the first book to espouse esoteric Nazism.

According to Benjamin Teitelbaum, when he was in discussion with Steve Bannon, Bannon used the term that originates in this book, &quot;Man in Time&quot;, to describe Donald Trump.

<text>Nasser Hussain (born 28 March 1968) is an English cricket commentator and former cricketer who captained the England cricket team between 1999 and 2003, with his overall international career extending from 1990 to 2004. A pugnacious right-handed batsman, Hussain scored over 30,000 runs from more than 650 matches across all first-class and List-A cricket, including 62 centuries. His highest Test score of 207, scored in the first Test of the 1997 Ashes at Edgbaston, was described by &quot;Wisden&quot; as &quot;touched by genius&quot;. He played 96 Test matches and 88 One Day International games in total. In Tests he scored 5,764 runs, and he took 67 catches, fielding predominantly in the second slip and gully.

Born in Madras, Hussain was led into cricket by his father, and his family moved to England when Hussain was a young child. He joined Essex in 1987 after developing from a spin bowler to batsman while at school and playing for the various Essex youth teams, as the leg-spin of his youth deserted him. He was selected for England initially on the back of 990 runs scored for Essex in the County Championship of 1989, though injury and poor form would limit his international caps during the early 1990s to three Tests of a 1990 West Indies tour, and four further matches in 1993. Only in 1996 did he become a regular England Test cricketer.

Although regarded as somewhat of a firebrand in his youth, Hussain succeeded Alec Stewart as captain in 1999 and led England in forty-five Test matches until resigning in 2003. Overseeing four consecutive Test series victories and England&#x27;s rise to third in the Test rankings, Hussain is regarded as one of England&#x27;s most able captains. Simon Barnes of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Hussain was &quot;perhaps the finest captain to hold the office.&quot; After resigning the captaincy, Hussain played on in Test cricket until the debut Test of future captain Andrew Strauss – the ability of whom was witnessed by Hussain who scored a century in the same match – and growing calls for him to leave the team, prompted him to yield his position and retire. He joined Sky Sports as a commentator shortly thereafter. His 2005 autobiography &quot;Playing With Fire&quot; won the Best Autobiography category of the 2005 British Sports Book Awards.

==Early years==
Hussain was born in Madras, India into a Muslim family. His father, Raza Jawad &#x27;Joe&#x27; Hussain, was an Indian Muslim and a keen cricketer and field hockey player. He was a descendant of Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, the Nawab of Arcot State in the second half of the 18th century. Nasser&#x27;s mother Shireen (originally Patricia Price) is English. As a child, Nasser&#x27;s first experiences of cricket were family visits to Chepauk, where his older brothers Mehriyar &#x27;Mel&#x27; Hussain – who would go on to play briefly for Worcestershire – and Abbas used to bat on the outfield while he chased after the ball. His father moved the family to England in 1975. Hussain recalled in his 2005 autobiography that the family gave up a prosperous life in India – where the family were comfortable – in order to obtain for the children the benefits of the English educational system. The family moved to Ilford, and Hussain later took charge of the indoor cricket school in Ilford where he used to bowl for hours on end at his elder brothers. He was a talented leg-spin bowler, and with his ability starting to show, at just eight years old, Hussain was selected to play for the Essex Under-11s, and at 12 years old, was the youngest to play for Essex Under-15s. He meanwhile continued his education at Forest School, Walthamstow.

At the age of 14 Hussain was selected to play for England Schools where he first came into contact with his friend and future England colleague Mike Atherton. Born five days apart, Hussain and Atherton soon found their careers progressing in parallel as they captained, batted and bowled legspin for England age-group teams. As well as Atherton, who was considered the &quot;Golden Boy&quot; of the North at the time, Hussain played with and against others such as Mark Ramprakash, Graham Thorpe and Trevor Ward. At the age of 15, and captain of England Schools, Hussain &quot;grew a foot in height in the winter&quot; and the trajectory of his bowling was altered. He recounts &quot;I went from bowling out Graham Gooch in the indoor school with everyone watching, to hitting the roof of the net or bowling triple-bouncers to deadly silence.&quot;

Hussain&#x27;s father initially refused to accept that his son could not bowl to the previous high standards and continued to push him into bowling, while Hussain, full of frustration at his sudden loss of ability felt he was letting his father down. Concerns over his father&#x27;s expectations of him would continue throughout Hussain&#x27;s career, as he related in his biography after retiring. After the loss of his bowling, Hussain dropped behind his contemporaries; Atherton, Ramprakash and Martin Bicknell all began to receive professional county contracts while Hussain was not being selected for representative games and England tours. Hussain switched to batting while he was still captain of Essex under-16s and moved himself up the order to get more runs and to bowl less. His batting progressed, and in that year he became the first under-16 at Forest to score 1,000 runs in a season since 1901. Hussain himself admitted that batting never came as naturally to him as leg-spin bowling. Throughout his career he batted with little left elbow and plenty of bottom hand, and backed-up with the bat in his right hand.

While continuing with his cricket, he also studied Natural Sciences at the University of Durham – a strong cricketing university – where he belonged to the College of St Hild and St Bede. He graduated in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree.

==Test cricket==
Hussain made his Test cricket debut in 1990 against the West Indies with the match ending just before lunch on the final day. England won the test by nine wickets, but lost the series 2–1

Hussain was subsequently not picked for the next three years. He was regarded as a bit of a &quot;hot-head&quot;, and his fiery temper briefly jeopardised his prospects of an international career. At Essex, Hussain continued to score runs and impressed his county colleague and England captain Graham Gooch enough to have a Test reprieve. He was thus selected for the 3rd Ashes Test of 1993, in which he scored 71 and 47 not out, ensuring his selection for the rest of the series. It was however not enough to secure his place for the subsequent winter tour, nor for that matter the next three years of Test matches.

Hussain was picked again for a Test series against India in the summer of 1996. The number 3 batting position had been troublesome for England for some time. England had tried all manner of combinations at No. 3, from the left-field Jason Gallian to the veteran Robin Smith, via the temperamentally suspect pairing of Graeme Hick and Mark Ramprakash. &quot;A lot is made of your batting position,&quot; Hussain recalled to ESPNcricinfo, &quot;but I always felt, and I did back then when David Lloyd rang me up and asked me to bat No. 3, that if you&#x27;re good enough to be playing Test cricket, you should be good enough to move from No. 5 to No. 3&quot;.

Hussain scored 128 in the first innings. Hussain was awarded Man of The Match and with another century in the last Test that summer was awarded Man of the Series.

===Test captain===
Hussain was the captain of the England team for 45 Test matches from 1999 to 2003; as of 2021 the sixth most for an England captain, with his 17 Test victories the seventh most as England captain. His percentage of Tests won was higher than any of the previous eight captains since Bob Willis retired in 1984.

Hussain became Test captain in July 1999, taking over from Alec Stewart for the series against New Zealand at home, after which he was booed by the England fans as he and his team stood on the pavilion balcony. In 2000 he led England to a 3–1 victory over the West Indies at home, and in that winter, the England team beat both Pakistan and Sri Lanka away. Under Hussain, England won four Test series in a row and rose to third place in the ICC Test Championship table when it was launched, after being ninth and last in the prototype Wisden World Championship in September 1999.

Hussain was captain of both the Test and One Day International England teams until after the 2003 Cricket World Cup, when England failed to make the second round after boycotting their match against Zimbabwe in Harare, citing security concerns. But as he stated in his autobiography &quot;Playing With Fire&quot;, the whole Zimbabwe question and the responsibility of whether or not to play against Zimbabwe was left to the captain and it was a question that &quot;kept him awake at night&quot;.

Immediately after the 2003 Cricket World Cup, he stepped down as one-day captain, being replaced by Michael Vaughan. Later in 2003, Hussain announced his retirement as Test captain after England&#x27;s Test series against South Africa, again being replaced by Vaughan.

Hussain continued as a batsman in the Test team until May 2004; in his final Test, against New Zealand at Lord&#x27;s, he scored 34 and 103 not out, hitting the winning runs.

Sachin Tendulkar wrote in his autobiography &quot;Playing It My Way: My Autobiography&quot; that

Among the Captains I have played against, I consider Nasser Hussein the best. He was an excellent strategist ... He was a very good thinker about the game and was proactive. Nasser would not place a fielder in a particular position after a shot was played. Rather, he had the ability to anticipate the shot and would place a fielder well in advance, making a real difference to his team.

Hussain has the record of the most consecutive Test tosses lost as captain, losing 10 in a row between November 2000 and December 2001.

==One Day Internationals==

Hussain&#x27;s highest ODI score of 115 occurred against India in the final of the 2002 NatWest Series, during a game that was described by BBC correspondent Jonathan Agnew as &quot;the most exciting one-day international I have ever seen.&quot; For some time before the game, Hussain&#x27;s insistence on batting at number three and even his inclusion in the team had been repeatedly questioned by several members of the press, most notably Sky Sports commentators (and Hussain&#x27;s future colleagues) Ian Botham and Bob Willis. His innings included a partnership of 185 with Marcus Trescothick (who scored 109 himself). After reaching his century Hussain courted controversy by gesturing wildly, pointing to the number 3 on his back and raising three fingers to the media box. India were set a target of 326 to win and completed the chase with three balls to spare.

==Post-playing career==
Within hours of Hussain announcing his retirement from cricket, it was confirmed that he would join the Sky Sports commentary team on a full-time basis alongside other former England captains Bob Willis, David Gower and Ian Botham and his former England coach David Lloyd. &quot;We now have the most experienced line-up ever seen in a commentary box&quot;, said Vic Wakeling of Sky. &quot;Four former England captains with over 400 Tests, 20,000 runs, and 700 wickets between them – and each is a former Wisden Cricketer of the Year.&quot; In August 2011, in a match between India and England, comments made by Hussain against the Indian side created a stir among some cricket fans: &quot;I would say the difference between the two side is the fielding. England are all-round a good fielding side. I do believe that India have few... 3 or 4 very good fielders and one or two donkeys in the field still.&quot;

In 2004, Hussain released his autobiography, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;. It won the Best Autobiography category of the 2005 British Sports Book Awards.

In 2005 He was awarded Honorary Life Membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club.

Since 2010 he has coached at New Hall School, an independent school in Essex.

He played himself in the 2011 Bollywood film &quot;Patiala House&quot;, in which Akshay Kumar played the leading role.

He was criticised by Sunil Gavaskar because of his comments on the Indian team before Sourav Ganguly became captain.

He is one of Sky Cricket&#x27;s leading commentators alongside Michael Atherton, Ian Ward and Stuart Broad.

==Personal life==
Hussain has been married to Karen since 1993. They have two sons, Joel and Jacob, and a daughter, Layla, all three of whom play for Hutton Cricket Club in Hussain&#x27;s home county of Essex. The club was featured in a short documentary surrounding the development of women&#x27;s grassroots cricket.

His brother Mehriyar also played first-class cricket.

==Honours==
* He was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the Civil Division &quot;For services to Cricket&quot; in the 2002 New Years Honours List.
* He was awarded Honorary Life Membership of the Marylebone Cricket Club in 2005.

<doc id="682929" wikidata="Q7303998" url="?curid=682929" title="Varna (Hinduism)">
<text>Varna (, ), in the context of Hinduism, refers to a social class within a hierarchical traditional Hindu society. The ideology of varna is epitomized in texts like &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, which describes and ranks four varnas, and prescribes their occupations, requirements and duties, or &quot;Dharma&quot;.
*Brahmins: Vedic scholars, priests or teachers.
*Kshatriyas: Rulers, administrators or warriors.
*Vaishyas: Agriculturalists, farmers or merchants.
*Shudras: Artisans, labourers or servants.

This quadruple division is a form of social stratification, quite different from the more nuanced system of &quot;Jātis&quot;, which correspond to the European term &quot;caste&quot;.

The varna system is discussed in Hindu texts, and understood as idealised human callings. The concept is generally traced to the &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot; verse of the Rig Veda. In the post-Vedic period, the varna division is described in the &quot;Mahabharata,&quot; &quot;Puranas&quot; and in the &quot;Dharmashastra literatures&quot;.

The commentary on the Varna system in the &quot;Manusmriti&quot; is often cited. Counter to these textual classifications, many Hindu texts and doctrines question and disagree with the Varna system of social classification.

In India, communities that belong to one of the four varnas or classes are called savarna Hindus. The Dalits and tribals who do not belong to any varna were called avarna.

== Etymology and origins ==
The word appears in the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, where it means &quot;colour, outward appearance, exterior, form, figure or shape&quot;. The word means &quot;color, tint, dye or pigment&quot; in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Varna contextually means &quot;colour, race, tribe, species, kind, sort, nature, character, quality, property&quot; of an object or people in some Vedic and medieval texts. Varna refers to four social classes in the &quot;Manusmriti&quot;.

== The Vedas ==
The earliest application to the formal division into four social classes (without using the term &quot;varna&quot;) appears in the late Rigvedic &quot;Purusha Sukta&quot; (RV 10.90.11–12), which has the Brahman, Rajanya (instead of Kshatriya), Vaishya and Shudra classes forming the mouth, arms, thighs and feet at the sacrifice of the primordial Purusha, respectively:

=== Scholarly interpretation ===
Some modern indologists believe the Purusha Sukta to be a later addition, possibly as a charter myth. Stephanie Jamison and Joel Brereton, a professor of Sanskrit and Religious studies, state, &quot;there is no evidence in the Rigveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided and overarching caste system&quot;, and &quot;the varna system seems to be embryonic in the Rigveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social reality&quot;.

Ram Sharan Sharma, in his book &quot;Śūdras in Ancient India (1990)&quot;, states :

== The Upanishads ==
The Chandogya Upanishad indicates that a person&#x27;s varna is determined on the basis of their actions in their previous life.

The Vajrasuchi Upanishad, however, states that the status of brahman is not based on birth, knowledge, or karma, but on the direct realisation of one&#x27;s own Atman (inner self, soul).

== The Epics ==

=== Mahabharata ===
The &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, estimated to have been completed by about the 4th century CE, discusses the Varna system in section 12.181.

The Epic offers two models on Varna. The first model describes Varna as colour-coded system, through a sage named Bhrigu, &quot;Brahmins Varna was white, Kshtriyas was red, Vaishyas was yellow, and the Shudras&#x27; black&quot;. This description is questioned by another prominent sage Bharadwaja who says that colours are seen among all the Varnas, that desire, anger, fear, greed, grief, anxiety, hunger and toil prevails over all human beings, that bile and blood flow from all human bodies, so what distinguishes the Varnas, he asks? The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; then declares, according to Alf Hiltebeitel, a professor of religion, &quot;There is no distinction of Varnas. This whole universe is Brahman. It was created formerly by Brahma, came to be classified by acts.&quot;

The &quot;Mahabharata&quot; thereafter recites a behavioural model for Varna, that those who were inclined to anger, pleasures and boldness attained the Kshatriya Varna; those who were inclined to cattle rearing and living off the plough attained the Vaishyas; those who were fond of violence, covetousness and impurity attained the Shudras. The Brahmin class is modelled in the epic, as the archetype default state of man dedicated to truth, austerity and pure conduct. Indeed, it goes on to assert that all men are children of Brahmins, which does not make sense, unless understood this way.In the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; and pre-medieval era Hindu texts, according to Hiltebeitel, &quot;it is important to recognize, in theory, Varna is nongenealogical. The four Varnas are not lineages, but categories.&quot;

==== Bhagavad Gita ====
The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; describes the professions, duties and qualities of members of different varnas.

=== Puranas ===
The &quot;Brahma Purana&quot; states that acting against both varna and ashrama (stage), which together guide one&#x27;s dharma, leads to hell. The Brahmanda Purana calls associations between low and high varnas signs of the Kali Yuga, the age of immorality and decline.

== The Dharmasastras ==

The varna system is extensively discussed in the Dharma-shastras. The Varna system in Dharma-shastras divides society into four varnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishya and Shudras). Those who fall out of this system because of their grievous sins are ostracised as outcastes (untouchables) and considered outside the varna system. Barbarians and those who are unrighteous or unethical are also considered outcastes.

Recent scholarship suggests that the discussion of varna as well as untouchable outcastes in these texts does not resemble the modern era caste system in India. Patrick Olivelle, a professor of Sanskrit and Indian Religions and credited with modern translations of Vedic literature, Dharma-sutras and Dharma-shastras, states that ancient and medieval Indian texts do not support the ritual pollution, purity-impurity as the basis for varna system. According to Olivelle, purity-impurity is discussed in the Dharma-shastra texts, but only in the context of the individual&#x27;s moral, ritual and biological pollution (eating certain kinds of food such as meat, urination and defecation). In his review of Dharma-shastras, Olivelle writes, &quot;we see no instance when a term of pure/impure is used with reference to a group of individuals or a varna or caste&quot;. The only mention of impurity in the Shastra texts from the 1st millennium is about people who commit grievous sins and thereby fall out of their varna. These, writes Olivelle, are called &quot;fallen people&quot; and impure, declaring that they be ostracised. Olivelle adds that the overwhelming focus in matters relating to purity/impurity in the Dharma-sastra texts concerns &quot;individuals irrespective of their varna affiliation&quot; and all four varnas could attain purity or impurity by the content of their character, ethical intent, actions, innocence or ignorance, stipulations, and ritualistic behaviours.

Olivelle states: 

The first three varnas are described in the &quot;Dharmashastras&quot; as &quot;twice born&quot; and they are allowed to study the &quot;Vedas&quot;. Such a restriction of who can study Vedas is not found in the Vedic era literature.

&quot;Manusmriti&quot; assigns cattle rearing as Vaishya occupation but historical evidence shows that Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Shudras also owned and reared cattle and that cattle-wealth was mainstay of their households. Ramnarayan Rawat, a professor of History and specialising in social exclusion in the Indian subcontinent, states that 19th century British records show that Chamars, listed as untouchables, also owned land and cattle and were active agriculturalists. The emperors of Kosala and the prince of Kasi are other examples.

Tim Ingold, an anthropologist, writes that the &quot;Manusmriti&quot; is a highly schematic commentary on the varna system, but it too provides &quot;models rather than descriptions&quot;. Susan Bayly states that &quot;Manusmriti&quot; and other scriptures helped elevate Brahmin in the social hierarchy and these were a factor in the making of the varna system, but the ancient texts did not in some way &quot;create the phenomenon of caste&quot; in India.

== Buddhist texts ==

Ancient Buddhist texts mention Varna system in South Asia, but the details suggest that it was non-rigid, flexible, non-hierarchal, and with characteristics devoid of features of a social stratification system.

&quot;Digha Nikaya&quot; provides a discussion between Gotama Buddha and a Hindu Brahmin named Sonadanda who was very learned in the Vedas.
Gotama Buddha asks, &quot;By how many qualities do Brahmins recognize another Brahmin? How would one declare truthfully and without falling into falsehood, &quot;I am a Brahmin?&quot;
Sonadanda initially lists five qualities as, &quot;he is of pure descent on both the mother&#x27;s and the father&#x27;s side, he is well versed in mantras, he is of fair color handsome and pleasing, he is virtuous learned and wise, and he is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle&quot;. 
Buddha then asks the Brahmin, &quot;If we omit one of these qualities you just listed, could not one be still a true Brahmin?&quot; 
Sonadanda, one by one, eliminates fair colour and looks, then eliminates Varna in which one was born, and then eliminates the ability to recite mantra and do sacrifices as a requirement of being a Brahmin.
Sonadanda asserts that just two qualities are necessary to truthfully and without falling into falsehood identify a Brahmin; these two qualities are &quot;being virtuous and being learned and wise&quot;. Sonadanda adds that it is impossible to reduce the requirement for being a Brahmin any further, because &quot;for wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is clarified by wisdom; where one is, the other is, the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality, and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world&quot;. Brian Black and Dean Patton state Sonadanda admits after this, &quot;we [Brahmins] only know this much Gotama; it would be well if Reverend Gotama would explain meaning of the two [morality, wisdom]&quot;.

Peter Masefield, a Buddhism scholar and ancient Pali texts translator, states that during the Nikāya texts period of Buddhism (3rd century BC to 5th century AD), &quot;Varna&quot; as a class system is attested, but the described &quot;Varna&quot; was not a caste system. The Pali texts enumerate the four Varnas &quot;Brahmin&quot;, &quot;Kshatriya&quot;,&quot;Vessa&quot; (Vaishya) and &quot;Sudda&quot; (Shudra). Masefield notes that people in any &quot;Varna&quot; could in principle perform any profession. The early Buddhist texts, for instance, identify some Brahmins to be farmers and in other professions. The text state that anyone, of any birth, could perform the priestly function, and that the Brahmin took food from anyone, suggesting that strictures of commensality were as yet unknown. The Nikaya texts also imply that endogamy was not mandated in ancient India. Masefield concludes, &quot;if any form of caste system was known during the Nikaya period - and it is doubtful that it was - this was in all probability restricted to certain non-Aryan groups&quot;.

== Jain texts ==

Ādi purāṇa, an 8th-century text of Jainism by Jinasena, is the earliest mention of Varna and Jati in Jainism literature. Jinasena does not trace the origin of Varna system to Rigveda or to Purusha Sukta, instead traces varna to the Bharata legend. According to this legend, Bharata performed an &quot;ahimsa-test&quot; (test of non-violence), and those members of his community who refused to harm or hurt any living being were called as the priestly varna in ancient India, and Bharata called them &quot;dvija&quot;, twice born. Jinasena states that those who are committed to ahimsa are &quot;deva-Brāhmaṇas&quot;, divine Brahmins.

The text Adi purana also discusses the relationship between varna and jati. According to Padmanabh Jaini, a professor of Indic studies, Jainism and Buddhism, the Adi purana text states &quot;there is only one jati called &quot;manusyajati&quot; or the human caste, but divisions arise account of their different professions&quot;. The varna of Kshatriya arose when Rishabh procured weapons to serve the society and assumed the powers of a king, while Vaishya and Shudra varna arose from different means of livelihood in which they specialised.

== Sikh texts ==

Sikhism is a late 15th-century religion that originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent. Sikh texts mention &quot;Varna&quot; as &quot;Varan&quot;, and &quot;Jati&quot; as &quot;Zat&quot; or &quot;Zat-biradari&quot;. Eleanor Nesbitt, a professor of Religion and specialising in Christian, Hindu and Sikh studies, states that the &quot;Varan&quot; is described as a class system in 18th- to 20th-century Sikh literature, while &quot;Zat&quot; reflected the endogamous occupational groups (caste).

The Sikh texts authored by the Sikh Gurus and by non-Sikh Bhagats such as the Namdev, Ravidas and Kabir, states Nesbitt, declared the irrelevance of &quot;varan&quot; or &quot;zat&quot; of one&#x27;s birth to one&#x27;s spiritual destiny. They taught that &quot;all of humanity had a single refuge&quot; and that the divine teaching is for everyone. Sikhism teaches a society without any &quot;varan&quot;. In practice, states Harjot Oberoi, secondary Sikh texts such as the &quot;Khalsa Dharam Sastar&quot; in 1914 argued that the entry of certain Sikh castes into major Sikh shrines should be barred. Similarly, in practice and its texts, the Gurus of Sikhism did not condemn or break with the convention of marrying (and marrying off their children) within the &quot;jati&quot;, and all the Sikh Gurus were Khatri, had Khatri wives and practiced arranged marriages within their &quot;zat&quot;. According to Dhavan, the Rahit-namas and other prescriptive Sikh texts from mid-18th century onwards accommodate and affirm the &quot;natal and marriage traditions of different caste groups within the Sikh community&quot;.

Ravidassi Sikhs and Ramgarhia Sikhs follow their own textual and festive traditions, gather in their own places of worship. These are varan-based (caste-based) religious congregations that emerged from Sikhism, states Nesbitt. The Ravidassia group, for example, emphasizes the teachings of Bhagat Ravidas – a poet-saint born in a family whose traditional untouchable occupation related to dead animals and leather. They consider the teachings of living Gurus and the texts of Ravidass Dera as sacred and spiritually as important as the historic Sikh Gurus. This is rejected by Khalsa Sikhs. The disagreements have led the Ravidassia Sikhs to launch the Ravidassia religion movement which, amongst other things seeks to replace the &quot;Guru Granth Sahib&quot; in their Gurdwaras with the texts of Ravidas.

== Varna and jāti ==

The terms &quot;varna&quot; (theoretical classification based on occupation) and &quot;jāti&quot; (caste) are two distinct concepts. Jāti (community) refers to the thousands of endogamous groups prevalent across the subcontinent. A jati may be divided into exogamous groups based on the same gotras. The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the varnas; even Indologists sometimes confuse the two.

==Hierarchical order==

Hindu texts claim Brahmins are supreme in Varnas hierarchical order, while opposite to Hindu tradition Jain and Buddhist texts assert Kshatriyas hold the highest status. During the Buddha period, Kshatriyas elevated themselves as the first Varna. Buddhist literature includes stories reflecting this belief, King Arindama called a priest son a man of low birth (&quot;hīnajacca&quot;), and the King of Kosala used a screen while speaking to his Brahmin employee to avoid seeing their face. Similarly, the Sakyas laughed at a Brahmin who entered their Mote Hall, pushed him back with a finger, and did not offer him a seat.

<text>Aviation safety is the study and practice of managing risks in aviation. This includes preventing aviation accidents and incidents through research, educating air travel personnel, passengers and the general public, as well as the design of aircraft and aviation infrastructure. The aviation industry is subject to significant regulation and oversight.

Aviation security is focused on protecting air travelers, aircraft and infrastructure from intentional harm or disruption, rather than unintentional mishaps.

==Statistics==

===Evolution===

Aviation is safer today than it has ever been. Modern commercial aviation boasts an accident rate of approximately 1 fatal accident per 16 million flights, far lower than historic numbers. 

On December 14, 1903, the Wright Brothers conducted a test flight of their powered airplane from slope of Big Kill Devil Hill in North Carolina. Upon takeoff, the airplane lifted about 15 feet off the ground, stalled, and crashed into the sand. Only three days later, on December 17, 1903, Wilbur&#x27;s brother, Orville Wright, would fly the airplane for the world&#x27;s first powered, sustained, and controlled heavier-than-air flight in history. Although the failed test flight on December 14 would be mostly forgotten in aviation, it remains to this day one of the first aviation accidents in history.

In the early years of air travel, accidents were exceedingly common. 1929 was named the year of &quot;The Great Crash&quot; due to the frequency of aircraft accidents that occurred during the year, with 24 fatal accidents reported. In 1928 and 1929, the overall accident rate was about 1 in every million miles (1.6 million kilometers) flown. In today&#x27;s industry, that accident rate would translate to about 7,000 fatal accidents each year.

For the ten-year period 2002 to 2011, 0.6 fatal accidents happened per one million flights globally, 0.4 per million hours flown, 22.0 fatalities per one million flights or 12.7 per million hours flown.
From 310 million passengers in 1970, air transport had grown to 3,696 million in 2016, led by 823 million in the United States, then 488 million in China.
In 2016, there were 19 fatal accidents of civil airliners of more than 14 passengers, resulting in 325 fatalities, the second safest year ever after 2015 with 16 accidents and 2013 with 265 fatalities.
For planes heavier than 5.7 t, there were 34.9 million departures and 75 accidents worldwide with 7 of these fatal for 182 fatalities, the lowest since 2013 : fatalities per million departures.


In 2017, there were 10 fatal airliner accidents, resulting in 44 occupant fatalities and 35 persons on the ground: the safest year ever for commercial aviation, both by the number of fatal accidents as well as in fatalities.

By 2019, fatal accidents per million flights decreased 12 fold since 1970, from 6.35 to 0.51, and fatalities per trillion revenue passenger kilometre (RPK) decreased 81 fold from 3,218 to 40.

=== Typology ===
Runway safety represents % of accidents, ground safety % and loss of control in-flight %.

Loss of control inflight represents 35% of the fatal accidents, Controlled flight into terrain 21%, runway excursions 17%, system or component failure: 6%, Touchdown off the runway: 5%, Abnormal Runway Contact: 4% and fire: 2%.

Safety has improved from better aircraft design process, engineering and maintenance, the evolution of navigation aids, and safety protocols and procedures.

===Transport comparisons===
There are three main ways in which the risk of fatality in a certain mode of travel can be measured: (1) deaths per billion typical &quot;journeys&quot; taken, (2) deaths per billion &quot;hours&quot; traveled, and (3) deaths per billion &quot;kilometers&quot; traveled. The following table displays these statistics for the United Kingdom (1990–2000), and has been appended. (Note that aviation safety does not include travelling to the airport.)

The first two statistics are computed for typical travels by their respective forms of transport, so they cannot be used directly to compare risks related to different forms of transport in a particular travel &quot;from A to B&quot;. For example, these statistics suggest that a typical flight from Los Angeles to New York would carry a larger risk factor than a typical car travel from home to office. However, car travel from Los Angeles to New York would not be typical; that journey would be as long as &quot;several dozen&quot; typical car travels, and thus the associated risk would be larger as well. Because the journey would take a much longer time, the overall risk associated with making this journey by car would be higher than making the same journey by air, even if each individual hour of car travel is less risky than each hour of flight.

For risks associated with long-range intercity travel, the most suitable statistic is the third one: deaths per billion kilometers. Still, this statistic can lose credence in situations where the availability of an air option makes an otherwise inconvenient journey possible.

Aviation industry insurers base their calculations on the &quot;deaths per journey&quot; statistic while the aviation industry itself generally uses the &quot;deaths per kilometre&quot; statistic in press releases.

Since 1997, the number of fatal air accidents has been no more than 1 for every 2,000,000,000 person-miles flown, and thus is one of the safest modes of transportation when measured by distance traveled.

&quot;The Economist&quot; notes that air travel is safer by distance travelled, but trains are as safe as planes. It also notes that cars are four times more hazardous for deaths per time travelled, and cars and trains are respectively three times and six times safer than planes by number of journeys taken.
Because the above figures are focused on providing a perspective to the realm of everyday transportation, air travel is taken to include only standard civil passenger aviation, as offered commercially to the general public. Military and special-purpose aircraft are excluded.

=== United States ===

Between 1990 and 2015, there were 1874 commuter and air taxi accidents in the U.S. of which 454 (%) were fatal, resulting in 1,296 deaths, including 674 accidents (36%) and 279 fatalities (22%) in Alaska alone.

The number of deaths per passenger-mile on commercial airlines in the United States between 2000 and 2010 was about 0.2 deaths per 10 billion passenger-miles. For driving, the rate was 150 per 10 billion vehicle-miles for 2000: 750 times higher per mile than for flying in a commercial airplane.

There were no fatalities on large scheduled commercial airlines in the United States for over nine years, between the Colgan Air Flight 3407 crash in February 2009, and a catastrophic engine failure on Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 in April 2018.

=== Security ===
Another aspect of safety is protection from intentional harm or property damage, also known as &quot;security&quot;.

The terrorist attacks of 2001 are not counted as accidents. However, even if they were counted as accidents they would have added about 1 death per billion person-miles. Two months later, American Airlines Flight 587 crashed in New York City, killing 265 people, including 5 on the ground, causing 2001 to show a very high fatality rate. Even so, the rate that year including the attacks (estimated here to be about 4 deaths per billion person-miles), is safe compared to some other forms of transport when measured by distance traveled.

==Developments==

===Before WWII===
The first aircraft electrical or electronic device avionics system was Lawrence Sperry&#x27;s autopilot, demonstrated in June 1914. The Transcontinental Airway System chain of beacons was built by the Commerce Department in 1923 to guide airmail flights.

Gyrocopters were developed by Juan de la Cierva to avoid stall and spin accidents, and for that invented cyclic and collective controls used by helicopters. The first flight of a gyrocopter was on 17 January 1923.

During the 1920s, the first laws were passed in the United States of America to regulate civil aviation, notably the Air Commerce Act of 1926, which required pilots and aircraft to be examined and licensed, for accidents to be properly investigated, and for the establishment of safety rules and navigation aids; under the Aeronautics Branch of the United States Department of Commerce (US DoC).

A network of aerial lighthouses was established in the United Kingdom and Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. Use of the lighthouses has declined with the advent of radio navigation aids such as non-directional beacon (NDB), VHF omnidirectional range (VOR), and distance measuring equipment (DME). The last operational aerial lighthouse in the United Kingdom is on top of the cupola over the RAF College main hall at RAF Cranwell.

One of the first aids for air navigation to be introduced in the United States in the late 1920s was airfield lighting, to assist pilots in making landings in poor weather or after dark. The Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) was developed from this in the 1930s, indicating to the pilot the angle of descent to the airfield. This later became adopted internationally through the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).

Jimmy Doolittle developed instrument rating and made his first &#x27;blind&#x27; flight in September 1929. The March 1931 wooden wing failure of a Transcontinental &amp; Western Air Fokker F-10 carrying Knute Rockne, coach of the University of Notre Dame&#x27;s football team, reinforced all-metal airframes and led to a more formal accident investigation system.

On 4 September 1933, a Douglas DC-1 test flight was conducted with one of the two engines shut down during the takeoff run, climbed to , and completed its flight, proving twin aircraft engine safety. 
With greater range than lights and weather immunity, radio navigation aids were first used in the 1930s, like the Australian Aeradio stations guiding transport flights, with a light beacon and a modified Lorenz beam transmitter (the German blind-landing equipment preceding the modern instrument landing system - ILS). ILS was first used by a scheduled flight to make a landing in a snowstorm at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1938, and a form of ILS was adopted by the ICAO for international use in 1949.

=== Post-WWII ===

Hard runways were built worldwide for World War II to avoid waves and floating hazards plaguing seaplanes.

Developed by the U.S. and introduced during World War II, LORAN replaced the sailors&#x27; less reliable compass and celestial navigation over water and survived until it was replaced by the Global Positioning System.
Following the development of radar in World War II, it was deployed as a landing aid for civil aviation in the form of ground-controlled approach (GCA) systems then as the airport surveillance radar as an aid to air traffic control in the 1950s.

A number of ground-based weather radar systems can detect areas of severe turbulence.

A modern Honeywell Intuvue weather system visualizes weather patterns up to away.

Distance measuring equipment (DME) in 1948 and VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) stations became the main route navigation means during the 1960s, superseding the low frequency radio ranges and the non-directional beacon (NDB): the ground-based VOR stations were often co-located with DME transmitters and the pilots could establish their bearing and distance to the station.

=== Jetliners ===

To highlight the jetliner evolution, Airbus split them in four generations: 
# from 1952, early jets (Comet, Caravelle, BAC-111, Trident, B707, DC-8...) have dials and gauges cockpits and early auto-flight systems ;
# from 1964, new designs (A300, F28, BAe 146, B727, original B737 and B747, L-1011, DC-9, DC-10...) have more elaborate autopilot and autothrottle systems ;
# From 1980, glass cockpit &amp; FMS designs (A310/A300-600, F100, B737 Classic &amp; NG/MAX, B757/B767, B747-400/-8, Bombardier CRJ, Embraer ERJ, MD-11, MD-80/MD-90...) have improved navigation performance and Terrain Avoidance Systems, to reduce CFIT accidents; 
# From 1988, Fly-By-Wire (in the A220, A320 family, A330/A340, A350, A380, B777, B787 and Embraer E-Jets) enabled flight envelope protection to reduce LOC in flight accidents.
The fatal accident rate fell from 3.0 per million flights for the first generation to 0.9 for the next, 0.3 for the third and 0.1 for the last.

With the arrival of Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), satellite navigation has become accurate enough for altitude as well as positioning use, and is being used increasingly for instrument approaches as well as en-route navigation. However, because the GPS constellation is a single point of failure, on-board Inertial Navigation System (INS) or ground-based navigation aids are still required for backup.

In 2017, Rockwell Collins reported it had become more costly to certify than to develop a system, from 75% engineering and 25% certification in past years.
It calls for a global harmonization between certifying authorities to avoid redundant engineering and certification tests rather than recognizing the others approval and validation.

Groundings of entire classes of aircraft out of equipment safety concerns is unusual, but this has occurred to the de Havilland Comet in 1954 after multiple crashes due to metal fatigue and hull failure, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 in 1979 after the crash of American Airlines Flight 191 due to engine loss, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in 2013 after its battery problems, and the Boeing 737 MAX in 2019 after two crashes preliminarily tied to a flight control system.

==Hazards==

=== Unapproved parts ===

Parts manufactured without an aviation authority&#x27;s approval are described as &quot;unapproved&quot;. Unapproved parts include inferior counterfeits, those used beyond their time limits, those that were previously approved but not properly returned to service, those with fraudulent labels, production overruns that were not sold with the agency&#x27;s permission, and those that are untraceable. Unapproved faulty parts have caused hundreds of incidents and crashes, some fatal, including about 24 crashes between 2010 and 2016.

=== Foreign object debris ===

Foreign object debris (FOD) includes items left in the aircraft structure during manufacture/repairs, debris on the runway and solids encountered in flight (e.g. hail and dust). Such items can damage engines and other parts of the aircraft. In 2000, Air France Flight 4590 crashed after hitting a part that had fallen from a departing Continental Airlines DC-10.

=== Misleading information and lack of information ===
A pilot misinformed by a printed document (manual, map, etc.), reacting to a faulty instrument or indicator (in the cockpit or on the ground), or following inaccurate instructions or information from flight or ground control can lose situational awareness, or make errors, and accidents or near misses may result. The crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 was a result of receiving and interpreting incorrect coordinates, which caused the pilots to inadvertently fly into a mountain.

===Lightning===
Boeing studies showed that airliners are struck by lightning twice per year on average; aircraft withstand typical lightning strikes without damage.

The dangers of more powerful positive lightning were not understood until the destruction of a glider in 1999. It has since been suggested that positive lightning might have caused the crash of Pan Am Flight 214 in 1963. At that time, aircraft were not designed to withstand such strikes because their existence was unknown. The 1985 standard in force in the US at the time of the glider crash, Advisory Circular AC 20-53A, was replaced by Advisory Circular AC 20-53B in 2006. However, it is unclear whether adequate protection against positive lightning was incorporated.

The effects of typical lightning on traditional metal-covered aircraft are well understood and serious damage from a lightning strike on an airplane is rare. Modern airliners like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner with exteriors and wings made from carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer have been tested and shown to receive no damage from lightning strikes during testing.

===Ice and snow===

Ice and snow can be major factors in airline accidents. In 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248 slid off the end of a runway after landing in heavy snow conditions, killing one child on the ground.

Even a small amount of icing or coarse frost can greatly impair the ability of a wing to develop adequate lift, which is why regulations prohibit ice, snow or even frost on the wings or tail, prior to takeoff. Air Florida Flight 90 crashed on takeoff in 1982, as a result of ice/snow on its wings.

An accumulation of ice during flight can be catastrophic, as evidenced by the loss of control and subsequent crashes of American Eagle Flight 4184 in 1994, and Comair Flight 3272 in 1997. Both aircraft were turboprop airliners, with straight wings, which tend to be more susceptible to inflight ice accumulation, than are swept-wing jet airliners.

Airlines and airports ensure that aircraft are properly de-iced before takeoff whenever the weather involves icing conditions. Modern airliners are designed to prevent ice buildup on wings, engines, and tails (empennage) by either routing heated air from jet engines through the leading edges of the wing, and inlets, or on slower aircraft, by use of inflatable rubber &quot;boots&quot; that expand to break off any accumulated ice.

Airline flight plans require airline dispatch offices to monitor the progress of weather along the routes of their flights, helping the pilots to avoid the worst of inflight icing conditions. Aircraft can also be equipped with an ice detector in order to warn pilots to leave unexpected ice accumulation areas, before the situation becomes critical. Pitot tubes in modern airplanes and helicopters have been provided with the function of &quot;Pitot Heating&quot; to prevent accidents like Air France Flight 447 caused by the pitot tube freezing and giving false readings.

=== Wind shear or microburst ===

A wind shear is a change in wind speed and/or direction over a relatively short distance in the atmosphere. A microburst is a localized column of sinking air that drops down in a thunderstorm. Both of these are potential weather threats that may cause an aviation accident.
Strong outflow from thunderstorms causes rapid changes in the three-dimensional wind velocity just above ground level. Initially, this outflow causes a headwind that increases airspeed, which normally causes a pilot to reduce engine power if they are unaware of the wind shear. As the aircraft passes into the region of the downdraft, the localized headwind diminishes, reducing the aircraft&#x27;s airspeed and increasing its sink rate. Then, when the aircraft passes through the other side of the downdraft, the headwind becomes a tailwind, reducing lift generated by the wings, and leaving the aircraft in a low-power, low-speed descent. This can lead to an accident if the aircraft is too low to effect a recovery before ground contact. Between 1964 and 1985, wind shear directly caused or contributed to 26 major civil transport aircraft accidents in the U.S. that led to 620 deaths and 200 injuries.

===Engine failure===

An engine may fail to function because of fuel starvation (e.g. British Airways Flight 38), fuel exhaustion (e.g. Air Canada Flight 143), foreign object damage (e.g. US Airways Flight 1549), mechanical failure due to metal fatigue (e.g. Kegworth air disaster, El Al Flight 1862, China Airlines Flight 358), mechanical failure due to improper maintenance (e.g. American Airlines Flight 191), mechanical failure caused by an original manufacturing defect in the engine (e.g. Qantas Flight 32, United Airlines Flight 232, Delta Air Lines Flight 1288), and pilot error (e.g. Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701).

In a multi-engine aircraft, failure of a single engine usually results in a precautionary landing being performed, for example, landing at a diversion airport instead of continuing to the intended destination. Failure of a second engine (e.g. US Airways Flight 1549) or damage to other aircraft systems caused by an uncontained engine failure (e.g. United Airlines Flight 232) may, if an emergency landing is not possible, result in the aircraft crashing.

===Structural failure of the aircraft===
Examples of failure of aircraft structures caused by metal fatigue include the de Havilland Comet accidents (1950s) and Aloha Airlines Flight 243 (1988). Improper repair procedures can also cause structural failures include Japan Air Lines Flight 123 (1985) and China Airlines Flight 611 (2002). Now that the subject is better understood, rigorous inspection and nondestructive testing procedures are in place.

Composite materials consist of layers of fibers embedded in a resin matrix. In some cases, especially when subjected to cyclic stress, the layers of the material separate from each other (delaminate) and lose strength. As the failure develops inside the material, nothing is shown on the surface; instrument methods (often ultrasound-based) have to be used to detect such a material failure. In the 1940s several Yakovlev Yak-9s experienced delamination of plywood in their construction.

===Stalling===
Stalling an aircraft (increasing the angle of attack to a point at which the wings fail to produce enough lift) is dangerous and can result in a crash if the pilot fails to make a timely correction.

Devices to warn the pilot when the aircraft&#x27;s speed is decreasing close to the stall speed include stall warning horns (now standard on virtually all powered aircraft), stick shakers, and voice warnings. Most stalls are a result of the pilot allowing the airspeed to be too slow for the particular weight and configuration at the time. Stall speed is higher when ice or frost has attached to the wings and/or tail stabilizer. The more severe the icing, the higher the stall speed, not only because smooth airflow over the wings becomes increasingly more difficult, but also because of the added weight of the accumulated ice.

Crashes caused by a full stall of the airfoils include:
* British European Airways Flight 548 (1972)
* United Airlines Flight 553 (1972)
* Aeroflot Flight 7425 (1985)
* Arrow Air Flight 1285 (1985)
* Northwest Airlines Flight 255 (1987)
* The Paul Wellstone crash (2002)
* Colgan Air Flight 3407 (2009)
* Turkish Airlines Flight 1951 crash (2009)
* Air France Flight 447 (2009)

===Fire===

Safety regulations control aircraft materials and the requirements for automated fire safety systems. Usually these requirements take the form of required tests. The tests measure flammability of materials and toxicity of smoke. When the tests fail, it is on a prototype in an engineering laboratory rather than in an aircraft.

Fire and its toxic smoke have been the cause of accidents. An electrical fire on Air Canada Flight 797 in 1983 caused the deaths of 23 of the 46 passengers, resulting in the introduction of floor level lighting to assist people to evacuate a smoke-filled aircraft. In 1985, a fire on the runway caused the loss of 55 lives, 48 from the effects of incapacitating and subsequently lethal toxic gas and smoke in the British Airtours Flight 28M accident which raised serious concerns relating to survivability – something that had not been studied in such detail. The swift incursion of the fire into the fuselage and the layout of the aircraft impaired passengers&#x27; ability to evacuate, with areas such as the forward galley area becoming a bottle-neck for escaping passengers, with some dying very close to the exits. Much research into evacuation and cabin and seating layouts was carried out at Cranfield Institute to try to measure what makes a good evacuation route, which led to the seat layout by Overwing exits being changed by mandate and the examination of evacuation requirements relating to the design of galley areas. The use of smoke hoods or misting systems were also examined although both were rejected.

South African Airways Flight 295 was lost in the Indian Ocean in 1987 after an in-flight fire in the cargo hold could not be suppressed by the crew. The cargo holds of most airliners are now equipped with automated halon fire extinguishing systems to combat a fire that might occur in the baggage holds. In May 1996, ValuJet Flight 592 crashed into the Florida Everglades a few minutes after takeoff because of a fire in the forward cargo hold. All 110 people on board were killed.

At one time, fire fighting foam paths were laid down before an emergency landing, but the practice was considered only marginally effective, and concerns about the depletion of firefighting capability due to pre-foaming led the United States FAA to withdraw its recommendation in 1987.

One possible cause of fires in airplanes is wiring problems that involve intermittent faults, such as wires with breached insulation touching each other, having water dripping on them, or short circuits. Notable was Swissair Flight 111 in 1998 due to an arc in the wiring of IFE which ignited flammable MPET insulation. These are difficult to detect once the aircraft is on the ground. However, there are methods, such as spread-spectrum time-domain reflectometry, that can feasibly test live wires on aircraft during flight.

===Bird strike===

&quot;Bird strike&quot; is an aviation term for a collision between a bird and an aircraft. Fatal accidents have been caused by both engine failure following bird ingestion and bird strikes breaking cockpit windshields.

Jet engines have to be designed to withstand the ingestion of birds of a specified weight and number and to not lose more than a specified amount of thrust. The weight and numbers of birds that can be ingested without hazarding the safe flight of the aircraft are related to the engine intake area. The hazards of ingesting birds beyond the &quot;designed-for&quot; limit were shown on US Airways Flight 1549 when the aircraft struck Canada geese.

The outcome of an ingestion event and whether it causes an accident, be it on a small fast plane, such as military jet fighters, or a large transport, depends on the number and weight of birds and where they strike the fan blade span or the nose cone. Core damage usually results with impacts near the blade root or on the nose cone.

The highest risk of a bird strike occurs during takeoff and landing in the vicinity of airports, and during low-level flying, for example by military aircraft, crop dusters and helicopters. Some airports use active countermeasures, including a person with a shotgun, playing recorded sounds of predators through loudspeakers, or employing falconers. Poisonous grass can be planted that is not palatable to birds, nor to insects that attract insectivorous birds. Passive countermeasures involve sensible land-use management, avoiding conditions attracting flocks of birds to the area (e.g. landfills). Another tactic found effective is to let the grass at the airfield grow taller (to approximately ) as some species of birds won&#x27;t land if they cannot see one another.

===Human factors===
Human factors, including pilot error, are another potential set of factors, and currently the factor most commonly found in aviation accidents. Much progress in applying human factors analysis to improving aviation safety was made around the time of World War II by such pioneers as Paul Fitts and Alphonse Chapanis. However, there has been progress in safety throughout the history of aviation, such as the development of the pilot&#x27;s checklist in 1937. CRM, or crew resource management, is a technique that makes use of the experience and knowledge of the complete flight crew to avoid dependence on just one crew member, and to improve pilot decision making.

Pilot error and improper communication are often factors in the collision of aircraft. This can take place in the air (1978 Pacific Southwest Airlines Flight 182) (TCAS) or on the ground (1977 Tenerife disaster) (RAAS). The barriers to effective communication have internal and external factors. The ability of the flight crew to maintain situational awareness is a critical human factor in air safety. Human factors training is available to general aviation pilots and called single pilot resource management training.

Failure of the pilots to properly monitor the flight instruments caused the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 401 in 1972. Controlled flight into terrain (CFIT), and error during take-off and landing can have catastrophic consequences, for example causing the crash of Prinair Flight 191 on landing, also in 1972.

==== Pilot fatigue ====
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines fatigue as &quot;A physiological state of reduced mental or physical performance capability resulting from sleep loss or extended wakefulness, circadian phase, or workload.&quot; The phenomenon places great risk on the crew and passengers of an airplane because it significantly increases the chance of pilot error. Fatigue is particularly prevalent among pilots because of &quot;unpredictable work hours, long duty periods, circadian disruption, and insufficient sleep&quot;. These factors can occur together to produce a combination of sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm effects, and &#x27;time-on task&#x27; fatigue. Regulators attempt to mitigate fatigue by limiting the number of hours pilots are allowed to fly over varying periods of time. Experts in aviation fatigue often find that these methods fall short of their goals.

====Piloting while intoxicated====
Rarely, flight crew members are arrested or subject to disciplinary action for being intoxicated on the job. In 1990, three Northwest Airlines crew members were sentenced to jail for flying while drunk. In 2001, Northwest fired a pilot who failed a breathalyzer test after a flight. In July 2002, both pilots of America West Airlines Flight 556 were arrested just before they were scheduled to fly because they had been drinking alcohol. The pilots were fired and the FAA revoked their pilot licenses. At least one fatal airliner accident involving drunk pilots occurred when Aero Flight 311 crashed at Kvevlax, Finland, killing all 25 on board in 1961. Another example is the crash Aeroflot Flight 821, in which the captain&#x27;s intoxication contributed to the accident, killing all 88 on board.

====Pilot suicide and murder====
There have been rare instances of suicide by pilots. Although most air crew are screened for psychological fitness, a very few authorized pilots have flown acts of suicide and even mass murder. 

In 1982, Japan Airlines Flight 350 crashed while on approach to the Tokyo Haneda Airport, killing 24 of the 174 on board. The official investigation found the mentally ill captain had attempted suicide by placing the inboard engines into reverse thrust, while the aircraft was close to the runway. The first officer did not have enough time to countermand before the aircraft stalled and crashed.

In 1997, SilkAir Flight 185 suddenly went into a high dive from its cruising altitude. The speed of the dive was so high that the aircraft began to break apart before it finally crashed near Palembang, Sumatra. After three years of investigation, the Indonesian authorities declared that the cause of the accident could not be determined. However, the US NTSB concluded that deliberate suicide by the captain was the only reasonable explanation.

In 1999 in the case of EgyptAir Flight 990, it appears that the first officer deliberately crashed into the Atlantic Ocean while the captain was away from his station.

Crew involvement is one of the speculative theories in the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 on 8 March 2014.

On 24 March 2015, Germanwings Flight 9525 (an Airbus A320-200) crashed north-west of Nice, in the French Alps, after a constant descent that began one minute after the last routine contact with air traffic control, and shortly after the aircraft had reached its assigned cruise altitude. All 144 passengers and six crew members were killed. The crash was intentionally caused by the co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz. Having been declared &#x27;unfit to work&#x27; without telling his employer, Lubitz reported for duty, and during the flight locked the captain out of the flight-deck. In response to the incident and the circumstances of Lubitz&#x27;s involvement, aviation authorities in Canada, New Zealand, Germany, and Australia implemented new regulations that require two authorised personnel to be present in the cockpit at all times. Three days after the incident, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued a temporary recommendation for airlines to ensure that at least two crew members, including at least one pilot, are in the cockpit at all times of the flight. Several airlines announced they had already adopted similar policies voluntarily.

====Deliberate aircrew inaction====
Inaction, omission, failure to act as required, willful disregard of safety procedures, disdain for rules, and unjustifiable risk-taking by pilots have also led to accidents and incidents.

Although Smartwings QS-1125 flight of 22 August 2019 successfully made an emergency landing at destination, the captain was censured for failing to follow mandatory procedures, including for not landing at the nearest possible diversion airport after an engine failure.

====Human factors of third parties====

Unsafe human factors are not limited to pilot errors. Third party factors include ground crew mishaps, ground vehicle to aircraft collisions and engineering maintenance related problems. For example, failure to properly close a cargo door on Turkish Airlines Flight 981 in 1974 caused the loss of the aircraft. (However, design of the cargo door latch was also a major factor in the accident.) In the case of Japan Air Lines Flight 123 in 1985, improper repair of previous damage led to explosive decompression of the cabin, which in turn destroyed the vertical stabilizer and damaged all four hydraulic systems which powered all the flight controls.

====Controlled flight into terrain====
&quot;Controlled flight into terrain&quot; (CFIT) is a class of accidents in which an aircraft is flown under control into terrain or man-made structures. CFIT accidents typically result from pilot error or of navigational system error. Failure to protect ILS critical areas can also cause CFIT accidents. In December 1995, American Airlines Flight 965 tracked off course while approaching Cali, Colombia, and hit a mountainside despite a terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS) terrain warning in the cockpit and desperate pilot attempt to gain altitude after the warning. Crew position awareness and monitoring of navigational systems are essential to the prevention of CFIT accidents. , over 40,000 aircraft had enhanced TAWS installed, and they had flown over 800 million hours without a CFIT accident.

Another anti-CFIT tool is the Minimum Safe Altitude Warning (MSAW) system which monitors the altitudes transmitted by aircraft transponders and compares that with the system&#x27;s defined minimum safe altitudes for a given area. When the system determines the aircraft is lower, or might soon be lower, than the minimum safe altitude, the air traffic controller receives an acoustic and visual warning and then alerts the pilot that the aircraft is too low.

====Electromagnetic interference====

The use of certain electronic equipment is partially or entirely prohibited as it might interfere with aircraft operation, such as causing compass deviations. Use of some types of personal electronic devices is prohibited when an aircraft is below , taking off, or landing. Use of a mobile phone is prohibited on most flights because in-flight usage creates problems with ground-based cells. Wireless devices such as cellphones feature an airplane mode.

===Ground damage===

Various ground support equipment operate in close proximity to the fuselage and wings to service the aircraft and occasionally cause accidental damage in the form of scratches in the paint or small dents in the skin. However, because aircraft structures (including the outer skin) play such a critical role in the safe operation of a flight, all damage is inspected, measured, and possibly tested to ensure that any damage is within safe tolerances.

An example problem was the depressurization incident on Alaska Airlines Flight 536 in 2005. During ground services, a baggage handler hit the side of the aircraft with a tug towing a train of baggage carts. This damaged the metal skin of the aircraft. This damage was not reported and the plane departed. Climbing through the damaged section of the skin gave way under the difference in pressure between the inside of the aircraft and the outside air. The cabin depressurized explosively necessitating a rapid descent to denser (breathable) air and an emergency landing. Post-landing examination of the fuselage revealed a hole on the right side of the airplane.

===Volcanic ash===

Plumes of volcanic ash near active volcanoes can damage propellers, engines and cockpit windows.
 In 1982, British Airways Flight 9 flew through an ash cloud and temporarily lost power from all four engines. The plane was badly damaged, with all the leading edges being scratched. The front windscreens had been so badly &quot;sand&quot; blasted by the ash that they could not be used to land the aircraft.

Prior to 2010 the general approach taken by airspace regulators was that if the ash concentration rose above zero, then the airspace was considered unsafe and was consequently closed.
Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers enable liaison between meteorologists, volcanologists, and the aviation industry.

=== Runway safety ===

Types of runway safety incidents include:
* Runway excursion – an incident involving only a single aircraft making an inappropriate exit from the runway.
* Runway overrun – a specific type of excursion where the aircraft does not stop before the end of the runway (e.g., Air France Flight 358).
* Runway incursion – incorrect presence of a vehicle, person, or another aircraft on the runway (e.g., Tenerife airport disaster).
* Runway confusion – crew misidentification of the runway for landing or take-off (e.g., Comair Flight 5191, Singapore Airlines Flight 6).

The last two types can be prevented with airport surveillance and broadcast systems, a Runway Awareness and Advisory System, and landing navigation systems (e.g. transponder landing system, microwave landing system, instrument landing system).

===Terrorism===
Aircrew are normally trained to handle hijack situations. Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, stricter airport and airline security measures are in place to prevent terrorism, such as security checkpoints and locking the cockpit doors during flight.

In the United States, the Federal Flight Deck Officer program is run by the Federal Air Marshal Service, with the aim of training active and licensed airline pilots to carry weapons and defend their aircraft against criminal activity and terrorism. Upon completion of government training, selected pilots enter a covert law enforcement and counter-terrorism service. Their jurisdiction is normally limited to a flight deck or a cabin of a commercial airliner or a cargo aircraft they operate while on duty.

===Military action===
Passenger planes have rarely been attacked in both peacetime and war. Examples:
* In 1955, Bulgaria shot down El Al Flight 402.
* In 1973, Israel shot down Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114.
* In 1983, the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007.
* In 1988, the United States shot down Iran Air Flight 655.
* In 2001, the Ukrainian Air Force accidentally shot down Siberia Airlines Flight 1812 during an exercise.
* In 2014, Russia shot down Malaysia Airlines Flight 17.
* In 2020, Iran shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752.

==Accident survivability==
Earlier tragedies investigations and improved engineering has allowed many safety improvements that have allowed an increasing safer aviation.

===Airport design===

Airport design and location can have a large impact on aviation safety, especially since some airports such as Chicago Midway International Airport were originally built for propeller planes and many airports are in congested areas where it is difficult to meet newer safety standards. For instance, the FAA issued rules in 1999 calling for a runway safety area, usually extending to each side and beyond the end of a runway. This is intended to cover ninety percent of the cases of an aircraft leaving the runway by providing a buffer space free of obstacles. Many older airports do not meet this standard. One method of substituting for the at the end of a runway for airports in congested areas is to install an engineered materials arrestor system (EMAS). These systems are usually made of lightweight, crushable concrete that absorbs the energy of the aircraft to bring it to a rapid stop. , they have stopped three aircraft at JFK Airport.

===Emergency airplane evacuations===
According to a 2000 report by the National Transportation Safety Board, emergency aircraft evacuations happen about once every 11 days in the U.S. While some situations are extremely dire, such as when the plane is on fire, in many cases the greatest challenge for passengers can be the use of the evacuation slide. In a &quot;Time&quot; article on the subject, Amanda Ripley reported that when a new supersized Airbus A380 underwent mandatory evacuation tests in 2006, thirty-three of the 873 evacuating volunteers got hurt. While the evacuation was considered a success, one volunteer suffered a broken leg, while the remaining 32 received slide burns. Such accidents are common. In her article, Ripley provided tips on how to make it down the airplane slide without injury.
Another improvement to airplane evacuations is the requirement by the Federal Aviation Administration for planes to demonstrate an evacuation time of 90 seconds with half the emergency exits blocked for each type of airplane in their fleet. According to studies, 90 seconds is the time needed to evacuate before the plane starts burning, before there can be a very large fire or explosions, or before fumes fill the cabin.

=== Aircraft materials and design ===
Changes such as using new materials for seat fabric and insulation has given between 40 and 60 additional seconds to people on board to evacuate before the cabin gets filled with fire and potential deadly fumes. Other improvements through the years include the use of properly rated seatbelts, impact resistant seat frames, and airplane wings and engines designed to shear off to absorb impact forces.

=== Radar and wind shear detection systems ===
As the result of the accidents due to wind shear and other weather disturbances, most notably the 1985 crash of Delta Air Lines Flight 191, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration mandated that all commercial aircraft have on-board wind shear detection systems by 1993. Since 1995, the number of major civil aircraft accidents caused by wind shear has dropped to approximately one every ten years, due to the mandated on-board detection as well as the addition of Doppler weather radar units on the ground (NEXRAD). The installation of high-resolution Terminal Doppler Weather Radar stations at many U.S. airports that are commonly affected by wind shear has further aided the ability of pilots and ground controllers to avoid wind shear conditions.

==Air safety investigators==

Air safety investigators are trained and authorized to investigate aviation accidents and incidents: to research, analyse, and report their conclusions. They may be specialized in flight operations, training, aircraft structures, air traffic control, flight recorders or human factors. They are employed by government organizations responsible for aviation safety, manufacturers or unions, though only government organizations have statutory powers to investigate.

==Safety improvement initiatives==
The safety improvement initiatives are aviation safety partnerships between regulators, manufacturers, operators, professional unions, research organisations, and international aviation organisations to further enhance safety.
Some major safety initiatives worldwide are:
* Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) in the US. The Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST) was founded in 1998 with a goal to reduce the commercial aviation fatality rate in the United States by 80 percent by 2007.
* European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI) . The European Strategic Safety Initiative (ESSI) is an aviation safety partnership between EASA, other regulators and the industry. The initiative objective is to further enhance safety for citizens in Europe and worldwide through safety analysis, implementation of cost effective action plans, and coordination with other safety initiatives worldwide.
After the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, in June 2014, the International Air Transport Association said it was working on implementing new measures to track aircraft in flight in real time. A special panel was considering a range of options including the production of equipment especially designed to ensure real-time tracking.

Since pilot error accounts for between one-third and 60% of aviation accidents, advances in automation and technology could replace some or all of the duties of the aircraft pilots. Automation since the 1980s has already eliminated the need for flight engineers. In complex situations with severely degraded systems, the problem-solving and judgement capability of humans is challenging to achieve with automated systems, for example the catastrophic engine failures experienced by United Airlines Flight 232 and Qantas Flight 32. However, with more accurate software modeling of aeronautic factors, test planes have been successfully flown in these conditions.

While the accident rate is very low, to ensure they do not rise with the air transport growth, experts recommend creating a robust culture of collecting information from employees without blame.

<text>In physics, a quantum phase transition (QPT) is a phase transition between different quantum phases (phases of matter at zero temperature). Contrary to classical phase transitions, quantum phase transitions can only be accessed by varying a physical parameter—such as magnetic field or pressure—at absolute zero temperature. The transition describes an abrupt change in the ground state of a many-body system due to its quantum fluctuations. Such a quantum phase transition can be a second-order phase transition. Quantum phase transitions can also be represented by the topological fermion condensation quantum phase transition, see e.g. strongly correlated quantum spin liquid. In case of three dimensional Fermi liquid, this transition transforms the Fermi surface into a Fermi volume. Such a transition can be a first-order phase transition, for it transforms two dimensional structure (Fermi surface) into three dimensional. As a result, the topological charge of Fermi liquid changes abruptly, since it takes only one of a discrete set of values.

==Classical description==

To understand quantum phase transitions, it is useful to contrast them to classical phase transitions (CPT) (also called thermal phase transitions). A CPT describes a cusp in the thermodynamic properties of a system. It signals a reorganization of the particles; A typical example is the freezing transition of water describing the transition between liquid and solid. The classical phase transitions are driven by a competition between the energy of a system and the entropy of its thermal fluctuations. A classical system does not have entropy at zero temperature and therefore no phase transition can occur. Their order is determined by the first discontinuous derivative of a thermodynamic potential.

A phase transition from water to ice, for example, involves latent heat (a discontinuity of the internal energy formula_1) and is of first order. A phase transition from a ferromagnet to a paramagnet is continuous and is of second order. (See phase transition for Ehrenfest&#x27;s classification of phase transitions by the derivative of free energy which is discontinuous at the transition). These continuous transitions from an ordered to a disordered phase are described by an order parameter, which is zero in the disordered and nonzero in the ordered phase. For the aforementioned ferromagnetic transition, the order parameter would represent the total magnetization of the system.

Although the thermodynamic average of the order parameter is zero in the disordered state, its fluctuations can be nonzero and become long-ranged in the vicinity of the critical point, where their typical length scale &quot;ξ&quot; (correlation length) and typical fluctuation decay time scale &quot;τc&quot; (correlation time) diverge:

:formula_2

:formula_3

where

:formula_4

is defined as the relative deviation from the critical temperature &quot;Tc&quot;. We call &quot;ν&quot; the (correlation length) &quot;critical exponent&quot; and &quot;z&quot; the &quot;dynamical critical exponent&quot;. Critical behavior of nonzero temperature phase transitions is fully described by classical thermodynamics; quantum mechanics does not play any role even if the actual phases require a quantum mechanical description (e.g. superconductivity).

==Quantum description==

Talking about &quot;quantum&quot; phase transitions means talking about transitions at &quot;T&quot; = 0: by tuning a non-temperature parameter like pressure, chemical composition or magnetic field, one could suppress e.g. some transition temperature like the Curie or Néel temperature to 0 K.

As a system in equilibrium at zero temperature is always in its lowest-energy state (or an equally weighted superposition if the lowest-energy is degenerate), a QPT cannot be explained by thermal fluctuations. Instead, quantum fluctuations, arising from Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle, drive the loss of order characteristic of a QPT. The QPT occurs at the quantum critical point (QCP), where quantum fluctuations driving the transition diverge and become scale invariant in space and time. 

Although absolute zero is not physically realizable, characteristics of the transition can be detected in the system&#x27;s low-temperature behavior near the critical point. At nonzero temperatures, classical fluctuations with an energy scale of &quot;kBT&quot; compete with the quantum fluctuations of energy scale &quot;ħω.&quot; Here &quot;ω&quot; is the characteristic frequency of the quantum oscillation and is inversely proportional to the correlation time. Quantum fluctuations dominate the system&#x27;s behavior in the region where &quot;ħω&quot; &gt; &quot;kBT&quot;, known as the quantum critical region. This quantum critical behavior manifests itself in unconventional and unexpected physical behavior like novel non Fermi liquid phases. From a theoretical point of view, a phase diagram like the one shown on the right is expected: the QPT separates an ordered from a disordered phase (often, the low temperature disordered phase is referred to as &#x27;quantum&#x27; disordered).

At high enough temperatures, the system is disordered and purely classical. Around the classical phase transition, the system is governed by classical thermal fluctuations (light blue area). This region becomes narrower with decreasing energies and converges towards the quantum critical point (QCP). Experimentally, the &#x27;quantum critical&#x27; phase, which is still governed by quantum fluctuations, is the most interesting one.

<text>Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park (formerly Indianapolis Raceway Park, O&#x27;Reilly Raceway Park at Indianapolis, and Lucas Oil Raceway) is an auto racing facility in Brownsburg, Indiana, about northwest of downtown Indianapolis. It includes a oval track, a road course (which has fallen into disrepair and is no longer used), and a drag strip which is among the premier drag racing venues in the world. The complex receives about 500,000 visitors annually.

==History==

In 1958, 15 Indianapolis-area businessmen and racing professionals led by Tom Binford, Frank Dickie, Rodger Ward, and Howard Fieber invested $5,000 each to fund the development of a farm tract into a recreational sporting complex that would focus on auto racing. The original intention was to create a 15-turn, road course, but as an insurance measure against economic problems, the investment group decided to incorporate a quarter-mile drag strip into the long straightaway of the road course design. Constructed with assistance from the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA), the drag strip was the first to be completed, with the facility&#x27;s first event held on the strip in the fall of 1960. The facility was called Indianapolis Raceway Park. A year later, a paved oval was completed to finish off the track capabilities of the complex. The oval track was used as-is until an overall track renovation was completed in 1988 in order to increase speed on the track.

The premier feature of Lucas Oil Raceway is a long drag strip. The single NHRA event held at the facility is the oldest and most prestigious of the series. The NHRA U.S. Nationals, held every year during the Labor Day weekend, is the only event on the NHRA schedule with final eliminations scheduled on a Monday. An all-star style race, called the Traxxas Nitro Shootout, is held for the two nitro divisions (Top Fuel on Saturday and Funny Car on Sunday). The winners in each division win $100,000 US, while the race itself has the largest purse of any NHRA sanctioned event at over $250,000 US. The drag strip has held the event every year since 1961, when the race was moved from Detroit.

Sprint and midget races are held on the oval, along with other events suited to a shorter track. Raceway Park traditionally stages an extensive program on the Saturday nights of major races at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. On Memorial Day weekend, the venue hosts a USAC Silver Crown, Sprint Car and Midget Car event, serving as something of an unofficial preliminary event to the Indianapolis 500. It was previously held on Saturday Night under the name Night before the 500, and is currently held on Friday night as the Carb Night Classic. Similarly, the NASCAR Nationwide Series Kroger 200 was given a &quot;Night before the 400&quot; status; a Truck Series race was added to the weekend in 1995. When Formula One raced at IMS, midget, sprint, and stock car races were held at ORP in the &quot;Night Before F1&quot; meets, including the 2002 and 2003 USGP races that featured a twin 25-lap midget format, with a full inversion, and the winner winning $50,000 if they could win both features.

The 15-turn road course was used by the Indianapolis area Sports Car Club of America road racing events. The initial Indianapolis Raceway Park road race was an SCCA event held in 1961. In 1965, rookie driver Mario Andretti won his first Indy car race on the road course, in an event that was historic in that it was the first time in modern history that American Indy cars raced on a road circuit. For the next six years, the road course hosted the Hoosier Grand Prix, a round of the USAC National Championship Series, the same series that included the Indianapolis 500, as well as the USAC Stock Car series, including the Yankee 300. Notably, in the 1969 movie &quot;Winning&quot;, Paul Newman&#x27;s character, Frank Capua, competes in a USAC Stock Car event on the road course.
After an insurance investigation of the pit out opening for the road course, which is located along the left lane wall of the drag strip, the insurance carrier demanded the pit out be closed off with a permanent concrete wall. This effectively meant closing the road course for competition purposes, as there is no other area on the current track layout suitable to relocate a viable pit lane. However, club racing and private testing used a section of track that runs parallel to the backstretch of the oval (Turns 6–8) as a makeshift pit, although enough section of the return road for the drag strip could also be used if realigned. The last SCCA club road race was held in 2007. The road course surface is in disrepair and very bumpy, and would need improvement to be of use again. There are plans to redesign and renovate the road course, but track officials say it is a long term goal.

In 2012, it was announced that the NASCAR Nationwide Series race at Lucas Oil Raceway would move to Indianapolis Motor Speedway as the Indiana 250 to replace the Kroger 200, and that it would be joined by Rolex Sports Car Series and Continental Tire Sports Car Challenge races under the banner &quot;Super Weekend at the Brickyard&quot;. The Camping World Truck Series event was replaced with a new event at Eldora Speedway. As a result, the ARCA Racing Series became the lone national stock car racing series to sanction a race at the track, running its own 200-lap event. NASCAR announced in September 2021 that the Truck Series would return to Lucas Oil Raceway in 2022 as the first playoff race, marking the return by NASCAR after an eleven year absence. On December 8, 2021, the track announced the track&#x27;s renaming to Lucas Oil Indianapolis Raceway Park.

<text>Blood Axis were an American band, made up of journalist and author Michael Moynihan, music producer Robert Ferbrache, and musician and author Annabel Lee.

==History==
===Early Blood Axis (1989–1999)===
Moynihan had founded Coup de Grace, a multimedia project that produced live performances and cassettes and also released booklets of images and texts, the last of which was Friedrich Nietzsche&#x27;s &quot;The Antichrist&quot;. The first output from the new appellation were two songs, &quot;Lord of Ages&quot; (employing lyrics from Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s poem on Mithras) and &quot;Electricity&quot;, which appeared on a German music sampler. These tracks were well received in Europe and were followed by two more songs that appeared on the compilation, &quot;Im Blutfeuer&quot;.

In 1995, Moynihan released the first full-length studio LP, &quot;The Gospel of Inhumanity&quot; with the help of Robert Ferbrache. The album wedded the music of Johann Sebastian Bach and Sergei Prokofiev with modern electronics. Moynihan implemented a recording of Ezra Pound reading from his &quot;The Cantos&quot;. He also included lyrics from Nietzsche and Longfellow as well as his own to the work.

The band consisted of Michael Moynihan (vocals, bodhrán), Annabelle Lee (melodeon, electric violin), and Robert Ferbrache (guitars, keyboards).

===Contemporary Blood Axis (2000–2016)===
In 2005, Blood Axis played the German &quot;Flammenzauber&quot; festival, showcasing reworked live versions of several previously released songs, a number of Irish folk songs, and the live debut of a few new songs. April 2006 saw further live activity from Blood Axis, as well as a new medium for the duo&#x27;s folk-oriented material entitled Knotwork at the Swiss Triumvirat festival.

Beginning in 1998, Moynihan began saying that Blood Axis was at work on a second full-length album, at one time said to be entitled &quot;Ultimacy&quot;. On 2 January 2009, Blood Axis played in Sintra, Portugal, with members of Portuguese band Sangre Cavallum. Moynihan stated on stage that the new album, now titled &quot;Born Again&quot;, was to be released the following Easter.

Blood Axis makes references to neopagan and &quot;völkisch&quot; concepts and figures such as Ludwig Fahrenkrog and Fidus. Moynihan is interested in rune mysticism. Beginning in the 2000s, he has been influenced by the neofascist movement &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; and Alain de Benoist.

<text>Baseball Digest is a baseball magazine resource, published in Orlando, Florida, by Grandstand Publishing, LLC. It is the longest running baseball magazine in the United States.

==History and profile==
The magazine was created in 1942 by Herbert F. Simons, a sportswriter for the &quot;Chicago Daily Times&quot;. Simons first published the magazine in August 1942, and served as its editor-in-chief until 1963. In 1981, Joan Whaley was published as its first female contributor.

After publishing on a 9 or 12 issue per year schedule, in 2009 the magazine was scaled back to six issues.

In March 2012, &quot;Baseball Digest&quot; merged with the professional scouting service ProScouts LLC. This relaunch included major changes to the magazine&#x27;s format, as it was published in full color for the first time and was made available in more locations.

Other current features include batting, pitching and fielding statistics, a &quot;fans speak out&quot; letters section, player profiles, quizzes, previews, rules reviews, a crossword puzzle, season-ending awards, and analysis of upcoming prospects.

In May 2018, Rick Cerrone, former Public Relations Director with the New York Yankees (and not to be confused with the Yankees catcher of a similar name), became the fourth editor in the magazine&#x27;s history. Cerrone was tasked with re-imagining the publication. Starting with the January/February 2019 issue, the magazine changed to a heavier paper stock and increased the number of pages.

On July 4, 2019, Grandstand Publishing, LLC, announced the introduction of BaseballDigestArchive.com, a web-based subscription service featuring every issue of Baseball Digest.

In May 2021, ProScouts LLC, headed by entrepreneur David Fagley, purchased the remaining outstanding shares held by long-time publisher Norman Jacobs, who remains as Publisher Emeritus.

<doc id="682956" wikidata="Q16897109" url="?curid=682956" title="St Thomas the Apostle, London">
<text>St Thomas the Apostle was a parish church in St Thomas Apostle Street in the City of London. In existence by the late twelfth century, it was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666 and not rebuilt.

==History==
The patronage of the church belonged to the canons of St Paul&#x27;s and it is mentioned in the register of the Dean and Chapter as early as 1181. John Stow implies that was rebuilt some time in the late fourteenth century, describing John Barnes, Lord Mayor in 1371 as &quot;a great builder of S. Thomas Apostles parish church as appeareth by his armes there both in stone and glasse&quot;.

The parish was staunchly Royalist in the years leading up to the Civil War In 1642, the rector, named Cooper, was sequestered and imprisoned in Leeds Castle owing to his loyalty to the king.

St Thomas&#x27; was destroyed by the Great fire in 1666. Following the fire, a Rebuilding Act was passed and a committee set up under Sir Christopher Wren to decide which buildings would be rebuilt. Fifty-one were chosen, but St Thomas the Apostle was not among those chosen. Instead, the parish was united with that of St Mary Aldermary. Part of the site was used for the creation of Queen Street, though a small portion of the churchyard survived.

The site of the church is marked by a plaque in Great St Thomas Apostle Street near Mansion House tube station.

Edmund Allen (died 1559), Bishop of Rochester, is said to have been buried in the church.

<text>Horse flies and deer flies are true flies in the family Tabanidae in the insect order Diptera. The adults are often large and agile in flight. Only females bite land vertebrates, including humans, to obtain blood. They prefer to fly in sunlight, avoiding dark and shady areas, and are inactive at night. They are found all over the world except for some islands and the polar regions (Hawaii, Greenland, Iceland). Both horse flies and botflies (Oestridae) are sometimes referred to as gadflies.

Adult horse flies feed on nectar and plant exudates; males have weak mouthparts, but females have mouthparts strong enough to bite large animals. This is for the purpose of obtaining enough protein from blood to produce eggs. The mouthparts of females are formed into a stout stabbing organ with two pairs of sharp cutting blades, and a spongelike part used to lap up the blood that flows from the wound. The larvae are predaceous and grow in semiaquatic habitats.

Female horse flies can transfer blood-borne diseases from one animal to another through their feeding habit. In areas where those diseases occur, they have been known to carry equine infectious anaemia virus, some trypanosomes, the filarial worm &quot;Loa loa&quot;, anthrax among cattle and sheep, and tularemia. They can reduce growth rates in cattle and lower the milk output of cows if suitable shelters are not provided.

Horse flies have appeared in literature ever since Aeschylus in Ancient Greece mentioned them driving people to &quot;madness&quot; through their persistent pursuit.

==Common names==

Tabanidae are known by a large number of common names. The subfamily Chrysopsinae is known as deer flies, perhaps because of their abundance on moorland where deer roam, and buffalo-flies, moose-flies and elephant-flies emanate from other parts of the world where these animals are found. The term &quot;horse-fly&quot; refers primarily to Tabaninae that are typically larger and stouter, and that lack the banded wings deer flies have. Other common names include tabanids, gadflies, green-headed flies, and green flies.

The word &quot;Tabanus&quot; was first recorded by Pliny the Younger and has survived as the generic name. In general, country folk did not distinguish between the various biting insects that irritated their cattle and called them all &quot;gad-flies&quot;, from the word &quot;gad&quot; meaning &quot;spike&quot;. Other common names include &quot;cleg[g]&quot;, &quot;gleg&quot; or &quot;clag&quot;, which come from Old Norse and may have originated from the Vikings. Other names such as &quot;stouts&quot; refer to the wide bodies of the insects and &quot;dun-flies&quot; to their sombre colouring. In Australia and the UK they are also known as March flies, a name used in other Anglophonic countries to refer to the non-bloodsucking Bibionidae.

==Description==

Adult tabanids are large flies with prominent compound eyes, short antennae composed of three segments, and wide bodies. In females, the eyes are widely separated; in males, however, they are almost touching. The eyes are often patterned and brightly coloured in living tabanids but appear dull in preserved specimens. The terminal segment of the antennae is pointed and annulated, appearing to be composed of several tapering rings. There are no hairs or arista stemming from the antennae. Both the head and thorax are clad in short hairs, but no bristles are on the body. The membranous forewings are clear, either shaded uniformly grey or brown, or patterned in some species; they have a basal lobe (or calypter) that covers the modified knob-like hindwings or halteres. The tips of the legs have two lobes on the sides (pulvilli) and a central lobe (empodium) in addition to two claws that enable them to grip to surfaces. Species recognition is based on details of head structures (antennae, frons, and maxillae), wing venation, and body patterning; minute variations of surface structure cause subtle alterations of the overlying hairs, which alters the appearance of the body.

Tabanid species range from medium-sized to very large, robust insects. Most have a body length between , with the largest having a wingspan of . Deer flies in the genus &quot;Chrysops&quot; are up to long, have yellow to black bodies and striped abdomens, and membranous wings with dark patches. Horse-flies (genus &quot;Tabanus&quot;) are larger, up to in length and are mostly dark brown or black, with dark eyes, often with a metallic sheen. Yellow flies (genus &quot;Diachlorus&quot;) are similar in shape to deer flies, but have yellowish bodies and the eyes are purplish-black with a green sheen. Some species in the subfamily Pangoniinae have an exceptionally long proboscis (tubular mouthpart).

The larvae are long and cylindrical or spindle-shaped with small heads and 12 body segments. They have rings of tubercles (warty outgrowths) known as pseudopods around the segments, and also bands of short setae (bristles). The posterior tip of each larva has a breathing siphon and a bulbous area known as Graber&#x27;s organ. The outlines of the adult insect&#x27;s head and wings are visible through the pupa, which has seven moveable abdominal segments, all except the front one of which bears a band of setae. The posterior end of the pupa bears a group of spine-like tubercles.

Some species, such as deer flies and the Australian March flies, are known for being extremely noisy during flight, though clegs, for example, fly quietly and bite with little warning. Tabanids are agile fliers; &quot;Hybomitra&quot; species have been observed to perform aerial manoeuvres similar to those performed by fighter jets, such as the Immelmann turn. Horseflies can lay claim to being the fastest flying insects; the male &quot;Hybomitra hinei wrighti&quot; has been recorded reaching speeds of up to when pursuing a female.

==Distribution and habitat==
Tabanids are found worldwide, except for the polar regions, but they are absent from some islands such as Greenland, Iceland, and Hawaii. The genera &quot;Tabanus&quot;, &quot;Chrysops&quot;, and &quot;Haematopota&quot; all occur in temperate, subtropical, and tropical locations, but &quot;Haematopota&quot; is absent from Australia and South America. They mostly occur in warm areas with suitable moist locations for breeding, but also occupy a wide range of habitats from deserts to alpine meadows. They are found from sea level to at least .

==Evolution and taxonomy==
The oldest records of the family come from the Early Cretaceous, with the oldest record being &quot;Eotabanoid,&quot; known from wings found in the Berriasian (145–140 million years ago) Purbeck Group of England. Although the bloodsucking habit is associated with a long proboscis, a fossil insect that has elongated mouthparts is not necessarily a bloodsucker, as it may instead have fed on nectar. The ancestral tabanids may have co-evolved with the angiosperm plants on which they fed. With a necessity for high-protein food for egg production, the diet of early tabanomorphs was probably predatory, and from this, the bloodsucking habit may have evolved. In the Santana Formation in Brazil, no mammals have been found, so the fossil tabanids found there likely fed on reptiles. Cold bloodsucking probably preceded warm bloodsucking, but some dinosaurs are postulated to have been warm-blooded and may have been early hosts for the horse-flies.

The Tabanidae are true flies and members of the insect order Diptera. With the families Athericidae, Pelecorhynchidae and Oreoleptidae, Tabanidae are classified in the superfamily Tabanoidea. Along with the Rhagionoidea, this superfamily makes up the infraorder Tabanomorpha. Tabanoid families seem to be united by the presence of a venom canal in the mandible of the larvae. Worldwide, about 4,455 species of Tabanidae have been described, over 1,300 of them in the genus &quot;Tabanus&quot;.

Tabanid identification is based mostly on adult morphological characters of the head, wing venation, and sometimes the last abdominal segment. The genitalia are very simple and do not provide clear species differentiation as in many other insect groups. In the past, most taxonomic treatments considered the family to be composed of three subfamilies: Pangoniinae (tribes Pangoniini, Philolichini, Scionini), Chrysopsinae (tribes Bouvieromyiini, Chrysopsini, Rhinomyzini), and Tabaninae (tribes Diachlorini, Haematopotini, Tabanini). Some treatments increased this to five subfamilies, adding the subfamily Adersiinae, with the single genus &quot;Adersia&quot;, and the subfamily Scepcidinae, with the two genera &quot;Braunsiomyia&quot; and &quot;Scepsis&quot;.A 2015 study by Morita et al. using nucleotide data, aimed to clarify the phylogeny of the Tabanidae and supports three subfamilies. The subfamilies Pangoniinae and Tabaninae were shown to be monophyletic. The tribes Philolichini, Chrysopsini, Rhinomyzini, and Haematopotini were found to be monophyletic, with the Scionini also being monophyletic apart from the difficult-to-place genus &quot;Goniops&quot;. &quot;Adersia&quot; was recovered within the Pangoniini as were the genera previously placed in the Scepcidinae, and &quot;Mycteromyia&quot; and &quot;Goniops&quot; were recovered within the Chrysopsini.
The Tabaninae lack ocelli (simple eyes) and have no spurs on the tips of their hind tibiae. In the Pangoniinae, ocelli are present and the antennal flagellum (whip-like structure) usually has eight annuli (or rings). In the Chrysopsinae, the antennal flagellum has a basal plate and the flagellum has four annuli. Females have a shining callus on the frons (front of the head between the eyes). The Adersiinae have a divided tergite on the ninth abdominal segment, and the Scepsidinae have highly reduced mouthparts. Members of the family Pelecorhynchidae were initially included in the Tabanidae and moved into the Rhagionidae before being elevated into a separate family. The infraorder Tabanomorpha shares the blood-feeding habit as a common primitive characteristic, although this is restricted to the female.

Two well-known genera are the common horse-flies, &quot;Tabanus&quot;, named by Swedish taxonomist Carl Linnaeus in 1758, and the deer flies, &quot;Chrysops&quot;, named by the German entomologist Johann Wilhelm Meigen in 1802. Meigen did pioneering research on flies and was the author of &quot;Die Fliegen&quot; (&quot;The Flies&quot;); he gave the name &quot;Haematopota&quot;, meaning &quot;blood-drinker&quot;, to another common genus of horse-flies.

==Biology==
===Diet and biting behavior===
Adult tabanids feed on nectar and plant exudates, and some are important pollinators of certain specialised flowers; several South African and Asian species in the Pangoniinae have spectacularly long probosces adapted for the extraction of nectar from flowers with long, narrow corolla tubes, such as &quot;Lapeirousia&quot;, and certain &quot;Pelargonium&quot;.

Both males and females engage in nectar-feeding, but females of most species are anautogenous, meaning they require a blood meal before they are able to reproduce effectively. To obtain the blood, the females, but not the males, bite animals, including humans. The female needs about six days to fully digest her blood meal and after that, she needs to find another host. The flies seem to be attracted to a potential victim by its movement, warmth, and surface texture, and by the carbon dioxide it breathes out. The flies mainly choose large mammals such as cattle, horses, camels, and deer, but few are species-specific. They have also been observed feeding on smaller mammals, birds, lizards, and turtles, and even on animals that have recently died. Unlike many biting insects such as mosquitoes, whose biting mechanism and saliva allow a bite to not be noticed by the host at the time, bites from tabanids are immediately irritating to the victim, so that they are often brushed off, and may have to visit multiple hosts to obtain sufficient blood. This behaviour means that they may carry disease-causing organisms from one host to another. Large animals and livestock are generally powerless to dislodge the fly, so there is no selective advantage for the flies to evolve a less immediately painful bite.
The mouthparts of females are of the usual dipteran form and consist of a bundle of six chitinous stylets that, together with a fold of the fleshy labium, form the proboscis. On either side of these are two maxillary palps. When the insect lands on an animal, it grips the surface with its clawed feet, the labium is retracted, the head is thrust downwards and the stylets slice into the flesh. Some of these have sawing edges and muscles can move them from side-to-side to enlarge the wound. Saliva containing anticoagulant is injected into the wound to prevent clotting. The blood that flows from the wound is lapped up by another mouthpart which functions as a sponge. Bites can be painful for a day or more; fly saliva may provoke allergic reactions such as hives and difficulty with breathing. Tabanid bites can make life outdoors unpleasant for humans, and can reduce milk output in cattle. They are attracted by polarized reflections from water, making them a particular nuisance near swimming pools. Since tabanids prefer to be in sunshine, they normally avoid shaded places such as barns, and are inactive at night.

Attack patterns vary with species; clegs fly silently and prefer to bite humans on the wrist or bare leg; large species of &quot;Tabanus&quot; buzz loudly, fly low, and bite ankles, legs, or backs of knees; &quot;Chrysops&quot; flies somewhat higher, bites the back of the neck, and has a high buzzing note. The striped hides of zebras may have evolved to reduce their attractiveness to horse-flies and tsetse flies. The closer together the stripes, the fewer flies are visually attracted; the zebra&#x27;s legs have particularly fine striping, and this is the shaded part of the body that is most likely to be bitten in other, unstriped equids. More recent research by the same lead author shows that the stripes were no less attractive to tabanids, but they merely touched—and could not make a controlled landing to bite. This suggests that a function of the stripes was interfering with optic flow.
This does not preclude the possible use of stripes for other purposes such as signaling or camouflage. Another disruptive mechanism may also be in play, however: a study comparing horse-fly behaviour when approaching horses wearing either striped or check-patterned rugs, when compared with plain rugs, found that both patterns were equally effective in deterring the insects.

===Reproduction===
Mating often occurs in swarms, generally at landmarks such as hilltops. The season, time of day, and type of landmark used for mating swarms are specific to particular species.

Eggs are laid on stones or vegetation near water, in clusters of up to 1000, especially on emergent water plants. The eggs are white at first but darken with age. They hatch after about six days, with the emerging larvae using a special hatching spike to open the egg case. The larvae fall into the water or onto the moist ground below. &quot;Chrysops&quot; species develop in particularly wet locations, while &quot;Tabanus&quot; species prefer drier places. The larvae are legless grubs, tapering at both ends. They have small heads and 11 or 13 segments and moult six to 13 times over the course of a year or more. In temperate species, the larvae have a quiescent period during winter (diapause), while tropical species breed several times a year. In the majority of species, they are white, but in some, they are greenish or brownish, and they often have dark bands on each segment. A respiratory siphon at the hind end allows the larvae to obtain air when submerged in water. Larvae of nearly all species are carnivorous, often cannibalistic in captivity, and consume worms, insect larvae, and arthropods. The larvae may be parasitized by nematodes, flies of the families Bombyliidae and Tachinidae, and Hymenoptera in the family Pteromalidae. When fully developed, the larvae move into drier soil near the surface of the ground to pupate. In dry places a &quot;remarkable&quot; adaptation was discovered in the 1920s by W.A. Lamborn in Malawi (then Nyasaland). The larvae were discovered to tunnel in a spiral motion while the mud was still wet and plastic, forming a partitioned cylinder in the center of which the larva settled to pupate after closing the entrance; this adaption protects the pupae against mudcracks when the mud dries up, as a spreading crack would change direction when it hit the wall of the cylinder.

The pupae are brown and glossy, rounded at the head end, and tapering at the other end. Wing and limb buds can be seen and each abdominal segment is fringed with short spines. After about two weeks, metamorphosis is complete, the pupal case splits along the thorax, and the adult fly emerges. Males usually appear first, but when both sexes have emerged, mating takes place, courtship starting in the air and finishing on the ground. The female needs to feed on blood before depositing her egg mass.

===Predators and parasites===

Eggs are often attacked by tiny parasitic wasps, and the larvae are consumed by birds, as well as being paratised by tachinid flies, fungi, and nematodes. Adults are eaten by generalized predators such as birds, and some specialist predators, such as the horse guard wasp (a bembicinid wasp), also preferentially attack horse-flies, catching them to provision their nests.

===As disease vectors===
Tabanids are known vectors for some blood-borne bacterial, viral, protozoan, and worm diseases of mammals, such as the equine infectious anaemia virus and various species of &quot;Trypanosoma&quot; which cause diseases in animals and humans. Species of the genus &quot;Chrysops&quot; transmit the parasitic filarial worm &quot;Loa loa&quot; between humans, and tabanids are known to transmit anthrax among cattle and sheep, and tularemia between rabbits and humans.

Blood loss is a common problem in some animals when large flies are abundant. Some animals have been known to lose up to of blood in a single day to tabanid flies, a loss which can weaken or even kill them. Anecdotal reports of bites leading to fatal anaphylaxis in humans have been made, an extremely rare occurrence.

===Management===
Control of tabanid flies is difficult. Malaise traps are most often used to capture them, and these can be modified with the use of baits and attractants that include carbon dioxide or octenol. A dark shiny ball suspended below them that moves in the breeze can also attract them and forms a key part of a modified &quot;Manitoba trap&quot; that is used most often for trapping and sampling the Tabanidae. Cattle can be treated with pour-on pyrethroids which may repel the flies, and fitting them with insecticide-impregnated eartags or collars has had some success in killing the insects.

==Bites==
Tabanid bites can be painful to humans. Usually, a weal (raised area of skin) occurs around the site; other symptoms may include urticaria (a rash), dizziness, weakness, wheezing, and angioedema (a temporary itchy, pink or red swelling occurring around the eyes or lips). A few people experience an allergic reaction. The National Health Service of the United Kingdom recommends that the site of the bite should be washed and a cold compress applied. Scratching the wound should be avoided at all times and an antihistamine preparation can be applied. In most cases, the symptoms subside within a few hours, but if the wound becomes infected, medical advice should be sought.

==In literature==

In &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;, which is attributed to the Athenian tragic playwright Aeschylus, a gadfly sent by Zeus&#x27;s wife Hera pursues and torments his mistress Io, who has been transformed into a cow and is watched constantly by the hundred eyes of the herdsman Argus: &quot;Io: Ah! Hah! Again the prick, the stab of gadfly-sting! O earth, earth, hide, the hollow shape—Argus—that evil thing—the hundred-eyed.&quot; William Shakespeare, inspired by Aeschylus, has Tom o&#x27; Bedlam in &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Whom the foul fiend hath led through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool, o&#x27;er bog and quagmire&quot;, driven mad by the constant pursuit. In &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, Shakespeare likens Cleopatra&#x27;s hasty departure from the Actium battlefield to that of a cow chased by a gadfly: &quot;The breeze [gadfly] upon her, like a cow in June / hoists sail and flies&quot;, where &quot;June&quot; may allude not only to the month but also to the goddess Juno, who torments Io, and the cow in turn may allude to Io, who is changed into a cow in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

The physician and naturalist Thomas Muffet wrote that the horse-fly &quot;carries before him a very hard, stiff, and well-compacted sting, with which he strikes through the Oxe his hide; he is in fashion like a great Fly, and forces the beasts for fear of him only to stand up to the belly in water, or else to betake themselves to wood sides, cool shades, and places where the wind blows through.&quot; The &quot;Blue Tail Fly&quot; in the eponymous song was probably the mourning horsefly (&quot;Tabanus atratus&quot;), a tabanid with a blue-black abdomen common to the southeastern United States.

Paul Muldoon’s chapbook Binge contains a poem &quot;Clegs and Midges&quot; which uses gadflies, real and metaphoric, &quot;cleg&quot; being a British term for the horse-fly.

In Norse mythology Loki took the form of a gadfly to hinder Brokkr during the manufacture of the hammer Mjölnir, weapon of Thor (Hammer of Thor).

<text>The Baggāra ( &quot;heifer herder&quot;), also known as Chadian Arabs, are a nomadic confederation of people of mixed Arab and Arabized indigenous African ancestry, inhabiting a portion of the Sahel mainly between Lake Chad and the Nile river near south Kordofan, numbering over six million. They are known as Baggara and Abbala in Sudan, and as Shuwa Arabs in Cameroon, Nigeria and Western Chad. The term Shuwa is said to be of Kanuri origin.

The Baggāra mostly speak their distinct dialect, known as Chadian Arabic. However the Baggāra of Southern Kordofan, due to contact with the sedentary population and the Sudanese Arab camel herders of Kordofan, has led to some Sudanese Arabic influence on the dialect of that zone. They also have a common traditional mode of subsistence, nomadic cattle herding, although nowadays many lead a settled existence. Nevertheless, collectively they do not all necessarily consider themselves one people, i.e., a single ethnic group. The term &quot;baggara culture&quot; was introduced in 1994 by Braukämper.

The political use of the term &quot;baggāra&quot; in Sudan is to denote a large group of closely related cattle-owning Arabic speaking tribes that reside traditionally in the Southern parts of Darfur and Kordofan who mixed extensively with the native people they live with in the region, in particular the Fur people, Nuba peoples and Fula people. The bulk of Baggara Arabs live in Chad and Sudan, with small minorities in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger, Central African Republic and South Sudan. Those who are still nomads migrate seasonally between grazing lands in the wet season and river areas in the dry season.

Their common language is known to academics by various names, such as Chadian Arabic, taken from the regions where the language is spoken. For much of the 20th century, this language was known to academics as &quot;Shuwa Arabic&quot;, but &quot;Shuwa&quot; is a geographically and socially parochial term that has fallen into disuse among linguists specializing in the language, who instead refer to it as &quot;Chadian Arabic&quot; depending on the origin of the native speakers being consulted for a given academic project.

== Origins and divisions ==

Like other Arabic speaking tribes in Sudan and the Sahel, Baggara tribes claim to have ancestry from the Juhaynah Arab tribe. They are of Arab and Arabized African ancestry. However the first documented evidence of Arab settlements in this region was in 1391 when the Mai, Kanuri title for King, of Bornu, Abu &#x27;Amr Uthman b. Idris sent a letter to the Mamluk Sultan, Barquq, complaining about the Judham and other Arabs raiding his territory and enslaving his subjects. The name of one of the major Baggara tribes is shared with an important sub-tribe of the Judham Arabs, the Beni Halba. Braukamper dates the formation of the Baggara culture to the 17th century in Wadai, between Bornu and Darfur, where Arabs, who were camel-herders, met the cattle-rearing Fula people migrating east, and out of this contact arose what Braukämper has coined an Arabic baggaara (cattle-herders&#x27;) culture which today extends from western Sudan (Kordofan and Darfur) into Nigeria (Borno). The Nigerian Arabs are the westernmost representation.

Baggara tribes in Sudan include: the Rizeigat, Ta’isha, Beni Halba, Habbaniya, Salamat, Messiria, Tarjam, and Beni Hussein in Darfur, and the Messiria Zurug, Messiria Humr, Hawazma, Habbaniya and Awlad Himayd in Kordofan, and the Beni Selam on the White Nile. The Messiria estimated at 515,000 people (2012 estimate) and the Rezeigat estimated at 299,000 people (2012 estimate) are probably the largest sub tribes of the Baggara in Sudan. There is also a small population of &quot;Shuwa Arabs&quot; from Chad who numbered 90,000 in Sudan according to a 2012 estimate.

The Messiria, one of the largest and most important tribes of the Baggara Arabs are found in Chad, Darfur and Kordofan in Sudan. They numbered 515,000 in Sudan according to a 2012 estimate. The bulk of the Messiria reside in East Kordofan and Chad with a comparatively smaller population in Darfur. In Darfur they are found mainly in Niteiga, an area north of Nyala. Besides the community of Messiria in Niteiga, there are several small Arab groups in Darfur that claim a connection with the Messiria, these are the Ta&#x27;alba, Sa&#x27;ada, Hotiyya, and Nei&#x27;mat. Along with these small groups should be included the Jebel &quot;Messiria&quot; community at Jebel Mun, in West Darfur, that speak a Nilo-Saharan language, Mileri, related to the Tama. The Mileri of Jebel Mun are traditionally not regarded as Arabs but their leaders have been stressing a Messiria Arab descent.

The Baggara tribes have camel-owning relatives, known as the Abbala. The Abbala tribes in Sudan mainly reside in North and West Darfur. The largest and the tribe most synonymous with the term Abbala are the Northern Rizeigat, which consists of 5 sections; the Mahamid, Mahariyya, Nuwaiba, Irayqat and Atayfat. Closely affiliated with them in Darfur are the Awlad Rashid tribe, who mostly live in Chad.

The small community of &quot;Baggara Arabs&quot;, they are in fact Abbala, that reside in the southeastern corner of Niger are known as Diffa Arabs for the Diffa Region. The majority migrated from Chad, initially due to the 1974 drought, with more coming in the 1980s because of the war in Chad. Most of the Diffa Arabs claim descent from the Mahamid clan of Sudan and Chad. 

==History==

After their defeat at the Battle of Karari in 1898, the remnants returned home to Darfur and Kordofan. Under the British system of indirect rule, each of the major Baggara tribes was ruled by its own paramount chief (&quot;nazir&quot;). Most of them were loyal members of the Umma Party, headed since the 1960s by Sadiq el Mahdi.

The main Baggara tribes of Darfur were awarded &quot;hawakir&quot; (land grants) by the Fur Sultans in the 1750s. As a result, the four largest Baggara tribes of Darfur—the Rizeigat, Habbaniya, Beni Halba and Ta’isha—have been only marginally involved in the Darfur conflict. However, the Baggara have been deeply involved in other conflicts in both Sudan and Chad. Starting in 1985, the Government of Sudan armed many of the local tribes among them the Rizeigat of south Darfur and the Messiria and Hawazma of neighboring Kordofan as militia to fight a proxy war against the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army in their areas. They formed frontline units as well as &quot;Muraheleen&quot;, mounted raiders that attacked southern villages to loot valuables and slaves.
The Baggara people (and subgroups) were armed by the Sudanese government to participate in the counterinsurgency against the Sudanese People’s Liberation Army. The first attacks against villages by the Baggara were staged in the Nuba Mountains. The Sudanese government promoted attacks by promising the Baggara people no interference so they could seize animals and land. They formed the precursors to the Janjaweed - an infamous para-military.

During the Second Sudanese Civil War thousands of Dinka women and children were abducted and subsequently enslaved by members of the Missiriya and Rezeigat tribes. An unknown number of children from the Nuba tribe were similarly abducted and enslaved. In Darfur, a Beni Halba militia force was organized by the government to defeat an SPLA force led by Daud Bolad in 1990–91. However, by the mid-1990s the various Baggara groups had mostly negotiated local truces with the SPLA forces. The leaders of the major Baggara tribes declared that they had no interest in joining the fighting.

<text>The Central Bohemian Region ( ; ) is an administrative unit () of the Czech Republic, located in the central part of its historical region of Bohemia. Its administrative centre is in the Czech capital Prague, which lies in the centre of the region. However, the city is not part of it but is a region of its own.

The Central Bohemian Region is in the centre of Bohemia. In terms of area, it is the largest region in the Czech Republic, with 11,014 km2, almost 14% of the total area of the country. It surrounds the country&#x27;s capital, Prague, and borders Liberec Region (in the north), Hradec Králové Region (northeast), Pardubice Region (east), Vysočina Region (southeast), South Bohemian Region (south), Plzeň Region (west) and Ústí nad Labem Region (northwest).

==Geography==
With an area of 11,014 km2, the Central Bohemian Region is the largest region of the Czech Republic, occupying 14% of its total area. The region has relatively diversified terrain. The highest point of the region is located on Tok hill (865 m) in Brdy Highlands in the southwestern part of the region. The lowest point of the region is situated on the water surface of the Elbe River (Czech: Labe) near Dolní Beřkovice.

The region is divided into two landscape types. The northeastern part is formed by the Polabí lowlands with a high share of land being used for agricultural purposes and deciduous forests. The south-western part of the region is hilly with coniferous and mixed forests.

Important rivers in the region are Labe, Vltava, Berounka, Jizera and Sázava. On the Vltava river, a series of nine dams (Czech: Vltavská kaskáda) was constructed throughout the 20th century.

The agricultural land accounts for 83.5% of all land in the region, which 11p.p. more than the national average. The highest share of the agricultural land can be found in Polabí, especially in Kolín and Nymburk districts.

There are a number of landscape parks located in the region. Křivoklátsko is the largest and most important landscape park in the region, being at the same time a UNESCO Biosphere Reservation. Another remarkable area is the Bohemian Karst, the largest karst area in the Czech republic, where the Koněprusy Caves (Czech: Koněpruské jeskyně) are located. Finally, a large part of Kokořínsko Landscape Park is situated in the Central Bohemian Region.

=== Administrative divisions ===
The Central Bohemian Region is divided into 12 districts:

Příbram District is the region&#x27;s largest district in terms of area (15% of the total region&#x27;s area), while Prague-West District is the smallest one (5%). In 2019, the region counted in total 1,144 municipalities, of which 26 were municipalities with a delegated municipal office; 1,028 municipalities had fewer than 2,000 inhabitants and they accounted for 41% of the total population of the region. Eighty-two municipalities had a status of town.

== Population ==
As of January 1, 2024 the Central Bohemian Region had 1,455,940 inhabitants and was the most populous region in the country. About 53% of the inhabitants lived in towns or cities. This is the lowest proportion among the regions of the Czech Republic.

Since the second half of the 1990s the areas surrounding Prague have been significantly influenced by suburbanization. High numbers of young people have moved to the region and since 2006 the region has been experiencing a natural population growth. As of 2024, the average age in the region is 41.5 years, the lowest number among the regions in the Czech Republic.

The table shows cities and towns in the region that had more than 10,000 inhabitants (as of January 1, 2024):

== Economy ==

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 24.1 billion € in 2018, accounting for 11.6% of Czech economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 25,300 € or 82% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 84% of the EU average, which makes Central Bohemia one of the wealthiest regions in the Czech Republic. Six out of ten employees in the region work in the tertiary sector and the share of this sector on the total employment has been increasing over time. On the other hand, the share of primary and secondary sector has been decreasing. The unemployment rate in the region is in the long-term lower than the national average. As of December 31, 2012 the registered unemployment rate was 7.07%. However, there were considerable differences in the unemployment rate within the region. The lowest unemployment rate was in Prague-East District (3.35%) while the highest in Příbram District (10.10%). The average wage in the region in 2012 was CZK 24,749 (approximately EUR 965).

=== Industry ===
The most important branches of industry in the region are mechanical engineering, chemical industry and food industry. Other significant industries are glass production, ceramics and printing. On the other hand, some traditional industries such as steel industry, leather manufacturing and coal mining have been declining in the recent period.

In 2006, 237 industrial companies with 100 or more employees were active in the region. A car manufacturer ŠKODA AUTO a.s. Mladá Boleslav became a company of nationwide importance. Another car manufacturer which is active in the region is TPCA Czech, s.r.o. in Kolín.

=== Agriculture ===
The north-eastern part of the region has very favourable conditions for agriculture. The agriculture in the region is oriented especially in crop farming, namely the production of wheat, barley, sugar beet and in suburban areas also fruit farming, vegetable growing and floriculture. Since the beginning of the 1990s the employment in agriculture, forestry and fishing has been decreasing.

=== Transport ===
The region has an advantageous position thanks to its proximity to the capital. A significant proportion of region&#x27;s population commutes daily to Prague for work or to schools. Compared to other regions, the Central Bohemian region has the densest (and the most overloaded) transport network. The roads and railways connecting the capital with other regions all cross the Central Bohemian region.

== Tourism==
Central Bohemia official tourist board is based in Husova street 156/21 Prague 1 Old Town. The official website of Central Bohemia is www.centralbohemia.eu (Currently under reconstruction). There are also social pages on.

<doc id="682985" wikidata="Q1252953" url="?curid=682985" title="Dover Motor Speedway">
<text>Dover Motor Speedway (formerly known as the Dover International Speedway from 2002 to 2021 and as the Dover Downs International Speedway from 1969 to 2001) is a oval track in Dover, Delaware, hosting major events since 1969, including NASCAR and IndyCar races. It has a 54,000-seat capacity as of 2022. Adjacent to Bally&#x27;s Dover, which owns the surrounding property, the speedway itself is owned by Speedway Motorsports (SMI) and managed by Mike Tatoian.

The track opened in 1969 as a combined horse and auto racing facility under the control of David P. Buckson, then-Attorney General of Delaware. The facility, particularly its horse racing endeavors, quickly faced financial troubles but was sustained by its NASCAR events and financial support from then-owner John W. Rollins. Expansion took place in the 1980s and 1990s, spurred by the rise in popularity of NASCAR in the 1980s and the legalization of slot machines in Delaware in the mid-1990s. In 2002, ownership was split, with Dover Motorsports taking over the auto racing oval. Following the Great Recession in the late 2000s, the track downsized. In 2021, SMI acquired Dover Motorsports.

Dover Motor Speedway (DMS) in its current form is measured at , with 24° of banking in the turns and 9° of banking on the track&#x27;s straightaways. Located within the Dover Motor Speedway a horse racing track that is currently part of Bally&#x27;s Dover, which is not owned by Speedway Motorsports; it is instead owned by Gaming and Leisure Properties and operated by the Bally&#x27;s Corporation. 

=== Amenities ===
Dover Motor Speedway is located in Dover, Delaware, and is served by U.S. Route 13 and Delaware Route 1. As of 2022, the track has a permanent seating capacity of 54,000 according to &quot;The News Journal&quot;. In addition to seating, approximately 3,000 spots dedicated to camping are also available according to a 2023 &quot;Delaware Business Times&quot; report, including overnight camping as of 2025. At its peak, DMS had a capacity of 140,000 according to a 2005 &quot;News Journal&quot; article.

==== Miles the Monster ====
Miles the Monster has served as DMS&#x27; official mascot since 2000. The description of Miles the Monster has drawn comparisons by &quot;Roadside America&quot; to The Thing and the Hulk, and was inspired by the &quot;theme of concrete&quot; according to Joe Heller, a former DMS PR worker. Miles was first introduced in 1993 as a tyrannosaurus rex, and was later re-introduced in 2000 in its current form. In 2008, the Monster Monument, a statue of Miles the Monster, was erected to honor past winners at DMS.

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===

On June 18, 1967, David P. Buckson, the Attorney General of Delaware, announced intentions of building a horse racing facility near U.S. Route 13 named Delaware Downs. In initial plans, the track had a projected cost of $1.5 million (adjusted for inflation, $), with amenities including 10,000 seats and a clubhouse, with room to expand to include a future convention center. The plan received mostly positive reception from the Delaware General Assembly, with local lawmakers favoring changing laws in order to legally build the track. After Buckson&#x27;s bill, known as Senate Bill 201, initially experienced a delay in consideration, S.B. 201 was passed through both branches of the General Assembly on July 18 and signed into law by Delaware Governor Charles L. Terry Jr. eight days later. By September, Buckson was able to purchase just under $2 million worth of land to acquire approximately of land to construct the facility.

Construction of the facility began in October, with plans expanded to include a auto racing oval around the horse racing track. However, a steel truckers&#x27; strike and picketing delayed the grandstand construction. Originally set to open on March 1, 1968, the facility&#x27;s debut was postponed to March 14 at the request of Buckson, who wanted to avoid competing with Georgetown Raceway. Although the facility was initially set to open on March 1, 1968, Further delays came in the following year February, with the opening rescheduled to early April due to the ongoing strike and a winter storm. 

By April, construction completion was moved to August, and in June, multiple liens totaling at least $286,500 were filed against Dover Downs. To address these financial issues, Buckson partnered with John W. Rollins and Melvin J. Joseph to secure a $3 million financing plan, with Rollins as the primary backer and Joseph overseeing construction. This allowed the group to pay off the liens by July, and the opening was finally rescheduled for March 8, 1969. In February, Dover Downs received its horse racing license from the Delaware Racing Commission.
=== Early years and financial troubles ===
After a year of construction delays, the $5.2 million facility held its first horse races on March 8, 1969, with Pinehurst and jockey Fred Kratz winning the first ever horse race at the Dover Downs Raceway (DDR). The following month, Dover Downs was able to secure its first auto racing dates, with the NASCAR Grand National Series scheduling a race on July 6. By the end of its first horse racing season in May, the facility received mixed reception from local press; in responding to rumors that track leaders would abandon horse racing, Buckson stated to &quot;The Morning News&quot; that they were &quot;ridiculous. We&#x27;ll be back here next year ready to go again.&quot; The auto racing oval, named Dover Downs International Raceway (DDIS), held its first races as scheduled, with Richard Petty winning the 1969 Mason-Dixon 300; the race oversaw fewer fans and traffic problems than expected. In June 1970, DDIS underwent its first repave at the cost of $50,000 (adjusted for inflation, $).

In its early years, Dover Downs struggled financially. By July 1969, liens totaling over $950,000 were filed against the facility. In April 1970, McNutt Electric Company, one of the lienholders, sued Dover Downs for unpaid bills. By August, Dover Downs settled the liens, paying $965,000 in total. In 1973, it faced a near-boycott by the Cloverleaf Standardbred Owners Association, who demanded an 8% purse increase and new paddock facilities. Although track leaders initially refused due to costs, an agreement was eventually reached. With attendance below expectations in early 1974, track general manager John Riddle acknowledged the facility&#x27;s financial difficulties, stating that &quot;I must admit that we are in a serious financial situation... I know we can&#x27;t continue to operate in a deficit situation.&quot; Buckson proposed dog racing and a tax relief bill to improve finances in January 1974; although the House approved the bill, it was vetoed by Sherman W. Tribbitt. In August, Buckson&#x27;s salary was cut, and he was reassigned as chairman, with Riddle stepping in as president. In September, Riddle announced Dover Downs was for sale but denied impending bankruptcy. Despite DDR&#x27;s issues, DDIS remained profitable, with &quot;The Morning News&quot; noting that auto racing was unaffected by the complex&#x27;s financial troubles.

In 1975, a tax break bill passed to assist Dover Downs if it resumed thoroughbred racing, easing some financial pressure. However, a year later, auditors found Dover Downs owed $49,000 (adjusted for inflation, $) in unpaid admission taxes. In the winter of 1977, attendance dropped 16% due to new horse racing tracks. Later that year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated possible race-fixing at the track. After Governor Pete du Pont vetoed an initial tax break bill in October, another bill was proposed, this time with state officials involved. Du Pont agreed to sign it only if he could release Dover Downs&#x27; financial records, which the track’s owner, Riddle, had previously refused. In a controversial decision, du Pont approved the $500,000 (adjusted for inflation, $) annual tax break on February 21. Despite this, Riddle later admitted the track would still see a small loss. In April 1979, Riddle resigned to join NASCAR as their executive vice president. Riddle maintained that he thought the track was in a stable financial state, proclaiming that &quot;I really believe that this racetrack is solid and will continue to be so for many years&quot;. However, owner John W. Rollins said he hadn’t made a profit on the track, noting his financial support had kept it afloat.

=== Denis McGlynn era, Dover Downs expansion ===

==== DDIS&#x27; mass expansion ====
In November 1979, director of operations Denis McGlynn was named as Riddle&#x27;s replacement for president of Dover Downs. Heading into the 1980s, the facility experienced continued financial woes, with McGlynn reporting &quot;significant&quot; losses since 1981 in a March 1983 interview. In September 1982, Rollins offered the city of Dover to purchase the entirety of Dover Downs for $5 million (adjusted for inflation, $). Later that year, DDR underwent renovations, adding betting windows and color televisions. In April 1983, McGlynn tried to negotiate with the city to lower the buying cost of Dover Downs to $1.9 million; however, the proposal was rejected. Attendance at DDR also continued to drop with the construction of Rosecroft Raceway in 1984, with the track reporting an over 10% decrease in average attendance from the previous year. Later that year in May, in response to rising attendance and subsequent complaints about a lack of seating at DDIS, McGlynn announced a long-term expansion plan to retain its NASCAR races. Two years later, DDIS underwent a repave after complaints from NASCAR drivers and crew chiefs. The repave process started in May and was completed by September of that year, costing approximately $500,000.

Starting in the mid-1980s, Dover Downs International Speedway expanded drastically. In 1986 and 1987, 3,200 new seats were added for each year. The following year, 5,100 seats added near Dover Downs International Speedway&#x27;s main grandstand were added, increasing seating capacity to 41,000. In March 1989, the addition of both of a new media center and 5,100 seats was completed, with a further 3,800 seats being announced. By the end of the decade, renovations were made to victory lane, restrooms, pit road, and the garages. In April 1991, a 5,383-seat grandstand was erected overseeing the track&#x27;s fourth turn. Further expansions of 5,000, 4,750, 6,650, and 6,950 seats were approved by the Dover Planning Commission in 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, respectively, increasing capacity to 73,502. In November 1994, alongside further construction of an additional 7,050 seats, track officials announced a $1.8 million complete repaving of DDIS&#x27; track surface, this time replacing the traditional asphalt surface with concrete. Paving started in November and was completed in March 1995. In October 1996, the city of Dover approved a master plan to allow the track to build 73,178 additional seats over the course of seven years, with the plan increasing capacity to 170,000. However, by 2005, only 140,000 seats were installed.

==== McGlynn&#x27;s fight for legalization of slot machines in Delaware, subsequent DDR recovery and hotel construction ====
In contrast, Dover Downs Raceway, alongside the state of Delawarean horse racing, oversaw heavy turmoil in the late 1980s and most of the 1990s. In 1989, alongside other horse racing tracks in Delaware, McGlynn started to advocate publicly for the legalization of slot machines in the state of Delaware. A bill to legalize slot machines in Delaware, H.B. 297, was passed by both chambers of the Delaware Legislature by June 30. However, then-Delaware Governor Mike Castle vetoed the bill in the summer of the same year. Five years later, despite threats of another veto from Castle&#x27;s successor Tom Carper, another push for legalization was made in early 1994 after the closure of Brandywine Raceway in 1990 and further economic turmoil due to H.B. 297&#x27;s veto. Another bill, H.B. 443, was passed by June 1994 by both chambers but was again vetoed; however, Carper stated that he was open to compromise. A rewritten bill, H.B. 628 that allowed the state to take a bigger share of profits and required slot machines to be relicensed every four years, was passed by both chambers, with Carper allowing the bill to become law without his signature. 

Although McGlynn initially stating that he would not install slot machines due to a lack of profit for Dover Downs, Rollins was able to convince McGlynn otherwise, with plans to install 500 machines in March 1995. However, the installation was delayed by months, with test runs not occurring until December 22 and the official opening occurring seven days later. In the first months of slot machines, Dover Downs and Delaware Park Racetrack both oversaw increased profit, with Dover Downs expanding their number of slot machines to 1,000 to accommodate increased demand. By November 1996, $800,000 worth of renovations were invested into a reinvigorated and financially stable DDR, with McGlynn praising Rollins in a &quot;News Journal&quot; interview. In March 1999, a expansion to increase the amount of slot machines to 1,568 was completed.

Discussions on building a hotel to make Dover Downs an &quot;entertainment destination&quot; were recorded as far back as March 1998, with McGlynn stating that building a hotel &quot;would make sense&quot;. On August 25, 1999, the &quot;News Journal&quot; reported that Dover Downs Entertainment had submitted plans for a 520-room four star hotel to the Dover Planning Commission for approval, with construction taking place in two 260-room phases if approved. The hotel was approved on September 20. The first phase of the hotel was scheduled to open on February 8, 2002; although it did open on time, the opening was affected by a flood on the top floor of the hotel caused by an open pipe. 

=== Post-Dover Downs split ===

In July 2001, McGlynn stated hopes to separate Dover Downs&#x27; auto racing business and its horse racing and casino business as two separate companies, with the casino and horse racing facilities being named under Dover Downs Gaming &amp; Entertainment. The split was completed in April 2002, with the auto racing facility now being owned by Dover Motorsports, Inc. As part of the split, the auto racing facility changed its name to Dover International Speedway (DIS). In 2004, DIS started the process of installing of SAFER barriers to increase track safety. The project was faced with engineering difficulties but was eventually completed in time for the 2005 MBNA RacePoints 400. In May 2006, McGlynn announced a five-year renovation plan for DIS, focused on expanding amenities around the track&#x27;s property along with expanding the width of DIS&#x27; pit road. The project was split into three phases. The first phase of the project was completed in time for the 2007 Autism Speaks 400, with additional parking and luxury seating options being constructed. Phase two was completed by the running of the 2008 Camping World RV 400, which included the construction of a monument honoring past winners at DIS alongside an expanded fan zone. Phase three of the project, an extension of the track&#x27;s pit road, was completed by the 2009 Autism Speaks 400, extending it by . In 2014, Mike Tatoian, chief operating officer of Dover Motorsports, was assigned to replace McGlynn as president of DIS, with McGlynn remaining as the president of Dover Motorsports. The following year, track developers spent $2.9 million to install a new, catchfence to replace the track&#x27;s old catchfence.

==== Capacity decline, change in ownership ====
Starting in the late 2000s, DIS oversaw capacity and economic decline. In May 2009, seating capacity was decreased by approximately 7,000. By 2011, attendance at DIS&#x27; NASCAR Cup Series races had dropped to under 90,000, over 50,000 less than what attendance was at its peak; the drop was blamed on economic effects of the Great Recession. In 2012, developers initiated a seat-widening plan, with capacity decreasing from 132,000 to 113,000. By the 2015 FedEx 400, DIS decreased seating capacity to 95,500 in response to further attendance downturn at DIS. A further 10,500 seats were torn down in time for the 2017 AAA 400 Drive for Autism, resetting the capacity to 85,000. Two years later, in response to a further decline of demand according to McGlynn, seating capacity was dropped to 54,000. 

In May 2019, DIS began work on a $5.5 million project focused on expanding its garage surface area by 20%; the project was completed in time for the 2019 Drydene 400. In December 2021, ownership of the track changed hands when Dover Motorsports was bought out by Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI) for $131.5 million. As part of the purchase, the track&#x27;s name changed to Dover Motor Speedway. 

== Events ==

=== Racing ===

==== NASCAR ====
As of 2024, DMS holds one annual NASCAR weekend, currently known as the Autotrader EchoPark Automotive 400 for sponsorship reasons. For most of its history, DMS held two annual weekends: one in the spring and one in the fall. The former was first run in 1969 to christen the auto racing oval. The latter was first run in 1971, and was run annually until 2021, when its race date was shifted to the Nashville Superspeedway. Along with its Cup Series races, DMS also hosts lower-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series races as a support event for the Cup Series. 

==== Other racing events ====
In 1969, DMS ran a one-off United States Auto Club (USAC) open-wheel event, with Art Pollard winning the event. While a 10-year deal was signed with USAC in 1970, the race was cancelled that same year due to complaints from driver Mike Mosley that the track was unsafe after Mosley ran tests at the facility. 

Starting in 1998, the facility ran Indy Racing League (IRL) races. However, after one more iteration in 1999, the race was scrapped heading into the new millennium, with poor attendance being cited as the main reason for the failure to renew.

=== Non-racing events ===

* Starting in 2012, the Firefly Music Festival was held at DMS. With one exception in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was held annually until 2023, when the event went on hiatus.
* Since 2022, the facility has hosted &quot;Gift of Lights&quot;, a drive-thru Christmas lights display that features 3.5 million total Christmas lights during the Christmas season.

<doc id="682987" wikidata="Q523231" url="?curid=682987" title="Whale vocalization">
<text>Whales use a variety of sounds for communication and sensation. The mechanisms used to produce sound vary from one family of cetaceans to another. Marine mammals, including whales, dolphins, and porpoises, are much more dependent on sound than land mammals due to the limited effectiveness of other senses in water. Sight is less effective for marine mammals because of the way particulates in the ocean scatter light. Smell is also limited, as molecules diffuse more slowly in water than in air, which makes smelling less effective. However, the speed of sound is roughly four times greater in water than in the atmosphere at sea level. As sea mammals are so dependent on hearing to communicate and feed, environmentalists and cetologists are concerned that they are being harmed by the increased ambient noise in the world&#x27;s oceans caused by ships, sonar and marine seismic surveys.

The word &quot;song&quot; is used to describe the pattern of regular and predictable sounds made by some species of whales, notably the humpback whale. This is included with or in comparison with music, and male humpback whales have been described as &quot;inveterate composers&quot; of songs that are &quot;&#x27;strikingly similar&#x27; to human musical traditions&quot;. This position has been complicated by more recent research, however. It has been suggested that humpback songs communicate male fitness to female whales.

== Types and purpose of vocalization ==
While the complex sounds of the humpback whale (and some blue whales) are believed to be primarily used in sexual selection, there are simpler sounds that are created by other species of whales that have an alternative use and are used all year round. Whale watchers have watched mother whales lift their young towards the surface in a playful motion, while making a noise that resembles cooing in humans. This cooing-like noise made by whales seems designed to relax their young and is one of several distinct everyday noises whales are known to make. Unlike some fish such as sharks, a toothed whale&#x27;s sense of smell is absent, causing them to rely heavily on echolocation, both for hunting prey and for navigating the ocean under darkness. This requires the whales to produce noise year round to ensure they are able to navigate around any obstacles they may face such as sunken ships or other animals.

It has also been proven that whales are extremely social creatures. The noises that are made throughout the entire year (the main sounds being whistles, clicks, and pulsed calls) are used to communicate with other members of their pod. Each sound a whale makes could mean something different. The clicking noises whales make are used for navigation.   

The question of whether whales sometimes sing purely for aesthetic enjoyment, personal satisfaction, or &#x27;for art&#x27;s sake&#x27;, is considered by some to be &quot;an untestable question&quot;.

=== Song of the humpback whale ===

Interest in whale song was aroused by researchers Katy and Roger Payne as well as Scott McVay after the songs were brought to their attention by a Bermudian named Frank Watlington who was working for the US government at the SOFAR station listening for Russian submarines with underwater hydrophones off the coast of the island. The Paynes released the best-selling &quot;Songs of the Humpback Whale&quot; in 1970, and the whale songs were quickly incorporated into human music by, among others, singer Judy Collins, as well as George Crumb, Paul Winter, and David Rothenberg.

The humpback whale produces a series of repetitious sounds at varying frequencies known as whale song. Marine biologist Philip Clapham describes the song as &quot;probably the most complex in the animal kingdom.&quot;

Male humpback whales perform these vocalizations often during the mating season, and so it was initially believed the purpose of songs is to aid mate selection. However, no evidence was found that links these songs to reprosexuality.

The songs follow a distinct hierarchical structure. The base units of the song (sometimes loosely called the &quot;notes&quot;) are single uninterrupted emissions of sound that last up to a few seconds. These sounds vary in frequency from 20 Hz to upward of 24 kHz (the typical human range of hearing is 20 Hz to 20 kHz). The units may be frequency modulated (i.e., the pitch of the sound may go up, down, or stay the same during the note) or amplitude modulated (get louder or quieter). However, the adjustment of bandwidth on a spectrogram representation of the song reveals the essentially pulsed nature of the FM sounds.

A collection of four or six units is known as a sub-phrase, lasting perhaps ten seconds (see also phrase (music)). A collection of two sub-phrases is a phrase. A whale will typically repeat the same phrase over and over for two to four minutes. This is known as a theme. A collection of themes is known as a song. The whale song will last up to 30 or so minutes, and will be repeated over and over again over the course of hours or even days. This &quot;Russian doll&quot; hierarchy of sounds suggests a syntactic structure that is more human-like in its complexity than other forms of animal communication like bird songs, which have only linear structure.

All the whales in an area sing virtually the same song at any point in time and the song is constantly and slowly evolving over time. For example, over the course of a month a particular unit that started as an upsweep (increasing in frequency) might slowly flatten to become a constant note. Another unit may get steadily louder. The pace of evolution of a whale&#x27;s song also changes—some years the song may change quite rapidly, whereas in other years little variation may be recorded.

Whales occupying the same geographical areas (which can be as large as entire ocean basins) tend to sing similar songs, with only slight variations. Whales from non-overlapping regions sing entirely different songs.

As the song evolves, it appears that old patterns are not revisited. An analysis of 19 years of whale songs found that while general patterns in song could be spotted, the same combination never recurred.

Humpback whales may also make stand-alone sounds that do not form part of a song, particularly during courtship rituals. Finally, humpbacks make a third class of sound called the feeding call. This is a long sound (5 to 10 s duration) of near constant frequency. Humpbacks generally feed cooperatively by gathering in groups, swimming underneath shoals of fish and all lunging up vertically through the fish and out of the water together. Prior to these lunges, whales make their feeding call. The exact purpose of the call is not known.

Some scientists have proposed that humpback whale songs may serve an echolocative purpose, but this has been subject to disagreement.

=== Other whale sounds ===
Humpback whales have also been found to make a range of other social sounds to communicate such as &quot;grunts&quot;, &quot;groans&quot;, &quot;thwops&quot;, &quot;snorts&quot; and &quot;barks&quot;.

In 2009, researchers found that blue whale song has been deepening in its tonal frequency since the 1960s. While noise pollution has increased ambient ocean noise by over 12 decibels since the mid-20th century, researcher Mark McDonald indicated that higher pitches would be expected if the whales were straining to be heard.

Killer whales have been observed to produce long range calls that are stereotyped and high frequency travelling distances from as well as short range calls that can travel distances from . Short range calls are reported during social and resting periods while long range are more commonly reported during foraging and feeding.

Most other whales and dolphins produce sounds of varying degrees of complexity. Of particular interest is the Beluga (the &quot;sea canary&quot;) which produces an immense variety of whistles, clicks and pulses.

It was previously thought that most baleen whales make sounds at about 15–20 hertz. However, a team of marine biologists, led by Mary Ann Daher of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, reported in &quot;New Scientist&quot; in December 2004 that they had been tracking a whale in the North Pacific for 12 years that was &quot;singing&quot; at 52 Hz. Scientists have been unable to explain this phenomenon. 52 Hz is a very low sound, it is audible through human ears as a low moaning sound. It was not expected that this whale was a new species, more so this whale indicated that a currently known species potentially has a much wider vocal range than previously thought. There is disagreement in the scientific community regarding the uniqueness of the whale&#x27;s vocalization and whether it is a member of a hybrid whale such as the well documented blue and fin whale hybrids.

== Mechanisms of sound production ==
Humans produce voiced sounds by passing air through the larynx. Within the larynx, when the vocal cords are brought close together, the passing air will force them to alternately close and open, separating the continuous airstream into discrete pulses of air that are heard as a vibration. This vibration is further modified by speech organs in the oral and nasal cavities, creating sounds which are used in human speech.

Cetacean sound production differs markedly from this mechanism. The precise mechanism differs in the two suborders of cetaceans: the &quot;Odontoceti&quot; (toothed whales, including dolphins) and the &quot;Mysticeti&quot; (baleen whales, including the largest whales such as the blue whale).

===Odontocete whales ===
Odontocetes produce rapid bursts of high-frequency clicks that are thought to be primarily for echolocation. Specialized organs in an odontocete produce collections of clicks and buzzes at frequencies from 0.2 to 150 kHz to obtain sonic information about its environment. Lower frequencies are used for distance echolocation, due to the fact that shorter wavelengths do not travel as far as longer wavelengths underwater. Higher frequencies are more effective at shorter distances, and can reveal more detailed information about a target. Echoes from clicks convey not only the distance to the target, but also the size, shape, speed, and vector of its movement. Additionally, echolocation allows the odontocete to easily discern the difference between objects that are different in material composition, even if visually identical, by their different densities. Individuals also appear to be able to isolate their own echoes during pod feeding activity without interference from other pod members&#x27; echolocations.

Whistles are used for communication. Four- to six-month-old calves develop unique sounds that they use most frequently throughout their lives. Such &quot;signature whistles&quot; are distinctive to the individual and may serve as a form of identification among other odontocetes. Though a large pod of dolphins will produce a wide range of different noises, very little is known about the meaning of the sound. Frankel quotes one researcher who says listening to a school of odontocetes is like listening to a group of children at a school playground.

The multiple sounds odontocetes make are produced by passing air through a structure in the head called the phonic lips. Biologically the structure is homologous to an upper lip located in the nasal cavity, but mechanistically the phonic lips act similarly to human vocal &quot;cords&quot; (vocal folds), which in humans are located in the larynx. As the air passes through this narrow passage, the phonic lip membranes are sucked together, causing the surrounding tissue to vibrate. These vibrations can, as with the vibrations in the human larynx, be consciously controlled with great sensitivity. The vibrations pass through the tissue of the head to the melon, which shapes and directs the sound into a beam of sound useful in echolocation. Every toothed whale except the sperm whale has two sets of phonic lips and is thus capable of making two sounds independently. Once the air has passed the phonic lips it enters the vestibular sac. From there, the air may be recycled back into the lower part of the nasal complex, ready to be used for sound creation again, or passed out through the blowhole.

The French name for phonic lips, &quot;museau de singe&quot;, translates literally as &quot;monkey&#x27;s muzzle&quot;, which the phonic lip structure is supposed to resemble in sperm whales. New cranial analysis using computed axial and single photon emission computed tomography scans in 2004 showed, at least in the case of bottlenose dolphins, that air might be supplied to the nasal complex from the lungs, enabling the sound creation process to continue for as long as the dolphin can add air from the lungs.

====Sperm whale====

The sperm whale&#x27;s vocalizations are all based on clicking, described in four types: the usual echolocation, creaks, codas, and slow clicks. The most distinctive vocalizations are codas, which are short rhythmic sequences of clicks, mostly numbering 3–12 clicks, in stereotyped patterns. They are the result of vocal learning within a stable social group. Some codas express clan identity, and denote different patterns of travel, foraging, and socializing or avoidance among clans. As “arbitrary traits that function as reliable indicators of cultural group membership,” clan identity codas act as symbolic markers that modulate interactions between individuals.

Individual identity in sperm whale vocalizations is an ongoing scientific issue, however. A distinction needs to be made between cues and signals. Human acoustic tools can distinguish individual whales by analyzing micro-characteristics of their vocalizations, and the whales can probably do the same. This does not prove that the whales deliberately use some vocalizations to signal individual identity in the manner of the signature whistles that bottlenose dolphins use as individual labels.

===Mysticete whales ===
Mysticetes do not have phonic lip structure. Instead, they have a larynx that appears to play a role in sound production, as it has vocal folds (vocal &quot;cord&quot;) homologs in the U-shaped fold supported by arytenoid cartilages. Whales do not have to exhale in order to produce sound, as they capture the air in a laryngeal sac. It is likely that they recycle air from this sac back to the lungs for the next vocalization. They do not have bony cranial sinuses, but there is a pterygoid air sac. Its role in sound production is unclear (perhaps resonance?), but most likely it is for hearing, as it appears to preserve an airspace at depth around the ear ossicles.

==== Vocal plasticity and acoustic behavior====
There are at least nine separate blue whale acoustic populations worldwide. Over the last 50 years blue whales have changed the way they are singing. Calls are progressively getting lower in frequency. For example, the Australian pygmy blue whales are decreasing their mean call frequency rate at approximately 0.35 Hz/year.

The migration patterns of blue whales remain unclear. Some populations appear to be resident in habitats of year-round high productivity in some years, while others undertake long migrations to high-latitude feeding grounds, but the extent of migrations and the components of the populations that undertake them are poorly known.

==== Sound levels ====
The frequency of baleen whale sounds ranges from 10 Hz to 31 kHz. A list of typical levels is shown in the table below.

== Human interaction ==
Researchers use hydrophones (often adapted from their original military use in tracking submarines) to ascertain the exact location of the origin of whale noises. Their methods also allow them to detect how far through an ocean a sound travels. Research by Dr. Christopher Clark of Cornell University conducted using military data showed that whale noises travel for thousands of kilometres. As well as providing information about song production, the data allows researchers to follow the migratory path of whales throughout the &quot;singing&quot; (mating) season. An important finding is that whales, in a process called the Lombard effect, adjust their song to compensate for background noise pollution. Moreover, there is evidence that blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8 kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100 Hz).
Research indicates that ambient noise from boats is doubling with each decade, reducing the range at which whale sounds can be heard. Prior to the introduction of large-scale shipping, whale sounds may have traveled from one side of an ocean to the other. Environmentalists fear that such boat activity is putting undue stress on the animals as well as making it difficult to find a mate.

In the past decade, many effective automated methods, such as signal processing, data mining, and machine learning techniques have been developed to detect and classify whale vocalizations.

==History==
Whaling Captain Wm. H. Kelly was the first person known to recognize whale singing for what it was, while on the brig &quot;Eliza&quot; in the Sea of Japan in 1881.

After William E. Schevill became an Associate in Physical Oceanography at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts in 1943, his first work was under US Naval auspices investigating echolocation of U-boats. As he later wrote in 1962: &quot;During World War II many people on both sides listened to underwater sounds for military reasons. Not only the wanted sounds (those made by enemy ships), but a bewildering variety of others were heard. Most of these were ascribed to animals living in the sea, usually as &#x27;fish noises&#x27; ... Some were ascribed to whales, in part correctly, but without identification of the kind of whale; most military listeners were not biologists, and in any case the traditional naval sonar room is woefully deficient in windows.&quot; Schevill produced the first recordings of underwater whale sounds and extrapolated their purpose from these recordings. His groundbreaking work produced over fifty papers on whale phonation and thus provided the framework for “literally hundreds of scientific studies produced by other workers from the 1960s until the present day.&quot; However, it is worthy of note that his wife Barbara Lawrence, Curator of Mammals at the Harvard Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ),
often co-wrote these documents with him.

William E. Schevill&#x27;s study of whales also at one point harked back to the U.S. Naval operations that first set him down this path. As noted upon his death by the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History, &quot;Bill helped defuse a tense moment between the USA and Soviet Union during the Cold War. The US military suspected that low frequency blips were being used by the Soviets to locate American submarines, whereas Bill showed these were produced by fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus) hunting prey.&quot;

<text>Nashville Superspeedway is a tri-oval intermediate speedway in Lebanon, Tennessee. The track has held a variety of racing events since its opening in 2001, including NASCAR and the IndyCar Series. It is currently owned by Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI) since 2021 and led by track general manager Matt Greci.

The track has a current permanent seating capacity of 25,000, with potential to expand to 38,000 with temporary grandstands. It is one of three NASCAR tracks that features a concrete racing surface instead of the traditional asphalt; its sibling tracks in Dover, Delaware and Bristol, Tennessee, are the other two. Along with the main track, the track complex also features a road course layout that uses parts of the main track along with an infield road course that is used to make a &quot;roval&quot;. The complex initially planned to expand further to include a drag strip, short track, and a dedicated road course; however, these plans were scrapped. 

Initial plans for the track were announced in 1997 by Dover Downs Entertainment (last known as Dover Motorsports) as part of a rise of popularity in stock car racing in the 1990s and with hopes to bring back the NASCAR Cup Series to the Nashville area. The track opened in 2001 to host IndyCar and the second-tier NASCAR Busch Series (now known as the NASCAR Xfinity Series). However, a decade later, all major racing left the track due to poor attendance caused by the failure to obtain a Cup Series race, and was left desolate and abandoned for nearly a decade. In 2020, in a surprise move, Dover Motorsports announced the return of NASCAR racing; this time with the NASCAR Cup Series.

== Description ==

=== Configuration ===
Nashville Superspeedway in its current form is measured at , with 14 degrees of banking in the track&#x27;s turns, nine degrees of banking in the track&#x27;s frontstretch, and six degrees of banking in the track&#x27;s backstretch. Varying sanctioning bodies have disputed the length of the track; NASCAR&#x27;s official measurement is at 1.33 mi, while IndyCar measures the track at .

Along with the main track, an infield road course was built with the main track&#x27;s construction. According to &quot;The Daily News Journal&quot;, the course measured , and held its first races in July 2001.

=== Amenities ===
The track is served by Interstate 840 and Tennessee State Route 452. State Route 452 was built as part of a project by the Tennessee Department of Transportation in 2000 in order to accommodate traffic for the track. According to &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, as of 2021, the track has a permanent seating capacity of 25,000, with potential to increase to 40,000 for NASCAR races with temporary grandstands. In 2023, a capacity with the temporary grandstands was reported at 38,000. At its peak, the track had a reported capacity of 50,000, with hopes of expanding to 150,000 according to a 2001 report by &quot;The Daily News Journal&quot;.

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===
In the 1990s, a boom period of large-capacity and modern tracks that correlated with the rise of NASCAR occurred, with nationwide efforts being made to build tracks to lure a NASCAR Winston Cup Series race weekend. In November 1997, initial plans for a $25–30 million, 50,000-seat track to be built in the Nashville metropolitan area were made in a joint announcement between Dover Downs Entertainment (last known as Dover Motorsports) and Gaylord Entertainment (now known as Ryman Hospitality Properties), with hopes of the track hosting Winston Cup races. If successful, the track would be the first track to host Winston Cup races in Middle Tennessee since 1984, though the chance of success was met with heavy skepticism due to the track&#x27;s small capacity. In the early planning stages, although track developers expressed desires to build the track and prioritize finding a location within Davidson County, they couldn&#x27;t find a suitable 1,200-acre site, with developers getting suggestions to look outside Davidson County. Developers later stated that they planned to build an initial track that could hold 50,000, with potential to expand to 150,000 to 200,000 if needed.

==== Delays, opposition ====
By March 1998, although a location had not been selected, developer Denis McGlynn was &quot;confident&quot; the track would open by 2000. In April, he expressed hopes of hosting NHRA and IndyCar events. On May 21, developers anticipated a site decision within &quot;three or four weeks&quot;. Three days later, &quot;The Daily News Journal&quot; reported that McGlynn had narrowed down options to four sites, likely in Rutherford or Wilson County. However, by July, construction had been delayed, putting the project at risk. However, &quot;the News Journal&quot; reported that a plot of land owned by Harding University in northern Rutherford County was under consideration, along with a second undisclosed site. By month’s end, the company began efforts to purchase the land and other smaller parcels.

The project received mixed reactions from property owners in Rutherford County, with some refusing to sell. To further compound issues, many local residents voiced concerns about traffic and noise, with guarantees of a Winston Cup date still being thought of as a longshot. In August, Dover Downs Entertainment expanded its plans for Nashville Superspeedway, increasing the budget to $125 million and aiming to buy 2,600–2,700 acres to build an industrial park. In early October, Dover Downs opted to file a separate rezoning request for 1,600 acres of land along the Wilson County border, deciding to submit both plans; although the Rutherford County plot was preferred, the company considered moving the entire project solely to Wilson County due to about 230 acres of land not being sold by disinterested property owners. On October 20, with the Rutherford County plan receiving increased criticism and adamant holdouts, Dover Downs announced the project would proceed solely in Wilson County.

After a two-week delay for Wilson County officials to review the rezoning plans, the request was set for a hearing on November 7, with expanded plans to include a dragstrip, road course, dirt track, and a short track. The officials voted on December 21, approving the rezoning 22–3. This raised concerns over the future of Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway, valued as a historic site despite aging facilities. In February 1999, a group opposing the track, County Residents Against Racetrack Havoc (CRASH), sued Wilson County, alleging zoning violations and subsequent potential delays in construction against the county.

==== Construction ====
The local Wilson County Sports Authority, the Tennessee Department of Transportation, and Dover Downs Entertainment agreed to raise $15 million for renovations concerning the track&#x27;s infrastructure, which was approved by the Tennessee General Assembly in March 1999. Due to the delays, in April, the track announced that the opening year had been pushed back to 2001. By May, the track itself, which now had a budget of $47 million, was now in doubt if it could make a sufficient economic impact. That same month, developers announced a groundbreaking date in August or September 1999, with new plans to oversee a 1,000-acre plot of land for private development. In July, Gaylord Entertainment backed out of the partnership, but Dover Downs insisted that it would not affect the construction of the track; a groundbreaking date was later announced on August 12, to take place on the 26th of the same month. The track was officially named &quot;Nashville Superspeedway&quot; on the 25th.

Groundbreaking took place as scheduled. However, just before the groundbreaking ceremony, CRASH accused Dover Downs and Wilson County of &quot;fail[ing] to follow its ordinances&quot; and a lack of notice of intent to rezone, adding to their lawsuit. Three days after the ceremony, an analysis ran by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation found that building the 3,100-acre complex would seriously harm the habitat of the endangered Tennessee coneflower, with fears of destroying a major glade. As a result of this finding, CRASH attempted to tack on allegations of environmental destruction; the idea was repelled by track supporters, who claimed that the flower could survive the construction regardless and that CRASH paid no mind of the flowers until the finding was released. By January 2000, the NASCAR Busch Series (now known as the NASCAR Xfinity Series) stated that in 2001, they would move from its race at the Fairgrounds to Nashville Superspeedway, along with the longstanding flagship race of the Fairgrounds, the All-American 400. Four months later, developers began to work on the foundations of the track, hoping to open in April 2001. That same month, in an abrupt transition, the track switched general managers; Cliff Hawks, the executive director of the Fairgrounds, replaced Joe Ernest.

With the additions of Chicagoland Speedway and Kansas Speedway to the Cup Series schedule, the chances of the track&#x27;s hopes of getting a Cup Series date dwindled heavily despite McGlynn stating otherwise. In June, multiple developments were announced; construction of the road course began, the addition of an Indy Racing League (IRL) race, and the release of a new logo. The next month, although NASCAR stated they had no plans to hold a Cup Series race at the track, the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) announced hopes to host events at the complex in 2002. Track paving was completed in early November, with tickets going on sale within the same month. By January 2001, the track announced additional suites from its initial 24 to accommodate higher demand. The track itself was completed the next month. The first test runs took place in early March, drawing positive reviews from testers Tim Steele and Shawna Robinson. Final approvals of zoning changes for the project were approved in the same month, essentially killing appeals made by CRASH. However, by this point, most development planned for the project hadn&#x27;t started, putting the hopes of the track holding major events and economic growth for Wilson County businesses under doubt. At the end of its construction, Dover Downs was recorded to have spent $125 million on the initial phase of the project.

=== Early years ===
The track officially opened to the public on April 7, 2001, for an open house event. Five days later, after a short electrical worker pay dispute that lasted for three days, the track opened to drivers and teams for practice and qualifying sessions. It drew mixed reception from drivers of the NASCAR Busch Series; drivers such as Todd Bodine and Bobby Hamilton expressed concerns about a lack of grip, while others such as Kevin Harvick hoped that the track would gain grip as time progressed. The track held its first races on April 13 and 14, with Ken Schrader and Greg Biffle winning ARCA Re/Max Series and Busch Series events, respectively. As a result of the complaints of slickness, McGlynn opted to resurface a part of the track between the first and second turns. The facility held its first IRL race on July 21, with Buddy Lazier winning the event. Both weekends both did not see sellout crowds. Six days after the IRL event, NASCAR announced that the track was awarded a second Busch Series weekend starting in 2002. The next month, the track held its first NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series event.

In October 2009, as a result of the closure of the Dover Motorsports-owned Memphis Motorsports Park, Dover Motorsports opted to move their NASCAR Truck Series date from Memphis to Nashville, with Nashville now having two Truck Series races. The track became publicized in 2011 when Joe Nelms, pastor of the Family Baptist Church, gave a pre-race invocation that praised his family and NASCAR and its sponsors in an eccentric manner that later became an internet phenomenon. The prayer was met with mixed reception; it drew criticism from &quot;ESPN&quot; reporter David Newton for &quot;put[ting] the spotlight on anybody but himself&quot;, while &quot;Bleacher Report&quot; writer Richard Langford praised it, stating that the invocation had &quot;managed to produce something memorable without being disrespectful&quot;.

=== Era of disrepair and abandon ===
By 2011, the track faced a litany of issues. The track had a recorded $21 million in bond debt from a 1999 bond deal to extend sewer and water lines, lackluster attendance was prevalent, and the addition of Kentucky Speedway to the Cup Series schedule in 2011 essentially killed any hopes of the track winning rights to a Cup Series weekend; the very goal that Dover Entertainment set. On August 3, 2011, Dover Motorsports announced the track&#x27;s closure for the 2012 season, with none of the projected projects, other than the tri-oval, being built. The company hoped to sell the track to another company. Although rumors were spread that the IndyCar Series would return in 2013, the closure continued into 2013 and 2014. In March 2014, Dover Motorsports representative Gary Camp stated that the only activities occurring at the facility was for testing.

==== Attempted sale to NeXovation ====
On May 30, 2014, Dover Motorsports announced that the company sold the facility to Nashville-based technology company NeXovation for $45.8 million, with the buyer hoping to renovate the track. According to journalist Larry Woody, speculation arose that the CEO of the company, Robert Sexton, had hopes of continuing original plans for the complex or to turn the track into a testing facility. In an interview with &quot;The Tennessean&quot;, Sexton stated that he wanted to make the facility run year-round, hosting both motorsports and technology-based events. However, the sale confirmation was delayed multiple times. In September, an extension was give until October 25 for NeXovation to further inspect the facility. In March 2015, after paying $400,000, the company was able to further extend their deadline. By the end of May, &quot;The Tennessean&quot; reported that the deadline had been extended a total of seven times, leading to increasing doubt on whether the facility would be renovated. In July, the company defaulted on their purchase, and by August, Dover Motorsports opted to reopen the sale of the track.

==== Partial sale to Panattoni ====
On August 25, 2016, Dover Motorsports announced the sale of the property to Panattoni, a California-based development company for $44.7 million. The company stated that they planned to redevelop the facility and rezone the area into a &quot;logistics and distribution park&quot;, with the company initially retaining the track. However, by late 2017, the company sent concept plans to instead purchase the land in phases. In March, a parcel spanning approximately 147 acres was finalized for a price of $5.1 million, with hopes to build an industrial park. The next year, in July, Panattoni bought another parcel of around 132 acres for $6.37 million. By November of that year, the industrial park was opened as the Speedway Industrial Park. Discussion about the track being revitalized for racing was denied by Panattoni, with the decision to resume motorsports events at the track seen as highly unlikely. In December 2019, Woody reported that Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI) CEO Marcus Smith initially displayed interest of buying the track, but instead decided to pursue the Fairgrounds.

=== Resurgence, Speedway Motorsports buyout ===
In early 2020, NASCAR Cup Series drivers, such as Clint Bowyer and Chase Elliott, began calling for the series&#x27; return to the Nashville area. However, they called for the series to race at the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway due to its closeness to the Nashville metropolitan area compared to the Nashville Superspeedway. In June of that year, Dover Motorsports announced that the company planned to hold future NASCAR Cup Series races at the track by the next year, reopening the track. The decision was seen as a surprise by local Nashville media, as while the facility could be repaired within a year, the location of the track to the Nashville area made it less desirable than the Fairgrounds. However, due to simpler approval processes to resume racing at the Nashville Superspeedway, Dover Motorsports opted to choose it over the Fairgrounds. According to McGlynn, renovating the facility would cost an estimated $8–10 million. After an inspection that deemed the track in &quot;phenomenal shape&quot;, in August, Dover Motorsports appointed Erik Moses to run the track. The facility was able to hold its first large-scale events in November, along with gaining confirmation of scheduled dates for its NASCAR events in 2021. The next month, Dover Motorsports rebranded the facility. The first Cup Series race was run at the track on June 20, with Kyle Larson winning the event.

In late 2021, track ownership changed hands when SMI bought out Dover Motorsports for a total of $131.5 million. The next year, on November 15, Moses stepped down from his position as general manager to become the CEO of the Fiesta Bowl. Two weeks later, the track appointed its vice president of events and operations, Matt Greci, to fill in the position. In 2023, during the 2023 Ally 400, the track drew complaints from driver Ryan Blaney, who crashed during the race, hitting the track&#x27;s inside barrier in the accident. The inside barrier had no SAFER barrier, a safety addition added to track walls widely implemented after the death of Dale Earnhardt. He later described the impact as the &quot;hardest [hit] of my life&quot;, advocating for the addition of a SAFER barrier. The accident caused renewed discussion over the safety of the Next Gen car NASCAR had been using since 2022, which had seen multiple injuries within its first year, along with further criticism from NASCAR senior vice president of competition Elton Sawyer for the lack of a proper barrier.

==== NASCAR ====
The track hosts one NASCAR weekend annually. When it first opened, the NASCAR Xfinity Series&#x27; Tennessee Lottery 250 and the NASCAR Truck Series&#x27; Rackley Roofing 200 were held there from 2001 to 2011. In 2021, both races returned, along with the addition of the NASCAR Cup Series&#x27; Ally 400.

==== IndyCar ====
The track announced its first Indy Racing League (now known as the IndyCar Series) races in June 2000, with the inaugural iteration of the event taking place on July 21, 2001. The event lasted until 2008; although event organizers entered negotiations to renew for the 2009 season, by August 2008, negotiations had broken down, failing to renew their contract. In 2024, despite successful runnings of the Music City Grand Prix that took place on a street course in downtown Nashville since 2021, the IndyCar Series opted to change their location for the race to the Nashville Superspeedway after it was found that their course layout for 2024 would interfere with construction at the New Nissan Stadium, which was near the street course.

==Population==

==Personalities==
It was possibly the birthplace of Aimeric de Peguilhan, a medieval troubadour, although this is debated.

==Geography==
The river Gesse flows northwards through the commune towards the market town of Boulogne-sur-Gesse; the Gimone forms most its western border.

==Literature==
Péguilhan is the setting for Martin Calder&#x27;s travel memoir &quot;A Summer in Gascony&quot;, about life on a farm with a local Gascon family, centred on the inn at the end of the village. The book is set in the early 1990s and was published in 2008 by Nicholas Brealey publishing.

<doc id="683004" wikidata="Q3708619" url="?curid=683004" title="Victor, New York">
<text>Victor is an incorporated town in Ontario County, New York, United States. The population was 15,969 at the time of the 2020 census. The town is named after Claudius Victor Boughton, an American hero of the War of 1812.

The Town of Victor contains a village, also called Victor. The town is in the northwest corner of Ontario County and is southeast of Rochester. Victor is part of the Greater Rochester area; Victor&#x27;s strategic location led to extensive suburban growth in the late 20th and early 21st century. Victor is the largest of Rochester&#x27;s suburbs to be located outside of Monroe County, the home of more than two-thirds of the Greater Rochester population. The Village of Victor is from the head of Canandaigua Lake, the fourth largest of the Finger Lakes.

==History==
An important Seneca village, known as &quot;Gannagaro&quot; or &quot;Ganondagan&quot;, was located within the area of this town. The tribe abandoned the village and the area about it after being severely attacked in 1687 by French invaders from Canada. They were trying to control the lucrative fur trade.

In 2015, New York opened a museum and cultural center on the grounds of the Ganondagan State Historic Site, established in 1987. The Seneca Art &amp; Culture Center at Ganondagan will use art, history and education, drawn from oral history, written documents, and archeological evidence, to tell the story of the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) people, and specifically the Seneca nation. It is the only publicly funded state historic site devoted to the Haudenosaunee. It has both Haudenosaunee and Non-Native American staff and volunteers. It gives a prominent role to Jigonhsasee, the Iroquoian woman credited as one of the founders of the Confederacy.

The Seneca were the nation that lived the furthest west in New York, anchoring that approach. They occupied the Finger Lakes area and were one of Five Nations who first made up the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. In 1722 the Haudenosaunee accepted the Tuscarora, another Iroquoian-speaking people who migrated from the Carolinas, and became the Six Nations.

Following the American Revolutionary War, the Phelps and Gorham Purchase from the Seneca included the territory of this town. Pioneer settlement by European Americans began around 1789. The Town of Victor was formed in 1812 from part of the Town of Bloomfield. The area was initially developed for agriculture.

The Jeremiah Cronkite House, Cobblestone Railroad Pumphouse, Felt Cobblestone General Store, Boughton Hill, Osborne House, and Valentown Hall are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The western and northern town lines are the border of Monroe County (Perinton and Mendon).

The New York State Thruway (Interstate 90) passes across the northern part of the town and intersects Interstate 490 east of Fishers. New York State Route 96 is primarily an east-west highway, but turns north to the west of Victor village. New York State Route 251 connects the western part of Victor to Monroe County.

<text>Kender are a type of fantasy race first developed for the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; campaign setting for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy role playing game published by TSR, Inc. in 1984. The first kender character was created by Harold Johnson as a player character in a series of role-playing adventures co-authored by Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis. Weis and Hickman&#x27;s &quot;Dragonlance&quot; shared world novels introduced the kender to readers and players alike, largely through the character Tasslehoff Burrfoot, who became one of the main protagonists in the series.

Tasslehoff first appeared in the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; adventure module DL1 &quot;Dragons of Despair&quot;, published in March 1984; later that year, the kender&#x27;s first literary appearance was in the novel &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot;, published in November 1984. The kender are often compared to notable diminutive humanoid peoples in other fantasy fiction, such as the hobbits of Middle-earth or halflings featured in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; campaign settings.

==Conception and development==
In preparation for the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting, Tracy Hickman ran a series of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; adventures. Harold Johnson, one of those involved in the games, chose to play a halfling thief character whom he called Almar Tann. When Hickman, Johnson and others moved to the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; setting for their games, the character of Almar Tann went with them. It soon became clear to those involved, however, that halflings were unsuitable to the Dragonlance world. As Johnson described it, this was especially due to his character&#x27;s possession of a ring of invisibility, so that &quot;it all sounded too much like another story,&quot; referring to Bilbo Baggins and the One Ring. Halflings were then dropped from the campaign, and Johnson developed both the initial concept of the kender and the first representative of the fantasy race, Tasslehoff Burrfoot. To solidify the distinction, they were originally described as &quot;thinner, more wiry, and more cunning and streetwise&quot; than halflings, with mixed success: While Matt Barton and Shane Stacks assessed kender to be similar to Tolkien&#x27;s hobbits, Daisy De Palmas Jauze considered them a novelty.

Roger E. Moore introduced the kender, and Tasslehoff Burrfoot, to the wider community through his short story &quot;A Stone&#x27;s Throw Away&quot;, published in April 1984 in &quot;Dragon&quot;. While Hickman was involved in some of the development, he stated that it was Roger Moore who contributed the most in defining the kender&#x27;s final iteration.

The original concept of the kender held that they were &quot;savage, warrior children, ever curious, ever alert.&quot; This concept was altered dramatically when Janet Pack became involved in dramatic readings of the works, as Pack&#x27;s personal characteristics had a strong impact on how those involved in the process viewed the kender. According to Jeff Grubb, she, &quot;and as a result all kender since her, was cute. Extremely cute. Sweetly, lovably, frustratingly cute... And it&#x27;s hard, after seeing Janet play Tas, to imagine them any other way.&quot; Two of the other key characteristics of kender—their curiosity and kleptomania—were introduced by Hickman. Hickman was uncomfortable with the notion of a &quot;race of thieves&quot; in his games, but still wanted the skills typically associated with thieves, so he added their &quot;innocent tendency to &#x27;borrow&#x27; things for indeterminate periods of time.&quot;

Originally, kender were to be called &quot;kinder&quot;, in reference to the German word for &quot;children&quot;, but Hickman has reported that readers tended to read the name as &quot;kind-er&quot; rather than &quot;kin-der&quot; in print, leading to the decision to alter the spelling.

Shannon Appelcline noted that game designer John Wick commented in a 2009 podcast that: &quot;Kender … they don&#x27;t make sense. It doesn&#x27;t make sense for a race of sociopathic kleptomaniacs to exist in a culture. So how do you put that in a culture to make it make sense?&quot;

==Description==

===Fictional origin===
The &quot;Dragonlance&quot; books present three conflicting accounts of how the kender were created. In &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot;, the Irda state that kender descend from the gnomes. When the Greygem of Gargath was released, the gnomes present who desired the gem for greed were turned into dwarves, and those who wanted it for curiosity were turned into kender. In the &quot;Tales&quot; trilogy, however, the dwarves state that when the Greygem came to Krynn, its chaotic magic transformed a group of gnomes into both the first kender and the first dwarves. Still again, it has been stated that in the final battle for control of the Greygem at Gargath&#x27;s tower, the chaotic power of the gem transformed part of the dwarven army into gnomes, and part of the elven army into kender.

Alternatively, in the novel &quot;The Forest King&quot; the Longwalker tells the story of his arrival in Krynn through a great cleft in the ground. The Longwalker states that a very clever girl named Fina decided to make a lodestone so powerful it would draw the gods down. All the people helped her until it was the size of a mountain. This drew down The Eye, which burned with such anger it melted the lodestone, and killed many of the people. They found a cleft and squeezed inside, going down through the earth to escape The Eye, traveling down for many generations. When they emerged on the other side they were smaller, and filled with wanderlust; they had become the kender. When asked if the story were true he replies, &quot;How could it be?&quot; This tale, however, is almost certainly the equivalent of a Krynnish folktale.

===Appearance and traits===
The kender are described in a review of DL1 &quot;Dragons of Despair&quot;, the adventure module where they first appeared, as: &quot;wizened 14-year-olds and, unlike halflings, they wear shoes.&quot;

In &quot;Dragons of Autumn Twilight&quot;, Kender are described as &quot;small boned&quot; and rarely growing over more than 4 feet tall. Grubb adds to this, stating that the original intention was to depict them as being &quot;wilder than halflings, fearless, sometimes cruel as only children can be&quot;. Things changed after Pack&#x27;s dramatic readings, at which point they became &quot;brave, fearless, taunting, and cute&quot;.

In &quot;Dragonlance Adventures&quot;, the kender are depicted with several qualities that make them stand out. They obtain a wizened appearance as they grow older, due to a fine network of lines that appears on their faces around age forty, and have pointed ears which gives them somewhat of a resemblance to elves. Kender tend to have a wide vocal range, enabling older individuals to perform impressive sound imitations. In addition, they are often depicted as rambling and speaking very quickly when excited, which can make them difficult to understand. Finally, they are described as having a distinctive topknot incorporated into their hairstyles, which is a source of pride.

When kender appeared in the computer game &quot;Champions of Krynn&quot;, released in 1990, they were described as &quot;ever mirthful&quot; and &quot;a diminutive and highly playful race that resembles Tolkien&#x27;s hobbit&quot;.

====Curiosity====
Hickman&#x27;s primary contributions to the development of the kender were their curiosity and their tendency to &quot;borrow&quot; objects. His desire for the skills of a thief, without the associated moral concerns raised by a &quot;race of thieves&quot;, led to depicting kender as possessing a habit of finding things that have dropped into their pouches by accident, picking things up in the streets, finding &quot;junk&quot;, and generally acquiring things that belong to other people. This habit was justified in &quot;Dragonlance Adventures&quot; through Hickman&#x27;s decision to provide the kender with enormous natural curiosity, a character trait which is also employed to provide the characters with lock picking skills and a tendency to &quot;listen in on other&#x27;s conversations&quot;.

Kender are described as not believing that there is anything morally wrong with handling others&#x27; items, although the habit may land them in considerable trouble with the owner of an object. In addition, they do not tend to pocket things like money, gems, and the like, as they are depicted as having little concept of monetary value. Kender oppose actual thieving vehemently, and consider being called a thief a great insult to their dignity.

As a side effect of these characteristics, kender can be difficult to play within the role-playing game, as their lack of interest in monetary gain is &quot;a virtual anathema&quot; to the manner in which characters of many other races are typically portrayed. It was recommended in &quot;The Mists of Krynn&quot; that kender be employed as non-player characters, with their kleptomania providing a convenient means for those running the game to introduce objects at critical times.

====Taunting====
In &quot;Dragonlance Adventures&quot;, kender are described as masters at the art of insulting people, using a wide repertoire of taunts, sarcasm, rudeness, and insults. This is made possible due to the shocking insights into an individual&#x27;s character flaws that a kender can gain through his or her intense curiosity. Kender are also described in &quot;Dragonlance Adventures&quot; as using this ability to taunt creatures, causing them to become irrational and attack wildly or fall into some kind of trap.

In the computer game &quot;Champions of Krynn&quot;, kender are portrayed as &quot;the only race that can taunt enemies, driving them into a rage ... and forcing them to focus their attacks on kender&quot;. Hickman explained that this characteristic in the kender was created by the game group which was responsible for creating the original saga. Although they thought it was a simple feature, including it in subsequent books proved to be a long-term challenge.

====Fearlessness====
Margaret Weis stated in &quot;The Annotated Legends&quot; that &quot;a problem with writing kender is that they are supposedly fearless. However, if a situation arises where an author wants to create fear in a reader, the author needs to do that through making a character feel fear ... thus we came up with the idea that Tas could feel fear for people he cared for, even if he did not feel fear himself. This also adds more depth to Tas&#x27;s character and makes him more human&quot;.

===Culture and society===
Within the game world, kender names are chosen from a wide range of sources such as recent events, an existing relative, or from items found in kender pouches, such as Bearchase, Lockpick, and Fruitthrow. As children, they constantly ask questions and come to rely on family and friends for needs, and they begin to take part in community activities. As they age, kender children gain education by hearing stories, desiring to acquire new skills, and playing games. They also begin handling and wandering. As kender reach the adolescent and teen-aged years, they become more active participants in Kender Moots, social gatherings where the youth can show off their newly found skills in games and demonstrations. As they near adulthood, kender experience intense wanderlust and leave home.

Most kender spend their entire adult lives wandering around the world. Most of the population of Krynn has been exposed to the adult variety of kender, and as such have adapted the word kender to mean thief, rogue, or cutpurse. Kender take great offense to these epithets, especially the last. &quot;The Annotated Chronicles&quot; cites the &quot;Dragonlance Adventures&quot;, which states, &quot;Most Kender are encountered during wanderlust, a particular phase in a kender&#x27;s life that occurs for most kender during their early 20s. Wanderlust may happen for many years ... and is responsible for spreading kender communities across the continent of Ansalon.&quot;

A kender&#x27;s natural lifespan is about 100 years. They age slowly, remaining childlike in comparison to other races even when their bodies slow down. Kender view death as the next great adventure, and do not linger long in sadness after the passing of a loved one.

Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and upset stomach. An allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, or a type of diarrhea caused by &quot;Clostridioides difficile&quot; is possible. Azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No harm has been found with its use during pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is not confirmed, but it is likely safe. Azithromycin is an azalide, a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thereby stopping bacterial growth.
Azithromycin was discovered in Yugoslavia (present day Croatia) in 1980 by the pharmaceutical company Pliva and approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization lists it as an example under &quot;Macrolides and ketolides&quot; in its &quot;Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine&quot; (designed to help manage antimicrobial resistance). It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions.

== Medical uses ==
Azithromycin is used to treat diverse infections, including:
* Acute bacterial sinusitis due to &quot;H. influenzae&quot;, &quot;M. catarrhalis&quot;, or &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;. A 1999 study found Azithromycin to be faster in resolving symptoms as compared to amoxicillin / clavulanic.
* Acute otitis media caused by &quot;H. influenzae&quot;, &quot;M. catarrhalis&quot; or &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;. A 2021 study concluded that Azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in its treatment and that it was safer and more tolerable in children.
* Community-acquired pneumonia due to &quot;C. pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;H. influenzae&quot;, &quot;M. pneumoniae&quot;, or &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;. 
* Genital ulcer disease (chancroid) in men due to &quot;H. ducreyi&quot;
* Pharyngitis or tonsillitis caused by &quot;S. pyogenes&quot; as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy
* Prevention and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to &quot;H. influenzae&quot;, &quot;M. catarrhalis&quot;, or &quot;S. pneumoniae&quot;. The benefits of long-term prophylaxis must be weighed on a patient-by-patient basis against the risk of cardiovascular and other adverse effects.
* Trachoma due to &quot;C. trachomatis&quot;
* Uncomplicated skin infections due to &quot;S. aureus&quot;, &quot;S. pyogenes&quot;, or &quot;S. agalactiae&quot;
* Whooping cough caused by &quot;B. pertussis&quot;.
* Scrub typhus caused by &quot;Orientia tsutsugamushi&quot;.

=== Bacterial susceptibility ===
Azithromycin has relatively broad but shallow antibacterial activity. It inhibits some Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria, and many atypical bacteria.

Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms
* &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (Methicillin-sensitive only)
* &quot;Streptococcus agalactiae&quot;
* &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;

Aerobic and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative microorganisms
* &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;
* &quot;Haemophilus ducreyi&quot;
* &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;
* &quot;Legionella pneumophila&quot;
* &quot;Moraxella catarrhalis&quot;
* &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot;

Anaerobic microorganisms
* &quot;Peptostreptococcus&quot; species
* &quot;Prevotella bivia&quot;

Other microorganisms
* &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;
* &quot;Chlamydophila pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Mycoplasma genitalium&quot;
* &quot;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&quot;
* &quot;Ureaplasma urealyticum&quot;

===Pregnancy and breastfeeding===
While some studies claim that no harm has been found with use during pregnancy, more recent studies with mice during late pregnancy has shown adverse effects on embryonic testicular and neural development of prenatal azithromycin exposure (PAzE) . One recent study claims &quot;obvious fetus changes were observed under high-dose, mid-pregnancy and multi-course exposure&quot;. However, there need to be more well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

The safety of the medication during breastfeeding is unclear. It was reported that because only low levels are found in breast milk and the medication has also been used in young children, it is unlikely that breastfed infants would have adverse effects.

===Airway diseases===
Azithromycin has beneficial effects in the treatment of asthma. It possesses antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties which contribute to its effectiveness. Asthma exacerbations can be caused by chronic neutrophilic inflammation, and azithromycin is known to reduce this type of inflammation due to its immunomodulatory properties. The recommended dosage for controlling asthma exacerbations with azithromycin is either 500 mg or 250 mg taken orally as tablets three times a week. In adults with severe asthma, low-dose azithromycin may be prescribed as an add-on treatment when standard therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids or long-acting beta2-agonists are not sufficient. Long-term use of azithromycin in patients with persistent symptomatic asthma aims to decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations and improve their quality of life. While both its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects play crucial roles in treating asthma, studies suggest that responsiveness to azithromycin therapy depends on individual variations in lung bacterial burden and microbial composition, collectively referred to as the lung microbiome. The richness (diversity) of the lung microbiome has been identified as a key factor in determining the effectiveness of azithromycin treatment. Azithromycin has significant interactions with the patient&#x27;s microbiome. Long-term use of azithromycin reduces the presence of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; bacteria in the airways but also increases resistance against macrolide antibiotics. The specific pharmacological mechanisms through which azithromycin interacts with the patient&#x27;s microbiome remain unknown research continues to explore how changes in microbial composition influence drug efficacy and patient outcomes.

Azithromycin appears to be effective in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through its suppression of inflammatory processes. Azithromycin is potentially useful in sinusitis via this mechanism. Azithromycin is believed to produce its effects through suppressing certain immune responses that may contribute to inflammation of the airways.

== Adverse effects ==
Most common adverse effects are diarrhea (5%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting. Fewer than 1% of people stop taking the drug due to side effects. Nervousness, skin reactions, and anaphylaxis have been reported. &quot; Clostridioides difficile&quot; infection has been reported with use of azithromycin. Azithromycin does not affect the efficacy of birth control unlike some other antibiotics such as rifampin. Hearing loss has been reported.

Occasionally, people have developed cholestatic hepatitis or delirium. Accidental intravenous overdose in an infant caused severe heart block, resulting in residual encephalopathy.

In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that azithromycin &quot;can cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart that may lead to a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm.&quot; The FDA noted in the warning a 2012 study that found the drug may increase the risk of death, especially in those with heart problems, compared with those on other antibiotics such as amoxicillin or no antibiotic. The warning indicated people with preexisting conditions are at particular risk, such as those with abnormalities in the QT interval, low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, a slower than normal heart rate, or those who use certain drugs to treat abnormal heart rhythms. The warning mentioned that azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.

== Interactions ==
=== Colchicine ===
Azithromycin, should not be taken with colchicine as it may lead to colchicine toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, myalgia, pancytopenia, and organ failure.

=== Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 ===
CYP3A4 is an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs in the liver. Some drugs can inhibit CYP3A4, which means they reduce its activity and increase the blood levels of the drugs that depend on it for elimination. This can lead to adverse effects or drug-drug interactions.

Azithromycin is a member of macrolides that are a class of antibiotics with a cyclic structure with a lactone ring and sugar moieties. Macrolides can inhibit CYP3A4 by a mechanism called mechanism-based inhibition (MBI), which involves the formation of reactive metabolites that bind covalently and irreversibly to the enzyme, rendering it inactive. Mechanism-based inhibition is more serious and long-lasting than reversible inhibition, as it requires the synthesis of new enzyme molecules to restore the activity.

The degree of mechanism-based inhibition by macrolides depends on the size and structure of their lactone ring. Clarithromycin and erythromycin have a 14-membered lactone ring, which is more prone to demethylation by CYP3A4 and subsequent formation of nitrosoalkenes, the reactive metabolites that cause mechanism-based inhibition. Azithromycin, on the other hand, has a 15-membered lactone ring, which is less susceptible to demethylation and nitrosoalkene formation. Therefore, azithromycin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, while clarithromycin and erythromycin are strong inhibitors which increase the area under the curve (AUC) value of co-administered drugs more than five-fold. AUC it is a measure of the drug exposure in the body over time. By inhibiting CYP3A4, macrolide antibitiotics, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin, but not azithromycin, can significantly increase the AUC of the drugs that depend on it for clearance, which can lead to higher risk of adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin stands apart from other macrolide antibiotics because it is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and does not significantly increase AUC value of co-administered drugs.

The difference in CYP3A4 inhibition by macrolides has clinical implications, for example for people who take statins, which are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of clarithromycin or erythromycin with statins can increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy, a condition that causes muscle pain and damage. Azithromycin, however, does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of statins and is considered a safer alternative than other macrolide antibiotics.

== Pharmacology ==
=== Mechanism of action ===
Azithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting translation of mRNA. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, so it can be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin&#x27;s half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days.

Following a single dose of 500 mg, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of azithromycin is 68 hours. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, about 6% of the administered dose appears as an unchanged drug in urine.

== History ==
A team of researchers at the pharmaceutical company Pliva in Zagreb, former Yugoslavia (present day Croatia) discovered azithromycin in 1980. The company Pliva patented it in 1981. In 1986, Pliva and Pfizer signed a licensing agreement, which gave Pfizer exclusive rights for the sale of azithromycin in Western Europe and the United States. Pliva put its azithromycin on the market in Central and Eastern Europe. Pfizer launched azithromycin under Pliva&#x27;s license in other markets under the brand name Zithromax in 1991. Patent protection ended in 2005.

==Society and culture==
=== Available forms ===
Azithromycin is available as a generic medication. Azithromycin is administered in film-coated tablet, capsule, oral suspension, intravenous injection, granules for suspension in sachet, and ophthalmic solution.

===Usage===
In 2010, azithromycin was the most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the US, whereas in Sweden, where outpatient antibiotic use is a third as prevalent, macrolides are only on 3% of prescriptions. In 2017, and 2022, azithromycin was the second most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the United States. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8million prescriptions.

==Research==
Azithromycin is researched for its supposed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, which are believed to be exhibited through its suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which is important in dampening inflammation. Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Studies suggest that azithromycin can decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. By decreasing the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, azithromycin probably controls potential tissue damage during inflammation. These effects are believed to be due to azithromycin&#x27;s ability to suppress a transcription factor called nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) resulting in blockade of inflammatory response pathways downstream from NF-κB activation leading to decreased chemokine receptor CXCR4 signaling causing reduced inflammation. Despite the efficiency of treating rosacea with azithromycin, the exact mechanism of why azithromycin is effective in treating rosacea are not completely understood. It is unclear whether its antibacterial or immunomodulatory properties or a combination of both mechanisms contribute to its efficacy. Azithromycin may prevent mast cell degranulation and thus can suppress inflammation of dorsal root ganglia through various signaling pathways such as decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells which are particularly relevant since they mediate the response of hair follicle antigens. Inflammation in rosacea is thought to be associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inflammatory cells. The ability of azithromycin to decrease ROS production can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, but this remains speculation.

The therapeutic role of azithromycin has been explored in various diseases such as cystic fibrosis exacerbation, burn injury-induced lung injury, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 infection. Despite early evidence showing azithromycin slowed down coronavirus multiplication in laboratory settings, further research indicates it to be ineffective as a treatment for COVID-19 in humans. Azithromycin in conjunction with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been associated with deleterious outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including drug-induced QT prolongation. After a large-scale trial showed no benefit of using azithromycin in treating COVID-19, the UK&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its guidance and no longer recommends the medication for COVID-19.

Azithromycin has been studied in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and has been reported to improve or even resolve symptoms in some cases. However, these studies have been described as being of very low quality. In any case, the beneficial effects might be by eradication of chronic bacterial infections that are possibly contributing to or causing CFS or by the immunomodulatory effects of azithromycin.

Azithromycin therapy in cystic fibrosis patients yields a modest respiratory function improvement, reduces exacerbation risk, and extends time to exacerbation up to six months; still, long-term efficacy data is a subject of ongoing research. Potential benefits of azithromycin therapy is azithromycin&#x27;s good safety profile, minimal treatment burden, and cost-effectiveness, but the drawbacks are gastrointestinal side effects with weekly dosing, which are ameliorated by a split dose regimen. The potential role of azithromycin in inhibiting the autophagic destruction of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) within macrophages has garnered significant attention. This mechanism may contribute to the observed correlation between long-term macrolide monotherapy and an increased risk of NTM infection and the emergence of macrolide-resistant strains. Azithromycin&#x27;s interference with autophagy could potentially predispose patients with cystic fibrosis to mycobacterial infections. Despite repeated refutations of a direct association between azithromycin use and NTM infection, there remains a high level of concern regarding the potential for the development of NTM strains resistant to macrolides.

Azithromycin has been shown to be an effective preventive measure against many postpartum infections in mothers following planned vaginal births; still, its impact on neonatal outcomes remains inconclusive and is the subject of ongoing research.

<text>Canada Dry is a Canadian-American brand of soft drinks founded in Toronto, Ontario, in 1904, and owned since 2008 by the American company Dr Pepper Snapple (now Keurig Dr Pepper). For over 100 years, Canada Dry has been known mainly for its ginger ale, though the company also manufactures a number of other soft drinks and mixers. Although it (as the brand name suggests) originated in Canada, Canada Dry is now produced in many countries such as the United States, Panama, Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Turkey and in a number of countries of Europe and the Middle East.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Dry&quot; in the brand&#x27;s name refers to not being sweet, as in a dry wine. When John J. McLaughlin originally made his new soft drink, &quot;Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale&quot;, it was far less sweet than other ginger ales then available; as a result, he labelled it &quot;dry&quot;.

==History==

In 1890, Canadian pharmacist and chemist John J. McLaughlin of Enniskillen, Ontario, after working in a soda factory in Brooklyn, New York, opened a carbonated water plant in Toronto. McLaughlin was the eldest son of Robert McLaughlin, founder of McLaughlin Carriage and McLaughlin Motor Car. In 1904, McLaughlin created &quot;Canada Dry Pale Ginger Ale&quot;. Three years later, the drink was appointed to the Viceregal Household of the Governor General of Canada and the label featuring a beaver atop a map of Canada was replaced with the present crown and shield label.
When McLaughlin began shipping his product to New York, it became so popular that he opened a plant in Manhattan shortly thereafter. After McLaughlin&#x27;s death in 1914, the company was run briefly by his brother, Samuel McLaughlin. P. D. Saylor and Associates bought the business from the McLaughlin family in 1923 and formed Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., a public company.

Canada Dry&#x27;s popularity as a mixer began during Prohibition, when its flavor helped mask the taste of homemade liquor. In the 1930s, Canada Dry expanded worldwide. From the 1950s onward, the company introduced a larger number of products, including Cactus Cooler.

Norton Simon took an interest in the company in 1964, and it merged with Simon&#x27;s other holdings, the McCall Corporation and Hunt Foods, to form Norton Simon Inc. Dr Pepper bought Canada Dry from Norton Simon in 1982. In 1984, Dr Pepper was acquired by Forstmann Little &amp; Company, and Canada Dry was sold to R. J. Reynolds&#x27; Del Monte Foods unit to pay off acquisition debt. RJR Nabisco sold its soft drink business to Cadbury Schweppes in 1986. Today, Canada Dry is owned by Keurig Dr Pepper, which was spun off from Cadbury Schweppes in 2008.

===&#x27;Made from Real Ginger&#x27; lawsuits===
In 2019, Canada Dry faced false advertising lawsuits from a few consumers who requested class action status. Although the ingredients included a natural flavour extract made from ginger root, the plaintiffs said the drink did not have enough ginger flavor for people to be able to taste it, and that they thought the advertising slogan indicated that the drink was &quot;made by chopping or powdering the root of the ginger plant&quot;, instead of using a small amount of liquid extracted from a ginger root. To settle this lawsuit, the company decided to stop making this claim in the US and to offer between US$5.20 and $40 to affected US consumers.

In early 2019, a class-action lawsuit was requested in Canada, where the Canadian Food Inspection Agency regulations specify that ingredients in food may be described as &quot;real&quot; if that ingredient &quot;is present in the food, regardless of what form (e.g., frozen, powdered, ground, concentrated, etc.)&quot;. In a settlement, Canada Dry Mott&#x27;s Inc. agreed to pay $200,000, inclusive of all expenses and fees, plus disbursements of $18,607.61, but it did not require the defendant to change its product labelling or advertising for products marketed in Canada. The settlement amount was to be distributed to the class members by way of cy-près donation to the Law Foundation of British Columbia, while two lead plaintiffs, Victor Cardoso and Lionel Ravvin, received $1,500 each.

The subjectivity of how much ginger is necessary before a product can be fairly described as being &quot;made from real ginger&quot; prompted one author to quip that &quot;The truth is in the lie of the beholder&quot;.


==Marketing==
Nylon Studios produced the song used in the Rabbit&#x27;s &quot;Jack&#x27;s Farm&quot; commercial featuring Canada Dry Ginger Ale. A Cantonese version of the ad was also produced.

<text>The Pontiac Fiero is a rear mid-engine, light sports car manufactured and marketed by Pontiac for model years 1984 – 1988. Intended as an economical commuter car with modest performance aspirations, it was Pontiac&#x27;s first two-seater since their 1926 to 1938 coupes, and the first rear mid-engine mass-produced car by any American manufacturer.

In addition to using 4- and 6-cylinder engines to help Pontiac meet America&#x27;s &#x27;CAFE&#x27; average fuel economy requirements, the Fiero&#x27;s chassis and structure technology used non-load-bearing, composite body-panels, contributing to the car&#x27;s light-weight and unique selling proposition. Pontiac engineers modified the design over its life to enhance its performance and reposition the two-seater closer to the implications of its sporty configuration.

The Fiero &quot;2M4&quot; (two-seat, mid-engine, four-cylinder) was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1984, and was the Official Pace Car of the Indianapolis 500 for 1984.

A total of 370,168 Fieros were manufactured over five years&#x27; production. After suffering criticisms related to its mild performance as well as reliability and safety issues, the Fiero was discontinued after annual sales fell steadily.

== History and design ==
The Fiero was conceived as a small, two-seat sports car with all new suspension and a V6 engine. While General Motors&#x27;s management were opposed to investing in a second two-seater sports car that might compete with the Corvette, young Pontiac engineers in 1978 were able to sell the Fiero concept to the corporation as a fuel-efficient four-cylinder &quot;commuter car&quot; that just happened to have two seats, rather than a muscle car. When the engineers brought back a running prototype in less than six months, it was given the green light for production.

They perceived the oil crisis as a market opportunity for a fuel-efficient sporty commuter car. The Fiero was redesigned to use a fuel efficient version of GM&#x27;s four-cylinder Iron Duke engine capable of in the city and on the highway with the economy-ratio transmission option. The fuel economy was considered as impressive for a 2.5 L engine of the period, but the three-speed automatic reduced highway mileage to only . With respect to fuel economy, the Fiero appealed to a market niche distinct from the Corvette&#x27;s.

Pontiac assigned oversight of the Fiero project to Hulki Aldikacti, a Turkish born executive with over twenty years of experience. Its design was unusual for GM, and stood out from their other products. The two-seater&#x27;s development budget from design to plant retooling, was 400 million dollars, a fraction of a typical GM development budget.

Aldikacti&#x27;s initial challenge was with GM&#x27;s corporate structure, which split its engineers into two categories: the car engineers who would create blueprints for the car, and manufacturing engineers who would work out the fabrication and assembly issues. Fiero blueprints traveled back and forth between the two engineering branches, resulting in a waste of time and money. Aldikacti was forced to sit the two teams of engineers down next to one another, allowing for no excuses as to why there was &quot;no build&quot; after his design was done. Many modifications in the Fiero&#x27;s designs were needed to be made for production; for instance, despite his long-standing interest in manufacturing body panels from plastic, Aldikacti consented to metal body pieces, the dies for which were much less costly.

As the prototypes took shape, the tight budget took its toll on the design, particularly on Aldikacti&#x27;s dream of a high-performance, aluminum-block V6; the cost of developing a new engine would be more than the production of the whole car itself. Instead, Aldikacti was forced to settle for the already manufactured four-cylinder engine GM produced for Pontiac, the &quot;Iron Duke,&quot; nicknamed for its heavy iron block.

The word &quot;Fiero&quot; means &quot;very proud&quot;, &quot;fierce&quot;, &quot;bold&quot;, &quot;haughty&quot; &quot;cruel&quot;, &quot;severe&quot; in Italian, and &quot;wild&quot;, &quot;fierce&quot;, or &quot;ferocious&quot; in Spanish. Alternative names considered for the car were Sprint (which had previously been used on a GMC and would later end up being used for a Chevrolet instead), P3000, Pegasus, Fiamma, Sunfire (a name which would later be applied to another Pontiac), and Firebird XP.

Aldikacti&#x27;s unorthodox design methods and personal manner made him unpopular to most of GM&#x27;s bureaucracy. He was told by counterparts at other GM divisions three times that the Fiero project had been cancelled by corporate management. However, the project was kept alive by high-ranked defenders, chiefly William Hoglund, who took over Pontiac in 1980, when the brand&#x27;s popularity was heavily diluted and its cars could be described as outdated. In 1983 Hoglund told his top three dozen staffers that Pontiac would rebuild itself with cars that were exciting and different — terms that described Aldikacti&#x27;s &quot;commuter car&quot;. In order to meet Hoglund&#x27;s marketing teams goal of 100,000 cars a year, Hoglund negotiated a deal to reopen a plant once shut down in the heart of Pontiac, Michigan. He and his staff wanted to prove that cooperation between management and labor could be solved without the use of robots on the assembly line, which GM&#x27;s top executives wanted. Likewise, Hoglund allowed the hourly paid workers to choose the two-seater&#x27;s name — hence the name &quot;Fiero.&quot;

A mid-engine layout was chosen to reduce both aerodynamic drag and vehicle weight; to improve fuel efficiency, and to offer handling, traction, and braking benefits. The performance potential of the mid-engine layout was not realized when the Fiero debuted. As cost-saving measures, the tires, brakes, and suspension components were carried over from other GM platforms such as the X and T platforms. As a result, the handling abilities of the Fiero were merely on par with other contemporary sporty coupes.

The Fiero received positive reviews for its handling (Motor Trend 1984), as well as negative reviews for not meeting expectations of higher performance from its mid-engine configuration. Despite the criticism, the Fiero sold well and although Pontiac operated three shifts at the factory during 1984, they could not keep up with initial demand.

The sharing of suspension and other components with other GM cars meant the rear suspension and powertrain was virtually identical to that of the Phoenix; the Fiero even included rear tie rod ends attached to a &quot;steering knuckle&quot;, although these were hard-mounted to the engine cradle and only used for maintaining the rear tire alignment.

As the oil crisis eased by 1985, demand developed for more engine power and better performance. Pontiac responded by introducing the GT model which included upgraded suspension tuning, wider tires, and a V6 engine having more than the base four-cylinder.

In 1988, changes included a completely redesigned suspension (and parts of the space frame) along with two-piece brake calipers and upgraded brake rotors — the latter which had been conceived with the initial design. The available I4 and V6 engines benefited from evolutionary improvements, but the planned availability of turbochargers and newer DOHC engines did not happen before production stopped.

In spite of the design finally realizing its potential, sales had declined and GM ended production.

==Production years==
===1984===

The Fiero began production in August 1983. In an effort to sell the car as economically sensible, GM equipped and sold the Fiero as a commuter car; although the marketing build-up leading to initial release indicated anything but a regular commuter. The car also proved uncomfortable for some drivers because of the lack of power steering.

At the beginning of production the Fiero was only available in Red (M71) and White (M40) colors with Black (M41) and Light Gray Metallic (M14) introduced later, the paint shop was only able to handle four different colors at a time. All 1984 models came with the same 2.5 L I4.

Although sales literature listed only two models available in 1984, there were at least three models available with different optional packages. There was the Fiero Coupe, the Sport Coupe and the SE. The Fiero Coupe, also called &quot;Fuel Economy Leader&quot;, came with the MY-8 4-speed manual transaxle that had a 0.73 overdrive top gear along with a high mpg 3.32:1 axle ratio. This gave it an EPA highway/city rating of 50/31 mpg. Air conditioning and automatic transaxle could not be ordered. The starting price for the Fiero Coupe was $7,999. The Fiero Sport Coupe, also referred to as the &quot;base car&quot;, came with the M-19 four-speed manual with a 0.81 top gear along with 4.10:1 differential, giving it better acceleration at the cost of fuel economy, 42/26 mpg. An automatic 3-speed transmission, MD-9 Hydramatic 125-C, was available along with A/C which was shared with the Pontiac Sunbird. The starting price was $8,499 ($ in dollars ) for the Sport Coupe. The top model was the Fiero SE, starting at $9,599 ($ in dollars ), it included the WS6 handling package along with other trim upgrades.

The marketing included title sponsorship of Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates tour supporting the release of their &quot;Big Bam Boom&quot; album. From November 1984 through 1985, each tour venue had Fiero banners and signage above the main stage, new Fieros on display, and Pontiac dealer ticket giveaways. Sales managers at Pontiac dealerships also received a limited edition &quot;Pontiac Fiero Presents Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates&quot; vinyl greatest hits album enticing them to participate in the sponsorship tour. The LP was &quot;Rock &#x27;n Soul Part 1&quot;. The album cover featured Hall &amp; Oates standing with a red 1984 Fiero SE.

Also, for marketing purposes, the 1984 base model was featured in a 1983 episode of the television show &quot;Hardcastle &amp; McCormick&quot;.

The 1984 model line included a limited &quot;Indy Pace Car&quot; edition, consisting of an Indianapolis 500-themed option package on &quot;SE&quot;-model vehicles (a package that was specially reissued in 1985). Approximately 2,000 of these vehicles were sold. The Indy had aero body cladding and new front and rear fascias that would be used on the 1985 GT. Only the four-cylinder engine was available, though a few prototypes were fitted with a unique periscope-style inlet sprouting from the engine compartment and curving up and over the roof. This &quot;periscope&quot; style inlet was used on the three actual Indy Pace Cars used at the 1984 Indianapolis 500. This inlet scoop fed the Super Duty engine which was only exclusive to the actual Pace Cars. The Super Duty engine was rated at at 6,500 rpm and of torque at 5,500 rpm. Pontiac&#x27;s general manager Bill Hoglund nominated John Callies to drive the actual pace car at Indy. Callies was the factory&#x27;s lead engineer on both the pace car and IMSA programs. The Fiero became the first 4-cylinder car to pace the 500 since a Stoddard-Dayton paced the 1914 race.

The production of the 1984 model ran from July 1983, until almost the end of 1984, this resulted in Pontiac exceeding its first year goal of 80,000 units, which was 28,000 more than the initial estimate and the most two seater cars produced by any US manufacturer at the time.

=== 1985 ===
The 1985 Fiero did not appear in showrooms until January 1985, with the introduction of the GT model, which looked very similar to the 1984 Indy model without the decals or body color wheels. The three models, and four colors from the previous year were still available and the complaint about insufficient power was addressed, much to the satisfaction of the general public. A V6 engine rated at and was put into the car, satisfying most critics of the base engine. The V6 was paired with a modified Muncie 4-speed transmission. The four-cylinder engine was slightly modified, adding roller lifters and resulting in a power increase of . It could now also be paired with a Japanese-designed Isuzu five-speed transmission as used in the J-body platform, also produced at the Muncie, Indiana plant.

===1986===
The 1986 Fiero arrived on September 12, 1985, however, the GT model was not originally listed. The previous year&#x27;s GT became the 1986 SE. The 1986 GT was delayed until January 3, 1986. This was the first time the fastback roofline was offered, sometimes referred to as a &quot;1986½&quot; model, as the new fastback body restyle was not yet ready for release at the start of the model year. Though originally conceived by Pontiac insiders as a new model, possibly called the &quot;GTP&quot; or &quot;GTU,&quot; it has been said that GM management at the time felt that using &quot;GTP&quot; or &quot;GTU&quot; suggested a racing car, an image they did not want to promote. Individuals present at the unveiling of the new fastback roof style, in February 1984, at GM&#x27;s Arizona test track, actually thought it was a new Corvette at first. The Muncie/Getrag 5-speed transaxle, which did not arrive until June 1986, became the standard transaxle in V6 models. Models equipped with the four-cylinder engine received minor changes. Standard wheels were now 14-inch and the SE receives the GT&#x27;s aerodynamic front end and rear spoiler. Stereo speakers were now mounted in the sail panels instead of the headrests. The new Performance Sound System includes a 5 1/4-inch subwoofer with an amplifier. Red and Light Gray Metallic colors were dropped in favour of Light Gold Metallic (M56), Silver Metallic (M16) and Bright Red (M81). The clutch hydraulic systems were redesigned with new master and slave cylinders and the optional air conditioner gets a lighter compressor and condenser.

===1987===
1987 saw changes to the front and rear fascias on the &quot;base coupe&quot; with the SE and GT models keeping the same &quot;Aero&quot; nose. The new non-aero noses lost the black bumper pads of the earlier models and had a smoother look. The four-cylinder engine&#x27;s power rating increased to with some major modifications which included a roller cam, redesigned intake manifold, distributorless ignition system (DIS), open combustion chamber cylinder head and upgraded throttle-body fuel injection system. This was the last year for the spin-on oil filter on the four-cylinder. Bright Blue (M21) and Medium Red Metallic (M77) were added and replacing the ribbed black molding was the round style found on the GT models. As a side note, the SE models retained the ribbed molding, and added the aero nose found on the GT. Redesigned headlight motors appeared in 1987. Additionally, starting with the 1987 model Pontiac dealerships offered an upgrade in the form of an &quot;option&quot; that changed the original body to a Pininfarina Ferrari 308-type body, called the Fiero Mera. Corporate Concepts completed the &quot;Mera&quot; transformation and none were sold as kit form. The Mera body change was offered only on new Fieros, sold through Pontiac dealers and is considered a model in its own right. Only 247 Meras were produced by Corporate Concepts before production was halted when Corporate Concepts was sued by Ferrari.

===1988===
The 1988 Fiero brought a new suspension design, thought by many to have a striking resemblance to those designed by Lotus (in whom GM had held a 91-percent stake since October 1986). The suspension was never a Lotus design, though – it was the suspension the Pontiac engineers had designed in the beginning, along with what they learned from the racing program; however, some ideas may have come from Lotus. Up front were revised control arms and knuckles that reduced steering effort and improved the scrub radius. At the rear, a tri-link suspension with all new knuckles was installed. This new suspension came with staggered wheel sizes on WS6 suspension equipped models, with by wide wheels up front and by wide wheels in the rear for improved handling balance and to offset the slightly increased front track that resulted from the improvements. Topping off the package were the new vented disc brakes at all four corners, which addressed braking complaints of road testers. A variable effort electro-hydraulic power steering unit, the same design later found on the GM EV1, was also to be a late addition. This option never made it to production – one reason cited is that models with the prototype power steering were noted as being too loud. The four-cylinder engine received an in-pan oil filter element and balance shaft. A &quot;Formula&quot; option was added, which offered many of the GT features with the standard coupe body, including the speedometer, WS6 Suspension (which includes offset crosslace wheels) and the rear spoiler. 1988 marked the end of production for the Fiero. Improvements to suspension, brakes, steering, and improvements to both the four-cylinder and V6 engines took the car to a level far beyond the 1984 model that had received much criticism. 1988 was also the only year a yellow exterior color was available as a factory option. On August 16, 1988, the last Fiero rolled off the Pontiac, Michigan, plant line.
The last Fiero built was presented to a GM assembler, and was kept pristine with just over 500 miles on the odometer. It was sold in December 2020 for $90,000.00.

===1989/1990 (prototype)===


A prototype of the never-produced 1989/1990 Fiero was displayed at the 20th Anniversary show in July 2003, at Fierorama 2005, at the Michigan show in 2006 and most recently at the 25th Anniversary Show in Pontiac, Michigan, in 2008. GM Heritage Center continues storing the 1989/1990 Fiero. Many of the 1989/1990 Fiero prototypes had been demolished in a scrap yard in Australia.

Much of its design influence is apparent in the Fourth Generation Firebird. New engines were proposed for the 1989/1990 model year, from the then new DOHC &quot;Quad 4&quot; four-cylinder as a base engine to replace the 2.5 L &quot;Iron Duke&quot; to a new 200+ hp DOHC V-6 for the GT models. Even a 231 CID (3.8 L) Buick Turbo V6 powered Fiero is rumored to have been seen at a test track. The single 1989/1990 Fiero GT prototype had an early version of the upcoming DOHC V-6 that would be put into production in the Grand Prix and Lumina Z34 in the early 1990s. This engine developed more than .

GM cited slumping and unprofitable sales of the Fiero as the reason for its demise following its 5th model year.

==Technical features==
===Engines===
The Fiero was available with the &quot;LR8&quot; I4, and &quot;L44&quot; V6.

====SD4====
The SD4 (Super Duty 4-cylinder) was the last in a line of high-performance Pontiac engines. A SD4 engine powered the 1984 Indy Fiero Pace Car to over during the race. The SD4 was never available in a production vehicle, however Pontiac&#x27;s Performance Parts counter had all the SD4 parts available and one could garner a version and a version. All 2000 Indy Fiero replicas came with the Iron Duke engine.

===Transmissions===
====Automatic====
All automatic-equipped Fieros were equipped with the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 125 with torque converter lockup (RPO MD9).
Automatic transmission final drive ratios:

*I4
**1984–1986: 3.18 (RPO &quot;F75&quot;)
**1987–1988: 2.84 (RPO &quot;F17&quot;)
*V6
**1985–1986: 3.18 (RPO &quot;F75&quot;)
**1986 SE: 3.06 (RPO &quot;FW2&quot;)
**1986 GT, 1987–1988: 3.33 (RPO &quot;GX3&quot;)
*THM-125 gear ratios
**1st gear: 2.84
**2nd gear: 1.60
**3rd gear: 1.00
**Reverse: 2.07

====Manual====
All four-speed manual transmissions were built at the Muncie, Indiana, Allison plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance four-speed with a final drive ratio of 4.10, and an economy four-speed with a final drive ratio of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model and part of the 1986 production year came with a four-speed with a final drive ratio of 3.65. The lower-geared 4.10 four-speed transmission showed improved acceleration, but sacrificed fuel economy.

Isuzu and Muncie (Getrag) five-speed transmissions were available, depending on model and equipment beginning in 1985 for the Isuzu five-speed which came on four-cylinder cars and in 1986 for the Muncie five-speed which came on V6 equipped cars. The Getrag 282 five-speed is sometimes referred to as the Muncie 282 or the Muncie Getrag 282, as the design was licensed to General Motors for manufacture by Muncie (Getrag never built the 282). This Muncie transmission is the stronger unit, designed for use with the higher output of the V6.

===Crash safety===
The unique plastic body-on-spaceframe design, helped the Fiero to achieve a NHTSA NCAP frontal crash test rating of five stars, the highest rating available.

According to Hemmings Motor News, the exceedingly sturdy, space frame consisted of roughly 280 separate galvanized and high-strength steel stampings joined by 3,800 welds and, when assembled with the Fiero&#x27;s mechanicals, was fully driveable without its skin. The Fiero&#x27;s body panels are purely cosmetic (and aerodynamic) and carry no structural load. The Fiero was the second safest vehicle sold in America from 1984 to 1988, beaten only by the Volvo 740DL station wagon.

The official crash test scores were as follows:

*Head Injury Criterion – 356.5/308.6
*Chest Deceleration (G) – 30.9/29.9
*Femur Load (LB) – Left 840/800 Right 800/740

The Fiero&#x27;s technologically advanced spaceframe technology went on to be incorporated in the Saturn S-Series cars and the 1990-96 GM U platform minivans.

==Problems and issues==
Safety issues escalated rapidly by the summer of 1987, when the fire count for 1984 models reached a rate of 20 fires per month. Fieros were catching fire at the rate of one for every 508 cars sold, surpassing all other mass-market automobile cars. Pontiac engineers knew about the problems early on: one wrote an urgent memo dated October 6, 1983, to report that two Fieros had suddenly caught fire during test drives. This was only 3 months after the production of the Fiero began. It was first thought to be caused by antifreeze leaking out of poorly installed hoses, when in reality it was defective connecting rods. After one meeting with the Saginaw foundry manager, he wrote that &quot;60 percent to 90 percent of the rods produced do not exhibit defects.&quot; This means at least every 1 out of 10 rods produced were defective and possibly 4 out of 10 were also defective. The Associated Press quoted the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as saying it had &quot;...received 148 complaints regarding Pontiac Fieros catching fire including reports of six injuries. Low levels of engine oil may cause a connecting rod to break, allowing oil to escape and come into contact with engine parts. The oil would catch fire when it contacted the exhaust manifold or hot exhaust components.&quot; David Hudgens, a GM spokesman in Detroit said &quot;if you ran out of oil, and then that coupled with some aggressive driving, perhaps, and maybe not changing the oil very often, you end up with a broken rod, and that&#x27;s where the connecting rod came in; it is still the owner&#x27;s responsibility to check the oil.&quot;

The Pontiac division said in a 1988 press release that &quot;GM tests have shown that running these 1984 cars with low engine oil level can cause connecting rod failure which may lead to an engine compartment fire. Pontiac is aware of 260 fires attributable to the condition, along with ten reported minor injuries.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The Fiero is a popular base car for replicas of supercars such as Ferraris and Lamborghinis, as well as for various other kit cars, due to being one of the least expensive mid-engine cars available on the market.

===Legacy===
When the Fiero&#x27;s 1984 model was introduced, it played a major role in building the &quot;excitement&quot; image that the Pontiac Division Motor Company wanted to establish in its car buyers. This car pioneered new concepts such as the participation of autoworkers in production methods as well as new materials provide a showcase as the first production car in the world to use a space/frame chassis with a separate body shell composed of SMC Sheet Molded Composite. According to Design News, Pontiac engineers pointed out that the Fiero experience helped the company to develop the sporty look of the Grand Am and Sunbird, as well as &quot;road car&quot; features in the once-traditional Bonneville and Grand Prix. Such Fiero advances as the composite skin lived on in new GM products like the Saturn.

===Scale models===

Several diecast model manufacturers have replicated the Fiero in various scales. Hot Wheels released a 1984 Fiero 2M4 under many paint schemes. Matchbox and Majorette also released Fiero models during the car&#x27;s heyday. Monogram has released and re-released a 1985 Fiero GT model (the re-release is currently available). In recent years, a large 1:18 die-cast model of a 1985 GT was available in red and silver colors. In 2007 the Motor Max toy company began making small die-cast Fiero GT toys under the &quot;American Graffiti&quot; and &quot;Fresh Cherries&quot; lines. Select Wal-Mart locations sold a special &quot;Since &#x27;68&quot; Fiero made by Hot Wheels, which uses the original 1984 mold with a new paint job. The Kenner toy line M.A.S.K. had a black Fiero GT that converted into a glider craft and three wheeled chopper, called &quot;Fireforce.&quot; Tonka&#x27;s toy line Gobots included a character, &quot;Sparky&quot;, who converted into a 1984 Fiero 2M4 (called a &quot;P-car&quot; on the packaging). Also worth mention is the &quot;Transformers&quot; character Punch/Counterpunch, a spy who converts into a vehicle looking similar to a 1985 Fiero GT, but modified to avoid trademark issues. Other plastic-kit display models were released by MPC-ERTL in 1:25 scale. One was a 1984 2M4 kit 10883, the other was 1987 (essentially identical to 1986) GT kit 6401.

<doc id="683035" wikidata="Q1336046" url="?curid=683035" title="United States Auto Club">
<text>The United States Auto Club (USAC) is one of the sanctioning bodies of auto racing in the United States. From 1956 to 1979, USAC sanctioned the United States National Championship, and from 1956 to 1997 the organization sanctioned the Indianapolis 500. USAC serves as the sanctioning body for a number of racing series, including the Silver Crown Series, National Sprint Cars, National Midgets, Speed2 Midget Series, .25 Midget Series, Stadium Super Trucks, and GT World Challenge America. Seven-time USAC champion Levi Jones is USAC&#x27;s Competition Director.

==History==
When the American Automobile Association (AAA) withdrew from auto racing after the 1955 season, citing the Le Mans disaster and the death of Bill Vukovich at Indianapolis as contributing factors, both the SCCA and NASCAR were mentioned as its potential successor. Ultimately, USAC was formed by Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman. It became the arbiter of rules, car design, and other matters for what it termed championship auto racing, the highest level of USAC racing. For a while there was a separate series of specifications for championship cars designed to be run on dirt, rather than paved, tracks. Today, USAC sanction open-wheel racing series such as the Silver Crown Series, National Sprint Car Series, National Midget Series, and Quarter Midgets.

===Triple crown===
The &quot;triple crown&quot; is earned in USAC racing when a driver claims all three national championships (silver crown, sprint car, and midget car). Only two drivers, Tony Stewart (1995) and J. J. Yeley (2003), have achieved the triple crown in a single season. Six other drivers, Pancho Carter (1972–78), Dave Darland (1997–2001), Jerry Coons Jr. (2006–08), Tracy Hines (2000, 2002, 2015), Chris Windom (2016, 2017, 2020), and Logan Seavey (2023-2024) have claimed each of the three championships at least once in their careers. In 2012 Mike Curb and Cary Agajanian became the only car owners to win the triple crown by winning all three championships in the same year.

===National championship===
USAC had awarded a national championship until A. J. Foyt won his seventh title in 1979. It has announced that it will begin awarding a national championship starting in 2010. A driver&#x27;s best 25 finishes are counted toward the championship and the 2010 winner received $40,000. Points are accumulated in the three national series: sprints, midgets, and silver crown. Bryan Clauson of Noblesville, Indiana claimed the inaugural championship, topping runner-up Levi Jones by 14 points.

As of 2013 it has been known as the Mike Curb &quot;Super License&quot; National Championship Award.

===1978 plane crash===
On April 23, 1978, returning from a race at the Trenton Speedway in New Jersey, eight USAC officials, plus the pilot, were killed when their 10-seat Piper Navajo Chieftain crashed during a thunderstorm 25 miles southeast of Indianapolis.

Killed were:
*Ray Marquette, USAC&#x27;s vice-president of public affairs and a former sportswriter for &quot;The Indianapolis Star&quot;
*Frank Delroy, chairman of USAC technical committee
*Shim Malone, starter for USAC races and head of its midget racer division
*Judy Phillips, graphic artist and publication director of USAC&#x27;s newsletter
*Stan Worley, chief registrar
*Ross Teeguarden, assistant technical chairman
*Don Peabody, head of the sprint division
*Dr. Bruce White, assistant staff doctor
*Don Mullendore, owner and pilot of the plane.

The incident closely followed the death of Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony Hulman.

===End of championship car sanctioning===

The plane crash came at a time when Indy car owners and drivers were demanding changes from USAC. Aside from the Indianapolis 500, USAC events were not well attended, and the owners felt that USAC poorly negotiated television rights. The owners also wanted increases in payouts, especially at Indy. Though some think the plane crash was used as an opportunistic way to force change in the sport, it was merely an unfortunate coincidence. The seed of dissent had been growing for several years before the accident, and claims the crash was an immediate cause for the 1979 CART/USAC &quot;split&quot; are considered for the most part unfounded.

Also unpopular were the attempts of USAC to keep the aging Offenhauser engine competitive with the newer, and much more expensive, Cosworth DFX engine using boost-limiting &quot;pop off valves&quot; and limiting the amount of fuel that could be used.

Finally, most car owners banded together to form Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) in 1978, with the first race to be run in 1979. USAC tried unsuccessfully to ban all CART owners from the 1979 Indianapolis 500, finally losing in court before the race began. Both the USAC and CART ran multi-race schedules in 1979.

Indianapolis Motor Speedway president John Cooper was instrumental in forming a joint body of CART and USAC with the creation of the Championship Racing League in March 1980. However, in mid-1980, Cooper forced USAC to renounce their agreement with the CRL if they wanted to keep officiating the Indy 500. After USAC&#x27;s attempt at a 500-mile race at Pocono Raceway – which was boycotted by the CART teams, forcing USAC to fill the field with silver crown cars – USAC and CART eventually settled into a relatively peaceful co-existence, with USAC continuing to sanction the Indianapolis 500 and no other Championship car races, and CART including the race in its schedule between other CART-sanctioned races. USAC continued to sanction the Indy 500 until 1997, when the Indy Racing League (itself product of the second American open-wheel split in 1996) terminated the sanctioning agreement following two consecutive officiating controversies that year; subsequent Indy 500s (and IRL races, as USAC was also involved in IRL&#x27;s racing-related matters up to that point) were sanctioned by the IRL itself, which was renamed the IndyCar Series in 2003.

===Road racing expansion===
Since 2022, the United States Auto Club has sanctioned the USF Juniors, USF2000 Championship, and USF Pro 2000 Championship series, which serve as a ladder series to Indy NXT, along with the Radical Sportscars North American Championships, Skip Barber Racing School, as well as continued sanctioning of the GT World Challenge America and Porsche Sprint Challenge North America under the newly formed Road Racing Division under the direction of Randy Hembrey.

==Active series==
=== USAC Silver Crown Series ===


Beginning in 1971, all dirt races were split from the National Championship. From 1971 to 1980, the series was named &quot;National Dirt Car Championship&quot;, then renamed &quot;Silver Crown Series&quot; in 1981.

=== USAC Western States Midget Series ===
USAC started the Western States Midgets in 1982 utilizing the same cars &amp; engines that race in the USAC National Midgets. The series solely races on dirt ovals across California and Arizona but in past raced on pavement ovals as well. The series does run co-sanctioned races with USAC&#x27;s National Midget Series (including the historic Turkey Night Grand Prix race) and the Bay Cities Racing Association Midgets.

=== USAC 360 Sprint Car Series ===
USAC sanctions several regional 360 c.i.d. non-wing sprint car series across the country. USAC&#x27;s West Coast Sprint Car Series was launched in 2009 by Santa Maria Speedway promoter Chris Kearns, and joined forces with USAC in 2010. The West Coast series primarily races at tracks across California while also having special event races in Nevada. USAC&#x27;s Southwest Sprint Car Series was launched in 1991 as the Arizona Sprint Car Racing Association. The series joined forces with USAC in 2012. The Southwest series primarily races at tracks in Arizona, Nevada and New Mexico while also having special event races in Arkansas, Kansas &amp; Oklahoma. The Southwest series was put on hold after the 2019 season and has not made its way back into the sport since then.

USAC and URC Sprint Car Series promoter Curt Michael joined forces to create the USAC East Coast Sprint Car Series, with the first season beginning in 2018.

Champions



=== USAC Speed2 Midget Series ===
USAC formed the Speed2 Midget Series (formerly known as the Ford Focus Midget Series, Ignite Midget Series and HPD Midget Series) in 2002 with several regional divisions running across the United States on both dirt &amp; pavement oval tracks. With exception to the engine, the cars used are the same as National &amp; Western States Midget cars. The powerplants currently used are 4-cylinder production-based engines with stock internal dimensions to save costs for competitors. The series started out as a spec engine class, originally with Ford supplying their Zetec engine from 2002 to 2012, and then HPD supplying their K24 engine starting in 2013.

National Championship

The Speed2 Midget Series National Champion has been determined in a variety of ways. The inaugural championship, 2005, was decided by a two-race series (one dirt, one pavement). Subsequent national champions were determined by a single &quot;national championship race&quot; held at various locations. This format was used until 2010. In 2011, a points system was instituted to determine the national champion. Counting only a drivers twelve best finishes, the system allowed drivers from multiple regions to compete under a common points structure for a season-long championship. The 2012 season did not award a national champion, however the respective regional champions were honored at USAC Night of Champions.

National Champions

Regional Champions

===USAC Lightning Sprint National Championship===
USAC started the Speedway Motors Lightning Sprint National Championship in 2017 for local tracks running Lightning Sprint cars. The points format counts the 12 best races at USAC sanctioned tracks.

===GT World Challenge America===

Pirelli World Challenge, was started in 1990 and switched to USAC sanctioning in 2017. The championship currently races on road and street courses across the United States and Canada with seven different classes for GT cars &amp; Touring cars. Founded by WC Vision, the series is presently owned by SRO Group.

===Off-road racing===

The Stadium Super Trucks series was founded in 2013 by former NASCAR driver Robby Gordon. It is sanctioned by USAC, though Gordon and sponsorship marketing company The Elevation Group co-own the series.

The USAC also sanctions the American Rally Association, Nitro Rallycross, King of the Hammers and Great American Shortcourse.

==Former series==
=== USAC Championship Car Series ===


===USAC Gold Crown Series===
Starting in 1981, USAC scaled back their participation in Indy car racing outside of the Indianapolis 500. The preeminent national championship season was instead being sanctioned by CART. USAC developed a split-calendar season, beginning in June, and ending in May with the Indy 500. After 1983, however, the Gold Crown schedule would consist of only one event per season (Indy 500), and the Gold Crown title would be regarded largely as ceremonial. The winner of the Indianapolis 500 would be the &quot;de facto&quot; Gold Crown champion, as it was the lone points-paying event. The title and the &quot;series&quot; were retired after the 1994–1995 season with the advent of the Indy Racing League.

=== USAC Stock Cars ===
USAC featured a stock car division from 1956 to 1984.

* The inaugural season featured two subtitles: Pacific Coast (won by Sam Hanks) and Short Track (Troy Ruttman).

===USAC Road Racing Championship===

From 1958 until 1962, USAC sanctioned a road racing championship. It was held for sports cars from 1958 to 1961, and adopted Formula Libre rules in 1962.
===TORC: The Off-Road Championship===
 was founded in 2009 by motocross racer Rick Johnson and it was managed the race operations and officiated the events. USAC took over complete management of the series in 2010. The complete management ended in August 2013 season when it was sold to The Armory. USAC returned to officiation/race control and the series was renamed &quot;TORC: The Off Road Championship&quot; for 2014.

<text>The Basque Country (; ; ) is the name given to the home of the Basque people. The Basque Country is located in the western Pyrenees, straddling the border between France and Spain on the coast of the Bay of Biscay.

Encompassing the Autonomous Communities of the Basque Country and Navarre in Spain and the Northern Basque Country in France, the region is home to the Basque people (), their language (), culture and traditions. The area is neither linguistically nor culturally homogeneous, and certain areas have a majority of people who do not consider themselves Basque, such as the south of Navarre. The concept is still highly controversial, and the Supreme Court of Navarre has upheld a denial of government funding to school books that include the Navarre community within the Basque Country area.

==Etymology==
The name in Basque is &quot;Euskal Herria&quot;. The name is difficult to accurately translate into other languages due to the wide range of meanings of the Basque word &quot;herri&quot;. It can be translated as &quot;nation; country, land; people, population&quot; and &quot;town, village, settlement&quot;. The first part, &quot;Euskal&quot;, is the adjectival form of &quot;Euskara&quot; &quot;the Basque language&quot;. Thus a more literal translation would be &quot;country/nation/people/settlement of the Basque language&quot;, a concept difficult to render into a single word in most other languages.

The two earliest references (in various spelling guises) are in Joan Perez de Lazarraga&#x27;s manuscript, dated around 1564–1567 as and and (&#x27;in the Basque Country&#x27;) and &quot;Heuscal-Herrian&quot; in Joanes Leizarraga&#x27;s Bible translation, published in 1571.

== Territory ==

The term Basque Country refers to a collection of regions inhabited by the Basque people, known as &quot;Euskal Herria&quot; in Basque language, and it is first attested as including seven traditional territories in Axular&#x27;s literary work &quot;Gero&quot; (he goes on to suggest that Basque language is spoken &quot;in many other places&quot;), in the early 17th century. Some Basques refer to the seven traditional districts collectively as &quot;Zazpiak Bat&quot;, meaning &quot;The Seven [are] One&quot;, a motto coined in the late 19th century.

=== Northern Basque Country ===

The Northern Basque Country, known in Basque as &quot;Iparralde&quot; (literally, &quot;the northern part&quot;), is the part of the Basque Country that lies entirely within France, specifically as part of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques &quot;département&quot; of France, and constitutes the Basque Municipal Community. As such it is usually known as French Basque Country (&quot;Pays basque français&quot; in French). In most contemporary sources, it is defined as covering the arrondissement of Bayonne and the cantons of Mauléon-Licharre and Tardets-Sorholus, but sources disagree on the status of the village of Esquiule. Within these conventions, the area of Northern Basque Country (including the of Esquiule) is .


The French Basque Country is traditionally subdivided into three provinces:
* Labourd, historical capital Ustaritz, main settlement today Bayonne (Basque: &quot;Baiona&quot;).
* Lower Navarre, historical capitals Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port (in Basque: &quot;Donibane-Garazi&quot;) and Saint-Palais, main settlement today Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port
* Soule, historical capital Mauléon (Basque: &quot;Maule-Lextarre&quot;) (also current main settlement).

This summary presentation suggests difficulty in justifying the inclusion of a few communes in the lower Adour region. Jean Goyhenetche suggests it would be more accurate to depict the region as the reunion of five entities: Labourd, Lower Navarre, Soule but also Bayonne and Gramont.

=== Southern Basque Country ===

The Southern Basque Country, known in Basque as &quot;Hegoalde&quot; (literally, &quot;the southern part&quot;), is the part of the Basque region that lies completely within Spain. It is frequently known as Spanish Basque Country. It is the largest and most populated part of the Basque Country. It includes two main regions: the Basque Autonomous Community (Vitoria-Gasteiz is the capital) and the Chartered Community of Navarre (capital city Pamplona-Iruña).

The Basque Autonomous Community (7,234 km²) consists of three provinces, specifically designated &quot;historical territories&quot;:

* Araba (capital: Vitoria-Gasteiz)
* Biscay (Basque: &quot;Bizkaia&quot;) (capital: Bilbo)
* Gipuzkoa (capital: Donostia-San Sebastián)

The Chartered Community of Navarre (10,391 km²) is a single-province autonomous community. Its name refers to the charters, the &quot;Fueros of Navarre&quot;. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 states that Navarre may become a part of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country if it is so decided by its people and institutions (the &quot;Disposición transitoria cuarta&quot; or &quot;Fourth Transitory Provision&quot;). To date, there has been no implementation of this law. Despite demands for a referendum by minority leftist forces and Basque nationalists in Navarre, it has been opposed by mainstream Spanish parties and the Navarrese People&#x27;s Union, which was the ruling party until 2015. The Union has repeatedly asked for an amendment to the Constitution to remove this clause.

In addition to those, two enclaves located outside of the respective autonomous community are often cited as being part of both the Basque Autonomous Community and also the Basque Country (greater region).
* The Treviño enclave (280 km²), a Castilian enclave in Araba:
* Valle de Villaverde (20 km²), a Cantabrian exclave in Biscay
* Navarre holds two small administrative strips in Aragon, organised as Petilla de Aragón.

==Climate==
The Basque Country region is dominated by a warm, humid and wet oceanic climate. The coastal area is part of Green Spain and by extension, the climate is similar for Bayonne and Biarritz as well. Inland areas in Navarre and the southern regions of the autonomous community are transitional, with continental Mediterranean climate, with somewhat wider temperature swings between seasons. The list only sources locations in Spain, but Bayonne/Biarritz have a very similar climate to nearby Hondarribia on the Spanish side of the border. The values do not apply to Donostia-San Sebastián, since its weather station is at a higher elevation than the urban core, where temperatures are higher year-round and similar to those in Bilbao and Hondarribia.

==History==
===Ancient period===

According to some theories, Basques may be the least assimilated remnant of the Paleolithic inhabitants of Western Europe (specifically those of the Franco-Cantabrian region known as Azilian) to the Indo-European migrations. Basque tribes were mentioned by Greek writer Strabo and Roman writer Pliny the Elder, including the Vascones, the Aquitani, and others. There is considerable evidence to show their Basque ethnicity in Roman times in the form of place-names, Caesar&#x27;s reference to their customs and physical make-up, the so-called Aquitanian inscriptions recording names of people and gods (approx. 1st century, see Aquitanian language), etc.

Geographically, the Basque Country was inhabited in Roman times by several tribes: the Vascones, the Varduli, the Caristi, the Autrigones, the Berones, the Tarbelli, and the Sibulates. Some ancient place-names, such as Deba, Butrón, Nervión, Zegama, suggest the presence of non-Basque peoples at some point in protohistory. The ancient tribes are last cited in the 5th century, after which track of them is lost, with only Vascones still being accounted for, while extending far beyond their former boundaries, e.g. in the current lands of Álava and most conspicuously around the Pyrenees and Novempopulania.
The territory of the Cantabri encompassed probably present-day Biscay, Cantabria, Burgos and at least part of Álava and La Rioja, i.e. to the west of Vascon territory in the Early Middle Ages, but the ethnic nature of this people, often at odds with and finally overcome by the Visigoths, is not certain. The Vascones around Pamplona, after much fighting against Franks and Visigoths, founded the Kingdom of Pamplona (824), inextricably linked to their kinsmen the Banu Qasi.

All other tribes in the Iberian Peninsula had been, to a great extent, assimilated by Roman culture and language by the end of the Roman period or early period of the Early Middle Ages, while ethnic Basques inhabited well east into the lands of the Pyrenees (Pallars, Val d&#x27;Aran) from the 8th to the 11th century.

===Middle Ages===
In the Early Middle Ages (up to the 9th century) the territory between the Ebro and Garonne rivers was known as Vasconia, a blurred ethnic area and polity struggling to fend off the Frankish feudal authority from the north and the pressure of the Iberian Visigoths and Andalusi Cordovans from the south.

By the turn of the millennium, a receding Carolingian royal authority and establishing feudalism left Vasconia (to become Gascony) fragmented into a myriad of counties and viscounties, e.g. Fezensac, Bigorre, Astarac, Béarn, Tartas, Marsan, Soule, Labourd, etc., out of former tribal systems and minor realms (County of Vasconia), while south of the Pyrenees, besides the above Kingdom of Pamplona, Gipuzkoa, Álava and Biscay arose in the current lands of the Southern Basque Country from the 9th century onward.

These westerly territories pledged intermittent allegiance to Navarre in their early stages, but were annexed to the Kingdom of Castile at the end of the 12th century, so depriving the Kingdom of Navarre of direct access to the ocean. In the Late Middle Ages, important families dotting the whole Basque territory came to prominence, often quarreling with each other for power and unleashing the bloody War of the Bands, only stopped by royal intervention and the gradual shift of power from the countryside to the towns by the 16th century. Meanwhile, the viscounties of Labourd and Soule under English suzerainty were finally incorporated to France after the Hundred Years&#x27; War, with Bayonne remaining the last Plantagenet stronghold up to 1453.

===Modern period===
In Navarre, the civil wars between the Agramont and the Beaumont confederacies paved the way for the Spanish conquest of the bulk of Navarre from 1512 to 1524. The independent Navarre north of the Pyrenees was largely absorbed by France in 1620, despite the fact that King Henry III of Navarre had decreed Navarre&#x27;s permanent independence from France (31 December 1596). In the decades after the Spanish annexation, the Basque Country went through increased religious, ideological and national homogenization, encouraged by new national ideas embraced by the rising Spanish and French absolutist monarchies during the Renaissance.
From 1525, witchcraft allegations originating in a number of Pyrenean valleys on the rearguard of the Lower Navarre front and recent theatre of war (Salazar, Roncal, Burguete, etc.) were followed by the intervention of newly reformed and recent institutions, such as Spain&#x27;s central tribunal Inquisition, the (Navarrese) Royal Tribunals, and the Diocesan Tribunal, who organized a series of trials for alleged witchcraft and heretical practices. In the heat of the Wars of Religion and the struggle for Navarre, persecution came to a head in the hysteria of the 1609–1611 Basque witch trials on both sides of the Spanish-French border, easing afterwards.

In the French Basque Country, its provinces underwent an ever-shrinking self-government status until the French Revolution, when the traditional provinces were reshaped to form the current Basses-Pyrénées department along with Béarn. In the Southern Basque Country, the regional Charters were upheld until the Carlist Wars, when the Basques supported heir-apparent Carlos and his descendants to the cry of &quot;God, Fatherland, King&quot; (The Charters were finally abolished in 1876). The ensuing centralized &quot;status quo&quot; bred dissent and frustration in the region, giving rise to Basque nationalism by the end of the 19th century, influenced by European Romantic nationalism.

Since then, attempts were made to find a new framework for self-empowerment. The occasion seemed to have arrived on the proclamation of the 2nd Spanish Republic in 1931, when a draft statute was drawn up for the Southern Basque Country (Statute of Estella), but was discarded in 1932. In 1936 a short-lived statute of autonomy was approved for the Gipuzkoa, Álava and Biscay provinces, but war prevented any progress. After Franco&#x27;s dictatorship, a new statute was designed that resulted in the creation of the current Basque Autonomous Community and Navarre, with a limited self-governing status, as settled by the Spanish Constitution. However, a significant part of Basque society is still attempting higher degrees of self-empowerment (see Basque nationalism), sometimes by acts of violence (ETA&#x27;s permanent ceasefire in 2010). The French Basque Country, meanwhile, lacks any political or administrative recognition whatsoever, while a majority of local representatives have lobbied to create a Basque department, to no avail.

==Demographics==
The Basque Country has a population of approximately 3 million as of early 2006. The population density, at about is above average for both Spain and France, but the distribution of the population is fairly unequal, concentrated around the main cities. A third of the population is concentrated in the Greater Bilbao metropolitan area, while most of the interior of the French Basque Country and some areas of Navarre remain sparsely populated: density culminates at about for Biscay but falls to in the northern inner provinces of Lower Navarre and Soule.

A significant majority of the population of the Basque country live inside the Basque Autonomous Community (about 2,100,000, or 70% of the population) while about 600,000 live in Navarre (20% of the population) and about 300,000 (roughly 10%) in Northern Basque Country.

José Aranda Aznar writes that 30% of the population in the Basque Country Autonomous Community were born in other regions of Spain and that 40% of the people living in that territory do not have a single Basque parent.

Most of these peoples of Galician and Castilian stock arrived in the Basque Autonomous Community in the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century, as the region became more and more industrialized and prosperous and additional workers were needed to support the economic growth. Descendants of immigrants from other parts of Spain have since been considered Basque for the most part, at least formally.

Over the last 25 years, some 382,000 people have left the Basque Autonomous Community, of which some 230,000 have moved to other parts of Spain. While certainly many of them are people returning to their original homes when starting their retirement, there is also a sizable tract of Basque natives in this group who have moved due to a Basque nationalist political environment (including ETA&#x27;s killings) which they perceive as overtly hostile. These have been quoted to be as high as 10% of the population in the Basque Community.

===Non-Basque minorities===

====Historical minorities====
Various Romani groups existed in the Basque Country and some still exist as ethnic groups. These were grouped together under the generic terms &quot;ijituak&quot; (Gypsies) and &quot;buhameak&quot; (Bohemians) by Basque speakers.
* The Cagots also were found north and south of the mountains. They lived as untouchables in Basque villages and were allowed to marry only among themselves. Their origin is unclear and has historically been surrounded with superstitions. Nowadays, they have mostly assimilated into the general society.
* The Cascarots were a Roma subgroup found mainly in the Northern Basque Country.
* A subgroup of Kalderash Roma resident in the Basque Country were the Erromintxela who are notable for speaking a rare mixed language. This is based on Basque grammar but using Romani-derived vocabulary.
* The Mercheros were Quinqui-speakers, travelling as cattle merchants and artisans. Following the industrialization, they settled in slums near big cities.

In the Middle Ages, many Franks settled along the Way of Saint James in Navarre and Gipuzkoa and to a lesser extent in Bizkaia. This process also happened in Northern Castile. They were all collectively called Franks because most of them came from French regions (Normans, Bretons, Burgundians, Aquitanians etc.) but an important minority of them were in fact of German, Dutch, Italian, English and Swiss stock. Some were also from even more distant lands such as Poland or Denmark. Due to this migration, Gascon was spoken in the centre of Donostia-San Sebastián, until the beginning of the 20th century. Navarre also held Jewish and Muslim minorities but these were expelled or forced to assimilate after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. One of the notable members of such minorities was Benjamin of Tudela.

====Recent immigration====

Much as has been the case for Spain&#x27;s two other major economic poles (Madrid and Catalonia), the Basque Country received significant immigration from other poorer regions of Spain, due to its higher level of economic development and early industrialization. During the second half of the 20th century, such immigrants were commonly referred to by some Basques as , a derogatory term which is less used today. 

Since the 1980s, as a consequence of its considerable economic prosperity, the Basque Country has received an increasing number of immigrants, mostly from Eastern Europe, North Africa, Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and China, settling mostly in the major urban areas. Nevertheless, foreign immigrant population is lower in the Basque country than in Madrid and Catalonia, despite having similar GDP per capita and significantly lower levels of unemployment.

===Language===

Currently, the predominant languages in the Spanish and French Basque Countries are Spanish and French, respectively. In the historical process of forging themselves as nation-states, both the Spanish and French governments have tried more or less intensely to discourage the use of Basque and its linguistic identity. The language chosen for public education is the most obvious expression of this phenomenon, something which surely had an effect on the current status of Basque.

Despite being spoken in a relatively small territory, the rugged features of the Basque countryside and the historically high population density resulted in a heavy dialectal fragmentation throughout history, which increased the value of both Spanish and French respectively as lingua francas. In this regard, the current Standard form of Basque was only introduced in the late 1960s, which helped Basque move away from being perceived – even by its own speakers – as a language unfit for educational purposes.

While the French Republic has historically attempted to absorb ethnic minority groups – including the French Basques – into a linguistically unified state, Spain in turn has accepted intermittently in its history some degree of linguistic, cultural, and political autonomy to the Basques. Altogether there was a gradual language shift towards Spanish language in the Basque-speaking areas of the Spanish Basque Country, a phenomenon initially restricted to the upper urban classes, but progressively reaching the lower classes. Western Biscay, most of Alava and southern Navarre have been Spanish-speaking (or Romance-speaking) for centuries.

But under the regime of Francisco Franco, the government attempted to suppress Basque nationalism and limit the uses of the Basque language. Even the activities of the Euskaltzaindia (Basque Language Academy) were severely curtailed. In general, during these years, cultural activity in Basque was limited to folkloric issues and the Roman Catholic Church, while a higher, yet still limited degree of tolerance was granted to Basque culture and language in Álava and Navarre, since both areas mostly supported Francoist troops during the war.
Nowadays, the Basque Autonomous Community enjoys some cultural and political autonomy and Basque is an official language along with Spanish. Basque is favoured by a set of language policies sponsored by the Basque regional government which aim at the generalization of its use. However, the actual implementation of this official status is patchy and problematic, relying ultimately on the will of the different administrative levels to enforce it—Justice, Health, Administration. It is spoken by approximately a quarter of the total Basque Country, its stronghold being the contiguous area formed by Gipuzkoa, northern Navarre and the Pyrenean French valleys. It is not spoken natively in most of Álava, western Biscay and the southern half of Navarre. Of a total estimation of some 650,000 Basque speakers, approximately 550,000 live in the Spanish Basque country, the rest in the French.

The Basque education system in Spain has three types of schools differentiated by their linguistic teaching models: A, B and D. Model D, with education entirely in Basque, and Spanish as a compulsory subject, is the most widely chosen model by parents. In Navarre, there is an additional G model, with education entirely in Spanish.

The ruling conservative government of &quot;Unión del Pueblo Navarro&quot; opposes Basque nationalist attempts to provide education in Basque through all Navarre (which would include areas where it is not traditionally spoken). Basque language teaching in the public education network is therefore limited to the Basque speaking north and central regions. In the central region, Basque teaching in the public education network is fairly limited, and part of the existing demand is served via private schools or ikastolak. In southern and some central areas this policy has resulted in schoolchildren having to travel sometimes for hours every day in order to attend education provided in the historic language of Navarre, largely relying on public subscription (yearly festival Nafarroa Oinez, solidarity from the ikastola network, donations, etc.) or receiving as a result no allowances for school meals. Even in northern Basque or mixed language areas, allegations raised by Basque speaker associations point regularly to a conspicuous disregard for recognised language rights, e.g. virtual non-existence of Basque language medical assistance across areas where the vast majority is Basque speaking, insufficient Basque speaking librarians, no broadcasting permission in the last 20 years (as of 2013) for the only Basque language radio in Pamplona, Spanish monolingual signalization and even removal of bilingual one, etc. Spanish is or can be spoken in Navarre by the entire population, with few exceptions in remote rural areas.
The European Commission for Regional or Minority Languages to which Spain is signatory has issued a number of recommendations in order to guarantee a real official status for Basque language (2004), e.g. the suppression of the administrative linguistic divides of Navarre for considering it an obstacle to the normal use of Basque and discriminating against Basque speakers, the filing of the case against newspaper Euskaldunon Egunkaria and restitution to its normal operation, as well as guarantees to prisoners of receiving and sending correspondence in Basque, to mention but a few.

The situation of the Basque language in the French Basque Country is vulnerable (as rated by Unesco). The pressure of French as a well-established mainstream language and different administrative obstacles to the consolidation of Basque-language schooling make the language&#x27;s future prospects uncertain. On 14 June 2013, pointing to the 1850 Falloux act and declaring thereafter that French is the official language of France, the regional subprefect declared illegal the Hendaye council&#x27;s subsidies to finance a new building for a Basque-language school. On 6 November 2013, the Basque language school network in the French Basque Country, Seaska, bitterly criticized the French state before UNESCO for not complying with its international commitments and actually failing to accept minorities by violating their linguistic rights. In November 2013, France decided not to ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages.

==Universities==

The earliest university in the Basque Country was the University of Oñati, founded in 1540 in Hernani and moved to Oñati in 1548. It lasted in various forms until 1901. In 1868, in order to fulfill the need for college graduates for the thriving industry that was flourishing in the Bilbao area, there was an unsuccessful effort to establish a Basque-Navarrese University. Nonetheless, in 1897 the Bilbao Superior Technical School of Engineering (the first modern faculty of engineering in Spain), was founded as a way of providing engineers for the local industry; this faculty is nowadays part of the University of the Basque Country. Almost at the same time, the urgent need for business graduates led to the establishment of the Commercial Faculty by the Jesuits, and, some time thereafter, the Jesuits expanded their university by formally founding the University of Deusto in Deusto (now a Bilbao neighbourhood) by the turn of the century, a private university where the Commercial Faculty was integrated. The first modern Basque public university was the Basque University, founded 18 November 1936 by the autonomous Basque government in Bilbao in the midst of the Spanish Civil War. It operated only briefly before the government&#x27;s defeat by Francisco Franco&#x27;s fascist forces.

Several faculties, originally teaching only in Spanish, were founded in the Basque region in the Francisco Franco era. A public faculty of economics was founded in Sarriko (Bilbao) in the 1960s, and a public faculty of medicine was also founded during that decade, thus expanding the college graduate schools. However, all the public faculties in the Basque Country were organized as local branches of Spanish universities. For instance, the School of Engineering was treated as a part of the University of Valladolid, some away from Bilbao. Indeed, the lack of a central governing body for the public faculties of the Bilbao area, namely those of Economics in Sarriko, Medicine in Basurto, Engineering in Bilbao and the School of Mining in Barakaldo (est. 1910s), was seen as a gross handicap for the cultural and economic development of the area, and so, during the late 1960s many formal requests were made to the Francoist government in order to establish a Basque public university that would unite all the public faculties already founded in Bilbao. As a result of that, the University of Bilbao was founded in the early 1970s, which has now evolved into the University of the Basque Country with campuses in the western three provinces.

In Navarre, Opus Dei manages the University of Navarre with another campus in San Sebastián. Additionally, there is also the Public University of Navarre, with campus in Pamplona and in Tudela, managed by the Navarrese Foral Government.

Mondragón Corporación Cooperativa has established its institutions for higher education as the Mondragon University, based in Mondragón and nearby towns.

There are numerous other significant Basque cultural institutions in the Basque Country and elsewhere. Most Basque organizations in the United States are affiliated with NABO (North American Basque Organizations, Inc.).

==Politics==
Since the last quarter of the 20th century, there have been very different political views on the significance of the Basque Country, with some Basque nationalists aiming to create an independent state including the whole area, and Spanish nationalism denying the very existence of the Basque Country. The dynamics of controversial decisions imposed by Spanish tribunals on Basque nationalist parties ideologically close to ETA left for over a decade a distorted representation of the Basque politics in local councils and regional parliaments, as well as a swiftly changing array of disbanded party names, new alliances, and re-accommodations (since 1998).

During the 2011 Spanish parliamentary elections, the coalition Amaiur (former Batasuna plus Eusko Alkartasuna) came up first in parliamentary seats (7) and second only to UPN-PP (5 seats) in popular vote in the Southern Basque Country, followed closely by the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (5 seats). Geroa Bai secured a seat in Navarre, with the Basque Nationalist Party getting 5 (all from Basque Autonomous Community).

Despite Amaiur&#x27;s results, the group was refused a parliamentary group in an unprecedented decision in the Spanish Parliament, on the grounds that the coalition&#x27;s MPs represented two different constituencies. As a result, Amaiur (5th political group in the Spanish Parliament altogether) remained in the &quot;Grupo Mixto&quot; with a myriad of different parties from all over Spain, while the so-called &quot;Basque Group&quot; includes only the 5 members of the PNV and the Basque Autonomous Community (Euskadi).

However, in December 2015, the Spanish parliamentary elections saw the rise of Podemos (7 MPs) and the Basque Nationalist Party (6 MPs) at the expense of EH Bildu (2 MPs), while Madrid-based mainstream parties continued their steady decline trend, with the Spanish Conservatives (allied with UPN in Navarre) getting 4 MPs, and the Socialists 4 MPs.

In the Northern Basque Country, the French right is the most popular political faction, but since its creation the coalition EH Bai (the northern equivalent of EH Bildu) has seen a rise in popularity, and in the 2020 municipal and 2021 departmental elections the coalition came up second in popular vote.

===Parties with presence in all the Basque Country===
* The Basque Nationalist Party (EAJ-PNV-PNB) is the oldest of all nationalist parties, with over 100 years of history. It is Christian-democrat and has evolved towards rather moderate positions though it still keeps the demand for self-determination and eventual independence. It is the main party in the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC) and is the most voted party (about 40% population), but its presence in Navarre is minor and subsumed in Geroa Bai, while it remains marginal in the French Basque Country.
* Eusko Alkartasuna (EA) (&quot;Basque Solidarity&quot;). A splinter group from PNV since 1984, unleashed by EAJ-PNV&#x27;s compromise with the Spanish right in Navarre against the opinion of the local branch in exchange for support in Bilbao. The party was led by charismatic &quot;lehendakari&quot; Carlos Garaikoetxea for years. The party is defined as social-democrat, and is quite more emphatic in its nationalist claims than EAJ-PNV. After Carlos Garaikoetxea retired, Begoña Errazti was elected for the chair of the party. EA went through unfavourable electoral results, the party split with a splinter group founding the half-hearted party Hamaikabat based in Gipuzkoa. Under the leadership of Peio Urizar, Eusko Alkartasuna gained momentum and moved towards an understanding with figures close to former Batasuna and new faces hailing from the same sociological environment. The party is a co-founder of the coalitions EH Bildu in the South and EH Bai in the North.
* Sortu (&quot;Create&quot;) is a party founded in February 2011 spearheaded by relevant public figures and low-profile political leaders aiming to fill the sociological and political void left by outlawed parties Euskal Herritarrok (&quot;We Basque Citizens&quot;), and Batasuna (&quot;Unity&quot;). Its ideology is Basque nationalist and socialist, rejects violence as a means of achieving political goals, and values civic and pacific disobedience as a legitimate way of opposing arbitrary and authoritarian policies. It is included in the coalition EH Bildu in the South and in EH Bai in the North.

===Parties with presence only in the French Basque Country===

* Abertzaleen Batasuna (&quot;Patriots&#x27; Union&quot;), the main radical left wing Basque nationalist party in the North.
* Euskal Herria Bai (EH Bai), a left-wing coalition formed by Abertzaleen Batasuna, Sortu and Eusko Alkartasuna (Batasuna also took part in its creation). EH Bai has become the main nationalist force in the North, and has taken a more moderate stance on historical nationalist demands than its predecessors.
* Renaissance (formerly La République En Marche), the party of liberal French President Emmanuel Macron. In the Basque Country it is allied with the traditional French right and other center-right parties.
* The Republicans, the traditional French conservative party, and one of the main forces in the Northern Basque Country.
* Union of Democrats and Independents, a center-right France-wide party, an ally of The Republicans and Renaissance, and the party of the president of the Northern Basque Country Jean-René Etchegaray. 
* French Socialist Party, formerly the hegemonic center-left party in France. Even though it has lost much support in recent years it has remained relevant in Basque politics. 
* Europe Ecology – The Greens, the main French green party. The greens are one of the main allies of the left-wing Basque nationalists in France.
* National Rally, far-right, France-wide.

===Parties with presence in all of the Spanish Basque Country===

* Euskal Herria Bildu (&quot;Basque Country Gather&quot;), a left-wing Basque nationalist coalition formed by EA, Sortu and Alternatiba. It is the main opposition in the BAC and the third party in the Navarrese parliament (as of 2023). Even though the coalition is considered the successor of Batasuna, it is much more moderate and officially rejects political violence. Currently it is the biggest Basque nationalist party in Navarre.
* Spanish Socialist Worker Party (PSOE), the main social-democratic party of Spanish politics, with its regional branches:
** PSE-EE (mixed Spanish and Basque acronym for: &quot;Socialist Party of the Basque Country – Basque Country&#x27;s Left&quot;) in the Basque Autonomous Community (BAC).
** PSN (&quot;Socialist Party of Navarre&quot;) in Navarre.
* People&#x27;s Party (PP), the main conservative party in Spain, with its branches:
** Partido Popular de Navarra (&quot;People&#x27;s Party of Navarre&quot;) in Navarre
** Partido Popular del País Vasco (&quot;People&#x27;s Party of The Basque Country&quot;) in the BAC
* United Left (IU), a Spain-wide left-wing coalition, the former Spanish Communist Party, federalist and republican, with its branches:
** Ezker Anitza (&quot;Plural Left&quot;) (EzAn-IU) in the BAC
** Izquierda Unida de Navarra-Nafarroako Ezker Batua (&quot;United Left of Navarre&quot;) (IUN-NEB) in Navarre
* Podemos-Ahal Dugu (&quot;We can&quot;), a Spain-wide leftist party. In the BAC it is inside the coalition Elkarrekin Podemos alongside United Left, and in Navarre it is part of the coalition government.

===Parties with presence only in Navarre===

* Navarrese People&#x27;s Union (UPN), a conservative party formerly attached to People&#x27;s Party. It was the ruling party in Navarre from 1996 to 2015, and a firm opponent of Basque nationalism, the idea of a Basque Country including Navarre, and virtually all matters Basque. It emphasizes the Spanish character of Navarre, its distinct institutional make-up, and taxation system.
* Navarra Suma, a right-wing coalition formed by UPN, PP and Citizens. It won the 2019 Navarrese regional election but it was unable to form a government. It disbanded in the elections of 2023.
* Geroa Bai (&quot;Yes to the Future&quot;), a progressive Basque nationalist coalition with ties to the Basque Nationalist Party. It ruled Navarre from 2015 to 2019, and entered the PSN led government in 2019 and 2023.
* Contigo-Zurekin (&quot;With you&quot;), a leftist coalition formed by United Left, Batzarre and Podemos.

===Basque nationalism===
====Political status====
Since the 19th century, Basque nationalism (abertzaleak) has demanded the right of some kind of self-determination, which is supported by 60% of Basques in the Basque Autonomous Community, and independence, which would be supported in this same territory, according to a poll, by approximately 36% of them. This desire for independence is particularly stressed among leftist Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the Basque Parliament in 1990, 2002 and 2006.

According to Article 2 of the Spanish Constitution of 1978, &quot;The Constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation, the common and indivisible homeland of all Spaniards&quot;. Therefore, since this precludes a declaration of independence of Spanish regions, some Basques abstained and some even voted against it in the referendum of 6 December of that year. The constitution was nevertheless approved by a clear majority in the whole of Spain, albeit with some degree of opposition in the Southern Basque Country. The derived autonomous regime for the BAC was approved in later referendum and the autonomy of Navarre (&quot;amejoramiento del fuero&quot;: &quot;improvement of the charter&quot;) was approved by the regional parliament of Navarra.

There are not many sources on the issue for the French Basque country, but the establishment of an autonomic regime in the Northern Basque Country and the officiality of the Basque language are two of the main demands of Basque nationalists.

====Euskadi Ta Askatasuna====
Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA) was an armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization. The group was founded in 1959 and evolved from a group promoting Basque culture to a paramilitary group with the goal of gaining independence for the Basque Country. ETA is the main organisation of the Basque National Liberation Movement and was the most important participant in the Basque conflict. ETA declared temporary ceasefires in 1989, 1996, 1998 and 2006, but these subsequently came to an abrupt end. However, on 5 September 2010, ETA declared a permanent ceasefire, and on 20 October 2011 ETA announced a &quot;definitive cessation of its armed activity&quot;. On 2 May 2018, ETA issued a historic statement declaring a definitive end to its armed struggle and the organisation was officially dissolved, after six decades of political conflict.

=== Rejection of the Basque Country idea in Navarre ===

A Basque Country including Navarre has proved controversial. The Spanish Constitution of 1978 included the &quot;Disposición transitoria cuarta&quot; () which allowed Navarre to be eventually absorbed in the Basque Country at their request. This was added after the rejection of the majority of the political parties of Navarre to be incorporated in a joined Basque Country Autonomous Community. The coat of arms of the Basque Autonomous Community included the coat of arms of Navarre (along the coats of arms of Álava, Biscay and Gipuzkoa) when the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country of 1979 was approved. Following a legal suit by the Navarre government claiming that the usage of the arms of a region on the flag of another was illegal, the Constitutional Court of Spain forced the Basque government to remove the chains of Navarre, leaving the red background where the chains were.

Among other controversies in 2018 the Supreme Court of Navarre () ruling against the use of some school books that had in their content a map that displayed the Chartered Community of Navarre within the Basque Country area, claiming it distorted the natural, historic, legal, social, geographic and political reality of Navarre. The same court has also ruled against considering the knowledge of the Basque language when hiring in the public administration, and the establishment of Basque-medium schools has usually been opposed by Navarrese and municipal governments. The Navarrese government and courts have also taken measures to remove Basque symbols from public buildings. As an example, the Administrative Court of Navarre () recently ordered the removal of the Basque coat of arms from a fronton, placed by the municipal government.

==Culture==

===Sports===
The Basque Country has also contributed many sportsmen, primarily in football, rugby union, cycling, jai-alai and surfing.

The main sport in the Basque Country, as in the rest of Spain and much of France, is football. The top teams – Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad, Osasuna, Eibar, Alavés, Real Unión and Barakaldo – play in the Spanish football league system. Athletic Bilbao has a policy of hiring only Basque players, which has been applied with variable flexibility. Local rivals Real Sociedad used to practice the same policy, until they signed Irish striker John Aldridge in the late 1980s. Since then, Real Sociedad have had many foreign players. Athletic&#x27;s policy does not apply to head coaches, with famous names as Howard Kendall and Jupp Heynckes coaching the team at various points.

The most renowned Basque footballer of all time is possibly Andoni Zubizarreta, who holds the record for appearances in La Liga with 622 games and won six league titles and one European Cup. Nowadays, the most well-known Basque football player is Xabi Alonso (winner of two European Championships and one FIFA World Cup) who played for Real Sociedad, Liverpool, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. Other notable Basque players include Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, Mikel Arteta, Javi Martínez, Iker Muniain, César Azpilicueta, Asier Illarramendi, Andoni Iraola, Aritz Aduriz and Ander Herrera. Both Athletic and Real Sociedad have won the Spanish league, including dominating the competition in the early 1980s, with the last title won by a Basque club being Athletic&#x27;s 1984 title.

At international level, Basque players were especially prominent in Spanish selections prior to the Civil War, with all of those at the 1928 Olympics, and the majority of the 1920 Olympics and 1934 World Cup squads, born in the region.

Football is slightly less popular in Northern Basque country but the region has produced two well known and successful French players, Bixente Lizarazu and Didier Deschamps, who were among 22 players that won the 1998 World Cup. In the 2010s, Aviron Bayonnais FC developed international players Stéphane Ruffier and Kévin Rodrigues (capped by Portugal) and Aymeric Laporte who eventually played for Spain based on his residency in the southern Basque country. The club has also played in the French third tier.

The territory has an unofficial &#x27;national&#x27; team which plays occasional friendlies, but not competitive matches, against conventional national teams. Navarre has its own representative side which convenes rarely.

Cycling as a sport is popular in the Basque Country. Miguel Indurain, born in Atarrabia (Navarre), won the Tour de France five times. Fellow Basque cyclist Abraham Olano has won the Vuelta a España and the World Championship.

, a top level cycling team, hails from Navarre, and is a continuation from the &quot;Banesto&quot; team for which Indurain ran. was a team operating at the same level until 2013 which was commercially sponsored, but also worked as an unofficial Basque national team and was partly funded by the Basque Government. Its riders were Basque, or at least grew up in the region&#x27;s cycling culture; members of the team were sometimes strong contenders in the Tour de France or Vuelta a España. The races often saw Basque fans lining the roads during Pyrenean stages of the Tour de France. Team leaders included riders such as Iban Mayo, Haimar Zubeldia, Samuel Sánchez and David Etxebarria. Another team of the same name was raised to ProTeam level in 2019.

In the north, rugby union is another popular sport with the Basque community. In Biarritz, the local club is Biarritz Olympique Pays Basque, the name referencing the club&#x27;s Basque heritage. They wear red, white and green, and supporters wave the Basque flag in the stands. A number of &#x27;home&#x27; matches played by Biarritz Olympique in the Heineken Cup have taken place at Estadio Anoeta in San Sebastian. The most famous Basque Biarritz player was the legendary French fullback Serge Blanco, whose mother was Basque, and Michel Celaya captained both Biarritz and France. Aviron Bayonnais is another top-flight rugby union club with Basque ties.

A Basque club was the last to win the cup before the banning of rugby league, along with other professional sports, by the German collaborating Vichy regime after the defeat of France in 1940.

Pelota (jai alai) is the Basque version of the European game family that includes real tennis and squash. Basque players, playing for either the Spanish or the French teams, dominate international competitions.

Mountaineering is popular due to the mountainous terrain of the Basque Country and its proximity to the Pyrenees. Edurne Pasaban became the first woman to climb the fourteen mountains of greater than 8000 metre altitude; Alberto Iñurrategi and Juanito Oiarzabal have done so without supplementary oxygen. Josune Bereziartu and Patxi Usobiaga, a former world champion, are among top Basques in rock climbing. Related to mountaineering is trail running, where the Basque Country plays host to the popular Zegama-Aizkorri skyrunning races, held annually since 2002.

One of the top basketball clubs in Europe, Saski Baskonia, is based in Vitoria-Gasteiz. Bilbao Basket and Gipuzkoa BC also play in Liga ACB, Spain&#x27;s top league.

In recent years surfing has taken off on the Basque shores, and Mundaka and Biarritz have become spots on the world surf circuit.

===Traditional Basque sports===
The Basque country sporting tradition is linked to agricultural pursuits such as mowing with a scythe, or loading carts, but adapted as competitions with points awarded for specific criteria such as time, precision, elegance and productivity. Rural Basque sports include Aizkolaritza (wood chopping), Harri-jasotzaileak (stone lifting), Idi probak (leading oxen to drag rocks) and Sokatira (tug-of-war).

<text>National Security Space Launch (NSSL) is a program of the United States Space Force (USSF) intended to assure access to space for United States Department of Defense and other United States government payloads. The program is managed by the Assured Access to Space Directorate (SSC/AA) of the Space Force&#x27;s Space Systems Command (SSC), in partnership with the National Reconnaissance Office.

Started in 1994 as the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle launch system program, the initial program goal was to make government space launches more affordable and reliable, leading to the development of the Boeing Delta IV and Lockheed Martin Atlas V EELV families. These remained the primary launch vehicles for U.S. military satellites, and were later joined by the Falcon 9 developed by SpaceX.

On 1 March 2019, the program name was changed from EELV to National Security Space Launch (NSSL) to better reflect the growing commercial launch market and the changing nature of launch contracts, including the potential for reusable launch vehicles.

The NSSL program launches the nation&#x27;s most valuable military satellites; contracts to launch lower value payloads, such as those of the Space Test Program, are awarded using different methodologies.

== History ==
=== Initial program goals ===
The USAF began the EELV program in 1994, following many years of government-funded studies into improved systems and architecture. The intent was to replace legacy vehicles, including Delta II, Atlas II, and Titan IV. EELVs were to reduce costs by being based on standardized fairings, liquid core vehicles, upper stages, and solid rocket boosters. A Standard Payload Interface bus was also proposed as a way to save money and improve efficiency.

Reducing the cost of launches and ensuring national access to space were the two main goals of the USAF space launch/EELV program. Some of the reasons why assured access to space is a priority for the United States are stated in National Presidential Directive Number 40, which reads:
Access to space through U.S. space transportation capabilities is essential to:
# place critical United States Government assets and capabilities into space;
# augment space-based capabilities in a timely manner in the event of increased operational needs or minimize disruptions due to on-orbit satellite failures, launch failures, or deliberate actions against U.S. space assets;
# support government and commercial human space flight.
The United States, therefore, must maintain robust, responsive, and resilient U.S. space transportation capabilities to assure access to space.

Procurement of EELV boosters for military space launch was to evolve to more closely match commercial practice. The initial bids came from four major defense contractors: Lockheed Martin, Boeing, McDonnell Douglas, and Alliant Techsystems. Each of the bids included a variety of concepts. Boeing initially proposed using the RS-25 Space Shuttle main engine.

=== 1990s-2000s ===
In October 1998 two initial launch services contracts (known as Buy 1) were awarded. Along with the award of two development agreements, the total amount was more than $3 billion. Boeing was awarded a contract for 19 out of the 28 launches; Lockheed Martin was awarded a contract for the other 9. Boeing received $1.38 billion, and Lockheed Martin received $650 million for the launches. Boeing and Lockheed Martin were each awarded US$500 million for the final phase of the bid. Boeing developed the Delta IV based around Common Booster Cores and the Delta Cryogenic Second Stage, while Lockheed Martin developed the Atlas V based around Common Core Boosters and the Centaur upper stage.

In 2003, Boeing was found to be in possession of proprietary documents from Lockheed Martin. The USAF moved 7 launches from Delta IV to Atlas V. To end litigation and competition for a limited market, both companies agreed to form the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture. Each company has a 50% stake in ULA.

=== 2010s ===
Prior to 2012, the USAF was advancing another program, the Reusable Booster System and other follow-on technologies, and up to early 2012 issued contract awards for various aspects of it, before the program was cancelled in October 2012.

In December 2012, the DoD announced a re-opening of the EELV-class launch vehicle market to competition while authorizing the USAF to proceed with a block buy of &quot;up to&quot; 36 boosters from ULA. At the same time, another 14 boosters were to be procured competitively beginning in 2015, with the initial launches to be performed in 2017.

The USAF signed a contract at that time with SpaceX for two launches in 2014 and 2015 to serve as proving flights to support the certification process for the Falcon 9 v1.1 and Falcon Heavy. In April 2014, after the launches were contracted, SpaceX sued the United States Air Force, arguing that the RD-180 engines, produced in Russia by the government owned NPO Energomash and used by the Atlas V, violated sanctions against the Russian government. The USAF and SpaceX settled the lawsuit in Jan 2015 by opening up more launches to competitive bidding. The USAF certified the Falcon 9 in May 2015, and in 2016 SpaceX won a contract under the EELV program to launch a GPS Block III satellite payload to MEO.

=== 2018 to 2020s ===
The USAF began the process of competitively selecting the next generation NSSL vehicles in 2018. Announced performance requirements include:

Category A payloads fit within a 4 m diameter payload envelope, category B payloads fit within a 5 m diameter payload envelope, and category C payloads require an extended 5 m diameter envelope.

The USAF and United States Space Force (USSF) plan to use the next generation NSSL launch vehicles until at least 2030.

See EELV_Secondary_Payload_Adapter (ESPA rings with radial ports)

== Launch vehicles ==
Since 2019 there have been four vehicles certified by the Department of Defense to conduct NSSL launches: Atlas V, Delta IV Heavy, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. Delta IV Medium was retired in August 2019 and Delta IV Heavy retired in April 2024. After a two-year solicitation and competition process in 2018–2020, in August 2020 the USSF selected SpaceX (F9 and FH) and ULA&#x27;s yet-to-be-certified Vulcan Centaur to supply US military launch requirements in 2022–2027. New Glenn was considered for the first time in NSSL Phase 3 Lane 1 bidding.

=== Retired ===
==== Delta IV medium ====
Delta IV Medium flew with two or four SRBs on a single Common Booster Core. The DCSS had 4 m diameter and 5 m diameter versions, with matching diameter payload fairings. Delta IV CBCs and DCSSs were integrated horizontally before being transported to the launchpad. The Delta IV Medium retired after the 22 August 2019 launch of a GPS-III satellite. The mission used a Delta IV M+(4,2) two SRBs, and a 4 m diameter DCSS and payload fairing, the final use of the 4 m fairing.

==== Delta IV Heavy ====

The Delta IV Heavy launch vehicle used three Common Booster Cores (CBCs) each powered by a Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne RS-68A engine, a Delta Cryogenic Second Stage 5 m (DCSS) powered by an RL10, and a 5 m payload fairing. Delta IV CBCs and DCSSs were integrated horizontally before being transported to the launchpad. In 2020, ULA announced retirement of the Delta IV after 5 more launches. The final flight occurred in April 2024.

==== Atlas V ====
Each Atlas V launch vehicle is based on a Common Core Booster powered by one NPO Energomash RD-180 engine with two combustion chambers and a Centaur upper stage powered by one or two Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne RL10A-4-2 engines. Up to five Aerojet Rocketdyne Graphite-Epoxy Motor solid rocket boosters can be added to increase vehicle performance, and two diameters of payload fairing are available.

A three-digit naming convention is used for the Atlas V configuration identification. The first digit represents the payload fairing diameter, either 4.2 meters (indicated by a 4) or 5.4 (indicated by a 5) meters. The second digit is for the number of solid rocket boosters (0 to 5) to be used, and the third digit the number of RL-10 engines on the Centaur upper stage (1 or 2). As an example, an Atlas V 551 has a 5.4-meter payload fairing, 5 SRBs, and 1 RL-10.

In August 2021, ULA announced that Atlas V would be retired, and all 29 remaining launches had been sold. The last launch for NSSL happened on 30 July 2024. , fifteen launches remain, all for non-DoD launches.

=== Certified and active ===
==== Falcon 9 ====
The main features of the Falcon 9 in its Block 5 version include two stages, both powered by LOX and RP-1, with nine Merlin 1D engines on the first stage and one Merlin 1D Vacuum engine on the second stage. This launcher features a reusable first stage and fairings, which lowers the cost per mission.

GPS-IIIA USA-289 was the first NSSL-type B5 Falcon 9 launch. The launch occurred on December 23, 2018.

==== Falcon Heavy ====

The Falcon Heavy is a super heavy-lift rocket developed and produced by SpaceX. It has been certified for the NSSL program after the STP-2 launch completed on 25 June 2019, as confirmed by the commander of the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Lt. Gen. Thompson. He clarified: &quot;I certified them to compete last year&quot; and &quot;one of the requirements behind certification is to fly three missions.&quot; This requirement has been satisfied by the Falcon Heavy test flight in February 2018, Arabsat-6A in April 2019, and the STP-2 launch in June 2019. Falcon Heavy has been certified for two Phase 1A reference orbits and as of 2019, &quot;it&#x27;s not certified for all of our most stressing national security space orbits,&quot; Thompson said. The USAF is working with SpaceX to mature their Falcon Heavy&#x27;s design.

As of December 2023, it has flown three classified national security flights: USSF-44, USSF-67, and USSF-52.

=== Next generation vehicle competition ===
In 2018, a competitive contract award to launch national security spacecraft was conducted between United Launch Alliance (ULA), Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems (NGIS), Blue Origin, and SpaceX.

==== Phase 1: development of detailed designs ====

Two providers were to be selected to launch spacecraft to a number of reference orbits. In October 2018, the USAF awarded development funding to ULA, NGIS, and Blue Origin to further the design of their rockets before a subsequent competition for award to build the launch vehicles. SpaceX received none of this funding to develop their designs, as both the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy had completed development and were already flying.

;New Glenn 
Blue Origin was awarded $500 million of phase 1 funding for further development of New Glenn as a potential competitor in future contracts. As of 2019, Blue Origin expected a first launch of New Glenn in 2021. In the event, no phase 2 funding from the US government was forthcoming after August 2020 when ULA Vulcan and SpaceX were selected by the Air Force. Blue Origin is considered likely to continue building and testing New Glenn, in part since they were already privately funding development prior to the Air Force NSSL competition.

;OmegA
Northrop Grumman was awarded of phase 1 funding in 2018 for development of OmegA. OmegA was a rocket design with two main solid stages, a cryogenic upper stage, and the possibility of additional solid-rocket strap-on boosters. As of 2019, the first flight has been stated by NGIS to be expected in 2021. In the event, no phase 2 funding from the US government was forthcoming after August 2020 when ULA Vulcan and SpaceX were selected by the Air Force. In 2020, Northrop Grumman announced the cancellation of OmegA.

;Vulcan Centaur
ULA was awarded $967 million of phase 1 funding for further development of Vulcan Centaur as a potential competitor in future contracts. On 12 August 2019, ULA submitted Vulcan Centaur for phase 2 of the USAF&#x27;s launch services competition. As of July 2024, Vulcan Centaur has completed one certification flight launch and another is left be fully certified for national security launches.

==== Phase 2: selection of two launch vendors ====

On 12 August 2019, at least three of the four companies submitted their final bids for the launch services competition. SpaceX bid the existing Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, while Blue Origin was expected to bid New Glenn, ULA bid Vulcan Centaur, and NGIS&#x27;s bid status was not reported. Blue Origin also filed a pre-award protest of the request for proposal arguing that the requirements were ambiguous.

The US Department of the Air Force announced the results of the approximately National Security Space Launch Phase 2 Launch Service Procurement on 7 August 2020. SpaceX and ULA were the two vendors selected via the competition to supply launches to the US military in the 2022–2026 timeframe.
The US Space Force (USSF) plans 30–34 launches during these five fiscal years. ULA is expected to handle 60 percent of the launches while SpaceX will handle 40 percent of the launches over the five-year period.

The contract type for the phase 2 contracts is new for NSSL launches as it will be a &quot;firm-fixed-price, indefinite-delivery&quot; type of launch contract. The awards in August 2020 are a major part of &quot;the transition of the national security launch program to take advantage of commercial innovation and private investments in launch vehicles.&quot;

==NSSL Phase 3== 
In 2023, USSF released a draft RFP for &quot;Phase 3&quot; of NSSL, which covers the five fiscal years 2025-2029. Unlike the earlier NSSL contracts, Phase 3 is divided into two &quot;lanes&quot;. Lane 1 covers less demanding missions and is structured to encourage new launch providers. Lane 2 is more similar to Phase 2 and requires each provider to be able to handle all NSSL requirements. However, Lane 2 allows for up to three providers instead of just the two providers of Phase 2. Proposals were due December 15, 2023 and awards are expected in mid to late 2024.

Phase 3 Lane 1 awardees were SpaceX, Blue Origin and ULA. The vehicles being: Falcon 9, New Glenn and Vulcan Centaur, respectively.

<doc id="683049" wikidata="Q55607810" url="?curid=683049" title="Club soda">
<text>Club soda is a form of carbonated water manufactured in North America, commonly used as a drink mixer. Sodium bicarbonate, potassium sulfate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium citrate, or sodium citrate is added to artificially replicate constituents commonly found in natural mineral waters and offset the acidity of introducing carbon dioxide gas (which creates low 3–4 pH carbonic acid when dissolved in water).

Naturally effervescent &quot;Selters&quot; water from Germany gave rise to the generic use of the term for carbonated water, particularly from a soda siphon, in the United States as seltzer water. Seltzer water is artificially carbonated but lacks added minerals.

==History==
English chemist Joseph Priestley discovered an artificial method for producing carbonated water, described in a pamphlet called &quot;Directions for Impregnating Water with Fixed Air,&quot; published in 1772. The pamphlet explained the process of dripping sulfuric acid onto chalk, which produced carbon dioxide (CO2) that was captured in a bowl of agitated water. Priestley thought such carbonated water was a cure for scurvy and proposed the process to Captain James Cook to prevent scurvy during his second voyage to the South Seas. Priestley never realized the commercial potential of his product, though he did refer to it as his &quot;happiest discovery.&quot;

In 1783, Johann Jacob Schweppe, a jeweler and amateur scientist of Geneva, began the commercial production of carbonated mineral water by dissolving the CO2 under pressure. In 1807, Benjamin Silliman, a Yale chemistry professor, began producing carbonated water under pressure and selling it in New Haven, Connecticut. In the 1830s, Anyos Jedlik of Hungary opened a large-scale carbonated water factory. The original trademarked club soda was made by Cantrell &amp; Cochrane of Dublin, Ireland in 1877. The &#x27;club&#x27; refers to the Kildare Street Club in Dublin, which commissioned them to produce it.

==As stain remover==
The dissolved gas in carbonated water acts as a temporary surfactant, causing it to be recommended as a household remedy for removing stains, particularly those of red wine.

<doc id="683057" wikidata="Q193295" url="?curid=683057" title="Hradec Králové Region">
<text>Hradec Králové Region (, ) is an administrative unit () of the Czech Republic located in the north-eastern part of the historical region of Bohemia. It is named after its capital Hradec Králové. The region neighbours the Pardubice Region in the south, the Central Bohemian Region in the south-west, and the Liberec Region in the west. It also shares a 208 km long international border with Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship in the north and the east.

==Administrative divisions==
After the state administration reform took place (1 January 2000); the Hradec Králové Region is divided into 5 districts:
As for area, Trutnov District is the largest taking almost one fourth of the entire region&#x27;s territory, followed by the Rychnov nad Kněžnou District with 21% and as for the three remaining districts each has about 18%. As of 2003, 15 municipalities with extended powers and 35 municipalities with a delegated municipal office were established in the region.

==Population==
As of January 2019, the Hradec Králové Region had 551,021 inhabitants, which was 5.2% of the total population of the Czech Republic. With its 116 inhabitants per square kilometer, the region has a lower density than the national average (135 inhabitants per km2). The region has in total 448 independent municipalities, whereof 48 enjoy the status of town. The share of urban population is ca. 67%. 
The region&#x27;s centre is Hradec Králové (92,742 inhabitants). About 12.5% inhabitants in the region live in a municipality of 500 inhabitants or less. 
Out of all Czech regions, the Hradec Králové Region has the lowest share of inhabitants aged 15–64 (67%) and the highest share of population aged 65+ (18%). Average age of both men and women is also above the national average.

The table below shows the municipalities in Hradec Králové Region with the largest population (as of 1 January 2024):


==Geography==

The Hradec Králové Region has the area of 4 759 km2 and accounts for 6% of the total area of the Czech Republic. In terms of size it is the ninth largest region of the Czech Republic. Krkonoše and Orlické mountains which are situated in the northern and northeastern part of the region pass to fertile Elbe lowland. Two thirds of the area of the Krkonoše National Park lie within the region&#x27;s territory. Krkonoše and Orlické mountains are separated by Broumovský výběžek with its large rock towns – Adršpach-Teplice Rocks, Broumov Hills, Křížový vrch and Ostaš.
Main watercourses are Elbe (Czech: Labe) and its tributaries Orlice and Metuje. Almost the entire territory of the region falls into the Elbe&#x27;s basin and only a marginal part of the Broumovský výběžek area falls under the basin of the River Oder (Czech: Odra).
Sněžka mountain is with its elevation of 1603 m above sea level the highest point of the region, Krkonoše mountains and also of the Czech Republic. The lowest point of the region is the surface of the River Cidlina (202 m above sea level).

==Economy==
In terms of economic activities, the region can be described as agricultural-industrial with well-developed tourism. The region is part of the so-called Black Triangle, an area of heavily industrialization and environmental damage on the three-way border of Poland, Germany, and the Czech Republic. The industry is concentrated in big towns while the agriculture in the Elbe lowland (Czech: Polabí). The tourism is concentrated in Krkonoše.
In 2012, the gross domestic product of Hradec Králové Region accounted for about 4.5% of the total GDP of the Czech Republic. Region&#x27;s GDP per capita amounted to 85.7% of national average and ranked as the fourth highest. As of September 2014, the unemployment rate in the region was 5.9%. The average gross salary was 22,842 CZK.

According to Labour Force Survey, there were in total about 253,200 employees in the region in 2012. Hereof, the largest proportion (31.1%) worked in manufacturing, followed by trade and repair of personal and household goods (12.2%), health and social care (7.9%), construction (7.3%), public administration and defence (6.5%), transportation and storage (5.9%), etc.

Manufacturing prevails over the other industries and focuses on motor vehicles, electrical equipment and textiles. However, Hradec Králové Region does not rank among key industrial areas – its 2012 share in sales of industrial enterprises accounted for 3.8% of the national&#x27;s total. With regard to agriculture, crop production focuses on cereals (wheat and barley), rape and maize, with industrial sugar beet production playing an important role too. Animal production focuses on raising cattle and pigs. About 4.1% of region&#x27;s workforce worked in agriculture, forestry and fishing in 2012. As of 2012, agricultural land covered 58% of the total region&#x27;s territory and the share of arable land was 40%, while forests covered 31% of the territory.

In 2012, the 954 statistically monitored collective accommodation establishments in the region reported 887,000 guests, including about 213,000 foreigners coming especially from Germany, Poland and the Netherlands. The average length of stays per guest was 4.5 days. 
During the last few years, many forms of cross-border co-operation have been developed. One of them is the Glacensis Euroregion that had been established in 1995 as one of the Euroregions covering the Czech-Polish border areas.

<text>Trisodium citrate is a chemical compound with the molecular formula Na3C6H5O7. It is sometimes referred to simply as &quot;sodium citrate&quot;, though sodium citrate can refer to any of the three sodium salts of citric acid. It possesses a saline, mildly tart taste, and is a mild alkali.

==Uses==

===Foods===
Sodium citrate is chiefly used as a food additive, usually for flavor or as a preservative. Its E number is E331. Sodium citrate is employed as a flavoring agent in certain varieties of club soda. It is common as an ingredient in bratwurst, and is also used in commercial ready-to-drink beverages and drink mixes, contributing a tart flavor. It is found in gelatin mix, ice cream, yogurt, jams, sweets, milk powder, processed cheeses, carbonated beverages, wine, and butter chicken, amongst others. Because the elements in Na3C6H5O7 spell &quot;Na C H O&quot;, &quot;Nacho Cheese&quot; is a convenient mnemonic for trisodium citrate&#x27;s chemical formula. 

Sodium citrate can be used as an emulsifying stabilizer when making cheese. It allows the cheese to melt without becoming greasy by stopping the fats from separating.
====Buffering====
As a conjugate base of a weak acid, citrate can perform as a buffering agent or acidity regulator, resisting changes in pH. It is used to control acidity in some substances, such as gelatin desserts. It can be found in the milk minicontainers used with coffee machines. The compound is the product of antacids, such as Alka-Seltzer, when they are dissolved in water. The pH range of a solution of 5 g/100 ml water at 25 °C is 7.5 to 9.0. It is added to many commercially packaged dairy products to control the pH impact of the gastrointestinal system of humans, mainly in processed products such as cheese and yogurt, although it also has beneficial effects on the physical gel microstructure.

===Chemistry===
Sodium citrate is a component in Benedict&#x27;s qualitative solution, often used in organic analysis to detect the presence of reducing sugars such as glucose.

===Medicine===
In 1914, the Belgian doctor Albert Hustin and the Argentine physician and researcher Luis Agote successfully used sodium citrate as an anticoagulant in blood transfusions, with Richard Lewisohn determining its correct concentration in 1915. It continues to be used in blood-collection tubes and for the preservation of blood in blood banks. The citrate ion chelates calcium ions in the blood by forming calcium citrate complexes, disrupting the blood clotting mechanism. Recently, trisodium citrate has also been used as a locking agent in vascath and haemodialysis lines instead of heparin due to its lower risk of systemic anticoagulation.

In 2003, Ööpik et al. showed the use of sodium citrate (0.5 g/kg body weight) improved running performance over 5 km by 30 seconds.

Sodium citrate is used to relieve discomfort in urinary-tract infections, such as cystitis, to reduce the acidosis seen in distal renal tubular acidosis, and can also be used as an osmotic laxative. It is a major component of the WHO oral rehydration solution.

It is used as an antacid, especially prior to anaesthesia, for caesarian section procedures to reduce the risks associated with the aspiration of gastric contents.

===Boiler descaling===
Sodium citrate is a particularly effective agent for removal of carbonate scale from boilers without removing them from operation and for cleaning automobile radiators.

<doc id="683071" wikidata="Q420280" url="?curid=683071" title="Calcium citrate">
<text>Calcium citrate is the calcium salt of citric acid. It is commonly used as a food additive (E333), usually as a preservative, but sometimes for flavor. In this sense, it is similar to sodium citrate. Calcium citrate is also found in some dietary calcium supplements (e.g. Citracal or Caltrate). Calcium makes up 24.1% of calcium citrate (anhydrous) and 21.1% of calcium citrate (tetrahydrate) by mass. The tetrahydrate occurs in nature as the mineral Earlandite.

==Chemical properties==
Calcium citrate is sparingly soluble in water. Needle-shaped crystals of tricalcium dicitrate tetrahydrate [Ca3(C6H5O7)2(H2O)2]·2H2O were obtained by hydrothermal synthesis. The crystal structure comprises a three-dimensional network in which eightfold coordinated Ca2+ cations are linked by citrate anions and hydrogen bonds between two non-coordinating crystal water molecules and two coordinating water molecules.

==Production==
Calcium citrate is an intermediate in the isolation of citric acid from the fungal fermentation process by which citric acid is produced industrially. The citric acid in the broth solution is neutralized by limewater, precipitating insoluble calcium citrate. This is then filtered off from the rest of the broth and washed to give clean calcium citrate.
: 3 Ca(OH)2(s) + 2 C6H8O7(l) → Ca3(C6H5O7)2(s) + 6 H2O(l)

The calcium citrate thus produced may be sold as-is, or it may be converted to citric acid using dilute sulfuric acid.

== Medical uses ==
It&#x27;s primarily sold as a food supplement of calcium.

=== Bioavailability ===
In many individuals, bioavailability of calcium citrate is found to be equal to that of the cheaper calcium carbonate (CaCO3). However, alterations to the digestive tract may change how calcium is digested and absorbed. Unlike calcium carbonate, which is basic and neutralizes stomach acid, calcium citrate has no effect on stomach acid. Calcium carbonate is harder to digest than calcium citrate, and calcium carbonate carries a risk of &quot;acid rebound&quot; (the stomach overcompensates by producing more acid), so individuals who are sensitive to antacids or who have difficulty producing adequate stomach acid may choose calcium citrate over calcium carbonate for supplementation.

According to a 2009 research into calcium absorption after gastric bypass surgery, calcium citrate may have improved bioavailability over calcium carbonate in Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients who are taking calcium citrate as a dietary supplement after surgery. This is mainly due to the changes related to where calcium absorption occurs in the digestive tract of these individuals.

<text>Lazy Bones was originally a comic strip in the British comic &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot;. It made its first appearance in 1978.

The strip was about a boy called Benny Bones, who would constantly fall asleep everywhere, much to the annoyance of his parents. Until 1986, the strip was drawn by Colin Whittock, and moved to &quot;Buster&quot; in 1990 after &quot;Whizzer and Chips&quot; ended. Here it stayed, surviving on reprints, until the final issue. Artist Jack Edward Oliver included Benny in the last page of that issue, revealing how all the characters in the comic came to an end. It featured Benny explaining to a doctor that he&#x27;s suffering from insomnia.

== Colin Whittock ==
Colin Whittock, the original artist of &quot;Lazy Bones&quot;, is the head cartoon illustrator for http://www.aquarterof.co.uk, an online sweetshop inspired by Whizzer and Chips.

<doc id="683076" wikidata="Q3084040" url="?curid=683076" title="Socialism with a human face">
<text>Socialism with a human face (, ) was a slogan referring to the reformist and democratic socialist programme of Alexander Dubček and his colleagues, agreed at the Presidium of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April 1968, after he became chairman of the KSČ in January 1968.

The first author of this slogan was Radovan Richta, and it was a process of moderate democratization, economic modernization, and political liberalization that sought to build an advanced and modern socialist society that valued democratic Czechoslovak tradition while still allowing the Communist Party to continue governing.

Socialism with a human face was vital in initiating the Prague Spring, a period of national democratization and economic decentralization. It was, however, rolled back by the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on August 21, 1968.

== Background ==
The programme was an attempt to overcome the disillusionment of the people of Czechoslovakia with the political and economic situation at the time. As the name suggests, the plan was to breathe new life into the ideals of socialism, which had lost popular support due to the government policies of the previous two decades. While it never intended to bring back market capitalism, Alexander Dubček proposed trade with both Western and Soviet powers and a ten-year transition to a multiparty democratized Socialism.

== Dubček Speech ==
At the 20th anniversary of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s &quot;Victorious February&quot;, Dubček delivered a speech explaining the need for change following the triumph of socialism. He emphasized the need to &quot;enforce the leading role of the party more effectively&quot; and acknowledged that, despite Klement Gottwald&#x27;s urgings for better relations with society, the Party had too often made heavy-handed rulings on trivial issues. Dubček declared the party&#x27;s mission was &quot;to build an advanced socialist society on sound economic foundations ... a socialism that corresponds to the historical democratic traditions of Czechoslovakia, in accordance with the experience of other communist parties ...&quot;

One of the most important steps towards the reform was the reduction and later abolition of the censorship on 4 March 1968. It was for the first time in Czechoslovak history the censorship was abolished and it was also probably the only reform fully implemented, although only for a short period. Changing from an instrument of party propaganda, media quickly became the instrument of criticism of the government.

== Action Programme ==
In April, Dubček launched an &quot;Action Programme&quot; of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on consumer goods and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that &quot;Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy.&quot; It would limit the power of the secret police and provide for the federalization of the ČSSR into two equal nations. The programme also covered foreign policy, including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations. It spoke of a ten-year transition through which democratic elections would be made possible and a new form of social democracy and democratic socialism would replace the status quo.

Those who drafted the Action Programme were careful not to criticize the actions of the post-war Communist administration, only to point out policies that they felt had outlived their usefulness. For instance, the immediate post-war situation had required &quot;centralist and directive-administrative methods&quot; to fight against the &quot;remnants of the bourgeoisie.&quot; Since the &quot;antagonistic classes&quot; were said to have been defeated with the achievement of socialism, these methods were no longer necessary. Reform was needed for the Czechoslovak economy to join the &quot;scientific-technical revolution in the world&quot;, rather than relying on Stalinist-era heavy industry, labour power, and raw materials. Furthermore, since internal class conflict had been overcome, workers could now be duly rewarded for their qualifications and technical skills without contravening Marxism-Leninism. The Programme suggested it was now necessary to ensure important positions were &quot;filled by capable, educated socialist expert cadres&quot; in order to compete with capitalism.

== The programme of &quot;socialism with a human face&quot; ==
Although it was stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction, popular pressure mounted to implement reforms immediately. Radical elements became more vocal: anti-Soviet polemics appeared in the press on 26 June 1968, the Social Democrats began to form a separate party, and new unaffiliated political clubs were created. Party conservatives urged repressive measures, but Dubček counselled moderation and re-emphasized KSČ leadership. At the Presidium of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April, Dubček announced a political programme of &quot;socialism with a human face&quot;. In May, he announced that the Fourteenth Party Congress would convene in an early session on 9 September. The congress would incorporate the Action Programme into the party statutes, draft a federalization law, and elect a new Central Committee.

Dubček&#x27;s reforms guaranteed freedom of the press, and political commentary was allowed for the first time in mainstream media. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček&#x27;s reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Within the party, there were varying opinions on how this should proceed; certain economists wished for a more mixed economy while others wanted the economy to remain mostly planned. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.

On 27 June Ludvík Vaculík, a leading author and journalist, published a manifesto titled &quot;The Two Thousand Words&quot;. It expressed concern about conservative elements within the KSČ and so-called &quot;foreign&quot; forces. Vaculík called on the people to take the initiative in implementing the reform programme. Dubček, the party Presidium, the National Front, and the cabinet denounced this manifesto.

==Publications and media==
Dubček&#x27;s relaxation of censorship ushered in a brief period of freedom of speech and the press. The first tangible manifestation of this new policy of openness was the production of the previously hard-line communist weekly &quot;Literární noviny&quot;, renamed &quot;Literární listy&quot;.

Freedom of the press also opened the door for the first honest look at Czechoslovakia&#x27;s past by Czechoslovakia&#x27;s people. Many of the investigations centered on the country&#x27;s history under communism, especially in the instance of the Joseph Stalin-period. In another television appearance, Goldstücker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history. The Writers&#x27; Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet Jaroslav Seifert, to investigate the persecution of writers after the Communist takeover in February 1948 and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, bookstores and libraries, and the literary world. Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily &quot;Prace&quot; (Labour). This was also helped by the Journalists&#x27; Union, which by March 1968 had already persuaded the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions to foreign papers, allowing for a more international dialogue around the news.

The press, the radio, and the television also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstücker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Prochazka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdenek Hejzlar, and Gustáv Husák. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new freedom of the press and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.

During Gorbachev&#x27;s visit to Prague in 1987, his spokesman Gennady Gerasimov was asked what was the difference between the Prague Spring and perestroika, and he replied: &quot;Nineteen years.&quot;

<text>The Palos Verdes Peninsula () is a peninsular subregion of the Los Angeles metropolitan area, located within southwestern Los Angeles County, California. It is often called simply &quot;Palos Verdes&quot;, and is made up of a group of cities in the Palos Verdes Hills, including Palos Verdes Estates, Rancho Palos Verdes, Rolling Hills, Rolling Hills Estates, and the unincorporated community of Westfield/Academy Hill, as well as the Los Angeles City neighborhood of San Pedro.

The peninsula is located in the South Bay region. It borders the city of Torrance to its north, the Pacific Ocean is on the west and south, and the Port of Los Angeles is to the east. As of the 2010 census, the population of the Palos Verdes Peninsula is 65,008. The hill cities on the peninsula are known for scenic views of the Pacific Ocean and cityscapes, distinguished schools, extensive horse trails, and high-value homes.

==History==
===Native Americans===
The peninsula was the homeland of the Tongva-Gabrieliño Native Americans people for thousands of years. In other areas of the Los Angeles Basin archeological sites date back 8,000 years. Their first contact with Europeans occurred in 1542 with João Cabrilho (&quot;Juan Cabrillo&quot;). Chowigna and Suangna were two Tongva settlements of many in the peninsula area, which was also a departure point for their &quot;rancherías&quot; on the Channel Islands.

===Spanish and Mexican era===

In 1846, José Dolores Sepúlveda and José Loreto received a Mexican land grant from Alta California Governor Pío Pico for a parcel from the huge original 1784 Spanish land grant of Rancho San Pedro to Manuel Dominguez. It was named Rancho de los Palos Verdes, or &quot;ranch of the green trees&quot;, which was used primarily as a cattle ranch. It was also briefly used as a whaling station in the mid-19th century.

===American era===
By 1882, ownership of the land had passed from the Sepulveda family through various mortgage holders to Jotham Bixby of Rancho Los Cerritos, who leased the land to Japanese farmers.

Frank Vanderlip, representing a group of wealthy east coast investors, purchased 25 square miles of land on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in 1913 for $1.5 million. In 1914, Vanderlip vacationed at Palos Verdes in order to recover from an illness, and he was astounded by scenery he compared to &quot;the Sorrentine Peninsula and the Amalfi Drive&quot;. He quickly initiated development of Palos Verdes. He hired the Olmsted Brothers, the landscaping firm of John Charles Olmsted and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., to plan and landscape a new subdivision. The Olmsted Brothers contracted Koebig &amp; Koebig to perform engineering work, including surveying and road planning. However, the project stalled as World War I started, and Vanderlip accepted a chairmanship to the War Savings Committee in Washington, D.C. in 1916.

By 1921, Vanderlip had lost interest in overseeing development of Palos Verdes and enticed Edward Gardner Lewis to take over the project with an option to buy the property for $5 million. Lewis was an experienced developer, but lacked the capital to purchase and develop Palos Verdes. Instead, he established a real estate trust, capitalizing the project through the sale of notes which were convertible to Palos Verdes property. Under the terms of the trust, Lewis sought to raise $30 million for infrastructure improvements, effectively borrowing from investors for both the land and the improvements. He succeeded in attracting $15 million in capital, but far short of the $35 million needed. The trust dissolved and ownership of Palos Verdes reverted to Vanderlip.

Vanderlip established a new real estate trust to purchase 3,200 acres from his land syndicate and establish the subdivision of Palos Verdes Estates. The new trust assumed not just the land, but also the improvements made by Lewis. They were not complete, but they were substantial: improvements included many sewers, water mains, and roads; landscaping, parks, and a golf course. They opened Palos Verdes for public inspection in June 1923.

Palos Verdes Estates was organized and landscaped by the Olmsted Brothers and in their planning, they dedicated a quarter of the land area to permanent open undeveloped space.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Palos Verdes has a Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps.

== Reef restoration ==

Reef restoration off the coast of Palos Verdes began in May 2020 involving over of new habitat. Located off the coast, this restoration consists unique designs and locations with of rock relief habitats which provide habitat for marine life. It avoids existing functioning reefs and instead uses those areas as inspiration. These habitats have been impacted by deposited or settling sediment such as sand, leading the artificial reefs to be constructed over reefs buried in shallow sediment (to minimize potential for the artificial reef sinking). The main goals of the restoration project were to restore the rocky-reef territory and maximize ecosystem benefits.

Reefs are productive ecosystems. Two types of monitoring have been done for the restoration site. The first one being geophysical and oceanographic monitoring. The restoration project uses high-resolution multi-beam bathymetry data which is an instrument that uses echo-sound to measure the depth of water at different angles to create 3D maps of the ocean floor. The team used before and after pictures of the site from October 2019, the date prior to alterations, three different dates throughout 2020, and the final date, December 2021. By 2021, the team used Edgetech 6205 MultiPhase EchoSounder, which sends and receives audible pulses that also map the ocean&#x27;s floor. Results showed net gain between 2019 and 2020. There was little net loss and fewer net gain between 2020 and 2021. Between 2019 and 2021, there were was mostly no change.

The second monitoring method was biological monitoring. The team used instruments which detected specific fish species&#x27; density and size. These instruments also showed the kelp canopy and other marine plants. By 2021, the team was able to say there was a significantly higher giant kelp density compared to the previous three years. There was also an increase in biotic cover, total fish density, and total fish biomass by 2021. Although kelp does function as a habitat and food source of marine species, it is not necessary for fish biodiversity. Instead, rock relief is linked to fish biodiversity.

Human caused factors such as pollution and over harvesting have altered urchin-dominated areas. Historically, pollution mitigation has been overlooked in artificial reef restoration programs. A way to mitigate issues is through assisted recovery and/or passive restoration. Experiments that have included pollution mitigation have seen a 100% success rate of achieving cleaner environments within their testing site. Heavy metals have been found in Southern California coasts. Some of these are lead, zinc, and scientists have also found DDT. The highest concentration of DDT in sediments in California have been found off the coast of Palos Verdes. 98% of sediments tested off the coast of Palos Verdes contained DDT which has contaminated 100% of two fish species. These species are the Pacific sanddab and longfin sanddab. High amounts of nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrate have also been detected in the water. These factors have caused fish tissue to decrease between the 1970s and 1980s. Due to the high concentration of DDT, commercial fishing is banned off the coast of Palos Verdes. Another factor where marine restorations fall short is in accounting for multiple important variables. Some examples are nutrients, light, wave exposure, and temporal temperatures.

Another stressor that reefs and other marine ecosystems face are human population increases. Population increased in California&#x27;s coast during the 1900s. It went from 200 thousand people in Southern California in 1900 to over 17 million in 1998. Palos Verdes has been identified as a hot spot for sewage found in sediments. Invertebrates, plankton, and several species have bioaccumulated increasing amounts of chlorinated hydrocarbons as they approach Palos Verdes. When there are high levels of pollution, fish diseases such as tumors and fin erosion levels also increase.

==Economy==
Palos Verdes Peninsula is an upper class area, and the average household income is $231,303 per year.

==Commerce==
Areas of commerce include historic Mediterranean Revival style Malaga Cove Plaza and the Promenade on the Peninsula. Smaller shopping centers include the Peninsula Center, Lunada Bay Plaza, and Golden Cove Plaza.

The largest peninsula commercial district is in Rolling Hills Estates, with many shopping centers including The Promenade on the Peninsula with a megaplex movie theater and an ice rink.

The Palos Verdes area has ocean views, coastline views and city light views.

The Peninsula is home to the Promenade on the Peninsula mall, originally an enclosed regional mall with two department store anchors, May Company California and Bullocks Wilshire, as well as the Peninsula Center, which originally had a Buffums department store.

==Transportation==
The Palos Verdes Peninsula Transit Authority provides bus service within and to the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The Palos Verdes Peninsula is within 40 minutes of both LAX and Long Beach Airport, which together provide access to most of the United States aboard all major carriers.

==Education==
The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District has one of the highest rated API scores in California and has one of the highest average SAT scores and one of the highest percentage of students successfully completing the Advanced Placement exams in the county. There are three high schools, Palos Verdes Peninsula High School (formerly called Rolling Hills High School), Palos Verdes High School, and Rancho Del Mar High School (located in Rolling Hills). The former Marymount California University, a co-ed Roman Catholic four-year college was located in Rancho Palos Verdes. A private K–12 school, Chadwick School, is also located there. Rolling Hills Country Day School, adjacent to the Botanic Garden, offers a private K-8 education. In total, there are 11 elementary schools, 3 intermediate schools, and 3 high schools located on the peninsula.

In the Eastview neighborhood of Rancho Palos Verdes, however, residents have the option to choose either PV schools or the surrounding LAUSD schools (i.e. Dodson Middle School, Dana Middle School, San Pedro High School, etc.).

Additionally, students are also able to attend the California Academy of Mathematics and Science in Carson due to its attendance boundaries stretching to the South Bay, which is about 20-40 minutes from the peninsula itself.

===Libraries===
The Peninsula is served by the Palos Verdes Library District, which operates these three libraries:
* Peninsula Center Library
* Miraleste Library
* Malaga Cove Library- on the National Historical Register

The 40 Families Project based at Peninsula Center Library documents the history of the Japanese-American community on Palos Verdes before World War II.

==Parks and recreation==

* South Coast Botanic Garden – 35 hectare (87 acre) landscaped botanical garden, event venue, and arboretum with over 150,000 landscape plants and trees from approximately 140 families, 700 genera, and 2,000 different species. It is a classic example of land recycling by reclaiming a site that was previously a sanitary landfill and open pit diatomite mine from 1929 until 1956.
* Point Vicente Park is a popular spot for watching the migration of gray whales to and from their breeding lagoon in Baja California.
* Fort MacArthur Military Museum is located near Point Fermin in San Pedro.
* Del Cerro Park is a popular spot to hike trail at end of Crenshaw Blvd.
* Ryan Park is Rancho Palos Verdes&#x27;s first established park in the city, overlooking a view of nearby island Santa Catalina. Park features include baseball diamond, picnic areas with barbecue, and a community room.

The peninsula is frequented by runners, hikers, horseback riders, bird watchers, surfers, scuba divers, fishermen, and bicyclists. The area is home to several golf courses and country clubs. In addition, nude sunbathers formerly frequented Sacreds Cove (or &quot;Smugglers Cove&quot;) until the city of Rancho Palos Verdes enacted a 1994 ordinance that ended such use of that beach.

The infamous Palos Verdes surf spots have been in the spotlight many times over issues of localism. The most notorious surf spot for localism in Palos Verdes is Lunada Bay, which can hold any winter swell and has been known to rival Sunset Beach, Hawaii on a big day. Localism in Palos Verdes reached a turning point in 2001 when a civil rights lawsuit was filed after a particularly violent confrontation with Hermosa Beach surfers. Surveillance cameras were placed in the surfing area but were later removed. In 2016, The Coastal Commission targeted the group after &quot;renewed reports that their unpermitted structure [built along Lunada Bay] was being used as a spot for ongoing bullying and intimidation.&quot; On July 12, 2016, City Manager Tony Dahlerbruch recommended the removal of the illegal structure after pressure from the California Coastal Commission.

The Trump National Golf Club is a Donald Trump venture with a golf course on the Ocean Trails cliffs. The 18th hole of the prior golf course fell victim to a landslide caused by a leak in the sanitary pipes underneath it. In the summer of 2006, the golf club erected a 70-foot flagpole for an American flag; critics claimed it was illegal, but the golf club was allowed to retain it after a City Council vote.

The Marineland of the Pacific site near Portuguese Bend is currently home of Terranea, a luxury oceanfront resort.

There are numerous nature reserves in Palos Verdes: Palos Verdes Estates Shoreline Preserve, Agua Amarga Reserve, and Portuguese Bend Reserve. The reserves contain coastal sage scrubs habitats, a community of fragrant and drought resistant shrubs and flowering plants. In August 2009, wildfire burned approximately 165-acres of the Portuguese Bend Reserve. As a result, restoration has been done to reinstall native plants and animals to the area.

== Flora and fauna==
=== Native plants ===
* Succulents
* Trees

==Notable places==

* The Wayfarers Chapel, a transparent glass chapel in a redwood forest, was designed in 1951 by the renowned architect and landscape architect Lloyd Wright. It is under the stewardship of the Swedenborgian Church, a well-known landmark on the National Register of Historic Places, and overlooking the ocean at the western entrance of Portuguese Bend.
* Portuguese Bend is one of the most geologically unstable areas in the world. Constant shifting of the soil (approximately 1/3 of an inch a day) and rock slides mean that Palos Verdes Drive South, the main road through the bend, is under constant repair.
* Point Vicente Lighthouse is on the National Register of Historic Places.
* Korean Bell of Friendship is located near Point Fermin in San Pedro.
* Marineland of the Pacific is the location of the former aquatic theme park on the coast.

<text>Necker Island ( &quot;branched island&quot;) is a small uninhabited island in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. It is located at in the Pacific Ocean, northwest of Honolulu, Hawaii, northwest of Nihoa, and north of the Tropic of Cancer. It is part of the state of Hawaii in the United States. It contains important prehistoric archaeological sites of the Hawaiian culture and is part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge within the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument.

The United States Census Bureau reports Necker Island&#x27;s land area as . The island is rocky with steep sides and has very little soil. Its highest elevation is . The island is named after Jacques Necker, a finance minister of Louis XVI.

==Administration==

Politically, Necker Island is part of the City and County of Honolulu in the state of Hawaii. However, as part of the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, it is administered by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It has no resident human population.

==Geography==

The remnant of a volcanic cone, Necker Island is located about southeast of the French Frigate Shoals on the northwestern end of a large, shallow ocean bank. It is a hook-shaped rocky ridge about long and between wide. Composed of basalt, the island is steep-sided and barren, with very little soil, and its rocks are heavily scoured and eroded. It is the second-smallest of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, with a total area of according to the United States Census Bureau or or according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

The westernmost point on Necker Island is Mo&#x27;o Point (or Mo&#x27;o Head). The island&#x27;s &quot;hook&quot; is Northwest Cape, a narrow spur that reaches a maximum height of 48 meters (156 ft) and juts northeastward from the west end of the island for . Northwest Cape is connected to the rest of the island by a narrow gap that is barely above sea level. Northwest Cape&#x27;s tip is the northernmost point of the island.

The main ridge of the island and Northwest Cape combine to partially enclose Shark Bay along the northern shore of the island; the bay opens to the northeast and usually is subject to rough seas. Along the island&#x27;s western shore, West Cove lies between Mo&#x27;o Point and the southern end of Northwest Cape. A small islet, long and rising above sea level, lies just off Necker Island&#x27;s eastern tip.

The main ridge of Necker Island has five peaks. East to west, they are:

*Siever&#x27;s Peak, high
*Bowl Hill (or Bryan Peak), high
*Summit Hill (or Vaughn Peak), 84 meters (277 ft) high, the island&#x27;s highest point
*Flagpole Hill, high
*Annexation Peak (also Annexation Hill or Captain Brown Peak), 75 meters (247 ft) high

Bowl Cave is located on the northern slope of Bowl Hill. It is an important archaeological site.

Necker Island has an average annual rainfall of just under .

==Flora and fauna==

Vegetation on Necker Island is limited to low shrubs and grasses, none more than tall. Five species of plants are known to occur:
*Goosefoot shrub (&quot;Chenopodium oahuense&quot;), found on the island&#x27;s terraced slopes
*Bunch grass (&quot;Panicum torridum&quot;) (i.e., &quot;kakonakona&quot;), which grows on the north slope of the ridge
*Purslane (&quot;Portulaca lutea&quot;) (i.e., &quot;ihi&quot; weed), found on flat tops of the ridge
*Pickle weed (&quot;Sesuvium portulacastrum&quot;), a patch of which grows on the lower northeastern slope of Annexation Hill, where ocean spray from waves breaking in Shark Bay can reach it
*Ohai shrub (&quot;Sesbania tomentasa&quot;), which grows on the crest of the ridge

The forester of the Territory of Hawaii attempted to introduce six other species of plants to Necker Island in June 1923, but all had died out by the latter half of the 1930s, if not earlier.

The island is also noted for large numbers of birds. About 16 species of seabird nest on Necker Island; during nesting season, an estimated 60,000 birds nest on the island, and their eggs cover virtually every piece of level ground. A seabird first observed at Necker Island and at the French Frigate Shoals and Nihoa in 1902 originally was thought to be new to science and was given the scientific name &quot;Procelsterna saxatalis&quot; and the popular name &quot;Necker Island tern,&quot; but it later was identified as a subspecies of the blue-grey noddy, already known from farther south in the Pacific. No land birds live on the island. Land animals found on the island include land snails and 15 species of insect found nowhere else, as well as wolf spiders and bird ticks.

Although it is the second-smallest of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, Necker Island has the second-largest surrounding marine habitat among the islands, totaling , with Shark Bay, West Cove, Northwest Cape, and miles of shallow reef to the southeast of the island providing large offshore habitats. Runoff from the heavily eroded rock surfaces of the island and the constant wave action that scours its underwater basalt structure interfere with the growth of corals; little coral life exists in the shallow areas surrounding the island, and it lacks a fringing reef. However, 16 species of stony coral live in the area, and Necker is the easternmost island in the Hawaiian archipelago where table corals of the genus &quot;Acropora&quot; are found. Gray reef sharks and manta rays are common off the island, and Hawaiian monk seals populate its shores, some giving birth to pups there. Green sea turtles bask on the shore in the narrow gap between the main island and Northwest Cape, but they do not breed on Necker Island because the island lacks sandy beaches in which they could lay their eggs. A great abundance and diversity of sea cucumbers, sea urchins, and lobsters live in Shark Bay. Extensive deeper &quot;shelves&quot; extend many miles from the island&#x27;s shallow reef, especially to the southeast, and commercial fishing takes place over these shelves, which produce much of Hawaii&#x27;s catch of green jobfish, known locally as gray snapper or &quot;uku&quot;. Deep sea fish types that live hundreds of meters (yards) below the surface along the underwater slopes of Necker Island include fishes of the orders Stomiiformes, Gadiformes, Myctophiformes, and Aulopiformes.

==Archaeology==

Necker Island is known for its numerous religious sites and cultural objects. There are few, if any, signs of long-term habitation, giving rise to the theory that people visited the island for short periods from other islands instead of settling permanently. Many anthropologists believe that the island was a ceremonial and religious site. Necker has 55 currently known sites including 33 ritual sites called &quot;heiau,&quot; while the remaining sites represent agricultural terraces, miscellaneous platforms, and shelter caves — of which Bowl Cave is the largest. Cultural sites on Necker Island are contemporaneous with those on Nihoa and appear to have been abandoned at roughly the same time several centuries prior to European contact with the Hawaiian Islands.

The heiau on Necker Island and Nihoa are unique in the Hawaiian chain representing a raised pavement of basalt stones with upright stones placed across this pavement often near the edges as opposed to the form common to other islands in the chain represented by a high stacked stone wall enclosing a central space. This difference in form represents an earlier iteration of Hawaiian monumental architecture that offers a unique perspective on cultural norms prior to the abandonment of Necker. Thanks to this difference in form, scholars often use the term &#x27;marae&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;heiau&#x27; in reference to these structures and some scholars argue that the shift in form represents a shift in ritual practice in Hawaii.

Artifacts excavated on Necker Island show a remarkable number of items that would normally be made out of wood rendered in stone. This is especially true of the presence of a series of remarkable carved stone bowls and a bird snare that would have required far more time and effort to create from stone. Additionally, a series of human figures carved from local stone have been recovered from Necker. These statues are up to 1.5 feet (0.5 m) in length and differ in style and medium to similar sculptures (usually rendered in wood) recovered elsewhere in Hawaii. Other artifacts include adzes, fish and squid lures, hammer stones, awls, and other stone tools commonly found across the Hawaiian Islands.

According to the oral traditions of the people of Kauai, which lies to the southeast, Necker Island was the last known refuge for a race of mythical &quot;little people&quot; called the &quot;Menehune&quot;. According to the legend, the &quot;Menehune&quot; settled on Necker Island after being chased off Kauai by the stronger Polynesians and subsequently built the various stone structures there. 

==History==
Geological research in the early 21st century indicates that Necker Island is about 10 million years old. While it rises only about 84 meters (277 ft) above sea level now, it reached in height earlier in its history and at one time was comparable in size to modern Oahu.

Hawaiians appear to have started visiting Necker Island a few hundred years after they settled the main Hawaiian Islands. Archaeologists believe that the island&#x27;s poor soil for farming and its small size and relative lack of rainfall made it uninhabitable, and that the Hawaiians visited from Nihoa and other nearby islands to worship at religious sites without establishing any permanent settlements. Their visits appear to have ended a few hundred years before European contact, and by the time Europeans first visited Hawaii in the late eighteenth century, Necker Island apparently was unknown to the Hawaiians.

The French explorer Jean-François de La Pérouse was on a mission of exploration for the French Academy of Sciences aboard the ships &quot;L&#x27;Astrolabe&quot; (under command of Fleuriot de Langle) and &quot;La Boussole&quot; and had just discovered the French Frigate Shoals (&quot;Basse des Frégates Françaises&quot;) and his namesake rock La Perouse Pinnacle when on November 4, 1786, he became the first European to visit Necker Island. La Pérouse did not attempt to land on the island due to its nearly vertical sides and the violent seas breaking on its shore, but he sailed within a third of a league of it and named it after Jacques Necker, a Genevan banker and statesman who served as finance minister for Louis XVI of France. Although the expedition was lost at sea in 1788, it was able to send its logs home before its loss, bringing the island&#x27;s existence to the attention of Europeans. The first people to set foot on Necker Island in modern times appear to have been the British seaman John Turnbull of the ship &quot;Margaret&quot;, who visited the Hawaiian Islands between December 17, 1802, and January 21, 1803, and two Hawaiian pearl divers in his employ; the three men landed on the island during an expedition to find pearls on a reef in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands.

Captain John or William Paty (sources disagree on Paty&#x27;s first name) claimed Necker Island for the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1857, although he did not land on the island. The claim was disputed over the following decades. In January 1859, United States Navy Lieutenant J. M. Brook aboard the survey schooner visited Necker Island and determined its position. During the summer of 1859, Captain N. C. Brook of the Hawaiian barque &quot;Gambia&quot; passed the island during a sealing and exploration voyage, but did not report landing on it.

As late as the early 1890s, the Kingdom of Hawaii&#x27;s claim to Necker Island remained in dispute, and the United Kingdom was considering the island as a potential waypoint location for a submarine communications cable between Canada and Australia as part of the British Empire telegraph network known informally as the All Red Line. The Kingdom of Hawaii was overthrown in 1893 and replaced by the Provisional Government of Hawaii, and when the British corvette arrived at Honolulu in 1894, the provisional government&#x27;s president, Sanford B. Dole, became concerned that the United Kingdom was about to establish a claim to Necker Island. Wishing to curry favor with the United States rather than the United Kingdom, Dole immediately dispatched an expedition under Captain James A. King to Necker to annex the island. On May 27, 1894, a landing party of 12 men led by King went ashore on Necker for four hours, raised the flag of Hawaii on what became known as Annexation Hill, and read an annexation proclamation. The move brought international disputes over claims to the island to an end and the island was included in the Republic of Hawaii when it was founded on July 4, 1894, although the British government continued to attempt to negotiate with the Hawaiian government over use of Necker Island and on September 24, 1894, &quot;Champion&quot; landed a party on the island. On July 12, 1895, King led a Hawaiian government expedition — which also included the first director of the Bishop Museum, William Tufts Brigham, and Professor William DeWitt Alexander — to Necker to survey and map the island and conduct archaeological research. On August 12, 1898, the United States annexed the Hawaiian Islands, including Necker Island, and Necker was included in the Territory of Hawaii upon its creation on April 30, 1900.

In 1902, the United States Fish Commission research ship USFC &quot;Albatross&quot; visited Necker Island, and her personnel thought they discovered the &quot;Necker Island tern&quot; there, as well as on Nihoa and at the French Frigate Shoals, during their visit, although the bird later was determined to be a subspecies of the blue-grey noddy, already known from farther south in the Pacific. The island was leased for commercial fishing purposes for 21 years on June 2, 1904, and on February 3, 1909, it became part of the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation, managed jointly by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Territory of Hawaii.

George N. Wilcox visited Necker Island twice on unrecorded dates, and the United States Revenue Cutter Service revenue cutter USRC &quot;Thetis&quot; visited the island in 1910 and 1913, as did an expedition led by H. L. Tucker in 1917. The warden of the Hawaiian Islands Bird Reservation landed on the island on October 6, 1919, and found stone artifacts during his visit. The &quot;Tanager&quot; Expedition visited Necker Island in 1923 and 1924, and is noted for exploring the island&#x27;s biology and archaeology; during its first visit, from June 12 to 29, 1923, it mapped the island and studied its flora and fauna in detail, and on its return visit from July 14 to July 17, 1924, it conducted a thorough archaeological survey.

On August 21, 1959, the state of Hawaii was created, and Necker was included in the new state. Because of Necker Island&#x27;s usage by Native Hawaiians as a ceremonial and religious site in Ancient Hawaii, the United States government added the island to its National Register of Historic Places in 1988. In 1997, members of the Native Hawaiian organization &quot;Hui Mälama I Nä Kupuna O Hawaiʻi Nei&quot; (&quot;Hawaiʻi Ancestral Care Association&quot;) visited the island to rebury human bones found there which had been transported to Honolulu and kept at Bishop Museum.

In the early 21st century, Necker Island was a place of study for benthic invertebrates and algal assemblages. On June 15, 2006, the United States established the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, with Necker Island within its boundaries.

==Access==

Access to Necker Island is by boat, and is quite difficult because of the island&#x27;s nearly vertical coastline. Heavy surf usually precludes landings along the coast in Shark Bay, but a small lee exists west of Northwest Cape, and landing on rocky shelves there is possible in moderately calm weather but can be dangerous in high surf.

Visits to Necker Island are permitted only for scientific, educational, and cultural purposes and require the approval of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, which gives preference to scientific and cultural visits.

<text>Sprint cars are open-wheel race cars, designed primarily for the purpose of running on short oval, circular dirt or paved tracks. Historically known simply as &quot;big cars,&quot; distinguishing them from &quot;midget cars,&quot; sprint car racing is popular primarily in the United States and Canada, as well as in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa.
Sprint cars have very high power-to-weight ratios, with weights of approximately (including the driver) and power outputs of over , which give them a power-to-weight ratio besting that of contemporary F1 cars. Typically, they are powered by a naturally aspirated, methanol-injected overhead valve American V8 engine with a displacement of 410 cubic inches (6.7L) and capable of engine speeds of 9000 rpm. Depending on the mechanical setup (engine, gearing, shocks, etc.) and the track layout, these cars can achieve speeds in excess of . A lower-budget and very popular class of sprint cars uses 360-cubic-inch (5.9L) engines that produce up to 775 horsepower. Sprint cars do not utilize a transmission but have an in-or-out gearbox and quick-change rear differentials for occasional gearing changes. As a result, they do not have electric starters (or even electrical systems other than a ignition magneto) and require a push to be started. The safety record of sprint car racing in recent years has been greatly improved by the use of roll cages, and especially on dirt tracks, wings, which increase surface traction, to protect the drivers.
Many IndyCar Series and NASCAR drivers used sprint car racing as an intermediate stepping stone on their way to more high-profile divisions, including Indianapolis 500 winners A. J. Foyt, Mario Andretti, Johnny Rutherford, Parnelli Jones, Johnnie Parsons, Al Unser Sr., and Al Unser Jr., as well as NASCAR Cup Series champions Jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart and Kyle Larson.

The National Sprint Car Hall of Fame &amp; Museum, located in Knoxville, Iowa, features exhibits highlighting the history of both winged and wingless sprint cars.

==Engine==
==Wingless sprint cars==

There are several sanctioning bodies for wingless sprint cars. Once dominant United States Automobile Club (USAC) became USAC/California Racing Association (USAC/CRA) after taking over the Sprint Car Racing Association (SCRA). USAC/CRA remains popular on the West Coast, East Coast and in Indiana. However, lack of leadership in much of the US has resulted in a large number of groups and sanctioning bodies supporting wingless sprint cars.

Wingless sprint cars are considered the traditional sprint cars, dating back to the first sprint cars in the 1930s and 1940s (that ultimately evolved into Indy cars). Today, they are essentially the same car as a winged sprint car, only without wings. In fact, many of them have the &quot;stub outs&quot; in the frame for adding wings. They generally use the same and aluminum engines as their winged counterparts (although many local tracks have rules mandating steel blocks and some displacements, this is mostly a cost control). Some newer regional groups, specifically POWRi and Elite have chosen to allow open engines with no limit to engine size. Their tuning and gearing are different for performance at lower RPMs than winged cars. Chassis set ups and tires are also different.

While they do not have the same top speed as a winged car (because they lack downforce for traction), they are thought by many to be more entertaining to watch. Their relative lack of grip creates different driving characteristics than their winged counterparts, causing them to be more difficult to control through the corners. This, and the lack of roll-over protection a wing provides, makes them more dangerous than winged cars and their crashes are known for their spectacular nature.

==Winged sprint cars==
The world&#x27;s first small-track winged race car was driven by Jim Cushman at the Columbus Motor Speedway (Ohio) in 1958. Cushman drove with his winged super-modified (wing created by Gene and Floyd Miller) in several races and even won with it, starting a new trend of winged cars in sprint and super-modified racing. By 1959, up to half of the field was racing with a wing at Columbus Motor Speedway. In the early 1970s, many sprint car drivers began to put wings with sideboards on both the front and top of their cars. The added wings increase the downforce generated on the car, with the opposite direction of the sideboards helping to turn the car in the corners. The increased traction makes the car faster and easier to control.

The wing also affects safety. The added downforce lessens the likelihood of going airborne. When cars do go airborne, the wings contact the ground first and break off or crumple upon hitting the ground, lessening the impact on the driver and the car. For these reasons, winged cars are safer to drive. Often teams are able to replace the wing during the ensuing stoppage and are able to continue once the race resumes.

In 1978, Ted Johnson formed the promotional body for winged sprint cars called the World of Outlaws. Racing throughout the United States from February to November, the World of Outlaws is the premier dirt sprint car racing series. Famous tracks featured in the series included the Eldora Speedway in Rossburg, Ohio, the Lernerville Speedway in Sarver, Pennsylvania, the Knoxville Raceway in Knoxville, Iowa and Williams Grove Speedway in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania. Each August, the Knoxville Raceway holds the Knoxville Nationals.

In 1987, Australia followed suit with its own national series for winged sprint cars called the World Series Sprintcars, founded by Adelaide based sedan driver and Speedway Park track promoter John Hughes. Famous Australian tracks used in the WSS have included Speedway Park/City in Adelaide, South Australia, Claremont Speedway and later Perth Motorplex in Perth, Western Australia, Valvoline Raceway in Sydney, New South Wales, Archerfield Speedway in Brisbane, Queensland, and the Premier Speedway (home of the Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic) in Warrnambool, Victoria. There is also a single meeting Australian Sprintcar Championship which has been run since 1963 and has been run under various class names before finally settling on the Australian Sprintcar Championship in 1979. While non-Australian drivers are free to race in the WSS and other meetings including the various state championships, only Australian drivers are permitted in the Australian Championship meeting.

The Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic at Warrnambool is the largest sprint car meeting in the world; in the 2014–15 season, the 2015 Classic race outdrew the Knoxville Nationals in entries.

Until the early 2000s, sprint cars in Australia were restricted to 6200 cc (372 cui) V8 engines as opposed to the 410 cui (6.7 L) engines used in the United States and New Zealand. Brian Healey, the Sacramento-based Australian who owned Parramatta City Raceway, pushed for the change in 2003 to follow both nations to 410. Today, Australia follows the standard 410 ci formula, and has both the 410 and 360 cui (5.9 L) formulae. Both formulae have separate Australian Championship meetings.

== Midget cars ==

Midget cars are smaller versions of a full size sprint car, normally non-wing only. Midgets date back to the 1930s as a very common form of sprint car racing, still very popular today and also sanctioned by USAC, POWRI, and others. They are powered by four-cylinder engines developing around 350 horsepower (260 kW), but are only similar to their larger cousins in appearance.

==Mini sprint==

Mini sprints are similarly sized to midget cars, but have upright-style chassis and center-mounted, chain-driven four-cylinder motorcycle engines with displacements between 750 and 1200 cc.

==Micro sprints==

Micro sprints are small racecars that are smaller versions of full sprint cars. A starter class for striving sprint car enthusiasts. 250/270cc single-cylinder two-cycle and 600 cc are the most popular micro sprint classes. They run side-mounted 600 cc motorcycle engines developing around 140 hp and are chain driven. They have chassis and bodies styled like those of full-sized sprint cars or midgets. Micro sprints are generally run on small dirt tracks that are usually a fifth of a mile or less in size, though they sometimes run on larger tracks. They can be either raced with or without wings; the latter are sometimes called &quot;micro midgets&quot; or &quot;600 cc sprints&quot;. The general minimum weights for the cars to pass tech is 775 lbs for winged and 725 lbs for non-wing. Micro sprints are generally a cheaper alternative than racing mini sprints or midget sprints, but they can be as expensive as full-sized sprint cars.

== Outlaw karts ==
Outlaw karts are go karts with roll cages and wings. They are some of the cheapest race cars that are very competitive, costing around $5,000. Most tracks are one sixth of a mile or less. Outlaw karts run side-mounted engines of various types. The beginner boxstock and boxstock divisions run pull start clone motors and are usually for the younger drivers first getting their start. The intermediate division run 250 cc dirt bike engines with the drivers or teams having the choice of running a four-stroke or a two-stroke. At some tracks, the intermediate division has to run a harder compound of tire. The biggest division in outlaw karts is the open division. The opens can run 450 cc four strokes, 500 cc two strokes, or 550 cc four-strokes. The 450 cc and 500 cc motors are the more popular options because the 550 cc motors are not run at all tracks, and the tracks that do run them make the kart weigh extra. The weight range for the karts is 150 lb to 500 lb.

==Sanctioning bodies==

The NOS Energy Drink World of Outlaws (WoO) is a division of 410ci (6.7L) winged sprint cars that run all over the United States and have a few events in Canada. The cars have wide right rear tires and 410 cubic inch engines with mechanical fuel injection. These sprint cars have no batteries or starters in them, necessitating push starts by a quad or truck. They also do not have flywheels, clutches or transmissions, but the direct drive systems can be engaged or disengaged from the cockpits. This is done both for weight reasons and tradition. Another tradition the WoO has pertaining their &quot;A-main&quot; (the last race of the event) is to have the cars line up four wide just before starting the race as a salute to fans in attendance, giving rise to the popular PA message &quot;you want the best, now you have them four abreast&quot;.

The All Star Circuit of Champions (ASCoC) is an American motorsports sanctioning body of winged sprint car racing founded in 1970. The series sanctions 410ci sprint car races in Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin, New York, and Florida. On average the series runs 40 races per year, starting February and ending in October each year.

The United States Automobile Club (USAC) National Sprint Car Championship is a division of wingless 410 cubic inch sprint cars that run throughout the United States on asphalt and dirt tracks. The USAC also sanctions regional 360ci wingless sprint car series: the USAC East Coast Sprint Cars, USAC Southwest Sprint Cars, and USAC West Coast Sprint Cars.

The United Racing Company (URC) is a division for winged sprint cars that run mainly in the northeastern part of the United States in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The URC started in 1948 with 11 races in its season. It slowly progressed to 28 races. The URC uses a 360 cubic inch (5.9 L) engine which generates approximately . They race with alcohol fuel and use mechanical fuel injection (MFI) to deliver it into the combustion chamber.

The American Sprint Car Series (ASCS) sanctions both winged and wingless sprint car racing within the United States. ASCS winged cars use a 360 cubic inch engine which lead to fans calling the cars &quot;360s&quot;. The series was started by well-known racing promoter Emmett Hahn. The series national headquarters were located in Tulsa, Oklahoma for much of its history, but moved to Concord, North Carolina in 2024 following World Racing Group&#x27;s purchase of the series. The all-time leader in wins for the series is Texan Gary Wright with 127 A main victories under his belt. Engine rules for the non-wing cars vary by series with some having unlimited displacement engines.

The International Motor Contest Association (IMCA) was organized in 1915, and is currently the oldest active auto racing sanctioning body in the United States. It sanctions traditional 305 non-winged and winged sprint cars under the IMCA RaceSaver Sprint Car class.

In Australia, sprint car racing is controlled by the Sprintcar Control Council of Australia (SCCA) who sanction the Australian Championships and the World Series Sprintcar series as well as the various state championships and other meetings held around the country.

==Wingless sprint car series==
==Winged sprint car series==
==Sprint Car World Championship==
Despite over 50 years of sprint car racing, the category has only ever held one unofficial &quot;world championship&quot;. This was in 1987 at the ⅓ mile () Claremont Speedway in Perth, Western Australia. The event attracted a collection of drivers from Australia, NZ, Canada, and South Africa, as well as several World of Outlaws drivers. Australian veteran Garry Rush from Sydney, a 10-time winner of the Australian Sprintcar Championship, was the winner.

==Television coverage==

===United States===
Wingless cars were televised first when USAC had an ESPN television contract. The first national live television deal with winged sprint cars came on The Nashville Network (TNN) in 1992–93 and again in 1993–94 with a winter-based series in Arizona, which featured Mike Joy calling the action. Live coverage of the Knoxville Nationals on The Nashville Network began in 1995. A year later, a next-day tape deal with CBS for one race at Eldora Speedway aired while TNN coverage expanded. By 2000, CBS (which owned TNN at the time) announced TNN would air 15 live events, including the King&#x27;s Royal at Eldora Speedway and the Knoxville Nationals. By the 2001 season, plans were to cover 18 live races, but midway through the season MTV Networks closed the CBS motorsports operations. This move relegated the remainder of the World of Outlaws season to tape delay races. A tape delayed deal with Speed Channel followed for the next season. Television coverage began on the Outdoor Channel in 2003. Events are usually tape delayed for two weeks or more. The Knoxville Nationals were on Speed Channel. The 2004 Knoxville Nationals did not air as bad weather postponed the event, and there was not enough space for Speed to air the event, won by Kraig Kinser. In 2003, Johnson sold his organization to DIRT Motorsports. Because of complaints about DIRT Motorsports and the lack of television coverage, Northwest Sprint Tour owner Fred Brownfield formed the National Sprint Tour as a rival to the World of Outlaws Sprint for the 2006 season. Notable teams in the NST included Steve Kinser Racing (No. 11), Roth Motorsports (sometimes known as the &quot;Beef Packers&quot; team) (No. 83), Tony Stewart Racing (No. 20). After Brownfield Promotions&#x27; owner Fred Brownfield was killed in a crash, Kinser and principals of two other teams purchased the entire Brownfield promotion. That series folded after the 2006 season, while the Northwest tour, a regional tour, was sold. The SuperClean Summer of Money aired on ESPN2 starting in mid June 2008 with the World of Outlaws at Knoxville Raceway and for eight weeks straight leading up to the Knoxville Nationals which were live on Speed. In 2015, the World of Outlaws had several races broadcast on CBS Sports Network. Knoxville Raceway has their weekly series as well as World of Outlaws and National Sprint League events on MavTV. USAC currently has some races televised on MavTV, primarily through Jack Slash Media&#x27;s Dirty 30 highlights program. Other series such as the Lucas Oil ASCS Sprint Car Series, King of the West Sprint Cars, King of the Wing Pavement Sprint Cars, and several weekly regional series on MavTV.

===Australia===
In Australia, the World Series Sprintcars was formerly televised on free-to-air channel One HD.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the Hydraulink War of the Wings is streamed only by RJPTV on a pay per video program.
However Sprintcar racing can be seen from Western Springs in Auckland or the Bay per View from Baypark Speedway the biggest Sprintcar track in New Zealand

==Safety aspects==
Safety in sprint car racing has continuously evolved over the years as the cars have gotten faster and teams look to garner any advantage with weight and horsepower. While many regulations are centered around the class or division, each sanctioning body typically has a section in its rulebook dedicated to safety. These can vary between sanctioning bodies, and many even set safety standards for those hosting an event.

Some of the most common safety requirements placed on the teams are: an emergency shut-off switch, a quick-detach steering wheel, aluminum seats with high impact head rests with shock absorbing materials, fire resistant suits, underwear, shoes, and gloves, a full face helmet meeting that meets or exceeds a specified Snell or SFI rating, safety harness (most common is a 5-point harness) that meets a specified SFI rating, a neck restraint that meets a given safety rating, and at any time the car and equipment may be subject to inspection. The various SFI and Snell ratings may differ between sanctioning bodies, and many rule books include additional safety recommendations to be used at team or driver discretion.

As for those hosting an event the sanctioning body will often place mandatory safety requirements on the facility including guard rails, retaining walls, concrete walls, and electronic caution lights. It is also typically the facility&#x27;s responsibility of having an ambulance on site that meets DOT standards, fire equipment and staff, properly licensed medical staff and equipment, track communications, and safety equipment such as tow trucks. It is common for a facility to be visited prior to an event for inspection and updates be made prior to the event taking place.

<doc id="683084" wikidata="Q6981941" url="?curid=683084" title="Naval Station Newport">
<text>Naval Station Newport (NAVSTA Newport) is a United States Navy base located in the city of Newport and the town of Middletown, Rhode Island. Naval Station Newport is home to the Naval War College and the Naval Justice School. It once was the homeport for Cruiser Destroyer Force Atlantic (COMCRUDESLANT), which relocated to Naval Station Norfolk in the early 1970s. In 1989 the base was added to the National Priorities List, after contamination had been discovered years earlier. Newport now maintains inactive ships at its pier facilities, along with the United States Coast Guard and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research vessels. In BRAC 2005 (Base Realignment and Closure), NAVSTA Newport gained over five hundred billets, in addition to receiving, again, the Officer Candidate School (OCS), the Naval Supply Corps School (in 2011), and several other activities, to include a few Army Reserve units.

==Geography==
As of 2022 Naval Station Newport, encompasses 1,063 acres on the west coast of Aquidneck Island in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, Middletown, Rhode Island, and Newport, Rhode Island. The Base also encompasses the northern third of Gould Island (Rhode Island) in the Town of Jamestown, RI.
===Environmental contamination===
In 1983, contamination was suspected on 18 areas to pose a threat to human health and/or the environment and in 1989 the base was added to the National Priorities List (NPL). As of 2022, only two sites have no remaining activities, one (Melville North Landfill) because it doesn&#x27;t belong to the Navy and the other was completed in 2009 (Melville Water Tower). In 1996, a Restoration Advisory Board (RAB) was established.

From 1955 to the mid-1970s, an 11-acre portion of the site along the shore of Narragansett Bay, McAllister Point Landfill, accepted wastes consisting of acids, solvents, paint, waste oil, and oil contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyl. Five tank farms are located in the Melville area; one is located in Midway, one tank farm is located 300 feet from a coastal wetland. Sludge from nearby tank farms was dumped on the ground or burned in chambers.
Other areas of concern are an old fire fighting training area, Gould Island, Derecktor Shipyard, Carr Point Storage Area, and MRP Site 1 Carr Point Shooting Range. In 2016, DFSP Melville was added as a new site. The Melville North Landfill was classified as Formerly Used Defense Sites, and will be addressed separately. 
Of note, surface water and groundwater flow toward Narragansett Bay, which is used for boating and fishing. About 4,800 people obtain drinking water and 220 acres of land are irrigated from private wells located within three miles of the site and about 10,000 people live within three miles of the site.

The petroleum tanks housed at Naval Station Newport are overseen by the federal Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), but the firefighting systems were maintained by the Navy. While the land is polluted with petroleum and PFAS, the Navy has responsibility for PFAS contamination and the DLA for with petroleum. In 2021, after 2 years of the navy being &quot;in the process&quot; of getting permission to test land under the Portsmouth jurisdiction, little progress had been made.

==History==
The US Department of Navy officially founded the Newport Training Station in 1883, but the legwork between the state of Rhode Island and the Navy dated back to the late 1870s. The Training Station was intended to provide education for young men and boys for a ten month period. Initially 750 students, the training occurred initially on water, fully transitioning to being shore-based by 1887.

During the Civil War, the US Naval Academy was temporarily moved from Annapolis, Maryland to Newport to avoid any potential conflicts relating to the insurgency. Naval training ships, including the USS &quot;Constitution&quot;, USS &quot;Santee&quot; and USS &quot;John Adams&quot; were also moved to Newport Harbor during the conflict to train midshipmen for the Union.

According to the Newport Historical Society,

&quot;With the outbreak of World War I in 1914 the first preparations for war began, and the Training Station expanded onto Coddington Point. By 1916 there were 7,215 men stationed there, and Newport became the home for a yeoman school, signal school, Hospital Corps Training School, Commissary School, Musician&#x27;s School, and a Firemen&#x27;s School. After the United States formally entered WWI in April 1917 the Naval Station received authority to increase capacity by 10,000 men. Temporary barracks, mess halls and auxiliary buildings were made into Camp Sadler on Coasters Island, as well as a tent city for 2,800 recruits called Camp Palmer. The enacting of the Selective Service Act of 1917 brought an average of 15,000 men each month for training, and while women were not eligible for the draft, they began enrolling in the Navy at this time. All of this led to more expansion. During WWI, Training Station Newport equipped and sent 65,000 sailors to sea, in addition to thousands of Naval reservists trained there.&quot;

In 1919, the station became known for its Newport sex scandal.

From 1900 to the mid-1970s the Newport Naval Education/Training Center (NETC) was used by the Navy as a refueling depot with tank farms and underground storage tanks.

==Current operations==
The station was home of the decommissioned after the departure of the under tow for the inactive ship storage facility in Philadelphia. On May 8, 2014, Naval Sea Systems Command announced that ESCO Marine, Brownsville, Texas, would scrap &quot;Saratoga&quot; for one cent.

As of September 2014, the Rhode Island Aviation Hall of Fame was trying to move the decommissioned moored at Pier 2 at the station.

Naval Health Clinic New England provides the health care facilities.

On December 5th, 2023 the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration awarded a construction contract for new Atlantic Marine Operations Center to be completed by 2027. 

==Tenant commands==

Naval Station Newport provides the facilities and infrastructure essential to support the operations of tenant commands and visiting fleet units.

<text>Þjórsá () is Iceland&#x27;s longest river at . It is in the south of the island.

Þjórsá is a glacier river and has its source on the glacier Hofsjökull. It flows out through narrow gorges in the highlands of Iceland. Further downstream, another river, the Tungnaá, flows into it (see also Háifoss), before it enters the lowlands. There it passes the valley of Þjórsárdalur (Thjorsardalur) where the historical farm of Stöng is located. In the lowlands it flows along the eastern border of the Great Þjórsá Lava.

In the middle of the now rather wide river, there is a big island called &quot;Árnes&quot; , where there used to be a &quot;Þing&quot;. The administrative unit of Árnessýsla was named after it.

The &quot;hringvegur&quot; (Road No. 1) traverses the river via a bridge between Selfoss and Hella. Some distance to the southwest the river flows into the Atlantic Ocean.

&#x27;Á&#x27; signifies river while &#x27;þjór&#x27; means bull and is cognate to Danish - tyr, Swedish - tjur and Latin - taurus. According to the &quot;Book of Settlement&quot;, the river was named after the bovine prow statue of one of the first settlement ships.

<doc id="683092" wikidata="Q40053" url="?curid=683092" title="Cruelty to animals">
<text>Cruelty to animals, also called animal abuse, animal neglect or animal cruelty, is the infliction of suffering or harm by humans upon non-human animals, either by omission (neglect) or by commission. More narrowly, it can be the causing of harm or suffering for specific achievements, such as killing animals for entertainment; cruelty to animals sometimes encompasses inflicting harm or suffering as an end in itself, referred to as zoosadism. Divergent approaches to laws concerning animal cruelty occur in different jurisdictions throughout the world. For example, some laws govern methods of killing animals for food, clothing, or other products, and other laws concern the keeping of animals for entertainment, education, research, or pets. There are several conceptual approaches to the issue of cruelty to animals.

Even though some practices, like animal fighting, are widely acknowledged as cruel, not all people and nations have the same definition of what constitutes animal cruelty. Many would claim that docking a piglet&#x27;s tail without an anesthetic constitutes cruelty. Others would respond that it is a routine technique for meat production to prevent harm later in the pig&#x27;s life. Additionally, laws governing animal cruelty vary from nation to nation. While it is routine practice in the United States, docking a piglet&#x27;s tail as part of regular practice is prohibited in the European Union (EU).

Utilitarian advocates argue from the position of costs and benefits and vary in their conclusions as to the allowable treatment of animals. Some utilitarians argue for a weaker approach that is closer to the animal welfare position, whereas others argue for a position that is similar to animal rights. Animal rights theorists criticize these positions, arguing that the words &quot;unnecessary&quot; and &quot;humane&quot; are subject to widely differing interpretations and that animals have basic rights. They say that most animal use itself is unnecessary and a cause of suffering, so the only way to ensure protection for animals is to end their status as property and to ensure that they are never viewed as a substance or as non-living things.

== Definition and viewpoints ==
Throughout history, some individuals, like Leonardo da Vinci for example, who once purchased caged birds in order to set them free, were concerned about cruelty to animals. His notebooks also record his anger with the fact that humans used their dominance to raise animals for slaughter. According to contemporary philosopher Nigel Warburton, for most of human history the dominant view has been that animals are there for humans to do with as they see fit. Sociologist David Nibert emphasizes that the process of domestication dramatically increased the exploitation of animals by humans, particularly in Eurasia. Much of this exploitation involved not only direct physical violence, but also structural violence as their systemic oppression and enslavement &quot;resulted in their inability to meet their basic needs, the loss of self-determination, and the loss of opportunity to live in a natural way.&quot; He says that the remains of domesticated animals from thousands of years ago found during archeological excavations revealed numerous bone pathologies, which provide evidence of extreme suffering:

Several religious traditions have promoted animal welfare as an important or fundamental concept, and encouraged vegetarianism or veganism. Examples include Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism (with certain animals being considered sacred), and some forms of Judaism (many Orthodox Jews do not wear leather).

René Descartes believed that non-humans are complex machines with no soul, mind, or reason. In Cartesian dualism, consciousness was unique to human among all other animals and linked to physical matter by divine grace. However, close analysis shows that many human features such as complex sign usage, tool use, and self-consciousness can be found in some animals. In 2012, a prominent group of neuroscientists signed the &quot;Cambridge Declaration on Consciousness&quot;. It stated that humans are not the only conscious beings, and that many other animals, including all mammals and birds, also possess consciousness, challenging the Cartesian view of animals as mechanical beings.

Charles Darwin, by presenting the theory of evolution, revolutionized the way that humans viewed their relationship with other species. Darwin believed that not only did human beings have a direct kinship with other animals, but the latter had social, mental, and moral lives too. Later, in &quot;The Descent of Man&quot; (1871), he wrote: &quot;There is no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in their mental faculties.&quot;

Modern philosophers and intellectuals, such as Peter Singer and Tom Regan, have argued that animals&#x27; ability to feel pain as humans do makes their well-being worthy of equal consideration. There are many precursors of this train of thought. Jeremy Bentham, the founder of utilitarianism, famously wrote in his &quot;An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation&quot; (1789):

These arguments have prompted some to suggest that animals&#x27; well-being should enter a social welfare function directly, not just indirectly via its effect only on human well-being. Many countries have now formally recognized animal sentience and animal suffering, and have passed anti-cruelty legislation in response.

==Forms==
Animal cruelty can be broken down into two main categories: active and passive. Passive cruelty is typified by cases of neglect, in which the cruelty is a lack of action rather than the action itself. Oftentimes passive animal cruelty is accidental, born of ignorance. In many cases of neglect in which an investigator believes that the cruelty occurred out of ignorance, the investigator may attempt to educate the pet owner, then revisit the situation. In more severe cases, exigent circumstances may require that the animal be removed for veterinary care.

===Industrial animal farming===

Farm animals are generally produced in large, industrial facilities that house thousands of animals at high densities; these are sometimes called factory farms. The industrial nature of these facilities means that many routine procedures or animal husbandry practices impinge on the welfare of the animals and could be considered cruelty, with Henry Stephen Salt claiming in 1899 that &quot;it is impossible to transport and slaughter vast numbers of large and highly-sensitive animals humanely&quot;.
It has been suggested the number of animals hunted, kept as companions, used in laboratories, reared for the fur industry, raced, and used in zoos and circuses, is insignificant compared to farm animals, and therefore the &quot;animal welfare issue&quot; is numerically reducible to the &quot;farm animal welfare issue&quot;. Similarly, it has been suggested by campaign groups that chickens, cows, pigs, and other farm animals are among the most numerous animals subjected to cruelty. For example, because male chickens do not lay eggs, newly hatched males are culled using macerators or grinders. Worldwide meat overconsumption is another factor that contributes to the miserable situation of farm animals. Many undercover investigators have exposed the animal cruelty taking place inside the factory farming industry and there is evidence to show that consumers provided with accurate information about the process of meat production and the abuse that accompanies it has led to changes in their attitudes.

The American Veterinary Medical Association accepts maceration subject to certain conditions, but recommends alternative methods of culling as more humane. Egg-laying hens are then transferred to &quot;battery cages&quot; where they are kept in high densities. Matheny and Leahy attribute osteoporosis in hens to this caging method. Broiler chickens suffer similar situations, in which they are fed steroids to grow at a super-fast speed, so fast that their bones, heart, and lungs often cannot keep up. Broiler chickens under six weeks old suffer painful crippling due to fast growth rates, whilst one in a hundred of these very young birds dies of heart failure.

To reduce aggression in overcrowded conditions, shortly after birth piglets are castrated, their tails are amputated, and their teeth are clipped, and earmarked. Calves are sometimes raised in veal crates, which are small stalls that immobilize calves during their growth, reducing costs and preventing muscle development, making the resulting meat a pale color, preferred by consumers.

In the United States, animal cruelty such as soring, which is illegal, sometimes occurs on farms and ranches, as does lawful but cruel treatment such as livestock branding. Since ag-gag laws prohibit video or photographic documentation of farm activities, these practices have been documented by secret photography taken by whistleblowers or undercover operatives from such organizations as Mercy for Animals and the Humane Society of the United States posing as employees. Agricultural organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation have successfully advocated for laws that tightly restrict secret photography or concealing information from farm employers.

=== Welfare concerns of farm animals ===

The following are lists of invasive procedures that cause pain, routinely performed on farm animals, and housing conditions that routinely cause animal welfare concerns. In one survey of United States homeowners, 68% of respondents said they consider the price of meat a more important issue.

=== Fur industry ===

Animal welfare activists suggest a total ban on fur production due to the suffering inflicted on animals, especially minks. It has been suggested that fur production is immoral as fur clothes are luxury items. Minks are solitary and territorial animals; however, in fur farms, they are raised in cages and skinned after being killed either by breaking their necks or using lethal gas.

===Alleged link to human violence and psychological disorders===
There are studies providing evidence of a link between animal cruelty and violence towards humans. A 2009 study found that slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates, arrests for violent crimes, arrests for rape, and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries. A large national survey by the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies found a &quot;substantial overlap between companion animal abuse and child abuse&quot; and that cruelty to animals &quot;most frequently co-occurred with psychological abuse and less severe forms of physical child abuse.&quot;

A history of torturing pets and small animals, a behavior known as zoosadism, is considered one of the signs of certain psychopathologies, including antisocial personality disorder, also known as a psychopathic personality disorder. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;[the FBI has found that a history of cruelty to animals is one of the traits that regularly appears in its computer records of serial rapists and murderers, and the standard diagnostic and treatment manual for psychiatric and emotional disorders lists cruelty to animals a diagnostic criterion for conduct disorders.&quot; &quot;A survey of psychiatric patients who had repeatedly tortured dogs and cats found all of them had high levels of aggression toward people as well, including one patient who had murdered a young boy.&quot; Robert K. Ressler, an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s behavioral sciences unit, studied serial killers and noted, &quot;Murderers like this (Jeffrey Dahmer) very often start by killing and torturing animals as kids.&quot;

Acts of intentional animal cruelty or non-accidental injury may be indicators of serious psychological problems. According to the American Humane Association, 13% of intentional animal abuse cases involve domestic violence. As many as 71% of pet-owning women seeking shelter at safe houses have reported that their partner had threatened and/or hurt or killed one or more of their pets; 32% of these women reported that one or more of their children had also hurt or killed pets. Battered women report that they are hesitant about leaving their abusers because they fear what will happen to the animals in their absence. Animal abuse is sometimes used as a form of intimidation in domestic disputes.

Cruelty to animals is one of the three components of the Macdonald triad. This behavior is considered to be one of the signs of violent antisocial behavior in children and adolescents. According to the studies used to form this model, cruelty to animals is a common (but not universal) behavior in children and adolescents who grow up to become serial killers and other violent criminals. It has also been found that children who are cruel to animals have often witnessed or been victims of abuse themselves. In two separate studies cited by the Humane Society of the United States, roughly one-third of families suffering from domestic abuse indicated that at least one child had hurt or killed a pet.

===Sexual abuse===
Animal sexual abuse, or bestiality, occurs when an individual exploits a non-human animal for their own sexual pleasure or for the pleasure of others. Bestiality is strongly associated by many with zoophilia, a paraphilia involving sexual attraction to non-human animals. Over the last few years, there has been a rise of zoophiles advocating for the normalisation of bestiality. One such individual is Douglas Spink, who was convicted of allegedly owning a bestiality farm in which several animals such as dogs, horses and mice were found. Douglas Spink was the previous co-host of a zoophilic podcast under the name of Zooier than Thou. The podcast aims to promote a more positive outlook on bestiality in an attempt to normalise the sexual exploitation of animals for the gratification of humans.

===Cultural rituals===
Many times, when Asiatic elephants are captured in Thailand, handlers use a technique known as the training crush, in which &quot;handlers use sleep-deprivation, hunger, and thirst to &#x27;break&#x27; the elephants&#x27; spirit and make them submissive to their owners&quot;; moreover, handlers drive nails into the elephants&#x27; ears and feet.

The practice of cruelty to animals for divination purposes is found in ancient cultures , and some modern religions such as Santeria continue to do animal sacrifices for healing and other rituals. Taghairm was performed by ancient Scots to summon devils.

=== Cruelties in connection with meals ===
According to some news reports, buntings were blinded before cooking. The Homarus crabs is usually cooked alive.

Alfred Brehm wrote the following about the capture of sea turtles in the 19th century:
===Entertainment===
====Television and filmmaking====

Animal cruelty has long been an issue in filmmaking industry, with even some big-budget Hollywood films receiving criticism for allegedly harmful—and sometimes lethal—treatment of animals during production. Court decisions have addressed films that harm animals such as videos that in part depict dog fighting.

The American Humane Association (AHA) has been associated with monitoring American film-making since the release of the film &quot;Jesse James&quot; (1939), in which a horse was pushed off a plank and drowned in a body of water after having fallen 40 feet into it. Initially, monitoring of animal cruelty was a partnership between the AHA and the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America (also called the Hays office) through the Motion Picture Production Code. Provisions in the code discouraged &quot;apparent cruelty to children and animals&quot;, and because the Hays Office had the power to enforce this clause, the AHA often had access to sets to assess adherence to it. However, because the AHA&#x27;s Hollywood office depended on the Hays Office for the right to monitor sets, the closure of the Hays Office in 1966 corresponded with an increase in animal cruelty on movie sets.

By 1977, a three-year contract was in place between the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists which specified that the AHA should be &quot;consulted in the use of animals &#x27;when appropriate&#x27;&quot;, but the contract did not provide a structure for what &quot;appropriate&quot; meant, and had no enforcement powers. This contract expired in 1980.

One of the most infamous examples of animal cruelty in the film was Michael Cimino&#x27;s flop &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980), in which numerous animals were brutalized and even killed during production. Cimino allegedly killed chickens and bled horses from the neck to gather samples of their blood to smear on actors for &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, and also allegedly had a horse blown up with dynamite while shooting a battle sequence, the shot of which made it into the film. This film played a large part in renewed scrutiny of animal cruelty in films and led to renewed official on-set jurisdiction to monitor the treatment of animals by the AHA in 1980.

After the release of the film &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), the star and director of the picture, Warren Beatty apologized for his Spanish film crew&#x27;s use of tripwires on horses while filming a battle scene, when Beatty was not present. Tripwires were used against horses when &quot;Rambo III&quot; (1988) and &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; (1999) were being filmed. A water buffalo was sliced nearly in half during the production of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; (1979), while a donkey was bled to death for dramatic effect for the Danish film &quot;Manderlay&quot; (2005), in a scene later deleted from the film.
There is a case of cruelty to animals in the South Korean film &quot;The Isle&quot; (2000), according to its director Kim Ki-Duk. In the film, a real frog is skinned alive while fish are mutilated. Seven animals were killed for the camera in the controversial Italian film &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; (1980). The images in the film include the slow and graphic beheading and ripping apart of a turtle, a monkey being beheaded and its brains being consumed by natives and a spider being chopped apart. &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was only one film in a collective of similarly themed movies (cannibal films) that featured unstaged animal cruelty. Their influences were rooted in the films of Mondo filmmakers, which sometimes contained similar content. In several countries, &quot;Cannibal Holocaust&quot; was banned or allowed for release with most of the animal cruelty edited out.

Other examples: In the film &quot;Malèna&quot; (2000), the young boys burn ants with the sun&#x27;s rays. In the movie &quot;A Real Young Girl&quot; (1976), the heroine tears apart an earthworm. In &quot;Anatomy of Hell&quot; (2004), a little boy tramples a small remnant (real footage?). The female protagonist of The Onedin Line-series kills a fly with a book (S07E08). In the Hungarian &quot;Sons of the Stone-Hearted Man&quot; (1965), young wolves were actually killed for the sake of the film. In the Hungarian Judit Elek&#x27;s film &quot;Memories of a River&quot; (1990), 14 sheep were burned alive. On the set of Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s film &quot;The Ashes&quot; (1965), allegedly killed a horse.

The SAG has contracted with the AHA for monitoring animal use during filming or while on the set. Compliance with this arrangement is voluntary and only applies to films made in the United States. Films monitored by the American Humane Association may bear one of their end-credit messages. Many productions, including those made in the United States, do not advise AHA or SAG of animal use in films, so there is no oversight.

Some other animal welfare organizations worldwide, such as the Animal Anti-Cruelty League in South Africa, have also monitored the use of animals in the film.

====Internet videos====
Cruelty to animals has often been filmed on video and uploaded to social media websites or private Internet groups. This may involve large-scale, systematic operations; a notable example of this was a global monkey torture ring uncovered by the BBC in June 2023, where participants would produce and distribute videos of monkeys being hurt and killed. Individuals who have published animal cruelty content include Luka Magnotta, a Canadian murderer who uploaded YouTube videos of himself torturing and killing cats; Rubén Marrero Pernas, a man in Cuba who was found to be raping, torturing then killing dogs and recording the acts online for an audience; and Leighton Labute, a Canadian man who was arrested in 2020 for torturing and killing three hamsters, and uploading the video to social media.

The video-sharing site YouTube has been criticized for hosting thousands of videos of real-life animal cruelty, especially the feeding of one animal to another for entertainment and spectacle. Although some of these videos have been flagged as inappropriate by users, YouTube has generally declined to remove them, unlike videos that include copyright infringement. In 2021, YouTube banned staged animal rescue videos, where animals were purposely put in danger before being saved.

====Circuses====

The use of animals in the circus has been controversial since animal welfare groups have documented instances of animal cruelty during the training of performing animals. Animal abuse in circuses has been documented such as keeping them in small enclosures, lack of veterinary care, abusive training methods, and lack of oversight by regulating bodies. Animal trainers have argued that some criticism is not based on fact, including beliefs that shouting makes the animals believe the trainer is going to hurt them, that caging is cruel and common, and that the use of whips, chains or training harms animals.

Bolivia has enacted what animal rights activists called the world&#x27;s first ban on all animals in circuses.

====Animal fighting====

Bullfighting is criticized by animal rights or animal welfare activists, referring to it as a cruel or barbaric blood sport in which the bull suffers severe stress and slow, torturous death. Several activist groups undertake anti-bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries. In Spain, opponents of bullfighting are referred to as &quot;anti-taurinos.&quot;

&quot;The Bulletpoint Bullfight&quot; warns that bullfighting is &quot;not for the squeamish&quot;, advising spectators to &quot;be prepared for blood&quot;. It details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse-mounted lancers, the charging by the bull of a blindfolded, armored horse who is &quot;sometimes doped up, and unaware of the proximity of the bull&quot;, the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros, followed by the matador&#x27;s fatal sword thrust. It stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous. It further warns those attending bullfights to &quot;be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down.&quot;

The &quot;Toro Jubilo&quot; or Toro embolado in Soria, Medinaceli, Spain, is a festival associated with animal cruelty. During this festival, balls of pitch are attached to a bull&#x27;s horns and set on fire. The bull is then released into the streets and will run around in pain, often smashing into walls in an attempt to douse the fire as spectators attempt to dodge the animal. The pitch balls can burn for hours, and they burn the bull&#x27;s horns, body, and eyes. The animal rights group PACMA has described the fiesta as &quot;a clear example of animal mistreatment&quot;.

Dog fighting is a sport that turns dogs against one another in a ring or a pit for gambling or the entertainment of the spectators.

====Rattlesnake round-ups====
Rattlesnake round-ups, also known as rattlesnake rodeos, are annual events common in the rural Midwest and Southern United States, where the primary attractions are captured wild rattlesnakes which are sold, displayed, killed for food or animal products (such as snakeskin) or released back into the wild. The largest rattlesnake round-up in the United States is held in Sweetwater, Texas. Held every year since 1958, the event currently attracts approximately 30,000 visitors per year and in 2006 each annual round-up was said to result in the capture of 1% of the state&#x27;s rattlesnake population.
Rattlesnake round-ups became a concern by animal welfare groups and conservationists due to claims of animal cruelty. In response, some round-ups impose catch-size restrictions or releasing captured snakes back into the wild.

===Warfare===
Military animals are creatures that have been employed by humankind for use in warfare. They are a specific application of working animals. Examples include horses, dogs and dolphins. Only recently has the involvement of animals in war been questioned, and practices such as using animals for fighting, as living bombs or for military testing purposes (such as during the Bikini atomic experiments) may now be criticized for being cruel.

Princess Anne, Princess Royal, the patron of the British Animals in War Memorial, stated that animals adapt to what humans want them to do, but that they will not do things that they do not want to, even with training. Animal participation in the human conflict was commemorated in the United Kingdom in 2004 with the erection of the Animals in War Memorial in Hyde Park, London.

In 2008 a video of a US Marine throwing a puppy over a cliff during the Iraq conflict was popularised as an internet phenomenon and attracted widespread criticism of the soldier&#x27;s actions for being an act of cruelty.

===Unnecessary scientific experiments or demonstrations===
Under all three of the conceptual approaches to animal cruelty discussed above, performing unnecessary experiments or demonstrations upon animals that cause them substantial pain or distress may be viewed as cruelty. Due to changes in ethical standards, this type of cruelty tends to be less common today than it used to be in the past. For example, schoolroom demonstrations of oxygen depletion routinely suffocated birds by placing them under a glass cover, and animals were suffocated in the Cave of Dogs to demonstrate the density and toxicity of carbon dioxide to curious travelers on the Grand Tour.

===No pet policies and abandonment===

Many apartment complexes and rental homes institute no-pet policies. No pet policies are a leading cause of animal abandonment, which is considered a crime in many jurisdictions. In many cases, abandoned pets have to be euthanized due to the strain they put on animal shelters and rescue groups. Abandoned animals often become feral or contribute to feral populations. In particular, feral dogs can pose a serious threat to pets, children, and livestock.

In Ontario, Canada, no pet policies are outlawed under the Ontario Landlord and Tenant Act and are considered invalid even when a tenant signs a lease that includes a no pets clause. Similar legislation has also been considered in Manitoba.

===Hunting===

Trophy hunting is largely a recreational activity causing death and injury to a significant number of animals. In poaching the animal is killed and valuable parts such as tusks or bones are collected. Canned hunting refers to the practice of bringing exotic animals as trophies to private land for hunting. Despite being cruel to animals, hunting is practiced in thousands of private properties around the world and is considered a profitable business.

==Laws by country==

Many jurisdictions around the world have enacted statutes that forbid cruelty to some animals but these vary by country and in some cases by the use or practice.

===Africa===
====Egypt====
Egyptian law states that anyone who inhumanely beats or intentionally kills any domesticated animal may be jailed or fined. The Egyptian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was established over a hundred years ago and was instrumental in promoting a 1997 ban on bullfighting in Egypt.

In ancient Egyptian law, the killers of cats or dogs were executed.

==== Nigeria ====
Animal cruelty in Nigeria is prohibited under Section 495 of the Criminal Code (1990). These include, according to 495(1)(a), cruelly beating, kicking, over-loading, infuriating, or terrifying an animal, or allowing this to happen as the owner. Section 495(1)(b) defines failure to act as the willful or unreasonable doing or omission of any act that causes unnecessary suffering (or as the owner, permitting an act that causes unnecessary suffering). This section also prohibits transporting animals in a way that causes unnecessary suffering (c), administering poison (d), performing operations without due care (e), and actions related to animal fighting (f).

====South Africa====
The Animal Protection Act No 71 of 1962 in South Africa covers &quot;farm animals, domestic animals and birds, and wild animals, birds, and reptiles that are in captivity or under the control of humans.&quot;

The Act contains a detailed list of prohibited acts of cruelty including overloading, causing unnecessary suffering due to confinement, chaining or tethering, abandonment, unnecessarily denying food or water, keeping in a dirty or parasitic condition, or failing to provide veterinary assistance. There is also a general provision prohibiting wanton, unreasonable, or negligible commission or omission of acts resulting in unnecessary suffering. The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries for 2013/14 to 2016/17 mentions updating animal protection legislation.

The NSPCA is the largest and oldest animal welfare organization in South Africa that enforces 90% of all animal cruelty cases in the country by means of enforcing the Animals Protection Act.

====South Sudan====
The Criminal Code of South Sudan has laws against the maltreatment of animals. The laws read:

&quot;196. Ill-treatment of Domestic Animal&quot;.
:Whoever cruelly beats, tortures, or otherwise willfully ill-treats any tame, domestic, or wild animal, which has previously been deprived of its liberty, or arranges, promotes, or organizes fights between cocks, rams, bulls, or other domestic animals or encourages such acts, commits an offense, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months or with a fine.
&quot;197. Riding and Neglect of Animal&quot;.
:Whoever wantonly rides, overdrives, or overloads any animal or intentionally drugs or employs any animal, which by reason of age, sickness, wounds or infirmity is not in a condition to work, or neglects any animal in such a manner as to cause it unnecessary suffering, commits an offense, and upon conviction, shall be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one month or with a fine or with both.

===Americas===
====Argentina====
In Argentina, National Law 14346 sanctions from 15 days to one year in prison for those who mistreat or inflict acts of cruelty on animals.

==== Brazil ====

Brazil is a high-volume animal producer, slaughtering around 30.8 land-based animals per person per year, compared to a global average of 10.1. The country&#x27;s dependency on farmed animals is relatively high, with around 8 farmed animals per person, double the global average of 4.1.
A 1998 law prohibits the abuse of domestic and wild animals. It imposes more serious penalties for cruelty than the 1934 decree, with a sentence of 3 months to a year plus a fine, with the penalty increased by one-sixth to one-third of the animal is killed.

====Canada====
In Canada, it is an offense under the Criminal Code to intentionally cause unnecessary pain, suffering, or injury to an animal. Poisoning animals is specifically prohibited. It is also an offense to threaten to harm an animal belonging to someone else. Most provinces and territories also have animal protection legislation. However, it is not explicitly illegal in Canadian law to kill a dog or cat for consumption.

The Animal Legal Defense Fund releases an annual report ranking the animal protection laws of every province and territory based on their relative strength and general comprehensiveness. In 2014, the strongest four jurisdictions were Manitoba, British Columbia, Ontario, and Nova Scotia. The weakest four were Saskatchewan, Northwest Territories, Quebec, and Nunavut.

====Chile====
Law 20380 established sanctions including fines, from 2 to 30 Mensual Tributary Units, and prison, from 541 days to 3 years, for those involved in acts of animal cruelty. Also, it facilitates animal care through school education and establishes a Bioethics Committee to define policies related to experiments with animals.

====Colombia====
In Colombia, there is little control over cruel behaviors against animals, and the government has proposed that bullfighting be declared a &quot;Cultural Heritage&quot;; other activities like cockfighting are given the same legal treatment.

==== Costa Rica ====

In 2017, after many years of legal wrangling, Costa Rica passed their Animal Welfare Law. It includes prison sentences of three months to one year for harming or killing a domesticated animal or for conducting animal fights. There are monetary fines for those who mistreat, neglect or abandon animals, for breeding or training animals for fighting, or for violating regulations on animal experimentation. The law does not cover agricultural practices, aquaculture, zootechnical or veterinary activities, killing of animals for consumption, for sanitary or scientific reasons, or reproductive control. Wild animals are covered under the Wild Life Act.

The bill had stalled its motion through the legislature until an injured toucan was found which had lost the top half of its beak. News and images of the injured bird, now named Grecia, raised enough contributions to create a 3D printed prosthesis for her, and helped spur the bill&#x27;s progress.

====Mexico====
The current policy of Mexico, in civil law, condemns physical harm to animals as property damage to the owners of the abused animal, considering the animals as owned property.

In criminal law, the situation is different. In December 2012, the Legislative Assembly of the Federal District reformed the existing Penal Code of Mexico City, establishing abuse and cruelty to animals as criminal offenses, provided the animals are not deemed to be plagues or pests. Abandoned animals are not considered to be plagues. A subsequent reform was entered into force on 31 January 2013, by a decree published in the Official Gazette of the Federal District. The law provides penalties of six months to two years imprisonment, and a fine of 50 to 100 days at minimum wage, to persons who cause obvious injury to an animal, and the penalty is increased by one-half of those injuries endanger its life. The penalty rises to two to four years of prison, and a fine of 200 to 400 days at minimum wage, if the person intentionally causes the death of an animal.

This law is considered to extend throughout the rest of the 31 constituent states of the country. In addition, The Law of Animal Protection of the Federal District is wide-ranging, based on banning &quot;unnecessary suffering&quot;. Similar laws now exist in most states.

====United States====
The primary federal law relating to animal care and conditions in the US is the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, amended in 1970, 1976, 1985, 1990, 2002, and 2007. It is the only Federal law in the United States that regulates the treatment of animals in research, exhibition, transport, and by dealers. Other laws, policies, and guidelines may include additional species coverage or specifications for animal care and use, but all refer to the Animal Welfare Act as the minimum acceptable standard.

The Animal Legal Defense Fund releases an annual report ranking the animal protection laws of every state based on their relative strength and general comprehensiveness. In a 2013&#x27;s report, the top five states for their strong anti-cruelty laws were Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Oregon, and California. The five states with the weakest animal cruelty laws in 2013 were Kentucky, Iowa, South Dakota, New Mexico, and Wyoming.

In Massachusetts and New York, agents of humane societies and associations may be appointed as special officers to enforce statutes outlawing animal cruelty.

In 2004, a Florida legislator proposed a ban on &quot;cruelty to bovines&quot;, stating: &quot;A person who, for practice, entertainment, or sport, intentionally fells, trips, or otherwise causes a cow to fall or lose its balance using roping, lassoing, dragging, or otherwise touching the tail of the cow commits a misdemeanor of the first degree.&quot; The proposal did not become law.

In the United States, ear cropping, tail docking, rodeo sports, and other acts are legal and sometimes condoned. Penalties for cruelty can be minimal if pursued. Currently, 46 of the 50 states have enacted felony penalties for certain forms of animal abuse. However, in most jurisdictions, animal cruelty is most commonly charged as a misdemeanor offense. In one recent California case, a felony conviction for animal cruelty could theoretically net a 25-year to a life sentence due to their three-strikes law, which increases sentences based on prior felony convictions.

In 2003, West Hollywood, California, passed an ordinance banning declawing of house cats. In 2007, Norfolk, Virginia passed legislation only allowing the procedure for medical reasons. However, most jurisdictions allow the procedure.

In April 2013, Texas Federal Court Judge Sim Lake ruled that the Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010, which criminalized the recording, sale, and transport of videos depicting animal cruelty as obscenity, violates the First Amendment. Judge Lake noted that obscenity tests require an explicitly sexual depiction, which the criminalized videos lack. This follows the precedent set by &quot;United States v. Stevens&quot;, which additionally held that restrictions on the possession of animal cruelty videos were unconstitutional.

In November 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Preventing Animal Cruelty and Torture Act, making certain intentional acts of cruelty to animals federal crimes carrying penalties of up to seven years in prison. The Act expanded upon the 2010 Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act signed by President Barack Obama that banned the creation and distribution of videos that showed animals being crushed, burned, drowned, suffocated, impaled, or subjected to other forms of torture. The underlying acts, which were not included in the 2010 bill, are part of the PACT Act and are now felony offenses. The bill was unanimously passed in both the House and Senate.

=====State welfare laws=====
Several states have enacted or considered laws in support of humane farming.
* On 5 November 2002, Florida voters passed Amendment 10 by a margin of 55%, amending the Florida Constitution to ban the confinement of pregnant pigs in gestation crates.
* On 14 January 2004, the bill AB-732 died in the California Assembly&#x27;s Agriculture Committee. The bill would have banned gestation and veal crates, eventually being amended to include only veal crates. On 9 May 2007, the bill AB-594 was withdrawn from the California State Assembly. The bill had been effectively killed in the Assembly Agriculture Committee, by replacing the contents of the bill with language concerning tobacco cessation coverage under Medi-Cal. AB-594 was very similar to the current language of Proposition 2.
* On 7 November 2006, Arizona voters passed Proposition 204 with 62% support. The measure prohibits the confinement of calves in veal crates and breeding sows in gestation crates.
* On 28 June 2007, Oregon Governor Ted Kulongoski signed a measure into law prohibiting the confinement of pigs in gestation crates (SB 694, 74th Leg. Assembly, Regular Session).
* In January 2008, Nebraska State Senate bill LB 1148, to ban the use of gestation crates for pig farmers, was withdrawn within five days amidst controversy.
* On 14 May 2008, Colorado Governor Bill Ritter signed into law a bill, SB 201, that phases out gestation crates and veal crates.

====Venezuela====
Venezuela published a &quot;Law for Protection of Domestic Fauna free and in captivity&quot; in 2010, defining responsibilities and sanctions regarding animal care and ownership. Animal cruelty acts are fined, but are not a cause for imprisonment. The law also forbids the possession, breeding, and reproduction of pit bull dogs, among similar breeds that are alleged to be aggressive and dangerous. It elicited reactions from dog owners, who said that aggressiveness in dogs is determined more by treatment by the owner than by the breed itself.

=== Asia ===
====Israel====
Israel banned the sale of fur to the fashion industry in June 2021, being the first country in the world to do so.

====China====
As of the year 2006, there were no laws in China governing acts of cruelty to animals. There are no government-supported charitable organizations like the RSPCA, which monitors the cases of animal cruelty. All kinds of animal abuses, such as to fish, tigers, and bears, are to be reported to law enforcement and animal welfare.

In the absence of a unified law against animal mistreatment, the World Animal Protection notes that some legislation protecting the welfare of animals exists in certain contexts, especially ones used in research and zoos.

In September 2009, legislation was drafted to address deliberate cruelty to animals in China. If passed, the legislation would offer some protection to pets, captive wildlife, and animals used in laboratories, as well as regulate how farm animals are raised, transported, and slaughtered.

In 2008, the People&#x27;s Republic of China was in the process of making changes to its stray-dog population laws in the capital city, Beijing. Mr. Zheng Gang who is the director of the Internal and Judicial Committee which comes under the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Congress (BMPC), supported the draft of the Beijing Municipal Regulation on Dogs from the local government. The law would replace the Beijing Municipal Regulation on Dog Ownership, introduced in 1989. The extant regulation talked of &quot;strictly&quot; limiting dog ownership and controlling the number of dogs in the city. The proposed draft focused instead on &quot;strict management and combining restrictions with management.&quot;

====Hong Kong====
As of 2010, Hong Kong has supplemented or replaced the laws against cruelty with a positive approach using laws that specify how animals should be treated.
The government department primarily responsible for animal welfare in Hong Kong is the Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD).

Laws enforced by the AFCD include these:
* the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance (also enforced by the police)
* the Public Health (Animals and Birds) Ordinance (including regulations for licenses imposed on livestock keepers and animal traders and a Code of Standards for Licensed Animal Traders)
* the Dogs and Cats Ordinance
* the Pounds Ordinance
* the Rabies Ordinance
* the Wild Animals Protection Ordinance
In addition, the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) does the following:
* enforces the Public Health and Municipal Services Ordinance, which includes regulations for slaughterhouses and wet markets
* publishes a Code of Practice for the Welfare of Food Animals (which describes their transport)
* publishes Operational Guidelines for the Welfare of Food Animals at Slaughterhouses
The Department of Health does the following:
* enforces the Animals (Control of Experiments) Ordinance.
* publishes a Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Experimental Purposes

As of 2006, Hong Kong has a law titled &quot;Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Ordinance&quot;, with maximum of 3-year imprisonment and fines of HKD$200,000.

====India====

The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960 was amended in the year 1982.
According to the newly amended &quot;Indian animal welfare act, 2011&quot; cruelty to animals is an offense and is punishable with a fine which shall not be less than ten thousand Rupees, which may extend to twenty-five thousand rupees or with imprisonment up to two years or both in the case of a first offense. In the case of a second or subsequent offense, with a fine which shall not be less than fifty thousand Rupees, but may extend to one lakh Rupees and with imprisonment with a term which shall not be less than one year but may extend to three years. This amendment is currently awaiting ratification from the Government of India. The 1962 Act is the one that is practiced as of now. The maximum penalty under the 1962 Act is Rs. 50 (under $1).
Many organizations, including ones such as the local SPCA, PF, A, and Fosterdopt are actively involved in assisting the general population in reporting cruelty cases to the police and helping bring the perpetrator to justice. Due to this, much change has been observed in the subcontinent. In 2022, A provision of a maximum of five-year imprisonment with a minimum 75 thousand rupees fine for killing an animal has been made. The draft Bill also suggests five freedoms of animals including freedom from thirst, hunger and malnutrition and from fear and distress, under Section 3A.

====Iran====
Iranian government sponsored a law banning pets, breeding, selling, walking and keeping in the cities also including Najis animals/birds. Animals lives and wellbeing are to some limited extent protected under Islamic criminal code and feqh. Filming animal abuse is illegal. Euthanasia is haram.

====Japan====
In Japan, the 1973 Welfare and Management of Animals Act (amended in 1999 and 2005) stipulates that &quot;no person shall kill, injure, or inflict cruelty to animals without a due course&quot;, and in particular, criminalizes cruelty to all mammals, birds, and reptiles possessed by persons; as well as cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, dogs, cats, pigeons, domestic rabbits, chickens, and domestic ducks regardless of whether they are in captivity.
* Killing or injuring without due reason: up to one year&#x27;s imprisonment with labor or a fine of up to one million yen
* Cruelty such as causing debilitation by discontinuing feeding or watering without due reason: a fine of up to five hundred thousand yen
* Abandonment: a fine of up to five hundred thousand yen

Separate national and local ordinances exist about ensuring the health and safety of animals handled by pet shops and other businesses.

Animal experiments are regulated by the 2000 Law for the Humane Treatment and Management of Animals, which was amended in 2006. This law requires those using animals to follow the principles outlined in the 3Rs, which are listed as replacement, reduction, and refinement, to use as few animals as possible, and cause minimal distress and suffering. Regulation is at a local level based on national guidelines, but there are no governmental inspections of institutions and no reporting requirement for the numbers of animals used.

==== Malaysia ====

Cruelty towards animals protected under the Animal Welfare Act (2015) is punishable by a fine of 20–100,000 ringgit and/or imprisonment of up to three years. Cruelty towards animals protected under the Wildlife Conservation Act (2010) is punishable by a fine of 5–50,000 ringgit and/or up to one-year imprisonment.
Under the AA, a person commits an offense of animal cruelty if they &quot;cruelly beats, kicks, ill-treats, overrides, overdrives, overloads, tortures, infuriates or terrifies any animal.

====Saudi Arabia====
Veterinarian Lana Dunn and several Saudi nationals report that there are no laws to protect animals from cruelty since the term is not well-defined within the Saudi legal system. They point to a lack of a governing body to supervise conditions for animals, particularly in pet stores and in the exotic animal trade with East Africa.

==== South Korea ====
South Korea&#x27;s animal welfare laws are weak by international standards.
South Korea&#x27;s animal protection law states that anyone who abuses or is cruel to animals may be sentenced to a maximum of three years in prison or fined 30 million won ($25,494), but the standards to decide penalties have been low as the animals are treated as objects under the current legal system, Choung said.

====Taiwan====
The Taiwanese Animal Protection Act was passed in 1998, imposing fines of up to NT$250,000 for cruelty. Criminal penalties for animal cruelty were enacted in 2009
, including a maximum of one-year imprisonment.

==== Thailand ====
Thailand introduced its first animal welfare law in 2014. The &quot;Cruelty Prevention and Welfare of Animal Act, B.E. 2557 (2014)&quot; came into being on 27 December 2014.

===Europe===
====European Union====
The European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC is a directive passed by the European Union on the minimum standards for keeping egg laying hens which effectively bans conventional battery cages. The directive passed in 1999, banned conventional battery cages in the EU from 1 January 2012 after a 13-year phase-out.

It is also illegal in many parts of Europe to declaw a cat.

====France====
In France, cruelty to animals is punishable by imprisonment of two years and a financial penalty (€30,000).

====Germany====

In Germany, killing animals or causing significant pain (or prolonged or repeated pain) to them is punishable by imprisonment of up to three years or a financial penalty.
If the animal is of foreign origin, the act may also be punishable as criminal damage.

====Italy====
Acts of cruelty against animals can be punished with imprisonment, for a minimum of three months up to a maximum of three years, and with a fine ranging from a minimum of 3,000 Euros to a maximum of 160,000 Euros, as for the law n°189/2004.

====Ireland====
The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 came into force in 2014, improving animal protection. The maximum penalty is up to €250,000 and up to five years in prison. Sentences of up to three years have been imposed in several cases.

====Portugal====
Since 1 October 2014, violence against animals has been a crime in Portugal. Legislation published in the &quot;Diário da República&quot; on 29 August criminalizes the mistreatment of animals and indicates that &quot;those who, without reasonable cause, inflict pain, suffering, or any other hardship to a companion animal abuse&quot; are to be subject to imprisonment of up to one year. If such acts result in the &quot;death of the animal&quot;, the &quot;deprivation of an important organ or member&quot;, or &quot;serious and permanent impairment of its capacity of locomotion&quot;, those responsible will be punished by imprisonment up to two years.

As for pets, the new law provides that &quot;whoever, having the duty to store, monitor or pet watch, abandons them, thereby putting in danger their food and the provision of care owed&quot; faces up to six months imprisonment.

====Sweden====
In Sweden cruelty to animals is punishable by a financial penalty and prison for up to two years. The owner will lose the right to own animals and the animals will be removed from the owner.

====Switzerland====
The Swiss animal protection laws are among the strictest in the world, comprehensively regulating the treatment of animals including the size of rabbit cages, and the amount of exercise that must be provided to dogs.

In the canton of Zurich an animal lawyer, Antoine Goetschel, is employed by the canton government to represent the interests of animals in animal cruelty cases.

====Turkey====
Under Turkey&#x27;s Animal Protection Law No. 5199, cruelty to animals is considered a criminal offense, punishable by up to four years in prison. In July 2021, Turkey banned the opening of circuses which use animals, and dolphinariums. Existing facilities will cease operations in ten years. HAYTAP, the Animal Rights Federation in Turkey, used to believe that the previous law did not contain a strong enough punishment for animal abusers. In 2024, a cruelty to animals case caused widespread outrage in social media in Turkey. Eros, a cat kept in a housing complex in Küçükçekmece, Istanbul, was tortured to death by İbrahim Keloğlan on January 1 in the early morning. The moments when Keloğlan tortured Eros to death were recorded by the security cameras of the site. Keloğlan was released with a good behavior discount at the first hearing of the case held on February 8 at the Küçükçekmece 16th Criminal Court of First Instance. A campaign was launched on social media against Keloğlan, who was given a good behavior discount, saying &quot;Let İbrahim Keloğlan be arrested&quot;.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, cruelty to animals is a criminal offense for which one may be jailed for up to 6 months.

On 18 August 1911, the House of Commons introduced the Protection of Animals Act 1911 (c.27) following lobbying by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). The maximum punishment was six months of &quot;hard labor&quot; with a fine of 25 pounds.

In the Metropolitan Police Act 1839 &quot;fighting or baiting Lions, Bears, Badgers, Cocks, Dogs, or other Animals&quot; was prohibited in London, with a penalty of up to one-month imprisonment, with possible hard labor, or up to five pounds. The law laid numerous restrictions on how, when, and where animals could be driven, wagons unloaded, etc. It also prohibited owners from letting mad dogs run loose and gave police the right to destroy any dog suspected of being rabid or any dog bitten by a suspected rabid dog. The same law prohibited the use of dogs for drawing carts.

Up until then, dogs were used for delivering milk, bread, fish, meat, fruit, vegetables, animal food (the cat&#x27;s-meat man), and other items for sale and for collecting refuse (the rag-and-bone man). As Nigel Rothfels notes the prohibition against dogs pulling carts in or near London caused most of the dogs to be killed by their owners as they went from being contributors to the family income to unaffordable expenses. Cart dogs were replaced by people with handcarts. About 150,000 dogs were killed or abandoned. Erica Fudge quotes Hilda Kean: 
The Protection of Animals Act 1911 extended the ban on draft dogs to the rest of the kingdom. As many as 600,000 dogs were killed or abandoned.

The Protection of Animals Act 1911 has since been largely superseded by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, which also superseded and consolidated more than 20 other pieces of legislation, including the Protection of Animals Act 1934 and the Abandonment of Animals Act 1960. The Act introduced a new welfare offense, which means that animal owners have a positive duty of care, and outlaws neglect to provide for their animals&#x27; basic needs, such as access to adequate nutrition and veterinary care.

Under the Criminal Damage Act 1971, domestic animals can be classed as property that is capable of being &quot;damaged or destroyed&quot;. A charge of criminal damage may be appropriate for the injury or death of an animal owned by someone other than the defendant, and prosecution under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 may also be appropriate.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, all states and territories have enacted legislation governing animal welfare. The legislation is:
* Animal Welfare Act 1992 (ACT)
* Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1979 (NSW)
* Animal Welfare Act (NT)
* Animal Care and Protection Act 2001 (Qld)
* Animal Welfare Act 1985 (SA)
* Animal Welfare Act 1993 (Tas)
* Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1986 (Vic)
* Animal Welfare Act 2002 (WA)

Welfare laws have been criticized as not adequately protecting animals. Whilst police maintain an overall jurisdiction in the prosecution of criminal matters, in many states officers of the RSPCA and other animal welfare charities are accorded authority to investigate and prosecute animal cruelty offenses.

====New Zealand====

The Animal Welfare Act 1999 protects animals from maltreatment.

<text>A motion for more definite statement in many jurisdictions in the United States, and under United States federal law, is a means of obtaining a more detailed motion from the opposing party in a civil case before interposing a responsive pleading.

In federal jurisprudence, the motion is permitted by Rule 12(e) of The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The presiding judge will respond either by granting the motion or striking it from the record if it is found to be without legal merit. The motion must contain a point-by-point rebuttal, with each point numbered, and ideally should reference some case law in support of the motion.

In the Commonwealth of Virginia, a motion seeking such relief is called a motion for a bill of particulars.

<text>Pomace ( ), or marc (; from French &quot;marc&quot; ), is the solid remains of grapes, olives, or other fruit after pressing for juice or oil. It contains the skins, pulp, seeds, and stems of the fruit.

Grape pomace has traditionally been used to produce pomace brandy (such as grappa, orujo, törkölypálinka, tsipouro, tsikoudia, zivania). Today, it is mostly used as fodder, as fertilizer, or for the extraction of bioactive compounds like polyphenols.
==Name==
The English word &quot;&quot; derives from Medieval Latin (&quot;cider&quot;) and (&quot;pomaceous, appley&quot;), from Classical Latin (&quot;fruit, apple&quot;). The word was originally used for cider and only later applied to the apple mash before or after pressing, via various cognate terms in northern French dialects, before being used for such byproducts more generally.

==History==
The ancient Greeks and Romans used grape pomace to create an inferior class of wine given to slaves and laborers. The grapes were first pressed twice and the resulting pomace was then soaked in water for another day and pressed a third time and fermented. The resulting liquid produced a thin, weak, and thirst-quenching wine with an alcohol content around 3 or 4%, now known as piquette in English and French and as or in Italian. Piquette was also widely available during the Middle Ages. As medieval wines were not usually fermented to dryness, medieval piquette retained a degree of residual sugar.

Pomace from various sourcesparticularly fish and castor beanswas also used in the early modern period for fertilizer.

=== Olive pomace ===
Olive pomace, the byproduct of olive oil extraction, was widely used throughout classical antiquity as an alternative fuel source to wood and charcoal. Use of olive pomace peaked in the Roman era, when, due to urban growth and proto-industrial activity, markets for imported olive pomace developed. Olive pomace may be sun-dried or made into charcoal for use as fuel.

==Uses==

Apple pomace is often used to produce pectin and can be used to make ciderkin, a weak cider, as well as white cider, a strong and colourless alcoholic drink.

===Distilling===

Grape pomace is used to produce pomace brandy and piquette. Most wine-producing cultures began making some type of pomace brandy after the principles of distillation were understood.

===Winemaking===

Pomace in winemaking differs, depending upon whether white wine or red wine is being produced.

In red wine production, pomace is produced after the free run juice (the juice created before pressing by the weight of gravity) is poured off, leaving behind dark blackish-red pomace consisting of grape skins and stems. The color of red wine is derived from skin contact during the maceration period, which sometimes includes partial fermentation. The resulting pomace is more alcoholic and tannic than pomace produced from white wine production. Pomace from the Italian wine Amarone is macerated in Valpolicella wine to produce Ripasso.

In white wine production, grapes are separated from their skins, then pressed to obtain juice. The skin pomace is a pale, greenish-brown color, and contains residual sugars and tannins. This pomace is used in brandy production.

===Other uses===
Pomace is produced in large quantities in wine production, making its disposal an important environmental consideration. Some wineries use the material as fertilizer, while others are selling it to biogas companies for renewable energy. As envisioned, pomace would be introduced into anaerobic digesters that contain microorganisms that aid in its decomposition and produce methane gas that could be burnt to generate power.

Specific polyphenols in red wine pomace may be beneficial for dental hygiene. A study conducted at the Eastman Dental Center found that these polyphenols interfere with &quot;Streptococcus mutans&quot;, the bacterium in the mouth that causes tooth decay. Professor Hyun Koo, the lead researcher of the study, hoped as of 2008 to isolate these polyphenols to produce new mouthwashes that will help protect against cavities.

Grape pomace is also used in the oil and gas industry as a lost circulation material in oil-based drilling muds due to the pomace being fibrous and tannin-rich.

A 2004 study conducted by Erciyes University in Turkey found that pomace can also act as a natural food preservative that interferes with &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; bacteria. Researchers pulverised the dried pomace from the white Turkish wine grape Emir Karasi and red Kalecik Karasi grapes; this was mixed with ethyl acetate, methanol or water and exposed to 14 different types of food bacteria. All 14 bacteria were inhibited to some degree by the pomace – depending on the grape variety and the concentration of the extract. The red wine Kalecik Karasi grape was the most effective; the researchers believed this was due to the higher concentration of polyphenols in red wine grape skins.

Oenocyanin, a natural red dye and food-coloring agent, is produced from grape pomace. Tartrates (potassium bitartrate, &#x27;cream of tartar&#x27;) and grape polyphenols can also be manufactured from grape pomace.

Apple pomace has long been a traditional feed for various kinds of livestock. The use of grape pomace as livestock feed is encouraged in order to reduce the release of grape processing residues in the environment, which can lead to serious pollution.

Apple pomace was used, in conjunction with whey, to flavor the first iteration of Fanta soft drink in Germany during World War II. This was done because wartime embargoes limited Coca-Cola of Germany&#x27;s ability to import and manufacture the American beverage.

Apple pomace can also be milled in order to create apple flour, also known as apple pomace flour.

Pomace was once used as an ingredient in some paints, but today such use is limited to artisanal paints in such applications as fine arts or architectural restoration, whereas for industrial and commercial paints it is now superfluous petrochemically.

==Legal regulations==
===Canada===
According to the Canadian &quot;Food and Drug Regulations&quot;, pomace can be a potable alcoholic distillate or a mixture of potable alcoholic distillates obtained by distilled skin and pulp of sound ripe fruit after removal of the fruit juice, wine or fruit wine. Pomace may contain caramel, fruit, botanical substances, flavoring and flavoring preparations. Pomace may be described on its label as &quot;(name of the fruit) Pomace&quot; or &quot;(name of the fruit) Marc&quot; if all of the skin and pulp of the fruit used to make the pomace originate from the particular fruit.

<doc id="683097" wikidata="Q638485" url="?curid=683097" title="Grime's Graves">
<text>Grime&#x27;s Graves is a large Neolithic flint mining complex in Norfolk, England. It lies north east from Brandon, Suffolk in the East of England. It was worked between  2600 and  2300 BCE, although production may have continued through the Bronze and Iron Ages and later, owing to the low cost of flint compared with metals. Flint was much in demand for making polished stone axes in the Neolithic period. Much later, when flint had been replaced by metal tools, flint nodules were in demand for other uses, such as for building and as strikers for muskets.

Grime&#x27;s Graves was first extensively explored by the 19th-century archaeologist William Greenwell.

The scheduled monument extends over an area of some and consists of at least 433 shafts dug into the natural chalk to reach seams of flint. The largest shafts are more than deep and in diameter at the surface. It has been calculated that more than 2,000 tonnes of chalk had to be removed from the larger shafts, taking 20 men around five months, before stone of sufficient quality was reached. An upper &#x27;topstone&#x27; and middle &#x27;wallstone&#x27; seam of flint was dug through on the way to the deeper third &#x27;floorstone&#x27; seam which most interested the miners. The site is managed by English Heritage and can be visited.

The site is also a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Geological Conservation Review site. It is part of the Breckland Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area.

==Mining method==

In order to remove the chalk efficiently, the ancient miners built wooden platforms and ladders as they dug downwards and piled the spoil around the shaft opening using turf revetments to hold it in place for the season, after which the shaft and all its galleries were thoroughly and fastidiously backfilled to promote stability. The landscape around Grime&#x27;s Graves has a characteristic pockmarked appearance caused by the infilled shafts. This is probably what inspired the later Anglo-Saxon inhabitants of the area to name it after their god Grim (literally the masked, or hooded one, a euphemism for Woden). Although the pagan Anglo-Saxons seem to have had some idea of what the site was, as the name of the site means literally &quot;the masked one&#x27;s quarries&quot; (or Grim&#x27;s Graben), it was not until Canon William Greenwell excavated one of the shafts in 1868–1870 that their purpose was discovered in modern times. Similar sites have been found elsewhere in Europe, such as Cissbury in West Sussex, Krzemionki in Poland, and Spiennes in Belgium.

===Tools===

The miners used picks fashioned from the antler of red deer. They probably used wooden shovels, although this is only inferred by analogy with other flint mines with better conditions for the preservation of artefacts. Analysis of the antlers (Clutton-Brock 1984: 25) has shown that the miners were mainly right-handed and favoured the left antlers out of those that were naturally shed seasonally by the deer. The 28 pits excavated up to 2008 yielded an average of 142.5 antler picks each, of which an average of 14.8 have been found to be left-handed.

Once they had reached the floorstone flint, the miners dug lateral galleries outwards from the bottom, following the flint seam. The medium-depth shafts yielded as much as 60 tons of flint nodules, which were brought to the surface and roughly worked into shape on site. The blank tools were then possibly traded elsewhere for final polishing. It is estimated that 60 tons of flint could have produced as many as 10,000 of the polished stone axes, which were the mines&#x27; main product. Extrapolation across the site suggests that Grime&#x27;s Graves may have produced around 16–18,000 tonnes of flint across the 433 shafts recorded to date. However, there are large areas of the site covered by later activity which are believed to conceal many more mineshafts.

There were other hard stones used for axe manufacture, those of the Langdale axe industry and Penmaenmawr in North Wales being traded across Europe, as well as other less well-known igneous and metamorphic rocks. The axes were much in demand for forest clearance and settlement, development of farmland for arable crops and raising animals, which characterises the Neolithic period.

===Customs and beliefs ===

One unproductive shaft (pit 15) appears to have been turned into a shrine. An altar of flint lumps had been built with a chalk bowl at its base and antler picks piled around. In front of the altar had been placed a Venus figurine of chalk, a chalk phallus and some balls, also of chalk. It may have been an attempt to ensure that the mine remained productive or &#x27;fertile&#x27; after this particular shaft turned out to have little flint in it. However, it is possible that the Venus figurine and the phallus are modern fakes – there is a lack of primary evidence surrounding their recovery in 1939, and rumours circulated at the time of the excavation that they were planted in order to deceive Leslie Armstrong, the archaeologist overseeing the dig.

===Neolithic infrastructure===

Such a large industry may have required supporting infrastructure. Assuming no more than two shafts were open at any one time, around 120 red deer may have needed to be bred and managed nearby, in order to provide a steady supply of antler as well as skin, food and other products that the miners would require. Alternatively, the mines may have been worked intermittently by local farmers, as happened in many early metal mines during the Bronze Age and the later Iron Age.

Earlier flint mines in Britain, such as Cissbury in West Sussex, were just as important as Grime&#x27;s Graves, and there were many very local sources of flint which were exploited on the downlands. However, it is probably relevant that Grime&#x27;s Graves were close to the very rich soils of the Fens, and forest clearance here would rely on local products.

There was also extensive farming settlement during the Bronze Age, known from middens that infill the mouths of many Neolithic mineshafts. Animal bones from these middens show that the Bronze Age people kept cattle, which they milked, sheep and a few pigs. They also grew barley, wheat and peas.

==Modern history==
Grime&#x27;s Graves was first extensively explored by the archaeologist William Greenwell in 1868. The function of the holes in the ground around it was not known in the time between the mine&#x27;s abandonment and his exploration of it. An 18th-century priest suggested that the holes were left by Vikings, and an amateur archeologist suggested a century later that they were the remains of a fortress of the Celts.

===The site today===
Grime&#x27;s Graves is in the care of English Heritage. It is open to the public and it is possible to descend a ladder and explore one of the shafts. There is a small exhibition area. This is the only shaft of its kind open to the public in Britain.

====Publications====
The full English Heritage reports on the excavations at Grime&#x27;s Graves in 1971–72 are now available online through the Archaeology Data Service. Doctor Philip Harding FSA, later to appear in the TV programme &quot;Time Team&quot;, dug the site each summer from 1972 to 1976.

<doc id="683099" wikidata="Q331059" url="?curid=683099" title="James Tillis">
<text>James Tillis (born July 5, 1957) is an American former professional boxer and actor. Known as &quot;Quick&quot;, he was known for his remarkably fast hand speed for a man of his size and build. A natural southpaw, Tillis turned around to orthodox midway in his amateur career. His left remained the stronger hand and for that reason, he had a powerful jab and left hook, together with the ability to switch stances while fighting. Tillis challenged for the WBA world heavyweight title in 1981, but was defeated in a fifteen-round unanimous decision fight against Mike Weaver. Tillis was the first man to go the distance with Mike Tyson in 1986, breaking his knockout-streak and giving him a relatively close fight, nearly a draw, with two of three judges scoring the fight . (in the words of &quot;Hall of Fame&#x27;s&quot; Gil Clancy, Tillis was &quot;one punch&quot; away from victory.) He holds notable wins over Ron Stander by TKO in the 7th round in 1980, and the hard punching Earnie Shavers by ten-round decision in 1982. Tillis fought for the last time in 2001 at the age of 44.

==Early years==
A native of Tulsa, Oklahoma, he was the firstborn son of James Tillis and wife Rose. Tillis attended Mclain High School and grew up in a very religious southern family, with an alcoholic father and a deeply religious mother. His mother would later join First Baptist Mohawk Church under the leadership of Pastor Clint Simmons. He dreamed about being a professional prize fighter and was given the nickname &quot;Quick&quot; by his first cousin Keith Reed.

==Amateur career==
&quot;Quick&quot; was influenced to begin training to become a boxer after he listened to the 1964 bout between Muhammad Ali and Sonny Liston on the radio. He enlisted the help of noted trainer Ed Duncan, by becoming involved in the sport at the O&#x27;Brien Park recreation center in north Tulsa. Tillis&#x27; amateur record of 92–8 led to his being considered for the United States Olympic team. Due to an illness, he was unable to compete in the Olympic trials.

However, his impressive amateur career included three state Golden Gloves and four state AAU titles. He lost to future pro opponent Greg Page at the 1976 National Golden Gloves, and to Charles Singleton at the 1978 National Golden Gloves in Albuquerque, New Mexico. At the 1977 USA–USSR Duals in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he lost on points to the Soviet light heavyweight David Kvachadze. He also managed to beat future pro contender Renaldo Snipes, who he later turned pro with on the same card in 1978.

==Professional career==
Tillis began his professional boxing career in 1978, with a first-round knockout of Ron Stephany. He won his first 20 fights with 16 knockouts. One of his most impressive early victories was a seventh-round knockout of Ron Stander in 1980. Stander had once challenged Joe Frazier for the world title and was regarded as one of boxing&#x27;s most durable fighters. Other notable wins included a knockout of the South American champion Domingo D&#x27;Elia, and a points win over the sometimes dangerous fringe contender Mike Koranicki. His co-managers were Beau Williford and Gary Bentley.

===Title fight===
In 1981, Tillis fought &quot;Hercules&quot; Mike Weaver for the WBA World Heavyweight title. After a strong start, Tillis tired. The fight would become famous for trainer Angelo Dundee imploring Tillis to do something, asking the fighter, &quot;Do you want to be a bum all your life?&quot; Ultimately, Tillis lost a close points decision.

In June 1982, Tillis came off the floor to outpoint the hard-hitting legend Earnie Shavers. He blew that momentum only a few months later, being upset by undefeated contender Pinklon Thomas, who was a late substitute, via an 8th-round knockout loss. In November 1982, Tillis fought former amateur rival Greg Page for the USBA Heavyweight title. He knocked Page down in the 2nd round, but again tired and was the victim of another eighth-round knockout loss. Thomas and Page would go on to win different versions of the world title.

===Downward spiral===
Having scored four wins, Tillis challenged future two-time world champion Tim Witherspoon in September 1983, for the vacant North American Boxing Federation title. Tillis was shockingly bombed out in one round, apparently slipping on a wet spot in the ring as Witherspoon hit him. After the fight, Tillis&#x27; trainer Angelo Dundee left him and advised him to retire, as he had just suffered his third defeat in thirteen months.

Tillis got a new team and put together four wins in 1984, before challenging Carl Williams in a world title eliminator. Having decked Williams twice in the opening round, Tillis tired and was outpointed. In 1985, under the guidance of trainer Drew Bundini Brown, he fought Joe Frazier&#x27;s son and top contender Marvis Frazier. In a recurring theme, he had Frazier down in the second round, but again ran out of gas and was outpointed. A few months later, he traveled to South Africa to fight hard-hitting ex-champ Gerrie Coetzee. Tillis lost a unanimous decision, but sent Coetzee to hospital with stitches and missing teeth.

===Stamina issue===
After extensive medical examination, Tillis&#x27; strange recurrent fatigue midway through fights was found to derive from a severe allergy to the classic fighter&#x27;s diet of milk and eggs. A doctor provided Tillis with a more suitable diet, in the training for his upcoming fight with Mike Tyson, a red-hot prospect with a 19–0 (19 knockouts) record. Tillis appeared to be a new man, as he exchanged with Tyson and gave the future two-time champion a very tough fight. Although ultimately outpointed, he was the first person to take Iron Mike to the distance. Surprisingly, Tillis&#x27; heart and will to fight has been questioned quite frequently by boxing analysts, even his co-manager Beau Williford told to the press the night before the fight considering that James was on a three-times-in-a-row losing streak, that his professional career as a boxer would be ended most likely if stopped by Tyson. Trainer Angelo Dundee, who worked with Tillis for the Weaver fight and some subsequent fights, finally gave up his job, he said: &quot;James had no spirit to fight.&quot; In the pre-fight interview he told the ESPN staff that he found that spirit. To prove Dundee was wrong, Tillis violated almost all the Dundee &quot;No-Nos&quot; in the Tyson fight:
* Fought out of the squared-up stance, instead of the closed sideway stance.
* Sometimes fought with both hands down.
* Switched to southpaw and back to orthodox.
* Lead with his right hand.
* &quot;Left-hooked with a hooker.&quot;
* Got tangled in wild exchanges.
Culminative moment of the fight came at 2:45 of the fourth round, when Tillis charged at Tyson with a leaping left hook, missed, and went off-balanced while pivoting on his left foot. Tyson slipped the punch and promptly switched to orthodox, throwing a leaping left hook of his own that landed right to the Tillis&#x27; chin, Tillis went down immediately. Tillis got up quickly at the count of &quot;Two.&quot; That was the only knockdown during the entire fight, it cost Tillis a point, and subsequently a round on all the three judges&#x27; scorecards, and eventually the fight, which otherwise would have been ended a draw.

Initially, the crowd was rooting for Tyson, but in the later rounds it turned somewhat against Tyson due to him being unable to knock Tillis out, and after the ring announcer Paul LeFlore announced the judges&#x27; decision, pronouncing Tyson as the winner by a unanimous decision, the crowd booed wildly when referee Joe Cortez raised Tyson&#x27;s hand. Being interviewed by the ABC Sports Network staff, Tyson himself said he just &quot;fought a guy who was up for this fight, in the greatest shape in his life.&quot;

The new Tillis was short-lived, however, as he traveled to Australia and lost a decision to veteran Joe Bugner. In 1987, he was upset in eight rounds, as underdog (and regular Tyson sparring partner) Michael Williams came off the floor to stop Tillis. Later in the same year, he was stopped in five rounds on cuts by future champ Frank Bruno in London, and then knocked out in 10 rounds by hard-hitting Johnny DuPlooy in South Africa.

Having failed to secure a rematch with Tyson in 1988, this time for the undisputed heavyweight championship, he made one last attempt at the big time. Tillis was brought in to fight reigning cruiserweight world champion Evander Holyfield, who was making a high-profile move into the heavyweight ranks. Holyfield outpunched Tillis in five one-sided rounds.

Tillis resurfaced in 1991. However, his days even as a journeyman appeared over, as hard-hitting (and future WBO World Champion) Tommy Morrison stopped him out in one round.

===Semi-retirement===
Tillis fought on and off until 2001. Although he still was able to outpoint former top-flight amateur Craig Payne, a 39-year-old Tillis was stopped in six rounds by Cliff Couser in 1996.

Tillis fought his last fight in 2001, losing to clubfighter Rob Calloway when he was 44 years old.

==Professional boxing record==

==Exhibition boxing record==

==Life after boxing==
In retirement he wrote an autobiography, &quot;Thinkin Big: The Story of James Quick Tillis, the Fightin&#x27; Cowboy&quot;.

James Tillis received catBOX Entertainment, Inc.’s Lifetime Sports Achievement Award. Tillis, whose fighting prowess named him “quick” and “the fighting cowboy”, was honored with the catBOX Entertainment, Inc.’s Lifetime Sports Achievement Award, before the main event at catBOX’s professional fight card set for February 11, 2010 at Remington Park Casino in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

On February 12, 2010, the State of Oklahoma honored one of its favorite sons, James “Quick” Tillis of Tulsa. Gov. Brad Henry signed a declaration making Feb 12 James “Quick” Tillis Day in Oklahoma.

As of 2010 Tillis is living in Tulsa.

His daughter Iciss played basketball at Duke University as a center, and was on the United States National Team for the 2003 Pan American Games. Iciss was later selected in the first round by the Detroit Shock during 2004 WNBA draft. She later played for the New York Liberty in 2006.

===Honorary Sign===

On September 22, 2017, Tillis was honored by the city of Tulsa with honorary signs renaming a section of E. Virgin St &quot;Quick Tillis Way&quot; from N. Garrison Ave – N. Frankfort Ave.

==Rochester Boxing Hall of Fame induction==

On November 5, 2011, James &quot;Quick&quot; Tillis was Inducted into the Rochester Boxing Hall of Fame, receiving the &quot;John Mastrella Integrity Award&quot;.

Tillis places the priorities in his life as &quot;Serving The Lord Jesus Christ, Cowboy-ing and volunteering with amateur boxing clubs&quot;.

Bringing to fruition film adaptation of his autobiography, &quot;Thinkin Big: The Story of James Quick Tillis, the Fightin&#x27; Cowboy&quot;, is his pet project.

<text>Jökulsá á Fjöllum (; &quot;glacial river in the mountains&quot;) is the second longest river in Iceland (206 km). Its source is the Vatnajökull glacier. It flows into the Greenland Sea. Jökulsá á Fjöllum streams over the waterfalls Selfoss, Dettifoss, Hafragilsfoss, and , the second of which is the most powerful waterfall in Europe.

The source of the river is in the Vatnajökull National Park, one of three national parks in Iceland. The river is located in the northeast of Iceland and forms the eastern boundary of Ódáðahraun, an extensive lava field. Its drainage basin is the largest in Iceland at 7,380 square kilometers.

==Glacial flooding==
Dettifoss drops into the Jökulsárgljúfur canyon, a feature which, along with the Ásbyrgi gorge, appears to have been formed by catastrophic glacial flooding caused by volcanic activity. The volcano in question was possibly Bárðarbunga, which has been identified as posing the risk of a similar event in the future.

The largest &quot;jökulhlaup&quot;s (glacial floods) in Iceland are known to have occurred along Jökulsá á Fjöllum between 7100 and 2000 yr BP.
The source of these floods were likely eruptions of a major volcano under the Vatnajökull glacier, in the late Holocene. The peak discharge of this flood is estimated to have been . This can be compared to the flow of the Amazon River, which has an average discharge of .

The latest research concludes that the Jökulsárgljúfur canyon was formed by three flooding events. These key events occurred two, five and nine thousand years ago, separated by millennia of relative stability.

<doc id="683109" wikidata="Q17104294" url="?curid=683109" title="Triality">
<text>In mathematics, triality is a relationship among three vector spaces, analogous to the duality relation between dual vector spaces. Most commonly, it describes those special features of the Dynkin diagram D4 and the associated Lie group Spin(8), the double cover of 8-dimensional rotation group SO(8), arising because the group has an outer automorphism of order three. There is a geometrical version of triality, analogous to duality in projective geometry.

Of all simple Lie groups, Spin(8) has the most symmetrical Dynkin diagram, D4. The diagram has four nodes with one node located at the center, and the other three attached symmetrically. The symmetry group of the diagram is the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;3 which acts by permuting the three legs. This gives rise to an &quot;S&quot;3 group of outer automorphisms of Spin(8). This automorphism group permutes the three 8-dimensional irreducible representations of Spin(8); these being the &quot;vector&quot; representation and two chiral &quot;spin&quot; representations. These automorphisms do not project to automorphisms of SO(8). The vector representation—the natural action of SO(8) (hence Spin(8)) on —consists over the real numbers of Euclidean 8-vectors and is generally known as the &quot;defining module&quot;, while the chiral spin representations are also known as &quot;half-spin representations&quot;, and all three of these are fundamental representations.

No other connected Dynkin diagram has an automorphism group of order greater than 2; for other D&quot;n&quot; (corresponding to other even Spin groups, Spin(2&quot;n&quot;)), there is still the automorphism corresponding to switching the two half-spin representations, but these are not isomorphic to the vector representation.

Roughly speaking, symmetries of the Dynkin diagram lead to automorphisms of the Tits building associated with the group. For special linear groups, one obtains projective duality. For Spin(8), one finds a curious phenomenon involving 1-, 2-, and 4-dimensional subspaces of 8-dimensional space, historically known as &quot;geometric triality&quot;.

The exceptional 3-fold symmetry of the D4 diagram also gives rise to the Steinberg group 3D4.

==General formulation==

A duality between two vector spaces over a field is a non-degenerate bilinear form
:formula_1
i.e., for each non-zero vector in one of the two vector spaces, the pairing with is a non-zero linear functional on the other.

Similarly, a triality between three vector spaces over a field is a non-degenerate trilinear form
:formula_2
i.e., each non-zero vector in one of the three vector spaces induces a duality between the other two.

By choosing vectors in each on which the trilinear form evaluates to 1, we find that the three vector spaces are all isomorphic to each other, and to their duals. Denoting this common vector space by , the triality may be re-expressed as a bilinear multiplication
:formula_3
where each corresponds to the identity element in . The non-degeneracy condition now implies that is a composition algebra. It follows that has dimension 1, 2, 4 or 8. If further and the form used to identify with its dual is positive definite, then is a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra, and is therefore isomorphic to R, C, H or O.

Conversely, composition algebras immediately give rise to trialities by taking each equal to the algebra, and contracting the multiplication with the inner product on the algebra to make a trilinear form.

An alternative construction of trialities uses spinors in dimensions 1, 2, 4 and 8. The eight-dimensional case corresponds to the triality property of Spin(8).

<text>Morinda citrifolia is a fruit-bearing tree in the coffee family, Rubiaceae, native to Southeast Asia and Australasia, which was spread across the Pacific by Polynesian sailors. The species is now cultivated throughout the tropics and widely naturalised. There are over 100 names for this fruit across different regions, including great morinda, Indian mulberry, noni, beach mulberry, vomit fruit, awl tree, and rotten cheese fruit.

The pungent odour of the fresh fruit has made it a famine food in most regions, but it remains a staple food among some cultures and is used in traditional medicine. In the consumer market, dietary supplements are sold in various formats, such as capsules and juices.

==Description==
&quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; is a shrub or small tree up to 6 m tall, with grey-brown bark. The twigs are more or less square in cross-section and often fleshy. Stipules are present, very broad and obtuse at the apex, measuring up to 2 cm wide and long. The large leaves are arranged in opposite pairs on the twigs, reaching up to 25 cm long by 13 cm wide. They are elliptic to ovate in shape and have 6–9 pairs of lateral veins. Domatia are usually present as dense tufts of hairs in the junctions of the lateral veins with the midrib.

The inflorescences are dense heads of flowers produced at the apex of the branch. They are leaf-opposed, replacing one leaf in the pair. There may be up to 90100 flowers in the head, but only a few open at a time. The flowers are white and tubular with five lobes, measuring about 15 cm long and across.

The fruit is a multiple fruit consisting of fused drupes, each containing four seeds. They are initially green, transitioning through pale yellow to white or grey, and when ripe they emit a pungent odour similar to blue cheese. They are irregularly ellipsoid or ovoid, and may reach up to 9x6 cm.

===Phenology===
The plants flower and fruit throughout the year. It is common to see flowers and fruit in varying stages of development on a plant at any given time.

==Growing habitats==
&quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; grows in shady forests and on open rocky or sandy shores. It takes 18 months for the plant to mature, and yields of fruit per month throughout the year. It is tolerant of saline soils, drought conditions, and secondary soils. It can be found in various environments including volcanic terrains and clearings or limestone outcrops, as well as in coral atolls. It can grow up to tall and has large, simple, dark green, shiny, and deeply veined leaves.

==Ecology==
&quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; is attractive to weaver ants, which make their nests by using the leaves of this tree. These ants protect the plant from some plant-parasitic insects. The smell of the fruit also attracts fruit bats, which aid in dispersing the seeds. &quot;Drosophila sechellia&quot;, a type of fruit fly endemic to the Seychelles, feeds exclusively on these fruits.

==Uses==
A variety of beverages (juice drinks), powders (from dried ripe or unripe fruits), cosmetic products (lotions, soaps), oil (from seeds), and leaf powders (for encapsulation or pills) have been introduced into the consumer market.

=== Culinary ===
Indigenous peoples used the fruit as emergency food during famines. Therefore, it is also called &quot;starvation fruit&quot;. Despite its strong smell and bitter taste, the fruit was nevertheless eaten as a famine food, and, in some Pacific Islands, even as a staple food, either raw or cooked. Southeast Asians and Aboriginal Australians consume fresh fruit with salt or cook it with curry. The seeds are edible when roasted. In Thai cuisine, the leaves known as &quot;bai-yo&quot; are used as a leaf vegetable and are the main ingredient of &quot;Kaeng bai-yo&quot;, cooked with coconut milk. The fruit &quot;luk-yo&quot; is added as a salad ingredient to some versions of green papaya salad.

In Cambodia, the leaves are an essential part of the national dish fish amok.

===Traditional medicine===
Green fruit, leaves, and root or rhizomes might have been used in Polynesian cultures as a general tonic, in addition to its traditional place in Polynesian culture as a famine food. Although &quot;Morinda&quot; is considered to have biological properties in traditional medicine, there is no confirmed evidence of clinical efficacy for any intended use. In 2018, a Hawaiian manufacturer of food and skincare products based on this fruit was issued an FDA warning letter for marketing unapproved drugs and making false health claims in violation of the US Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

===Dyes===
The fruit has traditionally been used by Austronesian peoples mainly for producing dyes. It was carried into the Pacific Islands as canoe plants by Austronesian voyagers. Morinda bark produces a brownish-purplish dye that may be used for making batik. In Hawaii, yellowish dye is extracted from its roots to dye cloth. Yolngu artists at Bula&#x27;Bula Arts in Ramingining, in central Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, Australia, use the roots and bark of &quot;djundom&quot;, as it is known to them, to dye the fibres of pandanus to create a wide variety of artifacts.

Applying a mordant to the fabric before dyeing is necessary when using extracts of this plant as a dye. This process can be labor-intensive if the goal is to achieve shades and hues with the morinda dye.

==Nutrients and phytochemicals==
&quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; fruit powder contains carbohydrates and dietary fibre in moderate amounts. These macronutrients reside in the fruit pulp, as &quot;M. citrifolia&quot; juice has sparse nutrient content. The main micronutrients of &quot;M. citrifolia&quot; pulp powder include vitamin C, vitamin B3), iron, and potassium. Vitamin A, calcium, and sodium are present in moderate amounts. Compared to powdered pulp, only vitamin C is retained in the analysis of &quot;M. citrifolia&quot; juice. The juice contains 34 mg of vitamin C per 100 g, which is 64% of the amount found in a raw navel orange (53 mg per 100 g of orange, or 89% of the Daily Value). Sodium levels in &quot;M. citrifolia&quot; juice (about 3% of Dietary Reference Intake, DRI) are high compared to an orange, while potassium content is moderate.

&quot;Morinda citrifolia&quot; fruit contains several phytochemicals, including lignans, oligo- and polysaccharides, flavonoids, iridoids such as deacetylasperulosidic acid, fatty acids, scopoletin, catechin, beta-sitosterol, damnacanthal, and alkaloids.

<text>Hvítá (Icelandic , &quot;white river&quot;) is a river in Iceland that begins at Hvítárvatn glacier lake on Langjökull glacier in the highlands of Iceland at . The river flows for before dropping down into a narrow gorge at Gullfoss waterfall.

Thereafter, the river flows between Biskupstungur and Hrunamannahreppur districts. Here, Hvítá combines with three other rivers: Tungufljót , Brúará, and Stóra-Laxá , doubling the volume of the river. It proceeds to run through the flatlands near Grímsnes and behind Ingólfsfjall mountain. Just north of Selfoss town, it meets Sog River where it becomes Ölfusá as it flows into the Atlantic Ocean.

Because of danger of flooding, especially during winter, Hvítá has a reputation of being the most dangerous river in Iceland.

Organised rafting excursions take place on parts of the river. The river is bridged at 4 locations, thrice at the lowland and once near the source in the highland where it is only open over the summer.
