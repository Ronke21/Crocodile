<text>Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton (born 7 January 1985) is a British racing driver, who is contracted to compete in Formula One for Ferrari. Hamilton has won a joint-record seven Formula One World Drivers&#x27; Championship titles—tied with Michael Schumacher—and holds the records for most wins (), pole positions (), and podium finishes (), among others.

Born and raised in Stevenage, Hamilton began his career in karting aged six, winning several national titles and attracting the attention of Ron Dennis, who signed him to the McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme in 1998. After winning the direct-drive Karting World Cup and European Championship in 2000, Hamilton progressed to junior formulae, where his successes included winning the Formula 3 Euro Series and the GP2 Series. He subsequently signed for McLaren in , becoming the first black driver to compete in Formula One at the . In his rookie season, Hamilton won four Grands Prix and set several records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. Hamilton won his maiden title in , making a title-deciding overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season to become the then-youngest World Drivers&#x27; Champion. The dominant Red Bull-Renault combination prevailed throughout his remaining four seasons at McLaren, with Hamilton achieving multiple race wins in each, including his involvement in a four-way title battle in .

Hamilton signed for Mercedes in to partner his old karting teammate Nico Rosberg, ending his 15-year association with McLaren. Following his maiden victory with the team at the Hungarian Grand Prix, new engine regulations came into effect the following season, which saw Mercedes emerge as the dominant force in Formula One. Over the next three seasons, Hamilton and Rosberg won 51 of 59 Grands Prix amidst their fierce rivalry—widely known as &quot;The Silver War&quot;—with Hamilton winning the former titles in and , and Rosberg winning the latter. After Rosberg&#x27;s retirement, Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari to claim his fourth and fifth titles in and . Hamilton won his sixth title in , before breaking several records across his campaign—including the all-time win record at the —to equal Michael Schumacher&#x27;s record of seven World Drivers&#x27; Championships. Hamilton became the first driver to surpass 100 race wins and pole positions in , finishing runner-up to Max Verstappen amidst a controversial finish. Following winless campaigns in and , he took his record-breaking ninth victory in , his twelfth and final season with Mercedes. Hamilton signed for Ferrari in , and is contracted to remain in the team until at least the end of .

Hamilton has been credited with furthering Formula One&#x27;s global following by appealing to a broader audience outside the sport, in part due to his high-profile lifestyle, amongst his environmental and social activism. He has also become a prominent advocate in support of racial justice and increased diversity in motorsport. Hamilton was listed in the 2020 issue of &quot;Time&quot; as one of the 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours.
==Early life and education==

Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. His father, Anthony Hamilton, is of Afro-Grenadian descent, while his mother, Carmen Larbalestier, is White British from Birmingham, making him mixed-race. Hamilton&#x27;s parents separated when he was two, after which he lived with his mother and older half-sisters, Samantha and Nicola, until he was twelve. Hamilton then lived with his father, stepmother Linda, and his half-brother Nicolas, who is also a professional racing driver. Hamilton was raised a Catholic.

Hamilton&#x27;s father bought him a radio-controlled car when he was five. Hamilton finished second in the national BRCA championship the following year against adult competition. Being the only black child racing at his club, Hamilton was subjected to racist abuse. Hamilton&#x27;s father bought him a go-kart for Christmas when he was six and promised to support his racing career as long as he worked hard at school. To support his son, Hamilton&#x27;s father took redundancy from his position as an IT manager and became a contractor, sometimes working up to four jobs at a time including employment as a double glazing salesman, dishwasher, and putting up signs for estate agents, while still attending his son&#x27;s races. Hamilton&#x27;s father later set up his own IT company. He continued to be Hamilton&#x27;s manager until early 2010.

Hamilton was educated at The John Henry Newman School, a voluntary aided Catholic secondary school in Stevenage. Hamilton has said that at the age of five he took up karate to defend himself as a result of bullying at school. He was also excluded from school for a period when he was mistakenly identified as having attacked a fellow student who was treated in hospital for his injuries. In addition to racing, he played association football for his school team with eventual England international, Ashley Young. Hamilton, an Arsenal fan, said that if Formula One had not worked for him, he would have been a footballer or a cricketer, having played both for his school teams. In February 2001, he began studies at Cambridge Arts and Sciences (CATS), a private sixth-form college in Cambridge.

==Junior racing career==
===Karting===
Hamilton began karting in 1993 and quickly began winning races and cadet class championships. Two years later, he became the youngest driver to win the British cadet karting championship at the age of ten. That year, Hamilton approached McLaren Formula One team boss Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards for an autograph and said: &quot;Hi. I&#x27;m Lewis Hamilton. I won the British Championship and one day I want to be racing your cars.&quot; Dennis wrote in Hamilton&#x27;s autograph book: &quot;Phone me in nine years, we&#x27;ll sort something out then.&quot;

When Hamilton was 12, Ladbrokes took a bet, at 40/1 odds, that Hamilton would win a Formula One race before the age of 23; another predicted, at 150/1 odds, that he would win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship before he was 25. In 1998, Dennis called Hamilton following his second Super One series and British championship wins, to offer Hamilton a role in the McLaren-Mercedes Young Driver Programme. The contract included an option of a future Formula One seat, which would make Hamilton the youngest driver to secure a contract that later resulted in a Formula One drive.
Hamilton continued his progress in the Intercontinental A (1999), Formula A (2000) and Formula Super A (2001) ranks, and became European Champion in 2000 with maximum points. In Formula A and Formula Super A, racing for TeamMBM.com, his teammate was Nico Rosberg, who would later drive for the Williams and Mercedes teams in Formula One; they would later team up again for Mercedes from 2013 to 2016. Following his karting successes, the British Racing Drivers&#x27; Club made him a &quot;Rising Star&quot; Member in 2000. In 2001, Michael Schumacher made a one-off return to karts and competed against Hamilton along with other future Formula One drivers Vitantonio Liuzzi and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton ended the final in seventh, four places behind Schumacher. Although the two saw little of each other on the track, Schumacher praised the young Briton.

===Formula Renault and Formula Three===
Hamilton began his car racing career in the 2001 British Formula Renault Winter Series, finishing fifth in the standings. This led to a full 2002 Formula Renault UK campaign with Manor Motorsport in which he finished third overall, and fifth in the Formula Renault Eurocup amidst only competing for four rounds. He remained with Manor for another year in Formula Renault UK, winning the championship in a dominant fashion ahead of Alex Lloyd, as he registered 10 wins from 15 races. Having clinched the championship, Hamilton missed the last two races of the season to make his debut in the season finale of the British Formula 3 Championship. In his first race he was forced out with a puncture, and in the second he crashed out and was taken to hospital after a collision with teammate Tor Graves.

Asked in 2002 about the prospect of becoming one of the youngest ever Formula One drivers, Hamilton replied that his goal was &quot;not to be the youngest in Formula One&quot; but rather &quot;to be experienced and then show what I can do in Formula One&quot;. He made his debut with Manor in the 2004 Formula 3 Euro Series, ending the year fifth in the championship. He also won the Bahrain F3 Superprix, and twice raced in the Macau F3 Grand Prix. Williams had come close to signing Hamilton but did not as BMW, their engine supplier at the time, refused to fund him. Hamilton eventually re-signed with McLaren. According to then McLaren executive and future CEO Martin Whitmarsh, who was responsible for guiding Hamilton through the team&#x27;s young driver programme, he and Anthony Hamilton had a &quot;huge row&quot; at the end of the season, with his father pushing for him to move up to GP2 for 2005, while Whitmarsh felt that he should remain in Formula 3 for a second season, culminating in Whitmarsh tearing up Hamilton&#x27;s contract; however, Hamilton called Whitmarsh six weeks later and re-signed with the team.

Hamilton had his first Formula One test with McLaren in late 2004 at Silverstone. He moved to the reigning Euro Series champions, ASM for the 2005 season and dominated the championship, winning 15 of the 20 rounds and bragging 13 pole positions. He also won the Marlboro Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort. Following his success, British magazine &quot;Autosport&quot; featured him in their &quot;Top 50 Drivers of 2005&quot; issue, ranking Hamilton at 24th.

===GP2===
Hamilton moved to ASM&#x27;s sister GP2 team, ART Grand Prix, for the 2006 season. Hamilton won the GP2 championship at his first attempt, beating Nelson Piquet Jr. He secured a dominant win at the Nürburgring, amidst a penalty for speeding in the pit lane. At his home race in Silverstone, Hamilton overtook two rivals at Becketts, a series of high-speed corners where overtaking is considered to be rare. In Istanbul he recovered from a spin that left him in 18th place to take second. Hamilton won the title in unusual circumstances, inheriting the final point he needed after Giorgio Pantano was stripped of fastest lap in the Monza feature race.

==Formula One career==
===McLaren (2007–2012)===
Hamilton&#x27;s success in the GP2 championship coincided with a vacancy at McLaren-Mercedes following the departure of Juan Pablo Montoya to NASCAR and Kimi Räikkönen to Ferrari. Hamilton was given nearly of testing in the McLaren MP4-21 to acclimatise himself to Formula One, alongside Pedro de la Rosa and Gary Paffett. Ultimately, Hamilton was confirmed as the team&#x27;s second driver; the announcement was not made public for nearly two months, reportedly to avoid being overlooked by Michael Schumacher&#x27;s retirement announcement.

====2007–2008: Record-breaking debut seasons====

Hamilton&#x27;s maiden season in Formula One saw him partner two-time defending World Drivers&#x27; Champion Fernando Alonso at McLaren. At the season-opening , Hamilton became the first—and, , only—black driver to race in the series. After finishing third on debut, Hamilton went on to set several records, including the most consecutive podium finishes from debut (9), the most wins in a debut season (4, shared with Jacques Villeneuve) and the most points in a debut season (109). Acquiring the championship lead as early as in the fourth round of the season, Hamilton became the youngest driver to lead the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. After a series of misfortunes in the latter half of the season, including strategical missteps by McLaren in the closing rounds and a retirement at the , Hamilton&#x27;s 12-point advantage in the standings evanesced. He finished runner-up in the championship to Räikkönen by one point, classified ahead of teammate Alonso whilst finishing level on points. Throughout the season, Hamilton and Alonso were involved in several incidents, which resulted in inter-team tensions, culminating in Alonso and McLaren terminating their contract by mutual consent. Hamilton signed a million contract to stay with the team until the end of 2012.
Partnering Heikki Kovalainen for , Hamilton&#x27;s winning form continued as he amassed five race victories and 10 podium finishes. Ferrari drivers, along with BMW&#x27;s Robert Kubica, emerged as his closest rivals, as they engaged in a close battle for the title with Hamilton during the first half of the season. At the rain-affected , he won by over a minute from second-placed Nick Heidfeld, which was widely acclaimed as one of the greatest wet-weather performances in Formula One history. As the season progressed towards the closing rounds, the championship became a clear two-way fight between Hamilton and Ferrari&#x27;s Felipe Massa. Hamilton won his maiden title at the season-ending , overtaking Timo Glock for fifth-place at the final corners of the last lap to become the then-youngest World Drivers&#x27; Champion, and deny race-winner Massa the title by one point. Hamilton also became the first British driver to win the World Drivers&#x27; Championship since Damon Hill in .
====2009–2012: Unsuccessful title bids and departure from McLaren==== 
During his veering final years with McLaren—a period largely dominated by Red Bull—Hamilton continued to score podium finishes and race victories, and challenged for titles. Major technical regulation changes in led to a challenging start for McLaren. Often qualifying outside of the top ten, and struggling to finish consistently on points, Hamilton&#x27;s chances of defending his title became unfeasible. Major upgrades at the saw a dramatic improvement in performance of the MP4-24 car. From that point onward, Hamilton advanced from eleventh to fifth in the standings and outscored the rest of the field, securing two race victories and three additional podium finishes across the remaining nine rounds.
In , Hamilton was partnered by reigning World Drivers&#x27; Champion Jenson Button. Whilst McLaren struggled to match the outright pace of Red Bull and Ferrari, Hamilton engaged in a four-way title battle with Alonso, Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber throughout the season. At the , he secured McLaren&#x27;s only pole position of the season, and took the championship lead after winning the race. Hamilton&#x27;s latter half of the season unravelled with a number of misfortunes, including race-ending collisions and mechanical failures, culminated in him losing vital points to his rivals, and ultimately, the championship lead. He entered the final round of the season with an outside chance of winning the title, but finished fourth in the standings as Vettel won his maiden title. 

 was a challenging year for Hamilton, marking the first season he had been out-scored by a teammate, as Button finished runner-up to Vettel. Setbacks in his private life, as well as on-track collisions culminating in multiple run-ins with the stewards, contributed to his inconsistent performances throughout the season. Hamilton finished fifth in the standings with three race wins; he secured the only non-Red Bull pole position of the season at the , and vowed he would return to form. 

In , McLaren emerged as contenders for the title, with Hamilton remaining in title contention during the first half of the season. Akin to the 2010 season, he endured a challenging latter half of the season, with inconsistent results and a series of mechanical failures. Across those ten races, Hamilton encountered five retirements, three whilst leading. Ultimately, Hamilton finished fourth in the standings, achieving four race wins and a season-highest seven pole positions. &quot;Motorsport.com&quot; analysis found that Hamilton had lost an estimated 110 points due to race retirements and other misfortunes. Prior to the end of the year, having denied multiple renegotiations with McLaren, Hamilton announced—to widespread surprise—that he would be joining Mercedes for the 2013 season. Hamilton expressed his gratitude, stating he was &quot;forever grateful&quot; for the opportunities and support he had received throughout his career, ending a 15-year association with McLaren.

===Mercedes (2013–2024)===
====2013–2016: Teammates with Rosberg====

Upon signing with Mercedes in , with a deal reportedly worth more than  million to replace the retiring Schumacher, Hamilton was reunited with his childhood karting teammate, Nico Rosberg. The move was met with surprise by pundits and the public, with some describing the move to Mercedes—a team with no recent history of success—as a gamble. In his first season with the Brackley-based team—amidst Mercedes W04&#x27;s tyre management struggles—Hamilton finished fourth in the standings, securing five podium finishes and pole positions, with only one converted into a race victory at the . Whilst Pirelli&#x27;s switch in tyre construction contributed to his victory in Hungary, Hamilton and Mercedes endured a difficult latter half of the season, as he only managed to achieve one podium finish for the rest of the year.

Changes to engine regulations for the season, which mandated the use of turbo-hybrid engines, contributed to the start of a highly successful era for Hamilton. Mercedes won 16 of the 19 races held that season; Hamilton secured a career-best 11 victories as he prevailed in a season-long duel for the title against teammate Rosberg. After securing a streak of wins and acquiring the championship lead, Hamilton endured a number of misfortunes mid-season, including mechanical failures and a collision with Rosberg which culminated in a retirement from the , saw him trailing Rosberg by 29 points in the standings. Following a run of five consecutive race victories towards the end of the season, Hamilton clinched his second World Drivers&#x27; Championship at the final round in Abu Dhabi, and declared it was &quot;the greatest day of [his] life&quot; over team radio.

Opting to continue racing with his old karting number 44, Hamilton fended off Rosberg&#x27;s challenge for the title for a second year running in , winning 10 races from a then-joint record 17 podium finishes, scoring 11 pole positions in the first 12 races, and leading the championship throughout the season, he achieved his first back-to-back championships. His rivalry with Rosberg intensified, climaxing in a heated battle at the , where Hamilton clinched the title with three races to spare. Hamilton extended his contract with Mercedes for three additional years in a deal reportedly worth more than  million; the deal allowed Hamilton to retain his own image rights and keep his championship-winning cars and trophies.
After another season-long duel for the title in , Hamilton finished runner-up in the championship to Rosberg by five points. He endured a challenging start to the season, as a succession of poor race-starts and mechanical failures culminated in him being marginally behind Rosberg in the standings. Mercedes&#x27; policy of letting the pair fight freely led to several acrimonious exchanges on-track, culminating in collisions at the Spanish and Austrian Grands Prix. Hamilton won six of seven races mid-season, including the , where he overtook his teammate to the championship lead for the first time of the season. After a crucial engine blowout in Malaysia, Hamilton secured a hat-trick of wins—including his 50th race victory in United States, and 100th podium finish in Japan—to enter the season-ending , 12 points adrift of Rosberg. In Abu Dhabi, Hamilton defied team orders—deliberately slowing Rosberg into the chasing pack at the end of the race, in an unsuccessful bid to encourage other drivers to overtake his teammate. Rosberg took the title before announcing his shock retirement from the sport, immediately after beating his rival. Finishing runner-up in the championship, Hamilton broke the record for most wins in a season without becoming the champion, securing a season-highest 10 race victories, in addition to the record for most career points of all-time.

====2017–2020: Four titles in a row====
Following Rosberg&#x27;s retirement, Hamilton was partnered by Valtteri Bottas in . With Ferrari emerging as the team to beat after the major overhaul in aerodynamics regulations, Vettel became Hamilton&#x27;s closest rival, as he led the standings throughout the first half of the season ahead of Hamilton. Following the summer break, benefitting from Vettel&#x27;s misfortunes and Mercedes&#x27; resurgence, Hamilton dominated the subsequent races, winning five in six, including the where he broke the record for all-time most pole positions, and overtook Vettel for the championship lead for the first time of the season. Registering a total of 11 pole positions, nine race victories, and equalling the record for most grand slams in a season (3), Hamilton won his fourth World Drivers&#x27; title at the with two races to spare.
In , whilst Ferrari once again held the upper hand, Hamilton and Vettel engaged in a much closer battle for their fifth title—widely billed as the &quot;Fight for Five&quot;—they exchanged the championship lead several times until the half-way point of the season. Beginning from the —where Vettel made an error while leading and retired, and Hamilton won starting from 14th on the grid—Vettel&#x27;s season unravelled with a number of driver errors in the following races. Meanwhile, Hamilton repeated his run of consecutive wins to clinch his fifth title at the for a second year running. Securing a total of 11 pole positions and race victories from 17 podium finishes, he set a new record for most points scored in a season (408). During the season, Hamilton signed a two-year contract extension with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to  million per year, making him the best-paid Formula One driver in history.

Hamilton led the championship standings for the majority of , whilst benefitting from Mercedes&#x27; dominant performances during the first half of the season, he fended off title challenges from teammate Bottas, and remained unchallenged amidst Ferrari&#x27;s sturdy performances following the summer break. Hamilton clinched his sixth title at the with two races remaining. After scoring his sixth career grand slam at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the season finale, Hamilton ended the season with 11 race wins in 17 podiums (matching the all-time record for a fourth time), and broke his own record for most points by scoring a total of 413 points, 87 points clear of second-placed Bottas.

Hamilton dominated the season to win his seventh Drivers&#x27; title, equalling the record for most titles set by Schumacher, in a season heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the shortened seventeen-race season, Hamilton secured 10 pole positions and 11 race victories (equalling his previous personal best for the fifth time, in fewer races) including one from the , where he achieved his 92nd career win and broke the record for all-time most wins. Hamilton missed the after contracting COVID-19, his first race absence since his debut in 2007. Providing one of his greatest performances, Hamilton clinched the title at the rain-affected with three rounds to spare, and ended the season 124 points ahead of second-placed Bottas.

====2021: Title battle vs. Verstappen====

Regulation changes for the season saw Red Bull make performance gains on Mercedes, winning five consecutive races and acquiring the championship lead, Red Bull&#x27;s Max Verstappen and Hamilton emerged as title favourites early on in the season. Amidst their intense battle for the title, the pair engaged in several on-track battles—culminating in collisions in Britain, Italy and Saudi Arabia—and finished 1–2 at 14 of 22 Grands Prix. Hamilton achieved his 100th pole position and race win at the Spanish and Russian Grands Prix, respectively, becoming the first driver to achieve either feat. Securing a hat-trick of wins in the penultimate rounds, including a recovery drive at the —which was acclaimed as one of his greatest performances—Hamilton eliminated a 19-point deficit to Verstappen to enter the season-ending level on points. In Abu Dhabi, having led the majority of the race, Hamilton was denied the championship by a last-lap overtake from Verstappen following a late safety car. During the year, Hamilton extended his  million per year contact with Mercedes for two additional years.

The season finale was marred by controversy over race director Michael Masi&#x27;s decision to instruct the lapped cars separating Verstappen and Hamilton to un-lap themselves under the safety car, which closed the gap between the pair and allowed Verstappen, who opted to pit for soft tyres, to enter the final lap immediately behind Hamilton, who remained on worn hard tyres. Four days after the race, the FIA announced that it would conduct an internal investigation into the incident. Masi was subsequently removed from his role as race director, with the FIA World Motor Sport Council report finding that &quot;human error&quot; resulted in the failure to follow Formula One Sporting Regulations concerning the withdrawal of the safety car, adding that the final standings are &quot;valid, final and cannot now be changed&quot;. Notwithstanding the controversy in Abu Dhabi, &quot;BBC Sport&quot;&#x27;s Andrew Benson described the season as &quot;one of the most intense, hard-fought battles in sporting history&quot;, with Hamilton and Verstappen having &quot;been head and shoulders—and a lot more—clear of every other driver on the grid&quot;.

====2022–2024: Mercedes&#x27; struggles and departure====

Partnered by George Russell in place of the departing Bottas, the season marked the first time in Hamilton&#x27;s Formula One career that he did not secure a race win or a pole position. Significant changes in technical regulations saw Hamilton and Mercedes endure a challenging campaign, as the innovative and radically different W13 car suffered with porpoising throughout the season, leading him to deem it &quot;undrivable&quot; and causing him to sustain a back injury at the . He frequently experimented with car setups to aid the W13&#x27;s development during the opening stages of the season. Following major mid-season car upgrades, Hamilton achieved several podium finishes. Hamilton set several records across his sixteenth season, including most consecutive seasons with a podium finish, and at least one lap led. The season also marked the first time Hamilton finished behind his teammate in the standings since 2016, finishing sixth, 35 points behind Russell in fourth.

Mercedes once again faced concerns over their car&#x27;s competitiveness ahead of the season. Hamilton endured another winless campaign amidst Red Bull dominance, securing several podium finishes throughout and finishing third in the standings. He took his record ninth pole at the —his first since 2021—surpassing Senna and Schumacher for the most pole positions at the same Grand Prix. Hamilton signed a two-year contract extension worth over  million to remain with Mercedes.
Prior to the start of the season, Hamilton triggered an exit-clause in his contract, allowing him to leave Mercedes at the end of his campaign, a year before his contract was due to expire. Having been associated with the German marque since the age of 13, Hamilton explained the decision was one of his hardest to make, adding that he needed a new challenge and a different work environment. Mercedes&#x27; inconsistent form, coupled with Hamilton&#x27;s difficulties in adapting to the W15 car—whose characteristics struggled to mesh with his driving style—led to inconsistent qualifying performances, resulting in another challenging season in 2024. Mercedes&#x27; short-lived resurgence during mid-season enabled him to deliver his ninth victory, ending his 31-month winless drought; he broke the record for most wins at the same Grand Prix and became the first driver to win beyond their 300th start. Hamilton secured his 200th podium finish in Hungary, and another victory at the . After a series of races with fluctuating results, admitting he was &quot;looking forward to the end [of the season]&quot;, Hamilton ended the season a career-lowest seventh in the championship—22 points behind teammate Russell—marking the end of his Mercedes career, which was the most successful driver-constructor partnership in Formula One history by several metrics.
===Ferrari (2025 onwards)===
Following the announcement of his departure from Mercedes, Ferrari announced they had reached a multi-year agreement with Hamilton to join the team in , on a contract reported to be worth more than million per year, replacing Carlos Sainz Jr. to partner Charles Leclerc. Hamilton stated it had been a &quot;childhood dream&quot; to drive for Ferrari. In parallel to his move from McLaren to Mercedes in 2013, it was noted as one of the most unexpected driver transfers in Formula One history, and marked the first time in his career where he did not drive for a Mercedes-powered team.

==Driver profile==
===Driving style===

Hamilton is regarded as one of the most complete drivers on the grid, excelling across a wide range of areas. He has been described as having an aggressive driving style, with a natural aptitude for identifying the limits of the car. Mark Hughes, writing for the official Formula One website, described how Hamilton is &quot;super-hard on the brakes ... but has a fantastic ability to match how quickly the downforce is bleeding off with his modulation of the pressure so that there&#x27;s no wasted grip but no locked wheels either.&quot; Paddy Lowe, previously the engineering director for McLaren, described how Hamilton is comfortable with levels of rear instability that most other drivers would find intolerable.

Hamilton has also been praised for his ability to adapt to variances in the car set-up and changing track conditions; throughout his career, he has typically used less fuel than his teammates as a result of his ability to carry momentum through corners. Pedro de la Rosa, a former test driver for McLaren who worked with Hamilton and Alonso, rated the pair as the best he had seen first hand, stating that they shared a strength in terms of &quot;how much speed they can run into the apex [of a corner] and still have a decent exit speed&quot;, highlighting in particular their ability to maintain this speed when their rear tyres have lost grip during a longer stint.

Hamilton has been praised for his consistency, especially in his time at Mercedes. From 2017 to 2018, he finished 33 consecutive races in point-scoring positions, a run brought to an end as a result of mechanical issues. Ross Brawn wrote that &quot;over the course of [2018], Hamilton hardly put a foot wrong, winning not only the races he should have, but also some where the opposition was stronger, and that is the true mark of a champion.&quot; Ahead of the season, Martin Brundle, commentating for Sky Sports, said &quot;I think what has stood out about Lewis over the years is how few mistakes he makes, how complete he is and clean ... he just never makes a mistake [in] wheel-to-wheel combat [or] in qualifying ... He just doesn&#x27;t fade, mentally or physically.&quot;

Hamilton is regarded as one of the best wet-weather drivers in the sport, with some of his best performances occurring in those conditions. In the 2008 British Grand Prix, Hamilton bested second-place Nick Heidfeld by over a minute, the largest margin of victory recorded since the 1995 Australian Grand Prix. During the turbo-hybrid era, Hamilton remained unbeaten in every race affected by wet weather from the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix up to the 2019 German Grand Prix, where his almost five-year streak was broken by Max Verstappen. His wet weather drive at the 2020 Turkish Grand Prix where he clinched his seventh world title was widely acclaimed, with Joe Saward describing it as &quot;one of his greatest performances&quot;. Qualifying sixth for the race after Mercedes struggled with tyre temperatures and a track that lacked grip after being recently resurfaced, during the race he gambled on a one-stop strategy in mixed conditions whilst his rivals chose to change their tyres for a second time, enabling him to take the lead and win by over 30 seconds. His performance was contrasted with that of his team-mate Bottas, who spun four times and finished a lap down in 14th place. Hamilton cited the race as his &quot;stand-out&quot; performance of the season.
Ayrton Senna was a major influence on Hamilton&#x27;s driving style, recalling: &quot;I think it&#x27;s partly because I watched [him] when I was young and I thought &#x27;this is how I want to drive when I get the opportunity&#x27; and I went out there and tried it on the kart track. My whole approach to racing has developed from there.&quot; He has been compared to Senna in raw speed. In 2010, Hamilton drove Senna&#x27;s original title-winning McLaren MP4/4 as part of a tribute documentary by the BBC motoring show &quot;Top Gear&quot;. In the documentary, along with fellow racing drivers, he named Senna as the number one driver ever.

Earlier in his career, Hamilton was criticised for being hot-headed at times, as demonstrated when he was disqualified in Imola in the GP2 Series for overtaking the safety car, something he went on to repeat four years later in Formula One at the 2010 European Grand Prix in Valencia. Following his move to Mercedes, Hamilton was credited with demonstrating greater maturity, while maintaining his ruthlessness and aggression. The official Formula One website describes him as &quot;invariably a fierce but fair fighter&quot;.

===Reception===

Hamilton has been described as the best driver of his generation, and one of the greatest Formula One drivers including by Chase Carey and Martin Brundle. Several Formula One drivers and experts have described Hamilton as the greatest Formula One driver of all time. Writing in &quot;Autocar&quot;, Jim Holden suggested Hamilton might not only be among the greatest British drivers in Formula One but one of the greatest British sportsmen. Amongst receiving plaudits from experts and fans in and out of the sport, Hamilton has been a divisive figure in the eyes of the general public, with some journalists arguing his exploits on the track have been underappreciated. Holden has suggested that racial bias may have contributed towards Hamilton&#x27;s perceived lack of popularity relative to his achievements, with Hamilton&#x27;s race and physical appearance – being mixed-race and often seen sporting earrings, braids and designer clothing – alienating some of the sport&#x27;s traditional white, elderly male fanbase. Others have attributed his lack of appreciation to the perceived predictability of results during the turbo-hybrid era, likening his period of dominance to that of Schumacher in the early 2000s, and to tennis players Steffi Graf and Martina Navratilova, all of whom became more appreciated in the latter part of their careers.

Hamilton&#x27;s jet-set lifestyle and interests outside Formula One have been scrutinised. He has been praised for disregarding convention and public opinion and has been described as one of the last superstar drivers. Between race weekends Hamilton has on several occasions travelled around the world to explore a variety of interests, such as in 2018 where, after winning the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton flew to Shanghai and New York where he released his own designer clothing line with Tommy Hilfiger, before flying immediately back to, and winning, the next race in Singapore. His Mercedes team-boss Toto Wolff has been vocal in his support for Hamilton&#x27;s off-track pursuits, explaining how freedom allows Hamilton to function at his best.

Figures in the sport, such as Emerson Fittipaldi and Christian Horner, have voiced their support for Hamilton&#x27;s ability to connect with fans, while Bernie Ecclestone frequently commented on his admiration of Hamilton&#x27;s ability to promote the sport, observing how he is happy to engage with fans, unlike some of his peers. In 2019, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; sports journalist Luke Slater went as far as to argue that &quot;[t]here have been few better representatives of the sport than Hamilton ... [both] on and off the track.&quot; Following Hamilton&#x27;s knighthood in 2020, newly appointed Formula One CEO Stefano Domenicali said that Hamilton is &quot;a true giant of our sport&quot; and that &quot;his influence is huge both in and out of a car&quot;.

A prodigious talent as a teenager, Hamilton established himself as one of the world&#x27;s best drivers following his record-breaking rookie year. Paddy Lowe has suggested that &quot;he turned out to be the best rookie there has ever been&quot; and that &quot;his first half-season is just the most extraordinary in history.&quot; After his first world title a year later, many people considered Hamilton the best driver of his generation. Following Red Bull and Sebastian Vettel&#x27;s four-year dominance of the sport, Hamilton&#x27;s resolve was tested both professionally and personally as he did not finish higher than fourth in the Drivers&#x27; Championship from 2009 to 2013, leading some to question his status as the best driver in the sport. In spite of this, Hamilton&#x27;s less successful years with McLaren have also been cited as a demonstration of driving ability as Hamilton has won at least one race in fifteen consecutive seasons, attracting high praise from experts and fellow drivers for extracting race-winning performances from cars that were not dominant.
After Hamilton clinched his second and third World Championship titles with Mercedes in 2014 and 2015, David Coulthard declared Hamilton the best driver of his generation, calling him &quot;the Ayrton Senna of his era&quot;. As Hamilton became more widely considered the best driver of his era, public and expert debate moved from his status in modern Formula One to his status among the greatest drivers in history. The next few seasons saw Hamilton eclipse a number of records, including achieving the most all-time pole positions ahead of Michael Schumacher, leading him to be regarded by some as the greatest qualifier in history. After winning his fourth and fifth world titles, Hamilton&#x27;s place among the greats of the sport became firmly established in the opinions of experts, rivals, and teammates alike, including among others Fernando Alonso, Carlos Sainz Jr., Felipe Massa, Gerhard Berger, and Ross Brawn. Some journalists and pundits also consider the possibility of Hamilton being the greatest Formula One driver of all time.

Following Hamilton clinching a sixth World Drivers&#x27; Championship title in 2019, ex-Formula One driver and pundit Johnny Herbert acclaimed Hamilton as the greatest driver ever, while Formula One staff writer Greg Stuart described Hamilton as &quot;arguably the most complete Formula [One] driver ever&quot;. After Hamilton won his seventh title in 2020, John Watson stated that Hamilton &quot;is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time&quot;, and highlighted his fearlessness as being key to his success, as evidenced by his performance against double world champion team-mate Alonso in his rookie season and his decision to leave McLaren for Mercedes.

===Helmet===

From a young age, Hamilton&#x27;s helmet throughout his karting years was predominantly yellow with blue, green and red ribbons. In later years, a white ring was added and the ribbons were moved forward to make room for logos and advertisement space. Hamilton continued to run a yellow design throughout the early stages of his Formula One career, but in 2014 decided to switch to a white design with three red ribbons on the side. In 2016, Hamilton added three stars beneath the ribbons, representing each of his World Drivers&#x27; Championships. Hamilton selected his helmet design from fan submissions in 2017; the winning design used a white and yellow base colour with red and orange details. Over the following seasons, Hamilton began a tradition of adding more stars to his helmet upon winning each title.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grand Prix 24/7&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Having switched back to a 2014-inspired white-and-red design in 2018, Hamilton opted a different colour palette in 2020, which used matte black as base colour with purple details; he later added a Black Lives Matter emblem to the lid, in support of the movement. In 2022, he moved to a fluorescent yellow design, retaining the purple details and championship stars. Upon signing with Ferrari in 2025, Hamilton reverted to a design reminiscent of the early stages of his Formula One career, featuring yellow as the base color along with red accents and championship stars, complemented by the Ferrari emblem replacing the Mercedes logo.
Hamilton has used several one-off helmet designs across his career. Hamilton sported gold helmets for season finales three times in his career. After winning his fourth title in 2017, he entered the 2017 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in a gold helmet with four stars adorning the top of the helmet with the words &quot;World Champion&quot;. He used similar designs in 2018 and 2019 with five and six stars, respectively. This practice altered in 2020, when Hamilton wore his base helmet with gold outlines and accents, instead of a full gold design.
Hamilton has also used one-off helmet designs to pay tribute to his influential figures. He has continuously brought special helmet designs to Brazilian Grands Prix, in tribute to Ayrton Senna. Prior to the 2019 Monaco Grand Prix, three-time world champion and Mercedes team personnel Niki Lauda, who played pivotal role in Hamilton&#x27;s move to Mercedes, passed away. In tribute, Hamilton wore a special helmet design featuring Lauda&#x27;s classic red-and-white palette with his name printed on the back, honoring the influence Lauda had on his career. Other notable special designs include his rainbow helmet designs—used during the Qatar, Saudi Arabian and Abu Dhabi Grands Prix of 2021—in support of LGBTQ rights in the Middle East. Hamilton used unique designs for the Japanese Grand Prix in 2022 and 2023, designed by Japanese artists Takashi Murakami and Hajime Sorayama, respectively.

===Rivalries===
====Fernando Alonso====

Hamilton&#x27;s debut season saw him partner two-time and defending World Champion Fernando Alonso. In their time as teammates, tensions arose between the two drivers and McLaren as a result of several incidents. The first tensions surfaced after Hamilton finished second behind Alonso at Monaco in 2007. After post-race comments made by Hamilton which suggested he had been forced into a supporting role, the FIA investigated whether McLaren had broken rules by enforcing team orders. McLaren denied favouring Alonso, and the FIA subsequently vindicated the team, stating that &quot;McLaren were able to pursue an optimum team strategy because they had a substantial advantage over all other cars ... nothing which could be described as interfering with the race result.&quot;

Tensions surfaced again at the 2007 Hungarian Grand Prix, where during the final qualifying session Hamilton went out on track ahead of Alonso and ignored requests from the team to let him through: the two drivers had been taking turns on a race-by-race basis to lead during qualifying, which gave the leading driver an edge due to the fuel load regulations then in place, and Alonso was due to lead in Hungary. Hamilton was then delayed in the pits by Alonso and thus unable to set a final lap time before the end of the session. Alonso was relegated to sixth place on the starting grid thus promoting Hamilton, who had qualified second, to first, while McLaren was docked Constructors&#x27; Championship points. Hamilton said he thought the penalty was &quot;quite light if anything&quot; and only regretted the loss of points. Hamilton was reported to have sworn at Dennis on the team radio following the incident. British motorsport journal &quot;Autosport&quot; claimed that this &quot;[led] Dennis to throw his headphones on the pit wall in disgust: a gesture that was misinterpreted by many to be in reaction to Alonso&#x27;s pole&quot;; however, McLaren later issued a statement on behalf of Hamilton that denied the use of any profanity.

As a result of the events over the 2007 season, the relationship between Hamilton and Alonso reportedly collapsed, with the pair not on speaking terms for a short period. In the aftermath it was reported that Hamilton had been targeted by Luca di Montezemolo regarding a Ferrari drive for . The rivalry between the pair led to speculation that either Hamilton or Alonso would leave McLaren at the end of the season; Alonso and McLaren terminated their contract by mutual consent in November that year, ending his and Hamilton&#x27;s time as teammates. In subsequent years, tensions between the pair dissipated, and the mutual respect has grown, with Alonso praising Hamilton in 2017 saying &quot;[Hamilton] was able to win with a dominant car, with a good car like 2010 or 2012, or with bad cars like 2009 and 2011. Not all the champions can say that.&quot; Alonso later described Hamilton as one of the top five greatest drivers of all time. On the cool-down lap after Alonso&#x27;s final race before his two-year hiatus in 2018, Hamilton joined Sebastian Vettel in paying tribute to Alonso by driving, each on one side, in a formation to the start-finish straight where all three executed donuts.

Whilst teammates, Hamilton and Alonso won eight of 17 races held. Both drivers achieved four victories and 12 podium finishes, whilst Hamilton outqualified Alonso 10 of 17 times. At the end of their season as teammates, the pair were tied on 109 points, with Hamilton placing second and Alonso third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship by virtue of Hamilton having more second-place finishes.

====Nico Rosberg====
When Hamilton joined Mercedes in 2013, he was paired alongside old karting teammate and friend Nico Rosberg. Over their four seasons as teammates, a period of Mercedes dominance in Formula One, the pair&#x27;s relationship became strained and, at times, led to volatile confrontations on and off the track. Hamilton and Rosberg were first teammates in 2000, when they were in karting. They raced for Mercedes Benz McLaren in Formula A, where Hamilton became European champion, with Rosberg not far behind. Robert Kubica, who raced with them before Formula One, recalled how they were competitive both on and off the track, saying that &quot;they would even have races to eat pizza, always eating two at a time.&quot; Sports journalist Paul Weaver contrasts their upbringings; Rosberg was born in Germany and raised in Monaco as the son of World Drivers&#x27; Champion Keke Rosberg, whereas Hamilton was raised on a council estate in Stevenage to a father who worked multiple jobs to fund his son&#x27;s early karting career.

Pundit and commentator Will Buxton compared the character and driving styles of the pair, labelling Hamilton as the faster driver with more natural ability, as well as an intellect to match Rosberg&#x27;s. Buxton wrote:
Their old karting boss, Dino Chiesa, said Hamilton was the faster driver whereas Rosberg, who once said to Chiesa &quot;everything relates to physics and maths&quot;, was always more analytical. This led some to believe that Rosberg would achieve greater success in Formula One, the highest level of open-wheel racing, due to the intellectual capacity required to manage brakes, energy harvesting, tyre management, and moderate fuel usage. Hamilton&#x27;s tyre management has frequently allowed him to push on for longer, often enabling optimum race strategies, and his fuel usage has regularly been better than almost anyone on the grid. Sky Sport&#x27;s Mark Hughes, commented: &quot;Rosberg has a more scientific methodology, looks to fine-tune more specifically than Hamilton who typically tends just to find a balance he can work with, then adapt his driving around it.&quot;

In their time together as teammates, Hamilton and Rosberg won 54 of 78 races over four seasons. Hamilton had 32 victories, 55 podium finishes, and qualified ahead of Rosberg 42 times, while Rosberg had 22 victories, 50 podium finishes, and qualified ahead of Hamilton 36 times. During this period, Hamilton won two World Championship titles to Rosberg&#x27;s one, and scored more points in three out of their four seasons together.

====Sebastian Vettel====
Hamilton describes his rivalry with Sebastian Vettel as his favourite, believing their battles helped bring them closer together. After three years of Mercedes&#x27;s dominance from 2014 to 2016, Ferrari produced a car that was capable of fighting for the championship in 2017 and 2018. Vettel, who was then driving for Ferrari, enjoyed an early lead on points, but Mercedes and Hamilton fought back and ultimately won the championships in both seasons. While there were some on-track flash points, most notably the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix, when Vettel accused Hamilton of brake checking and drove into Hamilton in retaliation, earning a penalty, the pair developed a strong mutual respect in a hard but fairly contested fight. In 2021, Hamilton recalled:
===Public image and influence===
====Racist treatment====

The first and as of 2024 the only black driver to race in Formula One, Hamilton has been subject to racist abuse throughout his career. In 2007, Hamilton suffered racist abuse from Spanish Formula One supporters at the Chinese Grand Prix. In 2008, Hamilton was heckled and otherwise abused during pre-season testing at the Circuit de Catalunya by several Spanish spectators who wore black face paint and black wigs, as well as shirts bearing the words &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;. The FIA warned Spanish authorities about the repetition of such behaviour, and launched a &quot;Race Against Racism&quot; campaign. Shortly before the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, a website owned by the Spanish branch of the New York-based advertising agency TBWA and named &quot;pinchalaruedadeHamilton&quot;, which translates into English as &quot;burst Hamilton&#x27;s tyre&quot;, was featured in the British media. The site contained an image of Interlagos that allowed users to leave nails and porcupines on the track for Hamilton&#x27;s car to run over. Among thousands of comments left since 2007, some included racial insults. In 2021, Hamilton was subjected to online racist abuse following a controversial win at the British Grand Prix. Mercedes, Formula One, and the FIA issued a joint statement condemning the abuse and called for those responsible to be held accountable.

Hamilton&#x27;s treatment by the media and critics has, at times, been criticised as being racist. In 2014, &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Joseph Harker highlighted double-standards in Hamilton&#x27;s treatment compared to other British drivers by British newspapers, suggesting that his skin colour has played a factor in a perceived lack of acceptance among the British public. In 2019, footballer Rio Ferdinand described media scrutiny of Hamilton as having &quot;racist undertones&quot; and contrasted Hamilton&#x27;s treatment to that of fellow British driver Jenson Button. At the start of his Formula One career, Hamilton said that he &quot;tried to ignore the fact [he] was the first black guy ever to race in the sport&quot; but later stated that he had since grown to &quot;appreciate the implications&quot;, and changed his approach to promote equality within the sport. In 2019, Toto Wolff, Hamilton&#x27;s team boss at Mercedes, described how Hamilton was &quot;scarred for life&quot; by racist abuse inflicted during his childhood.

====Media reception====
In December 2018, Stevenage-born Hamilton caused controversy at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Awards where he said on live television, &quot;It really was a dream for us all as a family to do something different. For us to get out of the slums&quot; before immediately correcting himself, saying, &quot;Well, not the slums, but to get out of somewhere and do something. We all set our goals very, very high but we did it as a team.&quot; While Hamilton immediately sought to correct his remarks, the leader of Stevenage Borough Council described the comments as &quot;disappointing&quot; and observed that people felt &quot;very offended&quot;. Hamilton posted a video on Instagram in which he apologised for his comments, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m super proud of where I come from and I hope you know that I represent in the best way I can always ... Particularly when you are up in front of a crowd, trying to find the right words to express the long journey you&#x27;ve had in life, I chose the wrong words.&quot; The town mayor subsequently accepted his &quot;gracious apology&quot;.
Hamilton&#x27;s contribution and influence has been recognised regularly in the &quot;Powerlist&quot;, an annual list of the most influential Black Britons, in which he has ranked in the top 10 in 2016 and 2017. In 2021, Hamilton was named the most influential Black Briton in the 14th &quot;Powerlist&quot;, for his sporting success and his advocacy in the Black Lives Matter movement. In 2020, he was listed as one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 most influential people globally, and was knighted in the 2021 New Year Honours for services to motorsports.

Hamilton was one of several figures whose tax arrangements were singled out in a report by the charity Christian Aid in 2008. That year, Hamilton received criticism from UK members of parliament for avoiding UK taxes. Following the leak of the Paradise Papers in November 2017, it was reported that Hamilton had avoided paying £3.3 million of value added tax (VAT) on his private jet, worth £16.5 million. According to BBC &quot;Panorama&quot;, the leasing deal set up by his advisers appeared to be &quot;artificial&quot; and &quot;did not comply with an EU and UK ban on VAT refunds for private use&quot;. The BBC also said that Hamilton&#x27;s Instagram account provided evidence that the jet was used for personal trips. The jet was sold in September 2019. Whilst not residing in the UK, HMRC data published in 2019 puts Hamilton among the top 5,000 highest UK tax payers. Hamilton told &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2014: &quot;What people don&#x27;t realise is that I pay tax here [in the UK], but I don&#x27;t earn all my money here. I race in 19 different countries, so I earn my money in 20 different places and I pay tax in several different places, and I pay a lot here [UK] as well. I am contributing to the country.&quot;

==Other ventures==
===Activism and philanthropy===
====Diversity and anti-racism====

Hamilton is a prominent advocate against racism and for increased diversity in motorsport. In 2011—after being summoned to the stewards in five of the opening six rounds—Hamilton quipped, &quot;maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m black, that&#x27;s what Ali G says.&quot; In 2018, Hamilton criticised the lack of diversity in Formula One, stating &quot;nothing&#x27;s changed&quot; in the 11 years since his debut.

As part of the U.S. national anthem protests, Hamilton took the knee before every Grand Prix he entered in 2020, in support of Black Lives Matter, and wore t-shirts promoting racial justice. Following the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, Hamilton criticised prominent figures in Formula One for their silence on the issue, writing on Instagram:
Following Hamilton&#x27;s comments, several drivers and team executives reciprocated his views. Ross Brawn, managing director for Formula One, stated that the organisation &quot;supports [Hamilton] totally&quot;, describing Hamilton as &quot;a great ambassador for the sport&quot;. During the 2020 Tuscan Grand Prix weekend, including on the podium, Hamilton wore a t-shirt stating &quot;arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor&quot;. Following an investigation, the FIA barred drivers from wearing unofficial attire on the podium and in media interviews. In anticipation of the FIA&#x27;s decision, Hamilton said that he recognised that they have &quot;certain limits that they feel that they have to work within&quot;, but he &quot;[didn&#x27;t] regret a single moment of it&quot; and appreciated the &quot;really positive support from the fans&quot;.

In June 2020, Hamilton established &quot;The Hamilton Commission&quot; with the Royal Academy of Engineering, tasked with finding ways for motorsport to engage more black people with STEM subjects and increase employment in motorsport or other engineering sectors. In May 2021, Hamilton became the inaugural recipient of the Laureus Athlete Advocate of the Year Award. Hamilton founded &quot;Mission 44&quot; in July 2021, a charity designed to help young people from under-represented backgrounds achieve their ambitions in wider society. Hamilton pledged million to support the work of the charity. Mission 44 collaborates with a joint foundation between Hamilton and Mercedes called &quot;Ignite&quot;, which was also launched in July. Ignite focuses on increasing diversity in motorsport by improving opportunities in education and offering financial support.

====Human rights====
In December 2020, Hamilton confronted human rights in Bahrain and spoke out on allegations of sportswashing. Hamilton said he &quot;won&#x27;t let it go unnoticed&quot; after an 11-year-old boy wrote a letter to Hamilton asking him to save his father, who was facing the death penalty after making an alleged forced confession. Hamilton discussed the case with human rights organisations and legal experts, as well as Bahraini officials. He stated that whilst he has no authority over where he competes, drivers should not &quot;[go] to these countries and just [ignore] what is happening&quot;. 

Hamilton is also a supporter of LGBT rights, and strongly criticised the Hungarian government before the 2021 Hungarian Grand Prix for their anti-LGBT law. He also called out LGBT rights in Saudi Arabia before the inaugural , describing them as &quot;terrifying&quot;.

In May 2024, Hamilton called on Israel to halt its offensive in Rafah, Gaza, after an Israeli airstrike on the Tel al-Sultan refugee camp killed at least 45 civilians.

==== Environmental and animal rights ====
Hamilton has discussed environmental issues and animal rights in press conferences, interviews and documentaries. He has also used his social media platforms to gather support for his initiatives, which has included urging China to reclassify dogs as pets instead of livestock, backing charities against wildlife smuggling, and calling for the protection of the Amazon rainforest. 

In January 2020, Hamilton donated to causes relating to bushfires in Australia. He later announced his aim of being carbon neutral by the end of the year, explaining that he had mandated his office and household use recyclable items, sold his private jet, and planned to reduce his use of aircraft.

====UNICEF and #TOGETHERBAND====
In 2012, Hamilton began working with the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF). In March 2012, Hamilton travelled to the Philippines where he made a short film about Manila&#x27;s street children. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid and helped raise over £4.9 million for UNICEF. In October 2012, while in India for the Grand Prix, Hamilton visited a UNICEF-funded newborn care unit and nutrition centre. Hamilton said: &quot;As a sportsman in the public eye, I know I have a role to play in helping to tell the stories of the world&#x27;s most vulnerable children and I jumped at the chance to be able to do that again after a visit to Manila.&quot;

In 2014, Hamilton travelled to Haiti where he made a short film about child malnutrition. The film was shown on ITV1 during Soccer Aid, and helped raise over £6 million for UNICEF. In 2015, Hamilton took part in an exhibition to highlight UNICEF&#x27;s work and to celebrate its twenty-year partnership with Starwood Hotels. In June 2017, Hamilton joined the Super Dads initiative, a special UNICEF campaign that highlighted the critical role played by fathers in early childhood development.

Over the past decade, Hamilton has made time for a variety of causes, such as making donations and hospital visits to sick children. He has invited fans, young people, and their families to join him at Grand Prix races and social events. In 2013, he became the Global Education Ambassador for Save the Children, supporting and promoting its education campaigns. Two years later, Hamilton became the first ambassador for the Invictus Games Foundation, supporting wounded, injured, and sick servicemen and women. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Hamilton&#x27;s Neat Burger restaurant donated free meals to frontline NHS workers. Neat Burger also launched the &quot;Kids Eat Free&quot; scheme, serving free meals to school children during the half-term break.

Hamilton often donates personal and professional paraphernalia for charity auctions. He auctioned a racing kart and raised over £42,000 for St Thomas&#x27; Hospital baby charity. He raised £6,411 for the Small Steps Project in 2018, and £6,000 in 2019. In 2020, he raised another £4,000 for the Small Steps Project, while a donated race suit reportedly raised €20,000 for vulnerable children. Hamilton also frequently attends charitable functions, including the amfAR gala in New York, and has supported projects and charities such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Comic Relief, Rays of Sunshine, Children in Need, and Stevenage&#x27;s Keech Hospice Care Children&#x27;s Service, among others.

===Popular culture===
====Music====
Hamilton also has interests in music, saying that &quot;music has been a huge passion of mine since I was really young. I started playing guitar when I was 13. In here, I can be me, I can be vulnerable. I can show a side of me that people don&#x27;t get to see.&quot; He features on Christina Aguilera&#x27;s 2018 song &quot;Pipe&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;XNDA&quot;, although he did not confirm this until July 2020, when he revealed he had been writing and recording music for ten years.

==Personal life==
In 2017, Hamilton told the BBC that he had become vegan because &quot;[a]s the human race, what we are doing to the world ... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible. The cruelty is horrible and I don&#x27;t necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.&quot; In 2018 he was named the PETA Person of the Year for his vegan activism. The same year Hamilton said in an interview that he gave up drinking &quot;a while ago&quot;. 

Hamilton used the number 44 in karts, as his father&#x27;s Vauxhall Cavalier had the number plate &quot;F44&quot; when he started racing; it was his father&#x27;s idea to use it. New Formula One driver number regulations brought in for the season allowed drivers to pick a unique car number to use for the remainder of their careers, with Hamilton electing to compete under his old karting number 44. Before the start of the season, Hamilton announced he would not be exercising his option of switching his car number to 1, as was his prerogative as reigning World Champion, and would instead continue to race with his career No. 44. It was the first season since , when Alain Prost retired from the sport following his fourth and final World Drivers&#x27; Championship title in , that the field did not contain a car bearing the No. 1.

Hamilton is a fan of art and has said that one of his favourite artists is Andy Warhol. Prior to the 2014 United States Grand Prix, Hamilton wore a gold-framed version of Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Cars, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL Coupe&quot; painting hanging from a chain around his neck. From November 2007 to February 2015, Hamilton was in an on-and-off relationship with Nicole Scherzinger, the lead singer of the American girl group Pussycat Dolls.

Hamilton is a Catholic; he says that he prays regularly and is guided by his faith. Hamilton believes that he has the &quot;hand of God&quot; resting over him when racing in Formula One. Hamilton revealed in March 2022 that he was in the process of legally changing his name to include his mother&#x27;s maiden name, Larbalestier, as a middle name. Hamilton was made an honorary citizen of Brazil on 9 June 2022 after a proposal made by politician André Figueiredo was passed in the Brazilian Chamber of Deputies. In an interview in September 2024, Hamilton stated he has been battling depression from the age of 13.

===Legal issues===
Hamilton was suspended from driving in France for a month on 18 December 2007 after being caught speeding at on a French motorway. His Mercedes-Benz CLK was also impounded. Two days before the 2010 Australian Grand Prix, Victoria Police witnessed Hamilton &quot;deliberately losing traction&quot; in his silver Mercedes-AMG C63, and impounded the car for 48 hours. Hamilton immediately released a statement of apology for &quot;driving in an over-exuberant manner&quot;. After being charged with intentionally losing control of a vehicle, Hamilton was eventually fined A$500 (£288), being described as a &quot;hoon&quot; by the magistrate.

In 2017 Hamilton&#x27;s rights management company 44IP opposed Swatch Group&#x27;s application to register a trade mark for &quot;HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL&quot; in Europe for the sale of watches and timepieces. This was likely to have been encouraged, or even required, by Hamilton&#x27;s own watch sponsor. 44IP alleged that Swatch Group&#x27;s application was made in bad faith and that it was contrary to &quot;fair competition&quot; in relation to 44IP&#x27;s existing &quot;LEWIS HAMILTON&quot; mark. In 2020 the case was heard before the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO rejected 44IP&#x27;s arguments, ruling that there had been no bad faith by Swatch Group (with &quot;HAMILTON INTERNATIONAL&quot; having been used on relevant goods since 1892) and that 44IP&#x27;s &quot;LEWIS HAMILTON&quot; trade mark did not extend to the word &quot;HAMILTON&quot; alone for the purposes of protecting the existing mark.

===Residence===
Hamilton moved to Luins, Vaud, Switzerland, in 2007, citing privacy as his main reason for leaving the UK. He later said on the television show &quot;Parkinson&quot; that taxation was also a factor in his decision. In 2010, Hamilton, like many other Formula One drivers, moved to Monaco, purchasing a house worth a reported £10 million. Hamilton also owns an apartment in Manhattan, New York, which he bought for US$40 million in 2017, and an estate in Colorado where he has said he would live after his retirement.

===Wealth and income===
In 2015 Hamilton was ranked as the richest British sportsperson, with an estimated personal fortune of £88 million. In 2018 it was reported that Hamilton had a net worth of £159 million. In 2020 Hamilton&#x27;s fortune was an estimated £224 million, making him the richest British sports star in the history of the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot;. By 2022 that figure had increased to £300 million.

Before the 2015 Monaco Grand Prix weekend, Hamilton signed a contract to stay with Mercedes until the end of the 2018 season in a deal reportedly worth more than £100 million over the three years, making him one of the best-paid drivers in Formula One. In the week leading up to the 2018 German Grand Prix, Hamilton signed a two-year contract with Mercedes, reported to be worth up to £40 million per year, making him the best-paid driver in the history of Formula One. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, Hamilton was one of the highest-paid athletes of the 2010s decade, and also the highest-paid Formula One driver from 2013 to 2021.

<text>The Regent House is the governing body of the University of Cambridge. It consists of academics, senior researchers, heads of colleges, librarians, curators, and administrators. It currently has more than 7,200 members.

Meetings of the Regent House are known as congregations, and are chaired by the Proctors, the chancellor, the vice-chancellor, or the master of one of the colleges.

In recent times relatively few Congregations have actually been held. Instead most important business, including elections for members of the Council, the Board of Scrutiny and the Senate of the university, is conducted by postal ballots of its members. The main exceptions are the Congregations held to award degrees, the largest of which is at the end of Easter term, when undergraduates receive their degrees in sessions spread over three days known as General Admission. These Congregations are held in the university&#x27;s Senate House.

<doc id="675564" wikidata="Q1025261" url="?curid=675564" title="Cadillac V-16">
<text>The Cadillac V-16 (also known as the Cadillac Sixteen) was Cadillac&#x27;s top-of-the-line model from its January 1930 launch until 1940. The V16 powered car was a first in the United States, both extremely expensive and exclusive, with every chassis being custom-finished to order. Only 4,076 were constructed in its 11-year run, with the majority built in its debut year before the Great Depression took strong hold. The onset of World War II reduced the sales, resulting in its demise. It was, however, at least three times cheaper than Bugatti Royale (only 6 made).

== Genesis ==
In 1926, Cadillac began the development of a new, &quot;multi-cylinder&quot; car. A customer requirement was seen for a car powered by an engine simultaneously more powerful and smoother than any other available. Development proceeded in great secrecy over the next few years; a number of prototype cars were built and tested as the new engine was developed, while at the same time Cadillac chief Larry Fisher and GM&#x27;s stylist Harley Earl toured Europe in search of inspiration from Europe&#x27;s finest coachbuilders. Unlike many builders of luxury cars, who sold bare chassis to be clothed by outside coachbuilding firms, General Motors had purchased the coachbuilders Fleetwood Metal Body and Fisher Body to keep all the business in-house. Cadillac rolling stock chassis could be purchased if a buyer insisted, but the intention was that few would need to do so. One Cadillac dealer in England, namely Lendrum &amp; Hartman, ordered at least two such chassis in even rarer right hand drive (RHD) configuration and had Vanden Plas (Belgium) build first an elegant limousine-landaulet (engine #702297), then a sports sedan with unusual cycle fenders and retractable step plates in lieu of running boards (engine #702298, which was successfully shown in various Concours d&#x27;Elegance events in Europe before being bought by the young Nawab of Bahawalpur); both these cars have survived. A third RHD chassis was ordered by the Indian Maharaja of Orchha (Bhopal) and sent to Farina in Italy, in July 1931, for a boat tail body (engine between #703136 and #703152).

It was not until after the Wall Street crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that Cadillac announced to the world the availability of the costliest Cadillac yet, the new V-16 Series 452. The new vehicle was first displayed at New York City&#x27;s automobile show on January 4, 1930. Despite the bad timing and high retail price, and although sales would later drop off considerably, the launch &quot;exceeded Cadillac’s fondest aspirations.&quot;

== 1930–1937 ==
The Cadillac V-16 was distinguished by its pioneering V-16 engine, a narrow 45° V angle OHV Series 452 displacing .

Upon its introduction the new car attracted rave reviews from the press and huge public attention. January production averaged a couple of cars per day, then ramped up to twenty-two. By April, 1,000 units had been built, and by June, 2,000 cars. These could be ordered with a wide variety of bodywork. The Fleetwood catalog for the 1930 V-16 included 10 basic body styles; there was also an envelope containing some 30 additional designer&#x27;s drawings. Research by the Cadillac-La Salle Club, Inc. puts at 70 the number of different job/style numbers built by Fisher and Fleetwood on the Sixteen chassis.

Beginning in June 1930, five new V-16s participated in a promotional tour of major European cities including Paris, Antwerp, Brussels, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Berlin, Cologne, Dresden, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Nuremberg, Vienna (where they won prizes), Berne, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich, Madrid, San Sebastian, La Baule and Angers. On the return journey from Spain, the V16 caravan stopped also in the town of Cadillac, in south-western France, although that city bears no relationship to the marque, other than its name.

After the peak in V-16 orders in mid-1930, production fell precipitously. During October 1930, only 54 cars were built. The lowest figures for the 452/452A cars of 1930–31 were August 1931 (seven units) and November 1931 (six units). Minimum production continued throughout the rest of the decade with a mere 50 units being built both in 1935 and in 1937. 1940 was only marginally better with a total of 51 units. Not surprisingly, Cadillac later estimated that they lost money on every single V-16 they sold. The 1930 Town Brougham was listed at US$9,200 ($ in dollars ).

Production of the original V-16 continued under various model names through 1937. The body was redesigned in 1933 as the model 452C. Innovations included Fisher no draft individually controlled ventilation (I.C.V. or vent windows).

For 1934, the body was redesigned again and denoted as 452D, and as 452E in 1935. The V-16 now featured the Fisher Turret Top all-steel roof, though the cars were still built by Fleetwood. This same basic design would remain virtually unchanged through 1937. With a wheelbase of and a curb weight of up to these are perhaps the largest standard production cars ever produced in the United States. Combined production for the 1934 and 1935 model years was 150. It was redesignated the Series 90 in 1936 as Cadillac reorganized their model names. Fifty-two units were sold that year, with nearly half ordered as limousines. Hydraulic brakes were added for 1937, the last year of production, in which fifty vehicles were produced.

===1937 Cadillac V16 Hartman Cabriolet===
In 1937 Cadillac built fifty of their most expensive Series 90 V-16 chassis, and all but two were bodied in-house by Fleetwood. This chassis was delivered to Lausanne, Switzerland, to be bodied by Carrosserie Willy Hartmann per an order by local resident Philippe Barraud, a wealthy paper mill heir and playboy of the 1930s. Barraud wanted an outrageous, bespoke automobile to suit his stylish lifestyle. Stretching 22 feet in length, the car was designed in the sweeping cabriolet style of the Delahaye built by Figoni &amp; Falaschi for the 1936 Paris Auto Salon.

=== Production / Sales ===
1930 2,500&lt;br&gt;
1931 750&lt;br&gt;
1932 300&lt;br&gt;
1935 to 1937: 49 each year


== 1938–1940 ==

The V-16 &quot;Series 90&quot; and V-12 &quot;Series 80 and 85&quot;, were essentially merged for 1938 with the introduction of the new L-head V-16. The engine was an in-block valve (i.e. flathead) design, and featured a wider 135° V-angle, twin carburetors, twin fuel pumps, twin distributors, twin water pumps, and a nine main bearing crankshaft (compared to the OHV V-16&#x27;s five bearing crank) and produced the same as later versions of the original V-16. This engine was nearly silent at idle and exceptionally smooth in operation. The wheelbase was reduced to , the body remained in overall length. The &quot;Sixteens&quot; (as Cadillac referred to them) were basically series 75 cars with the new V-16 engine although they differed from the firewall forward from the V-8 cars and had several other trim differences. The instrument panels were identical to and changed yearly with the V-8 cars from 1938 to 1940. Only the &#x27;38 Sixteens had a horn button which had &quot;Sixteen&quot; in art deco script; the &#x27;39 and &#x27;40 models, like the V-8, had the Cadillac crest on the button. 315 were sold in the first year, 138 in the next. The production of the 1940 models ended in December 1939. The most expensive model documented was the 1940 Series 90 Town Car by Fleetwood at US$7,175 ($ in dollars ) using a wheelbase.

== Today ==
The Cadillac V-16 is today recognized as one of the finest automobiles of the prewar era by many authorities. The Classic Car Club of America rates all V-16s as CCCA Full Classics, a rating reserved for only the finest automobiles of the 1925–1948 period.

==Concept car==

In 2003, Cadillac created a concept car called the Sixteen, which used a 13.6 litre V-16 engine that developed . Even though it used the current &quot;A&amp;S&quot; (Art &amp; Science) style of design that is Cadillac&#x27;s stylistic hallmark, it shared many small details from the classic V-16. The Sixteen is also known to have the steering wheel logo carved out of solid crystal and a Bulgari clock.

<text>Rat Race is a 2001 American comedy film directed by Jerry Zucker. Inspired by Stanley Kramer&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;It&#x27;s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World&quot;, the film features an ensemble cast consisting of Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cuba Gooding Jr., Wayne Knight, Jon Lovitz, Kathy Najimy, Lanei Chapman, Breckin Meyer, Amy Smart, Seth Green, Vince Vieluf, John Cleese and Dave Thomas.

The film centers on six teams of people who are given the task of racing from a Las Vegas casino to a Silver City, New Mexico, train station where a storage locker contains a duffel bag filled with $2 million. Each team is given a key to the locker, and the first person to reach the locker gets the money.

Produced by Fireworks Pictures, Alphaville Films, and Zucker&#x27;s Zucker Productions, the film was released theatrically by Paramount Pictures on August 17, 2001, in the United States and Canada. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics, the film was a box office success, having grossed $85.5 million worldwide against a $48 million budget.

==Plot==

Eccentric hotel tycoon Donald Sinclair devises a game to entertain the high rollers who visit his Las Vegas casino. He arranges for six competitors to race the to Silver City, New Mexico, where $2 million is in a train station locker. Sinclair&#x27;s guests place bets on who will win.

The racers consist of brothers Duane and Blaine Cody, businesswoman Merrill Jennings and her mother Vera, disgraced football referee Owen Templeton, Randy Pear and his family, narcoleptic Italian tourist Enrico Pollini and no-nonsense attorney Nick Schaffer. Having initially agreed not to play, greed takes over and they start to race.

Duane and Blaine destroy the airport&#x27;s radar, grounding everybody else, but wrecking their own vehicle in the process so they rent another. They decide split up to better their chances and have a locksmith create a duplicate locker key, but the locksmith overhears their plan and instead makes off with the key in a hot air balloon. The brothers catch up to him after a wild goose chase, leaving him and a stray cow hanging from the balloon&#x27;s anchor rope. Later, after Blaine is distracted by two attractive women driving beside them on the road, they veer off of it and their rental car is crushed by a monster truck, which they steal to get to Silver City.

Merrill and Vera are given malicious directions by a woman selling squirrels as pets on the side of the road, and crash into a pile of other totaled vehicles containing her previous deceased victims. After venturing through the Mojave Desert, they steal a rocket car until it runs out of fuel. Left disoriented due to the car&#x27;s extreme speed, they then accidentally stumble onto a busload of mental patients headed for Silver City.

Owen is kicked out of a taxi for a bad call he made at a football game that caused the driver to lose a bet. Now without most of his clothes or other belongings, he then dupes and impersonates the driver of a bus on the way to transport a large group of Lucille Ball cosplayers to a convention, much to his dismay. After the cosplayers flood the bus with suds, he later hits the cow dangling from the balloon and crashes the bus. After the cosplayers lose the only spare wheel, Owen reveals that he is not the real driver and the enraged women chase him down the road. He escapes them and steals a horse to ride to Silver City.

Randy and his family, at the insistence of their daughter Kimberly after he forces her to defecate out of the window of their mini-van to avoid stopping, visit a museum dedicated to a famous Nazi, Klaus Barbie, mistakenly believing it to be about Barbie the doll. After the family (who are Jewish) awkwardly leave the museum, they steal Adolf Hitler&#x27;s staff car after Duane and Blaine sabotage their mini-van. While driving the staff car, the family is attacked by an all-female biker gang and Randy, who burns his tongue after the dashboard cigarette lighter accidentally ejects directly into his mouth, drives them into a large gathering honoring World War II veterans, unaware of how his slurred speech and disheveled appearance insults them. Later at a diner when his family insist they end the trip, Randy drugs them by slipping sleeping pills into their milkshakes and bundles them into a semi-truck heading for Silver City.

Nick chooses not to participate, but changes his mind when he meets Tracy Faucet, an independent pilot who gives him a lift in her helicopter. She decides to visit her boyfriend on the way, who she finds cheating on her with another woman in his backyard, so she attacks him by using the helicopter to chase him into the desert. Now having damaged her helicopter and with police on the way to arrest them, she and Nick steal her ex-boyfriend&#x27;s truck together and form a romantic relationship while driving to Silver City.

Enrico is more excited by the race than the money, but falls asleep standing up in the hotel lobby, only waking hours later. He gets a ride from Zack, an ambulance driver delivering a transplant heart, who offers Enrico a lift in order to avoid a lawsuit from Gloria Allred, who witnessed Zack hit him with his van. Enrico inadvertently drops the heart out of the window, whereupon it is stolen by a stray dog, which is then electrocuted on an electric fence. Deeming the heart unusable, Zack plans to kill Enrico, who has no family or friends, to replace the missing heart. However, Enrico escapes by jumping onto a passing train, where he drops his locker key in a baby&#x27;s diaper and, while retrieving it, is mistaken for a pedophile by the parents. He is thrown out at Silver City Station and is the first to reach the locker, only to fall asleep before opening it.

The racers reunite in Silver City and fight to open the locker, only to find it empty. Outside, Sinclair&#x27;s assistant Grisham and call girl, Vicki, are making off with the money. The locksmith, still attached to the runaway balloon, suddenly appears and maneuvers it to drop the cow on Grisham and Vicki. He then ties the money bag to the balloon, but it accidentally slips out of his grip and into the sky. The racers chase the balloon to a charity concert where Smash Mouth are performing, and the band and crowd mistake the money for a donation. Once the racers see what a global difference the money could make, they have a change of heart and decide to donate it all. Sinclair and his patrons arrive at the scene and Nick horrifies them by announcing they will match the money raised. Sinclair is distraught as the donations total shoots past $19 million, and the racers celebrate by dancing and crowd-surfing to &quot;All Star&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Rat Race&quot; was initially written by Darryl Quarles as a spec script. By February 1999, the script had been sold to Hollywood Pictures and producer Jerry Bruckheimer. In August 1999, Jerry Zucker was in negotiations to direct the film for Paramount Pictures from a screenplay written by Andy Breckman that would be set in Las Vegas, Nevada and in New Mexico.

Paramount hoped to begin production of the film in the end of 1999 or the beginning of 2000. Jerry and Janet Zucker were to produce the film alongside Sean Daniel, while Daniel&#x27;s partner in Alphaville Films, James Jacks, would serve as executive producer. The filmmakers initially considered having the film&#x27;s characters race from Las Vegas, Nevada, to Las Vegas, New Mexico, but the idea was rejected following concerns that it might confuse viewers.

In January 2000, Las Vegas, Nevada was confirmed as a filming location for &quot;Rat Race&quot;. Location scouting in southern Nevada was scheduled for May 2000, while filming in the area was delayed until the fall of 2000, to avoid shooting the film in one hundred degree summer heat. Breckin Meyer and Amy Smart were cast in the film in June 2000, while Dean Cain also joined the cast in October.

Actor John Cleese praised the script as one of only two scripts during his career that he enjoyed: &quot;It&#x27;s so unusual to get a top class script. Twice in my life I&#x27;ve had the experience of reading a script and simply saying, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to do this.

===Filming===
Filming began in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in August 2000. Filming took place primarily along Calgary&#x27;s highways, which stood in as highways that the characters travel on in Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico. Desert scenes were shot in the Canadian town of Drumheller. Second unit filming began in Las Vegas on August 7, 2000, with scenes primarily involving Cuba Gooding Jr.

Scheduled filming locations included the Las Vegas Strip, Tropicana Avenue (east of the Las Vegas Strip), McCarran International Airport, and Nevada State Route 159. Other scheduled filming locations in Nevada included Goodsprings and Sandy Valley.

Scenes involving Gooding and the group of Lucy impersonators were shot in the Canadian Rockies. Jerry Zucker, who had a tradition of including his mother Charlotte in each of his films beginning with &quot;Airplane!&quot;, had her portray one of the Lucy impersonators. Jerry Zucker said, &quot;It&#x27;s like the Alfred Hitchcock signature. Instead of me, it&#x27;s mom.&quot; Filming also took place at Calgary&#x27;s former Currie Barracks military base, which had been converted to accommodate film and television productions.

Sound stages were constructed inside two aircraft hangars at the base to be used for many of the film&#x27;s interior scenes, including the Venetian&#x27;s hotel rooms and conference room. Driving scenes, using green screens and rear projection effects, were also shot inside the hangars. The scene with the coin toss by Owen Templeton was filmed at Calgary&#x27;s McMahon Stadium during a game on September 4.

Filming returned to Las Vegas for a nine-day period beginning on September 20, 2000, with the first three days spent at the McCarran International Airport, before moving to the Venetian resort on the Las Vegas Strip for a six-day shoot. Venetian officials negotiated with Paramount for six months to use the resort in the film. Scenes were shot throughout the Venetian, with the exception of its hotel rooms. Venetian scenes included the casino, lobby, and the entrance to its valet parking garage, as well as exterior shots of the resort. Approximately 1,000 background extras were needed during the second Las Vegas shoot. On September 25, 2000, second unit filming took place along Nevada State Route 161, leading to Goodsprings.

Filming in Las Vegas concluded on September 29, 2000, and production moved to Ely, Nevada, which stood in as Silver City, New Mexico. Ely&#x27;s Nevada Northern Railway Museum stood in as the Silver City train station. According to the Nevada Film Office, the filmmakers &quot;fell in love&quot; with the museum after being shown pictures of it. As a result, the initial two day shoot in Ely was extended to six days. Ely&#x27;s western entrance, accessed from U.S. Route 50, was used as the entrance to Silver City.

After concluding in Ely, production crews relocated to southern California for the final six weeks of filming, mainly for exterior scenes. California filming primarily occurred in Antelope Valley, Palmdale, Acton, Santa Clarita, and Newhall. Rosamond, California was also a primary location, with filming occurring during a three-week period in October 2000. Smart&#x27;s helicopter scenes were filmed at 3118 Carnation Street in Rosamond. Additional filming in California occurred at Big Sky Ranch and El Mirage Lake.

Sinclair and the gamblers&#x27; eccentric habits are further exaggerated in deleted scenes, where they partake in many more ridiculous bets, including playing &quot;Monopoly&quot; with real money. In another scene, a high roller pretends to find what they are doing immoral. Professional wrestler Diamond Dallas Page and his then wife, Kimberly, had a cameo that was cut when test audiences failed to give his appearance any reaction. The scene is available on the DVD release.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Rat Race&quot; was released in both the United States and Canada on August 17, 2001, and grossed US$11,662,094 in its opening weekend at the North American box office, ranking third behind &quot;American Pie 2&quot; and &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;. The film ultimately grossed $56.6 million domestically and $28.8 million overseas for a worldwide total of approximately $85.5 million based on a budget of an estimated $48 million, making it commercially successful.

The film was released in the United Kingdom on January 11, 2002, and opened also at number three behind the non-comedic &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. For the next two weekends, the film retained the spot, before moving down one place and then four places down before finally ending up on No. 10 on February 10, 2002.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 45% based on 128 reviews, with an average rating of 5.00/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Rat Race&quot; moves from one sight gag to another, but only a handful of them are genuinely funny.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 52 based on 26 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an above average grade of &quot;B+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Jo Berry of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three stars out of five and wrote, &quot;Ex-Saturday Night Live writer Breckman piles on the gags for this daft chase movie. It&#x27;s incredibly silly, but also rib-ticklingly funny.&quot;

<text>Van Maanen 2, or van Maanen&#x27;s Star, is the closest known solitary white dwarf to the Solar System. It is a dense, compact stellar remnant no longer generating energy and has equivalent to about 68% of the Sun&#x27;s mass but only 1% of its radius. At a distance of 14.1 light-years it is the third closest of its type of star after Sirius B and Procyon B, in that order. Discovered in 1917 by Dutch–American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen, Van Maanen 2 was the third white dwarf identified, after 40 Eridani B and Sirius B, and the first solitary example.

==Observation history==
While searching for a companion to the large-proper-motion star Lalande 1299, in 1917 Dutch–American astronomer Adriaan van Maanen discovered this star with an even larger proper motion a few arcminutes to the northeast. He estimated the annual proper motion of the latter as 3 arcseconds. This star had been captured on a plate taken November 11, 1896 for the Carte du Ciel Catalog of Toulouse and it showed an apparent magnitude of 12.3. Prominent absorption features of calcium K-line to H-beta in the spectrum led van Maanen to assign it a spectral classification of F0, and it was initially known as &quot;van Maanen&#x27;s F star&quot;.

In 1918, American astronomer Frederick Seares obtained a refined visual magnitude of 12.34, but the distance to the star remained unknown. Two years later, van Maanen published a parallax estimate of 0.246″, giving it an absolute magnitude of +14.8. This made it the faintest F-type star known at that time. In 1923, Dutch-American astronomer Willem Luyten published a study of stars with large proper motions in which he identified what he called &quot;van Maanen&#x27;s star&quot; as one of only three known white dwarfs, a term he coined. These are stars that have an unusually low absolute magnitude for their spectral class, lying well below the main sequence on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram of stellar temperature vs. luminosity.

The high mass density of white dwarfs was demonstrated in 1925 by American astronomer Walter Adams when he measured the gravitational redshift of Sirius B as 21 km/s. In 1926, British astrophysicist Ralph Fowler used the new theory of quantum mechanics to show that these stars are supported by electron gas in a degenerate state. British astrophysicist Leon Mestel demonstrated in 1952 that the energy they emit is the surviving heat from bygone nuclear fusion. He showed that the latter no longer occurs within a white dwarf, and calculated the internal temperature of van Maanen 2 as . He gave a preliminary age estimate of 1011/&quot;A&quot; years, where &quot;A&quot; is the mean atomic weight of the nuclei in the star.

In 2016, it was discovered that a spectrographic plate of the star made in 1917 gives evidence – the earliest known – of planetary matter outside the Solar System, in the form of calcium absorption lines that indicate the presence of planetary material polluting the stellar atmosphere.

==Characteristics==
Van Maanen 2 is from the Sun in the constellation Pisces, about 2° to the south of the star Delta Piscium, with a relatively high proper motion of 2.978″ annually along a position angle of 155.538°. It is closer to the Sun than any other solitary white dwarf. It is too faint to be seen with the naked eye. Like other white dwarfs, it is a very dense star: its mass has been estimated to be about 67% of the Sun&#x27;s, yet it has only 1% of the Sun&#x27;s radius (1.23 times the Earth&#x27;s radius). The outer atmosphere has a temperature of approximately 6,110 K, which is relatively cool for a white dwarf. As all white dwarfs steadily radiate away their heat over time, this temperature can be used to estimate its age, thought to be around 3 billion years.

The progenitor of this white dwarf had an estimated 2.6 solar masses and remained on the main sequence for about 900 million years. This gives the star an overall age of about 4.1 billion years. When this star left the main sequence, it expanded into a red giant that reached a maximum radius of 1,000 times the current radius of the Sun, or about 4.6 astronomical units. Any planets orbiting within this radius would have been engulfed in the star&#x27;s extent.

The stellar classification of Van Maanen 2 is DZ8, having a helium atmosphere with a significant presence of heavier elements in its spectrum – what astronomers term metals. Indeed, this star is the prototype (archetype in practice) for DZ white dwarfs. Physical models of white dwarfs used by today&#x27;s astrophysicists show that elements with mass greater than helium would sink, all things being equal, below the photosphere, leaving hydrogen and helium to be visible in the spectrum; for heavier elements to appear here requires a recent external source. It is unlikely that they were obtained from the interstellar medium, since that is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. Instead, the surface of the star was likely strewn with circumstellar material, such as from the remains of one or more rocky, terrestrial planets. Later observations with the International Ultraviolet Explorer detected calcium, magnesium and iron.

The total mass of metals in the atmosphere of Van Maanen 2 is estimated to be around 1021 g—about the same mass as a large moon such as Ariel. These pollutants will sink deeper into the atmosphere on time scales of around three million years, which indicates the material is being replenished at a rate of 107 g/s. These materials could have been accreted in the form of multiple planetesimals smaller than around 84 km colliding with the star.

White dwarfs with a spectrum that indicates high levels of metal contamination of the photosphere often have a circumstellar disk. In the case of van Maanen 2, observations at a wavelength of 24 μm do not show the infrared excess that might be generated by a dusty disk. Instead there is a noticeable deficit. The predicted flux at 24 μm is 0.23 mJy, whereas the measured value is . This deficit may be explained by collision-induced absorption in the atmosphere of the star, as seen in certain white dwarfs that have temperatures below 4,000 K, as a result of collisions between hydrogen molecules or between hydrogen molecules and helium.

A paper published in 2015 found that, based upon the space velocity of this star, it made the closest approach 15,070 years ago as then it was from the Sun, although it uses an outdated and unreliable radial velocity measurement.

==Possible companion==
The possibility of a substellar companion remains uncertain. As of 2004, one paper claimed detection of this, while another discounted this. As of 2008, observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope appear to rule out any companions within 1,200 AU of the star that have four Jupiter masses or greater. No potential proper motion companions have been identified between an angular separation of out to 10°, ruling out objects with a mass of or greater.

As of 2022 a candidate planet was detected via astrometry, with a mass between 0.4 and 1.1 Jupiter masses.

<doc id="675582" wikidata="Q583314" url="?curid=675582" title="New antisemitism">
<text>New antisemitism is the concept that a new form of antisemitism developed in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, typically manifesting itself as anti-Zionism. The concept is included in some definitions of antisemitism, such as the working definition of antisemitism and the 3D test of antisemitism. The concept dates to the early 1970s.

Proponents of the concept generally posit that in the late 20th and early 21st centuries much of what is purported to be criticism of Israel is in fact tantamount to demonization, and that together with evidence of a resurgence of antisemitic attacks on Jews, desecration of Jewish symbols and Judaism, Holocaust denial, and an increased acceptance of antisemitic beliefs in public discourse and online hate speech, such demonization represents an evolution in the appearance of antisemitic beliefs. Proponents argue that anti-Zionism and demonization of Israel, or double standards applied to its conduct (some also include anti-Americanism, anti-globalization, and Third-Worldism) may be linked to antisemitism, or constitute disguised antisemitism, particularly when emanating simultaneously from the far-left, Islamism, and the far-right.

Critics of the concept argue that it is used in practice to weaponize antisemitism in order to silence political debate and freedom of speech regarding the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict, by conflating political anti-Zionism and criticism of the Israeli government with racism, condoning violence against Jews or likening the Israeli government&#x27;s actions to the Holocaust. Such arguments have in turn been criticized as antisemitic and rhetorically irrelevant to the contested reality of new antisemitism. Further critical arguments include that the concept defines legitimate criticism of Israel too narrowly and demonization too broadly, and that it trivializes the meaning of antisemitism.

== History of the concept ==

=== 1960s: origins ===
French philosopher Pierre-André Taguieff argues that the first wave of &quot;la nouvelle judéophobie&quot; emerged in the Arab-Muslim world and the Soviet sphere following the 1967 Six-Day War. He cites papers by Jacques Givet (1968) and historian Léon Poliakov (1969) discussing the idea of a new antisemitism rooted in anti-Zionism. He argues that anti-Jewish themes centered on the demonical figures of Israel and what he calls &quot;fantasy-world Zionism&quot;: that Jews plot together, seek to conquer the world, and are imperialistic and bloodthirsty, which gave rise to the reactivation of stories about ritual murder and the poisoning of food and water supplies.

=== 1970s: early debates ===
Writing in the American Jewish Congress&#x27; &quot;Congress Bi-Weekly&quot; in 1973, the Foreign Minister of Israel Abba Eban identified anti-Zionism as &quot;the new anti-Semitism&quot;, saying:
[R]ecently we have witnessed the rise of the new left which identifies Israel with the establishment, with acquisition, with smug satisfaction, with, in fact, all the basic enemies ... Let there be no mistake: the new left is the author and the progenitor of the new anti-Semitism. One of the chief tasks of any dialogue with the Gentile world is to prove that the distinction between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism is not a distinction at all. Anti-Zionism is merely the new anti-Semitism. The old classic anti-Semitism declared that equal rights belong to all individuals within the society, except the Jews. The new anti-Semitism says that the right to establish and maintain an independent national sovereign state is the prerogative of all nations, so long as they happen not to be Jewish. And when this right is exercised not by the Maldive Islands, not by the state of Gabon, not by Barbados ... but by the oldest and most authentic of all nationhoods, then this is said to be exclusivism, particularism, and a flight of the Jewish people from its universal mission.

In 1974, Arnold Forster and Benjamin Epstein of the Anti-Defamation League published the book &quot;The New anti-Semitism&quot;. They expressed concern about what they described as new manifestations of antisemitism coming from radical left, radical right, and pro-Arab figures in the U.S. Forster and Epstein argued that it took the form of indifference to the fears of the Jewish people, apathy in dealing with anti-Jewish bias, and an inability to understand the importance of Israel to Jewish survival.
Reviewing Forster and Epstein&#x27;s work in &quot;Commentary&quot;, Earl Raab, founding director of the Nathan Perlmutter Institute for Jewish Advocacy at Brandeis University, argued that a &quot;new anti-Semitism&quot; was indeed emerging in America, in the form of opposition to the collective rights of the Jewish people, but he criticized Forster and Epstein for conflating it with anti-Israel bias. Allan Brownfeld wrote in the &quot;Journal of Palestine Studies&quot; that Forster and Epstein&#x27;s new definition of antisemitism trivialized the concept by turning it into &quot;a form of political blackmail&quot; and &quot;a weapon with which to silence any criticism of either Israel or U.S. policy in the Middle East,&quot; while Edward S. Shapiro, in &quot;A Time for Healing: American Jewry Since World War II&quot;, has written that &quot;Forster and Epstein implied that the new anti-Semitism was the inability of Gentiles to love Jews and Israel enough.&quot;

=== 1980s–present day: continued debate ===

Historian Robert Wistrich addressed the issue in a 1984 lecture delivered in the home of Israeli President Chaim Herzog, in which he argued that a &quot;new anti-Semitic anti-Zionism&quot; was emerging, distinguishing features of which were the equation of Zionism with Nazism and the belief that Zionists had actively collaborated with Nazis during World War II. He argued that such claims were prevalent in the Soviet Union, but added that similar rhetoric had been taken up by a part of the radical Left, particularly Trotskyist groups in Western Europe and America.

When asked in 2014 if &quot;anti-Zionism is the new anti-Semitism&quot;, Noam Chomsky stated:
Actually, the locus classicus, the best formulation of this, was by an ambassador to the United Nations, Abba Eban, ... He advised the American Jewish community that they had two tasks to perform. One task was to show that criticism of the policy, what he called anti-Zionism that means actually criticisms of the policy of the state of Israel were anti-Semitism. That&#x27;s the first task. Second task, if the criticism was made by Jews, their task was to show that it&#x27;s neurotic self-hatred, needs psychiatric treatment. Then he gave two examples of the latter category. One was I.F. Stone. The other was me. So, we have to be treated for our psychiatric disorders, and non-Jews have to be condemned for anti-Semitism, if they&#x27;re critical of the state of Israel. That&#x27;s understandable why Israeli propaganda would take this position. I don&#x27;t particularly blame Abba Eban for doing what ambassadors are sometimes supposed to do. But we ought to understand that there is no sensible charge. No sensible charge. There&#x27;s nothing to respond to. It&#x27;s not a form of anti-Semitism. It&#x27;s simply criticism of the criminal actions of a state, period.
== Definitions and arguments for and against the concept ==

=== A new phenomenon ===
Irwin Cotler, Professor of Law at McGill University and a scholar of human rights, has identified nine aspects of what he considers to constitute the &quot;new anti-Semitism&quot;:
* Genocidal antisemitism: calling for the destruction of Israel and/or the Jewish people.
* Political antisemitism: denial of the Jewish people&#x27;s right to self-determination, de-legitimization of Israel as a state, attributions to Israel of all the world&#x27;s evils.
* Ideological antisemitism: &quot;Nazifying&quot; Israel by comparing Zionism and racism.
* Theological antisemitism: convergence of Islamic antisemitism and Christian &quot;replacement&quot; theology, drawing on the classical hatred of Jews.
* Cultural antisemitism: the emergence of anti-Israel attitudes, sentiments, and discourse in &quot;fashionable&quot; salon intellectuals.
* Economic antisemitism: BDS movements and the extraterritorial application of restrictive covenants against countries trading with Israel.
* Holocaust denial.
* Anti-Jewish racist terrorism.
* International legal discrimination (&quot;Denial to Israel of equality before the law in the international arena&quot;).

Cotler defines &quot;classical or traditional anti-Semitism&quot; as &quot;the discrimination against, denial of or assault upon the rights of Jews to live as equal members of whatever host society they inhabit&quot; and &quot;new anti-Semitism&quot; as &quot;discrimination against the right of the Jewish people to live as an equal member of the family of nationsthe denial of and assault upon the Jewish people&#x27;s right even to livewith Israel as the &quot;collective Jew among the nations.&quot;

Cotler elaborated on this position in a June 2011 interview for Israeli television. He re-iterated his view that the world is &quot;witnessing a new and escalating ... and even lethal anti-Semitism&quot; focused on hatred of Israel, but cautioned that this type of antisemitism should not be defined in a way that precludes &quot;free speech&quot; and &quot;rigorous debate&quot; about Israel&#x27;s activities. Cotler said that it is &quot;too simplistic to say that anti-Zionism, &quot;per se&quot;, is anti-Semitic&quot; and argued that labelling Israel as an apartheid state, while in his view &quot;distasteful&quot;, is &quot;still within the boundaries of argument&quot; and not inherently antisemitic. He continued: &quot;It&#x27;s [when] you say, because it&#x27;s an apartheid state, [that] it has to be dismantledthen [you&#x27;ve] crossed the line into a racist argument, or an anti-Jewish argument.&quot;

Jack Fischel, former chair of history at Millersville University of Pennsylvania, writes that new antisemitism is a new phenomenon stemming from a coalition of &quot;leftists, vociferously opposed to the policies of Israel, and right-wing antisemites, committed to the destruction of Israel, [who] were joined by millions of Muslims, including Arabs, who immigrated to Europe... and who brought with them their hatred of Israel in particular and of Jews in general.&quot; It is this new political alignment, he argues, that makes new antisemitism unique. Mark Strauss of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; links new antisemitism to anti-globalism, describing it as &quot;the medieval image of the &quot;Christ-killing&quot; Jew resurrected on the editorial pages of cosmopolitan European newspapers.&quot;

Rajesh Krishnamachari, researcher with the South Asia Analysis Group, analyzed antisemitism in Iran, Turkey, Palestine, Pakistan, Malaysia, Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia and posited that the recent surge in antisemitism across the Muslim world should be attributed to political expediency of the local elite in these countries rather than to any theological imperative.

The French philosopher Pierre-André Taguieff argues that antisemitism based on racism and nationalism has been replaced by a new form based on anti-racism and anti-nationalism. He identifies some of its main features as the identification of Zionism with racism; the use of material related to Holocaust denial (such as doubts about the number of victims and allegations that there is a &quot;Holocaust industry&quot;); a discourse borrowed from third worldism, anti-imperialism, anti-colonialism, anti-Americanism and anti-globalization; and the dissemination of what he calls the &quot;myth&quot; of the &quot;intrinsically good Palestinianthe innocent victim &quot;par excellence&quot;.&quot;

In early 2009, 125 parliamentarians from various countries gathered in London for the founding conference of a group called the &quot;Interparliamentary Coalition for Combating Anti-Semitism&quot; (ICCA). They suggest that while classical antisemitism &quot;overlaps&quot; modern antisemitism, it is a different phenomenon and a more dangerous one for Jews.

=== A new phenomenon, but not antisemitism ===

Brian Klug, senior research fellow in philosophy at St Benet&#x27;s Hall, Oxfordwho gave expert testimony in February 2006 to a British parliamentary inquiry into antisemitism in the UK, and in November 2004 to the Hearing on Anti-Semitism at the German Bundestagargues against the idea that there is a &quot;single, unified phenomenon&quot; that could be called &quot;new&quot; antisemitism. He accepts that there is reason for the Jewish community to be concerned, but argues that any increase in antisemitic incidents is attributable to classical antisemitism. Proponents of the new antisemitism concept, he writes, see an organizing principle that allows them to formulate a new concept, but it is only in terms of this concept that many of the examples cited in evidence of it count as examples in the first place. That is, the creation of the concept may be based on a circular argument or tautology. He argues that it is an unhelpful concept, because it devalues the term &quot;antisemitism,&quot; leading to widespread cynicism about the use of it. People of goodwill who support the Palestinians resent being falsely accused of antisemitism.

Klug defines classical antisemitism as &quot;an ingrained European fantasy about Jews as Jews,&quot; arguing that whether Jews are seen as a race, religion, or ethnicity, and whether antisemitism comes from the right or the left, the antisemite&#x27;s image of the Jew is always as &quot;a people set apart, not merely by their customs but by their collective character. They are arrogant, secretive, cunning, always looking to turn a profit. Loyal only to their own, wherever they go they form a state within a state, preying upon the societies in whose midst they dwell. Mysteriously powerful, their hidden hand controls the banks and the media. They will even drag governments into war if this suits their purposes. Such is the figure of &#x27;the Jew,&#x27; transmitted from generation to generation.&quot;
He argues that although it is true that the new antisemitism incorporates the idea that antisemitism is hostility to Jews as Jews, the source of the hostility has changed; therefore, to continue using the same expression for itantisemitismcauses confusion. Today&#x27;s hostility to Jews as Jews is based on the Arab–Israeli conflict, not on ancient European fantasies. Israel proclaims itself as the state of the Jewish people, and many Jews align themselves with Israel for that very reason. It is out of this alignment that the hostility to Jews as Jews arises, rather than hostility to Israelis or to Zionists. Klug agrees that it is a prejudice, because it is a generalization about individuals; nevertheless, he argues, it is &quot;not rooted in the ideology of &#x27;the Jew&#x27;,&quot; and is therefore a different phenomenon from antisemitism.

In 2006, Norman Finkelstein argued that there has been no significant rise in antisemitism: &quot;What does the evidence show? There has been good investigation done, serious investigation. All the evidence shows there&#x27;s no evidence at all for a rise of a new anti-Semitism, whether in Europe or in North America. The evidence is zero. And, in fact, there&#x27;s a new book put out by an Israel stalwart. His name is Walter Laqueur, a very prominent scholar. It&#x27;s called &quot;The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism&quot;. It just came out, 2006, from Oxford University Press. He looks at the evidence, and he says no. There&#x27;s some in Europe among the Muslim community, there&#x27;s some anti-Semitism, but the notion that in the heart of European society or North American society there&#x27;s anti-Semitism is preposterous. And in factor no, a significant rise in anti-Semitism is preposterous.&quot;

In 2023, according to the FBI, antisemitic hate crimes in the United States surged 63 percent to 1,832 recorded incidents, the highest on record.  Antisemitic incidents represented 15% of all hate crimes and 68% of all religion-based hate crimes, though Jews only make up about 2% of the population. In 2024, reports of bomb threats to synagogues, antisemitic harassment, vandalism and assault reached record-high numbers in four of the past six years in the United States.

=== Criticism of Israel is not always antisemitism ===
The 3D Test of Antisemitism is a set of criteria put forth by Natan Sharansky to distinguish legitimate criticism of Israel from antisemitism. The three Ds stand for Delegitimization of Israel, Demonization of Israel, and subjecting Israel to Double standards, each of which, according to the test, indicates antisemitism. The test is intended to draw the line between legitimate criticism towards the State of Israel, its actions and policies, and non-legitimate criticism that becomes antisemitic.

Earl Raab writes that &quot;[t]here is a new surge of antisemitism in the world, and much prejudice against Israel is driven by such antisemitism,&quot; but argues that charges of antisemitism based on anti-Israel opinions generally lack credibility. He writes that &quot;a grave educational misdirection is imbedded in formulations suggesting that if we somehow get rid of antisemitism, we will get rid of anti-Israelism. This reduces the problems of prejudice against Israel to cartoon proportions.&quot; Raab describes prejudice against Israel as a &quot;serious breach of morality and good sense,&quot; and argues that it is often a bridge to antisemitism, but distinguishes it from antisemitism as such.

Steven Zipperstein, professor of Jewish Culture and History at Stanford University, argues that a belief in the State of Israel&#x27;s responsibility for the Arab-Israeli conflict is considered &quot;part of what a reasonably informed, progressive, decent person thinks.&quot; He argues that Jews have a tendency to see the State of Israel as a victim because they were very recently themselves &quot;the quintessential victims&quot;.

=== Accusations of misuse of the term to stifle criticism of Israel ===

Norman Finkelstein argues that organizations such as the Anti-Defamation League have brought forward charges of new antisemitism at various intervals since the 1970s, &quot;not to fight antisemitism but rather to exploit the historical suffering of Jews in order to immunize Israel against criticism&quot;. He writes that most evidence purporting to show a new antisemitism has been taken from organizations that are linked in some way to Israel, or that have &quot;a material stake in inflating the findings of anti-Semitism,&quot; and that some antisemitic incidents reported in recent years either did not occur or were misidentified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finkelstein66/68&quot;&gt;Finkelstein, Norman. &quot;Beyond Chutzpah: On the Misuse of Anti-Semitism and the Abuse of History&quot;, University of California Press, 2005, p. 66–71.&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the misuse of the term &quot;antisemitism,&quot; he cites the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia&#x27;s 2003 report, which included displays of the Palestinian flag, support for the PLO, and the comparisons between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa in its list of antisemitic activities and beliefs.
He writes that what is called the new antisemitism consists of three components: (i) &quot;exaggeration and fabrication&quot;; (ii) &quot;mislabeling legitimate criticism of Israeli policy&quot;; and (iii) &quot;the unjustified yet predictable spillover from criticism of Israel to Jews generally.&quot; He argues that Israel&#x27;s apologists have denied a causal relationship between Israeli policies and hostility toward Jews, since &quot;if Israeli policies, and widespread Jewish support for them, evoke hostility toward Jews, it means that Israel and its Jewish supporters might themselves be causing anti-Semitism; and it might be doing so because Israel and its Jewish supporters are &quot;in the wrong&quot;&quot;.

Tariq Ali, a British-Pakistani historian and political activist, argues that the concept of new antisemitism amounts to an attempt to subvert the language in the interests of the State of Israel. He writes that the campaign against &quot;the supposed new &#x27;anti-semitism in modern Europe is a &quot;cynical ploy on the part of the Israeli Government to seal off the Zionist state from any criticism of its regular and consistent brutality against the Palestinians... Criticism of Israel can not and should not be equated with anti-semitism.&quot; He argues that most pro-Palestinian, anti-Zionist groups that emerged after the Six-Day War were careful to observe the distinction between anti-Zionism and antisemitism.

=== A third wave ===

Historian Bernard Lewis argues that the new antisemitism represents the third, or ideological, wave of antisemitism, the first two waves being religious and racial antisemitism.

Lewis defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of cosmic evil. He writes that what he calls the first wave of antisemitism arose with the advent of Christianity because of the Jews&#x27; rejection of Jesus as Messiah. The second wave, racial antisemitism, emerged in Spain when large numbers of Jews were forcibly converted, and doubts about the sincerity of the converts led to ideas about the importance of &quot;la limpieza de sangre&quot;, purity of blood.

He associates the third wave with the Arabs and writes that it arose only in part because of the establishment of the State of Israel. Until the 19th century, Muslims had regarded Jews with what Lewis calls &quot;amused, tolerant superioritythey were seen as physically weak, cowardly and unmilitaryand although Jews living in Muslim countries were not treated as equals, they were shown a certain amount of respect. The Western form of antisemitismwhat Lewis calls &quot;the cosmic, satanic version of Jew hatredarrived in the Middle East in several stages, beginning with Christian missionaries in the 19th century and continued to grow slowly into the 20th century up to the establishment of the Third Reich. He writes that it increased because of the humiliation of the Israeli military victories of 1948 and 1967.

Into this mix entered the United Nations. Lewis argues that the international public response and the United Nations&#x27; handling of the 1948 refugee situation convinced the Arab world that discrimination against Jews was acceptable. When the ancient Jewish community in East Jerusalem was evicted and its monuments desecrated or destroyed, they were offered no help. Similarly, when Jewish refugees fled or were driven out of Arab countries, no help was offered, but elaborate arrangements were made for Arabs who fled or were driven out of the area that became Israel. All the Arab governments involved in the conflict announced that they would not admit Israelis of any religion into their territories, and that they would not give visas to Jews, no matter which country they were citizens of. Lewis argues that the failure of the United Nations to protest sent a clear message to the Arab world.

He writes that this third wave of antisemitism has in common with the first wave that Jews are able to be part of it. With religious antisemitism, Jews were able to distance themselves from Judaism, and Lewis writes that some even reached high rank within the church and the Inquisition. With racial antisemitism, this was not possible, but with the new, ideological, antisemitism, Jews are once again able to join the critics. The new antisemitism also allows non-Jews, he argues, to criticize or attack Jews without feeling overshadowed by the crimes of the Nazis.

=== Antisemitism, but not a new phenomenon ===

Yehuda Bauer, professor of Holocaust studies at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, considers the concept &quot;new antisemitism&quot; false, describing the phenomenon as old, latent antisemitism that recurs when triggered. In his view, the current trigger is the Israeli situation, and if a compromise were achieved there antisemitism would decline but not disappear.

Dina Porat, professor at Tel Aviv University says that, while in principle there is no new antisemitism, we can speak of antisemitism in a new envelope. Otherwise Porat speaks of a new and violent form of antisemitism in Western Europe starting after the Second Intifada.

Howard Jacobson, a British novelist and journalist, calls this phenomenon &quot;Jew-hating pure and simple, the Jew-hating which many of us have always suspected was the only explanation for the disgust that contorts and disfigures faces when the mere word Israel crops up in conversation.&quot;

=== An inappropriate redefinition ===
Antony Lerman, writing in the Israeli newspaper &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot; in September 2008, argues that the concept of a &quot;new antisemitism&quot; has brought about &quot;a revolutionary change in the discourse about anti-Semitism&quot;. He writes that most contemporary discussions concerning antisemitism have become focused on issues concerning Israel and Zionism, and that the equation of anti-Zionism with antisemitism has become for many a &quot;new orthodoxy&quot;. He adds that this redefinition has often resulted in &quot;Jews attacking other Jews for their alleged anti-Semitic anti-Zionism&quot;. While Lerman accepts that exposing alleged Jewish antisemitism is &quot;legitimate in principle&quot;, he adds that the growing literature in this field &quot;exceeds all reason&quot;; the attacks are often vitriolic, and encompass views that are not inherently anti-Zionist.

Lerman argues that this redefinition has had unfortunate repercussions. He writes that serious scholarly research into contemporary antisemitism has become &quot;virtually non-existent&quot;, and that the subject is now most frequently studied and analyzed by &quot;people lacking any serious expertise in the subject, whose principal aim is to excoriate Jewish critics of Israel and to promote the &quot;anti-Zionism = anti-Semitism&quot; equation. Lerman concludes that this redefinition has ultimately served to stifle legitimate discussion, and that it cannot create a basis on which to fight antisemitism.

Peter Beaumont, writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, agrees that proponents of the concept of &quot;new antisemitism&quot; have attempted to co-opt anti-Jewish sentiment and attacks by some European Muslims as a way to silence opposition to the policies of the Israeli government. &quot;[C]riticise Israel,&quot; he writes, &quot;and you are an anti-Semite just as surely as if you were throwing paint at a synagogue in Paris.&quot;

=== Antisemitic anti-Zionism ===
Scholars including Werner Bergmann, Simon Schama, Alan Johnson, David Hirsh and Anthony Julius have described a distinctively 21st century form of antisemitic anti-Zionism characterized by left-wing hostility to Jews. According to historian Geoffrey Alderman, opposition to Zionism (being against a Jewish state) can be legitimately described as racist in essence. 

In June 2024, British author Douglas Murray stated that antisemitism has been a &quot;shapeshifting virus&quot; throughout history, and argued that anti-Zionism is antisemitism: &quot;Sometimes people hated the Jews for their race, sometimes they hated them for their religion. In this era, the only permissible way to hate the Jews is to hate them for having a state.&quot;

Norman H. Finkelstein describes the BDS movement as failing all of Natan Sharansky&#x27;s 3D&#x27;s, since the movement delegitimizes Israel, demonizes Israel, and applies double standards for criticizing Israel out of proportion to other nations, ignoring other countries&#x27; misdeeds.

In 2024, over 1000 entertainers, authors and artists signed an open letter, released by the non-profit Creative Community for Peace (CCFP), opposing boycotts of Israeli and Jewish authors and literary institutions. The letter decried efforts to &quot;demonize and ostracize Jewish authors across the globe&quot;.

In fall 2024, campus protests using chants such as &quot;Divest!&quot; and &quot;Ceasefire now!&quot; reportedly evolved in a direction more explicitly endorsing Hamas, Hezbollah, and Houthis. Some protesters used slogans such as &quot;Glory to the resistance!&quot;, called the October 7 attacks &quot;Al-Aqsa flood&quot;, celebrated Yahya Sinwar, and used the Hamas inverted red triangle. Jewish students were called &quot;baby killers&quot; and &quot;terrorists&quot;, according to a Baruch College student.

In November 2024, hundreds of posters depicting Jewish faculty members as &quot;wanted&quot; were spread across the University of Rochester campus. The posters accused Jewish faculty members of ethnic cleansing, racism, hate speech, and intimidation. University President Sarah Mangelsdorf called the incident an act of antisemitism.

== International perspectives ==
=== Europe ===
The European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC) (superseded in 2007 by the Fundamental Rights Agency) noted an upswing in antisemitic incidents in France, Germany, Austria, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and The Netherlands between July 2003 and December 2004. In September 2004, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, a part of the Council of Europe, called on its member nations to ensure that anti-racist criminal law covers antisemitism, and in 2005, the EUMC offered a discussion paper on a working definition of antisemitism in an attempt to enable a standard definition to be used for data collection: It defined antisemitism as &quot;a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred towards Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed towards Jews and non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, towards Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.&quot; The paper&#x27;s “Examples of the ways in which anti-Semitism manifests itself with regard to the state of Israel taking into account the overall context could include&quot;:
* Denying the Jewish people the right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor;
* Applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation;
* Using the symbols and images associated with classic antisemitism (e.g. claims of Jews killing Jesus or blood libel) to characterize Israel or Israelis;
* Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis.
* Holding Jews collectively responsible for actions of the State of Israel.

The EUMC added that criticism of Israel cannot be regarded as antisemitism so long as it is &quot;similar to that leveled against any other country.&quot;

The discussion paper was never adopted by the EU as a working definition, although it was posted on the EUMC website until 2013 when it was removed during a clear-out of non-official documents.

==== France ====
In France, Interior Minister Dominique de Villepin commissioned a report on racism and antisemitism from Jean-Christophe Rufin, president of Action Against Hunger and former vice-president of Médecins Sans Frontières, in which Rufin challenges the perception that the new antisemitism in France comes exclusively from North African immigrant communities and the far right.

Reporting in October 2004, Rufin writes that &quot;[t]he new anti-Semitism appears more heterogeneous,&quot; and identifies what he calls a new and &quot;subtle&quot; form of antisemitism in &quot;radical anti-Zionism&quot; as expressed by far-left and anti-globalization groups, in which criticism of Jews and Israel is used as a pretext to &quot;legitimize the armed Palestinian conflict.&quot;

==== United Kingdom ====
In June 2011, Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom, Jonathan Sacks (Lord Sacks), said that the basis for the new antisemitism was the 2001 Durban Conference. Rabbi Sacks also said that the new antisemitism &quot;unites radical Islamists with human-rights NGOsthe right wing and the left wingagainst a common enemy, the State of Israel.&quot;

In September 2006, the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Anti-Semitism of the British parliament published the Report of the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Antisemitism, the result of an investigation into whether the belief that the &quot;prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond&quot; that antisemitism had &quot;receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society.&quot; was correct. It concluded that &quot;the evidence we received indicates that there has been a reversal of this progress since the year 2000&quot;. In defining antisemitism, the Group wrote that it took into account the view of racism expressed by the MacPherson report, which was published after the murder of Stephen Lawrence, that, for the purpose of investigating and recording complaints of crime by the police, an act must be recorded by the police as racist if it is defined as such by its victim. It formed the view that, broadly, &quot;any remark, insult or act the purpose or effect of which is to violate a Jewish person&#x27;s dignity or create an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment for him is antisemitic&quot; and concluded that, given that, &quot;it is the Jewish community itself that is best qualified to determine what does and does not constitute antisemitism.&quot;

The report states that some left-wing activists and Muslim extremists are using criticism of Israel as a &quot;pretext&quot; for antisemitism, and that the &quot;most worrying discovery&quot; is that antisemitism appears to be entering the mainstream. It argues that anti-Zionism may become antisemitic when it adopts a view of Zionism as a &quot;global force of unlimited power and malevolence throughout history,&quot; a definition that &quot;bears no relation to the understanding that most Jews have of the concept: that is, a movement of Jewish national liberation ...&quot; Having re-defined Zionism, the report states, traditional antisemitic motifs of Jewish &quot;conspiratorial power, manipulation and subversion&quot; are often transferred from Jews onto Zionism. The report notes that this is &quot;at the core of the &#x27;New Antisemitism&#x27;, on which so much has been written,&quot; adding that many of those who gave evidence called anti-Zionism &quot;the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of antisemitic movements.&quot;

=== Israel ===
In November 2001 according to the Israeli Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, in response to an Abu-Dhabi television broadcast depicting Ariel Sharon drinking the blood of Palestinian children, the Israeli government set up the &quot;Coordinating Forum for Countering Antisemitism&quot;, headed by Deputy Foreign Minister Rabbi Michael Melchior. According to Melchior, &quot;in each and every generation antisemitism tries to hide its ugly face behind various disguisesand hatred of the State of Israel is its current disguise.&quot; He added that, &quot;hate against Israel has crossed the red line, having gone from criticism to unbridled antisemitic venom, which is a precise translation of classical antisemitism whose past results are all too familiar to the entire world.&quot;

=== United Nations ===

A number of commentators argue that the United Nations has condoned antisemitism. Lawrence Summers, then-president of Harvard University, wrote that the UN&#x27;s World Conference on Racism failed to condemn human rights abuses in China, Rwanda, or anywhere in the Arab world, while raising Israel&#x27;s alleged ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.

David Matas, senior counsel to B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Canada, has written that the UN is a forum for antisemitism, citing the example of the Palestinian representative to the UN Human Rights Commission who claimed in 1997 that Israeli doctors had injected Palestinian children with the AIDS virus. Congressman Steve Chabot told the U.S. House of Representatives in 2005 that the commission took &quot;several months to correct in its record a statement by the Syrian ambassador that Jews allegedly had killed non-Jewish children to make unleavened bread for Passover.

Anne Bayefsky, a Canadian legal scholar who addressed the UN about its treatment of Israel, argues that the UN hijacks the language of human rights to discriminate and demonize Jews. She writes that over one quarter of the resolutions condemning a state&#x27;s human rights violations have been directed at Israel. &quot;But there has never been a single resolution about the decades-long repression of the civil and political rights of 1.3 billion people in China, or the million female migrant workers in Saudi Arabia kept as virtual slaves, or the virulent racism which has brought 600,000 people to the brink of starvation in Zimbabwe.&quot;

In a 2008 report on antisemitism from the United States Department of State to the US Congress,
Motives for criticizing Israel in the UN may stem from legitimate concerns over policy or from illegitimate prejudices. ... However, regardless of the intent, disproportionate criticism of Israel as barbaric and unprincipled, and corresponding discriminatory measures adopted in the UN against Israel, have the effect of causing audiences to associate negative attributes with Jews in general, thus fueling anti-Semitism.

=== United States ===
In September 2006, Yale University announced that it had established the Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism, the first university-based institute in North America dedicated to the study of antisemitism. Charles Small, head of the institute, said in a press release that antisemitism has &quot;reemerged internationally in a manner that many leading scholars and policy makers take seriously ... Increasingly, Jewish communities around the world feel under threat. It&#x27;s almost like going back into the lab. I think we need to understand the current manifestation of this disease.&quot;
YIISA has presented several seminars and working papers on the topic, for instance &quot;The Academic and Public Debate Over the Meaning of the &#x27;New Antisemitism.

In July 2006, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a Campus Antisemitism report that declared that &quot;Anti-Semitic bigotry is no less morally deplorable when camouflaged as anti-Israelism or anti-Zionism.&quot; At the time, the commission also announced that antisemitism is a &quot;serious problem&quot; on many campuses throughout the United States.

The U.S. State Department&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Report on Global Anti-Semitism&quot; identified four sources of rising antisemitism, particularly in Europe:
* &quot;Traditional anti-Jewish prejudice... This includes ultra-nationalists and others who assert that the Jewish community controls governments, the media, international business, and the financial world.&quot;
* &quot;Strong anti-Israel sentiment that crosses the line between objective criticism of Israeli policies and anti-Semitism.&quot;
* &quot;Anti-Jewish sentiment expressed by some in Europe&#x27;s growing Muslim population, based on longstanding antipathy toward both Israel and Jews, as well as Muslim opposition to developments in Israel and the occupied territories, and more recently in Iraq.&quot;
* &quot;Criticism of both the United States and globalization that spills over to Israel, and to Jews in general who are identified with both.&quot;

== Anti-globalization movement ==
The anti-globalization movement of the late 1990s and early 2000s was accused by writers and researchers such as Walter Laqueur, Paul Berman, and Mark Strauss of displaying elements of new antisemitism. Critics of the Laqueur–Berman–Strauss view argue that the allegation is either unfounded or exaggerated, intended to discredit legitimate criticism of globalization and of free trade economic policies.

=== Mark Strauss&#x27;s allegations ===
Mark Strauss of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; argues that globalization has stirred anxieties about &quot;outside forces&quot;, and that with &quot;familiar anxieties come familiar scapegoats.&quot; He writes that what he calls the &quot;backlash against globalization&quot; has united a variety of political elements, from the left to the far-right, via a common cause, and that in so doing it has &quot;foster[ed] a common enemy.&quot; He quotes the French Jewish leader Roger Cukierman who identifies the anti-globalization movement as &quot;an anti-Semitic brown-green-red alliance&quot;, which includes ultra-nationalists, Islamists, and communists.

Strauss cites Jörg Haider of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria and Jean-Marie Le Pen of France&#x27;s National Front as examples of the far right exploiting their electorate&#x27;s concerns about globalization. The fringe Fascism and Freedom Movement in Italy identifies globalization as an &quot;instrument in the hands of international Zionism&quot; according to Strauss, while in Eastern Europe ultranationalists and communists have united against foreign investors and multinationals, identifying Jews as a common enemy.

Matthew F. Hale, an American white nationalist of the World Church of the Creator, stated of the 1999 protests in Seattle that they were &quot;incredibly successful from the point of view of the rioters as well as our Church. They helped shut down talks of the Jew World Order WTO and helped make a mockery of the Jewish Occupational Government around the world. Bravo.&quot; Strauss also cites the National Alliance, a neo-Nazi party which set up a website called the &quot;Anti-Globalism Action Network&quot; in order to &quot;broaden ... the anti-globalism movement to include divergent and marginalized voices.&quot;

Strauss writes that, as a result of far-right involvement, a &quot;bizarre ideological turf war has broken out&quot;, whereby anti-globalization activists are fighting a &quot;two-front battle,&quot; one against the World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank, the other against the extremists who turn up at their rallies. He points to an anti-globalization march in Porto Alegre, Brazil, at which he says some marchers displayed swastikas and that Jewish peace activists were assaulted. He wrote:
&quot;Held two months prior to the U.S.-led attack on Iraq, this year&#x27;s conference an annual grassroots riposte to the well-heeled World Economic Forum in Davos had the theme, &#x27;Another World is Possible.&#x27; But the more appropriate theme might have been &#x27;Yesterday&#x27;s World is Back.&#x27; Marchers among the 20,000 activists from 120 countries carried signs reading &#x27;Nazis, Yankees, and Jews: No More Chosen Peoples!&#x27; Some wore T-shirts with the Star of David twisted into Nazi swastikas. Members of a Palestinian organization pilloried Jews as the &#x27;true fundamentalists who control United States capitalism.&#x27; Jewish delegates carrying banners declaring &#x27;Two peoples – Two states: Peace in the Middle East&#x27; were assaulted.

Strauss argues that the anti-globalization movement is not itself antisemitic but that it &quot;helps enable anti-Semitism by peddling conspiracy theories.&quot; Strauss&#x27;s arguments have been met with strong criticism from many in the anti-globalization movement. Oded Grajew, one of the founders of the World Social Forum, has written that the WSF &quot;is not anti-Semitic, anti-American, or even anti-socially-responsible capitalism&quot;. He claims that some fringe parties have attempted to infiltrate the WSF&#x27;s demonstrations and promote demonstrations of their own, but adds that &quot;[t]he success of the WSF ... is a threat to political extremist groups that resort to violence and hatred&quot;. Grajew has also written that, to his knowledge, Strauss&#x27;s claim of Nazi symbols being displayed at an anti-globalization demonstration in Porto Alegre, Brazil is false.

=== Response to Strauss ===
Maude Barlow, national chairperson of the Council of Canadians, argues that Strauss has &quot;inflamed, not enlightened&quot; the debate over globalization by making &quot;no distinction between the far right&#x27;s critique of globalization and that of the global social justice movement&quot;, which is premised on &quot;respect for human rights and cultural diversity&quot;. She notes that the Council of Canadians has condemned antisemitism, and that it expelled some individuals who tried to organize a David Icke tour under its auspices. John Cavanagh of the International Policy Centre has also criticized Strauss for using unproven allegations of antisemitism to criticize the entire anti-globalization movement, and for failing to research the movement&#x27;s core beliefs.

In response to these criticisms, Strauss has written that antisemitic views &quot;might not reflect the core values of the Global Justice Movement or its leading figures, yet they are facts of life in an amorphous, grassroots movement where any number of individuals or organizations express their opinions or seek to set the agenda&quot;. He has also reiterated his concern that &quot;anti-capitalist rhetoric provides intellectual fodder for far right groups&quot;.

=== Other views ===
Walter Laqueur describes this phenomenon:
Although traditional Trotskyite ideology is in no way close to radical Islamic teachings and the shariah, since the radical Islamists also subscribed to anticapitalism, antiglobalism, and anti-Americanism, there seemed to be sufficient common ground for an alliance. Thus, the militants of the far left began to march side by side with the radical Islamists in demonstrations, denouncing American aggression and Israeli crimes. ... And it was only natural that in protest demonstrations militants from the far right would join in, antisemitic banners would be displayed, anti-Jewish literature such as the &quot;Protocols&quot; would be sold. 

Lawrence Summers, then president of Harvard University, also stated that &quot;[s]erious and thoughtful people are advocating and taking actions that are anti-Semitic in their effect if not their intent. For example ... [a]t the same rallies where protesters, many of them university students, condemn the IMF and global capitalism and raise questions about globalization, it is becoming increasingly common to also lash out at Israel. Indeed, at the anti-IMF rallies last spring, chants were heard equating Hitler and Sharon.&quot;

A March 2003 report on antisemitism in the European Union by Werner Bergmann and Juliane Wetzel of the Berlin Research Centre on Anti-Semitism identifies anti-globalization rallies as one of the sources of antisemitism on the left.
In the extreme left-wing scene, anti-Semitic remarks were to be found mainly in the context of pro-Palestinian and anti-globalisation rallies and in newspaper articles using anti-Semitic stereotypes in their criticism of Israel. Often this generated a combination of anti-Zionist and anti-American views that formed an important element in the emergence of an anti-Semitic mood in Europe.
Michael Kozak, then U.S. Acting Assistant Secretary for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, told reporters in 2005 that people within the anti-globalization movement have conflated their legitimate concerns &quot;with this idea that Jews run the world and globalization is the fault of Jews.&quot; He said:
I think one of the disturbing things is that you&#x27;re starting to see this in some you know, it&#x27;s not just sort of right-wing ultranationalist skinhead types. It&#x27;s now you&#x27;re getting some fairly otherwise respectable intellectuals that are left of center who are anti-globalization who are starting to let this stuff creep into their rhetoric.
And that&#x27;s disturbing because it starts to it starts to take what is a legitimate issue for debate, anti-globalization or the war in Iraq or any other issue, and when you start turning that into an excuse for saying therefore we should hate Jews, that&#x27;s where you cross the line, in my view. It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re not entitled to question all those other issues. Of course, those are fair game. But it&#x27;s the same as saying, you know, you start hating all Muslims because of some policy you don&#x27;t like by one Muslim country or something.

=== Conflation of globalization, Jews and Israel ===

Robert Wistrich, Professor of European and Jewish History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, told Manfred Gerstenfeld that globalization has given rise to an anti-globalist left that is &quot;viscerally anti-American, anti-capitalist, and hostile to world Jewry.&quot; He argues that the decade that preceded the current increase in antisemitism was one that saw accelerated globalization of the world economy, a process in which the losers included the Arab and Muslim worlds, and who are now the &quot;major consumers of anti-Jewish poison and conspiracy theories that blame everyone except themselves. Israel is only one piece on this chessboard, but it has assumed such inflated importance because it serves a classic anti-Semitic function of being an &#x27;opium for the masses&#x27;.&quot;

As an example of the alleged conflation of globalization, the U.S. and Israel, Josef Joffe, editor and publisher of &quot;Die Zeit&quot; and adjunct professor at Stanford University, cited José Bové, a French anti-globalization activist and leader of the &quot;Confédération Paysanne&quot;. Bové led what Joffe calls a &quot;deconstructionist mob&quot; against McDonald&#x27;s to protest against its effects on French cuisine, later turning up in Ramallah to denounce Israel and announce his support for Yasser Arafat. &quot;Arafat&#x27;s cause was Bové&#x27;s cause ... here was a spokesman for the anti-globalization movement who was conflating globalization with Americanization and extending his loathing of both to Israel.&quot; Joffe argues that &quot;Kapitalismuskritik&quot; is a &quot;mainstay of the antisemitic faith, a charge that has passed smoothly from Jews to America. Like Jews, Americans are money-grubbers who know only the value of money, and the worth of nothing. Like Jews, they seek to reduce all relationships to exchange and money. Like them, Americans are motivated only by profit, and so they respect no tradition.&quot;

David Clark, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, argues against this that &quot;instances of anti-capitalism spilling into &#x27;rich Jew&#x27; bigotry are ... well documented&quot; but &quot;stand out precisely because they conflict so sharply with the Left&#x27;s universalism and its opposition to ethnic discrimination&quot;.

In early 2004, Kalle Lasn, author of &quot;Culture Jam&quot; and founder of &quot;Adbusters&quot;, two influential and widely read anti-globalization texts, generated controversy when he wrote an editorial entitled &quot;Why won&#x27;t anyone say they are Jewish?&quot;. In it he stated &quot;Drawing attention to the Jewishness of the neocons is a tricky game. Anyone who does so can count on automatically being smeared as an anti-Semite. But the point is not that Jews (who make up less than 2 percent of the American population) have a monolithic perspective. Indeed, American Jews overwhelmingly vote Democrat and many of them disagree strongly with Ariel Sharon&#x27;s policies and Bush&#x27;s aggression in Iraq. The point is simply that the neocons seem to have a special affinity for Israel that influences their political thinking and consequently American foreign policy in the Middle East.&quot; The editorial suggested that Jews represent a disproportionately high percentage of the neo-conservatives who control American foreign policy, and that this may affect policy with respect to Israel. Lasn included a list of influential neo-conservatives, with dots next to the names of those who were Jewish.

Lasn was criticized by a number of anti-globalization activists. Klaus Jahn, professor of the philosophy of history at the University of Toronto condemned Lasn&#x27;s article stating &quot;Whether listing physicians who perform abortions in anti-abortion tracts, gays and lesbians in office memos, Communists in government and the entertainment industry under McCarthy, Jews in Central Europe under Nazism and so on, such list-making has always produced pernicious consequences.&quot;

Meredith Warren, a Montreal anti-globalization activist responded to the article by saying &quot;The U.S. government has only an economic interest in having control over that region. It wants oil and stability – it has nothing to do with Jews or Judaism. Pointing out the various religious stances of those in power totally misses the point of the U.S. government&#x27;s interest in Israel.&quot;

=== Controversy over alleged antisemitism within the French movement ===

According to a report by the Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Antisemitism, a major event for the anti-globalization movement in France was the European Social Forum (ESF) in Paris in November 2003. The organizers allegedly included a number of Islamic groups, such as &quot;Présence Musulmane&quot;, &quot;Secours Islamique&quot;, and &quot;Collectif des Musulmans de France&quot;. Tariq Ramadan, the grandson of Hassan al-Banna, the Egyptian founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, also attended meetings. A few weeks earlier, Ramadan had published a controversial article on a website after &quot;Le Monde&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot; refused to publish it criticizing several French intellectuals, who according to the institute, were either Jewish or &quot;others he mistakenly thought were Jewish,&quot; for having &quot;supposedly betrayed their universalist beliefs in favor of unconditional support for Zionism and Israel.&quot;

Bernard-Henri Lévy, one of the intellectuals who was criticized, called on the French anti-globalization movement to distance itself from Ramadan. In an interview with &quot;Le Monde&quot;, Lévy said: &quot;Mr. Ramadan, dear anti-globalizationist friends, is not and cannot be one of yours. ... I call you on you quickly to distance yourselves from this character who, in crediting the idea of an elitist conspiracy under the control of Zionism, is only inflaming people&#x27;s thoughts and opening the way to the worst.&quot;

&quot;Le Monde&quot; reported that many members of the anti-globalization movement in France agreed that Ramadan&#x27;s article &quot;has no place on a European Social Forum mailing list.&quot;

Other activists defended Ramadan. One activist told the newspaper that &quot;[o]ne of the characteristics of the European Social Forum is the stark rise in immigrant and Muslim organizations. It is an important phenomenon and a positive one in many ways.&quot; Another activist, Peter Khalfa, said: &quot;Ramadan&#x27;s essay is not anti-Semitic. It is dangerous to wave the red flag of anti-Semitism at any moment. However, it is a text marked partly by Ramadan&#x27;s communitarian thought and which communicates his view of the world to others.&quot; One of the leaders of the anti-globalization movement in France, José Bové of the &quot;Confédération Paysanne&quot;, told &quot;Le Monde&quot;: &quot;The anti-globalization movement defends universalist points of view which are therefore necessarily secular in their political expression. That there should be people of different cultures and religions is only natural. The whole effort is to escape such determinisms.&quot;

=== Concern within the political left ===
Naomi Klein, a Jewish Canadian writer and activist in the anti-globalization movement, expressed concern in 2002 at finding antisemitic rhetoric on some activist websites that she had visited: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t help thinking about all the recent events I&#x27;ve been to where anti-Muslim violence was rightly condemned, but no mention was made of attacks on Jewish synagogues, cemeteries, and community centers.&quot; Klein urged activists to confront antisemitism as part of their work for social justice. She also suggested that allegations of antisemitism can be often politically motivated, and that activists should avoid political simplifications that could be perceived as antisemitic:
The [anti-]globalization movement isn&#x27;t anti-Semitic, it just hasn&#x27;t fully confronted the implications of diving into the Middle East conflict. Most people on the left are simply choosing sides. In the Middle East, where one side is under occupation and the other has the U.S. military behind it, the choice seems clear. But it is possible to criticize Israel while forcefully condemning the rise of anti-Semitism. And it is equally possible to be pro-Palestinian independence without adopting a simplistic pro-Palestinian/anti-Israel dichotomy, a mirror image of the good versus evil equations so beloved by President George W. Bush.
In October 2004, the &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine published a special issue covering the insertion of antisemitic rhetoric into some progressive debates. Adam Ma&#x27;anit wrote:
Take &quot;Adbusters&quot; magazine&#x27;s founder Kalle Lasn&#x27;s recent editorial rant against Jewish neoconservatives... The article includes a self-selected &#x27;well-researched list&#x27; of 50 of the supposedly most influential &#x27;neocons&#x27; with little black dots next to all those who are Jewish... If it&#x27;s not the neocons then it&#x27;s the all-powerful &#x27;Jewish lobby&#x27; which holds governments to ransom all over the world (because Jews control the global economy of course) to do their bidding. Meanwhile, rightwing Judeophobes often talk of a leftist Jewish conspiracy to promote equality and human rights through a new internationalism embodied in the UN in order to control governments and suppress national sovereignty. They call it the &#x27;New World Order&#x27; or the &#x27;Jew World Order&#x27;. They make similar lists to Lasn&#x27;s of prominent Jews in the global justice movement (Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein, etc.) to argue their case.

The issue observes, however, that &quot;While antisemitism is rife in the Arab World, the Israeli Government often uses it as moral justification for its policies.&quot;

<text>Fuad Backović (born 12 April 1982), better known by his stage name Deen, is a Bosnian pop recording artist, reality star and fashion designer. Backović was the lead singer of the Bosnian boy band 7Up from 1997 until 2002, when he became a solo artist. He represented Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004 with the song &quot;In the Disco&quot;.

In 2008, Backović competed on the reality television show &quot;Farma&quot;. That same year, he retired from music to become a fashion designer, but revived his music career in November 2015 when he agreed to represent his country once again at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 with the song &quot;Ljubav je&quot; together with Dalal Midhat-Talakić, Ana Rucner and rapper Jala Brat.

==Early life==
Fuad Backović was born on 12 April 1982 in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, then SFR Yugoslavia. When Backović was two years old, his father Zaim Backović, who worked as a representative of a construction company in Libya, relocated to the Middle Eastern country for six years. The name Fuad means &quot;heart&quot; in Arabic, while his stage name Deen is taken from the Arabic &quot;Dīn&quot; meaning &quot;faith&quot;. Backović has stated his love for music stems from his mother Sabina, an amateur singer who gave up the prospect of a career in music to get a degree in Economics and later on, to raise a family. Backović has a younger brother named Faris.

The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 to 1996, stands out as the most difficult moments in his life. He spent most of the war with his mother, brother, grandparents and other family members in the basement of the family home in the Koševo neighborhood of Sarajevo, while his father was in the battlefield, a soldier in the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Following the war, his father became a politician, serving as the Minister of Economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a member of the Bosnian parliament.

==Career==

At the age of 12, Fuad Backović took his first musical steps by recording his first song in 1994. The song was recorded in a musical studio called Studio Number 1 owned by PBSBiH. Gradually his local success grew and obtained the attention of Sarajevo record labels. By 1997, Backović took the opportunity to become the lead singer of the Bosnian boy band 7Up.

The band released two albums, &quot;Otvori oči&quot; (1998) and &quot;Seven&quot; (2000). The band enjoyed great success in Bosnia and the neighboring countries Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro. In 1998, Deen received an offer to perform for an opera choir. His vocal abilities had been noticed by the National Theater of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he accepted the role of the lead singer for the opera choir during the production of &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;.

Backović decided to leave 7Up and become a solo artist, releasing his first studio album &quot;Ja sam vjetar zaljubljeni&quot; in 2002. In a 2007 interview he said that being a part of 7Up was an unforgettable experience which left him with many good memories. Backović has been praised for his vocal abilities by people such as Davorin Popović, Kemal Monteno, Hajrudin Varešanović, and many others.

Backović recorded the duet &quot;Poljubi me&quot; (Kiss Me) with the popular Croatian singer Vlatka Pokos.

In 2008, Backović competed on the reality television show &quot;Farma&quot;. That same year, he retired from music to become a fashion designer, but revived his music career in November 2015 when he agreed to represent his country once again at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 together with Dalal Midhat-Talakić, Ana Rucner and rapper Jala Brat.

===Eurovision Song Contest 2004===
In 2004, Deen represented Bosnia and Herzegovina at the 2004 Eurovision Song Contest in Istanbul, with the song &quot;In the Disco&quot;. Deen finished in ninth place with 91 points automatically earning Bosnia and Herzegovina the honour of participating in the final of the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest.

===Eurovision Song Contest 2016===
Fuad represented Bosnia and Herzegovina for the second time at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016, this time in Sweden&#x27;s capital Stockholm. He was joined by Dalal Midhat-Talakić, Ana Rucner and rapper Jala Brat. They performed the song &quot;Ljubav je&quot; in the second half of the first semi-final, but failed to qualify for the final, making it the first time since the introduction of the semis in 2004 that Bosnia has failed to qualify. After the contest, he retired from the music once again.

==Personal life==
Backović has lived in Milan, Italy and has graduated from the Istituto Marangoni with a degree in Fashion Business.

Deen now lives in Los Angeles, United States. Backović dodged rumors of his homosexuality for years. When asked by the Bosnian magazine &quot;Gracija&quot; in September 2010 if he had relocated to Milan to live an openly gay life outside of more conservative Bosnia, he replied that although he knew many gay people, that he was heterosexual. He also stated that he was not open to marriage. Backović was in a possible &quot;lavender&quot; relationship with Bosnian socialite Hana Hadžiavdagić, who later came out as bisexual.

As of 2024, he is in a relationship with his American boyfriend, Will Phearson III.

<text>The University of Edinburgh, the majority of colleges at the universities of Cambridge, Durham and Oxford, as well as newer collegiate universities such as Lancaster University, University of York, and older universities like University of Bristol and St David&#x27;s College, have members of staff called porters. There is normally a head porter and a team of other porters. Their precise job roles vary from college to college. Oxbridge porters are highly sought after jobs. Porters work in a section of the college called the porters&#x27; lodge, at the main entrance.

Roles can involve:

* Controlling entry to the college
* Sorting mail
* Providing security to members
* Reporting students to the Dean
* Maintenance and repairs to college property

Porters also exist at McGill University in Canada, where each one is generally responsible for a large building or group of smaller buildings. Generally, they provide a single point of contact for any issues relating to the facilities they are responsible for, including security, maintenance requests, access control, etc.

The character Skullion from Tom Sharpe&#x27;s satirical 1974 novel &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot; was a fictional head porter reputed to be based on Albert Jaggard, the Head Porter of Corpus Christi during the 1960s and 1970s.

At Edinburgh, the position has historically been hereditary.

<doc id="675632" wikidata="Q958421" url="?curid=675632" title="Kazuo Sakamaki">
<text>was a Japanese naval officer who became the first prisoner of war of World War II to be captured by U.S. forces.

==Early life and education==
Sakamaki was born in what is now part of the city of Awa, Tokushima Prefecture, the second-oldest of eight sons. He was a graduate of the 68th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1940.

==Career==
===Attack on Pearl Harbor===


Ensign Sakamaki was one of ten sailors (five officers and five petty officers) selected to attack Pearl Harbor in five two-man &quot;Ko-hyoteki&quot; class midget submarines on 7 December 1941. Of the ten, nine were killed (including the other crewman in submarine &quot;HA. 19&quot;, CWO Kiyoshi Inagaki.) Sakamaki was chosen for the mission due to his large number of siblings.

Sakamaki&#x27;s submarine became trapped on a reef off Waimanalo Beach, Oahu, as it attempted to enter Pearl Harbor. The book &quot;Attack on Pearl Harbor&quot; claims that his submarine hit two coral reefs and sank. Sakamaki ordered his crewman, Kiyoshi Inagaki, to swim to shore, and Sakamaki attempted to scuttle the disabled submarine and swim to shore as well. The explosives failed to go off and Inagaki drowned. Sakamaki made it to shore, but fell unconscious once on the beach, where he was found by a U.S. soldier, David Akui, and was taken into military custody. When he awoke, he found himself in a hospital under U.S. armed security. Sakamaki became the first Japanese prisoner of war in U.S. captivity during World War II. Japanese high command struck his name from the records and told his family that he had been killed in action. His submarine was recovered and taken on tours across the United States to encourage war bond purchases.

After being taken to Sand Island, Sakamaki requested that he be allowed to kill himself, which was denied. He spent the rest of the war in prisoner-of-war camps in the continental United States. After overcoming his initial depression, he resolved to continue living, and occupied his time as a POW by learning English. Sakamaki&#x27;s family were informed that he was missing in action, but were told to keep the fact secret. While the nine other officers and sailors who had been killed during their mission were posthumously decorated and recognized as war heroes by the Imperial Japanese government, Sakamaki&#x27;s name was deliberately omitted.

After the war&#x27;s end, Sakamaki was repatriated to Japan in 1946, by which time he had become deeply committed to pacifism. Following his return, he received hate mail from strangers, including a letter ordering him to &quot;immediately perform ritual suicide&quot; and make a public apology for his shame of having been taken prisoner.

==Later life and death==
Sakamaki married and raised a family. Though he privately published his memoirs, he avoided discussing his wartime experiences with his family. His eldest son, Kiyoshi, however, following a conversation with his father and after visiting the family of Kiyoshi Inagaki, thought he might have been named in memory of his father&#x27;s wartime comrade. 

Sakamaki joined the Toyota Motor Corporation, and put his English abilities to good use while managing export sales for the company. He became president of its Brazilian subsidiary in 1969. In 1983, he returned to Japan and continued working for Toyota before retiring in 1987. Apart from his memoirs, Sakamaki refused to speak about the war until 1991, when he attended a historical conference at the National Museum of the Pacific War in Fredericksburg, Texas. He reportedly cried at the conference when he was reunited with his submarine (which was on display at the museum) for the first time in 50 years.

He spent the rest of his life in Japan until his death in 1999 at the age of 81.

<doc id="675643" wikidata="Q215074" url="?curid=675643" title="Terceira Island">
<text>Terceira () is a volcanic island in the Azores archipelago, about a third of the way across the North Atlantic Ocean at a similar latitude to Portugal&#x27;s capital Lisbon, with the island group forming an insular part of Portugal. It is one of the larger islands of the archipelago, with a population of 53,311 inhabitants in an area of approximately . 

Terceira is the location of the Azores&#x27; oldest city, Angra do Heroísmo, the historical capital of the archipelago and UNESCO World Heritage Site; the seat of the judicial system (Supreme Court); and the main insular Portuguese Air Force base, Base Aérea nº 4 at Lajes, with a United States Air Force detachment.

Terceira island has two main sea ports, one at Angra do Heroísmo and the other at Praia da Vitória, and a commercial airport integrated with the flight operations at Base Aérea nº 4. The Portuguese bullfight is popular on the island, coming in two variations: the traditional equestrian bullfight (in the ring) and the popular &quot;touradas à corda&quot; that occur in the streets.

==History==
Historically, there has been uncertainty in the date and the discoverer associated with the islands of the Azores. Nautical charts before the &quot;official&quot; discovery identified islands in the Atlantic Ocean as far back as 1325, when a chart by Angelino Dalorto identified &quot;Bracile&quot; west of Ireland, and later one by Angelino Dulcert which identifies the Canaries, and Madeira, along with mysterious islands denominated as &quot;Capraria&quot; (which some historians suggest were São Miguel and Santa Maria). Legends also persisted of &quot;Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Sete Cidades&quot; (Kingdoms of the Seven Cities), the &quot;Terras of São Brandão&quot;, the &quot;Ilhas Aofortunadas&quot; (The Fortunate Islands), the &quot;Ilha da Brasil&quot; (the Island of Brasil), &quot;Antília&quot;, the &quot;Ilhas Azuis&quot; (Blue Islands), and the &quot;Terra dos Bacalhaus&quot; (Land of Codfish), and charts appeared between 1351 and 1439 of several groupings of islands with various names. The first association between the modern island of Terceira and these stories, was that of the island of Brasil; it first appears as &quot;Insula de Brasil&quot; in the Venetian map of Andrea Bianco (1436), attached to one of the larger islands of a group of islands in the Atlantic

In 1439, the first official discovery document appeared, attributing the discovery of the Formigas to Gonçalo Velho Cabral. There is an indication that Terceira may have been discovered by Vicente de Lagos, Velho Cabral&#x27;s pilot, on 1 January 1445: the first documents after this period started appearing with a third island in the Azorean archipelago, referred to as the &quot;Ilha de Jesus Cristo&quot; (&quot;Island of Jesus Christ&quot;), and later, &quot;Ilha de Jesus Cristo da Terceira&quot;. Gaspar Frutuoso, a chronicler and humanist, would later rationalize about the island&#x27;s first name, noting that:
* it was discovered on the first day of January, traditionally the feast day of the name of Jesus;
* it was discovered by a captain in the Order of Christ;
* it was discovered on a Thursday or Friday, on &quot;Corpo de Deus&quot; (&quot;Body of Christ&quot;); or
* because it was part of the dioceses of Angra, through the invocation of San Salvador (although this implies that a dioceses existed prior to its discovery).
Regardless, it was only a temporary name, as the colloquial &quot;Terceira&quot; (meaning &quot;third&quot; in Portuguese, as in &quot;the third island&quot; or &quot;third to be discovered&quot;) was used more often to describe the island.

The colonization of the island began by decree of Infante D. Henrique (dated 21 March 1450), and placed the island in the administrative hands of the Fleming Jácome de Bruges. Its first settler was Fernão d&#x27;Ulmo, a Fleming or Frenchman, who later abandoned his plot, for unknown reasons. Bruges, although a Flemish nobleman, continued to bring families and settlers from Flanders, and northern Portuguese adventurers (João Coelho, from Guimarães; João da Ponte, from Aveiro; João Bernardes, from Lagos; João Leonarde, from Vieira; and Gonçalo Anes da Fonseca, from Porto), as well as animals and provisions, disembarking in the area of Porto Judeu or Pesqueiro dos Meninos, near Vila de São Sebastião (depending on sources). Frutuoso also affirmed that:

...that ancient settlers of the island of Terceira, that were the first to settle in a band to the north, where they call Quatro Ribeiras, where now the parish of Santa Beatriz is located, and where the first church existed on the island, but were few settlers remained due to difficult access and bad port.

The first settlement occurred in Quatro Ribeiras, in the locality of Portalegre, where a small chapel was raised for the invocation of Santa Ana. Bruges made return trips to Flanders for new settlers to his colony. On one of his trips to Madeira, he conscripted Diogo de Teive and assigned him as his lieutenant and overseer for the island of Terceira. A few years later, Bruges moved his residence to Praia, began construction on the Matriz Church in 1456, and administered the Captaincy of the island from this location (around 1460), until he mysteriously disappeared in 1474, on another of his trips between the colony and the continent. Following his disappearance, the Infanta D. Beatriz, in the name of her son the Infante D. Diogo (who inherited the islands of Terceira and Graciosa following the death D. Fernando, the adopted son of the Infante D. Henrique) divided the island of Terceira into two captaincies: Angra (which was given to João Vaz Corte Real) and Praia (which was given to Álvaro Martins Homem). Apart from the Portuguese and Flemish settlers, colonists from Madeira, many slaves from Africa, new Christians and Jews populated the island at this time, developing new commercial ventures including wheat (exported during the 15th century throughout the empire), sugar-cane, woad (for the dye industry) and woods (principally for the naval construction industries). This development would continue until the end of the 19th century, with the introduction of new products, including tea, tobacco and pineapple.

During the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580, the Azores was the only portion of the Portuguese overseas empire to resist the Spanish until the summer of 1583. Philip II of Spain had offered an amnesty if the Azores surrender, but his messenger met with a very hostile reception at Angra do Heroísmo (escaping to São Miguel, which had presented its allegiance to the King of Spain). Following the Battle of Ponta Delgada, where Don Álvaro de Bazán, 1st Marquis of Santa Cruz defeated the Anglo-French supporters of D. António (the pretender to the Portuguese throne) off the coast of São Miguel, the Marquis concentrated his forces at a less defended beach from Angra do Heroísmo. With a fleet to ninety-six ships and 9,500 men (as well as a garrison of 2,000 on Sao Miguel) the Marquis was able to defeat the forces of D. António after one day&#x27;s fighting. Although French and English soldiers on the island were allowed to retire unharmed, D. Antonio and a handful of his supporters were lucky to escape with their lives.

One year later, the conquest of the Azores was complete after the island of Terceira was reconciled, followed by the seizure of the island of Faial.

An English expedition fleet under the Earl of Cumberland in 1589, as part of the Azores Voyage of 1589 into Angra Bay, attacked several harbouring Spanish and Portuguese ships and was able to sink or capture five.

With the acclamation of John IV of Portugal, the Azores applauded the restoration of independence from the Iberian Union. This was not lost on the Spanish settlers in Angra do Heroísmo, who had become a privileged class during the Union, and which made it difficult for them to remain after 1640, when Portuguese sovereignty was restored.

In 1766, the reorganization of system of Captaincies was undertaken, resulting in one Captain-General, with his seat in Angra do Heroísmo for the Azores.

In 1810, a number of journalists and others considered to favor the French, including the industrialist Jácome Ratton, were exiled to the island for a period.

Political tension rose in the 1820s between constitutionalists or Liberals, (supporters of the constitutional monarchy installed by King John VI of Portugal) and those who supported absolute monarchy. Having embraced the cause of constitutionalism, the local Terceirenses established a &quot;Junta Provisória&quot; in the name of Queen Maria II of Portugal in 1828. Hostilities broke out at the Battle of Praia da Vitória in 1829. In a decree, issued on 15 March 1830, Angra was named as Portuguese capital by the Terceirenses constitutional forces, who protected and supported exiled Liberals who supported the rights of Queen Maria II of Portugal, whose rights were usurped by the &quot;Miguelistas&quot; (supporters of the absolute monarchy of Miguel I). In 1832, Pedro I (former King and regent of Queen Maria) arrived in the Azores to form a government-in-opposition to the absolutionist regime in Lisbon, presided by the Marques of Palmela, and supported by Azoreans Mouzinho da Silveira and Almeida Garrett that developed many important reforms.

Toward the end of WWII, Portugal went from becoming a neutral country to, in 1944, a non-belligerent country in favor of the allies. A military agreement was signed with the United States which allowed them to establish Lajes Field on the island. The field had already been operational by the British who used the 1373 Treaty of Windsor to get approval to build an Air Force base and they brought in US equipment, but the US was not allowed to realistically use the base until Portugal agreed in 1944.

On 24 August 2001, Terceira made the news as Air Transat Flight 236 managed to land at Lajes Field after running out of fuel in mid-air.

On 16 March 2003, President of the United States George W. Bush, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar and Prime Minister of Portugal José Manuel Barroso met on Terceira to discuss the Invasion of Iraq, which began four days later, on 20 March.

On 15 January 2016, then Tropical Storm Alex made an unprecedented landfall on the island with sustained winds reaching 65 miles per hour. This landfall was unprecedented due to the time of year it occurred, which was mid-January. Alex is one of four known tropical cyclones to make landfall on the Island of Terceira, with the others being an unnamed hurricane in 1889, another unnamed hurricane in 1940, and Hurricane Carrie in 1957.

==Geology and Geography==
===Geology and physical geography===

Terceira island is an active volcanic island, that is composed of several older extinct volcanoes. The highest point of Terceira is 1021 m, formed by the summit of the dormant Santa Barbara volcano, known as the Serra de Santa Bárbara.

The island of Terceira consists of four overlapping stratovolcanoes built over a geologic structure called the Terceira Rift: a triple junction between the Eurasian, African and North American tectonic plates. These volcanic structures rise from a depth of over from the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. Radiocarbon dating of eruptive units, in support of geologic mapping, has improved the known chronology of Middle to Late Pleistocene and Holocene volcanic activity on the island of Terceira, Azores, defining the east-to-west progression in stratovolcano growth. These have commonly resulted in a classification of the eruptive events into the following structures:
* Cinco Picos Volcanic Complex: the oldest on Terceira (defined by the Serra do Cume), which completed its main sub-aerial activity by about 370–380,000 years ago. Collapse of the upper part of the stratovolcanic edifice formed an enormous caldera about 370,000 years ago. Post-caldera eruptions of basalt from cinder cones on and near the caldera floor and trachytic pyroclastic flow and pumice fall deposits from younger volcanoes west of Cinco Picos have refilled much of the caldera producing an almost-uninterrupted fertile plain.
* Guilherme Moniz Volcanic Complex: the southern portion, in the central part of the island, began erupting about 100,000 years later (about 270,000 ka) and produced trachyte domes (approximately 808 m/2651 ft in altitude), flows, and minor pyroclastic deposits for another 100,000 years (until at least 111 ka). The highest point along the caldera rim reaches . The northern portion of the Caldera is less well exposed, but reflects a similar age range. The northwest portion of the caldera was formed sometime after 44 ka. Several well-studied ignimbrites that blanket much of the island likely erupted from Guilherme Moniz Volcano.
* Pico Alto Volcanic Complex: a tightly spaced cluster of trachyte domes and short flows, is a younger part of Guilherme Moniz Volcano. Stratigraphic studies and radiocarbon analysis suggest that most of the Pico Alto eruptions occurred during the period from about 9000 to 1000 years BP.
* Santa Barbara Volcanic Complex: the youngest stratovolcano on Terceira, began erupting prior to 29,000 years ago, and has been active historically, comprises the western end of the island and at its highest point is . This stratovolcano is surrounded by several domes and coulee trachyte formations that occupy the volcano&#x27;s caldera and along various alignments of the volcano&#x27;s flanks.
* Fissural Zone: Connecting the eastern portion of Santa Bárbara, the western frontier of Pico Alto and Guilherme Moniz exist a grouping of fissural volcanoes and basaltic cones (Hawaiian and Strombolian), the youngest of which formed about 15,000 years ago. The only historical eruptions occurred in 1761, along a fissure on the eastern face of Santa Bárbara, and in 1867 and between 1998 and 2000 from submarine vents off the western coast (Serreta). The groupings of volcanic structures on the island are aligned along a northwest–southwest and west-northwest-east-southeast orientation that extends to the submarine vents/volcanoes towards the eastern basin of Graciosa, including geomorphological alignments of smaller volcanic structures (including both basaltic and trachytic cones).

Island tectonics are highlighted by two great faults in the northeast corner (the Lajes and the Fontinhas faults), the Lajes Graben has been responsible for severe seismic events. Historically, both faults have produced earthquakes that are relatively shallow, strong and responsible for the destruction of property in the northeastern corner (specifically in 1614 and 1841). During the 1614 event, whose epicenter was located along the Lajes fault offshore, recorded magnitudes for the earthquake were between 5.8 and 6.3 on the Richter scale (Wells and Coppersmith,1994). Both the Lajes and Fontinhas faults are separated by ). A second, less-developed, graben is located on the southeast of the Santa Bárbara stratovolcano. This feature is marked by trachyte domes and crosses from the coast at Ponta do Queimado (from the historical basin of Serreta) to the cliffs, faults, basaltic lava and fissural eruptions near the center of the island.

The western part of Terceira Island is more heavily forested than the eastern part, due to the prevailing westerly winds bringing increased precipitation to that side, resulting in forests of Cryptomeria (&quot;Cryptomeria japonica&quot;). Other geomorphological points of interest include the plains of Achada, the mounts near Santa Bárbara, the small lakes of Lagoa das Patas and Lagoa da Falca. The northern coast is an area marked by evidence of volcanic activity with several mistérios (lava fields), the swimming pools of Biscoitos, while the centre of the island is highlighted by the Algar do Carvão and Furnas do Enxofre (dormant and active volcanic forms) that are popular with tourists and geologists. Most of the island is ringed by coastal cliffs about 20 m (60 ft) high, except on the south coast near Angra do Heroísmo. Here, an eruption of basaltic lava in shallow water formed the tuff cone of Monte Brasil, which protects and shelters the harbor of the island&#x27;s capital. The cone is about in diameter and rises above the western side of the harbor.

===Ecoregions and protected zones===

Away from the coast, Terceira is a wild and hilly landscape with many walking and hiking trails. Much of the interior of the island is a nature reserve; from the heights of the Serra do Cume to the slopes of Santa Bárbara, there are several paths along the patchwork of small farms, stonewalls and forests.

===Human geography===

Much like other islands of the Azores (&quot;Açores)&quot;, human settlement was dictated by the geomorphology of the terrain. The number of volcanic cones and the stratovolcanos that occupy the major part of the interior of the island, forced most communities along the coastal lowlands and river-valleys, producing a &quot;ring&quot; of urbanization that circles the island, usually following the Regional Road network. These communities began as agricultural enclaves, based on subsistence farming and a patchwork of hedged parcels of land. The nuclei of these communities were the religious parishes, and the churches that dot the landscape of the island.

Administratively, Terceira is divided (along an irregular diagonal frontier from north-northwest to south-southeast) into two municipalities: Angra do Heroísmo and Praia da Vitória. The municipality of Angra do Heroísmo is in the southern half of the island, and includes the historical town of Angra, its suburban communities and many of the coastal resort communities (such as Porto Martins). Praia da Vitória is highly concentrated in the north-northeast corner of the island, along an axis between Cabo do Porto and Lajes. It is generally considered the industrialized center of the island, and is the location of one of the two main commercial ports, the international airport and many of the associated businesses associated with the Air Force base. Apart from the uninhabited areas at the center of the island, the northwestern and portions of the western coast are sparsely populated, apart from small agglomerations of homes along the roadways. Within the municipal framework, communities are subdivided into local civil parishes (19 in Angra do Heroismo and 11 in Praia da Vitória), and managed by the executive (that includes a President and cabinet) and the civil committee (with its chairperson and assembly) of the Junta Freguesia.

Angra do Heroísmo, the historical capital of the Azores (&quot;Açores)&quot;, is the oldest city in the archipelago, dating back to 1534. Owing to the importance of the historical center in the &quot;maritime explorations of the 15th and 16th centuries&quot;, UNESCO declared the historical center as a World Heritage Site. This was, in part, due to the fact that, as a link between the New World and Europe, Vasco de Gama, in 1499, and Pedro de Alvarado, in 1536, set up Angra as an obligatory port-of-call for the fleets of equatorial Africa and of the East and West Indies. The classification by UNESCO was based on criteria 4 and 5 that governed the inclusion based on universal historical significance (based on its place in the exploration).

==Economy==
The main economic activity on the island is raising of livestock and the production of dairy-based products. The island has two main sea ports, one at Angra do Heroísmo and the other at Praia da Vitória, and a commercial airport integrated with the flight operations at Base Aérea nº 4 (in the community of Lajes).

==Culture==

The Portuguese bullfight is popular on the island, coming in two variations: the traditional equestrian bullfight (in the ring) and the popular &quot;touradas à corda&quot; that occur in the streets.

Popular since the 16th century, the &quot;touradas à corda&quot; (literally &quot;bullfights-by-rope&quot;) are held by local Terceiran villagers from April/May to late September. In these events, similar to the &quot;Running of the Bulls&quot;, a bull is let loose from the town&#x27;s square (or other open space) with a very long rope around its neck. The other end of the rope are held by eight &quot;pastores&quot;, men dressed in traditional garb (white shirts, grey pants and a black hat), who control the animal from a distance (providing some sense of security). Courageous people then attempt to provoke the animal and get as close to it while avoiding being gored (resulting in the occasional injury or mayhem). Some &quot;touradas à corda&quot; also do away with the rope entirely or become semi-aquatic (when the bulls chase the participants off a dock). Following these &quot;games&quot; the animal is eventually retrieved and a festival will begin.

In some towns, a Portuguese equestrian bullfight will take place involving a grande procession and participation of men dressed in 16th-century costume: the &quot;pantalones&quot; (the &quot;horsemen&quot;), the &quot;bandarilheiros&quot; (the &quot;horsemen&#x27;s squires&quot;), the matadores and the widely popular &quot;forcados&quot; (eight men who challenge the bull). A horsemen, usually riding a Lusitanian breed of horse, is the centre of this event: the rider will attempt to wear out the bull, while lancing a dart onto the bull&#x27;s back. The matadores, in comparison to their Spanish counterparts, play a small role, usually distracting the bull during the event. At the end of each bout/bullfight, the lead &quot;forcado&quot; will challenge the bull to charge, while the remainder of the team follow the leader. The team leader attempts to grab the animal by its horns then, supported by his team, they subdue the bull. Once exhausted, the animal, normally disoriented, barely reacts when the group disperses.

One festivity that is celebrated at large on Terceira is Carnaval. Carnaval, or &quot;Entrudo&quot;as it is called on the island, is celebrated in quite a different way than other cultures around the world. The celebration starts on the Saturday before Ash Wednesday, when halls around the island open their doors to the public who waits to see the performances.

These performances are in the form of dance groups that travel around the island to get on stage and show the work that they put in for the people to enjoy. These dances are a way of showing bravado and magnificence in the form of popular theater. It is essentially a way of entering Lent, the idea behind &quot;entrudo&quot;.

There are different kinds of dances, and they come from the ideas of those who create these different groups. Basically, every dance brings their unique outfits, music, songs as well as a play. The celebration of Carnaval in Terceira ends on the Tuesday before Lent. The tradition is so important within this society that those who have emigrated brought the custom along with them. This can be seen in areas such as Northeastern United States, California and Canada.

Carnaval in Terceira is celebrated between the Saturday and Tuesday stated above, but in reality the planning that is required for this all to occur can take all year. The clothing that groups wear have intricate designs and the songs and plays created just for this day demand much time. There is also a time before Carnaval in which the elderly of the island have their performances in a tradition called &quot;Danças da Terceira Idade&quot;. These are essentially dances created specifically for the elderly to partake in a tradition that they had a hand in upholding.

===LGBTI+ Community===
Though the Azores are generally socially conservative, of all the islands, Terceira is known for having the most open gay male community. The famous twentieth century Terceiran poet, J.H. Santos Barros argued in 1978 that a tradition of homosexuality on the island dated back to the influence of Castilian troops stationed on the island in the 16th century. 

The organisation Opus Diversidade (originally Opus Gay) - one of the oldest LGBTQ+ organisations in Portugal - was founded in Terceira in 1997. The first same sex marriage in the Azores took place in Angra de Heroismo in 2010. In 2013, the documentary film, &quot;O Carnaval é um Palco, a Ilha uma Festa &quot;(&quot;The carnival is a stage, the island a party&quot;) won the best documentary prize at the QueerLisboa Festival. The film reported on the tradition of drag queens (&quot;matrafonas&quot;) at the carnival festivities on Terceira.

<doc id="675649" wikidata="Q2166170" url="?curid=675649" title="Finite verb">
<text>A finite verb is a verb that contextually complements a subject, which can be either explicit (like in the English indicative) or implicit (like in null subject languages or the English imperative). A finite transitive verb or a finite intransitive verb can function as the root of an independent clause. Finite verbs are distinguished from non-finite verbs such as infinitives, participles, gerunds etc.

==History==

The term &quot;finite&quot; is derived from (past participle of &quot;to put an end to, bound, limit&quot;) as the form &quot;to which number and person appertain&quot;. Verbs were originally said to be &quot;finite&quot; if their form limited the possible person and number of the subject. 

More recently, finite verbs have been construed as any verb that independently functions as a predicate verb or one that marks a verb phrase in a predicate. Under the first of those constructions, finite verbs often denote grammatical characteristics such as gender, person, number, tense, aspect, mood, modality, and voice. In the second of those constructions, a modal verb or a certain type of auxiliary verb also may function as a finite verb. Modal verbs and auxiliary verbs mark the abovementioned characteristics to varying degrees or not at all depending on the category from which verbs are drawn.

==Examples==
In the following sentences, the finite verbs are emphasized, while the non-finite verb forms are underlined.
:: Verbs appear in almost all sentences.
:: This sentence is illustrating finite and non-finite verbs.
:: The dog will have to be trained well.
:: Tom promised to try to do the work.
::The case has been intensively examined today. 
::What did they want to have done about that? 
::Someone tried to refuse to accept the offer. 
::Coming downstairs, she saw the man running away.
::I am trying to get the tickets.

In many languages (including English), there can be one finite verb at the root of each clause (unless the finite verbs are coordinated), whereas the number of non-finite verb forms can reach up to five or six, or even more, e.g.

: He was believed to have been told to have himself examined.

Finite verbs can appear in dependent clauses as well as independent clauses:
: John said that he enjoyed reading.
: Something you make yourself seems better than something you buy.

Most types of verbs can appear in finite or non-finite form (and sometimes these forms may be identical): for example, the English verb &quot;go&quot; has the finite forms &quot;go&quot;, &quot;goes&quot;, and &quot;went&quot;, and the non-finite forms &quot;go&quot;, &quot;going&quot; and &quot;gone&quot;. The English modal verbs (&quot;can&quot;, &quot;could&quot;, &quot;will&quot;, etc.) are defective and lack non-finite forms.

It might seem that every grammatically complete sentence or clause must contain a finite verb. However, sentences lacking a finite verb were quite common in the old Indo-European languages, and still occur in many present-day languages. The most important type of these are nominal sentences. Another type are sentence fragments described as phrases or minor sentences. In Latin and some Romance languages, there are a few words that can be used to form sentences without verbs, such as Latin &quot;ecce&quot;, Portuguese &quot;eis&quot;, French &quot;voici&quot; and &quot;voilà&quot;, and Italian &quot;ecco&quot;, all of these translatable as &quot;here ... is&quot; or &quot;here ... are&quot;. Some interjections can play the same role. Even in English, utterances that lack a finite verb are common, e.g. &quot;Yes.&quot;, &quot;No.&quot;, &quot;Bill!&quot;, &quot;Thanks.&quot;, etc.

A finite verb is generally expected to have a subject, as it does in all the examples above, although null-subject languages allow the subject to be omitted. For example, in the Latin sentence &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; (&quot;I think therefore I am&quot;) the finite verbs &quot;cogito&quot; and &quot;sum&quot; appear without an explicit subject – the subject is understood to be the first-person personal pronoun, and this information is marked by the way the verbs are inflected. In English, finite verbs lacking subjects are normal in imperative sentences:

: Come over here!
: Don&#x27;t look at him!

And also occur in some fragmentary utterances with an elliptical subject:

: [It] Doesn&#x27;t matter.
: [I] Don&#x27;t want to go.

==Grammatical categories==
The relatively limited system of inflectional morphology in English often obscures the central role of finite verbs. In other languages, finite verbs are the locus of much grammatical information. Depending on the language, finite verbs can inflect for the following grammatical categories:
* Gender, i.e. masculine, feminine or neuter.
* Person, e.g. 1st, 2nd, or 3rd (I/we, you, he/she/it/they).
* Number, e.g. singular or plural (or dual).
* Tense, i.e. present, past or future.
* Aspect, e.g. perfect, perfective, progressive, etc.
* Mood, e.g. indicative, subjunctive, imperative, optative, etc.
* Voice, i.e. active, middle, or passive.

The first three categories represent agreement information that the finite verb gets from its subject (by way of subject–verb agreement). The other four categories serve to situate the clause content according to time in relation to the speaker (tense), extent to which the action, occurrence, or state is complete (aspect), assessment of reality or desired reality (mood), and relation of the subject to the action or state (voice).

Modern English is an analytic language (Old English is frequently presented as a synthetic language), which means it has limited ability to express the categories by verb inflection, and it often conveys such information periphrastically, using auxiliary verbs. In a sentence such as
: Sam laughs a lot,
the verb form agrees in person (3rd) and number (singular) with the subject, by means of the &quot;-s&quot; ending, and this form also indicates tense (present), aspect (&quot;simple&quot;), mood (indicative) and voice (active). However, most combinations of the categories need to be expressed using auxiliaries:
: Sam will have been examined by this afternoon.
Here the auxiliaries &quot;will&quot;, &quot;have&quot; and &quot;been&quot; express respectively future time, perfect aspect and passive voice. (See English verb forms.) Highly inflected languages like Latin and Russian, however, frequently express most or even all of the categories in one finite verb.

==Theories of syntax==
Finite verbs play a particularly important role in syntactic analyses of sentence structure. In many phrase structure grammars for instance those that build on the X-bar schema, the finite verb is the head of the finite verb phrase and so it is the head of the entire sentence. Similarly, in dependency grammars, the finite verb is the root of the entire clause and so is the most prominent structural unit in the clause. That is illustrated by the following trees:

The phrase structure grammar trees are the a-trees on the left; they are similar to the trees produced in the government and binding framework. The b-trees on the right are the dependency grammar trees. Many of the details of the trees are not important for the point at hand, but they show clearly that the finite verb (in bold each time) is the structural center of the clause. In the phrase structure trees, the highest projection of the finite verb, IP (inflection phrase) or CP (complementizer phrase), is the root of the entire tree. In the dependency trees, the projection of the finite verb (V) is the root of the entire structure.

<text>In computer science, a 2–3 heap is a data structure, a variation on the heap, designed by Tadao Takaoka in 1999. The structure is similar to the Fibonacci heap, and borrows from the 2–3 tree.

Time costs for some common heap operations are:

* &quot;Delete-min&quot; takes formula_1 amortized time and in the worst case.
* &quot;Decrease-key&quot; takes constant amortized time.
* &quot;Insertion&quot; takes constant amortized time and formula_1 time in the worst case.

== Polynomial of trees ==
Source: 

A linear tree of size formula_3 is a sequential path of formula_3 nodes with the first node as a root of the tree and it is represented by a bold formula_5 (e.g. formula_6 is a linear tree of a single node). Product formula_7 of two trees formula_8 and formula_9, is a new tree with every node of formula_8 is replaced by a copy of formula_9 and for each edge of formula_8 we connect the roots of the trees corresponding to the endpoints of the edge. Note that this definition of product is associative but not commutative. Sum formula_13 of two trees formula_8 and formula_9 is the collection of two trees formula_8 and formula_9.

Consider the operation formula_18 on trees formula_19 such that formula_20. The tree formula_21 is produced by linking the root of the tree formula_9 as a child of the root of tree formula_8. Now consider the linear tree formula_5. The tree formula_25 is defined in the following way:

formula_26

The path created from this linking forms the formula_27th trunk of formula_25 which can also be called the formula_27th dimension of the tree.

An r-ary polynomial of trees is defined as formula_30 where formula_31. This polynomial notation for trees of formula_32 nodes is unique. The tree formula_33 is an formula_34 copy of formula_35 such that their roots are connected with formula_36 edges sequentially. The path of these formula_36 edges is called the main trunk of the tree formula_33. Furthermore, an r-ary polynomial of trees is called an r-nomial queue if nodes of the polynomial of trees are associated with keys in heap property. 

=== Operations on r-nomial queues ===
To merge two terms of form formula_39 and formula_40, the trees are reordered in the main trunk based on the keys in the root of trees. If formula_41 there will be a term of form formula_42 and a carry tree formula_43. Otherwise, there is only a tree formula_44. The sum of two r-nomial queues are similar to the addition of two number in base formula_3.

An insertion of a key into a polynomial queue is like merging a single node with the label of the key into the existing r-nomial queue, taking formula_46 time.

A delete operation of the minimum is done by finding the minimum in the root of a tree, say formula_9 and deleting it. The resulting polynomial queue formula_48 is added back to formula_49 in total time formula_46.

== (2,3)-heap ==
Source:

An formula_51 tree formula_52 is defined recursively by

formula_53

The root of the tree formula_52 has degree formula_27, and can be formed by different trees of degree formula_56. The root of formula_52 is called the head node of the formula_27th trunk. The dimension of non-head nodes on the trunk is formula_56, while the dimension of the head node is formula_27 or larger, depending on whether it gets linked again. The tree of type formula_61 on the formula_27th trunk of formula_52 rooted at a node formula_64 is called formula_65.

Informally, a formula_66 tree of dimension formula_67 is formed by linking roots of 2 or 3 trees of dimension formula_68 in a line.

An extended polynomial of trees, formula_69, is defined by formula_70. When keys are assigned to the nodes of an extended polynomial of trees in heap order it is called an formula_71, and the special case of formula_72 and formula_73 is a formula_74. 

Workspace of a Node
The workspace of a node formula_64 is the local neighborhood, defined for nodes not on the main trunks of trees in the heap. Assume the dimension of formula_64 is formula_56, so that it is on an formula_27th trunk. The workspace of formula_64 then consists of all the nodes on the formula_27th trunk, the formula_81th trunk, and those on other formula_27th trunks whose head nodes are on the formula_81th trunk. The workspace is then a collection of nodes between size 4 to 9. The &quot;head node of the workspace&quot; is the node on the first position of the formula_81th trunk. 

=== Operations on (2,3)-heap ===
Insertion: In order to insert a new key, merge the currently existing (2,3)-heap with a single node tree, formula_85 labeled with this key. Since formula_86 in the extended polynomial, there might be a need to adjust for the carry on trees that can occur from the insertion. If a tree formula_52 is being inserted into a tree formula_88 at the top level, there are three cases, depending on the value of formula_89.

# formula_90: there is no tree formula_52 already in the heap, so we it is inserted into the heap. The term formula_52 is added to our extended polynomial.
# formula_93: Form a new tree formula_94 by joining the two trees using one comparison to maintain the heap ordering property of the labels.
# formula_95: A carry of formula_96 is made with two comparisons. Another round of inserting is done with this carry tree on formula_97 in the heap.

Delete-min: First find the minimum by scanning the roots of the trees. Let formula_98 be the tree containing minimum element. Since this tree exists, this means formula_89 was formula_6 or formula_101. Deleting the root of this tree means removing the root of the linear chain formula_89 connecting copies of formula_52. The other copies of formula_52 give a tree of the form formula_105 where formula_106 if formula_93 or formula_108 if formula_95.

The root that was deleted was also the root of the first copy of formula_52, giving 2 or 3 formula_111 trees. Following this pattern, we end up with the collection of trees

formula_112 

where formula_113 is formula_6 or formula_101 for formula_116 and formula_117 as specified above.

This collection forms a heap formula_48 with can then be merged back with formula_119 to make sure only the minimum node was removed from the heap. (The merging operation is done through multiple insertions, each taking at most 3 comparisons).

Removal of a Tree: Trees rooted at the top most trunks of the heap are not removed. To remove the tree formula_65 of type formula_61 of a node formula_64, there are two cases, one where the workspace of formula_64 is of size 4, and another where the size is larger. Note that formula_64 is a node on an formula_27th trunk of the heap.

In a workspace of size larger than 4, the formula_27th trunk either has 2 nodes or 3 nodes. If it has 3 nodes, then it can be of the form formula_127 or formula_128. In either case, remove formula_65 and shrink the trunk. Note that formula_64 cannot be the first node on the formula_27th trunk since that node would be on the formula_81th trunk, which must exist as nodes on the top most trunks are not removed. 

If the formula_27th trunk is of the form formula_134, then remove formula_65 and account for the loss of the formula_27th trunk by moving around some other trees of type formula_61 in the workspace.

For the case in which the workspace is of size 4, remove formula_65 and rearrange the other three nodes so that two come under the head node of the workspace. This makes an formula_27th trunk of length two (three nodes in a line) but causes a loss of an formula_140th trunk. This loss is fixed by moving around trees from workspace of nodes on the formula_141th dimension. This process continues upwards in dimension until it is resolved.

Decrease Key: Assume the key of node formula_64 of dimension formula_56 is decreased, and it is not at the top level. Then formula_65 is removed and inserted into the formula_145th term at the top level of the heap (i.e. formula_146 in the extended polynomial), where formula_147. If formula_64 was at the top level of its tree, then the heap property was not violated from decrease key and no tree removal is required. However, the trunks on the top most trunk formula_27 may need to be rearranged.

=== Analysis of Operations ===

Let the potential of a trunk consisting of three nodes be 3, and the potential of a trunk consisting of two nodes be 1. Define the function formula_8 to be the sum of the potentials of all trunks, and let formula_151. The actual cost will be the number of comparisons performed during the operation. Note that the potential of an empty heap is 0.

Decrease Key The number of nodes on trunks can increase or decrease during the removal of a tree, depending on the size of the workspace. The change in potential and number of comparisons can be observed in each case, which allows for a computation of the amortized cost.

Let the trunks in the cases going left-down be the formula_27th dimension on which one of them formula_64 stands. The trunks going right-down are the formula_81th dimension. The formula_27th trunks are ordered by non-decreasing length, although they are ordered by the labels of their head nodes in practice. 
In cases where formula_156 and case 1 of formula_157, no comparisons are needed because of the heap property and formula_158. The amortized cost in these cases is then formula_159.

In case 1 of formula_157 and both cases of formula_161, at most 1 comparison is needed and formula_162 decreases by 1, making the amortized cost 1.

In the final case where formula_163, at most one comparison is done and formula_164 increases by 1, which gives an amortized cost of 0. The loss of the formula_81th trunk will need to be fixed using the higher workspace of the node before it got removed from the trunk. The fixing process ends in one of the earlier cases or if no higher trunk exists. Since the amortized cost is non-negative and only one of the cases with positive amortized is done in this process, the overall amortized cost is still constant.

Insert When inserting a single node into an existing formula_166 in the tree, there are either 2 comparisons and formula_167 if formula_168 or there is one comparison with formula_169. Therefore the amortized cost is 0 throughout the initial insertion and the carry overs. The actual worst case time is formula_170 due to the carry overs and constant number of comparisons each time.

Delete Min It takes formula_170 time to find the minimum element, and also formula_170 to break apart the smaller subtrees, since there are at most formula_170 of them. To merge the subtrees, formula_170 insertions are done which take a constant amortized time each. The amortized time is then formula_170 and so is the worst case time.

<text>Rājpūt (from Sanskrit &quot;rājaputra&quot; meaning &quot;son of a king&quot;), also called Thākur, is a large multi-component cluster of castes, kin bodies, and local groups, sharing social status and ideology of genealogical descent originating from the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The term Rajput covers various patrilineal clans historically associated with warriorhood: several clans claim Rajput status, although not all claims are universally accepted. According to modern scholars, almost all Rajput clans originated from peasant or pastoral communities.

Over time, the Rajputs emerged as a social class comprising people from a variety of ethnic and geographical backgrounds. From the 12th to 16th centuries, the membership of this class became largely hereditary, although new claims to Rajput status continued to be made in later centuries. Several Rajput-ruled kingdoms played a significant role in many regions of central and northern India from the seventh century onwards.

The Rajput population and the former Rajput states are found in northern, western, central and eastern India, as well as southern and eastern Pakistan. These areas include Rajasthan, Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat, Eastern Punjab, Western Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, Uttarakhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Sindh and Azad Kashmir.

==Etymology and Early references==
===&quot;Rājaputra&quot;===
The word &quot;Rājaputra&quot; (; literally &quot;son of a king&quot;) finds mention in some ancient Hindu scriptures like the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, &quot;Ramayana&quot; and &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. According to Sabita Singh, the word first appears in a sense other than its literal meaning in the 7th century Bakhshali manuscript from NWFP in reference to a mercenary soldier, while in the 8th century Chachnama of Sindh, it is used for elite horsemen. A late 11th century inscription from Mount Abu talks of &quot;all the &quot;rājaputras&quot; of the illustrious &quot;Rājaputra&quot; clan&quot;. In Kalhana&#x27;s &quot;Rājatarangiṇī&quot; (12th century), the &quot;rājaputras&quot; appear as mercenary soldiers claiming high status on account of birth. An inscription from Chittor (1301) mentions three generations of &quot;rājaputras&quot;.

B.D Chattopadhyay says that according to the references to &quot;rajputras&quot; in medieval and early medieval sources, they represent a mixed caste that constituted a large section of &quot;petty chiefs holding estates&quot;.
Thus, the &quot;Rajputra&quot; covers all levels from the actual son of a king to the lowest level landholder. The term is used for a prince under the Chahamanas but for the lowest ranking &quot;fief&quot; holder under the Chalukyas.

Brihaddharma Purana (13th century) considers &quot;Rajputras&quot; as a mixed caste, which, according to Nandini Kapur, was because many social groups including shudras had formed it.

===&quot;Thakur&quot;===

According to B.D Chattopadhyay, from 700 CE, north India&#x27;s political and military landscape was dominated by large Kshatriya landowners called &quot;thakurs&quot;, some of whom were descended from pastoral tribes and central Asian invaders; they later came to be known as Rajputs. Andre Wink notes that the military nobility of Sindh ruler Dahir to which the Chachnama (8th century) and Al-Baladhuri (9th century) refer as &quot;thakurs&quot; can be seen as Rajputs in the original sense of the word.

===&quot;Rajput&quot;===

The term &quot;rajput&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;rājaputra&quot;. Its literal meaning is &quot;son of a king&quot;. The term finds mention in Vidyapati&#x27;s &quot;Kīrtilatā&quot; (1380) among castes inhabiting the Jaunpur city.

According to modern scholars, the word &quot;rajput&quot; meant &#x27;horse soldier&#x27;, &#x27;trooper&#x27;, &#x27;headman of a village&#x27; or &#x27;subordinate chief&#x27; before the 15th century. Individuals or groups with whom the word &quot;rajput&quot; was associated are generally considered &quot;varna–samkara&quot; (&quot;mixed caste origin&quot;) and inferior to Kshatriya.

Richard M. Eaton notes that after the 14th century, &#x27;Rajput&#x27; had become a prestigious title available for adoption by upwardly mobile clan in the process of becoming sedentary. He further says that the lineages in Rajasthan which had traditionally identified themselves as &quot;kshatriya&quot; began to call themselves &quot;Rajputs&quot; in the 16th century. B.D Metcalf and T.R Metcalf write that under the Mughals, the word &quot;Rajput&quot; had become the mark of legitimate kshatriya rule.

Unlike Abu Fazl, Akbars&#x27;s secretary, who considered Rajputs, the Mughal allies, as Kshatriyas descended from the sun and the moon, the Persian scripture &quot;Haft Tamasha&quot; claims Rajputs as Shudras because, in contrast to Kshatriyas, they did not wear the sacred thread, nor did Brahmins accept cooked food from them.

==Origin==
The origin of the Rajputs has been a much-debated topic among historians. Historian Satish Chandra states: &quot;Modern historians are more or less agreed that the Rajputs consisted of miscellaneous groups including Shudra and tribals. Some were Brahmans who took to warfare, and some were from Tribes- indigenous or foreign&quot;. Thus, the Rajput community formation was a result of political factors that influenced caste mobility, called Sanskritization by some scholars and Rajputization by others. Modern scholars agree that nearly all Rajputs clans originated from peasant or pastoral communities.

Alf Hiltebeitel discusses three theories by Raj era and early writers for Rajput origin and gives the reasons as to why these theories are dismissed by modern research. British colonial-era writers characterised Rajputs as descendants of the foreign invaders such as the Scythians or the Hunas, and believed that the Agnikula myth was invented to conceal their foreign origin. According to this theory, the Rajputs originated when these invaders were assimilated into the Kshatriya category during the 6th or 7th century, following the collapse of the Gupta Empire. While many of these colonial writers propagated this foreign-origin theory in order to legitimise the colonial rule, the theory was also supported by some Indian scholars, such as D. R. Bhandarkar. The second theory was promulgated by C.V. Vaidya who believed in the Aryan invasion theory and that the entire 9th-10th century Indian populace was composed of only one race - the Aryans who had not yet mixed with the Shudras or Dravidians. Nationalist historians Vaidya and R.B. Singh write that the Rajputs had originated from the Vedic Aryan Kshatriyas of the epics - Ramayana and Mahabharata. Vaidya bases this theory on certain attributes - such as bravery and &quot;physical strength&quot; of Draupadi and Kausalya and the bravery of the Rajputs. However, Hiltebeitel says that such &quot;affinities do not point to an unbroken continuity between an ancient epic period&quot; in the Vedic period (3500 BCE - 3000 BCE according to Vaidya) and the &quot;great Rajput tradition&quot; that started in sixteenth-century Rajasthan instead &quot;raise the question of similarities between the epics&#x27; allusions to Vedic Vratya warbands and earlier medieval low status Rajput clans&quot;. Hiltebeitel concludes that such attempts to trace Rajputs from epic and Vedic sources are &quot;unconvincing&quot; and cites Nancy MacLean and B.D. Chattopadhyaya to label Vaidya&#x27;s historiography on Rajputs as &quot;often hopeless&quot;. A third group of historians, which includes Jai Narayan Asopa, theorised that the Rajputs were Brahmins who became rulers. However, such &quot;one track arguments&quot; and &quot;contrived evidence&quot; such as shape of the head, cultural stereotypes, etc. are dismissed by Hiltebeitel who refers to such claims and Asopa&#x27;s epic references as &quot;far-fetched&quot; or &quot;unintelligible&quot;.

Recent research suggests that the Rajputs came from a variety of ethnic and geographical backgrounds and various varnas. Rajputs that rose in north-India after muslim invasions were not considered Kshatriyas although they performed similar functions - and Ziegler points out that the facts that they had emerged from the lower rungs of the caste system are documented in the Rajput chronicles themselves.

Pradeep Barua says: &quot;What made the Rajputs stand out from the rest of Indian society was not their foreign origins but their fanatical attempts to assert their Kshatriya status. Over time, other Indian groups followed their example and claimed descent from the solar and lunar races, establishing themselves as Rajputs in various parts of western and central India&quot;.

André Wink states that some Rajputs may be Jats by origin. Tanuja Kothiyal states: &quot;In the colonial ethnographic accounts rather than referring to Rajputs as having emerged from other communities, Bhils, Mers, Minas, Gujars, Jats, Raikas, all lay a claim to a Rajput past from where they claim to have &#x27;fallen&#x27;. Historical processes, however, suggest just the opposite&quot;. She points to the fact that &quot;both Rajputs and Jats appear to originate from the mobile cattle rearing and rustling groups&quot;, hence it is understandable that they refer to each other in their chronicles, although they try to remain distinct. However, since Rajputs dominated the region, they were portrayed as &quot;warriors&quot; as opposed to Jats who were portrayed as &quot;farmers&quot;, thus wiping out &quot;Jat kingship&quot; from the historiography.

According to scholars, in medieval times &quot;the political units of India were probably ruled most often by men of very low birth&quot; and this &quot;may be equally applicable for many clans of &#x27;Rajputs&#x27; in northern India&quot;. Burton Stein explains that this process of allowing rulers, frequently of low social origin, a &quot;clean&quot; rank via social mobility in the Hindu Varna system serves as one of the explanations of the longevity of the unique Indian civilisation.

Historian Janet Tiwary Kamphorst mentions the medieval tales on Pabuji depicting Rajput, Charan, Bhil and Rabari warriors fighting side by side as well as other medieval and contemporary texts show claims made by Nomadic tribes of the Thar desert to a higher rank in the society. Thus, she says that it is said that &quot;formerly all Rajputs were once Maldhari(cattle-keepers) or vice-versa, it is asserted that all nomadic peoples have Rajput &quot;ansa&quot; (essence) in their veins&quot;

Gradually, the term Rajput came to denote a social class, which was formed when the various tribal and nomadic groups became landed aristocrats, and transformed into the ruling class. These groups assumed the title &quot;Rajput&quot; as part of their claim to higher social positions and ranks. The early medieval literature suggests that this newly formed Rajput class comprised people from multiple castes. Thus, the Rajput identity is not the result of a shared ancestry. Rather, it emerged when different social groups of medieval India sought to legitimise their newly acquired political power by claiming Kshatriya status. These groups started identifying as Rajput at different times, in different ways. Thus, modern scholars summarise that Rajputs were a &quot;group of open status&quot; since the eighth century, mostly illiterate warriors who claimed to be reincarnates of ancient Indian Kshatriyas – a claim that had no historical basis. Moreover, this unfounded Kshatriya status claim showed a sharp contrast to the classical varna of Kshatriyas as depicted in Hindu literature in which Kshatriyas are depicted as an educated and urbanite clan. Historian Thomas R. Metcalf mentions the opinion of Indian scholar K. M. Panikkar who also considers the famous Rajput dynasties of medieval India to have come from non-Kshatriya castes.

Nandini Kapur states that the 17th century Sanskrit text &quot;sudrakamalakara&quot; equates the word &quot;Rajput&quot; with &quot;Ugra&quot; - &quot;a mixed caste that born of the union of a Kshatriya man and a Shudra woman&quot; because many groups in society including shudras got incorporated into the group. But Ananya Vajpeyi argues that the term &quot;rajapūta&quot;, which is used in the dharmashastra, has a different meaning from &quot;Rājpūt&quot; in realpolitik. With an unhistorical meaning, even if the dharmashastras attempt to fix the place of a jati like &#x27;rajapūta&#x27; close to shudra, the socio-historical type &#x27;Rājpūt&#x27; always gravitates to the Kshatriya varna, which makes the lexical similarity between the two words semantically misleading.

Stewart Gordon writes that during the era of the Mughal empire, hypergamous marriage &quot;marrying up&quot;, combined with service in the state army was another way a tribal family could &quot;become&quot; Rajput. This process required a change in dress, diet, worship, and other traditions, ending widow remarriage, for example. Such a marriage between someone from a tribal family, and a member of an acknowledged - but possibly poor - Rajput family, would ultimately enable the non-Rajput family to rise to Rajput status. This marriage pattern supports the fact that Rajput was an &quot;open caste category&quot;, available to those who served the Mughals.

Rajput formation continued in the colonial era. Even in the 19th century, anyone from the &quot;village landlord&quot; to the &quot;newly wealthy lower caste Shudra&quot; could employ Brahmins to retrospectively fabricate a genealogy and within a couple of generations they would gain acceptance as Hindu Rajputs. This process would get mirrored by communities in north India. This process of origin of the Rajput community resulted in hypergamy as well as female infanticide that was common in Hindu Rajput clans. Scholars refer to this as &quot;Rajputisation&quot;, which, like Sanskritisation, was a mode for upward mobility, but it differed from Sanskritisation in other attributes, like the method of worship, lifestyle, diet, social interaction, rules for women, and marriage, etc. German historian Hermann Kulke has coined the term &quot;Secondary Rajputisation&quot; for describing the process of members of a tribe trying to re-associate themselves with the former chief of their tribe who had already transformed himself into a Rajput via Rajputisation and thus become Rajputs themselves.

According to some scholars, the term &quot;rajputra&quot; was reserved for the immediate relatives of a king; scholars like BD Chattopadhyay believe that it was used for a larger group of high-ranking men.

== Emergence as a community ==
There are historical indications of the group calling themselves Rajputs settling in Indo-Gangetic Plain by the 6th century. However, scholarly opinions differ on when the term Rajput acquired hereditary connotations and came to denote a clan-based community.
An opinion asserts that the terms like &quot;rajputra&quot; and &quot;rāuta&quot; began to be more commonly used from 12th century onwards to denote a large number of people and a Rājaputra/Rajput caste established itself well before the thirteenth century. The reference to the clan structure of Rajputs in contemporary historical works like &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; by Kalhana along with other epigraphic evidences indicates their existence as a community by 12th century.

While &quot;Rajatarangini&quot; puts the number of Rajput clans at 36, the &quot;Varna Ratnakara&quot; (1324) features a list of 72 Rajput clans including &quot;Chouhāna&quot;, &quot;Pamāra&quot;, &quot;Chandella&quot;, &quot;Kachchvāha&quot;, &quot;Guhilot&quot;, &quot;Gāndhavariyā&quot;, &quot;Baisvara&quot;, &quot;Bhaṭi&quot; etc.

Historian Brajadulal Chattopadhyaya, based on his analysis of inscriptions (primarily from Rajasthan), believed that by the 12th century, the term &quot;rajaputra&quot; was associated with fortified settlements, kin-based landholding, and other features that later became indicative of the Rajput status. According to him, the title acquired &quot;an element of heredity&quot; from c. 1300. A study of 11th–14th century inscriptions from western and central India, by Michael B. Bednar, concludes that the designations such as &quot;rajaputra&quot;, &quot;thakkura&quot; and &quot;rauta&quot; were not necessarily hereditary during this period.

Rajputs were involved in nomadic pastoralism, animal husbandry and cattle trade until much later than popularly believed. The 17th century chronicles of Muhnot Nainsi i.e. &quot;Munhata Nainsi ri Khyat&quot; and &quot;Marwar ra Paraganan ri Vigat&quot; discuss disputes between Rajputs pertaining to cattle raids. In addition, Folk deities of the Rajputs – Pabuji, Mallinath, Gogaji and Ramdeo were considered protectors of cattle herding communities. They also imply struggle among Rajputs for domination over cattle and pasturelands. The emergence of Rajput community was the result of a gradual change from mobile pastoral and tribal groups into landed sedentary ones. This necessitated control over mobile resources for agrarian expansion which in turn necessitated kinship structures, martial and marital alliances.

B.D Chattopadhyaya opines that during its formative stages, the Rajput class was quite assimilative and absorbed people from a wide range of lineages. However, by the late 16th century, it had become genealogically rigid, based on the ideas of blood purity, Dirk Kolff writes. The membership of the Rajput class was now largely inherited rather than acquired through military achievements. A major factor behind this development was the consolidation of the Mughal Empire, whose rulers had great interest in genealogy. As the various Rajput chiefs became Mughal feudatories, they no longer engaged in major conflicts with each other. This decreased the possibility of achieving prestige through military action, and made hereditary prestige more important.

According to David Ludden, the word &quot;Rajput&quot; acquired its present-day meaning in the 16th century. According to Kolff, during 16th and 17th centuries, the Rajput rulers and their bards (&quot;charans&quot;) sought to legitimise the Rajput socio-political status on the basis of descent and kinship. They fabricated genealogies linking the Rajput families to the ancient dynasties, and associated them with myths of origins that established their Kshatriya status. This led to the emergence of what Indologist Dirk Kolff calls the &quot;Rajput Great Tradition&quot;, which accepted only hereditary claims to the Rajput identity, and fostered a notion of eliteness and exclusivity. The legendary epic poem &quot;Prithviraj Raso&quot;, which depicts warriors from several different Rajput clans as associates of Prithviraj Chauhan, fostered a sense of unity among these clans. The text thus contributed to the consolidation of the Rajput identity by offering these clans a shared history.

Despite these developments, migrant soldiers made new claims to the Rajput status until as late as the 19th century. In the 19th century, the colonial administrators of India re-imagined the Rajputs as similar to the Anglo-Saxon knights. They compiled the Rajput genealogies in the process of settling land disputes, surveying castes and tribes, and writing history. These genealogies became the basis of distinguishing between the &quot;genuine&quot; and the &quot;spurious&quot; Rajput clans.

==History==
=== History of Rajput Kingdoms===


Scholars stage emergence of Rajput clans as early as seventh century AD. when they start to make themselves lords of various localities and dominate region in current day Northern India. These dynasties were the Gurjara-Pratiharas, Chahamanas (of Shakambhari, Nadol and Jalor), the Tomaras of Delhi, the Chaulukyas, the Paramaras, the Gahadavalas, Chandela, Sisodias, Guhilas etc. However, term &quot;Rajput&quot; has been used as an anachronistic designation for leading martial lineages of 11th and 12th centuries that confronted the Ghaznavid and Ghurid invaders, although the Rajput identity for a lineage did not exist at this time, these lineages were classified as aristocratic Rajput clans in the later times.
The Rajput ruled kingdoms repelled early invasions of Arab commanders after Muhammad ibn Qasim conquered Sindh and executed last Hindu king of the kingdom, Raja Dahir. Rajput family of Mewar under Bappa Rawal and later under Khoman fought off invasions by Arab generals and restricted them only until the border of Rajasthan but failed to recapture Sindh. By the first quarter of 11th century, Turkic conqueror Mahmud Ghaznavi launched several successful military expeditions in the territories of Rajputs, defeating them everytime and by 1025 A.D, he demolished and looted the famous Somnath Temple and its Rajput ruler Bhimdev Solanki fled his capital. Rajput rulers at Gwalior and Kalinjar were able to hold off assaults by Maḥmūd, although the two cities did pay him heavy tribute. By last quarter of 12th century, Muhammad of Ghor expelled the Ghaznawids from their last bastion in Lahore in 1186, thereby securing the strategic route of Khyber Pass. After capturing the northwest frontier, he invaded Rajput domain. In 1191, Prithviraj Chauhan of Ajmer led a coalition of Rajput kings and defeated Ghori near Taraori. However, he returned a year later with an army of mounted archers and crushed Rajput forces on the same battlefield of Taraori, Prithviraj fled the battlefield but was caught near Sirsa and was executed by Ghurids. Following the battle, the Delhi Sultanate became prominent in the Delhi region.
The Rajputs fought against Sultans of Delhi from Rajasthan and other adjoining areas. By first quarter of 14th century, Alauddin Khalji sacked key Rajput fortresses of Chittor (1303), Ranthambor (1301) and other Rajput ruled kingdoms like Siwana and Jalore. However, Rajputs resurgence took place under Rana Hammir who defeated Tughlaq army of Muhammad bin Tughluq in Singoli in 1336 CE and recaptured Rajasthan from Delhi sultanate. In the 15th century, the Muslim sultans of Malwa and Gujarat put a joint effort to overcome the Mewar ruler Rana Kumbha but both the sultans were defeated. Kumbha&#x27;s grandson renowned Rana Sanga inherited a troubling kingdom after death of his brothers but through his capable rule turned traditional kingdom of Mewar into one of the greatest power in northern India during the early 16th century. Sanga defeated Sultans of Gujarat, Malwa and Delhi several times in various battles and expanded his kingdom. Sanga led a grand alliance of Rajput rulers and defeated the Mughal forces of Babur in early combat but was defeated at Khanwa through Mughal&#x27;s use of Gunpowder which was unknown in Northern India at the time. His fierce rival Babur in his autobiography acknowledged him as the greatest Hindu king of that time along with Krishnadevaraya. After a few years Maldev Rathore of Marwar rose in power controlling almost whole portion of western and eastern Rajasthan.
From 1200 CE, many Rajput groups moved eastwards towards the Eastern Gangetic plains forming their own chieftaincies. These minor Rajput kingdoms were dotted all over the Gangetic plains in modern-day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. During this process, petty clashes occurred with the local population and in some cases, alliances were formed. Among these Rajput chieftaincies were the Bhojpur zamindars and the taluks of Awadh.

The immigration of Rajput clan chiefs into these parts of the Gangetic plains also contributed the agricultural appropriation of previously forested areas, especially in South Bihar. Some have linked this eastwards expansion with the onset of Ghurid invasion in the West.
From as early as the 16th century, Purbiya Rajput soldiers from the eastern regions of Bihar and Awadh, were recruited as mercenaries for Rajputs in the west, particularly in the Malwa region.

The Rajput kingdoms were disparate: loyalty to a clan was more important than allegiance to the wider Rajput social grouping, meaning that one clan would fight another. This and the internecine jostling for position that took place when a clan leader (raja) died meant that Rajput politics were fluid and prevented the formation of a coherent Rajput empire.

=== Mughal period ===
Rajputs played an important role in the Mughal history. From Akbar&#x27;s rule, Rajput leaders were integrated into the Mughal ruling elite through court appointments and matrimonial alliances. Mughal emperors like Jahangir and Shah Jahan were born from Rajput mothers. Due to the presence of princes born to Rajput mothers in the Mughal harem as well as Rajput officers serving in the Mughal army, the Rajput values got diffused into the Mughal imperial system. 

====Babur&#x27;s period====
The defeat of a Rajput coalition by Babur in the Battle of Khanwa is considered a turning point in the history of North India.

====Humayun&#x27;s period====
Rajput ruler Rana Prasad of Amarkot gave refuge to Humayun and his pregnant wife when they were fleeing from India, and, it was in his fortress that young Akbar was born. After returning to India, Humayun tried to make good relations with zamindars, both Hindu as well as Muslim. His attempts to foster positive connections with the Rajputs are viewed as a strategy aimed at engaging the local ruling classes of the country.

==== Akbar&#x27;s period ====

After the mid-16th century, many Rajput rulers formed close relationships with the Mughal emperors and served them in different capacities. It was due to the support of the Rajputs that Akbar was able to lay the foundations of the Mughal empire in India. Some Rajput nobles gave away their daughters in marriage to Mughal emperors and princes for political motives. For example, Akbar accomplished 40 marriages for himself, his sons and grandsons, out of which 17 were Rajput-Mughal alliances. Akbar&#x27;s successors as Mughal emperors, his son Jahangir and grandson Shah Jahan had Rajput mothers. Although Rajput rulers provided the brides to the Mughals, neither Akbar nor his successors provided brides to the Rajput rulers. For example, Akbar got this sisters and daughters married to Timurids and prominent Muslims from central and west Asia. Historian Michael Fisher states that the bards and poets patronized by the Rajput rulers who served Akbar raised Akbar to a &quot;semi-divine&quot; status and gives an example of Akbar being projected as a &quot;divine master&quot; in the &quot;Hindu cosmic order&quot;. The writer also finds correlation between the increasing numbers of Hindu Rajput wives in Akbar&#x27;s household and Hindu Rajputs as well as non-Rajput Hindus in his administration to the religious and political policy followed by him towards non-Muslims which included ending the prohibition on the construction of new temples of non -Muslim faiths like Hindu, Jain etc. In 1564 AD, Akbar had also stopped collection of &quot;jaziya&quot; from non-Muslims, a tax considered as discriminatory by several non-Muslims which also consisted of his Hindu Rajput officials.
The ruling Sisodia Rajput family of Mewar made it a point of honour not to engage in matrimonial relationships with Mughals and thus claimed to stand apart from those Rajput clans who did so. Rana Pratap is renowned as a &quot;Rajput icon&quot; for firmly fighting with Akbar&#x27;s forces for the cause of Mewar&#x27;s freedom. Once Mewar had submitted and alliance of Rajputs reached a measure of stability, matrimonial between leading Rajput states and Mughals became rare.

==== Shah Jahan&#x27;s period ====

One of the most conspicuous event of Shah Jahan&#x27;s period was rebellion of Bundela rajputs, which was crushed by prince Aurangzeb with iron hand.

==== Aurangzeb&#x27;s period ====

Aurangzeb had banned all Hindus from carrying weapons and riding horses but exempted the Rajputs.
Akbar&#x27;s diplomatic policy regarding the Rajputs was later damaged by the intolerant rules introduced by his great-grandson Aurangzeb. A prominent example of these rules included the re-imposition of Jaziya, which had been abolished by Akbar. However, despite imposition of Jaziya Aurangzeb&#x27;s army had a high proportion of Rajput officers in the upper ranks of the imperial army and they were all exempted from paying Jaziya. The Rajputs then revolted against the Mughal empire. Aurangzeb&#x27;s conflicts with them, which commenced in the early 1680s, henceforth became a contributing factor towards the downfall of the Mughal empire.

====Later====
Historian Lynn Zastoupil states that the Mughal Emperors had manipulated the appointment of the successor of the Rajput rulers earlier. However, in the early 18th century, when the Mughal power declined, Rajput states enjoyed a brief period of independence. But soon the Maratha Empire (or confederacy) started collecting tribute from and harassing some Rajput states. Some Rajput states, in 1800s, appealed to the British East India Company for assistance against the Marathas but their requests for assistance were denied at the time.

By 1765, Awadh had become ally of the British East India Company and the increase in demand for revenue led to a continuous tussle in between the Nawab of Awadh and Rajput leadership bringing political instability in the region.

In one 18th century example given by Pinch, Rajputs of Awadh countered the upward mobility of some of the peasant castes, who by virtue of their economic prosperity sought higher status by wearing &quot;Janeu&quot;, a sacred thread or claimed &quot;Kshatriya&quot; status. The records indicates that during the tenure of Asaf-ud-Daula in Awadh, when a section of Awadhiya Kurmi were about to be bestowed with the title of &quot;Raja&quot;, the Rajput constituency of Asaf&#x27;s court caused stiff opposition to the move despite the fact that the Rajputs themselves were newcomers to the court and were peasant-soldiers a few year before. Rajputs of Awadh along with Brahmins also formed the major groups who gained during Asaf&#x27;s regime.

===British colonial period===

In the late eighteenth century, despite the request from two Rajput rulers for British support, the British East India company initially refused to support the Rajput states in Rajputana region as they had the policy of non-interference and considered the Rajput states to be weak. In the early nineteenth century, British administrator Warren Hastings realised how alliance with the Rajputs had benefited the Mughals and believed that a similar alliance may give the East India company political advantage in India. In his journal, in January 1815, he noted that Rajput states - Jaipur, Jodhpur and Udaipur had been &quot;devastated&quot; by the Scindia, Holkars, Pindari, Ameer Khan and Muhammad Shah Khan and that the Rajput rulers made multiple petitions to him requesting British protection. Moreover, the Rajput rulers had argued that &quot;British had replaced the Mughal Empire as the supreme power of India and therefore had the responsibility to protect weaker states from aggressive ones&quot;. Charles Metcalfe agreed with this reasoning. One by one, many Rajput states in Rajputana came under British protection and became their allies - Kota, Udaipur, Bundi, Kishangarh, Bikaner, Jaipur, Pratapgarh, Banswara, Dungarpur, Jaisalmer by 1817-18 and Sirohi by 1823. The British promised to protect the Rajput states from their adversaries and not interfere in internal affairs in exchange for tribute. However, David Ochterlony, who was in charge of the Rajput states broke the promise to not interfere as in his view interferences would save the states from &quot;ruin&quot;. In 1820, the British removed him from his position and replaced him with Charles Metcalfe. For several decades, &quot;non-interference&quot; in internal affairs remained the official policy. However, according to the historian Lynn Zastoupil, the &quot;British never found it possible or desirable to completely withdraw from interference in Rajput affairs&quot;.

The medieval bardic chronicles (&quot;kavya&quot; and &quot;masnavi&quot;) glorified the Rajput past, presenting warriorhood and honour as Rajput ideals. This later became the basis of the British reconstruction of the Rajput history and the nationalist interpretations of Rajputs&#x27; struggles with the Muslim invaders. James Tod, a British colonial official, was impressed by the military qualities of the Rajputs but is today considered to have been unusually enamoured of them.
Although the group venerate him to this day, he is viewed by many historians since the late nineteenth century as being a not particularly reliable commentator. Jason Freitag, his only significant biographer, has said that Tod is &quot;manifestly biased&quot;.

As per the historian Thomas R. Metcalf, Rajput Taluqdars in Oudh provided a large numbers of leaders to the revolt of 1857 in that region. Kunwar Singh, a Rajput Zamindar was an important leader in Bihar region in the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Historian Robert Stern points out that in Rajputana, although there were some revolts in the soldiers commanded by British officers the &quot;Rajpur durbar muskeeters and feudal cavalrymen&quot; did not participate in the 1857 revolt at all. But Crispin Bates is of the opinion that Rajput officers had soft corner for the rebels of 1857 fleeing Delhi who were entering into interior areas of then Rajasthan region. He gives examples of rebels who easily found safe havens in villages of Chittor without arrests.

The Rajput practices of female infanticide and &quot;sati&quot; (widow immolation) were other matters of concern to the British. It was believed that the Rajputs were the primary adherents to these practices, which the British Raj considered savage and which provided the initial impetus for British ethnographic studies of the subcontinent that eventually manifested itself as a much wider exercise in social engineering.

During the British rule their love for pork, i.e. wild boar, was also well known and the British identified them as a group based on this.

Some unrelated communities tried to change their status to Rajput during the Colonial era. William Rowe, discusses an example of a Shudra caste - the Noniyas (caste of salt makers)- from Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. A large section of this caste that had &quot;become&quot; &quot;Chauhan Rajputs&quot; over three generations in the British Raj era. The more wealthy or advanced Noniyas started by forming the &quot;Sri Rajput Pacharni Sabha&quot; (Rajput Advancement Society) in 1898 and emulating the Rajput lifestyle. They also started wearing of Sacred thread. Rowe states that at a historic meeting of the caste in 1936, every child in this Noniya section &quot;knew&quot; about their &quot;Rajput heritage&quot;. Similarly, Donald Attwood and Baviskar give and example of a caste of shepherds who were formerly Shudras changed their status to Rajput in the Raj era and started wearing the Sacred thread. They are now known as Sagar Rajputs. The scholars consider this example as a case among thousands.

===Post Independence===
====Princely States====
On India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the princely states, including those of the Rajput, were given three options: join either India or Pakistan, or remain independent. Rajput rulers of the 22 princely states of Rajputana acceded to newly independent India, amalgamated into the new state of Rajasthan in 1949–1950. Initially the maharajas were granted funding from the Privy purse in exchange for their acquiescence, but a series of land reforms over the following decades weakened their power, and their privy purse was cut off during Indira Gandhi&#x27;s administration under the 1971 Constitution 26th Amendment Act. The estates, treasures, and practices of the old Rajput rulers now form a key part of Rajasthan&#x27;s tourist trade and cultural memory.

The Rajput Dogra ruler of Kashmir and Jammu acceded to India in 1947, while retaining his title until the monarchy was abolished in 1971 by the 26th amendment to the Constitution of India.

Before the zamindari abolition, the Rajputs in Oudh formed the major Taluqdars and had controlled over 50 percent of the land in the most districts of the region. Historian Thomas R. Metcalf explains that in the province of Uttar Pradesh, majority of the Taluqdars with moderate to large estates were composed of Rajput caste. He also mentions that Rajputs were only next to Brahmins in the ritual hierarchy and also gave the secular elite of the state. According to him, the community controlled most of the best agricultural land in the region and this also helped the Rajput Taluqdars who were usually the head of the local Rajput clan to gather support over non-Rajput rival in the electoral politics of the state.

====Affirmative Action====
The Rajputs, in most of the states, are considered a General caste (forward caste) in India&#x27;s system of positive discrimination. This means that they have no access to reservations. But they are classified as an Other Backward Class by the National Commission for Backward Classes in the state of Karnataka. Some Rajputs in various states, as with other agricultural castes, demand reservations in Government jobs. In 2016, Sikh Rajputs were added under Backward Classes in Punjab but after protest by the community, the government announced that they will be again put under General Category.

==Demographics==

=== India ===
In 1931, Rajputs comprised 3.7% of British India&#x27;s population. Currently, the region-wise estimates of Rajputs&#x27; share in population are, in descending order: 35% for Uttarakhand, 28% for Himachal Pradesh, 9% in Madhya Pradesh, 7-8% for Uttar Pradesh, 6% for Rajasthan, 5% for Gujarat, 3.45% for Bihar, and 3.4% for Haryana.

In 2008, it was estimated that, in terms of absolute numbers, Rajputs in India numbered 40 million, the breakdown by state being, in descending order: just under 10 million in Uttar Pradesh, 5 million in Madhya Pradesh, 4 million in both Rajasthan and Bihar, 2 million in both Uttarakhand and Gujarat, over 1 million in both Haryana and Himachal Pradesh and just under 1 million in both Maharasthra and Delhi.

=== Pakistan ===

In Pakistan the census is done on a linguistic basis, so it&#x27;s harder to come across the population of Rajputs, who are mostly Muslim, at a national level, but at a local level the Punjab government has provided the following numbers: Rajputs constitute 32% of the Kasur District, which as per the 2023 census would give a population of around 1.3 million, 20% of the Gujranwala District, and 5% of the Lahore District.

Many others Rajputs live in other places of the Punjab province as well in Sindh (including Karachi) and Azad Kashmir, in Azad Kashmir being slightly less 10% than the total population with 500,000. Hindu Rajputs of Sodha clan are concentrated in Umerkot and Tharparkar districts.

In 2008, it was estimated that the Rajput population in Pakistan stood at 15 million, with around 9 million in Punjab, nearly 5 million in Sindh, followed by 643,000 in Azad Kashmir, 223,000 in Islamabad, 174,000 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 37,000 in Balochistan.

=== Nepal ===
Rajputs form 0.16% of Nepal&#x27;s population or around 50,000 individuals based on 2024 estimations.

==Subdivisions==

The term &quot;Rajput&quot; denotes a cluster of castes, clans, and lineages. It is a vaguely-defined term, and there is no universal consensus on which clans make up the Rajput community. In medieval Rajasthan (the historical Rajputana) and its neighbouring areas, the word Rajput came to be restricted to certain specific clans, based on patrilineal descent and intermarriages. On the other hand, the Rajput communities living in the region to the east of Rajasthan had a fluid and inclusive nature. The Rajputs of Rajasthan eventually refused to acknowledge the Rajput identity claimed by their eastern counterparts, such as the Bundelas. The Rajputs claim to be Kshatriyas or descendants of Kshatriyas, but their actual status varies greatly, ranging from princely lineages to common cultivators.

There are several major subdivisions of Rajputs, known as &quot;vansh&quot; or &quot;vamsha&quot;, the step below the super-division jāti These &quot;vansh&quot; delineate claimed descent from various sources, and the Rajput are generally considered to be divided into three primary vansh: Suryavanshi denotes descent from the solar deity Surya, Chandravanshi (Somavanshi) from the lunar deity Chandra, and Agnivanshi from the fire deity Agni. The Agnivanshi clans include Parmar, Chaulukya (Solanki), Parihar and Chauhan.

Lesser-noted &quot;vansh&quot; include Udayvanshi, Rajvanshi. The histories of the various &quot;vansh&quot;s were later recorded in documents known as &quot;vamshāavalīis&quot;; André Wink counts these among the &quot;status-legitimizing texts&quot;.

Beneath the &quot;vansh&quot; division are smaller and smaller subdivisions: &quot;kul&quot;, &quot;shakh&quot; (&quot;branch&quot;), &quot;khamp&quot; or &quot;khanp&quot; (&quot;twig&quot;), and &quot;nak&quot; (&quot;twig tip&quot;). Marriages within a &quot;kul&quot; are generally disallowed (with some flexibility for kul-mates of different &quot;gotra&quot; lineages). The &quot;kul&quot; serves as the primary identity for many of the Rajput clans, and each &quot;kul&quot; is protected by a family goddess, the &quot;kuldevi&quot;. Lindsey Harlan notes that in some cases, &quot;shakh&quot;s have become powerful enough to be functionally &quot;kul&quot;s in their own right.

==Culture and ethos==

The Bengal army of the East India Company recruited heavily from upper castes such as Brahmins and Rajputs of north-central India particularly from the region of Awadh and Bihar. However, after the revolt of 1857 by the Bengal sepoys, the British Indian army shifted recruitment to the Punjab.

===Martial race===
The Rajputs were designated as a Martial Race in the period of the British Raj. This was a designation created by administrators that classified each ethnic group as either &quot;martial&quot; or &quot;non-martial&quot;: a &quot;martial race&quot; was typically considered brave and well built for fighting, whilst the remainder were those whom the British believed to be unfit for battle because of their sedentary lifestyles. However, the martial races were also considered politically subservient, intellectually inferior, lacking the initiative or leadership qualities to command large military formations. The British had a policy of recruiting the martial Indians from those who has less access to education as they were easier to control. According to modern historian Jeffrey Greenhunt on military history, &quot;The Martial Race theory had an elegant symmetry. Indians who were intelligent and educated were defined as cowards, while those defined as brave were uneducated and backward&quot;. According to Amiya Samanta, the martial race was chosen from people of mercenary spirit (a soldier who fights for any group or country that will pay him/her), as these groups lacked nationalism as a trait.

===Deities===

One of the most revered deities of Rajputs is Karni Mata, whom many Rajput clans worship as family goddess and link their community&#x27;s existence or survival in dire times. Lord Shiva (who is very popular all across India) and Goddess Durga are popular deities worshipped by the Hindu Rajputs. Lord Shiva&#x27;s image is found in the shrines in the homes of many of the Rajput families. In Sikh Rajputs, Guru Ram Rai is quite popular. The fierce form of Goddess Durga, called &quot;Sherawali Mata&quot; or &quot;she who rides a lion&quot; is popular among Rajput women.

The folk deities of the Rajput are Pabuji, Mallinath, Gogaji and Ramdeo.

===Rajput lifestyle===

The Rajputs of Bihar were inventors of the martial art form &quot;Pari Khanda&quot;, which includes heavy use of swords and shields. This exercise was later included in the folk dances of Bihar and Jharkhand like that of Chhau dance. On special occasions, a primary chief would break up a meeting of his vassal chiefs with &quot;khanda nariyal&quot;, the distribution of daggers and coconuts. Another affirmation of the Rajput&#x27;s reverence for his sword was the &quot;Karga Shapna&quot; (&quot;adoration of the sword&quot;) ritual, performed during the annual Navaratri festival, after which a Rajput is considered &quot;free to indulge his passion for rapine and revenge&quot;.
The Rajput of Rajasthan also offer a sacrifice of water buffalo or goat to their family goddess (Kuldevta) during Navaratri. The ritual requires slaying of the animal with a single stroke. In the past this ritual was considered a rite of passage for young Rajput men.

The general greeting used by the Rajputs in social gatherings and occasions, &#x27;&quot;Jai Mataji&quot;&#x27; or its regional variants, stands for &quot;&#x27;Victory to the Mother Goddess&quot;&#x27;. This phrase also operated as a military solgan or war cry, often painted on the shields and banners of the jagirdars.

====Hospitability====
Harald Tambs-Lyche states that like other martial races of South Asia, Rajputs have a reputation for being hospitable i.e. they welcome and are friendly to guests.

====Miscellaneous====

By the late 19th century, there was a shift of focus among Rajputs from politics to a concern with kinship. Many Rajputs of Rajasthan are nostalgic about their past and keenly conscious of their genealogy, emphasising a Rajput ethos that is martial in spirit, with a fierce pride in lineage and tradition.

===Sati===
There have been several cases of &quot;Sati&quot; (burning a widow alive) in Rajasthan from 1943 to 1987. According to an Indian scholar, there are 28 cases since 1947. Although the widows were from several different communities, Rajput widows accounted for 19 cases in Rajasthan. The most famous of these cases is of a Rajput woman named Roop Kanwar. 40,000 Rajputs gathered on the street of Jaipur in October 1987 for supporting her Sati. A pamphlet circulated on that day attacked independent and westernised women who opposed a woman&#x27;s duty of worshipping her husband as demonstrated by the practice of Sati. This incident again affirmed the low status of women in the Rajput community and the leaders of this pro-sati movement gained in political terms.

===Female infanticide===
Female infanticide was practised by Rajputs of low ritual status trying upward mobility as well as Rajputs of high ritual status. But there were instances where it was not practised and instances where the mother tried to save the infant girl&#x27;s life. According to the officials in the early Raj era, in Etawah(Uttar Pradesh), the Gahlot, Bamungors and Bais would kill their daughters if they were rich but profit from getting them married if they were poor.

The methods used of killing the female baby were drowning, strangulation, poisoning, &quot;Asphyxia by drawing the umbilical cord over the baby&#x27;s face to prevent respiration&quot;. Other ways were to leave the infant to die without food and if she survived the first few hours after birth, she was given poison. A common way to poison the infant during breastfeeding was by applying a preparation of poisonous plants like Datura, &quot;Madar&quot; or Poppy to the mother&#x27;s breast.

Social activists in the early nineteenth century tried to stop these practices by quoting Hindu Shastras:
Infanticide has unintended consequences. The Rajput clans of lower ritual status married their daughters to Rajput men of higher ritual status who had lost females due to infanticide. Thus, the Rajputs of lower ritual status had to remain unmarried or resorted to other practices like marrying widows, levirate marriages (marrying brother&#x27;s widow) as well as marrying low-caste women such as Jats and Gujars or nomads. This resulted in widening the gap between Rajputs of low ritual status and Rajputs of high ritual status.

In the late 19th century, to curb the practice, the act VIII of 1870 was introduced. A magistrate suggested:
However, the practical application of the law faced hurdles. It was difficult to prove culpability as in some cases the Rajput men were employed at a distance although the infants could be killed at their connivance. In most cases, Rajput men were imprisoned only for a short time. Between 1888 and 1889, the proportion of girl children rose to 40%. However, the act was abolished in 1912 as punishments were unable to stop infanticide. A historian concludes that &quot;the act, which only scraped the surface of the problem had been unable to civilize or bring about a social change in a cultural world devaluing girl children&quot;. In addition to Rajputs, it was observed that Jats and Ahirs also practised infanticide.

===Brideprice or Bridewealth weddings===
&quot;Bridewealth&quot; is discussed in north Indian Rajputs of 19th century India by the historian Malavika Kasturi. She states that Rajputs belonging to social groups where their women worked in the fields received Bridewealth from the groom&#x27;s family. She adds that evidence shows that the assumption made by officials of the time that female infanticide among clans was a result of poverty and inability to pay dowry is incorrect.

Rajput women could be incorporated into Mughal Harem and this defined the Mughals as overlords over the Rajput clans. The Sisodia clan of Mewar was an exception as they refused to send their women to the Mughal Harem which resulted in siege and mass suicide at Chittor.

Historically, members from the Rajput ruling clans of Rajasthan have also practised polygamy and also took many women they enslaved as concubines from the battles which they won. During numerous armed conflicts in India, women were taken captives, enslaved and even sold, for example, the capture and selling of Marwar&#x27;s women by Jaipur&#x27;s forces in the battle between Jaipur state and Jodhpur state in 1807. The enslaved women were referred to by different terms according to the conditions imposed on them, for example, a &quot;domestic slave&quot; was called &quot;davri&quot;; a dancer was called a &quot;patar&quot;; a &quot;senior female slave–retainer in the women&#x27;s quarters&quot; was called &quot;badaran or vadaran&quot;; a concubine was called &quot;khavasin&quot;; and a woman who was &quot;permitted to wear the veil&quot; like Rajput queens was called a &quot;pardayat&quot;.

The term &quot;chakar&quot; was used for a person serving their &quot;superior&quot; and &quot;chakras&quot; contained complete families from specific &quot;occupational groups&quot; like Brahmin women, cooks, nurses, tailors, washer–women. For children born from the &quot;illegitimate union&quot; of Rajputs and their &quot;inferiors&quot;, the terms like &quot;goli&quot; and &quot;darogi&quot; were used for females and &quot;gola&quot; and &quot;daroga&quot; were used for males. The &quot;courtly chronicles&quot; say that women who were perceived to be of &quot;higher social rank&quot; were assigned to the &quot;harems of their conquerors with or without marriage&quot;. The chronicles from the Rajput courts have recorded that women from Rajput community had also faced such treatment by the Rajputs from the winning side of a battle. There are also a number of records between the late 16th to mid–19th century of the Rajputs immolating the queens, servants, and slaves of a king upon his death. Ramya Sreenivasan also gives and example of a Jain concubine who went from being a servant to a superior concubine called &quot;Paswan&quot;

According to Priyanka Khanna, with Marwar&#x27;s royal Rajput households, the women who underwent concubinage also included women from the Gujar, Ahir, Jat, Mali, Kayastha, and Darji communities of that region. These castes of Marwar claimed Rajput descent based on the &quot;census data of Marwar, 1861&quot;. However research by modern scholars on the forms of &quot;slavery and servitude&quot; imposed by ruling clans of Rajasthan&#x27;s Rajputs between the 16th and early–19th centuries on the captured women faces hurdles because of the &quot;sparse information&quot;, &quot;uneven record–keeping&quot;, and &quot;biased nature of historical records&quot;. 
Ravana Rajput community of today was one such slave community.

The male children of such unions were identified by their father&#x27;s names and in some cases as &#x27;dhaibhai&#x27;(foster-brothers) and incorporated into the household. Examples are given where they helped their step-brothers in war campaigns. The female children of concubines and slaves married Rajput men in exchange for money or they ended up becoming dancing girls. The scarcity of available brides due to female infanticide led to the kidnapping of low caste women who were sold for marriage to the higher clan Rajputs. Since these &quot;sales&quot; were genuinely for the purpose of marriage, they were considered legal. The lower clans also faced scarcity of brides in which case they married women such as those from Gujar and Jat communities. Semi nomadic communities also married their daughters to Rajput bridegrooms for money in some cases.

Of note, the mistreatment or enslavement of women was not unique to Rajputs. Datta notes Bachanan&#x27;s observation in 18th century northern-India that, other than the Rajputs, Khatris and Kayasthas also &quot;openly kept women slaves of any pure tribe&quot;. The offsprings of these women formed one matrimonial group. Similarly, affluent Muslim families in Bihar kept both male and female slaves – called &quot;Nufurs&quot; and &quot;Laundis&quot; respectively.

These Rajput groups (khasa) of Uttarakhand today were formally classified Shudra but had successfully converted to Rajput status during the rule of Chand Rajas (that ended in 1790). Similarly, the Rajputs of Gharwal were originally of low ritual status and did not wear the sacred thread until the 20th century.

===Arts===
The term Rajput painting refers to works of art created at the Rajput-ruled courts of Rajasthan, Central India, and the Punjab Hills. The term is also used to describe the style of these paintings, distinct from the Mughal painting style.

According to Ananda Coomaraswamy, Rajput painting symbolised the divide between Muslims and Hindus during Mughal rule. The styles of Mughal and Rajput painting are oppositional in character. He characterised Rajput painting as &quot;popular, universal and mystic&quot;.

<doc id="675662" wikidata="Q2590601" url="?curid=675662" title="Rana Sanga">
<text>Sangram Singh I (12 April 1482 – 30 January 1528), commonly known as Rana Sanga, was the Rana of Mewar from 1508 to 1528 CE. A member of the Sisodia dynasty, he controlled parts of present-day Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh with his capital at Chittor.
His reign was admired by several of his contemporaries, including the first Mughal Emperor Babur, who described him as the &quot;greatest Indian ruler&quot; of that time. The Mughal historian Abd al-Qadir Badayuni called Sanga the bravest of all Rajputs along with Prithviraj Chauhan also known as Rai Pithaura.

In his military career, Sanga achieved a series of successes against several neighboring sultanates. Following the Battle of Gagron in 1519, Sanga captured much of the Malwa Sultanate and appointed one of his vassals, Medini Rai, to rule over it. He also humbled the Sultan of Gujarat on various occasions. Among his known victories were the multiple defeats inflicted upon the Lodi dynasty of Delhi at Khatoli, Dholpur and Ranthambore.

He united several Rajput rulers for the first time since the Second Battle of Tarain and marched against the invading forces of Babur, who founded the Mughal Empire. Despite initial success at Bayana,Sanga suffered a major defeat at the Khanwa through Babur&#x27;s use of gunpowder weaponry, which was unknown in northern India at the time.

==Early life and accession==
Sanga was born to King Raimal and Queen Ratan Kunwar, a Jhala princess of Halvad. Although contemporary texts do not mention the year of his birth, they provide some of the astrological planetary positions at the time of his birth, calling them auspicious. Based on these positions, assuming certain other planetary positions and based on the Kumbhalgarh inscription, historian Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha calculated Sanga&#x27;s birth year as 1482.

Sanga was the third son of Raimal. However, due to the circumstances and after a fierce struggle with his brothers Prithviraj and Jagmal, in which he lost one of his eyes, he finally succeeded throne of Mewar in 1509.

==Military career==

In his military career, Sanga defeated Sultans of Delhi, Malwa and Gujarat in eighteen pitched battles and expanded his domain by conquering much of Present-day Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and northern part of Gujarat. He also held control over parts of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Amarkot, Sindh.
After his ascension to the throne, Sanga reunited the warring clans of Rajputana through diplomacy and marital alliances. Babur mentioned in the &quot;Baburnama&quot; the challenges he faced in India. He described Sanga as the greatest infidel king of Hindustan alongside Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara Empire in South India. Babur further said, &quot;Sanga had recently grown so great by his audacity and sword that his kingdom included a significant portion of Northern India.&quot; 

According to legends, Sanga had fought a 100 battles and lost only once. He lost his wrist, was crippled in a leg, and counted eighty wounds on his body from the various conflicts. In his illustrious military career, Sanga defeated the Sultans of Delhi, Malwa and Gujarat in 18 pitched battles and expanded his domain by conquering much of present-day Rajasthan. The Rana was also able to dominate Malwa and establish overlordship over northern parts of Gujarat. The Rajputs of India looked at him as their leader against the Sultanates. He re-established Rajput rule in Malwa for the first time since the fall of the Rajput Paramara dynasty in 1305 CE.

He also removed Jizya tax from the Hindus which was earlier imposed by Muslim rulers. He is considered the last independent Hindu king of Northern India to control a significant territory and in some contemporary texts described as &quot;Hindu Emperor&quot;.

=== Invasion of Malwa ===

Medini Rai a rebellious minister of Malwa sultan was having a life and death struggle for throne of Malwa against Mahmud, he was promised aid by Rana Sanga.
As a result, the combined Sultanate forces of Gujarat and Malwa met the Sisodias led by Sanga at Gagron. The battle resulted in a decisive victory of Rajputs.

After the victory in the battle and other skirmishes aftermath Sanga captured eastern and northern Malwa along with Chanderi. Rai made Chanderi his capital, while Silhaditya Tomar establish himself as master of Raisen and Sarangpur region. According to historian Satish Chandra these events took place between 1518 and 1519.

After the victory and establishing Hindu rule in eastern and northern Malwa, Sanga ordered Rai to remove Jizya tax from Hindus of the region.

=== Wars against Lodhis ===
After conquering Malwa, Sanga turned his attention towards northeastern Rajasthan which was then under the control of Ibrahim Lodi, the sultan of Delhi. Ibrahim Lodi, after hearing the news of encroachments by Sanga on his territory, prepared an army and marched against Mewar in 1517. The Rana with his army met Lodi at Khatoli on borders of Hadoti and in the ensuing Battle at Khatoli, Lodi army suffered serious reverses and fled. One Lodi prince was captured and imprisoned. In this battle, Sanga lost an arm by a sword cut, and an arrow made him lame for life.

Lodi, reportedly stunned by this Rajput aggression (the extent of which was unprecedented in the preceding three centuries), once again moved against Mewar in 1518-19 but was humbled again at Battle of Dholpur. Lodi fought Sanga repeatedly, only to be defeated each time, losing his entire land in present-day Rajasthan, while Sanga&#x27;s influence extended up to the striking distance of Pilia Khar in Agra.

According to a 16th-century text &quot;Parshvanath-Shravan-Sattavisi&quot;, Rana Sanga further defeated Ibrahim Lodi at Ranthambore after the Siege of Mandsaur.

=== Campaign in Gujarat ===

The battles of Idar were three major battles fought in the principality of Idar between the armies of the two princes of Idar, Bhar Mal who was supported by the Gujarat Sultanate under Muzaffar Shah II and Rai Mal who was supported by the Rajputs under Rana Sanga. The main reason for Sangas involvement in these battles was to reinstate Rai Mal to his rightful throne and to weaken the growing power of the Gujarat Sultanate. In 1517 Rai Mal with the help of Rana Sanga was able to successfully defeat Muzzafar Shah II and retake his kingdom.

In 1520, Sanga invaded Gujarat on the question of the succession of the state of Idar, with his powerful army of 40,000 Rajputs supported by his three vassals. Rao Ganga Rathore of Marwar too joined him with a garrison of 8,000 Rajputs. The other allies of Rana were Rawal Udai Singh of Vagad and Rao Viram deva of Merta. He defeated the Muslim army of Nizam khan and pursued them to Ahmedabad. Sanga called off his invasion 20 miles before the capital Ahmedabad. He plundered the royal treasuries of Gujarat and destroyed several mosques and built temples over them. After a series of victories, Sanga successfully annexed Northern Gujarat and appointed one of his vassals to rule there.

=== War against Mughals ===
On 21 April 1526, the Timurid king Babur invaded India for the fifth time and defeated Ibrahim Lodhi in the First Battle of Panipat and executed him. After the battle, Sanga unified several Rajput clans for the first time since Prithviraj Chauhan, built an army of 100,000 Rajput soldiers and advanced to Agra.

The Mughals captured Bayana fort which was part of Sanga&#x27;s empire therefore a major clash took place in Bayana in February 1527 in which Mughal forces of Babur led by Abdul Aziz were defeated by Rana Sanga. The defeat of the Mughals was the last of Rana Sanga&#x27;s victories. Confronting a large Hindu army, now incited religious propaganda against the Rajputs by declaring the battle as a &quot;Jihad against the Kaffirs&quot;. He further sought divine favor by abjuring liquor, breaking the wine vessels and pouring the wine down a well.In ensuring battle fought at Khanwa, 37 miles (60 km) west of Agra, on March 16. The Mughals were victorious due to their cannons, matchlocks and other firearms. Sanga was struck by an arrow in mid-battle and was removed from the battle by his brother-in law Prithviraj Kachwaha of Amber along with prince Maldev Rathore in an unconscious state. Following his victory, Babur ordered a tower of enemy skulls to be erected, a practice formulated by Timur against his adversaries, irrespective of their religious beliefs. According to Chandra, the objective of constructing a tower of skulls was not just to record a great victory, but also to terrorize opponents. Earlier, the same tactic had been used by Babur against the Afghans of Bajaur.

Sanga was also betrayed by Silhadi during the battle who changed sides soldiers and went over to Babur.

The victory of Mughals is seen as a landmark event in Mughal conquest of North India as the battle turned out to be more historic and eventful than Panipat because it made Babur the undisputed master of North India while crushing the threatening and reviving Rajput powers. According to historian Andre Wink, after the victory at Khanwa, the centre of Mughal power became Agra instead of Kabul and continued to remain so until its downfall after Ālamgir&#x27;s death. According to modern historians had there not been the cannons of Babur, Sanga might have achieved a historic victory against Babur. Babur&#x27;s cannons had put an end to the outdated trends in Indian warfare.

However it would be wrong to suppose that the Rajput power was crushed for ever, Babar stopped his further invasion in Rajasthan, the Rajput forces encamped at Baswa near Dausa for Sanga&#x27;s treatment, soon after treatment, Sanga started preparation of another war against Babar.

==Death and succession==
Sanga was taken away from the battlefield in an unconscious state by his brother-in-law Prithviraj Singh I Kachwaha and Maldeo Rathore of Marwar. After regaining consciousness he took an oath to not return to Chittor until he had defeated Babur and conquered Delhi. He also stopped wearing a Turban and used to wrap a cloth over his head. While he was preparing to wage another war against Babur, he was poisoned by his own nobles who did not want another conflict with Babur. He died in Kalpi in January 1528 or on May 20, 1528 and was succeeded by his son Ratan Singh II.

After Sanga&#x27;s defeat his vassal Medini Rai was defeated by Babur at Siege of Chanderi and Babur captured the capital of Rai kingdom Chanderi. Medini was offered Shamsabad instead of Chanderi as it was historically important in conquering Malwa but Rao refused the offer and chose to die fighting. The Rajput women and children committed Self-immolation to save their honour from Babur&#x27;s army. Babur subsequently captured Chanderi following his victory which was earlier ruled by Rai.

The power vacuum left by Rana Sanga was filled by Rao Maldeo Rathore. He took over the role as the leading Rajput king and dominated the time period through his increased use of horsemen.

<text>Expo 2000 was a World Expo held in Hanover, Germany from 1 June to 31 October 2000. It was located on the Hanover Fairground (Messegelände Hannover), which is the largest exhibition ground in the world. Initially, some 40 million people were expected to attend the exhibition over the course of months; however, eventually with less than half of this number, the Expo was a flop and turned out to be a financial failure.

The Expo&#x27;s masterplan was designed in a joint venture with Studio d&#x27;Arnaboldi / Cavadini, Locarno and AS&amp;P (Albert Speer und Partner GmbH).

==History==

===Background===
On 14 June 1990, the international organization sanctioning World Expos Bureau International des Expositions awarded Expo 2000 to Hanover, beating out Toronto by a 21 to 20 vote. In 1992, the architects Studio Arnaboldi/Cavadini of Locarno won an international design competition for the master plan of the exhibition grounds. On 12 June that year, a survey conducted by the city council was made public, showing only 51.5% of area residents supported hosting the expo.

===Construction===
On 5 May 1994, a new company was created by the government in Bonn, Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung und Durchführung der Weltausstellung EXPO 2000 in Hannover (EXPO 2000 Hannover GmbH). Headed by chairman Helmut Werner, the company was responsible for the construction and management of the Expo.

In 1995, the supervisory board agreed on the concept for the thematics of the Expo. Construction finally began on 22 April 1996.

Unlike previous expos, which focused on present advances in science and technology, EXPO 2000 focused more on developing and presenting solutions for the future.

===World Expo 2000===
The Expo opened to the public on 1 June 2000 and ran for five months, ending on 31 October.

The Expo site was situated on the original 1,000,000 square meters of the Hanover fairground; an additional 600,000 m2 was also made available as a newly opened section of the grounds. As a visitor walked in and tickets were taken, looking above to the approximately four-story-high ceiling, a visitor would have noticed the huge circular pods that held large TVs showing animated people greeting the visitors and providing tourist information in different languages. Some ten large McDonald&#x27;s restaurants were also built, along with restaurants representing several of the exhibitor countries. Small retail locations were also set up to supply Expo merchandise. The United States reversed its decision to take part at a relatively late stage, and the area set aside for the American pavilion was left undeveloped.

40,000,000 visitors were expected at Expo 2000, but only 25,210,000 people came to see the event. This led to a financial deficit of about US$600,000,000. With pre-ordered tickets priced at 69 DM, the Expo seemed expensive compared to other days out. Commentator Georg Giersberg wrote in the &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine&quot; that entrance fees for Germany&#x27;s 53 main theme parks cost on average less than half the price of the Expo (about 30 DM). Other financial shortfalls came from a lack of corporate sponsorship, since it cost US$4.8 million to be an official product supplier or US$14.5 million to become a world partner.

Part of the failure of the Expo was a lack of clear perception of what to expect at Expo 2000, not helped by a &quot;cerebral&quot; advertising campaign that had failed to explain what the Expo was for. In a 2000 &quot;Time&quot; article, a Berlin-based marketing firm, Scholz &amp; Friends, stated that &quot;the organizers have failed to convey to the public a clear image of what Expo 2000 is going to be: an entertainment park, a blown-up museum, or a nature reserve.&quot; In the same article, Ralf Strobach, secretary of &quot;Hanover&#x27;s Citizens&#x27; Initiative for Environment Protection&quot;, said that &quot;For a long time, companies were unsure if they would be putting money in an eco-show or a showcase for their latest inventions.&quot; Only after the Expo was open and clearly not meeting expectations was a new advertising campaign created, aimed at the domestic market with British actor Peter Ustinov and German television star Verona Feldbusch and stressing the fun side of the Expo, under the slogan &quot;Das gibt&#x27;s nur einmal, es kommt nie wieder&quot; (&quot;This only happens once, it&#x27;s never coming back&quot;).

The German band Kraftwerk created a vocoded speech signature theme, &quot;Expo 2000&quot;, which was also developed into a single of the same name. Later, a remix single &quot;Expo Remix&quot; was released. The band was also paid US$190,000 for a five-second jingle, leading Chancellor Gerhard Schröder to state that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t have spent so much money&quot;.

== Settlement ==
The western slope of Kronsberg emerged in the late 1990s in conjunction with the EXPO 2000, established an environmental point of settlement at the Hannover Expo. The district is a result of independent evolutionary history and unique structure, often perceived as a separate district.

===National===

In total, 155 nations took part. Some are outlined below:

*The Bhutan Pavilion – A Buddhist Temple brought from Bhutan to the World Exhibition in Hannover, having been prefabricated in 16,000 construction parts in Bhutan.
*Finland – Titled &quot;Wind Nest&quot;, the building was created by architects Sarlotta Narjus and Antti-Matti Siikala. Four-storey twin buildings measuring 50 x 7.5 m each were clad in heat-treated thermowood. The two buildings were connected by bridges, allowing visitors to move amongst the three exhibit halls on the first two stories. A 15 m wide birch forest was also created.
*Germany – Designed by architect Wund Gruppe, the 24,000 m² building was the largest nation pavilion at Expo.
*Japan – The Japanese Pavilion was a gridshell structure made out of recycled paper tubes that created a honeycomb-like building. The German authorities refused to allow a paper-only structure, literally held together at the joints by tape, so a secondary supporting structure made of wood was created to obtain the needed legal approval. Designed by architect Shigeru Ban along with consultants Frei Otto (the German architect who created the Olympic Stadium (Munich) and the German pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal), Buro Happold (the British engineering firm which created the Millennium Dome) and Stefan Polonyi (a structural engineering professor), the building took 3 weeks to assemble and covered an exhibit area of 72 m (long) x 35 m (wide) x 15.5 m (high), pavilion lot size: 5,450 m² and building surface area: 3,600 m².
*Latvia – about 300,000 people participated in the &quot;Zime&quot; project created by Armands Strazds and Modris Tenisons.
*Lithuania – The pavilion was designed by Marina and Audrius Bučas, Gintaras Kuginys, Valdas Ozarinskas and Aida Čeponytė. The building was a futuristic glossy yellow. The main attraction was the film &quot;Flight over Lithuania&quot;.
*Mexico – The pavilion consisted of five separate buildings linked by ramps, and after the Expo, was relocated to the Braunschweig Fine Arts College. The architect was Ricardo Legorreta.
*Monaco – Monaco contributed at the exhibition by constructing a hypermodern modular prefabricated pavilion which was designed by the architect Hans Ferdinand Degraeuwe.
*Mongolia – Mongolia participated at the exhibition by constructing a nomadic town of the 13th century, called &quot;Chingis’s Town&quot;, covering one hectare. The pavilion was designed by the architect Adiya Baldandorj Bayud, to show the ger residences of Great Khans of the Mongol Empire of the 13th century. The feature of this town was that it created the town with ger, ger-carriage and various kinds of cotton residents, which are different in forms, sizes and applications, used by Mongolians of that century. Moreover, the King’s privilege armchair, clothing and accessories of ancient heroes and weapons were shown in the &quot;Chingis&#x27;s Town&quot;.
*Netherlands was located at &#x27;3&#x27; Europa Boulevard, and the Dutch pavilion was one of the most popular buildings, winning international acclaim, and was designed by the firm MVRDV. The theme of the 36 m high building (the Expo&#x27;s tallest structure) was &quot;Holland creates Space&quot;. Six Holland eco-system landscapes were stacked to showcase how a country can make the most out of a small space. Guests entered on the ground floor and moved through the exhibit space via grand exterior staircases that wrapped around the building. The top level contained a small lake surrounded with windmills that generated power for the building. The interior spaces were designed by MET Studio. The original plan was to dismantle the building and move it back to Amsterdam, but it was determined that it would be much cheaper to just create a new building from scratch. As of 2006, the building sits empty and is partially looted with windows smashed and garbage everywhere.
*Portugal – Designed by architects Álvaro Siza Vieira and Eduardo Souto de Moura, the 2,350 m² pavilion was located on the &quot;Europa Boulevard&quot;. The prefabricated two-story building was covered with around 55 tons of expanded cork agglomerate and with hand-made glazed tiles on the patio and had a double glass fibre canvas membrane roof.
*Spain – Designed with the theme &quot;Familiarity and Solidarity.&quot;
*Switzerland – The 3019 square meter pavilion designed by Peter Zumthor was built of stacked wooden beams of larchwood and Scots pine held together by steel rods and springs.
*United Arab Emirates – The 3000 m² pavilion, situated on a 6000 m² plot (the largest of the Expo sites), was a recreated desert fort. Designed by the French architect Alain Durand-Heriot, the exhibit tried to evoke the feeling of being in the Arab state. The main attraction was a 360° circular cinema. The building was 84 m × 36 m and built out of recyclable materials. The theme of the pavilion was &quot;From the traditional to the modern&quot; and presented the history of the country.
*Venezuela – The pavilion was a convertible tent structure which opened and closed like a flower. It was very lightweight, was constructed with no waste and completely re-usable. The flower petals were positioned according to the weather, to shade, keep dry or allow sun to shine on the pavilion. It was designed by Fruto Vivas and Frei Otto with SL Rasch.

===Other===
*Planet m – Media for Mankind – The Bertelsmann pavilion, designed by TRIAD Berlin, explored the importance of the media. Guests were brought to the exhibition by the world&#x27;s largest elevator, which could transport up to 200 people at once. Today, the building is used by the University of Applied Sciences Hannover.
*BMW World – The exhibit focused on BMW&#x27;s efforts to create clean-energy operated vehicles. The BMW 750hL Clean Energy car was on display. There were also exhibits on the possibilities of solar- and water-fueled cars. Daimler Chrysler also operated Lab.01, an interactive laboratory showcasing mobility devices including mini-robots.
*EU European Union – The pavilion presented the European Union&#x27;s vision of Europe. The walk-through exhibit was divided into seven zones: 50&#x27;s, Time Shuttle, Euro, Blue Planet, Bridge, Tunnel, Here and Now.
*Global House – The building housed the One World Cafe and a variety of exhibits, including Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Wisdom from the Earth, a display of 26 initiatives by indigenous groups from around the globe. Each initiative was shown in a flight case and featured text, images, and in many cases, contemporary handicraft. The exhibit was the first opportunity for indigenous people to represent themselves at a World Expo.
*WWF (World Wildlife Fund) – Pavilion
*The ZERI Pavilion – The largest bamboo structure designed by Simón Vélez, was built by 41 Colombian wood workers in less than three months. Over 4,500 bamboos (&quot;Guadua angustifolia&quot;) were joined to construct this building. Nine months of intensive scientific research and testing first enabled the acquisition of a temporary permit, and after the building was constructed twice (once in Manizales, Colombia and once in Hanover), the final permit was granted the day before the opening of the Expo 2000. This pavilion presented seven projects from around the world which demonstrated that it is possible to respond to everyone&#x27;s needs on Earth with what we have. The projects from Colombia, Zimbabwe, Fiji, Sweden and Japan inspired many young people. The ZERI Pavilion had an estimated 6.4 million visitors, but it had no doors and no queues.
*Christ Pavilion – Christ Pavilion of the Protestant and Catholic churches in Germany, 2001 reconstructed at the monastery Volkenroda.

==Legacy==

Some of the buildings on the Expo site were sold after EXPO 2000 ended, but most of the exhibition area is still used for major fairs in Germany, as it has been since 1949. The southeastern area around Expo Plaza has been turned into Hanover&#x27;s new centre of information technology, design, media and arts.

Most of the national pavilion buildings were demolished, or disassembled and shipped to their home countries, following the Expo. Some buildings were retained, including the Netherlands Pavilion. The structure has now fallen into disrepair, until earlier in December 2017, when architecture company MVRDV announced plans to restore and renovate the Netherlands pavilion to accommodate future users.

A glass sculpture called &quot;United Earth&quot; by Tomasz Urbanowicz exhibited as part of the Lower Silesian Presentation in the Polish Pavilion was later handed over by the City of Wrocław to the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The sculpture is the main central point of the Agora of the Louise Weiss building designed by Architecture-Studio.

<doc id="675677" wikidata="Q1758839" url="?curid=675677" title="Litter box">
<text>A litter box, also known as a sandbox, cat box, litter tray, cat pan, potty, pot, or litter pan, is an indoor feces and urine collection box for cats, as well as rabbits, ferrets, miniature pigs, small dogs, and other pets that instinctively or through training will make use of such a repository. They are provided for pets that are permitted free roam of a home but who cannot or do not always go outside to excrete their metabolic waste.

Cats are fastidious by nature. Free-roaming domestic cats will attempt to cover their urine and especially their faeces within their home range, in proximity of their food area. To achieve this, they rake the surface in a backward sweeping motion with their front paws to draw loose material over the waste. The efficiency of these attempts is limited by soil texture, as cats have to break the surface with their toes due to their claws being protractile. Still, on rare occasions outdoor cats have been observed trying to dig holes to deposit their excrements in. The raking behaviour is associated with sniffing the waste and will often follow from it. Raking is said to occur rarely when the motivation behind elimination is to engage in scent marking. At thirty days of age, domestic kittens start to exhibit the innate behaviour of raking loose sand or soft dirt. This initially occurs in advance of elimination and can be combined with ingesting particles.

Cat litter boxes are designed to stimulate feline instincts around waste elimination and provide a cat with loose material that is easy to rake over the waste. A litter box&#x27;s bottom is typically filled with or less of cat litter. Litter box filler is a loose, granular material that absorbs moisture and odors such as ammonia. Some litter brands contain baking soda to absorb such odors, or owners may sprinkle a thin layer in the bottom of the box, under the cat litter. The litter material also satisfies a cat&#x27;s instinctive desire to hide their scent by allowing them to bury their waste. The most common material is clay, although recycled paper &quot;pellets&quot; and silica-based &quot;crystal&quot; variants are also used. Sometimes, when an owner wishes to stimulate the cat&#x27;s natural instincts, natural dirt is used.

The litter can give off a strong odor, and must be disposed of periodically. It is recommended that the litter box be kept in low traffic areas of the home, such as a basement or laundry room to avoid litter box aversion. There are commercially available special types of litter to help cover or lessen the odor produced. They contain baking soda, plant extracts and/or odorized crystals. If kept in a room with an intake vent, an air freshener may be added on the furnace filter to isolate the odor from the rest of the house.

==Types of litter box filler==
Edward Lowe accidentally discovered that clay made an excellent cat litter material and began selling it in bags as &quot;Kitty Litter&quot; in 1947. In the US, cat litter is a $2 billion industry consuming of mined clay annually.

===Non-clumping conventional litter===
The first commercially available cat litter in the United States was &quot;Kitty Litter&quot;, available in 1947 and marketed by Ed Lowe. This was the first large-scale use of clay (in the form of Fuller&#x27;s earth) in litter boxes; previously sand was used. Clay litter is much more absorbent than sand and is manufactured into large grains or clumps of clay, making it less likely to be tracked from the litter box. The brand name &quot;Kitty Litter&quot; has become a genericized trademark, used by many to denote any type of cat litter. Today, cat litter can be obtained at a variety of retail stores. Non-clumping cat litter is often made of zeolite, diatomite and sepiolite.

===Clumping litter===
====Clay====

Litter clumps were first developed by using calcium bentonite clay. This was manufactured in the UK in the 1950s by the Fuller&#x27;s Earth Union (FEU), which later became a part of Laporte Industries Ltd. Subsequently in America, clumping bentonite was developed in 1984 by biochemist Thomas Nelson. Most are made from granulated bentonite clay, which clumps together when wet and forms a solid mass separate from the other litter in the box. This solid clumped material can be scooped out and disposed of without changing the entire contents of the litter box.

Clumping litter usually also contains quartz or diatomaceous earth (sometimes called diatomaceous silica, which causes it to be mistakenly confused with silica gel litter). Because of the clumping effect, the manufacturers usually instruct not to flush clumping litters down the toilet, because it could clog it.

Clumping clay cat litters are natural products. Some may also contain naturally occurring crystalline silica, or silica dust, which in California is treated as a known carcinogen under Proposition 65. Clay litter is also criticized by the manufacturers of non-clay litter because the components of clay litter are commonly obtained from a strip mine in an environmentally degrading process.
This sort of litter can be toxic to ferrets, leading to both respiratory and digestive problems.

====Non-clay====
Clumping litter for cats has also been produced from materials other than clay. The New York-based New York Stock Exchange-listed company Minerals Technologies offers a clumping cat litter in the form of crystals made of &quot;compacted baking soda&quot;, which in contrast to bentonite is either dust-free or low-dust, and allegedly &quot;100% CO2 neutral&quot;. Minerals Technologies claims to hold a patent related to this solution.

===Biodegradable litter===
Biodegradable litters are made from various plant resources, including pine wood pellets, recycled newspaper, clumping sawdust, Brazilian cassava, pea husk, corn, wheat, walnuts, barley, soy pulp, and dried orange peels.

Each year, more than two million tons of cat litter ends up in landfills in the US alone. Primarily, this is not biodegradable or renewable and adds to the waste burden. Some pet owners prefer biodegradable litters due to its friendliness to the environment. Biodegradable cat litter can also be eliminated completely by safely composting the used litter at home. Other cat owners can be attracted to the biodegradable litters because of their flushability or deodorizing properties. Some pets, such as those with asthma or sensitive senses of smell, may also benefit from the reduced dust in some forms of biodegradable litter.

Biodegradable litter packaged for cats tends to be more expensive than traditional clay litters, so cost is often not a positive factor in their selection. Most biodegradable litters last longer than the equivalent clay or clumping clay litters. Grain-based animal or poultry feed also provides an economical alternative to products marketed specifically as cat litter. Additionally, most of these forms of litter are recycled from human usage and are thus reusing a waste product as opposed to drawing clay from mines.

Guar gum was the principal clumping agent used in biodegradable cat litter as of 2013, with a clumping rate of 69.8%, while xanthan gum (73.9%) and plantago gum (57.5%) were identified in one study as potential alternatives. It is also added to bentonite litter to increase its clumping capacity. In 2020, it was still being used in tests of new wood-based biodegradable litter formulations.

===Silica gel litter===

Silica gel litter, often referred to as &quot;crystal litter&quot;, is a porous granular form of silicon dioxide, has the highest absorbency of any litter, and has excellent moisture control and complete odor elimination for an extended period of time compared to other litters. It is typically prepared through a sol-gel process, which involves the hydrolysis and condensation of silica precursors such as tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) or sodium silicate (Na2SiO3). The porous structure of silica gel enables it to trap moisture within its network of interconnected pores, effectively locking away urine and preventing it from spreading or leaking. Moreover, many silica gel litter formulations incorporate activated carbon or other odor-neutralizing compounds, which further enhance the litter&#x27;s ability to control unpleasant smells. In addition to its physical structure, the chemical composition of silica gel also contributes to its performance as a cat litter. The surface of silica gel is covered with silanol (Si-OH) and siloxane (Si-O-Si) functional groups. These groups interact with water molecules through hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions, enabling the material to absorb and retain moisture effectively.

Some owners praise its absorbency because can absorb liquid and odor for up to 30 days for one healthy normal weight cat. It is important to lightly stir the crystals daily while scooping the solid waste, otherwise urine can pool in the box. When crystal litter is saturated, at the end of 30 days or so, it begins to smell and is visibly saturated (the white crystals have turned slightly yellow). In comparison, over the same time period it may take or more of clay or clumping litter, because it is necessary to replenish the litter that is removed when the clumped urine is scooped out. No replenishing is necessary with silica gel (crystal) litter.

==Types==

===Open litter pans===
An open litter pan is generally the most basic and least expensive design. They are commonly constructed out of plastic, however some disposable models exist, in the shape of a rectangular tray with outwardly sloped sides high. Open litter pans allow for maximum ventilation which may increase cat comfort. They show the waste most visibly which cat experts like Jackson Galaxy point out helps cat carers monitor current health status. 

Litter pans with low walls are not ideal for containing litter when a pet scratches or digs. Some animals may urinate or defecate over the walls. Some designs include a detachable rim to help catch litter when the animal kicks to bury their waste.

===Enclosed litter boxes===

A variety of enclosed litter boxes exist that include both the tray and hood. Many are constructed out of plastic and feature a plastic hood or dome that covers the litter pan and litter. The pet enters through an opening in the cover, these may be open or have a swinging door. To clean, pet owners lift the cover off the tray to scoop and change the litter. Covered litter boxes may help reduce the amount of litter that is tracked outside the box, may help address issues of pets eliminating waste over the walls of a litter pan, and may help contain odor. However, it can allow odors to build up which will affect the cat&#x27;s comfort. While it offers privacy, it may be too confining for the cat. In the wild, cats do not prefer covered locations for toilet use.

===Top-entry litter boxes===
Top entry litter boxes have an opening on the top of the box and require the pet to climb on top of the box and into a hole to eliminate waste. While cats in good physical health, even kittens, have no problems accessing these boxes, they are generally not recommended for geriatric or physically limited felines. However, top-entry designs do have the added benefit of deterring other pets or young children from the contents of the litter box. Some designs feature a grate on top which allows litter from a cat&#x27;s paws to fall back into the box, reducing litter tracking.

===Self-cleaning litter boxes===

Self-cleaning litter boxes employ technology that automates the litter box emptying procedure. Some models have electric combing mechanisms that automatically scoop the clumps out of the litter box into a sealed, disposable-bag-lined container after the animal has used it. These models use a pressure pad or an infrared light to determine when the cat has left the box and will comb the box after a pre-determined amount of time has passed to avoid disturbing the cat. Other designs take this one step further by connecting directly to a home&#x27;s plumbing (faucet connection and drain) so they can wash, rinse and dry the permanent litter pellets automatically.
Simpler designs exist as well; for example, some require the owner to manually shake the clumps into an easy-to-remove tray. Another variant has an enclosed sphere which rotates as it sifts out the clumps and deposits them in a drawer below the sphere. A new method involves incorporating sifting functionality within a sifting litter liner. Some automated litter boxes incorporate the use of a two-belt system. The top belt has litter ready to use while the lower belt has a batch of litter ready &quot;on hold&quot; for when the cleaning process takes place. As the litter on the bottom belt is moved up to the top, is it evenly distributed across the width of the top belt.

===Disposable litter boxes===
Disposable litter boxes are designed to free cat carers from inconveniences of dealing with animal waste besides just throwing the entire box away. Some may come with an included bag of litter. They are also marketed for use inside of pet crates or carriers to eliminate accidents.

=== Litter box furniture and cabinets ===
To hide a litter pan in plain sight, litter box furniture is designed to open and fit litter pans inside. Cats can access through a front, side, or top entrance. These cabinets are constructed of wood or wood composite and offered in different colors and styles, from traditional to contemporary. Features can include storage drawers, odor filters, wall liners, and external litter catches. While prices can vary from moderate to expensive, litter box furniture can help hide litter pans as well as contain odors.

== Alternatives ==
Instead of using a litter box, it is possible to train cats and dogs to use a toilet. Doing so significantly reduces waste, but for cats it goes against their instinct of burying waste. Combined with the requirement of jumping up onto the toilet, cats may find using a toilet stressful. In addition, excrement-based symptoms of medical problems are less likely to be spotted. There is also a higher likelihood of conflict with human use of toilets.

Another option for animals to relieve themselves indoors is to use an absorbent &quot;potty pad&quot;, also known as a &quot;puppy pad.&quot;

The final option is to train a cat or dog to relieve themselves outside. Given a yard or outside area, a cat can be easily trained to go outside. This will be their natural instincts, but for a dog it can be more challenging.

<text>Edward John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer (24 January 192429 March 1992), styled Viscount Althorp until June 1975, was a British nobleman, military officer, and courtier. He was the father of Diana, Princess of Wales, and the maternal grandfather of William, Prince of Wales, and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex.

==Early life, education and military career==
Lord Spencer was born Edward John Spencer, Viscount Althorp, the only son and younger child of Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, and his wife the former Lady Cynthia Hamilton, second daughter of the 3rd Duke of Abercorn. He was born on 24 January 1924 in their family home at 24 Sussex Square, Bayswater, London. He was educated at Eton, the Royal Military College at Sandhurst, and the Royal Agricultural College. Popularly known to his family and friends as Johnnie Althorp, he served as a captain in the Royal Scots Greys from 1944 to 1945, and was Mentioned in Dispatches. He landed in France the day after D-Day. He led a British Army unit in an operation to liberate two French towns, La Neuve-Lyre and La Vieille-Lyre. From 1947 to 1950, he served as Aide-de-Camp to His Excellency Lieutenant-General Sir Willoughby Norrie, then Governor of South Australia.

He was engaged to 1950&#x27;s debutante of the year, Lady Anne Coke (later Anne Tennant, Baroness Glenconner, lady-in-waiting to Princess Margaret). His father objected to the match on the grounds of &quot;mad blood&quot;, a reference to the institutionalised relatives of the queen, and the engagement was broken off. Much later, the director of the Murdoch Children&#x27;s Research Institute thought that a genetic disease in the Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis family may have killed male members of the family in early childhood and caused learning disabilities in females.

Spencer held the offices of County Councillor for Northamptonshire (1952), High Sheriff of Northamptonshire (1959) and Justice of the Peace for Norfolk (1970). He served as equerry to King George VI (1950–52) and to Queen Elizabeth II (1952–54), and was invested as a Member (fourth class) of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1954. Prior to 1984, the grades of Lieutenant and Member were classified as Members (fourth class) and Members (fifth class), respectively, but both with the post-nominals MVO. He was known by the courtesy title Viscount Althorp until 1975 when he became the 8th Earl Spencer upon his father&#x27;s death. He was Member of the House of Lords from 9 June 1975 (the day his father died and he inherited the peerage) until his own death.

==Family life==
On 1 June 1954 Spencer and the Hon. Frances Ruth Roche, the younger daughter of the 4th Baron Fermoy, were married in Westminster Abbey by Percy Herbert, Bishop of Norwich. Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the royal family attended the wedding ceremony. They had five children:
* Lady Elizabeth &quot;Sarah&quot; Lavinia Spencer (born 19 March 1955), goddaughter of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, married Neil Edmund McCorquodale on 17 May 1980 and had issue
* Lady Cynthia &quot;Jane&quot; Spencer (born 11 February 1957), goddaughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, married Robert Fellowes, Baron Fellowes, on 20 April 1978 and had issue
* Hon. John Spencer (12 January 1960 – 12 January 1960), died within ten hours of his birth
* Lady Diana Frances Spencer (1 July 1961 – 31 August 1997), married to Charles, Prince of Wales (later Charles III), from 1981 to 1996 and had issue
* Charles Edward Maurice Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer (born 20 May 1964), godson of Queen Elizabeth II, married first to Victoria Lockwood from 1989 to 1997 and had issue, married second to Caroline Hutton from 2001 to 2007 and had issue, and married third to Karen Villeneuve on 18 June 2011 and had issue

According to author Penny Junor &quot;Johnny could be violent, and [Frances] felt she and her children would be safer out of the home&quot;. Their daughter Diana also recalled &quot;seeing my father slap my mother across the face and I was hiding behind the door and she was crying&quot;.

The marriage was not a happy one, and in 1967, Frances left John to be with Peter Shand Kydd, an heir to a wallpaper fortune in Australia, whom she had met the year before. Frances lived with Diana and Charles in London during the separation, but during that year&#x27;s Christmas holidays, Viscount Althorp refused to let his children return to London with their mother. John and Frances Spencer were divorced in 1969. Immediately thereafter, Frances married Peter Shand Kydd and John was granted custody of their children by the courts after his former mother-in-law, Ruth Roche, Baroness Fermoy, testified against her own daughter. In 1976, Lord Spencer married Raine McCorquodale, the former wife of the 9th Earl of Dartmouth and daughter of Captain Alexander McCorquodale, a British Army officer, and the romantic novelist Dame Barbara Cartland.

In 1978, Spencer suffered a severe stroke, from which, at one stage, he was not expected to recover, and which kept him in hospital for eight months. Shortly before his death, he was hospitalised for pneumonia. He died of a heart attack in 1992, and was succeeded by his only surviving son, Charles. His funeral was held at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Great Brington, and his ashes were interred in the family vault beneath the Spencer chapel.

<text>Gordon Gray (May 30, 1909 – November 26, 1982) was an American attorney and government official during the administrations of Harry Truman (1945–53) and Dwight Eisenhower (1953–61) associated with defense and national security.

==Biography==

===Family===

Gordon Gray was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the son of Bowman Gray Sr. and Nathalie Lyons Gray. He was married in 1938 to the former Jane Boyden Craige, and they had four sons: Gordon Gray Jr., Burton C. Gray, C. Boyden Gray and Bernard Gray. After Jane&#x27;s death, Gray married the former Nancy Maguire Beebe. His father Bowman, his uncle James A. Gray Jr. and later his brother, Bowman Gray Jr., were all heads of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. In 1942, he was described as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s wealthiest young men&quot;.

His son, C. Boyden Gray, a graduate of Harvard and the University of North Carolina Law School, served as White House counsel for President George Herbert Walker Bush. His nephew, Lyons Gray, also a graduate of both North Carolina and Yale, is a former member of the North Carolina House of Representatives, chief financial officer of the Environmental Protection Agency, and state Secretary of Revenue.

===Education===
Gordon Gray attended Woodberry Forest School for high school. He graduated from the University of North Carolina in 1930, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Beta chapter) and the secretive, Order of Gimghoul. He earned his law degree from Yale Law School in 1933 and practiced law for two years in New York City before returning to Winston-Salem. UNC presented Gray with an honorary law degree in 1949.

===Public career===
Gray began his public life as a lawyer. In 1937, he bought the Piedmont Publishing Company, owner of the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal, The Twin City Sentinel,&quot; and WSJS radio. He added W41MM (the state&#x27;s first FM station) in 1941, WSJS-FM in 1947 and WSJS-TV in 1953. In 1941, he was one of the directors of the short-lived American Network FM radio network. He sold the newspapers in 1968, but formed Triangle Broadcasting to hold onto WSJS-AM-FM-TV. He also bought the local cable franchise for Winston-Salem, a move that forced him to sell off the broadcasting outlets in 1972.

He served in the North Carolina General Assembly from 1939 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1949, representing Forsyth County. He entered the U.S. Army in 1942 as a private and rose to captain, serving in Europe with General Omar Bradley&#x27;s forces. Gray&#x27;s service to the federal government began with his appointment as President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s assistant secretary of the army in 1947; two years later, he was appointed Secretary of the Army. Gordon Gray ordered West Point to add a portrait of Lee wearing Confederate gray at the &quot;height of his fame.&quot; He served in this post from 1949 until 1950. The following year he became director of the newly formed Psychological Strategy Board which planned for and coordinated government psychological operations; he remained in the post until his resignation in January 1952, all the while continuing to lead the University of North Carolina. He was the second president of the Consolidated University of North Carolina, succeeding Frank Porter Graham in 1950.

In 1954 Gray chaired a committee appointed by AEC chairman Lewis Strauss, which recommended revoking Robert Oppenheimer&#x27;s security clearance. The Gray Board, as it was known, issued its split decision on May 27, 1954, with Gray and Thomas A. Morgan recommending the revocation, despite their finding that Oppenheimer was a &quot;loyal citizen.&quot; Ward V. Evans, a conservative Republican and the third member of the board, dissented, saying that most of the allegations against Oppenheimer had been heard before, in 1947, when he had originally received his clearance. In &quot;American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer,&quot; Martin Sherwin and Kai Bird severely criticize Gray&#x27;s handling of the hearings. Gray allowed AEC lawyers to brief the board for a full week without Oppenheimer&#x27;s counsel being present. Moreover, Gray let the prosecutors use documents and testimonies to which Oppenheimer&#x27;s attorneys were denied access, as well as material that had been obtained by illegal means, including unwarranted wiretaps. Sherwin and Bird called the Gray Board a &quot;veritable kangaroo court in which the head judge accepted the prosecutor&#x27;s lead&quot;. In 2022 Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm set aside the revocation findings.

Gray shocked proponents of public education in North Carolina when he said, in a November 1954 Founder&#x27;s Day speech at Guilford College, that &quot;if I had to make a choice between a complete system of publicly supported higher education or a complete system of private higher education, I would choose the latter as a greater safeguard of the things for which we live.&quot; Less than a year later, Secretary of Defense Charles Erwin Wilson named Gray assistant secretary for international security affairs and Gray&#x27;s brief career in academia was ended.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Gray to head the Office of Defense Mobilization in 1957, where he served until the office&#x27;s consolidation in 1958. Eisenhower then appointed Gray his National Security Advisor from 1958 until 1961. On January 18, 1961, President Eisenhower awarded Gray the Medal of Freedom. He served on the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board under Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford. In 1976, he was awarded the United States Military Academy&#x27;s Sylvanus Thayer Award.

From 1962 to 1963, Gray was head of the Federal City Council, a group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C.

Gray was also publisher of the &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot;, chairman of the board of Piedmont Publishing Company, and chairman of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

===Death===
Gray died on November 26, 1982, of cancer in his home in Washington, D.C. He was buried at Salem Cemetery in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

<text>Fabless manufacturing is the design and sale of hardware devices and semiconductor chips while outsourcing their fabrication (or &quot;fab&quot;) to a specialized manufacturer called a semiconductor foundry. These foundries are typically, but not exclusively, located in the United States, mainland China, and Taiwan. Fabless companies can benefit from lower capital costs while concentrating their research and development resources on the end market. Some fabless companies and pure play foundries (like TSMC) may offer integrated-circuit design services to third parties.

== History ==
Prior to the 1980s, the semiconductor industry was vertically integrated. Semiconductor companies owned and operated their own silicon-wafer fabrication facilities and developed their own process technology for manufacturing their chips. These companies also carried out the assembly and testing of their own chips.

As with most technology-intensive industries, the silicon manufacturing process presents high barriers to entry into the market, especially for small start-up companies. But integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) had excess production capacity. This presented an opportunity for smaller companies, relying on IDMs, to design but not manufacture silicon.

These conditions underlay the birth of the fabless business model. Engineers at new companies began designing and selling integrated circuits (ICs) without owning a fabrication plant. Simultaneously, the foundry industry was established by Dr. Morris Chang with the founding of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). Foundries became the cornerstone of the fabless model, providing a non-competitive manufacturing partner for fabless companies.

The co-founders of the first fabless semiconductor company, LSI Computer Systems, Inc. (LSI/CSI) LSI/CSI, worked together at General Instrument Microelectronics (GIM) in the 1960s. In 1969 GIM was hired to develop three full custom CPU circuits for Control Data Corporation (CDC). These CPU ICs operated at 5 MHz (state of the art at the time) and were incorporated in the CDC Computer 469. The Computer 469 became a standard CDC Aerospace Computer and was used in the Spy in the Sky Satellites in addition to other classified satellite programs.

GIM was reluctant to proceed with the next phase of the program, which it deemed to be too technically challenging. The GIM engineers who had worked on the project were encouraged by CDC to form their own company to provide five new custom circuits. This resulted in the formation of LSI Computer Systems, Inc. (LSI/CSI) in 1969. The new chips were power-efficient random logic circuits with extremely high circuit densities. These new circuits also operated at 5 MHz. These devices were designated LSI0101, LSI0102, LSI0103, LSI0104, and LSI0105 and were manufactured in compact 40-pin metal flat packs with spacing.

In creating the fabless semiconductor industry, LSI/CSI had to do the following:
# Select a suitable and CDC certifiable wafer fab house.
# Monitor the process, and inspection of all wafers per Class S requirements and visuals.
# Perform all In-Process inspections of the wafers.
# Select a highly reliable packaging house capable of meeting CDC&#x27;s Class S assembly requirements.
# Have CDC certify and approve the assembly facility and its processes.
# LSI/CSI successfully performed all required environmental testing at Class S approved facilities.
# LSI/CSI prepared and submitted all environmental test reports.

CDC&#x27;s Aerospace Computer 469 weighed one pound, consumed a total of 10 watts and ran at 5 MHz. CDC ran a parallel program, developing a chipset of eight similar parts that were to operate at 2.5 MHz with the identical environmental and Class S requirements. CDC had initial difficulties with this project, but eventually awarded another contract to LSI/CSI to manage the processing, inspection, visuals, assembly, and testing of the ICs. These parts were given the designation LSI3201, LSI3202, LSI3203, LSI3204 and LSI3205. Another successful space program completed by LSI/CSI was the upgrade to class S of a Standard Brushless DC Motor Commutator/Controller Chip, LS7262, which was implemented in satellites.

In 1994, Jodi Shelton, along with a half a dozen CEOs of fabless companies, established the Fabless Semiconductor Association (FSA) to promote the fabless business-model globally. In December 2007, the FSA transitioned to the GSA, the Global Semiconductor Alliance. The organizational transition reflected the role FSA had played as a global organization that collaborated with other organizations to co-host international events.

== Industry growth and success ==
The fabless manufacturing model has been further validated by the conversion of major IDMs to a completely fabless model, including (for example) Conexant Systems, Semtech, and most recently, LSI Logic. Today most major IDMs including Apple Inc., Infineon and Cypress Semiconductor have adopted the practice of outsourcing chip manufacturing as a significant manufacturing strategy.

<text>Dyfnwal Moelmud (Welsh for &quot;Dyfnwal the Bald and Silent&quot;; ; ) was accounted as an early king and lawmaker among the Welsh, credited with the codification of their standard units of measure. He also figures as a legendary king of the Britons in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;History of the Kings of the Britons&quot;.
==History==
Only two known historical documents mention Dyfnwal. A tenth-century genealogy in the British Library (Harley MS 3859) identifies him as the grandson of Coel Hen, and ancestor of Morcant Bulc. A fifteenth-century genealogy in Jesus College, Oxford (MS 20) also identifies him in the same way.

==Legend==
In Geoffrey&#x27;s account, Dyfnwal was the son of Cloten, the King of Cornwall, and he restored order after the &quot;Civil War of the Five Kings&quot;. His family was a cadet branch of the dynasty of Brutus, the dominant line having ended with Porrex I before the civil war. The &quot;Book of Baglan&quot; expands on this by making Dyfnwal descend directly through the male line of Camber via his eldest son, Gorbonian.

Dyfnwal was the King of Cornwall during the war created in the power vacuum left by Porrex I. He was braver and more courageous than all the other kings in the war. He defeated Pinner, the king of Loegria. In response, Rudaucus, king of Cambria, and Staterius, king of Albany, allied together and destroyed much of Dyfnwal&#x27;s land. The two sides met in battle and were stalemated. Dyfnwal then took 600 of his men and himself and dressed themselves in the armour of the dead enemies. They led a charge deep into enemy lines where they killed the two kings. After this battle, Dyfnwal destroyed the remaining defences of the kings and pillaged their lands.

Following the defeat of the rival kings, Dyfnwal created a crown like that of his predecessors and claimed the throne of Britain. He created a set of rules for the kingdom called the Molmutine Laws, which nearly ended robbery within his kingdom and lasted for many centuries. The &quot;Book of Baglan&quot; also makes him the founder of Bristol. He reigned in peace and prosperity for forty years then died and was buried in the Temple of Concord, a tribute to his laws, which resided in Trinovantum. His death sparked another civil war between his two sons, Belinus and Brennius.

<doc id="675699" wikidata="Q1143237" url="?curid=675699" title="Octree">
<text>An octree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly eight children. Octrees are most often used to partition a three-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into eight octants. Octrees are the three-dimensional analog of quadtrees. The word is derived from &quot;oct&quot; (Greek root meaning &quot;eight&quot;) + &quot;tree&quot;. Octrees are often used in 3D graphics and 3D game engines.

==For spatial representation==
Each node in an octree subdivides the space it represents into eight octants. In a point region (PR) octree, the node stores an explicit three-dimensional point, which is the &quot;center&quot; of the subdivision for that node; the point defines one of the corners for each of the eight children. In a matrix-based (MX) octree, the subdivision point is implicitly the center of the space the node represents. The root node of a PR octree can represent infinite space; the root node of an MX octree must represent a finite bounded space so that the implicit centers are well-defined. Note that octrees are not the same as &quot;k&quot;-d trees: &quot;k&quot;-d trees split along a dimension and octrees split around a point. Also &quot;k&quot;-d trees are always binary, which is not the case for octrees.
By using a depth-first search the nodes are to be traversed and only required surfaces are to be viewed.

==History==
The use of octrees for 3D computer graphics was pioneered by Donald Meagher at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, described in a 1980 report &quot;Octree Encoding: A New Technique for the Representation, Manipulation and Display of Arbitrary 3-D Objects by Computer&quot;, for which he holds a 1995 patent (with a 1984 priority date) &quot;High-speed image generation of complex solid objects using octree encoding&quot; 

==Common uses==
* Level of detail rendering in 3D computer graphics
* Spatial indexing
* Nearest neighbor search
* Efficient collision detection in three dimensions
* View frustum culling
* Fast multipole method
* Unstructured grid
* Finite element analysis
* Sparse voxel octree
* State estimation
* Set estimation

==Application to color quantization==

The octree color quantization algorithm, invented by Gervautz and Purgathofer in 1988, encodes image color data as an octree up to nine levels deep. Octrees are used because formula_1 and there are three color components in the RGB system. The node index to branch out from at the top level is determined by a formula that uses the most significant bits of the red, green, and blue color components, e.g. 4r + 2g + b. The next lower level uses the next bit significance, and so on. Less significant bits are sometimes ignored to reduce the tree size.

The algorithm is highly memory efficient because the tree&#x27;s size can be limited. The bottom level of the octree consists of leaf nodes that accrue color data not represented in the tree; these nodes initially contain single bits. If much more than the desired number of palette colors are entered into the octree, its size can be continually reduced by seeking out a bottom-level node and averaging its bit data up into a leaf node, pruning part of the tree. Once sampling is complete, exploring all routes in the tree down to the leaf nodes, taking note of the bits along the way, will yield approximately the required number of colors.

==Implementation for point decomposition==
The example recursive algorithm outline below (MATLAB syntax) decomposes an array of 3-dimensional points into octree style bins. The implementation begins with a single bin surrounding all given points, which then recursively subdivides into its 8 octree regions. Recursion is stopped when a given exit condition is met. Examples of such exit conditions (shown in code below) are:
* When a bin contains fewer than a given number of points
* When a bin reaches a minimum size or volume based on the length of its edges
* When recursion has reached a maximum number of subdivisions

function [binDepths, binParents, binCorners, pointBins] = OcTree(points)

binDepths = [0] % Initialize an array of bin depths with this single base-level bin
binParents = [0] % This base level bin is not a child of other bins
binCorners = [min(points) max(points)] % It surrounds all points in XYZ space
pointBins(:) = 1 % Initially, all points are assigned to this first bin
divide(1) % Begin dividing this first bin

function divide(binNo)

% If this bin meets any exit conditions, do not divide it any further.
binPointCount = nnz(pointBins == binNo)
binEdgeLengths = binCorners(binNo, 1:3) - binCorners(binNo, 4:6)
binDepth = binDepths(binNo)
exitConditionsMet = binPointCount&lt;value || min(binEdgeLengths) &lt; value || binDepth &gt; value
if exitConditionsMet
 return; % Exit recursive function
end

% Otherwise, split this bin into 8 new sub-bins with a new division point
newDiv = (binCorners(binNo, 1:3) + binCorners(binNo, 4:6)) / 2
for i = 1:8
 newBinNo = length(binDepths) + 1
 binDepths(newBinNo) = binDepths(binNo) + 1
 binParents(newBinNo) = binNo
 binCorners(newBinNo) = [one of the 8 pairs of the newDiv with minCorner or maxCorner]
 oldBinMask = pointBins == binNo
 % Calculate which points in pointBins == binNo now belong in newBinNo
 pointBins(newBinMask) = newBinNo
 % Recursively divide this newly created bin
 divide(newBinNo)
end
==Example color quantization==
Taking the full list of colors of a 24-bit RGB image as point input to the Octree point decomposition implementation outlined above, the following example show the results of octree color quantization. The first image is the original (532818 distinct colors), while the second is the quantized image (184 distinct colors) using octree decomposition, with each pixel assigned the color at the center of the octree bin in which it falls. Alternatively, final colors could be chosen at the centroid of all colors in each octree bin, however this added computation has very little effect on the visual result.

% Read the original RGB image
Img = imread(&#x27;IMG_9980.CR2&#x27;);
% Extract pixels as RGB point triplets
pts = reshape(Img, [], 3);
% Create OcTree decomposition object using a target bin capacity
OT = OcTree(pts, &#x27;BinCapacity&#x27;, ceil((size(pts, 1) / 256) * 7));
% Find which bins are &quot;leaf nodes&quot; on the octree object
leafs = find(~ismember(1:OT.BinCount, OT.BinParents) &amp; ...
 ismember(1:OT.BinCount, OT.PointBins));
% Find the central RGB location of each leaf bin
binCents = mean(reshape(OT.BinBoundaries(leafs,:), [], 3, 2), 3);
% Make a new &quot;indexed&quot; image with a color map
ImgIdx = zeros(size(Img, 1), size(Img, 2));
for i = 1:length(leafs)
 pxNos = find(OT.PointBins==leafs(i));
 ImgIdx(pxNos) = i;
end
ImgMap = binCents / 255; % Convert 8-bit color to MATLAB rgb values
% Display the original 532818-color image and resulting 184-color image 
figure
subplot(1, 2, 1), imshow(Img)
title(sprintf(&#x27;Original %d color image&#x27;, size(unique(pts,&#x27;rows&#x27;), 1)))
subplot(1, 2, 2), imshow(ImgIdx, ImgMap)
title(sprintf(&#x27;Octree-quantized %d color image&#x27;, size(ImgMap, 1)))

<text>The Molmutine Laws were the laws said to have been instituted over the Britons by Dyfnwal Moelmud, who is also referred by the Latin form of his name, Dunvallo Molmutius (from which the Molmutine Laws take their title). The Laws were most famously described by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his Historia Regum Britanniae. Little remains known of these laws, with surviving Welsh codes simply noting that Dyfnwal&#x27;s laws were largely superseded by the new codes instituted by Hywel Da. Hywel was said, however, to have retained Dyfnwal&#x27;s units of measurement.
==Legendary accounts==
===History of the Kings of Britain===
Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s pseudohistorical &quot;History of the Kings of Britain&quot; describes Dyfnwal as its &quot;Dunvallo Molmutius&quot;. In his account, one of the Molmutine Laws declared that the temples of the gods and cities should act as sanctuaries from death. Furthermore, anyone who fled to a temple for being accused of a crime must be pardoned by the accuser upon departure from the temple. This law soon included all roads leading to temples and all farmers were declared safe from such crimes. Geoffrey credited the British Trojans as the original source of many of Dyfnwal&#x27;s laws, including one allowing the reign of queens.

===Welsh triads===
The Molmutine Laws are among the texts said to have been &quot;discovered&quot; by the forger Iolo Morganwg around the year 1800. They are given in the form of triads and include:
* There are three tests of civil liberty: equality of rights, equality of taxation, freedom to come and go.
* Three things are indispensable to a true union of nations: sameness of laws, rights, and language.
* There are three things free to all Britons: the forest, the unworked mine, the right of hunting. 
* There are three property birthrights of every Briton: five British acres of land for a home, the right of suffrage in the enacting of the laws, the male at twenty-one, the female on her marriage.
* There are three things which every Briton may legally be compelled to attend: the worship of God, military service, the courts of law.
* There are three things free to every man, Briton or foreigner, the refusal of which no law will justify: water from spring, river, or well; firing from a decayed tree; a block of stone not in use.
* There are three classes which are exempt from bearing arms: bards, judges, graduates in law or religion. These represent God and His peace, and no weapon must ever be found in their hands.
* There are three persons who have a right of public maintenance: the old, the babe, the foreigner who can not speak the British tongue.
* There are three things free to a country and its borders: the roads, the rivers, and the places of worship. These are under the protection of God and His peace.

<doc id="675716" wikidata="Q23349" url="?curid=675716" title="2Pacalypse Now">
<text>2Pacalypse Now is the debut solo studio album by American rapper 2Pac. It was released on November 12, 1991, through TNT Recordings and Interscope Records, while EastWest Records America, a division of Atlantic distributed the album. The recording sessions took place at Starlight Sound Studio in Richmond, California. The album was produced by the Digital Underground production team the Underground Railroad, made up of Big D the Impossible, Shock G, Pee-Wee, DJ J-Z, Raw Fusion, and Live Squad. It features contributions from Stretch, Angelique, Dave Hollister, Pogo, Poppi, Ray Luv and Shock G among others. The album&#x27;s title is a reference to the 1979 war film &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.

In the United States, the album reached number 64 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 13 on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 3 on both the Heatseekers Albums and Catalog Albums charts. On April 19, 1995, it was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling 500,000 copies. In commemoration of its twenty-fifth anniversary, it was re-released on vinyl and cassette on November 11, 2016, which peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Vinyl Albums chart.

The album produced three singles with accompanying music videos: &quot;Trapped&quot;, &quot;Brenda&#x27;s Got a Baby&quot; and &quot;If My Homie Calls&quot;. The second single off of the album, &quot;Brenda&#x27;s Got a Baby&quot;, made it to No. 23 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs, number 3 on the Hot Rap Songs and number 55 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles Sales. The song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; from the album was included in 2004 video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; in-game radio station &quot;Radio Los Santos&quot;.

==Content==
&quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; is a socially conscious hip hop album. It serves as the artist&#x27;s commentary on contemporary social issues facing American society, such as racism, police brutality, poverty, gang violence. teenage pregnancy and drug abuse. The album poetically addresses black urban concerns relevant to the present day. Although a relatively tame album compared to Shakur&#x27;s later works, &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; was known for its violent lyrics aimed at police officers and the government in the songs &quot;Trapped&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Give a Fuck&quot; and &quot;Soulja&#x27;s Story&quot;.

==Controversy==
The album generated significant controversy stemming from then-U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle&#x27;s public criticism after Ronald Ray Howard murdered a Texas Highway Patrol trooper and his defense attorney claimed he was influenced by &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; and its strong theme of police brutality. Quayle made the statement, &quot;There&#x27;s no reason for a record like this to be published. It has no place in our society&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Although the album&#x27;s political messages, lyrics and his storytelling were praised, Tupac Shakur&#x27;s debut album was criticized for its production. In a retrospective review, &quot;RapReviews&quot; gave the album 4 stars out of 5 and said: &quot;It&#x27;s not an extraordinarily long album, but it is a dense and heavy listen that will take a lot out of you if you pay close attention to the persistent theme. The beats overall fail to make much of an impression, but perhaps that is as it should be, since nothing should be allowed to outshine this kind of lyrical performance. Tupac&#x27;s vitriol is carried by his sincerity and charisma, both of which would emerge as key traits of the figure that blossomed in the years to come. Over the course of Tupac&#x27;s career, the political got suffused by the personal and receded from the central position it occupied on his debut.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
Upon its release, &quot;2Pacalypse Now&quot; debuted at number 197 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number 77 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 31 on the Heatseekers Albums charts in the United States. The album peaked at No. 64, No. 13 and No. 3 on the respective charts in the first third of 1992. The Recording Industry Association of America certified the album gold on April 19, 1995 for passing the sales mark of half a million copies.

After 2Pac&#x27;s death in 1996, the album made it to the US Catalog Albums, peaking at number 3. It also made its charting debut on the UK Hip Hop and R&amp;B Albums Chart, reaching number 35.

<text>As Nasty as They Wanna Be is the third album by Miami bass group 2 Live Crew. It was released on February 7, 1989, and became the group&#x27;s largest seller, being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1990, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled that the album was legally obscene; this ruling was later overturned by the Eleventh Circuit. It is the first album in history to be deemed legally obscene.

It would also be the final album to be released under the Skyywalker Records label. Following a successful lawsuit against Luther Campbell and Skyywalker Records by &quot;Star Wars&quot; creator and director George Lucas, the company was forced to change its name to Luke Records.

The album is broken down track-by-track by Luke and Mr. Mixx in Brian Coleman&#x27;s book &quot;Check the Technique&quot;.

In 2010, the album cover and imagery of the record were used in the music video of the song &quot;The Rabbit&quot; by Swedish band Miike Snow.

== Obscenity trial ==

Shortly after the album was released, federal district judge Jose Gonzalez ruled that it was obscene and that stores and merchants in the several counties that fell under his jurisdiction could face charges if they made the album available for sale. Subsequently, on June 9, 1990, three band members were arrested by then-Sheriff Nick Navarro when they performed some tracks at a strip club in Broward County, Florida. In the &quot;media circus&quot; attendant on these events, only the Washington &quot;City Paper&quot;, Tipper Gore&#x27;s Parents Music Resource Center and &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine published the offending lyrics. Christopher Hitchens, in a column on the last of these, citing the admonition on the cover of the album—&quot;If you don&#x27;t like the record, you can kiss our mother fuckin&#x27; ass&quot;—commented,

Precisely. It&#x27;s obvious to this reviewer that the Crew should be left alone, and that their foulmouthed attitude toward the gentler sex is a good-sounding excuse for a youth-hating and surreptitiously bigoted prosecution. I don&#x27;t know the private thoughts of Sheriff Nick Navarro of Broward County, but I doubt they are worth a rat&#x27;s behind and see no reason why he should sublimate his own vagina-dreading disorders in this expensive and undemocratic fashion. The same applies to the preposterous Judge Jose Gonzalez Jr., who in ruling on Sheriff Navarro&#x27;s raid opined that the music appeals to &quot;the loins, not to the intellect.&quot; In fact, I think they are a pair of racist shitheads who should be told to fuck right off.

During the 1990 Sound+Vision Tour in Philadelphia, David Bowie stopped his performance in the middle of the song &quot;Young Americans&quot; to speak out against music censorship, specifically due to the controversy over 2 Live Crew&#x27;s album &quot;As Nasty as They Wanna Be&quot;, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve been listening to the album by 2 Live Crew. It&#x27;s not the best album that&#x27;s ever been made, but when I heard they banned it, I went out and bought it. Freedom of thought, freedom of speech – it&#x27;s one of the most important things we have.&quot;

An obscenity trial followed, in which Henry Louis Gates, Jr., addressed the court on behalf of the defendants, all of whom were eventually acquitted.

==&quot;As Clean as They Wanna Be&quot;==


As Clean as They Wanna Be is the clean version of 2 Live Crew&#x27;s third album. The album contains a disclaimer that &quot;This album does not contain explicit lyrics&quot;. The album had notably worse sales than the explicit version. However, it does contain &quot;Pretty Woman&quot;, which is not on the explicit version. The song – a parody of the Roy Orbison hit &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot; – resulted in a Supreme Court case, &quot;Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.&quot;, which established that a commercial parody can qualify as fair use. Despite the sticker on the album cover claiming &quot;This album does not contain explicit lyrics&quot;, the song &quot;Break It on Down&quot; appears in its original, explicit form. Additionally, the song &quot;City of Boom&quot; (which is exclusive to the clean version) contains several explicit lyrics.

<text>USS &quot;Benham&quot; (DD-397) was the lead ship of her class of destroyers and the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for Andrew Ellicot Kennedy Benham. She missed the Attack on Pearl Harbor, being an escort for the aircraft carrier on her way to Midway Atoll at the time. She also served off Hawaii during the Doolittle raid, rescued survivors from several ships, and operated during the Battle of Midway and the landings on Guadalcanal, among other missions. She was torpedoed by the Japanese destroyer Uranami and rendered unusable, for which she was sunk at the end of 1942.

==Construction==
&quot;Benham&quot; was laid down on 1 September 1936 by Federal Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company at their yard in Kearny, New Jersey. The destroyer was launched on 16 April 1938 and sponsored by Mrs. A. I. Dorr, grandniece of Rear Admiral Benham. &quot;Benham&quot; was commissioned on 2 February 1939 with Lieutenant Commander T. F. Darden in command.

==Service history==
Assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Benham&quot; patrolled off Newfoundland during most of 1939 and then shifted to the Gulf of Mexico. Ordered to the Pacific, she arrived at Pearl Harbor 14 April 1940. After alternating between Californian and Hawaiian waters, the destroyer served as an escort for during the delivery of Marine planes to Midway Atoll on 28 November to 8 December 1941, thus missing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. &quot;Benham&quot; served with &quot;Enterprise&quot; and task forces off Hawaii and with Task Force 16 during the Doolittle raid on Tokyo, 8 to 25 April 1942. She continued operating with TF 16 through the Battle of Midway, 3 to 6 June, during which she rescued 720 survivors from the aircraft carrier and 188 from the destroyer ; landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi, 7 to 9 August, and the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, 23 to 25 August.

=== Battle of Guadalcanal ===
&quot;Benham&quot; joined Task Force 64 on 15 October as a part of the naval covering force off Guadalcanal. On 15 November, she took part in the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, and alongside the US destroyers Preston, Walke, and Gwin were attacked by the Japanese light cruiser Nagara and the destroyers Ayanami and Uranami. Instantly, &quot;Walke&quot; was hit once by a six torpedo spread fired from &quot;Ayanami,&quot; blowing off &quot;Walke&#x27;s&quot; bow as she sank stern last. &quot;Preston&quot; then exploded following gunfire damage from &quot;Nagara,&quot; before gunfire damage from both &quot;Ayanami&quot; and &quot;Uranami&quot; disabled &quot;Gwin&quot; (though she survived the battle and was later sunk by a mass torpedo spread at the battle of Kolombangara, July 1943).

&quot;Benham&quot; was then hit by a single torpedo, probably from &quot;Uranami&quot;, to her bow which severed everything forward of her bridge. &quot;Benham&quot; stayed afloat, making slow headway towards Guadalcanal during the 15th but, by 16:37, further progress was impossible and her crew abandoned ship. picked up the survivors, and scuttled the hulk at 19:38 by shell-fire.

==Honors==
&quot;Benham&quot; received five battle stars for her service in World War II.

<text>Weather radar, also called weather surveillance radar (WSR) and Doppler weather radar, is a type of radar used to locate precipitation, calculate its motion, and estimate its type (rain, snow, hail etc.). Modern weather radars are mostly pulse-Doppler radars, capable of detecting the motion of rain droplets in addition to the intensity of the precipitation. Both types of data can be analyzed to determine the structure of storms and their potential to cause severe weather.

During World War II, radar operators discovered that weather was causing echoes on their screens, masking potential enemy targets. Techniques were developed to filter them, but scientists began to study the phenomenon. Soon after the war, surplus radars were used to detect precipitation. Since then, weather radar has evolved and is used by national weather services, research departments in universities, and in television stations&#x27; weather departments. Raw images are routinely processed by specialized software to make short term forecasts of future positions and intensities of rain, snow, hail, and other weather phenomena. Radar output is even incorporated into numerical weather prediction models to improve analyses and forecasts.

==History==

During World War II, military radar operators noticed noise in returned echoes due to rain, snow, and sleet. After the war, military scientists returned to civilian life or continued in the Armed Forces and pursued their work in developing a use for those echoes. In the United States, David Atlas at first working for the Air Force and later for MIT, developed the first operational weather radars. In Canada, J.S. Marshall and R.H. Douglas formed the &quot;Stormy Weather Group&quot; in Montreal. Marshall and his doctoral student Walter Palmer are well known for their work on the drop size distribution in mid-latitude rain that led to understanding of the Z-R relation, which correlates a given radar reflectivity with the rate at which rainwater is falling. In the United Kingdom, research continued to study the radar echo patterns and weather elements such as stratiform rain and convective clouds, and experiments were done to evaluate the potential of different wavelengths from 1 to 10 centimeters. By 1950 the UK company EKCO was demonstrating its airborne &#x27;cloud and collision warning search radar equipment&#x27;.

Between 1950 and 1980, reflectivity radars, which measure the position and intensity of precipitation, were incorporated by weather services around the world. The early meteorologists had to watch a cathode-ray tube. In 1953 Donald Staggs, an electrical engineer working for the Illinois State Water Survey, made the first recorded radar observation of a &quot;hook echo&quot; associated with a tornadic thunderstorm.

The first use of weather radar on television in the United States was in September 1961. As Hurricane Carla was approaching the state of Texas, local reporter Dan Rather, suspecting the hurricane was very large, took a trip to the U.S. Weather Bureau WSR-57 radar site in Galveston in order to get an idea of the size of the storm. He convinced the bureau staff to let him broadcast live from their office and asked a meteorologist to draw him a rough outline of the Gulf of Mexico on a transparent sheet of plastic. During the broadcast, he held that transparent overlay over the computer&#x27;s black-and-white radar display to give his audience a sense both of Carla&#x27;s size and of the location of the storm&#x27;s eye. This made Rather a national name and his report helped in the alerted population accepting the evacuation of an estimated 350,000 people by the authorities, which was the largest evacuation in US history at that time. Just 46 people were killed thanks to the warning and it was estimated that the evacuation saved several thousand lives, as the smaller 1900 Galveston hurricane had killed an estimated 6000-12000 people.

During the 1970s, radars began to be standardized and organized into networks. The first devices to capture radar images were developed. The number of scanned angles was increased to get a three-dimensional view of the precipitation, so that horizontal cross-sections (CAPPI) and vertical cross-sections could be performed. Studies of the organization of thunderstorms were then possible for the Alberta Hail Project in Canada and National Severe Storms Laboratory (NSSL) in the US in particular.

The NSSL, created in 1964, began experimentation on dual polarization signals and on Doppler effect uses. In May 1973, a tornado devastated Union City, Oklahoma, just west of Oklahoma City. For the first time, a Dopplerized 10 cm wavelength radar from NSSL documented the entire life cycle of the tornado. The researchers discovered a mesoscale rotation in the cloud aloft before the tornado touched the ground – the tornadic vortex signature. NSSL&#x27;s research helped convince the National Weather Service that Doppler radar was a crucial forecasting tool. The Super Outbreak of tornadoes on 3–4 April 1974 and their devastating destruction might have helped to get funding for further developments.
Between 1980 and 2000, weather radar networks became the norm in North America, Europe, Japan and other developed countries. Conventional radars were replaced by Doppler radars, which in addition to position and intensity could track the relative velocity of the particles in the air. In the United States, the construction of a network consisting of 10 cm radars, called NEXRAD or WSR-88D (Weather Surveillance Radar 1988 Doppler), was started in 1988 following NSSL&#x27;s research. In Canada, Environment Canada constructed the King City station, with a 5 cm research Doppler radar, by 1985; McGill University dopplerized its radar (J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory) in 1993. This led to a complete Canadian Doppler network between 1998 and 2004. France and other European countries had switched to Doppler networks by the early 2000s. Meanwhile, rapid advances in computer technology led to algorithms to detect signs of severe weather, and many applications for media outlets and researchers.

After 2000, research on dual polarization technology moved into operational use, increasing the amount of information available on precipitation type (e.g. rain vs. snow). &quot;Dual polarization&quot; means that microwave radiation which is polarized both horizontally and vertically (with respect to the ground) is emitted. Wide-scale deployment was done by the end of the decade or the beginning of the next in some countries such as the United States, France, and Canada. In April 2013, all United States National Weather Service NEXRADs were completely dual-polarized.

Since 2003, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been experimenting with phased-array radar as a replacement for conventional parabolic antenna to provide more time resolution in atmospheric sounding. This could be significant with severe thunderstorms, as their evolution can be better evaluated with more timely data.

Also in 2003, the National Science Foundation established the Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA), a multidisciplinary, multi-university collaboration of engineers, computer scientists, meteorologists, and sociologists to conduct fundamental research, develop enabling technology, and deploy prototype engineering systems designed to augment existing radar systems by sampling the generally undersampled lower troposphere with inexpensive, fast scanning, dual polarization, mechanically scanned and phased array radars.

In 2023, the private American company Tomorrow.io launched a Ka-band space-based radar for weather observation and forecasting.

==Principle==

===Sending radar pulses===

Weather radars send directional pulses of microwave radiation, on the order of one microsecond long, using a cavity magnetron or klystron tube connected by a waveguide to a parabolic antenna. The wavelengths of 1 – 10 cm are approximately ten times the diameter of the droplets or ice particles of interest, because Rayleigh scattering occurs at these frequencies. This means that part of the energy of each pulse will bounce off these small particles, back towards the radar station.

Shorter wavelengths are useful for smaller particles, but the signal is more quickly attenuated. Thus 10 cm (S-band) radar is preferred but is more expensive than a 5 cm C-band system. 3 cm X-band radar is used only for short-range units, and 1 cm Ka-band weather radar is used only for research on small-particle phenomena such as drizzle and fog. W band (3 mm) weather radar systems have seen limited university use, but due to quicker attenuation, most data are not operational.

Radar pulses diverge as they move away from the radar station. Thus the volume of air that a radar pulse is traversing is larger for areas farther away from the station, and smaller for nearby areas, decreasing resolution at farther distances. At the end of a 150 – 200 km sounding range, the volume of air scanned by a single pulse might be on the order of a cubic kilometer. This is called the &quot;pulse volume&quot;.

The volume of air that a given pulse takes up at any point in time may be approximated by the formula formula_1, where v is the volume enclosed by the pulse, h is pulse width (in e.g. meters, calculated from the duration in seconds of the pulse times the speed of light), r is the distance from the radar that the pulse has already traveled (in e.g. meters), and formula_2 is the beam width (in radians). This formula assumes the beam is symmetrically circular, &quot;r&quot; is much greater than &quot;h&quot; so &quot;r&quot; taken at the beginning or at the end of the pulse is almost the same, and the shape of the volume is a cone frustum of depth &quot;h&quot;.

===Listening for return signals===
Between each pulse, the radar station serves as a receiver as it listens for return signals from particles in the air. The duration of the &quot;listen&quot; cycle is on the order of a millisecond, which is a thousand times longer than the pulse duration. The length of this phase is determined by the need for the microwave radiation (which travels at the speed of light) to propagate from the detector to the weather target and back again, a distance which could be several hundred kilometers. The horizontal distance from station to target is calculated simply from the amount of time that elapses from the initiation of the pulse to the detection of the return signal. The time is converted into distance by multiplying by the speed of light in air:
:formula_3
where &quot;c&quot; = km/s is the speed of light, and &quot;n&quot; ≈ is the refractive index of air.

If pulses are emitted too frequently, the returns from one pulse will be confused with the returns from previous pulses, resulting in incorrect distance calculations.

===Determining height===

Since the Earth is round, the radar beam in vacuum would rise according to the reverse curvature of the Earth. However, the atmosphere has a refractive index that diminishes with height, due to its diminishing density. This bends the radar beam slightly toward the ground and with a standard atmosphere this is equivalent to considering that the curvature of the beam is 4/3 the actual curvature of the Earth. Depending on the elevation angle of the antenna and other considerations, the following formula may be used to calculate the target&#x27;s height above ground:
:formula_4
where:
:&quot;r&quot; = distance radar–target,
:&quot;k&quot;e = 4/3,
:&quot;a&quot;e = Earth radius,
:&quot;θ&quot;e = elevation angle above the radar horizon,
:&quot;h&quot;a = height of the feedhorn above ground.

===Effective volume coverage===

A weather radar network uses a series of typical angles that are set according to its needs. After each scanning rotation, the antenna elevation is changed for the next sounding. This scenario will be repeated on many angles to scan the entire volume of air around the radar within the maximum range. Usually, the scanning strategy is completed within 5 to 10 minutes to have data within 15 km above ground and 250 km distance of the radar. For instance in Canada, the 5 cm weather radars use angles ranging from 0.3 to 25 degrees. The accompanying image shows the volume scanned when multiple angles are used.

Due to the Earth&#x27;s curvature and change of index of refraction with height, the radar cannot &quot;see&quot; below the height above ground of the minimal angle (shown in green) or closer to the radar than the maximal one (shown as a red cone in the center).

===Calibrating return intensity===
Because the targets are not unique in each volume, the radar equation has to be developed beyond the basic one. Assuming a monostatic radar where formula_5:

:formula_6
where formula_7 is received power, formula_8 is transmitted power, formula_9 is the gain of the transmitting/receiving antenna, formula_10 is radar wavelength, formula_11 is the radar cross section of the target and formula_12 is the distance from transmitter to target.

In this case, the cross sections of all the targets must be summed:
:formula_13
::formula_14

where formula_15 is the light speed, formula_16 is temporal duration of a pulse and formula_2 is the beam width in radians.

In combining the two equations:

:formula_18

Which leads to:

:formula_19

The return varies inversely to formula_20 instead of formula_21. In order to compare the data coming from different distances from the radar, one has to normalize them with this ratio.

==Data types==

===Reflectivity===
Return echoes from targets (&quot;reflectivity&quot;) are analyzed for their intensities to establish the precipitation rate in the scanned volume. The wavelengths used (1–10 cm) ensure that this return is proportional to the rate because they are within the validity of Rayleigh scattering which states that the targets must be much smaller than the wavelength of the scanning wave (by a factor of 10).

Reflectivity perceived by the radar (Ze) varies by the sixth power of the rain droplets&#x27; diameter (D), the square of the dielectric constant (K) of the targets and the drop size distribution (e.g. N[D] of &quot;Marshall-Palmer&quot;) of the drops. This gives a truncated Gamma function,
 of the form:

:formula_22

Precipitation rate (R), on the other hand, is equal to the number of particles, their volume and their fall speed (v[D]) as:

:formula_23

So Ze and R have similar functions that can be resolved by giving a relation between the two of the form called &quot;Z-R relation&quot;:

: Z = aRb 

Where a and b depend on the type of precipitation (snow, rain, convective or stratiform), which has different formula_24, K, N0 and v.

*As the antenna scans the atmosphere, on every angle of azimuth it obtains a certain strength of return from each type of target encountered. Reflectivity is then averaged for that target to have a better data set.
*Since variation in diameter and dielectric constant of the targets can lead to large variability in power return to the radar, reflectivity is expressed in dBZ (10 times the logarithm of the ratio of the echo to a standard 1 mm diameter drop filling the same scanned volume).

====How to read reflectivity on a radar display====

Radar returns are usually described by colour or level. The colours in a radar image normally range from blue or green for weak returns, to red or magenta for very strong returns. The numbers in a verbal report increase with the severity of the returns. For example, the U.S. National NEXRAD radar sites use the following scale for different levels of reflectivity:

*magenta: 65 dBZ (extremely heavy precipitation, &gt; {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} per hour, but likely hail)
*red: 50 dBZ (heavy precipitation of {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} per hour)
*yellow: 35 dBZ (moderate precipitation of {{convert|0.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} per hour)
*green: 20 dBZ (light precipitation)

Strong returns (red or magenta) may indicate not only heavy rain but also thunderstorms, hail, strong winds, or tornadoes, but they need to be interpreted carefully, for reasons described below.

=====Aviation conventions=====
When describing weather radar returns, pilots, dispatchers, and air traffic controllers will typically refer to three return levels:

*level 1 corresponds to a green radar return, indicating usually light precipitation and little to no turbulence, leading to a possibility of reduced visibility.
*level 2 corresponds to a yellow radar return, indicating moderate precipitation, leading to the possibility of very low visibility, moderate turbulence and an uncomfortable ride for aircraft passengers.
*level 3 corresponds to a red radar return, indicating heavy precipitation, leading to the possibility of thunderstorms and severe turbulence and structural damage to the aircraft.

Aircraft will try to avoid level 2 returns when possible, and will always avoid level 3 unless they are specially-designed research aircraft.

=====Precipitation types=====
Some displays provided by commercial television outlets (both local and national) and weather websites, like The Weather Channel and AccuWeather, show precipitation types during the winter months: rain, snow, mixed precipitations (sleet and freezing rain). This is not an analysis of the radar data itself but a post-treatment done with other data sources, the primary being surface reports (METAR).

Over the area covered by radar echoes, a program assigns a precipitation type according to the surface temperature and dew point reported at the underlying weather stations. Precipitation types reported by human operated stations and certain automatic ones (AWOS) will have higher weight. Then the program does interpolations to produce an image with defined zones. These will include interpolation errors due to the calculation. Mesoscale variations of the precipitation zones will also be lost. More sophisticated programs use the numerical weather prediction output from models, such as NAM and WRF, for the precipitation types and apply it as a first guess to the radar echoes, then use the surface data for final output.

Until dual-polarization (section Polarization below) data are widely available, any precipitation types on radar images are only indirect information and must be taken with care.

===Velocity===

{{See also|Pulse-Doppler radar|Doppler radar}}
Precipitation is found in and below clouds. Light precipitation such as drops and flakes is subject to the air currents, and scanning radar can pick up the horizontal component of this motion, thus giving the possibility to estimate the wind speed and direction where precipitation is present.

A target&#x27;s motion relative to the radar station causes a change in the reflected frequency of the radar pulse, due to the Doppler effect. With velocities of less than 70-metre/second for weather echos and radar wavelength of 10 cm, this amounts to a change only 0.1 ppm. This difference is too small to be noted by electronic instruments. However, as the targets move slightly between each pulse, the returned wave has a noticeable phase difference or &quot;phase shift&quot; from pulse to pulse.

====Pulse pair====
Doppler weather radars use this phase difference (pulse pair difference) to calculate the precipitation&#x27;s motion. The intensity of the successively returning pulse from the same scanned volume where targets have slightly moved is:

formula_25

So formula_26,
&quot;v&quot; = target speed = formula_27.
This speed is called the radial Doppler velocity because it gives only the radial variation of distance versus time between the radar and the target. The real speed and direction of motion has to be extracted by the process described below.

====Doppler dilemma====
The phase between pulse pairs can vary from -formula_28 and +formula_28, so the unambiguous Doppler velocity range is

:Vmax = formula_30formula_31

This is called the Nyquist velocity. This is inversely dependent on the time between successive pulses: the smaller the interval, the larger is the unambiguous velocity range. However, we know that the maximum range from reflectivity is directly proportional to
formula_32:

:x = formula_33

The choice becomes increasing the range from reflectivity at the expense of velocity range, or increasing the latter at the expense of range from reflectivity. In general, the useful range compromise is 100–150 km for reflectivity. This means for a wavelength of 5 cm (as shown in the diagram), an unambiguous velocity range of 12.5 to 18.75 metre/second is produced (for 150 km and 100 km, respectively). For a 10 cm radar such as the NEXRAD, the unambiguous velocity range would be doubled.

Some techniques using two alternating pulse repetition frequencies (PRF) allow a greater Doppler range. The velocities noted with the first pulse rate could be equal or different with the second. For instance, if the maximum velocity with a certain rate is 10 metre/second and the one with the other rate is 15 m/s. The data coming from both will be the same up to 10 m/s, and will differ thereafter. It is then possible to find a mathematical relation between the two returns and calculate the real velocity beyond the limitation of the two PRFs.

====Doppler interpretation====

In a uniform rainstorm moving eastward, a radar beam pointing west will &quot;see&quot; the raindrops moving toward itself, while a beam pointing east will &quot;see&quot; the drops moving away. When the beam scans to the north or to the south, no relative motion is noted.

=====Synoptic=====
In the synoptic scale interpretation, the user can extract the wind at different levels over the radar coverage region. As the beam is scanning 360 degrees around the radar, data will come from all those angles and be the radial projection of the actual wind on the individual angle. The intensity pattern formed by this scan can be represented by a cosine curve (maximum in the precipitation motion and zero in the perpendicular direction). One can then calculate the direction and the strength of the motion of particles as long as there is enough coverage on the radar screen.

However, the rain drops are falling. As the radar only sees the radial component and has a certain elevation from ground, the radial velocities are contaminated by some fraction of the falling speed. This component is negligible in small elevation angles, but must be taken into account for higher scanning angles.

=====Mesoscale=====
In the velocity data, there could be smaller zones in the radar coverage where the wind varies from the one mentioned above. For example, a thunderstorm is a mesoscale phenomenon which often includes rotations and turbulence. These may only cover few square kilometers but are visible by variations in the radial speed. Users can recognize velocity patterns in the wind associated with rotations, such as mesocyclone, convergence (outflow boundary) and divergence (downburst).

===Polarization===

Droplets of falling liquid water tend to have a larger horizontal axis due to the drag coefficient of air while falling (water droplets). This causes the water molecule dipole to be oriented in that direction; so, radar beams are, generally, polarized horizontally in order to receive the maximal signal reflection.

If two pulses are sent simultaneously with orthogonal polarization (vertical and horizontal, &quot;ZV&quot; and &quot;ZH&quot; respectively), two independent sets of data will be received. These signals can be compared in several useful ways:

:* Differential Reflectivity (&quot;Zdr&quot;) – Differential reflectivity is proportional to the ratio of the reflected horizontal and vertical power returns as &quot;ZH&quot; / &quot;ZV&quot;. Among other things, it is a good indicator of droplet shape. Differential reflectivity also can provide an estimate of average droplet size, as larger drops are more subject to deformation by aerodynamic forces than are smaller ones (that is, larger drops are more likely to become &quot;hamburger bun-shaped&quot;) as they fall through the air.
:* Correlation Coefficient (&quot;ρhv&quot;) – A statistical correlation between the reflected horizontal and vertical power returns. High values, near one, indicate homogeneous precipitation types, while lower values indicate regions of mixed precipitation types, such as rain and snow, or hail, or in extreme cases debris aloft, usually coinciding with a tornado debris signature and a tornado vortex signature.
:* Linear Depolarization Ratio (&quot;LDR&quot;) – This is a ratio of a vertical power return from a horizontal pulse or a horizontal power return from a vertical pulse. It can also indicate regions where there is a mixture of precipitation types.
:* Differential Phase (&quot;formula_34&quot;) – The differential phase is a comparison of the returned phase difference between the horizontal and vertical pulses. This change in phase is caused by the difference in the number of wave cycles (or wavelengths) along the propagation path for horizontal and vertically polarized waves. It should not be confused with the Doppler frequency shift, which is caused by the motion of the cloud and precipitation particles. Unlike the differential reflectivity, correlation coefficient and linear depolarization ratio, which are all dependent on reflected power, the differential phase is a &quot;propagation effect.&quot; It is a very good estimator of rain rate and is not affected by attenuation. The range derivative of differential phase (specific differential phase, &quot;Kdp&quot;) can be used to localize areas of strong precipitation/attenuation.

With more information about particle shape, dual-polarization radars can more easily distinguish airborne debris from precipitation, making it easier to locate tornados.

With this new knowledge added to the reflectivity, velocity, and spectrum width produced by Doppler weather radars, researchers have been working on developing algorithms to differentiate precipitation types, non-meteorological targets, and to produce better rainfall accumulation estimates. In the U.S., NCAR and NSSL have been world leaders in this field.

NOAA established a test deployment for dual-polametric radar at NSSL and equipped all its 10 cm NEXRAD radars with dual-polarization, which was completed in April 2013. In 2004, ARMOR Doppler Weather Radar in Huntsville, Alabama was equipped with a SIGMET Antenna Mounted Receiver, giving Dual-Polarmetric capabilities to the operator. McGill University J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory in Montreal, Canada has converted its instrument (1999) and the data were used operationally by Environment Canada in Montreal until its closure in 2018. Another Environment Canada radar, in King City (North of Toronto), was dual-polarized in 2005; it uses a 5 cm wavelength, which experiences greater attenuation. Environment Canada is converting graually all of its radars to dual-polarization. Météo-France is planning on incorporating dual-polarizing Doppler radar in its network coverage.

==Radar display methods==
Various methods of displaying data from radar scans have been developed over time to address the needs of its users. This is a list of common and specialized displays:

===Plan position indicator===
{{main|Plan position indicator}}
Since data is obtained one angle at a time, the first way of displaying it has been the Plan Position Indicator (PPI) which is only the layout of radar return on a two dimensional image. Importantly, the data coming from different distances to the radar are at different heights above ground.

This is very important as a high rain rate seen near the radar is relatively close to what reaches the ground but what is seen from 160 km away is about 1.5 km above ground and could be far different from the amount reaching the surface. It is thus difficult to compare weather echoes at different distances from the radar.

PPIs are affected by ground echoes near the radar. These can be misinterpreted as real echoes. Other products and further treatments of data have been developed to supplement such shortcomings.

Usage: Reflectivity, Doppler and polarimetric data can use PPI.

In the case of Doppler data, two points of view are possible: relative to the surface or the storm. When looking at the general motion of the rain to extract wind at different altitudes, it is better to use data relative to the radar. But when looking for rotation or wind shear under a thunderstorm, it is better to use storm relative images that subtract the general motion of precipitation leaving the user to view the air motion as if he would be sitting on the cloud.

===Constant-altitude plan position indicator===

{{main|Constant altitude plan position indicator}}
To avoid some of the PPI problems, the constant-altitude plan position indicator (CAPPI) has been developed by Canadian researchers. It is a horizontal cross-section through radar data. This way, one can compare precipitation on an equal footing at difference distance from the radar and avoid ground echoes. Although data are taken at a certain height above ground, a relation can be inferred between ground stations&#x27; reports and the radar data.

CAPPIs call for a large number of angles from near the horizontal to near the vertical of the radar to have a cut that is as close as possible at all distance to the height needed. Even then, after a certain distance, there isn&#x27;t any angle available and the CAPPI becomes the PPI of the lowest angle. The zigzag line on the angles diagram above shows the data used to produce 1.5 km and 4 km height CAPPIs. Notice that the section after 120 km is using the same data.

;Usage
Since the CAPPI uses the closest angle to the desired height at each point from the radar, the data can originate from slightly different altitudes, as seen on the image, in different points of the radar coverage. It is therefore crucial to have a large enough number of sounding angles to minimize this height change. Furthermore, the type of data must change relatively gradually with height to produce an image that is not noisy.

Reflectivity data being relatively smooth with height, CAPPIs are mostly used for displaying them. Velocity data, on the other hand, can change rapidly in direction with height and CAPPIs of them are not common. It seems that only McGill University is producing regularly Doppler CAPPIs with the 24 angles available on their radar. However, some researchers have published papers using velocity CAPPIs to study tropical cyclones and development of NEXRAD products. Finally, polarimetric data are recent and often noisy. There doesn&#x27;t seem to have regular use of CAPPI for them although the &quot;SIGMET&quot; company offer a software capable to produce those types of images.

===Vertical composite===

{{Main|Composite reflectivity}}
Another solution to the PPI problems is to produce images of the maximum reflectivity in a layer above ground. This solution is usually taken when the number of angles available is small or variable. The American National Weather Service is using such Composite as their scanning scheme can vary from 4 to 14 angles, according to their need, which would make very coarse CAPPIs. The Composite assures that no strong echo is missed in the layer and a treatment using Doppler velocities eliminates the ground echoes. Comparing base and composite products, one can locate virga and updrafts zones.

===Accumulations===
{{See also|Rain}}

Another important use of radar data is the ability to assess the amount of precipitation that has fallen over large basins, to be used in hydrological calculations; such data is useful in flood control, sewer management and dam construction. The computed data from radar weather may be used in conjunction with data from ground stations.

To produce radar accumulations, we have to estimate the rain rate over a point by the average value over that point between one PPI, or CAPPI, and the next; then multiply by the time between those images. If one wants for a longer period of time, one has to add up all the accumulations from image to image during that time.

===Echotops===
Aviation is a heavy user of radar data. One map particularly important in this field is the Echotops for flight planning and avoidance of dangerous weather. Most country weather radars scan enough angles to have a 3D set of data over the area of coverage. It is relatively easy to estimate the maximum altitude at which precipitation is found within the volume. However, those are not the tops of clouds, as they always extend above the precipitation.

===Vertical cross sections===

To know the vertical structure of clouds, in particular thunderstorms or the level of the melting layer, a vertical cross-section product of the radar data is available to meteorologists. This is done by displaying only the data along a line, from coordinates A to B, taken from the different angles scanned.

===Range Height Indicator===

When a weather radar is scanning in only the vertical axis, it can obtain data at the same resolution as PPI scans, as opposed to the often coarse interpolation from volumes, of which the scans therein are often separated in time by several minutes and thousands of feet. This output is called a &quot;Range Height Indicator&quot; (RHI), which is excellent for viewing the detailed smaller-scale vertical structure of a storm. As mentioned, this is different from the vertical cross section mentioned above, namely due to the fact that the radar antenna is scanning solely vertically, and does not scan over the entire 360 degrees around the site. This kind of product is typically only available on research radars.

===Radar networks===

Over the past few decades, radar networks have been extended to allow the production of composite views covering large areas. For instance, countries such as the United States, Canada, Australia, Japan, and much of Europe, combine images from their radar network into a singular display.

In fact, such a network can consist of different types of radar with different characteristics like beam width, wavelength and calibration. These differences have to be taken into account when matching data across the network, particularly when deciding what data to use when two radars cover the same point. If one uses the stronger echo but it comes from the most distant radar, one uses returns that are from higher altitude coming from rain or snow that might evaporate before reaching the ground (virga). If one uses data from the closest radar, it might be attenuated by passing through a thunderstorm. Composite images of precipitations using a network of radars are made with all those limitations in mind.

===Automatic algorithms===

To help meteorologists spot dangerous weather, mathematical algorithms have been introduced in the weather radar treatment programmes. These are particularly important in analyzing the Doppler velocity data as they are more complex. The polarization data will even need more algorithms.

Main algorithms for reflectivity:
*Vertically Integrated Liquid (VIL) is an estimate of the total mass of precipitation in the clouds.
*&quot;VIL Density&quot; is VIL divided by the height of the cloud top. It is a clue to the possibility of large hail in thunderstorms.
*&quot;Potential wind gust&quot;, which can estimate the winds under a cloud (a downdraft) using the VIL and the height of the echotops (radar estimated top of the cloud) for a given storm cell.
*Hail algorithms that estimate the presence of hail and its probable size.

Main algorithms for Doppler velocities:
*Mesocyclone detection: is triggered by a velocity change over a small circular area. The algorithm is searching for a &quot;doublet&quot; of inbound/outbound velocities with the zero line of velocities, between the two, along a radial line from the radar. Usually the mesocyclone detection must be found on two or more stacked progressive tilts of the beam to be significative of rotation into a thunderstorm cloud.
*TVS or Tornado Vortex Signature algorithm is essentially a mesocyclone with a large velocity threshold found through many scanning angles. This algorithm is used in NEXRAD to indicate the possibility of a tornado formation.
*Wind shear in low levels. This algorithm detects the variation of wind velocities from point to point in the data and looks for a &quot;doublet&quot; of inbound/outbound velocities with the zero line perpendicular to the radar beam. The wind shear is associated with downdraft, (downburst and microburst), gust fronts and turbulence under thunderstorms.
*VAD Wind Profile (VWP) is a display that estimates the direction and speed of the horizontal wind at various upper levels of the atmosphere, using the technique explained in the Doppler section.

===Animations===

The animation of radar products can show the evolution of reflectivity and velocity patterns. The user can extract information on the dynamics of the meteorological phenomena, including the ability to extrapolate the motion and observe development or dissipation. This can also reveal non-meteorological artifacts (false echoes) that will be discussed later.

====Radar Integrated Display with Geospatial Elements====
A new popular presentation of weather radar data in United States is via &quot;Radar Integrated Display with Geospatial Elements&quot; (RIDGE) in which the radar data is projected on a map with geospatial elements such as topography maps, highways, state/county boundaries and weather warnings. The projection is often flexible giving the user a choice of various geographic elements. It is frequently used in conjunction with animations of radar data over a time period.{{Clear}}

==Limitations and artifacts==

Radar data interpretation depends on many hypotheses about the atmosphere and the weather targets, including:
*International Standard Atmosphere.
*Targets small enough to obey the Rayleigh scattering, resulting in the return being proportional to the precipitation rate.
*The volume scanned by the beam is full of meteorological targets (rain, snow, etc.), all of the same variety and in a uniform concentration.
*No attenuation
*No amplification
*Return from side lobes of the beam are negligible.
*The beam is close to a Gaussian function curve with power decreasing to half at half the width.
*The outgoing and returning waves are similarly polarized.
*There is no return from multiple reflections.

These assumptions are not always met; one must be able to differentiate between reliable and dubious echoes.

===Anomalous propagation (non-standard atmosphere)===
{{Main|Anomalous propagation}}
The first assumption is that the radar beam is moving through air that cools down at a certain rate with height. The position of the echoes depend heavily on this hypothesis. However, the real atmosphere can vary greatly from the norm.

====Super refraction====
{{main|Super refraction}}
Temperature inversions often form near the ground, for instance by air cooling at night while remaining warm aloft. As the index of refraction of air decreases faster than normal the radar beam bends toward the ground instead of continuing upward. Eventually, it will hit the ground and be reflected back toward the radar. The processing program will then wrongly place the return echoes at the height and distance it would have been in normal conditions.

This type of false return is relatively easy to spot on a time loop if it is due to night cooling or marine inversion as one sees very strong echoes developing over an area, spreading in size laterally but not moving and varying greatly in intensity. However, inversion of temperature exists ahead of warm fronts and the abnormal propagation echoes are then mixed with real rain.

The extreme of this problem is when the inversion is very strong and shallow, the radar beam reflects many times toward the ground as it has to follow a waveguide path. This will create multiple bands of strong echoes on the radar images.

This situation can be found with inversions of temperature aloft or rapid decrease of moisture with height. In the former case, it could be difficult to notice.

====Under refraction====
On the other hand, if the air is unstable and cools faster than the standard atmosphere with height, the beam ends up higher than expected. This indicates that precipitation is occurring higher than the actual height. Such an error is difficult to detect without additional temperature lapse rate data for the area.

===Non-Rayleigh targets===
If we want to reliably estimate the precipitation rate, the targets have to be 10 times smaller than the radar wave according to Rayleigh scattering. This is because the water molecule has to be excited by the radar wave to give a return. This is relatively true for rain or snow as 5 or 10 cm wavelength radars are usually employed.

However, for very large hydrometeors, since the wavelength is on the order of stone, the return levels off according to Mie theory. A return of more than 55 dBZ is likely to come from hail but won&#x27;t vary proportionally to the size. On the other hand, very small targets such as cloud droplets are too small to be excited and do not give a recordable return on common weather radars.

===Resolution and partially filled scanned volume===
As demonstrated at the start of the article, radar beams have a physical dimension and data are sampled at discrete angles, not continuously, along each angle of elevation. This results in an averaging of the values of the returns for reflectivity, velocities and polarization data on the resolution volume scanned.

In the figure to the left, at the top is a view of a thunderstorm taken by a wind profiler as it was passing overhead. This is like a vertical cross section through the cloud with 150-metre vertical and 30-metre horizontal resolution. The reflectivity has large variations in a short distance. Compare this with a simulated view of what a regular weather radar would see at 60 km, in the bottom of the figure. Everything has been smoothed out. Not only the coarser resolution of the radar blur the image but the sounding incorporates area that are echo free, thus extending the thunderstorm beyond its real boundaries.

This shows how the output of weather radar is only an approximation of reality. The image to the right compares real data from two radars almost colocated. The TDWR has about half the beamwidth of the other and one can see twice more details than with the NEXRAD.

Resolution can be improved by newer equipment but some things cannot. As mentioned previously, the volume scanned increases with distance so the possibility that the beam is only partially filled also increases. This leads to underestimation of the precipitation rate at larger distances and fools the user into thinking that rain is lighter as it moves away.{{Clear}}

===Beam geometry===
The radar beam has a distribution of energy similar to the diffraction pattern of a light passing through a slit. This is because the wave is transmitted to the parabolic antenna through a slit in the wave-guide at the focal point. Most of the energy is at the center of the beam and decreases along a curve close to a Gaussian function on each side. However, there are secondary peaks of emission that will sample the targets at off-angles from the center. Designers attempt to minimize the power transmitted by such lobes, but they cannot be eliminated.

When a secondary lobe hits a reflective target such as a mountain or a strong thunderstorm, some of the energy is reflected to the radar. This energy is relatively weak but arrives at the same time that the central peak is illuminating a different azimuth. The echo is thus misplaced by the processing program. This has the effect of actually broadening the real weather echo making a smearing of weaker values on each side of it. This causes the user to overestimate the extent of the real echoes.
{{Clear}}

===Non-weather targets===
There is more than rain and snow in the sky. Other objects can be misinterpreted as rain or snow by weather radars. Insects and arthropods are swept along by the prevailing winds, while birds follow their own course. As such, fine line patterns within weather radar imagery, associated with converging winds, are dominated by insect returns. Bird migration, which tends to occur overnight within the lowest 2000 metres of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, contaminates wind profiles gathered by weather radar, particularly the WSR-88D, by increasing the environmental wind returns by 30–60 km/h. Other objects within radar imagery include:
*Thin metal strips (chaff) dropped by military aircraft to fool enemies.
*Solid obstacles such as mountains, buildings, and aircraft.
*Ground and sea clutter.
*Reflections from nearby buildings (&quot;urban spikes&quot;).

Such extraneous objects have characteristics that allow a trained eye to distinguish them. It is also possible to eliminate some of them with post-treatment of data using reflectivity, Doppler, and polarization data.

===Wind farms===

The rotating blades of windmills on modern wind farms can return the radar beam to the radar if they are in its path. Since the blades are moving, the echoes will have a velocity and can be mistaken for real precipitation. The closer the wind farm, the stronger the return, and the combined signal from many towers is stronger. In some conditions, the radar can even see toward and away velocities that generate false positives for the tornado vortex signature algorithm on weather radar; such an event occurred in 2009 in Dodge City, Kansas.

As with other structures that stand in the beam, attenuation of radar returns from beyond windmills may also lead to underestimation.
{{Clear}}

===Attenuation===

Microwaves used in weather radars can be absorbed by rain, depending on the wavelength used. For 10 cm radars, this attenuation is negligible. That is the reason why countries with high water content storms are using 10 cm wavelength, for example the US NEXRAD. The cost of a larger antenna, klystron and other related equipment is offset by this benefit.

For a 5 cm radar, absorption becomes important in heavy rain and this attenuation leads to underestimation of echoes in and beyond a strong thunderstorm. Canada and other northern countries use this less costly kind of radar as the precipitation in such areas is usually less intense; however, users must consider this characteristic when interpreting data. The images above show how a strong line of echoes seems to vanish as it moves over the radar. To compensate for this behaviour, radar sites are often chosen to somewhat overlap in coverage to give different points of view of the same storms if one is experiencing attenuation.

Shorter wavelengths are even more attenuated and are often only useful in shorter range applications - consequently, many television stations in the United States have 5 cm radars to cover their audience area. Knowing their limitations and using them in conjunction with local NEXRADs can supplement the data available to a meteorologist.

Due to the spread of dual-polarization radar systems, robust and efficient approaches for the compensation of rain attenuation are currently implemented by operational weather services. Attenuation correction in weather radars for snow particles is an active research topic.

===Bright band===

A radar beam&#x27;s reflectivity depends on the diameter of the target and its capacity to reflect. Snowflakes are large but weakly reflective while rain drops are small but highly reflective.

When snow falls through a layer above freezing temperature, it melts into rain. Using the reflectivity equation, one can demonstrate that the returns from the snow before melting and the rain after, are not too different as the change in dielectric constant compensates for the change in size. However, during the melting process, the radar wave &quot;sees&quot; something akin to very large droplets as snow flakes become coated with water.

This gives enhanced returns that can be mistaken for stronger precipitations. On a PPI, this will show up as an intense ring of precipitation at the altitude where the beam crosses the melting level while on a series of CAPPIs, only the ones near that level will have stronger echoes. A good way to confirm a bright band is to make a vertical cross section through the data, as illustrated in the picture above.

An opposite problem is that drizzle (precipitation with small water droplet diameter) tends not to show up on radar because radar returns are proportional to the sixth power of droplet diameter.

===Multiple reflections===

{{Main|Three body scatter spike}}
It is assumed that the beam hits the weather targets and returns directly to the radar. In fact, there is energy reflected in all directions. Most of it is weak, and multiple reflections diminish it even further so what can eventually return to the radar from such an event is negligible. However, some situations allow a multiple-reflected radar beam to be received by the radar antenna. For instance, when the beam hits hail, the energy spread toward the wet ground will be reflected back to the hail and then to the radar. The resulting echo is weak but noticeable. Due to the extra path length it has to go through, it arrives later at the antenna and is placed further than its source. This gives a kind of triangle of false weaker reflections placed radially behind the hail.{{Clear}}

==Solutions and future solutions==

===Filtering===
These two images show what can be achieved to clean up radar data. On the first image made from the raw returns, it is difficult to distinguish the real weather. Since rain and snow clouds are usually moving, Doppler velocities can be used to eliminate a good part of the clutter (ground echoes, reflections from buildings seen as urban spikes, anomalous propagation). The other image has been filtered using this property.

However, not all non-meteorological targets remain stationary (birds, insects, dust). Others, like the bright band, depend on the structure of the precipitation. Polarization offers a direct typing of the echoes which could be used to filter more false data or produce separate images for specialized purposes, such as clutter, birds, etc. subsets.

===Mesonet===

Another question is the resolution. As mentioned, radar data are an average of the scanned volume by the beam. Resolution can be improved by larger antenna or denser networks. A program by the Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) aims to supplement the regular NEXRAD (a network in the United States) using many low cost X-band (3 cm) weather radar mounted on cellular telephone towers. These radars will subdivide the large area of the NEXRAD into smaller domains to look at altitudes below its lowest angle. These will give details not otherwise available.

Using 3 cm radars, the antenna of each radar is small (about 1 meter diameter) but the resolution is similar at short distance to that of NEXRAD. The attenuation is significant due to the wavelength used but each point in the coverage area is seen by many radars, each viewing from a different direction and compensating for data lost from others.

=== Scanning strategies ===

The number of elevation scanned and the time taken for a complete cycle depend on the weather. For example, with little or no precipitation the scheme may be limited to the lowest angles and use longer impulses in order to detect wind shift near the surface. On the other hand, for violent thunderstorms it is better to scan a large range of angles in order to have a 3-D view of the precipitation as often as possible. To mitigate the different demands, scanning strategies have been developed according to the type of radar, the wavelength used and the most common weather situations in the area considered.

One example of scanning strategies is offered by the US NEXRAD radar network which has evolved over time. In 2008, it added extra resolution of data, and in 2014, additional intra-cycle scanning of the lowest level elevation (MESO-SAILS).

===Electronic sounding===
{{See also|Multifunction Phased Array Radar}}
With 5 to 10 minutes between complete scans of weather radar, much data is lost as a thunderstorm develops. A Phased-array radar is being tested at the National Severe Storms Lab in Norman, Oklahoma, to speed the data gathering. A team in Japan has also deployed a phased-array radar for 3D NowCasting at the RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science (AICS).

==Specialized applications==
===Avionics weather radar===
Aircraft application of radar systems include weather radar, collision avoidance, target tracking, ground proximity, and other systems. For commercial weather radar, ARINC 708 is the primary specification for weather radar systems using an airborne pulse-Doppler radar.

====Antennas====
Unlike ground weather radar, which is set at a fixed angle, airborne weather radar is being utilized from the nose or wing of an aircraft. Not only will the aircraft be moving up, down, left, and right, but it will be rolling as well. To compensate for this, the antenna is linked and calibrated to the vertical gyroscope located on the aircraft. By doing this, the pilot is able to set a pitch or angle to the antenna that will enable the stabilizer to keep the antenna pointed in the right direction under moderate maneuvers. The small servo motors will not be able to keep up with abrupt maneuvers, but it will try. In doing this the pilot is able to adjust the radar so that it will point towards the weather system of interest. If the airplane is at a low altitude, the pilot would want to set the radar above the horizon line so that ground clutter is minimized on the display. If the airplane is at a very high altitude, the pilot will set the radar at a low or negative angle, to point the radar towards the clouds wherever they may be relative to the aircraft. If the airplane changes attitude, the stabilizer will adjust itself accordingly so that the pilot doesn&#x27;t have to fly with one hand and adjust the radar with the other.

====Receivers/transmitters====
There are two major systems when talking about the receiver/transmitter: the first is high-powered systems, and the second is low-powered systems; both of which operate in the X-band frequency range (8,000 – 12,500 MHz). High-powered systems operate at 10,000 – 60,000 watts. These systems consist of magnetrons that are fairly expensive (approximately $1,700) and allow for considerable noise due to irregularities with the system. Thus, these systems are highly dangerous for arcing and are not safe to be used around ground personnel. However, the alternative would be the low-powered systems. These systems operate 100 – 200 watts, and require a combination of high gain receivers, signal microprocessors, and transistors to operate as effectively as the high-powered systems. The complex microprocessors help to eliminate noise, providing a more accurate and detailed depiction of the sky. Also, since there are fewer irregularities throughout the system, the low-powered radars can be used to detect turbulence via the Doppler Effect. Since low-powered systems operate at considerable less wattage, they are safe from arcing and can be used at virtually all times.

===Thunderstorm tracking===
{{Main|Nowcasting (meteorology){{!}}Nowcasting}}

Digital radar systems have capabilities far beyond their predecessors. They offer thunderstorm tracking surveillance which provides users with the ability to acquire detailed information of each storm cloud being tracked. Thunderstorms are identified by matching raw precipitation data received from the radar pulse, to a preprogrammed template. In order for a thunderstorm to be confirmed, it must meet strict definitions of intensity and shape to distinguish it from a non-convective cloud. Usually, it must show signs of horizontal organization and vertical continuity: and have a core or a more intense center identified and tracked by digital radar trackers. Once the thunderstorm cell is identified, speed, distance covered, direction, and Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) are all tracked and recorded.

===Doppler radar and bird migration===

Using Doppler weather radar is not limited to determining the location and velocity of precipitation. It can track bird migrations as well (non-weather targets section). The radio waves from the radars bounce off rain and birds alike (or even insects like butterflies). The US National Weather Service, for instance, has reported having flights of birds appear on their radars as clouds and then fade away when the birds land. The U.S. National Weather Service St. Louis has even reported monarch butterflies appearing on its radars.

Different programs in North America use regular weather radars and specialized radar data to determine the paths, height of flight, and timing of migrations. This is useful information in planning windmill farm placement and operation, to reduce bird fatalities, improve aviation safety and other wildlife management. In Europe, there have been similar developments and even a comprehensive forecast program for aviation safety, based on radar detection.

=== Meteorite fall detection ===

An image shows the Park Forest, Illinois, meteorite fall which occurred on 26 March 2003. The red-green feature at the upper left is the motion of clouds near the radar itself, and a signature of falling meteorites is inside the yellow ellipse at image center. The intermixed red and green pixels indicate turbulence, in this case arising from the wakes of falling, high-velocity meteorites.

According to the American Meteor Society, meteorite falls occur on a daily basis somewhere on Earth. However, the database of worldwide meteorite falls maintained by the Meteoritical Society typically records only about 10-15 new meteorite falls annually

Meteorites occur when a meteoroid falls into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, generating an optically bright meteor by ionization and frictional heating. If the meteoroid is large enough and infall velocity is low enough, it will reach the ground. When the falling meteoroid decelerate below about 2–4 km/s, usually at an altitude between 15 and 25 km, they no longer generate an optically bright meteor and enter &quot;dark flight&quot;. Because of this, most of the falls occurring into the oceans, during the day, or otherwise go unnoticed.

It is in dark flight that falling meteoroids typically fall through the interaction volume of most types of radars. It has been demonstrated that it is possible to identify falling meteoroids in weather radar imagery. This is especially useful for meteorite recovery, as weather radars are part of widespread networks and scan the atmosphere continuously. Furthermore, the meteorites cause local wind turbulence, which is noticeable on Doppler outputs, and fall nearly vertically so their resting place on the ground is close to their radar signature.

<text>The Miskitos are a native people in Central America. Their territory extends from Cape Camarón, Honduras, to Río Grande de Matagalpa, Nicaragua, along the Mosquito Coast, in the Western Caribbean zone. Their population was estimated in 2024 as 535,225, with 456,000 living in Nicaragua.

The Miskito people speak the Miskito language and Miskito Coast Creole. Most also speak other languages, such as Spanish, English, and German. Spanish is the language of education and government, but some families educate their children in English, German, or Miskito. Miskito Coast Creole, an English-based creole language, came about through frequent contact with the British for trading, as they predominated along this coast from the 17th to the 19th centuries. Many Miskitos are Christians. A 1987 peace agreement afforded them land rights over traditional lands. However, despite significant political struggles throughout their history, today the Miskito face human rights violations over land rights disputes, as recognized by the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights.

==Etymology==
“Miskito” derives from the term &quot;Miskut uplikanan&quot; (&quot;people of Miskut&quot;). Miskut was a legendary Miskito patriarch or great leader.

==Important Miskito communities==
*Bluefields, Nicaragua (first capital city)
*Corn Islands, Nicaragua

==Miskito eras==
*Pre-Monarchic (from the origin of Miskito people until the 16th century): the era of the Miskito Gods.
*Monarchic (16th – 19th centuries): the era of the Miskito kings and European influence.
*Post-Monarchic (20th century): The end of the Miskito Kingdom, and invasion of the Miskito territories by Honduras and Nicaragua.
*Modern (21st century): the current Miskito Nation, on the Atlantic coast of Honduras and Nicaragua.

==History==
Before the arrival of Europeans in the region in the early 16th century, the area was divided into numerous small egalitarian native American groups speaking old Miskito language. The Spanish listed 30 nations in Taguzgalpa and Tologalpa, as the Spanish understood their geography. Karl Offen&#x27;s analysis of this historic data suggests there were about a half dozen entities, groups who were distinct by their language dialects, who were situated in the river basins. Much of the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua and Honduras remained free from Spanish authority during the 16th century. The region became a haven for Dutch, English and Welsh privateers (for example Henry Morgan, Daniel Montbars and William Dampier) during the early 17th century.

Some African people arrived at the Mosquito Coast from wrecked slave ships in the mid-17th century. These people, along with escaped slaves from the Providence Island colony, settled around Cape Gracias a Dios and intermarried with the indigenous people. The Spanish referred to these mixed-race descendants as &quot;Mosquito Zambo&quot; (&quot;Mosquito&quot; was their transliteration of Miskito). Those living in the southern (Nicaraguan) region were less racially mixed. Modern scholars have classified them as Tawira Miskito. Rivalries between these two groups and competition for territory often led to wars, which were divisive in the 18th century.

===British-Miskito alliance===

English privateers working through the Providence Island Company made informal alliances with the Miskito. These English began to crown Miskito leaders as kings (or chiefs); their territory was called the Miskito Kingdom (the English adopted the Spanish term for the indigenous people). A 1699 written account of the kingdom described it as spread out in various communities along the coast but not including all the territory. It probably did not include the settlements of English traders. The king did not have total power. The 1699 description noted that the kings and governors had no power except in war time, even in matters of justice. Otherwise the people were all equal. Their superior leaders were named by the English as the king, a governor, a general and, by the 1750s, an admiral. Historical information on kings is often obscure as many of the kings were semi-mythical. These &quot;kings&quot; were not recognized by the Native American Tawira Miskito.

In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, Miskitos began a series of raids attacking Spanish-held territories and the still independent indigenous groups in the area. Miskito raiders reached as far north as the Yucatán, and as far south as Costa Rica. Many of their captives were sold into slavery to European slave traders (even as the Zambo were originally slaves themselves), and many of them ended up working on Jamaican sugar plantations. In addition, from 1720 onwards, the Jamaican colonial authorities commissioned the Miskito to capture Maroons in the Blue Mountains, as they were effective trackers. The Zambos were one of the primary drivers of slave-based depopulation of the area.

The Zambo Miskito leader and the British concluded a formal Treaty of Friendship and Alliance in 1740. The British appointed John Hodgson as Superintendent of the Shore. The British established a protectorate over the Miskito Nation, often called the Mosquito Coast (related to the original Spanish name).

The Miskito kingdom aided Britain during the American War of Independence by attacking Spanish colonies to draw off their forces. It gained several victories alongside the British. But, at the conclusion of the peace in 1783, Britain had to cede control over the coast to Spain. The British withdrawal was completed at the end of June 1787. To compensate their Miskito supporters, the British re-settled 537 Zambo Africans often misnamed Miskitos, together with their 1,677 Native American slaves, from Mosquitia to the Bay settlement in British Honduras, present-day Belize. Despite their official withdrawal, Britain maintained an unofficial protectorate over the kingdom. They often intervened to protect Miskito interests against Spanish encroachments.
===Independence era===
In addition to the area&#x27;s geographic isolation, the Miskito military capacity and British support allowed the people to retain their independence when Spain controlled the Pacific side of Central America. The Miskito Coast remained independent throughout much of the period of the Federal Republic of Central America, but Nicaragua finally absorbed the territory in 1894.

Once the Central American republics became independent in the early- to mid-19th century, they had less power in relation to other nations than did Spain, and struggled to protect their own territorial interests against filibusters and the United States government, which took an increasing strategic interest in the area.

The United Kingdom took an interest in the affairs on the Mosquito Coast, as it had trade positions in Belize/British Honduras and Jamaica. In addition, US trading interests began to develop in the region. British governors in Belize began issuing commissions and appointments to Miskito kings and other officials, such as King Robert Charles Frederick, crowned in Belize in 1825. British officials regularly officially recognized the various Miskito offices; it worked to protect Miskito interests against the Central American republics and against the United States.

The latter contested British influence as per the Monroe Doctrine. The United States involvement in war with Mexico prevented it from enforcing the doctrine. As Britain gradually became less interested in its commissioning of Miskito nobility, the Miskito effectively began to operate as an independent state. Due to British economic interest in Central America (particularly British Honduras, now Belize), they regularly traded with the Miskito.

After Nicaragua declared independence in 1821, combined Miskito-Zambo raiders began to attack Honduran settlements. They sometimes rescued enslaved Miskito before they could transported beyond their reach. They also enslaved women from other tribes for use as sexual partners.

Their society allowed polygamy. The Miskito population boomed as the men had more children with their slave women. These raids continued for many years after animosity between Britain and Spain ended at the international level. For a long time, the Miskito considered themselves superior to other indigenous tribes of the area, whom they referred to as &quot;wild&quot;. The Miskito commonly adopted European dress and English names.

From the middle of the nineteenth century, British interest in the region began to wane. At the Treaty of Managua in 1860, the United Kingdom allowed Nicaragua to have uncontested claim over the Mosquito Coast. The treaty provided for a Miskito Reserve, a self-governing entity that enjoyed semi-sovereign rights. Nicaraguan forces occupied the area in 1894 and took over the state. The British restored the Miskito Reserve in July, but Nicaraguan forces reoccupied in August 1894 and ended its independence.

Various major American fruit companies (such as the United Fruit Company, which had begun large-scale production of bananas in the Miskito Reserve) supported Nicaragua&#x27;s takeover of power in the area. The American companies preferred Nicaraguan authority to the Miskito, especially as the Miskito elite was more prepared to protect the rights of small landholders than was the Nicaragua government.

===20th century===
==== Early 20th century ====
The Miskito who lived in the Jinotega Department, west of the North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region, were much different from the Miskito who lived along the Caribbean coast. The Miskito in Jinotega were Catholic as a result of Spanish colonial influence, were not allied with the British, and often traded with the Spanish-speaking mestizos from the Pacific coast.

During the conflict in 1927–1933 between Augusto César Sandino and the United States over the United States occupation of Nicaragua, both sides tried to enlist the Miskito in providing food and transport. In 1926, many Miskito in the Jinotega region joined Augusto Sandino and his troops. The Miskito of Jinotega had closer ties with Sandino and the Sandinista National Liberation Front, which organized agricultural cooperatives and built schools and health centers in the area.

During the 1960s and the 1970s, Nicaragua began to expropriate native-held land for nationalization. During these decades, the mainstream of Nicaraguan national politics recognized the Miskito only when asking them to vote for the Nicaraguan National Liberal Party.

==== Political conflict in the 1980s ====
In the 1980s, the Sandinista government extended their influence over the region via its &quot;Comités de Defensa Sandinista&quot;. In response, several Miskito groups formed counter-revolutionary squads, who carried on terrorist attacks against the revolutionary government. On 25 February 1982, Steadman Fagoth, one of the counter-revolutionary leaders, took refuge in Honduras along with 3000 Miskito. Meanwhile, the Sandinistas began to denounce the activities of the Contras in the Coco River zone. In 1983, the government proclaimed a state of emergency in the Río Coco zone, which was maintained until 1988.

A 1986 documentary called &quot;Nicaragua Was Our Home&quot; documented the persecution of the Miskito at the hands of the Nicaraguan government. The film features interviews with Miskito Indian people and some non-Miskito clergy who lived among them; they recounted actions of the government against them, including bombing of villages, shootings, and forced removal of people from their homes. The film was shown on some PBS stations and at the 1986 Sundance Film Festival.

In September 1987, the Nicaraguan legislature passed a statute providing autonomy to the Miskito. This essentially defused Miskito resistance.

==== 1990s ====
In 1990 the Sandinistas were defeated in national elections. The Miskito signed an agreement with the newly appointed Minister of the Interior, Carlos Hurtado, to create &quot;security zones,&quot; prepare the return of the national police forces to the region, and integrate 50 Miskito into the police force.

Brooklyn Rivera, one of the Miskito guerrilla leaders, became the director of the INDERA (Nicaraguan Institute of Development of Autonomous Regions), an illegal structure under the 1987 law on autonomy. The government suppressed the INDERA a few years later, allegedly because of conflict between the Miskito and other native groups

=== 21st century ===
Despite the 1987 peace agreement affording the Miskito people substantial territory, conflict over land rights remains. Increasing waves of settlers have relocated to ancestral Miskito lands as a result of drought and attraction to gold and timber. Illegal purchases of indigenous lands afforded the settling farmers void land rights. Violence between settlers and Miskito, Rama, and Ulwa people have led to the burning of villages, rape of women, kidnappings and the death of at least 30. Approximately 600 indigenous people have fled to Honduras.

Both sides acknowledge that the Nicaraguan government has not worked to ameliorate this conflict. The Inter-American Commission for Human Rights repeatedly called for action in order to protect the Miskitos, to no governmental response. President Daniel Ortega has acknowledged that Miskito land claims are legitimate, and any land sales were not legal. The government arrested various public notaries for the authorization of illegal land sales, and created a special commission over the issue under the prosecutor general. However, the government has not addressed the violence. The public officials implicated in illegal land sales were Sandinistas, members of Ortega&#x27;s own party.

====Declaration of independence====
In April 2009 a group of Miskito elders declared independence from Nicaragua under the name Community Nation of Moskitia. This declaration has not been met with any formal response from the government of Nicaragua nor has it been recognised by any other state. The independence movement is led by Hector Williams, who is described as the leader of the Miskito and uses the title &quot;Wihta Tara,&quot; or Great Judge. They cited as reasons for their renewed desire for independence the serious economic problems damaging their traditional fishing industry and the recent election of Daniel Ortega as president of Nicaragua. Many of them had fought as Contras against him during the Nicaraguan Civil War and still opposed him. Thus, many Miskito who supported the independence movement were those who had suffered greatly economically.

==== Impact of recent hurricanes ====

In 1998, Hurricane Mitch heavily damaged coastal regions where the Miskito live. On 4 September 2007, Category 5 Hurricane Felix with peak sustained winds of 160 mph struck the coast near Punta Gorda River, Nicaragua. Damage and death toll estimates are around 100 but are likely to be higher.

Towards the end of the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, the Miskito Coast experienced the landfall of two major hurricanes within two weeks, breaking several Atlantic and Nicaraguan records. Slow-moving Hurricane Eta landed on November 3 just south of the region&#x27;s major city Bilwi, and after one day turned west-northwest towards Honduras and then north back into the Caribbean. Hurricane Iota landed on November 16 only 25 km south of Eta&#x27;s landing, and continued west through northern Nicaragua in the direction of El Salvador. Both hurricanes were strong Category 4s upon landfall.

== Classification ==

=== Applicability of the term &quot;ethnic group&quot; to Miskito people ===
Historically, the Miskito were not recognized as a singular &quot;people&quot; until their population grew in the area beyond being categorized as &quot;sparsely populated&quot;.

=== Subgroups ===
As a result of the ethnic heterogeneity present in the Miskito people, various ethnic subgroups exist within the larger Miskito identity. A major ethnic distinction exists between the Miskitos; Mam, Tawira and Wangki. The Miskito Wangki constitute a large ethnic representation in the nation in the Cabo Gracias a Dios area. The Miskito Wangki would go on to form strong relationships with the British. The Wangki Miskito speak the &quot;Wanki Bila&quot; dialect of Miskito.

The Tawira Miskito, in contrast, have greater native ethnic representation and speak the &quot;Kabo Bila&quot; dialect of Miskito. According to Meringer, historical records reference the Tawira as &quot;pure Indians&quot;. In order to counter their subjugation by the Zambo Miskito, the Tawira Miskito would seek out Spanish allies in the eighteenth century.

== Geography ==

===Nicaragua===
Prior to European contact, Miskitos were scattered along the Atlantic Coast of Nicaragua, inhabiting interior mountainous areas with numerous rivers and forests. The central point of Miskito territory is known as the Coco River or Wangks River, which also serves as a border between Nicaragua and Honduras.

Today, around 150,000 Miskito people live in Nicaragua. They are distributed among over 300 communities in 23 territories throughout Nicaragua’s Caribbean Lowlands and the Mosquito Coast. The town of Awastara is a major population centre and historical site for the Miskito people.

=== Honduras ===

Prior to the 1859 Wyke-Cruz treaty with Britain, Miskito people inhabited the Cape of Gracias a Dios on the Caribbean coast and Honduran side of the Nicaragua-Honduras border. Despite the Wyke-Cruz treaty giving the Miskito authority over the land, it was ignored by the Honduran authorities. However, their autonomy has been preserved as a result of their geographic isolation. In 2013, the Honduran granted five Miskito communities land titles to their traditional land, totaling about . 100 villages exist in this area, containing a population of approximately 22,000.

== Culture ==
=== Language ===
The majority of Miskitos speak their native Miskito language. The Miskito language is a part of the Misumalpan language family. Some villages also speak Sumu, a closely related language within these ethnic groups. In addition, many Miskitos have adopted figures of speech from English and Spanish largely resulting from increased instances of bilingualism. The Caribbean areas of Jamaica, Belize, San Andrés, and Providence, Colombia share linguistic commonalities with the Miskito Coast population, likely stemming from the mixture of native languages, African languages, as well as colonial languages.

=== Religion ===

Christianity:

Moravian and Catholicism.

Old Miskito religion:

Polytheism (Katidawanka, laptadawanka, etc.).

=== Miskito Gods ===

Miskito people were polytheist in the Pre-monarchic era. However, there are no records of human sacrifices like the Mayan or Incas in America. Their gods were Lapta (god of the sun), Kati (god of the moon), Slilma (god of the stars), Alwani (god of thunder), Imyula (god of lightning), Dusdawanka (god of trees and plants), Lidawanka (god of ocean, lakes and rivers), Rayakadawanka (god of living creatures), Sinslakadawanka (god of wisdom), Disangdawanka (god of fertility) Rakidawan (god of healing), Lasadawanka (god of dead souls) and Pruradawanka (god of death).

==== Shamanism ====
Prior to contact, Miskito people practiced a type of Shamanism where the shaman (known as Sukya) was seen as a healer by the community. The Sukya discovered cures by dreaming about them, and blowing smoke on the affected area. Group traditions included ritual dancing and drinking of a beverage known as mishla. Funeral traditions included a commemorative ceremony one year after death called Sikro. Only one leading shaman, known as Supreme Sukya or Okuli, could exist at a time and was revered by neighboring tribes as well. The Okuli exists as a representative to evil spirits, called Lasas. In the 1980s, shamans and group ceremonies took place in private.

==== Moravian Church ====
The Moravian Church attempted to proselytize the Miskito beginning in 1849, after attempting to provide a religious institution for a nearby German community which later failed. The Moravian Church represents a small branch of Protestantism that emphasizes community unity and simple living. By 1894, the Moravian Church had become a major interest group in the Atlantic coast area during the Nicaraguan reincorporation of the area through the establishment of missions. In the 20th century, the Moravian Church furthered its institutional presence through schools and production of religious materials and services in the Miskito native language. They did little to quell hostilities between the Miskito and Spanish Catholics. By the 1960s, the Moravian Church seemed to play a central role in Miskito communities for anthropologists studying the area.

==== Catholicism ====
Catholic converts existed in the Miskito region as early as the 1930s. Because of poor resources to send properly trained parsons and pastors, Miskito Catholics practice several &quot;innovations&quot; specific to the Miskito Coast. The lack of institutional Catholic presence led to many Moravian practices shared by Catholic leaders in the area. As a result, many Miskitos view differences in religions as institutionally based rather than theologically based. Churches in the area hold sanctity when occupied by the community, and are not revered as buildings in and of themselves. Further, Miskito experience divinity through dreams and discussions of good, bad, and human spirits. Shamans known as prapit or pasa yapti are the only individuals who physically experience divinity. Thus, Miskito Catholicism departs significantly from traditional Spaniard Catholicism as practiced by the majority of Nicaragua as it contains dimensions of a spiritual realm of divinity which humans can sometimes access.

=== Literature ===
The Miskito share folktales called kisi for entertainment. Kisi often include tales of a trickster rabbit named Tibang or Bangbang as well as kings, overall serving themes of authority and human nature and general. Some stories include myths of Duhindu, creatures similar to gnomes that sometimes kidnap children. According to researchers Ken Decker and Andy Keener, the Miskito share poems and stories, but do not have largely disseminated pieces of literature nor has anything been published. Media that appears in the area is largely in Spanish, with some programming in English and in regional languages.

=== Arts ===
The Miskito have musical traditions including round dances and traditional songs, as well as theatrical pieces including the symbol of the Miskito king. Regarding decorative arts, funeral ceremonies involve wooden masks.

== Institutions ==

=== Political structure ===
The Miskito political structure has been profoundly shaped via its interactions with other cultures including Hispanicized Nicaragua as well as the British, acting on their perception of colonial power dynamics at any given time.

==== English influence ====
Beginning with the English arrival in the geographical area, the Miskito kingdom and political structure as a whole reflected the English political structure. The Miskito-English political dynamics would change with time but the two entities would remain operating in conjunction for approximately 250 years. Miskito kings were crowned by some of the first English settlers. Those recognized as kings by the British maintained the political structure as contact between mainland British and Miskitos increased.

Officially, the British government claimed political oversight of Miskito territory from 1740 to 1786—however, the British colonists inhabiting Miskito territory maintained the power dynamics established by the government even after their official evacuation. From 1860 to 1894, the Miskito Reserve period maintained centralized rule under a pro-British Miskito chief. Importantly, the Nicaraguan government recognized this leader as Hereditary Chief but granted him authority over land separate from Miskito-inhabited land. Thus, through the Miskito Reserve the Miskito people were granted autonomy&quot; but remained under the influence of a British political system through the designated chief.

The British ultimately largely failed in attempts to create fully functioning centralized political structures for the Miskito largely as a result of the heterogeneity within the Miskito population. However, their establishment of a singular political leader did allow that individual to gain favor with the British and allow for continued contact between the two societies.

==== 18th century self-rule in the Miskito kingdom ====
Despite the presence of the British political ideology of centralized power, the political structure in the Miskito kingdom proved more tribal in nature. Late seventeenth century accounts of the Miskito describe them as an &quot;egalitarian society&quot; that was &quot;sparsely populated.&quot; As the Miskito population grew over time, the political structure effectively transformed into autonomous regional chiefdoms with vaguely defined social classes. Leaders at the time would rule over a given number of villages, with their political power bound to their recognized villages. This structure served to limit any single Miskito king&#x27;s power over the Miskito as a whole, instead playing up the Miskito king&#x27;s role in interacting with the British.

==== Re-incorporation in the nineteenth century ====
According to Meringer, Miskito people enjoyed peak levels of autonomy in the nineteenth century after British colonists were forced out of the Mosquito Coast. The Miskito people themselves rose to power in the absence of the British, enjoying ethnic preeminence and little to no threats to their power. However, as the Honduran government began to become increasingly assertive in the region, the Miskito lost much of their officially recognized political power to African Creoles on representative governmental bodies. The Creoles would grow increasingly in power, overcoming the Miskito chief, and politically and culturally isolating the chief from the Miskito people at large. By the time of Re-incorporation, Miskito autonomy had already been threatened and substantially deconstructed by increases in Creole power.

Thus, during Re-incorporation, Nicaraguan government officials targeted Creole rulers rather than Miskito Indians. Later, Miskito took this opportunity to further Miskito autonomy and political authority in the region through a &quot;Decree of Re-incorporation&quot; which allowed representatives from the Miskito community to freely adhere to Nicaraguan laws and authorities while also granting Miskito people self-governance rights at the village level among other rights. This decree allowed previously marginalized Miskito to reclaim rights denied them by the ascendance of Creole elites earlier in the nineteenth century and allowed the population to unify.

==== Twentieth century mobilization ====
In response to the &quot;indigenismo&quot; policies adopted throughout Latin America in the twentieth century, the Miskito people organized through activism to advocate for policies promoting political, social, and cultural assimilation. Specifically for the Miskito people, the activism in response to indigenismo policies encompassed a movement promoting integration and civil rights. Prior to the notable activist movements of the 1980s, the Miskito prioritized integration into state political structures and civil rights under the liberal Nicaraguan constitution. The movements of the 1960s and 1970s proved largely integrationist and was led by completely separate leaders than those after the Sandinista Revolution.

As early as the 1950s, Miskitos worked to confront the large and small injustices their community faced. By integrating into the Nicaraguan state via land titles, the Miskito were able to participate in the larger economy of the country and hold the state accountable to their local interests. This larger political participation fed into the Miskito locales, affording local representatives more power regarding territorial disputes in general, allowing for increased political involvement from Miskitos not directly tied to political processes.

Regarding indigenismo, Nicaraguan officials viewed these policies as an opportunity to become more involved with the Mosquito Coast, which had previously been largely left alone. Miskito people were able to claim benefits at a larger governmental level that previously did not exist including technical training in medicine and agriculture, as well as increased access to education and more schoolhouses. For the Miskito in Nicaragua, indigenismo represented an opportunity to increase rapport with the government and greater access to previously inaccessible state resources rather than an affront to ethnic identity.

=== Gender relations ===
The Miskito people have maintained the same cultural traits that they acquired during the pre-colonial and colonial era. Contact with the English has created the position of a king who is seen as the figurehead of the tribes; however, the modern king has little power and generally does not affect the different tribes.

The gender roles within the Miskito culture are affected more by the &quot;boom and bust&quot; of the local economy than by any ruler. When there are few job opportunities men rely on agricultural work and they spend time within their respective communities. There is evidence that the society followed a patriarchal setup during these &quot;bust&quot; times; however, when the economy is &quot;booming&quot;, men generally get jobs that force them to travel. Since the 1990s men have been traveling as a result of an increase in job opportunities, and they spend significant amounts of time away from their villages.

Most men work on fishing boats diving for lobsters. Since men spend eight months out of the year away from their families, communities have a matrilocal arrangement. Typically men over age 13 are rarely present during daily life in a village.

Men are considered the breadwinners of a household and contribute the majority of a family’s income, but women have the ability to make all economic decisions. Some women do housekeeping or sell small crafts to make extra money, but it is not enough by itself to support a family. Girls inherit the right to settle on their mother’s land, and although men clear farmland, women have full ownership of it.

It is extremely difficult for women to find jobs, and most rely on men and their incomes to support their children. Many women practice &quot;magia amorosa&quot; (love magic), and they believe that it helps attract men and their money. This love magic can also be used to help save one’s marriage. Women have the greatest input in how their households are run, but they are unable to do anything without the money that their husbands provide. Love magic highlights the importance of keeping a man interested within Miskito society.

Women usually begin forming relationships at age 15, and most become mothers by 18. Most women have six to eight children with their husband, but since men are not around that often there are high abandonment and divorce rates. Men often feel no moral obligation to take care of children because of a high illegitimacy rate. Abandoned children are generally adopted by women within the child&#x27;s matrilocal group and taken care of by an aunt or grandmother. As women become older they also gain status within their community. In each society women who are respected elders, &quot;kukas&quot;, are considered local experts and enforcers of correct behavior in their village.

===Economy===

==== Pre-contact subsistence economy ====

Miskito oral tradition states that many centuries ago a tribe emigrated from northern South America and settled on the coast at a site called Sitawala – possibly near present-day Cabo Gracias a Dios. They were led by a warrior chief named Miskut, and called themselves the &quot;Miskut uplika nani&quot; (people of Miskut). The tradition states that neighboring tribes found it difficult to pronounce this name, and so shortened it to Miskito. After the death of Miskut, the tribe divided into three groups. One group ascended the Río Coco and became known as the river people. The other two groups moved north and south into present day Honduras and around present day Sandy Bay, Nicaragua. These people became known as the beach people.

The earliest European accounts of the Miskito are from Puritan colonists in 1633 and English and French buccaneers during the late 1600s-early 1700s. These early accounts claim that Miskito tribes ranged along the Caribbean coast from the Wawa River, south of present-day Bilwi, Nicaragua, to Cabo Camarón, Honduras. These early colonists, explorers and buccaneers described the Miskito as skilled maritime people adept a seafaring, fishing, and the hunting of turtle, manatee, as well as land animals such as deer.

Work conducted around Pearl Lagoon in Nicaragua by archaeologist Richard W. Magnus suggests that pre-contact coastal settlements were most likely temporary shellfish collection and salt manufacturing stations. Metates and other agricultural tools have been found in these coastal sites, however there is little evidence of permanent settlement, in-situ agriculture, nor specialized tools that would suggest adaptation to the marine environment. Furthermore, the lowland coastal soils are of poor agricultural quality and likely would not have supported permanent settlements. According to Magnus and others working in Honduran sites on the Río Tinto, these peoples were most likely riparian in nature. Archaeological sites inland show more signs of permanent settlement including house sites, animal/fish bones, hearths, and agricultural plots. It is suggested that these riverine people traveled temporarily to the coast to make salt and subsidize their agricultural diet with shellfish, but that their overall orientation was inland and not coastal . Despite a dearth of contact era reports, this theory of seasonal coastal migration is supported by the English buccaneer &quot;M.W.&quot; in 1732 who observed inland tribes who seasonally arrived at the coast to make salt before travelling back up river. Anthropologist Mary W. Helms and Geographer Bernard Nietschmann argue that the coastal orientation of the modern Miskito was precipitated by contact and subsequent social, economic and political involvement with Great Britain.

==== Post-contact mixed economy ====

===== Early trade and English buccaneers =====
The colony of Providence Island was established off the coast on present day Nicaragua by the English Providence Island Company in 1630, which precipitated the formation of settlements around 1633 on the Miskito Coast at Cabo Gracias a Dios, and further south at present day Bluefields, Nicaragua. The first known proto-Miskito contact with the English occurred around 1634 at the Cabo trading post.

The English regularly traded with the proto-Miskito for turtle shells, meat, lumber, hides, and other items in return, for beads, rum, clothing, food, livestock, and firearms. Many of these items were acquired by the coastal tribes through barter with inland tribes. As time passed, the proto-Miskito, in contrast to the inland peoples, mixed openly with the English and adopted some of their cultural traits, incorporating English words into their vocabulary and adopting European tools, food, clothing, and firearms – becoming the contact culture known today as the Miskito.

In addition to periodic trade, the Miskito were involved with English buccaneers of the 17th century. The buccaneers adopted Miskito communities as their bases and employed the Miskito in their cause. The buccaneers regularly employed local Miskito men to accompany them on their voyages as fishermen, hunters, navigators, and fighters. Through these experiences, the Miskito became adept raiders and raiding became a part of their local economy. With the support of the English and modern firearms, the Miskito expanded out of their cultural hearth near Cabo Gracias a Dios, and settled widely along the Miskito Coast. Following the decline of buccaneering at the end of the 17th century, many of the buccaneers turned to more legal ways of making money including cash crop production, and contraband. Sugar, Dye wood and contraband made up the majority of the local economy and wage labor became more common.

===== Balancing commercial and subsistence activities =====
The Miskito culture and economy is a product of intermixing between coastal indigenous tribes, European buccaneers, traders, and settlers and escaped slaves. The Moskito Coast, since colonial times, has been an economic frontier characterized by barter and boom/bust economies where markets develop to exploit specific resources, such as turtles, precious lumber, rubber, bananas, and logwood and collapse when the world market busts leaving little long-term development. As such, there has always been a commercial component to the economy, however, due to the inevitability of economic busts and their isolation from national powers, the Miskito have maintained their subsistence culture without being absorbed into the full-time market economy – what anthropologist Mary Helms refers to as a ‘purchase society’. A purchase society is a power dynamic in which the indigenous are not subjugated as peasants, but still interact with a merchant or elite class via trade – retaining their autonomy and identity.
The Miskito subsistence economy was based primarily on hunting, fishing, and some limited agriculture and silviculture. The nature of the economy was one of subsistence and reciprocity. Subsistence activities were traditionally divided by gender. Women tended to the agriculture, while the men cleared land, hunted, fished, and worked in wage labor when it was available. As Geographer Bernard Nietschmann highlights, there was a complex system of meat reciprocity which served as a sort of social security system for the society. If a hunter or fisherman was successful, they would gift some of the catch to their extended family and &#x27;sell&#x27; it to their friends with the expectation that the favor would be returned. Traditionally, there was a balance between subsistence and commercial activities. When commercial goods were in demand Miskito labor shifted towards commercial activities and subsistence activities were neglected. Upon the decline of the commercial activities, the Miskito fell back on their subsistence skills. However, the rise of the company economy precipitated a fundamental shift in the Miskito economy away from these short term/seasonal economic relationships to more regular long-term employment of contract wage labor and exploitation of communal resources for commercial gain. A major challenge to the Miskito system of meat reciprocity was the commercialization of the green sea turtle, a staple of the Miskito diet

The Miskito have hunted green turtles as part of their traditional subsistence economy since at least the contact era. Much of the Miskito subsistence system, and settlement patterns were based around the seasonal appearance of the green sea turtle. In the 17th century, the buccaneer William Dampier wrote that the Moskito Indians were &quot;esteemed and coveted by all privateers&quot; because of their skill at hunting turtle and manatee, &quot;for one or two of them [the animals] in a ship will maintain 100 men&quot;. The traditional method of capture was the harpoon. The harpoon was eight to ten feet in length and attached to a strong line. the turtle hunters traveled in small, seagoing canoes, using complex mental maps and systems of navigation to locate the turtles. A hunting party consisted of two men: a &quot;strikerman&quot; in the bow, and the &quot;captain&quot; in the stern. The hunters intercepted the turtles in the area between their sleeping shoals and feeding banks as they surfaced for air. After being harpooned, the turtle was capable of pulling a canoe along at high speeds until eventually tiring. The hunters could then pull the turtle alongside the canoe and kill it. Once killed, the turtle was returned to the community where the meat was divided among family and friends.

In general, no more turtles were hunted than could satisfy the community&#x27;s meat needs. However, increased demand from international markets during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries led to changes in hunting methods. The activities became market-focused instead of subsistence-focused. Foreign companies established commercial enterprises and hired Miskito turtlemen to facilitate intensive harvesting of green turtles to support sugar plantation labor, but also European palates. Exploitation was so intense that sea turtle populations in the greater Caribbean basin had been decimated by the mid-1800s, and villagers were confronted with rising social tensions due to increased dependence on a scarce resource. In the present day, sea turtle populations have recovered to a point, but the Miskito now balance a desire for turtle products with the forces of local, national, and international conservation goals.

===== The company period =====
The establishment of European control, and later American hegemony on the Miskito Coast opened up the region for foreign business interests and the introduction of wage labor. The period between the turn of the 20th century and the 1960s became known as the company period, and was defined by large foreign enterprises, company run communities, and wage labor in the extraction of natural resources. During this time, lumbering of mahogany and other valuable trees, cash cropping of sugar and other products, which had existed in reduced form since the 17th century, expanded into large commercial enterprises. In terms of lumber, companies hired Miskito men to find, cut, and deliver desirable trees or tree products to the coast where they were then exported to Europe or the United States. By the end of the 1800s, lumber and rubber were major employers of male Miskito labor and foreign investment was high. The effects of this influx of money could be seen in the Miskito community of Bilwi.

Prior to 1921, the community of Bilwi (Puerto Cabezas), Nicaragua was little more than a small fishing village, but starting in this year a consortium of business from the United States, including the Bragman’s Bluff Lumber and Fruit Company, and Standard Fruit began developing the community into their base of operation and main export port. The companies together outfitted the community with a lumber mill, pier and port facilities, and a regional railroad system for the extraction of lumber and bananas. By 1926 Bragman’s Bluff Lumber was the largest employer in Nicaragua, with over 2000 workers. Pine lumbering persisted with periodic booms and busts through the 1960s. Bragman’s Lumber recorded its largest shipment of lumber at Bilwi in 1960 with just over 28.4 million linear board feet.

The other major boom market for this period was in bananas. The banana boom, with its plantation employment, lasted from the 1890s −1930s – peaking in the 1931. At the port of Bilwi, Standard Fruit recorded it all-time high production of 6.1 million &quot;racimos&quot; (clusters) in 1931. As a result of economic depression in the United States, and a soil fungus outbreak, the banana economy quickly busted. By the end of WWII exports at Bilwi were down to 99,685 racimos and by 1960 the number was down to 9,753. Gold-mining and pine lumbering also began in the late 1800s and persisted with periodic booms and busts through the 1960s. Seafood, including shrimp and lobster, has been the most recent boom market in the region since the 1970s.

Overall, the company period was known for its boom and bust economies. Massive hirings during economic upswings were followed by massive layoffs. During boom times, skilled and unskilled workers would flood into town, only to return to their homes after the price of lumber, bananas, or ores dropped leaving ghost towns, and abandoned infrastructure. During the company period, it was common for the Miskito men to leave their communities and families for up to a year at a time, to work in the various industries. They would send back money as replacement for the subsistence goods that they would have traditionally produced. Without their husbands and male family members, the women were increasingly forced to purchase food (especially meat) on the cash market and hire farm hands to clear and tend agricultural plots. This employment dynamic led to the large-scale introduction of the money-based economy, and the replacement of subsistence goods with relatively inexpensive commissary goods. This shift created a dependency on commercial goods and cash earning employment.

=====The lobster economy and controversy=====

====== The industry ======

Increasing demand in the United States led to a boom in commercial exploitation of spiny lobster along the Moskito Coast beginning in the 1970s. Lobster, like products of past booms, has become a major source of cash income for the Miskito and the great majority of the population either directly or indirectly depends on lobster income. In 2011, the industry employed around 3500 people on 44 boats in Honduras alone. In Nicaragua, it has been estimated that commercial lobster diving employs over 5,000 people and affects the livelihoods of 50,000 men, women and children. Many of these people work as divers, using scuba equipment to dive and catch lobster.

The vast majority of fishing operations are controlled by ladino boat owners based in the Bay Islands of Honduras and Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. These owners employ local recruiters or &quot;sacabuzos&quot; in coastal communities to organize crews of dive teams, as well as other boat hands. A dive team consists of a diver and &quot;cayuquero&quot;; a diver apprentices who follows the diver in a canoe allowing the diver to offload his catch. In addition to 18–20 dive teams, a boat employs additional support staff to cook, clean, and manage the diving equipment.

At the beginning of a fishing trip, the lobster boats travel the coast picking up recruited dive teams and boat hands. They then search for lobster at known lobster banks between Honduras and Colombia, often illegally and usually over the course of 12–16 days. The divers are paid by the pound for lobster tails alone. In the early days of the boom, lobster tails of 1–2 pound were common whereas by the early 1990s a diver needed 2–3 lobsters to make the same weight. At that time, the average diver brought in, per trip, 150–180 pounds of lobster. By 2011 the estimated average was down to 74 pounds/trip. Following the catch, the boats return the crew members to their communities, and the catch is processed in the Bay Islands or Puerto Cabezas before being shipped to primarily the United States.

====== Controversy ======

Since the 1960s, the Miskito have used free-diving techniques to harvest lobsters as their primary source of income. In the early years of the lobster boom, large and plentiful lobster were found close to shore in shallow waters, and could be accessed easily by free-diving. Lobster production peaked, however, around 1985, and these resources were quickly depleted. Scuba diving techniques were introduced around 1980 to enable the Miskito to expand their area for harvesting into deeper waters. Declining returns have forced divers to dive more often, deeper, and for longer, using pressurized tanks to maintain their income. In response to declining lobster populations, the governments of Honduras and Nicaragua implemented a fishing season – restricting lobster exploitation to between 1 March and 30 July. The goal was to reduce pressure on lobster populations, but the result has also increased pressure on lobster divers. It is not uncommon for divers to make 12–16 dives per day to depths of 100–120 ft. in an effort to maintain their incomes. The result has been an increase in the number of cases of decompression sickness and decompression related deaths. Around 2013, Honduras had the highest number of decompression related deaths and sickness in the world. Estimates at that time put the number of injured somewhere over 2000, while over 300 others have died since the 1970s. The divers almost universally lack formal dive training, and the push to maintain their incomes leads divers to dive too much and stay down too long. In response to activist outcries, several large lobster importers in the United States announced in 2015 that they will no longer purchase dive caught lobster, however, similar efforts by Red Lobster in 1993 failed to disrupt the industry. In 2009 both Honduras and Nicaragua agreed on regional regulations to prohibit lobster diving. Regional agreement OSP-02-2009 – &quot;Reglamento para el Ordenamiento Regional de la Pesquería de Langonsta del Caribe&quot; was signed by the nations of Central America on 21 May 2009 and was to prohibit tank assisted lobster diving within two years. These regulations, however, have not been enforced, partly because of political pressure from the fishing industry and a lack of viable economic alternatives in on the Miskito Coast. In a 2011 census of Honduran lobster divers, 36% of injured divers continued to dive after their first accident and 50% of divers had considered quitting due to the risks, but continued, because of the lack of viable economic alternatives.

The 2012 documentary film &quot;My Village, My Lobster&quot; examines the individuals and communities involved in this fishing industry. The film features testimony from divers who have been injured, boat owners and captains who are responsible for the divers&#x27; safety, and a hyperbaric medicine specialist who treats injured divers. The film includes footage from aboard a commercial lobster diving vessel and from the remote Miskito Keys (or Miskito Cays), the noted turtle-hunting grounds of the Miskito.

<doc id="675789" wikidata="Q1455930" url="?curid=675789" title="Parental Advisory">
<text>Parental Advisory (short for Parental Advisory: Explicit Content/Lyrics) is a warning label placed on audio recordings that contain explicit content, such as profanity, violence, or sexual content/references. It was introduced by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1987 and adopted by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) in 2011. The label was first affixed on physical 33 rpm records, compact discs and cassette tapes, and it has been included on digital listings offered by online music stores. In PAL-region territories, some video games featuring licensed music were affixed with the label in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Recordings with the Parental Advisory label are often released alongside an uncut censored version that reduces, eliminates or replaces the objectionable material. Several retailers will distribute both versions of the product, occasionally with an increased price for the uncut censored version, while some sellers offer the amended pressing as their main option and choose not to distribute the explicit counterpart. The label has been widely criticized as ineffective in limiting the inappropriate material to which young audiences are exposed.

== Background ==

Shortly after their formation in April 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) assembled a list of fifteen songs with deemed unsuitable content. Particular criticism was placed on &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; by Prince, after PMRC co-founder Mary &quot;Tipper&quot; Gore bought the album &quot;Purple Rain&quot; for her 11-year-old daughter Karenna, unaware that the song&#x27;s lyrics included an explicit mention of masturbation. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) responded by introducing an early version of their content warning label, although the PMRC was displeased and proposed that a music rating system structured like the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system be enacted. The RIAA alternatively suggested using a warning label reading &quot;Parental Guidance: Explicit Lyrics&quot;, and after continued conflict between the organizations, the matter was discussed on September 19 during a hearing with the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. Notable musicians Frank Zappa, Dee Snider, and John Denver each testified at this hearing with strong opposition to PMRC&#x27;s warning label system, and censorship in general. Approximately two months after the hearing, the organizations agreed on a settlement in which audio recordings were to either be affixed with a warning label reading &quot;Explicit Lyrics: Parental Advisory&quot; or have its lyrics attached on the backside of its packaging.

In 1990, the now standard black-and-white warning label design reading &quot;Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics&quot; was introduced and was to be placed on the bottom right-hand section of a given product. The first album to bear the &quot;black and white&quot; Parental Advisory label was the 1990 release of &quot;Banned in the U.S.A.&quot; by the rap group 2 Live Crew. By May 1992, approximately 225 records had been marked with the warning. In response to later hearings in the following years, it was reworded as &quot;Parental Advisory: Explicit Content&quot; in 1996. The system went unchanged until 2002, when record labels affiliated with Bertelsmann began including specific areas of concern including &quot;strong language&quot;, &quot;violent content&quot;, or &quot;sexual content&quot; on compact discs alongside the generic Parental Advisory label. The Parental Advisory label was first used on music streaming services and online music stores in 2011. That year, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) revised its own music censorship policies to incorporate more prominent usage of the warning label.

== Application ==
The &quot;Parental Advisory Label Program&quot; in the United States and the &quot;Parental Advisory Scheme&quot; in the United Kingdom lack agreed-upon standards for using the warning label, although they provide guidelines for its recommended inclusion. Although a voluntary practice that is ultimately left to the discretion of record labels, the RIAA suggests that material with &quot;strong language or depictions of violence, sex, or substance abuse to such an extent as to merit parental notification&quot; be affixed with the Parental Advisory label. The BPI additionally requests that &quot;racist, homophobic, misogynistic or other discriminatory language or behavior&quot; be taken under consideration when determining the appropriateness of a record.

Physical copies of albums which have the label generally have it as a permanent part of the artwork, being printed with the rest of the cover. In some cases, the label is affixed as a sticker to the front of the case, which can be removed by putting the artwork in a different case. Audio recordings that include Parental Advisory labels in their original formats are generally released in censored versions that reduce or completely eliminate the questionable material. They are recognized as &quot;clean&quot; editions by the RIAA, and are left unlabeled in their revised formats. Target has sold both versions of a given record. Walmart and their affiliated properties are well known for only carrying censored versions of records; in one instance, the retailer refused to distribute Green Day&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;21st Century Breakdown&quot; because they were not given the &quot;clean&quot; copies that they requested. Online music stores, including the iTunes Store, generally have the Parental Advisory logo embedded into digital files. Digital retailers and streaming services such as iTunes, Spotify, and Amazon Music flag tracks as &#x27;Explicit&#x27; if they have been identified as such.

== Impact ==
Since its introduction, the effectiveness of the Parental Advisory label has frequently been called into question. Jon Wiederhorn from &quot;MTV News&quot; suggested that artists benefited from the label and noted that younger customers interested in explicit content could more easily find it with a label attached. On behalf of &quot;Westword&quot;, Andy Thomas said that the label was purposeless on the grounds that a young customer &quot;would get a copy of the album sooner or later from a friend or another lethargic record store clerk&quot; like the cashier that sold him a labeled pressing of &quot;La Sexorcisto: Devil Music, Vol. 1&quot; (1992) by White Zombie in his childhood. He noted that its intended reaction in parents was varied; his lax mother was indifferent towards the warning, while the stricter mother of his companion did not allow her child to listen to the record.

Danny Goldberg from Gold Village Entertainment opined that the Parental Advisory label offered minimal value other than &quot;being a way for certain retailers like Wal-Mart to brand themselves as &#x27;family friendly&#x27;&quot;; he felt that children were successful in getting content they desired &quot;even before the Internet&quot;, and believed that the label had little impact on sales figures. In contrast, the RIAA maintains that &quot;it&#x27;s not a PAL Notice that kids look for, it&#x27;s the music&quot;. They stated that research they had gathered revealed that &quot;kids put limited weight on lyrics in deciding which music they like, caring more about rhythm and melody&quot; and implied that the label is not a deciding factor for a given purchase. Tom Cole from NPR commented that the Parental Advisory label has become &quot;a fact of music-buying life&quot;, which made it difficult for current consumers to understand the widespread controversy that came about from its introduction. Greg Beato of &quot;Reason&quot; observed that by the 1990s, &quot;A hip-hop album that didn&#x27;t warrant a Tipper sticker was artistically suspect.&quot;

The label has become well known enough to be parodied. Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27;s 1991 albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;Use Your Illusion II&quot; included a similarly-styled sticker saying &quot;This album contains language which some listeners may find objectionable. They can F!?* OFF and buy something from the New Age section.&quot;

== Edited counterparts ==
It is fairly common for an album which received the Parental Advisory seal to be sold alongside an &quot;edited&quot; version which removes objectionable content, usually to the same level as a radio edit. The RIAA Guidelines however state &quot;an Edited Version need not remove all potentially objectionable content from the sound recording.&quot; These albums are packaged nearly-identically to their explicit counterparts, usually with the only indicator being the lack of Parental Advisory seal, although if the artwork is deemed &#x27;explicit&#x27; too, it will normally be censored. In the case of some albums, a black box reading &quot;EDITED VERSION&quot; is placed where the Parental Advisory seal would be. This was part of new guidelines introduced on April 1, 2002, which also included a label that featured &quot;Edited Version Also Available&quot; next to the Parental Advisory seal.

<doc id="675790" wikidata="Q1067125" url="?curid=675790" title="Teen Wolf">
<text>Teen Wolf is a 1985 American coming-of-age comedy film directed by Rod Daniel and written by Jeph Loeb and Matthew Weisman. Michael J. Fox stars as the title character, a high school student whose ordinary life is changed when he discovers that he is a werewolf. James Hampton, Scott Paulin, Susan Ursitti, Jerry Levine, Matt Adler, and Jay Tarses appear in supporting roles. Filming took place from November to December 1984.

&quot;Teen Wolf&quot; was released on August 23, 1985, by Atlantic Releasing Corporation, and received mixed reviews from film critics. It was a commercial success, grossing over $33 million domestically on a $4 million budget, with the worldwide gross being over $80 million. The film&#x27;s success spawned a titular franchise, including an animated series adaptation in 1986, a sequel film in 1987, the supernatural live action drama series that aired on MTV from 2011 to 2017, and its continuation film in 2023.

==Plot==
Scott Howard, a 17-year-old high school student, lives in a small town in Nebraska. His only claim to popularity is playing for the Beavers, his school&#x27;s winless, unsuccessful basketball team. Scott fawns after Pamela Wells even though she is dating his rival Mick who plays for the Dragons, a dominant opposing team that bullies him on the court and beat them by a landslide. Completely oblivious to the affections of his childhood friend Boof, Scott constantly rebuffs her advances due to their history together.

After startling changes such as long hair suddenly sprouting on his hands and chest, he decides to quit the team, but his coach, Finstock, changes his mind. Scoring a keg with his best friends, Stiles and Lewis, for a party, Scott and Boof end up alone in a closet and Scott gets rough when they begin making out, accidentally clawing her back. When he returns home, he undergoes a strange transformation, discovering he is a werewolf. His father Harold reveals he is one too, and that he had hoped Scott would not inherit the curse because &#x27;sometimes it skips a generation&#x27;. The next morning, Harold tells Scott that being a werewolf will be manageable for him and that he can still live a normal life.

Scott reveals his secret to Stiles, who agrees to keep it a secret. But, when Scott becomes stressed on the court, he becomes the Wolf and helps win their first game in three years. As a result, Scott gains fame and popularity as the high school is overwhelmed with &#x27;Wolf Fever&#x27;. He is also alienated from Boof and his friend Lewis, who is scared of him now. The basketball team goes on a winning streak, but his teammates now resent him as he begins to hog the ball during games.

Stiles merchandises &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; paraphernalia and Pamela finally begins paying attention to Scott. After he gets a role as a &quot;werewolf cavalryman&quot; in the school play alongside her, she comes onto him in the dressing room and they have sex. Later, after a date set up to make Mick jealous, Pamela tells Scott that she is not interested in him as a boyfriend, much to his disappointment. Harold tells Scott he is responsible for his son&#x27;s conflicts with vice principal Rusty Thorne, due to a scare Harold had given him when he was in high school while protecting his girlfriend/future wife. He advises Scott to be himself and to not abuse the powers being a wolf gives him.

Boof agrees to go with Scott to the upcoming Spring Dance, but only if he goes as himself. Scott goes alone as the Wolf instead. She takes him into the hallway and they kiss, which turns Scott back into himself. When they return to the dance, Scott garners everyone&#x27;s attention, including Pamela. A jealous Mick punches him in the face, then proceeds to insult Boof and taunt Scott until the Wolf angrily attacks. Horrified by his loss of control, as well as seeing his friends scared, Scott runs out of the hall right into Thorne, who threatens expulsion. Harold sends his son home before going on to intimidate Thorne by growling in his face, causing the vice principal to wet himself.

Scott renounces using the Wolf and plans to quit the basketball team. He apologizes to Boof and assures her that he is done relying on the Wolf to succeed. During the championship game, he arrives to rally his teammates to play without the Wolf. Despite the odds, the team begins to work together and they make ground against the Dragons. During the final quarter, behind by one point, Scott is fouled hard by Mick at the buzzer. He makes both free throws, winning the championship. Brushing past Pamela, he kisses Boof as his father embraces them both. Mick tells Pamela that they should leave, but she tells him to &quot;drop dead&quot; and storms off while everyone else celebrates the victory.

==Cast==

==Production==
&quot;Teen Wolf&quot; was one of the first scripts written by Jeph Loeb. Loeb was hired to write it because the studio, after the surprising success of the film &quot;Valley Girl&quot;, wanted to make a comedy that would cost almost nothing and take very little time to film. The project came together when Michael J. Fox accepted the lead role and his &quot;Family Ties&quot; co-star Meredith Baxter-Birney became pregnant, which created a delay in the sitcom&#x27;s filming that allowed Fox time to complete filming and then return to his sitcom.

On a production budget of $4 million, principal photography for &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; began in November 1984 and concluded the next month. James Hampton originally auditioned for the role of Coach Bobby Finstock but was later cast as Harold Howard. The beaver mascot logo used in the film was the Oregon State University Beavers logo, in use by the university at that time.

==Release==
Atlantic Releasing spent $4 million on advertising for &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;. Released in the U.S. on August 23, 1985, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; debuted at No. 2 in its opening weekend, behind &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (also starring Michael J. Fox). After its initial run, the film grossed $33,086,661 domestically, with a worldwide gross of about $80 million.

&quot;Teen Wolf&quot; was first released on DVD via MGM in a &quot;Double Feature&quot; pack with its sequel &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot; on August 27, 2002. The film was later released on Blu-ray on March 29, 2011. The only special feature available on any of the releases is the film&#x27;s theatrical trailer. The film was reissued on Blu-ray Disc on August 8, 2017, by Scream! Factory, with a remastered transfer and a new &quot;making of&quot; featurette.

==Critical response==
The film&#x27;s critical reception was mixed. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 46% of 35 critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.4 out of 10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Though Michael J. Fox is as charismatic as ever, &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;″s coming-of-age themes can&#x27;t help but feel a little stale and formulaic.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a 25 out of 100 rating based on 5 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review calling it &quot;aggressively boring&quot;. He went on to say that &quot;the film is overacted by everybody except Mr. Fox, who is seen to far better advantage in &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.&quot;

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #75, and stated that &quot;Anxious that their movie should be perfectly wholesome, clean and bloodless, writers and director forgot Scott was supposed to be a werewolf, and made him a basketball star instead.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Animated television series===

An animated series adaptation aired on CBS for two seasons from 1986 to 1987. Townsend Coleman voiced the lead role of Scott Howard, with James Hampton reprising his role as Harold Howard. The series retained the basic premise and most of the characters from the film, but made changes to the story, such as Scott attempting to keep his werewolf identity secret from the general public. It also featured new characters, including Scott&#x27;s grandparents (voiced by Stacy Keach Sr. and June Foray) and younger sister Lupe.

===Sequels===

A sequel entitled &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot; was released in 1987 and starred Jason Bateman as Todd Howard, Scott Howard&#x27;s cousin. Only James Hampton and Mark Holton returned from the original film, with the sequel focusing mostly on new characters led by Todd. &quot;Teen Wolf Too&quot; received negative reviews and failed to match the success of its predecessor, grossing $7.9 million on a $3 million budget. A second sequel starring Alyssa Milano was planned, but never filmed. Another female version of &quot;Teen Wolf&quot; was in the works that later developed into 1989&#x27;s &quot;Teen Witch&quot;.

===Live-action television series===

MTV greenlit a television series adaptation in 2009 that was developed by Jeff Davis. While also centered on a high school student who becomes a werewolf, the story was reimagined as a supernatural teen drama with elements of action and horror. Tyler Posey portrayed the title character, whose name was changed to Scott McCall for the series. It aired for six seasons from 2011 to 2017. A film continuation, &quot;Teen Wolf: The Movie&quot;, was released on January 26, 2023.

<text>Putumayo World Music is a New Orleans-based record label that specializes in compilations of world music, jazz and blues.

==History==
Dan Storper founded Putumayo in 1975 as a retail store in New York City featuring handicrafts from around the world. Storper took the name of his company, Putumayo, from Colombia&#x27;s Putumayo River Valley where he travelled in 1974. &quot;Putumayo&quot; is said to mean a heron and &quot;the place where the river begins&quot; in the local indigenous language. He eventually opened 7 world handicraft and clothing boutiques across the northeastern United States. In 1991, on his way home from Bali, Storper stopped in San Francisco, California. In Golden Gate Park, he heard the Nigerian band Kotoja. He was impressed by the music and started compiling international music to play in his stores. The response from the public was so positive that, in 1993, he launched Putumayo World Music and began offering compilations for sale.

Every release features the art of Nicola Heindl. Her art is both folky and modern, and, according to the Putumayo website, &quot;represents one of Putumayo&#x27;s goals: to connect the traditional to the contemporary.&quot;

==Putumayo Presents==
Typically a Putumayo World Music compilation is presented as a theme under the title “Putumayo Presents”. The themes can be regional (South Africa, Caribbean, Asia), music styles (reggae, folk, Latin, jazz) and other themes (lounge, groove, party). All albums in the series from 1993 to early 2000 were released on both CD and cassette, with &quot;Republica Dominicana&quot; being the last album released on cassette.

The Putumayo Kids division was created in 2002. Since the release of the &quot;World Playground&quot; CD in 1999, Putumayo Kids music collections have received over 20 Parents&#x27; Choice Awards among other accolades.

Putumayo launched the &quot;Putumayo World Music Hour&quot; in 2000, a commercially syndicated world music radio show. Rosalie Howarth of KFOG hosts the &quot;Music Hour&quot;. The weekly show is heard internationally on over 100 commercial and non-commercial stations.

In 2011, Putumayo developed a series of cultural coloring books. Beginning in 2017, Putumayo began distributing multicultural books and activity sets in partnership with publisher Barefoot Books. That same year, Putumayo started a series of world greeting card collections that have featured international folk art and photography by illustrator Nicola Heindl, photographer Emerson Matabele, Brazilian block print artist José Francisco Borges, Louisiana Folk Artist William Hemmerling, London artist Christopher Corr and Louisiana painter George Rodrigue.

Putumayo&#x27;s products are sold at a network of thousands of book, gift, clothing, coffee and other specialty retailers around the world.

Many of Putumayo music collections are now available for digital download and streaming. In 2020, the company launched an ongoing series of themed streaming playlists.

<text>Last Action Hero is a 1993 American fantasy action comedy film directed and produced by John McTiernan and co-written by Shane Black and David Arnott. It is a satire of the action genre and associated clichés, containing several parodies of action films in the form of films within the film. The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater, a Los Angeles police detective within the &quot;Jack Slater&quot; action film franchise, while Austin O&#x27;Brien co-stars as Danny Madigan, a boy magically transported into the &quot;Slater&quot; universe, and Charles Dance as Mr. Benedict, a ruthless assassin from the &quot;Slater&quot; universe who escapes to the real world. Schwarzenegger also served as the film&#x27;s executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater. The film also marked Art Carney and Tina Turner&#x27;s last feature film before their deaths in 2003 and 2023, respectively.

&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; failed to meet the studio&#x27;s expectations at the box office, and was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Since its release &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; gained a cult following, with some noting it as underrated in Schwarzenegger&#x27;s catalogue.

==Plot==

Ten-year-old Danny Madigan lives in a crime-ridden area of New York City with his widowed mother, Irene. Following his father&#x27;s death, Danny takes comfort in watching action movies, especially a series featuring Los Angeles cop Jack Slater at a condemned movie theatre owned by Nick. Nick gives Danny a golden ticket once owned by Harry Houdini and invites him to watch &quot;Jack Slater IV&quot;.

During the film, the ticket stub transports Danny into the fictional world, interrupting Slater during a car chase. Slater takes Danny to the LAPD headquarters, where Danny points out evidence of the fictional nature of Slater&#x27;s world, such as the presence of numerous attractive women and a cartoon cat detective named Whiskers. Danny says that Slater&#x27;s friend John Practice should not be trusted as he &quot;killed Mozart&quot; (since he is played by the same actor as Antonio Salieri in &quot;Amadeus&quot;). Though Slater dismisses this as Danny&#x27;s imagination, Slater&#x27;s supervisor, Lieutenant Dekker, assigns Danny as his partner and instructs them to investigate criminal activities related to mafia boss Tony Vivaldi.
Danny guides Slater to Vivaldi&#x27;s mansion, recognising its location from the start of the movie. There, they meet Vivaldi&#x27;s henchman, Mr. Benedict. Vivaldi and Benedict killed Slater&#x27;s second cousin, but Slater has no evidence and is forced to leave with Danny; however, Benedict is curious as to how Danny knew, and he and several hired guns follow Slater and Danny back to Slater&#x27;s home. There, Slater, his daughter Whitney, and Danny thwart the attack, though Benedict gets the ticket stub and discovers that it can transport him into the real world.

Slater deduces Vivaldi&#x27;s plan to murder the rival mob by releasing a lethal gas. He and Danny go to stop it but are waylaid by Practice, who reveals that Danny was right: he is working for Vivaldi. Whiskers kills Practice, saving Slater and Danny, who prevent any deaths from the gas release. After Vivaldi&#x27;s plan fails, Benedict kills him and uses the stub to escape into the real world, pursued by Slater and Danny.

Slater becomes despondent upon learning the truth but cheers up after spending time with Irene. Meanwhile, Benedict devises a plan to kill the actor portraying Slater in the movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger, bring other movie villains into the real world, and take over. To help, Benedict brings the Ripper, the villain of &quot;Jack Slater III&quot;, to &quot;Jack Slater IV&quot;&#x27;s premiere to assassinate Schwarzenegger. Slater saves Schwarzenegger and kills the Ripper. Benedict shoots Slater, critically injuring him. Danny disarms Benedict, allowing Slater to shoot Benedict in his explosive glass eye, killing him; however, the blast causes the stub to be lost. With Slater losing blood, Danny knows the only way to save him is to return him to the fictional world, where his injury will become a flesh wound.

The ticket stub falls in front of a theatre playing &quot;The Seventh Seal,&quot; where &quot;The Figure of Death&quot; emerges from the screen. Death is curious: Jack Slater is missing from his lists of when people will die, and Danny is slated to die as a grandfather. Death then suggests searching for the other half of the ticket. Danny finds it and takes Slater back into his movie, where his wounds instantly heal. Danny returns to the real world before the portal closes. A recovered Slater then embraces the true nature of his reality, appreciating the differences between the two worlds. Danny and Nick bond while reminiscing their past, while Slater drives away on the screen, waving goodbye.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; was an original screenplay by Zak Penn and Adam Leff, meant to parody typical action-film screenplays of writers such as Shane Black. Penn himself noted that the studio ironically then had Black rewrite the script. The original screenplay differs heavily from the finished film and is widely available to read online. Although it was still a parody of Hollywood action films, it was set almost entirely in the film world and focused largely on the futile cycle of violence displayed by the hero and the effect it had on people around him. Due to the radical changes, Penn and Leff were eventually credited with the story of the film, but not the screenplay.

Several script doctors did uncredited work on the script, including Carrie Fisher, Larry Ferguson, and William Goldman. Penn and Leff disliked various parts of the final film, including the idea of a magic golden ticket. In their draft, the story would not explain how Danny got transported into the film world.

John McTiernan originally turned down the offer to direct the film, Robert Zemeckis was under consideration to direct, but McTiernan later changed his mind.

Schwarzenegger received a salary of $15 million for his role in the film.

Some scenes were filmed in a dome adjacent to the RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in Long Beach, California. The exterior of the film&#x27;s Pandora Theater was the Empire Theater on 42nd Street in New York. The interiors were filmed at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles.

Years after its release, the film was the subject of a scathing chapter called &quot;How They Built The Bomb&quot;, in the Nancy Griffin book &quot;Hit and Run&quot; which detailed misadventures at Sony Pictures in the early to mid-1990s. Among the details presented in this chapter were:

* Universal moved &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; to June 11, 1993, well after Sony had decided on a June 18 release date for &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;. 
* The movie was reportedly the first to have an advertisement placed on a space-going rocket. 
* The film was capsized by a wave of negative publicity after a rough cut of it was shown to a preview audience in May. Sony then destroyed the test cards and the word-of-mouth proved to be catastrophic for the film.
* The shooting and editing schedule were so demanding and so close to the June 18 release date that after the movie&#x27;s release, a source close to the film said that they &quot;shouldn&#x27;t have had Siskel and Ebert telling us the movie is 10 minutes too long&quot;.
* Sony was even more humiliated the weekend after the film opened, when the movie lost 47% of its opening-weekend audience and had TriStar&#x27;s &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; open as the number-two movie at the box office.
* The final declared financial loss for the film was $26 million.
* &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; was the first film to be released using Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, but only a few theaters were set up for the new format, and many of those experienced technical problems with the new system. Insiders at Paramount reportedly referred to it as &quot;Still Doesn&#x27;t Do Shit&quot;.

==Music==

The film was scored by composer Michael Kamen and peaked at No. 7 on The Billboard 200 chart. The album, which was positively received by active rock radio outlets, was certified platinum on August 24, 1993.

==Release==
===Theatrical===
At the time of its release, the film was billed as &quot;the next great summer action movie&quot; and many movie insiders predicted it would be a huge blockbuster, especially following the success of Schwarzenegger&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. The film premiered in Westwood, Los Angeles on June 13, 1993, and entered general release in the United States five days later. It introduced the 1993 Columbia Pictures logo.

===Home media===
&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc on January 26, 1994, and on DVD on October 7, 1997. On February 3, 2009, &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; was reissued on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in a double-feature set with the 1986 film &quot;Iron Eagle&quot;. It was released on the high-definition Blu-ray Disc format on January 12, 2010. The film double-featured with &quot;Hudson Hawk&quot; on Blu-ray and released by Umbrella Entertainment on September 4, 2019, in Australia only. An Ultra HD Blu-ray restored version was released on May 18, 2021, and featured a director&#x27;s commentary track, deleted scenes, an alternative ending, and the original theatrical trailer, all in 4K. The film was re-released with &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; in a 2-Movie Collection Blu-ray pack on November 2, 2021.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed approximately $1.1 million in previews on the evening of Thursday, June 17, 1993, and opened at number two at the US box office, behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;″s second weekend, grossing $14.2 million on its opening weekend from 2,306 theaters. It ended its run with $50,016,394 in the United States and Canada. The film was released in the United Kingdom on July 30, 1993, on 266 screens and again opened at number two behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; (on 435 screens) with a gross of $1.34 million for the weekend. In France it opened at number one with a gross of 21 million French franc ($3.6 million) in its opening week. It grossed $87,202,095 overseas, for a worldwide total of $137,298,489. In an A&amp;E biography of Schwarzenegger, the actor (who was also the film&#x27;s executive producer) says that the film could have done better if not for bad timing, since it came out a week after &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; which went on to break box-office records as one of the top-grossing films of all time.

Schwarzenegger states that he tried to persuade his coproducers to postpone the film&#x27;s June 18 release in the United States by four weeks, but they turned a deaf ear on the grounds that the film would have lost millions of dollars in revenue for every weekend of the summer it ended up missing, also fearing that delaying the release would create negative publicity. He told the authors of &quot;Hit And Run&quot; that while everyone involved with the production had given their best effort, their attempt to appeal to both action and comedy fans resulted in a film that appealed to neither audience and ultimately succumbed to heavy competition.

===Critical response===

&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 40% based on 53 reviews and an average rating of 5.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; has most of the right ingredients for a big-budget action spoof, but its scattershot tone and uneven structure only add up to a confused, chaotic mess.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 44 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, writing that despite some entertaining moments, &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; &quot;plays more like a bright idea than like a movie that was thought through. It doesn&#x27;t evoke the mystery of the barrier between audience and screen the way Woody Allen did in &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot;, and a lot of the time it simply seems to be standing around commenting on itself.&quot; 
Vincent Canby likened the film to &quot;a two-hour &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch&quot; and called it &quot;something of a mess, but a frequently enjoyable one&quot;.
Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; makes such a strenuous show of winking at the audience (and itself) that it seems to be celebrating nothing so much as its own awfulness. In a sense, the movie&#x27;s incipient commercial failure completes it aesthetically.&quot; 
&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a joyless, soulless machine of a movie, an $80 million-plus mishmash of fantasy, industry in-jokes, self-referential parody, film-buff gags and too-big action set-pieces.&quot; &quot;Halliwell&#x27;s Film Guide&quot; described it as &quot;a film that tries to have it both ways, simultaneously mocking and celebrating the conventions of action movies, which leaves audiences, as well as the actors and director, in a state of bewildered confusion&quot;. John Ferguson of &quot;Radio Times&quot; was more positive, awarding it four stars out of five and stating, &quot;An Arnold Schwarzenegger backlash had been on the cards for some time and when this extravaganza was released the knives were well and truly out. It was actually all a little unfair, because this is a smart, funny blockbuster [...] Schwarzenegger has rarely been better and he is backed up by a never-ending stream of star names in cameo roles [...] And, although McTiernan has fun spoofing the conventions of the action genre, he still manages to slip in some spectacular set pieces.&quot;

===Legacy===
About the film&#x27;s failure and critical response, John McTiernan said: Initially, it was a wonderful Cinderella story with a nine-year-old boy. We had a pretty good script by Bill Goldman, charming. And this ludicrous hype machine got hold of it, and it got buried under bullshit. It was so overwhelmed with baggage. And then it was whipped out unedited, practically assembled right out of the camera. It was in the theater five or six weeks after I finished shooting. It was kamikaze, stupid, no good reason for it. And then to open the week after &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;—God! To get to the depth of bad judgment involved in that, you&#x27;d need a snorkel. Later Schwarzenegger blamed the film&#x27;s poor performance on bad press and the election of Democratic president Bill Clinton, which he said influenced audiences to see 1980s action film stars as lowbrow. In 2017, he said streaming services gave the film its chance to reach new audiences unencumbered by the bad press. In Netflix&#x27;s three-part docuseries &quot;Arnold&quot; (released in 2023), the actor recalled how the failure of the movie affected him. &quot;When &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; came out I had reached my peak after &quot;Terminator 2&quot;, having the most successful movie of the year worldwide, I cannot tell you how upset that I was [about the negative &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; reviews]. It hurts you. It hurts your feelings. It&#x27;s embarrassing. I didn&#x27;t want to see anyone for a week but you keep plodding along.&quot; Director James Cameron said that he had called Schwarzenegger the weekend after &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; opened and recalled that it was the only time he&#x27;s &quot;ever heard him down.&quot; Cameron continued, &quot;He took it as a deep blow to his brand. I think it really shook him.&quot;

Shane Black was very critical of the movie: &quot;It was a mess. There was a movie in there, struggling to emerge, which would have pleased me. But what they&#x27;d made was a jarring, random collection of scenes.&quot;

In the years since the release of &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, the film has developed a strong cult following. Schwarzenegger singled out that movie as his most underrated: &quot;&quot;Last Action Hero&quot; was great – it wasn&#x27;t fantastic, but it was underrated. Now, more and more people are seeing it and saying, &quot;I love this movie.&quot; I&#x27;m getting the residual checks, so I know it&#x27;s true. It made money – that&#x27;s always an important thing for me. Because it&#x27;s show business, right?&quot; Later, Charles Dance said: &quot;I think they just didn&#x27;t time the release very well. It came out more or less at the same time as something very big&quot;, referring to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. &quot;But it was fun to do.&quot; He also praised Schwarzenegger: &quot;Arnold is a very smart man, oh yes. Very definitely. And very funny, and very aware.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst New Star (Austin O&#x27;Brien), and Worst Original Song (&quot;Big Gun&quot;), but it did not win any. At the 1993 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film received two nominations without wins: Worst Picture and Worst Actor (Schwarzenegger).
The film was also nominated for seven Saturn Awards for Best Fantasy Film, Best Actor, Best Director, Best Writing, Best Performance by a Young Actor, Best Costume, and Best Special Effects, again winning nothing.

==Video games==
A video game based on the film was released in 1994 on video game consoles, the themed-pinball machine by Data East was included and released on &quot;The Pinball Arcade&quot; and its spin-off &quot;Stern Pinball Arcade&quot; in 2016.

==Potential sequel==
In October 2019, Schwarzenegger said that he was open to starring in sequels to &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; and &quot;True Lies&quot; (1994) if there was sufficient fan interest.

<text>The UGM-96 Trident I, or Trident C4, was an American submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), built by Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Sunnyvale, California. First deployed in 1979, the Trident I replaced the Poseidon missile. It was retired in 2005, having been replaced by the Trident II.

The missile was a three-stage, solid-fuelled system, capable of carrying up to eight W76 warheads in the Mark 4 RB.

The first eight s were armed with Trident I missiles. Twelve - and s were also retrofitted with Trident I missiles, which replaced older Poseidon missiles.

In 1980, the Royal Navy requested Trident I missiles under the Polaris Sales Agreement. In 1982, the agreement was changed to supply Trident II instead.

<text>The UGM-133A Trident II, or Trident D5 is a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), built by Lockheed Martin Space in Sunnyvale, California, and deployed with the United States and Royal Navy. It was first deployed in March 1990, and remains in service. The Trident II Strategic Weapons System is an improved SLBM with greater accuracy, payload, and range than the earlier Trident C-4. It is a key element of the U.S. strategic nuclear triad and strengthens U.S. strategic deterrence. The Trident II is considered to be a durable sea-based system capable of engaging many targets. It has payload flexibility that can accommodate various treaty requirements, such as New START. The Trident II&#x27;s increased payload allows nuclear deterrence to be accomplished with fewer submarines, and its high accuracy—approaching that of land-based missiles—enables it to be used as a first strike weapon.

Trident II missiles are carried by 14 US and 4 British submarines, with 24 missiles on each &quot;Ohio&quot; class and 16 missiles on each &quot;Vanguard&quot; class (the number of missiles on &quot;Ohio&quot;-class submarines was reduced to 20, by 2017, in compliance with the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty). There have been 177 successful test flights of the D5 missile since design completion in 1989, the most recent being from in February 2020. There have been fewer than 10 test flights that were failures, the most recent being from off the coast of Florida in January 2024. The D5 is the sixth in a series of missile generations deployed since the sea-based deterrent program began 60 years ago. The Trident D5LE (life-extension) version will remain in service until 2042.

==History==
The Trident II was designed with greater range and payload capacity than its predecessor (Trident C-4). In 1972, the US Navy projected an initial operating capability (IOC) date of 1984. The US Navy shifted the IOC date to 1982. On 18 October 1973, a Trident program review was administered. On 14 March 1974, the US Deputy Secretary of Defense disseminated two requirements for the Trident program. The first was an accuracy improvement for the Trident C-4. The second requirement asked for an alternative to the C-4, or a new Trident II missile with a larger first-stage motor than the C-4.

The U.S. Navy conducted studies to determine whether the more expensive Trident II could be constructed similarly to the US Air Force&#x27;s MX ICBM, primarily to decrease budget costs. It was established that the Trident II would be in diameter and in length in order to match the performance of the existing MX ICBM. Modifications to the guidance system, electronics hardening, and external protective coatings were incorporated into the design. While this satisfied the Navy&#x27;s study requirements, it did not accommodate the US Air Force payload requirements.

Propulsion stages were proposed to be used between the first stage and second stage motors, effectively making the Trident II a longer three-stage missile than the C-4. Studies were delayed in 1978 when Congress approved only $5 million of the suggested $15 million for the Navy and Air Force program studies. By December 1978, the Navy&#x27;s and the Air Force&#x27;s own studies agreed with each other that a similar missile structure would not achieve desired savings. It was determined that the Navy and Air Force would maintain and be responsible for their own unique weapon systems. The US Navy continued with its own design of the Trident II.

In March 1980, US Secretary of Defense Harold Brown proposed an increased level of funding for the submarine-launched ballistic missile modernization, emphasizing increased accuracy. The House Armed Services Committee (HASC) recommended no funding, while the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) recommended full funding of $97 million. The SASC asked for a plan incorporating &quot;the fullest possible competition . . . [and] should consider competing among contractors for each major component, including the integrated missile.&quot; $65 million was awarded for the submarine-launched ballistic missile modernization.

On 2 October 1981, President Reagan called for the modernization of the strategic forces. The Defense Department directed the Navy to fund all development of the Trident II D5 missile with a December 1989 IOC. All research and development efforts would be directed toward &quot;a new development, advanced technology, high accuracy Trident II D5 system.&quot; In December 1982, Deputy SECDEF Frank Carlucci advised the Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger to include funding for a new reentry vehicle–warhead combination for Trident II. The reentry vehicle was to be designated as the Mk 5, which was to have a greater yield than the Mk 4. The development contract for Trident II was issued in October 1983. On 28 December 1983, the deputy SECDEF authorized the Navy to proceed with full-scale engineering development of the Trident II D5.

An initial series of 19 land-based Trident II launches took place from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 46 from 15 January 1987 to 27 January 1989. The first submarine launch was attempted by , the first D-5 ship of the &quot;Ohio&quot; class, on 21 March 1989 off the coast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The launch attempt failed four seconds into the flight because the plume of water following the missile rose to a greater height than expected, and water was in the nozzle when the motor ignited. Once the problem was understood, relatively simple changes were quickly made, but the problem delayed the initial operating capability of Trident II until March 1990. IOC for Strategic Weapons Facility Pacific (SWFPAC) was completed on schedule in 2001, allowing Trident II SSBN to be deployed in the Pacific theater.

In 1980, the United Kingdom adopted the Trident I C-4 missile as part of its Trident nuclear program.

==Design==
The Trident II is a three-stage rocket, each stage containing a solid-fuel rocket motor. The first motor is made by Northrop Grumman. This first stage incorporates a solid propellant motor, parts to ensure first-stage ignition, and a thrust vector control (TVC) system. The first-stage section, compared to the Trident C-4, is slightly larger, allowing increased range and a larger payload. In addition to a larger motor, the D-5 uses an advanced and lighter fuel binder (polyethylene glycol) than the C-4.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trident I C-4 FBM / SLBM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This fuel is more commonly known as NEPE-75. (NEPE stands for &quot;nitrate ester plasticized polyether&quot;, the 75 represents that the fuel contains 75% solids.) The solid components bound by fuel binder are HMX, aluminum, and ammonium perchlorate.

Both the first- and second-stage motors are connected by an interstage casing, which contains electronic equipment and ordnance for separation during flight. The second stage also contains a motor made by Thiokol and Hercules Inc., parts to ensure the second-stage ignition, and a TVC system. The first and second stages are both important to the structural integrity of the missile. To ensure that the stages maintain a maximal strength-to-weight ratio, both stages are reinforced by a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer hull.

The second and third-stage sections are connected by an integrated equipment/adapter section (ES). The equipment/adapter section is modified to be shorter and more compact than the C-4&#x27;s adapter section. The D-5&#x27;s equipment section contains critical guidance and flight control avionics, such as the Mk 6 navigation system. The equipment section also contains the third-stage TVC system, ordnance for ejecting from the second-stage motor, and the MIRV platform. The nose fairing shields the payload and third-stage motor. Mounted within the nose cap (above the nose fairing) is an extendable aerospike. This aerospike effectively decreases drag by 50%. The third-stage hull is also reinforced by carbon fiber and kevlar.

The Trident II is the first missile of the US Navy&#x27;s Fleet Ballistic Missile program to incorporate a 3D printed component.

While Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor, a variety of corporations work on the Trident II. For example, in October 2020, Boeing was contracted for maintenance, rebuilding and technical services for the Trident II navigation subsystem, and Northrop Grumman was contracted for engineering support and integration for the Trident II and relevant submarines at sites and shipyards from Sunnyvale, California, and Bangor, Washington, to Kings Bay, Georgia, and Cape Canaveral, Florida, among other locales. Peraton was contracted for program support services on the Trident II reentry subsystem, and Systems Planning &amp; Analysis Inc. was contracted for Trident II technical services, program support, assessments, special studies, and systems engineering.

===Sequence of operation===

Before the launch sequence is initiated, the on-board MARK 6 navigation system is activated. The specified mission trajectory is loaded onto the flight computer.

Once the launch command is given, a steam generator system is activated, igniting a gas generator whose exhaust is fed into cooling water, causing expanding gas within the launch tube to force the missile upward, and out of the submarine. Within seconds, the missile breaches the surface of the water and the first-stage Thrust Vectoring Control (TVC) subsystem ignites. This enables hydraulic actuators attached to the first-stage nozzle. Soon after, the first-stage motor ignites and burns for approximately 65 seconds until the fuel is expended; in addition, an aerospike atop the missile deploys shortly after first-stage ignition to shape airflow. When the first-stage motor ceases operation, the second-stage TVC subsystem ignites. The first-stage motor is then ejected by ordnance within the interstage casing.

Once the first stage is cleared, the second-stage motor ignites and burns for approximately 65 seconds. The nose fairing is then jettisoned, separating from the missile. When the nose fairing is clear of the missile, the third-stage TVC subsystem ignites, and ordnance separates the second-stage motor. The third-stage motor then ignites, pushing the equipment section the remaining distance (approx. 40 seconds) of the flight. When the third-stage motor reaches the targeted area, the Post Boost Control System (PBCS) ignites, and the third-stage motor is ejected.

The astro-inertial guidance uses star positioning to fine-tune the accuracy of the inertial guidance system after launch. As the accuracy of a missile is dependent upon the guidance system knowing the exact position of the missile at any given moment during its flight, the fact that stars are a fixed reference point from which to calculate that position makes this a potentially very effective means of improving accuracy. In the Trident system, this was achieved by a single camera that was designed to spot just one star in its expected position. If it was not quite aligned to where it should be, it would indicate that the inertial system was not precisely on target and a correction would be made.

The equipment section, with the MIRV, then aims the reentry vehicles (RV) towards the earth. The payload is then released from the MIRV platform. To prevent the PBCS correctional thrust from interfering with the RV when released, the equipment section initiates the Plume Avoidance Maneuver (PAM). If the RV will be disrupted by the PBCS nozzle&#x27;s thrust, the nearest nozzle will shut off until the RV is away from the MIRV. The PAM is used only when a nozzle&#x27;s plume will disrupt the area near an RV. The PAM is a specialized design feature added to the Trident II to increase accuracy.

===Warheads===
In US service Trident II can be loaded with up to eight Mk-5 RVs with 475-kt W88 warheads, up to twelve Mk-4A RVs with 90-kt W76-1 warheads, and up to twelve Mk-4A RVs with 5–7-kt W76-2 warheads. In practice, each missile on average carries four warheads due to the warhead limitations placed by the New START treaty.

The system previously carried the Mk-4 RV with a 100kt W76-0 warhead, but beginning in September 2008 W76-0s were converted to W76-1s. This process was completed by December 2018. Conversion from the W76-0 to W76-1 involved fitting the warheads with a new RV (the Mk-4A), replacing age limited components and fitting the warhead with a new MC4700 arming, fusing and firing (AF&amp;F) system. The MC4700 AF&amp;F system (dubbed the &quot;super fuze&quot;) significantly improves warhead kill probabilities against hardened targets such as silos or bunkers. The W76-2 is also fitted with the Mk-4A RV and MC4700 fuze.

In the National Nuclear Security Administration&#x27;s 2021 budget request, the agency requested US$53m to begin development of a new W93 warhead for use on Trident II and US$32 million to begin development of a new Mk-7 RV. If approved, the W93 will be the first new nuclear weapon system to receive a type designation since the end of the Cold War. It is unclear if the W93 will replace the W76-1, the W88 or both warheads.

In UK usage Trident II missiles are equipped with a warhead called Holbrook and have a maximum yield of 100kt. The UK government insists the warhead is a British design, but analysts believe that it is largely based on the US W76 design. In 2011 it was reported that British warheads would receive the new Mk 4A reentry vehicles and some or all of the other upgrades that US W76 warheads were receiving in their W76-1 Life Extension Program. Some reports suggested that British warheads would receive the same arming, fusing and firing system (AF&amp;F) as the US W76-1. Under a 1958 agreement, the US supplies the UK with blueprints of its own warhead designs but the design, manufacture and maintenance of UK warheads are purely a UK responsibility. The British government&#x27;s Atomic Weapons Establishment is currently developing a new warhead to replace the existing Holbrook warhead, with deployment expected in the 2030s.

<doc id="675835" wikidata="Q853808" url="?curid=675835" title="Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger">
<text>The Tank, Cruiser, Challenger (A30) was a British tank of World War II. It mounted the QF 17-pounder anti-tank gun on a chassis derived from the Cromwell tank to add anti-tank firepower to the cruiser tank units. The design compromises made in fitting the large gun onto the Cromwell chassis resulted in a tank with a powerful weapon and reduced armour. However, the extemporised 17-pounder Sherman Firefly conversion of the US-supplied Sherman proved easier to produce and, with delays in production, only 200 Challengers were built. The Challenger was able to keep up with the fast Cromwell tank and was used with them.

==History==
The driving force in the development of the Challenger was William Arthur Robotham. &quot;Roy&quot; Robotham had been a Rolls-Royce executive in the car division who, with no work to do, had led a team to develop a tank powerplant from the Rolls-Royce Merlin aircraft engine. The Rolls-Royce Meteor gave the British a powerful, reliable engine, which was used in the A27M Cruiser Mk VIII Cromwell tank. Robotham&#x27;s contributions gained him a place in the Ministry of Supply and on the Tank Board, despite his lack of experience in tank design.

The General Staff brought forward specification A29 for a 45 ton, 17 pounder-armed cruiser tank based on needs identified in the African desert campaign. British tanks were generally underarmed compared to German vehicles. The design weight of this vehicle was subsequently seen as excessive and the specification was passed over in favour of the alternate specification, A30, which was lighter. In 1942, an order for the development of an A30 based tank was placed with Birmingham Railway Carriage &amp; Wagon Company (BRC&amp;W) expecting it to be based on the Cromwell components also being manufactured by BRC&amp;W. The turret and gun mounting were in the hands of Stothert &amp; Pitt. Birmingham Carriage had to modify the Cromwell hull to take a bigger turret.

The first prototype was ready in August 1942, only seven months after development had commenced, but proved to be very flawed. An improved second prototype was presented in January 1943 but was still considered unacceptable. A committee met to determine whether a requirement for a 17-pounder tank existed. The Challenger had been developed in anticipation of more heavily armoured Axis tanks, following the trend in Nazi German tank design. At roughly the same time the Tiger I entered service with the German army, placing an immediate need for a 17-pounder armed tank in response.
When the second prototype was tested at Lulworth, it was found that although it would be effective at long range against the current best-gunned tank in German service (the Panzer IV &quot;Special&quot; with the long gun), at shorter ranges it would be at a disadvantage due to its slow firing rate and thin armour. The design received additional emphasis when, in May 1943, it was found that the Cromwell could not carry its intended armament. Vickers had been developing a 50-calibre-long high-velocity tank gun. It was realised late in the design process that the Cromwell&#x27;s turret ring was too small for this gun. The Challenger would be the only British cruiser tank to mount a weapon that could tackle heavier German armour until the arrival of the A34 Comet. So in February 1943 an order was made of two hundred vehicles; the Army General Staff took five months to approve the Challenger design for production (in February 1943, the only significant alteration was to the ammunition stowage), and Robotham was also critical of the decision to continue manufacturing the Cromwell with a 6-pounder gun (the 17-pounder gun was &quot;infinitely better&quot;).

British tank production was constrained by limited resources and insufficient numbers could be made. This was compensated by American production. In the lead up to D-Day, Sherman tanks were fitted with the 17 pounder, creating the interim 17 pounder Sherman Firefly. Converting Sherman tanks was simpler than producing Challengers, so it was decided in November 1943 to terminate the A30 production run after the two hundred vehicles had been built, allowing BRC&amp;W to concentrate on the Cromwell. At the same time the A 40 &quot;Challenger Stage II&quot; project was cancelled, which had envisaged a 36 tonne type with heavier armour. Future design priority was concentrated on the A34 Comet, which eventually replaced the Cromwell, Firefly and Challenger. Challenger production started in March 1944. That year 145 vehicles were delivered with another 52 in 1945. Production was in two batches. A first run of forty vehicles had a 40 mm gun mantlet; with the second batch this was replaced by a 102 mm mantlet. From the hundredth vehicle onwards appliqué 25 mm armour plates were fitted on the turret, that had already been applied to existing vehicles by field units.

The tank was rendered obsolete when the Vickers HV 75 mm gun was developed to become the (actually 3 inch = 76.2 mm calibre) to arm the Comet tank. The used the same projectiles as the 17 pounder with a reduced propellant charge. The 17 pounder gun was used on the earliest marks of the Comet&#x27;s successor, the Centurion tank.

==Design==

The turret mounted the Ordnance QF 17-pounder gun required in the Tank Board specification and the hull machine gun was removed to provide stowage space for the long 17-pounder cartridges. The War Office expected that this larger ammunition, together with its stowage forward, would require two loaders alongside the commander and gunner in the turret. To fit the larger weapon &quot;and&quot; additional crewman in the turret, a much larger turret than that of the Cromwell was specified, developed separately, which had a significant effect on the design and was not resolved until later development of Avenger.

To carry the weight of the 17-pounder and ammunition, an extra wheel station and suspension arm was needed, lengthening the hull. This change in length, without a corresponding change in width across the tracks, reduced mobility compared to the Cromwell, although speed remained high at 25 mph. To limit the weight, the amount of armour was reduced but this could only be achieved on the turret, on the front (the mantlet was 102 mm of IT 90) and on the sides compared to and on the Cromwell. Applique armour, 25 mm thick, was later added to turret and hull front. The turret did not use a conventional turret ring: to increase the aperture diameter by four inches, it rested on a ball mount on the hull floor. Therefore the base of the turret was unprotected, and it would cantilever if struck by enemy rounds. A jacking feature, with four internal semi-automatic jacks, was fitted to clear jams. The additional length allowed larger hatches to be fitted in the hull while still clearing the turret, providing easier access than Cromwell.

Upon Robotham&#x27;s appointment as Chief Engineer to the Department of Tank Design, the lack of progress on an (A29) 17-pounder armed tank could not adequately be explained. Robotham&#x27;s memoirs indicate a lack of awareness that any such requirement existed within the department and military users were still unsure whether the tank was required at the point when the rushed A30 design had been completed and prototype vehicles run. The Challenger was then rushed into production alongside existing production runs of Cromwell, limiting the number of tanks that could be produced.

==Performance==
The 17-pounder gun mounted on the Challenger offered sufficient performance against the majority of German AFVs, including the Tiger I and Panther tank and the tank had a higher top speed and cross country mobility than the Panzer IV or StuG III. The Challenger could only hold 48 rounds of the large 17-pounder ammunition because the General Staff required four men in the turret, though later tanks like the Centurion used a three-man turret. The armour of the Challenger offered very little protection against contemporary German anti-tank guns and was lower than that of the Cromwell, which often operated with Challengers.

In combat, the Challenger fulfilled much the same role as the Sherman Firefly, providing overwatch for the other tanks in the troop, as its 17-pounder could penetrate almost all German AFVs frontally, unlike the 75 mm. It was deployed in a similar manner at a troop level, this was typically one 17-pounder armed tank (such as Challenger or Firefly) to three 75 mm armed tanks (Cromwells or Shermans); at times, the deployment of 17-pounder armed tanks was increased to two per troop.

The Challenger was based on the reliable Cromwell tank, which used the new Rolls-Royce Meteor engine, which was far more reliable and powerful than the ageing Liberty engine used in earlier British Cruiser designs like the Crusader tank. Its reliability was slightly below that of the Cromwell, as a problem was experienced with track throwing, caused by mud building up in the wheels but this was resolved in the field. Supply and maintenance were vastly simplified through the use of common parts with the Cromwell.

In comparison with the Firefly, the tank lacked the sloping forward armour but presented a lower profile and avoided the Firefly&#x27;s constraint on gun depression. The Challenger provided 10° of gun depression while Firefly was limited to 5°, which was a significant disadvantage in combat. It was preferred within Cromwell units as it shared similar mobility and manoeuvrability, whereas the Firefly was slower. Despite a lower design weight than the earlier A29 specification (32½ not 34 tons), the Challenger was heavy and required dockyard equipment to ship, making it impractical to use in amphibious assaults such as the D-day landings.

==Service==

No provision was made for deep wading, before the design went into production; as a result, the A30 could not be landed in the initial phase of the Allied invasion of Normandy. Challenger crews had to wait until July 1944, when Mulberry harbours were operational and ports had been captured.

The Challenger and Firefly, equipped with 17-pounder, were added to tank squadrons to deal with opposing heavy tanks and many Challengers were issued to reconnaissance units using Cromwells. It was initially used by the Guards Armoured Division and the 11th Armoured Division, with about sixteen vehicles in each unit: one Challenger and three Cromwells in each troop. The latter division phased the type out from February 1945 onwards, while it was being introduced to the Cromwell units of the 7th Armoured Division. The tank was unpopular at first, with crews complaining about the lack of armour, the high silhouette and the tracks being thrown. The track problem was caused by the smaller idler wheels compared to the Cromwell; these were in August replaced by idlers with a standard diameter. Troops used to the low profile of the Crusader and Cromwell found the height a serious problem, although it was still shorter than the comparable Sherman Firefly.

Confidence in the vehicle grew and it became preferred over the Firefly, being lower, faster and more manoeuvrable but the early bad reputation persisted with others. Allied forces were issued with the Challenger, the 1st Polish Armoured Division receiving several in mid-1945 and the 1st Czechoslovak Independent Armoured Brigade used it (Unit Entitlements at the end of 1944 for CIABG was four Challengers) during the siege of Dunkirk in late 1944. After the war, the Czechoslovak government purchased 22 Challengers from the brigade inventory, which served in the Czechoslovak army (first with the 11th, later 23rd, Tank Brigade and then with the 13th Independent Tank Battalion) until they were put in reserve in 1951 and scrapped in 1959.

==Variants==
The A30 Avenger SP2 or SP 17pdr, A30 (Avenger) was a development of the Challenger to be used as a self-propelled gun. It removed the second loader&#x27;s position and featured a much lower profile turret and lower superstructure on the hull. An additional stowage bin was provided on the glacis plate for a large camo net and return rollers were added to the tracks.

The Avenger featured a permanent opening in the turret roof covered with an armoured cover supported a few inches above. This provided the commander and loader with full 360 degree visibility.

By the time the pilot was complete, the British had lend-lease M10s for anti-tank work coming into service and the production of Avenger was de-prioritised in favour of Comet production 

As many as 500 vehicles appear to have been planned and 230 vehicles were ordered from BRC&amp;W, but this dropped to 80 with the end of the war. It is not known how many were actually built; the SP2 nomenclature indicates its place in production with the Archer (SP1) and Alecto (SP3).

The Avenger suffered in trials as the engine had to remain running to use the turret traverse motor, because the noise and exhaust could give the vehicle away. Winter trials in a prolonged stationary position also failed in comparison with Archer, when the Avenger&#x27;s steering failed. Both vehicles had problems with camouflage. The vehicle was dropped from trials in 1950, along with removal of the 17pdr SP Achilles (re-gunned US M10 GMC- equipped with 17pdr).

While the Avenger was only used for trials and was ultimately unsuccessful in comparison with the purpose built vehicles, it provides an example of what could have been possible for the Challenger had it not been forced to accommodate a second loader in a larger (four-man) turret in its design. It may have been corrected had effort not been moved to the Comet.

==Survivors==

Two vehicles survive, one at the Overloon War Museum in the Netherlands, acquired from the Muzeeaquarium Delfzijl in 1976; the other was awaiting restoration at the Isle of Wight Military Museum in the United Kingdom until its closure. Once restored, it will be displayed at the Bovington Tank Museum.

<doc id="675837" wikidata="Q233976" url="?curid=675837" title="Frederick Gowland Hopkins">
<text>Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins (20 June 1861 – 16 May 1947) was an English biochemist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1929, with Christiaan Eijkman, for the discovery of vitamins. He also discovered the amino acid tryptophan, in 1901. He was President of the Royal Society from 1930 to 1935.

==Education and early life==
Hopkins was born in Eastbourne, Sussex, and initially attended the City of London School. However, he soon transferred to Alexandra Park College in Hornsey and completed his further study with the University of London External Programme (through evening classes at Birkbeck College) and the medical school at Guy&#x27;s Hospital which is now part of King&#x27;s College London School of Medicine.

==Career and research==
After graduating, Hopkins then taught physiology and toxicology at Guy&#x27;s Hospital from 1894 to 1898. In 1898, while attending a meeting of the Physiological Society, he was invited by Sir Michael Foster to join the Physiological Laboratory in Cambridge to investigate the chemical aspects of physiology. Biochemistry was not, at that time, recognised as a separate branch of science. He was a lecturer in chemical physiology at Emmanuel College, Cambridge in March 1900, when he received the academic rank Master of Arts (MA) &quot;honoris causa&quot;. He earned a doctorate in physiology (D.Sc.) from the University of London in July 1902, and at the same time was given a readership in biochemistry at Trinity College. While at Cambridge he was initiated into Freemasonry. In 1910 he became a Fellow of Trinity College, and an Honorary Fellow of Emmanuel College. In 1914 he was elected to the Chair of Biochemistry at Cambridge University, thus becoming the first Professor in that discipline at Cambridge. His Cambridge students included neurochemistry pioneer Judah Hirsch Quastel and pioneer embryologist Joseph Needham.

Hopkins had for a long time studied how cells obtain energy via a complex metabolic process of oxidation and reduction reactions. His study in 1907 with Sir Walter Morley Fletcher of the connection between lactic acid and muscle contraction was one of the central achievements of his work on the biochemistry of the cell. He and Fletcher showed that oxygen depletion causes an accumulation of lactic acid in the muscle. Their work paved the way for the later discovery by Archibald Hill and Otto Fritz Meyerhof that a carbohydrate metabolic cycle supplies the energy used for muscle contraction.

In 1912 Hopkins published the work for which he is best known, demonstrating in a series of animal feeding experiments that diets consisting of pure proteins, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and water fail to support animal growth. This led him to suggest the existence in normal diets of tiny quantities of as yet unidentified substances that are essential for animal growth and survival. These hypothetical substances he called &quot;accessory food factors&quot;, later renamed vitamins. It was this work that led his being awarded (together with Christiaan Eijkman) the 1929 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

During World War I, Hopkins continued his work on the nutritional value of vitamins. His efforts were especially valuable in a time of food shortages and rationing. He agreed to study the nutritional value of margarine and found that it was, as suspected, inferior to butter because it lacked the vitamins A and D. As a result of his work, vitamin-enriched margarine was introduced in 1926.

Hopkins is credited with the discovery and characterisation in 1921 of glutathione extracted from various animal tissues. At the time he proposed that the compound was a dipeptide of glutamic acid and cysteine. The structure was controversial for many years but in 1929 he concluded that it was a tripeptide of glutamic acid, cysteine and glycine. This conclusion agreed with that from the independent work of Edward Calvin Kendall.

== Awards and honours ==
Hopkins was elected a Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences (USA) in 1924. During his life, in addition to the Nobel Prize, Hopkins was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1918, the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh in 1922, and the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1926.

Other significant honours were his election in 1905 as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS), Great Britain&#x27;s most prestigious scientific organisation; his knighthood by King George V in 1925; and the award in 1935 of the Order of Merit, Great Britain&#x27;s most exclusive civilian honour.

From 1930 to 1935, he served as president of the Royal Society and, in 1933, served as president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1937.

==Personal life==
In 1898, he married Jessie Anne Stephens (1861–1937); they had one son and two daughters, the younger of whom, Jacquetta Hawkes, became a prominent archaeologist and married the author J. B. Priestley.

Gowland Hopkins died on 16 May 1947 in Cambridge and is buried at the Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground in Cambridge, with his wife.

<text>The Pistol Nebula is located in the constellation Sagittarius. It surrounds one of the most luminous stars known, the Pistol Star. Both are located 25,000 light years away from Earth in the Quintuplet cluster, near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. The nebula contains approximately 9.3 solar masses worth of ionized gas that was ejected by the star several thousand years ago. 

The nebula was first observed in radio light by the Very Large Array in the early 1980s. It was named for its shape as seen in low resolution images that were available at the time.

The Pistol Star, a luminous blue variable is 1.6 million times brighter than the Sun making it one of the most luminous stars in the Milky Way.

<text>Frederick Brian Pickering, AMet, DMet, FIMMM, CEng, FREng (17 March 1927 - 27 February 2017) was an English metallurgist. His research and development activities contributed significantly to the creation of stronger and lighter steels.

His notable research and development throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s laid the foundations for much of the physical metallurgy of high strength, low alloy steels. His &quot;Physical Metallurgy and the Design of Steels&quot; (, originally published in 1978 by Applied Science Publishers, London), continues to be recommended reading for the majority of metallurgical engineering and materials science university courses.

He was born in Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, in 1927, and was the cousin of footballer Jack Pickering. He joined the Central Research Department of the United Steel Companies as a junior assistant in the Physics Section in 1943 where he
progressed to research assistant, senior metallographer and research supervisor, and then head of the Physical Metallurgy Section. Following the nationalisation of the steel companies in 1967, he became Assistant Research Manager and then Research Manager in Physical Metallurgy, and finally Product Metallurgy Research Manager at the Swinden Laboratories of British Steel Corporation. 
In 1972 he was appointed Reader in Metallurgy at Sheffield City Polytechnic (now Sheffield Hallam University), becoming Emeritus Professor in 1989.

Pickering was awarded the Sidney Gilchrist Thomas Medal in 1968, and the Sir Robert Hadfield Medal in 1971, both from the Iron and Steel Institute. He was also awarded the Bessemer Gold Medal in 1994 for outstanding services to the steel industry, by the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining (now IOM3). He was appointed a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1987. He authored over 160 research publications throughout his career.

He died in 2017, survived by his wife and three children.

<text>The Prince of Wales Trophy, also known as the Wales Trophy, is a team award presented by the National Hockey League (NHL). Named for Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII and then Duke of Windsor), it has been awarded for different accomplishments throughout its history.

The trophy was first presented during the 1925–26 NHL season to the champion of the first game in Madison Square Garden on December 15, 1925. It was subsequently presented to the champion of the NHL playoffs (including the previous two seasons). The Wales Trophy was then awarded to the champion of the American Division (1927–1938) and later the NHL regular season champions (1938–1967). Since the 1967 NHL expansion, it has served as a counterpart to the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl by using the same criteria in the opposite competitive grouping. The Wales Trophy has been awarded to the East Division regular season champions (1967–1974), the Wales Conference &quot;regular season&quot; champions (1974–1981), the Wales Conference &quot;playoff&quot; champions (1981–1993), and the Eastern Conference playoff champions (1993–2020, 2021–present).

Due to a modified playoff format held in 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Wales Trophy was awarded to the Tampa Bay Lightning after defeating the New York Islanders in the Stanley Cup semifinals.

==History==

The Prince of Wales Trophy was first announced in December 1925. It was sponsored by the then Prince of Wales, Prince Edward, and thus bore the Prince of Wales&#x27; feathers and the shield of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada. Costing $2,500, the trophy was said to be in the possession of the league champion. It was originally awarded to the winner of the first game played in Madison Square Garden, held on December 15, 1925 (Montreal Canadiens 3 at New York Americans 1). The award was then held by the Canadiens until the end of the season. The Canadiens engraved their name on the trophy twice, for the 1924–25 season, and the preceding 1923–24 season, for which the team was league champions.

It was then awarded to the NHL playoff champion in 1925–26 and 1926–27, (along with the O&#x27;Brien Cup) before that team would go on to face the Western Hockey League (WHL) champion for the Stanley Cup at the end of those seasons. From the 1927–28 season on, the trophy was awarded to the champion of the American Division of the NHL, while the O&#x27;Brien Cup was presented to the Canadian Division champion, until 1938, when, after the NHL reverted to a single division, the Wales Trophy was made the award for the overall regular season champion.

With the expansion of the NHL in 1967, and the creation of the West Division, the Wales Trophy was given to the team that finished in first place in the East Division, during the regular season. When the league formed two conferences in 1974, the trophy transferred to the team that finished with the best regular season record in the Wales Conference, until 1981. The NHL changed its playoff format so that the two conference playoff champions would meet for the Stanley Cup. The Prince of Wales Trophy was presented to the Wales Conference playoff champions. In the summer of 1993 Wales Conference was renamed the Eastern Conference. Prince of Wales trophy has been awarded to the Eastern Conference playoff champions since the 1993–94 season.

A superstition that is prevalent among many of today&#x27;s NHL players is that no player should either touch or hoist the Wales (Eastern Conference champion) or Clarence S. Campbell (Western Conference champion) Trophies after they have won the conference playoffs; these players feel that the Stanley Cup is the true championship trophy and thus it should be the only trophy that they should be hoisting. Instead of touching the conference trophy, the captain of the winning team merely poses (usually looking solemn) with the trophy, and sometimes, the entire team poses as well. However, there have been other teams who have ignored the superstition and hoisted the conference trophies, sometimes going on to win the Cup anyway. Most notably, the Pittsburgh Penguins who were considered the most successful team to touch the trophy, winning the Stanley Cup five times after touching it.

The NHL abolished the conferences and re-aligned the league into four new divisions for the 2020–21 NHL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the semifinal round of the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs was contested between the winners of the divisional playoffs and they were seeded according to their regular season record. Initially the trophy was not going to be awarded, but it was later decided that the trophy would be awarded to the winner of the Stanley Cup semifinals series between the East and Central divisions, eventually being the New York Islanders and the Tampa Bay Lightning.

<doc id="675845" wikidata="Q562994" url="?curid=675845" title="James Evans (linguist)">
<text>James Evans (January 18, 1801 – November 23, 1846) was an English-Canadian Wesleyan Methodist missionary and amateur linguist. He is known for creating the syllabic writing system for Ojibwe and Cree, which was later adapted to other languages such as Inuktitut.

==Life==
Evans was born in Kingston-upon-Hull in England, but emigrated with his parents to Lower Canada in 1822, where he worked as a teacher. He later moved to Rice Lake and continued his teaching work.

In 1833 he was ordained as a Wesleyan Methodist minister, and in 1840 he was given authority over the local district in Norway House in Manitoba. During this time Evans worked on the development of the Ojibwe and Cree scripts. Evans had picked up Ojibwe during his work among the people in Upper Canada. He created the Ojibwe script after first trying to apply a Roman script to their language. Later, he modified syllabics slightly and applied it to Cree, a related language. The syllabic writing system was inspired in part by Pitman Shorthand. They were easy to learn and led to almost universal literacy among the Canadian Ojibwe and Cree within a few years.

Evans&#x27;s other missionary work was scarred by turmoil. Evans clashed several times with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, mostly over their treatment of the native population. Evans accidentally shot and killed his friend and co-worker Thomas Hassall in 1844. He was accused of sexual misconduct with native girls under his care. This was proven to be a ploy by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to discredit and incarcerate Evans, due to his unwavering dedication in helping the native people and his influencing them to avoid working on &#x27;Sabbath&#x27;. Although he was acquitted, he was sent to London to defend himself again. The stress took a toll on his health, and he died of a heart attack in 1846. His daughter Clarissa Eugenia later married the HBC trapper and explorer John McLean, who became active in the Methodist community of Guelph, Canada West (now Ontario).

James Evans&#x27;s grave was in England, but his remains were cremated and sent to Norway House, Manitoba.

<text>Jean René Lacoste (2 July 1904 – 12 October 1996) was a French tennis player and businessman. He was nicknamed &quot;the Crocodile&quot; because of how he dealt with his opponents; he is also known worldwide as the creator of the Lacoste tennis shirt, which he introduced in 1929, and eventually founded the brand and its logo in 1933.

Lacoste was one of the Four Musketeers with Jean Borotra, Jacques Brugnon, and Henri Cochet, French players who dominated tennis in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He won seven Grand Slam singles titles at the French, American, and British championships and was an eminent baseline player and tactician of the pre-war period. As a member of the French team, Lacoste won the Davis Cup in 1927 and 1928. Lacoste was ranked the World No. 1 player in some rankings for 1926, 1927 and 1929. He also won a bronze medal at the 1924 Summer Olympics.

==Tennis career==

Lacoste started playing tennis at age 15 when he accompanied his father on a trip to England. His first participation in a Grand Slam tournament was the 1922 Wimbledon Championships in which he lost in the first round to Pat O&#x27;Hara Wood. The following year, 1923, he reached the fourth round at Wimbledon to be narrowly defeated by Cecil Campbell, and he competed for the first time in the U.S. Championships.

His breakthrough came in 1925 when he won the singles title at the French Championships and at Wimbledon, in both cases after a victory in the final against compatriot Jean Borotra. The following year, 1926, Lacoste lost his French title after a straight-sets defeat in the final to Henri Cochet. He did not compete at Wimbledon that year, but in September he won the U.S. National Championships title against Borotra. He was ranked No. 1 for 1926 by A. Wallis Myers, tennis correspondent of The Daily Telegraph, Bill Tilden, Suzanne Lenglen and Stanley Doust (&quot;Daily Mail&quot;).

In 1927, dubbed &quot; &#x27;The finest year in tennis history&#x27; &quot; by E. Digby Baltzell, Lacoste was part of the French team that captured the Davis Cup from the United States, ending the latter&#x27;s 6-year title run. The final was played at the Germantown Cricket Club in Philadelphia and Lacoste won both his singles matches against Bill Johnston and Bill Tilden. He played Tilden in two Grand Slam tournament finals that year and won both of them. At the French Championships he was victorious in five sets; at the U.S. National Championships he defended his title and denied Tilden his seventh U.S. title by winning in straight sets, although he survived setpoints in the first and third set and was down a break in the second. At Wimbledon, Lacoste lost a five-set semifinal to Borotra. He was ranked No. 1 by A. Wallis Myers, Émile Deve, U.S. ranking committee president, Marcel Berger, (&#x27;), Jean Samazeuilh (&#x27;) and Henri Cochet.

In 1928 Lacoste lost his French title after a four-set loss in the final against Cochet. He took revenge by beating Cochet in the final of the Wimbledon Championships after having defeated Tilden in a five-set semifinal. The Challenge Round of the 1928 Davis Cup against the United States was played at the Stade Roland Garros in Paris on 27–29 July. The stadium was specifically constructed to host France&#x27;s first defense of the Davis Cup. Lacoste lost the first rubber in a five-set match to Tilden but France won the remaining rubbers to defeat the challengers 4–1 and retain the cup. Lacoste did not participate in the 1928 U.S. Championships.

Between 1923 and 1928 Lacoste played 51 Davis Cup matches for France in 26 ties and compiled a record of 32–8 in singles and 8–3 in doubles.

The only major championship Lacoste played in 1929 was the French and he won his seventh, and last, Grand Slam singles title after a tight five-set final against Jean Borotra. Failing health, including respiratory disease, led to his withdrawal from competitive tennis in 1929. He would make a brief comeback at the 1932 French Championships, where he defeated reigning Wimbledon champion Sidney Wood in the third round, but lost in the fourth to Harry Lee. He was the non-playing captain of the French Davis Cup team in 1932 and 1933.

The Four Musketeers were inducted simultaneously into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1976. In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer, the long-time tennis promoter and great player himself, included Lacoste in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time.

In 1928 Lacoste wrote a book which he titled &quot; &#x27;Lacoste on Tennis.&#x27; &quot;

There are numerous explanations of why Lacoste was originally nicknamed &quot;The Crocodile.&quot; A 2006 New York Times obituary about Lacoste&#x27;s son, Bernard, provides an apparently authoritative one. In the 1920s, supposedly, Lacoste made a bet with his team captain about whether he would win a certain match. The stakes were a suitcase he had seen in a Boston store; it was made of alligator skin. Following his victory, the American press dubbed him &quot;The Alligator.&quot; Later, René Lacoste&#x27;s friend Robert George embroidered a crocodile onto a blazer that Lacoste wore for his matches.

===Playing style===
Lacoste was primarily a baseline player who relied on control, accuracy, and deeply-placed groundstrokes to put pressure on his opponents. In addition he possessed an excellent passing shot and backhand slice. Nicknamed the &#x27;Tennis Machine&#x27; for his methodical game and ability to avoid errors, he was known as a devoted and hard-working player, rather than a player with a great amount of natural talent. His style was a complete contrast to that of his fellow Musketeer Henri Cochet. Lacoste was a studious tactician who meticulously analysed his opponents and kept detailed notes on their strengths and weaknesses.

==Business career==
In 1933, Lacoste founded &quot;La Société Chemise Lacoste&quot; with André Gillier. The company produced the tennis shirt, also known as a &quot;polo shirt,&quot; which Lacoste often wore when he was playing; this had a crocodile (often thought to be an alligator) embroidered on the chest. In 1963, Lacoste&#x27;s son Bernard took over the management of the company.

In 1961, Lacoste created an innovation in racket technology by unveiling and patenting the first tubular steel tennis racket. At that time, wood rackets were the norm; the new version&#x27;s strings were attached to the frame by a series of wires, which wrapped around the racket head. The steel-tube racket was stiffer, and imparted a greater force to the ball during a stroke. It was marketed in Europe under the Lacoste brand, but in the United States it was marketed by Wilson Sporting Goods. Pierre Darmon debuted the racket at Wimbledon in 1963, but it achieved critical acclaim and huge popularity as the Wilson T-2000, used by American tennis greats Billie Jean King and Jimmy Connors.

==Personal life==
Rene Lacoste was born to Jeanne-Marie Magdeleine Larrieu-Let and Jean-Jules Lacoste. His maternal family is from Monein, in southwest France, the genealogy dating back to the 1700s.

On 30 June 1930 he married golfing champion Simone de la Chaume. Their daughter Catherine Lacoste was a champion golfer and president of the Golf Club Chantaco, founded by her mother, at a few kilometres from Saint-Jean-de-Luz, France.

==Grand Slam finals==

===Singles: 10 (7 titles, 3 runners-up)===

===Doubles: 4 (3 titles, 1 runners-up)===

===Mixed doubles: 2 (2 runners-up)===

<doc id="675863" wikidata="Q61931" url="?curid=675863" title="Oh-My-God particle">
<text>The Oh-My-God particle was an ultra-high-energy cosmic ray detected on 15 October 1991 by the Fly&#x27;s Eye camera in Dugway Proving Ground, Utah, United States. , it is the highest-energy cosmic ray ever observed. Its energy was estimated as (320 exa-eV). The particle&#x27;s energy was unexpected and called into question prevailing theories about the origin and propagation of cosmic rays.

==Speed==
It is not known what kind of particle it was, but most cosmic rays are protons. If formula_1 is the rest mass of the particle and formula_2 is its kinetic energy (energy above the rest mass energy), then its speed was formula_3 times the speed of light. Assuming it was a proton, for which formula_4 is 938 MeV, this means it was traveling at times the speed of light, its Lorentz factor was and its rapidity was . Due to special relativity, the relativistic time dilation experienced by a proton traveling at this speed would be extreme. If the proton originated from a distance of 1.5 billion light years, it would take approximately 1.71 days in the reference frame of the proton to travel that distance.

==Collision energy==
The energy of the particle was some 40 million times that of the highest-energy protons that have been produced in any terrestrial particle accelerator. However, only a small fraction of this energy was available for its interaction with a nucleus in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, with most of the energy remaining in the form of kinetic energy of the center of mass of the products of the interaction. If formula_5 is the mass of the &quot;target&quot; nucleus, the energy available for such a collision is

formula_6

which for large formula_2 is approximately

formula_8

For the Oh-My-God particle hitting a nitrogen nucleus, this gives 2900 TeV, which is roughly 200 times higher than the highest collision energy of the Large Hadron Collider, in which two high-energy particles going opposite directions collide. As with other cosmic rays, the collision would generate a cascade of relativistic particles as the particles interacted with other nuclei. In the center-of-mass frame of reference (moving at almost the speed of light), the products of the collision, also moving apart at near light speed, would therefore have carried around 2900 TeV of total energy.

==Comparisons==

The &quot;Oh-My-God particle&quot;″s energy was estimated as , or . Although this amount is phenomenally large for a single elementary particle – far outstripping the highest energy that human technology can generate in a particle – it is still far below the level of the Planck scale, where exotic physics is expected. Though a subatomic particle, its energy was comparable to the gravitational potential energy of a 1 kilogram object that could fall 5 meters off a two-story building.

The &quot;Oh-My-God particle&quot; had (100 quintillion) times the photon energy of visible light, equivalent to a baseball travelling at about . Its energy was 20 million times greater than the highest photon energy measured in electromagnetic radiation emitted by an extragalactic object, the blazar Markarian 501.

===High energy, but far below the Planck scale===
While the particle&#x27;s energy was higher than anything achieved in terrestrial accelerators, it was still about 40 million times &quot;lower&quot; than the Planck energy (). Particles of that energy would be required in order to expose effects on the Planck scale. A proton with that much energy would travel times closer to the speed of light than the Oh-My-God particle did. As viewed from Earth and observed in Earth&#x27;s reference frame, it would take about ( times the current age of the universe) for a photon to overtake a Planck energy proton with a 1 cm lead.

==Later similar events==
Since the first observation, hundreds of similar events (energy or greater) have been recorded, confirming the phenomenon. These ultra-high-energy cosmic ray particles are very rare; the energy of most cosmic ray particles is between  eV and  eV.

More recent studies using the Telescope Array Project have suggested a source of the particles within a 20 degree radius &quot;warm spot&quot; in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major.

The Amaterasu particle, named after the sun goddess in Japanese mythology, was detected in 2021 and later identified in 2023, using the Telescope Array observatory in Utah, United States. It had an energy exceeding 240 exa-electron volts ( eV). This particle appears to have emerged from the Local Void, an empty area of space bordering the Milky Way galaxy. It contained an amount of energy comparable to dropping a brick from the height of the waist. No promising astronomical object matching the direction from which the cosmic ray arrived has been identified.
