<text>The National Association of Theatre Owners (NATO) is an American trade organization whose members are the owners of movie theaters. Most of the worldwide major theater chains&#x27; operators are members, as are hundreds of independent theater operators; collectively, they account for the operation of over 35,000 motion picture screens in all 50 U.S. states and over 33,000 screens in 100 other countries.

NATO was founded in 1965 by the merger of the largest movie theater trade organizations, the Theater Owners of America and the Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors.

The long-running official magazine of NATO is &quot;Boxoffice&quot;; between 2001 and 2007, they also published &quot;In Focus&quot;.

==History==
As the motion picture industry became larger, movie production companies began consolidating and controlling distribution. The largest producer, Famous Players–Lasky, joined and later merged with the largest distributor, Paramount (eventually becoming Paramount Pictures), and together they began block-booking in 1917, forcing theaters to buy mediocre films to get the good ones. Theaters banded together to bargain for better pricing, with 26 of the largest combining into First National Exhibitors Circuit—which went on to become a producer and distributor in its own right, before being bought by Warner Bros. By 1921, Paramount already owned 300 theaters, and other producers were catching up. Studios soon contracted with each other to keep first-runs inside the affiliated network, using this access to coerce independents into selling out.

In 1921, the first predecessor of NATO was founded, the largely affiliated Motion Picture Theater Owners of America (MPTOA), soon followed by the independent Allied States Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors (Allied), Unaffiliated Independent Motion Picture Exhibitors of America, National Independent Theatre Exhibitors, and more, to demand better pricing and access to first-runs. Unlike the others, the MPTOA embraced affiliated theaters, and soon became the largest organization.

During World War II, many theaters joined the new War Activities Committee, after the war becoming the Theatre Activities Committee and soon American Theatre Association (ATA), which strongly supported &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot;, the antitrust case against all of the major studios. A plan to merge with MPTOA, which strongly supported the studios, ran into friction, with many affiliated theaters leaving the ATA over its stance; conversely Allied, the largest purely-independent group, refused to join over the presence of affiliates. The merger went ahead in 1947, minus affiliates of Loews, RKO, and Warner Bros., and they became the Theater Owners of America (TOA) with about 10,000 theaters.

After divestiture in the fallout of the 1948 &quot;Paramount&quot; decision, many formerly-affiliated theaters ended up joining either TOA or Allied. During the post-war period, theater revenue collapsed as television became widespread, even as film rental became more expensive, and thousands of theaters closed, particularly in city centers hard hit by suburban flight. Finally, in 1966 TOA and Allied merged into the National Association of Theatre Owners, largely based on TOA&#x27;s structure but headed by Marshall Fine, former Allied chairman.

The 1970s were difficult for NATO; although the blockbuster &quot;The Godfather&quot; revitalized theater-going and revenue, in 1975 a new National Independent Theatre Exhibitors (NITE) came together to challenge NATO, eventually numbering almost a thousand theaters, and governance reforms were pushed by members as well. When the reforms stalled, the entire California and Illinois chapters pulled out in 1977, along with many small chains around the nation. After 1980, many of the requested reforms were finally implemented, including a full-time president and a full-time lobbyist in Washington, as well as moving its headquarters from New York to Los Angeles; by the end of the decade, NITE had folded back into NATO, leaving only one dominant organization.

The 1980s saw a relaxation of antitrust regulation and subsequent purchasing of many chains by distributors and large conglomerates, including 120 theaters by Paramount and Warner; by the end of the decade, consolidation left the top 10 owners in control of 55 percent of the industry. In the 1990s, theater growth exploded, and by 1999, movie screens peaked at 36,448, the vast majority of which were affiliated with NATO.

==Events==

===CinemaCon===
As ShoWest, the convention was formerly one of four major worldwide annual events owned by the Film Group unit of Nielsen Business Media before being sold in 2011 to e5 Global Media and operated exclusively by NATO.

Renamed CinemaCon in 2011, the convention is NATO&#x27;s only official convention of theater owners controlled by the organization itself. The first gathering took place in March 2011 at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada, with the second held April 23–26, 2012, at the same venue.

CinemaCon is now a stand-alone movie theater industry trade show or exposition originally established by NATO in 1975, usually held in Las Vegas in March.

On March 11, 2020, NATO canceled CinemaCon 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>Tay-ster and Rojac Records was a record label originally founded by purported gangster Fat Jack Taylor as Rojac Records in 1957 as a soul and R&amp;B label, releasing, among other artists, a number of records by Big Maybelle. Rojac Records ceased operations in 1972 but was briefly revived as Tay-ster and Rojac Records, operating out of offices located above the Harlem World Disco nightclub from 1979 until 1984. During this latter phase the label released Disco and early Hip Hop records, among them Lovebug Starski&#x27;s first single produced by David MacDonald nicknamed &quot;Mighty Whitey&quot;. Other artists on the label included Harlem World Crew and Lady Smiley.

<doc id="670539" wikidata="Q14693385" url="?curid=670539" title="Sunflower River">
<text>The Sunflower River (also known as the Big Sunflower River) is one of the main tributaries of the Yazoo River in the U.S. state of Mississippi. It is navigable by barge for 50 miles. It rises in DeSoto County, Mississippi near the Tennessee border and flows south for 100 miles to the Yazoo River, a major tributary of the Mississippi River. At Clarksdale, the county seat of Coahoma County, the annual Sunflower River Blues &amp; Gospel Festival is held.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers maintains a navigation channel, thirty miles in length. Built in 1976, the channel is used by barges and pleasure craft.

According to the USGS, variant names include Hushpuckaman Creek. The Hushpuckena River drains the northwestern part of the Sunflower River Basin, Quiver River drains the northeastern portion, and Bogue Phalia drains the west central portion of the watershed, all of which lies in the alluvium soil of the Yazoo Delta.
At Sunflower, Mississippi, the river flow measures approximately 1,099 cubic feet per second.

== Water quality ==
Like the Yazoo, this river is silt laden. The river collects mud from runoff in the bayous and small streams that feed it. The river has a distinct &quot;Clear-Mud Line&quot; where it meets the Yazoo, showing that the Big Sunflower is muddier than the Yazoo at their confluence. 

==Archaeology==
Early investigators of Native American culture identified many mound sites along the river. With what is now known of the cultures in the Southeast, scholars believe these earthwork mounds to have been built by cultures that existed before the emergence of the Choctaw and Chickasaw peoples. Clarence B. Moore conducted notable studies of the earthworks on the river near Holly Bluff, about a half a mile from the entrance to Lake George.

==Wildlife refuges==
Land use along the river and in the watershed is predominantly agricultural, with many large-scale, industrial-style farms. From the antebellum period into the 20th century, cotton was the major commodity crop. 

Three forested areas have been designated as national wildlife refuges, the Holt Collier National Wildlife Refuge, the Dahomey National Wildlife Refuge, and the Panther Swamp National Wildlife Refuge; all are managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

In August 2023 the largest state alligator of record was killed in the river.

<text>Mary Dresselhuys (January 22, 1907 – May 19, 2004) was primarily a Dutch stage actress, although she also appeared in a number of films. She was born in Tiel, the Netherlands, and died in Amsterdam.

Dresselhuys portrayed more than 150 characters during her long career. She acted in a wide range of roles but was most known as the &quot;Queen of Comedy&quot;, and continued to perform well into her 90s. After she turned 80, she asked Paul Haenen to write a play, &quot;Een bijzonder prettig vergezicht&quot; (&#x27;A particularly pleasant view&#x27;), in which she and her daughter Petra could perform together. At the age of 85 she played a part in the movie &quot;Eline Vere&quot;, and at 90 she was back on stage to do a retrospective of her career, together with Paul Haenen.

==Early years==
Dresselhuys began acting while still a gymnasium student. Spending her vacations with her grandmother in The Hague, she took every opportunity to go to the theatre, getting a front row seat if possible. Already in her teens she managed to see about 200 plays, making notes about the plays and actors she saw in a notebook which she kept throughout her life.

After high school Dresselhuys spent half a year in at English boarding school, after which she took the entrance exam for the &quot;Toneelschool&quot; (drama school) in Amsterdam without her parents&#x27; knowledge. She passed.

After graduation, in 1929 Dresselhuys, won her first role in the play &quot;Men trouwt geen meisjes zonder geld&quot; (&quot;One Doesn&#x27;t Marry Girls Without Money&quot;). From 1931 till 1945 she played with the &quot;Centraal Tooneel&quot; company. She appeared on stage in &quot;Wie is Janus?&quot; (&quot;Who is Janus?&quot;)), a translation of Carolyn Green&#x27;s play &quot;Janus&quot;, in 1958.

Selected filmography:
*&quot;The Crosspatch&quot; (&quot;De Kribbebijter&quot;) (1935) ... Mary
*&quot;The Village on the River&quot; (&quot;Dorp aan de rivier&quot;) (1958) ... Mrs. Van Taeke
*&quot;Vroeger kon je lachen&quot; (&#x27;You used to be able to laugh&#x27;) (1983) ... Woman at station

<doc id="670544" wikidata="Q5195078" url="?curid=670544" title="Current River (Ozarks)">
<text>The Current River forms in the southeastern portion of the Ozarks of Missouri and becomes a 7th order stream as it flows southeasterly out of the Ozarks into northeastern Arkansas where it becomes a tributary of the Black River, which is a tributary of the White River, a tributary of the Mississippi River. The Current River is roughly long and drains about of land mostly in Missouri and a small portion of land in northeastern Arkansas. The headwaters of the Current River are nearly above sea level, while the mouth of the river lies around above sea level. The basin drains a rural area that is dominated by karst topography, underlain by dolomite and sandstone bedrock with a small area of igneous rock southeast of Eminence, Missouri. The annual daily mean discharge of the river near Doniphan, Missouri is per second. In 1964, over 134 mi (160 km) of the upper course of the river and its tributaries were federally protected as the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, the first national park in America to protect a river system.

==Source and tributaries==
The Current River begins in Montauk State Park located in the southwestern corner of Dent County in southeastern Missouri. The confluence of Pigeon Creek and Montauk Spring form the headwaters of the river. Montauk Spring makes up most of the consistent flow of the headwaters, providing ideal conditions for trout fishing. After leaving Montauk State Park, the river enters the Ozark National Scenic Riverways. The uppermost reaches of the river are swift with numerous riffles broken by deep pools of crystal clear water, further downstream the riffles continue, but get further apart. Hardwood trees, rock ledges, caves, springs, gravel bars, and towering dolomite bluffs line the riverbanks. Welch Spring, a first magnitude spring, enters the river approximately downstream from the headwaters, nearly doubling the flow of the river. Other notable springs to add to the river include Cave Spring, Pulltite Spring, and Round Spring. Downstream from the headwaters approximately the Current River receives its largest tributary the Jacks Fork from the west near the small town of Eminence, Missouri. Blue Spring, another first magnitude spring, empties into the river, downstream from the confluence with the Jacks Fork.

The Current River is approximately long when it passes by the town of Van Buren and under U.S. Route 60. South of Van Buren a few miles the Current River receives its second biggest tributary, the largest spring in the Ozarks and one of the largest single spring outlets known in the world. Big Spring empties into the river providing nearly of water per second. From Big Spring the river continues southeasterly leaving the Ozark National Scenic Riverways from the headwaters. The river then flows through Mark Twain National Forest until reaching Doniphan, Missouri and passes under U.S. Route 160. From here the river slows as it exits the Ozark Highlands, the river continues its slow silt laden path into Arkansas where it receives the Little Black River from the northeast before it joins the Black River near Pocahontas, Arkansas.

==Recreational activities==

Canoeing, fishing, horseback riding, and camping are popular activities along the Current River. The river is fairly gentle and is considered to have mostly class 1 rapids and a few rated class 2.

Some of the points of interest along the course of the river include Montauk State Park, Welch Spring and its abandoned tuberculosis hospital, Aker&#x27;s Ferry, Cave Spring, Devil&#x27;s Well, Deer Leap, Rock House Cave, Pulltite Spring, Round Spring, Jacks Fork, Blue Spring, Rocky Falls (on a small tributary), and Big Spring.

<doc id="670549" wikidata="Q7939300" url="?curid=670549" title="Vodafone live!">
<text>Vodafone live! was the brand name for the multimedia portal service of mobile phone operator Vodafone, offering news content, picture messaging, instant messaging, email, and downloadable ringtones and games. The service officially launched on 24 October 2002, originally in eight countries. The first compatible phones were the Japanese Sharp GX10 and Panasonic GD87, and the Nokia 7650.

It was initially developed by Japan&#x27;s J-Phone under the J-Sky brand; Vodafone acquired J-Phone in August 2001, and the J-Sky service in Japan was rebranded in line as Vodafone live! in 2003. In addition, London-based Vizzavi which provided media content was taken full control by Vodafone (previously 50% owned) in 2002 and the brand name was dropped, being integrated into Vodafone live! The service and its content are modelled largely on NTT DoCoMo&#x27;s successful i-mode service.

The service was marketed extensively, using stars such as footballer David Beckham in the UK, Spain and Japan. As of May 2003 there were 1.5 million customers. In the UK market its main competing WAP portals were O2 Active and Orange World.

While the service itself could be looked at with any WAP browser, Vodafone live! handsets marketed by the company integrated the service with each handset&#x27;s core functions. All handsets included a colour screen, a digital camera and the capability to send and receive email, SMS and MMS messages. Vodafone live! had an icon-driven interface that was the same on all compatible models regardless of operating system.

In December 2004, Vodafone live! with 3G services was launched.

Vodafone live! was struggling against competitors i-mode and EZweb in Japan, and in 2006, it announced that its Japanese division will be sold to SoftBank Group. Vodafone live! was replaced there by Yahoo! Keitai.

In September 2009, Vodafone 360 and Vodafone My Web were announced to replace Vodafone live!

<doc id="670555" wikidata="Q193477" url="?curid=670555" title="A Night at the Opera (Queen album)">
<text>A Night at the Opera is the fourth studio album by the British rock band Queen, released on 28 November 1975, by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and Elektra Records in the United States. Produced by Roy Thomas Baker and Queen, it was reportedly the most expensive album ever recorded at the time of its release.

Named after the Marx Brothers&#x27; film of the same name, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was recorded at various studios across a four-month period in 1975. Due to management issues, Queen had received almost none of the money they earned for their previous albums. Subsequently, they ended their contract with Trident Studios and did not use their studios for the album (the sole exception being &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, which had been recorded the previous year). They employed a complex production that extensively used multitrack recording, and the songs incorporated a wide range of styles, such as ballads, music hall, sea shanties, dixieland, hard rock and progressive rock influences. Aside from their usual equipment, Queen also utilised a diverse range of instruments such as a double bass, harp, ukulele and more.

Upon release, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; became Queen&#x27;s first number-one album in the UK, topping the UK Albums Chart for four non-consecutive weeks. It peaked at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and became the band&#x27;s first platinum-certified album in the US. It also produced the band&#x27;s most successful single in the UK, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which became their first number one song in the country. Despite being twice as long as the average length of singles during the 1970s, the song became immensely popular worldwide.

Contemporary reviews for &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; were positive, with praise for its production and the diverse musical themes, and recognition as the album that established Queen as worldwide superstars. At the 19th Grammy Awards, its first single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; received Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices. It has since been hailed as Queen&#x27;s best album, and one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 128 on its list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2018.
==Background==
Queen&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; (1974), had obtained commercial success and brought the band mainstream attention, with the single &quot;Killer Queen&quot; reaching number two on the UK Singles Chart. The album was a minor hit in the US, reaching number twelve, while &quot;Killer Queen&quot; hit the top 20. Despite this success, the band was broke at the time, largely due to a contract they had signed which meant that they would produce albums for a production company, who would then sell the album to a record label. This meant that Queen saw almost none of the money they earned, as Trident Studios paid them £60 weekly. Guitarist Brian May was living in a bedsit in Earls Court, West London while frontman Freddie Mercury lived in a flat in Kensington that suffered from rising damp. The matter eventually reached a turning point when bassist John Deacon, who had recently married, was denied a cash advance of £4,000 by manager Norman Sheffield to put a deposit on a house. This increasing frustration led to Mercury writing the song &quot;Death on Two Legs&quot;, which would serve as the opening track to &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;.

In December 1974, the band hired Jim Beach as their lawyer and began negotiating their way out of Trident. While Beach studied the group&#x27;s contracts, the group continued touring. They began their first tour of Japan in April 1975, where thousands of fans met them at Haneda Airport and they played two sold out shows at the Nippon Budokan, Tokyo. After a nine-month dispute, Queen were finally free of Trident and signed directly with EMI Records in the UK and Elektra Records in North America. They regained control of their back catalogue, while their former publishing company, Feldman, was taken over by EMI. Because Trident had invested over £200,000 in promoting Queen, the group were required to pay half that to buy out their contracts, and they had to give Trident 1% royalties from their next six albums. Additionally, a tour of America scheduled for September 1975 had to be cancelled as it had been organised by Jack Nelson, who was associated with Trident, despite the already booked venues and sold tickets. This tour was necessary for regaining funds, and its cancellation was a major setback.

With funds running low, Queen immediately began searching for new management. Three names were shortlisted: Peter Rudge, Peter Grant, who was then Led Zeppelin&#x27;s manager, and John Reid, who was Elton John&#x27;s manager at the time. Rudge was on tour with the Rolling Stones and could not be reached, so they contacted Grant. Grant, who was eager to manage Queen, had intended the band would sign with Swan Song, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s label, and suggested Queen go on tour while he sorted out their finances. The group feared Grant would prioritise Led Zeppelin over them, and were reluctant to sign with Swan Song, so they contacted Reid. Reid was initially doubtful about managing another band; however, he accepted after learning it was Queen, and advised the group to &quot;go into the studio and make the best record you can&quot;.

==Recording and production==


Queen worked with producer Roy Thomas Baker, who had also split from Trident, and engineer Mike Stone. It was the last time they would work with Baker until 1978&#x27;s &quot;Jazz&quot;. Gary Langan, then 19 years old and who had been a tape operator on two of &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;″s songs, was promoted to an assistant engineer on the album. It was reportedly the most expensive album ever made at the time, with the estimated cost being £40,000 (equivalent to £ in 2025).

The album was recorded at seven different studios over a period of four months. Queen spent a month during the summer of 1975 rehearsing in a barn at what would become Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey. The group then had a three-week writing and rehearsing session in a rented house near Kington, Herefordshire before recording began. From August to September 1975, the group worked at Rockfield in Monmouthshire. For the remainder of recording sessions, which lasted until November, the group recorded at Lansdowne, Sarm Studios, Roundhouse, Scorpio Sound and Olympic Sound Studios. As their deal with Trident had ended, Trident Studios was not used during recording. The only song on the album recorded at Trident was &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, which had been recorded on 27 October the previous year, shortly before the band embarked on their Sheer Heart Attack Tour.

The group required multi-tracking for their complex vocal harmonies which typically consisted of May singing lower registers, Mercury singing middle registers and Taylor performing the higher parts (Deacon did not sing). Unlike their first three albums, which had used 16-track tape, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was recorded using 24-track tape. Their vocal harmonies are particularly notable on the song &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, which features an elaborate opera sequence dominated by multitracked vocals. Similarly, &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot; has an a capella middle section that utilises delay on Mercury&#x27;s vocals. For their self-titled &quot;guitar orchestrations&quot;, May overdubbed his homemade Red Special guitar through an amplifier built by Deacon, known as the Deacy Amp, later released commercially as the &quot;Brian May&quot; amplifier by Vox. Guitar layering is one of May&#x27;s distinctive techniques as a rock guitarist. He has said that the technique was developed whilst looking for a violin sound.

Aside from their usual equipment, the group used various instruments on the album. Mercury used a grand piano for most of the songs, contributing a jangle piano on &quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;, while Taylor used a timpani and gong on &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Deacon played double bass on &quot;&#x27;39&quot; and Wurlitzer Electric Piano on &quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot;. In the album liner notes, May was credited to &quot;orchestral backdrops&quot; – a reference to the fact that he played a number of instruments not typically found in Queen songs. He played an acoustic guitar on &quot;Love of My Life&quot; and &quot;&#x27;39&quot;, as well a harp on &quot;Love of My Life&quot;, and a toy koto on &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot;. The song &quot;Good Company&quot; also features May recreating a Dixieland jazz band, which was done on his Red Special.

===Overview===
The album has been affiliated with progressive rock, pop, heavy metal, hard rock and avant-pop. It contains a diverse range of influences including folk, skiffle, British camp and music hall, jazz and opera. Each member wrote at least one song: Mercury wrote five of the songs, May wrote four, and Taylor and Deacon wrote one song each. The closing track was an instrumental cover of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the British national anthem, for which May was credited as the arranger.

For their first two albums, much of Queen&#x27;s songwriting combined contemporary progressive rock and heavy metal, which led to a &quot;Led Zeppelin meets Yes&quot; description of the band. Starting with &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;, Queen began drawing inspiration from their everyday lives, and embraced more mainstream musical styles, a trend which &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; would continue. Lyrical themes ranged from science fiction and fantasy to heartbreak and romance, often with a tongue in cheek sense of humour. The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; noted that the group blended &quot;clever, often poignant lyrics with attractively-arranged melodies&quot;.

===Side one===
====&quot;Death on Two Legs&quot;====
&quot;Death on Two Legs&quot; is considered to be Mercury&#x27;s hate letter to Queen&#x27;s first manager, Norman Sheffield, who for some years was reputed to have mistreated the band and abused his role as their manager from 1972 to 1975. The lyrics refer to &quot;blood-sucking leeches&quot; and &quot;decaying sewer rats&quot;. Though the song never makes direct reference to him, after listening to a playback of the song at Trident Studios around the time of the album&#x27;s release, Sheffield sued the band and the record label for defamation, which resulted in an out-of-court settlement, but also confirmed his connection to the song. Executives at EMI were unsure that the song was a good idea, May was unsure about the lyrics and felt bad that Mercury was singing it, but ultimately realised it was the songwriter&#x27;s final choice as to what should be sung. As with &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, most of the guitar parts on this song were initially played on piano by Mercury, to demonstrate to May how they needed to be played on guitar. During live performances, Mercury would usually rededicate the song to &quot;a real motherfucker of a gentleman&quot;, although this line was censored on the version that appeared on their &quot;Live Killers&quot; album in 1979. Other than on the live album, he said it was dedicated to a &quot;motherfucker I used to know&quot;. &quot;Death on Two Legs&quot; remained on the setlist until, and well into, The Game Tour in 1981, and was then dropped. The piano introduction was played occasionally during the &quot;Hot Space&quot; and &quot;Works&quot; tours.

====&quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon&quot;====
&quot;Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon&quot; is another song by Mercury. He played piano and performed all of the vocals. The lead vocal was sung in the studio and reproduced through headphones in a tin bucket elsewhere in the studio. A microphone picked up the sound from the bucket, which gives it a hollow &quot;megaphone&quot; sound. The guitar solo is also reported to have been recorded on the vocal track, as there were no more tracks to record on, as explained by producer Roy Thomas Baker during the &quot;Classic Albums&quot; documentary.

====&quot;I&#x27;m in Love with My Car&quot;====
&quot;I&#x27;m in Love with My Car&quot; was written and sung by Taylor. The song was initially taken as a joke by May, who thought that Taylor was not serious when he heard a demo recording. Taylor played the guitars in the original demo, but they were later re-recorded by May on his Red Special. The lead vocals were performed by Taylor on the studio version, and all released live versions. The revving sounds at the conclusion of the song were recorded by Taylor&#x27;s then current car, an Alfa Romeo. The lyrics were inspired by one of the band&#x27;s roadies, Johnathan Harris, whose Triumph TR4 was evidently the &quot;love of his life&quot;. The song is dedicated to him, with the album saying: &quot;Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end&quot;. When it came down to releasing the album&#x27;s first single, Taylor was so fond of his song that he urged Mercury, the writer of the first single, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, to allow it to be the B-side. This decision would later become the cause of much internal friction in the band, in that while it was only the B-side, it generated an equal amount of publishing royalties for Taylor as the A-side did for Mercury. The song was often played live during the 1977–1981 period. Taylor sang it from the drums while Mercury played piano and provided backing vocals. It was played in the Queen + Paul Rodgers Tour in 2005 and the Rock the Cosmos Tour in 2008. Taylor would again play the song for his concerts with the Cross and solo tours, where instead of drums he played rhythm guitar.

====&quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot;====
&quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot; was the second song and first Queen single to be written by John Deacon. He composed it while he was learning to play piano, and played the Wurlitzer electric piano (which Mercury disliked) on the recording and overdubbed the bass guitar afterwards. The song was written for his wife, Veronica. It was released as the album&#x27;s second single after &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and was also a top 10 hit in the UK, reaching number 7.

====&quot;&#x27;39&quot;====
&quot;&#x27;39&quot; was May&#x27;s attempt to do a &#x27;lover&#x27;s pirate shanty.&#x27; It relates the tale of a group of space explorers who embark on what is, from their perspective, a year-long voyage. Upon their return, however, they realise that a hundred years have passed, because of the time dilation effect in Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity, and the loved ones they left behind are now all dead or aged. May sings the song on the album, with backing vocals by Mercury and Taylor. During live performances, Mercury sang the lead vocal. May had asked Deacon to play double bass as a joke but a couple of days later he found Deacon in the studio with the instrument, and he had already learned to play it. George Michael performed &quot;&#x27;39&quot; at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert on 20 April 1992. Michael cited this song as his favourite Queen song, claiming he used to busk it on the London Underground. Recently, Queen have included the song on the setlists of their recent tours with Adam Lambert and before Lambert with Paul Rodgers; for all these tours since 2005 it is sung, as it is on the album, by May.

====&quot;Sweet Lady&quot;====
&quot;Sweet Lady&quot; is a fast rocker written by May. The song is an unusual rock style in meter (which gives way to at the bridge).

====&quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;====
&quot;Seaside Rendezvous&quot;, written by Mercury, has a mock-instrumental bridge section which begins at around 0:51 into the song. The section is performed entirely by Mercury and Taylor using their voices alone. Mercury imitates woodwind instruments including a clarinet and Taylor mostly brass instruments, including tubas and trumpets, and even a kazoo; during this section Taylor hits the highest note on the album, C6. The &quot;tap dance&quot; segment is performed by Mercury and Taylor on the mixing desk with thimbles on their fingers. Mercury plays both grand piano and jangle honky-tonk.

===Side two===
====&quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot;====
&quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot; was composed by May. He explained that he wrote the song after a dream he had had about The Great Flood and his fears about the human race and its general lack of empathy. He spent several days assembling the song, and it includes a vocal canon sung by Mercury. The vocal, and later instrumental canon was produced by early tape delay devices. Over eight minutes long, it is also Queen&#x27;s longest studio song. The speed-up effect that happens in the middle of the guitar solo was achieved by starting a reel-to-reel player with the tape on it, as the original tape player was stopped.

====&quot;Love of My Life&quot;====
&quot;Love of My Life&quot; is one of Queen&#x27;s most covered songs (there have been versions by many acts like Extreme featuring May, Scorpions and Elaine Paige). Mercury played piano (including a classical solo) and sang all vocals, including multi-tracked harmonies. May played harp (doing it chord by chord and pasting the takes to form the entire part), Gibson Hummingbird acoustic guitar (which he had bought in Japan) and his Red Special. May eventually arranged the song so it could be played on an acoustic 12 string for live performances. &quot;Love of My Life&quot; was such a concert favourite that Mercury frequently stopped singing and allowed the audience to take over. It was especially well received during concerts in South America, and the band released the song as a single there. When Queen and Paul Rodgers performed the song (specifically Brian solo) he sang almost none of the words and let the audience sing it all, continuing the tradition. When Queen and Adam Lambert performed it, Brian would play along to a projection of Freddie singing. When they performed with Paul Rodgers during 2004–2008, Mercury was also projected during the show, but not in a round display as they use with Adam Lambert.

====&quot;Good Company&quot;====
&quot;Good Company&quot; was written and sung by May, who sings all vocals and plays ukulele. The recording features a recreation of a Dixieland-style jazz band using May&#x27;s Red Special guitar and Deacy Amp. May composed the song on his father&#x27;s banjo ukulele, but recorded the song with a regular ukulele. Mercury was not involved with the song&#x27;s recording, making it one of the few Queen songs not to feature their lead singer.

====&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;====

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was written by Mercury with the first guitar solo composed by May. All piano, bass and drum parts, as well as the vocal arrangements, were thought up by Mercury on a daily basis and written down &quot;in blocks&quot; (using note names instead of sheets) on a phonebook. During the recording, the song became affectionately known as &quot;Fred&#x27;s Thing&quot; to the band, and the title only emerged during the final sessions. The other members recorded their respective instruments with no concept of how their tracks would be utilised in the final mix.

The operatic section was originally intended to be only a short interlude of &quot;Galileos&quot; that connected the ballad and hard rock portions of the song. The interlude is full of &quot;obscure classical characters: Scaramouche, a clown from the &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;; astronomer Galileo; Figaro, the principal character in Beaumarchais&#x27; &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;; and Beelzebub, identified in the Christian New Testament as Satan, Prince of Demons, but in Arabic as &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. Also in Arabic the word &quot;Bismillah&#x27;,&quot; which is a noun from a phrase in the Qur&#x27;an; &quot;&quot;Bismi-llahi r-rahmani r-rahiim&quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful&quot;.

Despite being twice as long as the average single in 1975 and garnering mixed critical reviews initially, the song became immensely popular, topping charts worldwide (where it remained for a then unprecedented nine weeks in the UK) and is widely regarded as one of the greatest songs in music history. The song was rereleased as a double A-side to &quot;These Are the Days of Our Lives&quot; on 5 September 1991, Mercury&#x27;s 45th birthday, in the US and on 9 December 1991, after Mercury&#x27;s death, in the UK.

====&quot;God Save the Queen&quot;====
May recorded a version of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the British national anthem, on 27 October 1974 at Trident Studios before their &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; tour. He played a guide piano which was edited out later and added several layers of guitars. After the song was completed it was played as a coda at virtually every Queen concert. When recording the track May played a rough version on piano for Roy Thomas Baker, producer, and Mike Stone, engineer. He called his own skills on the piano sub-par at the time. He performed the song live on the roof of Buckingham Palace for the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 2002. May has stated that he performed the song on the roof of Buckingham Palace as a homage to Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s version of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

==Release==

The album title was inspired by the Marx Brothers film of the same name, which the band had watched during recording sessions. Subsequently, they became good friends with the film&#x27;s star Groucho Marx, to the point where Marx sent the band a letter praising their 1976 album &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;. Marx also invited Queen to visit him at his Los Angeles home in March 1977 (five months before he died). The band thanked him, and performed &quot;&#x27;39&quot; a cappella. The cover artwork features the band&#x27;s logo, which was designed by Mercury, on a white background. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, featured a similar design but on a black background.

&quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; was released as the lead single on 31 October 1975, with &quot;I&#x27;m in Love with My Car&quot; as its B-side. Their management initially refused to release it; however, Kenny Everett played a copy of the song on his show 14 times, at which point audience demand for the song intensified and the band&#x27;s label EMI was forced to release it. It subsequently topped the UK charts for nine weeks and peaked at number nine in the US. A second single, &quot;You&#x27;re My Best Friend&quot; was released on 18 June 1976, with &quot;&#x27;39&quot; as its B-side. It reached number sixteen in the US and number seven in the UK.

The album was completed a week before the group were to embark on their A Night at the Opera Tour in support of the album. This resulted in a 36-hour mixing session, as the group wanted to have time to rehearse their setlist before touring. Due to time constraints, the group only had three and a half days to rehearse, at Elstree, with four hours taken off to shoot the music video for &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. The tour spanned 1975 and 1976, and covered the UK, the US, Japan, and Australia.

===Re-releases===
The album was first re-released in the U.S. by Hollywood Records on 3 September 1991 with two bonus remixes, as part of a complete re-release of all Queen albums.

On 30 April 2002, the album was again re-released on DVD-Audio with a 96 kHz/24bit Linear PCM stereo mix and a 5.1-channel mix in DTS 96/24 surround sound for standard DVD-Video players and 96 kHz/24bit MLP surround sound for DVD-Audio capable machines. It also includes the original 1975 video of Bohemian Rhapsody.

On 21 November 2005, it was once more re-released by Hollywood Records Catalogue Number 2061-62572-2 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the album and its first single, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. This release is accompanied by a DVD-Video disc with the same track listing featuring the original videos, old and new concert footage (including &quot;&#x27;39&quot; from the Queen + Paul Rodgers tour and Brian May on the roof of Buckingham Palace playing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;) and audio commentary by all four band members.

On 8 November 2010, record company Universal Music announced a remastered and expanded reissue of the album set for release in May 2011. This as part of a new record deal between Queen and Universal Music, which meant Queen&#x27;s association with EMI Records came to an end after almost 40 years. According to Universal Music, all Queen albums were to be remastered and reissued in 2011. By September 2012 the reissue program was completed. Along with this came a 5.1 channel release of the album on Blu-ray Audio.

==Reception==
===Contemporary critical reaction===
&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; received very positive reviews in the UK music magazines, although some of them had to review the album without preview copies because the band were mixing the album until the last moment. Tony Stewart of &quot;NME&quot; opined that &quot;More than anything else, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is a consolidation of the previous album&#x27;s success in skilfully engineering this balance between artistry and effectology. Throughout the album, they display their individual songwriting abilities and musicianship to devastating effect.&quot; Stewart described &quot;Sweet Lady&quot; as an &quot;awful rock number&quot; which &quot;mars an otherwise excellent set&quot;, and concluded, &quot;If it&#x27;s the most expensive album ever made in a British studio, it&#x27;s also arguably the best.&quot; In &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Harry Doherty called the album &quot;easily their best work to date&quot; and wrote that the band had &quot;used studio gadgetry to the fullest effect, but they&#x27;ve also used it to the best advantage&quot;. He stated that &quot;Queen could well set out a future direction in British rock and roll. They&#x27;re hard rock, but just commercial enough to capture a massive, wide-ranging audience.&quot; Doherty&#x27;s conclusion was that &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was &quot;with Roxy Music&#x27;s &quot;Siren&quot; the best rock album I&#x27;ve heard this year&quot;.

In &quot;Record Mirror&quot; &amp; &quot;Disc&quot;, Ray Fox-Cumming attempted to review the album based on a single listening at the playback party held for the press, which he admitted &quot;isn&#x27;t really enough&quot; to form a proper critical opinion. However, he described his first impressions of &quot;an amazing rush of music with one track running helter-skelter into the next ... The orchestral effects, all done by voices, are dazzling but come and go too quickly to appreciate on a solo listening.&quot; Fox-Cumming stated that the album had three highlights – &quot;Death on Two Legs&quot;, &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot; and &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; – and only one bad track, &quot;Sweet Lady&quot;. He concluded that &quot;as a whole, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; is faster, flashier and more complex than &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot;, but they haven&#x27;t gone over the top&quot;. Phil Sutcliffe of &quot;Sounds&quot; reviewed the album from a cassette copy, and gave it a five-star review: &quot;You can feel the colossal effort that went into every second of this long album – and yet there&#x27;s a hardly a moment when I would criticise it for being contrived or overproduced.&quot; He singled out &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; and &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&quot; as the two tracks that &quot;make a good album extraordinary&quot;, despite stating that the latter song&#x27;s lyrics were &quot;not appealing&quot;, and overall highlighting the album&#x27;s &quot;musical range power and consistently incisive lyrics&quot;.

In the US, Kris Nicholson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that although they share other heavy metal groups&#x27; penchant for &quot;manipulating dynamics&quot;, Queen are an elite act in the genre and set themselves apart by incorporating &quot;unlikely effects: acoustic piano, harp, a capella vocals, no synthesisers. Coupled with good songs.&quot; Robert Christgau, writing in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, felt that the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t actually botch any of a half-dozen arty-to-heavy &#x27;eclectic&#x27; modes ... and achieves a parodic tone often enough to suggest more than meets the ear. Maybe if they come up with a coherent masterwork I&#x27;ll figure out what that more is.&quot; The &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; wrote: &quot;The group&#x27;s potential is practically limitless, indicating that Queen is destined to finally take its place among the small handful of truly major acts working in rock today.&quot;

===Legacy===
In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album &quot;a self-consciously ridiculous and overblown hard rock masterpiece&quot; and &quot;prog rock with a sense of humour as well as dynamics&quot;. Erlewine felt that Queen &quot;never bettered their approach anywhere else&quot;. Progressive rock historian Stephen Lambe has disputed that the album itself is progressive rock in his book &quot;Citizens of Hope and Glory: The Story of Progressive Rock&quot;. He wrote: &quot;While far from progressive rock, it was the band&#x27;s most grandiose and ambitious album yet, full of great songwriting and prog influences.&quot; He said the album was &quot;a neat symbol of the furthest reach of the progressive rock movement&quot;.

Reviewing the album&#x27;s reissue in 1992, &quot;Mojo&quot; called it &quot;an imperial extravaganza, a cornucopia&quot;, and Queen &quot;a band of hungrily competitive individualists on a big roll of friendship and delight&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Greg Kot gave the album a very positive rating, stating how he believed that alongside &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was when &quot;the band hit its artistic peak, with sterling contributions from all four band members&quot;.

In 2004, Jason Warburg of the &quot;Daily Vault&quot; stated that the album &quot;absolutely blew me away&quot; and that &quot;&quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was the disc that would catapult Queen from British hitmakers to global superstars. As with many such landmark albums it became part milestone and part millstone, with every album that followed compared in some way or another to the musical and commercial success they achieved here. Be that as it may, the music is what counts – and it is simply amazing.&quot; &quot;Grooves&quot; noted that &quot;Sharp operatic interludes, abrupt rhythmic changes, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; defies convention and places Queen in that rarefied circle of genuine superstars.&quot;

In a 2006 review, Paul Rees of &quot;Q&quot; observed that although &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was &quot;released the same year as both Bowie&#x27;s arch soul pastiche &quot;Young Americans&quot; and the sleek art rock of Roxy&#x27;s &quot;Siren&quot;, it has rarely been heralded as either. Yet it was, and is, every bit as brash, bold and full of the joys of its own possibilities.&quot; Feeling that Queen &quot;never came close to bettering their fourth album&quot;, Rees concluded that &quot;later albums would expose the lack of soul at the heart of Queen&#x27;s music; they were all surface, no feeling. They elected themselves the great entertainers, and this heady rush of experimentation was not to be repeated. But &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; remains glorious, monumental. It is British rock&#x27;s greatest extravagance.&quot; In 2007, Chris Jones of BBC Music noted the diverse range of musical styles on the album, saying, &quot;&quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; had hinted at a working knowledge of 19th century parlour balladry, 20s ragtime and Jimi Hendrix. &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was to add opera, trad jazz, heavy metal and more to the mix.&quot; He concluded that the album &quot;remains their finest hour&quot;.

In 2011, digitally remastered versions of the earlier Queen albums were released, prompting another batch of reviews. &quot;Uncut&quot; said that the album &quot;proved there was no limit to their capabilities&quot; and concluded, &quot;Containing not one but two monumental epics (&#x27;Bohemian Rhapsody&#x27;, &#x27;The Prophet&#x27;s Song&#x27;), and gorging on grandiose gestures galore, &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; secured itself instant classic status&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s Dominique Leone stated, &quot;No punches pulled, no expense spared: &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; was Queen at the top of the mountain&quot;. AJ Ramirez of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote, &quot;Kicking off with the downright ominous high-drama of &#x27;Death on Two Legs&#x27; (a retort against the group&#x27;s recently deposed management where Mercury spits out venomous invectives at the targets of his ire), the album gives way to a kaleidoscope of styles, from 1920 jazz to space-folk narratives to top-of-the-line contemporary pop-rock. Amazingly, while the transitions between genres would conceivably throw listeners for a loop, none are jarring. Instead, Queen succeeds because it pulls from all the best tricks in the library of showbiz history to deliver laughs, heartache, grandeur, and spectacle to its audience at precisely the right moments.&quot; He observed that &quot;it is the realization of such a unique sonic vision that pushes [the album] into the realm of true excellence ... &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; stands as a breathtaking, involving creation, and unequivocally Queen&#x27;s finest album.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 1977, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; received two Grammy Award nominations for Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus and Best Arrangement for Voices.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked it at number 230 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list, number 231 on its 2012 list, and number 128 on its 2020 list.

<doc id="670558" wikidata="Q383759" url="?curid=670558" title="Dhalsim">
<text>Dhalsim (; Japanese: , Hepburn: ) is a character in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series. He made his first appearance in &quot;Street Fighter II: The World Warrior&quot; in 1991. He sometimes goes by the alias &quot;long-arm&quot; and his fighting ability includes stretching his limbs. In the series, he is a mystical yogi who is loved by his villagers and family alike. He is also a pacifist who goes against his beliefs by entering the World Warrior tournament to raise money for his poor village. Throughout the series, Dhalsim is a character centered on morality and he has been noted for his other unique qualities.

==Conception and design==
1988 Capcom considered the idea of a sequel to their &quot;Street Fighter&quot; video game, and sketched out a basic concept and roster for the game, amongst them an Indian character. Called &quot;Great Tiger&quot;, the character appeared as a long-faced man with a turban who was able to double jump and breathe fire. While this iteration of the game was stopped in favor of working on &quot;Final Fight&quot;, when Capcom resumed work on &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, character designer Akira &quot;Akiman&quot; Yasuda revisited the concept when designing the character roster. Akiman started with two concepts for the character, India and yoga, and wanted to emphasize a stereotype to further make the character memorable. Several concepts were considered, including an elephant headed design modeled after the Hindu God Ganesh. However, sprite artist Takashi Hayashi used a sketch that had been done by fellow Capcom designer Yoshiaki Ohji.

At one point in development, it was considered to give the character a cloak he would remove before battle, but this was cut due to memory limitations. Dhalsim&#x27;s limbs and neck can stretch during battle to attack from range. Nishitani noted that while many comparisons were made to the Indian character in the martial arts film &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot;, he had not heard of the movie prior to working on the game and instead the concept was based on a technique from manga series &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;. Akiman elaborated in a later interview, calling the technique &quot;Zoom Punch&quot; in reference to one used by &quot;JoJo&quot; character Zeppeli. He add that originally the attack was only supposed to travel a short distance, however as development progressed Hayashi increased the length of the limbs more and more. Nishitani noted this was due to each developer wanting to make their character different than the others, and while he originally intended to shorten the length he was happy to have made it work in a balanced manner.

During the course of development, his name was &quot;Indo&quot; as a placeholder, then later Naradatta for a time. The character was finally named &quot;Dhalsim&quot;, which according to &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; game director Akira Nishitani in an interview with &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine, comes from &quot;Dhalsima&quot;, a martial artist from the India-Pakistani area. However, a rumor that the name was based in part on the name of a curry restaurant near Capcom&#x27;s old offices in Osaka was corroborated by Akiman in 2014.

===Design===
Akiman noted that sprite designers often added their own alterations to the concepts, and voiced approval for the dry, dehydrated appearance Hayashi brought to the character. Capcom producer Yoshinori Ono stated that regarding Dhalsim&#x27;s appearance, &quot;We only knew about [the rest of the world] through mostly TV and magazines&quot;, stating that when they thought of India they envisioned people &quot;walking around as thin as skin and bones, doing yoga&quot;. When redesigning his appearance for &quot;Street Fighter V&quot; however, they felt there was a disconnect between Dhalsim&#x27;s current design and how Hindu yoga practitioners were viewed, so they altered his design, adding a turban and beard as well as removing his emaciated appearance.

==Appearances==

===In video games===
In his Arcade Mode ending in &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, Dhalsim wins the tournament and returns home on his elephant Kodal. Three years later, Dhalsim&#x27;s son, Datta, discovers a photograph of his father from the tournament. From the original &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; and up until &quot;Super Street Fighter II&quot;, this ending graphic was drawn in a comical style. In &quot;Super Street Fighter II Turbo&quot;, it was changed to a more realistic style, with Dhalsim&#x27;s wife Sally (named Sari in the UDON comic book series) added alongside Datta.

Dhalsim would later appear in the &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; sub-series in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;. In his storyline in the &quot;Alpha&quot; games (which are set prior to the events of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;), Dhalsim attempts to hunt down an &quot;evil spirit&quot; (M. Bison) that is threatening the world. Dhalsim also appears in the &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot; sub-series, beginning with the console-exclusive version, &quot;Street Fighter EX Plus α&quot;, followed by &quot;Street Fighter EX2&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter EX3&quot;. His characterization and motivation are the same as they are in the previous &quot;Street Fighter&quot; game. Dhalsim later appears in &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, and has also appeared as a playable character in several crossover fighting games, which include: &quot;X-Men vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot;, &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot;, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot;, &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot;, &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;. He makes a special appearance in &quot;Street Fighter X Mega Man&quot;. Dhalsim also appears as an enemy character in the Sega arcade game, &quot;Juezhan Tianhuang&quot;.

===Gameplay===
His fighting style is a Yoga-based style, in which Dhalsim can stretch his arms, legs, abdomen and even his neck to great lengths making him a decent long-range hand-to-hand fighter. He also uses many fire-based attacks such as &quot;Yoga Fire&quot;, &quot;Yoga Flame&quot; and &quot;Yoga Blast&quot;, the latter being an anti-air technique. His super move in the &quot;Street Fighter EX&quot;, Cross Over and later Alpha Series was the &quot;Yoga Inferno&quot;, which was a multi-hitting flamethrower-style attack that could be directed manually. Dhalsim also uses a teleportation technique known as the &quot;Yoga Teleport&quot;. In &quot;Street Fighter EX3&quot;, he gains a tag-team super move when paired with Blanka. In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; he uses the ultra combo move &quot;Yoga Catastrophe&quot;, as a large fireball which slowly moves toward and deals multi-damage on impact on any opponent, before using a super &quot;Yoga Inferno&quot;.

According to Akiman, Dhalsim&#x27;s gameplay was meant to tie into the idea of India being &quot;mysterious&quot;, and make them feel like totally normal activities within the &quot;mysteries of Yoga.&quot;

===In other media===
In &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;, the UDON comic book series, and &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, Dhalsim is a wise and powerful mystic who has mastered the inner mysteries of Yoga. In the comic, he helps prepare Sagat for his bout with Ryu and helps Ryu himself discover the darkness within his soul. Later on he is given an invitation to M. Bison&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; global fighting tournament, wherein he defeats Adon in the preliminaries with ease.

In the anime series &quot;Street Fighter II V&quot;, Dhalsim is a monk who lives in a remote village in India. Sagat had earlier instructed Ryu to seek Dhalsim for advice about the Ways of Hadou. Sagat had been turned down years before when he sought Dhalsim&#x27;s wisdom but figured that Ryu might be found more worthy. Dhalsim is a practitioner of yoga and has some psychic abilities, and although he knows much about Hadou, he was unable to train Ryu to use the Hadouken, which was inadvertently triggered in Ryu&#x27;s body during a lesson. Dhalsim is voiced by Shōzō Iizuka in the Japanese version and Steve Blum in the English dub by Animaze/Manga Entertainment.

Dhalsim has a brief appearance in &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;, where he fights E. Honda in India. Though he gains the upper hand with his telekinetic abilities, he is distracted when he senses another nearby power, long enough for Honda to overpower him. He subsequently withdraws from the fight, giving Honda the victory, and apparently later points Ryu out to Honda, enabling him to give Ryu half the winnings out of gratitude.

Dhalsim also appears briefly in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot; as one of several fighters accompanying Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li to Professor Sadler&#x27;s base to rescue Ryu&#x27;s alleged younger brother, Shun. As the fighters demonstrate their skills to Sadler, Dhalsim fights Guy, avoiding Guy&#x27;s attack by teleporting himself away to presumably strike Guy from behind. When Sadler&#x27;s true intentions are revealed, Dhalsim and the other fighters are freed by Ken and Chun-Li.

Dhalsim is portrayed by British actor Roshan Seth in 1994&#x27;s live action film &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. The film depicts Dhalsim as an Indian scientist and doctor whose science was originally supposed to promote peace, only for Bison to capture him and force him to aid him in his evil ambitions, one of which is the &quot;supersoldier&quot; experiment meant to turn Carlos Blanka into a mutated beast. During the process, Dhalsim alters Blanka&#x27;s cerebral programming to keep him gentle and is found out by the lab guard. A fight ensues, in which Dhalsim is branded with the mutagen and almost killed, but Blanka is released and saves Dhalsim by killing the guard. When Guile arrives at the base, Dhalsim directs him to confront Bison. After Bison is defeated, Dhalsim decides to remain in Bison&#x27;s base along with Blanka to await its destruction, choosing to atone for his part in mutating Blanka, telling Guile that &quot;if good men do nothing, that is evil enough&quot;. In his final scenes, Dhalsim appears bald (having had a full head of hair earlier) with three rivulets of blood running down from the top of his head, as a nod to his appearance in the games.

Dhalsim is later featured in the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; animated series as part of Guile&#x27;s team. From the original roster of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; characters featured in the film, Dhalsim and T. Hawk are the only ones who do not appear as playable characters in the video game based on the film, &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. The opposite situation occurs with Akuma, who is a secret character in the game but does not appear in the film.

In the 1993 anime Ghost Sweeper Mikami, Episode 37 there is a background character that resembles Dhalsim and does the trademark &quot;Yoga Fire&quot; move.

==Reception==
In 1992, Dhalsim ranked at number five in the list of Best Characters of 1991 by the &quot;Gamest&quot; magazine in Japan.

Todd Ciolek of &quot;Topless Robot&quot; called him the most outlandish stereotype of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;″s cast, feeling the character was a &quot;joke at the expense of Indian culture&quot; and despite Capcom&#x27;s claims to the contrary felt it borrowed heavily from &quot;Master of the Flying Guillotine&quot;. Sidney Fussell of &quot;Boing Boing&quot; cited Dhalsim as an example of &quot;black magic&quot; mystical characters occasionally being a way to enforce negative stereotypes and caricatures, and decontextualizes his religion. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; also voiced disdain for Dhalsim in a different way, feeling that while the concept had merit, he was a &quot;bargain basement wise man who never really does much with it&quot; outside of a select few moments in related &quot;Street Fighter&quot; media.

The book &quot;Game Design Perspectives&quot; notes Dhalsim as an example of a &quot;nemesis character&quot; in video games, one difficult to master proper usage of but widely considered one of the strongest characters in the game.

<doc id="670560" wikidata="Q4788638" url="?curid=670560" title="Area codes 705, 249, and 683">
<text>Area codes 705, 249, and 683 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for most of northeastern and central Ontario in Canada. Area code 705 was created in a 1956 area code split from portions of the 613 and 519 numbering plan areas. After a reduction in geographic coverage in 1962, the numbering plan area was assigned a second area code, 249, in 2011 to form an overlay numbering plan. A third area code, 683, was added in June 2022.

==History==
Ontario received two area codes, 416 and 613, in the initial configuration of the first continental telephone numbering plan in 1947. Area code 416, in the southern part of the province, was split in 1953 to form area code 519 in the western part of the province. In 1956, area code 705 was created from portions of the 613 and 519 numbering plan areas and served nearly all of Ontario north and west of the Golden Horseshoe. In 1962, the resulting numbering plan area was reduced in geographic extent by splitting off a portion with area code 807 for northwestern Ontario. Area code 705 was in danger of exhaustion, but creating a new area code was need to improve call routing from Manitoba and the rest of Western Canada to northwestern Ontario.

On March 19, 2011, the remaining 705 numbering plan area area was assigned a second area code, 249, with the configuration of an overlay plan. Since then, all calls have required ten-digit dialling.

The Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium had considered &quot;erasing&quot; the 807-705 boundary and turning 807 into an overlay for all of northern Ontario, which would have effectively reversed the 1962 split, but did not recommend the idea for fear of potential confusion.

The incumbent local exchange carriers in 705/249 are Bell Canada, Northern Telephone, Bell Aliant (Ontera), Eastlink, and some municipally-owned carriers.

In February 2017, area code 683 was reserved as a third area code for the numbering plan area, After further debate, it was decided to activate 683 as a third overlaid area code for this region, effective June 18, 2022. with an in-service activation date of June 18, 2022. 

Area code 460 was reserved as a fourth area code for the region in November 2022.

<text>Bernhard Lichtenberg (; 3 December 1875 – 5 November 1943) was a German Catholic priest known for his outspoken opposition to the Nazi regime’s persecution of Jews and other marginalized groups during the Holocaust. He became a notable symbol of religious liberty for his public condemnation of the Nazi government’s policies, including from the pulpit of St. Hedwig’s Cathedral in Berlin. Despite widespread fear and suppression, Lichtenberg openly called for justice and the humane treatment of Jewish citizens, underscoring the moral responsibilities of religious leaders under totalitarian regimes.

Lichtenberg was arrested and imprisoned for his activism and later died in Gestapo custody while being transported to Dachau concentration camp. His death further cemented his reputation as a martyr for religious freedom and human rights. Raul Hilberg wrote: &quot;Thus a solitary figure had made his singular gesture. In the buzz of rumormongers and sensation seekers, Bernhard Lichtenberg fought almost alone.&quot;

In 1996, Lichtenberg was beatified by the Catholic Church for his steadfast faith and moral courage. He was also recognized as Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in 2004 for his efforts to aid Jews during the Holocaust, making him one of the few individuals honored for moral resistance across both religious and cultural communities.

==Early life and education==
Lichtenberg was born in Ohlau (now Oława), Prussian Silesia, near Breslau (now Wrocław), the second of five children. He studied theology in Innsbruck, Austria-Hungary. He also studied in Breslau and was ordained in 1899.

==Ministry==
===Appointments===
Lichtenberg began his ministry in Berlin in 1900, as the pastor of Charlottenburg. He served as a military chaplain during World War I. During the period of 1913–1930, he was a minister at the cathedral Herz-Jesu-Gemeinde (Sacred Heart) in Charlottenburg, Berlin. In 1932, the Bishop of Berlin appointed him as a canon of the Cathedral chapter of St. Hedwig.

===Activism===
Lichtenberg&#x27;s encouragement of Catholics to view a screening of the film version of Erich Maria Remarques&#x27; anti-war novel &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; prompted a vicious attack by Joseph Goebbels&#x27; paper &quot;Der Angriff&quot;. In 1933 the Secret State Police of Germany (&quot;Gestapo&quot;) had searched his house for the first time.

Active in the Centre Party, in 1935 he went to Hermann Göring to protest against the cruelties of the Esterwegen concentration camp.

Named provost of the cathedral, in 1938, Lichtenberg was put in charge of the Relief Office of the Berlin episcopate, which assisted many Catholics of Jewish descent in emigrating from the Third Reich. After Kristallnacht, the first organized Nazi pogrom in Germany, Lichtenberg warned at the Berlin Church of Saint Hedwig: &quot;The synagogue outside is burning, and that is also a house of God!&quot; Until his arrest in October 1941, Lichtenberg would pray publicly for the persecuted Jews at the daily Vespers service. Bishop Konrad von Preysing later entrusted him with the task of helping the Jewish community of the city.

He protested in person to Nazi officials against the arrest and killing of the sick and mentally ill, as well as the persecution of the Jews. At first, the Nazis dismissed the priest as a nuisance. Father Lichtenberg was warned that he was in danger of being arrested for his activities, but he continued nonetheless.

In 1941, Lichtenberg protested against the involuntary euthanasia programme by way of a letter to the chief physician of the Reich, Minister of Public Health Leonardo Conti (1900–1945): I, as a human being, a Christian, a priest, and a German, demand of you, Chief Physician of the Reich, that you answer for the crimes that have been perpetrated at your bidding, and with your consent, and which will call forth the vengeance of the Lord on the heads of the German people.

The euthanasia in the health institutions of Nazi Germany was purportedly stopped soon after the church protests against euthanasia headed by the bishops Clemens August Graf von Galen and Theophil Wurm. &quot;Nazi leaders faced the prospect of either having to imprison prominent, highly admired clergymen and other protesters – a course with consequences in terms of adverse public reaction they greatly feared – or else end the programme&quot;.

===Arrest and imprisonment===

Lichtenberg was arrested on 23 October 1941 and sentenced to two years in prison for violation of the Pulpit Law and the Treachery Act of 1934. He asked to accompany Jews to the East in order to provide comfort there. Because he was considered incorrigible, he was picked up in 1943 by the Gestapo to be taken to the Dachau concentration camp. He fell ill and died of pneumonia in hospital in Hof, Bavaria.

==Veneration==

On 23 June 1996, Pope John Paul II declared Lichtenberg and Karl Leisner blessed martyrs. The beatification ceremony took place during a Mass celebrated in the Olympic Stadium in Berlin. The date of his death, November 5 was designated as the liturgical memorial day of Bernard Lichtenberg by Pope John Paul II.

Lichtenberg&#x27;s tomb is situated in the crypt of St. Hedwig&#x27;s Cathedral in Berlin. After the war, the building with the office of the archbishop of Berlin was named Bernhard Lichtenberg house. In the memorial area of the former Esterwegen Concentration Camp, a memorial plaque was installed to honor Lichtenberg for his activities for the prisoners of the camp.

In the historic center of the town of Hof, the area in front of St. Mary&#x27;s church has been named Bernhard-Lichtenberg-Platz since 2013 and on the initiative of pastor Hans-Jürgen Wiedow, a new parish center named after Bernhard Lichtenberg was constructed in 2016/17 under the St. Konrad&#x27;s church in the town.

On 7 July 2004, Yad Vashem recognized Bernhard Lichtenberg as a Righteous Among the Nations.

<doc id="670569" wikidata="Q297134" url="?curid=670569" title="Hipólito Yrigoyen">
<text>Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Yrigoyen (12 July 1852 – 3 July 1933) was an Argentine politician of the Radical Civic Union who served as President of Argentina from 1916 to 1922 and again from 1928 until his overthrow in 1930. He was the first president elected democratically by means of the secret and mandatory male suffrage established by the Sáenz Peña Law of 1912. His activism was the prime impetus behind the passage of that law in Argentina.

Known as &quot;the father of the poor&quot;, Yrigoyen presided over a rise in the standard of living of Argentina&#x27;s working class together with the passage of a number of progressive social reforms, including improvements in factory conditions, regulation of working hours, compulsory pensions, and the introduction of a universally accessible public education system. Yrigoyen was the first nationalist president, convinced that the country had to manage its own currency and, above all, it should have control of its transportation and its energy and oil exploitation networks.

Between the 1916 general election and the 1930 coup d&#x27;état, political polarization was on the rise. Personalist radicalism was presented as the &quot;authentic expression of the nation and the people&quot; against the &quot;oligarchic and conservative regime&quot;. For the ruling party, the will of the majorities prevailed over the division of powers. The opposition, on the other hand, accused the Executive Branch of being arrogant and demanded greater participation from Congress, especially in matters such as the conflictive federal interventions.

== Early life ==
Juan Hipólito del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús Yrigoyen was born on 12 July 1852, a few months after the Battle of Caseros. He was baptized four years later, on 19 October 1856 in the church of Nuestra Señora de Piedad.

His father, Martín Yrigoyen Dodagaray, was a Basque-French immigrant who in 1847 married Marcelina Alén Ponce, daughter of Leandro Antonio Alén (who was also the father of Leandro N. Alem), a member of the Mazorca during the government of Juan Manuel de Rosas who would be shot and hanged in the Plaza de Mayo.

During his youth, Yrigoyen lived in a house in the neighborhood of Balvanera and had four siblings: Roque, Martín, Amalia, and Marcelina. In 1861, at the age of nine, he entered the San José of Buenos Aires School, run by the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Jesus of Betharram, although he continued his studies at the School of South America, where his uncle Leandro N. Alem was a professor of philosophy. Yrigoyen was not a standout student, though he did demonstrate an introspective personality. Early on, he had an inclination towards studying to be a priest, though he soon began to study law instead. For some time, Yrigoyen and Alem shared a household, and the latter tried to introduce his nephew to Freemasonry.

At fifteen years old, Yrigoyen paused his studies to help his father, who had acquired a fleet of trolleys to work in the port. He worked for a short time in a store and also had a job in the trolley. At his young age, he had already had extensive though diverse work experience.

In 1867, he worked at a judicial office that Leandro Alem and Aristóbulo del Valle shared.

According to researcher Roberto Etchepareborda, his original last name – as opposed to Bernardo de Irigoyen – was , in Standard Basque, which means &quot;city of the high&quot;. In the French Basque country, the &quot;h&quot; is pronounced as it is in English, while in the Spanish Basque country, it is not pronounced, which is why the surname Hirigoyen probably has its origin in France, while its variants ( and ) have their origins in Spain. 
Formerly, Spanish orthography used for uppercase .

The radical leader used &quot; and &quot; interchangeably. The use of &quot; was a political tool used in the 1920s. Gabriel del Mazo, leader of the (FORJA), recommended he use &quot; as opposed to &quot;&quot;, which Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear&#x27;s sectors used.

== Early political career ==

When he finished his secondary education in 1869, along his with his uncle Leandro N. Alem, he began his political life as a member of the Autonomist Party, led by Adolfo Alsina, a party with a popular base that faced off with the National Party of Bartolomé Mitre. In his participation in the Electoral Club, he demanded free suffrage, division of rural property, and reform of the judicial power, among other measures.

In 1870, he entered public administration as a scribe for the General Accounts of the Office of Balances and Information, though he did not remain at this job for very long. Two years later, when Alem was elected provincial deputy, Yrigoyen, twenty years old, was named Police Commissioner of Balvanera thanks to the influence of his uncle, and placed in charge of Section 14. Meanwhile, he continued his studies in law and in March 1874 finished his fourth year, while also participating in the revolution that took place that year led by Bartolomé Mitre. In 1877, Alem, Artistóbulo del Valle, and Yrigoyen, in protest of Adolfo Alsina&#x27;s tendencies towards Mitre&#x27;s party, formed the Republican Party, which proposed del Valle as a candidate and positioned itself in opposition to any agreements between leaders of Alsina&#x27;s party and Mitre&#x27;s pitre. The internal conflict ended with the expulsion of Yrigoyen from his police duties in 1877. In 1878, at 25 years old, he was elected Provincial Deputy for the Republican Party and sat on the Budget Committee, but his term ended in 1880 as a result of the Federalization of Buenos Aires. That year he was named general administrator of Stamps and Patents, though he did not remain long in that position either. Upon the federalization of Buenos Aires and the arrival of Julio A. Roca to the presidency, Alem resigned from his position as Deputy in protest against the federalization and left politics, allowing Yrigoyen, who was not opposed to the new law, to be elected Deputy to the National Congress. This was the first discrepancy that emerged between the two. In 1878, he ended his studies, having never completed his thesis. Three years later, a new law was passed that eliminated the requirement for a thesis to become a lawyer in such a way that Yrigoyen was able to graduate.

He began to work as a professor of Argentina history, civic instruction, and philosophy in 1880, and the Normal School for Teachers, though he was first named President of the Balvanera School Council by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, then president of the National Council of Education. He taught these subjects for around twenty-four years, until he was expelled by President Manuel Quintana as a result of the Revolution of 1905, led by Yrigoyen. Despite the unfavorable economic situation, he donated his salary of 150 pesos to the Children&#x27;s Hospital and the Asylum for Defenseless Children. Testimonies from the time signal that he was not a good professor, but his method is of particular interest: he gave his own students responsibility over the classes while he acted as a moderator and observer. By 1882, Yrigoyen had finished his classes in theory at the University of Buenos Aires Law School. At this time, through the Spanish Krausists Julián Sanz del Río and Francisco Giner de los Ríos, he discovered the works of philosopher Karl Krause, who influenced his thinking considerably.

During the 1880s, he began a series of rural projects that would give him great economic wealth. He purchased and rented estancias in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and San Luis, and fattened cattle to sell them to refrigeration businesses. These activities not only earned him great wealth, but also landholdings of his own. In total he owned almost 25 leagues of land. He was the owner of Estancia El Trigo, near Las Flores, one of the best shepherding lands in the country; Seña de Anchorena in the province of San Luis; and El Quemado, near General Alvear. Thanks to his business experience, Yrigoyen had direct contact with the people of the countryside – both &quot;creoles&quot; and &quot;gringos&quot; – and he became familiar with their problems and sentiments. In a few years, Yrigoyen had accumulated a considerable fortune, which was to help him achieve his political aspirations.

Yrigoyen never hosted anyone, not even his friends, at his estancias. He spent time working in the fields alongside his workers, and in his free time he would walk or read. When he became a more popular political personality, he would retreat to his estancias to rest. He advised his workers to buy small properties for their old age. The workers at Yrigoyen&#x27;s estancias received higher salaries then was typical for the time, and they received a share of the earnings, in proportion to the work and responsibility of each employee, and he would regularly give his workers articles of clothing. He collected a fortune of several million pesos, which he used almost entirely to fund his political activity, to the point that he was in debt when he died.

The 1880s marked the consolidation of a landowning elite and commercial sector, tied together in a balance guaranteed by President Roca, first from within the government, and later from outside. The agreement between these distinct dominant sectors brought about the exclusion of any organized opposition. In this context, the opposition formed a new party, dissolving the Civic Union of the Youth and forming the new Civic Union in 1890, emerging from a heterogeneous movement linked together by the ideology of suffragism and the fight against Roca&#x27;s regime. Following the success of the meeting held in the Florida Garden on 1 September 1889, which helped popularize Leandro N. Alem among the youth of Buenos Aires, and though he was retired from political life since the 1880s, he helped plan the Revolution of the Park. Yrigoyen hesitated to join the movement at first since he believed the fight was not against a person (President Miguel Juárez Celman), but rather against a whole system. But prior to the revolution of 1890, he was pressured to join the movement and quickly became the Chief of Police of the Provisional Government. But the movement would be quickly repressed by the government, and the pacts between the more conservative factions of the Civic Union collapsed due to a deep internal crisis. This led to the rupture of the Civic Union on 26 June 1891, forming two new parties: the National Civic Union, led by Bartolomé Mitre and in favor of negotiating with Roca&#x27;s party, and the Radical Civic Union (&quot;Unión Civica Radical,&quot; UCR), led by Alem and radically opposed to Roca. That same year, Yrigoyen was named head of the Radical Committee of the Province of Buenos Aires, and in March 1881, he was named head of the Department of Argentine History Civic Instruction at the Normal School for Teachers. The five-year stint at this position influenced Yrigoyen notably, giving him a more global vision.

In 1889, Yrigoyen moved into a house of his own, facing what is today Plaza Congreso in the City of Buenos Aires, on the street that is now named after him, on the 1600 block. Just prior to this move, his brother, Roque, died after suffering a long illness. That event prompted him to close himself off to the world even more, a state in which he suffered a religious crisis. Little is known about this, due to his reserved nature. During his brother&#x27;s illness, Yrigoyen befriended two of his brother&#x27;s friends, Carlos Pellegrini and Roque Sáenz Peña, who would play significant roles in the institutional changes that would eventually bring Hipólito Yrigoyen to the presidency.

== Armed rebellion ==

On 10 April 1892, Luis Sáenz Peña was elected President of Argentina. One week before, President Carlos Pellegrini had declared a state of siege and, with the justification of a radical conspiracy, sent Leandro N. Alem to prison and practically all of the radical leaders were arrested over a period of two months, with the exception of Yrigoyen. In November of that year, the National Convention of the Civic Radical Union (UCR) was convened, in which Alem and Yrigoyen made a declaration that called for an armed uprising against the regime. The Convention approved a manifesto that labeled the source of the government&#x27;s power as &quot;based in fraud and violence&quot;. On 17 November, the Civic Radical Union issued its charter, the first document of its kind in the history of the party. This was the first in a series of events that began the new radical revolution.

On 29 July 1893, the governor of San Luis was overthrown by Juan Sáa, and on 31 July, after a day of bloody conflict, they took the city of Rosario. Meanwhile, in Buenos Aires, Yrigoyen decided to put his plan into practice. Several radical leaders left the city, heading towards the interior of the province, each one assigned a specific task to carry out the new rebellion. At his El Trigo estancia, he met with his friends and some of his workers, some sixty people in all, and they headed towards the Las Flores police station, which they took without resistance. He arrived in Temperley on the morning of 3 August alongside 1,200 men and established their encampment for the revolution, led and organized by Marcelo T. Alvear. The encampment housed as many as 2,800 armed citizens, who arrived in columns to take adjacent towns. On 4 August, the head of the rebellion created several battalions to defend the settlement in Temperley, whose forces had grown to 4,500 men, divided into eighteen battalions. Facing this situation, the governor resigned that same day. Two days later, the Committee of the Province was formed, with Yrigoyen presiding over it, and met in Lomas de Zamora with the attendance of some seventy members. Domingo Demaría requested Yrigoyen to be provisional governor of the province, but he denied emphatically, believing that he had participated in the revolution to end an illegal government, not to install another one. Before the insistence of his fellow revolutionaries, he told them, &quot;Neither provisional, nor definitive&quot;

After a crisis in the ministry that led to the resignation of several ministers, on 3 July 1893, Luis Sáenz Peña called on Aristóbulo del Valle, who had been retired from politics since the fracture of the Civic Union, to reorganize it. Del Valle first attempted to invite the UCR Committee to participate in the new ministry, to no avail. He then attempted to call on a number of radical figures to join some of the ministries, but they all forcefully rejected the offer. He came up with a plan to disarm the paramilitary forces that existed in several provinces that some governors were using to retain their power in their provinces. He also asked Congress to use federal intervention to replace the governors of Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and San Luis, which were the provinces mostly controlled by the oligarchy. Given his proximity to the government, del Valle could have staged a coup d&#x27;état, as Alem had asked him to, but his legal convictions stopped him from taking action even when it would mean the failure of the revolution.

On 8 August, a railway formation left from Temperley to take La Plata, the capital of the Province of Buenos Aires. Colonel Martín Yrigoyen, Hipólito&#x27;s brother, led 3,500 civilians who after some fighting overthrew Governor Carlos Costa and took the city of La Plata. Martín and Hipólito&#x27;s forces combined, and around 4,500 people marched between 13th and 44th street. The Yrigoyen brothers marched to the front of the revolutionary troop to an ovation from the people of La Plata. They decided to use the hippodrome near the train station as an encampment, bringing to an end the peaceful capture of La Plata. That same day, the Provincial Committee met in Lomas de Zamora to elect a provisional governor, Juan Carlos Begrano, who chose Marcelo T. de Alvear as his Minister of Public Works. The provisional government would only last nine days. When the national government sent troops to intervene, Belgrano did not resist and turned his power over to Eduardo Olivera. The national government designated Manuel Quintana as Minister of the Interior, who sent a powerful military force to defeat the revolution. On 25 August, the Committee of the Province officially announced that it would drop arms. Alem insisted on ordering a new uprising throughout the country, but Yrigoyen disagreed because he believed that Quintana would crush the revolution by any means necessary. This was the beginning of the dwindling of the relationship between the two leaders. By October, the revolution had been totally defeated. Yrigoyen was advised that he was to be arrested and when he left his house in the early morning, he was detained by the police force. This was the first time in his life that he was arrested. He was transferred to an old war boat and then to a pontoon that was holding several radical prisoners, where they suffered nausea from the poor hygienic conditions. Soon after, they were sent to Montevideo, Uruguay, the only foreign land to which Yrigoyen ever travelled, where they remained until December. He returned to Uruguay many years later after being overthrown.

It was just prior to this revolution that Yrigoyen met Alvear, more specifically when there was an opening for Chief of Police of the city of Buenos Aires. Artistóbulo del Valle proposed a relative of Alem, who had been commissioner. This is how he made contact with Alvear and other civic figures such as Le Breton, Apellániz, and Senillosa. Alvear and Yrigoyen would see each other at the Paris Café and at committee meetings. He would always hold a special appreciation for Alvear, even in the later years of the caudillo&#x27;s life, after the radical leaders had come into conflict with each other. As an anecdote about the two leaders, it can be mentioned that in 1897, Lisandro de la Torre challenged Yrigoyen to a fencing duel. Alvear had a few days to teach his friend the basics of fencing, since Yrigoyen had no knowledge of fencing and de la Torre was an expert. The duel took place on 6 September and Yrigoyen was able to achieve several touches on de la Torre&#x27;s face and won the duel. During his presidency, he would continue to practice fencing, a pastime that he never gave up, even in his 70s. In 1897, he joined the Jockey Club and went several times, and although he never set foot in the institution after 1900, he continued to be a member until his death.

On 1 July 1896, Leandro Alem committed suicide in the middle of the street. Aristóbulo del Valle had died prematurely in January of that year, leaving the leadership of the party to Yrigoyen. However, on the night of Alem&#x27;s wake, he announced that the loss of his uncle was too grave to be able to lead the party, and he asked those present to return to their provinces of origin until further notice.

When the National Convention of the UCR issued the so-called &quot;parallel policy&quot; on 6 September 1897, to hold elections with the &quot;mitristas&quot;, after a meeting UCR Provincial Committee meeting 29 September at Alvear&#x27;s house in which they voted to dissolve the committee in order to defeat the &quot;bernardistas,&quot; radicalism would enter a state of disorganization until the party&#x27;s reorganization in 1904. This was a total contradiction of the pact with the &quot;mitristas&quot; that the president of the National Committee, Bernardo de Iriogyen, had signed as a tactic to fight against Julio A. Roca during his second presidency in 1898.

== Revolution of 1905 ==
There were several signs in early February 1905 that a new radical revolution was coming, and in late January, the revolutionaries left for their destinations throughout the country to begin their revolt. However, both the government and the police suspected that there were plans of a conspiracy against them and so they broke into several buildings and arrested civilians who resorted to their weapons. Alarmed, General Smith, the Army Chief of Staff, headed to the armory to fortify his unit and defend the city&#x27;s arsenal. Thirty-three unarmed revolutionaries entered at 4 a.m. and were arrested when they asked for Martín Yrigoyen. The revolutionaries&#x27; failure to capture the arsenal reduced hope for the revolution, as the plan had been to arm civilians with weapons from the arsenal.

At 3:45, President Manuel Quintana arrived at the Governor&#x27;s Palace to convene an emergency meeting of his cabinet and declared a state of siege throughout the country. Successful uprisings took place in Bahía Blanca, Mendoza, Córdoba and Rosario, but the capital was kept under the government&#x27;s control. In Mendoza, the governor was deposed and José Néstor Lencinas, the head of the Revolutionary Junta, took the command of provisional governor. In Córdoba, an infantry led by Delfor Del Valle Vice President José Figueroa Alcorta, President Roca&#x27;s son Julio Argentino Pascual Roca, and several government leaders who happened to be in Córdoba. Del Valle attempted to capture President Roca, but he managed to escape to Santiago del Estero. In La Plata, there were rumors of suspected movements, but no revolution happensd there. Several revolutionary leaders escaped to Chile or Uruguay, but some, such as Delfor Del Valle, were captured when they tried to leave the country, and others turned themselves in. Some 70 civil prisoners were held on the naval ship &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; and confined into small spaces with poor living conditions. On 5 March, the state of siege was extended for 70 days, and the prisoners were quickly tried with punishments of up to eight years in prison, and on 2 May, they were sent on the &quot;Patria&quot; to a prison in Ushuaia.

Yrigoyen had maintained his anonymity during the last few weeks of the uprising. It was announced that at the end of February, he would appear at the Federal Court. On 28 February, there was a large crowd and significant police presence waiting for him, but he did not appear, and the government ended up exonerating him. Yrigoyen was able to support the leaders financially in exile because of the success of his estancias. A few months after the revolution ended, a civic association appeared, the Association of May, which started a pro-amnesty movement supported by the National Party of Uruguay. Yrigoyen began to run the association to gain freedom for the imprisoned revolutionaries, but that clashed with Quintana&#x27;s inflexibility. However, Quintana died in March 1906, and José Figueroa Alcorta became president from the modernist National Autonomist Party (PAN), which passed a law of amnesty proposed by former President Carlos Pellegrini among others. Yrigoyen met with President Figueroa Alcorta in 1907 and 1908 to try to convince him to call for corruption-free elections, but he found little success. Yrigoyen revealed the conversations in the Convention of 1909.

In the 1910 presidential elections, the modernist National Autonomist Party elected Roque Sáenz Peña as its candidate. Sáenz Peña was for establishing an election system that would put an end to electoral fraud, and he was not only a friend of Yrigoyen but also had cofounded the defunct Republican Party with Yrigoyen 30 years before.

== Path to electoral reform ==
The long-postponed political change began its process with the arrival to the presidency of Roque Sáenz Peña, an internal opponent of the National Autonomist Party. He focused all of his governmental management into passing a law to guarantee secret, universal, and mandatory elections for all citizens. After overcoming resistance from the conservatives, who were opposed to the exercise of total democracy, his plan became the so-called Sáenz Peña Law. The issue of suffrage was dealt with in three laws: Law Nº 4161, on 29 December 1902, which made possible the first representation of the Socialist Party; Law Nº 4578, on 24 July 1905, intended to calm that year&#x27;s revolution; and Nº 8871, the famous Sáenz Peña Law, passed on 10 February 1912. While this was predictable, the attitude of President Sáenz Peña is notable for attending to the demands of the people, knowing that it would gravely affect the dominance of the conservatives. It is worth mentioning, however, that the new law applied only to elections for national offices: president, vice-president, national deputies, and national senators. The rest of the elections would continue to be held according to the laws in each province. However, the governor of Santa Fe was replaced in 1912 by federal intervention, and the new governor organized elections for provincial governor and the provincial legislature in accord with the new electoral reform. The Radical Civic Union decided to participate and won the election, bringing to power Manuel Menchaca, the first Argentine governor to be elected in secret elections.

In early March 1916, the National Committee of the Radical Civic Union met to call a Convention, which would take place on 20 March at the &quot;Casa Suiza&quot;, with the attendance of 138 delegates. At the session, the committee designated a commission made up of delegates Vicente Gallo, José Camilo Crotto, Pelagio Luna, José Saravia, and Isaías Amado. At the same time, it named another commission, made up of Eudoro Vargas Gómez, Crotto, Luna, and Marcelo T. de Alvear, tasked with meeting with President Victorino de la Plaza with the goal of demanding a clean and free election. The following day, while the first commission was debating over whether to put the Constitution into effect after years of institutional disorder, the second commission that met with President De La Plaza did not return with encouraging news. That divided the opinions of the delegates, leading them to suspend the session to be continued on 22 March at Onrubia Theater, where they would also have to choose their candidates for president and vice-president.

Starting at eight in the morning, the theater was packed with people and taken over by nerves because although it was known that Yrigoyen would win unanimously, the delegates knew that he would not accept the candidacy. In regards to the vice-presidency, there were demands by the &quot;blue&quot; group to be on the ticket, and finally, Pelagio Luna, from La Rioja, was designated the vice-presidential candidate. At 10:30 am, the voting began: Yrigoyen received 150 votes, with two for Leopoldo Meto and one each for Alvear, Crotto, and Gallo. Crotto rejected the vote that he was given, standing by his position that only Yrigoyen could be the candidate. In the vice-presidential selection, Luna received 81 votes with Gallo receiving 59, and Joaquín Castellanos and Melo received one each. While the delegates waited for the acceptances of the candidacies, a demonstration gathered outside Yrigoyen&#x27;s house, but there is no indication that anyone was able to enter. Yrigoyen had gone to meet with the board of directors of the Convention in Crotto&#x27;s study on the Avenida de Mayo, where he declined to accept the candidacy. Crotto proposed to form a commission to meet with Yrigoyen with the goal of convincing him to accept the candidacy. The delegates Guido and Oyhanarte headed to the residency on Avenida Brasil 1039 and communicated to Yrigoyen that if he rejected the candidacy, it would be the end of the fight. At 6:30 pm, Yrigoyen accepted. The news prompted a celebration in front of the house on Avenida Brasil 1039.
== Presidential elections of 1916 ==
The presidential elections on 2 April 1916 were the first in the history of Argentina to adopt the Sáenz Peña Law, which guaranteed a secret and mandatory vote for men, and it is thus considered to have resulted in the first democratic government in the history of Argentina, with the clarification that the first completely democratic government was the second presidency of Juan Domingo Perón in 1951, when women were able to exercise their right to vote and be voted for.

The first effects of the law were unexpected for the reformers: radicals and socialists turned out in almost every corner of the country, with the exception of the Province of Buenos Aires, which was fervently controlled by the traditional political apparatus. The provincial parties that controlled the old regime failed in their attempt to form a new conservative political force.

The Hipólito Yrigoyen–Pelagio Luna ticket prevailed over the Conservative Party ticket (Ángel Rojas–Juan Eugenio Serú) in the popular vote with 339,332 votes, versus 153,406 votes for the Conservative Party. They also won in the Electoral College with 152 votes. The Congress was composed of 45 radicals and 75 opponents in the Chamber of Deputies; in the Senate there were only 4 radicals and 26 opponents. A total of eleven provinces were still being represented by members of the previous regime. After swearing in before the Legislative Assembly, the new president was literally carried by a deluge of people to the Casa Rosada, without any kind of security detail. Historian Luis Alberto Romero notes that something had truly changed when &quot;100,000 people accompanied the new president on his way from the Congress to the Palace of Government. The opponents were horrified by the presence of the &#x27;sandal-wearing riffraff&#x27;, a prejudice, certainly, but one that marked the beginning of a new age of democracy.&quot; When thirteen electors were needed for radicalism to triumph, the conservatives went to Santa Fe to try to persuade electors who were enemies with the party&#x27;s authorities. When Yrigoyen was asked about this, he said the famous quote, &quot;Let one thousand elections be lost before we sacrifice our principles.&quot;

The Spanish Ambassador to Argentina attended the event on behalf of his country and wrote the following for the newspaper &quot;La Época&quot;:In my diplomatic career I have attended famous celebrations in different European courts; I have been present for the ascent of a President of France and a King of England; I have seen popular spectacles extraordinary in number and enthusiasm. But I cannot remember anything comparable to the incredible scene of a Head of State thrown into the arms of his people, carried back and forth by the electrified crowd, to the high seat of honor of the first mandate of his homeland (...). But all that pales in comparison to the reality of the immense plaza, of the human ocean mad with joy, of the president dedicated to his people with his heart and soul, without guards, without an army, without police. Yrigoyen had suggested to President Figueroa Alcorta at the time to intervene in fourteen federal states where fraud was still in practice, and had been since the creation of the League of Governors, from which his primary mentors Miguel Ángel Juárez Celman and Julio Argentino Roca came. The federal interventions, called for &quot;civic hygiene&quot;, were carried out slowly by the executive branch in times of legislative recess. With the exception of the provinces governed by radicals who had come into power legitimately, the rest were put into power through intervention. The intervention&#x27;s goal was to call for legal elections and for the winners to become the new governor. In many districts, radicalism won, although in provinces such as Corrientes and San Luis, the conservatives prevailed, and in those cases the popular decision was respected. Additionally, were no interventions in the provinces of Santa Fe, Buenos, Aires, or Jujuy.

The electoral victory meant that, for the first time, a large social class that had until then been excluded from public office was running different state functions. This was the middle class, without great economic resources, nor connections to the upper classes. The presence of &quot;nameless&quot; civil servants was a subject of much satire in the conservative press. During the first years of his government, Yrigoyen led through decrees, since many of the initiatives he sent to Congress failed due to the conservative majority that still prevailed. Only after the 1918 Legislative Elections did radicalism obtain the majority in the lower chamber.

Despite the congressional minority, Yrigioyen maintained an attitude inclined towards dialogue and negotiation, not only with the traditional conservative parties that controlled the Senate, but also with the new popular parties that had gained prominence from the secret vote: the Socialist Party and the Democratic Progressive Party. He developed radicalism as a &quot;religion of redemption&quot; for the &quot;liberation of Argentina&quot;, he was not seen as a politician but as an &quot;apostle&quot;, and he believed that the Radical Civic Union was not a party but rather &quot;a motherland itself&quot;:

== 1918 and 1920 legislative elections ==
In 1918, the UCR received 367,263 votes, and in 1920, the party received 338,723 votes. Although the UCR won a considerable number of seats in the national legislature, the Senate&#x27;s slow constitutional turnover meant that the upper chamber did not yet represent the electorate. The death of Pelagio Luna in 1919 had a notable influence on the legislative body and the fact that many radical senators were not aligned with Yrigoyen&#x27;s government were a few of the factors that stopped several of Yrigoyen&#x27;s proposals in the Senate.

== First presidency, 1916–1922 ==
Yrigoyen was the nation&#x27;s first president to sustain a nationalist ideology, convinced that the country had to manage its own currency and credit, and most of all, control over its transports, energy networks, and petroleum exploitation. To this end, he designed the plans for a Central Bank in order to nationalize foreign trade, founded the energy company YPF, and placed controls on the concessions of the foreign businesses that managed the country&#x27;s railroads. Gabriel del Mazo, historian of radicalism, says that Yrigoyen&#x27;s government was characterized by his &quot;Petroleum and Land Plan&quot;. In addition to the defense of domestic assets, Yrigoyen was able to contain the expansionism of the large foreign economic groups that were active in the country. Facing the aggressive interventionist policy of the United States in Latin America, he defended his non-interventionist principles, going as far as ordering Argentina&#x27;s war boats in one case to wave the flag of the Dominican Republic rather than that of the U.S., who had hoisted theirs on the island after the 1916 occupation.

As far as the railroads were concerned, Yrigoyen placed rigorous controls on the railways in British hands, especially in regards to tariffs and fixation of capital accounts. He also promoted State Railways, looking for a way to reach the Pacific Ocean to facilitate transport of goods from the northwest and southwest of the country to reach Perú, Chile, and Bolivia.

The initial push to achieve complete democratic rights was stopped, since the UCR neither controlled the Senate nor the governorships in many provinces. Yrigoyen resorted in several cases to federal intervention in the provinces, which deepened the confrontation with the conservative sectors. During his first presidency, he intervened in the provinces twenty times; only five by law, and ten in provinces governed by radicals. The government argued that the provinces whose governors had been chosen in elections prior to the electoral reform were illegitimate.

Various reforms were also enacted during Yrigoyen&#x27;s first presidency. In 1918 a law was enacted fixing the conditions of homework, providing &quot;that a minimum wage for such work shall be fixed by mixed committees of employers and employees.&quot; A law was passed in 1919 providing the building of workers&#x27; houses at reasonable prices, while in 1921 a maximum increase in rent was fixed by law as a means of tackling an exorbitant rise in rents. A 1917 homestead law provided for grants of 500 acres of public land in the far north and far south, while from 1919 the National Mortgage Bank was permitted to make funds available for landless farmers to purchase rural property. In 1921 a tenant rental law was passed &quot;spelling out rights and limitations of rental contracts and working conditions.&quot; In 1919 a railroad worker pension plan was amended, and was further amended in 1921 &quot;to create a fund to build houses for railroaders and in that way helped to alleviate the decided shortage of decent affordable housing.&quot; A law of 1921 prohibited the manufacture, sale or importation of matches containing white or yellow phosphorus. More than 3,000 new schools were founded while illiteracy was combated, and the government helped set up an extensive consumer cooperative for employees of the state railways. A presidential decree was signed concerning the work of women and children. In accordance with this decree, &quot;every hall in stores, warehouses, millinery and other commercial establishments must have chairs, provided with backs, equal in number to two-thirds of the female workers employed.&quot; In 1921 a fund was established for old age, disability and survivors&#x27; pensions for personnel working at various public utilities owned by foreign corporations, along with those working in hospitals and clinics. Various public health initiatives were carried out For instance, Law 10,998 of October 21, 1919, authorised the Board of Sanitary Works of the Nation to construct water works and sewage systems in all towns of the Republic with over 8,000 inhabitants. According to a presidential message from 1921 &quot;The Executive Power has dedicated its greatest care to the development of social assistance services, being its constant desire that they correspond to the needs of the population. Within the limited means available to it, its action has been rapid, tending to reduce the ills that afflict the needy, concurring in some cases with the requested aid, reaching out to other means of aid to the populations and expanding the capacity of the hospital establishments with the essential elements for their regular operation.&quot;

=== Economic policy ===
The economic expansion that Argentina experienced during the period known as the &quot;radical republic&quot; (1916–1930), with an average annual expansion of 8.1%, is still today one of the greatest periods of economic growth in the history of the country. However, Yrigoyen had to confront problems arising from World War I. His policy was maintaining neutrality, which meant in economic terms continuing supply to its traditional allies and customers. The nations at war demanded cheap supplies, such as blankets and canned meat, which saw their exports triple between 1914 and 1920. This was nothing compared to the exports of corn and refrigerated meat (which was of higher quality than the canned meat). In turn, the import of manufactured goods from Europe stopped as the warring nations focused their resources on war industry. This caused industries to emerge to produce the products that were previously being imported. Between 1914 and 1921, commerce grew with the United States, as England and other European nations had nothing to offer Argentina.

When the war began, President Victorino de la Plaza ordered the suspension of the exchange of gold for paper currency that the Caja de conversión began in 1889 as a temporary solution for the Baring crisis and to prevent a capital outflow. This allowed the Argentine currency to maintain a gold standard. Fourteen million pesos in gold came back into the country from Paris and London, where it had been deposited by European merchants in the name of Argentine exporters. Thanks to this, the Argentine peso reached an 80% gold standard by the end of Yriogyen&#x27;s first government. The government attempted, to no avail, to create the Bank of the Republic in 1917, a financial entity whose objective would be to regulate the economy and national finances. In a five-year period, it did not issue debt instruments, and external debt was reduced to 225,000,000 pesos, the reason for which many public positions were left vacant to reduce public spending. Congress did not levy taxes on returns, though the administration requested this in 1919. In the same year, Congress passed regulations over conciliation and arbitration in workers&#x27; conflicts, establishing a &quot;junta&quot; presided over by the chair of the National Labor Department, and made up of a representative of each party in the conflict, to arrive at a viable understanding for workers and employers. Also in 1919, a law was brought to Congress regulating work in manufacturing and the production of yerba mate, citing that the conditions of the workers were inhumane. This law, Nº 11.728, was passed in the following radical administration in 1925, but it was vetoed by Marcelo T. de Alvear at the insistence of the Congress.

The prices on the international market began to decline slowly starting 1914, while the prices of manufactured products that Argentina was importing began to climb in relation to the price of grains. This created an increasingly difficult situation that became an economic crisis, eventually resulting in a global economic crisis in 1929. An industry with little development, created during World War I but shrunk afterwards, an economic organization that obtained almost all its resources from customs duties, and a budget with a negative balance, among other things, characterized the Argentine economy during the radical period from 1916 to 1930.

=== Violence ===
During his first presidency, workers&#x27; strikes were violently suppressed in events such as &quot;La Forestal&quot; massacre, the Tragic Week and the suppression of the Patagonia Rebelde. The anti-labor violence was often assisted by the paramilitary nationalist group Argentine Patriotic League.

== Second presidency, 1928–1930 ==
On the expiration of Alvear&#x27;s term in 1928, Yrigoyen was overwhelmingly elected President for the second time.

In December of that year, U.S. President-elect Herbert Hoover visited Argentina on a goodwill tour, meeting with President Yrigoyen on policies regarding trade and tariffs. Radical anarchist elements attempted to assassinate Hoover by attempting to place a bomb near his rail car, but the bomber was arrested before he could complete his work. President Yrigoyen accompanied Hoover thereafter as a personal guarantee of safety until he left the country.

=== Domestic Policy ===
In domestic policy, additional reforms were introduced during Yrigoyen&#x27;s second presidency. On June 12, 1929, Yrigoyen authorized funding for the establishment of primary schools throughout the nation (4,514,470 pesos for the establishment of primary schools in Buenos Aires, the Provinces and National Territories). An act of 29 August 1929, which came into force on 12 March 1930, established the eight-hour workday and forty-eight hour workweek for all salaried employees and workers A resolution passed on August 7, 1929, added a registry to the Ministry of Agriculture, whose purpose, as noted by one study, was &quot;to compile and distribute information concerning agricultural lands, such as prices, distance from important market and railway centers, and other data of interest to farm owners and to other persons wishing to purchase land.&quot;

=== Fall From Power ===
In the fallout of the Great Depression, Yrigoyen&#x27;s presidency ended due to conspiracies by rival factions who capitalized on flaws in his government. and conservative sectors of the army plotted openly for a regime change, as did American corporations, such as the Standard Oil of New Jersey, who opposed the president&#x27;s efforts to curb oil smuggling from Salta Province to Bolivia, as well as the existence of YPF itself. Yrigoyen, in his seventies, was also kept uninformed of the true state of the nation by aides who censored his access to news reports of the global depression&#x27;s impact. On 24 December of this year he survived an assassination attempt.

On 6 September 1930, Yrigoyen was deposed in a military coup led by General José Félix Uriburu. This was the first military coup since the adoption of the Argentine constitution. After the &quot;coup d&#x27;état,&quot; Enrique Pérez Colman, Minister of Finance in the Yrigoyen cabinet; General Moscini, former Director of YPF; General Baldrich, and a number of Yrigoyenist deputies were arrested by the provisional government of General Uriburu.

The new government of Uriburu adopted the most severe measures to prevent reprisals and counter-revolutionary tactics by friends of the ousted administration. The aforementioned Yrigoyenist personalities were later released.

== Later life and death ==
After his overthrow, Yrigoyen was placed under house arrest and confined several times to Martín García Island. He died in Buenos Aires on 3 July 1933 and was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery.

<text>Michaelhouse is a former college of the University of Cambridge, that existed between 1323 and 1546, when it was merged with King&#x27;s Hall to form Trinity College. Michaelhouse was the second residential college to be founded, after Peterhouse (1284). Though King&#x27;s Hall was established earlier in 1317, it did not acquire actual premises until its re-foundation by Edward III in 1336. The name Michaelhouse is now used for St Michael&#x27;s Church.

== Foundation and early history==
Established formally on Michaelmas Day 1324 as a college for scholars in Holy Orders, Michaelhouse is named after the parish church of the same name located on Cambridge&#x27;s &quot;magna strata&quot; or High Street (today&#x27;s Trinity Street). Founded by Hervey de Stanton, Edward II&#x27;s Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice (Chief Justice of the Pleas) of England, the college was established between spring 1323 and autumn 1324. On 28 May 1323, de Stanton obtained from Dera de Madingley the advowson (or right of presentation) to the parish of St Michael as well as her messuage on the High Street &#x27;for a hundred silver marks.&#x27; On 16 March 1323/4, de Stanton purchased for another hundred silver marks an extensive property located on St Michael&#x27;s Lane, complete with walled garden and a quay on the wharves of the River Cam owned by Robert Buttetourte.

=== Charter and establishment ===
In May 1324, Edward II granted a royal charter to the new college. On 31 August 1324, the Bishop of Ely, John Hotham, granted his own charter. The following day, John de Crauden, prior of the monastic foundation of Ely, added his agreement under the chapter seal. King, bishop and prior left de Stanton free hand in the appointment of the college’s first Master and the drafting of statutes for his college. On Michaelmas Day that year, Walter de Buxton, priest, was appointed the College&#x27;s first Master.

=== Expansion of the college ===

On 11 November 1324 Hervey de Stanton obtained the properties of Adam de Trumpington, rector of Buckland, for his college. At about the same time, he ordered the rebuilding of the parish church in the Decorated style for use as a chapel. Following his death on All Souls&#x27; Day 1325, de Stanton was buried in the unfinished chancel. His executors, John de Illegh and Alexander Walsham, continued the expansion of the College by purchasing further properties between St Michael&#x27;s Lane (today&#x27;s Trinity Lane), and the river, an area now occupied by the southwest corner of Trinity&#x27;s Great Court, and Neville Court. These included the purchase, in 1329, of two hostels South of St Michael&#x27;s lane and Milne Street (today&#x27;s Trinity Hall Lane), Ovyng and Garret Hostel. The latter gave its name to the lane leading to the river.

At Michaelmas 1337, de Illegh acquired another hall of residence adjacent to the King&#x27;s Hall, known as Crouched Hall or Newmarket Hostel. Two properties located on St Michael&#x27;s Lane complete the early expansion: the bequest by Joan de Refham in 1549 of her home and shops led to the establishment of St Katherine&#x27;s Hostel, and the acquisition in 1353 of a house owned by Archdeacon of Norfolk that gave way to St Gregory&#x27;s Hostel. The latter almost certainly took its name from the dedication of one of the chapels at St Michael&#x27;s Church. By the mid-14th century, Michaelhouse took up most of the present south-west corner of Trinity College&#x27;s Great Court and New Court, further acquiring lands now occupied by Trinity&#x27;s Scholars&#x27; Lawn and the Wren Library. The college&#x27;s core property included a navigable stream and a ditch which formed a natural boundary with the adjacent common, and the King&#x27;s Hall. The College benefited from a number of other local properties and further endowments. Indeed, although its buildings were never grand but of a size suitable to the small fellowship (the Hall measured only around 26 metres by 12 metres), by the time of its dissolution Michaelhouse had an annual income in excess of £140, some £50 higher than that of St Peter&#x27;s Monastery in Westminster (Westminster Abbey).

== Masters of the College of St Michael ==
Walter de Buxton, priest, 1324&lt;br&gt;
Henry Granby, fl. 1418&lt;br&gt;
John Fisher, 1497-1505

== Reformation and dissolution ==
Throughout its existence, the college remained a study house for clergy with a conservative theological ethos. The main exponent of this thinking is probably John Fisher, who served as Master between 1497 and 1505. As Chancellor of the university, Fisher was instrumental in the foundation of St John&#x27;s and Christ&#x27;s. As Bishop of Rochester he maintained the conservative stance on the royal supremacy and the reformation measures of king Henry VIII shared by much of the Michaelhouse fellowship which, more prominent and vociferous in his case, ultimately led to Fisher&#x27;s execution in 1535.

Ironically, Henry VIII made use of the same measures challenged by the Michaelhouse fellowship to dissolve the college. Following the dissolution of religious houses in England, Cambridge University rightly feared for the future of its colleges, many of which were religious foundations or study houses for clergy. The university was able to make use of its contacts to petition the queen, Katharine Parr who, in turn, persuaded Henry to spare most colleges. Indeed, the two colleges facing dissolution, together with vast tracts of land acquired from the dissolution of the monasteries, would eventually endow a new royal foundation befitting his grandeur. Consequently, in 1546 Michaelhouse was dissolved by act of Parliament, and merged with its neighbour King&#x27;s Hall to form Trinity College. Further endowed by Mary Tudor and Elizabeth I, Trinity remains one of the largest colleges and the wealthiest college in the university.

Unlike the few remaining remnants of King&#x27;s Hall north of King Edward&#x27;s Tower, following the building of Great Court at the end of the 16th century, nothing much remains of the original Michaelhouse buildings, though its stones probably served as ready building materials. While the Hall was adapted for use by the new college in 1546, its walls are now hidden behind the 18th-century ashlaring of the kitchens and combination rooms south of the present Dining Hall.

== St Michael&#x27;s Church ==

The parish church of St Michael probably dates back to the foundation of the city of Cambridge itself, though no written records survive prior to a valuation of the living in 1217. Substantially rebuilt by Hervey de Stanton in the Decorated style, the Church was designed to serve both the parish and the college. The chancel is three bays long, a bay larger than the nave; both chancel and nave have sizeable side aisles. In 1324, de Stanton had suggested to the bishop of Ely that the master and fellows, who were all members of the clergy, could provide daily worship for the parish, since they already used the church as their chapel. Consequently, on 18 March 1324/5, the first Master of Michaelhouse, Walter de Buxton was inducted as vicar of St Michael&#x27;s Church.

=== Parish church and chapel for three colleges ===
The church&#x27;s nave would have been used for parish worship, regular preaching, university debates and lectures. Until the completion of a chapel for neighbouring Gonville Hall in 1396, both Michaelhouse and Gonville shared in the use of the two aisles; Gonville making use of the north aisle of the church, Michaelhouse using the south. Since Gonville Hall was dedicated to the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, the north aisle altar was also dedicated to the Blessed Virgin. The south aisle altar was known as that of &quot;St Gregory of Pity&quot;, indicating that it would have been surmounted by an image of the Pity, that is, Christ and the instruments of the Passion. Its association with St Gregory derives from a vision by Pope Gregory the Great when celebrating mass of Christ&#x27;s real presence and sacrifice in the eucharistic bread. One of the later Hostels of Michaelhouse shared the dedication of the College chapel. While the altarpiece may have survived the reformation, it certainly would not have survived local Cromwellian iconoclasm, and was most likely destroyed, alongside other images in St Michael&#x27;s, on Boxing Day 1643. However, a late-medieval &quot;scutum sancti Trinitatis&quot; (Shield of the Trinity), in the middle ages widely believed to be the Shield of St Michael and probably used as the College&#x27;s coat of arms, has survived in the chapel&#x27;s stained glass window.

Michaelhouse clergy served the parish until the dissolution of the College in 1546. From the time of the demolition of the King&#x27;s Hall Chapel in 1550, until the completion, on the same site, of Trinity College Chapel under Elizabeth I of England in 1565, the scholars of Trinity made use of St Michael&#x27;s Church as their chapel. In the process of establishing a new chapel, 36 scholars&#x27; stalls created in 1485 by &#x27;John Day, Carvar&#x27; for the King&#x27;s Hall Chapel, some with carved misericords, were removed to St Michael&#x27;s, where they remain to date. As successor of Hervey de Stanton&#x27;s foundation, Trinity College continues to hold the patronage of the living of St Michael&#x27;s and, during the 16th to 18th centuries, fellows in Holy Orders at Trinity College ministered as clergy (so-called &#x27;chaplains&#x27;) of St Michael&#x27;s. The present minister retains this title.

=== Diocesan church ===
From the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century, the church was used as a venue of the episcopal and archidiaconal visitations for the Diocese of Ely. Similarly, diocesan confirmation services would be held at St Michael&#x27;s rather than in Ely Cathedral. On 11 November 1849, as the congregation was gathering for Sunday worship, the heating system caused the church roof to catch fire, resulting in the careful rebuilding of the roof by George Gilbert Scott and the restoration of the church the following year. Scott&#x27;s renovation did not extend beyond introducing a new stone porch at the north side of the church, the major restructuring of the church fell to Scott&#x27;s son, George Gilbert Scott, Jr.

=== Scott&#x27;s refurbishment ===
From 1870 to 1872, George Gilbert Scott Jr was asked to design a fine new east window in memory of one of the parish clergy, William Beamont. In the process, Scott proposed the complete remodelling of the sanctuary, including the creation of an ascent of four steps to match the levels of the 14th-century sedilia, and the creation of a tall new altarpiece that would extend &#x27;up to three feet above the window cill level&#x27;. For his three-tiered new reredos, Scott made use of parts of the existing, much smaller, altarpiece created between 1864 and 1868 by Louvain woodcarver Michiel Abeloos. Abeloos had previously collaborated with George Gilbert Scott on the carved choir stalls at Ely Cathedral. Abeloos&#x27; figures of the archangels Michael and Gabriel, the Last Supper and the College motto were all incorporated into a much grander piece, the work of local carpenters Rattee and Kett and artist F. R. Leach. In Cambridge, Leach also collaborated with George Frederick Bodley on the ceiling and frescoes of All Saints&#x27; Church, Jesus Lane, the ceiling of Jesus College Chapel, and the dining hall ceiling at Queens&#x27;. In 1874, Leach painted the Chancel ceiling and arches of St Michael&#x27;s to designs of Scott as a thank-offering, without accepting any payment. Parts of the north aisle had been painted previously to designs by Holman Hunt.

=== Michaelhouse Centre ===

Ultimately, the parish proved too small to be sustainable. Indeed, from as early as 1550, when it was suggested that it should be united with the parish of All Saints in the Jewry, St Michael&#x27;s parish was threatened with fusion with neighbouring parishes. It was finally united with that of Great St Mary&#x27;s in 1908. Substantially refurbished in 2001–2002, the church now bears the College&#x27;s name, Michaelhouse Centre, Cambridge. It serves as a lively weekday church, community centre, art gallery and a café managed by a charitable trust on behalf of the church council of the united parish. The chapel adjacent to de Stanton&#x27;s grave is named in his memory and now, as then, forms the focal point for daily devotions at the church he built.

== In popular culture ==
Michaelhouse is the setting for the &quot;Matthew Bartholomew Chronicles&quot;, a series of Mediaeval mystery novels by Susanna Gregory.

<doc id="670578" wikidata="Q1686256" url="?curid=670578" title="Jeff Astle">
<text>Jeffrey Astle (13 May 1942 – 19 January 2002) was an English professional footballer who played the majority of his career as a centre-forward for West Bromwich Albion. Nicknamed &quot;the King&quot; by the club&#x27;s fans, he played 361 games for them and scored 174 goals. He also won five caps for England without scoring.

== Football career ==
Born in Eastwood, Nottinghamshire, Astle turned professional with Notts County at the age of seventeen. A protégé of Tommy Lawton, Astle was a classic centre-forward. In 1964 he signed for West Bromwich Albion for a fee of £25,000. He scored 174 goals in 361 games for the Baggies, including the only goal in the 1968 FA Cup final, in which he completed the feat of scoring in every round of the competition that season.

Two years later, Astle scored in Albion&#x27;s 2–1 defeat by Manchester City in the League Cup final, becoming the first player to score in the finals of both of the major English cup competitions at Wembley. He had already scored in the first leg of the 1966 League Cup final four years previously, but that was at West Ham United&#x27;s Upton Park.

At the height of Astle&#x27;s Albion career, the words &quot;ASTLE IS THE KING&quot; appeared in large white letters on the brickwork of Primrose Bridge, which carries Cradley Road over a canal in Netherton, in the heart of the Black Country. The bridge quickly became known locally as &quot;the Astle Bridge&quot;. When the council removed the letters, they re-appeared a few days later. Following Astle&#x27;s death in 2002, a campaign was launched to have the bridge officially named in his honour, but this has so far been rejected over fears of vandal attacks by supporters of rival teams, as the area also has many Wolverhampton Wanderers fans. There is now a plaque underneath the bridge dedicated to his honour and can be viewed whilst walking underneath the bridge.

In the 1969–1970 season, Astle was the top scorer in the First Division, with 25 goals. In 1970, he was called up to the England squad for the World Cup finals tournament in Mexico. He won the fourth of his five caps, as a substitute, when England were a goal down against eventual champions Brazil.

In subsequent years his fitness deteriorated through repeated injuries, and in 1974 he left Albion to join the South African club Hellenic. His career ended with a brief spell at the English non-league side Dunstable Town, where he teamed up with former Manchester United star George Best.

==Retirement, death and legacy==

After his retirement, Astle launched an industrial cleaning business, working around the Burton upon Trent area. He also made television comedy appearances with Frank Skinner and David Baddiel on &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;.

On 19 January 2002, Astle choked to death at his daughter&#x27;s home, aged 59. The cause of death was a degenerative brain disease that had first become apparent as much as five years earlier.

Consultant neuropathologist Dr Derek Robson told an inquest that Astle had had a brain condition which was likely to have been exacerbated by heading a football and he found considerable evidence of trauma, similar to that found in boxers&#x27; brains.

Astle had been described as an &quot;exceptional&quot; header of the ball, and the coroner found that the repeated minor traumas had been the cause of his death, as the leather footballs used in Astle&#x27;s playing days were considerably heavier than the plastic ones used later, especially when wet.

A verdict of &quot;death by industrial injury&quot; was recorded.

This was not the first case of a footballer&#x27;s illness or death (particularly in the form of Alzheimer&#x27;s or dementia type symptoms) being connected to heading leather footballs, another example being the former Tottenham Hotspur captain Danny Blanchflower, who died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in December 1993. In 2014, the &quot;Justice for Jeff&quot; campaign was launched, calling for an independent inquiry into a possible link between degenerative brain disease and heading footballs. Subsequently, Astle was confirmed as the first British footballer known to have died as a result of heading a football.
In the same year it was claimed by a neurosurgeon that Astle had died as a result of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease previously associated with boxers.

On the day after his death, West Bromwich Albion held a minute&#x27;s silence in honour of Astle, before their home match against Black Country rivals Walsall. Albion striker Jason Roberts scored the only goal of the game and celebrated by removing his jersey to reveal a T-shirt bearing Astle&#x27;s image.

His funeral at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Netherseal, in Derbyshire, was attended by hundreds of football fans. Astle was cremated following the service. &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot; returned for a number of special editions after Astle&#x27;s death; the first programme being preceded by a minute&#x27;s silence, in the style of those held at football matches. In November 2002, Astle&#x27;s widow Laraine said that she would take legal action over his death.

Astle had been worshipped as a hero by the Albion fans, who would often sing (to the tune of &quot;Camptown Races&quot;):
&quot;Astle is the king, Astle is the king, the Brummie Road will sing this song, Astle is the king&quot;.
The chant is still heard at the Hawthorns. Following his death, a campaign was launched to fund a set of gates dedicated to his memory at the ground. The gates, which are situated on Birmingham Road, close to the Woodman Corner, were unveiled on 11 July 2003. In April 2003, Midland Metro named a AnsaldoBreda T-69 tram in his honour.

In 2004, he was named as one of West Bromwich Albion&#x27;s sixteen greatest players in a poll organised as part of the club&#x27;s 125th anniversary celebrations. Astle was also voted as one of Albion&#x27;s five &quot;FA Cup heroes&quot;, receiving the most votes for a striker in the poll organised by the club&#x27;s official website in 2006.

From early 2013 West Brom fans applauded in the ninth minute of matches for a minute in tribute to Astle and in support of the Justice for Jeff campaign. It references the fact that he wore the No. 9 shirt for the club. During the minute, the screens at the Hawthorns displayed an image of Astle with the caption &quot;If in doubt, Sit them out.&quot; Albion&#x27;s rivals Aston Villa and Birmingham City also showed a picture of Astle on their screens when West Brom played there that season.

===Jeff Astle Foundation===
It was announced on 26 March 2015 that the club would be holding &quot;Astle Day&quot; in his memory on 11 April at The Hawthorns, when the club hosted Leicester City. The team sported replicas of the kit that Astle wore when he scored the only goal in the 1–0 victory over Everton in the 1968 FA Cup final, with starting outfield players wearing numbers 2 through 11 instead of their squad numbers and the goalkeeper wearing no number, as was the case in 1968. Albion became only the second club to have been granted express permission from the Premier League for a kit change, after Manchester United donned a retro kit in honour of the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster in 2008. This day also marked the launch of the Jeff Astle Foundation, an organisation dedicated to raising awareness of brain injury in all sports and to helping those afflicted.

In May 2016, in the 50th anniversary year of England&#x27;s World Cup victory, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; compared football with the 1960s tobacco industry. It said the authorities risked legal action because of a &quot;scandalous&quot; failure to research dementia amongst former players, due to a combination of repeated heading of the ball and from collisions that might have occurred during a game. The newspaper also criticised the non-appearance of a risk study following Astle&#x27;s death and launched a campaign to investigate football related brain injuries. The &quot;Telegraph&quot; called for research to answer the question, &quot;Does playing football increase your risk of dementia and other degenerative brain diseases?&quot; In November 2017, a BBC documentary on the subject presented by former England striker Alan Shearer included an interview with Astle&#x27;s daughter, where she spoke of the deterioration in her father&#x27;s condition.

In 2019 it was reported that football players were three and a half times more likely to die from dementia.

<doc id="670599" wikidata="Q279009" url="?curid=670599" title="David, Chiriquí">
<text>David (), known as David City in colonial times, is a city and corregimiento in the west of Panama. It is the capital of the province of Chiriquí and has an estimated population of 82,907 inhabitants as confirmed in 2013. It is a relatively affluent city with a firmly established, dominant middle class and a very low unemployment and poverty index. The Pan-American Highway is a popular route to David. It is named after the Biblical King David. David is the largest city in Panama that is not part of the Panama city metro area.

The development of the banking sector, public construction works such as the expansion of the airport and the David-Boquete highway alongside the growth of commercial activity in the city have increased its prominence as one of the fastest-growing regions in the country. The city is the economic center of the Chiriqui province and produces more than half the gross domestic product of the province, which totals 2.1 billion. It is known for being the third-largest city in the country both in population and by GDP and for being the largest city in Western Panama.

==History==
David was founded in 1602, by the governor Juan López de Siqueira. The city had been founded in the area where the Bolivar park is currently located. In those times, the city was divided into three regions, one fit for Spanish residence, and another two of lesser areas known as &quot;San Antonio de Padra&quot;, &quot;David&quot; and &quot;Nuestra Señora del Rosario&quot;. At the end of the 19th century, David had six streets, but only four were populated, making up the city center, in the sector currently known as Barrio Bolívar. The Ermita de San José (currently the San José Cathedral) was located in that area. In March 1900, the Bolívar Park was the scene of the first battle of the &quot;Thousand Days&#x27; War&quot;, between liberals and conservatives who would later march on towards the capital to wage war against each other.

By 1726, the city was not recognized by the central government, even though intellectuals and other important people resided within the city boundaries. Juan Lopez de Sequeira is considered the main intellectual of the city and Francisco de Gama is credited as being responsible for the creation of the city. Both were converted Jewish people. It is speculated that the religious differences between them and the Royal Audience of Panama were the reason the latter refused to recognize them as such; however, in 1736, the city finally received recognition from the colonial government and was named &quot;La Ermita San Jose de David&quot;.

From 1916 to 1949, the Chiriqui province had access and employed a railway system, having been created by Belisario Porras to accelerate the development of the province and the exploitation of the agrarian products produced &quot;en masse&quot; by the province. The 165-kilometer-long railway system had its base of operations and main stations in the city and cemented its importance as a merchant city for the western region of Panama.

According to ancient documents, the name of the city was the idea of the local natives. Also, it was the rest stop of the long trail that connected the rest of Central America with Panama City, known as the &quot;Camino Real&quot; or &quot;Royal Trail&quot;.

The city&#x27;s airport, Enrique Malek International Airport, previously called David Field or San Jose Field during World War II, was an auxiliary of Howard Field. It accommodated a variety of United States Army Air Forces personnel, dedicated for the most part in training and reconnaissance missions over the Southeast Pacific coastline, from Honduras in the north, to Peru in the south as part of the defense of the Panama Canal.

==Commerce and industrialization==
San José de David (official name) is Panama&#x27;s third largest urban area. It functions as a hub for the province&#x27;s commercial activities, mainly agriculture and cattle raising and supplies the rest of the country. It is the region&#x27;s chief financial center and most national banks have offices here, including international banks such as HSBC. It also serves as a port of exports and imports with neighboring Costa Rica. It is connected to the rest of the country by the Pan-American Highway, and the Enrique Malek International Airport. David is one of the most industrialized cities in the country and is a center of manufacturing, heavy industry and high technology standards and communications. It is also a popular tourist destination due to its nightlife, entertainment, cuisine, shopping and relative proximity to the Pacific coast and the Panamanian highlands.
==Location and geography==
David is located in a basin in south central Chiriquí Province between the cities of Puerto Armuelles on the coast and Boquete in the mountains. The city lies below the water break on the David River, at the foothills of the Cordillera de Talamanca mountain range. Volcán Barú, a potentially active volcano and also the tallest mountain in Panama, is visible from northern parts of the city. David is roughly from the Costa Rican border and is a vital center for trade between the two countries, located some from Panama City.

The city has little geographic variations within its boundaries. The main geographic landmarks in David are “Cerro San Cristobal” and “Cerro Pedregal”, located in the southern area of the city, in the Pedregal area. Mounts “Cerro Santa Cruz” and the “Pico de Loro” (literally: “Parrot’s Peak”) Sierra surround the north of David, being located in the San Carlos Area.

David&#x27;s northeast region is surrounded by the Manjagua and David rivers, dividing David from the residential “Las Lomas” area. There are also smaller rivers running in a southernly direction and feeding the Pedregal estuary, which surrounds Pedregal and reaches its delta near the grounds of the Enrique Malek International Airport.

The ocean coast close to David is in part covered by extensive beaches and mangroves. The city&#x27;s main port, Pedregal, is located in the south end of the city, near the mangrove-filled region. The port is closely connected by land to the city&#x27;s airport. This port is the docking site for small private vessels and yachts owned by David&#x27;s residents, and also serves as an attraction for fishers. It is also the departing place for tours that go to the numerous islands of the Chiriquí Gulf and the base of operations of many handicraft vendors.

The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of David.

===Climate===
The city has one of the hottest climates in the Central American region, but the temperatures drop sharply near the outskirts. David&#x27;s climate is classified as a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) with a short, sweltering, dry season from mid-December to mid-April and a long, oppressive and hot wet season from mid-April to mid-December.
==Layout==

Central David is mostly laid out in a grid with numbered streets; however, the streets on the outskirts of town are neither named nor numbered. David&#x27;s population density is rather low, as most people live in detached single-family homes. Most buildings in town, including those in the central business district, are only one or two stories high. Only a few hotels, banks, casinos, and apartment buildings reach a height of two to five stories.

Most expatriates and the wealthiest residents live in the northern section of the city and in the neighboring communities immediately to the north and northwest. This area is also a commercial district and contains many franchises, stores and outlets.

David offers many lodging options. As Chiriquí province continues to gain popularity as a tourist destination, more hotels are being built to accommodate all budget ranges. Hotels in the city present the visitor with a wide variety of amenities and variety of prices. The hotels are located in the city center, near the banking and business district so they have the most central location of the city. Many backpackers and budget travelers have recently discovered David. There are two main backpacker hostels: Bambu Hostel and Purple House. The area is also home to the Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra Park. The central location makes the base from which Chiriqui&#x27;s main chains and companies operate and serves as the headquarters and banking center of many banks in the province.

The Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra Park is located in the middle of the city. This new park works as a rest stop for visitors and locals traversing the city. It is known for offering shade from the city&#x27;s usual sunny weather under its trees. It is the place of business for some ice cream, handicraft and lottery vendors, and is surrounded by banks, hotels and many shops.

<text>John Young ( 17401781) was a captain in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War, commander of the which was lost at sea.

==Background==
He began his seafaring career at an early age in the colonial merchant marine and, at the start of the American Revolution, was commissioned 23rd on the list of captains in the Continental Navy. On 20 September 1776, the Continental Congress directed Young to take the sloop-of-war to Martinique to protect American mercantile shipping in the West Indies. Collaterally, &quot;Independence&quot; was to raid British shipping whenever the opportunity arose.

On 5 July 1777, Young was ordered to Nantes, France, and subsequently arrived at Lorient with two prizes. On 17 February 1778, while in French waters, he sailed through the French Fleet, saluting that nation&#x27;s government with a 13-gun salute. In return he received a nine-gun salute, one of the earliest salutes rendered by the French government to the fledgling American government. At the time, John Paul Jones was on board &quot;Independence&quot;.

Young returned to America in the spring of 1778 and successively commanded two Pennsylvania privateers, &quot;Buckskin&quot; and &quot;Impertinent&quot;, before he was given command of the sloop-of-war - then fitting out at Philadelphia—in May 1780. Young took her to sea on 13 August 1780 and, in the course of the ship&#x27;s first cruise, captured one prize before she returned to port for repairs and alterations.

Subsequent cruises were more successful, as Young commanded &quot;Saratoga&quot; on three more sweeps at sea in which he took a total of eight more prizes. Young proved himself a daring and resourceful commander. On one occasion, he took &quot;Saratoga&quot; between two British ships and captured both. Largely as a result of his dedication and emphasis on training, &quot;Saratoga&quot; compiled a distinguished, but altogether brief, record before her untimely and unexplained loss.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; set sail from Cap-Haïtien, in what is now Haiti, on 15 March 1781. After taking a prize three days later, the sloop-of-war became separated from her later that day when a strong gale swept through the area, the high winds nearly swamping the prize commanded by Midshipman Penfield. After the storm passed by, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was nowhere to be seen, having vanished without a trace.

The United States Navy named two ships, , and in his honor.

<doc id="670602" wikidata="Q2800071" url="?curid=670602" title="Perfect graph theorem">
<text>In graph theory, the perfect graph theorem of states that an undirected graph is perfect if and only if its complement graph is also perfect. This result had been conjectured by , and it is sometimes called the weak perfect graph theorem to distinguish it from the strong perfect graph theorem characterizing perfect graphs by their forbidden induced subgraphs.

==Statement==
A perfect graph is an undirected graph with the property that, in every one of its induced subgraphs, the size of the largest clique equals the minimum number of colors in a coloring of the subgraph. Perfect graphs include many important graphs classes including bipartite graphs, chordal graphs, and comparability graphs.

The complement of a graph has an edge between two vertices if and only if the original graph does not have an edge between the same two vertices. Thus, a clique in the original graph becomes an independent set in the complement and a coloring of the original graph becomes a clique cover of the complement.

The perfect graph theorem states:

:The complement of a perfect graph is perfect.

Equivalently, in a perfect graph, the size of the maximum independent set equals the minimum number of cliques in a clique cover.

==Example==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a cycle graph of odd length greater than three (a so-called &quot;odd hole&quot;). Then &quot;G&quot; requires at least three colors in any coloring, but has no triangle, so it is not perfect. By the perfect graph theorem, the complement of &quot;G&quot; (an &quot;odd antihole&quot;) must therefore also not be perfect. If &quot;G&quot; is a cycle of five vertices, it is isomorphic to its complement, but this property is not true for longer odd cycles, and it is not as trivial to compute the clique number and chromatic number in an odd antihole as it is in an odd hole. As the strong perfect graph theorem states, the odd holes and odd antiholes turn out to be the minimal forbidden induced subgraphs for the perfect graphs.

==Applications==
In a nontrivial bipartite graph, the optimal number of colors is (by definition) two, and (since bipartite graphs are triangle-free) the maximum clique size is also two. Also, any induced subgraph of a bipartite graph remains bipartite. Therefore, bipartite graphs are perfect. In bipartite graphs, a minimum clique cover takes the form of a maximum matching together with an additional clique for every unmatched vertex, with size &quot;n&quot; − &quot;M&quot;, where &quot;M&quot; is the cardinality of the matching. Thus, in this case, the perfect graph theorem implies Kőnig&#x27;s theorem that the size of a maximum independent set in a bipartite graph is also &quot;n&quot; − &quot;M&quot;, a result that was a major inspiration for Berge&#x27;s formulation of the theory of perfect graphs.

Mirsky&#x27;s theorem characterizing the height of a partially ordered set in terms of partitions into antichains can be formulated as the perfection of the comparability graph of the partially ordered set, and Dilworth&#x27;s theorem characterizing the width of a partially ordered set in terms of partitions into chains can be formulated as the perfection of the complements of these graphs. Thus, the perfect graph theorem can be used to prove Dilworth&#x27;s theorem from the (much easier) proof of Mirsky&#x27;s theorem, or vice versa.

==Lovász&#x27;s proof==
To prove the perfect graph theorem, Lovász used an operation of replacing vertices in a graph by cliques; it was already known to Berge that, if a graph is perfect, the graph formed by this replacement process is also perfect. Any such replacement process may be broken down into repeated steps of doubling a vertex. If the doubled vertex belongs to a maximum clique of the graph, it increases both the clique number and the chromatic number by one. If, on the other hand, the doubled vertex does not belong to a maximum clique, form a graph &quot;H&quot; by removing the vertices with the same color as the doubled vertex (but not the doubled vertex itself) from an optimal coloring of the given graph. The removed vertices meet every maximum clique, so &quot;H&quot; has clique number and chromatic number one less than that of the given graph. The removed vertices and the new copy of the doubled vertex can then be added back as a single color class, showing that in this case the doubling step leaves the chromatic number unchanged. The same argument shows that doubling preserves the equality of the clique number and the chromatic number in every induced subgraph of the given graph, so each doubling step preserves the perfection of the graph.

Given a perfect graph &quot;G&quot;, Lovász forms a graph &quot;G&quot;* by replacing each vertex &quot;v&quot; by a clique of &quot;tv&quot; vertices, where &quot;tv&quot; is the number of distinct maximum independent sets in &quot;G&quot; that contain &quot;v&quot;. It is possible to correspond each of the distinct maximum independent sets in &quot;G&quot; with one of the maximum independent sets in &quot;G&quot;*, in such a way that the chosen maximum independent sets in &quot;G&quot;* are all disjoint and each vertex of &quot;G&quot;* appears in a single chosen set; that is, &quot;G&quot;* has a coloring in which each color class is a maximum independent set. Necessarily, this coloring is an optimal coloring of &quot;G&quot;*. Because &quot;G&quot; is perfect, so is &quot;G&quot;*, and therefore it has a maximum clique &quot;K&quot;* whose size equals the number of colors in this coloring, which is the number of distinct maximum independent sets in &quot;G&quot;; necessarily, &quot;K&quot;* contains a distinct representative for each of these maximum independent sets. The corresponding set &quot;K&quot; of vertices in &quot;G&quot; (the vertices whose expanded cliques in &quot;G&quot;* intersect &quot;K&quot;*) is a clique in &quot;G&quot; with the property that it intersects every maximum independent set in &quot;G&quot;. Therefore, the graph formed from &quot;G&quot; by removing &quot;K&quot; has clique cover number at most one less than the clique number of &quot;G&quot;, and independence number at least one less than the independence number of &quot;G&quot;, and the result follows by induction on this number.

==Relation to the strong perfect graph theorem==
The strong perfect graph theorem of states that a graph is perfect if and only if none of its induced subgraphs are cycles of odd length greater than or equal to five, or their complements. Because this characterization is unaffected by graph complementation, it immediately implies the weak perfect graph theorem.

==Generalizations==
 proved that, if the edges of a complete graph are partitioned into three subgraphs in such a way that every three vertices induce a connected graph in one of the three subgraphs, and if two of the subgraphs are perfect, then the third subgraph is also perfect. The perfect graph theorem is the special case of this result when one of the three subgraphs is the empty graph.

<text>Michael Casimir &quot;Mike&quot; Stivic is a fictional character played by Rob Reiner on the 1970s American television sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot;. He is the live-in son-in-law of the series&#x27; lead character, Archie Bunker, who frequently calls him &quot;Meathead&quot;. Michael is the husband of Archie&#x27;s daughter Gloria (played by Sally Struthers).

== Character overview ==
The character of Michael Stivic is an Americanized version of the British original: &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;″s Mike Rawlins, the Trotskyist &quot;Randy Scouse Git&quot; who arouses the passionate ire of his conservative father-in-law Alf Garnett. For the American version, the Trotskyist angle is drastically softened: Michael Stivic is a social liberal and somewhat of a leftist, but does not adhere to any form of communism. He is sympathetic to the Students for a Democratic Society movement (SDS), which is suggested by his occasional use of SDS ally and Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s guerrilla theatre antics.

A Polish-American from Chicago, Michael is orphaned at a young age when a car crash claims the lives of his parents. He is raised by his uncle Casimir Stivic, a former Marine lieutenant turned florist, who calls him &quot;Mickey&quot; with great affection. He also has an uncle Alex.

When &quot;All in the Family&quot; begins, Michael is married to Gloria and shares a bedroom with her in the home of her parents, whom he addresses as &quot;Ma&quot; and &quot;Archie&quot; (or &quot;Arch&quot;), while focusing his efforts on earning a college degree in sociology. His first meeting with Archie (seen in flashback) portrays him as a bearded hippie with a tie-dyed shirt. His wardrobe throughout most of the series is much more subdued: most often he wears a denim shirt, jeans, and boots. He shaves his beard for his wedding with Gloria, but keeps his mustache afterwards (on rare occasions later in the series, however, he would sport a clean-shaven look) and wears his hair well below the collar. (Reiner&#x27;s hairline receded very rapidly early in the series and he began wearing a toupee when playing the character.) In season 2, episode 5, &quot;Flashback: Mike Meets Archie&quot; (October 16, 1971), Michael and Gloria celebrate their first wedding anniversary. A 1972 episode centers on their second anniversary and the 1978 episode &quot;The Stivics Go West&quot; reveals that the couple are nearing their ninth anniversary.

In the show&#x27;s early years, conflicts between left-leaning Michael and his bigoted father-in-law Archie Bunker are exacerbated by the characters living under the same roof. This arrangement, which begins immediately after Michael and Gloria&#x27;s wedding, allows Michael to save for his college tuition. On their second wedding anniversary, he mentions lecturing Archie for &quot;these past couple years I&#x27;ve been around here.&quot; (During his first meeting with Archie, Michael complains to Gloria that not only is he about to have Archie as a father-in-law, he&#x27;ll soon be living with him until he graduates.) The close proximity results in frequent disputes, often over the simplest of topics, such as the proper order for putting on socks and shoes. Along with other issues, such as Michael&#x27;s propensity for sitting in Archie&#x27;s coveted chair and his huge appetite for the food purchased with Archie&#x27;s working-class paycheck. Their huge ideological differences greatly contribute to the conflict between the characters. Michael is a determined agnostic, although he occasionally identifies himself as an atheist to provoke Archie, who assumes Michael has no belief in God. This is a stark contrast to Edith&#x27;s quiet Christian church attendance and his own non-practicing but nonetheless staunchly Christian viewpoint. Michael is also a dedicated humanitarian who wants to change the world. Originally intending to become a social worker, his career aspirations shift towards teaching as the series progresses. When the neighboring Jefferson family leaves the neighborhood, this allows Michael and Gloria to rent the house from patriarch George, finally giving the couple a home of their own. The new arrangement eases the tension between Michael and Archie, but still allows for frequent visits and interactions between all of the family members.

Michael enjoys a warm relationship with Edith, whom he calls &quot;Ma&quot;. She frequently intervenes to try to defuse tensions between her husband and son-in-law, though she also occasionally takes Mike to task for initiating unnecessary arguments with Archie. In the 1973 episode &quot;Games Bunkers Play&quot;, Edith offers Michael some insight into Archie&#x27;s attitude toward him. She explains that Archie dropped out of high school to help support his family during the Depression and he resents the fact that Michael has the chance to attend college and advance his education.

Michael is presented as a representative of the counterculture of the 1960s (reflecting current events during the run of the series). Michael is a dedicated academic, however, and there is no suggestion of the drug use or &quot;free love&quot; of that subculture. It is revealed in the season eight episode &quot;Gloria and Mike Meet&quot; that in 1969, Michael&#x27;s dedication to humanitarianism was galvanized in order to weaken support for newly elected President Richard Nixon. Furthermore, that he was probably a member of the SDS&#x27;s newly formed Worker Student Alliance that sought to encourage university students to find ways to fix problems within the working class.

Though supportive of human rights, Michael at times displays male chauvinism as well. This is evidenced when he objects to having his appendix removed by a female doctor and when he reveals himself to be a sore loser when playing a board game called &quot;Group Therapy&quot; with his family and neighbors. He differs with Archie over the potential successes women and racial minorities can achieve. Michael also believes that neither can evolve socially without a quality education from people like himself. This is demonstrated when he falsely characterizes a blue-collar handyman&#x27;s black assistant as a minstrel show stereotype who dons the same &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; attire as his boss in the season 3 episode &quot;Everybody Tells the Truth&quot; (Archie&#x27;s version is just as stereotyped—the assistant is a member of the Black Power movement and his boss is a mafia thug). Michael is also determined to ensure that Gloria shares his beliefs.

In 1971, Michael is surprised but excited to learn that Gloria is pregnant, though the pregnancy ends in a miscarriage. Gloria becomes pregnant again in 1975 and their baby Joseph &quot;Joey&quot; Stivic is born in December of that year.

During early episodes, Michael&#x27;s best friend is Lionel Jefferson. In the first season, Lionel surprises Michael by announcing that he and his family are moving into the house next door. However, the characters rarely see or refer to each other after the Jeffersons leave &quot;All in the Family&quot; to join the spin-off &quot;The Jeffersons.&quot; George Jefferson, however, later makes a guest appearance at his former residence when the Stivics start preparing for their move to California and meet with him to give notice that they will no longer be staying in his house. Another of Michael&#x27;s close friends, Al Bender (played by Billy Crystal), marries Gloria&#x27;s best friend Trudy Tannen in a 1976 episode.

Mike accepts a faculty position at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and he and Gloria move to California at the end of the 1977–78 season (at which time Reiner and Struthers ceased to be regulars on the show). They appear in a Christmas episode during the 1978–79 season, in which Archie, Edith, and Edith&#x27;s niece Stephanie visit Michael and Gloria, exposing the fact that the couple have secretly separated due to troubles in their marriage, including Gloria&#x27;s infidelity with one of Michael&#x27;s college faculty colleagues. Though they seemingly resolve their differences during this episode, a Thanksgiving visit by Mike and Gloria during the 1979-80 season of &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; shows that the Stivics&#x27; marriage is still troubled, exacerbated by Michael having lost his job after he and Gloria participate in a nude protest at a proposed nuclear power plant site and are arrested. This is the last appearance of the Michael Stivic character.

Michael Stivic does not appear in the 1982 spin-off series &quot;Gloria&quot;, which starred Sally Struthers. Initially, Reiner had been asked to participate in the series and resurrect his Michael Stivic character, but he declined. It is explained on the show that Michael left his wife and young son Joey (then played by Christian Jacobs) to live in a California commune with one of his students—whom Gloria described as &quot;the homecoming queen, a girl named Muffy&quot;—and is in the process of going through a bitter divorce. At the beginning of the series (September 1982), it has been 63 days since Michael walked out on Gloria; he calls to invite her to the commune, but things deteriorate quickly when he claims Gloria is incapable of holding a job or of supporting herself and Joey. By the end of the series (spring 1983), the divorce is final.

===&quot;Meathead&quot;===
Beginning with their first meeting, Archie routinely refers to Michael by the derogatory nickname &quot;Meathead&quot;, as seen in a flashback in the second-season episode &quot;Mike Meets Archie&quot;. In Archie&#x27;s own words, it means &quot;dead from the neck up. Meat...head.&quot;

A later episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot; reveals that Archie Bunker himself was referred to as &quot;Meathead&quot; in his youth.

Norman Lear said his father used to call him &quot;Meathead&quot;.

<text>Romford railway station is an interchange station on the Great Eastern Main Line, serving the town of Romford in the London Borough of Havering, east London. It is down the line from London Liverpool Street and is situated between and . It is also the northern terminus of the Liberty line of the London Overground. Its three-letter station code is RMF and it is in Travelcard Zone 6.

The station is currently managed by the Elizabeth line. The majority of services that call at Romford are Elizabeth line, but the station is also served by off-peak Greater Anglia trains between Liverpool Street and and .

==History==
===East Anglia main line===
From its inception, the Eastern Counties Railway (ECR) planned a route linking London and Norwich that would take it via Romford. Two routes were considered, that of the current line, and an alternative going through Ilford at Cranbrook Road, then passing near to Gidea Hall and crossing Romford Common approximately following the route of the current A12 before returning to the current railway alignment at Brentwood.

When the line was constructed, the first Romford station opened on 20 June 1839 as a single island platform located to the west of Waterloo Road, and formed the eastern terminus of the initial part of the Eastern Counties Railway from Mile End. Both stations acted as temporary termini, with the line extending east to and west to Shoreditch in 1840.

In 1844, the station was relocated to its current position, some east of the original. Around this time, the gauge of the ECR was changed from  to standard gauge of . In 1860, the station was remodelled with platforms on each side of the line with access to the new station by a covered walkway from South Street to the London-bound platform and via an open slope and steps for the country-bound platform. Soon after this, the goods depot, which was situated to the south of the station, was connected to the Ind Coope brewery via a tunnel under the line. Other non-passenger traffic included goods for the Romford Gas Works and for cattle pens accessed from St Andrews Road, which were necessary due to the cattle market held in Romford every Wednesday.

The line became part of the Great Eastern Railway (GER) in 1862. It was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1922.

===Upminster branch===

The construction of the Tilbury Docks in the 1850s gave expanded opportunities for rail traffic, and three proposals were made for a railway linking Romford to Tilbury. The London, Tilbury and Southend Railway (LT&amp;S) were successful, and on 7 June 1893, the LT&amp;S opened a station in Romford, on their line to , linking to the already existing connection from Upminster to Grays on the LT&amp;S line to Tilbury. The LT&amp;S had hoped to negotiate with the Great Eastern Railway to use their station, but concerns over fast trains led to the GER declining and a completely new station was built with a single platform and an entrance on the opposite side of South Street to the GER station. A footbridge was built to connect the two stations but was often closed during the day. 

In 1934, the entrance to the platform of the line to Upminster was closed and the access to the single platform was provided by the footbridge from the main station platforms.

In May 2015, the Upminster branch line transferred from Abellio Greater Anglia to London Overground. The London Overground service at the station was rebranded as the Liberty line from November 2024.

===Elizabeth line===
In the 1930s increasing traffic on the line led to two additional tracks and platforms being added by the LNER on the north side, the line having been quadrupled to a point west of Romford previously in 1901. 

Electric trains started on the line from Liverpool Street to Shenfield in 1949, giving Romford 15 trains per hour to London during peak hours, and 6 trains per hour off-peak, a pattern that continued for over half a century.

In May 2015, the regular Shenfield stopping service transferred to TfL Rail.

In 2017 new trains began entering service as Crossrail partially opened under the TfL Rail brand. Platforms 2 to 5 were extended from their length of between and to accommodate the Crossrail trains, which are over long. New lifts, signage, help points, customer information screens and CCTV were installed. The upgrade works were completed in August 2022, after delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

TfL Rail services were rebranded as the Elizabeth line on 24 May 2022.

=== Accidents and incidents ===
*On 29 December 1944, one person was killed and three were injured when, in darkness and heavy fog, a –London service passed two signals at danger on the approach to Romford and ran into the rear of a stationary freight train. The passenger train&#x27;s speed at the moment of impact was about . One crew member on the goods train was killed instantly. The Chelmsford train driver was held responsible for the collision in a Ministry of War Transport report.
*On 4 February 2010, two people standing on the platforms at Romford were injured when stone ballast was shed from a freight train passing through the station. Subsequent examination found that the train wagon&#x27;s doors had not been properly closed when it departed from the goods yard at Acton, bound for .
*On 4 November 2024, a person was killed after being struck by a train.

<doc id="670614" wikidata="Q5571472" url="?curid=670614" title="Gloria Stivic">
<text>Gloria Stivic is a fictional character played by Sally Struthers on the American situation comedy &quot;All in the Family&quot; (which aired on the CBS television network from 1971 until 1979) and the spin-off series &quot;Gloria&quot; (CBS, 1982–83). The only child of Archie and Edith Bunker, Gloria is married to—and eventually divorced from—Michael Stivic. She was born 11 months after Archie and Edith were married, according to the fifth season episode “The Longest Kiss”.

==Character overview==
Gloria is often caught in the middle of arguments between her liberal husband Michael and her conservative father, Archie. As her relationship with Michael progresses, Gloria concludes that her father is wrong about a lot of things and sides with her husband&#x27;s liberal beliefs. Despite his affection for her, Michael is also using his marriage to persuade long-sheltered Gloria to share his own beliefs as well.

Edith mentions (in the pilot) that Gloria was overprotected as a child due to being anemic. Archie often refers to her as his &quot;little goil&quot; [girl].

In season 7&#x27;s &quot;Mike and Gloria Meet&quot;, it is explained that Mike and Gloria met in 1969, the evening of President Nixon&#x27;s inauguration (Michael had been planning to protest the event, but opted to go on a blind date with Gloria instead). They did not initially like each other, until they discovered that they share a mutual love of ballroom dancing. They married in 1970 in Archie and Edith&#x27;s home in a civil ceremony (as a means of compromise between Archie&#x27;s wish that they are wed by a Protestant minister and Michael&#x27;s Uncle Cass&#x27; preference for a Catholic priest).

Gloria is the main breadwinner for the couple while they live in her parents&#x27; home during their first five years of marriage. With Michael attending college, initially for a bachelor&#x27;s degree and then continuing for his master&#x27;s, Gloria works full-time at a department store. She is sensitive about having only a high school education and sometimes feels that Michael condescends to her, particularly during arguments.

Upon Michael&#x27;s graduation, he and Gloria move to the neighboring rental property owned by former neighbor George Jefferson, where the Jeffersons reside between seasons 1 and 5. At that time Gloria becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, Joey Stivic, and becomes a stay-at-home mother, while Michael begins his teaching career. The Stivics later move to Santa Barbara, California after Michael is offered a better paying associate professor&#x27;s position at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB).

The Stivic marriage is tested after Gloria engages in an affair with Bud Kreeger, a college faculty colleague of her husband. Gloria confesses this affair to her parents, while remaining silent about sleeping with him, during Archie and Edith&#x27;s Christmas visit to California.

Michael and Gloria are later arrested for engaging in a nude protest at a proposed nuclear power plant site. This costs Michael his well-paid job at UCSB and leaves the Stivics cash-strapped. Eventually, Michael abandons his wife and son to join a commune with one of his students, betraying a promise he makes to Archie before leaving for California that he will always take care of Gloria and Joey.

Struthers continued playing the character of Gloria Bunker in guest appearances on &quot;Archie Bunker&#x27;s Place&quot; and on the 1982–1983 related series &quot;Gloria&quot;, in which she is divorced from Michael and finds employment in an upstate New York veterinarian&#x27;s office. In this series, she is working towards becoming a fully qualified veterinarian&#x27;s assistant while raising Joey as a single mother. Over the course of the show, she becomes romantically involved with Clark V. Uhley, Jr., another assistant in the same practice.

<text>Lincoln Child (born October 13, 1957) is an American author of techno-thriller and horror novels. Though he is most well known for his collaborations with Douglas Preston (including the Agent Pendergast series and the Gideon Crew series, among others), he has also written eight solo novels, including the Jeremy Logan series. Over twenty of the collaborative novels and most of his solo novels have become New York Times bestsellers, some reaching the #1 position. Child and Preston&#x27;s first novel together, &quot;Relic&quot;, was adapted into a feature film. Their books are notable for their thorough research and scientific accuracy.

==Life and career==
Born in Westport, Connecticut, but now a Florida resident, Child graduated from Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, with a major in English.

Soon afterward, in 1979, he secured a job as an editorial assistant at St. Martin&#x27;s Press. By 1984, Child had become full editor. While in this position, he edited hundreds of books, most titles being American and English fiction.

In 1987, after founding the company&#x27;s mass-market horror division, Child left the St. Martin&#x27;s Press to become a systems analyst at MetLife. Child&#x27;s first novel (co-written with Preston), &quot;Relic&quot;, was published in 1995. He left the company a few years later to write full-time.

In 2002, Child began his solo career with the debut novel &quot;Utopia&quot;, then wrote &quot;Death Match&quot; in 2004. These two novels were stand-alone works that introduced a new set of characters each time. However, with &quot;Deep Storm&quot; in 2007, Child introduced the character of Dr. Jeremy Logan, a Yale professor of medieval history and enigmalogist, whose role over the course of the series gradually increases with each book. He appeared in only one chapter in &quot;Deep Storm&quot;, then became a supporting character in &quot;Terminal Freeze&quot; (2009), before finally becoming the main protagonist in &quot;The Third Gate&quot; (2012). &quot;Utopia&quot;, &quot;Deep Storm&quot;, and &quot;Terminal Freeze&quot; all went on to become New York Times best sellers.

Child is now a resident of Sarasota, Florida.

<text>Ruth Wallis (January 5, 1920 – December 22, 2007) was a novelty and cabaret singer. She sang with a studio orchestra and often took on an accent for songs about characters from other countries. Her music was occasionally featured on the Dr. Demento show in the 1970s.

==Career==
Born Ruth Shirley Wohl in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, Wallis began her career singing jazz and cabaret standards—with such bands as Isham Jones and Benny Goodman on road tours for a couple of months; but gained fame in the 1940s and 1950s for her risqué, satirical songs that she wrote herself, rife with double entendres.

She started singing in lounges and cocktail bars, where she met her husband Hy Pastman. Eventually it became clear that her novelty songs, which relied mostly upon double entendres, were the most popular. These songs discussed a number of topics that were taboo in 1950s America, such as homosexuality and infidelity.

In 1953, she recorded a collection of saucy songs for the De Luxe label, including &quot;Jose Is Living the Life of Riley&quot; (&quot;since Riley is out of town!&quot;). Later in the year, she wrote, sang, and published a mainstream novelty hit, &quot;Dear Mr. Godfrey,&quot; a song about Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s public firing of Julius La Rosa. Released in November 1953, it sold 100,000 within the first 10 days of release and reached #25 on the charts, launching Wallis on a whirlwind nightclub tour that same month.

Despite this mainstream exposure, Wallis recognized that her nightclub repertoire of risqué material was steadier and more lucrative. Frustrated by De Luxe&#x27;s limited distribution of her works—and concerned about bootlegged copies for which she received nothing—she started her own record label, Wallis Original Recordings. 

When she arrived in Australia for a tour in 1958, with songs like &quot;The Admiral&#x27;s Daughter&quot; and &quot;Johnny Had a Yo-Yo&quot;, customs agents seized her records. Rather than ruining her career, this only brought out crowds. It also created a healthy demand for her suppressed records, which were selling there at an extreme premium: $8 apiece. She was a regular headliner in Las Vegas nightclubs and lounges in the 1960s.

Wallis retired in the 1970s to spend more time with her husband and two children, but continued to work on material for Broadway shows. Some of her most famous songs were collected and became the Off-Broadway hit, &quot;BOOBS! The Musical: The World According to Ruth Wallis&quot;. &quot;BOOBS!&quot; opened at the Triad Theater in New York City on May 19, 2003; by closing date it had played nearly 300 performances. Produced and choreographed by Lawrence Leritz, it has had subsequent runs in New Orleans and Wichita.

In March 2007, Wallis was honored by the National Archives of Australia. Memorabilia of hers were included in &#x27;Memory of a Nation&#x27;, a permanent exhibition opening in Canberra.

Wallis died on December 22, 2007, in South Killingly, Connecticut, from complications of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Lee Edward Bowers Jr. (January 12, 1925 – August 9, 1966) was a witness to the assassination of United States President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. 
The timing and circumstances of Bowers&#x27;s death have led to various allegations that his demise was part of a cover-up subsequent to the Kennedy murder.

==Early life and career==
Bowers served in the U.S. Navy from ages 17 to 21. He attended Hardin-Simmons University for two years then Southern Methodist University for two years, majoring in religion. He worked at the Union Terminal Company railyard for 15 years, also working as a self-employed builder. In 1964, he began working as business manager for a hospital and convalescent home.

==Assassination of Kennedy==
At the moment of the assassination, Bowers was operating the Union Terminal Company&#x27;s two-story interlocking tower, overlooking the parking lot around 120 yards north of the grassy knoll and west of the Texas School Book Depository.
He had an unobstructed view of the rear of the concrete pergola and the stockade fence at the top of the grassy knoll. He described hearing three shots that came from either the Depository on his left or near the mouth of the Triple Underpass railroad bridge on his right; he was unsure because of the reverberation from the shots.

===Witness to JFK assassination===
On April 2, 1964, Lee Bowers provided testimony to Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the Warren Commission, at the US Post Office Building in Dallas. When asked by Ball, &quot;Now, were there any people standing on the high side—high ground between your tower and where Elm Street goes down under the underpass toward the mouth of the underpass?&quot; Bowers testified that at the time the motorcade went by on Elm Street, four men were in the area: one or two uniformed parking lot attendants, one of whom Bowers knew; and two men standing 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 m) apart near the Triple Underpass, who did not appear to know each other. One was &quot;middle-aged, or slightly older, fairly heavy-set, in a white shirt, fairly dark trousers&quot; and the other was &quot;younger man, about midtwenties, in either a plaid shirt or plaid coat or jacket.&quot; One or both were still there when the first police officer arrived &quot;immediately&quot; after the shooting. Many simply assumed that Bowers meant that these men were standing behind the stockade fence at the top of the grassy knoll.

Bowers further stated: &quot;At the time of the shooting there seemed to be some commotion (...)&quot; on the high ground above Elm Street. When asked about this commotion, he added : &quot;I just am unable to describe rather than it was something out of the ordinary, a sort of milling around, but something occurred in this particular spot which was out of the ordinary, which attracted my eye for some reason, which I could not identify.&quot;

Two years later, when Bowers was interviewed by assassination researchers Mark Lane and Emile de Antonio for their documentary film &quot;Rush to Judgment&quot;, he clarifiedthough the researchers chose to withhold it from their finished productthat these two men were standing in the opening between the pergola and the stockade fence, and that &quot;no one&quot; was behind the fence when the shots were fired; Bower&#x27;s words to Lane and de Antonio, published in 2004 by Dale K. Myers from their source material, were:&quot; 

These two men were standing back from the street somewhat at the top of the incline and were very near two trees which were in the area. And one of them, from time to time as he walked back and forth, disappeared behind a wooden fence which is also slightly to the west of that. These two men to the best of my knowledge were standing there at the time of the shooting.

Bowers added, 

Now I could see back or the South side of the wooden fence in the area, so that obviously that there was no one there who could have - uh - had anything to do with either - as accomplice or anything else because there was no one there - um - at the moment that the shots were fired. 

But in his testimony, Bowers explained that from his elevated position, he could see over the top of the fence and observed no one on the &quot;south&quot; side who could have been an accomplice to the men he saw on the railroad yard side of the fence.

Asked if the two men were in the area at the time the motorcycle officer came up the incline, Bowers said,

I - as far as I know, one of them was. The other I could not say. The darker dressed man was too hard to distinguish from the trees. The one in the white shirt, yes; I think he was.

It is important to note that at the time the motorcycle officer ascended the knoll, witnesses Emmett Joseph Hudson and Francis Lee &quot;F. Lee&quot; Mudd were seated on the concrete steps of the grassy knoll and were out of Bowers&#x27; line of sight. Therefore, Bowers could not have been referring to these individuals.

Bowers told Lane that as the motorcade passed &quot;there was a flash of light or smoke&quot; in the vicinity of where the two men were standing.

==Death==
Bowers died in August 1966, when his car left an empty road and struck a concrete bridge abutment near Midlothian, Texas.

==Portrayals==

Bowers was played by Pruitt Taylor Vince in the 1991 film &quot;JFK&quot;.

The timeline includes all heads of state of Lithuania as a sovereign entity, legitimately part of a greater sovereign entity, a client state, or a constituent republic subject to an outside authority. Currently, the head of state is the President of Lithuania.

During the inaugurations of Lithuanian monarchs until 1569, the Gediminas&#x27; Cap was placed on the monarch&#x27;s heads by the Bishop of Vilnius in Vilnius Cathedral.

===House of Jagiellon (1440–1569)===

The act of personal union with Poland was signed as early as 1385; however, the continuous line of common rulers of the two countries started only with Casimir IV (even then, Polish and Lithuanians twice selected different rulers following the death of an earlier common monarch, but the Lithuanian one always eventually assumed the Polish throne). The monarchs retained separate titles for both parts of the state, and their numbering was kept separate. The Jagiellon dynasty was a direct continuation of the Gediminids.

==Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795)==
The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was established by the Union of Lublin in 1569. The elected King of Poland was automatically a Grand Duke of Lithuania (until then the Lithuanian dukedom was hereditary). The first common ruler of both countries was Sigismund II Augustus.

During the Deluge of the Second Northern War, Lithuania signed the Union of Kėdainiai with the Swedish Empire in 1655, thus &quot;de jure&quot; ending its union with Poland. However, due to Sweden&#x27;s losses, the agreement soon fell out of favor and was not properly enforced, leading to the further continuation of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Following the partitions in 1772, 1793, and 1795, the commonwealth ceased to exist and Lithuania proper became part of the Russian Empire for 123 years. There are some gaps in the timeline as it took a while to elect a new king. The first Grand Duke elected after the Gediminid line became extinct and after the Valois fled back to France was Stephen Báthory, who had made an effort to be recognized as Grand Duke of Lithuania by establishing Vilnius University.

==Kingdom of Lithuania (1918)==

The Council of Lithuania declared independence on 16 February 1918 and invited Wilhelm of Urach to become king of Lithuania. The name of the state was the Kingdom of Lithuania. On 9 July 1918, Duke Wilhelm accepted the offer and took the name Mindaugas II. However, on 2 November the council revoked this decision as it was likely Germany would lose the war.

Following Lithuania&#x27;s occupation by the Soviet Union on 15 June 1940, in his telegram dated 31 May 1940, the last Foreign Minister Juozas Urbšys provisioned that, in the event of occupation, Stasys Lozoraitis, minister extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Rome, be appointed the head of the Lithuanian diplomatic service. The Lithuanian diplomatic service became a Government in exile that was a critical piece to ensuring the recognition of the continuity of Lithuanian legal statehood until independence after the Dissolution of the Soviet Union.

== Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1941) ==

The Soviet Union occupied Lithuania and established the Lithuanian SSR in July 1940.

As Nazi Germany attacked the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa, Lithuania liberated itself with the anti-Soviet June Uprising and re-declared Lithuanian Independence. Lithuania was ruled for some time by the Provisional Government of Lithuania, whose prime minister was Juozas Ambrazevičius. The Provisional Government was formed on 23 June 1941, but was dissolved on 5 August of the same year.

Lithuania was occupied by the Germans, who formed &quot;Generalbezirk Litauen&quot; on 25 July 1941, which was governed by the administration of general commissioner Adrian von Renteln and was a part of &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot;.

=== General Commissioners of Generalbezirk Litauen ===


== Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1944–1990) ==

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet &quot;de jure&quot; acted as a collective head of state from 25 August 1940 to 11 March 1990. However, the Supreme Soviet &quot;de facto&quot; was controlled by the Communist Party of Lithuania led by the First Secretary.

=== First Secretaries of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Lithuania ===

<text>Red Stripe is a 4.7% ABV pale lager brewed by Desnoes &amp; Geddes in Jamaica and the Netherlands. Since 2015 Red Stripe has also been brewed in the United Kingdom by Heineken under licence from Desnoes &amp; Geddes. It was first introduced in 1928 from a recipe developed by Paul H. Geddes and Bill Martindale. In 1993, Guinness Brewing Worldwide, now Diageo, acquired a controlling interest in Desnoes &amp; Geddes, and took over international distribution in many markets. In 2015, Heineken acquired Diageo&#x27;s stake and stated it would launch an offer for the shares it did not own.

==History==

Red Stripe was first produced in the early 1930s by Galena Brewing Company in Galena, Illinois, US. The company sold the recipe to British investors after facing financial troubles. The investors brought the brand and recipe to Jamaica. 

Red Stripe was brewed under license in the UK from Desnoes and Geddes by the Bedford-based brewers, Charles Wells from 1976 until 2014, when Diageo made alternative supply arrangements. For part of the Charles Wells era, they brewed a stronger variant, the 9% ABV Crucial Brew, with branding in red and black.

The acquisition of Diageos&#x27; stake by Heineken in 2015 subsequently saw the production of Red Stripe return to the United Kingdom.

In 1993, 51 per cent ownership in Desnoes &amp; Geddes Limited was purchased by Guinness Brewing Worldwide, now Diageo, an acquisition that significantly increased the international distribution of both Red Stripe and Dragon Stout. A new Red Stripe Light has also been added, which is brewed and bottled in Jamaica and imported by Guinness USA of White Plains, New York.

===United States===
Red Stripe was first imported to the United States in 1985, with poor initial results. Seeking to mimic the success of Heineken, Red Stripe for export was packaged in green standard bottles. American consumers exposed to Red Stripe through their travels to Jamaica, as well as Jamaican expatriates, were reluctant to try the brand in the States since it was not packaged in its distinctive squat brown bottle and painted label. This marketing issue was resolved only to have shipments temporarily suspended in January 1989 due to cannabis smuggling in shipping containers discovered in the Port of Miami. Red Stripe recovered and rode the popularity of dance hall and reggae in the early 1990s to well over a million cases of annual distribution. Red Stripe is a significant sponsor of reggae, ska, and other music events, including the annual Reggae Sumfest hosted in Montego Bay.

Diageo introduced canned Red Stripe, brewed under contract by Moosehead in New Brunswick, to the United States market in 2009.

In the U.S. in 2010, the bottling size was reduced from a typical 12 oz. per serving to 11.2 oz. per serving which is equivalent to the typical metric serving of 0.33 litre.

In 2012, Diageo moved production of the U.S. supply of Red Stripe from Jamaica to the U.S., contract-brewed for it by City Brewing Co. of La Crosse, Wisconsin, at its Latrobe Brewing Company facility in Pennsylvania. Desnoes &amp; Geddes still made Red Stripe for Jamaica, Brazil, Canada and Europe.

Lack of consumer acceptance of U.S.-brewed Red Stripe resulted in brewing for the States returning to Jamaica. On 7 September 2016 the company celebrated the shipment of the first container of Red Stripe to be exported to the United States from Jamaica in 4 years. The company said this historic move was core to the company&#x27;s mission of re-establishing Jamaica as the global hub for the Jamaican brand. 

It was still being imported to the U.S. in 2023, from Jamaica in bottles, and the Netherlands in kegs and cans.

In North America, a television advertising campaign launched in 2001 features Dorrel Salmon playing a comedic take on a Jamaican man, using variations on the catchphrase, &quot;Hooray, beer!&quot; In the UK, the advertising campaign plays on the &#x27;easy vibe&#x27; of Jamaican Beer, with catchphrases such as &quot;easy now.&quot;

==Sponsorship==
Red Stripe has been an intermittent sponsor of the Jamaica national bobsled team. In February 2018, following turmoil within the Jamaica Olympic women&#x27;s bobsled team, Red Stripe stepped in at the last minute to sponsor a new bobsled so that the team could compete in the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympics as planned.

Other major sporting sponsorship activities have included a commitment as the Caribbean regional sponsor for the 2007 Cricket World Cup and a J$100 million sponsorship commitment to the Jamaican Football Federation in support of the national team&#x27;s regional qualifying efforts for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

In 2007, under the guidance of brand manager Jonny Kirkham, Red Stripe initiated a campaign in the UK to support new music by sponsoring events such as the Camden Crawl and The Great Escape festivals, as well as hosting a number of free music events with artists such as The View and The Rifles. Recent work with new bands puts this initiative in direct competition with the likes of Carling as a featured sponsor of the underground music scene. In support of this promotional strategy, the Red Stripe Music Awards were initiated between 2007 and 2010, with the winner of the award receiving featured billing at two music festivals, Blissfields and The Great Escape, and the opportunity to tour with a high-profile act. Winners of the award included The Runners, Ben Howard, Klaus Says Buy The Record, and The Laurel Collective, while judges ranged from musicians such as Guy Garvey, music journalists and brand representatives from Red Stripe. As a result, brand sales grew significantly with Red Stripe becoming available throughout Camden, Manchester, Glasgow, Brighton and in key music venues across the UK. During this period, Red Stripe continued to be the unofficial beer of the Notting Hill Carnival which it has been since 1976.

Writer and music festival PR Alex Lee Thomson also presented a series of web-based interviews for the brand during their sponsorship periods of Camden Crawl and The Great Escape festivals in the UK, while editing their music-based website.

Red Stripe sponsors sports talk television program &quot;Pardon the Interruption&quot; during the summer months, alternating with Guinness. Also recently Red Stripe began sponsoring the International Festival of Thumb Wrestling held annually in Mason City, Iowa. Red Stripe also sponsored Ignite Urban competition along with SUM Entertainment.

Red Stripe Light has also been announced as the official beer category Major Sponsor for the 2010 &quot;Zwack&quot; Air Hockey World Championships taking place in July 2010 in Houston, Texas.

<text>Vipul Ved Prakash is a software engineer and Internet entrepreneur. He is the co-founder of anti-spam company Cloudmark, social-media search company Topsy, and open-source AI company TogetherAI.

In 2013, Topsy was acquired by Apple Inc. The acquisition was reported to be valued over $200M.

In early 2000s, Prakash became widely known for creating Vipul&#x27;s Razor, a popular open-source anti-spam system. He was named to the list of 2003&#x27;s Top 100 young innovators in the world by MIT Technology Review for this work on anti-spam, at the age of 25.

== Early life ==

Vipul Ved Prakash grew up in New Delhi, India. He played competitive table tennis, and attended St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi for undergraduate studies in mathematics, physics and computer science, but dropped out to pursue his interests in software design.

== Work ==

In the late 1990s, Prakash co-founded, with Ashish Gulhati, an Internet privacy company (Sense/Net) for early Internet users in India, and wrote for computer magazines and industry journals, including a regular column, &quot;Net Zeppelin&quot;, on networking protocols for the Indian edition of &quot;PC World Magazine&quot;.

Prakash has authored several extensions to the Perl programming language that are published under open source licenses and distributed via CPAN.

In May, 2000, Prakash and Rishab A. Ghosh published the &quot;Orbiten Free Software Survey&quot;, which is considered to be one of the first successful attempts at building an empirical model of contribution to open source projects.

Prakash worked at Napster as an engineer. He co-founded Cloudmark along with Napster’s co-founder Jordan Ritter, to provide a commercial alternative to his open-source filter, Vipul&#x27;s Razor.

Prakash considers himself a cypherpunk. He created a dolphin-shaped implementation of RSA algorithm in Perl that was printed on a T-shirt and sold by ThinkGeek as a protest against restrictive exports laws.

Since Topsy&#x27;s acquisition by Apple, Prakash has served as a Director of Engineering at Apple, Inc and is rumored to be leading a growing search program inside the company. He appeared on the WWDC 2015 stage to introduce iOS Search APIs.

<doc id="670655" wikidata="Q3775631" url="?curid=670655" title="Kolob">
<text>Kolob is a star 
or planet described in the Book of Abraham, a sacred text of the Latter Day Saint movement. Several Latter Day Saint denominations claim that the Book of Abraham was translated from an Egyptian papyrus scroll by Joseph Smith, the founder of the movement. According to this work, Kolob is the heavenly body nearest to the throne of God. While the Book of Abraham calls Kolob a &quot;star&quot;, it also calls planets &quot;stars&quot;, and therefore some Latter Day Saint commentators consider Kolob a planet. The body also appears in Latter Day Saint culture, including a reference to Kolob in an LDS hymn.

==Doctrine and exegesis==

===Description in the Book of Abraham===
The first published reference to Kolob is in the Book of Abraham, first published in 1842 in &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; and now included within the Pearl of Great Price as part of the canon of Mormonism. The Book of Abraham 1:1–2:18 were dictated in 1835 and the remaining part in 1842 by Smith after he purchased a set of Egyptian scrolls that accompanied a mummy exhibition. According to Smith, the scrolls described a vision of Abraham, in which Abraham:

saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God; ... and the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.

In an explanation of an Egyptian hypocephalus that was part of the Joseph Smith Papyri, Smith interpreted one set of hieroglyphics as representing:

Kolob, signifying the first creation, nearest to the celestial, or the residence of God. First in government, the last pertaining to the measurement of time. The measurement according to celestial time, which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit. One day in Kolob is equal to a thousand years according to the measurement of the Earth, which is called by the Egyptians Jah-oh-eh.

The Book of Abraham describes a hierarchy of heavenly bodies, including the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun, each with different movements and measurements of time, where at the pinnacle, the slowest-rotating body is Kolob, where one Kolob-day corresponds to 1000 Earth-years. The time also applies to other celestial bodies in the vicinity of Kolob, such as Oliblish, and other neighboring objects. This is similar to , which says, &quot;For a thousand years in [God&#x27;s] sight are but as yesterday when it is past&quot; and , which says, &quot;one day is with the Lord as a thousand years&quot;. Additional, similar information about Kolob is found in the Kirtland Egyptian Papers, constituting manuscripts in the handwriting of Smith and his scribes.

===Mormon exegesis and speculation===
According to the traditional, literal Mormon interpretation of the Book of Abraham, Kolob is an actual star in this universe that is, or is near, the physical throne of God. According to Smith, this star was discovered by Methuselah and Abraham by looking through Urim and Thummim, a set of seer stones bound into a pair of spectacles. LDS Church leader and historian B. H. Roberts (1857–1933) interpreted Smith&#x27;s statements to mean that the Solar System and its governing &quot;planet&quot; (the Sun) revolved around a star known as Kae-e-vanrash, which itself revolved with its own solar system around a star called Kli-flos-is-es or Hah-ko-kau-beam, which themselves revolve around Kolob, which he characterized as &quot;the great centre of that part of the universe to which our planetary system belongs&quot;. Roberts was confident that astronomers would confirm this hierarchy of stars orbiting other stars.

The literal interpretation of Kolob as a star or planet had significant formative impact on Mormon belief and criticism, leading to conceptions such as that the Biblical creation is a creation of the local Earth, Solar System, or galaxy, rather than the entire known physical universe.

====Star versus planet====
The Book of Abraham is unclear as to whether Kolob is a star or a planet, and Mormon writings have taken both positions. One part of the Book of Abraham states that Abraham &quot;saw the stars ... and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God; ... and the name of the great one is Kolob.&quot; But the book defines the word &quot;Kokaubeam&quot; (a transliteration of the Hebrew &quot;כּוֹכָבִים&quot; [c.f., Gen. 15:5]) as meaning &quot;all the great lights, which were in the firmament of heaven&quot;. This would appear to include planets as among the &quot;stars&quot;, and the Book of Abraham calls Earth a star. In addition, it appears to classify Kolob among a hierarchy of &quot;planets&quot;. On the other hand, in the Egyptian Alphabet and Grammar paper, Kolob is classified as one of 12 &quot;fixed stars&quot;, as distinct from 15 &quot;moving planets&quot;. The term &quot;fixed stars&quot; generally refers to the background of celestial objects that do not appear to move relative to each other in the night sky, including all stars other than the Sun, nebulae and other starlike objects. Though &quot;fixed&quot;, such objects were proven to have proper motion by Edmund Halley in 1718. Apparently referring to proper motion, Smith said that Kolob moves &quot;swifter than the rest of the twelve fixed stars&quot;. Also, the Book of Abraham refers to &quot;fixed planets&quot;, thereby including planets in the set of celestial objects that may be &quot;fixed&quot;. It also calls the Sun a &quot;governing planet&quot;, further complicating the terminology. So it is unclear whether Smith understood Kolob to be a planet or a star.

Writers in the Latter Day Saint movement have taken both positions on the issue. Brigham Young, second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), spoke of Kolob as a planet, as did LDS Church apostles John Taylor, Orson Pratt (a mathematician with an interest in astronomy), Orson F. Whitney, and Alvin R. Dyer. Other Mormon theologians have also viewed Kolob as a planet, but several Mormon writers have called Kolob a star, including B. H. Roberts and LDS Church president David O. McKay.

====Birthplace for the Earth====
According to several Mormon writers (such as W. Cleon Skousen in his book &quot;The First 2000 Years&quot;), the Earth was created near Kolob over a period of 6,000 years, then moved to its present position in the Solar System. This hypothesis is based on oral comments attributed to Smith. The hypothesis is also based on a passage from the Book of Abraham stating that in the Garden of Eden, time was measured &quot;after the Lord&#x27;s time, which was after the time of Kolob; for as yet the Gods had not appointed to Adam his reckoning&quot;. According to the hypothesis, the reason that Earth time was measured in Kolob time was that the Earth was near Kolob. As a corollary, some Mormon writers argue that at the end times, the Earth will be plucked from the Solar System and returned to its original orbit near Kolob.

LDS Church apostle Bruce R. McConkie came to a different conclusion, arguing that during the first &quot;day&quot; of creation (not necessarily a 1,000-year &quot;day&quot; in Kolob time, a &quot;day&quot; meaning a phase of creation), Earth was formed and placed in orbit around the Sun.

The idea that the Earth was formed elsewhere and then migrated to orbit around the Sun does not accord with the scientific theory of Earth&#x27;s formation, which is that the Earth formed in orbit around the Sun about 4.5 billion years ago by accretion from a protoplanetary disk, and has remained near its original orbit until the present.

====Speculative astronomy====
Several Mormon authors have attempted to situate Kolob within modern astronomy. Skousen speculated that Kolob is a star at the Galactic Center, Sagittarius A*, of our own galaxy. This view also had the support of several former general authorities of the LDS Church, including J. Reuben Clark and George Reynolds (with Janne M. Sjödahl). In the mid-19th century, early efforts to find a single &quot;central sun&quot; in the galaxy failed.

Another Mormon author has hypothesized that Kolob exists outside the Milky Way at a place called the &quot;metagalactic center&quot;, and that this galaxy and other galaxies rotate around it. Within mainstream astronomy, the idea of a metagalactic center was once assumed, but has been abandoned because on large scales, the expanding universe has no gravitational center.

Another Mormon author has speculated that Kolob is Polaris.

===Metaphorical exegesis===
In addition to the literal interpretation of Kolob as an actual heavenly body, the LDS Church has proposed that Kolob is also &quot;a symbol of Jesus Christ&quot;, in that like Kolob, Jesus &quot;governs&quot; all the stars and planets similar to the Earth.

A metaphorical interpretation suggests that Kolob may be construed as a metaphor for Jesus.

==Analysis and criticism==

===Origin===

Some Mormon scholars have sought to link the Kolob doctrine to ancient astronomy. have sought to show that this astronomy is more consistent with ancient geocentrism than with 19th-century Copernican and Newtonian astronomy, and thus carries with it the misconceptions of ancient astronomy. For example, in their interpretation, Kolob is the highest and slowest moving of a series of concentric heavenly spheres, which are centered on Earth. These authors believe that Smith, in the 19th century, would not have made this geocentric mistake about Kolob, and therefore, they argue that the Book of Abraham is of ancient origin. John Tvedtnes suggested that &quot;Another possible Hebrew etymology is the Hebrew KLB &#x27;dog&#x27; originally pronounced kalb just as it is in Arabic. This is used to denote the star Regulus in Arabic while the Syriac, which is also kalb denotes the star Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens.&quot; He also suggested that the Hebraic use of &quot;KLB&quot; as both the word &quot;dog&quot; and an astronomical term refers to the universality of Sirius as the &quot;Dog Star&quot;.

According to Fawn Brodie, Smith&#x27;s idea of Kolob may have been derived from the &quot;throne of God&quot; idea found in Thomas Dick&#x27;s &quot;The Philosophy of a Future State&quot;, which Brodie said Smith &quot;had recently been reading&quot; before dictating the Book of Abraham, and which &quot;made a lasting impression&quot; on him.

==In popular culture==

===&quot;If You Could Hie to Kolob&quot;===
&quot;If You Could Hie to Kolob&quot; (, &quot;hurry&quot;) is a Latter-day Saint hymn by early Mormon W. W. Phelps. The music is taken from a well-known folk tune known as &quot;Dives and Lazarus&quot;. It was originally published in 1842 in &quot;Times and Seasons&quot; and is hymn number 284 in the LDS Church&#x27;s current hymnal. The hymn makes only one reference to Kolob, in its first line (from which the hymn&#x27;s title is derived). It is the only hymn in the current hymnal that mentions Kolob.

The hymn reflects doctrines unique to Mormonism, such as the eternal nature of spirit (including man&#x27;s spirit) and matter. It also conveys doctrines elaborated by Smith, the first Latter-day Saint prophet, about the plurality of gods and eternal progression.

The tune was arranged by Ralph Vaughan Williams (1906) for the &quot;English Hymnal&quot; and can be found in today&#x27;s hymnals under the name &quot;Kingsfold&quot;. The tune is also used in other hymns: &quot;O Sing a Song of Bethlehem&quot;, &quot;I Heard the Voice of Jesus&quot;, and &quot;We Sing the Mighty Power of God&quot;.

The tune was also arranged for use in the film &quot;Plan 10 from Outer Space&quot;.

===Kolob as the inspiration for Kobol in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;===
Some of the elements of the two &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; science-fiction television shows seem to be derived from the Mormon beliefs of its creator and chief producer, Glen A. Larson. In both the original series from 1978, and the 2003 new series, the planet Kobol is the ancient and distant mother world of the entire human race and the planet where life began, and the &quot;Lords of Kobol&quot; are sacred figures to the human race. They are treated as elders or patriarchs in the old series, and versions of the Twelve Olympians in the new series. According to academic Jana Riess, this is one of many plot points Larson has borrowed from Mormonism.

<text>Great Court is the main court of Trinity College, Cambridge, and reputed to be the largest enclosed courtyard in Europe.

The court was completed by Thomas Nevile, master of the college, in the early years of the 17th century, when he rearranged the existing buildings to form a single court.

==Description==


Starting in the northeast corner at E staircase, in which Isaac Newton had his rooms, and moving clockwise, one first reaches the Porters&#x27; Lodge and Great Gate, begun in 1490 as the entrance to King&#x27;s Hall and completed in 1535. The Great Gate holds the famous statue of Henry VIII, whose sceptre was replaced by a chair leg by students in the 19th century. Next comes the East Range, and staircases F-K (with J omitted) that contain the college bursary and rooms principally housing fellows of the college. Staircase I leads to Angel Court, containing rooms for students and fellows, and to the college bar.

The South Range runs from staircases L–Q with rooms for students and fellows, with Queen&#x27;s Gate (named after Elizabeth I of England) as its centrepiece. R staircase can be found in a passage leading to Bishop&#x27;s Hostel, while S staircase is on the left in the passage leading past the Hall into Nevile&#x27;s Court. The West Range is dominated by the Great Hall, the college&#x27;s dining hall modelled on that of Middle Temple, and the Master&#x27;s Lodge.

The fourth side begins with staircases A–C, before reaching King&#x27;s Gate (also called Edward III Gateway), and the entrance to the oldest part of the college, the remaining surviving buildings of King&#x27;s Hall. Originally built on the site of the current sundial in the middle of the court, Nevile moved it 20 metres north when completing the court. King&#x27;s Gate also houses the famous Trinity College Clock that chimes every 15 minutes and strikes the hour twice. The clock was installed at the request of Master of Trinity Richard Bentley in the 17th century, striking each hour once for the college of his mastership, Trinity, and once for his alma mater, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge.

In the centre of the court is an ornate fountain, built during Nevile&#x27;s time, and fed by a pipe from Conduit Head in west Cambridge.

==The Great Court Run==

Many have tried to run the 339 metres (371 yards) around the court in the time it takes to strike 12 o&#x27;clock (actually 24 chimes owing to an old tradition). The run was recreated, filmed in Eton College rather than Trinity, in the 1981 film &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;.

Students traditionally attempt to complete the circuit, in what is known as the &quot;Great Court Run&quot;, on midday before the Matriculation Dinner. Only three people are believed to have actually completed the run in the time, the first being Lord Burghley in 1927. Contrary to the depiction in &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;, Harold Abrahams never attempted the Run.

Sebastian Coe and Steve Cram attempted the feat in a charity race on 29 October 1988. Coe&#x27;s time was reported by Norris McWhirter to have been 45.52 seconds, but it was actually 46.0 seconds as confirmed by the video tape, while Cram&#x27;s was 46.3 seconds. The clock on that day took 44.4 seconds and video confirms that Coe was approximately 12 metres short of his finish line when the fateful final stroke occurred. There is some debate over the dying sounds of the bell being included in the striking time, which would allow Coe&#x27;s run to be claimed as successful. The event was organized by 36-year-old undergraduate Nigel McCrery and raised £50,000 for the Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children.

In 2007, Sam Dobin was seen to &#x27;beat&#x27; the clock in a time of 42.77s, improving on his 3rd-place finish the previous year. Dobin&#x27;s achievement received national newspaper coverage which reported it as the fastest time in the history of the race, beating Burghley and Coe&#x27;s efforts.

From 2012 to 2014, Cornelius Roemer won the run three times in a row, and beat the clock in his 2014 run.

In 2019, George Mears beat the clock, although as he acknowledged &quot;the clock was slow this year&quot; meaning his time of 48.12 was sufficient.

The route taken by competitors around the court was temporarily changed — allowing running on the cobbles rather than the path — cutting the distance down to 297m (the perimeter of the grass) as opposed to 341m (the perimeter of the cobbles). This is about 13% shorter, making the accomplishment significantly more attainable. From 2017 onwards, the organisers decided to enforce the original route for competitive runners, restoring the historical difficulty of the race.

Each year, a costumed run is also held for all non-competitive participants, the best costumes are selected by the Dean of Triniy College.

David Cecil, the only man to achieve the Great Court Run prior to 2007, and Sebastian Coe, the man who came closest to achieving the feat between Cecil&#x27;s and Dobin&#x27;s successes, both achieved the distinctions of Olympic Champion, Member of both Houses of Parliament, and Chairman of the London Olympics Organising Committee (David Cecil at the 1948 Olympics, Sebastian Coe at the 2012 Olympics).

Other factors affect the timing of the Great Court Run. The speed at which the bells strike is governed by a mechanical &quot;fly&quot;, details of which are recorded by The Trinity Clock Monitoring Project. The &quot;fly&quot; uses air resistance to govern the speed at which the striking mechanism turns and consequently the speed varies, depending mainly on the air density; the duration to the striking of twelve depends on the meteorological conditions on the race day. On a cold, dry, high-pressure day the bells strike more slowly than on a warm, humid low-pressure day. This can cause variation of as much as 5 seconds to the normal time of around 48 seconds. The official run takes place in October, when the likely variation is a more modest one second. Runners will have the best chance of completing the circuit before the bells have finished on a cold winter&#x27;s day. The chime speed is also affected by the number of days since the chimes were last wound, three being optimal.

== Caucus Race ==
A less structured event, the &quot;Caucus Race&quot;, occurs during the summer long vacation when undergraduates who have summer courses gather all around Great Court just before two o&#x27;clock dressed in their academic robes. Great Court is divided into six rectangular lawns and the objective of the race is to circumnavigate all six individually and in all their combinations, which requires a mathematical brain to plan well, and end at the fountain. The entry fee is a pint of beer. As soon as the clock starts to strike everyone starts running around whatever route they have chosen, much to the consternation of the tourists. On reaching the fountain everyone gets a prize of a pint of beer. It has been done in 14 minutes but that is exceptional.

== Chapel ==
The final part of the court is completed by the chapel, begun by Mary I in 1554 in memory of her father. The ante-chapel contains statues of many famous Trinity men, including Roubiliac&#x27;s sculpture of Isaac Newton, Thomas Woolner&#x27;s piece of William Whewell and the altarpiece is Benjamin West&#x27;s &quot;St Michael and the Devil&quot;.

The chapel contains a fine organ built by the Swiss firm of Metzler in 1975 — one of only two instruments by this respected maker in Great Britain. It is contained within the restored late seventeenth-century case built by perhaps England&#x27;s most famous organ builder &quot;Father&quot; Smith. The Metzler organ incorporates some surviving pipes from this instrument.

==Dimensions==
The exact external dimensions of the four sides of Great Court are:
* South — 87.8m (82.5m)
* West — 105.2m (99.9m)
* North — 78.3m (69.4m)
* East — 99.4m (88.9m)
which enclose an area of approximately 1.8 acres (7,300 square metres). (The figures given in parentheses are the distances run on the flagstones for the Great Court Run)

<text>Josef Bühler (16 February 1904 – 22 August 1948) was a German lawyer who, as the protégé of Governor General Hans Frank, rose to become his deputy as the State Secretary in the Nazi Germany-controlled General Government in Kraków during the Second World War. He participated in the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned. He was convicted of crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity, and was executed.

== Early life and education ==
Bühler was born in Bad Waldsee into a Catholic family, the son of a baker. He attended boarding school and obtained his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1922. He went on to study law at the universities in Munich, Kiel, Berlin and Erlangen. He earned a Doctor of Law degree and passed the state law examination in 1930. That year, he joined the Munich law firm of Hans Frank, who regularly defended Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in court. From this point on, his professional life was closely linked with that of Frank. On 1 October 1932, he was made a probationary judge at the Munich district court.

== Career in Nazi Germany ==
Shortly after the Nazi seizure of power at the end of January 1933, Frank was appointed as the Minister of Justice for Bavaria on 10 March and Bühler became a member of his staff as a state attorney. He joined the Nazi Party on 1 April 1933 (membership number 1,663,751). He also was given a senior position in the National Socialist Association of German Legal Professionals. Bühler also joined Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law, was made a member of its presidium and contributed articles to the academy journal.

In October 1934, after the process of &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; (coordination) transferred sovereignty from the states to the central government, Bühler moved from Bavaria to become a prosecutor in the Reich Ministry of Justice in Berlin. In 1935, he became the senior prosecutor at the Munich &quot;Oberlandesgericht&quot; (Higher Regional Court). After Frank was appointed as a minister without portfolio in Hitler&#x27;s cabinet, he brought Bühler into his ministerial office as a &quot;Ministerialrat&quot; (Ministerial Counselor) in 1938. Unlike many other high-ranking Nazi officials, Bühler was never a member of the SA or the SS. 

Just before the outbreak of the war, Bühler was conscripted into the German Army in August 1939 but Frank obtained his release within days. After the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany in September 1939, Frank was appointed Governor General for the occupied Polish territories at the end of October and Bühler accompanied him to Kraków. On 8 December, he was made head of the Governor General&#x27;s office with the rank of &quot;Ministerialdirektor&quot; and, on 8 March 1940, he advanced to the position of State Secretary. After Arthur Seyss-Inquart, Frank&#x27;s Deputy Governor General, departed to become the &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; of the occupied Netherlands in May 1940, Bühler functioned as Frank&#x27;s deputy, a designation that was made permanent in June 1941. Though not given the formal title of Deputy Governor General, as State Secretary he was Frank&#x27;s chief deputy and represented him during his absences. 

=== Wannsee Conference and the Final Solution ===

Bühler attended the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942 as the representative of the Governor General&#x27;s office. This conference was called to discuss the implementation of the Final Solution of the Jewish Question. The minutes of the meeting document Bühler stating that the General Government would welcome the launch of the Final Solution in its territory, and he stressed the importance of solving &quot;the Jewish Question in the General Government as quickly as possible&quot;. He also stated that &quot;of the two-and-a-half million Jews concerned, the majority are unfit for work&quot;. When his fellow conference participant Adolf Eichmann was asked at his 1961 trial in Israel what was meant by this statement, he answered that Bühler had wanted to intimate &quot;that they should be killed&quot;.

== Arrest, trial and execution ==
Bühler fled from Kraków back to Germany on 18 January 1945, the day before The Red Army entered the city. He was arrested in Schrobenhausen on 30 May 1945 by American forces and interned in Nuremberg. He testified in Frank&#x27;s defense at the Nuremberg Trials on 23 April 1946, denying all knowledge of the Holocaust and trying to deflect all blame onto the SS, in particular, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler and SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger, the Higher SS and Police Leader for the General Government.

Shortly afterward, on 25 May 1946, in accordance with the Moscow Declarations that established the principle that war criminals were to be transferred for trial to the nations where their crimes took place, Bühler was extradited to the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. His trial opened before the Supreme National Tribunal on 17 June 1948. Bühler was found guilty on 10 July of crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. He was sentenced to death and ordered to forfeit all of his property. Clemency pleas were filed by Bühler, his attorney, his wife and Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber of Munich. All were rejected by Polish President Bolesław Bierut, and Bühler was executed by hanging on 22 August 1948 at Montelupich Prison in Kraków.

== Portrayals in popular media ==
Bühler&#x27;s death is the inciting incident in the 1992 alternate history novel &quot;Fatherland&quot; by Robert Harris. The novel postulates a long war between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and a cold war with the United States. The novel&#x27;s protagonist investigates Bühler&#x27;s murder in 1964, which is part of a Gestapo effort to conceal the (by then completed) Final Solution.

Bühler was portrayed by Reinhard Glemnitz in the German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; (1984), by Ben Daniels in the BBC/HBO film &quot;Conspiracy&quot; (2001) and by in the German film &quot;Die Wannseekonferenz&quot; (2022).

<doc id="670666" wikidata="Q8012" url="?curid=670666" title="Derby Museum and Art Gallery">
<text>Derby Museum and Art Gallery is a museum and art gallery in Derby, England. It was established in 1879, along with Derby Central Library, in a new building designed by Richard Knill Freeman and given to Derby by Michael Thomas Bass. The collection includes a gallery displaying many paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby; there is also a large display of Royal Crown Derby and other porcelain from Derby and the surrounding area. Further displays include archaeology, natural history, geology, military collections and world cultures. The Art Gallery was opened in 1882.

==History==

The museum can trace its start to the formation of the Derby Town and County Museum and Natural History Society on 10 February 1836. The society was housed by Full Street Public Baths but it was a private society funded by its members&#x27; subscriptions. Its collections were created by donations initially from Dr Forrester who had been a President of Derby Philosophical Society. The patron of the Museum Society was William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, and the President was Sir George Crewe who was a keen naturalist. Col. George Gawler contributed a collection of minerals and exotic stuffed birds which included an albatross from his time as governor in South Australia. In 1839 a major exhibition was held at the Mechanics&#x27; Institute which contained many items including those from Joseph Strutt&#x27;s collection. Many of these made their way into Derby Museum&#x27;s collection. The society moved in 1840 to the Athenaeum in Victoria Street. The society&#x27;s collections grew in 1856 and they were first offered for incorporation into the town by William Mundy, but the offer was rejected.

In 1857, Llewellyn Jewitt became secretary and the museum was opened to the general public on Saturday mornings. In 1858 the Derby Philosophical Society moved to a house on the Wardwick in Derby as it merged with what was called the Derby Town and County Museum and the Natural History Society. This move included the society&#x27;s library of 4,000 volumes, mathematical and scientific apparatus and its collection of fossils. In 1863 the botanist Alexander Croall was appointed the first Librarian and Curator and the following year the museum and library were joined together. Croall left in 1875 to become the curator of the Smith Institute in Stirling.

The Derby Town and County Museum was finally transferred into the ownership of Derby Corporation in 1870, but there were difficulties in finding space to display the collections. After placing all the artefacts into storage for three years, the museum was finally opened to the public on 28 June 1879. The Art Gallery opened in 1882 and in 1883 the museum had electricity supplied for new lighting.

In 1936 the museum was given a substantial collection of paintings by Alfred E. Goodey who had been collecting art for 50 years. At his death in 1945 he left £13,000 to build an extension to the museum. The extension, which now houses the museum, was completed in 1964. Refurbishment to parts of both the new and old buildings were undertaken in 2010–11.

In 2012, over 1,000 items were stolen from the museum&#x27;s storage facility between 2 May and 19 June. The museum did not know about the theft until they accessed the facility to remove an item from storage. Stolen items included coins, medals, and watches. A man was charged with receiving stolen goods in connection with the theft in January 2013. Some of the items stolen were recovered.

==Derby and the Enlightenment connection==

Derby was significant in the eighteenth century for its role in the Enlightenment, a period in which science and philosophy challenged the divine right of kings to rule. The enlightenment has many strands, including the largely philosophical Scottish Enlightenment centred around the philosopher David Hume, and political changes that culminated in the French Revolution, but the English Midlands was an area where many key figures of industry and science came together. The Lunar Society included Erasmus Darwin, Matthew Boulton, Joseph Priestley and Josiah Wedgwood with Benjamin Franklin corresponding from America. Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, started the Derby Philosophical Society when he moved to Derby in 1783.

Some of the paintings by Joseph Wright of Derby, which are renowned for their use of light and shade, are of Lunar Society members. The Derby Gallery possesses over 300 sketches and 34 oil paintings by Wright, and also holds a document collection. One of the paintings is entitled &quot;The Alchymist in Search of the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1771) and it depicts the discovery of the element phosphorus by German alchemist Hennig Brand in 1669. A flask into which a large quantity of urine has been boiled down is seen bursting into light as the phosphorus, which is abundant in urine, ignites spontaneously in air.

&quot;A Philosopher Lecturing on the Orrery&quot; shows an early mechanism for demonstrating the movement of the planets around the Sun. The Scottish scientist, astronomer and lecturer James Ferguson undertook a series of lectures in Derby in July 1762. They were based on his book &quot;Lectures on Select Subjects in Mechanics, Hydrostatics, Pneumatics, Optics &amp;c.&quot;, published in 1760. In order to illustrate his lectures he used various machines, models and instruments. Wright possibly attended Ferguson&#x27;s lecture, especially as tickets for the event were available from John Whitehurst, his close neighbour, the clockmaker and scientist. The artist could also have drawn on Whitehurst&#x27;s practical knowledge to find out more about the orrery and its operation.

==Significance of Joseph Wright&#x27;s paintings==

These factual paintings are considered to have metaphorical meaning too, the bursting into light of the phosphorus in front of a praying figure signifying the problematic transition from faith to scientific understanding and enlightenment, and the various expressions on the figures around the bird in the airpump indicating concern over the possible inhumanity of the coming age of science. These paintings represent a high point in scientific enquiry which began the undermining of the power of religion in Western societies. Some ten years later scientists worldwide found themselves persecuted, or even put to death in the backlash to the French Revolution of 1789, itself the culmination of enlightenment thinking. Joseph Priestley, member of the Lunar Society and discoverer of oxygen fled Britain after his laboratory in Birmingham was smashed and his house burned down in the Birmingham riots of 1791, by a mob objecting to his outspoken support for the French Revolution; and his colleague Lavoisier in France was executed at the guillotine. The politician and philosopher Edmund Burke, in his famous &quot;Reflections on the Revolution in France&quot; (1790), tied natural philosophers, and specifically Priestley, to the French Revolution, writing that radicals who supported science in Britain &quot;considered man in their experiments no more than they do mice in an air pump&quot;. In the light of this comment, Wright&#x27;s painting of the bird in the air pump, completed over twenty years earlier, seems particularly prescient.

Because of this web of connections related to science, and the tensions it created which were so subtly illustrated by the art of the painter Joseph Wright of Derby, Derby Museum and Art Gallery, far from being just a collection of fine paintings as the casual visitor might imagine, is significant for being in a place that some would see as having a very significant role in the birth of modern science and industry worldwide.
==Wright of Derby==
In 2011, Derby City Council announced that it was to use Joseph Wright of Derby to brand the city of Derby. At the same time, the Museum announced that it was &quot;joining forces&quot; with Wikipedia to improve the quality of its information. In February 2011 the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council (MLA) announced that it had awarded Designated status to Derby Museum and Art Gallery for its nationally significant holdings of paintings and drawings by Joseph Wright.

The museum houses a replica of the room in Derby where Charles Edward Stuart held his council of war in 1745, while on his way south to seize the British crown. The panelling is from the original Exeter House, which was demolished in 1854. The panels were brought to the museum, which then received related objects as donations. Queen Victoria provided an original letter of Bonnie Prince Charlie from her own collection.

==Other artists==
Besides the Wright collection there are also works by Benjamin West, E. E. Clark, Robert Priseman, Harold Gresley, Alfred John Keene, Georg Holtzendorff, David Payne, George and William Lakin Turner, Ernest Townsend, Samuel and Louise Rayner.

==Soldier&#x27;s Story gallery==
The Soldier&#x27;s Story gallery is dedicated to the history of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers, the Sherwood Foresters and the Derbyshire Yeomanry.

==Wider collection==

A fragment of a cross shaft from Repton includes on one face a carved image of a mounted man which, it has been suggested, may be a memorial to Æthelbald of Mercia. The figure is of a man wearing mail armour and brandishing a sword and shield, with a diadem around his head. In 757, Æthelbald was killed at Seckington, Warwickshire, near the royal seat of Tamworth and buried at Repton, Derbyshire. If this is Æthelbald, it would make it the earliest large-scale pictorial representation of an English monarch.

The museum has a large collection of items from the Bretby Art Pottery.

<doc id="670670" wikidata="Q2298968" url="?curid=670670" title="Songs from the Last Century">
<text>Songs from the Last Century is the fourth solo studio album by English singer-songwriter George Michael, released on 6 December 1999 by Aegean Records and Virgin Records. Produced by Michael and Phil Ramone, it was his only album of cover versions. It consists mainly of old jazz standards plus new interpretations of more recent popular songs, such as &quot;Roxanne&quot; by the Police and &quot;Miss Sarajevo&quot; by U2 and Brian Eno with Luciano Pavarotti. Both songs were released as promotional singles.

==History==
This album is the only album in Michael&#x27;s entire solo catalogue to not reach number one on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number two instead. It was kept off the top spot by Shania Twain&#x27;s &quot;Come On Over&quot;.

A music video for &quot;Roxanne&quot; was shot in Amsterdam, in the so-called Red District, using ordinary people, not actors, who really live their lives on the street.

Another version exists of the album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?&quot;, sung by Michael with Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti at one of his famous &quot;Pavarotti and Friends&quot; live shows. This version is included on the limited edition of Michael&#x27;s 2006 greatest hits album, &quot;Twenty Five&quot;.

<doc id="670675" wikidata="Q7004570" url="?curid=670675" title="Nevile's Court, Trinity College, Cambridge">
<text>Nevile&#x27;s Court is a court in Trinity College, Cambridge, England, created by a bequest by the college&#x27;s master, Thomas Nevile.

The east side is dominated by the college&#x27;s Hall, and the north and south sides house college rooms for fellows (and a few students) raised above the cloisters. The court is regarded as the sanctum sanctorum of the college by fellows and students on account of the difficulty of obtaining rooms there.

It was in the north cloister that Isaac Newton stamped his foot to time the echoes and determine the speed of sound for the first time.

The initial court, completed in 1612, was approximately 60% of its current length and its west side consisted of a wall in which was set a gate leading to the river-bank. (The gate, known as the &quot;Nevile Gate&quot;, now stands as an entrance to the college from Trinity Lane.)

The west side was transformed from 1673 onwards when the master, Isaac Barrow, persuaded his friend Christopher Wren to design a library for the college. The Wren Library was completed in 1695 and is a masterpiece of the classical style. At the same time, the north and south sides were extended to reach the new library. Rooms on the north side of the range were paid for by Sir Thomas Sclater, who laid out 800&quot;l&quot; for the purpose. The &quot;Old Guest Room&quot; on the south side of the range bears the mottos &#x27;Vernon semper viret&#x27; and &#x27;Le bon temps viendra&#x27; in lozenges on the ceiling.

Nevile&#x27;s Court was extensively restored and remodelled in the 18th century when the gables, which are shown on the print of the College made by David Loggan, were removed.

<text>Wilhelm Stuckart (16 November 1902 – 15 November 1953) was a German Nazi Party lawyer, official, and a State Secretary in the Reich Interior Ministry during the Nazi era. He was a co-author of the Nuremberg Laws and a participant in the January 1942 Wannsee Conference, at which the genocidal Final Solution to the Jewish Question was planned. He also served as &quot;Reichsminister&quot; of the Interior in the short-lived Flensburg government at the end of the Second World War.

==Early life==
Stuckart was born in Wiesbaden, the son of a railway employee. He had a Christian upbringing. Stuckart was active in the far right early on and joined the Freikorps von Epp in 1919 to resist the French occupation of the Ruhr. In 1922, he started studying law and political economy at the universities of Munich and Frankfurt am Main, and joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in December that year; he remained a member until the party was banned after the failed putsch of 1923. To support his parents, Stuckart temporarily abandoned his studies to work at the Nassau Regional Bank in Frankfurt in 1924. He finished his studies in 1928, receiving a doctorate with a thesis entitled &quot;Erklärung an die Öffentlichkeit, insbesondere die Anmeldung zum Handelsregister&quot; (&quot;Declarations to the Public, Especially Concerning the Enrollment to the Trade Register&quot;); he passed the bar examination in 1930.

==Career==
From 1930, Stuckart served as a district court judge. He renewed his association with the NSDAP and provided party comrades with legal counseling during this period. He did not rejoin the party immediately, as judges were prohibited from being politically active. To circumvent this restriction, Stuckart&#x27;s mother joined the party for him as member number 378,144. From 1932 to 1933, he worked as a lawyer and legal secretary for the SA in Stettin (today, Szczecin), Pomerania.

Stuckart&#x27;s quick rise in the German state administration was unusual for a person of modest background and would have been impossible without his long dedication to the Nazi cause. On 4 April 1933 he became the Mayor and State Commissioner in Stettin and was also elected to the state parliament and the Prussian State Council. On 15 May 1933, Stuckart was appointed Ministerial Director of the Prussian Ministry of Science, Art and Culture, and on 30 June 1933, he was made a State Secretary. In 1934, Stuckart was intimately involved in the dubious acquisition of the Guelph Treasure of Brunswick (the &quot;Welfenschatz&quot;) – a unique collection of early medieval religious precious metalwork, at that time in the hands of several German-Jewish art dealers from Frankfurt, and one of the most important church treasuries to have survived from medieval Germany – by the Prussian State under its Prime Minister Hermann Göring.

On 7 July 1934, Stuckart became the State Secretary and head of the Central Office in the recently established Reich Ministry of Science, Education and Culture under Bernhard Rust. However, after disagreements with his superior, he was placed on leave for disobedience in September and was involuntarily retired on 14 November 1934. He moved to Darmstadt, where he worked from February to March 1935 as the president of the superior district court. On 7 March 1935, Stuckart began serving in the Reich Ministry of Interior, Division I: Constitution and Legislation, with the responsibility for constitutional law, citizenship and racial laws. Promoted to Ministerial Director on 1 April 1935, he was on 13 September 1935 given the task of co-writing, together with Hans Pfundtner, Bernhard Lösener and , the antisemitic &quot;Law for the Protection of German Blood and German Honour&quot; and &quot;The Reich Citizenship Law&quot;, together better known as the Nuremberg Laws, which the Nazi-controlled &quot;Reichstag&quot; passed on 15 September 1935. In 1936, Stuckart became a member of the Academy for German Law and chairman of its committee on administrative law.

Part of Stuckart&#x27;s duties in the Interior Ministry involved providing a legal framework justifying the Nazi expansionist policy under constitutional and international law. On 16 March 1938, Hitler charged him with the management of the office carrying out the unification of Austria with the Reich, and he drafted the implementing decree. He was formally promoted to State Secretary in the Interior Ministry on 1 April 1938. In October, he was similarly charged with administering the transfer of the Sudetenland and, in March 1939, drafted the decree on the formation of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

On 18 August 1939, Stuckart signed a confidential decree regarding the &quot;Reporting Obligations of Deformed Newborns,&quot; which became the basis for the Nazi regime&#x27;s euthanasia of children. Two years later, Stuckart&#x27;s own one-year-old son, Gunther, who was born with Down syndrome, became a victim of this programme.

Stuckart was a member of the SA from 1932 and applied for membership in the SS in December 1933. On the recommendation of Heinrich Himmler, Stuckart finally transferred to the SS on 13 September 1936 (member number 280,042) with the rank of SS-&quot;Standartenführer&quot;. He was awarded the Golden Party Badge on 30 January 1939 and was promoted to the rank of SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; on 30 January 1944.

===As a legal theorist===
A prolific writer, Stuckart came to be seen as one of the leading Nazi legal experts, focusing especially on racial laws and public administration. In 1936 Stuckart, as the chairman of the &quot;Reich Committee for the Protection of German Blood&quot;, together with Hans Globke co-authored the government&#x27;s official &quot;Commentary on German Racial Legislation&quot; in elaboration of the Reich Citizenship and Blood Protection Laws. The commentary explains that the laws were based on the concept of &quot;Volksgemeinschaft&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s community&quot;) to which every German was bound by common blood. Individuals were not members of society (a concept viewed by the Nazi legal theorists as a Marxist one) but born members of the German &quot;Volk&quot;, through which they acquire rights. Interests of the &quot;Volk&quot; were to always override those of the individual. People born outside of the &quot;Volk&quot; were seen to possess no rights and represent a danger to the purity of the people&#x27;s community. As such, anti-miscegenation legislation was justified, even necessary. Stuckart stated that these laws represented &quot;a preliminary solution of the Jewish question&quot;.

In October 1939, Stuckart was tasked with investigating the comprehensive rationalization of the state administrative structure by decentralisation and simplification. The streamlining was to especially concern the field administration, which was to undergo extensive unification, preferably leading to a model of a small Interior Ministry supervising a single system of field agencies fielding broad local powers. Stuckart proposed that the state and party should effectively be combined in an overarching concept of the &quot;Reich&quot;, and should co-operate at the highest levels of power, so that ground-level friction between the institutions could be solved by referencing upwards. Stuckart and his disciples distinguished (administrative mastery) from an idealised (leadership).
The transformation of the state administration from a technical apparatus for the application of norms to a means of political leadership was the central idea in Stuckart&#x27;s model: the ideal Nazi civil servant was not to be a passive lawyer of the obsolete &quot;liberal constitutional state&quot;, but a &quot;pioneer of culture, coloniser and political and economic creator&quot;. The administrative structure of the &quot;Reichsgaue&quot;, where the party and state authorities were combined and the &quot;Gauleiter&quot; fielded almost dictatorial powers over his domain, reflected Stuckart&#x27;s theorization.

===&quot;Generalplan West&quot;===

A memorandum written on 14 June 1940 by Stuckart or someone in his vicinity in the Interior Ministry discusses the annexation of certain areas in Eastern France to the German Reich. The document presents a plan to weaken France by reducing the country to its late mediaeval borders with the Holy Roman Empire and replacing the French populace of the annexed territories by German settlers. This memorandum formed the basis for the so-called &quot;north-east line&quot; (also called the &quot;black line&quot; and the &quot;Führer line&quot;) drawn in the occupied French territories after the Second Armistice at Compiègne, which stretched from the mouth of the River Somme to the Jura Mountains (see map). Because of the historical motivation for the area&#x27;s Germanisation, cities and regions were to revert to their traditional German names. Nancy, for instance, would be known thereafter as &quot;Nanzig&quot;, and Besançon as &quot;Bisanz&quot;. Historian Peter Schöttler refers to this plan as a western equivalent of the &quot;Generalplan Ost&quot;.

===Wannsee Conference===
Stuckart represented Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick at the Wannsee Conference of 20 January 1942 chaired by SS-&quot;Obergruppenführer&quot; Reinhard Heydrich, which discussed the imposition of the &quot;Final Solution of the Jewish Question in the German Sphere of Influence in Europe&quot;. According to the minutes of the conference, Stuckart supported forced sterilization for persons of &quot;mixed blood&quot; instead of extermination.

Heydrich called a follow-up conference on 6 March 1942, which further discussed the problems of &quot;mixed blood&quot; individuals and mixed marriage couples. At this meeting, Stuckart argued that only first-degree &quot;Mischlinge&quot; (persons with two Jewish grandparents) should be sterilized by force, after which they should be allowed to remain in Germany and undergo a &quot;natural extinction&quot;. He had stated:

I have always maintained that it is extraordinarily dangerous to send German blood to the opposing side. Our adversaries will put the desirable characteristics of this blood to good use. Once the half Jews are outside of Germany, their high intelligence and education level, combined with their German heredity, will render these individuals born leaders and terrible enemies.
Stuckart was also concerned about causing distress to German spouses and children of &quot;interracial&quot; couples.

==After World War II==

Stuckart served briefly as Interior Minister in Karl Dönitz&#x27;s Flensburg Government in May 1945. When that government was dissolved by the Allies, Stuckart was arrested on 23 May, interned in Camp Ashcan and called as an expert witness at the Nuremberg trial of Wilhelm Frick. He himself was tried by the Nuremberg Military Tribunal in the Ministries Trial in 1948 for his role in formulating and carrying out anti-Jewish laws. The court characterized him as an ardent Jew-hater who was able to pursue his anti-Semitic campaign from the safety of his ministerial office. Former co-worker Bernhard Lösener from Interior Ministry testified that Stuckart had been aware of the murder of the Jews even before the Wannsee Conference. Stuckart&#x27;s defense argued that his support for the forced sterilization of &quot;Mischlinge&quot; was to prevent or delay even more drastic measures. The court was unable to resolve the question and sentenced him to time served in April 1949.

After being released from captivity, Stuckart went to work as city treasurer in Helmstedt and then as the manager of the Institute for the Promotion of Economy in Lower Saxony. He also worked for the regional committee of the right-wing All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights. In 1951, he was tried in a de-Nazification court, classified as a &quot;fellow traveller&quot; (&quot;Mitläufer&quot;) and fined five hundred &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot;.

==Death==
Stuckart was killed on 15 November 1953 near Hanover, West Germany, in a car accident a day before his 51st birthday. There has been widespread speculation that the &quot;accident&quot; was, in reality, a staged collision targeting Stuckart as a former Nazi involved in Nazi racial and anti-Jewish policies and activities. However, nothing has ever been openly admitted by Mossad or other groups known to have been involved in other attacks on former Nazis.

==Personality==
Stuckart held firm opinions concerning racial legislation and administrative organisation. At the Ministries Trial, his personal assistant Hans Globke described him as a &quot;convinced Nazi&quot; whose political faith weakened as time went on. From May 1940 onward, Stuckart made several requests to be released from his job to military service in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, but these were turned down personally by Hitler.

<doc id="670687" wikidata="Q1141534" url="?curid=670687" title="Crossposting">
<text>Crossposting, also known as x-posting or xposting, is the act of posting one message to multiple information channels; forums, mailing lists, or newsgroups. This is distinct from multiposting, which is the posting of separate identical messages, individually, to each channel, (a forum, a newsgroup, an email list, or topic area). Enforcement actions against crossposting individuals vary from simple admonishments up to total lifetime bans. In some cases, on email lists and forums, an individual is put under a stealth ban where their posts are distributed back to them as if they were being distributed normally, but the rest of the subscribers are not sent the messages. This is easily detected if the Stealthed individual has two different, and totally non-associated identities in the channel, such that the non-stealthed identity will see a different set of messages, lacking the posts of the stealthed individual, in their view of the channel.

Crossposting to groups that are irrelevant to the message posted could be considered spamming. Moreover, excessive crossposting is generally considered bad form because it multiplies traffic without adding any new content. In the extreme case, if all messages were crossposted to every email list or forum, then every email list or group would look exactly the same. A crossposter can minimize this problem by specifying that all responses be directed to a single group.

==Crossposting in Usenet==
In Usenet, the destination newsgroup(s) for a particular message is indicated in the &quot;codice_1&quot; line. Most commonly, just one newsgroup is specified. For example;

codice_2

However, it is possible to specify that the message is intended for more than one newsgroup.

codice_3

In this case, the message will be visible both in the codice_4 and codice_5 newsgroups. Despite appearing in two separate places, only one message has been posted. This has several advantages.

* A crossposted message takes up less server storage space, and creates less network traffic, than if individual messages had been posted to multiple newsgroups.
* Usenet reader software can intelligently track whether or not the user has already viewed the message in one newsgroup, even though they might currently be looking at another newsgroup. If multiple individual messages had been posted (i.e. the message&#x27;s content was &quot;multiposted&quot;), each would appear to be a new unread message in each newsgroup.
* Replies to crossposted messages will be, by default, also crossposted, and so conversations can occur between readers of the multiple newsgroups without any confusion, so long as nobody &quot;breaks the thread&quot; by changing the groups they post their reply to. This enables readers of one of the newsgroups in the crosspost to provide corrections, etc. to information posted by somebody in a different newsgroup. By adding a &quot;codice_6&quot; line a poster can indicate that answers to his post should be posted to another set of newsgroups than those listed by the &quot;codice_1&quot; line.
* It avoids the fragmentation of replies which tends to occur with multiposted messages. It helps to avoid time wasted on writing a reply which has, in essence, been posted on another newsgroup but which the replier has not seen because they do not read that newsgroup or have not yet looked there.

Crossposting is usually practiced when material is relevant and of interest to the readers of more than one newsgroup. However, sometimes it is used maliciously to begin a thread between newsgroups whose readers are likely to have violently differing opinions, in the hope of provoking a conflict. This is a form of trolling.

Crossposting to more than a small number of newsgroups is likely to be counterproductive. A commonly suggested limit is three newsgroups.

Some NNTP servers drop posts which are crossposted to more than a set number of newsgroups, especially if no &quot;codice_6&quot; line exists.

==Crossposting on Reddit==
On Reddit, users may crosspost from one subreddit to another, as long as they are a member of the target subreddit and it allows crossposting. A crosspost includes an embed of the original post, but also has its own score and comments section.

<doc id="670688" wikidata="Q6244212" url="?curid=670688" title="John Laws (judge)">
<text>Sir John Grant McKenzie Laws (10 May 1945 – 5 April 2020) was a Lord Justice of Appeal. He served from 1999 to 2016. He was the Goodhart Visiting Professor of Legal Science at the University of Cambridge, and an Honorary Fellow of Robinson College, Cambridge.

==Early life==
Laws was born on 10 May 1945, the son of Dr Frederic Laws and his wife Dr Margaret Ross, &quot;née&quot; McKenzie, the daughter of the Congregational minister and academic John Grant McKenzie. He was educated at Durham Chorister School, and as a King&#x27;s Scholar at Durham School. He studied at Exeter College, Oxford as a Senior Open Classical Scholar, receiving a First Class BA in 1967, and an MA in 1976. He became an honorary fellow of the college in 2000.

==Legal career==
He was called to the Bar at the Inner Temple in 1970, and appointed a Bencher in 1985. He was appointed First Junior Treasury Counsel (Common Law) in 1984, and a Recorder in 1985, holding both positions until his appointment to the High Court in 1992.

===Judicial career===
Laws was appointed a High Court Judge in 1992, serving in the Queen&#x27;s Bench Division, and was knighted at this time. He served until 1998, and in 1999 was appointed to the Court of Appeal as a Lord Justice of Appeal and appointed to the Privy Council.

====Notable decisions====

&quot;Thoburn v Sunderland City Council&quot; 2002 – Perhaps Sir John&#x27;s most famous decision, and extremely controversial in the public law sphere. In it he recognises principles in common law contrary to parliamentary sovereignty. The foundation of his decision was on four propositions:

# All the specific rights and obligations which EU law creates are by the ECA incorporated into our domestic law and rank supreme: that is, anything in our substantive law inconsistent with any of these rights and obligations is abrogated or must be modified to avoid the inconsistency. This is true even where the inconsistent municipal provision is contained in primary legislation. 
# The ECA is a constitutional statute: that is, it cannot be impliedly repealed. A constitutional statute can, however, be explicitly repealed by a subsequent statute.
# The truth of (2) is derived, not from EU law, but purely from the law of England: the common law recognises a category of constitutional statutes. 
# The fundamental legal basis of the United Kingdom&#x27;s relationship with the EU rests with the domestic, not the European, legal powers. In the event, which no doubt would never happen in the real world, that a European measure was seen to be repugnant to a fundamental or constitutional right guaranteed by the law of England, a question would arise whether the general words of the ECA were sufficient to incorporate the measure and give it overriding effect in domestic law. But that is very far from this case. 
&quot;R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings&quot; – Sir John sat in the first instance hearing of this historic case, concerning the legality of a decision made to prohibit hunting on a small area of land which the council had acquired and was argued to maintain under s120(1)(b) Local Government Act 1972.

&quot;McFarlane v Relate Avon Ltd&quot; – Sir John attracted considerable press attention for stating &quot;The promulgation of law for the protection of a position held purely on religious grounds [...] is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary.&quot; This was in response to a witness statement submitted by former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey that Christians should be afforded special protections under equality legislation on the grounds of earnestly held religious belief.

==Constitutional theory==
Sir John Laws is noted for his extrajudicial writings in the journal, &quot;Public Law&quot;. His most notable contribution, &quot;Law and Democracy&quot;, asserts that the constitution would be undemocratic if it gave all the power under it to the elected government. Therefore, it is the constitution, and not Parliament, that should be sovereign in the British constitution. He posits that the constitution must create a &quot;higher-order law&quot; in which human rights and constitutional fundamentals in a democracy can be protected by the courts against the abuses of government. This position stems from a fundamental distrust of the political constitution in holding the executive to account. It is similar in form to Quintin Hogg, Lord Hailsham&#x27;s claim that in Britain there is an &quot;elective dictatorship&quot;. Sir John does not see this shift to the legal sphere as being anti-democratic because judges uphold apolitical values that no politician would contest and are above the arguments that take place in the political sphere between politicians of political parties.

These statements are certainly controversial and have been fiercely contested by academics such as John Griffith and Martin Loughlin, both professors at the London School of Economics. The essential arguments made by these authors are to the effect that the metaphysical principles that Sir John cites are highly contentious. A good example of this is Laws&#x27; love of freedom of expression. When is it right for racist or sexist comments to be illegal? Whilst for Griffith it should be up to a democratically elected legislature to decide such tricky moral issues, for Laws it is firmly a matter of law for the judges to decide. The problem with the latter approach, according to Griffith, stems from the fact that judges cannot be removed if the decisions they make are judged to be wrong by citizens of a polity. For Laws, on the other hand, such counter-majoritarianism is a beneficial aspect of the law, which acts to protect those that are vulnerable in society against the tyranny of the majority.

==Personal life==

Sir John married Sophie Susan Sydenham Cole Marshall in 1973, with whom he had one daughter. Lady Laws died in 2017. He was a member of the Garrick Club. He was the maternal uncle of political adviser Dominic Cummings.

Sir John Laws was the Visitor at Cumberland Lodge since 2004.

On 5 April 2020, he died in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where he was originally being treated for sepsis and other conditions, due to health complications from COVID-19.

<doc id="670694" wikidata="Q678658" url="?curid=670694" title="Kwantung Leased Territory">
<text>The Kwantung Leased Territory () was a leased territory of the Empire of Japan in the Liaodong Peninsula from 1905 to 1945.

Japan first acquired Kwantung from the Qing Empire in perpetuity in 1895 in the Treaty of Shimonoseki after victory in the First Sino-Japanese War. Kwantung was located at the militarily and economically significant southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula at the entrance of the Bohai Sea, and included the port city of Ryojun (Port Arthur/Lüshunkou). Japan lost Kwantung weeks later in the Triple Intervention and the Qing transferred the lease to the Russian Empire in 1898, who governed the territory as Russian Dalian and rapidly developed infrastructure and the city of Dairen (Dalniy/Dalian). Japan re-acquired the Kwantung lease from Russia in 1905 in the Treaty of Portsmouth after victory in the Russo-Japanese War, continued to rapidly develop the territory, and obtained extraterritorial rights known as the South Manchuria Railway Zone. Japan extended the lease with the Republic of China in the Twenty-One Demands and used Kwantung as a base to launch the Second Sino-Japanese War. The Kwantung Leased Territory ceased to exist following the Surrender of Japan in World War II in September 1945 when the Soviet Red Army began to administer the region until Kwantung and the Lüshun base was handed over to the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 16 April 1955.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Kwantung&quot; () is a historical name for Manchuria that literally translates to &quot;east of (Shanhai) Pass&quot; (Manchuria was separated from the rest of China by the Great Wall, and Shanhai Pass was the main pass used to travel between the two). The peninsula extending from southern Manchuria (now called the Liaodong Peninsula) was therefore often called the &quot;Guandong (Kwantung) Peninsula&quot;. The leased territory was located on this peninsula, so took its name from it. 

In Japanese, Kwantung is pronounced &quot;Kantō&quot; and it is often referred to as &quot;Kantō-shū&quot; to avoid confusion with the Kantō region surrounding the capital Tokyo.

==History==

In Qing dynasty China, the Liaodong Peninsula () was administratively part of Liaoning Province. In 1882, the Beiyang Fleet established a naval base and coaling station at Lüshunkou near the southern end of the peninsula.

The Empire of Japan occupied the region during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), and under the terms of the Treaty of Shimonoseki signed by Japan and China ending the war in April 1895, Japan gained full sovereignty of the area. However, within weeks, Germany, France and Russia pressured Japan to cede the territory back to China, in what was called the Triple Intervention.


In December 1897, Russian naval vessels entered Lüshunkou harbor, which they began to use as a forward base of operations for patrols off of northern China, Korea and in the Sea of Japan. The Russian Empire renamed the harbor Port Arthur. In March 1898 Russia formally leased the region for 25 years from China. The leased area extended to the northern shore of Yadang Bay on the western side of the peninsula; on the eastern side it reached Pikou; Yevgeni Ivanovich Alekseyev, chief of Russian Pacific Fleet, became the head of this territory. The peninsula north of the lease was made a neutral territory in which China agreed not to offer concessions to other countries. In 1899, Russia founded the town of Dalniy (meaning &quot;distant&quot; or &quot;remote&quot;), just north of the naval base at Port Arthur. This would later become the city of Dalian (Dairen).

In 1898 Russia began building a railroad north from Port Arthur to link Dalniy with the Chinese Eastern Railway at Harbin; this spur line was the South Manchurian Railway.

Under the Portsmouth Treaty (1905) resulting from the Russo-Japanese War, Japan replaced Russia as leaseholder. Port Arthur was renamed Ryojun (), and Dalniy was renamed Dairen (). Japan also obtained extraterritorial rights in the region north of the territory adjacent to the South Manchurian Railway in 1905 (i.e. the South Manchuria Railway Zone), which was extended north of Mukden to Changchun. These rights, along with the railway and several spur lines were passed to the corporation known as the South Manchurian Railway Company.

Japan established the to administer the new territory, and based the Kwantung Garrison to defend it and the railway. The Kwantung Garrison later became the Kwantung Army, which played an instrumental role in the founding of Manchukuo. In negotiations with the Republic of China under the Twenty-One Demands, the terms of the lease of the Kwantung Leased Territory were extended to 99 years.

After the foundation of Japanese-controlled Manchukuo in 1932, Japan regarded the sovereignty of the leased territory as transferred from China to Manchukuo. A new lease agreement was contracted between Japan and the government of Manchukuo, and Japan transferred the South Manchurian Railway Zone to Manchukuo. However, Japan retained the Kwantung Leased Territory as a territory apart from the nominally-independent Manchukuo until its surrender at the end of World War II in 1945.

After World War II, the Soviet Union occupied the territory and the Soviet Navy made use of the Ryojun Naval Base. The Soviet Union turned it over to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1955.

==Administration==
In a reorganization of 1919, the Kwantung Garrison was renamed the Kwantung Army and separated from the civilian administration of the territory, which was designated the . The Kantō-cho initially directly reported to the office of the Prime Minister of Japan; later it was subordinated to the Ministry of Colonial Affairs. Internally, the Kwantung Leased Area was divided into two districts, with two cities and nine towns. The city assemblies were in part elected, and in part appointed by the governor.

==Economy==
Massive capital investment was concentrated in Dairen (now the capital of the territory), wherein Japanese firms developed a significant industrial infrastructure, as well as creating a first class port out of the mediocre natural harbor. The facilities of the port at Dairen and its free trade port status made it the principal trade gateway to northeast China. The South Manchurian Railway Company was headquartered in Dairen, and some of the profits from its operation were channelled into transforming Dairen into a showcase city of modern city planning and modern architecture, with hospitals, universities and a large industrial zone.

==Demographics==
In the Japanese national census of 1935, the population of the Kwantung Leased Territory was 1,034,074, of whom 168,185 were Japanese nationals. The numbers excluded military personnel. The area of the territory was .

<doc id="670695" wikidata="Q1129598" url="?curid=670695" title="Feline immunodeficiency virus">
<text>Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a &quot;Lentivirus&quot; that affects cats worldwide, with 2.5% to 4.4% of felines being infected.

FIV was first isolated in 1986, by Niels C Pedersen and Janet K. Yamamoto at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine in a colony of cats that had a high prevalence of opportunistic infections and degenerative conditions and was originally called Feline T-lymphotropic virus. It has since been identified in domestic cats.

==Effects==
FIV compromises the immune system of cats by infecting many cell types, including CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages. FIV can be tolerated well by cats, but can eventually lead to debilitation of the immune system in its feline hosts by the infection and exhaustion of T-helper (CD4+) cells.

FIV and HIV are both lentiviruses. However, humans cannot be infected by FIV, nor can cats be infected by HIV. FIV is transmitted primarily through deep bite wounds, where the virus present in the infected cat&#x27;s saliva enters the body tissues of another cat. FIV-positive cats can share water bowls, food bowls (for both wet and dry cat food), and use the same litter box with low danger of transmitting the disease. A vigilant pet owner who treats secondary infections can allow an infected cat to live a reasonably long life. The chance that an FIV-infected cat will pass the virus to other cats within a household is low, unless there is fighting between cats, or wounds present that could allow entry of the virus from infected to non-infected cat.

Newborn kittens may test positive for up to six months and most thereafter will gradually test negative. It is thought that this is due to antibodies transferred to the kittens via the mother&#x27;s milk. However these antibodies are transient so subsequent testing will be negative. Once they have received vaccinations against FIV, they will, in the future, always test positive, as the various blood tests detect and show the antibodies that have developed in response to the vaccination.

FIV is known in other feline species, and in fact is endemic in some large wild cats, such as African lions. Three main clades of FIV are recognized as of 2006, FIV-Ple (lion), FIV-Fca (domestic cat), and FIV-Pco (puma). The host boundaries are usually well-kept due to the limited types of APOBEC3 enzymes viral infectivity factor can neutralize.

===In the United States===
Consensus in the United States on whether there is a need to euthanize FIV-infected cats has not been established. The American Association of Feline Practitioners (an organization in the United States), as well as many feral cat organizations, recommends against euthanizing FIV-positive cats, or even spending funds to test for the virus.

==Pathology==

The virus gains entry to host cells through the interaction of its own envelope glycoproteins with the target cells&#x27; surface receptors. First, the SU glycoprotein binds to CD134, a receptor on the host cell. This initial binding changes the shape of the SU protein to one that facilitates interaction between SU and the chemokine receptor CXCR4. This interaction causes the viral and cellular membranes to fuse, allowing the transfer of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm, where it is reverse transcribed and integrated into the cellular genome through nonhomologous recombination. Once integrated into the host cell&#x27;s genome, the virus can lay dormant in the asymptomatic stage for extended periods of time without being detected by the immune system or can cause lysis of the cell.

CD134 is predominantly found on activated T cells and binds to OX40 ligand, causing T-cell stimulation, proliferation, activation, and apoptosis (3). This leads to a significant drop in cells that have critical roles in the immune system. Low levels of CD4+ and other affected immune system cells cause the cat to be susceptible to opportunistic diseases once the disease progresses to feline acquired immune deficiency syndrome (FAIDS).

==Transmission==
The primary mode of transmission is via deep bite wounds, in which the infected cat&#x27;s saliva enters the other cat&#x27;s tissues. FIV may also be transmitted from pregnant females to their offspring in utero; however, this vertical transmission is considered to be relatively rare, based on the small number of FIV-infected kittens and adolescents. This differs from FeLV, which may be spread by more casual, non-aggressive contact, such as mutual grooming and sharing of food bowls.

Risk factors for infection include male sex, adulthood, and outdoor access. One case study conducted in São Paulo found that 75% of FIV-infected cats were males. Higher rates of infection in males than females occurs due to biting being more frequently engaged in by males defending their territory.

==Disease stages==
FIV progresses through similar stages to HIV. The initial stage, or acute phase, is accompanied by mild symptoms such as lethargy, anorexia, fever, and lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph nodes). This initial stage is fairly short and is followed by the asymptomatic stage. Here the cat demonstrates no noticeable symptoms for a variable length of time. Some cats stay in this latent stage for only a few months, but for some it can last for years. Factors that influence the length of the asymptomatic stage include the pathogenicity of the infecting virus and FIV subtype (A–E), the age of the cat, and exposure to other pathogens. Finally, the cat progresses into the final stage (known as the feline acquired immune deficiency syndrome (FAIDS) stage), wherein the cat is extremely susceptible to secondary diseases that inevitably are the cause of death.

==Testing==
Veterinarians will check a cat&#x27;s history, look for clinical signs, and possibly administer a blood test for FIV antibodies. FIV affects 2–3% of cats in the US and testing is readily available. This testing identifies those cats that carry the FIV antibody but does not detect the actual virus.

&quot;False positives&quot; may occur when the cat carries the antibody (which is harmless) but does not carry the virus. The most frequent occurrence of this is when kittens are tested after ingesting the antibodies from mother&#x27;s milk (passive immunity), and when testing cats that have been previously vaccinated for FIV (active immunity). For this reason, neither kittens under eight weeks nor cats that have been previously vaccinated are tested. Kittens and young cats that test positive for the FIV antibody via passive immunity test negative later in life due to seroreversion, provided they have never been infected with FIV and have never been immunized with the FIV vaccine.

Cats that have been vaccinated will test positive for the FIV antibody for the rest of their lives owing to seroconversion, even though they are not infected. Therefore, testing of strays or adopted cats is inconclusive, since it is impossible to know whether or not they have been vaccinated in the past. For these reasons, a positive FIV antibody test by itself should never be used as a criterion for euthanasia.

Tests can be performed in a vet&#x27;s office with results in minutes, allowing for quick consultation. Early detection helps maintain the cat&#x27;s health and prevents spreading infection to other cats. With proper care, infected cats can live long and healthy lives.

==Treatment options==
In 2006, the United States Department of Agriculture issued a conditional license for a new treatment aid termed Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator (LTCI). Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is manufactured and distributed exclusively by T-Cyte Therapeutics, Inc.

Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is intended as an aid in the treatment of cats infected with feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and/or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and the associated symptoms of anemia (reduced oxygen-carrying ability in the blood), opportunistic infection, lymphocytopenia, granulocytopenia, or thrombocytopenia (low levels of lymphocytes, granulocytes, and platelets respectively, the first two are types of white blood cell). The absence of any observed adverse events in several animal species suggests that the product has a very low toxicity profile.

Lymphocyte T-Cell Immunomodulator is a potent regulator of CD-4 lymphocyte production and function. It has been shown to increase lymphocyte numbers and Interleukin 2 production in animals. It is a single-chain polypeptide and a strongly cationic glycoprotein, and is purified with cation exchange resin. Purification of protein from bovine-derived stromal cell supernatants produces a substantially homogeneous factor, free of extraneous materials. The bovine protein is homologous with other mammalian species and is a homogeneous 50 kDa glycoprotein with an isoelectric point of 6.5. The protein is prepared in a lyophilized (freeze-dried) 1 microgram dose. Reconstitution in sterile diluent produces a solution for subcutaneous injection.

==Vaccine==
As with HIV, the development of an effective vaccine against FIV is difficult because of the high number of, and differences between, variations of the virus strains. &quot;Single-strain&quot; vaccines, i.e., vaccines that only protect against a single virus variant, have already demonstrated a good efficacy against homologous FIV strains. A dual-subtype vaccine for FIV released in 2002 called Fel-O-Vax made it possible to immunize cats against more FIV strains. It was developed using inactivated isolates of two of the five FIV subtypes (or clades): A Petaluma and D Shizuoka. The vaccine was shown to be moderately protective (82% of cats were protected) against subtype A FIV, but a later study showed it to offer no protection against subtype A. It has shown 100% effectiveness against two different subtype B FIV strains. Vaccination will cause cats to have positive results on FIV tests, making diagnosis more difficult. For these reasons the vaccine is considered &quot;non-core&quot;, and the decision to vaccinate should be made after discussion with a veterinarian and consideration of the risks vs. the effectiveness.

==Structure==
FIV displays a similar structure to the primate and ungulate lentiviruses. The virion has a diameter from 80 to 100 nanometers and is pleomorphic. The viral envelope also has surface projections that are small, 8 nm, and evenly cover the surface.

The FIV virus genome is diploid. It consists of two identical single-strands of RNA in each case about 9400 nucleotides existing in plus-strand orientation. It has the typical genomic structure of retroviruses and includes LTR, &quot;vif&quot;, &quot;pol&quot;, &quot;gag&quot;, &quot;orfA&quot;, &quot;env&quot;, and &quot;rev&quot; genes. The Gag polyprotein is cleaved into matrix (MA), capsid (CA) and nucleocapsid (NC) proteins. Cleavage between CA and NC releases a nine amino acid peptide, while cleavage at the C-terminus of NC releases a 2kDa fragment (p2). The Pol polyprotein is translated by ribosomal frame-shifting, a feature shared with HIV. Cleavage of Pol by the viral protease releases the protease itself (PR), reverse transcriptase (RT), deoxyuridine triphosphatase (dUTPase or DU) and integrase (IN). The Env polyprotein consists of a leader peptide (L), surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) glycoproteins. In common with other lentiviruses, the FIV genome encodes additional short open reading frames (ORFs) encoding the Vif and Rev proteins. An additional short ORF termed &quot;orfA&quot; (also known as &quot;orf2&quot;) precedes the &quot;env&quot; gene. The function of OrfA in viral replication is unclear, however the &quot;orfA&quot;-encoded product may display many of the attributes of HIV-1 accessory gene products such as Vpr, Vpu or Nef.

Among these subtypes, genetic sequences are mostly conserved; however, wide-ranging genetic differences exist between species specific FIV subtypes. Of FIV&#x27;s genome, &quot;Pol&quot; is the most conserved across FIV strains along with &quot;gag&quot;. On the contrary, &quot;env&quot;, &quot;vif&quot;, &quot;orfa&quot;, and &quot;rev&quot; are the least conserved and exhibit the most genetic diversity among FIV strains.

The capsid protein derived from the polyprotein Gag is assembled into a viral core (the protein shell of a virus) and the matrix protein also derived from Gag forms a shell immediately inside of the lipid bilayer. The Env polyprotein encodes the surface glycoprotein (SU) and transmembrane glycoprotein (TM). Both SU and TM glycoproteins are heavily glycosylated, a characteristic that scientists believe may mask the B-cell epitopes of the Env glycoprotein giving the virus resistance to the virus neutralizing antibodies.

==Lentiviral vector==
Like HIV-1, FIV has been engineered into a viral vector for gene therapy. Like other lentiviral vectors, FIV vectors integrate into the chromosome of the host cell, where it can generate long-term stable transgene expression. Furthermore, the vectors can be used on dividing and non-dividing cells. FIV vectors could potentially be used to treat neurological disorders like Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and have already been used for transfer RNAi, which may find use as gene therapy for cancer.

== Origin and spread ==
The exact origins and emergence of FIV in felids is unknown; however, studies of viral phylogenetics, felidae speciation, and FIV occurrence alludes to origins in Africa. Analysis of viral phylogenetics shows phylogenetic trees with a starburst phylogenetic pattern which is usually demonstrated by viruses that are a recent emergence with rapid evolution. However, differences in topology, branch lengths, high genetic divergence suggest a more ancient origin in felidae species. Fossil records indicate extant felids arose from a common ancestor in Asia approximately 10.8 million years ago, and since then thirty eight species from eight distinct evolutionary lineages have spread and successfully inhabited every continent but Antarctica. Despite felidae origins in Asia, FIV is absent from felidae species in Asia except for the Mongolian Pallas cat; however, FIV is highly endemic in Africa with four out of five felids having seropositive PCR results. Due to the widespread occurrence and interspecies divergence of FIV strains in Africa, it&#x27;s suggested that FIV arose in Africa before disseminating worldwide. The high genetic diversity and divergence between FIV strains in African felidae species and the presence of hyena FIV-Ccr, is consistent with a long residence time giving rise to increased opportunities for inter-species transmission among species. Additionally, lentiviruses are also highly endemic in Africa infecting not only felids, but also primates, and ungulate species. This suggests to the origins of all lentiviruses and supports FIV origins in Africa; however, further research is needed.

The spread of FIV from Africa might have occurred during two points of felidae migration. The earliest migration across the Bering Strait into North America occurred approximately 4.5 million years ago during a period of low sea levels. Early felids in North America descended into seven species of the ocelot lineage, two species of the puma lineage, and four of the modern species of lynx. The most recent migration of Asian lions and jaguars across Eurasia into North and South America occurred during the Pliocene/early Pleistocene. These migrations events increased opportunities for FIV transmission among felids and established infections globally for felidae species.

== Evolution ==
=== Wild felids ===
Comparisons of FIV subtypes illustrate rapid evolution and highlights divergence in FIV strains. FIV-Pco, which is specific to American pumas, has two highly divergent subtypes. Several studies have demonstrated subtypes A and B to have long branch lengths and low geographic similarities which indicates the possibility of two separate FIV introductions into populations coupled with a long residence time. In the late Pleistocene, pumas fell victim to the ice age, went extinct in North America except for a small inbred population in Florida, and did not re-emerge until 10–12,000 years ago. Phylogenetic analysis of FIV-Pco strains in Central, South, and North America show Central and South American strains are more closely related to North American strains than to each other. This suggests FIV-Pco was already present in South American pumas which repopulated North America.

In African lions, FIV-Ple has diverged in to six subtypes A-F which exhibit distinct geographical endemicity to some degree. Approximately 2 million years ago, African lions arose and dispersed throughout Africa, Asia, and North, Central, and South America. Modern lions currently reside only on the African continent except for a small population in India. There is no documented disease association of FIV, but seroprevalence in free- ranging lion populations are estimated to be roughly 90%. Phylogenetic analysis of FIV-Ple subtypes A, B, and C show high intra and interindividual genetic diversity and sequence divergence comparable to genetic differences to strains from other Felidae species. These findings indicate these strains evolved in geographically distant lion populations; however, recent occurrences of these strains within populations in Serengeti National Park suggests recent convergence in the same population.

==== Prevalence in wild felids ====
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is widely distributed across Africa, Asia, North America, South America, and Central America, but it has not been found in Oceania. The virus affects a majority of species, including lions, hyenas, pumas, leopards, jaguars, bobcats, and tigers. Currently, FIV has been documented in over nineteen wild felid species due to its transmission through blood and saliva, which often occurs during aggressive interactions.

==== Transmission and Susceptibility ====
FIV is more rampant in non-&quot;Panthera&quot; lineages, such as lynxes, bobcats, cheetahs, and pumas, compared to &quot;Panthera&quot; species like lions, leopards, jaguars, and tigers. Studies indicate that lynxes are more susceptible to FIV due to higher levels of the A3Z3 protein, part of the APOBEC3 family, which limits virus replication in felids. However, A3Z3 mutations do not significantly alter viral genes, suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors may influence the virus&#x27;s effects.

Members of the &quot;Panthera&quot; genus exhibit higher levels of protective protein expression, potentially mitigating the severity of infection. Additionally, carnivorous diets contribute to FIV transmission, as larger wild felids may contract the virus by consuming smaller, infected prey species, increasing the rates of infection.

==== Rise in morbidity ====
Lions infected with FIV show various outcomes. Many live without advanced symptoms, while severe cases are rarely observed in the wild due to rapid mortality or predation. Genetic diversity among FIV strains may influence pathogenicity, similar to how HIV affects humans. Infected lions exhibit reduced T-cell counts, inflammation, and systemic complications, but the disease&#x27;s progression often occurs beyond reproductive age, limiting its population-level effects.

FIV infections compromise immune function, leading to increased susceptibility to secondary infections and diseases. Behavioral changes have been observed in infected felids, such as reduced hunting ability and impaired social interactions, may hinder survival. These behavioral and physiological effects highlight the multifaceted challenges posed by FIV, influenced by genetics, ecological dynamics, and interspecies interactions.

==== Conservation and Species Survival Implications ====
FIV presents a significant but nuanced challenge for wild felids. While it has been connected to immunological complications, current evidence and studies have not conclusively proven that FIV has a significant increase of mortality rates across populations. However, its effects on individual fitness and survival, driven by genetic susceptibility, ecological interactions, and strain diversity, are undeniable.

A study conducted in Colorado on native puma populations found no definitive correlation between human hunting and the spread of FIV. Despite this, understanding the complex dynamics of FIV is crucial for effective conservation strategies. The interplay of genetic diversity, environmental factors, and interspecies interactions shapes health outcomes and informs efforts to ensure the survival of affected species

=== Domestic felids ===
In domestic cats, FIV-Fca is pathogenic and can lead to feline AIDS symptoms and subsequent death. Phylogenetic analysis shows FIV to be a monophyletic branch that diverges into three subtypes A, B, and C. Domestic cats arose more recently than other felidae species approximately around 10,000 years ago from a subspecies of wildcat &quot;Felis silvestris&quot; which inhabited East Asia. Genetic analysis indicates lower genetic diversity of FIV in the domestic cat compared to wild Felidae species, higher evolutionary rates, and higher mortality rates when compared to FIV-Ple and FIV-Pco. This suggests the emergence of FIV in domestic cats was recent since newly emerged viruses tend to have higher evolutionary rates with little to no co-adaption between virus and new host species occurring. Additionally, seroprevalence studies show companion cats to have a 4–12% occurrence while feral cats have an 8–19% prevalence which is much lower compared to wild felidae species which supports the hypothesis of FIV&#x27;s recent emergence in this species.

==Comparison with feline leukemia virus==
FIV and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are sometimes mistaken for one another though the viruses differ in many ways. Although they are both in the same retroviral subfamily (orthoretrovirinae), they are classified in different genera (FeLV is a gamma-retrovirus and FIV is a lentivirus like HIV-1). Their shapes are quite different: FeLV is more circular while FIV is elongated. The two viruses are also quite different genetically, and their protein coats differ in size and composition. Although many of the diseases caused by FeLV and FIV are similar, the specific ways in which they are caused actually differ. Also, while the feline leukemia virus may cause symptomatic illness in an infected cat, an FIV-infected cat can remain completely asymptomatic its entire lifetime.

<doc id="670709" wikidata="Q6550111" url="?curid=670709" title="Martin Taylor (guitarist)">
<text>Martin Taylor, MBE (born 20 October 1956) is a British jazz guitarist who has performed solo, in groups, guitar ensembles, and as an accompanist.

==Early life==
Taylor was born in Harlow, Essex, into a family with a musical heritage and a Gypsy tradition. At the age of four, he received his first guitar from his father, jazz bassist William &#x27;Buck&#x27; Taylor who only took up music at 30. Buck frequently played the music of the Quintette du Hot Club de France, so the young Martin Taylor became inspired by guitarist Django Reinhardt. At age eight, he was already playing in his father&#x27;s band and at 15 he quit school to become a professional musician. 

The band Martin joined at 15 called the &quot;Oo-yah Band&quot; was led by Lennie Hastings, a jazz drummer who had been in the Alex Welsh band. The band included Nick Stevenson (trumpet), Peter Skivington (bass guitar), Ron Brown (trombone), Jamie Evans (piano), Malcolm Everson (clarinet and baritone saxophone).

Over the next few years Taylor played in bands at holiday camps, on radio, and on cruise ships. One cruise gig led to his playing with the Count Basie orchestra. Performing dates in and around London brought him into contact with jazz guitarist Ike Isaacs, who became a mentor. Isaacs not only performed with Taylor as a duet, but also helped Taylor develop his sense of jazz harmony and fingerstyle technique. He recorded for the first time in 1978, with bassist Peter Ind.

==The Grappelli years==
Through Isaacs, Taylor was introduced to Stéphane Grappelli, former violinist of the Quintette du Hot Club de France, in which he played with Django Reinhardt. When one of Grappelli&#x27;s band members was injured, Taylor was invited to play a few European dates. When Grappelli invited him to join full-time, Taylor accepted and performed and recorded with him for the next eleven years (1979–1990), occupying the position once held by his idol, Django Reinhardt.

His success with Grappelli allowed Taylor more freedom. He reduced some of his commitments and moved to Scotland. Another benefit of his association with Grappelli was that he began to tour North America regularly, helping him reach a larger audience and build new relationships. He has worked with Chet Atkins, Joe Pass, Tal Farlow, Barney Kessel, and Herb Ellis.

==Going solo==
To avoid relying on other musicians for income, Taylor started to perform as a solo act. His style and engaging stage personality paid off, and the gigs proved successful. After a few years, he stopped touring with Grappelli. A recording contract with Scottish label Linn Records, helped make it possible for him to concentrate on his solo career. Linn was primarily a manufacturer of high-end audio equipment, and found that Taylor&#x27;s intimate and intricate style and tone ably demonstrated the quality of their equipment. These Linn recordings include solo work (&quot;Artistry and Portraits&quot;, which featured Chet Atkins) and some recordings with a modern jazz quartet (&quot;Don&#x27;t Fret&quot;). The relative success of these albums and his concert dates raised Taylor&#x27;s profile in the guitar community.

In 1991, Taylor performed in Australia, giving a solo performance on the &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; show. Guitarist Tommy Emmanuel saw him on the show and contacted him, and the two became friends and frequent collaborators. Taylor has stated that although their backgrounds were different, they shared many similarities and found that they had been living parallel lives on opposite sides of the world.

==Spirit of Django==
In 1994, Taylor started the band Spirit of Django, which was inspired by Django Reinhardt and the Hot Club. He recorded and toured with this band while continuing his solo commitments. At the end of the decade he signed with Sony Music, releasing two albums, &quot;Kiss and Tell&quot; and &quot;Nitelife&quot;. After leaving Sony, he signed with P3 Music, which released &quot;Solo&quot; and &quot;The Valley&quot; with guest appearances by Bryn Terfel and Sacha Distel.

At a celebration for the film &quot;Stéphane Grappelli: A Life in the Jazz Century&quot;, Taylor performed with associates of Grappelli, including John Etheridge, Jack Emblow, and Coleridge Goode. Since 2010, he has been teaching guitar on his online school.

==Influences==
His earliest influence was gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt from the Hot Club of France. Other influences include mentor Ike Isaacs, Ted Greene, Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, and Joe Pass. Although Taylor is inspired by many guitarists, musically he relates more to pianists, particularly Art Tatum.

Taylor&#x27;s set lists include songs from the Great American Songbook and his own compositions. His arrangements and compositions are often influenced by composers like Nelson Riddle and Duke Ellington and therefore include moving lines to fill in the spaces, e.g. walking basslines, syncopated chordal &#x27;stabs&#x27; (to emulate horn sections), and complex jazz harmony. He considers melody the most important part of an arrangement.

==Equipment==

Martin Taylor often uses guitars built by Scottish-based luthier Mike Vanden. They produced the Martin Taylor Artistry archtop with another, nylon-stringed, archtop used for &quot;Spirit of Django&quot;. Throughout the 1990s he played a Yamaha AEX1500, which he helped develop. In 2012, Peerless guitars announced the release of two guitars endorsed by Martin. In 2018, in collaboration with UK based premium hand-crafted guitar specialist, Fibonacci Guitars , the Martin Taylor branded &quot;Joya&quot; guitar was launched followed in 2022 by the slightly smaller and thinner &quot;Lola&quot; model

<doc id="670711" wikidata="Q6225529" url="?curid=670711" title="John Cator">
<text>John Cator (21 March 1728 – 26 February 1806) was an English timber merchant and politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1772 and 1793. He became a landowner and property developer with estates in later life in: Blackheath, Beckenham, Addington, Croydon and Waltham Forest – now in London, then in Kent, Surrey and Essex; at Leigh and Hever in Kent.
==Business==
The son of John Cator the Elder, a Herefordshire timber merchant and Quaker (who in turn was the son of Jonah Cator of Ross-on-Wye, a glovemaker), Cator joined the family business which had relocated to a new London base at Mould Strand Wharf (now the Bankside site of the Tate Modern art gallery) in Southwark, and sought to capitalise on the growth of the capital by investing in property, mainly in south-east London and Kent. He married Mary Collinson (daughter of botanist Peter Collinson) in 1753. In 1778, Fanny Burney wrote:

:&quot;Mr. C--, who was formerly a timber-merchant, but having amassed a fortune of one million of pounds, he has left off business. He is a good-natured busy sort of man.&quot;

At one time Cator negotiated lending money to the Prince Regent and his brothers but withdrew in case it was seen by lawyers as treasonable as repayment details turned on the death of the ailing King.

He was MP for Wallingford from 1772 to 1780. Following his election for Ipswich in 1784, his rival Charles Crickitt took out a successful petition against him accusing him of bribery. He was then elected for Stockbridge from 1790 to 1793. He was appointed High Sheriff of Kent for 1780–81.

==Beckenham==
Cator&#x27;s first land purchase in Beckenham/Lewisham was at Stump&#x27;s Hill in 1757, where he built a house between 1760 and 1762 on part of what was Foxgrove Manor lands. His father-in-law visited in September 1762, commenting:

:&quot;... went, for the first time, to visit my son-in-law John Cater &quot;[sic]&quot; (who married my daughter), at his new-built house, now finished, at Stump&#x27;s Hill, half-way (on the south side of the road) between Southend and Beckenham, in Kent, began in the spring 1760, on a pretty wooded estate that he had purchased. The plantations about it, all of his own doing, I found in a thriving condition, and when grown up will adorn so stately a house, in so delectable a situation, and make it a Paradise.&quot;

In 1773, he became Lord of the Manor of Beckenham, having purchased the land from Lord Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke had previously exchanged the old manor house for Woolseys Farm with the Burrells. Cator was established at Stumps Hill and whether the house of 1760 was altered is unknown but it was eventually altered to a more Palladian-style mansion with the epithet &#x27;Beckenham Place&#x27;, Beckenham Place (attribution unknown, but may be architect Sir Robert Taylor), much admired by Dr Samuel Johnson. The purchase from Bolingbroke was fraught with problems as Bolingbroke had previously leased the manor lands to a Mrs. Hare and court cases went on until 1780. After Cator acquired full control of the Beckenham Manor lands he exchanged property with the Burrells of Kelsey and Langley so that he had a contiguous estate north of Beckenham village and the Burrells under Peter Burrell/Lord Gwydyr had most of the land south of the village after 1793. Cator&#x27;s land dealings, money lending and business affairs will perhaps never be fully understood. He was a shareholder in the East India Company and some of his brothers worked for the Company.

Cator Park and Cator Road are named after John Cator.

==Blackheath==
Around 1783, slightly closer to central London at Blackheath, Cator bought the Wricklemarsh mansion (formerly owned by Sir Gregory Page) and its 250-acre (1 km2) estate for a bargain £22,250. The Palladian mansion (designed by architect John James) was gradually demolished from 1787 onwards and Cator began to break up the estate into small packages of land to be individually developed. Among the earliest commissions was one for architect Michael Searles to design a 14-house crescent, &quot;The Paragon&quot;, on the south side of the Heath. Some of its colonnades are said to incorporate pillars used in Page&#x27;s mansion.

==The Cator estates==

Cator died in London in 1806 at his Adelphi apartment and was buried in the churchyard of St George&#x27;s Church, Beckenham. At the time of his death he had property in Beckenham, Croydon, Addington, Leigh, Chiddingstone, Waltham Forest, Chingford and a small amount in Hereford which had been his father&#x27;s. His only child a daughter Maria had died in infancy so he had no direct heir.
His estates were inherited by his nephew John Barwell Cator (1791–1850), who &quot;with a young man&#x27;s flair, exploited the Blackheath estate with style and profit,&quot; though it was not until the mid 1820s that building started in earnest. J. Barwell Cator had purchased estates in Woodbastwick in Norfolk (Woodbastwick Hall is still the family seat), and it later fell to other Cators – his younger brother Peter Cator (1796-1873) and son Albemarle Cator (1813-1868) – to expand the developments of Beckenham and Blackheath to take advantage of the growth of the railway network during the mid 19th century. John Cator had intended the Beckenham Estates to remain intact for the family but a private act of Parliament, the (6 Geo. 4. c. &quot;38&quot; ), permitted J. Barwell Cator and other trustees of the estate to sell or lease property with the intention of replacing sales with other purchases so Woodbastwick expanded, and the family under Albemarle Cator also acquired property in Trewsbury in Gloucestershire.

The upmarket Blackheath Park neighbourhood south-east of the heath itself bears alternate name &quot;the Cator Estate&quot;.

John Barwell Cator&#x27;s descendant, Elizabeth Cator (died 1959) was the mother of Fergus Bowes-Lyon, 17th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne.

<text>Richard Roma is a fictional character from David Mamet&#x27;s 1983 play &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot; and its 1992 film adaptation. Roma has been portrayed by a range of actors, including Joe Mantegna, Al Pacino and Liev Schreiber, although the role was originated by Jack Shepherd.

Actors portraying Roma have won and been nominated for multiple stage awards—both Mantegna and Schreiber received a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play for their performances, while Shepherd earned a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor. In film, Pacino received nominations for both the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture.

==Conceptual history==
Roma, along with the rest of the salesmen in &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;, was written based on playwright David Mamet&#x27;s previous experiences selling &quot;worthless&quot; Arizona real estate from an office in Chicago. Mamet described the colorful dialogue used by the character—which has also been described as &quot;following in the steps of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;—as having been influenced by overheard conversations and street slang.

==Plot==

Richard Roma is a cutthroat and successful real estate salesman who derives his success from eloquent and convincing pitches, preying on insecure clients with illusions of power and machismo. During the events of &quot;Glengarry Glen Ross&quot;, Roma is in contention for a prize to be awarded to the top &quot;closer&quot; at his firm, having just closed a large sale to a man called Lingk. Overnight, the firm&#x27;s office is burgled, and promising real estate leads are stolen. Lingk arrives at the office during the investigation, forced by his wife to cancel his land purchase during his cooling-off period. Roma attempts to distract Lingk from doing so in the hope that this period will pass, trapping Lingk in the sale, but well-intentioned comments by the firm&#x27;s manager, John Williamson, trying to play along, catch Roma in a lie, and Lingk demands a refund on his purchase. Furious, Roma berates Williamson in front of the entire office, and storms out, threatening to quit.

==Reception==

===Character===

Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Mickey Rapkin considered Roma to be the central character of the play, describing him as &quot;the salesman’s salesman, a shark in a sharkskin suit&quot;. Mantegna has stated that he feels Roma is not a &quot;sleazy&quot; character, but simply a man who can convince customers to follow through on their dreams. Reviewing a 2012 revival at the La Jolla Playhouse, Charles McNulty of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; compared Roma to a Giacomo Casanova-type figure, adding that &quot;when Roma puts the moves on a prospective buyer, it&#x27;s as though he&#x27;s making love to them&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; Mark Lawson wrote that Roma is an amoral character, considering him a &quot;super-schmoozer&quot;. In the same article, Aidan Gillen, then portraying the character in the Apollo Theatre in London, described him as a &quot;cunt with a romantic, poetic streak&quot;.

===Depictions===

Portrayals of Roma have often been received positively by critics. Schreiber&#x27;s portrayal in the 2005 Broadway revival was praised as that of &quot;a most crafty spider indeed&quot;, with the actor&#x27;s grasp of the character&#x27;s Chicago accent praised for its subtlety. Gillen&#x27;s 2007 turn as Roma has been described as &quot;sweaty and aggressive with a hard, rodent-like quality&quot;, with reviewer Lyn Gardner of &quot;The Guardian&quot; finding the performance excellent. Manu Narayan&#x27;s 2012 depiction was described as &quot;adding velocity&quot; to a &quot;high testosterone&quot; production, coming across as rhythmic and an effective focal point in the piece. Reviewing the 1992 film version, Roger Ebert praised Pacino&#x27;s acting, writing &quot;any kid can play a war hero. But it takes a real man to play a busted-down real estate salesman&quot;.

===Accolades===

Shepherd&#x27;s original performance as Roma earned the actor a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in 1983. On Broadway, both Mantegna and Schreiber have won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play while portraying Roma—Mantegna at the 38th Tony Awards in 1984, and Schreiber at the 59th Tony Awards in 2005. Pacino&#x27;s role in the film adaptation earned him several award nominations, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor and the Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture, both times losing out to Gene Hackman in &quot;Unforgiven&quot;.

<text>Sonoma Raceway (originally known as Sears Point Raceway, Golden State International Raceway and [[Infineon Technologies|Infineon]] Raceway) is a road course and dragstrip located at Sears Point in the southern Sonoma Mountains of Sonoma County, California. The road course features 12 turns on a hilly course with of total elevation change. It is host to one of the few NASCAR Cup Series races each year that are run on road courses. It has also played host to the IndyCar Series, the NHRA Mission Foods Drag Racing Series, and several other auto races and motorcycle races such as the American Federation of Motorcyclists series. Sonoma Raceway continues to host amateur, or club racing events with some open to the public. The largest such car club is the Sports Car Club of America. The track is north of San Francisco and Oakland.

With the closure of Riverside International Raceway in Moreno Valley, California after the 1988 season, NASCAR wanted a West Coast road course event to replace it, and chose the Sears Point facility. Riverside Raceway was razed for the Moreno Valley Mall.

In 2002, Sears Point Raceway was renamed after a corporate sponsor, Infineon Technologies. On March 7, 2012, it was announced that Infineon would not renew their contract for naming rights when the deal expired in May 2012.

==History==
===1968–1979===
The road racing course was constructed on by Marin County owners Robert Marshall Jr., an attorney from Point Reyes, and land developer Jim Coleman of Kentfield. The two conceived of the idea of a race track while on a hunting trip. Ground was broken in August 1968 and paving of the race surface was completed in November. The first official event at Sears Point was an SCCA Enduro, held on December 1, 1968.

In 1969 the track was sold to Filmways Corp., a Los Angeles-based entertainment company for $4.5 million. In May 1970 the track was closed and became a tax shelter for Filmways after losses of $300,000 were reported. Hugh Harn of Belvedere and Parker Archer of Napa arranged to lease the track from Filmways in 1973. Bob Bondurant, owner and operator of the Bob Bondurant School of High Performance Driving, and partner Bill Benck took over management and control of the leased raceway from Parker Archer and Hugh Harn in 1974. A few years later a group calling itself Black Mountain Inc., which included Bondurant, William J. Kolb of Del Mar and Howard Meister of Newport Beach, purchased the track from Filmways for a reported $1.5 million.

American Motorcycle Association national motocross races in the hills north of Turn 7 became popular with Bay Area fans, but were phased out by the end of the decade because of rising insurance costs.

===1980–2000===
In 1981 Filmways regained ownership of the track after a financial dispute with Black Mountain group. Jack Williams, the 1964 NHRA top-fuel drag racing champion, Rick Betts and John Andersen purchased the track from Filmways at an auction for $800,000. The track was renamed Sears Point International Raceway. In 1985 the track was completely repaved, in part with funds donated from the &quot;Pave the Point&quot; fund raising campaign. The first shop spaces (buildings A, B, C, and D in the main paddock area) were built.

In 1986 Harvey &quot;Skip&quot; Berg of Tiburon, CA took control of the track and became a major stockholder in Brenda Raceway Corp., which controlled the track until 1996. Additional buildings constructed on the property brought shop space to more than during 1987. In addition, a five-year contract was signed with the National Hot Rod Association for the California Nationals. The NASCAR Winston Cup Series debuted at the raceway in 1989.

In 1994 more than $1 million was spent on a beautification project and construction of a -high, four-sided electronic lap leader board in the center of the road course. In the following years a major $3 million renovation plan included VIP suites and a two-story driver&#x27;s lounge/emergency medical facility. In 1995 Trans-Am and SportsCar races returned to Sears Point and the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series was added to the major-events schedule. Owner &quot;Skip&quot; Berg sold the track to O. Bruton Smith, chairman of Speedway Motorsports, Inc. in November 1996.
Major renovations began at Sears Point Raceway in 1998 with the creation of &quot;the Chute&quot;, an high-speed stretch. The first-ever running of the American Le Mans Series took place at Sears Point in July 1999. In 2000 Sears Point Raceway gained unanimous approval from the Sonoma County Board of Supervisors by a 5–0 vote to begin work on a $35 million Modernization Plan that included 64,000 Hillside Terrace seats, repaving of both the road course and drag strip and increased run-off around the entire track.

===Since 2000===
After the turn of the millennium, Infineon Technologies bought the naming rights, and on June 22, 2002, the course was renamed Infineon Raceway. In 2006, the Grand Prix of Sonoma was transferred to the Rolex Sports Car Series, who would limit it to Daytona Prototypes only for 2007–2008 before the event was discontinued altogether. Since 2010, however, the course has seen a mild resurgence, with the circuit becoming a sponsor for various events as well as hosting an increasing amount of lesser series, including the WTCC and the return of the SCCA World Challenge. The year 2012 saw the end of Infineon as the corporate sponsor, with the track being renamed Sonoma Raceway.

==Layouts==

===Full circuit===

The standard, full length road course at Sonoma Raceway is a 12-turn course. This course was utilized by all competition through 1997. Most races, including the Grand Prix of Sonoma, use the full course. The course is noted for turns two and three, which are negative-camber (&quot;off-camber&quot;) turns, with the inside of the turn higher than the outside. This provides a challenge for the driver, as turn two would normally have the drivers moving to the left side of the track.

The raceway also has a dragstrip used for NHRA drag racing events. The drag strip was originally located on part of the front straightaway of the course. Track changes completed in 2002 separated the road course from the drag strip.

The Sonoma Historic Motorsports Festival, an annual classic car racing event, uses the full circuit.

NASCAR returned to using the full circuit in 2019 as a part of the tracks 50th anniversary. The full circuit was used in 2019 &amp; 2021 (event was cancelled in 2020 due to the pandemic), but in 2022 they will return to the modified layout instead of running the original.

The track was closed in 2020 because of government regulations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. All national events were removed from the schedule.

===The Chute===
The track was modified in 1998, adding &quot;the Chute&quot;, which bypassed turns 5 and 6 (the Carousel), shortening the course to . The Chute was only used for NASCAR events such as the Toyota/Save Mart 350, and was criticized by many drivers, who prefer the full layout. In 2001, it was replaced with the 70° turn, 4A bringing the track to its current dimensions of .

The Chute was built primarily for spectator visibility, to increase speeds, and improve competition for the stock cars, which are not necessarily groomed well for road course racing. However, it has been criticized for taking away a primary passing point, and some INDYCAR drivers believe eliminating the Chute and replacing it with a new hairpin at Turn 4A, then rejoining the track at Turn 5, would create a circuit with three passing zones (Turn 4, Turn 7, and Turn 11). Furthermore, the speeds of the current layout with the Chute have been slower than if the full configuration was used.

The layout is now used as a Club circuit with options, as at the end of 2018 season, NASCAR returned to the full circuit in 2019. In 2022, NASCAR returned to the Chute layout.

===Gilligan&#x27;s Island===
From 1989 to 2001, the pit road could only accommodate 34 pit stalls. So, during the Toyota/Save Mart 350 Cup Series race, some teams were required to share pit stalls while other teams were forced to pit inside the garage area. When cars dropped out of the race, their pit stalls were reassigned to cars who were sharing.

Before the 1994 NASCAR race, a makeshift auxiliary pit road was constructed inside the hairpin (turn 11) nicknamed &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. Cars that had the nine slowest qualifying speeds were relegated to these pit stalls. Pitting in this area was considered an inconvenience and a competitive disadvantage, more so than even the disadvantages one would experience pitting on the backstretch at a short track at the time.

Since the length of the auxiliary pit road was significantly shorter than the main pit road, the cars that pitted there were held from 15 to 20 seconds to make up for the time that would have been spent if the cars had traveled the entire main pit road.

Pitting on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; had several other inconveniences. The location (the staging area for drag races) was landlocked by the race course, and crew members were unable to leave once the race began. Teams sent only the primary pit crew to &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, and once they were there, they could not access the garage area or their transporters to collect spare parts/tools. The only repairs that could be made were routine tire changes and refueling, as well as only minor repairs. Other auxiliary pit crew members, who were not part of the main crew, were staged in the garage area, and would have to service the car if it required major repairs. If a team pitting on &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot; dropped out of the race, the crew was unable to pack up their supplies and prepare to leave (a common practice at other tracks) until the race was over.

Before the 2002 NASCAR track renovations were completed which extended the main pit road, up to the start-finish straight, which removed the need for Gilligan&#x27;s Island and it has not reappeared in any NASCAR race at the track since.

===Modified course===
Variations of Sonoma&#x27;s circuits are often used. Motorcycles use a , 12-turn course. It is based on the full layout, and does not include the Chute. This layout, opened in 2003, skips the later section of the Esses (8A and 9) and the run from Turn 10 to Turn 11 (the hairpin), using instead Turn 11a as Turn 11 has no runoff. This hairpin is located just past the drag strip control tower and offers a fairly straight run to the start-finish line. It was used by INDYCAR from 2006 to 2011.

Another factor in removing the hairpin is the fact that the turn is only visible from the garages or the bleachers behind the esses. This is due to grandstands built along the front straight that serve also as the drag strip&#x27;s grandstands.

The official FIA Grade 2 variant, the Grand Prix layout, was used by INDYCAR from 2012 to 2018 and others. This version uses the end of the dragstrip (instead of the Keyhole) to create a Magny Cours-style hairpin that joints the drag strip to Turn 7 to open an overtaking opportunity. The circuit also modified Turn 9A (the chicane similar to Spa&#x27;s new Bus Stop) by widening it by to allow for more room. A new Turn 11B has been made, moving further past the drag strip tower (Motorcycle Turn 11), being lengthened by to create a passing zone (it is located just before the race logos painted in Turn 11), and is located where the drag strip staging area is located.

During the World Touring Car races, the course used most of the Grand Prix layout except for the full Turn 11 hairpin.

==All-time lap records==
NOTE: NASCAR records based on full course.

===NASCAR Cup Series records===


==Race lap records==

The fastest official all-time track record set during a race weekend on the original Long Grand Prix Road Course is 1:20.683, set by Allan McNish in an Audi R8 during qualifying for the 2000 Grand Prix of Sonoma. As of August 2024, the fastest official race lap records at Sonoma Raceway for different classes are listed as:

==Seating capacity==

Sonoma Raceway has a permanent seating capacity of 47,000. This includes the grandstands and terraces around the track. During major races, hospitality tents and other stages are erected around the track, which brings the total capacity up to 102,000 seats. The facility underwent a major expansion in 2004 which resulted in 64,000 hillside seats, 10,000 permanent grandstand seats, a wastewater treatment facility, of restored wetlands, permanent garages, new retail space, a go-kart track and a new drag strip.

===Trans-Am Series===

==In popular culture==
In the 1970 motorcycle road racing film &quot;Little Fauss and Big Halsy&quot;, starring Michael J. Pollard and Robert Redford, Redford&#x27;s character, Halsy, saw Sears Point as the brass ring in the world of racing, and the film was loosely based around that idea.

Sonoma has been featured in many racing video games, beginning with Papyrus&#x27;s &quot;NASCAR Racing&quot; for the PC, released in 1994 and has been a frequent addition to NASCAR based games and more recently road course variations have appeared. Bill Elliott&#x27;s NASCAR Challenge included the course released in 1991. It appeared in &quot;Gran Turismo 4, and Need For Speed ProStreet&quot; as Infineon Raceway, and more recently in &quot;Project CARS 2&quot; and recent &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; titles. It has also been digitally scanned and used in iRacing.

Scenes from a Toyota/Save Mart 350 NASCAR race were used in the softcore porn series &quot;Hotel Erotica&quot; in Season 1 Episode 3 &quot;The Fast and the Curious&quot;

<text>Timothy John Crow, (7 June 1938 – 10 November 2024) was a British psychiatrist and researcher. Much of his research was related to finding the causes of schizophrenia. He also had an interest in neurology and evolutionary theory. He was the Honorary Director of the Prince of Wales International Centre for Research into Schizophrenia and Depression. He qualified at the Royal London Hospital in 1964 and obtained a PhD at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland in 1970. He was a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Academy of Medical Sciences. Crow was, for twenty years, Head of the Division of Psychiatry of the Medical Research Council (MRC) Clinical Research Centre at Northwick Park Hospital and then a member of the External Scientific Staff of the MRC in Oxford.

== Research ==
=== Neurobiology of reinforcement and motivation ===

Crow worked in the Department of Physiology at the University of Aberdeen in the late 1960s and early 1970s, where he conducted pharmacological and behavioural studies of reinforcement and self-stimulation in rats for his Medical Research Council funded PhD: &quot;Experiments on the central actions of the amphetamines with particular reference to the functions of catecholamine-containing neurones&quot;. He published a number of papers dissecting the role of the various catecholamines in reinforcement and motivation, and in 1973 was the first person to publish an article arguing for a key role for the neurotransmitter dopamine in &#x27;incentive motivation&#x27;. Crow&#x27;s role as the first scientist to link dopamine to incentive motivation has been acknowledged by Berridge and by Robbins and Everitt.

=== Psychosis and schizophrenia ===
In 1978 Crow, in conjunction with his colleague Eve Johnstone and others, showed that the anti-psychotic drug, flupentixol, reduced the severity of schizophrenic delusions specifically because of its action on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Johnstone, Crow and colleagues were also the first to demonstrate, by randomised double-blind clinical trials, that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could reduce the symptoms of endogenous depression, albeit over a short time period. This finding has been substantially replicated in many other settings.

Crow&#x27;s long term research interests were in the nature and causation of the major psychoses. These illnesses are characterised by the presence of delusions, hallucinations, and disorders of thinking that generally start in early and middle adult life. Encompassing schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis, these disorders are common, being diagnosed in around 2% of the population in the course of a lifetime, but with wide cultural variation.

In the first CT scan study in 1976 Crow and colleagues at Northwick Park Hospital demonstrated that there are, across groups, structural differences in the brain (e.g. a degree of enlargement of the cerebral ventricles) in individuals who have suffered from schizophrenia compared to healthy people. Much subsequent work with MRI scans and in post-mortem brain studies has confirmed this, suggesting that the differences are in the cerebral cortex and are particularly related to the subtle asymmetries that are characteristic of the human cortex. Crow also demonstrated that people with schizophrenia show less left-sided cerebral dominance for some components of language.

In the 1980s, Crow published an article, focusing on the classification of the symptoms of the disease rather than focusing on the cluster of symptoms in individual patients, that became a breakthrough in the field of research on schizophrenia. He also introduced the idea of two syndromes of schizophrenia one based on positive symptoms and the other on negative symptoms, which contributed to an understanding of the cognitive nature of schizophrenia.

In 1989, Crow was awarded the Lieber Prize for Outstanding Achievement In Schizophrenia Research. In a retrospective review of 20 years of evidence of neurodevelopmental abnormalities in the brains of people with schizophrenia, Sir Robin Murray described the work of Johnstone and Crow on ventricular enlargement and negative symptoms in psychosis as being widely regarded by British psychiatrists as ‘marking the beginning of modern schizophrenia research’.

=== Psychosis and Human Evolution ===
Based on the supposition that language and psychosis are specifically human conditions, Crow spent his later career investigating the implications for schizophrenia of the occurrence of cerebral asymmetry in humans but not chimpanzees. Further work on handedness, heritability of psychosis, sex differences in age of onset in schizophrenia, and genes on the sex chromosomes in schizophrenia contributed to a large, but as yet unresolved, body of work on the contribution of the sex chromosomes, to brain development and function, including propensity to schizophrenia.

== Death ==
Crow died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease on 10 November 2024, at the age of 86.

<text>spl (short for set priority level, after the PDP-11 assembler instruction of the same name) is the name for a collection of Unix kernel routines or macros used to change the interrupt priority level. This was historically needed to synchronize critical sections of kernel code that should not be interrupted. Newer Unix variants which support symmetric multiprocessing now mostly use mutexes for this purpose, which is a more general solution, so multiple processors can execute kernel code at the same time.

On older PDP-11 versions of Unix, there were eight of these routines, ranging from codice_1 to codice_2, each corresponding to one PDP-11 interrupt priority level, in addition to codice_3, which restores a previous priority level (returned by one of the other routines). On BSD Unix and its derivatives, these are called codice_4, codice_5, codice_6, codice_7, codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, codice_11, codice_12, codice_13, codice_14, codice_15, codice_16, codice_1, and codice_3.

, the spl family of primitives is still heavily used in OpenBSD and NetBSD, which is evidenced by the plentiful calls to codice_19 within the networking code; whereas FreeBSD and DragonFly BSD use more modern concepts; for example, in DragonFly, LWKT tokens may be used in place of spl.

<text>The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN; , ) is a public research university with five campuses in the province of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. It was formed on 1 January 2004 after the merger between the University of Natal and the University of Durban-Westville.

==History==
The university was formed by the merger of the University of Natal and the University of Durban-Westville, in 2004.

The Council of the University of Natal voted on 31 May 2002 to offer the post of Vice-Chancellor and University Principal to world-renowned medical scientist and former Medical Research Council President – Professor Malegapuru Makgoba, who assumed office on 1 September 2002. He was entrusted with leading the University of Natal into the merger with the University of Durban-Westville. In so doing, he became the last Vice-Chancellor of the University of Natal. Professor Makgoba succeeded Professor Brenda Gourley as Vice-Chancellor.

Having served a brief stint as the interim Vice-Chancellor in 2004 he was formally appointed as the founding Vice-Chancellor of the newly merged University of KwaZulu-Natal. He was installed at a ceremony on 30 September 2005.

Professor Makgoba served two five-year terms of office and retired in 2015. His tenure, however, was plagued with controversies. Makgoba is said to have created a &quot;culture of hostility&quot; at the university that resulted in an exodus of world-class academics. He was succeeded by Dr Albert van Jaarsveld.

===University of Natal===
===University of Durban-Westville===

==Organisation==
The university is governed in accordance with the Higher Education Act of 1997, and its constitution is specified in the Statute of the University of KwaZulu-Natal, as approved by the South African Minister of Education and the Parliament of South Africa.

In the statute, the university consists of:
* the chancellor (the titular head). The first chancellor of the merged university was Dr Frene Ginwala. It is currently Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng.
* the vice chancellor (the executive head)
* two or more deputy vice chancellors (currently there are five full and one acting)
* the registrar (responsible for registering students)
* the council (responsible for governance of the institution as a whole)
* the senate (responsible for governance of academic activities)
* the students representative council (responsible for students representation)
* the institutional forum (responsible for advising the council on matters of human rights and equality)
* the colleges (currently there are four)
* the academic and support staff
* the students
* the convocation (all the alumni and some others)

==Academic structure==
The university is made up of four colleges, which are in turn made up of several schools. In most cases, a subdivision is spread across one or more of the university&#x27;s campuses. For example, the Chemistry is in both the Pietermaritzburg and Westville campuses.

===College of Agriculture, Engineering and Science===
* School of Engineering(all)
* School of Agricultural, Earth and Environmental Sciences
* School of Chemistry and Physics
* School of Life Sciences
* School Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science

===College of Health Sciences===
* School of Clinical Medicine
* School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Sciences
* School of Health Sciences
* School of Nursing and Public Health

===College of Humanities===
* School of Religion, Philosophy and Classics
* School of Arts
* School of Social Sciences
* School of Applied Human Sciences
* School of Built Environment and Development Studies
* School of Education

===College of Law and Management Studies===
* Graduate School of Business and Leadership (Business Management Association in cooperation with Hampton College Durban)
* School of Accounting, Economics and Finance
* School of Law
* School of Management, IT and Governance

An institute built in cooperation with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute is the new KwaZulu-Natal Research Institute for Tuberculosis and HIV, opened in 2012. It is on the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine campus.

==Campuses==
The university is geographically divided into five distinct campuses, which partially correspond to its managerial and academic divisions. Two campuses (Edgewood and the Medical School) house specific academic divisions (education and medicine respectively), but the remainder of the university&#x27;s academic divisions span Howard College, Pietermaritzburg and Westville.

===Pietermaritzburg campus===

Pietermaritzburg campus was the main location of the University of Natal and its predecessor, the Natal University College, until the opening of the Howard College campus in Durban. This campus contains the university&#x27;s oldest structure, Old Main Building, built in 1912. Pietermaritzburg campus offers a broad range of academic degrees and is the only UKZN campus providing training in agriculture, theology and fine arts.

===Howard College campus===
Howard College campus was the Durban location of the University of Natal until the 2004 merger. It is located on the Berea Ridge. and is situated in a thriving environmental conservancy. The campus was opened in 1931, having been donated by Mr T. B. Davis, in honor of his son, Howard Davis, who died in the Battle of the Somme during the first world war. Howard College offers a wide range of degrees, with a large engineering department consisting of Electrical engineering and Chemical engineering. The College of Humanities and College of Law and Management are also positioned on this campus together with the Centre For Creative Arts (CCA) and the Elizabeth Sneddon Theatre which host annually the Durban International Film Festival (DIFF), Poetry Africa, Time of the Writer and the creative dance festival JOMBA! which is produced by the FlatFoot Dance company.

===Westville campus===

Westville campus is in an environmental conservancy in Westville, about 10 km west of Durban. It was formerly the site of the University of Durban-Westville before the 2004 merger. Westville offers a range of degrees, and will soon be the main home of the disciplines of commerce and management.

===Nelson Mandela medical school===
Nelson Mandela medical school campus, created in 1950, was originally a racially segregated part of the University of Natal reserved for non-white students.
 It was one of the few tertiary institutions legally allowed to provide education to black people under apartheid. It was granted Nelson Mandela&#x27;s name on its 50th anniversary in 2000. The medical school is the home of health sciences.

===Edgewood campus===
Edgewood campus is located in Pinetown, about 20 km west of Durban. The buildings originally formed the Edgewood College of Education, which was incorporated into the University of Natal in 2001. Edgewood is the main location of the university&#x27;s Faculty of Education, current Dean is Prof Thabo, youngest Dean in South Africa and P-rated NRF researcher.

==Student profile==

==Student life==
UKZN is home to various student organizations such as debating unions, film clubs, poetry societies, and sports teams.

The UKZN Rugby team - The UKZN Impi - features in the highly contested Varsity Cup national rugby competition, and the Howard College Debating Union competes in both the World Universities Debating Championships as well as the South African National Universities Debating Championships.

UKZN established the Centre for Creative Arts (CCA) in 1996. The CCA is a multi-disciplinary arts organisation based within the School of Arts at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. It coordinates several respected annual festivals, providing students with access to creative platforms and interesting opportunities aimed at developing their artistic talents. The four main festivals organized by the UKZN CCA are:

* Time of the Writer
The UKZN Time of the Writer festival invites international authors to take place in a variety of roundtable discussions, readings, seminars, book launches, and developmental programmes such as workshops, master classes and motivational talks. The festival has been running since 1998.

* Durban International Film Festival
First held in 1979, The Durban International Film Festival is one of the oldest and largest film festivals in southern Africa.

* JOMBA! Contemporary Dance Experience
* Poetry Africa
The UKZN Poetry Africa started in 1997, and features performances, readings, and book-launches from some poets

==Law clinics==
UKZN has two law clinics, one in Pietermaritzburg and one in Durban, that provide free legal assistance to those that are unable to afford it. Specializing in the areas of HIV and AIDS, Family Law, and social justice matters, the UKZN law clinics are considered to be among the leading law clinics in the country.
The law clinics also provide a practical training environment for final year law students, who are mentored by the clinic&#x27;s experienced practitioners. Both clinics also engage directly with the communities throughout the province through regular outreach initiatives, where the students and legal practitioners travel to various remote, impoverished communities with the intention of providing access to justice for those that are most vulnerable.

==Rankings and reputation==

UKZN was ranked fourth out of the universities in South Africa by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings and sixth by the QS World University Rankings in 2018. UKZN has historically had a very strong reputation in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, and is ranked first in the country for physical sciences and engineering, second for computer science, and third for mathematics. The university has also produced a number of prominent entrepreneurs and innovators. It was ranked first in Sub-Saharan Africa in Q4 2020 by the amount of venture capital funding raised by Unicorn startups founded by UKZN&#x27;s alumni.

Internationally, UKZN is ranked in the 401-500 bracket by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings, and in the 701-750 bracket by the QS World University Rankings 2018. As of March 2021, it was ranked in the 801-1000 bracket by the QS World University Rankings.
==Controversies==

There have been a number of controversies at the University of KwaZulu-Natal since its foundation.

Firstly, there have been several staff strikes and student protests, 
with some protests from 2009 onward involving police intervention and the use of riot control measures, as well as violence on the part of some strikers.

Secondly, there have been a series of legal and disciplinary actions taken by senior university management against academics for speaking in public about the university. These actions have drawn wide criticism from academics and from organisations such as Cosatu and UNESCO.

They were also the cause of a 2008 staff strike.

<text>Standesamt Adelnau was one of the civil registration districts located in Kreis Adelnau of the Prussian province of Posen, created in October 1874, during Imperial Germany (1871–1918) and administered the communities of:

== Historical Overview ==

=== 1. Administrative and Historical Context ===
The &quot;Standesamt&quot; (civil registry office) in Adelnau was part of the German system of civil registration established in the late 19th century. Adelnau was a town in the Prussian Province of Posen (now Odolanów, Poland). After the partitions of Poland, the region was under Prussian control and later became part of the German Empire in 1871.

Civil registry offices (&quot;Standesämter&quot;) were introduced in Prussia in 1874 to keep official records of births, marriages, and deaths. These records were essential for legal identity, inheritance, and citizenship matters.

=== 2. Function of Standesamt Adelnau ===
Like other civil registry offices in Prussia, &quot;Standesamt Adelnau&quot; was responsible for:

* Registering births, including parental details.
* Recording marriages and issuing marriage certificates.
* Documenting deaths and related legal matters.
* Maintaining accurate population records.

These records were vital for both local governance and broader administrative functions within the German Empire and later under Polish control after World War I.

=== 3. Historical Changes and Transition ===

* Pre-1918: Under German administration as part of the Province of Posen.
* 1919-1939: Following World War I and the Treaty of Versailles, Adelnau (now Odolanów) became part of Poland, and the civil registry system transitioned to Polish administration.
* 1939-1945: Under Nazi German occupation during World War II, the area temporarily reverted to German control, and &quot;Standesamt&quot; functions resumed under German law.
* Post-1945: After World War II, Adelnau officially remained in Poland, and the civil registry system became fully integrated into Polish administration.

=== 4. Legacy and Records ===
Many historical records from &quot;Standesamt Adelnau&quot; may be found in:

* Polish state archives (e.g., Archiwum Państwowe w Poznaniu).
* German archives (e.g., Bundesarchiv, Standesamt I in Berlin for displaced records).
* Genealogical databases such as FamilySearch and the Poznan Project.

These records are valuable for historical and genealogical research, particularly for individuals tracing ancestry in the former Province of Posen.</text><links>

<doc id="670747" wikidata="Q1463541" url="?curid=670747" title="Pony car">
<text>Pony car is an American car classification for affordable, compact, highly styled coupés or convertibles with a &quot;sporty&quot; or performance-oriented image. Common characteristics include rear-wheel drive, a long hood, a short deck, bucket seats, room for four, a wide range of options to individualize each car and use of mass-produced parts shared with other models. The popularity of pony cars is largely due to the launch of the Ford Mustang in 1964, which created the niche and term.

There is much debate among enthusiasts about the exact definition of a pony car, and what differentiates the vehicle from a muscle car. The general consensus is that pony cars are smaller and more homogeneous in their form than muscle cars. A few intermediate-size vehicles, such as the Dodge Challenger, may be considered to belong to both categories.

== History ==
=== 1960–1963: Predecessors ===
In the early 1960s, Ford, Plymouth, and AMC began noticing the rising interest in small, sporty cars, and the increasing importance of younger buyers. In order to convince the management of Ford to approve a small, sporty car for production, the Budd Company built a prototype two-seat roadster called the XT-Bird. The XT-Bird was built using the compact car chassis of the Ford Falcon with a modified 1957 Ford Thunderbird body. Ford rejected the proposal, preferring to design a four-seat sporty car instead which would expand its sales volume.

The Budd Company then approached American Motors Corporation (AMC) with the Budd XR-400 prototype, which was based on a 1962 AMC Ambassador two-door with a shortened chassis and the body moved rearward to allow for a longer hood (bonnet). The automaker&#x27;s &quot;management expressed interest in a new car with a sports flair&quot; and work on the AMC Rambler Tarpon, a 2+2 coupe with an elongated fastback roof, began in early 1963.

Examples of production cars that included sporty and youthful appeal include the 1960 Chevrolet Corvair. Initially positioned as an economy car, the Corvair&#x27;s plusher-trimmed and sportier Monza model sold around 144,000 units by 1961. The Corvair Monza&#x27;s bucket seats and floor-mounted transmission shifter started a trend toward these features being offered in cars ranging from compacts to full-size cars. Competing models inspired by the Corvair Monza included the Ford Falcon Futura and Futura Sprint models and the Rambler American 440-H and Rogue models. Most sporty compacts were powered by the same economical six-cylinder engines as their more mundane platform counterparts, but in some cases, optional V8 engines were available along with four-speed manual transmissions.

=== 1964–1966: Initial pony cars released ===
The first entry into what would become known as the “pony car” marketplace was the Plymouth Barracuda, which went on sale on April 1, 1964 (two weeks before the Ford Mustang). The Barracuda was released as a fastback coupe, based on the platform of the Plymouth Valiant compact car. Chrysler&#x27;s precarious financial situation meant that there was a limited development budget for the Barracuda, which led to a compromised design. The Barracuda was criticized for having insufficient distinction from the Valiant and the styling drew mixed reactions. As a result, Barracuda sales were a fraction of the Mustang&#x27;s.

At the Ford Motor Company, executive Lee Iacocca had commissioned studies that suggested a market for a unique-looking, affordable sporty car. This led to the development of a sporty 2+2 car based on the Ford Falcon platform, launched on April 17, 1964, as the 1965 Ford Mustang. Sporting a long hood and short deck, it was offered as a two-door coupé and convertible. In its base specification, the drivetrain was typical of an economy car: a six-cylinder engine with a three-speed manual transmission. The base price included bucket seats, carpeting, floor shifter, sport steering wheel, and full-wheel covers. However, desirable options such as V8 engines, a four-speed manual gearbox, air conditioning, and power steering could increase the price by up to 60%, which made such versions very profitable for Ford.

The Mustang was an enormous success, with first-year sales forecasts of 100,000 units being shattered on the first day, when Ford dealers took orders for 22,000 vehicles, forcing the company to immediately increase production. The extended model year sales totaled 618,812 Mustangs. The Mustang broke all post-World War II automobile sales records, &quot;creating the &#x27;pony car&#x27; craze soon adopted by competitors.&quot;

The 1965 Mustang provided the template for the new class of automobiles. The term &quot;pony car&quot; to describe members of its ranks was coined by &quot;Car Life&quot; magazine editor Dennis Shattuck. The characteristics of a pony car were generally defined as:
* A sporty compact car for the masses, that could carry four people
* Long hood, short deck profile, and &quot;open mouth&quot; styling
* Affordable base price (under – in 1965 dollar value)
* Wide range of options to individualize each car
* Manufactured using mass-produced parts shared with other models
* Youth-oriented marketing and advertising

While most pony cars were produced with economical six-cylinder or small V8 engines, more powerful V8 engines and performance packages consistent with the “sporty car” image were offered. The most extreme models saw limited sales and were largely limited to drag racing, road racing, or motorsport homologation purposes.

=== 1967–1970 Segment expands ===

Initially, General Motors believed that the restyled 1965 Chevrolet Corvair (a rear-engined compact car) would be an adequate challenger for the Mustang. However, once GM realized that the Corvair was doomed, the more conventional front-engine, Nova-based Chevrolet Camaro was introduced for the 1967 model year built on the new GM F-body platform. A few months later, the Camaro-based Pontiac Firebird was introduced.

The Mustang was redesigned for the 1967 model year and became the basis for the upscale Mercury Cougar on a longer wheelbase.

American Motors introduced its first pony car in 1967 with the 1968 model year Javelin. The car was described as a &quot;roomy, comfortable, peppy and handsome example of a so-called &quot;pony car&quot;, the type of automobile that&#x27;s showing up more and more on US highways.&quot;

In 1969 the 1970 model year Dodge Challenger joined the already crowded pony car segment. The Challenger was essentially an enlarged Barracuda.

The pony car market segment was maturing and all four domestic automakers were building versions of the long hood/short deck template that Ford had developed. The term pony car applied to all versions of these nameplates, from base models to the high-performance muscle car models, developed in league with factory supported racing to gain a marketing edge. The competition between the manufacturers was so fierce that the introduction and rollout of Trans-Am Series racing from 1966 to 1972 is described as a battle in &quot;The Pony Car Wars&quot;.

While sales were strong throughout the end of the 1960s, pony cars&#x27; greater value was in generating brand loyalty, particularly among the crucial youth market. In 1970 &quot;Car and Driver&quot; reported that while very few pony car drivers bought a second, around 50% purchased another model from the same manufacturer. Even so, by as early as 1969 sales were beginning to slide, dropping to 9% of the total market from a peak of 13% in 1967.

Directly inspired by the Ford Mustang, Ford of Europe began production of the Ford Capri in 1968 (using the Cortina MkII platform and driveline and a few components from the Escort), while GM Europe introduced the Opel Manta and Vauxhall Firenza. In April 1970, the Capri began to be imported from Europe and was sold in Lincoln-Mercury dealerships.

The success of the Mustang also inspired the creation of the Toyota Celica compact coupe, which was released in 1970. Toyota had earlier introduced the 1967 Toyota 1600GT 2-door hardtop and installed a DOHC I4 cylinder engine with dual carburetors and a 5-speed manual transmission. Like the Mustang, the Celica was built using the platform of an economy car; although the Celica was shorter than the Mustang and did not offer a V8 engine. Several Japanese automakers sold compact coupes in the United States as smaller competitors to pony cars. However, no Japanese manufacturer produced a pony car.

===1971–1975: Larger cars, declining sales===
As with many automobile redesigns, each subsequent generation of the pony cars grew larger, heavier, costlier, and more comfort-oriented. This trend was also influenced by many late 1960s and early 1970s pony car buyers purchasing optional equipment and models with higher prices. Examples of the increasing size and weight of pony cars are:
* The 1970 Dodge Challenger was only slightly smaller externally than the intermediate-sized four-door Dodge Coronet sedan. The Challenger was less than lighter than a typical intermediate sedan.
* The 1971 AMC Javelin was long, which is longer than the 1965 Ford Mustang.
* The 1973 Ford Mustang was longer, wider, and over heavier than the original 1965 Mustang.

Big block V8 engines became available in pony cars, which increased straight-line performance but underscored the limitations of the suspension, brakes, and tires. The six-cylinder and lower-specification V8 engines struggled with the increased weight of the pony cars.

By 1970 buyers were moving away from the pony cars, either toward smaller compact cars or the more luxurious personal luxury cars. The pony car market was also hindered by high insurance rates and increased restrictions on performance cars. Since1968, power outputs of the performance models had been eroding as a result of stricter vehicle emissions controls. By 1972, small imported sports cars were increasing in popularity, and the domestic pony cars were not selling well. Industry observers believed that the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird might be discontinued after the 1973 model year.

The 1973 oil crisis left the large and heavy pony cars out of step with the marketplace. The Mustang, which had grown to become an intermediate-sized car and alienated buyers, was downsized for its second-generation; this 1974 Ford Mustang II was marketed as a fuel-efficient model with luxury or sporty trim packages. Inspired by smaller imported sporty cars such as the Toyota Celica and Ford Capri, the new Mustang II was unveiled a few months prior to the 1973 oil embargo. Ford &quot;decided to call it Mustang II, since it was a new type of pony car designed for an era of high gas prices and fuel shortages.&quot; To compete with these new sporty subcompacts, General Motors introduced the 1975 Chevrolet Monza and its badge-engineered variants. GM&#x27;s original pony cars (the Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird) were almost canceled, but remained in production.

Chrysler Corporation did not downsize its pony car models, but instead discontinued the Dodge Challenger and Plymouth Barracuda after the 1974 model year. The AMC Javelin was also canceled after 1974. The 1974 Mercury Cougar—originally designed as an upscale version of the Ford Mustang—left the pony car segment, as the vehicle was upsized and marketed in the personal luxury car segment.

===1976–2004: Resurgence of popularity and performance===
The popularity of pony cars increased in the late 1970s with examples appearing in movies and TV programs like the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am in &quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;, the Pontiac Firebird in &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; and the Ford Mustang II Cobra II in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. The &quot;Z28&quot; high-performance option for the Chevrolet Camaro had been discontinued after 1974, however it was resurrected for 1977 due to the popularity of the Pontiac Firebird Trans Am.

The 1979 third generation Ford Mustang was redesigned using the larger Ford Fox platform. The redesigned Mustang also formed the basis of the second generation Mercury Capri, which replaced the European-built first-generation and was now available with a V8 engine.

Chrysler Corporation, beset by financial problems, did not revive the pony car, instead offering smaller coupes such as the Dodge Daytona and Chrysler Conquest (a badge-engineered Mitsubishi Starion) in this market segment.

American Motors Corporation remained absent from the pony car segment, however the 1979 AMC Spirit subcompact was marketed as a competitor to the hatchback versions of the Ford Mustang. The Spirit was available with four-cylinder, six-cylinder, or V8 engines, and the model range included sporty &quot;GT&quot; and &quot;AMX&quot; models. In 1982, the Spirit GT became America&#x27;s first pony car with a 5-speed manual.

In the early 1980s, concerns about fuel economy prompted Ford to seriously consider replacing the Mustang with a smaller front-wheel drive model (which eventually appeared as the Ford Probe instead). The Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird escaped a similar fate with General Motors&#x27; front-wheel drive &quot;GM-80&quot; program canceled late in development. Emissions and fuel economy concerns also led the 1982 Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird to be available with four-cylinder engines for the first time.

The introduction of fuel-injection on V8 engines in the mid-1980s—such as the Ford &quot;5.0&quot; engine (available in the 1986 Ford Mustang) and the General Motors &quot;LB9&quot; engine (introduced in the 1985 Chevrolet Camaro IROC-Z and Pontiac Firebird Trans Am)—benefitted the pony cars with increased power and fuel economy. However, declining sales and the growing popularity of light trucks and sport utility vehicles ultimately led to the Firebird and Camaro being discontinued after 2002, leaving the Mustang as the only remaining American-built pony car until the 2008 Dodge Challenger was introduced.

===2005–present: Retro-style revival===


Since the 1980s, the dilemma facing car manufacturers in offering pony cars is the lack of mass-produced automobile platforms to use as a basis for building them. Unlike the mid-1960s, the majority of modern compact cars are front-wheel drive with four- or six-cylinder engines, and engineering a dedicated rear-wheel drive performance vehicle platform specifically for a pony car is an expensive proposition.

The 2005 fifth generation Ford Mustang was the sole remaining pony car at the time of its introduction. The success of the Mustang-inspired the 2008 third generation Dodge Challenger to be introduced, followed by the 2010 fifth generation Chevrolet Camaro. Unlike previous pony cars, the Challenger and fifth-generation Camaro were built on the platforms from full-size cars. The Mustang and Camaro were sold in a coupe and convertible body styles, whereas the Challenger was sold only as a coupe.

The next generation of pony cars consisted of the 2015 sixth generation Ford Mustang and the 2016 sixth generation Chevrolet Camaro in 2015. The Mustang was the first pony car with independent rear suspension, a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and right-hand drive required for specific export markets. The sixth-generation Camaro was downsized from a full-sized platform to a mid-sized platform more in line with its traditional size.

The first all-wheel drive pony car was the V6-powered 2017 Dodge Challenger GT.

The seventh generation Mustang debuted in 2024. The new generation is very similar to the sixth generation in size, configuration, and options, though it does contain a new trim title the &quot;Dark Horse&quot;.

The sixth-generation Camaro will be discontinued at the end of the 2024 model year. However, Chevrolet has stated, &quot;This is not the end of Camaro&#x27;s story.&quot;

The current Dodge Challenger and Charger are expected to be discontinued after the 2023 model year, and replaced with a new, fully electric, retro-styled Charger Daytona, which will most likely be a 2-door coupe similar to the current Challenger. Ford plans to debut the fully electric eighth-generation Mustang in 2028, and GM is considering an electric Camaro coupe as well.

== Motor racing ==
There was much competition among the performance versions of the early pony cars, resulting in racing on the street, drag strip, and professional race circuits.

This grew so fierce between manufacturers that Trans-Am Series racing was formed and hotly contested from 1966 to 1972, described as a battle in &quot;The Pony Car Wars&quot;.

The 2000s pony car revival also saw a renewed focus on motor racing, beginning with the NASCAR Xfinity Series (then called the &quot;Nationwide Series&quot;) in 2010, where the Dodge Challenger and Ford Mustang silhouette racing cars were introduced. Modern pony cars have also competed in the Rolex Sports Car Series, SCCA World Challenge, and the Michelin Pilot Challenge. The Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro have been homologated for Group GT3 racing, and the Ford Mustang was homologated in 2017 for SRO GT4 racing. Pony cars like the Dodge Challenger, Ford Mustang, and Chevrolet Camaro are still used today in the NASCAR Pinty&#x27;s Series.

<doc id="670749" wikidata="Q1275898" url="?curid=670749" title="Poets' Corner">
<text>Poets&#x27; Corner is a section of the southern transept of Westminster Abbey in London, where many poets, playwrights, and writers are buried or commemorated.

The first poet interred in Poets&#x27; Corner was Geoffrey Chaucer in 1400. William Shakespeare was commemorated with a monument in 1740, over a century after his death. Over the centuries, a tradition has grown up of interring or memorialising people there in recognition of their contribution to British culture. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the honour is awarded to writers.

In 2009, the founders of the Royal Ballet were commemorated in a memorial floor stone and on 25 September 2010, the writer Elizabeth Gaskell was celebrated with the dedication of a panel in the memorial window. On 6 December 2011, former Poet Laureate Ted Hughes was commemorated with a floor stone. On 22 November 2013, the fiftieth anniversary of his death, writer C. S. Lewis was commemorated with a memorial floor stone. The poet Philip Larkin was commemorated with a floor stone dedicated on 2 December 2016.

==History==
The first poet interred in Poets&#x27; Corner, Geoffrey Chaucer, owed his 1400 burial in the Abbey (in front of St. Benedict&#x27;s Chapel) more to his position as Clerk of Works of the Palace of Westminster than to his fame as a writer. The erection of his tomb by Nicholas Brigham in 1556 (to where Chaucer&#x27;s remains were then transferred) and the nearby burial of Edmund Spenser in 1599 began a tradition that still continues. The area also houses the tombs of several Canons and Deans of the Abbey, as well as the grave of Thomas Parr who, it is said, died at the age of 152 in 1635 after having seen ten sovereigns on the throne.

Burial or commemoration in the Abbey does not always occur at or soon after the time of death. Lord Byron, for example, whose poetry was admired but who maintained a scandalous lifestyle, died in 1824 but was not given a memorial until 1969. Even William Shakespeare, buried at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1616, was not honoured with a monument until 1740 when one designed by William Kent was constructed in Poets&#x27; Corner (though shortly after Shakespeare&#x27;s death William Basse had suggested Shakespeare should be buried there). Samuel Horsley, Dean of Westminster in 1796, was said to have tartly refused the request for actress Kitty Clive to be buried in the Abbey:

if we do not draw some line in this theatrical ambition to mortuary fame, we shall soon make Westminster Abbey little better than a Gothic &quot;Green Room&quot;!

Not all poets appreciated memorialisation and Samuel Wesley&#x27;s epitaph for Samuel Butler, who supposedly died in poverty, continued Butler&#x27;s satiric tone:


Some of those buried in Poets&#x27; Corner also had memorials erected to them over or near their grave, either around the time of their death or later. In some cases, such as Joseph Addison, the burial took place elsewhere in Westminster Abbey, with a memorial later erected in Poets&#x27; Corner. In some cases a full burial of a body took place, in other, later, cases the body was cremated and the ashes buried. There are also cases where there was support for a particular individual to be buried in Poets&#x27; Corner, but the decision was made to bury them elsewhere in the Abbey, such as Edward Bulwer-Lytton. Other notable poets and writers, such as Aphra Behn, are buried elsewhere in the Abbey. At least two of the memorials (both to individuals buried in Poets&#x27; Corner – Rowe and Gay) were later moved to a location elsewhere in the Abbey due to the discovery of old paintings on the wall behind them. In 1936 the ashes of the author and poet Rudyard Kipling were interred.

==Memorial types==
The memorials can take several forms. Some are stone slabs set in the floor with a name and inscription carved on them, while others are more elaborate and carved stone monuments, or hanging stone tablets, or memorial busts. Some are commemorated in groups, such as the joint memorial for the Brontë sisters (commissioned in 1939, but not unveiled until 1947 due to the Second World War), the sixteen First World War poets inscribed on a stone floor slab and unveiled in 1985, and the four founders of the Royal Ballet, commemorated together in 2009.
The grave of Ben Jonson is not in Poets&#x27; Corner, but is in the north aisle of the nave. It has the inscription &quot;O Rare Ben Johnson&quot; &quot;(perhaps the original spelling)&quot; on the slab above it. It has been suggested that this could be read &quot;Orare Ben Johnson&quot; (pray for Ben Johnson), which would indicate a deathbed return to Catholicism, but the carving shows a distinct space between &quot;O&quot; and &quot;rare&quot;. The fact that he was buried in an upright grave could be an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death but it has also been suggested that Jonson asked for a grave exactly 18 inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space. As well as the gravestone in the north aisle of the nave, a wall tablet commemorating Jonson was later erected in Poets&#x27; Corner.

As floor and wall space began to run out, the decision was taken to install a stained glass memorial window (unveiled in 1994 in memory of Edward Horton Hubbard), and it is here that new names are added in the form of inscribed panes of glass. There is room for 20 names, and currently there are six names on this window, with the latest entry (Elizabeth Gaskell) unveiled on 25 September 2010. The memorial ceremonies often include guest speakers. In 1995, Oscar Wilde was commemorated in the window and those in attendance included Sir John Gielgud and Dame Judi Dench who both read extracts from his work.

==Memorials==
==First World War poets==
The memorial in Poets&#x27; Corner, Westminster Abbey, to 16 Great War poets is a slate stone slab with the names of the poets inscribed on it. It was unveiled on 11 November 1985, the 67th anniversary of the Armistice. An additional inscription quotes Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot;:

The † symbol indicates poets who died during the war.

==Royal Ballet==
The stone slab floor memorial to the four founders of the Royal Ballet was dedicated on 17 November 2009.

==Elsewhere in the Abbey==
Poets and writers commemorated elsewhere in Westminster Abbey, but not in Poets&#x27; Corner proper.

<doc id="670759" wikidata="Q2867078" url="?curid=670759" title="Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories">
<text>The Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly, or Legislative Council of the Northwest Territories (with Northwest hyphenated as North-West until 1906), is the legislature and the seat of government of Northwest Territories in Canada. It is a unicameral elected body that creates and amends law in the Northwest Territories. Permanently located in Yellowknife since 1993, the assembly was founded in 1870 and became active in 1872 with the first appointments from the Government of Canada.

Until 2014, the assembly was officially defined under federal law as &quot;Legislative Council&quot;. However, under Northwest Territories territorial law, it was defined as &quot;Legislative Assembly&quot;. The federal name was changed when the Northwest Territories Act was rewritten in 2014. Under different periods of its history it has alternated names.

Members of the Legislative Assembly are sworn in by the commissioner of the Northwest Territories.

==Early history==
The Legislative Assembly was first known as the Temporary North-West Council and was created in 1870. The first appointments to the council were made on December 28, 1872. The Temporary Council was dissolved in 1876 and a new permanent council was appointed and moved to the new capital of Fort Livingstone in 1876. The council moved to Battleford a year later based on the planned location there of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

The very first election to the Assembly would take place on March 23, 1881, as Lawrence Clarke was elected to represent the electoral district of Lorne. In 1883 the Assembly moved south to Regina based on amendments to the route of the railway. The first territory-wide election took place on September 15, 1885, known as the 1885 Northwest Territories election.

Three years later the first general election took place. All the voting members of the Assembly were elected for the first time, and an elected speaker took office. The Lieutenant Governor still had executive authority however and appointed and ran the cabinet. After the second general election in 1891 the first fully elected Assembly without any appointed members. The Assembly achieved Responsible Government for the first time in October 1897 as the Lieutenant Governor appointed Frederick Haultain as the first Premier to form a government. Robert Brett became the first Leader of the official opposition and party lines were roughly drawn based on Conservatives and Liberals.

The Haultain government lobbied for Government of Canada for provincial powers for the Northwest Territories. In response on September 1, 1905, the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier out of the southern populated portion of the territories.

==Court of law==
The Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly served as the first court of law in the Northwest Territories from 1876 until the creation of the Supreme Court of the Northwest Territories in 1887. Appointed members of the council served as stipendiary magistrates who would travel the territories and oversee legal cases when the legislature was not sitting. In 1887 the Northwest Territories moved to a new system that assigned judges to judicial districts and separated the legal and judicial branches.

==Ottawa==
After the creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the remainder of the Northwest Territories was too sparsely populated by enfranchised voters to justify holding elections. The territory reverted to its confederation entry status. A new council was set up in Ottawa consisting of a Commissioner—the effective replacement of the Lieutenant Governor—and four appointed members.

Frederick White was appointed as the first Commissioner and did not recall the council to sit during his time in office. During this time, the Territories were run by the federal Department of Mines and Resources. The first session of the Council of the Northwest Territories took place in 1921. The council members were bureaucrats appointed from the Interior Ministry and were not resident citizens of the territory.

In 1939, the Yellowknife Administration District was created to provide services within 25 miles of Yellowknife. However, it was not until 1947 that John G. McNiven was appointed to represent the district. McNiven was the first member appointed to the council from north of the 60th parallel.

In 1951 the council held its first general election in 49 years. The fifth general election elected three members from the District of Mackenzie. The old council was completely dissolved and five members were appointed along with the three elected representatives.

The council gradually gained more powers back from the federal government as the population in the territory grew. In 1967 the Carrothers Commission moved the territorial capital from Ottawa to Yellowknife and for the first time elected members represented all parts of the territories. In 1975 the Legislative Assembly became fully elected, and the first elected speaker since 1905, David Searle, presided over the Assembly.

==Consensus government==

Commissioner John Parker gave up his powers of running the executive council and appointed George Braden as leader of the government and the first premier since 1905. The model of responsible government that was used this time around was known as consensus government. The executive council or cabinet forms government while all the regular members form an unofficial opposition.

The modern consensus government model is inherently non-partisan and serves effectively as a constant minority government. The legislature uses this model up to the current day; the same model of government is also used in the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut, although Canada&#x27;s other territorial legislature, the Legislative Assembly of Yukon, uses a traditional partisan politics model.

The consensus government model has received criticism on various grounds, including that it hampers long-term political and economic development in the territory because the lack of political parties mean that there is no mechanism to carry over a political agenda from one assembly to the next; that it complicates the ability of less wealthy citizens to serve in the assembly because the lack of political parties means that election candidates must raise all of their campaign funds on their own; that it prevents the voters from being able to demand or vote for systemic change, since there is no mechanism to replace an ineffective or underperforming government with another alternative; and that it hampers efforts to improve diversity in representation, such as the election of more women and ethnic minorities to the legislature.

In 2018, MLA Kieron Testart introduced an amendment to the territorial Elections Act to permit the introduction of party politics in the legislative assembly, but his motion received no support from other MLAs and was dropped. In 2019, he planned to organize a group of ideologically aligned MLA candidates in the 2019 Northwest Territories general election into a &quot;Liberal Democratic&quot; slate, but backed off of the plan after it was leaked to the press.

==Assembly buildings==


The building that has housed the Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly has changed many times since it was founded. The first building was the original Manitoba Legislature in Fort Garry. After the council moved to Fort Livingstone it was housed in the Swan River Barracks used by the North-West Mounted Police.

The first building built for the needs of the Assembly was NWT Government House in Battleford. That building also served as a residence for the Lieutenant Governor. In 1883 the Assembly moved to Regina. The Territorial Administration building was built to accommodate the growing Assembly and used until 1905.

After the creation of Alberta and Saskatchewan, the capital was moved to Ottawa and the council sessions took place in an office building on Sparks Street. When the council sessions returned to the territories, they were held in any infrastructure suitable as they traveled from community to community.

After the capital was moved to Yellowknife in 1967 a temporary site for the Legislative Assembly was used until the new Legislature building was finished in 1993. The design of the current Legislature building was created by Pin/Taylor Architects company from Yellowknife.

==Membership==

The membership of the 20th Northwest Territories Legislative Assembly, was selected in the 2023 Northwest Territories general election on November 14, 2023. Each member represents one electoral district.

The territory has fixed election date legislation that ensures elections are held every four years on the first Monday in October.

The legislature since 1905 is a non-partisan body and all members run and sit as independents.

Jane Weyallon Armstrong&#x27;s by-election win in Monfwi on July 27, 2021, during the 19th Legislative Assembly, saw the Northwest Territories become the first provincial or territorial government in Canada with a majority of its membership identifying as female. At the time, the territory was also lead by the nation&#x27;s only female premier, Caroline Cochrane.


The current membership is as follows:

==Cabinet Ministers==
The seven ministers of the Government of the NWT are found in the Executive Council of the Northwest Territories.

<text>Biostratigraphy is the branch of stratigraphy which focuses on correlating and assigning relative ages of rock strata by using the fossil assemblages contained within them. The primary objective of biostratigraphy is &quot;correlation&quot;, demonstrating that a particular horizon in one geological section represents the same period of time as another horizon at a different section. Fossils within these strata are useful because sediments of the same age can look completely different, due to local variations in the sedimentary environment. For example, one section might have been made up of clays and marls, while another has more chalky limestones. However, if the fossil species recorded are similar, the two sediments are likely to have been laid down around the same time. Ideally these fossils are used to help identify biozones, as they make up the basic biostratigraphy units, and define geological time periods based upon the fossil species found within each section.

Basic concepts of biostratigraphic principles were introduced centuries ago, going as far back as the early 1800s. A Danish scientist and bishop by the name of Nicolas Steno was one of the first geologists to recognize that rock layers correlate to the Law of Superposition. With advancements in science and technology, by the 18th century it began to be accepted that fossils were remains left by species that had become extinct, but were then preserved within the rock record. The method was well-established before Charles Darwin explained the mechanism behind it—evolution. Scientists William Smith, George Cuvier, and Alexandre Brongniart came to the conclusion that fossils then indicated a series of chronological events, establishing layers of rock strata as some type of unit, later termed biozone. From here on, scientists began relating the changes in strata and biozones to different geological eras, establishing boundaries and time periods within major faunal changes. By the late 18th century the Cambrian and Carboniferous periods were internationally recognized due to these findings. During the early 20th century, advancements in technology gave scientists the ability to study radioactive decay. Using this methodology, scientists were able to establish geological time, the boundaries of the different eras (Paleozoic, Mesozoic, Cenozoic), as well as Periods (Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian) through the isotopes found within fossils via radioactive decay. Current 21st century uses of biostratigraphy involve interpretations of age for rock layers, which are primarily used by oil and gas industries for drilling workflows and resource allocations.
== Fossils as a basis for stratigraphic subdivision ==
Fossil assemblages were traditionally used to designate the duration of periods. Since a large change in fauna was required to make early stratigraphers create a new period, most of the periods we recognize today are terminated by a major extinction event or faunal turnover.

===Concept of stage===

A stage is a major subdivision of strata, each systematically following the other each bearing a unique assemblage of fossils. Therefore, stages can be defined as a group of strata containing the same major fossil assemblages. French palaeontologist Alcide d&#x27;Orbigny is credited for the invention of this concept. He named stages after geographic localities with particularly good sections of rock strata that bear the characteristic fossils on which the stages are based.

===Concept of zone===

In 1856 German palaeontologist Albert Oppel introduced the concept of zone (also known as biozones or Oppel zone). A zone includes strata characterized by the overlapping range of fossils. They represent the time between the appearance of species chosen at the base of the zone and the appearance of other species chosen at the base of the next succeeding zone. Oppel&#x27;s zones are named after a particular distinctive fossil species, called an index fossil. Index fossils are one of the species from the assemblage of species that characterize the zone.

Biostratigraphy uses zones for the most fundamental unit of measurement. The thickness and range of these zones can be a few meters, up to hundreds of meters. They can also range from local to worldwide, as the extent of which they can reach in the horizontal plane relies on tectonic plates and tectonic activity. Two of the tectonic processes that run the risk of changing these zones&#x27; ranges are metamorphic folding and subduction. Furthermore, biostratigraphic units are divided into six principal kinds of biozones: Taxon range biozone, Concurrent range biozone, Interval biozone, Lineage biozone, Assemblage biozone, and Abundance biozone.

The Taxon range biozone represents the known stratigraphic and geographic range of occurrence of a single taxon. Concurrent range biozone includes the concurrent, coincident, or overlapping part of the range of two specified taxa. Interval biozones include the strata between two specific biostratigraphic surfaces and can be based on lowest or highest occurrences. Lineage biozones are strata containing species representing a specific segment of an evolutionary lineage. Assemblage biozones are strata that contain a unique association of three or more taxa within it. Abundance biozones are strata in which the abundance of a particular taxon or group of taxa is significantly greater than in the adjacent part of the section.

====Index fossils====
Index fossils (also known as guide fossils, indicator fossils, or dating fossils) are the fossilized remains or traces of particular plants or animals that are characteristic of a particular span of geologic time or environment, and can be used to identify and date the containing rocks. To be practical, index fossils must have a limited vertical time range, wide geographic distribution, and rapid evolutionary trends. Rock formations separated by great distances but containing the same index fossil species are thereby known to have both formed during the limited time that the species lived.

Index fossils were originally used to define and identify geologic units, then became a basis for defining geologic periods, and then for faunal stages and zones.

Ammonites, graptolites, archeocyathids, inoceramids, and trilobites are groups of animals from which many species have been identified as index fossils that are widely used in biostratigraphy. Species of microfossils such as acritarchs, chitinozoans, conodonts, dinoflagellate cysts, ostracods, pollen, spores and foraminiferans are also frequently used. Different fossils work well for sediments of different ages; trilobites, for example, are particularly useful for sediments of Cambrian age. A long series of ammonite and inoceramid species are particularly useful for correlating environmental events around the world during the super-greenhouse of the Late Cretaceous.

To work well, the fossils used must be widespread geographically, so that they can be found in many different places. They must also be short-lived as a species, so that the period of time during which they could be incorporated in the sediment is relatively narrow. The longer lived the species, the poorer the stratigraphic precision, so fossils that evolve rapidly, such as ammonites, are favored over forms that evolve much more slowly, like nautiloids.

Often biostratigraphic correlations are based on a faunal assemblage, rather than an individual species — this allows greater precision as the time span in which all of the species in the assemblage existed together is narrower than the time spans of any of the members. Furthermore, if only one species is present in a sample, it can mean either that (1) the strata were formed in the known fossil range of that organism; or (2) that the fossil range of the organism was incompletely known, and the strata extend the known fossil range. For instance, the presence of the trace fossil &quot;Treptichnus pedum&quot; was used to define the base of the Cambrian period, but it has since been found in older strata. If the fossil is easy to preserve and easy to identify, more precise time estimating of the stratigraphic layers is possible.

====Faunal succession====

The concept of faunal succession was theorized at the beginning of the 19th century by William Smith. When Smith was studying rock strata, he began to recognize that rock outcrops contained a unique collection of fossils. The idea that these distant rock outcrops contained similar fossils allowed for Smith to order rock formations throughout England. With Smith&#x27;s work on these rock outcrops and mapping around England, he began to notice some beds of rock may contain mostly similar species, however there were also subtle differences within or between these fossil groups. This difference in assemblages that appeared identical at first, lead to the principle of faunal succession, where fossil organisms succeed one another in a definite and determinable order, and therefore any time period can be categorized by its fossil extent.

<doc id="670774" wikidata="Q2524763" url="?curid=670774" title="The Washington Post (march)">
<text>&quot;The Washington Post&quot; (often called &quot;The Washington Post March&quot;) is a march composed by John Philip Sousa in 1889. Since then, it has remained as one of his most popular marches throughout the United States and many other countries.

== History ==

In 1888, the recent purchasers of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; newspaper—Frank Hatton, a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio—requested that Sousa, the leader of the United States Marine Band, compose a march for the newspaper&#x27;s essay contest awards ceremony, in conjunction with a campaign to promote the newspaper under new ownership. Sousa obliged; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; was introduced at a ceremony on June 15, 1889, &quot;with President Benjamin Harrison in attendance&quot; before &quot;a huge crowd on the grounds of the Smithsonian Museum&quot;. It quickly became quite popular in both the United States and Europe as the standard musical accompaniment to the two-step, a late 19th-century dance craze. This led to a British journalist dubbing Sousa &quot;The March King&quot;. Sousa is honored in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; building for his contribution to the newspaper and his country.

The composition is in the public domain in the US, as its copyright has expired, due to Sousa&#x27;s death more than 70 years ago and its publication before the early 1920s.

During the award ceremony the young essay-contest winners were presented with gold medals that were hand-crafted by local jewelers Galt &amp; Bro., with each having unique designs and custom engravings.

&lt;/score&gt;

=== Music ===

This recognizable march is written in standard form: IAABBCCDCDC. Written in compound duple meter, it is suited as an accompaniment to the two-step, a new dance introduced at that time.

The opening strain of the march is famous and familiar to many. Typically, the march is played at a tempo of 110 to 120 beats per minute, rarely any faster.

March enthusiasts have argued that the trio sections&#x27; mellow and moving phrases are among Sousa&#x27;s most musical. Six sudden eighth notes move the melody along. Its unusually calm break strain is a simple adaptation of the trio melody. It then moves on to the first trio repeat, where the low brass begins an even more mellow countermelody.

=== Scoring ===

*Woodwinds: 2 flutes, piccolo, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons
*Brass: 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba
*Percussion: timpani, cymbals, bass drum, snare drum, triangle
*Strings: violins I and II, violas, cellos, double basses

== Dance ==

The &quot;two-step&quot; became so strongly identified with Sousa&#x27;s march that the dance was often called &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. In addition, many performance arts groups around the world dance to the famous song. 

== Recordings ==

Although many recordings of this march have been made over the years, the original recording of the march played by the United States Marine Band, conducted by Sousa&#x27;s concertmaster, was made on Graphophone cylinder for the fledgling Columbia Records company in Washington, D.C., in 1890, catalogue Columbia Cylinder Military #8. It has been reissued in the compact disc era in 1999 by Legacy International as &quot;March King: John Philip Sousa Conducts His Own Marches&quot;, and as the earliest track of its 26-disc compendium of the history of the Columbia label, &quot;Sony Music 100 Years: Soundtrack For A Century&quot;. In 1893, this march was recorded on North American Phonograph Company cylinder #613 by Foh&#x27;s 23rd Regiment Band of New York. This acoustical recording, unlike many others, has audible, clear, well-recorded drums.

<text>An imperial guard or palace guard is a special group of troops (or a member thereof) of an empire, typically closely associated directly with the emperor and/or empress. Usually these troops embody a more elite status than other imperial forces, including the regular armed forces, and maintain special rights, privileges and traditions.

Because the head of state often wishes to be protected by the best soldiers available, their numbers and organisation may be expanded to carry out additional tasks. Napoleon&#x27;s Imperial Guard is an example of this.

In heterogeneous polities reliant on a greater degree of coercion to maintain central authority the political reliability and loyalty of the guard is the most important factor in their recruitment. In such cases the ranks of the guard may be filled with on the one hand royal kinsman and clansman with a stake in the survival of the ruling family, and on the other with members socially and culturally divorced from the general population and therefore reliant on imperial patronage for their survival, for example the Varangian Guards (recruiting solely foreigners), and the Janissaries (Christian children taken as slaves from childhood, to serve the Muslim sultan).

In the post-colonial period, the term has been used colloquially and derisively to describe the staff of a person, usually a politician or corporate executive officer, that acts to prevent direct communication with the person.

<doc id="670776" wikidata="Q4788646" url="?curid=670776" title="Area codes 905, 289, 365, and 742">
<text>Area codes 905, 289, 365, and 742 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the Golden Horseshoe region that surrounds Lake Ontario in Southern Ontario, Canada. The numbering plan area (NPA) comprises (clockwise) the Niagara Peninsula, the city of Hamilton, the regional municipalities of Halton, Peel, York, Durham, and parts of Northumberland County, but excludes the City of Toronto.

The four area codes form an overlay numbering plan for the same geographic region, where area code 905 was established in October 1993 in an area code split from area code 416. When 289 was overlaid on June 9, 2001, all local calls required ten-digit dialing. On April 13, 2010, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) introduced another overlay code, area code 365, which became operational on March 25, 2013. Area code 742 was added to the overlay on October 16, 2021.

The numbering plan area surrounds the city of Toronto (area codes 416/647/437), leading locals to refer to the primarily suburban cities surrounding Toronto as &quot;the 905&quot; or &quot;905 belt&quot;. It is bound by the 519/226/548/382 overlay area in the west, 705/249/683 in the north, 613/343/753 in the east, and Western New York State&#x27;s 716/624 area on the eastern prong of the Niagara Peninsula. The incumbent local exchange carrier is Bell Canada.

==History==
From the 1960s, area code 905 was assigned for special call routing arrangements to Mexico City during the time when Mexico was expected to join the North American Numbering Plan. After establishing its own numbering plan with country code +52, these arrangement were continued into the 1980s. The assignment of 905 was finally officially withdrawn by February 1, 1991.

By October 1991, area code 905 had been assigned to relieve exchanges in the Golden Horseshoe, which was and still is Canada&#x27;s largest toll-free calling zone. The Golden Horseshoe&#x27;s explosive growth in the second half of the 20th century and the corresponding expansion of telecommunications service would have made another area code necessary in any event. However, the timetable was advanced because Canada&#x27;s system of number allocation does not use number pooling as a relief measure. Instead, each competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) is assigned blocks of 10,000 numbers, which correspond to a single three-digit prefix, for every rate centre in which it plans to offer service. Most rate centres do not need that many numbers, but excess numbers cannot be reassigned elsewhere once they are assigned to a rate centre. The problem was not as severe in the Golden Horseshoe as in the rest of Canada since, numbers have tended to be used up fairly quickly. However, the number allocation system did not allow number blocks to be reassigned from smaller rate centres to the Toronto rate centre. The proliferation of cell phones, pagers, fax machines, and dial-up Internet connections made it obvious that the Golden Horseshoe needed another area code.

Automatic number identification (ANI) in some central office switching systems in the numbering plan area started operation on October 11, 1992. The new area code entered service on October 11, 1993. Permissive dialing of 416 continued across the Golden Horseshoe until January 1, 1994. However, portions of the 905 territory have remained ever since a local call to Toronto.

The creation of area code 905 was intended as a long-term solution. However, five years after its introduction, area code 905 was close to exhaustion far sooner than anticipated, again due to the proliferation of cell phones and pagers. By 1999, the CRTC had established an ad hoc committee to study code relief planning for area code 905. A split of the NPA was considered, with various options being presented:
* a geographic split by municipality (either two-way or three-way)
* a geographic split of concentric rings around Toronto
* a realignment of NPA boundaries
* a distributed overlay

The overlay option was chosen because it would cause the least disruption and was supported by all of the carriers. A split would have forced customers to change their numbers for the second time in less than a decade and forced the reassignment of cellphone numbers. For the same reason, Toronto was overlaid with area code 647 (and later 437).

NPA 289 was approved by the CRTC on August 15, 2000 in Order CRTC 2000–772. The order had the CRTC direct Bell Canada to implement a ten-digit local dialing plan. Permissive seven-digit or ten-digit dialing for 905-customers began on April 7, 2001, before the in-service date for 289 of June 9, 2001.

The Golden Horseshoe&#x27;s continued growth caused area code 365 to be assigned for further relief on March 25, 2013. Also, area code 742 was assigned on October 16, 2021.

A numbering plan exhaust analysis of 2020 projected an exhaust date of March 2023 for the numbering plan area.

Area code 537 was reserved as a fifth area code for the region in November 2022.

==In popular culture==
The term &quot;the 905&quot; or &quot;the 905 belt&quot; is used to describe the suburban areas of the Greater Toronto Area, while Toronto proper is referred to as &quot;the 416&quot;. The term &quot;905er&quot; is often used pejoratively by Toronto residents to refer to suburban residents outside the city. Canadian rapper Maestro rendered homage to the area code in his song &quot;416/905 (TO Party Anthem)&quot;; &quot;TO&quot; (pronounced &quot;T&quot; &quot;O&quot;) is an abbreviation or nickname locals use when referring to the city of Toronto. In June 2015, Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment announced the formation of an NBA Development League team for the Toronto Raptors based in Mississauga called Raptors 905.

The term has been used in the context of Canadian politics, where the 416 is a stronghold of Liberals and NDP, whereas the 905 (excluding Hamilton) historically had strong ties to the Progressive Conservative Party. The region has, however, backed opposition parties as a protest vote, including both the NDP in the 1990 provincial election and the Liberals in the 2003 provincial election, as a backlash to the incumbent government. In both cases, the opposition party was elected to government with strong backing of the 905 region. The 2011 federal election saw the 905 region become predominately represented by candidates of the Conservative Party of Canada, while one third of the 416 ridings were won by Conservatives, many through vote splitting between the Liberals and NDP. In the 2019 federal election, the Liberals successfully held all 25 ridings in the 416, which they won in 2015. However, the parties were fighting over control over the 905 as historically, winning the 905 is key to parties forming government and the region has become a political bellwether. In the end, most 905 ridings were won by the Liberals over the Conservatives. The Liberals ultimately beat the Conservatives and formed a minority government with the support of the 905.

<text>Sonora is a state in Northwestern Mexico that is divided into 72 municipalities. According to the 2020 Mexican census, it is the eighteenth most populated state with inhabitants and the 2nd largest by land area spanning . The largest municipality by population is Hermosillo, with 936,263 residents (31.79% of the state&#x27;s total), while the smallest is Onavas with 365 residents. The largest municipality by land area is also Hermosillo which spans , and the smallest is San Felipe de Jesús with . The newest municipalities are Benito Juárez and San Ignacio Río Muerto, established in 1996.

Municipalities in Sonora are administratively autonomous of the state according to the 115th article of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico. Every three years, citizens elect a municipal president (Spanish: &quot;presidente municipal&quot;) by a plurality voting system who heads a concurrently elected municipal council (&quot;ayuntamiento&quot;) responsible for providing all the public services for their constituents. The municipal council consists of a variable number of trustees and councillors (&quot;regidores y síndicos&quot;). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewerage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, and the maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. Since 1984, they have had the power to collect property taxes and user fees, although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own income.

<text>SNDMSG was an early electronic mail program, chiefly notable because it was used to send what is considered the first networked email.

SNDMSG was originally the electronic mail program for a single multi-user time-sharing computer running the TENEX operating system. It allowed all users of the machine to send a simple form of email to each other. The program was extended by Ray Tomlinson in 1971 to allow sending to users on other computers accessible over the ARPANET, using the then introduced FTP Mail command and addressing them by appending the other system&#x27;s host name after an &quot;@&quot; sign.
SNDMSG along with READMAIL were the key components of networked mail on TENEX.

<text>Victoria is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Seychelles, situated on the north-eastern side of Mahé, the archipelago&#x27;s main island. The city was first established as the seat of the British colonial government. In 2010, the population of Greater Victoria (including the suburbs) was 26,450 (26.66%) out of the country&#x27;s total population of 99,202.
The port is known as Port Victoria.

==History==
The area that would become Victoria was originally settled in 1778 by French colonists after they claimed the island in 1756. The town was called &quot;L&#x27;Établissement&quot; until 1841 when it was renamed to Victoria by the British, after Queen Victoria.

== Economy ==
Tourism is an important sector of the economy. The principal exports of Victoria are vanilla, coconuts, coconut oil, fish and guano.

== Education ==
The Mont Fleuri campus of the University of Seychelles is in Victoria.

== Culture ==

Attractions in the city include a clocktower modelled on Little Ben in London, the courthouse, the Botanical Gardens, the National Museum of History, the Natural History Museum and the Sir Selwyn Selwyn-Clarke Market. Victoria Market and the brightly coloured fish and fruit markets is the local hot spot for the Seychellois people.

== Places of worship ==
There are two cathedrals in Victoria, Immaculate Conception Cathedral (Roman Catholic) and St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (Anglican). There are also Baptist and Pentecostal churches, mosques and Hindu temples.

== Sports ==
Stade Linité, the national stadium, is in Victoria. It is mostly used for football matches.

== Transport ==
Victoria is served by Seychelles International Airport, completed in 1971. The inner harbour lies immediately east of the town, where tuna fishing and canning is a major industry. One of the largest bridges in Victoria was destroyed by tsunami waves from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake.

==Districts==
Four of the districts of Seychelles are in Victoria:
*English River (La Rivière Anglaise), the central district
*Saint Louis
*Mont Fleuri
*Bel Air

==Twin towns and sister cities==
Victoria is twinned with:
==Climate==
Victoria features a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) with high temperatures throughout the course of the year. The capital does have noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year, with June and July being its driest months and December through February being the city&#x27;s wettest months. However, since in no month does the average monthly precipitation falls below in Victoria, the city does not have a true dry season month. This lack of a true dry season month is a primary reason why the climate falls under the tropical rainforest climate category. The capital averages about of rainfall annually. Although being very rainy, skies are usually clear to partly clear and completely cloudy days remain scarce throughout the year even during the rainiest months.

<doc id="670783" wikidata="Q1037959" url="?curid=670783" title="Wake turbulence">
<text>Wake turbulence is a disturbance in the atmosphere that forms behind an aircraft as it passes through the air. It includes several components, the most significant of which are wingtip vortices and jet-wash, the rapidly moving gases expelled from a jet engine.

Wake turbulence is especially hazardous in the region behind an aircraft in the takeoff or landing phases of flight. During take-off and landing, an aircraft operates at a high angle of attack. This flight attitude maximizes the formation of strong vortices. In the vicinity of an airport, there can be multiple aircraft, all operating at low speed and low altitude; this provides an extra risk of wake turbulence with a reduced height from which to recover from any upset.

==Definition==
Wake turbulence is a type of clear-air turbulence. In the case of wake turbulence created by the wings of a heavy aircraft, the rotating vortex-pair lingers for a significant amount of time after the passage of the aircraft, sometimes more than a minute. One of these rotating vortices can seriously upset or even invert a smaller aircraft that encounters it, either in the air or on the ground.

===In fixed-wing level flight===
The vortex circulation is outward, upward, and around the wingtips when viewed from either ahead or behind the aircraft. Tests with large aircraft have shown that vortices remain spaced less than a wingspan apart, drifting with the wind, at altitudes greater than a wingspan from the ground. Tests have also shown that the vortices sink at a rate of several hundred feet per minute, slowing their descent and diminishing in strength with time and distance behind the generating aircraft.

At altitude, vortices sink at a rate of per minute and stabilize about below the flight level of the generating aircraft. Therefore, aircraft operating at altitudes greater than are considered to be at less risk.

When the vortices of larger aircraft sink close to the ground — within — they tend to move laterally over the ground at a speed of . A crosswind decreases the lateral movement of the upwind vortex and increases the movement of the downwind vortex.

===Helicopters===

Helicopters also produce wake turbulence. Helicopter wakes may be significantly stronger than those of a fixed-wing aircraft of the same weight. The strongest wake will occur when the helicopter is operating at slower speeds (20 to 50 knots). Light helicopters with two-blade rotor systems produce a wake as strong as heavier helicopters with more than two blades. The strong rotor wake of the Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey tiltrotor can extend further and has contributed to a crash.

==Hazard avoidance==
Wingtip devices may slightly lessen the power of wingtip vortices. However, such changes are not significant enough to change the distances or times at which it is safe to follow other aircraft.

===Wake turbulence categories===
ICAO mandates wake turbulence categories based upon the maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of the aircraft. These are used for separation of aircraft during take-off and landing.
There are a number of separation criteria for take-off, landing, and en-route phases of flight based upon wake turbulence categories. Air Traffic Controllers will sequence aircraft making instrument approaches with regard to these criteria. The aircraft making a visual approach is advised of the relevant recommended spacing and are expected to maintain their separation.

===Parallel or crossing runways===
During takeoff and landing, an aircraft&#x27;s wake sinks toward the ground and moves laterally away from the runway when the wind is calm. A crosswind will tend to keep the upwind side of the wake in the runway area and may cause the downwind side to drift toward another runway. Since the wingtip vortices exist at the outer edge of an airplane&#x27;s wake, this can be dangerous. 

===Staying at or above the leader&#x27;s glide path===
===Warning signs===

Uncommanded aircraft movements (such as wing rocking) may be caused by wake. This is why maintaining situational awareness is critical. Ordinary turbulence is not unusual, particularly in the approach phase. A pilot who suspects wake turbulence is affecting his or her aircraft should get away from the wake, execute a missed approach or go-around and be prepared for a stronger wake encounter. The onset of wake can be subtle and even surprisingly gentle. There have been serious accidents (see the next section) where pilots have attempted to salvage a landing after encountering moderate wake only to encounter severe wake turbulence that they were unable to overcome. Pilots should not depend on any aerodynamic warning, but if the onset of wake is occurring, immediate evasive action is vital.

=== Plate lines ===
In 2020, researchers looked into installing &quot;plate lines&quot; near the runway threshold to induce secondary vortices and shorten the vortex duration. In the trial installation at Vienna International Airport, they reported a 22%-37% vortex reduction.

==Incidents involving wake turbulence==

*8 June 1966 – an XB-70 collided with an F-104. Though the true cause of the collision is unknown, it is believed that due to the XB-70 being designed to have enhanced wake turbulence to increase lift, the F-104 moved too close, therefore getting caught in the vortex and colliding with the wing (see main article).
* A DC-9 crashed at the Greater Southwest International Airport while performing &quot;touch and go&quot; landings behind a DC-10. This crash prompted the FAA to create new rules for minimum following separation from &quot;heavy&quot; aircraft.
*16 Jan 1987 – A Yakovlev Yak-40 crashed just after take-off in Tashkent. The flight took off just one minute fifteen seconds after an Ilyushin Il-76, thus encountering its wake vortex. The Yakovlev Yak-40 then banked sharply to the right, struck the ground, and caught fire. All nine people on board Aeroflot Flight 505 died.
*6 February 1991 – A Boeing KC-135E Stratotanker, registered as 58-0013, suffered an accident when two out of the four engines detached from the aircraft due to severe wake turbulence from another KC-135 and from high winds. The pilots managed to execute an emergency at Prince Abdullah Air Base, Saudi Arabia, saving all four crew members onboard.
*15 December 1993 – A chartered aircraft with five people on board, including In-N-Out Burger president Rich Snyder, crashed several miles before John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California. The aircraft was following a Boeing 757 for landing when it became caught in its wake turbulence, rolled into a deep descent, and crashed. As a result of this and other incidents involving aircraft following behind a Boeing 757, the FAA now employs the separation rules of heavy aircraft for the Boeing 757.
*20 September 1999 – A JAS 39A Gripen from Airwing F 7 Såtenäs crashed into Lake Vänern in Sweden during an air combat maneuvering exercise. After passing through the wake vortex of the other aircraft, the Gripen abruptly changed course. Before the Gripen impacted the ground, the pilot ejected from the aircraft and landed safely by parachute in the lake.
*12 November 2001 – American Airlines Flight 587 crashed into the Belle Harbor neighborhood of Queens, New York, shortly after takeoff from John F. Kennedy International Airport. The accident was attributed to the first officer&#x27;s misuse of the rudder in response to wake turbulence from a Japan Airlines Boeing 747, resulting in the overstressing and separation of the vertical stabilizer.
*8 July 2008 – A United States Air Force PC-12 trainer crashed at Hurlburt Field, Fla., when the pilot tried to land too closely behind a larger AC-130U Spooky gunship and was caught in the gunship&#x27;s wake turbulence. Air Force rules require at least a two-minute separation between slow-moving heavy planes like the AC-130U and small, light planes, but the PC-12 trailed the gunship by only about 40 seconds. As the PC-12 hit the wake turbulence, it suddenly rolled to the left and began to turn upside down. The instructor pilot stopped the roll, but before he could get the plane upright, the left wing struck the ground, sending the plane skidding across a field before stopping on a paved overrun.
*3 November 2008 – The wake turbulence of an Airbus A380-800 caused temporary loss of control to a Saab 340 on approach to a parallel runway during high crosswind conditions.
*4 November 2008 – In the 2008 Mexico City plane crash, a Learjet 45 carrying Mexican Interior Secretary Juan Camilo Mouriño crashed near Paseo de la Reforma Avenue when turning for final approach to runway 05R at Mexico City International Airport. The airplane was flying behind a 767-300 and above a heavy helicopter. According to the Mexican government, the pilots were not told about the type of plane that was approaching before them, nor did they reduce to minimum approach speed.
* 9 September 2012 – A Robin DR 400 crashed after rolling 90 degrees in wake turbulence induced by the preceding Antonov An-2. Three were killed and one was severely injured.
* 28 March 2014 – An Indian Air Force C-130J-30 KC-3803 crashed near Gwalior, India, killing all five personnel aboard. The aircraft was conducting low level penetration training by flying at around when it ran into wake turbulence from another C-130J aircraft that was leading the formation, causing it to crash.
* 7 January 2017 – A private Bombardier Challenger 604 rolled three times in midair and dropped after encountering wake turbulence when it passed under an Airbus A380 over the Arabian Sea. Several passengers were injured, one seriously. Due to the G-forces experienced, the plane was damaged beyond repair and was consequently written off.
* 14 June 2018 – At 11:29 pm, Qantas passenger flight QF94, en route from Los Angeles to Melbourne, suffered a sudden freefall over the ocean after lift-off as a result of an intense wake vortex. The event lasted for about ten seconds, according to the passengers. The turbulence was caused by the wake of the previous Qantas flight QF12, which had departed only two minutes before flight QF94.

==Measurement==
Wake turbulence can be measured using several techniques. Currently, ICAO recognizes two methods of measurement, sound tomography, and a high-resolution technique, the Doppler lidar, a solution now commercially available. Techniques using optics can use the effect of turbulence on refractive index (optical turbulence) to measure the distortion of light that passes through the turbulent area and indicate the strength of that turbulence.

==Audibility==
Wake turbulence can occasionally, under the right conditions, be heard by ground observers. On a still day, the wake turbulence from heavy jets on landing approach can be heard as a dull roar or whistle. This is the strong core of the vortex. If the aircraft produces a weaker vortex, the breakup will sound like tearing a piece of paper. Often, it is first noticed some seconds after the direct noise of the passing aircraft has diminished. The sound then gets louder. Nevertheless, being highly directional, wake turbulence sound is easily perceived as originating a considerable distance behind the aircraft, its apparent source moving across the sky just as the aircraft did. It can persist for 30 seconds or more, continually changing timbre, sometimes with swishing and cracking notes, until it finally dies away.

==In popular culture==

In the 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, Lieutenant Pete &quot;Maverick&quot; Mitchell, played by Tom Cruise, suffers two flameouts caused by passing through the jetwash of another aircraft, piloted by fellow aviator Tom &quot;Ice Man&quot; Kazansky (played by Val Kilmer). As a result, he is put into an unrecoverable spin and is forced to eject, killing his RIO Nick &quot;Goose&quot; Bradshaw. In a subsequent incident, he is caught in an enemy fighter&#x27;s jetwash, but manages to recover safely.

In the movie &quot;Pushing Tin&quot;, air traffic controllers stand just off the threshold of a runway while an aircraft lands in order to experience wake turbulence firsthand. However, the film dramatically exaggerates the effect of turbulence on persons standing on the ground, showing the protagonists being blown about by the passing aircraft. In reality, the turbulence behind and below a landing aircraft is too gentle to knock over a person standing on the ground. (In contrast, jet blast from an aircraft &quot;taking off&quot; can be extremely dangerous to people standing behind the aircraft.)

<doc id="670785" wikidata="Q3141518" url="?curid=670785" title="How to Start a Fire">
<text>How to Start a Fire is the second album by the Pompano Beach, Florida rock band Further Seems Forever, released in 2003 by Tooth &amp; Nail Records. It was the band&#x27;s only album with vocalist Jason Gleason, who had replaced original singer Chris Carrabba when the latter left the band to focus on his new project Dashboard Confessional. Gleason would leave the band the following year due to interpersonal tensions and be replaced by former Sense Field singer Jon Bunch. &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; was also the band&#x27;s first album with guitarist Derick Cordoba, replacing original guitarist Nick Dominguez.

==Background and production==
Frontman Chris Carrabba left Further Seems Forever as his side project Dashboard Confessional was becoming popular. He returned briefly to record the group&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; (2001), but left before its eventual release. Following this, the group enlisted former Affinity vocalist Jason Gleason as their frontman. His earliest recorded performances appeared on the &quot;Rock Music: A Tribute to Weezer&quot; (2001) and &quot;Punk Goes Pop&quot; (2001) compilations. Guitarist Nick Dominguez was replaced by Derick Cordoba.

Recording for &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; started in June 2002, with sessions taking place at Wisner Productions. James Paul Wisner and Further Seems Forever served as producers; Wisner handled recording, engineering and mixing. Halfway through recording, the band toured as part of the Warped Tour in mid-2002, and later embarked on an east coast and midwestern US tour with Breaking Pangaea. After returning home, they spent another month recording. Alan Douches mastered the tracks at West West Side Mastering.

==Composition==
Musically, the sound of &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; has been described as emo and indie rock, drawing comparisons to the Juliana Theory, Taking Back Sunday, Jimmy Eat World and early Manic Street Preachers. The band operated in two modes for the album: louder tracks with angular guitar lines and harsh rhythm parts with catchy chorus sections, as displayed in the title-track and &quot;The Sound&quot;; and the softer mode, as shown in &quot;A Blank Page Empire&quot; and &quot;I Am&quot;. It introduces string and piano instrumentation into the group&#x27;s sound and showcases Gleason&#x27;s vocal style, which was similar to Carrabba&#x27;s albeit grainer. The lyrics focused on poetic imagery to convey the tone; Gleason offered a darker perspective, in comparison to Carabba, which was mainly pessimistic with overtones of hope. Wisner provided keyboard and additional guitar parts to the recordings.

The opening track &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; starts with the sound of a struck match, shifting into a hardcore punk-indebted song. &quot;The Sound&quot; bounces between post-hardcore verse sections and harmony-infused chorus sections in the vein of Cheap Trick. &quot;A Blank Page Empire&quot; is an alternative blues shuffle track about dealing with the loss of a loved one, and was compared to &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; track &quot;Snowbirds and Townies&quot;. &quot;I Am&quot; is about questioning the viability of a strained relationship. It starts off partially acoustic before building to an electric ending, in the vein of &quot;For Evangeline&quot; by the Juliana Theory and &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot; number &quot;Monachett&quot;. &quot;Pride War&quot; tackles the theme of egotism. &quot;On Legendary&quot; opens with an acoustic guitar intro. &quot;Insincerity as an Artform&quot; features the use of guitar harmonics. &quot;The Deep&quot; showcased Gleason&#x27;s wider vocal abilities. The closing track &quot;Aurora Borealis (In Long Form)&quot; incorporates a string section alongside the loud guitars. Over the course of the near-five minute song, Gleason&#x27;s voice changes from singing to screaming and back again.

==Release==
In August 2002, Further Seems Further went on a tour of Germany. In October and November 2002, the band went on tour across the US alongside New Found Glory, Something Corporate and Finch. &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; was made available for streaming on January 14, 2003, before released through Tooth &amp; Nail Records on February 11. In February and March, the band embarked on a headlining US tour, with support from Elliott, the Early November, the Rise, the Beautiful Mistake, Open Hand, and Twothirtyeight. The music video for &quot;The Sound&quot; was posted on MP4.com on March 10. Following this, they toured with the Ataris and the Juliana Theory on a two-month tour of the US. The band went on The Made Tour, which ran from June to August; they played alongside the Movielife, Autopilot Off, and Anberlin. In September, the band participated in the Take Action Tour. &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; was released in the UK on October 13. Gleason left the band in early 2004, citing that they &quot;spent too much time&quot; together &quot;packed in a box&quot;.

&quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; was pressed on vinyl in 2008 through Tooth &amp; Nail and Broken Circles Records; it was re-pressed by Tooth &amp; Nail and Universal Music Special Markets in 2017. Four of the album&#x27;s tracks – &quot;Pride War&quot;, &quot;Against My Better Judgement&quot;, the title-track and &quot;The Sound&quot; – later appeared on the group&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Hope This Finds You Well&quot; (2006). In 2016, the group went on tour playing &quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; with Gleason.

==Reception==

&quot;How to Start a Fire&quot; would go on to sell over 100,000 by 2013. &quot;Exclaim!&quot; ranked it at number six on their Best Punk Album of the year list. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; included the album at number 11 on their best Christian albums of the year list. &quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot; ranked it at number 18 on their list of the top 100 Tooth &amp; Nail releases.

&quot;Cross Rhythms&quot; writer Tony Cummings said due to the &quot;smouldering vocals&quot; from Gleason, the &quot;exceptional light-and-shade dynamics&quot; from the group, combined with the &quot;inventive arrangements&quot;, it stood as &quot;every bit the equal&quot; to &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot;. &quot;Christianity Today&quot; Andy Argyrakis said it was &quot;a fitting follow-up that presents the band in a tighter, more cohesive environment.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Johnny Loftus said Gleason aided the band in making &quot;a focused and fiery sophomore effort&quot; with &quot;a greater understanding of formula.&quot; &quot;Jesus Freak Hideout&quot; staff member Sherwin Frias said Gleason carried &quot;the same emotional style as his forebear&quot;, which allowed the group &quot;to pick up right where it left off.&quot; The record &quot;has proven itself strong enough to stand apart from its predecessor&#x27;s imposing shadow.&quot; &quot;Post-Bulletin&quot; found Gleason&#x27;s &quot;more mature voice ... a much better fit for the band&#x27;s music than Carrabba&#x27;s whiny squeak.&quot; With the album, the group &quot;took a risk and the result is 10 great songs&quot; with them being &quot;finally poised to make a name with their music, not with their past.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer Kristin Roth said it &quot;burns with incendiary power-pop guitar riffs and smolders with intensely emotive vocals&quot;, with Gleason incorporating &quot;both a harder edge and a softer underbelly to the band&#x27;s sound&quot;.

&quot;musicOMH&quot; contributor Vik Bansal complimented the group&#x27;s &quot;louder&quot; mode, &quot;although these songs definitely rock, they are never overbearingly aggressive&quot;. The group infrequently &quot;over-elaborate with the rhythms and guitar patterns, and every now and again a little more rage would not go amiss.&quot; Stuart Green of &quot;Exclaim!&quot; said that while Gleason lacked Carrabba&#x27;s lyricism, &quot;his contribution to this disc cannot be ignored. His torment and lovelorn angst is sincere and affecting.&quot; He found the tracks &quot;a little less complex&quot; than those on &quot;The Moon Is Down&quot;, &quot;although no less interesting.&quot; In a review for Punknews.org, staff member Scott Heisel asked the question &quot;So how did the band do?&quot; before answering himself with: &quot;Not bad. Not amazing, not great, but not bad.&quot; He elaborated that it was &quot;spotty&quot; with a &quot;feeling of deja vu tends to creep up throughout the album&quot;. &quot;Arizona Daily Wildcat&quot; writer Adam Pugh said the addition of Gleason &quot;changed the whole concept of what the band was&quot; negatively, as they lacked &quot;the intensity of the first album and just sticks with mediocre lyrics and an endless barrage of cry-alongs.&quot; &quot;The Pitch&quot; Geoff Harkness criticized the band for &quot;rely[ing] on paint-by-numbers chord progressions&quot; with &quot;remedial lyrics ... that are scarred from a terminal case of hackney.&quot; He said the group &quot;might be able to overcome the loss of its original singer, but a second record that continues &quot;Fire&quot; trite tradition might as well be titled &quot;How to Extinguish a Career&quot;.&quot;

<text>The London Pavilion is a building on the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and Coventry Street on the north-east side of Piccadilly Circus in London. It is currently a shopping arcade and part of the Trocadero Centre.

==Early history==
The first building bearing the name, a music hall formed from roofing the yard of the Black Horse Inn, was built in 1859 for Emil Loibl, and Charles Sonnhammer. A gallery was constructed for the hall but it could not utilize the full width, because one part of the premises was used by Dr. Kahn&#x27;s &quot;Delectable Museum of Anatomy&quot;.

In 1885, Shaftesbury Avenue was built through part of the site, and a new London Pavilion Theatre was constructed. This opened on 30 November 1885 with a popular revue. The new theatre was the first &#x27;music hall deluxe&#x27;, with marble-topped tables for dining in the auditorium. According to Charles Stuart and A. J. Park in &quot;The Variety Stage&quot; (1895) the rebuilding signaled a new era of variety theatre:Hitherto the halls had borne unmistakable evidence of their origins, but the last vestiges of their old connections were now thrown aside, and they emerged in all the splendour of their new-born glory. The highest efforts of the architect, the designer and the decorator were enlisted in their service, and the gaudy and tawdry music hall of the past gave way to the resplendent &#x27;theatre of varieties&#x27; of the present day, with its classic exterior of marble and freestone, its lavishly appointed auditorium and its elegant and luxurious foyers and promenades brilliantly illuminated by myriad electric lights

==20th century==
The success of the venture led its owner, Villiers, to form a limited company; this became the first combine of music halls, Syndicate Halls Ltd. Lupino Lane made his London début here in 1903, as &quot;Nipper Lane&quot;.

Between 1912 and 1936, the theatre presented a regular programme of musicals; these included Noël Coward&#x27;s first success, &quot;On With the Dance&quot; in April 1925. There were appearances by Sir Harry Lauder; in October 1921, the American actor and vocalist Clifton Webb appeared here in &quot;Fun of the Fayre&quot; and again in October the following year as Phidas in &quot;Phi-Phi&quot;. In 1923, electric billboards were erected for the first time on the side of the building.

In 1934, the building underwent significant structural alteration, and was converted into a cinema at a cost of £70,000 by F. G. M. Chancellor, of Frank Matcham and Co. Intended as London outlet to premiere films released by United Artists, the first film to be screened at the Pavilion was the Alexander Korda release &quot;The Private Life of Don Juan&quot; which was shown from 5 September 1934; Korda had recently signed an agreement with the American company to release his films. For the première of &quot;The Curse of Frankenstein&quot; in May 1957, the foyer was revamped to look like Frankenstein&#x27;s laboratory, complete with the Monster in a tank. In October 1962 it premiered &quot;Dr. No&quot;, the first James Bond film, and in July 1964 was the venue for the premiere of &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The cinema closed on 26 April 1981 and the site remained in limbo for some years.

In 1986, the interior of the building was gutted and converted into a shopping arcade, preserving only the 1885 façade and the outer walls and roof. A wax figure exhibition opened in the building that same year, run by the Madame Tussauds Group, called &quot;Rock Circus&quot;. The exhibition consisted of waxworks of rock and pop musicians. The &quot;Rock Circus&quot; exhibition closed in September 2001.

==Twenty-first century==

In 2000, the building became part of the Trocadero Centre, and signage on the building was altered in 2003 to read London Trocadero. The basement of the building connects with Piccadilly Circus tube station and the rest of the Trocadero Centre.

The London Pavilion housed Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!, a visitor attraction dedicated to the weird and unusual, which was open from August 2008 until 25 September 2017. On 6 October 2018, Body Worlds London opened in the London Pavilion; the exhibition displayed more than 200 real human bodies and organ specimens preserved through the method of Plastination.

<text>The Yukon Legislative Assembly () is the legislative assembly for Yukon, Canada. Unique among Canada&#x27;s three territories, the Yukon Legislative Assembly is the only territorial legislature which is organized along political party lines. In contrast, in Nunavut and the Northwest Territories, their legislative assemblies are elected on a non-partisan basis and operate on a consensus government model.

Each member represents one electoral district, elected through first-past-the-post voting. Members of the Legislative Assembly are sworn in by the commissioner of Yukon.

==History==
From 1900 to 1978, the elected legislative body in Yukon was the Yukon Territorial Council, a body which did not act as the primary government, but was a non-partisan advisory body to the commissioner of the Yukon. Following the passage of the Yukon Elections Act in 1977, the Territorial Council was replaced by the current Legislative Assembly, which was elected for the first time in the 1978 Yukon general election.
