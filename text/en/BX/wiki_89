<text>Experimental physics is the category of disciplines and sub-disciplines in the field of physics that are concerned with the observation of physical phenomena and experiments. Methods vary from discipline to discipline, from simple experiments and observations, such as Galileo&#x27;s experiments, to more complicated ones, such as the Large Hadron Collider.

==Overview==

Experimental physics is a branch of physics that is concerned with data acquisition, data-acquisition methods, and the detailed conceptualization (beyond simple thought experiments) and realization of laboratory experiments. It is often contrasted with theoretical physics, which is more concerned with predicting and explaining the physical behaviour of nature than with acquiring empirical data.

Although experimental and theoretical physics are concerned with different aspects of nature, they both share the same goal of understanding it and have a symbiotic relationship. The former provides data about the universe, which can then be analyzed in order to be understood, while the latter provides explanations for the data and thus offers insight into how to better acquire data and set up experiments. Theoretical physics can also offer insight into what data is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the universe, and into what experiments to devise in order to obtain it.

The tension between experimental and theoretical aspects of physics was expressed by James Clerk Maxwell as &quot;It is not till we attempt to bring the theoretical part of our training into contact with the practical that we begin to experience the full effect of what Faraday has called &#x27;mental inertia&#x27; - not only the difficulty of recognizing, among the concrete objects before us, the abstract relation which we have learned from books, but the distracting pain of wrenching the mind away from the symbols to the objects, and from the objects back to the symbols. This however is the price we have to pay for new ideas.&quot; 
==History==
As a distinct field, experimental physics was established in early modern Europe, during what is known as the Scientific Revolution, by physicists such as Galileo Galilei, Christiaan Huygens, Johannes Kepler, Blaise Pascal and Sir Isaac Newton. In the early 17th century, Galileo made extensive use of experimentation to validate physical theories, which is the key idea in the modern scientific method. Galileo formulated and successfully tested several results in dynamics, in particular the law of inertia, which later became the first law in Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. In Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;, a dialogue between the characters Simplicio and Salviati discuss the motion of a ship (as a moving frame) and how that ship&#x27;s cargo is indifferent to its motion. Huygens used the motion of a boat along a Dutch canal to illustrate an early form of the conservation of momentum.

Experimental physics is considered to have reached a high point with the publication of the &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; in 1687 by Sir Isaac Newton (1643–1727). In 1687, Newton published the &quot;Principia&quot;, detailing two comprehensive and successful physical laws: Newton&#x27;s laws of motion, from which arise classical mechanics; and Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, which describes the fundamental force of gravity. Both laws agreed well with experiment. The &quot;Principia&quot; also included several theories in fluid dynamics.

From the late 17th century onward, thermodynamics was developed by physicist and chemist Robert Boyle, Thomas Young, and many others. In 1733, Daniel Bernoulli used statistical arguments with classical mechanics to derive thermodynamic results, initiating the field of statistical mechanics. In 1798, Benjamin Thompson (Count Rumford) demonstrated the conversion of mechanical work into heat, and in 1847 James Prescott Joule stated the law of conservation of energy, in the form of heat as well as mechanical energy. Ludwig Boltzmann, in the nineteenth century, is responsible for the modern form of statistical mechanics.

Besides classical mechanics and thermodynamics, another great field of experimental inquiry within physics was the nature of electricity. Observations in the 17th and eighteenth century by scientists such as Boyle, Stephen Gray, and Benjamin Franklin created a foundation for later work. These observations also established our basic understanding of electrical charge and current. By 1808 John Dalton had discovered that atoms of different elements have different weights and proposed the modern theory of the atom.

It was Hans Christian Ørsted who first proposed the connection between electricity and magnetism after observing the deflection of a compass needle by a nearby electric current. By the early 1830s Michael Faraday had demonstrated that magnetic fields and electricity could generate each other. In 1864 James Clerk Maxwell presented to the Royal Society a set of equations that described this relationship between electricity and magnetism. Maxwell&#x27;s equations also predicted correctly that light is an electromagnetic wave. Starting with astronomy, the principles of natural philosophy crystallized into fundamental laws of physics which were enunciated and improved in the succeeding centuries. By the 19th century, the sciences had segmented into multiple fields with specialized researchers and the field of physics, although logically pre-eminent, no longer could claim sole ownership of the entire field of scientific research.

==Current experiments==

Some examples of prominent experimental physics projects are:

* Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider which collides heavy ions such as gold ions (it is the first heavy ion collider) and protons, it is located at Brookhaven National Laboratory, on Long Island, USA.
* HERA, which collides electrons or positrons and protons, and is part of DESY, located in Hamburg, Germany.
* LHC, or the Large Hadron Collider, which completed construction in 2008 but suffered a series of setbacks. The LHC began operations in 2008, but was shut down for maintenance until the summer of 2009. It is the world&#x27;s most energetic collider upon completion, it is located at CERN, on the French-Swiss border near Geneva. The collider became fully operational March 29, 2010 a year and a half later than originally planned.
* LIGO, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, is a large-scale physics experiment and observatory to detect cosmic gravitational waves and to develop gravitational-wave observations as an astronomical tool. Currently two LIGO observatories exist: LIGO Livingston Observatory in Livingston, Louisiana, and LIGO Hanford Observatory near Richland, Washington.
* JWST, or the James Webb Space Telescope, launched in 2021. It will be the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope. It will survey the sky in the infrared region. The main goals of the JWST will be in order to understand the initial stages of the universe, galaxy formation as well as the formations of stars and planets, and the origins of life.
* Mississippi State Axion Search (2016 completion), Light Shining Through a Wall Experiment (LSW); EM Source: .7m, 50W continuous radio wave emitter

==Method==

Experimental physics uses two main methods of experimental research, controlled experiments, and natural experiments. Controlled experiments are often used in laboratories as laboratories can offer a controlled environment. Natural experiments are used, for example, in astrophysics when observing celestial objects where control of the variables in effect is impossible.

<doc id="685313" wikidata="Q608594" url="?curid=685313" title="DYS (band)">
<text>DYS is an American straight edge hardcore punk band from Boston, Massachusetts, who were part of the &quot;Boston Crew&quot; in the 1980s, along with contemporaries such as SSD and Negative FX. The group later expanded their sound, becoming one of the first hardcore bands to veer into heavy metal.

==History==
===Formation ===
DYS was founded in the 1980s by singer Dave Smalley and bassist Jonathan Anastas. At the time, Smalley was a freshman at Boston College, while Anastas - at age 15 - had previously founded the short-lived band Decadence, whose song &quot;Slam&quot; was featured on the &quot;This Is Boston, Not LA&quot; compilation, and later adopted for a long-running MTV advertising campaign titled &quot;Santa, the Man, the Myth, the Slam Dancer.&quot;

DYS took its name from the Department of Youth Services, a Massachusetts governmental organization where delinquent youth were housed, as well as the Alice Cooper teen power anthem &quot;Department of Youth.&quot; Smalley and Anastas were joined by guitarist Andy Strachan and drummer Dave Collins. The band released their debut album &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, produced by punk recording legend Lou Giordano. They added lead guitar player Ross Luongo and released their second self-titled album, &quot;DYS&quot;, which took them in a metal direction and included the first power ballad ever attempted by a hardcore band. During their metal period, live sound was handled by noted hard rock producer Andrew Murdock, who works under the professional name &quot;Mudrock” and ex-SS Decontrol drummer Chris Foley performed with the band, including their final show, a showcase for Elektra Records A&amp;R executive Michael Alago, who was feted in a 2017 bio pic.

===Initial Breakup===
After DYS broke up, Anastas became a founding member of Slapshot. Dave Smalley went on to sing for Dag Nasty, ALL and Down By Law, before founding Don&#x27;t Sleep. Strachan co-founded the more rock-focused band Slaughter Shack, winning the Rumble music contest. Ross Luongo went on to play guitar for the reformed Jerry&#x27;s Kids. Both of DYS&#x27;s 1980s albums were re-issued together on CD and in digital formats by Taang! Records (titled &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;). &quot;Brotherhood&quot; has periodically reissued on CD, vinyl and digital formats with and without the addition of the &quot;Wolfpack&quot; demo tape, featuring Hüsker Dü singing back-up vocals. An anniversary re-release with Bridge9 Records was issued in January 2024.

===Reformation===
On August 29, 2010, DYS headlined the Gallery East reunion show in front of over 1,000 fans, along with fellow Boston hardcore punk pioneers Jerry&#x27;s Kids, Gang Green and The F.U.&#x27;s, Slapshot as well as New York City&#x27;s Antidote. The reunion line-up included an additional guitar player, Bobby Frankenheim (Ex-Deathwish), and drummer Jack Clark of Jerry&#x27;s Kids and Unnatural Axe. The show was recorded for the movie &quot;xxx ALL AGES xxx&quot;, a documentary about the hardcore punk scene in Boston in the 1980s. A live album of the performance was released on August 9, 2011, on Bridge 9 Records as &quot;More than Fashion: LIVE from the Gallery East Reunion&quot; on vinyl and digital formats.

After that show, and facing interest from promoters to continue the reunion shows, Smalley and Anastas recruited a new west coast-based &quot;all star&quot; line-up featuring ex-Foo Fighters and current Scream guitarist Franz Stahl, ex-Powerman 5000 drummer Al Pahanish Jr., and guitarist Adam Porris, who played in Far From Finished. They played the 2010 &quot;Hometown Throwdown&quot; at the House of Blues in Boston, in support of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and again at the same venue in support of the Dropkick Murphys&#x27; annual St. Patrick&#x27;s Day stand in 2012. The band also completed 2011 and 2012 recording sessions with their old soundman, Andrew &quot;Mudrock&quot; Murdock, in Los Angeles. Recordings from these sessions were released as digital singles from Fall 2011 through to Fall 2012 on Bridge 9, the first being &quot;Wild Card,&quot; released November 8, 2011, followed by &quot;Sound of our Town&quot; featuring Dicky Barrett of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones on guest vocals, released December 13, 2011, &quot;Unloaded&quot;, released January 24, 2012, a cover of Motörhead&#x27;s &quot;(We Are The) Road Crew&quot; in February 2012, a re-make of &quot;Brotherhood&quot; (Brotherhood 2012) in July 2012 and &quot;True Believers&quot; in October 2012.

This line-up of DYS played 50+ live shows in the US and Europe between 2010 and 2017. Major festival dates included the 2011 Rumble Fest in Chicago, the 2011 Sound and Fury Fest in Santa Barbara, the 2012 Black n&#x27; Blue Bowl, the 2012 SXSW Festival, the 2012 Groezrock Festival, the 2012 My Fest in Berlin, the 2012 Tsunami East Fest, the 2014 Southeast Beast Fest, the 2014 EIPER Fest and the 2017 Resurrection fest in Spain. DYS announced a summer 2020 run of European festivals and club shows that was cancelled due to COVID-19.

The 2024 Bridge9 Records anniversary re-release of &quot;Brotherhood&quot; sold out the first pressing in pre-orders and peaked at #9 on the Cortex Records sale charts, appearing on the legendary German punk rock record store&#x27;s influential charts for three weeks.

<text>Juliusz Paweł Schauder (; 21 September 1899 – September 1943) was a Polish mathematician known for his work in functional analysis, partial differential equations and mathematical physics.

==Life and career==
Born on 21 September 1899 in Lwów to a lawyer father of Jewish descent, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army right after his graduation from school and saw action on the Italian front. He was captured and imprisoned in Italy. He entered the university in Lwów in 1919 and received his doctorate in 1923. He got no appointment at the university and continued his research while working as teacher at a secondary school. Due to his outstanding results, he obtained a scholarship in 1932 that allowed him to spend several years in Leipzig and, especially, Paris. In Paris he started a very successful collaboration with Jean Leray. Around 1935 Schauder obtained the position of a senior assistant in the University of Lwów. Schauder, along with Stanisław Mazur, was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1936 in Oslo.

Schauder was Jewish, and after the invasion of German troops in Lwów 1941 it was impossible for him to continue his work. Even before the Lwów ghetto was established he wrote to Ludwig Bieberbach pleading for his support. Instead, Bieberbach passed his letter to the Gestapo and Schauder was arrested. In his letters to Swiss mathematicians, he wrote that he had important new results, but no paper to write them down. He was executed by the Gestapo, probably in October 1943.

Most of his mathematical work is in the field of functional analysis, being part of a large Polish group of mathematicians, i.e. the Lwów School of Mathematics. They were pioneers in this area with wide applications in all parts of modern analysis. Schauder is best known for the Schauder fixed-point theorem, which is a major tool to prove the existence of solutions in various problems, the Schauder bases (a generalization of an orthonormal basis from Hilbert spaces to Banach spaces), and the Leray−Schauder principle, a way to establish solutions of partial differential equations from a priori estimates.

==In memoriam==
The Schauder Medal is awarded by the J.P. Schauder Center for Nonlinear Studies at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, Poland, to individuals for their significant achievements related to topological methods in nonlinear analysis.

<text>Uniform Choice (formerly known as Moral Sin) was an American hardcore punk band from Orange County, California.

== History ==

Uniform Choice was started by guitarist Myke Bates, bassist Hanson Meyer and drummer Eric Hanna during the spring of 1982 in Newport Beach, California. Bates had been playing with a couple of bands previously in Palm Springs and his band, Funeral Information, had played early punk shows with SIN 34 and Black Flag. He is also credited for writing the song &quot;Rodney On The ROQ&quot; for KROQ-FM DJ Rodney Bingenheimer, which was performed by Target 13 and appeared on the compilation album &quot;Rodney on the ROQ, Vol 2&quot; under the independent record label Posh Boy Records.

Bates left his skateboard shop, Bates Skates, behind in Palm Springs and moved to Newport Beach. He looked to start a new band in Orange County and found Meyer and Hanna who were playing with guitarist Dave Marriott (Hollywood Hate, The Lowdowns, The NightCrawlers) and singer Scott Brandon in a local punk band called Moral Sin. Bates had originally joined the lineup of Moral Sin as a second guitarist but soon after, Scott Brandon left the group leaving it without a singer. Bates then moved into the dual role of guitarist/singer and suggested the group change its name to Uniform Choice with the explanation that it represented our right to do whatever we wanted to do.

After about two months, Marriott left the group to pursue other endeavors and the remaining members pressed forward as a power trio. Meyer and Bates wrote a number of songs together over the course of the next two years including &quot;War is Here&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Take the Car You&#x27;ll Kill Yourself&quot;. After the punk club Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest (nightclub) closed down, there were limited clubs for the band to play in the Orange County area. Not too long after the closure of the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest, the club reopened as &quot;The Concert Factory&quot; and it was there that Uniform Choice played most of their early shows in late 1982. Bates played guitar and sang lead vocals in the beginning until the group landed on lead singer Elliott Colla, a former classmate of Meyer and Hanna&#x27;s from Corona Del Mar High School. The band experimented with other singers before Colla. Newport Beach local Eric Whittick sang for a short while. And later in the tradition of X-Ray Spex, 14-year-old Jennifer Harper fronted the band for a short time along with second guitar player Eric VonArab (Love Canal).

The band made its first studio demo in September 1982 (Orange Peel Sessions) with Colla heading up vocals. The recordings were engineered and produced by Tom Springston (Tom Tom) of Burnt Party Host and were recorded in Corona Del Mar, California. In 1983, the band experimented with an additional second lead bass player, Brent Turner. Turner only played several shows with the band and left the group to record the album When in Rome Do as the Vandals with The Vandals. Over the course of the first two years the group performed with other established punk acts such as Black Flag, SIN 34, Circle Jerks, Channel 3, Shattered Faith, Bad Religion, Circle One and Angry Samoans.

In early 1983, Hanna and Meyer decided to leave the band, and Bates enlisted an entire new lineup which would be fronted by Pat Dubar and drums being played by Hanna&#x27;s friend and classmate Pat Dyson (who had played with Plain Wrap in 1983), and Bass being played by John Lorey, and Guitar by Vic Maynez. Meyer went on to play with other groups such as the Finks and Peace Corp., while Bates left the group later in 1983 to pursue other endeavors in Hollywood, California. Dyson and Dubar tried to re-recruit Eric VonArab to rejoin this new rendition of the band.

The group with this final lineup of Pat Dubar, Pat Dyson, Vic Maynez and David Mello went forward with a new vision as Uniform Choice and continued to record and create what was considered the first O.C. Straight Edge Demos. The group gained momentum nationally while performing throughout California and beyond bringing the group to their current level of recognition in the Southern California punk subculture.

&quot;Screaming for Change&quot; is their most acclaimed album. They also recorded another less well received LP called &quot;Staring into the Sun&quot; and their demo has been bootlegged several times. Pat Dubar was a graduate of Pepperdine University and created the label Wishingwell Records, which released albums by Unity, Uniform Choice, Blast, and Youth of Today, among others. Uniform Choice is historically among the first five Straight Edge Hardcore bands to emerge from Southern California.

<text>Monasternagalliaghduff () also called the Abbey of St Catherine de O&#x27;Conyl or simply Old Abbey, is a ruined Augustinian abbey in County Limerick in Ireland.

==Location==
The abbey lies in a small valley about two miles east of the village of Shanagolden, in the townland of Oldabbey (named after it), which is in the civil parish of Robertstown and barony of Shanid (formerly part of the barony of Connello or O&#x27;Conyl).

==History==
One of the earliest recorded nunneries in Ireland, it is first mentioned in 1298, and was founded on land donated by John FitzThomas of Connello (who died in 1261). While there are few details, it appears in court and land records over the succeeding centuries, and at Dissolution of the Monasteries during the Reformation in Ireland, in 1541, a valuation is given. Further records of leases, conveyances and other land transactions are found for its ruins and lands.

==Architecture==
Remains include the abbey church to the east of the cloister, with two small spaces adjacent - one of which is now known as the &quot;Black Hag&#x27;s Cell&quot; but which appears to have been a sacristy - a refectory to the south, and a vaulted building to the west. From the refectory a later building projects south towards a stream; it may have been a kitchen. There are also walls and a gate, and traces of an orchard, a fish pond and a pigeon house. The church and cloister walls were assessed as being of similar age, and their windows dated to the 13th century. Modifications to the church in the 15th century saw the inclusion of an east window in the church as well as a doorway in the north. Traces of window decoration, columns, a piscina and a carved tombstone remain.

Burials were also located, and the church plate was reportedly found in the late eighteenth century.

==Folklore==
Some legends relating to the abbey include:
* Prior to the dissolution it was said that the nunnery had been dissolved by the Pope as the last abbess practised witchcraft in a room to the south of the church which is now called &#x27;The Black Hag&#x27;s Cell&#x27;. This legend was probably propaganda in furtherance of the dissolution. Wardell suggests the legend might have arisen if a nun remained after the dissolution, and that later people may have misunderstood &quot;cailleach dhubh&quot; (archaic for &quot;nun&quot;) as &quot;black hag&quot;.
* During a feud between the Earl of Desmond and the Butlers, the Desmonds were fleeing the nunnery when the Countess was wounded by an arrow. The Earl, believing her dead, hastily interred her under the church altar; but she had been buried alive, and her screams are said to echo through the ruins to this day.

<text>A sports league is a group of individual athletes, sports teams or clubs who form a league to compete against each other and gain points in a specific sport. At its simplest, it may be a local group of amateur athletes who form teams among themselves and compete periodically, at its most complex, it can be an international professional league making large amounts of money and involving dozens of teams and thousands of players.

==Terminology==

===Misuse of term===
Many uses of the term league in sports and for sports organizations are misnomers as the term league relates specifically to the form of organization, requiring persons or bodies to be in league together. A sport competition owned and controlled other than by its participant players, teams or clubs is not a league.

===Synonyms===
In many cases, organizations that function as leagues are described using a different term, such as association, conference, division, leaderboard, or series. This is especially common in individual sports, although the term &quot;league&quot; is sometimes used in amateur individual sports such as golf.

The term &quot;league&quot; is also sometimes applicable to competitions that would more traditionally be called tournaments, such as the UEFA Champions League, which is organized with multiple small round-robin competitions followed by a single elimination tournament to choose an overall winner.

===Leagues and league systems===
&quot;League&quot; and its synonyms may be used to encompass either a single competition or a related group of competitions.

Many groups use promotion and relegation, where the best-ranked team(s) in the &quot;lower division&quot; are &quot;promoted&quot; to the &quot;higher division&quot; for the next season, and the worst-ranked team(s) in the &quot;higher division&quot; are &quot;relegated&quot; to the &quot;lower division&quot; for the next season. Under this system, &quot;league&quot; may refer both to a league system, a group of leagues that are tied together in a hierarchical fashion by promotion and relegation, and to the individual leagues within the league system. For example, in English association football, the English Football League (EFL) is a league system, while the term &quot;National League&quot; refers both to the league immediately below the EFL in the English pyramid and to its associated league system.

An alternate system of league organization which is used primarily in Australia, Canada, and the United States is a closed model which always has the same teams playing, with occasional admission of expansion teams and relocation of existing teams. There is no team movement between the higher &quot;major league&quot; and the lower &quot;minor leagues&quot;.

In many of these closed-model leagues in Canada and the United States, they are divided into subdivisions on historical or geographical lines. These may be referred to as &quot;conferences&quot; or &quot;divisions&quot;. For example, the National Football League (NFL) is divided into the National Football Conference and American Football Conference; the latter conference was formed largely from the remnants of the American Football League after it merged with the NFL, though it now contains three original NFL teams and three expansion teams. Both the National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Hockey League (NHL) are divided into Eastern and Western Conferences. The conferences in the NFL, NBA, and NHL are further divided into subsets, all of which are called &quot;divisions&quot;. These are geographically based, and teams play their divisional opponents more than any others, and then play the other clubs in their conference more than their non-conference opponents.

Baseball has a unique nomenclature, with &quot;Major League Baseball&quot; (MLB) the name of the overall grouping of 30 teams in two &quot;major leagues&quot;, the American League (AL) and the older National League (NL). They are titled leagues rather than conferences for several reasons. The National League predates the American by 25 years and was considered a &quot;major&quot; league in comparison to its early competitors, and in a sense it simply extended this recognition to the AL, the only league of similar financial clout. In addition, the leagues played no interlocking schedule of any kind until 1995, and then added only a small amount of interleague play, with the main AL-NL competition occurring between their champions in the World Series. Thus the two leagues played mostly separate competitions within the larger framework of MLB. Finally, until 2000, they were actually separate legal entities, unlike the conferences of other leagues. Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan has a similar history, with the Central League and Pacific League not founded together.

Due to this naming custom, it is common to use slightly different terms to discuss MLB. Where someone might refer to &quot;the best quarterback in the league&quot; and be understood to mean the overall NFL, a similar mention of &quot;the best outfielder in the league&quot; is almost always a reference to the American National League, while &quot;in all of baseball&quot; or similar is used to denote the larger status. Each of the major leagues also has its own set of awards to recognize the separation between the two, which means there are two MVPs, two Cy Young Award winners, etc. Since its name is constructed differently—a description of the status of two leagues rather than the title of one—it is common to hear &quot;MLB&quot; without &quot;the&quot; attached to it, as in &quot;the most home runs in MLB this year&quot;, since one would not say &quot;the Major League Baseball&quot;.

==League organization==
All sports leagues operate under a structured format designed to facilitate organized competition among teams or individual athletes. This structure typically involves a predetermined schedule, commonly referred to as a season, where participants face each other in a nonrandom, systematic order. Each competition or match within the season contributes to a broader framework of results, which are meticulously recorded and analyzed. These results play a crucial role in ranking the participants, ultimately leading to the selection or determination of an overall champion. The championship process may involve additional stages, such as playoffs or finals, depending on the league&#x27;s specific rules and format. This structured approach not only ensures fairness and consistency but also fosters a sense of progression and anticipation, as fans and participants alike follow the season&#x27;s developments and track the performance of their favorite teams or athletes.

A league championship may be contested in a number of ways. Each team may play every other team a certain number of times in a round-robin tournament. Usually, teams play an equal number of games or matches at their own stadium and at other teams&#x27;, because home advantage is a major factor in many sports. When teams competing for a tournament championship do not play the same teams the same number of times, it is known as an unbalanced schedule.

In such a set-up, the team with the best record becomes champion, based on either a strict win–loss–tie system or on a points system where a certain number of points are awarded for a win, loss, or tie, while bonus points might also be added for teams meeting various criteria. Many leagues also use playoffs, where after teams compete in a regular season in a league format, the top teams (possibly determined by conference or division) advance to the playoffs. In some such leagues having the best regular season record is relatively unimportant, though top-seeded teams in some leagues, such as the NFL, can gain byes to later rounds of the playoffs, and teams finishing with the best records usually have the advantage of playing the weakest teams that have advanced to the playoffs.

==Alternatives to traditional league organization==
While round-robin and modified round-robin competitions are the most common form of league organization, there are a number of ways to organize a sporting competition, almost all of which may be described as a &quot;league&quot;. Many sports organizations fall on a continuum between a total lack of organization, as in a pick-up game, and a formal league such as is common at the highest level of professional team sports.

===Non-league sports===
The simplest form of competition is to allow teams to play each other whenever they see fit. In some sports, such as horse racing, the main goal of the entrants is to win individual purses, and there is little or no ranking or competition outside winning certain major races. A small amount of league organization may be imposed on these non-league sports by way of a series or tournament tying several individual events together, such as the Triple Crown.

Even in team sports that normally use a traditional league format, some teams often exist outside any league; these teams are generally known as barnstorming teams and either schedule games against local professional or amateur competition or bring their own competition, such as the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters did when they toured with the Washington Generals. As with the Globetrotters, barnstorming teams sometimes emphasize spectacle over athletic competition.

In Europe, the term &quot;cup competition&quot; is used to describe single elimination or knock-out tournaments, where the pairing of teams in each round is determined by a &quot;draw&quot; (see for example, the FA Cup in England), to distinguish it from league competition, in which every club in the league or division plays the other teams a pre-determined number of times in a season, usually on a home and away basis.

Further, in England, the term non-league football is used for historical reasons to describe association football teams that play in organized leagues, but not in the English Football League or Premier League, the two highest levels of competition in that sport in that country.

Independent baseball is used similarly in the United States to describe baseball teams that play in leagues other than those sanctioned by Major League Baseball. These teams do play in leagues and should not be confused with barnstorming teams that play truly non-league schedules.

===Rankings and leaderboards===
Individual sports often use an alternative type of league organization where competitors are ranked against each other. In the simplest cases, such as boxing, the rankings mean little and the major competition is to crown a champion in a title fight.

In other sports, the rankings and leaderboards gain importance when they are used in seeding tournaments.

In some sports, points are assigned to results at individual competitions, and the resulting points are used to generate a season rankings and determine the season champion. While not usually referred to as &quot;leagues&quot;, but &quot;tours&quot; or &quot;series&quot;, these season-long competitions with set events are very similar to league structures in team sports. Examples of this are motorsport, tennis, golf, skiing, beach volleyball and rugby sevens.

===Conferences and informal leagues===
American college sports are traditionally organized into groups of teams known as &quot;conferences&quot;. These conferences ordinarily keep league tables and crown champions within the conference, as other sports leagues do, but the individual schools also schedule a certain number of &quot;non-conference&quot; games that are organized independently between two schools in different conferences, or between a conference team and a non-conference team. Also, national championships in some college sports are determined by a ranking or playoff system that is independent of the individual conferences.

==Round-robin sports leagues==
Most major team sports play some form of round-robin schedule, where the goal is for each team to play a relatively balanced schedule with each other team in the league or in its league subdivision. Within this structure, there are a few significant differences between leagues, a few of which are set forth below.

===Single-table versus unbalanced schedule===
The simplest way to organize a sports league, and still one of the most common, is in a double round-robin format where each team plays each other team twice, once at home and once away. This ensures that every team plays an equally difficult schedule and that no team has undue home field advantage. This organization is still used in many team sports around the world.

One potential drawback of this simple double round-robin format is that the number of teams in the league determines the schedule. Larger leagues may not be able to play as many games as such a system would require, and smaller leagues may want more games. In addition, leagues whose teams are geographically spread out over a wide area (a common situation for leagues in North America) may face significant travel costs. One solution is to play an unbalanced schedule, with some teams playing additional games against some other teams; this is the way Major League Soccer has traditionally been scheduled, with the additional games being played against local rivals. Some leagues also break the league into subunits, often known as &quot;divisions&quot; and &quot;conferences&quot;, each of which may itself play a balanced or unbalanced schedule.

===Central venue leagues===
A &quot;central venue league&quot; (CVL) is a sports league where all the fixtures take place at the same venue, instead of rotating around the venues of the &#x27;home&#x27; team, for each fixture. Several UK basketball leagues operate on this basis, intended to keep the costs of participation as low as possible, including:

*Bracknell Central Venue League
*Bucks Central Venue League
*Community Basketball League (London) 
*Knights Central Venue League (Surrey Basketball Association)
*Newcastle Eagles Central Venue League, established in 2002 
*Sherwood Basketball League

===Cups, tournaments, and playoffs===
Many sports leagues also participate in a single-elimination tournament each year. In the United States, Mexico, and some other countries, these tournaments are commonly called &quot;playoffs&quot; and are played at the end of the season, with the teams qualifying for the playoffs based on their performance during the season. In Europe, &quot;cup&quot; competitions are more common, with all teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that takes place during and parallel with the regular season.

<doc id="685330" wikidata="Q356225" url="?curid=685330" title="Stereobelt">
<text>The Stereobelt was a personal stereo player devised by Andreas Pavel, a former television executive and book editor. Pavel filed a patent of invention for his portable music player in Italy in 1977, and adopted the same protective steps in Germany, United Kingdom, United States, and Japan. He sought royalty fees and later commenced legal proceedings against Sony Corporation after the Walkman released commercially in 1979, believing the electronics manufacturer had infringed his intellectual property. Judges ruled against him, revoking the patent, stating his concept was &quot;not significantly inventive&quot;.

==Background and history==

A former television executive and book editor, Pavel devised the Stereobelt to allow the wearer to play high-fidelity music through headphones while participating in daily activities. He states the initial test of prototype hardware took place in February 1972 in St. Moritz, Switzerland. After he pushed the play button to start the song Push Push by Herbie Mann and Duane Allman, he experienced a &quot;floating&quot; sensation as he watched the mountain snow fall, realizing that his device could provide &quot;the means to multiply the aesthetic potential of any situation.&quot;

Following initial tests of his unit, Pavel told &quot;The New York times&quot; that he approached electronics manufacturers such as ITT, Grundig, Yamaha and Philips with his idea, but said he was met with rejection and ridicule. &quot;They all said they didn&#x27;t think people would be so crazy as to run around with headphones, that this is just a gadget, a useless gadget of a crazy nut&quot;. No less deterred and learning that it was important to protect his idea, Pavel filed a patent for the Stereobelt in Millan, Italy in 1977, followed by applications in Germany and the United Kingdom in 1978, later the United States and Japan.

==Legal battle==

Sony began selling their Walkman personal stereo player in 1979. The prototype Walkman was a playback only adaptation of the existing Sony Pressman, a compact cassette recorder and portable audio player for journalists released in 1978. In negotiations that began in 1980 and ended in 1986, Sony agreed to pay Pavel limited royalties for the sales of certain Walkman models sold in his home country of Germany only (about DM 150,000, almost 1% of Sony&#x27;s Walkman profit in Germany).

A second round of legal battles between Pavel and Sony that began in 1990 through the England and Wales Patents County Court ended in 1996 after Judges ruled in Sony&#x27;s favour, leaving Pavel to pay almost 3 million euros ($3.68 million) in court costs. Sony contended the Walkman evolved from a succession of portable mono and stereo cassette recorders spanning over a decade, starting with the TC-50 in 1968, illustrated in court with chronological charts. They never sought to file patents on the Walkman, its legal team argued, because the technology was innovative but not wholly inventive, rendering any such filing invalid. Counsel representing Sony and Toshiba, who also appeared in opposition, further argued that Pavel&#x27;s idea consisted of multiple components, namely a belt-like garment that housed an amplifier and battery pack separately, and lacked a stability mechanism to counter movement. Pavel&#x27;s legal representatives countered that, although the patent describes a stereo system in conjunction with a belt, &quot;his claim covers all personal stereos&quot; and Sony&#x27;s own charts appeared to show their personal audio equipment getting larger with time, not smaller or more refined.

Pavel&#x27;s legal challenge was lost in 1993 and his patent revoked. Judge Peter Ford adjudicated the patent to be invalid because the technology was &quot;obvious and not significantly inventive&quot;. The case proceeded to the Appeals Court where Pavel lost again in 1996. The Court of Appeal reexamined a range of prior art and considered testimony from new witnesses. Various brand models were the subject of dispute, including stereophonic cassette players and radios that supported headphone use; some with small carry handles, others belt clips or shoulder straps. Pavel&#x27;s team argued that &quot;a belt in the form of a shoulder strap was not for personal wear.&quot; It was submitted that if their client&#x27;s invention was obvious, as held by the original Judge, such an idea would have been patented sooner. It was the &quot;concept&quot; of a personal stereo player that &quot;changed the listening habits of the world&quot;, not the overall product design, which Pavel&#x27;s team described as &quot;window dressing&quot;; a contention borne out by the &quot;explosive success&quot; of the Walkman. Lord Justice John Hobhouse, Lord Justice Brian Neill, and Lord Justice William Aldous disagreed with the appellant, adducing the Walkman&#x27;s form factor, minimal operating power, and ability to reproduce high-quality sound at reasonable cost as key reasons for its appeal and popularity. &quot;Although the Walkman was a great commercial success, the attempt to rely upon that success to support invention is fallacious&quot;.

The ruling was foreshadowed by &quot;New Scientist&quot; shortly after the British patent was granted to Pavel in 1982. Claiming a &quot;monopoly&quot; on personal stereo equipment, the magazine cautioned that his application might prove too broad and of no practical legal value. &quot;Sony&#x27;s breakthrough with Walkman was in the players high quality reproduction, low powered consumption and the tape drives ability to run smoothly, even when the wearer runs.&quot; Details for which, the magazine noted, were absent in Pavel&#x27;s patent.

Finally in 2003, with Pavel threatening to file infringement proceedings in the remaining territories where he held protective rights, Sony approached him with a view to settling the matter amicably, which led to both parties signing a contract and confidentiality agreement in 2004. The settlement was reported to be a cash payment in the &quot;low eight figures&quot; and ongoing royalties of the sale of certain Walkman models. After signing the agreement, Pavel told &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; he planned to approach other portable audio manufacturers such as Apple Inc. over their digital iPod media player.

<text>The Kids Will Have Their Say is the debut album by the Boston hardcore punk band SS Decontrol. The album was released in 1982 as a split-release between Dischord and X-Claim records (catalog numbers X-Claim 1/Dischord 7½). Only 1,900 copies were pressed and the album was not repressed or reissued officially until 2023. A bootleg version was made in the late 1980s, but the label names on the back of the sleeves are switched to &quot;Discord&quot; and &quot;Ex-Claim&quot;, making it easy to differentiate from the original pressing.

==Reception==
Writing in &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;, Joyce Millman called the album &quot;a stupefying barrage indistinguishable from dozens of other hardcore LPs. Seventeen tracks tumble into each other, with vocals so rushed and garbled they could be one long harangue; and one number, &#x27;How Much Art Can You Take?&#x27; is a parody of highbrow punk and a hymn to inarticulation.&quot; Millman felt that &quot;The utility of &quot;The Kids Will Have Their Say&quot; lies in the lyric sheet, a manifesto by and for Boston’s bored, scared, fed-up, and pissed-off teenagers.&quot;

<text>Ray Cappo, also known as Raghunath Das, is an American punk rock musician best known as the vocalist for the bands Youth of Today and Shelter and as founder of the independent record labels Revelation Records and Equal Vision Records.

Originally from Connecticut, Cappo played drums for the band Violent Children. Before moving to New York City in the 1980s, Youth of Today had already made an impact on the straight edge hardcore punk scene.

==Career==
===Earlier career===

Cappo was occasionally a guest DJ for college radio station WXCI, in Danbury, Connecticut, on a radio show called &quot;The Adventure Jukebox&quot; hosted by Darryl Ohrt of the band No Milk on Tuesday. Cappo played a wide array of hardcore music on the program, largely culled from his massive collection of records, rare unsigned EPs, and demo tapes. During this time, Cappo enthusiastically supported local hardcore shows including gigs by many early hardcore bands such as No Milk on Tuesday, 76% Uncertain, Seizure, End Product, and Abusive Action, and was often mentioned in the liner notes of their records.

===Youth of Today===

Along with guitarist John Porcelly, also known as Porcell, Cappo started the seminal hardcore band Youth of Today in 1985, which quickly became one of the most well-known bands in the New York hardcore scene. Based on their straight edge ethics and a fast, aggressive sound, they created a subgenre known as Youth Crew, influencing a large number of bands. An important figure in the early days of Youth of Today was Kevin Seconds, singer of the Reno, Nevada, band 7 Seconds. Kevin not only influenced the band, but also released their first EP, &quot;Can&#x27;t Close My Eyes&quot; on his Positive Force Records. Before disbanding in 1990, Youth of Today released two 7-inch EPs (one later remixed and released as a 12-inch) and two LPs, widely considered to be some of the most influential American hardcore records of their time.

===Revelation Records===

In 1987, along with Jordan Cooper, Cappo started Revelation Records. The label&#x27;s first release was Warzone&#x27;s &quot;Lower East Side Crew&quot;. This was soon followed by a compilation entitled New York Hardcore 1987: Together, or simply the Together Compilation. This compilation included tracks by Youth of Today and Bold, (formerly Crippled Youth). This was also the first time bands like Gorilla Biscuits, Sick of It All, and Side by Side would be recorded and heard all over the world. Revelation would soon expand its roster westward, releasing records from California bands like Chain of Strength and No For an Answer. Today, Revelation remains a functioning record label operated by Cooper, who moved from New Haven, Connecticut, to Huntington Beach, California, in 1990.

===1990s and Krishnacore===
As Youth of Today began to wind down, Cappo found himself drawn to Krishna Consciousness, due in large part to his study of religions that embraced his vegetarian and straight edge ideals. He became a devotee and an outspoken proponent of the ideologies laid out in the Bhagavad Gita. Cappo resolved to create a final album to express his beliefs. The album was a marked departure from the style of Youth of Today, and Revelation Records decided to release it under a new band, which became known as Shelter. Cappo again found himself starting a record label to release bands with a Krishna-conscious message, the still operating Equal Vision Records. The rise of Shelter would unexpectedly create a musical subgenre called Krishnacore, with bands such as Cro-Mags as its spiritual forefathers and 108 among its main proponents.

=== Better Than a Thousand ===
Better Than a Thousand was a band founded in 1997 by drummer Ken Olden and guitarist Graham Land after their previous band Battery broke up. The duo recruited Cappo as their vocalist and signed to Revelation Records. They recorded their first album, &quot;Just One&quot;, in five days while Shelter was on break from touring, and released it in July 1997. Cappo recorded his vocals for the album in a bedroom studio in two days. They got to work immediately on their second album, with Olden saying they needed to follow up &quot;Just One&quot; with something more focused. That second album, &quot;Value Driven&quot;, was recorded in another home studio setup in 1998, and released that year. They toured for the album, then broke up after Cappo moved to California and quit his straight-edge lifestyle. In 2020, Olden remixed and remastered both albums for a reissue package released by End Hits Records. The reissues included the original albums and five rare bonus songs, and some editions included a 36-page fanzine called &quot;We Must Believe&quot;, previously unpublished photos and liner notes.

===2000s===
Cappo lives with his family in East Chatham, New York, and is active as a yoga teacher. He continues his association with the Hare Krishna community in the area and is an avid mixed martial arts fan and practitioner. Aside from the European Youth of Today reunion tour in 2003 and occasional American and European reunion shows, Cappo has been only intermittently involved in the hardcore music scene.

In 2006, Cappo released another Shelter record entitled &quot;Eternal&quot; on Good Life Recordings, and embarked on a European tour. He maintains a website for his yoga and raw food diet classes and an email list promoting raw foods and featuring recipes and inspirational quotations. Cappo also sponsors tours of India featuring important sites for practitioners of yoga.

In 2020, Cappo launched the podcast &quot;Wisdom of the Sages&quot; in collaboration with fellow Hare Krishna devotee Kaustubha Das. The show features musicians alongside senior devotees of the Hare Krishna movement.

<doc id="685346" wikidata="Q67449" url="?curid=685346" title="Alexander Mitscherlich (psychologist)">
<text>Alexander Harbord Mitscherlich (20 September 1908 – 26 June 1982) was a German psychiatrist and psychoanalyst.

== Life ==
Alexander Mitscherlich grew up in Munich and took up studies in history, the history of art, and philosophy at Munich University. When Mitscherlich&#x27;s Jewish-born dissertation thesis supervisor Paul Joachimsen died, in 1932, his chair was passed to an antisemite, Karl Alexander von Müller, who declined to take over the dissertation projects begun by his predecessor. This is why Mitscherlich left Munich for Berlin in order to open a bookstore there, where he sold writings critical of the current developments in Germany, bringing him to the attention of the SA. He was hence jailed in Germany several times from 1933 for political reasons.

Mitscherlich emigrated to Switzerland in order to take up studies in medicine there, only to return to Germany in 1937. He received a doctor&#x27;s degree from Heidelberg University in 1941 in neurology.

After World War II, he was an observer at the Nuremberg Trials against the Nazi physicians guilty of medical experiments and torture of the inmates of concentration camps. He worked at a clinic in Zürich where he met his future wife Margarete Mitscherlich-Nielsen. They married in 1955. It was his third marriage in all.

Alexander Mitscherlich founded the clinic for psychosomatic medicine at Heidelberg University in 1949. From 1953 he held the chair for psychosomatic medicine in Heidelberg. In 1960, together with his wife Margarete Mitscherlich he was a co-founder of the Sigmund-Freud-Institut at Frankfurt committed to psychoanalytic research. He directed the institute until 1976. From 1966 to 1973 Mitscherlich was professor for psychology at Frankfurt University.

From the 1960s, alongside the protagonists of the Frankfurt School, the Mitscherlichs played an important part in post-war Germany&#x27;s intellectual debates, employing psychoanalytic thought for explaining the causes behind Nazi Germany and its aftermath in German society to the present day. The first major book they wrote together was &quot;Die Unfähigkeit zu trauern. Grundlagen kollektiven Verhaltens&quot; (&quot;The Inability to Mourn: Principles of Collective Behaviour&quot;), first published in 1967, discussing why the Holocaust, the war crimes, and the sentiment of guilt on the offender&#x27;s part were not dealt with adequately in post-war German society. Mitscherlich pointed specifically to the Germans&#x27; inability to mourn their beloved leader, Adolf Hitler. Another important book Alexander Mitscherlich wrote was &quot;Die Unwirtlichkeit unserer Städte: Anstiftung zum Unfrieden&quot; (&quot;The inhospitality of our cities. A deliberate provocation&quot;) first published in 1965 that deals with the societal and psychological consequences of urban planning and architecture in post-war Germany. Late in this period, in 1969, Mitscherlich was the analyst of author Erica Jong, who stated, &quot;He was the first person that took me seriously as a writer. He helped me break through a lot of barriers in my work. He changed my life.&quot;

Mitscherlich was awarded the Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels in 1969. In 1973 he received the Cultural Honor Prize of the City of Munich and the Wilhelm-Leuschner-Medaille.

Alexander Mitscherlich died in Frankfurt am Main, aged 73. His bequest was handed over to Frankfurt University by his wife in 1982.

<text>Michael Eliot Gordon (born June 3, 1965) is an American bass guitarist and vocalist most recognized as a founding member of the band Phish. In addition to bass, Gordon plays banjo, piano, and guitar. He is a filmmaker (&quot;Rising Low&quot;, &quot;Outside Out&quot;) and author (&quot;Mike&#x27;s Corner&quot;). He has released six solo studio albums and three studio albums with acoustic guitar pioneer Leo Kottke.

==Biography==
Gordon was born in Sudbury, Massachusetts, the son of Marjorie Minkin, an abstract painter, and Robert Gordon, founder and former President and CEO of New England convenience store chain Store 24. Gordon attended the Solomon Schechter Day School of Greater Boston and Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. Gordon holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Arts (he was originally an Electrical Engineering major) from the University of Vermont.

Gordon met Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, and Jeff Holdsworth while attending college at University of Vermont, where the rock band Phish formed in 1983. He answered a posted flyer hanging in the dorms at UVM by Trey Anastasio, looking for a bass player for a new band.

Gordon played many roles in Phish. Until the band became too big for self-management, he dealt with practically all public relations and fan communication, such as answering fan mail, managing funds and booking gigs. Gordon wrote a column titled &quot;Mike&#x27;s Corner&quot; for the band&#x27;s newsletter in the 1990s.

Musically, Gordon&#x27;s influence is the most obvious in Phish&#x27;s many different renditions of various bluegrass, calypso, and even traditional Jewish songs (Gordon is Jewish). He also contributed by singing, as well as writing lyrics. Gordon wrote 19 original Phish songs and co-authored 27 additional Phish tracks, including &quot;Mound&quot;, &quot;Train Song&quot;, &quot;Round Room&quot;, &quot;Sugar Shack,&quot; &quot;Yarmouth Road,&quot; &quot;555,&quot; &quot;Say Something,&quot; &quot;Waking Up Dead,&quot; and the band&#x27;s third most-performed song historically: &quot;Mike&#x27;s Song.&quot;
 Gordon also practices transcendental meditation.

==Instruments and gear==
Like Phish guitarist Trey Anastasio, Gordon used to play custom-made bass guitars built by Paul Languedoc. Gordon played two Languedoc bass guitars, including a &quot;dragon&quot; bass. These bass guitars employed custom wound pickups from Mørch guitars of Denmark.

Gordon began experimenting with a Modulus Quantum 5 bass guitar on stage with Phish as early as October 31, 1994. He made the switch to this instrument as his main bass at Phish&#x27;s March 1, 1997, show at Markthalle in Hamburg, Germany to a Quantum 5 with two EMG DC pickups. He later acquired a TBX model which is the through-neck version of the same guitar. Gordon plays with a pick (Jim Dunlop 1.5mm triangular graphite picks) and Ken Smith Slickround™ (half flat) strings

Gordon&#x27;s signature sound is also attributable to an array of signal processing equipment including an ADA MB-1 pre-amp, an Ibanez flanger (used at the beginning of &quot;Down with Disease&quot;), a Lovetone Meatball envelope filter (also used at the beginning of &quot;Down with Disease&quot;), an Akai Deep Impact, an EHX Bass Micro-Synth, an EBS OctaBass and a Boss SYB-3, a Boss BF-2 flanger, an Eventide 4500 Harmonizer, an Eventide Eclipse and a Lexicon LXP-15.

Gordon has used a variety of amplifier and speaker combinations including the SWR SM-900 amp/Goliath 4x10&quot; enclosure but lately has been playing through Eden WT-800 amps, a Meyer Sound CP-10 parametric EQ, and onward toward a Meyer Sound powered speaker system (two 750P 2x18 cabs and two UPA-1Ps with 12&quot; low frequency drivers and 3&quot; compression drivers).

===Current gear===
As of December 2012, Gordon uses Source Audio Bass Envelope Filter Pro, Source Audio Bass Distortion Pro, Eventide Eclipse, Eventide Space, MXR graphic EQ, Boss graphic EQ and Electro Harmonix Super Ego, The Meatball envelope filter by Lovetone™, an Ibanez stomp box flanger, and an Eventide 4500 Harmonizer.

He currently uses Eden WT 800 amp into a Meyers CP-10 parametric EQ, and onward toward a Meyers powered speaker system: One 750P 2×18 and one 750 PL 2 x 18, two UPA-1P on top. He goes straight to the Eden WT800 driving a single Eden 4×10 cab, sometimes enhancing with more Eden 18s and more power.

In 2014, Gordon commissioned custom moiré instruments for himself and guitarist Scott Murawski to work with stage props being used on his 2014 Spring Tour. The guitar and bass (crafted specifically for this tour by Ben Lewry of Oakland, California&#x27;s Visionary Instruments) are hollow, with LEDs inside that make them glow, and moiré screens stretched across the front. The LEDs in the guitars are manipulated by the lighting director, swapping colors and flashing patterns in response to the music.

He has played banjo since 1994, performing the instrument in concert with Phish and [Phil Lesh] (albeit an electric banjo) and in the studio on the 2007 Bernie Worrell album &quot;Improvisczario&quot;.

== Projects ==
===Mike Gordon (2015–present)===
His current touring band (again billed as &quot;Mike Gordon&quot;) is Scott Murawski on guitar, Robert Walter on B3 Organ &amp; Synth, drummer John Morgan Kimock and percussionist Craig Myers. These band members have toured regularly with Gordon since 2015, with the exception of a tour in June 2023, which saw keyboardist Rachel Eckroth subbing for Robert Walter while he was on the road with Roger Waters. Gordon decided to tour as a quintet to differentiate his project&#x27;s instrumentation from Phish.

In April 2017, Gordon and his bandmates recorded OGOGO, Mike&#x27;s fifth studio album, as a band at Q Division in Boston. “All five of us decided not to do what we had done before, but to be fresher and try to find our own voices. That started happening in a some jams... I want things to be interesting in a way that would serve the song.” The album was produced by GRAMMY Award-winning Shawn Everett and was released on September 15, 2017.

In February 2023, Gordon announced his sixth solo record &quot;Flying Games&quot;, which was written and recorded during 2020’s lockdown, in his makeshift Megaplum home studio. The album was produced by Gordon, recorded by longtime collaborator Jared Slomoff, and mixed by six-time Grammy-winning engineer Shawn Everett (Alabama Shakes, The War on Drugs). Gordon brought in contributions from bandmates, Kimock, Walter, Myers, and Murawski. It was released May 12, 2023.

===Mike Gordon (2008–2014)===
His past touring band (and longest running touring project) was billed as &quot;Mike Gordon&quot; and included Scott Murawski on guitar, drummer Todd Isler, keyboard player Tom Cleary and percussionist Craig Myers.

Gordon toured with this band from Summer 2008 through April 2014. The band made its debut late night talk-show television appearance on February 11, as musical guests on &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, promoting Gordon&#x27;s album &quot;Moss&quot;.

They played a small handful of dates in New England (and one date in Albany) in November and December 2011, including a show at The Egg in Albany, NY on December 11, 2011 that ended up being the focus of a live album Gordon released in 2013 simply called &quot;The Egg&quot;. They again toured in March 2014 (and a few weekends in April) supporting Gordon&#x27;s last solo album (co-written with band-mate Murawski) &quot;Overstep&quot;.

===Mike Gordon and Leo Kottke===
In 2002, Gordon recorded the album &quot;Clone&quot; with acoustic guitarist Leo Kottke. The duo reunited in 2005 for &quot;Sixty Six Steps&quot;, followed by a supporting tour.

In August 2019, Gordon confirmed that he and Kottke had returned to the studio to record a new album. In August 2020, Kottke and Gordon announced the release of the album, &quot;Noon&quot;, that month on Megaplum/ATO Records. It was their first collaboration since &quot;Sixty Six Steps&quot; and Kottke&#x27;s first studio album since 2005. As had been previously rumored, Phish drummer Jon Fishman appeared on several tracks.

===Benevento/Russo Duo and GRAB (2004–2006)===
In 2004, Gordon performed with The Benevento-Russo Duo for several shows benefiting Headcount, a voter registration organization. The trio played a number of dates in late 2004 and 2005 including the Bonnaroo Music Festival in June 2005 and a New Year&#x27;s Eve series of shows in Florida and the northeastern United States. Gordon has originally met Joe Russo through Ropeadope founder Andy Hurwitz from in 2003 and jammed together in a few informal settings, leading to the Headcount benefit.

In summer 2006, Gordon, along with Phish bandmate Trey Anastasio, again joined the Benevento-Russo Duo for a co-headlining tour with Phil Lesh and Friends before finishing the final leg of the tour on their own. The group performed various songs from each members&#x27; catalog, as well as a handful of brand new originals. The quartet parted ways after the tour ended in July.

===Other projects===
Gordon has played in several side-projects apart from Phish, including Grappa Boom with Jamie Masefield of the Jazz Mandolin Project, The Chieftains with Rosanne Cash, and Doug Perkins of Smokin&#x27; Grass. Gordon formed his own solo band featuring Josh Roseman, Scott Murawski, Julee Avallone, James Harvey, Gordon Stone, Jeannie Hill and Doug Belote in 2003.

He released his first solo album outside of Phish in 2003, entitled &quot;Inside In&quot;.

In summer 2004, Gordon produced musician Joey Arkenstat&#x27;s first album, &quot;Bane&quot;. Gordon is also credited with providing vocals and shofar accompaniment. In December 2005, Gordon formed SerialPod with Anastasio and Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann. The group debuted at the 17th annual Warren Haynes Christmas Jam in Asheville, North Carolina. In early 2006, Gordon teamed up with his mother, artist Marjorie Minkin, to present &quot;Another Side of In&quot; — a visual and audio art show featuring interactive sculptures created by Minkin and set to the music of &quot;Inside In&quot;. The interactive show appeared at the Boston Children&#x27;s Museum beginning in January 2010.

Later in 2006, Gordon formed a honky-tonk band called Ramble Dove, consisting of himself, Brett Hughes, Neil Cleary, Marie Claire and Scott Murawski. The band came into fruition after Gordon&#x27;s long-time stint as bass guitar player in a honky-tonk band led by Brett Hughes that performed each Tuesday night at the Burlington, Vermont, club, Radio Bean. The group performs a number of classic country songs and a few Gordon originals, such as &quot;Ramble Dove&quot;, &quot;Loosening Up The Rules&quot; and the rare Phish song &quot;Weekly Time&quot;.

In August 2006, Gordon joined the Rhythm Devils – a group featuring Kreutzmann, The Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, guitarist Steve Kimock and a host of backup players. On January 2, 2007, Gordon appeared with a group billed as &quot;The House Band&quot; containing many former members of The Grateful Dead playing at a party in honor of the new leadership of the United States House of Representatives hosted by Nancy Pelosi. The group included Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Bob Weir, Bruce Hornsby and Warren Haynes.

He joined Trey Anastasio at the first annual Rothbury Music Festival in July during his solo acoustic set. Anastasio and Phish drummer Jon Fishman joined Gordon for part of his set the same day. Gordon released an album entitled &quot;The Green Sparrow&quot; on Rounder Records on August 5, 2008.

On March 6, 2009, Mike reunited with Phish at the Hampton Coliseum. The band has toured regularly since Summer 2009.

Gordon finished writing and recording his next solo album, &quot;Moss&quot;, at his home studio in Vermont in May 2010. The album was released by Rounder Records on October 19. He explained that many of the songs on the new album &quot;began as bass and drum jams&quot; adding that it is &quot;kind of bass-oriented. Not in that the bass is the lead, but that the rhythms and the patterns are bass centric. The uniqueness is centered on the bass. So the bass is the key instrument. On &quot;Inside In&quot;, the pedal steel is the key instrument and if you had to say it for &quot;Green Sparrow&quot;, maybe electric guitar. But this time it&#x27;s the bass.&quot;

<doc id="685350" wikidata="Q7893735" url="?curid=685350" title="Unity (George album)">
<text>Unity is the second and final studio album from Australian band George. It was released in February 2004 and peaked at number 5 on the ARIA Charts.

==The making of the album==
The band recorded the album in Byron Bay during 2003. The album was produced by David Nicholas assisted by Justin Tresidder. Melbourne composer Paul Grabowsky also assisted with orchestral and horn arrangements.

Bassist Paulie Bromley said on the band&#x27;s web site that the album reflects the band&#x27;s growth since their first album Polyserena &quot;&quot;Polyserena&quot; was us learning how to make a record, &quot;Unity&quot; was making that record.&quot; Songwriter, vocalist, keyboardist and guitarist Tyrone Noonan said that the songwriting was more mature &quot;I personally feel like I&#x27;ve developed a lot as a songwriter, more confident lyrics and statements being expressed through those lyrics. Overall it&#x27;s a more positive approach in dealing with personal issues and socio-political issues, more positive light. As a band, this to me feels like a really mature album for us.&quot; Katie Noonan says on the band&#x27;s web site that the title reflects the band&#x27;s approach on the album &quot;That family vibe brings a closeness and honesty that permeates what we do. Collectively and individually, we&#x27;ve been through a great period of change and growth. Knowing we can look to each other for strength brings comfort and solidarity. We have all been through the same thing and there&#x27;s an incredible sense of union from that experience - that&#x27;s what being in a band&#x27;s about.&quot;

<doc id="685354" wikidata="Q6721761" url="?curid=685354" title="MacCabe Park">
<text>MacCabe Park is a small park located in the City of Wollongong, Australia. It is commonly misspelt McCabe Park, though the sign has since been changed to its correct name. In 1855 a land grant was made to Governor Brown, the present site of the park.
It contains a playground at the north east corner of the rectangular area covered by the park, the local youth centre is in the north west side, and a sculpture called &quot;Nike&quot; is found in this area amidst a garden area. The youth centre has a small skating area and sometimes ramps and kickers are brought out, with a small number of fastened ramps present. The centre&#x27;s walls are covered with graffiti and murals. A small strip of native plants and trees is present on the edge of the skating area. The northeastern area features a council operated art gallery and a war memorial, featuring a planted area and a canon. The west part of the park area features shops like Dick Smith bordering a narrow walkway underneath and between climbing plants. In the gaps between shops palm trees have been planted. Paths are present in the park and most of it is lawn grass. The southern end contains a man-made hillock with a smaller peak to its northern end and a larger slightly higher one at its southern end, with a circular amphitheatre of brick. In the southeastern and northwestern parts of the park are covered paths. In the eastern area is a community hall and carpark. The hall features a mural depicting a famous scene from E.T.

The park area is surrounded by streets, the east side borders Church Street, Wollongong, the west side borders Keira Street, the north borders Burelli Street, and the southern end borders Ellen Street. The park is located in the southern part of Wollongong&#x27;s central business district, only two blocks from Wollongong Central and Wollongong Mall.

Plants in the park include palms, a few native eucalypts, grass plants, small grey leafed shrubs and a small planting of casuarinas south of the amphitheatre.

Wollongong City Council has had a policy in place since 1990 to purchase the commercial properties surrounding the park as they become available. Eventually, these commercial buildings will be demolished to expand the public open space.

<doc id="685361" wikidata="Q513910" url="?curid=685361" title="Judge (band)">
<text>Judge is a New York hardcore band formed in 1987 by Youth of Today guitarist John &quot;Porcell&quot; Porcelly and former Youth of Today drummer Mike &quot;Judge&quot; Ferraro.

==History==
Their first release was a 7-inch EP on Porcell&#x27;s label Schism (which he ran along with Side by Side/Gorilla Biscuits guitar player Alex Brown) entitled &quot;New York Crew&quot;. The record featured five songs, one of which was a cover of &quot;Warriors&quot; by the British oi!/punk band Blitz. On this recording, the band was merely a two-piece, featuring Porcelly on bass and guitar, and Ferraro on vocals and drums. But with the addition of bass-player Jimmy Yu (of Mike&#x27;s former band Death Before Dishonor, which eventually evolved into Supertouch) and drummer &quot;Lukey&quot; Luke Abbey (Warzone/Gorilla Biscuits), they got together a fully functional live line-up.

The band received much criticism due to their militant straight edge lyrics, especially from fanzines like San Francisco&#x27;s Maximum Rock&#x27;N&#x27;Roll. The militant lyrics were a conscious move on the band&#x27;s part, as they were sick of seeing bands like Youth of Today, who in reality had a very positive message, get slagged for being too militant. So they decided to give the nay-sayers exactly what they wanted – the most militant Straight Edge band imaginable. Mike Ferraro has later on admitted that provocation was an important aim for the band.

Judge was not just heavy in message, the music had very metal-influenced riffing, but remained close to its hardcore roots, without going all out metal, such as bands like Agnostic Front and D.R.I.

With a new line-up of Sammy Siegler (Side by Side/Youth of Today/Project X etc.) on drums and Matt Pincus on bass, the band proceeded to record their full-length LP &quot;Bringin&#x27; It Down&quot; for Revelation Records at Chung King Studios in New York City. The recording was finished, but the band were so unhappy with the result that they decided to scrap it and re-record it at Normandy Sound in Rhode Island, where the Cro-Mags had recorded their &quot;Best Wishes&quot; album. Revelation did however put out a limited pressing of the original recording, fittingly titled &quot;Chung King Can Suck It&quot;. It was given to people who had pre-ordered the record, and with only 110 copies pressed (all on white vinyl), it is one of the most sought-after hardcore records in existence, going for as much as $6,600 on online auction sites such as eBay.
Eventually, &quot;Bringin&#x27; It Down&quot; was released in 1989. Judge continued touring up until 1991, and even released another 7-inch EP, &quot;There Will Be Quiet&quot;, featuring &quot;The Storm&quot; and &quot;Forget This Time&quot; (the CD-version also contains a cover version of &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, originally by Led Zeppelin).

In May 2013, Judge reunited and played two shows in New York City. In 2014 and 2015, the band continued to play shows in United States as well as in South America and Europe.

==Careers after Judge==
John Porcelly went on to tour and record with Hare Krishna hardcore band Shelter (featuring Ray Cappo of Youth of Today, as well as a revolving line-up of more and less well-known hardcore musicians, including Tom Capone of Bold and Quicksand, and Vic DiCara of Beyond, Inside Out, and 108). Porcelly later started the bands Never Surrender and Last of the Famous, and ran a record label called Fight Fire with Fire and the website TrueTillDeath.com, but all these projects seem to be either scrapped or inactive. He played with the reunited Bold in 2005–06, and a book chronicling all issues of his fanzine Schism was also released in late 2005.

Mike Ferraro (musician) (not to be confused with television and filmmaker Mike Judge) formed the band Mike Judge &amp; Old Smoke with Judge roadie Todd Schwartz, a band playing Neil Young-inspired acoustic as well as guitar driven music. They released a 12-inch &quot;Sights on Revelation Records in 1993. In his free time, Ferraro now raises chickens on a family farm in West Virginia.

Sammy Siegler played in several late 1980s/early 1990s hardcore bands, either regularly or as a replacement. In the mid-late 1990s he recorded and toured with the band CIV, featuring Anthony Civarelli and Arthur Smilios of Gorilla Biscuits. He has also appeared in Shelter, and major label rock band Rival Schools, featuring Walter Schreifels (also of Gorilla Biscuits, as well as Quicksand and several other bands) He recorded Glassjaw first full-length. In 2005 he joined Limp Bizkit as temporary replacement for drummer John Otto.

Matt Pincus is the Founder and former CEO of Songs Music Publishing which, until its sale in 2017, was the leading contemporary independent music publisher in the United States. SONGS clients included The Weeknd, Lorde, Diplo, DJ Mustard, and many other songwriters in all genres of music. In 2017, SONGS was acquired by Kobalt Music Publishing.

Jimmy Yu became a Chan/Zen Buddhist monk in 1991 under the name Guogu, and now teaches Buddhism and meditation under the direction of Chan/Zen Master Sheng Yen. Yu is currently an Assistant Professor of Religion at Florida State University. Yu received his Ph.D. from Princeton University&#x27;s Department of Religion in 2008. Yu teaches courses in East Asian religious traditions, specializing in Chinese and Japanese Buddhism and late imperial Chinese cultural history. His research interests include the cultural history of the body, Buddhist monasticism, Chan/Zen Buddhism, and popular religions within the broader context of fifteenth to seventeenth centuries China. Here is a 2008 Double Cross Hardcore fanzine interview with Jimmy Yu in which he talks about growing up in the hardcore scene.

<text>Pincheon Green is a hamlet in the Metropolitan Borough of Doncaster in South Yorkshire, England. It lies in the civil parish of Sykehouse, on the border with the East Riding of Yorkshire, and lies above sea level.

The name is thought to derive from &quot;Pinch(e)on&quot;, a surname which is a variant of Puncheon, and &quot;grene&quot;, the Middle English word for a field or grassy place. It was first recorded on maps in 1817, and documented in Tithe Awards in 1841.

The hamlet is surrounded by waterways. To the east is the River Don, while to the west is the New Junction Canal. To the north are the Aire and Calder Navigation, (Knottingley and Goole section) and the River Went. Immediately to the north of the dwellings is the Sykehouse Main Drain. The drain flows from west to east, and is pumped into the River Don by Town Cloughs pumping station, managed by the Danvm Drainage Commissioners, an internal drainage board. Between the drain and the River Went, protection from flooding is provided by the Sykehouse Barrier Bank, which runs along the southern edge of the Went Lows washland. The washland floods when high levels in the River Don cause the pointing doors at the mouth of the River Went to close, preventing water from the Don flowing up the Went, but also preventing downsteam flow on the Went from discharging into the Don.

Warren Hall is situated on the western edge of the hamlet. The moated site is a scheduled monument. Such sites were usually built in the middle ages, and consist of a wide ditch, often water-filled, which surrounded an island of dry ground, on which domestic or religious buildings were built. Warren Hall is unusual in that there were two islands, and the remains of a wooden bridge were discovered on the northern edge of the larger island when a slurry pit was being constructed on the farm in 1962. Some medieval tiles found on the site are in the Doncaster Museum. Warren Hall was mentioned in a lease dated to 1521, when William Copley took up residence there. Prior to that it had been the home of the Fitzwilliam family.

<doc id="685368" wikidata="Q6695023" url="?curid=685368" title="Luann (comic strip)">
<text>Luann is a syndicated newspaper comic strip written and drawn by Greg Evans. It was launched by North America Syndicate on March 17, 1985. The strip is currently syndicated by Andrews McMeel Syndication. In 2012, Greg Evans&#x27; daughter Karen Evans began co-authoring the strip.

&quot;Luann&quot; takes place in an unnamed suburban setting, and primarily focuses on young adult Luann DeGroot dealing with school, her love interests, family, and friends. Some storylines center on other characters, including her older brother Brad. The strip is particularly notable in that the characters age over time, albeit not in real time.

In 2003, Evans won the Reuben Award for Cartoonist of the Year for his work on &quot;Luann.&quot;

==Characters and story==
===Main characters===
;Luann C. DeGroot: The comic strip&#x27;s protagonist, Luann often struggles with her self-image and is particularly self-conscious about her large feet. She can be shallow, self-centered, and immature. Luann graduated from Pitts Junior–Senior High School in 2014 and has dreams of becoming an entertainer after starring in &quot;West Side Story&quot; and being a beauty pageant runner-up. She is left-handed, which is a common trait among comic strip characters. Currently, Luann is attending a local junior college and taking introductory art and chemistry classes. She is also working in early education alongside Tiffany during the summer. In a writing class, Luann shows an aptitude for writing comedy and humor, and as such, has started to show more wit in her conversations with others

: First appearance: March 17, 1985

;Bernice Halper: Luann and Bernice have been close friends since third grade. Bernice is laid-back and observant, but tends to have a negative outlook on life. In 2007, she discovered she had an older brother, Sgt. Ben York, who was serving in Iraq. Bernice had initially planned to become a veterinarian, but ended up interning as a guidance counselor during her senior year. She started college at Moony University in 2014 and became friends with her roommate Dez. In 2015, she became a dorm R.A., but in 2020 her position was eliminated, forcing her to move in with the DeGroot family.
:First appearance: March 18, 1985

;Delta James: Luann&#x27;s friend Delta started off as a slacker but became more ambitious as she got older. She joined many clubs and activities in school and volunteered. While Bernice is intellectually wise, Delta is politically intelligent and wants a career in politics. In 1998, Delta was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma but went into remission the following year. In 2009, she almost couldn&#x27;t go on a class trip to Washington, D.C. due to lack of funds, but was able to go with the help of donations raised by Luann, Bernice, Tiffany, and Elwood. During the trip, Delta met President Barack Obama in the White House. Delta is now attending Howard University in Washington and hasn&#x27;t been mentioned much since 2014.

:First appearance: April 1, 1985
:Last appearance: November 11, 2014

;Nancy and Frank DeGroot: Luann&#x27;s parents. Nancy is portrayed as the heart of the family, while Frank provides for it, though he&#x27;s usually portrayed as criminally cheap. Frank often seems clueless about what goes on, while Nancy is more aware. She constantly hounds Luann to clean her room, without success. Using their savings and money from T.J.&#x27;s insurance settlement, Frank and Nancy have purchased a rundown warehouse, and turned it into a restaurant and performance space.

:Frank&#x27;s first appearance: March 21, 1985 (voice), May 22, 1985 (drawn).

:Nancy&#x27;s first appearance: May 3, 1985 (voice), August 12, 1986 (drawn).

;Brad DeGroot: Luann&#x27;s older brother, Brad, used to have a snarky relationship with her. He worked at Weenie World but after 9/11, he became a firefighter. Brad had to get in shape for the job and now looks more fit. He and his friend T.J. moved into Brad&#x27;s parents&#x27; rental home, which was damaged by T.J. Brad spends his free time fixing his car. Brad&#x27;s firefighter storyline gets as much, if not more, attention than Luann&#x27;s.

: In June 2011 Brad was laid off but he was rehired in November after another firefighter left. On March 31, 2012, Brad proposed to Toni Daytona, with some persuasion from T.J., but they agreed to postpone the topic. On April 2, 2013, Toni proposed to Brad, and he accepted. Originally, they planned to have their wedding on September 11, but due to controversy, it was postponed to December 11, 2016. After the wedding, Toni moved into the house shared by T.J. and Brad. In September 2024, after taking care of Toni&#x27;s niece Shannon for a month and finding they liked it, Brad and Toni decide to try and have a family of their own.

:Brad got a firefighter&#x27;s tattoo matching Toni&#x27;s on August 27, 2008 (first seen August 28, 2008).

:Brad&#x27;s first appearance: March 25, 1985 (voice), March 26, 1985 (drawn).

===Love interests===
;Aaron Hill: Aaron is a boy who is desired by both Luann and Tiffany. He is sometimes vain, which makes him a good match for Tiffany. However, he also shows consideration for others&#x27; feelings. Luann finds him cute and lovable, but he has been mixed up in the past, having been in love with an older girl named Diane. He currently lives in Hawaii. Luann won a free trip to Hawaii in August 2005 and visited Aaron, but discovered he had a new girlfriend named Lian. Aaron later contacted Luann through MySpace in October 2006, sharing his experiences in Hawaii and revealing that he had broken up with Lian. This reignited Luann&#x27;s feelings for Aaron. Although there was speculation about his return, Aaron has not been seen since Luann&#x27;s trip to Hawaii.

:First mentioned: March 23, 1985.

:First appearance March 24, 1985.

:Last appearance: August 15, 2005, April 1, 2020 (flashback cameo)

;Gunther Berger: Gunther, a smart student at Pitts High School, lacks fashion sense and gentlemanly qualities. He has feelings for Luann but is jealous of her crushes on other guys. Although Luann is not interested in him, she becomes jealous when Gunther shows interest in other girls. Gunther also has a romantic interest in Bernice, with whom he has more in common. He wears contact lenses despite being allergic to them. Gunther volunteers at the local library and is skilled at sewing. He lives with his mother and has insecurities about his father leaving the family. Luann helps Gunther when his mother breaks her leg. Gunther and Rosa Aragones have mutual feelings for each other, but Gunther is nervous around her. Luann supports Gunther and gives him advice on winning Rosa&#x27;s heart. Gunther goes to Peru with Rosa but eventually returns home to attend college. He becomes study buddies with Tiffany, which complicates their relationship. Gunther&#x27;s bully from high school, Leslie Knox, becomes an acquaintance when Leslie&#x27;s uncle starts dating Gunther&#x27;s mother. Gunther is upset when Leslie&#x27;s uncle proposes to his mother. In college, Gunther has a new girlfriend in Bets, a cosplay enthusiast &amp; influencer. Though their personalities clash at times (Bets being more adventurous while Gunther is more cautious), the two try to make their relationship work, such as buying a van to tour the country with. On numerous occasions through the years, Gunther and Luann have had interactions that seemed to imply they share a mutual attraction, yet both insist that they&#x27;re not interested in each other romantically, but are rather just dear, mutual friends.

;Quill: A Pitts High School senior from Australia, Quill moved to the US with his family. His arrival caused tension between Luann and Tiffany, as Tiffany was attracted to Quill but he showed more interest in Luann due to their shared interests and her intelligence. They shared their first kiss at a New Year&#x27;s Eve Party in 2011. Luann and Quill admitted their attraction but decided not to pursue a relationship because Quill would have to return to Australia. However, they couldn&#x27;t resist and kissed again in Luann&#x27;s room, but Quill received a call from his father informing him that they were moving back to Australia. They maintained a long-distance relationship until 2014 when Quill returned to the US and graduated with Luann&#x27;s class. He became roommates with Gunther and prioritized his acting career over Luann, causing her to break up with him in 2016. After a follow-up appearance a few months later, confirming he had moved on with his life, he disappeared from the strip entirely. Like Luann, Quill is left-handed.

;Toni Louise (Daytona) DeGroot: Brad&#x27;s wife and fellow firefighter, Toni, joined him in all of the Pre-Fire Academy courses. However, when Brad failed the physical exam, Toni continued on her own. Toni&#x27;s boyfriend, Dirk, became jealous and abusive towards her and physically violent towards Brad. Toni eventually ended the relationship with Dirk. After Dirk was released from jail, Toni and Brad started socializing again, but their friendship was strained when Brad had Dirk arrested for violating a restraining order. They stopped speaking for months but eventually reconnected when Brad moved into his rental home. Their relationship progressed slowly, including dates, and they shared their first kiss on April 2, 2008. In a mid-2009 incident, Toni fell from a ladder while fighting a fire and Brad caught her, injuring himself in the process. Toni offered to take care of Brad during his recovery and confessed her love for him. On a 2010 holiday strip, Toni and Brad went shopping. Toni had Brad hold her purse while she bought lingerie, showing their relationship was progressing. In June 2010, Toni revealed that her parents died in a car crash when she was a child, and she and her brother were raised by their aunt and uncle. Toni, her brother Jonah, and his daughter Shannon moved to Pitts about 4 years ago. On March 31, 2012, Brad proposed to Toni. On April 2, 2013, Toni proposed to Brad, which seemed to be a serious proposal unlike Brad&#x27;s previous one. Brad accepted the next day. Their wedding was on December 11, 2016. Toni also has a strong knowledge of automobiles and uses this to help Gunter and Bets buy a used van for cross-country traveling, buying it at $3,000 lower than what the seller was originally asking for. In the spring and summer of 2024, Brad and Toni have serious discussions about having children, and while they initially balk at the prospect, due to the hectic schedules of their jobs, this changes when they have to watch Shannon for a short time while Jonah&#x27;s away, and after a rocky start, the two realize they could be able to raise a child together, and after Shannon leaves, Brad and Toni decide to start trying to have a family.

;Miguel Vargas: Miguel, a foreign exchange student from Spain, quickly caught the attention of Delta when he saved her from a thief. As Miguel started his first day at school, he found himself being pursued by Luann, Delta, and Tiffany. Although he liked all three girls, he was most drawn to Luann because of her down-to-earth personality. However, when Delta fell ill with cancer, Miguel showed unwavering support, which made Luann jealous. Luann found Miguel attractive but felt he was too aggressive, leading to an on-and-off romantic tension between them. On November 29, 1999, Miguel took Luann on a date to a secluded parking spot, but their plans were interrupted when Luann received a phone call pretending to be a family emergency.
 Miguel also saved Tiffany&#x27;s life by performing CPR when she almost drowned in the pool. Tiffany took advantage of his kindness by using him to steal Gunther&#x27;s test paper.

:First appearance: September 27, 1993

;Rosa Aragones: A relatively new girl at Pitts High School when she was first shown. She was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in Italy, France, and Mexico, and can speak English as well as French, Italian, and Spanish, leading Luann to wonder why she&#x27;s in school. Later that year, she is assisted with her books by Gunther, sparking jealousy in Luann until she learns that Rosa hurt her arm carrying her sister into her wheelchair. She appears again in the Pageant storyline of March/April 2011. Later, she and Gunther grow closer, and their developing relationship is encouraged by Luann as she tries to decide how to proceed in her relationship with Quill. While Rosa is open about her attraction to him, Gunther tends to be awkward and bumbling around her, wanting to please her. They eventually began dating, and upon graduating from high school, they travel to Peru to assist at her uncle&#x27;s clinic. However, Gunther becomes disillusioned with Peru, and returns to the U.S. with the encouragement of Rosa, who remains.

:First appearance: September 5, 2006

:Last appearance: January 12, 2015

;Mrs. Horner: An elderly woman whom Luann visits from time to time and who frequently gives her candid advice. In March 2006 she moved out of her old home and into a new retirement center, but needed the help of Luann, who asked Bernice, Brad, and Toni to help her move out. Dirk followed Toni to the home, and to impress and be near Toni, helped the moving job finish faster; however, when he picked up Mrs. Horner&#x27;s clock, an envelope full of money fell out, which Dirk pocketed, intending to steal it. He was caught by Brad, he claimed it to be his, but when Brad swiped it at the perfect time to return to Mrs. Horner, Dirk turned his story around and claimed to have found the envelope in the clock and intended to return it to her. He would have been kicked out if Mrs. Horner had not believed his lie. She later sold her old home to Nancy and Frank, who began renting to Brad. She has made occasional appearances in the strip since then.

:First appearance: July 16, 2001

;Eddie Munter: The new manager of Borderline Books, who replaced Ann Eiffel after she was unwillingly transferred. While Munter is normally very humorous and goodhearted, often ending his comments or jokes with &quot;Kidding!&quot;, he knows when to be tough and decisive with his employees, earning the respect of Bernice and Zane shortly after he took over.

:First appearance: July 9, 2002

;Shannon Daytona (Lewis?): Toni&#x27;s bratty, blunt and disrespectful six-year-old niece. Her mother left soon after her birth, leaving her with her father, Jonah Daytona. Possibly due to her father ignoring his responsibilities and leaving her with Toni a great deal of the time, Shannon gets what she wants through demanding, whining or throwing temper tantrums. Toni&#x27;s continuous babysitting has unfortunately reduced the amount of time Brad and Toni have to see each other. Shannon seems to have a strong liking for Brad, whom she&#x27;s renamed &quot;Bwad&quot;, although the feeling is not exactly mutual. Shannon first appeared in 1996, when Luann was asked to sit for the 3-year old in addition to her cousin, Lindy Lewis, but quit due to Shannon&#x27;s bad behavior. She later reappeared in the strip as Toni&#x27;s 5-year old cousin in 2008, but in June 2010 it was established that she was actually Toni&#x27;s niece. While Greg Evans doesn&#x27;t explicitly state that the 1996 Shannon and the 2008 Shannon are one and the same character, he notes in his blog that while Shannon Daytona is not Shannon &quot;Lewis&quot;, Luann did indeed babysit her, and that they both recognized each other. As the earlier Shannon&#x27;s last name was never disclosed, and since Jonah Daytona was never married to Shannon&#x27;s mother, this may imply that she was never Shannon &quot;Lewis&quot; in the first place. Toni once referred to Shannon as &quot;Mini Eiffel&quot; due to her similar appearance and personality.

:First appearance: January 8, 1996

;Jonah Daytona: Toni&#x27;s brother and Shannon&#x27;s father. He first appeared alongside Toni at a car show where Brad had initially mistaken him for Toni&#x27;s boyfriend. Seen as flaky and irresponsible by the rest of the characters, his desired acting career causes him to constantly leave Shannon with his sister so he can rush off to auditions. This tends to get in the way of both her job and her relationship with her boyfriend, Brad, but lately they have become a bit more willing to take care of Shannon (partly due to their low opinion of Jonah&#x27;s parenting). He had a role in the play &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, and hoped this would lead to his becoming rich and famous, but it did not, and he continues to seek work. Judging from the collective opinion of Brad, Toni, Quill, and Luann, his acting skill left much to be desired. In the August 16 to 18, 2016 strips, Toni was able to confront Jonah of being irresponsible of taking care of Shannon, but he managed to twist things around and blame Toni, causing her to look after Shannon once more reluctantly. In the summer of 2024, Jonah manages to land a spot in a series of shampoo commercials, making Toni and Brad look after Shannon again while he&#x27;s away to film them. When he returns, Jonah announces that he also found voice-acting work that allows him to work remotely from home and take Shannon under his care once again.

:First appearance: June 12, 2003

;Oxford: Oxford, called Ox for short, is a big student who first appeared when Leslie was about to hurt Gunther. He breaks up the scuffle by telling Leslie that if he beat up Gunther, he would do the same to Leslie, causing him to leave. Gunther later thanks him for standing up for his safety; it is revealed that Ox doesn&#x27;t like bullying or bullies in general and that some people mistake him for one (due to his height and brawny physique). Ox is very kind and likes to help others in need. It is hinted that Ox has rich parents, as they gave him a platinum credit card to pay for his lunches (which tend to be large). He becomes friends with Gunther and eventually T.J. in the May 9, 2012, strip, when he starts eating at Weenie World. In the May 17, 2012, strip, during which Ann Eiffel plans to sue Toni and her niece, Shannon (the latter having bit her finger in an April 2012 strip), Ox returns and upon learning of the event and Ann&#x27;s cruel way of forcing him to sign a paper to file lawsuit, he refuses and sees Ann as another bully. In the May 22, 2012, strip, Ox takes her paper to show it to his uncle: a lawyer. Ox later agrees not to tell on her so long as she gives up trying to sue Toni; in the final strip of the week, Ann offers Ox a job, impressed by his integrity, but Ox refuses, as he is convinced that Ann simply isn&#x27;t nice. Ox now works as a server at the DeGroots&#x27; restaurant. Ox is also highly intelligent, as when Gunther and Luann show up for a costume party with a &quot;doll theme&quot;, and Tiffany thinks their costumes don&#x27;t fit, Ox figures out that Gunther is dressed as a book written by Roald Dahl while Luann is dressed as Dolly Parton, making the costumes fit phonetically.

:First appearance: March 2, 2012

;Desdemona: Desdemona, always referred to as Dez, is Bernice&#x27;s roommate at Moony Uni. Dez was unseen for the entirety of Bernice&#x27;s first semester, always coming and going when Bernice was gone or asleep.

Dez is very spiritual and worldly and decorates the dorm room with souvenirs from her travels.

;Prudence: Prudence (aka Pru) is a friend of Quill&#x27;s. She is from New York, and currently staying with the Degroots. During his time in New York as an intern in a theater program, Quill was partnered with a fellow intern, Prudence. Quill had told the others that Prudence was coming from New York to direct a Holiday Show that she wrote, which they could use for opening night of The Fuse. Initially, Luann was jealous of Quill&#x27;s and Pru&#x27;s relationship, despite Quill insisting that they were friends, and Bernice was wary of her, thinking that Pru was interested in stealing Quill from Luann. However, when Bernice and Prudence were comforting Luann, it was revealed that Prudence is, as she puts it, &quot;a lesbian thespian!&quot; Prudence is very energetic and friendly towards everyone. Prudence has some things in common with Luann, as they both love the arts, and they both practiced what they were going to say before meeting each other. Pru worked at the DeGroots&#x27; event space/restaurant and living in Brad&#x27;s old bedroom. In March 2020 she announced she was moving back to New York City and marrying a pilot.

;Jack and Nil: Two male students who attended the same college art class with Luann. Jack is seen as an upbeat, yet not very bright person, whereas Nil shows no emotion and makes sardonic remarks about everything. While the professor and Luann initially referred to them as &quot;Jock&quot; and &quot;Goth&quot;, their real names remained unknown until the November 3, 2016, strip. Jack likes dogs and can be seen taking his pet dog, Max, to the dog park, where Luann spends time with Puddles. Bernice became infatuated with Jack after meeting him until she went on to have a relationship with Nil; this continued until she felt that she was uncontrollable with her intimacy for the latter. They subsequently remain as friends and she serves as a &quot;muse&quot; for his artwork. It was implied afterward that Nil might be bisexual, or rather asexual, after he casually mentioned to Bernice about a random person named Fred who had been asking him out for months.

:First appearance: January 26, 2015

;Tara Starr: Kicked out of Moony Uni for stealing a dorm TV and breaking into a vending machine on Bernice&#x27;s floor, Tara showed up the next fall as Luann&#x27;s chemistry lab partner at the junior college. She&#x27;s uninhibited, free-wheeling, and a little wild, but she recognizes the mistakes she made at Moony and intends to buckle down at the Junior College. However, she soon begins rebelling again when she signs up for a class where Luann is the TA, thinking Luann will give her special treatment. She later decides to move to Utah in order to escape her criminal cousin, but ultimately changed her mind once the cousin was arrested. She ended up getting Luann into trouble at work by bringing a bow and arrow into an elementary school classroom (Luann was doing an after-school program and allowed Tara to meet her students without clearing it with the school administration). In late February 2023, it was revealed that she and Piro are cousins and that they have family issues.

;Bets: A cosplay enthusiast and current girlfriend of Gunther, and is also Tiffany&#x27;s college roommate. While she is eager and creative, she is also very self-centered and focused on her social media following. This leaves her oblivious to how her actions can sometimes affect other people, such as pressuring Gunther into featuring on her social media despite his reluctance, and steamrolling over Tiffany&#x27;s fancy dinner party business with her own ideas. After she and Gunter buy a van for a cross-country trip, when they return, Bets leaves again on her own to travel more and posting about it on social media. When she returns, she comes back to seeing Gunther and Luann attending a costume party together, leaving everyone, both at the party and on social media, to believe that Gunther and Luann are now a couple. Initially breaking up with him, Gunther convinces Bets that he wants to be with her, and the two agree to work their differences out. As a result, Bets decides to delete her social media profiles to show how much she&#x27;s changed.

===Antagonists===
;Tiffany Farrell: Tiffany is Luann&#x27;s nemesis, a physically attractive, but shallow and arrogant cheerleader in school who constantly insults and belittles Luann. Her best friend is Crystal. It is hinted that Luann and Tiffany might have been friends in elementary school, but their relationship changed once they got to Junior High. Luann and Tiffany often battle for the attentions of various boys, with Luann almost always coming out on top. In March 2003, Luann and Tiffany form a brief friendship after winning a volleyball game as a team, but it falls apart due to their ongoing rivalry over Aaron. Tiffany uses her cell phone camera to take a picture of Luann changing in the girls locker room, initially, trying to blackmail Luann. When Luann fails to cooperate, Tiffany posts the photo on the internet, embarrassing Luann. With Gunther&#x27;s help, Luann causes Tiffany to be suspended. In January 2008, her title of Miss Chamber of Commerce is revoked due to her role in T.J.&#x27;s catering scheme to sell meals in fire stations. In January 2009, she helps Luann fund Delta&#x27;s accompanying them to Washington, DC; Tiffany&#x27;s help is short-lived, however. In 2011, she stages a school beauty pageant, the proceeds of which help pay for new bathroom mirrors. Despite liking attractive boys, Tiffany tells Crystal that she never had an actual boyfriend. However, in 2015, she develops a physical attraction to Gunther, her &quot;study buddy.&quot; By 2017, Tiffany is struggling with weight gain, brought on by depression. Meanwhile, Tiffany and Luann experience something of a truce late in the year, and have since been less hostile to each other. While in college, Tiffany has started to show some signs of maturity, but still occasionally is completely self-absorbed. Tiffany currently works as a waitress in the DeGroots&#x27; restaurant, and is roommates with Bets.

;Crystal: Tiffany&#x27;s only friend though not exactly an antagonist. Although Crystal wears abundant cosmetics, her Goth clothing does not follow the trendy fashions Tiffany wears. However, there are hints of lingering affection between them. She has a handicapped brother named Josh, who looked up to Zane as a mentor. She and Bernice formed a rivalry for Zane&#x27;s affection, similar to the rivalry between Luann and Tiffany. When Zane began mentoring her brother Josh, she developed a crush on him. During this time, she attempted to occupy as much of Zane&#x27;s free time as possible leaving him none to spend with Bernice, which added to Bernice&#x27;s insecurity at the time. In an August 16, 2003 strip she is shown with a star tattoo on her back. She hangs out with Knute a lot, neither one caring what the world thinks of them together or individually, though any romance between them remains subtextual at best.

;Dirk: Toni&#x27;s jealous former boyfriend and Brad&#x27;s main rival for Toni Daytona&#x27;s affections. He has been emotionally abusive toward Toni and physically violent to Brad, and displays severe anger problems. A common boast is that he plans to, or will be, attending the police academy, but it has been pointed out that he has a felony conviction which would automatically disqualify him. While he did not originally view Brad as a threat, when Brad offered to give Toni a ride home after class, Dirk chased after them, causing a car crash in which he was injured. Ironically, Brad resuscitated him in time. Since then, Dirk became more possessive of Toni, foreshadowing their eventual break-up. After striking Brad at his Fire Academy Graduation Ceremony, he was arrested, and a restraining order was issued ordering him to stay away from Brad. Following his release from jail, he took a mandatory anger management course, but he has continuously violated the restraining order (since October 2005). Unwilling to accept Toni dumping him, he continuously stalked her and tried to impress her with shallow gimmicks to try to win her back. In the beginning of May 2006, he was sent back to jail because Brad called the police on him for violating his restraining order.

:Dirk returned to the strip as a garbage collector on September 6, 2010 but claims to be working that job only until he starts at the police academy. Shortly after doing so, when Nancy fell off a ladder while doing housework, he helped pick her up. Later in the strip&#x27;s run, his transformation was proven when he coincidentally ran into Toni at the local grocery store — with his new wife and child. He explains that his anger-management courses did wonders for him, and he met his now-wife through them, and now lives an honest life with his new family.

;Derek: Bernice&#x27;s first love interest. Derek initially hit on Bernice and asked her to let him store his gym clothes in her locker. Unaware that Derek&#x27;s interest in her was only to find a safe place to hide his stash of marijuana in her locker, Bernice fell for him instantly. However, when Bernice discovered drugs in Derek&#x27;s bag while going through her locker, she was about to turn him in until he &quot;seduced&quot; her with a kiss. While giving Bernice a ride home, Derek almost crashed, as he was under the influence. Bernice got out of the car, but not before dumping his stash of drugs into the street. He appeared again for a short time in May 1989 when he declared how much he loved Delta, and he loved Bernice as a &#x27;friend&#x27;. Delta was not impressed. Derek has not appeared since.

;Ann Eiffel: Former manager of Borderline Books and former manager of Weenie World. On numerous occasions her name shown to be a pun on the phrase, &quot;an eyeful&quot;.

:Eiffel initially hired Bernice as an employee at Borderline. When Bernice began working with Zane, one of the store&#x27;s supervisors, Eiffel became very jealous of their relationship and even threatened to fire them if they continued seeing each other. Bernice suspected Eiffel wanted to seduce Zane, but she was actually interested in Bernice instead. Eiffel often interrupted Bernice&#x27;s tasks by making Bernice bring her lattes; this was either to keep her away from Zane or to gratify herself by making Bernice run her personal errands, a maneuver she repeated in later appearances. When she fired Zane, Bernice developed a very rebellious attitude toward her, which led to Eiffel increasing her harassing efforts to intimidate her, until Borderline CEO Jim Hernandez, who knew Zane very well, arranged to transfer Eiffel to the new bookstore in Tokyo, Japan. On July 12, 2011, she resurfaced as the manager of the local Weenie World restaurant, where Brad applied for work after being laid off by the Fire Department. In 2012, T.J. began working at Weenie World to take Ann Eiffel down. She fired him on January 5, 2013 after he made a recording of Eiffel saying she cons people. He made a second recording in the process of being fired that had Eiffel saying that she took credit for all his sales. He saved both recordings despite Eiffel attempting to delete them. Before leaving, Eiffel kissed T.J., who was not impressed. She returned in August 2017 and was revealed as Leslie Knox&#x27;s mother. Ann also began dating Tiffany&#x27;s father Tom in January 2018. They were engaged until it was revealed in July 2020 that Ann had tricked Tiffany&#x27;s father into thinking she was pregnant, at which point Tom broke up with Ann.

;Leslie Knox: The sleazy and arrogant bully of Pitts High School, and the nephew of Mr. Gray. Leslie Knox (who always demands to be known as &quot;Les&quot;) is a potential stalker of Rosa Aragones. Gunther, who witnessed him harassing Rosa, defended her by swinging his backpack around and twice knocked Les down, supposedly by accident. Les attempted to retaliate but Miss Phelps broke up the confrontation. Les then made an offer to Rosa: if she let him kiss her, he would refrain from taking revenge on Gunther. He has also been seen hitting on Tiffany and extorting money from younger students in the hallways. He reappeared in 2016 when his uncle Mr. Gray sought to get him a job at The Fuse. Since starting he has created a charade of charities to earn extra money on the side. Following the wedding of Brad and Toni, he talked The Fuse employees into doing a gift exchange, as a means of making his move on fellow employee, Prudence, unaware that she is actually a lesbian. When he does learn this fact however, in a surprising show of depth, he accepts it without much fuss, and appears to remain friends with her.

:While it has not actually been confirmed, comments by high school counselor Mrs. Phelps about him being the &quot;lowest achiever&quot; and his absence from the 2014 high school graduation imply that he failed to graduate from high school, an indication of his uncle&#x27;s insistence on remaining employed with the Fuse. Also, his uncle has implied he owes court fines/fees. It has been revealed that his mother is Ann Eiffel, and that they have had a falling out in the past. On October 14, 2017 it was revealed that Leslie&#x27;s court fines/fees stem from his running up his mother&#x27;s $5,000 credit card and Ann successfully suing for restitution.

:First appearance: January 28, 2012

;Stefani Bird: Commonly referred to as Stef, she is Tiffany&#x27;s roommate at Moony University after having to downsize to a shared dorm, though she ends up moving along with Tiffany to a 4-person dorm with Bets and Dez. She is infamous for demanding her roommates bend over backwards to accommodate her wishes, using their beauty products without asking, and even once demanded one of them give her $600 to attend a cheerleading competition. Is dating football player Kip, whom Tiffany is obsessed with seducing away from her. She serves as the strip&#x27;s replacement &quot;evil cheerleader&quot; archetype since Tiffany&#x27;s character development, as everyone in the strip except Kip despises her (though they continue living with her each semester.) She is rarely seen in an outfit other than her cheerleading uniform.

:First appearance: February 1, 2020

===School and faculty===
;Mr. Fogarty: The school history teacher. He secretly loves Miss Phelps. Mr. Fogarty&#x27;s character was created before &quot;Luann&quot;. His character starred in &quot;Fogarty&quot;, which was distributed free of charge to several high school newspapers in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mr. Fogarty announced that he will retire from teaching at the end of the school year in the May 4, 2014 strip.

:First mentioned: May 8, 1985.

:First appearance: September 11, 1985.

:Last appearance: May 24, 2014.

;Miss Margo Phelps: The school&#x27;s incompetent guidance counselor. She had never been married during her tenure at the school, and often compared Luann to her cat while she was having relationship problems. She secretly loves Mr. Fogarty, and marries him sometime after the cast graduates from high school, later going into private practice.

:First appearance: April 8, 1985.

;Miss Allison: The school P.E. teacher. She, like all other fitness teachers, is a strict disciplinarian. Out of all the teachers Luann knows well at Pitts High School, Miss Allison seems to be the only one Luann looks up to as a mentor figure.

:First appearance: April 30, 1986 (voice), May 19, 1992 (drawn).

;Principal Hightower: The principal of Pitts High School. Usually his face is never seen, only his hands when they are placed on his desk. His face may have been seen in a flashback as Luann&#x27;s elementary school principal in the October 9, 2002 and October 10, 2002, comics, but it is unknown whether this is the same Principal Hightower, or perhaps a relative or someone with the same last name.

===Emergency medical services===

;Captain Newman: The disciplined, strict disciplinarian and straightforward Firefighter Captain of Fire Station No. 3, and Brad&#x27;s superior officer. Brad first met him when he began the physical exam for Fire Academy. He has assigned Brad and Toni to take Reddy to local schools on more than one occasion, and has assigned Brad to his tasks of his rank as a firefighter. After a firefighters&#x27; ball was announced, the Captain was speaking to someone on the phone and saying he planned to take Toni with him. However, he was referring to taking his friend, Tony Gale; which is somewhat ambiguous, as (in the next strip) Brad remarks, &quot;So the captain&#x27;s...&quot; – &quot;not asking me,&quot; Toni interrupts. Whether Tony is a male or female is left to the reader&#x27;s imagination, apparently.

:In a recent 2011 storyline, due to budget cuts, the Captain had to let one firefighter go, and because Brad was the most recent hired firefighter, the Captain, very regretfully, had to let him go, until the departure of another firefighter resulted in an opening.

:First appearance: June 7, 2004

;EMT Supervisor: Brad&#x27;s supervisor during his six months of EMT service before taking his Paramedics class. As gracious as he was about Brad fearlessly saving Zane from dying in the fires of the Borderline Bookstore, he had to file a reprimand on Brad&#x27;s record for violating safety rules, acting outside his training scope, and not wearing proper safety gear. Like the Fire Station Captain, his name is not given.

:First appearance: August 3, 2002

===Animals===

;Puddles: Luann&#x27;s dog, so named for his tendency to wee in the wrong spots.

:First appearance: December 26, 1985.

;Monroe: Zane&#x27;s dog and special canine companion. He is a Golden Retriever and has grown to be a very faithful companion for Zane.

;Reddy: The Fire Station Mascot. He is a small, 3-foot, Fire Truck, with a remote controller and a built in speaker connected to a microphone and head set, to appear as though he is speaking with his partner. Brad and Toni have brought him to local elementary schools on more than one occasion to demonstrate the importance of fire safety. Brad provides the voice for Reddy and uses Reddy as a means to flirt with Toni. Brad has also used Reddy as a means to speak more openly with Toni. When Brad turned in Dirk and was arguing with Toni about it, he expressed his frustration through Reddy leading to an embarrassing encounter during a school presentation. Afterward, he told the Captain he no longer wants to perform as Reddy to create space between him and Toni.

:First appearance: June 6, 2005

;Cuddles: Luann&#x27;s cat, an addition to the strip (the storyline has Frank DeGroot being allergic to cats; thus, Luann must keep the two separated). Luann gave Cuddles to Mrs. Horner, to spare her father from his allergies. While Puddles showed some hatred towards Cuddles mainly over territory and attention from Luann matters, he also showed some love as they have cuddled and slept together a few times. Cuddles&#x27; original name was Sassy, until Mrs. Horner found a better name as Cuddles.

:First appearance: November 1, 2005

;Punk: Les Knox&#x27;s cat.

===Celebrity cameos===
:Clay Aiken, Jay Leno and Ben Affleck, Hugh Hefner, Barack Obama, Luke Perry, Bill Gates and Ricky Martin.

==Topics==
The strip has attained a degree of notoriety for its mixing of real-life topics with the lightness of being a teen in high school. Evans has sprinkled in such topics as Luann&#x27;s concerns about her first menstruation, Dirk&#x27;s jealousy (which has led to emotional abuse of Toni and physical violence toward Brad), birth control, drunk driving, handicaps, and other social/policy issues that are of interest to young people. Evans drew praise and some criticism in 1998 for a series of strips about Delta contracting Hodgkin lymphoma. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the character of Brad was inspired by the actions of the FDNY to become a firefighter, and there have been extended storylines following him. On November 14, 2001, the satirical newspaper &quot;The Onion&quot; ran a story supposedly detailing Evans&#x27; struggle to address the events of 9/11 in his strip.

==Aging of the characters==
While most comic strips use a floating timeline and keep characters the same age for prolonged periods of time, the characters in Luann have aged over time, albeit not in real time.

From 1985 to 1999, Luann was vaguely in the eighth grade. According to Evans&#x27; blog, Luann was 13 in 1999. This younger era of &quot;Luann&quot; focused on topics among children in junior high school and within Luann&#x27;s family at home. Since 1999 Luann has been slowly aging from 15 to 16 years old at perhaps the rate of one &quot;Luann&quot; month per one reader year, though this opposes what Evans has said on his blog. In the fall of 2013, it was made clear that Luann and her peers were seniors in high school, suggesting that the characters are around 17 years old and preparing for college. In June, 2014, Greg and Karen Evans ran a story arc in which the high school characters attended their graduation. Luann is attending college as of September 3, 2014. On September 28, 2014, Greg Evans and his daughter Karen made an appearance in the strip, wishing Luann a happy 18th birthday.

==&quot;Luann Againn&quot;==
On March 17, 2013, GoComics began republishing old strips under the title &quot;Luann Againn&quot;, starting with the first strip, dated March 17, 1985.

==Musical==
In 2006, Evans—with the help of arranger/orchestrator Justin Gray—wrote a musical based on the strip, titled &quot;Luann: Scenes in a Teen&#x27;s Life&quot;, produced by Center ARTES and performed at the California Center for the Arts in Escondido, California. It was performed by local drama students from Rancho Buena Vista High School. An original cast recording, titled &quot;Scenes in a Teen&#x27;s Life&quot;, was made. In March 2008, Palomar College, in San Marcos, California performed this musical. It was the musical&#x27;s college theater debut. &quot;Luann: Scenes In A Teen&#x27;s Life&quot; was next scheduled to be performed by Huntington Beach Playhouse in August 2008. Its South San Diego High School debut was in May 2010.

<doc id="685369" wikidata="Q4982964" url="?curid=685369" title="Buck Weaver">
<text>George Daniel &quot;Buck&quot; Weaver (August 18, 1890 – January 31, 1956) was an American shortstop and third baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago White Sox. Weaver played for the 1917 World Series champion White Sox, then was one of the eight players banned from the Major Leagues for his connection to the 1919 Black Sox Scandal.

==Baseball career==
Weaver was born in Pottstown, Pennsylvania, to Daniel Weaver and Susan Snell and began his major league career on April 11, 1912, as a shortstop for the White Sox. Weaver switched to third base in 1917 after Swede Risberg joined the team.

An excellent fielder, Weaver was known as the only third baseman in the league against whom Ty Cobb would not bunt. He led the majors in sacrifice hits in 1915 and 1916.

In the famous 1919 World Series, Weaver batted .324, tallying 11 hits.

After the Series was over, many suspicious reporters made allusions to a possible fix. However some sportswriters praised Weaver for his efforts all along during the World Series. Ross Tenney of the &quot;Cincinnati Post&quot; wrote:
Though they are hopeless and heartless, the White Sox have a hero. He is George Weaver, who plays and fights at third base. Day after day Weaver has done his work and smiled. In spite of the certain fate that closed about the hopes of the Sox, Weaver smiled and scrapped. One by one his mates gave up. Weaver continued to grin and fought harder….Weaver&#x27;s smile never faded. His spirit never waned….The Reds have beaten the spirit out of the Sox all but Weaver. Buck&#x27;s spirit is untouched. He was ready to die fighting. Buck is Chicago&#x27;s one big hero; long may he fight and smile.

Despite this, Weaver was banned by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis for having knowledge of the fix and failing to tell team officials.

==Reinstatement attempts==

Weaver successfully sued White Sox owner Charles Comiskey for his 1921 salary. When Shoeless Joe Jackson did the same, the jury voted 11–1 in favor of Jackson. However, the judge set aside the jury verdict after Comiskey produced Jackson&#x27;s grand jury testimony about the fix. Despite this success, however, Comiskey made no attempt to offer the confessions as evidence to obtain a similar ruling against Weaver.

Weaver applied six times for reinstatement to baseball before his death from a heart attack on January 31, 1956, at the age of 65. The first time was on January 13, 1922, when Weaver unsuccessfully applied for reinstatement, which was rejected by Landis. One notable attempt to get reinstated came in 1927 in the wake of Tris Speaker/Ty Cobb betting scandal. Once again, Landis rejected it, with Landis telling a group of Weaver supporters that his presence at the meetings with the gamblers was sufficient to bar him.

After this attempt failed, Weaver returned to Chicago and decided to play in the minor leagues again. Later in life, Weaver contacted a New York City attorney who vowed to get him reinstated. Weaver sent his legal papers and correspondence to New York; however, they were never returned. To this day, baseball historians have been unable to find Weaver&#x27;s legal files.

In 1953, just three years before his death, Buck applied for reinstatement one last time to Commissioner Ford Frick, which was ignored. The letter Weaver wrote to Frick is prominently displayed in Cooperstown’s Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Legacy==

Many parts of the story portrayed in the 1988 movie &quot;Eight Men Out&quot; are told from Buck Weaver&#x27;s point of view, with Weaver being played by John Cusack. Harry Stein also used Weaver as a co-narrator in his critically acclaimed Black Sox novel &quot;Hoopla&quot; (1983), where Stein&#x27;s Weaver reiterates that his loyalty to his teammates compelled him not to inform baseball authorities about the Series fix.

With the 2005 World Series set to begin and the White Sox about to capture their first championship since 1917, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; columnist Mike Downey implored Commissioner Bud Selig to rescind Weaver&#x27;s ban. His column of October 20, 2005, cited catcher Ray Schalk&#x27;s condemnation of &quot;the seven&quot; Sox in on the fix, not eight. Weaver&#x27;s niece, Pat Anderson, told Downey: &quot;You can&#x27;t understand why someone else would be so obtuse. Some of these commissioners, it&#x27;s like they put a brown paper bag over their heads.&quot;

Another niece, Margarie H. (Cook) Follett, came to the 2003 All-Star Game at the White Sox park to personally appeal to the commissioner for her uncle&#x27;s reinstatement. The &quot;Tribune&quot; reported a quote from Weaver: &quot;There are murderers who serve a sentence and then get out. I got life.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;Sacramento&quot; (AOE-1) was the third ship in the United States Navy to bear the name, for both the river, and the capital city of California. She was the lead ship of her class of fast combat support ship.

She combined the functions of three logistics ships in one hull; fleet oiler (AO), ammunition ship (AE), and refrigerated stores ship (AFS).

Admiral Arleigh Burke originated the concept of a single supply ship system. He saw the design as an answer to logistics problems he encountered during World War II. The limited speed, range, and payload of early underway replenishment (UnRep) groups prevented resupply due to bad weather and tactical demands of the war. To counter these problems, the Fast Combat Support Ship (AOE) was designed.

==Construction==
The keel for the first of the Navy&#x27;s fast combat support ships was laid at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington on 30 June 1961. The traditional champagne bottle was broken against the bow of AOE-1 on 14 September 1963, by the ship&#x27;s sponsor, Mrs. Edmund Brown, wife of the Governor of California.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; was commissioned on 15 March 1964. Undersecretary of the Navy, Paul B. Fay Jr., addressed the crowd, stating, &quot;The greatest pleasure I have in being here today is ... participating in the commissioning of a vessel which will provide the Navy with a unique capability hitherto never contained in one ship.&quot; He added the ship would be able to &quot;run in speed with a destroyer escort, thereby giving our fast attack carrier task forces a flexibility of action hitherto unknown.&quot;

==Service history==

&quot;Sacramento&quot; served in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. She was known as a &quot;floating supermarket&quot; because of all the goods she carried.

The FAST (Fast Automated Shuttle Transfer) cargo handling system originally installed was replaced with the STREAM (Standard Tensioned Replenishment Alongside Method) underway replenishment system in 1977.

Her original armament consisted of four twin 3&quot;/50 caliber guns. The two forward guns were replaced by Mk.29 NATO Sea Sparrow in 1976, and the two aft mounts were replaced by Mk.15 Phalanx CIWS in 1981.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; was deployed to the Persian Gulf and supported operations during the First Gulf War including Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm.

In 1995, MK-23 TAS (Target Acquisition System) was installed to facilitate NSSMS and locate and track air threats.

In 1995 while in the Persian Gulf, the ship assisted in &quot;Operation Southern Watch&quot; and in &quot;Operation Vigilant Sentinel&quot;. During an underway replenishment with the the &quot;Sacramento&quot; lost her steering and collided into the starboard side of the Abraham Lincoln, crushing the M-frames, partially crushing a female crew berthing area, and punching a large hole in the TACAN room of the &quot;Sacramento&quot;. The &quot;Lincoln&quot; sustained damage to her catwalks, an aircraft elevator was jammed into the up position and an approximately 10 ft2 hole was torn into the island. Both ships had to dock at Jebel Ali, U.A.E. for repair, the latter for several weeks.

In 1996 the &quot;Sacramento&quot; had one NATO Sea Sparrow launcher on the forecastle, two Phalanx CIWS past mid-ship port and starboard, one 25 mm automatic cannon on the port side, and four .50 caliber machine guns: two port and two starboard. The ship was also fitted with electronic warfare equipment: an AN/SLQ-32 with four MK.36 super-RBOC (Rapid Bloom Offboard Chaff) decoys, and an AN/SLQ-25 towed torpedo decoy (NIXIE) run by an electronics technician.
&quot;Sacramento&quot; was the first AOE to ever qualify for an electromagnetic interference certificate in 1996.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; decommissioned in October 2004. On 13 April 2007, a contract for the ship&#x27;s disposal was awarded to Esco Marine. &quot;Sacramento&quot; was scrapped by Esco Marine in Brownsville, Texas, early 2008.

==Performance==
&quot;Sacramento&quot; is considered a benchmark in West Coast shipbuilding. The ship and two of her sister ships, and , are the largest ships ever built on the West Coast as of 2005. Only s and aircraft carriers have greater displacements than &quot;Sacramento&quot;.

The ship&#x27;s main engines came from the never-completed battleship , and delivered in excess of 100,000 shaft horsepower (75 MW) to two 23-foot (7 m) screws weighing 19.25 tons each, the largest on any ship in the Navy.

&quot;Sacramento&quot; was the fastest AOE (fast combat support ship) ever. The &quot;Sacramento&quot; routinely went head-to-head in speed runs and won against the west coast&#x27;s AOE&#x27;s, including the
 and the . &quot;Sacramento&quot; also beat the fastest of the east coast AOE&#x27;s, including the &quot;Detroit&quot; (AOE-4) and the in head-to-head competition.

<text>Nothing to Hide is the second and final studio album by In My Eyes. It was released in 2000 by Revelation Records. Showing a somewhat more developed style than that on their first album (&quot;The Difference Between&quot;), this album incorporated more melodic elements, along with some experimentation (e.g. the breakdown on track 8, &quot;On My Side&quot;), a characteristic rare in youth crew hardcore. Track 9, &quot;What&#x27;s Wrong With Me?&quot;, is a cover of the legendary Washington DC hardcore punk band The Faith which originally appeared on the Void/Faith split 12&quot;.

<text>Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing, or TIGER, or TIGER/Line is a format used by the United States Census Bureau to describe physical and cultural features such as roads, highways, city limits, rivers, and lakes, as well as areas such as census tracts. TIGER was developed to support and improve the Bureau&#x27;s process of taking the Decennial Census.

The TIGER files do not contain the census demographic data, but merely the geospatial/map data. GIS can be used to merge census demographics or other data sources with the TIGER files to create maps and conduct analysis. TIGER data is available without cost because U.S. Government publications are required to be released into the public domain.

==Coverage==
The TIGER/Line shapefile data includes complete coverage of the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Midway Islands.

TIGER includes both land features such as roads, rivers, and lakes, as well as areas such as counties, census tracts, and census blocks. Some of the geographic areas represented in TIGER are political areas, including state and federally recognized tribal lands, cities, counties, congressional districts, and school districts. Others are statistical areas, including Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA), census tracts, census block groups, and census blocks. ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) are quasi-statistical areas which attempt to approximate, but do not exactly match, the delivery areas of USPS ZIP codes. ZIP codes are not truly areas, but rather a group of deliverable addresses. Some or all of an existing ZIP code&#x27;s addresses may be reassigned to a new ZIP if there is sufficient growth within a given postal ZIP Code. As many as 3% of ZIP codes undergo change each quarter. Thus, the 5-digit ZCTAs are of limited value in areas of growth or change.

ZIP codes are based on postal delivery routes and may not correspond to municipalities.

==Future==
TIGER data published through February 2007 (2006 Second Edition) were in a custom text-based format formally known as TIGER/Line files. In 2008, data in shapefile format was published. Please note that shapefiles are not topological, therefore may create slivers when comparing TIGER/Line boundaries. This mismatch was not possible when the census TIGER files were available in ASCII format that was topological unlike shapefiles. The Census Bureau has made the data available through WMS servers. The data forms a base for OpenStreetMap in the US, and also was used for the initial import of US map data into the Waze navigation system.

<text>Gorilla Biscuits are an American hardcore punk band from New York City, New York, United States, formed in 1986. The band currently consists of Anthony &quot;Civ&quot; Civarelli, Walter Schreifels, Arthur Smilios and Luke Abbey, and is signed to Revelation Records. Gorilla Biscuits are part of the New York hardcore scene.

Gorilla Biscuits was formed by Smilios and Civ after meeting in high school in Long Island, New York. The band released their self-titled debut album as a 7&quot; in 1988. Gorilla Biscuits released their second album &quot;Start Today&quot; in 1989. &quot;Start Today&quot; gave Gorilla Biscuits underground popularity. They are considered one of the most seminal youth crew bands.

==History==
===Early days (1987)===
Gorilla Biscuits were formed when Arthur Smilios and Nick Drysdale met Anthony &quot;Civ&quot; Civarelli while they were both attending the same high school in Queens, New York. All three were fans of the band Agnostic Front, and started going to hardcore shows at CBGB on weekends. There they met people like Ray Cappo and John Porcelly of the band Youth of Today.

Smilios sought to form a hardcore band and asked Civ to act as vocalist. However Civ was not interested in singing, and had to face the floor or wall during early gigs due to nerves. Members of the band Token Entry arranged a gig for the still unnamed band (Gorilla Biscuits used Token Entry&#x27;s drummer, Ernie Parada for that first show), but needed a name to give it to the promoter. A popular drug in the area at that time was quaaludes, which people called &quot;ape shit,&quot; or &quot;gorilla biscuits&quot; due to the pill&#x27;s large size. Eventually the name evolved into Gorilla Biscuits, and though it was initially only meant to be temporary, they have continued to use it.

The band made a number of low-fi demo tapes which were sold at a dollar store. Their first official T-shirts were blue with an image of a gorilla riding a skateboard and were made using black magic markers and an ink blotter.

===&quot;Gorilla Biscuits&quot; and &quot;Start Today&quot; (1988–1991)===
Revelation Records featured the early Gorilla Biscuits song &quot;Better Than You&quot; on one of their compilations, and later released the eponymously titled &quot;Gorilla Biscuits&quot; 7-inch EP in 1988, which later became a hardcore hit. The band toured the United States and Europe twice. In 1989, the band released their first full-length album, &quot;Start Today&quot;, which became the biggest selling ever for Revelation Records, and was also the first album that the label issued on CD, alongside its vinyl and cassette versions, as part of the routine production. The band started writing material for a second LP (an unreleased song, &quot;Distance&quot;, can be seen played by the band during a performance in the 1991 documentary &quot;Live In New York&quot;) which they never recorded, and eventually disbanded around the year 1992. Some of the members went on to play in a follow-up band, CIV. Besides singing for CIV, Civ now owns a tattoo studio on Long Island. Walter went on to form the post-hardcore band Quicksand. He then wrote the songs for and helped produce CIV&#x27;s first album.

===Reunions and the future of Gorilla Biscuits (1992–present)===
Gorilla Biscuits re-united for one show in October 1997 at CBGB to benefit the family of then recently deceased Warzone singer Raybeez, and played another show at CBGB on August 14, 2005 as a benefit towards the club&#x27;s legal costs, and again on September 3, 2006.

In 2006, Revelation Records re-issued their seminal recording &quot;Start Today&quot;. The album is re-mastered and features in-depth liner notes by Walter Schreifels. The band held a month-long re-union tour during the summer of 2006, and featured both exclusive 7-inches and exclusive Paul Frank T-shirts only available on tour stops.

In September 2007, Gorilla Biscuits performed a month-long tour across Europe, including stops in Germany, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and England. In celebration of the European Tour, Paul Frank collaborated with Gorilla Biscuits again to produce an exclusive run of Gorilla Biscuits wallets. Only one was sold at each Paul Frank store worldwide.

On May 28, 2011, Gorilla Biscuits headlined the Black N Blue Bowl at Webster Hall (formerly the Ritz) in New York City.

On June 8, 9 and 10 2012, Gorilla Biscuits played the Epic Revelation Records 25 Year Anniversary shows at The Glasshouse in Pomona, CA. Also on the bills were Youth of Today, Sick Of It All, Shai Hulud, Bold, No For An Answer, Statue and Underdog.

On August 6, 2016, during Gorilla Biscuits&#x27; set at Philadelphia&#x27;s This Is Hardcore festival, Civarelli took a break to introduce the song &quot;Degradation&quot; that rails against nazis in the 1980s punk scene. He also commented on the Black Lives Matter movement, saying:

In 2016 people still have to wear shirts that say &#x27;Black Lives Matter&#x27;. No shit. Brown, white, yellow, black, we all fucking matter. Everybody here matters. Do not let the media, schools, institutions, influence you. We are one family, one people.

Apparently, the statement did not sit well with some attendees at the festival who understood the speech as an endorsement of the anti-Black Lives Matter movement &#x27;All Lives Matter&#x27;. Later, Civarelli said on his Facebook that the controversy had been a gross misunderstanding of his words:

“…I’m surprised that this was taken in any other way then it was intended. My point was and I thought it was clear that in 2016 we as a people should not need such things to be on a shirt and they should be universal truths. We are all in this together. If you know the band and the lyrics and what we have always stood for this should be clear. Also look at the lyrics to “degradation” and “things we say” especially the line, “some people are so quick to judge let’s get the judgement straight”…”

<text>The You&#x27;re Only Young Once... EP was the only release from the hardcore punk band Side by Side. It was released as Revelation Records number 5 in 1988. Nine years later, it was rereleased as a 22-song LP. The Revelation 5b LP release was meant to combat a popular bootleg with much of the same material.

The total pressing of the EP was just over six thousand black vinyl copies, in three equal pressings, with 17 extra in the first pressing. The LP had only one pressing of 1109 black vinyl and 100 blue vinyl, although it is still in print on CD.

<text>John Bidwell (August 5, 1819 – April 4, 1900), known in Spanish as Don Juan Bidwell, was an American pioneer, politician, and soldier. Bidwell is known as the founder of the city of Chico, California.

Born in New York, he emigrated at the age of 22 to Alta California (then a part of Mexico) as part of the Bartleson–Bidwell Party, one of the first expeditions of American emigrants along the California Trail. In California, he became a Mexican citizen and a prominent landowner, receiving multiple rancho grants from the governors of Alta California. Following the U.S. Conquest of California, Bidwell went on to serve in the California Senate and then in the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Early life==
Bidwell was born in 1819 in Chautauqua County, New York. His Bidwell ancestors immigrated to North America in the colonial era. His family moved to Erie, Pennsylvania, in 1829, and then to Ashtabula County, Ohio, in 1831. At age 17, he attended and shortly thereafter became principal of Kingsville Academy.

==Life in California==

In 1841, at the age of 22, Bidwell became one of the first emigrants on the California Trail. John Sutter employed Bidwell as his business manager shortly after the younger man reached California. In October 1844, Bidwell went with Sutter to Monterey, where the two learned of an insurrection by leader José Castro and ex-governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. In 1845, Bidwell and Sutter joined Governor Manuel Micheltorena and a group of Americans and Indians to fight the insurrectionists, pursuing them to Cahuenga. Micheltorena, Sutter, and Bidwell were imprisoned, and the latter two were shortly thereafter released.

Upon release, Bidwell headed north through Placerita Canyon, saw the mining operations, and was determined to search for gold on his way to Sutter&#x27;s Fort, where he met James W. Marshall. Shortly after Marshall&#x27;s discovery of gold at Sutter&#x27;s Mill, Bidwell also discovered gold on the Feather River, establishing a productive claim at Bidwell Bar in advance of the California Gold Rush. Bidwell obtained the four square-league Rancho Los Ulpinos land grant after being naturalized as a Mexican citizen in 1844, and the two square-league Rancho Colus grant on the Sacramento River in 1845. He later sold the latter grant and bought Rancho Arroyo Chico on Chico Creek to establish a ranch and farm.

Soon after the outbreak of the Mexican–American War, Bidwell met with the leaders of the Bear Flag Revolt and drafted their constitution. He later attained the rank of major while fighting at Fort Stockton. In August 1846, he was appointed Alcalde of Mission San Luis Rey by John C. Frémont, where he served until the end of the war. He was appointed brigadier general of the California Militia in 1863. From 1863 to 1864, Bidwell and other local financiers built the Humboldt Wagon Road connecting Chico to the mining districts of Nevada. Around this time, in 1865, General Bidwell backed a petition from settlers at Red Bluff, California to protect Red Bluff&#x27;s trail to the Owyhee Mines of Idaho. The United States Army commissioned seven forts for this purpose. One site was near Fandango Pass at the base of the Warner Mountains, in the north end of Surprise Valley. On June 10, 1865, what was named Fort Bidwell was ordered to be built there. The fort was built amid escalating fighting with the Snake Indians of eastern Oregon and southern Idaho. It was a base for US Army operations in the Snake War, that lasted until 1868, and the later Modoc War. Although traffic dwindled on the Red Bluff route once the Central Pacific Railroad extended into Nevada in 1868, the Army staffed Fort Bidwell until 1890 to quell various uprisings and disturbances. A Paiute reservation and small community maintain the name Fort Bidwell.

On February 5, 1856, Bidwell was one of several passengers traveling down the Sacramento River on the steamboat &quot;Belle&quot; when the ship&#x27;s boiler exploded, killing several people instantly. Bidwell was sitting by the stove reading a newspaper when the explosion sent a piece of shrapnel the size of a quarter directly into his skull. Bidwell survived, but spent the rest of his life with a visible hole in his head.

==Political career==
Bidwell was selected as a delegate to the 1849 California Constitutional Convention, but did not attend because of mining business. Later that year, he was elected to the California State Senate, serving a single one-year term. He ran for State Senate again in 1855, but lost to incumbent Know Nothing John B. McGee by just 187 votes. He supervised conducting the federal census of California in 1850 and 1860, under national direction by Joseph C. G. Kennedy. Bidwell was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston. He was the only West Coast delegate opposed to secession. He left the party soon after the outbreak of the Civil War, and in 1864 was a delegate to the National Union National Convention. That year, he was also elected to the House of Representatives as a Republican, serving from 1865 to 1867. Rather than seek re-election, he chose to run for Governor of California in 1867, but due to his anti-monopoly stance lost the Union Party nomination to railroad lobbyist George Congdon Gorham by a vote of 167 to 132.

In 1875, Bidwell ran for Governor of California on the Anti-Monopoly Party ticket. As a strong advocate of the temperance movement, he presided over the state convention of the Prohibition Party in 1888 and was their nominee for governor in 1890. In the 1892 presidential election, Bidwell was the nominee of the Prohibition Party. The ticket of Bidwell and James B. Cranfill of Texas finished fourth nationwide, receiving 271,058 votes, or 2.3%. It was the largest total vote and highest percentage of the vote received by any Prohibition Party national ticket. Their strongest result was in Minnesota, where they received over five percent of the vote.

John Bidwell&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Echoes of the Past&quot;, was published in 1900. That same year, on April 4, Bidwell died of natural causes at the age of 80.

==Personal life==

In 1868 Bidwell was about 49 when he married Annie Kennedy, whom he had courted for years. She was 20 years younger and a daughter of Joseph C. G. Kennedy. Her father was socially prominent, a high-ranking Washington official who supervised the U.S. Census Bureau. Bidwell had met him while working on the California census. The senior Kennedy was active in the U.S. Whig party. Annie Kennedy was deeply religious, joining the Presbyterian Church, and committed to a number of moral and social causes. She was very active in the suffrage and prohibition movements.

The couple married April 16, 1868, in Washington, D.C., with President Andrew Johnson and future president Ulysses S. Grant among the guests. After he returned with her to Chico, the Bidwells used their mansion extensively for entertainment of friends and official guests. Among them were President Rutherford B. Hayes, General William T. Sherman, Susan B. Anthony, Frances Willard, Governor Leland Stanford, John Muir, Joseph Dalton Hooker, and Asa Gray.

==Legacy==
The Bidwell Family Papers are held at the Bancroft Library.

The actor Howard Negley (1898–1983) played Bidwell in the 1953 episode, &quot;The Lady with the Blue Silk Umbrella&quot; on the syndicated television anthology series, &quot;Death Valley Days,&quot; hosted by Stanley Andrews. In the story line, Helen Crosby (Kathleen Case) carries official California statehood papers in her umbrella to shield them from ruffians who want to destroy the documents. Rick Vallin played Lieutenant Bob Hastings.

==Fraternal allegiance==
Bidwell was a Freemason for a time but left the group. He said that allegiance to the fraternity &quot;was pointless&quot; in an October 17, 1867, letter to Annie Kennedy, whom he had been courting. His signature appears in the Book of By-Laws of the Chico-Leland Stanford Lodge No. 111 in Chico, California.

<text>David A. Catania (born January 16, 1968) is an American politician and lawyer from Washington, D.C. He was formerly an at-large member of the Council of the District of Columbia, which he gave up to pursue an unsuccessful run in the 2014 mayoral election.

==Early life and education==
Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Catania is a graduate of Georgetown University&#x27;s School of Foreign Service and Georgetown University Law Center.

==D.C. Council==
He was elected to the council as a Republican in a 1997 special election with 7% voter turnout, but elected to a full term in 1998, and re-elected in 2002 and 2006. Catania lives in the Dupont Circle neighborhood.

Catania was the first openly gay member of the D.C. Council and one of a small number of openly gay Republican office-holders. This led to a conflict within his party when President George W. Bush spoke in favor of an amendment to the United States Constitution to ban same-sex marriage. Catania opposed the amendment and became a vocal opponent of Bush&#x27;s 2004 re-election. In response, the District of Columbia Republican Committee decertified him as a delegate to the 2004 Republican National Convention. Catania announced his endorsement of the Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, one week prior to the convention. In September 2004, Catania left the party and became an independent, citing his displeasure with its direction on urban and social issues. He was re-elected in 2006 and 2010 as an independent.

Catania was most recently the chairperson of the council&#x27;s Committee on Education and was a member of the Committee on Government Operations, the Committee on Finance and Revenue, and the Committee on Health. Catania chaired the Committee on Health between 2005 and 2012. As one of two openly gay members then serving on the council, Catania played a major role in the city&#x27;s recognition of same-sex unions and legalization of same-sex marriage.

===Positions===

Catania opposed terms limits for elected officials. In 2001, Catania voted in favor of legislation that overturned the results of a popular referendum limiting members of the D.C. Council to two terms.

==Post-Council career==

In 2014, Catania was unsuccessful in a bid for mayor of Washington, D.C. In 2015, he joined the international law firm Greenberg Traurig, where he focuses his practice on healthcare, government law and strategy, and public policy.

In 2018, he served as the U.S. Head of Public Affairs for Starship Technologies, a robotic delivery company. In February, Catania opened a District-based lobbying firm with Benjamin Young, his former chief of staff and campaign manager.

In 2018, Catania was campaign co-chair for S. Kathryn Allen, a former insurance executive who sought Catania&#x27;s former seat on the council, held by Elissa Silverman. An investigation determined that more than half of Allen&#x27;s signatures were fraudulently collected and her name was not included on the ballot.

==Personal life ==
Catania married floral designer Bill Enright on August 5, 2017, in a ceremony officiated by his former Council colleague Mary Cheh. Catania and Enright finalized their divorce on July 21, 2021.

<text>SS &quot;Atlantus&quot; is the most famous of the twelve concrete ships built by the Liberty Ship Building Company in Brunswick, Georgia, United States, during and after World War I.

The steamer was launched on 5 December 1918, and was the second concrete ship constructed in the World War I Emergency Fleet. The war had ended a month earlier, and so work on completing her was put on slow. She completed her sea trials (a 400-500 mile trip) and sailed to Wilmington, Delaware on her maiden voyage on 26 May 1919 for final touches, prior to sailing for New York. The Liberty Ship Building Company had their headquarters in Wilmington. She was built for service between New York and the West Indies.

The &quot;Atlantus&quot; was used to transport American troops back home from Europe and also to transport coal in New England. After two years of service, the ship was retired in 1920 to a salvage yard in Virginia.

In 1926, Colonel Jesse Rosenfeld purchased the &quot;Atlantus&quot; for use in the creation of a ferry dock (for a route now served by the Cape May – Lewes Ferry) out of her and two of her sister ships. The plan was to dig a channel to the shore where the &quot;Atlantus&quot; would be placed, and the other two ships would be placed in a Y formation, creating a slip for a ferry to dock. In March 1926, the groundbreaking ceremonies were held for the construction of the ferry dock. The &quot;Atlantus&quot; was repaired and towed to Cape May. On June 8 of the same year, a storm hit and the ship broke free of her moorings and ran aground 150 feet off the coast of Sunset Beach. Several attempts were made to free the ship, but none were successful.

At one time there was a billboard painted on the side of the ship advertising boat insurance. Since her sinking, her slowly deteriorating hull has drawn tourists, although little of her is left visible above the water line. The wreckage is currently split in three pieces. The stern is the most visible section, the middle is completely submerged, and the bow can only be viewed at low tide.

<text>In England and Wales local government legislation, a principal area is one of the sub-national areas established for control by a principal council. They include most of the areas governed by the lowest level of local government above that of Parish or Community council.

==England==
In England the principal areas are defined by the Local Government Act 1992 as,
*the non-metropolitan counties
*the districts
*the London boroughs

Note that while the local authority bodies of the City of London, Inner Temple, Middle Temple, civil parishes and the Isles of Scilly are not included within this definition, they otherwise remain defined as &quot;local government areas&quot;.

While the phrase exists as a specific term in legislation such as the 1992 Act to refer to the geographical area governed by a principal council the usual descriptive title otherwise used for such an area is one of County, Borough, District, City.

==Wales==
A principal area in Wales is any one of the areas governed by a unit of local government created by the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 that amended the Local Government Act 1972. The first-named Act allocated the English-language descriptive titles of,
*County or County Borough – one of the subdivisions of Wales

Not all councils include their description as a County or Borough within the name used for normal public presentation, an example being Gwynedd which uses the simple &quot;Gwynedd Council&quot; and/or &quot;Cyngor Gwynedd&quot;, typically combined in logos and headings as the bilingual &quot;Cyngor Gwynedd Council&quot; (with &quot;Gwynedd&quot; emphasised) until 2022, when it dropped the English name to only use &quot;Cyngor Gwynedd&quot; universally.

The plural Welsh translation as used in legislation such as Reg. 2 The Local Authorities (Conduct of Referendums) (Wales) Regulations 2004 is &quot;Prif Ardaloedd&quot;.

<doc id="685411" wikidata="Q958651" url="?curid=685411" title="Once and Again">
<text>Once and Again is an American family drama television series that aired on ABC from September 21, 1999, to April 15, 2002. It depicts the family of a single mother and her romance with a single father. It was created by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick.

One of the show&#x27;s then-unique aspects was the &quot;interview&quot; sequences filmed in black and white and interspersed throughout each episode, where the characters would reveal their innermost thoughts and memories to the camera.

==Premise==
Lily Manning (Sela Ward) is a suburban soccer mom in her forties, who lives in Deerfield, Illinois. Recently separated from her philandering husband Jake (Jeffrey Nordling), Lily is raising her two daughters: insecure, anxiety-ridden 14-year-old Grace (Julia Whelan) and precocious nine-year-old Zoe (Meredith Deane). For support, she turns to her more free-spirited younger sister, Judy (Marin Hinkle), with whom she works at their bookstore called My Sister&#x27;s Bookstore (renamed Booklovers later in the series).

Lily&#x27;s life changes when, during the pilot episode, she meets Rick Sammler (Billy Campbell) in the principal&#x27;s office of Grace&#x27;s school, Upton Sinclair High School.

Rick is a single father and co-head of an architectural firm, Sammler/Cassili Associates, which is located in downtown Chicago. Rick has been divorced from his uptight ex-wife Karen (Susanna Thompson) for three years and has two children: Eli (Shane West), a 16-year-old basketball player at Sinclair High who suffers from a learning disability and sensitive 12-year-old Jessie (Evan Rachel Wood), who longs for the days before her family&#x27;s disintegration.

Lily and Rick share an immediate mutual attraction and begin dating. Their budding relationship causes problems in both of their respective families. Grace strongly objects to Lily and Rick&#x27;s relationship as she still hopes to see her parents get back together. Karen, a public interest attorney at the downtown law firm of Harris, Riegert, and Sammler, is worried about the toll Rick&#x27;s new relationship would take on their children, particularly Jessie, who is shy and emotionally fragile. She is also working through her own feelings of jealousy that Rick is moving on to a new relationship.

In addition to Lily and Rick&#x27;s relationship, the show also focused to a lesser degree on their exes, Jake and Karen, and their own struggles to move on in a post-divorce environment.

==Plot summary==

===Season 1===
Lily is in the process of divorcing her restaurateur husband, Jake. She is reluctant to begin dating again due to the sensitivities of her daughters, who are still emotional about the divorce. She meets and is instantly attracted to divorced architect Rick Sammler. However, their new relationship is complicated by Lily&#x27;s many remaining emotional and financial issues with Jake. Lily must navigate the complicated worlds of divorce, finding herself in midlife, and reentering the workforce. She is able to find strength and resilience as she affirms her marriage to Jake is over, starts a new job as a publishing assistant at the magazine Pages Alive, and grows in her relationship with Rick. Grace and Eli become close when she becomes his tutor. Judy has a relationship with Rick&#x27;s friend, Sam Blue (Steven Weber) before discovering Sam is married.

===Season 2===
Lily and Jake&#x27;s divorce is finalized and she hopes to spend more time with Rick. However, Rick becomes sidetracked by difficulties at work and has to begin working with unscrupulous developer Miles Drentell (David Clennon, reprising his role from the series &quot;thirtysomething&quot;). Things become difficult for Lily when Rick&#x27;s project runs into legal difficulties and his ex-wife Karen is hired to represent the opposition. Jessie flirts with an eating disorder and begins to address her problems with the help of a therapist (played by show producer Edward Zwick). Jake&#x27;s girlfriend Tiffany announces she is pregnant. At the end of season two, Rick has to dissolve his architectural firm, and Lily and Rick get married.

===Season 3===
Rick resumes his partnership with Sam Blue, now divorced, to design a hotel for a new client. Sam and Judy try to be friends but eventually resume their romantic relationship. Jake and Tiffany have a baby girl and eventually decide to get married. Grace develops a crush on her English teacher, Mr. Dimitri (Eric Stoltz); although their relationship never became sexual, an investigation eventually forces Mr. Dimitri to leave the school. Meanwhile, Jessie discovers she is attracted to another girl: upperclassman Katie Singer (Mischa Barton), and after Katie acknowledges her own romantic feelings towards Jessie with a love letter, the two girls quietly begin dating while hiding their romance from everyone, in what became the first teen lesbian romance on American network television. Karen deals with her depression; just as she is starting to make progress, she is hit by a car, leading to months of painful rehabilitation where she meets physical therapist Henry Higgins (D. B. Woodside). Lily faces more painful domestic struggles when her mother begins to show signs of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and her brother Aaron (Patrick Dempsey), who is schizophrenic, wants to move in with his girlfriend. By the end of the season, Rick and Lily face big decisions when he is offered a job in Australia and she is offered a nationally syndicated radio show. Their decisions are never shown, but in the last moments of the series finale, Lily reveals she is pregnant and everyone comes together to attend Jake and Tiffany&#x27;s wedding.

===Notes===
==Episodes==
===Season 1 (1999–2000)===
===Season 2 (2000–01)===
===Season 3 (2001–02)===
==Production==
The series was filmed at the Century Studio Corporation sound stages in Culver City, California, and also on location in the Los Angeles area.

==DVD releases==
Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment (formerly Buena Vista Home Entertainment) released Season 1 on November 5, 2002, mere months after the series finale. However, it took three more years and numerous petition drives for season two to be released, which occurred on August 23, 2005. A little over a month later, on September 30, 2005, news broke about the release of the third and final season, which was slated to occur on January 10, 2006. Mock-up photos of the packaging were even released. However, by October 2005 the title was delayed indefinitely with no explanation and was never released.

It was almost two years before another official word was uttered on the subject and in July 2007, it was reported that Buena Vista&#x27;s license on the program was soon to expire. As a result, a new company could acquire the distribution rights to the title and potentially release the third season.

In 1991, Campbell played the lead role in &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;. He went on to appear as Quincey Morris, a Texan vampire hunter in &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; (1992). In 1993, he starred in the short-lived detective series &quot;Moon Over Miami&quot;. That same year, he was seen in the role of Dr. Jon Fielding in the television adaptation of &quot;Tales of the City&quot;.

He then played a college professor accused of raping a student in a 2004 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, and also played an accused serial killer who defends himself in the 2007 television series &quot;Shark&quot;. In 2010, Campbell had a recurring role in the short-lived revival of &quot;Melrose Place&quot;. Following this, Campbell took a prominent role in the AMC series &quot;The Killing&quot;, an American remake of the Danish series of the same name.

In 2012, Campbell played the stern but kindly father in the independent film, &quot;Fat Kid Rules the World&quot;.

By the end of filming of 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;, the 31-year-old Campbell was in a romance with his 20-year-old co-star Jennifer Connelly. They were engaged before they broke up in 1996 after being involved for five years. He now has a Norwegian wife and two children, and they live at her family&#x27;s farm in Rygge (Moss since 1 January 2020), Norway.

<doc id="685423" wikidata="Q5189464" url="?curid=685423" title="Crown Street, Wollongong">
<text>Crown Street is the main street in the city of Wollongong, New South Wales. It was created in the early 19th century from a cattle track which follows a ridge from Mount Keira to the first farm house in the area, and quickly became the &quot;main&quot; street of the then-town. 

Today Crown Street is the main arterial route through Wollongong from the southern suburbs to the north east. Along its route it features Wollongong Hospital, the Piccadilly Centre, Wollongong railway station, and the now-abandoned PMG building. Crown Street has also now become a major shopping district after being partially converted into a mall in the mid 1980s.

==Crown Street Mall==

The pedestrian-only zone of Crown Street Mall stretches from the corner of Crown and Keira Streets in the west to the corner of Crown and Kembla Streets in the east - these cross streets being named after the local mountains Mount Keira and Mount Kembla respectively. The mall had originally included two distinctive archways as well as several fountains and architectural features, however the archways on the junction of Crown and Keira Streets have since been demolished to make room for a pedestrian bridge. There is currently a revitalisation scheme under way that includes converting this area to al fresco dining for night shoppers. Opening the mall to slow moving traffic has also been considered. 

The two main buildings are the North Building (formerly Crown Central) and the South Building (formerly Crown Gateway). They both started as independent shopping centres but are now joined as part of Wollongong Central. Wollongong Central also occupies, West Keira, a new building on Keira Street which joins to the North Building by foot bridge and tunnel. South Building used to have a food court but this was replaced by a medical centre in the early 21st century, and the area is now a Rivers menswear outlet.

The council has announced that the mall would go through a major facelift beginning in early 2012. The facelift was completed in October 2014.

Each Friday the lower mall area is converted into a local market.

<doc id="685427" wikidata="Q5105965" url="?curid=685427" title="Chris Bratton (drummer)">
<text>Chris Bratton (born January 16, 1969) is an American drummer involved in the hardcore punk scene since 1983. He has drummed in several influential bands including Justice League, No For An Answer, Chain Of Strength, Inside Out, Statue, Drive Like Jehu and Wool.

== Career ==
=== With Inside Out ===
Inside Out were a hardcore punk band, in particular, they were a part of its youth crew subculture. They cited influences including Minor Threat, Bad Brains and Led Zeppelin. Just prior to the band&#x27;s breakup, the music being written was significantly more influenced by hip hop, particularly Run-DMC.

Songs were composed by DiCara and de la Rocha evenly, with some songs having instrumentals and lyrics written by DiCara and some by de la Rocha while others were collaborations between the two.

They have been cited as an influence by Have Heart, Stick to Your Guns, Linkin Park, Refused, Incendiary, Coalesce and Mouthpiece.

=== With Chain Of Strength ===
The first Chain of Strength release was a 7&quot; EP entitled &quot;True Till Death&quot;, released through Revelation Records. After parting ways with Revelation, they formed their own Foundation Records to release another 7&quot;, &quot;What Holds Us Apart&quot;. Both of these records eventually fell out of print, yet were still in demand. As a result, Revelation Records released both EPs (plus one unreleased track) as a CD/LP called &quot;The One Thing That Still Holds True&quot;.

Both EP&#x27;s were released in the UK on First Strike Records, a record label based in Wigan, run from a skate shop called Alans.

From 2006-2008, Alex Barreto played bass for the band Alien Ant Farm. Currently, he is the guitarist of Excel.

=== With Drive Like Jehu ===
Drive Like Jehu was an American post-hardcore band from San Diego active from 1990 to 1995. It was formed by rhythm guitarist and vocalist Rick Froberg and lead guitarist John Reis, ex-members of Pitchfork, along with bassist Mike Kennedy and drummer Mark Trombino, both from Night Soil Man, after their two bands disbanded in 1990. Drive Like Jehu&#x27;s music was characterized by passionate singing, unusual song structure, indirect melodic themes, intricate guitar playing, and calculated use of tension, resulting in a distinctive sound amongst other post-hardcore acts and helped to catalyze the evolution of hardcore punk into emo.

After releasing their eponymous debut in 1991 through local record labels Cargo Music and Headhunter Records, Drive Like Jehu signed to major label Interscope Records along with Reis&#x27; other band Rocket from the Crypt. Their second album, 1994&#x27;s &quot;Yank Crime&quot;, gained a cult following, but the group disbanded shortly afterward. Reis continued with Rocket from the Crypt and Trombino became a successful record producer and audio engineer, while Froberg and Kennedy pursued careers outside of music. In 1999, Reis and Froberg began playing together again in Hot Snakes, which was active from 1999 to 2005 and again from 2011 to present. Reis also re-released &quot;Yank Crime&quot; through his Swami Records label.

=== With Wool ===
Wool formed in the early 1990s when brothers Pete and Franz Stahl (vocals/guitar and guitar/vocals, respectively) were forced to terminate their popular band Scream after bassist Skeeter Thompson left the band and after drummer Dave Grohl joined Seattle grunge band Nirvana midway through a U.S. tour.

The brothers then teamed up with drummerPeter Moffett (also a member of Government Issue and Burning Airlines) and bassist Al Bloch (member of Concrete Blonde, and brother of Seattle Sub-Pop legend Kurt Bloch from the Fastbacks).

The quartet&#x27;s first single &quot;Little Darlin&#x27;&quot;, is a well-regarded punk single. Then, the band released 1992&#x27;s rollicking &quot;Budspawn&quot;, which was released independently on External Records (the original vinyl version consisted of eight tracks clocking in at over 30 minutes while the CD version had six tracks and was classified as an EP instead). The material on &quot;Budspawn&quot; combined the four members&#x27; inherent punk aesthetics with a tendency toward more straight-ahead, anthemic hard rock and drug-induced psychedelia.

=== With No For An Answer ===
No For an Answer was a Californian hardcore punk band active primarily between 1987 and 1989. The band has also done a couple of reunion shows, most notably the Revelation 25th anniversary shows in California.

<doc id="685428" wikidata="Q417227" url="?curid=685428" title="Levetiracetam">
<text>Levetiracetam, sold under the brand name Keppra among others, is a novel antiepileptic drug (medication) used to treat epilepsy. It is used for partial-onset, myoclonic, or tonic–clonic seizures, and is taken either by mouth as an immediate or extended release formulation or by injection into a vein.

&quot;Levetiracetam was discovered in 1992 through screening in audiogenic seizure susceptible mice and, 3 years later, was reported to exhibit saturable, stereospecific binding in brain to a approximately 90 kDa protein, later identified as the ubiquitous synaptic vesicle glycoprotein SV2A.&quot;
&quot;The discovery process identifying levetiracetam&#x27;s antiepileptic potential was unique because it challenged several dogmas of antiepileptic drug discovery, and thereby encountered skepticism from the epilepsy community.&quot;
Common side effects of levetiracetam include sleepiness, dizziness, feeling tired, and aggression. Severe side effects may include psychosis, suicide, and allergic reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome or anaphylaxis. Levetiracetam is the S-enantiomer of etiracetam. It acts as a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) ligand.

Levetiracetam was approved for medical use in the United States in 1999 and is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 123rd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines.

==Medical uses==
===Focal epilepsy===
Levetiracetam is effective as single-drug treatment for newly diagnosed focal epilepsy in adults. It reduces focal seizures by 50% or more as an add-on medication.

===Partial-complex epilepsy===
Levetiracetam is effective as add-on treatment for partial (focal) epilepsy.

===Generalized epilepsy===
Levetiracetam is effective for treatment of generalized tonic-clonic epilepsy. It has been approved in the United States as add-on treatment for myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures. Levetiracetam has been approved in the European Union as a monotherapy treatment for epilepsy in the case of partial seizures or as an adjunctive therapy for partial, myoclonic, and tonic-clonic seizures.

Levetiracetam is sometimes used off label to treat status epilepticus.

===Prevention of seizures===

Based on low-quality evidence, levetiracetam is about as effective as phenytoin for prevention of early seizures after traumatic brain injury. It may be effective for prevention of seizures associated with subarachnoid hemorrhages.

===Other===
Levetiracetam has not been found to be useful for treatment of neuropathic pain, nor for treatment of essential tremors. Levetiracetam has not been found to be useful for treating all developmental disorders within the autism spectrum; studies have only proven to be an effective treatment for partial, myoclonic, or tonic-clonic seizures associated with autism spectrum disorder.

=== Special groups ===
Levetiracetam&#x27;s efficacy and tolerability in individuals with intellectual disability is comparable to those without. 

Studies in female pregnant rats have shown minor fetal skeletal abnormalities when given maximum recommended human doses of levetiracetam orally throughout pregnancy and lactation.

Studies were conducted to look for increased adverse effects in the elderly population as compared to younger patients. One such study published in Epilepsy Research showed no significant increase in incidence of adverse symptoms experienced by young or elderly patients with disorders of the central nervous system.

== Adverse effects ==
The most common adverse effects of levetiracetam treatment include effects on the central nervous system such as somnolence, decreased energy, headache, dizziness, mood swings and coordination difficulties. These adverse effects are most pronounced in the first month of therapy. About 4% of patients dropped out of pre-approval clinical trials due to these side effects.

About 13% of people taking levetiracetam experience adverse neuropsychiatric symptoms, which are usually mild. These include agitation, hostility, apathy, anxiety, emotional lability, and depression. Serious psychiatric adverse side effects that are reversed by drug discontinuation occur in about 1%. These include hallucinations, suicidal thoughts, or psychosis. These occur mostly within the first month of therapy, but can rarely develop at any time during treatment.

Although rare, Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), which appears as a painful spreading rash with redness and blistering and/or peeling skin, have been reported in patients treated with levetiracetam. The incidence of SJS following exposure to anti-epileptics such as levetiracetam is about 1 in 3,000.

Levetiracetam should not be used in people who have previously shown hypersensitivity to levetiracetam or any of the inactive ingredients in the tablet or oral solution. Such hypersensitivity reactions include, but are not limited to, unexplained rash with redness or blistered skin, difficulty breathing, and tightness in the chest or airways.

In a study, the incidence of decreased bone mineral density of patients on levetiracetam was significantly higher than for those on different epileptic medications.

=== Suicide ===
Levetiracetam, along with other anti-epileptic drugs, can increase the risk of suicidal behavior or thoughts. Patients taking levetiracetam should be monitored closely for signs of worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or tendencies, or any altered emotional or behavioral states.

=== Kidney and liver ===
Kidney impairment decreases the rate of elimination of levetiracetam from the body. Individuals with reduced kidney function may require dose adjustments, guided by monitoring of kidney function.

Dose adjustment of levetiracetam is not necessary in liver impairment.

=== Drug interactions ===
No significant pharmacokinetic interactions were observed between levetiracetam or its major metabolite and concomitant medications. The pharmacokinetic profile of levetiracetam is not influenced by phenytoin, phenobarbital, primidone, carbamazepine, valproic acid, lamotrigine, gabapentin, digoxin, ethinylestradiol, or warfarin.

== Mechanism of action ==
The exact mechanism by which levetiracetam acts to treat epilepsy is unknown. Levetiracetam does not exhibit pharmacologic actions similar to that of classical anticonvulsants. It does not inhibit voltage-dependent Na+ channels, does not affect GABAergic transmission, and does not bind to GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors. However, the drug binds to SV2A, a synaptic vesicle glycoprotein, and inhibits presynaptic calcium channels, reducing neurotransmitter release and acting as a neuromodulator. This is believed to impede impulse conduction across synapses. As of 2024, this is widely accepted to be its mechanism of action. However, the molecular basis of this action remains unknown.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
The FDA provided a detailed review of the pharmacology and biopharmaceutics of Levetiracetam in 2013.

=== Absorption ===
The absorption of levetiracetam tablets and oral solution is rapid and essentially complete. The bioavailability of levetiracetam is close to 100 percent, and the effect of food on absorption is minor.

=== Distribution ===
The volume of distribution of levetiracetam is similar to total body water. Levetiracetam modestly binds to plasma proteins (less than 10%).

=== Metabolism ===
Levetiracetam does not undergo extensive metabolism, and the metabolites formed are not active and do not exert pharmacological activity. Metabolism of levetiracetam is not by liver cytochrome P450 enzymes, but through other metabolic pathways such as hydrolysis and hydroxylation.

=== Excretion ===
In persons with normal kidney function, levetiracetam is eliminated from the body primarily by the kidneys with about 66 percent of the original drug passed unchanged into urine. The plasma half-life of levetiracetam in adults is about 6 to 8 hours, although the mean CSF half life of approx. 24 hours better reflects levels at site of action.

=== Analogues ===
Brivaracetam, a chemical analogue to levetiracetam, is a racetam derivative with similar properties.

==Society and culture==
Levetiracetam is available as regular and extended release oral formulations and as intravenous formulations.

The immediate release tablet has been available as a generic in the United States since 2008, and in the UK since 2011. The patent for the extended release tablet will expire in 2028.

The branded version Keppra is manufactured by UCB Pharmaceuticals S.A.

In 2015, Aprecia&#x27;s orally disintegrating tablet form of the drug manufactured using pharmaceutical 3D printing techniques was approved by the FDA, under the trade name Spritam. Some have said that the drug has been improved by 3D printing, as the formula used now has improved disintegration properties.

=== Legal status ===
==== Australia ====
Levetiracetam is a Schedule 4 substance in Australia under the Poisons Standard (February 2020). A Schedule 4 substance is classified as &quot;Prescription Only Medicine, or Prescription Animal Remedy – Substances, the use or supply of which should be by or on the order of persons permitted by State or Territory legislation to prescribe and should be available from a pharmacist on prescription.&quot;

==== Japan ====
Under Japanese law, levetiracetam and other racetams cannot be brought into the country except for personal use by a traveler for whom it has been prescribed. Travelers who plan to bring more than a month&#x27;s worth must apply for an import certificate, known as a .

==Research==
Levetiracetam has been studied in the past for treating symptoms of neurobiological conditions such as Tourette syndrome, and anxiety disorder. However, its most serious adverse effects are behavioral, and its benefit-risk ratio in these conditions is not well understood.

Levetiracetam is being tested as a drug to reduce hyperactivity in the hippocampus in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Additionally, Levetiracetam has been experimentally shown to reduce Levodopa-induced dyskinesia, a type of movement disorder, or dyskinesia associated with the use of Levodopa, a medication used to treat Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Of the ten medications evaluated in a 2023 systematic review of the literature, levetiracetam was found to be the only medication with sufficient evidence showing that it may cause seizure freedom in some infants. Further, adverse effects from levetiracetam were rarely severe enough for the medication to be discontinued in this age group. Because available research included only 2 published studies reporting seizure freedom rates, however, the strength of the evidence was judged to be low.

<text>Barclaycard (; stylised as barclaycard) is a brand for credit cards of Barclays PLC. It is considered as the United Kingdom&#x27;s first and now biggest credit card provider with 5 million accounts.

==History==
Barclays launched Barclaycard on 29 June 1966, initially as a charge card, but following Bank of England agreement to the offering of revolving credit, it became the first credit card in the United Kingdom on 8 November 1967. It enjoyed a monopoly of the credit card market in the United Kingdom until the introduction of the Access Card in October 1972.

Barclays was not the first issuer of a credit card in the United Kingdom though; Diners Club and American Express launched their charge cards in 1962 and 1963 respectively. Barclaycard was originally a BankAmericard licensee, and became part of the Visa network on its formation in September 1976.

In 2021, Barclaycard cut credit limits for over 100,000 customers, including customers who had never missed a payment. In some cases limits were cut by over 95%, resulting in &quot;completely useless&quot; credit limits.

== Products ==
In the United Kingdom, barclaycard offers a range of credit cards for personal and business customers.

==Acquisitions==

===Providian===
In July 2003, Barclays took over Monument, the United Kingdom branch of the U.S. bank Providian, when it was sold off due to financial irregularities of its American parent company. Barclaycard sold the Monument business and premises to CompuCredit Holdings Corporation in April 2007.

===Egg===
In March 2011, Barclays announced that it would be buying the British credit card business of Egg from Citigroup for an undisclosed price. At the time of the announcement, Barclays claimed that the credit card assets consisted of 1.15 million accounts with approximately £2.3bn of gross receivables. They intended to integrate those customers within their own credit card arm.

At the time of the announcement, Citi said it was &quot;committed to working with Barclays on a seamless transfer of the customer accounts, ensuring continuation of the high level of service to which customers are accustomed&quot;.

===Analog Analytics===
In June 2012, Barclays acquired Analog Analytics, a digital coupon and daily deal business similar to Groupon.

=== The Logic Group ===
In September 2014, Barclays announced it was going to acquire The Logic Group, a managed payment and loyalty business. The acquisition would enable Barclaycard&#x27;s clients to benefit from The Logic Group&#x27;s single platform transaction processing capabilities, alongside data insights, which would allow merchants to better target their services to customers.

In late 2014, Barclays confirmed that the Logic Group acquisition has been finalised.

<text>The Lisbon Lions is the nickname given to the Celtic team that won the European Cup at the Estádio Nacional in Lisbon, Portugal on 25 May 1967, defeating Inter Milan 2–1.

==Name==
The name is likely due to the fact that the Lisbon-based Sporting football club&#x27;s mascot is a lion, and the club wear green and white striped jerseys like Celtic.

==Event==

All but two members of the 15 man squad were born within 10 miles of Celtic Park in Glasgow, Scotland (Bobby Lennox, who was born 30 miles away in Saltcoats, and Tommy Gemmell, who was born in Motherwell 11 miles away). Celtic&#x27;s style was the antithesis of the cynical – but highly effective – defensive style of Inter. Jimmy Johnstone described the team&#x27;s style as &quot;like the Dutch speeded-up&quot;.

In the stadium where his father Valentino played his last match, Sandro Mazzola opened the scoring for Inter with a 7th-minute penalty after Jim Craig had brought down Renato Cappellini. The Italians then retreated into their famous 11-man defence. Inter did not win a single corner and forced Celtic goalkeeper Ronnie Simpson to make only two saves. Celtic had two shots off the crossbar, and 39 other attempts on goal, 13 of which were saved by Italian goalkeeper Giuliano Sarti, seven were blocked or deflected, and 19 were off-target. Craig made amends for his penalty mistake on 63 minutes, when he laid off the ball for Tommy Gemmell to fire home for the Celtic equaliser. With 83 minutes on the clock, Gemmell was allowed space, and he played the ball to Bobby Murdoch, whose long-range shot was deflected by Stevie Chalmers past Sarti into the net.

Celtic were the first British club to win the European Cup, and still the only Scottish club to have reached the final. Having already triumphed in the Scottish top flight, Scottish Cup, and Scottish League Cup, the Lisbon Lions became the first winners of the European Treble and remain the only winners of the fabled Quadruple. Celtic are also one of just three European clubs to have won five trophies in a single season, thanks to their Glasgow Cup triumph over Partick Thistle. They reached the European Cup final again in 1970 but were beaten 2–1 by Feyenoord after extra time in the San Siro Stadium in Milan.

<text>Bedazzled is a 1967 British DeLuxe Color comedy film directed and produced by Stanley Donen in Panavision format. It was written by comedian Peter Cook and starred both Cook and his comedy partner Dudley Moore. It is a comic retelling of the Faust legend, set in the Swinging London of the 1960s. The Devil (Cook) offers an unhappy young man (Moore) seven wishes in return for his soul, but twists the spirit of the wishes to frustrate the man&#x27;s hopes.

==Plot==
Stanley Moon, a cook in a Wimpy restaurant, is infatuated with waitress Margaret Spencer, but is too shy to approach her. Distraught, he attempts suicide by hanging but is interrupted by George Spiggot, a man claiming to be the Devil. In return for his soul, George offers Stanley seven wishes. When Stanley accuses George of being delusional, he offers Stanley a &quot;trial wish&quot;. Stanley wishes for a raspberry ice lolly, and George takes him to buy one from a nearby shop. Finding it melted, Stanley confirms that George is the Devil.

Blowing a raspberry undoes the effects of a wish if Stanley changes his mind. George&#x27;s heightened sense of pride caused God to expel him from Heaven, and they are now in a game: if George is first to claim 100 billion souls, he will be readmitted to Heaven. His staff of seven deadly sins, especially Lust and Envy, are helping him with minor acts of vandalism and spite to reach this goal. Agreeing to the deal, Stanley uses his wishes to try satisfying his love for Margaret, but George twists his words to frustrate him.

# Stanley first wishes to be more articulate. George turns him into a talkative intellectual. Margaret becomes equally pretentious and agrees with all of Stanley&#x27;s beliefs. When Stanley makes his move, however, she is horrified and starts screaming &quot;Rape!&quot;.
# Stanley wishes to be a multi-millionaire with Margaret as his &quot;very physical&quot; wife. She ignores him and his lavish gifts, including the original Mona Lisa, instead being physical with other men.
# Stanley wishes to be a pop singer. However, his fame is quickly usurped by a new rock band, Drimble Wedge and The Vegetation, whose lead singer performs in a hypnotic, monotone voice, expressing disdain for anyone except himself. Margaret and other entranced groupies mob Drimble in excitement.
# Stanley comments in passing that he wishes he were &quot;a fly on the wall&quot; and George turns them both into literal flies on the wall in a morgue, where a police inspector shows Margaret various dead bodies, hoping that she will identify one as Stanley. When the inspector invites Margaret to a vice squad party, Stanley launches an attack on him, only to be felled with bug spray.
# Stanley wishes he and Margaret lived a quiet life in the countryside with children. However, Margaret becomes another man&#x27;s wife. While deeply in love, Stanley and Margaret&#x27;s attempt to consummate their affection drives both into emotional agony.
# Determined to frame a wish that George cannot ruin for him, Stanley wishes that he and Margaret loved one another, lived away from the city with no other men around, and would always be together. George turns him into a nun of the Order of Saint Beryl, or the Leaping Beryllians, who glorify their founder by jumping on trampolines. Margaret is also a nun there but refuses to consider consummating their love as they are both women. Stanley attempts to escape the wish by blowing a raspberry, to no effect, and returns to London to confront George.
# When Stanley tries to use his seventh wish, George reveals he has already used it: his trial wish for an ice lolly.

Ultimately, George spares Stanley eternal damnation because he exceeded his quota of 100 billion souls and can afford to be generous. George ascends to Heaven, where God&#x27;s disembodied voice rejects him again; when he gave Stanley back his soul, George did the right thing with the wrong motive. Thinking he can nullify this by reclaiming Stanley&#x27;s soul, George tries to stop Stanley from burning his contract but arrives too late.

Back at the restaurant, Stanley, now back to normal, asks Margaret to dinner; despite saying she is busy, she suggests meeting another night, and Stanley smiles. George tries to entice Stanley again, but Stanley says he would rather start a relationship with Margaret his own way. Frustrated, George leaves and threatens revenge on God by unleashing all the tawdry and shallow technological curses of the modern age while God triumphantly laughs.

==Cast==
== Soundtrack ==
Moore wrote the film&#x27;s soundtrack, which was performed by the Dudley Moore Trio. The title track, Moore&#x27;s best known song, was performed within the movie by the fictional psychedelic rock band Drimble Wedge and the Vegetation, featuring Cook&#x27;s character as the vocalist. The piece has since been covered widely, including performances by Tony Hatch and Nick Cave. Moore recorded several instrumental versions.

== Novelisation ==
In 1968 &quot;Sphere Books&quot; published a novelisation of the Cook and Moore screenplay written by Michael J. Bird.
==Release==
&quot;Bedazzled&quot; was released on 10 December 1967 at the Plaza Theater in New York City and on 21 December 1967 at the Carlton Theatre in London.
==Reception==
===Critical===

Upon its release, reviews for &quot;Bedazzled&quot; were mixed. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bosley Crowther called it a &quot;pretentiously metaphorical picture&quot; which becomes &quot;awfully precious and monotonous and eventually ... fags out in sheer bad taste.&quot; Crowther does, however, compliment Donen for his &quot;colorful and graphic&quot; &quot;mise-en-scène&quot;. Roger Ebert’s review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; was far more genteel, comparing the film&#x27;s humour to that of Bob and Ray. Ebert enthusiastically called &quot;Bedazzled&quot;″s satire &quot;barbed and contemporary ... dry and understated,&quot; and overall, a &quot;magnificently photographed, intelligent, very funny film&quot;.

A January 1968 review in &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; panned the film, saying, &quot;&#x27;Script by Peter Cook, based on an idea by Peter Cook and Dudley Moore.&#x27; Well, it wasn&#x27;t much of an idea in the first place and distinctly shop-soiled at that, but even the Faust legend still has more life in it than this tired farrago. The story is used simply as a series of pegs on which to hang sketches by Dud, Pete and Eleanor Bron, all of whom appear in virtually every scene. The wit is strictly fourth-form: &quot;Don&#x27;t you know suicide is a criminal offence? You could be hanged for it,&quot; says Spiggott when he finds Stanley rope in hand, after his unsuccessful attempt on his own life. The dialogue also has an embarrassing preoccupation with the Deity and keeps making pussyfooted little dabs at blasphemy like a naughty choirboy putting out his tongue at the vicar. The feebleness of the script would matter less if the performances were on a higher level, but the principals appear to have been given their heads and there is no sign of any control by director Stanley Donen The result, inevitably, is self-indulgent, amateurish and dull, and the one genuinely hilarious moment – three nuns on a trampoline – is repeated from an old television show. Perhaps the kindest thing is to put this one down to experience and hope that next time ambition will not run so far ahead of ability.&quot;

In a retrospective review from 1989, Leslie Halliwell wrote that &quot;Bedazzled&quot; was a &quot;camped-up version of Faust which resolves itself into a series of threadbare sketches for the stars. All rather desperate apart from the leaping nuns.&quot; In the 1990s, &quot;The Virgin Film Guide&quot; said &quot;Cook and Moore brilliantly shift from character to character with just a change of voice (not unlike Peter Sellers), and the movie never flags&quot;. The &quot;Time Out Film Guide 2009&quot; describes the film as a &quot;hit and miss affair&quot; which is &quot;good fun sometimes&quot;, but suffers from a &quot;threadbare&quot; plot.

In the 2010s, &quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 3/5 stars, writing: &quot;From the days when London was swinging and Peter Cook and Dudley Moore were a partnership made in comedy heaven, this Faustian fantasy has Dud as a cook lusting after waitress Eleanor Bron and being granted seven wishes by Pete, as a drawlingly engaging Devil hungry for Dud&#x27;s soul. A briefly clad, briefly glimpsed Raquel Welch is one of the Deadly Sins, while Barry Humphries turns in a hilarious performance as Envy. Director Stanley Donen settles for quirky comedy instead of razor-sharp satire.&quot;

Film aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives &quot;Bedazzled&quot; a 74% approval rating based on 38 reviews, with a weighted average of 7.6/10.

===Remake===
20th Century Fox released an American remake by the same name, &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (2000), featuring Brendan Fraser as Elliot Richards (counterpart to Moore&#x27;s role) and Elizabeth Hurley as the Devil.

<text>Jewish languages are the various languages and dialects that developed in Jewish communities in the diaspora. The original Jewish language is Hebrew, supplanted as the primary vernacular by Aramaic following the Babylonian exile. Jewish languages feature a syncretism of Hebrew and Judeo-Aramaic with the languages of the local non-Jewish population.

==Ancient history==
Early Northwest Semitic (ENWS) materials are attested through the end of the Bronze Age—2350 to 1200 BCE. At this early state, Biblical Hebrew was not highly differentiated from the other Northwest Semitic languages (Ugaritic and Amarna Canaanite), though noticeable differentiation did occur during the Iron Age (1200–540 BCE). Hebrew as a separate language developed during the latter half of the second millennium BCE between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, an area known as Canaan.

The earliest distinctively Hebrew writing yet discovered was found at Khirbet Qeiyafa and dates to the 10th century BCE. The Israelite tribes established a kingdom in Canaan at the beginning of the first millennium BCE, which later split into the Kingdom of Israel in the north and the Kingdom of Judah in the south after a dispute of succession.

The kingdom of Israel was destroyed by the Assyrians in 722 BCE, and the kingdom of Judah was conquered by the Babylonians in 586 BCE, its higher classes exiled and the first Temple destroyed. Aramaic became the primary language of the Jews deported to Babylonia, with the first attestations of Jewish/Judean Aramaic found in scrolls from the 5th century BCE on the island of Elephantine. Later the Persians made Judah a province and permitted Jewish exiles to return and rebuild the Temple. Aramaic became the common language in the north of Israel, in Galilee and Samaria, though Hebrew remained in use in Judah with Aramaic influence.

Alexander the Great conquered Judah in 332 BCE, beginning the period of Hellenistic domination. During the Hellenistic period Judea became independent under the Hasmoneans, but later the Romans ended their independence, making Herod the Great their governor. One Jewish revolt against the Romans led to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, and the second Bar-Kochba revolt in 132–135 CE led to a large departure of the Jewish population of Judea. Biblical Hebrew after the Second Temple period evolved into Mishnaic Hebrew, which ceased being spoken and developed into a literary language around 200 CE. Hebrew remained in widespread use among diasporic communities as the medium of writing and liturgy, forming a vast corpus of literature which includes rabbinic, medieval, and modern literature prior to the revival of Hebrew as a spoken language.

==Development of Jewish varieties of languages==
Jewish communities were dispersed around the world in the diaspora which followed the Jewish-Roman wars. Some adopted the languages of their neighbors, but many developed new varieties of these languages, collectively termed &quot;Jewish languages&quot;. Various reasons led to the development of distinctive Jewish varieties of the languages of their non-Jewish host populations. Jews have often had limited exposure to non-Jewish society for various reasons, including imposed ghettoization (whether self-imposed separation or the forced creation of the ghetto by the host city) and strict endogamy, and as a result, Jewish languages diverged and developed separately from non-Jewish varieties in the territories they settled in. Due to frequent expulsions and migrations, single Jewish communities were often influenced by multiple distinct regional languages via language contact. For example, Yiddish, while based on Middle High German, has elements of Romance and Slavic. Jewish languages belong to a variety of genealogical language families, but these languages have common characteristics, making their study a distinct field of comparative linguistics known as Jewish linguistics. The common feature between the Jewish languages is the presence of Hebrew and Judeo-Aramaic lexical components, stemming from the shared use of these languages in writing and liturgy. Many Jewish languages also display phonological, morphological, and syntactic features distinct from their non-Jewish counterparts. Most written Jewish languages are &quot;Hebraized&quot;, meaning they use a modified version of the Hebrew alphabet. These languages, unless they already have an accepted name (i.e. Yiddish, Ladino), are prefixed with &quot;Judeo&quot; (e.g. Judeo-Italian, Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Persian, Judeo-Aramaic, Judeo-Marathi, Judeo-Malayalam, etc). Bukharan Jews spoke Bukhori, a dialect of Tajik, and Mountain Jews spoke Judeo-Tat.

In the early 20th century, secularism among Jews and large population shifts prompted the beginning of a shift from Jewish to non-Jewish languages. Even so, the majority of Jews in Eurasia and Africa, and many immigrants in North America and Palestine, still spoke Jewish languages. However, the Holocaust brought about a significant drop in the use of Jewish languages, especially Yiddish. Later, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic, learning Yiddish has begun to see a significant increase in popularity and interest, with studies revealing a surge in registration to online Yiddish language learning resources.

== Classification ==

Jewish languages are generally defined as the unique linguistic varieties of Jewish communities in the diaspora in their contact with surrounding non-Jewish languages. Languages vary in their distance and divergence from their non-Jewish sister languages. For example, Judeo-Yemeni Arabic is quite similar to some non-Jewish varieties of Yemeni Arabic, while Yiddish, a Germanic language, shows a high degree of dissimilarity to modern German dialects. Due to continued liturgical and literary use of Hebrew and Aramaic, Jewish communities were naturally in a state of diglossia. Along with their vernacular Jewish language, most Jews could read and write in Hebrew, which was necessary to fulfill the religious commandment to learn Torah and teach it. Jews were expected to also have knowledge of Judeo-Aramaic, the language of religious commentary (&quot;targumim&quot;) as well as many prayers, including the Kaddish. Hebrew, the &quot;Holy Tongue&quot;, was the highest linguistic register in these communities, used for liturgy and study. Hebrew-Aramaic is the only adstratum shared by all Jewish languages. 
Some Jewish languages have multiple registers; for example, both Yiddish and Judezmo have three linguistic registers: colloquial, written, and scholarly-liturgical.

Some Jewish languages show the effects of the history of language shift among the speakers, including Hebrew-Aramaic influence. Yiddish exemplifies such a language. Some Jewish languages may become marked as distinctively Jewish because some shift affected some parts of the language as a whole. For example, what is today known as Baghdad Jewish Arabic (because it is the Arabic variety that was up until recently spoken by Baghdad&#x27;s Jews) was originally the Arabic dialect of Baghdad itself and was used by all religious groups in Baghdad, but the Muslim residents of Baghdad later adopted Bedouin dialects of Arabic. Similarly, a dialect may be perceived as Jewish because its Jewish speakers brought the dialect of another region with them when they were displaced. In some cases, this may cause a dialect to be perceived as &quot;Jewish&quot; in some regions but not in others.

Some Jewish language varieties may not be classified as languages due to mutual intelligibility with their parent language, as with Judeo-Malayalam and Judeo-Spanish. In the case of Judeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino, linguistically it is a dialect of Spanish, mutually intelligible with other Spanish dialects and varieties, albeit with each Spanish dialect having loanwords and influences from different source languages: Nahuatl and Maya loanwords and influences for Mexican Spanish; Quechua and Aymara in Peruvian Spanish; Italian, Quechua and Guaraní in Argentinian Spanish; Maghrebi Arabic and Berber in &quot;Ladino Occidental&quot; (also known as Haketia); Levantine Arabic, Greek, Turkish and South Slavic in &quot;Ladino Oriental&quot;.

In some cases, as with Judeo-Spanish, a register may be developed for Biblical translation and exegesis in which Hebrew-Aramaic patterns are frequently calqued, though the number of true Hebrew and/or Aramaic loanwords may be low. Another possibility is that Jews may speak the same language as their non-Jewish neighbors, but occasionally insert Hebrew-Aramaic or other Jewish elements. This is a transitory state in the shift from the use of Jewish to a non-Jewish language, often made in the context of assimilation. This occurred, for example, with many educated German Jews who transitioned from Western Yiddish to German. This variety of German, used between 1760 and the end of the 19th century (the Haskala), was written with the Hebrew alphabet, and contained a small number of Hebrew and Yiddish loans. An example is Moses Mendelssohn&#x27;s translation of the Hebrew Bible into German written with Hebrew letters.

Judeo-Papiamento, the only living Jewish ethnolect endemic to the Americas and likely the only one that is also a creole language, has lexical differences from its non-Jewish counterpart that go beyond the influence of Hebrew and Aramaic. In formal contexts, Sephardic Jewish speakers of Papiamento tend to use extensive borrowing from French and Portuguese, whereas non-Jewish Curaçaoans mostly use Spanish loanwords in similar contexts.


==Status==
Among the most widely spoken Jewish languages to develop in the diaspora are Yiddish, Judeo-Spanish, and the Judeo-Arabic group of languages. Yiddish is the Judeo-German language developed by Ashkenazi Jews who lived in Central and Eastern Europe before World War II. Judeo-Spanish, also called &quot;Judezmo&quot; and &quot;Muestra Spanyol&quot;, is the Judeo-Spanish language developed by Sephardic Jews who lived in the Iberian Peninsula before the expulsion by the Catholic Monarchs. Judeo-Catalan (also called &quot;Catalanic&quot; or &quot;Qatalanit&quot;), was the Jewish language spoken by the Jewish communities in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands. Judeo-Provençal and Judeo-Gascon were two Jewish varieties of Occitan language as it was historically spoken by French Jews.

Many ancient and distinct Jewish languages, including Judeo-Georgian, Judeo-Arabic, Judeo-Berber, Krymchak, Judeo-Italian, Judeo-Malayalam have largely fallen out of use due to the impact of the Holocaust on European Jewry, the Jewish exodus from Arab lands, the assimilation policies of Israel in its early days and other factors.

Yiddish was the language spoken by the largest number of Jews in the 1850s, but today the three most commonly spoken languages among Jews are English, modern Hebrew, and Russian—in that order. Yiddish, as well as several other Jewish languages, has contributed to the vocabulary of coterritorial non-Jewish languages, such as English or French.

Kol Yisrael, Israel&#x27;s former public-service broadcaster, had long maintained short daily news and featured programming in many Jewish languages and dialects. For domestic audiences, it broadcast in Judeo-Iraqi Arabic on its Arabic network, while also producing in Yiddish, Judeo-Spanish, Judeo-Moroccan Arabic, Bukharian and Judeo-Tat for both domestic and overseas shortwave audiences in relevant areas. In addition, for over two decades starting in the late 1970s, a daily 30-minute shortwave transmission was made to Yemen in Judeo-Yemeni Arabic.

Radio Exterior de España, Spain&#x27;s international public broadcaster, provides programming in Judeo-Spanish, which they refer to as Sefardi.

In the United States as well as in Birobidzhan, Russia, there are some local radio programs in Yiddish.

Judeo-Marathi () is a form of Marathi spoken by the Bene Israel, a Jewish ethnic group that developed a unique identity in India. Judeo-Marathi, like other Marathi dialects, is written in the Devanagari script. It may not be sufficiently different from Marathi as to constitute a distinct language, although it is characterized by a number of loanwords from Hebrew and Aramaic as a result of influence from the Cochin Jewish community, as well as from Judeo-Malayalam, Portuguese and also some influence from the Urdu language.

==Alphabets==
For centuries Jews worldwide spoke the local or dominant languages of the regions they migrated to, often developing distinctive dialectal forms or branching off as independent languages. The usual course of development for these languages was through the addition of Hebrew words and phrases used to express uniquely Jewish concepts and concerns. Often they were written in Hebrew letters, including the block letters used in Hebrew today and Rashi script.

Conversely, Judeo-Spanish, formerly written in Rashi script or Solitreo, since the 1920s is usually written in Turkey in the Latin alphabet with a spelling similar to that of Turkish, and has been occasionally printed in the Greek and Cyrillic alphabets.

Also, some Yiddish-speakers have adopted the use of the Latin alphabet, in place of the Hebrew alphabet. This is predominantly to enable communications over the internet, without the need for special Hebrew keyboards.

<text>The  is a Dutch and German breed of dairy cattle. It is reported from the Netherlands and Belgium, but may be extinct in Germany. 

== History ==

No written evidence supports an often-repeated claim that the Lakenvelder derives from cattle of the or belted Braunvieh of Switzerland, brought to the Netherlands in or after Mediaeval times by the nobility or the wealthy. It is however supported by molecular genetic studies, which have shown that the Gurtenvieh, the Lakenvelder and the Belted Galloway all carry the same candidate gene for the belted phenotype. Cattle with this characteristic are shown in Dutch paintings from the seventeenth century. It seems likely that the Lakenvelder derives directly from Swiss and Austrian belted cattle, and that during the reign of William of Orange some cattle of this type found their way to Scotland, where they inter-bred with Galloway stock, giving rise to the Belted Galloway.

A herd-book for the Lakenvelder was started in 1918; at that time there were about fifteen farms breeding the cattle, with some 200 head between them. In 1930 regulations were introduced to control milk production and to make testing for tuberculosis obligatory; by the end of the Second World War only five herds remained.

== Characteristics ==

The Lakenvelder is finely built and of small to medium size, with a withers height in the range for cows and averaging or for bulls. Body weights are variously reported as or for bulls, and or for cows.

The coat may be either black or dusky red, always with a broad belt of white encircling the body behind the shoulder and in front of the hip; black and red animals are in approximately equal numbers. There are no other white markings on the head or body; the horns, tongue and udder are pigmented. Both sexes normally carry horns, but polled animals can occur.

== Use ==

It is a dual-purpose breed, with both dairy and beef strains. Beef yields are not high, but the meat is of good quality and has achieved good results in comparative taste tests. The milk is high in protein and low in fat; milk yields are of the order of per year.

<text>Born Against was an American hardcore punk band from New York active between 1989 and 1993. Though Born Against received little media exposure while still together, they have since been described as &quot;legendary&quot; by the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; and the &quot;LA Weekly&quot;.

==History==
The group was founded in early 1989 by guitarist Adam Nathanson, bassist Neil Burke, vocalist Sam McPheeters, and drummer John Guzman, who was replaced in early rehearsals by a drummer named George. George&#x27;s tenure was also brief, and he was replaced after a single show by Nigel Schreiber in July 1989. This lineup recorded a demo cassette and a track for the &quot;Murders Among Us&quot; 7-inch compilation released on McPheeters&#x27; Vermiform Records label before Burke and Schreiber left the group later that year. Born Against would continue to be plagued by rhythm section fluctuation throughout its existence.

In March 1990, the band reemerged with bassist Javier Villegas and drummer Darryl Kahan. The band issued its first two vinyl releases, the &quot;Eulogy&quot; single (whose anti-religious title track was dedicated to Steve Reddy of Equal Vision Records), a self-titled 7-inch EP, and several compilation tracks. Later that year, Kahan was replaced by drummer John Hiltz, birthing the longest lasting incarnation of the band. The group toured extensively, and released a debut LP, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Nine Patriotic Hymns for Children&quot;, on Vermiform. Villegas left the group in late 1991 and was replaced by bassist Bret Blue.

With Hiltz and Blue, Born Against continued its extensive touring, including a trip to Europe. By this point, the band&#x27;s aggressive political message and related critique of their contemporaries had attracted media attention, and they endured animosity in New York City and beyond. They then began work on a new record, which was stalled in July 1992 when Hiltz left the group. The final sessions that produced the resultant 10-inch record, &quot;Battle Hymns of the Race War&quot;, featured Melissa York on drums, although York never performed live with the group.

By early 1993, Nathanson and McPheeters had relocated to Jersey City, New Jersey and begun a new version of the band with bassist Tonie Joy (of Moss Icon and Universal Order of Armageddon) and drummer Brooks Headley (also from Universal Order of Armageddon). Although only extant for seven months, this was a prolific incarnation, as they continued to tour and released split 7-inches with Screeching Weasel (in which both bands swapped lyrics) and Universal Order of Armageddon. Their radical leftist stance became increasingly drenched in cynicism, which slowly threatened to overtake their message – the results of this evolution are evidenced in the nonsense song &quot;Lillian&quot; and other non-sequitur pieces from this time. Their final release was a split 8&quot; record with Man is the Bastard. Born Against played its final show in July 1993.

Two posthumous CDs containing the entire Born Against catalog (aside from their demo tape) have since been released – &quot;Patriotic Battle Hymns&quot; (featuring &quot;Nine Patriotic Hymns for Children&quot; and &quot;Battle Hymns of the Race War&quot;) and &quot;The Rebel Sound of Shit and Failure&quot; (featuring all other material). Initially released on the now-defunct Vermiform, these records have since been taken on by the Kill Rock Stars and Prank Records imprints.

<doc id="685457" wikidata="Q742487" url="?curid=685457" title="Nootropic">
<text>Nootropics ( or ), colloquially brain supplements, smart drugs and cognitive enhancers, are natural, semisynthetic or synthetic compounds which purportedly improve cognitive functions, such as executive functions, attention or memory.

While commonly in the form of dietary supplements, nutraceuticals or energy drinks, some nootropic compounds are prescription and non-prescription drugs in various countries.

In the United States, nootropics are commonly advertised with unproven claims of effectiveness for improving cognition. The Federal Trade Commission and FDA have warned manufacturers and consumers about possible advertising fraud and marketing scams concerning nootropic supplements.

==History of term==
The term &quot;nootropic&quot; is derived .

The first documented use of &quot;nootropic&quot; in reference to substances purported to increase cognitive functions was by Corneliu E. Giurgea in 1972. When researching a new compound, Giurgea found a spectrum of effects that did not align with any psychotropic drug category, leading to his proposal of a new category and the concept of the term nootropic.

Giurgea stated that nootropic drugs should have the following characteristics:

# They should enhance learning and memory.
# They should enhance the resistance of learned behaviors or memories to conditions which tend to disrupt them (e.g. electroconvulsive shock, hypoxia).
# They should protect the brain against various physical or chemical injuries.
# They should increase the efficacy of the tonic cortical control mechanisms.
# They should lack the usual pharmacology of other psychotropic drugs (e.g. sedation, motor stimulation) and possess few adverse effects and low toxicity.

However, there is no globally accepted or clinical definition of a nootropic. Most compounds described as nootropic do not correspond to Giurgea&#x27;s characteristics.

==Unproven marketing claims==
In the United States, nootropics are commonly advertised with unproven claims of effectiveness for improving cognition. Manufacturers&#x27; marketing claims for dietary supplements are usually not formally tested and verified by independent entities. In 2019, the US FDA and FTC warned manufacturers and consumers about possible advertising fraud and marketing scams concerning nootropic supplement products. The FDA and FTC stated that some nootropic products had not been approved as a prescription drug effective for any medical purpose, were not proven to be safe, and were illegally marketed in the United States under violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

In 2018 in the United States, some nootropic supplements were identified as having misleading ingredients and illegal marketing. In 2019, the FDA and FTC warned manufacturers and consumers about possible advertising fraud and marketing scams concerning nootropic supplements.

Over the years 2010 to 2019, the FDA warned numerous supplement manufacturers about the illegal status of their products as unapproved drugs with no proven safety or efficacy at the doses listed on the products, together with misleading marketing.

== Availability and prevalence ==
In 2008, stimulants, such as caffeine, were the most commonly used nootropic agent. In 2016, the American Medical Association adopted a policy to discourage prescriptions of nootropics for healthy people, on the basis that the cognitive effects appear to be highly variable among individuals, are dose-dependent, and limited or modest at best. Piracetam, noopept and meclofenoxate have been sold as dietary supplements.

==Adverse effects==
The main concern with pharmaceutical drugs and dietary supplements are adverse effects. Long-term safety evidence is typically unavailable for many nootropic compounds. Racetams, piracetam and other compounds that are structurally related to piracetam, have few serious adverse effects and low toxicity, but there is little evidence that they enhance cognition in people having no cognitive impairments.

In the United States, dietary supplements may be marketed if the manufacturer can show that the supplement is generally recognized as safe, and if the manufacturer does not make any claims about using the supplement to treat or prevent any disease or condition; supplements that contain drugs or advertise health claims are illegal under US law.

==Types==

=== Central nervous system stimulants ===
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of clinical research using low doses of certain central nervous system stimulants found that these drugs may enhance cognition in healthy people. In particular, the classes of stimulants that demonstrate possible cognition-enhancing effects in humans have evidence in vitro as direct agonists or indirect agonists of dopamine receptor D1 or adrenoceptor A2. Relatively high doses of stimulants cause cognitive deficits.
* Amphetamine systematic reviews and meta-analyses report that low-dose amphetamine may improve cognitive functions (e.g., inhibitory control, episodic memory, working memory, and aspects of attention) in healthy people and in individuals with ADHD. A 2014 systematic review noted that low doses of amphetamine also improve memory consolidation, in turn leading to improved recall of information in non-ADHD youth. It also improves task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and performance on tedious tasks that required a high degree of effort.
* Caffeine a meta-analysis found an increase in alertness and attentional performance.
* Eugeroics (armodafinil and modafinil) are classified as &quot;wakefulness-promoting agents&quot;; modafinil may increase alertness, particularly in sleep-deprived individuals, and may improve reasoning and problem solving in non-ADHD youth. In a systematic review of small, preliminary studies where the effects of modafinil were examined, when simple psychometric assessments were considered, modafinil intake enhanced executive function. Modafinil does not improve mood or motivation in sleep-deprived or non-sleep deprived individuals.
* Methylphenidate a benzylpiperidine derivative that may improve working memory, episodic memory, and inhibitory control, aspects of attention, and planning latency in healthy people. It also may improve task saliency and performance on tedious tasks. At above optimal doses, methylphenidate has off–target effects that decrease learning.
* Nicotine has been associated with improved alertness, attention, memory, and motor performance, according to a meta-analysis. However, a 2020 systematic review raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, noting industry funding in many studies and inconsistent results regarding nicotine&#x27;s cognitive effects. This review found that over half of the studies published after 2010 had tobacco industry affiliations, often undisclosed.

===Racetams===

Racetams, such as piracetam, oxiracetam, phenylpiracetam, and aniracetam, are often marketed as cognitive enhancers and sold over the counter. A 2019 study found that piracetam supplements sold in the United States were inaccurately labeled. Racetams are often referred to as nootropics, but this property is not well established in humans, and nootropics are not consistently found in all racetams. The racetams have poorly understood mechanisms, although piracetam and aniracetam are known to act as positive allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors and appear to modulate cholinergic systems. Similar compounds, such as noopept and aloracetam, do not meet the chemical definition for being a racetam, though they are considered &quot;racetam-like&quot; due to their high similarity

According to the FDA,

Piracetam is not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, or dietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake. Further, piracetam is not a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any such dietary ingredient. [...] Accordingly, these products are drugs, under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C), because they are not foods and they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Moreover, these products are new drugs as defined by section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling.

===Cholinergics===

Some supposed nootropic substances are compounds and analogues of choline, a precursor of acetylcholine (a neurotransmitter) and phosphatidylcholine (a structural component of cell membranes).
* Alpha-GPC – L-alpha glycerylphosphorylcholine has been studied only in the context of cognitive performance alongside other substances such as caffeine. 
* Choline bitartrate – Choline bitartrate is a tartaric acid salt containing choline (41% choline by molecular weight). One meta-analysis found choline bitartrate to be ineffective at improving any measure of cognitive performance.
* Citicoline – Compound consisting of choline and cytidine. A meta-analysis found that it may be effective for improving memory and learning in older people with mild cognitive decline, and in people recovering from a stroke.

==Herbs==
* &quot;Centella asiatica&quot; A 2017 meta-analysis showed no significant improvement in cognitive function. Clinical efficacy and safety have not been scientifically confirmed for this herb.
* &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; An extract of &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; leaf is marketed in dietary supplement form with claims it can enhance cognitive function in people without known cognitive problems, although there is no high-quality evidence to support such effects on memory or attention in healthy people.
* &quot;Panax ginseng&quot; A Cochrane review found possible &quot;improvement of some aspects of cognitive function, behavior and quality of life&quot;, but concluded that &quot;there is a lack of convincing evidence to show a cognitive enhancing effect of &quot;Panax ginseng&quot; in healthy participants and no high quality evidence about its efficacy in patients with dementia.&quot;

==Nutrients and dietary supplements==

* Folate no cognition-enhancing effects in middle-aged and older adults without folate deficiency.
* Omega-3 fatty acids: DHA and EPA two Cochrane Collaboration reviews on the use of supplemental omega-3 fatty acids for ADHD and learning disorders conclude that there is limited evidence of treatment benefits for either disorder. Two other systematic reviews found no cognition-enhancing effects in the general population.
* Vitamin B12 no cognition-enhancing effects in middle-aged and older adults without B12 deficiency.
* Vitamin B6 no cognition-enhancing effects in middle-aged and older adults without B6 deficiency.
* Vitamin E no cognition-enhancing effects in middle-aged and older adults without vitamin E deficiency.

<text>Sunset Beach is a beach located on the Cape May Peninsula, in Lower Township, New Jersey, near Cape May Point, along the Delaware Bay, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. It is a local tourist attraction due in part to its proximity to the SS &quot;Atlantus&quot;, also known as the Concrete Ship, and the Cape May Lighthouse.

== Attractions ==
Sunset Beach is known for a flag raising-lowering ceremony, which is held daily from Memorial Day weekend through August, and on Saturdays in September. All the flags flown in the ceremony are flags from the caskets of veterans. The ceremony has been taking place on Sunset beach since 1973. Other attractions include Cape May diamonds, clear quartz crystals that can be easily found along the beach&#x27;s length; the SS &quot;Atlantus&quot;, a partially submerged concrete ship; summer fireworks.

==Ecology==
Many whales are seen from May to December, while migratory birds are seen in the spring and fall. Monarch butterflies use Sunset Beach as a migratory stopover on their way to Mexico from Canada.

<doc id="685467" wikidata="Q1166378" url="?curid=685467" title="Darlington Raceway">
<text>Darlington Raceway is a egg-shaped oval track in Darlington, South Carolina. The track has hosted a variety of racing events since its inaugural season of racing in 1950; primarily races sanctioned by NASCAR. The venue has a capacity of 47,000 as of 2021. Darlington Raceway is currently owned by NASCAR and is led by track president Josh Harris.

Darlington Raceway opened in 1950 under Darlington native Harold Brasington, who sought to replicate the success of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the Indianapolis 500 in his hometown. Brasington quickly cut all ties with the facility, with Bob Colvin taking over control of the venue as president of the track. Under Colvin&#x27;s tenure, the speedway underwent major expansion. However, after Colvin died in 1967, all major expansion on the venue came to a halt, with the track&#x27;s lack of amenities being criticized. After the International Speedway Corporation (ISC) bought out the facility in 1982, the venue underwent further expansion in the 1990s. The track has remained on a staple of the NASCAR Cup Series since its inaugural year despite Darlington&#x27;s small market and NASCAR&#x27;s national expansion, with the Southern 500 considered to be one of the most prestigious races on the schedule.

== Description ==

=== Configuration ===
Darlington Raceway in its current form is measured at , with 25° of banking in the track&#x27;s first two turns, 22° of banking in the track&#x27;s last two turns, and 6° of banking on the track&#x27;s straights. The track is known for its asymmetrical layout, with the first two turns having a wider radius than the last two turns. Due to numerous factors, including an unusually highly abrasive track surface, its asymmetrical shape, and the track&#x27;s preferred racing line of being near the wall, the track has often been regarded by NASCAR drivers as one of the toughest circuits on the NASCAR schedule, with teams often sacrificing performance in one set of turns to run better in the other set of turns. 

=== Amenities ===
Darlington Raceway is located in Darlington, South Carolina, and is served by U.S. Route 52 and the concurrent South Carolina Highway 34 and South Carolina Highway 151. As of 2021, the venue has a capacity of 47,000 according to &quot;The State&quot;.

== Track history ==
=== Planning and construction ===
After witnessing the 1933 Indianapolis 500 in-person, Darlington, South Carolina, resident Harold Brasington was interested in rekindling the success of the Indianapolis 500 in the American Southeast with stock car racing. After searching in numerous locations in Virginia, Tennessee, and Atlanta, he settled to buy lands in his hometown due to lower land prices. After 15 years of owning a trucking business, Brasington was able to gather enough money and agreed on a handshake deal to build a stock car track on a plot of land owned by J. S. Ramsey, a personal friend of Brasington. The date of the beginning of construction for the venue is disputed: in a 1950 report published by the &quot;Columbia Record&quot;, Darlington Raceway general engineer Paul Psilios stated that construction started on January 13, 1950. However, according to numerous Carolinan newspapers decades after the venue&#x27;s opening, construction started sometime in 1949, with &quot;Charlotte News&quot; writer Bob Myers stating that groundbreaking occurred on December 12. Darlington Raceway, according to multiple South Carolinian newspapers, was placed under heavy speculation and doubt, with the facility reportedly earning the derogatory nickname &quot;Harold&#x27;s Folly&quot; by the local populace. 

After grading for then-turns 3 and 4 were completed, Ramsey became worried about the track potentially destroying a fishing pond that he often fished in after witnessing the fast-paced construction of the venue. In response, Brasington opted to make the radius of then-turns 1 and 2 tighter than then-turns 3 and 4. In February 1950, &quot;The Charlotte News&quot;&#x27; Rubye Arnold reported that the facility would host a race on Labor Day of that year. By April, grading on the facility was 50% complete. A month later, with a newly-elected slate of board of directors being appointed, a completion date of August 1 was announced. On July 1, surfacing of the track started. By the completion of the then-named Darlington International Raceway, it had a seating capacity of approximately 10,000, with the track drawing comparisons to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in terms of prestige. 

=== Early Colvin years ===

Darlington International Raceway officially opened to the public on August 19, 1950, for qualifying races for the 1950 Southern 500. The Southern 500, the venue&#x27;s first major race, took place on September 4, with Johnny Mantz winning the event. In November, the facility ran its first motorcycle races for Armistice Day weekend. The following year, Bob Colvin was appointed to replace Brasington as president of the track, with Brasington eventually cutting all ties with the facility four years later.

Under Colvin&#x27;s leadership, the venue was expanded extensively; in 1953, the track&#x27;s &quot;south turn&quot; banking was extended from to . The installation of lights for the 1953 Southern 500 was also considered; however, the proposal was rejected due to impracticality and a lack of fan support. The following year, the venue added 6,000 grandstand seats, increasing the grandstand capacity to 16,000 according to Colvin. A new 13,200-seat grandstand located on the backstretch to increase grandstand capacity to 29,200 was announced in 1955; by the time it was completed in 1956, the grandstand was expanded to include 14,500 seats. Another 3,300-seat grandstand named after Confederate Army general Robert E. Lee was erected in 1963 on the track&#x27;s then-fourth turn. In 1965, the track was completely repaved for the first time. 

In its early years, Darlington Raceway oversaw numerous fatalities. In November 1950, the track&#x27;s first fatality occurred when racer Robert Burns crashed and died due to internal injuries in a motorcycle race. Two years later, Rex Stansell died after suffering a head injury in a crash during a modified and sportsman race. In 1954, Bob Scott died after crashing during a race, succumbing to a broken neck. In the 1957 Southern 500, Bobby Myers was killed in an accident after his car hit the standstill car of Fonty Flock, flipping several times and eventually dying due to a broken neck and &quot;a crushed chest and massive hemorrhaging&quot; according to the &quot;Florence Morning News&quot;. In the 1960 Southern 500, the track experienced its deadliest incident, when Bobby Johns&#x27; car crashed and flipped on the track&#x27;s backstretch pit road, killing three people: NASCAR official Joe Brown Taylor alongside Paul McDuffie and Charles Ernest Sweatland, both members of Joe Lee Johnson&#x27;s pit crew. In the 1965 Southern 500, Buren Skeen died of &quot;head and abdominal injuries&quot; related to a crash when Reb Wickersham&#x27;s car slammed into the driver&#x27;s side of Skeen&#x27;s car.

==== Colvin&#x27;s segregationist policies and Confederacy support ====

Colvin was also known for implementing racially segregated policies at the venue during his tenure: grandstand seating remained all-white, with Colvin refusing to allow any black spectators into the grandstands and instead either offering refunds or a ticket to the track&#x27;s infield if a black spectator was caught having a grandstand ticket according to a 1960 &quot;Morning News&quot; report. He also refused to let any black driver to race at the circuit for most of his tenure; early black NASCAR driver Wendell Scott was barred from racing at the track for most of his career. After Colvin ended his ban and let Scott race in the 1965 Rebel 300, Colvin expressed racist remarks to Scott after Scott asked him for travel money that all other white drivers received, with Colvin stating to Scott: &quot;Nigger, you better git yo&#x27; ass back up that road [&quot;sic&quot;].&quot; According to then-Darlington Raceway&#x27;s official photographer Tom Kirkland, Colvin also stated that if he saw any black driver win at the track, they would &quot;never make it to victory lane&quot;, with Kirkland adding, &quot;he was just a complete racist&quot;. Under Colvin&#x27;s tenure, the track&#x27;s marquee events, the Southern 500 and Rebel 400, were openly promoted as celebrations of the Confederacy.

=== Slow Wallace years ===
On January 24, 1967, Colvin died after suffering a heart attack in his home. Approximately four months later, vice president Barney Wallace was elected to replace Colvin as president of the track, having already been elected general manager six days after Colvin&#x27;s death. Throughout Wallace&#x27;s tenure, he was slow on upgrading and maintaining the facility, with NASCAR writer Steve Waid describing Wallace as a &quot;totally colorless man... he didn’t care to spend a dime unless it was absolutely necessary&quot;. In 1969, then-turns three and four were reconfigured from 15° to 25° and widened to . Within the year, upgrades were also made to the facility&#x27;s press box alongside the installation of a new concrete wall in then-turns one and two. Four years later, a $100,000 (adjusted for inflaton, $) renovation of the track&#x27;s garage area was announced. In 1975, the track was fully enclosed with a concrete wall. Another complete repave of the track was ordered and completed three years later. In 1982, the then-frontstretch grandstand was renamed to the Colvin Grandstand in honor of Bob Colvin. The following year, 2,157 seats were added to the venue.

=== ISC purchase ===
In March 1982, Darlington Raceway was reported to have been suffering &quot;significant revenue losses&quot; according to &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot;. The following month, &quot;United Press International&quot; released rumors of offers of a potential sale, including from California businessman Warner W. Hodgdon and motorsports businessman Harry Ranier. On June 11, 1982, a sale to the France family-owned International Speedway Corporation (ISC) was announced, with the company offering to buy out control at $70 a share. The sale was approved on the 28th by the track&#x27;s board of directors, with Wallace remaining as president. Wallace&#x27;s tenure under ISC was short; he died on May 10, 1983, due to cancer. 20 days later, vice president Walter &quot;Red&quot; Tyler was selected to replace Wallace as president of Darlington Raceway. In 1985, the inside retaining pit wall on the then-frontstretch was demolished and replaced with a newer, longer pit wall by . Four years later, Tyler was replaced by Woodrow &quot;Woody&quot; McKay as president.

In 1990, a major multi-year renovation project commenced. Within the first year, a new garage area was construction alongside the demolition of old then-backstretch box seats. However, the project was heavily delayed starting in 1991 due to economical issues. The following year, NASCAR&#x27;s president for administration and marketing, Jim Hunter, was selected to replace McKay as president starting in 1993. In 1994, the project continued with the new 8,000-seat Tyler Tower named in honor of Red Tyler being erected above the then-backstretch Wallace Grandstand, with future plans being made to expand the tower. The following year, the track was completely repaved alongside the venue adding 5,000 seats. In 1997, the start-finish line was &quot;flip-flopped&quot; from the frontstretch to the backstretch, in the process swapping the turn numbers; turns one and two became turns three and four, and vice versa. An additional 7,700-seat grandstand was constructed within the year, alongside upgrades to the venue&#x27;s victory lane and a new media center. In 1999, the frontstretch pit road was extended by seven pit boxes, in the process removing the backstretch pit road, condensing from two pit roads to one singular pit road.

==== Ferko lawsuit, rescheduling of Southern 500 ====
In March 2001, Hunter was replaced by ISC executive Andrew Gurtis as president of the venue. In 2003, after a previous failed attempt to do so in 1999, track officials announced the addition of permanent lighting to host night racing at the venue. The following year, the addition of soft wall SAFER barriers was announced; both features were added to the track in time for the 2004 Mountain Dew Southern 500. In May 2004, after NASCAR&#x27;s focus on national expansion and the aftermath of the Ferko lawsuit involving a minority Speedway Motorsports, Inc. (SMI) shareholder suing NASCAR and ISC for violating an implied agreement to give Texas Motor Speedway a second Cup Series date, Darlington Raceway lost its fall Southern 500 date to California Speedway. That same month, Gurtis was replaced by Rockingham Speedway president Chris Browning as Darlington Raceway&#x27;s president. To retain a race resembling the Southern 500, the spring race was turned into a event alongside the rescheduling of the event for Mother&#x27;s Day weekend.

=== Post-Ferko lawsuit, return of traditional Southern 500, capacity decline ===
In 2006, the old Brasington Grandstand in turn two was demolished and replaced with a new 6,300-seat grandstand that remained under Brasington&#x27;s name, in the process adding approximately 3,000 seats at a recorded capacity of 62,000. The following year, ISC approved a $10 million renovation project aimed at repaving the track, the addition of an infield tunnel, and other upgrades. The complete repaving of the track and the addition of the tunnel were completed in time for the 2008 Dodge Challenger 500. In April 2013, Wile stated potential plans to widen seats, in the process reducing capacity under 60,000; by 2018, the track&#x27;s listed capacity was stated to be 58,000. Four months later, Browning resigned as president of the track, with Motor Racing Network director of business development Chip Wile assigned as Browning&#x27;s replacement. In 2015, the track added approximately of SAFER barriers in response to Kyle Busch&#x27;s injury at Daytona International Speedway.

The Southern 500 returned to its traditional Labor Day weekend date in 2015. Wile was transferred to become the president of Daytona International Speedway in June 2016, with NASCAR senior director of operations Kerry Tharp replacing Wile. In February 2018, a $7 million renovation project aimed at renovating the track&#x27;s Tyler, Wallace, and Colvin grandstands; the project was completed by August 2018, in the process reducing capacity to 47,000. In 2019, ownership of the track was changed to NASCAR after the sanctioning body bought out ISC. In June 2023, Tharp announced his retirement at the end of the 2023 NASCAR season, with the track&#x27;s vice president of business operations Josh Harris succeeding Tharp.

== Events ==

=== NASCAR ===
As of 2025, Darlington Raceway hosts two annual NASCAR weekends: the spring Goodyear 400 and the fall Southern 500. For most of its history, Darlington Raceway has held the aforementioned two events annually. The former was introduced in 1957 as a event. The Goodyear 400 ran annually until 2004, when it was replaced by the Southern 500 after the track lost its fall date. In 2021, the race was added back onto the Cup Series schedule. The Goodyear 400 currently serves as NASCAR&#x27;s throwback weekend, where race teams run special retro paint schemes. 

The latter was first run in 1950, and upon its first iteration, quickly became a marquee event on the NASCAR Cup Series schedule. Until 1984, the event was ran on Labor Day due to South Carolina blue laws. The Southern 500 continued to run on Labor Day weekend until 2004, when it was moved to November. After the race was removed from the Cup Series in 2005, track officials opted to replace the spring event with a event, with the race acting as a de facto Southern 500. After a one-off move to April for the 2014 season, in 2015, the race was moved back to its traditional Labor Day weekend slot. The Southern 500 is currently considered to be a &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; race on the NASCAR schedule. Along with its Cup Series races, the facility also hosts lower-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Truck Series support races, including the Shriners Children&#x27;s 200, the Sport Clips Haircuts VFW 200, and the Buckle Up South Carolina 200. 

=== Other racing events ===

* From 1993 to 1995, Darlington Raceway hosted an annual International Race of Champions (IROC) event.
* In 2007, Darlington Raceway held a one-off USAC Silver Crown Series event.

<doc id="685484" wikidata="Q815364" url="?curid=685484" title="Employee stock option">
<text>Employee stock options (ESO or ESOPs) is a label that refers to compensation contracts between an employer and an employee that carries some characteristics of financial options.

Employee stock options are commonly viewed as an internal agreement providing the possibility to participate in the share capital of a company, granted by the company to an employee as part of the employee&#x27;s remuneration package. Regulators and economists have since specified that ESOs are compensation contracts.

These nonstandard contracts exist between employee and employer, whereby the employer has the liability of delivering a certain number of shares of the employer stock, when and if the employee stock options are exercised by the employee. The contract length varies, and often carries terms that may change depending on the employer and the current employment status of the employee. In the United States, the terms are detailed within an employer&#x27;s &quot;Stock Option Agreement for Incentive Equity Plan&quot;. Essentially, this is an agreement which grants the employee eligibility to purchase a limited amount of stock at a predetermined price. The resulting shares that are granted are typically restricted stock. There is no obligation for the employee to exercise the option, in which case the option will lapse.

AICPA&#x27;s Financial Reporting Alert describes these contracts as amounting to a &quot;short&quot; position in the employer&#x27;s equity, unless the contract is tied to some other attribute of the employer&#x27;s balance sheet. To the extent the employer&#x27;s position can be modeled as a type of option, it is most often modeled as a &quot;short position in a call&quot;. From the employee&#x27;s point of view, the compensation contract provides a conditional right to buy the equity of the employer and when modeled as an option, the employee&#x27;s perspective is that of a &quot;long position in a call option&quot;.

==Objectives==
Many companies use employee stock options plans to retain, reward, and attract employees, the objective being to give employees an incentive to behave in ways that will boost the company&#x27;s stock price. The employee could exercise the option, pay the exercise price and would be issued with ordinary shares in the company. As a result, the employee would experience a direct financial benefit of the difference between the market and the exercise prices.

Stock options are also used as golden handcuffs if their value has increased drastically. An employee leaving the company would also effectively be leaving behind a large amount of potential cash, subject to restrictions as defined by the company. These restrictions, such as vesting and non-transferring, attempt to align the holder&#x27;s interest with those of the business shareholders.

Another substantial reason that companies issue employee stock options as compensation is to preserve and generate cash flow. The cash flow comes when the company issues new shares and receives the exercise price and receives a tax deduction equal to the &quot;intrinsic value&quot; of the ESOs when exercised.

Employee stock options are offered differently based on position and role at the company, as determined by the company. Management typically receives the most as part of their executive compensation package. ESOs may also be offered to non-executive level staff, especially by businesses that are not yet profitable, insofar as they may have few other means of compensation. Alternatively, employee-type stock options can be offered to non-employees: suppliers, consultants, lawyers and promoters for services rendered.

==Features==
===Overview===
Over the course of employment, a company generally issues employee stock options to an employee which can be exercised at a particular price set on the grant day, generally a public company&#x27;s current stock price or a private company&#x27;s most recent valuation, such as an independent 409A valuation commonly used within the United States. Depending on the vesting schedule and the maturity of the options, the employee may elect to exercise the options at some point, obligating the company to sell the employee its stock shares at whatever stock price was used as the exercise price. At that point, the employee may either sell public stock shares, attempt to find a buyer for private stock shares (either an individual, specialized company, or secondary market), or hold on to it in the hope of further price appreciation.

===Contract differences===
Employee stock options may have some of the following differences from standardized, exchange-traded options:

*Exercise price: The exercise price is non-standardized and is usually the current price of the company stock at the time of issue. Alternatively, a formula may be used, such as sampling the lowest closing price over a 30-day window on either side of the grant date. On the other hand, choosing an exercise at grant date equal to the average price for the next sixty days after the grant would eliminate the chance of back dating and spring loading. Often, an employee may have ESOs exercisable at different times and different exercise prices.
*Quantity: Standardized stock options typically have 100 shares per contract. ESOs usually have some non-standardized amount.
*Vesting: Initially if X number of shares are granted to employee, then all X may not be in his account.
**Some or all of the options may require that the employee continue to be employed by the company for a specified term of years before &quot;vesting&quot;, i.e. selling or transferring the stock or options. Vesting may be granted all at once (&quot;cliff vesting&quot;) or over a period time (&quot;graded vesting&quot;), in which case it may be &quot;uniform&quot; (e.g. 20% of the options vest each year for 5 years) or &quot;non-uniform&quot; (e.g. 20%, 30% and 50% of the options vest each year for the next three years).
**Some or all of the options may require a certain event to occur, such as an initial public offering of the stock, or a change of control of the company.
**The schedule may change pending the employee or the company having met certain performance goals or profits (e.g., a 10% increase in sales).
**It is possible for some options to time-vest but not performance-vest. This can create an unclear legal situation about the status of vesting and the value of options at all.
*Liquidity: ESOs for private companies are not traditionally liquid, as they are not publicly traded.
*Duration (Expiration): ESOs often have a maximum maturity that far exceeds the maturity of standardized options. It is not unusual for ESOs to have a maximum maturity of 10 years from date of issue, while standardized options usually have a maximum maturity of about 30 months. If the holder of the ESOs leaves the company, it is not uncommon for this expiration date to be moved up to 90 days.
*Non-transferable: With few exceptions, ESOs are generally not transferable and must either be exercised or allowed to expire worthless on expiration day. There is a substantial risk that when the ESOs are granted (perhaps 50%) that the options will be worthless at expiration. This should encourage the holders to reduce risk by selling exchange traded call options. In fact it is the only efficient way to manage those speculative ESOs and SARs. Wealth Managers generally advise early exercise of ESOs and SARs, then sell and diversify.
*Over the counter: Unlike exchange traded options, ESOs are considered a private contract between the employer and employee. As such, those two parties are responsible for arranging the clearing and settlement of any transactions that result from the contract. In addition, the employee is subjected to the credit risk of the company. If for any reason the company is unable to deliver the stock against the option contract upon exercise, the employee may have limited recourse. For exchange-trade options, the fulfillment of the option contract is guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corp.
*Tax issues: There are a variety of differences in the tax treatment of ESOs having to do with their use as compensation. These vary by country of issue but in general, ESOs are tax-advantaged with respect to standardized options. See below. 
**In the U.S., stock options granted to employees are of two forms that differ primarily in their tax treatment. They may be either:
***Incentive stock options (ISOs)
***Non-qualified stock options (NQSOs or NSOs)
**In the UK, there are various approved tax and employee share schemes, including Enterprise Management Incentives (EMIs). (Employee share schemes that aren’t approved by the UK government don’t have the same tax advantages.)

==Valuation==
As of 2006, the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) agree that the fair value at the grant date should be estimated using an option pricing model. Here, via requisite modifications, the model should incorporate the features described above. In general–due to these–the value of the ESO will typically &quot;be much less than [standard] prices for corresponding market-traded options.&quot;

In discussing the valuation, FAS 123 Revised (A15)—which does not prescribe a specific valuation model—states that:
a lattice model can be designed to accommodate dynamic assumptions of expected volatility and dividends over the option&#x27;s contractual term, and estimates of expected option exercise patterns during the option&#x27;s contractual term, including the effect of blackout periods. Therefore, the design of a lattice model more fully reflects the substantive characteristics of a particular employee share option or similar instrument. Nevertheless, both a lattice model and the Black–Scholes–Merton formula, as well as other valuation techniques that meet the requirements ... can provide a fair value estimate that is consistent with the measurement objective and fair-value-based method...

The IASB reference to &quot;contractual term&quot; requires that the model incorporates the effect of vesting on the valuation. As above, option holders may not exercise their option prior to their vesting date, and during this time the option is effectively European in the method currently followed. &quot;Blackout periods&quot;, similarly, requires that the model recognizes that the option may not be exercised during the quarter (or other period) preceding the release of financial results (or other corporate event), when employees would be precluded from trade in company securities; see Insider trading. During other times, exercise would be allowed, and the option is effectively American there. Given this pattern, the ESO, in total, is therefore a Bermudan option. Note that employees leaving the company prior to vesting will forfeit unvested options, which results in a decrease in the company&#x27;s liability, and this too must be incorporated into the valuation.

The reference to &quot;expected exercise patterns&quot; is to what is called &quot;suboptimal early exercise behavior&quot;. Here, regardless of theoretical considerations—see —employees are assumed to exercise when they are sufficiently &quot;in the money&quot;. This is usually proxied as the share price exceeding a specified multiple of the strike price; this multiple, in turn, is often an empirically determined average for the company or industry in question (as is the rate of employees exiting the company). &quot;Suboptimal&quot;, as it is this behavior which results in the above reduction in value, relative to standard options.

The preference for lattice models is that these break the problem into discrete sub-problems, and hence different rules and behaviors may be applied at the various time/price combinations as appropriate. (The binomial model is the simplest and most common lattice model.) The &quot;dynamic assumptions of expected volatility and dividends&quot;, e.g. expected changes to dividend policy, as well as of forecast changes in interest rates as consistent with today&#x27;s term structure, may also be incorporated in a lattice model; although a finite difference model would be more correctly (if less easily) applied in these cases.

Black–Scholes may be applied to ESO valuation, but with an important consideration: option maturity is substituted with an &quot;effective time to exercise&quot;, reflecting the impact on value of vesting, employee exits and suboptimal exercise. For modelling purposes, where Black–Scholes is used, this number is (often) based on SEC Filings of comparable companies. For reporting purposes, it can be found by calculating the ESO&#x27;s &quot;Fugit&quot;, &quot;the (risk-neutral) expected life of the option&quot;, directly from the lattice, or back-solved such that Black–Scholes returns a given lattice-based result (see ).

The Hull–White model (2004) is widely used, while the work of Carpenter (1998) is acknowledged as the first attempt at a &quot;thorough treatment&quot;; see also Rubinstein (1995). These are essentially modifications of the standard binomial model (although may sometimes be implemented as a trinomial tree). See below for further discussion, as well as calculation resources, and contingent claim valuation more generally. 
A KPMG study (from 2012) suggests that most ESO valuations use either Black–Scholes or a lattice model, as adjusted to incorporate the features of typical ESOs.
Often, the inputs to the pricing model may be difficult to determine—usually stock volatility, expected time to expiration, and relevant exercise multiples—and a variety of commercial services are offered here.

==Accounting and taxation treatment==
===General accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP)===
The US GAAP accounting model for employee stock options and similar share-based compensation contracts changed substantially in 2005 as FAS123 (revised) began to take effect.
According to US generally accepted accounting principles in effect before June 2005, principally FAS123 and its predecessor APB 25, stock options granted to employees did not need to be recognized as an expense on the income statement when granted if certain conditions were met, although the cost (expressed under FAS123 as a form of the fair value of the stock option contracts) was disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

This allows a potentially large form of employee compensation to not show up as an expense in the current year, and therefore, currently overstate income. Many assert that over-reporting of income by methods such as this by American corporations was one contributing factor in the Stock Market Downturn of 2002.

Employee stock options have to be expensed under US GAAP in the US. Each company must begin expensing stock options no later than the first reporting period of a fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2005. As most companies have fiscal years that are calendars, for most companies this means beginning with the first quarter of 2006. As a result, companies that have not voluntarily started expensing options will only see an income statement effect in fiscal year 2006. Companies will be allowed, but not required, to restate prior-period results after the effective date. This will be quite a change versus before, since options did not have to be expensed in case the exercise price was at or above the stock price (intrinsic value based method APB 25). Only a disclosure in the footnotes was required. Intentions from the international accounting body IASB indicate that similar treatment will follow internationally.

As above, &quot;Method of option expensing: SAB 107&quot;, issued by the SEC, does not specify a preferred valuation model, but 3 criteria must be met when selecting a valuation model: The model is applied in a manner consistent with the fair value measurement objective and other requirements of FAS123R; is based on established financial economic theory and generally applied in the field; and reflects all substantive characteristics of the instrument (i.e. assumptions on volatility, interest rate, dividend yield, etc.) need to be specified.

===Taxation===
Most employee stock options in the US are non-transferable and they are not immediately exercisable although they can be readily hedged to reduce risk. Unless certain conditions are satisfied, the IRS considers that their &quot;fair market value&quot; cannot be &quot;readily determined&quot;, and therefore &quot;no taxable event&quot; occurs when an employee receives an option grant. For a stock option to be taxable upon grant, the option must either be actively traded or it must be transferable, immediately exercisable, and the fair market value of the option must be readily ascertainable. Depending on the type of option granted, the employee may or may not be taxed upon exercise. Non-qualified stock options (those most often granted to employees) are taxed upon exercise as standard income. Incentive stock options (ISO) are not but are subject to Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), assuming that the employee complies with certain additional tax code requirements. Most importantly, shares acquired upon exercise of ISOs must be held for at least one year after the date of exercise if the favorable capital gains tax are to be achieved. However, taxes can be delayed or reduced by avoiding premature exercises and holding them until near expiration day and hedging along the way. The taxes applied when hedging are friendly to the employee/optionee.

The Sharesave scheme is a tax-efficient employee stock option program in the United Kingdom.

====Excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation====
This item of the profit-and-loss (P&amp;L) statement of companies&#x27; earnings reports is due to the different timing of option expense recognition between the GAAP P&amp;L and how the IRS deals with it, and the resulting difference between estimated and actual tax deductions.

At the time the options are awarded, GAAP requires an estimate of their value to be run through the P&amp;L as an expense. This lowers operating income and GAAP taxes. However, the IRS treats option expense differently, and only allows their tax deductibility at the time the options are exercised/expire and the true cost is known.

This means that cash taxes in the period the options are expensed are higher than GAAP taxes. The delta goes into a deferred income tax asset on the balance sheet. When the options are exercised/expire, their actual cost becomes known and the precise tax deduction allowed by the IRS can then be determined. There is then a balancing up event. If the original estimate of the options&#x27; cost was too low, there will be more tax deduction allowed than was at first estimated. This &#x27;excess&#x27; is run through the P&amp;L in the period when it becomes known (i.e. the quarter in which the options are exercised). It raises net income (by lowering taxes) and is subsequently deducted out in the calculation of operating cashflow because it relates to expenses/earnings from a prior period.

==Criticism==
Alan Greenspan was critical of the structure of present-day options structure, so John Olagues created a new form of employee stock option called &quot;dynamic employee stock options&quot;, which restructure the ESOs and SARs to make them far better for the employee, the employer and wealth managers.

Charlie Munger, vice-chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and chairman of Wesco Financial and the Daily Journal Corporation, has criticized conventional stock options for company management as &quot;... capricious, as employees awarded options in a particular year would ultimately receive too much or too little compensation for reasons unrelated to employee performance. Such variations could cause undesirable effects, as employees receive different results for options awarded in different years&quot;, and for failing &quot;to properly weigh the disadvantage to shareholders through dilution&quot; of stock value. Munger believes profit-sharing plans are preferable to stock option plans.

According to Warren Buffett, investor Chairman &amp; CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, &quot;[t]here is no question in my mind that mediocre CEOs are getting incredibly overpaid. And the way it&#x27;s being done is through stock options.&quot;

Other criticisms include:
# Dilution can be very costly to shareholder over the long run.
# Stock options are difficult to value.
# Stock options can result in egregious compensation of executive for mediocre business results.
# Retained earnings are not counted in the exercise price.
# An individual employee is dependent on the collective output of all employees and management for a bonus.

===Indexed options supporters===
Other critics of (conventional) stock option plans in the US include supporters of &quot;reduced-windfall&quot; or indexed options for executive/management compensation. These include academics such as Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, institutional investor organizations the Institutional Shareholder Services and the Council of Institutional Investors, and business commentators.

Reduced-windfall options would adjust option prices to exclude &quot;windfalls&quot; such as falling interest rates, market and sector-wide share price movements, and other factors unrelated to the managers&#x27; own efforts. This can be done in a number of ways such as
* `indexing` or otherwise adjusting the exercise price of options to the average performance of the firm&#x27;s particular industry to screen out broad market effects, (e.g. instead of issuing X many options with an exercise price equal to the current market price of $100, grant X many options whose strike price is $100 multiplied by an industry market index) or
* making the vesting of at least some options contingent on share price appreciation exceeding a certain benchmark (say, exceeding the appreciation of the shares of the bottom 20% of firm in the company&#x27;s sector).

According to Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried, &quot;Options whose value is more sensitive to managerial performance are less favorable to managers for the same reasons that they are better for shareholders: Reduced-windfall options provide managers with less money or require them to cut managerial slack, or both.&quot;

However, as of 2002, only 8.5% of large public firms issuing options to executives conditioned even a portion of the options granted on performance.

A 1999 survey of the economics of executive compensation lamented that:
Despite the obvious attractive features of relative performance evaluation, it is surprisingly absent from US executive compensation practices. Why shareholders allow CEOs to ride bull markets to huge increases in their wealth is an open question.

===Controversy===
Stock option expensing has been surrounded in controversy since the early 1900s. The earliest attempts by accounting regulators to expense stock options were unsuccessful and resulted in the promulgation of FAS123 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board which required disclosure of stock option positions but no income statement expensing, per se. The controversy continued and in 2005, at the insistence of the SEC, the FASB modified the FAS123 rule to provide a rule that the options should be expensed as of the grant date. One misunderstanding is that the expense is at the fair value of the options. This is not true. The expense is indeed based on the fair value of the options but that fair value measure does not follow the fair value rules for other items which are governed by a separate set of rules under ASC Topic 820. In addition the fair value measure must be modified for forfeiture estimates and may be modified for other factors such as liquidity before expensing can occur. Finally the expense of the resulting number is rarely made on the grant date but in some cases must be deferred and in other cases may be deferred over time as set forth in the revised accounting rules for these contracts known as FAS123 (revised).

<text>Piracetam is a drug that has efficacy in cognitive disorders, vertigo, cortical myoclonus, dyslexia, and sickle cell anemia; sources differ on its usefulness for dementia. Piracetam is sold as a medication in many European countries. Sale of piracetam is not illegal in the United States, although it is not regulated nor approved by the FDA, so it is legally sold for research use only.

Piracetam is in the racetams group, with chemical name &quot;2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide&quot;. It is a cyclic derivative of the neurotransmitter GABA and shares the same 2-oxo-pyrrolidone base structure with pyroglutamic acid. Related drugs include the anticonvulsants levetiracetam and brivaracetam, and the putative nootropics aniracetam and phenylpiracetam.

==Efficacy==
===Dementia===
A 2001 Cochrane review concluded that there was not enough evidence to support piracetam for dementia or cognitive problems. A 2005 review found some evidence of benefit in older subjects with cognitive impairment. In 2008, a working group of the British Academy of Medical Sciences noted that many of the trials of piracetam for dementia were flawed.

There is insufficient evidence of piracetam as a treatment for vascular dementia.

===Depression and anxiety===
Some sources suggest that piracetam&#x27;s overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety is higher than on improving memory. However, depression is reported to be an occasional adverse effect of piracetam.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) ===
Several clinical trials have looked at piracetam&#x27;s efficacy as a treatment for ADHD. Many of these have found that the drug fails to deliver the same therapeutic effects as current standard treatments for the disorder. However, more than one study has found piracetam to be highly synergistic with standard ADHD therapies, accelerating and potentiating their therapeutic effects. One 2008 clinical trial found that the combination of piracetam and atomoxetine was more effective than atomoxetine alone.

While piracetam may be an effective adjuvant therapy for ADHD (when used with specific medications), there is no evidence that it is effective when used in isolation.

===Other===
Piracetam may facilitate the deformability of erythrocytes in capillary which is useful for cardiovascular disease.

Peripheral vascular effects of piracetam have suggested its use potential for vertigo, dyslexia, Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon and sickle cell anemia. There is no evidence to support piracetam&#x27;s use in sickle cell crisis prevention or for fetal distress during childbirth. There is no evidence for benefit of piracetam with &quot;acute&quot; ischemic stroke, though there is debate as to its utility during stroke rehabilitation.

===Anti-vasospasm===
Piracetam has been found to diminish erythrocyte adhesion to vascular wall endothelium, making any vasospasm in the capillary less severe. This contributes to its efficacy in promoting microcirculation, including to the brain and kidneys.

==Side effects==
Symptoms including anxiety, insomnia, irritability, headache, agitation, tremor, and hyperkinesia are occasionally reported. Other reported side effects include somnolence, weight gain, clinical depression, weakness, increased libido, and hypersexuality.

According to a 2005 review, piracetam has been observed to have the following side effects: hyperkinesia, weight gain, anxiety, somnolence, depression, and weakness.

Piracetam reduces platelet aggregation as well as fibrinogen concentration, and thus is contraindicated to patients with cerebral hemorrhage.

===Toxicity===
The for oral consumption in humans has not been determined. The LD50 is 5.6 g/kg for rats and 20 g/kg for mice, indicating extremely low acute toxicity. For comparison, in rats the LD50 of vitamin C is 12 g/kg and the LD50 of table salt is 3 g/kg.

==Mechanisms of action==
Piracetam&#x27;s mechanism of action, as with racetams in general, is not fully understood. The drug influences neuronal and vascular functions and influences cognitive function without acting as a sedative or stimulant. Piracetam is a positive allosteric modulator of the AMPA receptor, although this action is very weak and its clinical effects may not necessarily be mediated by this action. It is hypothesized to act on ion channels or ion carriers, thus leading to increased neuron excitability. GABA brain metabolism and GABA receptors are not affected by piracetam

Piracetam increases the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine via muscarinic cholinergic (ACh) receptors, which are implicated in memory processes. Furthermore, piracetam may have an effect on NMDA glutamate receptors, which are involved with learning and memory processes. Piracetam is thought to increase cell membrane permeability. Piracetam may exert its global effect on brain neurotransmission via modulation of ion channels (&quot;i.e.&quot;, Na+, K+). It has been found to increase oxygen consumption in the brain, apparently in connection to ATP metabolism, and increases the activity of adenylate kinase in rat brains. Piracetam, while in the brain, appears to increase the synthesis of cytochrome b5, which is a part of the electron transport mechanism in mitochondria. But in the brain, it also increases the permeability of some intermediates of the Krebs cycle through the mitochondrial outer membrane.

Piracetam inhibits N-type calcium channels. The concentration of piracetam achieved in central nervous system after a typical dose of 1200 mg (about 100 μM) is much higher than the concentration necessary to inhibit N-type calcium channels (IC50 of piracetam in rat neurons was 3 μM).

==History==
Piracetam was first made some time between the 1950s and 1964 by Corneliu E. Giurgea. There are reports of it being used for epilepsy in the 1950s.

==Society and culture==
In 2009 piracetam was reportedly popular as a cognitive enhancement drug among students.

===Legal status===
Piracetam is an uncontrolled substance in the United States, meaning it is legal to possess without a license or prescription. Use of piracetam in food, supplements, medical devices, insecticides, infant formula, cosmetics, animal feed, animal drugs, tobacco products, and drugs is unlawful and constitutes an act of misbranding.

===Regulatory status===
In the United States, piracetam is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Piracetam is not permitted in compounded drugs or dietary supplements in the United States. Like most research chemicals, it has been available over-the-counter, self-regulated, and third-party lab tested by many U.S. companies for decades. Nonetheless it is still, for the purposes of U.S. law, a &quot;New Drug&quot; as defined by 21 U.S. Code § 321(p)(1).

In the United Kingdom, piracetam is approved as a prescription drug for adults with myoclonus of cortical origin, irrespective of cause, and should be used in combination with other anti-myoclonic therapies.

In Japan, piracetam is approved as a prescription drug.

In the Czech Republic, piracetam is available without prescription. 

Piracetam has no DIN in Canada, and thus cannot be sold, but can be imported for personal use in Canada.

In Hungary, piracetam was a prescription-only medication, but as of 2020, no prescription is required and piracetam is available as an over-the-counter drug under the name Memoril Mite, and is available in 600 mg pills.

<text>The Hustle is a catch-all name for some disco dances which were extremely popular in the 1970s. Late 1970s, Bump, Hustle, Watergate and Spank were popular. It mostly refers to the unique partner dance done in nightclubs to disco music. Hustle has steps in common with Mambo and Salsa and basic steps are somewhat similar to Euro dance style Discofox, which emerged at about the same time and is more familiar in various European countries. Modern partner hustle is sometimes referred to as New York hustle, however, its original name is the Latin hustle. 

A source for research on the origins of the Hustle is a book written by Willie Estrada, one of the original pioneers of the Latin Hustle, &quot;The Dancing Gangsters of the South Bronx (Rise of the Latin Hustle)&quot;. https://latinempireprod.wixsite.com/thedancinggangsters
== History ==
=== Latin Strut ===
Joe Bataan recorded a song called &quot;Latin Strut&quot; after visiting a Bronx Club called the &quot;310 1/2&quot; in 1973 and seeing the first version of a 6-step dance called &quot;The Hustle&quot; this new Latin rhythmic sound helped young Latino Teenagers develop a faster more robust version of the original slower paced six-step dance which was also a bit robotic. However, with the introduction of songs with faster rhythmic tempos young hustle dancers started doing the dance with fancier gyrations which is when it became known as the Latin Hustle. Other variations of the Hustle would soon be developed by the Black and White communities who also helped spread the Hustle throughout New York City, and eventually the world.

=== James Brown and Fatback ===
The original early hustle was a 5-step count with no turns, created by Puerto Rican teenagers in late 1972 as a direct result of Puerto Rican elders objecting to young teenagers doing a grinding slow dance known as the 500. Created in the South Bronx among Puerto Rican teens it was originally done at house parties, hooky gigs, and basements club dances in the South Bronx. It became known as &quot;Spanish hustle&quot;; from 1975 to 1976, funk band the Fatback Band made a song with that name. It was also known as the &quot;Latin hustle&quot;; and was a 6 step count to the beat of the music. And James Brown released &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Doin&#x27; the Hustle &amp; Dead on the Double Bump&quot; album in 1975. Same year The JB&#x27;s released &quot;Hustle with Speed&quot; album. Around 1976 it became known as the &quot;New York hustle&quot;. Later, known as just &quot;the hustle&quot;, when the dance became commercialized after the release of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; in 1977. The early Latin hustle Pioneers were Willie &quot;Marine Boy&quot; Estrada and many other members. Some of them were members of a gang called the Imperial Bachelors, who used the Latin hustle as a way to bring peace into a violent South Bronx. They hosted hustle parties at St. Mary&#x27;s Recreation Center on 145th St. and St. Ann&#x27;s Ave, in 1974. Those parties ended in October 1974. However, it was the venue that produced some of the best hustle dancers in New York City, who would help spread the dance in nightclubs throughout New York City in late 1974.

In 1975 music business entrepreneur, Marty Angelo created the first all hustle dance television show entitled, &quot;Disco Step-by-Step&quot;. Each one-hour show featured top hustle dancers and two 10-minute instructional segments that allowed viewers to learn how to hustle dance in the privacy of their own living rooms. One of the first shows featured a young Billy Fajardo and the Disco Dance Dimensions. Many of the show&#x27;s video clips can be found on YouTube. Marty Angelo also created the Hustle Hall of Fame online list of dancers in 2000 that he eventually turned over to Ron Bess and Mark James.

=== Van McCoy&#x27;s song ===
The original Latin Hustle started being developed in late 1972 by Puerto Rican Teenagers in the South Bronx and by 1974 was being done all over New York and the Tri-State area, and by 1976 became an International Dance Sensation. Van McCoy and the Soul City Symphony&#x27;s song &quot;The Hustle&quot; became a hit in 1975, reaching the #1 spot on both the Billboard Hot 100 and Hot Soul Singles charts. Tipped off by DJ David Todd, McCoy sent his partner Charlie Kipps Jr.to the Adam&#x27;s Apple discotheque in New York City&#x27;s East Side. And &quot;The Hustle&quot; reached the top of the Billboard Pop Singles chart the week ending July 26, 1975.
Van McCoy with The Stylistics got disco songs such as &quot;Disco Baby&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Give You Anything&quot;, &quot;Love is the Answer&quot; and &quot;Funky Weekend&quot;. Van McCoy and Charlie Kipps produced David Ruffin also.

===Depiction in &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;===
The 1977 disco movie &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (the sound track includes Tavares, Yvonne Elliman, Bee Gees, Kool &amp; the Gang, KC &amp; the Sunshine Band, The Trammps) showed both the line and partner forms of hustle, as well as a dance referred to as the &quot;tango hustle&quot; (invented for that film by Deney Terrio, according to the DVD commentary). Although the popularity of the movie faded quickly as the hype of the movie died down, the hustle and the step-by-step dance has continued even after the Disco Sucks movement and is still a &quot;global social dance&quot; and it took its place beside swing, salsa, mambo, cha-cha-cha, tango, rumba, bolero, nightclub two-step and other partner dances in America.

==New York hustle==
The couple dance form of hustle is usually called The Hustle but is frequently referred to by other names including &quot;The Latin hustle&quot; or &quot;New York Hustle&quot;. It has some resemblance to, and steps in common with, Mambo and Salsa. As in the Latin dances, couples tend to move more on the dance floor, as opposed to following a line of dance as in foxtrot.

One similarity between hustle and swing is that the lead takes the back-forward steps from his left foot; however it is not exactly a rock-step (there is no rocking action because of speed) and if the dance is taught by counting, the steps happen at the beginning of the count – &quot;and-one, two, three&quot; rather than at the end of the count as in swing – &quot;left, right, rock-step&quot;. However, those who originally developed this dance never used step counts, everything was developed by sight and sound starting in 1972.

The dance is somewhat unusual rhythmically because of the syncopation it is associated with. Most dances are danced with either 4/4 or 3/4 music with counting to match, with either a triple or duple base depending on the dance. The Latin Hustle is generally danced to 4/4 music but counted as a six-beat pattern. The most common Latin Hustle counting pattern is &quot;&amp;1 2 3 &amp;1 2 3&quot;, meaning &quot; L R LR L R&quot; in the leader&#x27;s pattern and the natural opposite of the follower&#x27;s pattern. However, the syncopation in three-count hustle also be danced: 1&amp;23, 12&amp;3, or 123&amp;.

=== Common steps ===
*Basic – similar to the basic from single-step swing, except rock-step is at beginning
*Turn – 180 degrees clockwise turn taken after rock-step, between 2 and 3 counts, followed by a rock-step
*Left Turn – 180 degrees counterclockwise turn taken after rock-step, between 1 and 2 counts, followed by a rock-step
*Side Break – lead sends follow out still holding her left hand, then picks her back up
*Wheel – couple in double hand-hold, pumps arms like a bellows; couple as a whole rotates 180 degrees clockwise
*Inside Turn or Loop Turn – similar to the loop turn from swing; follower twirls 360 degrees counterclockwise
*Wrap – similar to wrap from the western swing but the footing is the same as a half turn for the hustle
*Two hand turn – uses 180 degrees turn footing, before the step the lead takes the followers right hand in his, then proceeds as if completing a wrap but changes back to mirror two hand position halfway through the step.

<doc id="685508" wikidata="Q484311" url="?curid=685508" title="Keane (band)">
<text>Keane are an English alternative rock band from Battle, East Sussex, formed in 1995. The band comprises Tom Chaplin (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Tim Rice-Oxley (piano, synthesisers, bass guitar, backing vocals), Richard Hughes (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Jesse Quin (bass guitar, guitar, backing vocals). Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001. 

Keane achieved mainstream international success with the release of their debut album &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; in 2004. Topping the UK chart, the album won the 2005 Brit Award for Best British Album and was the UK&#x27;s second-best-selling album of 2004. It is one of the best-selling albums in UK chart history. Their second album, &quot;Under the Iron Sea&quot;, released in 2006, topped the UK Albums Chart and debuted at number four on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their third album &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; was released in October 2008 and their EP &quot;Night Train&quot; was released in May 2010. Their fourth studio album &quot;Strangeland&quot; was released in May 2012 and peaked at number one on the UK Albums Chart. 

After the release of their next album, &quot;The Best of Keane&quot; in 2013, the band took a break of nearly five years. They returned after the hiatus with new music, announcing their fifth studio album titled &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; on 6 June 2019 and releasing the lead single from the album &quot;The Way I Feel&quot;. A collection of songs had been written by Rice-Oxley during his divorce. After discussions with Chaplin, Rice-Oxley decided to proceed with recording the songs for the album. &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; was released on 20 September 2019. After the release of the album, the band embarked on the Cause and Effect Tour, visiting Europe and Latin America, before the remainder of the tour was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In May 2008, both &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; (number 13) and &quot;Under the Iron Sea&quot; (number 8) were voted by readers of &quot;Q&quot; magazine as among the best British albums ever, with Keane, the Beatles, Oasis and Radiohead the only artists having two albums in the top 20. In 2009, &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; was listed as the ninth best-selling album of the 2000s decade in the UK. Keane are known for using keyboards as the lead instrument instead of guitar, differentiating them from most other rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect in 2006 and various synthesisers were a common feature in their music which developed on the second and third albums. Keane have sold over 13 million records worldwide.

==History==

===1995–99: Early years and formation===
Tom Chaplin and Tim Rice-Oxley became friends when very young. Chaplin&#x27;s father David was the headmaster of Vinehall School in Robertsbridge, East Sussex (owned by Chaplin&#x27;s family) for 25 years, the school all three attended until the age of 13. They later attended Tonbridge School in Kent, where Rice-Oxley met Dominic Scott; both discovered their liking for music. Richard Hughes, Keane&#x27;s future drummer, also attended Tonbridge. Chaplin had learned to play the flute, but none considered music as a proper career at the time.

In 1995, while studying at University College London, Rice-Oxley formed a rock band with Scott and invited Hughes to play drums. The band, named Lotus Eaters, started as a cover band, playing songs by the members&#x27; favourite bands. After listening to Rice-Oxley&#x27;s piano playing during a weekend at Virginia Water, Surrey, in 1997, Chris Martin invited him to join his newly formed band Coldplay. However, Rice-Oxley declined because he did not want to leave The Lotus Eaters, stating &quot;I was seriously interested, but Keane were already operational and Coldplay&#x27;s keyboard player idea was dropped.&quot; Because of Martin&#x27;s offer, and although Hughes and Scott were originally opposed to it, Chaplin joined the band in 1997, taking Rice-Oxley&#x27;s place as vocalist and adding himself as the acoustic guitarist. Chaplin&#x27;s recruitment also marked a change of name from the Lotus Eaters to Cherry Keane after a friend of Chaplin&#x27;s mother, whom Rice-Oxley and Chaplin knew when they were young. At her death from cancer, she had left money for Chaplin&#x27;s family. Chaplin commented: &quot;I used some of the money to see me through the harder times with the music.&quot; The name was shortened to Keane soon afterward.

Chaplin departed for South Africa in Summer 1997 to work as a volunteer during his gap year. Chaplin&#x27;s early experiences there later were reflected in the band&#x27;s position for the Make Poverty History campaign. Returning a year later, in July 1998, following a meeting with friend David Lloyd Seaman, Hughes&#x27; first words when the band picked up Chaplin at the airport were &quot;we&#x27;ve got a gig in 10 days.&quot; With original material, Keane made their debut live appearance at the Hope &amp; Anchor pub on 13 July 1998. In this same year, Chaplin went to Edinburgh University to study for a degree in art history. However, he later quit his degree and moved to London to pursue a full-time musical career. After their debut performance, the band went touring London&#x27;s pub gig circuit throughout 1998 and 1999.

===1999–2003: Early releases and Scott&#x27;s departure===
In late 1999, and without a record deal, Keane recorded their first promotional single &quot;Call Me What You Like&quot;. Released on CD format through Keane&#x27;s label Zoomorphic, it was sold after live performances at the pubs where Keane used to play in early 2000. Only 500 copies were printed. The EP was reviewed by Bec Rodwell from &quot;eFestivals&quot; who listed &quot;Closer Now&quot; as the best song of the record. Recording for the band&#x27;s next release began on 28 October 2000. At the start of 2001, Rice-Oxley and Hughes disclosed that the main recording would be &quot;Wolf at the Door,&quot; and that it would be completed soon. The band gave progress updates. Hughes recorded drums in late January, and the final recording session was in February. Mixing took place in April. The single was released in June, and only 50 copies are known to have been made, using unlabeled CD-Rs.

Both singles are considered highly valuable collectors&#x27; items by fans. In particular, &quot;Wolf at the Door&quot; has been known to be sold for over £1000 on eBay. During production of &quot;Wolf at the Door,&quot; the band recorded and released other songs as demos, namely &quot;More Matey,&quot; &quot;Maps,&quot; &quot;To the End of the Earth,&quot; &quot;Allemande,&quot; &quot;New One,&quot; &quot;Russian Farmer&#x27;s Song,&quot; and &quot;Live in Fear.&quot; The band have declared they are not against fans sharing tracks unreleased on CD, such as the demos &quot;More Matey&quot; and &quot;Emily&quot;. Chaplin said &quot;They most likely see those recordings as an interesting extra to get hold of— I don&#x27;t see it causing any damage. If it was the album we have coming out leaked early, then I&#x27;d probably feel differently.&quot;

Dominic Scott decided to leave the band in July, a month after &quot;Wolf at the Door&quot; was released, to continue his studies at the LSE. Rice-Oxley referenced this departure in &quot;This Is the Last Time,&quot; which was being rehearsed in May, according to Hughes. Keane was invited by record producer James Sanger in July to his property in Normandy, France, where the band recorded a number of tracks from August to November, including &quot;Sunshine,&quot; &quot;This Is the Last Time,&quot; &quot;Maps&quot; (anew) and &quot;Happy Soldier.&quot; It was during these sessions that the idea of using a piano as lead instrument began to emerge. Sanger received a shared credit for four songs that appeared on Keane&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot;, including &quot;Sunshine&quot;, the only song composed there. The band members returned to England in November.

The band signed with BMG to publish their music in April 2002, and this enabled them to better commit to music, but at this time they did not yet have a recording contract. Sometime in early 2002, Rice-Oxley wrote &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Changing.&quot; He played it for Chaplin, Hughes and people at BMG, and then the band developed the song into a demo completed in July. They also produced a demo of &quot;Walnut Tree&quot; completed in May. 2002 was a hard year for Keane. All recording or live performances were stopped, and Scott&#x27;s feeling of going nowhere was starting to tell on Rice-Oxley and Chaplin. In December, Keane returned to performing live. One gig at the Betsey Trotwood in London was attended by Simon Williams of Fierce Panda Records, the same man who had discovered Coldplay years previously. Williams offered to release the first commercial single by the band. This release was &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Changing&quot;, which Steve Lamacq named single of the week on &quot;Lamacq Live&quot; on 14 April 2003, and came out as a CD single on 12 May. As a result of the attention created by this release and because of the strong live reputation they had built through constant UK touring, a bidding war for the band ensued among major record labels. The band decided to sign with Island Records in summer 2003. After first being attracted to the band by the considerable industry buzz then surrounding them and from hearing &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Changing&quot; on the radio, the Island A&amp;R, Ferdy Unger-Hamilton, told HitQuarters that he wanted to sign them after hearing the five songs &quot;Everybody’s Changing&quot;, &quot;This Is the Last Time&quot;, &quot;She Has No Time&quot;, &quot;Bend and Break&quot; and &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot;, saying &quot;every one of them was brilliant...they had a fantastic live show [but] even if I hadn&#x27;t been able to see them live, I would have tried to sign them anyway.&quot; According to Unger-Hamilton, Keane chose to sign with Island because they got on well with the A&amp;R and were convinced that he did not want to change them in any way.

The band released &quot;This Is the Last Time&quot; on Fierce Panda, in October 2003 as the final release on that label.

===2004–05: &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; and breakthrough===

With the release of their first major single, Keane began to achieve recognition in the United Kingdom and the United States. In January 2004, Keane was named the band most likely to achieve success in the coming year in the BBC&#x27;s Sound of 2004 poll; additionally, this year is popularly referred to as one of the best years for new British music. A month later, Keane&#x27;s first release on Island was &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot;, which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart in February 2004. On 4 May, a re-release of &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Changing&quot; followed and featured new B-sides and a new cover; it reached number four on the UK Singles Chart.

Keane&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; was released on 10 May 2004 in the UK, a day before the band started their first world tour. It debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and became the second best-selling British album of the year. It has been certified 9× platinum in the UK. Drowned in Sound gave it 5 out of 10, accusing Keane of excessively imitating Coldplay (specifically comparing &quot;Your Eyes Open&quot; and &quot;On a Day Like Today&quot; with, respectively, &quot;Daylight&quot; and &quot;Politik&quot; on the band&#x27;s album &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;), criticising the album as being &quot;stylistically all over the place&quot; and its lyrics as being &quot;immature&quot; and &quot;cringe-worthy&quot;. However, it gave credit to the album&#x27;s &quot;fine moments&quot;, praising lead single &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; as &quot;breathtaking&quot;.

The album has sold approximately 5.5 million copies worldwide. In the UK, it stayed in the top 75 of the UK Albums Chart for 72 weeks, appearing again on its 115th week. Post-release, the band released singles from the album &quot;Bedshaped,&quot; &quot;This Is the Last Time&quot; (a version with Island Records) and &quot;Bend and Break&quot; on 16 August, 22 November, and 25 July 2005, respectively. The band won two awards at the 2005 BRIT Awards in February; Best British album for &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot;, and the British breakthrough act award as voted for by listeners of BBC Radio 1. Three months after, Rice-Oxley received the Ivor Novello award for songwriter of the year.

As members of the Make Poverty History, Keane performed &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; and &quot;Bedshaped&quot; at the Live 8 concert, which took place in London on 2 July 2005. Keane are also patrons of War Child, and in September 2005, they recorded a cover version of Elton John&#x27;s &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; to the charity album &quot;&quot;. Previously, the band had recorded a cover of the Walker Brothers&#x27; &quot;The Sun Ain&#x27;t Gonna Shine Anymore&quot;. It also was released as a 7&quot; single as a gift to members of the Keane emailing list. During the year, the band achieved minor recognition in the U.S. from their extensive touring, which culminated with a series of gigs as the opening act for U2. The group were nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best New Artist category along with Sugarland, John Legend, Ciara, and Fall Out Boy.

===2006–07: &quot;Under the Iron Sea&quot;===

In April 2005, in the middle of the Hopes and Fears tour, the band began recording &quot;Under the Iron Sea&quot; with producer Andy Green, who worked with them on &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot;. The band later recruited Mark &quot;Spike&quot; Stent for mixing duties. Recording took place in Helioscentric Studios, where &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot; was recorded. Additional recording was done at The Magic Shop in New York City. The album&#x27;s release was preceded by the release of the &quot;Atlantic&quot;, a download-only music video and the lead single &quot;Is It Any Wonder?&quot;, which reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 2007. The album had a worldwide release in June 2006 and was at number 1 in the UK Albums Chart for the first two weeks of its release. , it had sold more than 2.2 million copies. The third single from the album was &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;, released on 21 August 2006, and reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart. The fourth single from the album was &quot;Nothing in My Way&quot;, released on 30 October 2006, which received particular success on Mexican commercial radio, charting on Top 3 on 13 January 2007 and staying a month on that chart. The band released the single &quot;The Night Sky&quot; in aid of the charity War Child.

Before the release of the album (in May 2006), Keane had started their second world tour. However, because of the extensive touring, on 22 August 2006, Chaplin announced he had admitted himself to a clinic for drinking and drug problems. This initially resulted in the cancellation of three gigs and postponement of their September tour. The entire North American tour was cancelled outright to allow continued treatment. As a result, the upcoming UK and European tours, scheduled for October and November 2006, were considered to be liable for possible postponement depending on Chaplin&#x27;s treatment. Chaplin then left the Priory Clinic in London on 6 October, but he continued to receive treatment. The tour reached for the first time South American countries (Argentina, Chile and Brazil) and saw the band&#x27;s third visit to Mexico in late April with four dates, playing at the downtown zócalo in Mexico City, as well their first visit to Monterrey and Guadalajara. On 7 July 2007, Keane played at the UK leg of Live Earth at Wembley Stadium, part of a series of gigs similar to Live 8, to highlight the threat of global warming. They performed &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot;, &quot;Is It Any Wonder?&quot; and &quot;Bedshaped&quot;. The Under the Iron Sea tour was brought to an end with performances in Oporto, Portugal, and at the Natural Music Festival in El Ejido, Spain on 3 August and 4 respectively.

In 2008, &quot;Under the Iron Sea&quot; was voted the 8th best British album of all time by a poll conducted by &quot;Q&quot; Magazine and HMV. In early October, Concert Live announced they were releasing a limited edition nine-CD set of every Keane live performance in the UK during October 2006 under the name &quot;Live 06&quot;.

===2008–11: &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; and &quot;Night Train&quot;===
In a March 2007 video interview, Chaplin and Hughes spoke of wanting to take a more &quot;organic&quot; approach on album three, but played down suggestions about the use of guitars, referring to them as &quot;a fun part of the live set&quot; at present; however, the cover of &quot;She Sells Sanctuary&quot; became the first song recorded since &quot;The Happy Soldier&quot; (2001) to feature the instrument. Photographic updates to the Keane website implied the use of guitars in the album&#x27;s recording sessions. Jesse Quin joined the band since this album as permanent studio and live member. He plays the bass, percussion, guitar, synths and backing vocals. On 25 August 2008, Keane appeared as studio guests on BBC 6 Music with Steve Lamacq where three of the new songs from &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; were played for the first time: &quot;Spiralling&quot;, &quot;The Lovers Are Losing&quot;, and &quot;Better Than This&quot;.

The album was released on 13 October 2008, and reached number one on the UK Albums Chart on 19 October. It also reached number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. In December 2008, it was voted &quot;Best Album of the Year&quot; by the readers, listeners and visitors of Q Magazine, Q Radio and Qthemusic.com. The song &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; was voted best track. In November 2008, they started the Perfect Symmetry World Tour. On 2 April 2009, Keane became the first band ever to broadcast a live show in 3D. It was filmed at Abbey Road, the site of the world&#x27;s first satellite broadcast (by the Beatles). Keane fans were prompted to buy 3D glasses along with the new 7&quot; single &quot;Better Than This&quot; or also to hand-make their own glasses.

On 10 May 2010, Keane released the EP titled &quot;Night Train&quot; which, on 16 May became their fourth number 1 album in the UK. &quot;Night Train&quot; was recorded during the Perfect Symmetry World Tour. The band first named this record as a mini-album, then that changed to an EP. In an interview, Tim Rice-Oxley said that &quot;Night Train&quot; is &quot;pretty much an album&quot;. The songs &quot;Stop for a Minute&quot; and &quot;Looking Back&quot; feature Somali Canadian rapper K&#x27;naan. The EP includes a cover of the song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Help Yourself&quot; by Yellow Magic Orchestra, featuring vocals by Japanese funk MC Tigarah. The song &quot;Your Love&quot; features Keane&#x27;s keyboardist Tim Rice-Oxley on lead vocals. The song &quot;My Shadow&quot; was featured in the Season 6 &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; episode &quot;Shiny Happy People&quot;. &quot;Night Train&quot; has been met with mixed reviews from critics. Ryan Brockington of the &quot;New York Post&quot; PopWrap called the work &quot;game changing&quot; while writing that the first single &quot;Stop for a Minute&quot; is &quot;just as brilliant&quot; as the album.

Supporting the &quot;Night Train&quot; EP, the band began on the Night Train Tour, which started with a show in Brixton, London at The Fridge on 12 May 2010. The tour includes a homecoming show at the Bedgebury Pinetum, outside the band&#x27;s hometown of Battle. Also festival appearances in Europe followed with a tour of North America, concluding with an appearance at the Mile High Festival in Denver.

===2011–13: &quot;Strangeland&quot;===

After the end of Mt. Desolation Tour (alternative project by Tim and Jesse), Tim Rice-Oxley and Jesse Quin joined the other two members of the band to work on the pre-production of &quot;Strangeland&quot;. It was announced on 3 February 2011 on the band&#x27;s official website that Quin had become an official member of the band. He has worked with Keane since 2007. Keane played a concert in Beijing, China on 13 April 2011 at the invitation of the fashion company Burberry. The band performed an acoustic session at the Wall of China. The band finished recording their fourth studio album on 12 January 2012 and finished mixing the record on 10 February. The album was recorded at Tim Rice-Oxley&#x27;s Sea Fog Studios, in Polegate, East Sussex. The Strangeland Tour started at De La Warr Pavilion in Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex on Friday, 9 March 2012.

The band released &quot;Silenced by the Night&quot;, the album&#x27;s lead single, worldwide except for the United Kingdom on 13 March 2012. Keane performed &quot;Silenced By the Night&quot; for the first time on 12 March on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. The song was sent to U.S. adult alternative radio stations on 26 March 2012. In the UK, the single was released on 15 April 2012. The single &quot;Disconnected&quot; was released on 20 April 2012 in Germany, Switzerland and Austria, with the official worldwide release on 8 October 2012. The single &quot;Sovereign Light Café&quot; was released on 23 July 2012. The video was filmed in Bexhill-on-Sea in Sussex, England.

===2013–19: &quot;The Best of Keane&quot; and hiatus===
Keane released the compilation album &quot;The Best of Keane&quot; in November 2013. Two new songs recorded during &quot;Strangeland&quot; were released from the compilation album; &quot;Higher Than the Sun&quot; was released on 28 September 2013 and &quot;Won&#x27;t Be Broken&quot; was released on 20 January 2014.

On 20 October 2013, several publications, including &quot;The Sun&quot; and Digital Spy, claimed that Keane intended to split following the release of &quot;The Best of Keane&quot;, and reported that the band members were &quot;taking a break...to pursue their own projects.&quot; On 21 October 2013, Tom Chaplin clarified on Real Radio Yorkshire that the band was not splitting up, but the band members would like to &quot;take a bit of time out from being Keane&quot; after being busy for the past few years.

In an interview conducted in late 2017 with a correspondent from &quot;The Sun&quot;, Tom Chaplin stated that he felt that he was too old to reform and relaunch the band. He recorded a solo album titled &quot;The Wave&quot;, released on 14 October 2016. He released follow-up Christmas-themed second album &quot;Twelve Tales of Christmas&quot; on 17 November 2017. Rice-Oxley and Quin continued side project Mt. Desolation, releasing the album &quot;When the Night Calls&quot; on 25 May 2018.

During the band&#x27;s hiatus, the band has reunited three times: on 8 August 2015, Chaplin and Rice-Oxley performed a Keane setlist at Battle Festival. On 11 September 2016, the band released a music video for &quot;Tear Up This Town&quot;, written and recorded for the film &quot;A Monster Calls&quot;.

=== 2019–present: Return and &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;===

Toward the end of 2018, Keane posted a series of cryptic images onto their various social media accounts, hinting that the quartet were in the studio working on material. On 17 January 2019, an article from &quot;The Sun&quot; revealed that the band are planning &quot;to make a comeback after six years away&quot; and that a &quot;source close to the rockers has revealed the band is ready to work together again after &#x27;putting their differences to one side&#x27;&quot;. On 6 February, Keane posted an image of them on their various social media accounts. This was followed by several announcements on their Instagram and Facebook sites of various festivals in which the band would perform, including Cornbury Music Festival (6 July 2019), 4ever Valencia Fest in Spain (21 July 2019), MEO Marés Vivas in Portugal (19 July 2019), Noches del Botánico in Madrid (20 July 2019), and Hello Festival in The Netherlands (9 June). On 15 March 2019, Keane performed their song &quot;Somewhere Only We Know&quot; on Comic Relief&#x27;s Red Nose Day on BBC One with London Contemporary Voices. On 26 March 2019, Keane posted &quot;We’ve been desperate to tell you that we’re busy making another album, which we’ll be releasing later this year&quot; to their Facebook page.

On 17 May 2019, Keane released an EP titled &quot;Retroactive EP1&quot; featuring &quot;our favourite archived live performances, older demos and random treasures&quot;. On 6 June 2019, the band released the first new single from &quot;Cause and Effect&quot;, titled &quot;The Way I Feel&quot;. On 16 June 2019, Keane performed a set at the Isle of Wight Festival, being the closing act of the event. On 8 August 2019, the second single, &quot;Love Too Much&quot;, was released for streaming and debuted on &quot;The Breakfast Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2. Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, writing &quot;Not a game-changing comeback by any means, &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; is instead a satisfying return to form that manages to gracefully age Keane by invigorating a familiar formula with wisdom and honesty learned over a dramatic, life-changing decade.&quot; On 9 April 2021, Keane announced on their social media platforms they would be participating in Record Store Day 2021 Drop 2 on 17 July, with the special early release of their &quot;Dirt&quot; EP on 12&quot; vinyl, featuring four previously unreleased tracks from the &quot;Cause and Effect&quot; sessions. On 17 July, the video for the EP&#x27;s title track was released onto YouTube and Apple Music, coinciding with the limited early release of the 12&quot; vinyl of the EP for Record Store Day. This came with the announcement that the full release of the EP would take place on 13 August 2021. The band played a handful of shows that same year, including an appearance at that year&#x27;s TRNSMT Festival in Glasgow.

The band undertook a brief tour of the UK in June and July of 2022, including a performance at Belgium&#x27;s Rock Werchter festival. Later that year, Chaplin released his third studio album &quot;Midpoint&quot; in September 2022. In an interview with &quot;Retro Pop&quot; magazine, Chaplin said that people &quot;keep asking&quot; him about Keane and whether they will make another record. &quot;I don&#x27;t know,&quot; he said in response. &quot;I will just see how I feel.&quot;

In September 2023, the band announced they would undertake a tour of the UK, Europe and the Americas in 2024 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of &quot;Hopes and Fears&quot;. The tour will commence in May, coinciding with the album&#x27;s reissue, and continue on into September.

==Collaborations==
In November 2004, Keane collaborated with electronic DJ Faultline on a cover of the Elton John song &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot;. Two years later, Rice-Oxley collaborated with Gwen Stefani as a co-writer of the song &quot;Early Winter&quot;, released later in 2007 as a single, from her album &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot;. Stefani had been wishing to work with the band since 2005, and Rice-Oxley responded by saying &quot;we might give it a go&quot;. Tom Chaplin collaborated with Rocco Deluca and the Burden on the song &quot;Mercy&quot;. The band collaborated with Somali-Canadian rapper K&#x27;naan and Japanese Baile Funk singer Tigarah on the EP &quot;Night Train&quot;. In late 2009, Rice-Oxley collaborated with the Australian singer Kylie Minogue as co-writer of the song &quot;Everything Is Beautiful&quot;, for Minogue&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Aphrodite&quot;, released in June 2010.
The band collaborated with dance artist Chicane on a remix of the song &quot;Bend &amp; Break&quot;, renamed &quot;Wake Up&quot;. It was featured on the artist&#x27;s 2008 best-of compilation. In 2012, Tom Chaplin collaborated with the Dutch singer Laura Jansen on the song &quot;Same Heart&quot; for a Dutch charity radio programme. The track was featured on Jansen&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Elba&quot;. In 2017, a version of Tom Chaplin&#x27;s solo track &quot;Solid Gold&quot;, featuring alternative pop singer JONES, was released as a single.

==Musical style and themes==
Tim Rice-Oxley and Dominic Scott were the main writers of the band&#x27;s songs during their early years. When Scott left in 2001, Rice-Oxley became the main composer. However, Rice-Oxley credits the rest of the band on all compositions, so that royalties for song credits are shared.

Keane usually harbours an ample, reverberated, melodic, slow- to mid-tempo fully orchestrated sound, somehow reminiscent of Elton John&#x27;s early and middle career, and their more introspective songs have brought comparisons to Suede and Jeff Buckley.

While guitars have been (minimally) present even in their early work, their appearance in the final mix has always been slight, and while Chaplin has stepped up as an almost full-time guitarist in the band, that instrument is never featured as prominently as to be more than barely noticed. For this matter, they have been dubbed as &quot;the band with no guitars&quot;, thanks to their heavily piano-based sound. By using delay and distortion effects on their pianos and similar keyboards, they often create sounds that aren&#x27;t immediately recognisable as piano. Rice-Oxley said during an interview in Los Angeles that they tend to think piano-related music is boring and what they really wanted to do was try something different. He referred to the piano as an odd instrument to form part of a rock band instrumentation, comparing it to the Beatles&#x27; set of instruments. Rice-Oxley&#x27;s distortion piano has been key to most of Keane&#x27;s multifaceted style and most definitely their most recognizable asset.

Keane have covered songs by artists such as U2, Rufus Wainwright, Depeche Mode, Genesis, the Beatles, the Cult and Queen. Rice-Oxley said &quot;I guess it&#x27;s classic song writing that is the main influence rather than one band in particular – we love people like Nick Drake who can convey so much emotion and write songs and albums that will be loved and cherished for many years – the things that will be in people&#x27;s record collections for their whole lives.&quot;

<text>The Hereford Inlet Lighthouse is a historic lighthouse located in North Wildwood, New Jersey, situated on the southern shore of Hereford Inlet at the north end of Five Mile Beach. Its construction was completed and it became operational in 1874.

The tower and its beacon are visible for up to .

== History ==
Hereford Inlet, a break in the barrier islands along the eastern side of Cape May, was first used by whalers in the 17th century. Though the area was frequented, environmental conditions such as shifting sandbars and strong currents created reason for concern and in 1849, a life-saving station was built along the inlet. With shipwrecks on the rise throughout America, the United States Life Saving Service was founded 22 years later and a larger Life-Saving Station replaced the existing one. After being on Hereford Inlet for only one year, the United States Life Saving Service recognized the need for a lighthouse and included in its annual report that, &quot;A small light, say a fourth order, is respectfully recommended for this place, as it would be of importance to the coal trade and to steamers navigating the Delaware Bay and River, and to mark the entrance to the inlet, where there is a good harbor of refuge for small coasting vessels.&quot; Finally, on June 10, 1872, Congress acted to fund the erection of a fourth-order light along the New Jersey shoreline. On July 7, 1873, Humphrey S. Cresse sold the site to the U.S. government for $150. The lighthouse was designed by Paul J. Pelz, who also designed Hereford Inlet&#x27;s sister stations, Point Fermin Light in San Pedro, California; East Brother Island Light in Richmond, California; Mare Island Light (demolished in the 1930s) in Carquinez Strait, California; Point Hueneme Light (replaced in 1940) in California, and Point Adams Light (burned down by the Lighthouse Service in 1912) in Washington state, all in essentially the same style. The United States Army Corps of Engineers undertook construction of the lighthouse on November 8, 1873, on a design by Pelz, and completed it on March 30, 1874. A &quot;Notice to Mariners&quot; issued May 11, 1874, announced the operation of the light on the north end of Five Mile Beach.

Hereford Inlet Lighthouse withstood many potential dangers. One of the noted environmental dangers included a storm that hit September 8–12, 1889. According to Mid-Atlantic Hurricanes the storm &quot;occurred when [a hurricane] stalled off the coast … producing erosive, enveloping surf and covering part or all of many barrier islands.&quot; Many residents of historic Anglesea fled to the lighthouse for shelter. A more severe storm in August 1913 brought the water dangerously close to the lighthouse, damaging the foundation and threatening the structure. The lighthouse was temporarily closed and the structure was moved west. It reopened in 1914. A fire later threatened the structure in 1938 while the current keeper, Ferdinand Heinzman, was painting the structure. According to Lighthouse Friends, &quot;A coastguardsman … noticed thick smoke emanating from one of the upstairs windows, called the fire department, and then alerted the occupants of the imminent danger.&quot; Heinzman attempted to extinguish the fire but was deterred by the fire. &quot;Undaunted, he procured a ladder and equipped with a garden hose, he climbed to the second story and fought the fire through a window… and saved the lighthouse … An investigation determined that spontaneous combustion had started the fire.&quot;

The light was decommissioned in 1964 when the United States Coast Guard constructed an automated skeletal light tower. It is disputed as to when the lighthouse and adjoining Life-Saving Station were turned over to the New Jersey State Police&#x27;s Marine Services Unit. It is argued that the transfer occurred in 1963, just before the tower was constructed, other say that it occurred when the buildings were no longer needed. The Life Saving Station remains used by the New Jersey State Police today, however, the lighthouse was boarded up and left unused until 1982 when locals petitioned to take over the building. In 1986, the light (DCB-24) was transferred from the skeletal tower into the lighthouse. The grounds were taken over by North Wildwood&#x27;s superintendent of parks, Steve Murray. At the time of the lighthouse&#x27;s closure, it had been painted white with red trim and blue shutters; in 2003, it was restored to its historically accurate buff color. The current VRB-25 beacon was installed on July 19, 2018. As an active aid to navigation, the beacon in the lighthouse tower continues to be maintained by the United States Coast Guard.

Today, Hereford Inlet Lighthouse operates as a fully operating lighthouse and museum. It operates under the City of North Wildwood and the city&#x27;s North Wildwood Historical Commission. The lighthouse is listed on both the National and State Registers of Historic Places as of 1977 and it is part of the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail. It is operated and maintained with money generated through donations and Lighthouse fundraising projects.

== Keepers ==
John Marche served as the first lighthouse keeper for less than three months before drowning when his rowboat overturned on returning from the mainland. The next keeper, Freeling &quot;Captain&quot; Hewitt, an American Civil War veteran, served that position for the longest time, 45 years.

<text>Rhythmbox is a free and open-source audio player software, tag editor and music organizer for digital audio files on Linux and Unix-like systems.

Rhythmbox is designed to work well under GNOME, but can function on other desktop environments. It is very scalable, able to handle libraries with tens of thousands of songs with ease. It provides a full feature set including full support for Unicode, fast but powerful tag editing, and a variety of plug-ins.

Rhythmbox is the default audio player on many Linux distributions including Fedora, Ubuntu since v12.04 LTS, and Linux Mint as of version 18.1.

==Features==
Rhythmbox offers a significant number of features, including:

===Music playback===
Playback from a variety of digital music sources is supported. The most common playback is music stored locally as files on the computer (the &#x27;Library&#x27;). Rhythmbox supports playing streamed Internet radio and podcasts as well. The ReplayGain standard is also supported. Rhythmbox also supports searching of music in the library.

Playlists may be created to group and order music. Users may also create &#x27;smart playlists,&#x27; ones that are automatically updated (like a database query) based on a customized rule of selection criteria rather than an arbitrary list of tracks. Music may be played back in shuffle (random) mode or repeat mode.

Track ratings are supported and used by the shuffle mode algorithm to play higher-rated tracks more often.

===Gapless playback===
Enabling the crossfading backend option with a duration of 0.0 switches Rhythmbox into gapless playback mode for music formats that support it. Gapless playback is not enabled by default.

===Music importing===
* Audio CD ripping
* Comprehensive audio format support through GStreamer
* iPod support
* Android support

===Audio CD burning===
Since the 0.9 release, Rhythmbox can create audio CDs from playlists.

===Album cover display===
Since the 0.9.5 release, Rhythmbox can display cover art of the currently playing album. The plugin can search the internet to find corresponding artwork, and as of 0.12.6, can read artwork from ID3 tags. If an image file is saved in the same directory as the audio track this is used instead.

===SoundCloud===
Rhythmbox can browse and play sounds from SoundCloud, via built-in SoundCloud plugin.

===Song lyrics display===
Since the 0.9.5 release, Rhythmbox can provide song lyrics of the currently playing song by pressing [ctrl + L], as long as the lyrics are stored in a lyrics database.

===Audio scrobbling===
Rhythmbox can submit played songs info to a remote scrobbling service. This information is used by the remote service to provide user specific music recommendations. Rhythmbox currently supports three scrobbling services:
* Last.fm 
* Libre.fm, the open-source drop-in replacement
* ListenBrainz

Music can be scrobbled to all services at the same time.

===DAAP music sharing===
Rhythmbox supports sharing music and playing shared music on local network via DAAP sharing plugin. The plugin uses libdmapsharing to provide this feature.

===Devices===
Rhythmbox uses the Linux udev subsystem to detect player devices.

===Podcasting===
Rhythmbox can subscribe to podcasts from the iTunes Store, Miroguide or by manually providing a podcast feed URL. Subsequently, new podcasts are automatically downloaded and available from the Library under the section Podcasts.

===Web remote control===
Rhythmbox can be controlled remotely with a Web browser, via inbuilt Web remote control plugin.

==Plug-ins==
Rhythmbox has a plug-in API for C, Python, or Vala.

There are nearly 50 third party plug-ins for Rhythmbox. including a 10 Band audio Equalizer, and many official plug-ins including:

* Cover art search
* Audio CD Player
* Last.fm / Libre.fm / Listenbrainz
* DAAP Music Sharing

<doc id="685523" wikidata="Q15673297" url="?curid=685523" title="Provinces of Laos">
<text>Laos, officially the &quot;Lao People&#x27;s Democratic Republic&quot;, is divided into 17 provinces (Lao ແຂວງ, , , , or ) and one prefecture, the Vientiane capital city municipality (ນະຄອນຫຼວງ, nakhon luang, or &quot;Na Kone Luang Vientiane&quot;). The special administrative zone (ເຂດພິເສດ, &quot;khet phiset&quot;), Xaisomboun, created in 1994, was dissolved on 13 January 2006. In 2013, parts of the former special administrative zone was reestablished as Xaisomboun province.

==Provinces and prefectures of Laos==

=== Population ===
The population of each province in 2023 is given in the census data. The population of Laos in 2023 is 6,730,000.

== History ==
In 1989 Vientiane prefecture was split from Vientiane province and the capital of Vientiane province moved from Vientiane to Muang Phôn-Hông. In 1994 Xaisômboun khetphiset (special region) was formed from parts of the Bolikhamxai, Vientiane, and Xiangkhoang provinces. In 2006 Xaisomboun special region was dissolved and the Longsan, Xaysomboun, Phun, and Hom districts added to Vientiane province, while Thathon district was transferred to Xiengkhuang province.

== Further divisions ==
The provinces are then subdivided into districts (&quot;muang&quot;) and villages (&quot;baan&quot;).

== Geography ==
The provinces are grouped geographically into 3 regions: Northern (Phongsaly, Luang Prabang, Houaphanh, Bokeo, Louang Namtha, Oudomxay, Saiyabouly), Central (Vientiane, Bolikhamxay, Xaisomboun, Xiengkhouang, Khammouane, Savannakhet) and Southern Laos (Champasak, Salavan, Sekong, Attapeu).

<doc id="685527" wikidata="Q287167" url="?curid=685527" title="San Joaquins">
<text>The San Joaquins is a passenger train service operated by Amtrak in California&#x27;s San Joaquin Valley. Seven daily round trips run between its southern terminus at Bakersfield and Stockton, with onward service to Sacramento (two round trips) and Oakland (five round trips). For Fiscal year 2025, two additional trips to Sacramento will be added.

The &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service is unique in the state and nation because of its extensive network of dedicated Amtrak Thruway bus routes that are critical to the performance of the service. Over 55% of passengers on the service use one of these bus routes during part of their trip. Amtrak Thruway routes are timed to meet trains and offer connections to points in Southern California (including Los Angeles Union Station where passengers can continue their journey on the &quot;Pacific Surfliner&quot; or Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance trains), the city of San Francisco, the Central Coast, the North Coast, the High Desert (including Las Vegas), Redding, Reno, and the Yosemite Valley.

The &quot;San Joaquins&quot; is Amtrak&#x27;s seventh-busiest service in the nation and the railroad&#x27;s third-busiest in the state of California. During fiscal year 2023, the service carried 847,364 passengers, a 19.3% increase from the prior year.

Like all regional trains in California, the San Joaquins service is operated by a joint powers authority. The San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority (SJJPA) is governed by a board that includes two elected representatives from each of eight counties the train travels through. The SJJPA contracts with the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission to provide day-to-day management of the service, Amtrak to operate the trains, and Transit Services America to maintain the rolling stock (locomotives and passenger cars). The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) provides the funding to operate the service and also owns the rolling stock.

==History==

===&quot;Golden Gate/San Joaquin Daylight&quot;===
The &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service runs over lines that once hosted several passenger trains a day. The top trains were the &quot;Golden Gate&quot; on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway (predecessor to BNSF), and the &quot;San Joaquin Daylight&quot; on the Southern Pacific Railroad (later acquired by Union Pacific). Prior to 1960s service cutbacks passenger service continued south of Bakersfield, to Glendale and Los Angeles.

In April 1965, as ridership on passenger trains continued to drop, the Santa Fe Railway received permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission to severely curtail &quot;Golden Gate&quot; operations, with service finally abandoned three years later. The &quot;San Joaquin Daylight&quot; was discontinued with the start-up of Amtrak in May 1971.

Other passenger trains that ran through the Central Valley included Southern Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Owl Limited&quot; and Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Chief&quot; and &quot;Valley Flyer&quot;.
===Amtrak era===
Amtrak routed all Los Angeles-San Francisco service over the Southern Pacific&#x27;s Coast Line in its initial 1971 route structure, leaving the San Joaquin Valley without service. Both the Southern Pacific&#x27;s &quot;San Joaquin Daylight&quot; and the Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco Chief&quot; had served the region. Beginning in 1972 Amtrak revisited the decision at the urging of area congressmen, notably Bernice F. Sisk, who favored service between Oakland and Barstow or, failing that, Barstow and Sacramento. The first run was on March 5, 1974 – revenue service began the following day with one daily round-trip between Bakersfield and Oakland and bus connections from Bakersfield to Los Angeles and Oakland to San Francisco. The &quot;San Joaquin&quot; could not continue south of Bakersfield due to capacity limits over the Tehachapi Loop, the only line between Bakersfield and points south and one of the world&#x27;s busiest single-track freight rail lines. Amtrak chose the Santa Fe route over the Southern Pacific, citing the higher speed of the Santa Fe – versus  – and freight congestion on the Southern Pacific. The decision was not without controversy, with Sisk alleging that the Southern Pacific lobbied the Nixon administration to influence the decision.

Madera station and Richmond station were added on October 30, 1977, along with a Stockton–Sacramento connecting bus. The schedule was changed on July 19, 1979, with an earlier northbound and later southbound departure, allowing single-day round trips to the Bay Area.
===Caltrans era===

In 1979 Amtrak proposed discontinuing the &quot;San Joaquin&quot; as part of system-wide reductions ordered by the Carter administration. The state of California stepped in to provide a yearly subsidy of (then) $700,000 ($ adjusted for inflation) to cover the train&#x27;s operating losses, and it was retained. The state asked Amtrak to add a second round-trip between Oakland and Bakersfield and to extend the service south over the Tehachapi Pass to Los Angeles. Amtrak added the second train on February 4, 1980, but attempts to extend the train over the Tehachapi Loop failed due to Southern Pacific&#x27;s opposition.

A third round trip was added on December 17, 1989. Two days later, southbound &quot;San Joaquin&quot; train 708 collided with a tractor-trailer rig at a crossing east of Stockton, killing the driver of the rig and two Amtrak engineers. A fourth round trip was added on October 25, 1992. On May 16, 1999, Amtrak added a Sacramento–Bakersfield round trip - the fifth daily &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service round trip. A second Sacramento–Bakersfield round trip was added on March 18, 2002, along with an infill station at .
===Transfer to local control===
Expansion of the service would stagnate after 2002, and 10 years later, frustrated by what was perceived to be Caltrans&#x27; slow response to regional concerns, local leaders pushed lawmakers to allow local control of the &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service. On September 29, 2012, Governor Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1779, which enabled regional government agencies to form the San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority (SJJPA) to assume administration and management of the route, while the state of California would continue to fund operations. Under the joint powers authority model, the service would be governed by a board composed of eight elected officials, appointed by an agency in each of the counties the train travels through. The governance structure was modeled after the Capitol Corridor Joint Powers Authority, which has been operating the Capitol Corridor regional train in Northern California since 1998.

The first SJJPA Board meeting was held on March 22, 2013, to begin planning for the shift in control. In that time, the SJJPA board contracted with the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission to provide day-to-day management of the service and contracted with Amtrak to continue to operate the service and maintain the rolling stock (locomotives and passenger cars). Control of the train service shifted from Caltrans to the SJJPA on July 1, 2015.

A fifth Oakland–Bakersfield round trip was added to the service on June 20, 2016, the first expansion of the service in more than 14 years.

Two years later, the SJJPA established an early-morning &quot;Morning Express Service&quot; between Fresno and Sacramento, allowing same-day trips to the state capitol for the first time, was expected to result in increased ridership from business travelers. The change was criticized by Bakersfield-area officials, because it required ending the last southbound train of the day in Fresno, reduced daily service to Bakersfield by one daily round trip. The service began on May 7, 2018, but proved to be unpopular, with ridership counts showing an average of just 50 people on the train, compared to 130 with the old timetable. The &quot;Morning Express Service&quot; was eliminated one year later on May 6, 2019, and trains were reverted to their previous schedule.

Sacramento service was discontinued and one round-trip to Oakland was cancelled on March 25, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The cancelled Oakland trip was reinstated on June 28, 2021.
===Planned expansion===

 the agency is increasing capacity on its routes to avoid conflicts with freight trains and add additional trips as well as plan for connections to the California High-Speed Rail system. These improvements are being done in cooperation with Altamont Corridor Express (ACE) as part of the Valley Rail project.

The Stockton Diamond, a level junction in Stockton where the two &quot;San Joaquin&quot; routes diverge, was the busiest rail junction in the state by 2019. As part of the Valley Rail project, these lines will be grade separated: the north-south Union Pacific line is planned to be elevated over the BNSF line. This project is expected to finish construction in Summer 2027 (as of Dec 2024). 
Two additional Sacramento round trips are planned to be added, routed over the Union Pacific Railroad Sacramento Subdivision north of Stockton and west of the present route, which uses the Fresno Subdivision north of Stockton. Unlike the 1999-initiated route, the Sacramento Subdivision has spare capacity to allow the increased service. Six new stations are planned: Lodi (distinct from the Lodi Transit Station), Elk Grove, three locations in Sacramento, and Natomas. Trains operating on the Sacramento Subdivision route will not serve the existing Sacramento Valley Station, but SacRT light rail connections and a shuttle bus to Sacramento International Airport are planned elsewhere.

When the Valley Rail project is complete, ACE will share the route to Natomas from Stockton and add an additional branch south to Ceres in 2023 with an extension to Merced in 2027. When the Natomas runs are initiated, one existing Oakland trip is planned to terminate at Stockton-Downtown, freeing a slot for a full Natomas to Bakersfield round-trip while continuing to provide five trips from the Bay Area.

The San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority will serve as the high-speed rail service provider in the Valley per a memorandum of understanding with the California High-Speed Rail Authority. Upon completion of the high-speed rail initial operating segment, trains are expected to terminate at that system&#x27;s new Merced station to act as a feeder to high-speed service. A new rail link is planned to run between the BNSF line currently used and the Union Pacific subdivision on which that station is planned in order to facilitate trips and transfers. Sacramento to Merced service is thus planned to increase in frequency to hourly service.

, Oakland to Bakersfield trips take just over six hours, which requires an expensive crew change in Merced. The SJJPA wishes to reduce travel times to eliminate this expense, which may involve terminating some trains at Emeryville, skipping stops on some trains, increasing current speeds to , and/or operational improvements like decreasing dwell times. Longer-term proposals include extending Oakland trains to Oakland Coliseum station to provide service to Oakland International Airport and a second BART connection; routing some trains via the ACE route through the Tri-Valley; consolidating all Stockton service at Robert J. Cabral Station; and extensions to Marysville/Yuba City, Oroville, or Redding. The SJJPA ultimately plans to increase Sacramento service to hourly headways.

In December 2023, the Federal Railroad Administration accepted an application by Caltrans to enter the &quot;San Joaquins&quot; route into its Corridor Identification and Development Program. Proposed improvements include additional frequencies and an extension north to Chico and Redding. The program grants $500,000 toward service planning and prioritizes the corridor for future federal funding.
In 2024, the Butte County Association of Governments released a Strategic plan, named North Valley Rail to extend The San Joaquins service to Chico. Construction is expected to commence in 2029.

==Route==

The &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service runs from Bakersfield&#x27;s Truxtun Avenue station northward on BNSF Railway&#x27;s Mojave Subdivision within Bakersfield, the Bakersfield Subdivision from Bakersfield to Calwa (Fresno), then on the Stockton Subdivision from Calwa to Stockton.

At the Stockton Diamond the routes split to Oakland or Sacramento.

The Oakland trains continue west on the Stockton Subdivision to Port Chicago. At Port Chicago they cross to the Union Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Tracy Subdivision to Martinez, continue on the Martinez Subdivision to Emeryville, and finally travel a few miles on the Niles Subdivision to Oakland&#x27;s Jack London Square station.

Trains to the Sacramento Valley Station diverge in Stockton and run north to Sacramento on Union Pacific&#x27;s Fresno Subdivision and on the Martinez Subdivision within Sacramento.

If the tracks for the Central Valley segment of California High-Speed Rail (HSR) are completed prior to that system&#x27;s full startup, there are calls for the &quot;San Joaquins&quot; trains to use the HSR infrastructure to speed up traditional rail service to 125 mph.

The route is Amtrak&#x27;s seventh-busiest service in the nation and the railroad&#x27;s third-busiest in the state of California.

== Stations and connections ==
The &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service has an extensive network of dedicated Amtrak Thruway buses. Over 55% of passengers on the route used an Amtrak Thruway bus on at least one end of their trip.

== Statistics ==

=== Annual ridership ===

== Rolling stock ==
For its first two years of operation, the &quot;San Joaquin&quot; used single-level coaches Amtrak had inherited from other railroads. In October 1976, Amtrak introduced new Amfleet coaches to the service. From 1987 to 1989 Amtrak used Superliner and ex-ATSF Hi-Level coaches. For a short period beginning on June 15, 1987, this included a full dining car on one of the trains. Amtrak reequipped the &quot;San Joaquin&quot; trains again in 1989, this time with new Horizon coaches, when service expanded to three daily round-trips. The &quot;San Joaquin&quot; began receiving Superliner-derived, bi-level California Cars in 1995. The bi-level fleet was supplemented by a fleet of single-level Comet Cars (refurbished NJ Transit cars) between 2013 and 2024. Between 2024 and 2026, both the bi-level and Comet Car fleets are expected to be replaced by Siemens Venture trainsets.

Daily inspections, cleaning, and maintenance of equipment are conducted in Oakland, Bakersfield, and Sacramento. Heavy maintenance is performed by Transit Services America in Stockton. Previously, all maintenance took place in Oakland, but both the &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; and &quot;San Joaquins&quot; voted to shift to a new contractor in 2023, citing the contractor&#x27;s ability to adhere to high maintenance quality and cleanliness and be more agile with overhaul projects.

=== Locomotives ===

The &quot;San Joaquins&quot; and &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; share a combined fleet of 13 EMD F59PHI and ten Siemens Charger SC-44 locomotives.

The Charger locomotives meet EPA Tier IV emission standards and are capable of operating at 125 mph in revenue service. Many of the F59PHI have been re-engined to meet more stringent EPA Tier II emission standards.

These locomotives are owned by Caltrans and carry its CDTX reporting marks. Amtrak-owned locomotives are also occasionally used on the &quot;San Joaquin&quot;, including the P42DC.

=== California Car bi-level trainsets ===

The &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service is equipped with Amtrak California&#x27;s fleet of California Car bi-level, high-capacity passenger cars owned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Each trainset typically consists of two coach cars, a coach/baggage car, a café (food service) car, and a cab/coach car. The cab/coach car is similar to other coaches but with an engineer&#x27;s operating cab and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode, which eliminates the need to turn the train at each end-point. Caltrans is in the process of refitting the cab/coach cars to have a space on the car&#x27;s lower level for storage for checked luggage and bikes.

Caltrans also owns several Surfliner bi-level cars that are used on some &quot;San Joaquins&quot; trainsets. The newer cars look very similar to the California Car fleet but feature reclining seats, open overhead luggage racks, and a restroom on the upper level of each car.

The bi-level cars have doors that can operated remotely on either side of the train from a single point of control. This feature allows the operator to maximize passenger flow in boarding and alighting operations, and thereby minimizing station dwell time.
=== Comet Car single-level trainsets ===

Increasing ridership on the &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service led Caltrans to purchase 14 Comet IB rail cars from New Jersey Transit in 2008 for $75,000 each. The former commuter cars were refurbished and reconfigured by Amtrak&#x27;s Beech Grove Shops to serve as intercity coaches at a cost of approximately $20 million. The refurbished cars have reclining seats with tray tables, WiFi, two power outlets at each seat pair, luggage racks, trash/recycling bins, a restroom, and six workstation tables in the center of the car.

Caltrans also pays to lease three Non-Powered Control Units (F40PH locomotives converted into cab/baggage cars) from Amtrak. The agency also previously paid to lease three Horizon dinettes to serve as café cars. The Horizon dinettes were eventually returned to Amtrak, and conductors offer free snacks and water bottles instead.

Caltrans had planned to use the Comet Car trainsets on trains starting in July 2013, but the refurbishing process took longer than expected. The first Comet Car trainset was put into regular service on October 21, 2013, and the second trainset was put into regular service on April 15, 2014. The addition of the Comet Cars to the fleet allowed Caltrans to break up two bi-level trainsets and use the cars to add another coach car to each of the &quot;San Joaquins&quot;&#x27; remaining California Car trainsets, along with adding cars to some &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; trainsets.

The Comet Cars have major limitations for &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service, such as their manually-operated doors, which slow down boarding. The Comets have high floors and lack integrated wheelchair lifts, so passengers in wheelchairs must be lifted onto trains with a portable, hand-cranked lift.

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the Comet Cars have seen less use. One of the trainsets has been broken up, with its cars inserted into other trainsets on the &quot;San Joaquins&quot; service. In this use, the Comet Cars do not carry passengers, and serve to meet a minimum train length requirement imposed by BNSF. &quot;San Joaquins&quot; trains are required to have a minimum of 28 axles to protect against track circuit malfunctions, an issue known as &quot;loss of shunt.&quot; When not properly mitigated, loss of shunt can interfere with the safe operation of block signaling systems, and can prevent grade crossing signals from activating. 

Caltrans plans to reassign the Comet Cars to services in Southern California when the full fleet of Siemens Venture cars is delivered.
=== Siemens Venture single-level trainsets ===

In November 2017, the California Department of Transportation announced that it would be ordering seven Siemens Venture trainsets through its contractor Sumitomo Corporation. The state had initially contracted Sumitomo, which in turn subcontracted with Nippon Sharyo, to build the Next Generation Bi-Level Passenger Rail Car, but a prototype car failed a buff strength test in August 2015. After the test failure, Sumitomo canceled its contract with Nippon Sharyo, and turned to Siemens to be the new subcontractor. The cars are being built at the Siemens factory in Florin, California, and will be hauled by California&#x27;s existing fleet of diesel-electric locomotives.

California&#x27;s trainsets will be used exclusively on the San Joaquins service and will consist of seven cars each: five coaches with economy seating, a café car, and one cab car (control car) with economy seating and a compartment for checked baggage. The order includes 49 cars for California, formed into seven semi-permanently coupled trainsets. The advantage of semi-permanently coupled trainsets is a more seamless gangway between cars to allow for easier movement from car-to-car, including the ability to move between cars in a wheelchair.

Like the earlier bi-level cars, the Venture trainsets have doors that can operated remotely on either side of the train from a single point of control. This feature allows the operator to maximize passenger flow in boarding and alighting operations, and thereby minimizing station dwell time. To accommodate the low-level platforms along the line, the Venture cars also have automatically deployed stair steps. Since Siemens Venture trainsets were originally designed to be used with high platforms, the SJJPA modify all stations, adding two mini-high platforms (short lengths of high platform, each long enough for one door, with an accessible ramp to the longer low platform). The cars will also be equipped with electrically operated wheelchair lifts.

The first trainset was supposed to go into revenue service in 2020, though Caltrans only began accepting deliveries of the new rolling stock in late 2022. The first trainset entered service on December 21, 2023, operating on trains 710 and 719. The SJJPA plans to have four Venture trainsets in service by the end of 2024, with all seven trainsets in service by early 2026.

=== Future ===
In September 2022, CalSTA ordered four hydrogen-powered trainsets from Stadler Rail, with delivery expected in early 2027. The trainsets will be used for the Merced–Sacramento portion of the &quot;San Joaquins&quot; after the first segment of California High-Speed Rail begins service. The order includes an option for 25 additional trainsets for Amtrak California services.

<text>Memphis International Raceway (formerly known as Memphis Motorsports Park) was an auto racing park located near the Loosahatchie River in Shelby County, Tennessee, United States, approximately ten miles south of Millington, and a few miles north of the city of Memphis.

==History==
The Memphis International Raceway (more commonly known as MIR) was founded in 1986 by Ed Gatlin, who along with a group of investors, bought a 400-acre tract of land within the northeastern section of Shelby County, and built a drag strip with an adjacent road course, including a dirt track and a go-kart track.
The facility opened in 1987 with a drag strip and road course. It includes a tri-oval short track, built in 1998, which once hosted the NASCAR Nationwide Series and NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, as well as an ASA Late Model Series race. The drag strip hosts events such as International Hot Rod Association (IHRA) World Finals and Nitro Jam, Professional Drag Racers Association (PDRA), HOT ROD Power Tour, Super Chevy Show, Fun Ford Series and Mega Mopar Action Series.

The entire facility was purchased by the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach in 1996, and in 1997, a ¾-mile paved tri-oval was added on the site of the old dirt track, while a new dirt track was built on the site of the former go-kart track. The name of the facility was also changed to Memphis Motorsports Park and the tri-oval opened on June 5, 1998.

The following month, Memphis Motorsports Park was acquired by Dover Motorsports in connection with its purchase of the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach. Memphis Motorsports Park closed October 30, 2009, due to lack of finances. Its parent company, Dover Motorsports, Inc. announced that it was ceasing all operations at Memphis Motorsports Park and that it would not be promoting any events in Memphis in 2010. The Memphis facility was under an agreement of sale to Gulf Coast Entertainment but Gulf Coast was unable to secure financing. The track&#x27;s Camping World Truck Series date was moved to Nashville Superspeedway and its Nationwide Series date to Gateway International Raceway, and later abandoned after a year. Dover Motorsports, Inc. auctioned off the complex on December 14, 2010, to Palm Beach International Raceway for $1.9 million.

It was announced on January 31, 2011, that the deal between Palm Beach International and Dover Motorsports was finalized, and the track re-opened in April 2011. The track was also renamed to &quot;Memphis International Raceway,&quot; and a new logo was created to reflected the change which adopted a similar theme with its sister track in Palm Beach. The track became sanctioned with IHRA, which has held the IHRA Nitro Jam finale at Memphis since 2011.

===2013===

In 2013, MIR gained more events for the park, including the 2nd annual Ford Fun Weekend at Memphis (was hosted at MIR in 2012 as well), and the Mega Mopar Action Series. This was the first year where the three major domestic manufacturers (Chevy, Ford, and Dodge) held an event at Memphis in the same year under the new owners. The track also drew attention to the Mid South Region of NASA, which uses the road course for track events featuring High Performance Driving Events (HPDEs), Time Trial, Wheel to Wheel Racing, and NASA-X autocross events. Retired NASCAR driver, Rusty Wallace opened up his driving experience and go kart facility on the NASCAR Oval in May 2013. MIR also picked up the Xtreme Xperience Supercar venue which allows anyone to drive vehicles such as Ferrari&#x27;s, Lamborghini&#x27;s, and Audi&#x27;s around the track for a fee. Its first event was February 9 and 10, but the event was prematurely canceled on the 10th due to weather. A make-up event was rescheduled for a Sunday run on October 20, 2013. The ARCA series also made a return to the oval, making it the first racing event held on the oval since the new ownership in 2011. The Memphis 250 was held on October 26 with Brian Campbell being the race winner.

===2022===
The track was sold sometime around March 2022, and held its last event on June 17, 2022, as of February 2025 the track (including the drag strip and paved oval) currently sits abandoned.

===Drag strip===
The drag strip immediately drew the attention of the NHRA and was awarded a sanction in 1988 as the host site of the Mid-South Nationals. While the NHRA has 140 member tracks, Memphis was one of only 23 to host a national event. It also was the section of the complex used by other events such as the Mid-South SCCA events and the Super Chevy Show. The last NHRA race at Memphis, &quot;O’Reilly NHRA Mid-South Nationals&quot;, was to be hosted on October 4, 2009, but a rain delay postponed the event to October 5, 2009. In the winner&#x27;s circle were Jeff Arend (Funny Car), Morgan Lucas (Top Fuel), Jason Line (Pro Stock) and Michael Phillips (Pro Stock Motorcycle).

The strip will host IHRA events with its new owner, including a Nitro Jam event, as their sister track in Palm Beach is also affiliated with IHRA. The &quot;American Drag Racing League&quot; announced, on March 3, 2011, that they would hold an event during the weekend of May 20, 2011, at MIR. The IHRA Nitro Jam series continues to race at Memphis, and have set up another finale event for 2014.

===Paved oval===

On September 13, 1998, before a sold-out crowd and a national television audience, the facility hosted its first NASCAR event—the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Memphis 200. NASCAR returned every year since with two events—the Truck Series in the summer, and the Nationwide Series in the fall. Ron Hornaday took home his second consecutive Elvis trophy in the last MemphisTravel.com 200 Camping World Truck Series race held at the oval. A late caution forced a green-white-checkered finish which gave Hornaday the edge on the restart to beat Brian Scott. On October 24, 2009, Brad Keselowski won the race at the oval by holding off Kyle Busch to the finish line on the 11th and final annual racing event, for both the Nationwide Series and the oval, as the track would not carry any racing events in 2010, when Dover Motorsports, Inc. announced the closure of Memphis Motorsports Park, a week after that race.

<doc id="685545" wikidata="Q275041" url="?curid=685545" title="Holly Cole">
<text>Holly Cole (born November 25, 1963) is a Canadian jazz singer and actress. For many years she performed with her group The Holly Cole Trio.

==Background==
Cole was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Her father, Leon Cole, was a noted radio broadcaster for the CBC Stereo network.

==Holly Cole Trio==
In 1983, Cole travelled to Toronto to seek a musical career. In 1986, she founded a trio with bassist David Piltch and pianist Aaron Davis. Offered a record deal in 1989, the Holly Cole Trio released an EP, &quot;Christmas Blues&quot;, that year, which featured a version of The Pretenders&#x27; &quot;2,000 Miles,&quot; which has proven to be very popular. This was followed by their first full album, &quot;Girl Talk&quot;, in 1990.

A succession of releases followed through the early 1990s. For example, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Blame It On My Youth&quot;, covered songs by Tom Waits (&quot;Purple Avenue,&quot; aka &quot;Empty Pockets&quot;) and Lyle Lovett (&quot;God Will&quot;), includes show tunes such as &quot;If I Were a Bell&quot; (from &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;) and &quot;On the Street Where You Live&quot; (from &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;), and remakes &quot;Trust In Me,&quot; from Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, into a strikingly sultry and sinister song of seduction and death. Also recorded in this period was a reinterpretation of Elvis Costello&#x27;s &quot;Alison.&quot;

In 1993, the trio released &quot;Don&#x27;t Smoke in Bed&quot;, an album produced by David Was, which included a hit single cover version of &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot;. According to Jeff Bateman and James Hale, &quot;The video for the song was put into heavy rotation on MuchMusic and earned a Juno Award nomination for Best Video. The album went platinum in Canada, reached No. 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Contemporary Jazz chart, and won a Juno Award for Best Contemporary Jazz Album, in 1994.&quot;

During this time she also had an acting role in Laurie Lynd&#x27;s Genie Award-winning short film &quot;The Fairy Who Didn&#x27;t Want to Be a Fairy Anymore&quot;.

On November 10, 1994, the Holly Cole Trio performed in a first-season episode of &quot;Due South&quot; (&quot;Chicago Holiday, Part 1&quot;) with Cole singing the Aaron Davis composition &quot;Neon Blue&quot; in a dinner club for several minutes during the opening credits. The song was later released on the &quot;Due South: The Original Television Soundtrack (1996)&quot; CD, and later by Holly Cole only on the Japanese compilation album &quot;Yesterday &amp; Today&quot; (1994). The Holly Cole Trio followed this appearance with another in the following &quot;Due South&quot; episode (of November 17) where she sings &quot;Smile&quot; from &quot;Blame It On My Youth&quot; during the ball scene at the end of the episode.

==Solo career==
Following &quot;Don&#x27;t Smoke In Bed&quot;, the trio released a CD entirely of songs by Tom Waits, called &quot;Temptation&quot;. This 1995 release also dropped the &quot;Trio&quot; from the label.

Cole followed with two albums, &quot;Dark Dear Heart&quot; (1997) and &quot;Romantically Helpless&quot; (2000), which veered further from jazz by introducing pop elements to Cole&#x27;s sound.

In 2001, she returned to the Christmas jazz roots of her first CD with &quot;Baby It&#x27;s Cold Outside&quot;, which included &quot;Christmas Time is Here&quot; (from &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;), &quot;Santa Baby&quot;, and the title track. Swapping cold for hot, she moved to a summer theme in 2003&#x27;s &quot;Shade&quot;, this time reinterpreting Cole Porter (&quot;Too Darn Hot&quot;), Irving Berlin (&quot;Heatwave&quot;), and The Beach Boys&#x27; Brian Wilson (&quot;God Only Knows&quot;). The album was named Jazz Recording of the Year at the 2004 Juno Awards.

In 2002 Cole was the featured vocalist on an album of compositions by the English Composer Gavin Bryars, titled &quot;I Have Heard It Said That a Spirit Enters,&quot; singing on the title piece, as well as on &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;The Apple&quot;.

Cole&#x27;s album &quot;Holly Cole&quot; (originally entitled &quot;This House Is Haunted&quot;) was released in Canada in March 2007. It was released in the US in January 2008 and was followed by a US tour.

Cole tours frequently, particularly around the holiday season, in Canada. She was also a part of the 1998 Lilith Fair tour, and her song &quot;Onion Girl&quot; was included on that year&#x27;s live compilation album.

In 2010, Cole contributed a track for the World Jazz For Haiti charity album, recorded at Number 9 Audio Group in support of the Red Cross disaster relief fund. The album featured Canadian artists such as John McDermott, David Clayton-Thomas and George Koller.

Cole&#x27;s first live DVD + CD titled &quot;Steal The Night: Live at the Glenn Gould Studio&quot; was released in Canada in February 2012. It was recorded live at Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto on August 11, 2011. The performance marks the reformation of the original Holly Cole Trio lineup with Aaron Davis on piano and bassist David Piltch, in addition to John Johnson (horns), Rob Piltch (guitars) and Davide DiRenzo (drums).

Cole&#x27;s first studio album in five years, &quot;Night&quot; was released in late 2012 on Universal Music Canada. The album, produced by Cole and Greg Cohen, covers songs from Tom Waits (&quot;Walk Away&quot;), Gordon Lightfoot (&quot;If You Could Read My Mind&quot;), Mort Shuman (&quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot;), Captain Beefheart (&quot;Love Lies&quot;), a James Bond Theme by John Barry (&quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;), and a Cole original (&quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot;).
Cole toured in support of Night in 2012–13 to Canada, America, Germany and Japan.

In 2014, Cole received an honorary degree from Queen&#x27;s University in Kingston, Ontario on June 2014.

In February 2018, she released a new studio album titled &quot;Holly&quot;. In 2019, Holly Cole reunited the original Holly Cole Trio, with David Pitch on bass and Aaron Davis on piano, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Festival International de Jazz de Montreal. They performed at the cabaret Lion d&#x27;Or in Montreal, and these special shows were recorded and became the 2021 album ‘Montreal’. For Christmas 2022, Cole released a remastered compilation combining her holiday releases from 1989 and 2001, titled anew ‘Baby It’s Cold Outside and I Have the Christmas Blues’. 

For her 13th studio album ‘Dark Moon’ released January 24th, 2025, when asked about the recording process Cole said “I really wanted this album to embrace the spirit of spontaneity. And at the same time a quintessential part of the sound of my music is in the arrangements. So, we did very little rehearsal in advance, and the songs were incredibly fresh for us while we were in the studio. The musicians that I play with contribute greatly to the arranging of the songs, and I wanted to hear the sound of when the light goes on for each one of us and many of the arrangements fell together as we played them. What we end up hearing on this record is the moment when we discover what we love about the song, and what its essence is for me.” 

Holly Cole isn’t one of those artists who falls into any one category. Her smoky voice is sultry, her arrangements smart and sexy and all the while she and her musicians very uniquely reshape traditional Jazz, Pop and Country standards, this time particularly from the New American Songbook writers including Marty Balin, Peggy Lee, Hal David, Burt Bacharach and Johnny Mercer.

&quot;I have always been a lover of the night going way back to when I was a young child growing up in Halifax. One of my very earliest memories is of waking up in the middle of the night with croup. I was feverish, with a sore throat and a bad cough. My mother crushed a grown-up aspirin into canned peaches that I ate, and then my father bundled me up and put me on his shoulders and we walked around the neighbourhood in the middle of the night. What I was about to behold I would never forget. My neighbourhood had been transformed into a captivating, mystical, deserted land that was lit only by the beguiling moon. The same moon which was completely invisible during the day. This was a mystery. All I could hear were my father&#x27;s footsteps because there were no other people around at all. And I could feel the cool, moist Nova Scotia sea air soothe my sore throat and rid me of my cough while I gazed from my father’s shoulders at what was my neighbourhood, but at night in the moonlight it looked like magic to me. And when we got home I felt that I had the most incredible secret. Ever since the moon has compelled me and affects my creative process. 
The song Dark Moon appealed to me for a variety of reasons. I was struck by the charm of the lyrics which lend themselves to a minimal approach and a slower tempo so that there is time to let the meaning resonate. It is also interesting to me how the role of the moon is reversed. Typically, in songs the moon is influencing the lovers. In this case, the lovers are influencing the mood of the moon - or at least they suspect that they are. The simple structure of the song left it wide open to arranging ideas like extending the form and adding a variety of harmonies. Of course, The Good Lovelies were a natural fit.&quot; Holly on the title track of this album ‘Dark Moon’

==Television music specials==
Cole was a featured artist in the one-hour special &quot;Standards&quot; produced by Jeremy Podeswa and Ingrid Veninger and directed by Podeswa. It premiered on Sunday Arts Entertainment on CBC Television in 1992. The special, which was inspired by David Ramsden’s &quot;Quiet Please! There’s a Lady on Stage&quot; also featured Jane Siberry, Cherie Camp, Laura Hubert, Molly Johnson, Sarah McLachlan, Maggie Moore, and David Ramsden. Cole sang George and Ira Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;The Man I Love&quot; with altered lyrics.

Cole, Aaron Davis and David Piltch were featured in a one-hour music special entitled &quot;Holly Cole Trio – My Foolish Heart.&quot; It was directed by Michael McNamara and produced by Bruce Glawson and Arnie Zipursky of Cambium Productions. The special premiered on Global Television Network on January 5, 1993 and featured a concert taped at Brampton’s Heritage Theatre. The special won the Silver Hugo award at the Chicago International Film Festival, and the Gold Special Jury Award in TV &amp; Cable Production in Performance Arts at the Worldfest-Houston International Film &amp; Festival in 1993. The following year, it won two Gemini awards – Best Music Program or Series and Cole was honoured for Best Performance in a Music or Performing Arts Program.

On August 31, 1993, Cole was featured in &quot;Intimate and Interactive With Holly Cole&quot; on MuchMusic. The Holly Cole Trio won Best Performance in a Performing Arts Program/Series at the 9th Annual Gemini Industry Awards in March 1995.

Cole, along with Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, Ed Robertson, Serena Ryder, and Hawksley Workman performed in &quot;Christmas at the Concert Hall&quot;, a special hosted by Erica Ehm. It was telecast on Bravo (Canada) on December 9, 2008.

<text>Colwyn was a local government district with borough status from 1974 to 1996, being one of six districts in the county of Clwyd, north-east Wales.

==History==
The borough was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972. It covered parts of four former districts from the administrative county of Denbighshire, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Abergele Urban District
*Aled Rural District, except the parish of Llansantffraid Glan Conway, which went to Aberconwy
*Colwyn Bay Municipal Borough
*Hiraethog Rural District, except the parishes of Eglwysbach, Llanddoget, Llanrwst Rural, and Tir Ifan, which went to Aberconwy

The new borough was named Colwyn, taken from the name of the area&#x27;s largest town, Colwyn Bay.

Under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994, Clwyd County Council and the county&#x27;s constituent districts were abolished, being replaced by principal areas, whose councils perform the functions which had previously been divided between the county and district councils. With effect from 1 April 1996, the two communities of Cefnmeiriadog and Trefnant were transferred from Colwyn to the new county of Denbighshire, and the remainder of Colwyn was merged with the neighbouring district of Aberconwy from Gwynedd to become a county borough which the government originally named &quot;Aberconwy and Colwyn&quot;. During the transition to the new system, the shadow authority requested a change of name from &quot;Aberconwy and Colwyn&quot; to &quot;Conwy&quot;. The government confirmed the change with effect from 2 April 1996, one day after the new council came into being.

The borough of Colwyn was twinned with Konstanz, Germany and Roissy-en-Brie, France.

The name Colwyn is currently used for an electoral ward covering the eastern part of the community of Old Colwyn. The ward had a population of 4,566 at the 2011 census.

==Political control==
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until it came into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council from 1974 until its abolition in 1996 was as follows:
==Premises==
The council was based at the Civic Centre on Abergele Road in Colwyn Bay. The building had been built in 1909 as a hospital called Glan y Don Hall, but had been converted to a civic centre in 1964 for one of Colwyn&#x27;s predecessor authorities, the Colwyn Bay Borough Council. Following the abolition of Colwyn in 1996 the building served as the headquarters of the successor Conwy County Borough Council until 2018.

<doc id="685562" wikidata="Q5034933" url="?curid=685562" title="Cape May Lighthouse">
<text>The Cape May Lighthouse is a lighthouse located in the U.S. state of New Jersey at the tip of Cape May, in Lower Township&#x27;s Cape May Point State Park. It was built in 1859 under the supervision of U.S. Army engineer William F. Raynolds, was automated in 1946, and continues operation to this day. 

Cape May Lighthouse is the third fully documented lighthouse to be built at Cape May Point. The first was built in 1823 and the second in 1847. The exact locations of the first two lighthouses are now underwater due to erosion. There are 199 steps to the top of the Lighthouse. The view from the top extends to Cape May City and Wildwood to the north, Cape May Point to the south, and, on a clear day, Cape Henlopen, Delaware, to the west. Within immediate view are Cape May Cove and Battery 223, a harbor defense battery originally built during World War II. Cape May Lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1973.

The Cape May Light is located in Lower Township, but is also a point of identity for Cape May Point as it uses the lighthouse as a logo for municipal-owned vehicles. Mayors of the two municipalities previously had a conflict over in which municipality it was located.

==Operation==
The lighthouse is owned by the state of New Jersey after ownership was transferred from the Coast Guard in 1992, which maintains it as an active aid to maritime navigation. The State of New Jersey leases the structure and grounds to the Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts &amp; Humanities (MAC). MAC raises funds for the restoration and upkeep of the structure and opens the lighthouse to the public for climbs to the top. MAC has installed interpretive exhibits about the lighthouse&#x27;s history, the lives of the former lighthouse keepers, and other maritime history of the Jersey Cape for visitors who climb. In 2013, MAC celebrated the 25th anniversary of the opening of the lighthouse to the public for climbs. From its opening in May 1988, over 2.1 million people have paid to climb to the top. Every October, the Cape May Lighthouse is a participant in the New Jersey Lighthouse Challenge, a statewide event.

==Design==
The tower is tall, from the ground to the tower&#x27;s cast iron spiral staircase. There are 217 steps from the ground to the top, with 199 steps in the tower&#x27;s cast iron spiral staircase. The lighthouse has two separate walls. The outside wall is cone-shaped, and is thick at the bottom, and thick at the top. The inside wall is a cylinder with walls which support the spiral staircase. The walls were designed to withstand winds several times above hurricane force. The original revolving lens was manufactured by Henry Lepaute in Paris and has a inside diameter. This first-order Fresnel lens was moved to the Cape May County Courthouse.

<doc id="685564" wikidata="Q1660757" url="?curid=685564" title="Kentucky Speedway">
<text>Kentucky Speedway is an inactive tri-oval intermediate speedway in Sparta, Kentucky. It has hosted various major races throughout its existence, including NASCAR and IndyCar races. The track is owned by Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI) and is currently used as a storage and parking lot for various companies. The speedway has a grandstand capacity of 66,000 as of 2020.

In the 1990s, then-Turfway Park owner Jerry Carroll sought to seek new profitable ventures after Turfway Park&#x27;s decline, deciding to build a modern auto racing facility. Construction started in July 1998 and opened nearly two years later, with an ultimate goal of securing a NASCAR Cup Series race weekend in the near future. However, under Carroll&#x27;s tenure, a Cup Series date was not given. After a change in ownership to Bruton Smith in 2008, the track gained a Cup Series date in 2011. However, after an inaugural Cup Series weekend plagued by traffic issues and lackluster revenue throughout the following decade, the facility was dropped from the NASCAR schedule starting in 2021, and has since been turned into a multi-use rental complex.

==Description==
===Configuration===
The speedway in its current form is measured at , with 17 degrees of banking in the first two turns, 14 degrees in the last two turns, 10 degrees on the track&#x27;s frontstretch, and four degrees on the track&#x27;s backstretch. Varying sanctioning bodies have disputed the length of the track; NASCAR&#x27;s official measurement is at 1.5 miles, while IndyCar used a length of .

===Amenities===
Kentucky Speedway is located at an intersection between Interstate 71 and Kentucky Route 35. As of 2019, the facility has a grandstand capacity of 66,000 according to the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot;, down from its peak of 106,000 in the 2010s. In total, the facility covers approximately of land.

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===
In April 1997, the owner of horse racing facility Turfway Park, Jerry Carroll, oversaw decreasing attendance and betting at Turfway Park. Concerned about the future of Turfway Park, Carroll sought new profitable ventures. After visiting a race at the newly built Texas Motor Speedway, he decided to launch a study to determine on whether building a NASCAR-style superspeedway in Northern Kentucky was feasible. According to &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot;, the study was slated to last 3−4 months. A press conference was later called on January 8, 1998. In the press conference, Carroll announced his intents to build a 1,000-acre, 60,000-seat, track in Gallatin County, Kentucky, at the cost of $132 million. The project was supported by Carroll and four other business partners. Plans were made to open the facility in the fall of 1999 and for it to start hosting events by 2000, with hopes that the facility could eventually expand to 180,000 seats. The track was announced in the midst of a surge in popularity of stock car racing, with many modern, newly built track proposals aiming to gain a coveted NASCAR Cup Series race weekend being made. Carroll stated his hopes that NASCAR would award the facility a Cup Series date by 2003, beginning the process by moving a NASCAR Truck Series date from the Louisville Motor Speedway, a track Carroll had bought.

By February 1998, Carroll announced that a &quot;best-case scenario&quot; for groundbreaking was August 1 of that year. Although Carroll had announced his hopes of hosting Indy Racing League (IRL), Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART), and second-tier NASCAR Busch Series events in the near future, IRL president Tony George stated that the IRL was not looking to host any races at the facility. In contrast, Carroll stated that he thought NASCAR and its president Bill France Jr. had been &quot;very loyal&quot;; he later decided to move the groundbreaking date earlier to July 1. A final date for groundbreaking was set for July 18, with groundbreaking ceremonies occurring at Turfway Park for &quot;convenience of the public&quot;; actual work was scheduled to begin on the facility on August 1. By the time groundbreaking occurred, the budget for the project rose to $152 million, with the track being formally named Kentucky Speedway. Within the first month, track officials had been selling permanent personal seating licenses, with around 1,500 being sold by November. By the end of the year, the demand of luxury suites had risen to a point where the original 23 suites planned to be built had risen to &quot;at least 50&quot;. Under the advice of track advisor and Kentucky native Darrell Waltrip, the track&#x27;s banking was changed to have 14 degrees of banking in the turns and 12 degrees of banking on the track&#x27;s straightaways. In February 1999, the track was formally annexed into the town of Sparta, Kentucky. That same month, Carroll sold his ownership of Turfway Park, stating that the decline of the facility had left him &quot;frustrated and somewhat burned out&quot;, wanting to focus on Kentucky Speedway&#x27;s construction. In the following months, Cintas, the Ford Motor Company, and Budweiser agreed to become corporate sponsors for the track.

In June, the track announced its first scheduled races, with an Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) race scheduled for sometime in June 2000. By July, an IRL date was rumored to be &quot;highly probable&quot; according to the &quot;Courier Journal&quot;; the decision was confirmed two months later, with a race being scheduled in August 2000. In October, the first testing runs were made by ARCA driver Bill Baird, who stated that the track was &quot;as smooth as a baby’s bottom.&quot; On November 4, a third-tier NASCAR Truck Series was announced for June 17, 2000; the initial seating capacity was also increased to 70,000 fans. The Truck Series event was later accompanied by a NASCAR Slim Jim All Pro Series event to christen the track the day before the Truck Series race. Further tests by Greg Ray in an IndyCar were also made in November. That same month, Mark Cassis was appointed as the general manager of the track. By the start of 2000, Kentucky Speedway officials stated that 70% of the track was complete. Further news of potential NASCAR races were made in February; although the chances of a Cup race were &quot;not very good&quot; according to NASCAR CEO Mike Helton, the facility was considered ready for a second-tier Busch Series race. In May, after a Truck Series test session, track developers opted to repave the track after complaints were made; it was completed by the end of the month. By the start of the track&#x27;s inaugural race weekend, the facility held a grandstand capacity of 65,989, around 23,000 parking spots, 104 infield garage spots, and two Outback Steakhouse restaurants, receiving praise from numerous NASCAR officials and drivers.

=== Early years ===

Kentucky Speedway opened as scheduled on June 16, 2000, with Billy Bigley winning the first ever event at the facility in front of a crowd of 36,210. A near sell-out crowd for the Truck Series race despite the race being delayed a day by heavy rain occurred on the 17th and 18th, with Greg Biffle winning. However, the rain caused several dirt parking lots to be closed due to their condition, leading some spectators to be turned away. The closing sparked a traffic jam as long as on Interstate 71 according to &quot;The Cincinnati Post&quot;. To remedy the problem, track officials put down approximately 50,000 tons of gravel in the facility&#x27;s parking lots and added an emergency parking lot that held 10,000 cars. In August, after openings were made in the NASCAR Busch Series schedule, Kentucky Speedway was awarded an annual Busch Series race starting in 2001, with Kevin Harvick winning the track&#x27;s first Busch race on June 16, 2001. The facility saw its first major injury the next year when actor and aspiring IndyCar driver Jason Priestley crashed during a test session at approximately , severely injuring him. Speedway officials first applied for a Cup Series race for the 2002 season; however, NASCAR rejected because they felt that including the facility &quot;would not further its expansion goals.&quot; Despite plans to host the Cup Series by 2003, no races were also announced in 2003 and 2004.

==== Antitrust lawsuit against NASCAR and ISC ====
By June 2005, Carroll, growing frustrated at the track&#x27;s lack of a Cup Series race, stating that he would seek out more aggressive tactics to gain one, including the possibility of an antitrust lawsuit. On July 13, a lawsuit was officially filed against NASCAR and the International Speedway Corporation (ISC), with the speedway seeking out &quot;more than $400 million in damages&quot; and a Cup Series race. After proceedings began in December, NASCAR and ISC argued for the case to be heard in Florida, where both companies were headquartered, instead of Kentucky; the proposal was dismissed by United States district judge William Bertelsman, eventually ordering a one-year period of discovery for both parties set to end on February 1, 2007. Seen as a risky endeavor due to the possibility of the removal of its Busch Series date, by 2006, with the exception of its Busch Series race, all major series races at the track oversaw steep attendance declines. In April 2007, Kentucky Speedway amended their lawsuit, no longer demanding a Cup Series race; instead, they called for the France family, owner of both NASCAR and ISC, to give up ownership of one of either of the two companies. Kentucky Speedway officials also stated that NASCAR and ISC had pressured numerous owners of other tracks to sell to them only; a claim NASCAR denied. After a failed mediation in June, NASCAR asked Bertelsman to throw out the lawsuit on the basis that the &quot;Kentucky Speedway has not come close to showing evidence supporting its allegations of a conspiracy to limit its ability to obtain an elite Nextel Cup Series race&quot; in September; the request was accepted by Bertelsman on January 7, 2008. Kentucky Speedway&#x27;s lawyer Stan Chesley proceeded to file an appeal four days later.

=== Bruton Smith&#x27;s purchase, Mark Simendinger era ===

On May 22, 2008, &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; reported that a press conference had been scheduled with Speedway Motorsports&#x27; (SMI) Bruton Smith regarding a potential partnership with the track or its selling. The purchase of the facility was confirmed by Smith that day for $78.3 million, with SMI buying the track for $15 million and assuming the rest in debt. With Smith purchasing the track, he aimed to add approximately 50,000 seats, additional bathrooms, increased parking space, and a renovated garage area upon confirmation of a Cup Series date. Smith later stated that he hoped that he could negotiate a Cup Series race for the facility in 2009; NASCAR later dispelled the comment, with a NASCAR spokesman stating that &quot;we don&#x27;t see any possibility of there being a Sprint Cup Series race in Kentucky in 2009.&quot; Although Smith sought to end the appeal, Carroll refused to budge, stating that &quot;We are very, very adamant to the fact that we think we have a good lawsuit... What matters is the even playing field.&quot; The purchase was officially finalized on December 31; soon after, general manager Mark Cassis resigned from his position as the track&#x27;s general manager. In February, SMI sought to acquire a tax break covering portions of renovation costs was proposed in February in the Kentucky General Assembly; it was approved by Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear four months later. By April, Mark Simendinger replaced Cassis as the general manager of the facility. That same month, the first phase of a planned $75 million in renovations begun in April, focusing on new access roads and increased camping spots.

Aggressive, renewed calls for all original investors of the facility to end the appeal by Smith came in May. In response to Smith&#x27;s calls, Richard Duchossois, one of the original investors, stated that all five investors were agreed in continuing the appeal process, adding that he thought that Smith&#x27;s plea to end the appeal was &quot;NASCAR&#x27;s way of trying a force a settlement.&quot; Smith later claimed that as long as the lawsuit occurred, NASCAR would not consider giving the facility a Cup Series date. By June, Smith conceded most hopes of hosting a Cup Series race in 2010, instead hoping to obtain one in 2011. Arguments for the appeal started in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in July 30; on December 11, the court upheld Bertelsman&#x27;s ruling in favor of NASCAR. A week later, Carroll officially dropped his lawsuit against NASCAR and ISC, allowing the facility to begin the eligibility process to obtain a Cup Series date. However, 11 days after, Duchossois sued Carroll, claiming that the appeal could not be dropped until at least 75% of the track&#x27;s ownership agreed to it. The Sixth Circuit Appeals Court denied Duchossois&#x27; request for a rehearing in February, and although a trial date was scheduled for May 7, the two came to a settlement by April 30, formally ending the six-year lawsuit.

After showing some initial doubt, Smith submitted an official bid for a Cup Series date for 2011 in the beginning of July. A &quot;major&quot; press conference was announced later that month to take place on August 10; &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; reported that the press conference was to announce a new Cup Series date at the facility. On August 10, a Cup Series date was officially confirmed, with Smith planning to invest $90–100 million towards 50,000 additional seats, additional bathrooms and elevators, and the rezoning for 200 more acres of camping. By November, new spectator towers, the Kentucky and Ohio towers that contained 19,000 seats each, were being built to increase grandstand capacity to 106,000. In the months heading into the Cup Series race, Smith stated concerns of potential traffic issues, stating in the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot;, &quot;Getting the people in here and out is going to be a tall order for us... It’s going to take a lot of hard work and planning to get that done.&quot; He later added that Interstate 71 was &quot;the worst interstate highway that I have ever driven on in my life... That highway should have been rebuilt five years ago because it&#x27;s so antiquated and falling apart.&quot; By the start of the race weekend, approximately $70 million of renovations were made, including the move of the track&#x27;s pit road 200 feet closer to the frontstretch and the addition of 3,000 campsite spots.

==== First NASCAR Cup Series race, subsequent traffic nightmare ====
On July 9, 2011, the first ever NASCAR Cup Series race ran at the facility, with Kyle Busch winning the event. Like the track&#x27;s first ever race, the race was mired by heavy traffic jams. Reports of &quot;total gridlock&quot; stack-ups leaving fans waiting for six hours were reported, with traffic being reported in cities as far as Carrollton. By 9:30 PM EST, fans were being turned away; according to Bruton Smith, by the end of the race, approximately 20,000 fans were turned away from entering. Different reasons were given on the cause of the traffic jam; Smith again blamed Interstate 71 and its lack of lanes, while Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear blamed a shortage of parking spaces; at the time, the facility had 33,000 parking spaces. To alleviate the problem, SMI announced to spend $11 million worth of renovations, including the purchase of of land and the construction of a new pedestrian walkway. An exit ramp of Interstate 71 and parts of Kentucky Route 35 were also widened. The renovations proved to be a success; according to multiple outlets, no major traffic jams were reported.

==== Following years, repave ====
By 2014, the track&#x27;s surface gained a reputation for a rough and bumpy surface. Although the surface received positive reactions along with pleas from several NASCAR drivers to not repave the track, track officials opted to grind down a patch of track in the track&#x27;s fourth turn after complaints of a dip that was &quot;beyond the level of tolerance&quot;. Attendance also saw a major decrease over a three-year period, fueling speculation of the move of the facility&#x27;s Cup Series date to another SMI-owned track. That same year, the track oversaw its first automobile-related fatality when Stephen Cox crashed his car during a Rusty Wallace Racing Experience session. Despite plans to not repave the surface in 2015, problems arose when water leaked from the track surface during a rain delay in July. In response, officials announced in January 2016 a repave and modifications to the track&#x27;s first two turns; they were changed to have 17 degrees of banking from 14 degrees and were narrowed from 74 feet to 56 feet. The repave drew mixed reactions, with Simendinger opting to add an additional asphalt layer to the track&#x27;s surface because it &quot;did not meet specifications&quot;. Within the next three years, the facility decreased grandstand capacity twice; one in 2017 that removed 20,000 seats to decrease capacity to 86,000, and one in 2019 that decreased capacity to 69,000. By 2020, according to Mark Story of the &quot;Lexington Herald-Leader&quot;, capacity was down to &quot;some 66,000&quot;.

=== Stoppage of racing, transition to storage and parking lot ===
On September 29, 2020, NASCAR officially confirmed to &quot;The Athletic&quot; that the organization would not return to Kentucky Speedway for their 2021 season in any capacity. In a &quot;Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; analysis piece by Jason Hoffman, the decision was due to the track &quot;succumb[ing] to its inability to bring in enough revenue for its parent company.&quot; In response to the news, Simendinger stated that the facility would &quot;evolve into a multi-use rental complex... we have the potential to host special events, commercial television production, music festivals, other racing series and stand-alone RV rallies and camping events.&quot; In December of that year, Simendinger resigned from his position, leaving SMI. In May 2021, amidst a global semiconductor shortage, the track was used by the Ford Motor Company to store thousands of pickup trucks waiting for computer chips. Later deals with Amazon were made within the year. By 2022, the only event held at the speedway was an EDM music festival. By 2024, although calls were made to return to the track by numerous personalities, such as NASCAR driver Denny Hamlin and Gallatin County judge Ryan Morris, the track was viewed as dilapidated, needing major renovations and government subsidies, with the state of Kentucky not willing to contribute. &quot;Kentucky Lantern&quot; writer Tim Sullivan stated that &quot;the state appears conspicuously short of the political will and financial muscle necessary to underwrite that undertaking... Kentucky lags so far behind that it risks being lapped.&quot;

== Events ==

=== Racing ===

==== NASCAR ====
The facility hosted one NASCAR weekend annually, featuring the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series&#x27; Buckle Up in Your Truck 225 since 2000 and the NASCAR Xfinity Series&#x27; Alsco 300 since 2001. From 2012 to 2017, it also hosted a second Xfinity Series race, the VisitMyrtleBeach.com 300, which was removed in 2018 in favor of a race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway but returned as a one-off event in 2020.

In 2011, the track began hosting the NASCAR Cup Series with the Quaker State 400, held annually in late June or July, starting with its inaugural race on July 9, 2011. However, since 2021, all three top NASCAR series have ceased racing at the facility.

==== IndyCar Series ====
From 2000 to 2011, IndyCar held the Kentucky Indy 300, an annual IndyCar Series event. The first iteration was held on August 27, 2000, with Buddy Lazier winning the event. The event ran continuously until 2011, when IndyCar announced in December of that year that the series would not be returning to the track in 2012.

=== Music festivals ===
Kentucky Speedway has held numerous music festivals. In July 2000, the facility held its first concert as part of Metallica&#x27;s Summer Sanitarium Tour, with approximately 50,000 fans attending. A year later, the facility held a stop of the traveling Warped Tour. From 2003 to 2004, the Meijer Country Stampede was held at the track. In May 2015, a festival headlined by Kings of Leon, Miranda Lambert, and Green Day was announced for August of that year; however, a month before the festival, organizers cancelled it due to a lack of ticket sales. In August 2022, the facility hosted the Interstellar Music Festival, an EDM music festival.

<text>The Blaarkop or Groninger Blaarkop is a Dutch breed of dual-purpose cattle. 
&quot;Blaarkop&quot; is Dutch for &quot;blister head&quot;. Its main breeding area is in the province of Groningen. 

== History ==

White-headed cattle in Holland have been mentioned as early as the fourteenth century. Cattle showing some similarity to the modern Blaarkop appear in an &quot;Adoration&quot; by Pieter Aertsen dating from about 1560, and in a seventeenth-century &quot;Head of a Bellowing Ox&quot; by Jan Asselijn. From the nineteenth century, there are also &quot;Blaarkoppen&quot; in the Utrecht and Leiden regions.

Bulls of this type were among the cattle shipped to the Cape of Good Hope by Willem Adriaan van der Stel during his time as governor of the Cape Colony (1699–1707).

, a non-profit foundation for the development and conservation of the Blairkop, was established in 2002.

== Characteristics ==

The Blaarkop breed is sturdily built with matching muscles, a horned head, and strong legs. Both red (60% of the population) and black (40%) Blaarkoppen exist. The body is solid red or black, while the head is white with a red or black ring (&quot;blister&quot;) around the eyes; the tail has a white tip.

Bulls are high and weigh . Cows are high and weigh . 

== Use ==

The average milk yield is in a lactation of 315 days, with fat and protein; many cows give more than , and yields above can occur.

<text>The Royal Hawaiian Hotel is a beachfront luxury hotel located in Waikiki in Honolulu, Hawaii, on the island of Oahu. It is part of The Luxury Collection brand of Marriott International. One of the first hotels established in Waikiki, the Royal Hawaiian is considered one of the most luxurious and famous hotels in Hawaiian tourism and has hosted numerous celebrities and world dignitaries. The bright pink hue of its concrete stucco façade with its Spanish/Moorish styled architecture and prominent location on the wide sandy beach have earned it the alliterative nickname of &quot;The Pink Palace of the Pacific&quot;.

==History==
With the success of the early efforts by Matson Navigation Company to provide steamer travel to America&#x27;s wealthiest families en route to Hawaii, a series of resort hotels were built in Honolulu at the start of the twentieth century, including the Moana Hotel (1901) and Honolulu Seaside Hotel, both on Waikiki Beach, and the Alexander Young Hotel in downtown Honolulu (1903). By the 1920s, they were all owned by the Territorial Hotel Company.

In 1925, with tourism to Hawaii growing rapidly, the Matson Line partnered with Castle &amp; Cooke, one of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. They formulated a &quot;grand scheme&quot; to make the islands a luxury destination. They would construct the fastest, safest, most expensive ocean liner ever built for the Hawaiian service (the SS &quot;Malolo&quot;); a luxury beach resort hotel to serve the liner&#x27;s passengers; and an exclusive golf club for the hotel&#x27;s guests (the Waialae Country Club).

Because Matson and Castle &amp; Cooke had never operated hotels, they bought the Territorial Hotel Company, to run the new hotel, and then demolished the company&#x27;s Honololu Seaside Hotel. On its site, they contracted the acclaimed New York firm of Warren and Wetmore to design the Royal Hawaiian Hotel. The sprawling pink stucco concrete façade Spanish/Moorish styled complex, built at a cost of over $4 million (1927 prices), was surrounded by a 15-acre (6.1 ha) landscaped garden. The H-shaped layout featured 400 rooms, each with bath and balcony.

The Royal Hawaiian opened on February 1, 1927, with a black tie gala attended by over 1,200 guests, and quickly became an icon of Hawaii&#x27;s glory days. The First Pan Pacific Conference on Education, Rehabilitation, Reclamation and Recreation convened in April with its headquarters at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel; it was the first time that Hawaii held a conference of this size.

The hotel was a huge success, and in 1928 the islands counted over 20,000 visitors for the first time. The Great Depression struck in 1929, cratering tourism. In 1933, the Territorial Hotel Company was dissolved, with Matson assuming control of their hotels through its Hawaii Properties Ltd. division, and Castle &amp; Cooke writing off their investment. In 1941, Hawaii Properties Ltd. was dissolved and Matson assumed direct control of the hotel.

During World War II, the Royal Hawaiian was used exclusively by the U.S. military as an R&amp;R center. Barriers of concertina wire blockaded access from the adjacent beaches.

The hotel recouped much of its clientele after 1945. It was sold, along with the rest of Matson&#x27;s hotels in Hawaii, to Sheraton Hotels in 1959.

During the 1960s, the &quot;Pink Palace&quot; was home to &quot;Concert by the Sea&quot; which broadcast daily through the Armed Forces Radio Network (AFN).

In September 1974, Japanese businessmen-brothers Kenji Osano and Masakuni Osano purchased the Royal Hawaiian Hotel from ITT Sheraton. They formed Kyo-ya Company Ltd, a subsidiary of Kokusai Kogyo Company Ltd as the corporate entity to manage all their hotels.

After the Osano brothers&#x27; deaths, Takamasa Osano inherited their properties.

The ground upon which the hotel is built is owned by Kamehameha Schools, which leases the land.
The Royal Hawaiian closed on June 1, 2008, for renovation. It reopened on January 20, 2009 as a member of The Luxury Collection. An extended renovation of the Royal Beach Tower was completed in 2010.

The Royal Hawaiian Hotel is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

On November 12, 2024, workers at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel ratified a new labor contract.

==Architecture==

The six-story structure has 400 rooms. It was designed in the Spanish and Moorish styles with stucco façades. Its design was influenced by Hollywood film star and legend Rudolph Valentino and his Arabian movies. Cupolas were created to resemble Spanish Mission style bell towers. The architects were Warren and Wetmore of New York City.

The hotel&#x27;s public rooms were redecorated in 1946 by Frances Elkins, the sister of architect David Adler.

===Early settlements===

First indices of settlement in the area date back to 3000 BC.

Around 350 BC Celtic settlers found Noricum, from their word &quot;Tristis&quot;, which means rushing or dangerous, derived the name for the river &quot;Triesting&quot; which flows through Leobersdorf.

About 15 AD, Noricum was taken peacefully by the Romans. They most likely built a watchtower where the church is currently standing.

===Name===

Leobersdorf was first named in the &quot;Bayrische Traditionsbücher&quot; (Bavarian Traditionbooks) as Liubetsendorf around 1165 / 1174. This name possibly derives from the old-Slavic name &quot;Ljubac&quot; or the Celtic word Lewer or Loben, which means Border- or Gravehill.

The name changed over time. In 1311 it was &quot;Lewbesdorf&quot;, 1350 &quot;Leubesdorf&quot; and finally, 1588, &quot;Leobersdorf&quot;.

<text>Pocono Raceway (formerly Pocono International Raceway), also known as The Tricky Triangle, is a superspeedway located in the Pocono Mountains in Long Pond, Pennsylvania. It is the site of three NASCAR national series races and an ARCA Menards Series event in July: a NASCAR Cup Series race with support events by the NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. From 1971 to 1989, and from 2013 to 2019, the track also hosted an Indy Car race, last sanctioned by the IndyCar Series. Additionally, from 1982 to 2021, it hosted two NASCAR Cup Series races, with the traditional first date being removed in 2022. 

Pocono is one of the few tracks NASCAR competes at which are not owned by either NASCAR or Speedway Motorsports, the dominant track owners in NASCAR. Pocono CEO Nick Igdalsky and president Ben May are members of the family-owned Mattco Inc, started by Rose and Joseph Mattioli. Mattco also owns South Boston Speedway in South Boston, Virginia.

Outside NASCAR and IndyCar Series races, Pocono is used throughout the year by the Stock Car Experience, Bertil Roos Driving School, Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) as well as many other clubs and organizations. The triangular track also has three separate infield sections of racetrack – the north course, east course and south course. Each of these infield sections use separate portions of the track or can be combined for longer and more technical course configurations. In total Pocono Raceway has offers 22 different road course configurations ranging from .5 miles to 3.65 miles in length. During regular non-race weekends, multiple clubs or driving schools can use the track simultaneously by running on different infield sections. All of the infield sections can also be run in either clockwise or counter clockwise direction which doubles the 22 course configuration to 44 total course options.

==Track configuration==
The track was designed by 1959 and 1962 Indianapolis 500 winner Rodger Ward. Pocono Raceway has a unique design, as each turn is modeled after a turn at a different track.
*Turn one (14° banking) - modeled after Trenton Speedway
*Turn two (8° banking) also known as the &quot;Tunnel Turn&quot; - modeled after Indianapolis Motor Speedway
*Turn three (6° banking) - modeled after the Milwaukee Mile
The circuit is sometimes considered a tri-oval, but the turns are much more severe than those of a more typical tri-oval such as Daytona and other intermediate speedways. An additional complication is that the three turns are in no way the same, nor are any of the three straights identical in length. The banking of each turn is considerably less than on many other long superspeedways.

Although the track is long [], the sharp nature of the turns and the low banking tend to make the average speeds on NASCAR racecars lower than at other tracks of similar lengths. Because of its unique characteristics, Pocono is sometimes referred to as a &quot;roval&quot; (an oval track that behaves like a road course). Others refer to Pocono as a modified road course, due to the use of shifting gears to handle the range between the slowest turn and the fastest straightaway.

The unique design makes the setup of the car and the crew&#x27;s ability to make chassis adjustments more crucial than at many other tracks. Often it is the difference between a winning performance and a poor performance. 

The Track has the slogan, “what turn 4.” This is because Pocono has only three turns unlike most tracks that have four or more.

===Shifting===
In 1991 some drivers in NASCAR (notably Mark Martin) experimented with shifting gears down the long, front straight. The ratios for third gear and fourth gear were set so that third was used for most of the circuit (including the turns), and fourth was used for the later part of the long front stretch. This method provided a better RPM range around the track and improved overall lap times. By 1993, the entire field was shifting at Pocono, and using a special transmission (manufactured by Jerico) to shift gears without using the clutch. Shifting was criticized by some drivers (Rusty Wallace stated that the Jerico took away the ability to pass cars while Terry Labonte called it &quot;a pain in the butt&quot;). However, the practice continued until 2005, when a new gear rule eliminated the effectiveness of shifting. In 2011 the gear rule was changed again, and shifting returned to Pocono.

==IndyCar races at Pocono==

From 1971 to 1989, first USAC and then the CART IndyCar World Series held a race at Pocono as part of the IndyCar 500-mile Triple Crown. In 1989, Emerson Fittipaldi set a qualifying track record of . Following the 1989 race, however, the track was criticized for its roughness, lack of catch fencing and runoff areas. After continuing squabbles between the management and the sanctioning body, it was removed from the IndyCar schedule.

In the wake of a meeting between Pocono CEO Brandon Igdalsky and IndyCar CEO Randy Bernard at the 2012 Honda Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, speculation developed throughout 2012 regarding the possibility of a 2013 IndyCar Series race at Pocono Raceway. On the September 30, 2012, edition of Speed Channel&#x27;s WindTunnel with Dave Despain, Bernard officially confirmed that the IndyCar Series would return to Pocono with a 400-mile race on July 7, 2013. Further acknowledging Pocono&#x27;s place in IndyCar history, Bernard also announced that from 2013, the Indianapolis 500, Pocono IndyCar 400 and MAVTV 500 at California&#x27;s Auto Club Speedway would mark a revival of IndyCar&#x27;s all-oval Triple Crown. A $1 million bonus will be paid to a driver who wins all three races in a single season. Thanks to the popularity of their return to Pocono, they announced that they would lengthen the race to its original distance of 500-miles/200-laps. The 2014 event marked the first 500-mile IndyCar race at Pocono since 1989. It also became the fastest 500-mile race in motorsports history as Juan Pablo Montoya completed the race at an average speed of 202.402 MPH, breaking Mark Martin&#x27;s record that he established at Talladega Superspeedway in May 1997.

During the 2015 ABC Supply 500, Andretti Autosport driver Justin Wilson was struck in the head by Sage Karam&#x27;s nose cone after he crashed in turn 1 late in the race. Wilson died from his injuries on August 24, 2015, the day after the race, at Lehigh Valley Hospital–Cedar Crest in Allentown, Pennsylvania. On lap 7 of the 2018 edition, Ryan Hunter-Reay and rookie Robert Wickens collided at the exit of the Tunnel Turn while battling for 3rd, that saw Wickens&#x27; car fly into the catch fence, necessitating a lengthy red flag. Wickens survived the crash, but was paralysed from the waist down. In 2019, racing driver Felix Rosenqvist was hospitalised following a five-car collision, resulting in calls by Wickens for IndyCar to remove Pocono from the schedule. In their post-race press conference, Scott Dixon, Will Power, and Simon Pagenaud spoke in defense of returning to Pocono.

On September 1, 2019 the IndyCar Series released the 2020 schedule, and they will not be returning to Pocono in 2020. No reason was specified, and Pocono&#x27;s date was moved to Richmond Raceway.

==Race of Champions==
From 1977 to 1991, Pocono Raceway hosted the Race of Champions Modified race. From 1977 to 1979, the race was held on the triangular superspeedway; from 1980 onward, the three-quarter-mile infield oval was used. Richie Evans and George Kent were the leading winners, each winning two of the fifteen RoC events at Pocono. In 1992, the Race of Champions was moved to Flemington Raceway.

Richmond was the first HIV positive race car driver to win a major race, this was not revealed for nearly four years.
*July 20, 1986: Richmond recovers from a crash and beats Ricky Rudd and Geoff Bodine in a photo finish.
*June 19, 1988: On the opening lap of the 1988 Miller High Life 500, Bobby Allison suffered career-ending injuries when he spun and was T-boned by the No. 63 of Jocko Maggiacomo.
*August 21, 1988: Bobby Rahal wins the CART Quaker State 500. This was Bobby&#x27;s only win of the season. It was his final win with the Truesports IndyCar team, he would leave the team at the end of the season to join Team Kraco (incidentally at the end of 1989 Team Kraco merged with Galles racing to form Kraco-Galles). This was also the only Indycar win ever scored for the Judd engine.
*August 20, 1989: Danny Sullivan wins the final CART Pocono 500. This was the final year of the IndyCar 500 mile triple crown.
*1999: Bobby Labonte sweeps both races at Pocono.

*July 28, 2002: Steve Park and Dale Earnhardt Jr. became entangled exiting turn one, and both cars slammed into the inside wall, causing Park&#x27;s vehicle to go airborne over the hood of Earnhardt&#x27;s car and barrel roll. The incident resulted in a lengthy red flag to repair the old-fashioned highway barrier (a guardrail with wooden supports) that lined the inside of the track in that area. Soon afterward, all outdated barriers at the track were replaced with sturdier walls. The race was shortened by 25 laps due to this repair and rain delays throughout the race that pushed the race towards darkness. Bill Elliott won the race.
*2004: The SAFER barrier is installed in all the turns.
*2006: NASCAR&#x27;s Rookie of the Year Denny Hamlin sweeps both races of the 2006 season at Pocono.
*August 5, 2007: Kurt Busch dominates the Pennsylvania 500 by leading 175 of the 200 laps. A record that can not be broken because of the distance reduction that makes both races at Pocono 160 laps instead of 200.
*June 6, 2008: Pocono Raceway becomes one of the first NASCAR tracks in the country to utilize barcode-based ticketing.
*June 2008 James Hylton becomes the oldest driver to race at Pocono in the ARCA series.
*August 2, 2008: Frank Kimmel, a 9-time ARCA Re/Max Series champion, was injured after a 3-car crash on lap 68 of a Pocono race that involved his car being clipped and slamming into the backstretch wall on the driver&#x27;s side, going airborne as a result. Kimmel suffered a partially torn sphincter and pulled groin, spending the night in a local hospital before being released.
*June 7, 2009: Tony Stewart wins the 2009 Pocono 500. In doing so, he becomes the first person who both owns and drives his car to win in the NASCAR Cup Series since Ricky Rudd in 1998. The double-file restart shootout style restart procedure was introduced at the race for the first time at a NASCAR Cup Series points race.
*June 6, 2010: With two laps to go, Kevin Harvick turned Joey Logano, setting up a green white checkered finish. On the last lap, Kasey Kahne, who had been one of the fastest cars in the race found himself in the back of the pack on late race restart due to different pit strategies playing out, got a huge run on teammate A.J. Allmendinger and Allmendinger proceeded to force a flying Kahne going a good 10 mph quicker, into the grass causing him to spin and he was hit by Mark Martin and Greg Biffle, and flew through the air, landing on top of the wall and completely destroying several hedges outside the track due to the absence of a catch fence and he was hit by Jeff Gordon and several others as his car came to a rest on the track, due to the track being blocked. Both Kasey Kahne and Greg Biffle said that the wreck was Allmendinger&#x27;s fault as he had forced a much faster Kasey Kahne into the wet grass, causing him to spin to the right across the track in front of a little over half the field. Kahne stated that he would not speak to Allmendinger and that he usually did not anyway because there had been tension between the two for a while. Kahne did not like the way his young teammate drove, and during a night race at Phoenix the previous year Kasey Kahne was catching Allmendinger on the track, when Allmendinger began weaving to the left and right as though he was taunting teammate Kasey Kahne, prompting Kahne to say over the team radio &quot;What the Hell&#x27;s Allmendinger doing?!&quot;. Denny Hamlin cruised home to his third victory at Pocono.
*July 31, 2010: The NASCAR Truck Series raced for the first time at Pocono in the Pocono Mountains 125. It used a multi-truck qualifying format in which successive trucks were sent out 25 seconds apart. Elliott Sadler won the inaugural Truck Series event at Pocono.
*August 1, 2010: Jimmie Johnson clipped Kurt Busch on the Long Pond Straightaway and Busch spun across the track. Behind him, Elliott Sadler was turned by teammate A. J. Allmendinger and collided with the inside guardrail so savagely it ripped the engine out of the car and threw it to the entrance of the Tunnel Turn. Sadler&#x27;s wrecked car slid to a stop back on the track and despite being shaken and suffering some pain, he would climb out of the car slowly and was able to walk to the ambulance. The crash was recorded as the hardest hit in NASCAR history. This wreck (along with Kasey Kahne&#x27;s crash in the spring race) aroused concern over the safety of the track and renovations were made to improve safety, adding SAFER barriers to the inside retaining wall and a catch fence on the Long Pond Straightaway. Greg Biffle won the race, days after owner Jack Roush was involved in a plane crash.
*June 12, 2011: Jeff Gordon scored his 84th NASCAR Cup Series win, tying Bobby Allison and Darrell Waltrip for 3rd on the all-time win list.
*August 7, 2011: Brad Keselowski won the NASCAR Cup Series race just three days after sustaining an injury in a test crash at Road Atlanta. This would be the final 500-mile NASCAR race at Pocono Raceway when two days later NASCAR announced that starting in 2012 both NASCAR Cup events would be changed from 500 to 400 miles.
*October 4, 2011: Improvement projects were announced, including repaving the track, installing a new flag stand, making the pit stalls concrete, and adding a new pit wall. This was the first time the track has been repaved since 1995. The new flag stand came from an incident in which a NASCAR Truck Series hauler clipped the old stand and destroyed it in August 2011.
*January 26, 2012: Founder and chairman of the board for Pocono Raceway, Joseph Mattioli, dies after a long illness.
*January 31, 2012: After a viewing and a funeral, Mattioli took his last lap around Pocono Raceway.

==Environmental initiatives==

In July 2010 Pocono Raceway began the installation of a 3 megawatt solar photovoltaics system. Upon completion the racetrack became the largest solar-powered sports facility in the world. The &quot;solar farm&quot; encompasses approximately 25 acres and consists of almost 40,000 solar modules, which satisfies the energy consumption for the entire racing complex and will help power 1,000 homes. By December 2010, with less than four months in operation, the Pocono system had surpassed the 1,000,000 kilowatt hour production mark. Over the next 20 years the system is expected to produce in excess of 72 million kilowatt hours and offset 3,100 metric tons of carbon dioxide annually. Sheep are used to keep the grass to a low level.

==Early life and education==
Paul Stephen Rudd was born on April 6, 1969, in Passaic, New Jersey, to English Jewish parents. His father, Michael Rudd (1943–2008), was a historical tour guide and former vice-president of Trans World Airlines (TWA). His mother, Gloria Irene Granville, was a sales manager at television station KSMO-TV in Kansas City, Missouri. They were both from London, with his father hailing from Edgware and his mother from Surbiton, and both were descended from Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants who moved to England from Belarus, Poland and Russia. His parents were second cousins. Rudd had a Bar Mitzvah service in Ontario, Canada. Growing up, he loved reading the British comics &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;, which his uncle sent him from the United Kingdom.

When Rudd was ten, his family moved to Lenexa in Johnson County, Kansas. Because of his father&#x27;s occupation, they also spent three years in Anaheim, California. In Kansas, Rudd attended Broadmoor Junior High and graduated from Shawnee Mission West High School in 1987. He placed fifth in Humorous Interpretation at the 1987 National Forensics League National Tournament. He attended the University of Kansas, where he majored in theater and belonged to the Sigma Nu fraternity&#x27;s Nu Chapter. He studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts with fellow actor Matthew Lillard. He also spent three months studying Jacobean drama at the British American Drama Academy in Oxford. While at acting school, he worked as a disc jockey (DJ) at bar mitzvahs. After graduation, he had a variety of odd jobs, including glazing hams at the Holiday Ham Company in Overland Park.

==Career==
===Film and television===

Rudd made his acting debut in 1991 when he starred in a &quot;Super Nintendo&quot; commercial. In 1992, he starred in the television drama &quot;Sisters a&quot;s Kirby Quimby Philby. In 1994, he appeared in &quot;Wild Oats&quot; for six episodes. He left &quot;Sisters&quot; in 1995 to appear in the comedy film &quot;Clueless&quot; with Alicia Silverstone. Rudd followed &quot;Clueless&quot; with supporting roles films such as in &quot;&quot; as Tommy Doyle, &quot;William Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo + Juliet&quot;, &quot;The Locusts&quot;, &quot;Overnight Delivery&quot;, &quot;The Object of My Affection&quot;, and &quot;200 Cigarettes&quot;. He was in the cast of the 1999 film &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; that received a SAG nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.

He played FBI Agent Ian Curtis in Benny Chan&#x27;s 2000 Hong Kong action film &quot;Gen-Y Cops&quot;. In 2002, he was cast on the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; as Mike Hannigan, who dates and marries Phoebe Buffay, played by Lisa Kudrow. In 2006, he appeared in several episodes of &quot;Reno 911!&quot; as Guy Gerricault (pronounced &quot;jericho&quot;), the coach of a lamaze class; then portrayed a drug lord in the film &quot;Reno 911!: Miami.&quot; He guest-starred as a has-been 1990s rock star, Desmond Fellows, on the television series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, in the 2007 episode &quot;Debasement Tapes.&quot;

The year 2004 marked the start of Rudd&#x27;s work with director/producer Judd Apatow, first on the film &quot;&quot; as Brian Fantana with Steve Carell, David Koechner and Will Ferrell, produced by Apatow; and again in 2005 in &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot; with Carell and Seth Rogen, directed by Apatow. He subsequently appeared in Apatow in 2007&#x27;s &quot;Knocked Up&quot; as frustrated husband Pete, married to Leslie Mann&#x27;s character, co-starring with Jason Segel, Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, and Jay Baruchel. He narrated the 2007 edition of the long-running sports documentary series &quot;Hard Knocks&quot;, which featured the Kansas City Chiefs, whom he continues to support. It was the only season not to feature the series&#x27; regular narrator, Liev Schreiber.

Rudd appeared as John Lennon in the comedy film &quot;Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story&quot; in 2007 and as a drug-addled surf instructor in Nicholas Stoller&#x27;s &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot; in 2008 with Jason Segel and Jonah Hill, both of which Apatow produced. Rudd had uncredited cameos in &quot;Year One&quot; (2009) and &quot;Bridesmaids&quot; (2011). In 2012, he starred in and co-produced with Apatow &quot;Wanderlust&quot; with Jennifer Aniston. He starred with Leslie Mann in the &quot;Knocked Up&quot; spinoff &quot;This Is 40&quot;, directed and produced by Apatow, and reprised his role of Brian Fantana in &quot;Anchorman 2: The Legend Continues&quot; (2013).

In 2007, he starred in &quot;The Oh in Ohio&quot; and &quot;The Ten&quot;, which reunited him with David Wain and Michael Showalter, and then in &quot;Over Her Dead Body&quot; with Eva Longoria the next year. In his next comedy which he also wrote, &quot;Role Models&quot;, he and co-star Seann William Scott portray energy drink salesmen forced to perform community service in a child mentoring program.

In 2009, Rudd again appeared with Jason Segel in &quot;I Love You, Man&quot; where he and Segel play buddies who bond over their shared love for the rock band Rush. Both Rudd and Segel are themselves fans of the band. Also in 2009, Rudd co-created the TV series &quot;Party Down&quot; with John Embom, Rob Thomas, and Dan Etheridge. He lent his voice to the DreamWorks animated movie &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;.

In 2010, Rudd reunited with Steve Carell for the first time since &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot; for the Jay Roach-directed comedy &quot;Dinner for Schmucks&quot;. In 2012, he had a supporting role in the drama &quot;The Perks of Being a Wallflower&quot;, playing Mr. Anderson, a teacher of Charlie, played by Logan Lerman. He starred in the 2011 comedy-drama film &quot;Our Idiot Brother&quot; with Elizabeth Banks, Zooey Deschanel, and Emily Mortimer. It was the fifth film that Rudd starred in with Elizabeth Banks. He had previously appeared with her in &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; (2001), &quot;The Baxter&quot; (2005), &quot;The 40-Year-Old Virgin&quot; (2005), and &quot;Role Models&quot; (2008).

In 2012, Rudd signed to appear on four episodes of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; as Bobby Newport, a candidate for City Council and a rival of Amy Poehler&#x27;s character Leslie Knope, a role for which he won the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Guest Performer in a Comedy Series. In 2014, he began providing voiceovers for Hyundai television commercials. He has also voiced the audiobook recordings of John Hodgman&#x27;s books &quot;The Areas of My Expertise&quot; (2005) and &quot;More Information Than You Require&quot; (2008).

On December 19, 2013, Rudd was officially confirmed as cast in the 2015 Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film &quot;Ant-Man&quot;. He played lead character Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Rudd reprised his role in &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; (2016) as well as &quot;Ant-Man&quot;″s 2018 sequel, &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp&quot;; he also co-wrote the latter. Rudd returned alongside Evangeline Lilly in &quot;&quot; (2019), which received critical acclaim and went on to become the highest-grossing film of all time. He reprised his role in 2023 with &quot;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&quot;.

Rudd reprised his role as Andy from &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; in the Netflix prequel &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp&quot;, alongside an ensemble cast including Bradley Cooper, Amy Poehler, and Elizabeth Banks, all reprising their roles from the 2001 film. In 2016, he appeared in the comedy-drama film &quot;The Fundamentals of Caring&quot;, alongside Selena Gomez, and lent his voice to the animated films &quot;The Little Prince&quot; and &quot;Sausage Party&quot;. He also lent his voice to a struggling actor named John in the animated comedy film &quot;Nerdland&quot; (2016), alongside Patton Oswalt. 
Rudd was also cast as the lead in &quot;The Catcher Was a Spy&quot; (2018), playing Moe Berg, a catcher for the Boston Red Sox who joined the OSS during World War II.
In August 2018, Rudd was cast in Netflix&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Living with Yourself&quot;, alongside Aisling Bea. He also executive produced the series, which premiered on October 18, 2019. He also appeared in season 3 of Hulu&#x27;s comedy mystery series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot;.

From 2004 until 2021, during all appearances on the late night comedy shows hosted by comedian Conan O&#x27;Brien, when promoting his projects Rudd would explain the clip that is about to be shown, but would then throw to a clip from the 1988 movie &quot;Mac and Me&quot; instead. Rudd admitted that he &quot;never imagined&quot; that the running gag would last so long. &quot;There&#x27;s something so tricky about it. Cause here I am. I&#x27;m gonna sell my wares on TV. Like, &#x27;Here&#x27;s something from what I just filmed.&#x27; It just seemed—and still does to a large extent—kind of insincere,&quot; he said. Rudd continued the tradition by deceiving Conan with an audio version of the prank on a 2022 episode of the podcast &quot;Conan O&#x27;Brien Needs a Friend&quot;, &quot;Paul Rudd Returns&quot;.

In 2024, Rudd received two nominations at the 76th Primetime Emmy Awards; for his role as a murder victim in the mystery series &quot;Only Murders in the Building&quot; he was one of the nominees for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, while his narration in the National Geographic documentary series &quot;Secrets of the Octopus&quot; earned him a nomination for Outstanding Narrator.

===Theater===
Rudd has also appeared in Broadway plays, the first being &quot;The Last Night of Ballyhoo&quot; as Joe Farkas in 1997. The next year he appeared in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; with Kyra Sedgwick and Max Wright at the Lincoln Center Theatre. In 2006, he appeared in the Broadway production of Richard Greenberg&#x27;s &quot;Three Days of Rain&quot; with Bradley Cooper and Julia Roberts at the Bernard Jacobs Theater. In 2012, Rudd appeared in the Broadway production of Craig Wright&#x27;s &quot;Grace&quot; at the Cort Theatre, with Academy Award nominee Michael Shannon, Kate Arrington, and seven-time Emmy Award winner Ed Asner.

In 2000–2001, Rudd was in a production of Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night with Jessica Lange, Charles Dance and Olivia Colman, at the Lyric Theatre, London. In 2001, he starred as Adam in the original London production of Neil LaBute&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Things&quot;, and again Off-Broadway for three months starting in October 2001. Two years later, a film version was made with the same cast.

==Personal life==
In 2003, Rudd married Julie Yaeger, whom he met (shortly after working on &quot;Clueless&quot;) in his publicist&#x27;s office, where she worked. She has since become a screenwriter and producer. They live in Rhinebeck, New York, with their two children: a son born in 2006 and a daughter born in 2010.

Rudd is a fan of MLB&#x27;s Kansas City Royals, Kansas Jayhawks sports, and the NFL&#x27;s Kansas City Chiefs, for whom he narrated the 2007 season of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Hard Knocks.&quot; Rudd has also narrated the Chiefs&#x27; annual Super Bowl recap episodes of &quot;America&#x27;s Game: The Super Bowl Champions&quot; in 2020, 2023, and 2024.

Rudd received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on July 1, 2015, unveiling the 2,554th star on the mile-long strip of plaques on Hollywood Boulevard. He said, &quot;I remember being a kid and walking this boulevard and reading the names and thinking about what so many other millions of people thought about, which is, you know, &#x27;Who&#x27;s that?&#x27;&quot;

Since 2014, Rudd and fellow actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan have been co-owners of Samuel&#x27;s Sweet Shop, a candy store in Rhinebeck, New York that they saved from closing when the previous owner, a friend of theirs, died unexpectedly.

Rudd&#x27;s seemingly ageless appearance has been subject to numerous jokes and memes; this has even been referenced in &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024) where Deadpool and Wolverine stumble upon Giant-Man&#x27;s corpse, prompting the former to say &quot;Paul Rudd finally aged!&quot; Responding to the jokes, Rudd has explained that sleep, diet, and exercise are his holy grail of anti-aging. He reported that eight hours of sleep, along with cardio, exercise with weights, and healthy meals, make it possible for him to defy aging. 

Rudd identifies as Jewish, although he has also admitted that he is not &quot;particularly religious. While promoting the film &quot;Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire&quot;, the actor told that if he could talk with anyone throughout History, he would want to speak with Jesus.

=== Philanthropy and advocacy ===
Rudd is a supporter of the Stuttering Association for the Young (SAY), a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping young people who stutter. He hosted its 6th Annual All-Star Bowling Benefit on January 22, 2018. He told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that he became an advocate for stuttering awareness after portraying a character who stuttered in a play. Also, he is a founder of The Big Slick, a celebrity charity sports event held in Kansas City each June that supports Kansas City&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Mercy Hospital.

Rudd was part of Seth Rogen&#x27;s Hilarity for Charity, to increase awareness and investment in Alzheimer&#x27;s research.

<text>John Stephen Akhwari (born 1938 in Mbulu, Tanganyika) is a Tanzanian former marathon runner from the Iraqw tribe. He represented Tanzania in the marathon at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City.

==1968 Olympic marathon==
While competing in the marathon in Mexico City, Akhwari cramped up due to the high altitude of the city. He had not trained at such an altitude back in his country. At the 19 kilometer point during the 42 km race, there was jockeying for position between some runners and he was hit. He fell badly wounding his knee and dislocating that joint plus his shoulder hit hard against the pavement. He however continued running, finishing last among the 57 competitors who completed the race (75 had started). The winner of the marathon, Mamo Wolde of Ethiopia, finished in 2:20:26. Akhwari finished in 3:25:27, when there were only a few thousand people left in the stadium, and the sun had set. A television crew was sent out from the medal ceremony when word was received that there was one more runner about to finish.

As he finally crossed the finish line a cheer came from the small crowd. When interviewed later and asked why he continued running, he said, &quot;My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race; they sent me 5,000 miles to finish the race.&quot;

==Athletic career==
Akhwari competed for many years before and after the 1968 Olympics. He finished first in the African Marathon Championships before the Olympics. He finished fifth in the marathon at the 1970 Commonwealth Games where he ran a 2:15:05 time. The winner had run 2:09:28. In those same Games he ran a 28:44 in the 10,000 meter race and was only about 30 seconds behind the leaders. He ran marathons in the 2:20 range on a regular basis both before and after the 1968 Olympics. He was a world class runner for most of the 1960s and 1970s.

==Post-Athletic career==
Akhwari has lived for many years in his village with his wife and children. They are farmers and work very hard in the fields. He was awarded a National Hero Medal of Honor in 1983. He lent his name to the John Stephen Akhwari Athletic Foundation, an organization which supports Tanzanian athletes training for the Olympic Games. He was invited to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. He later appeared in Beijing as a goodwill ambassador in preparation for the 2008 Games. He was a torchbearer in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania on April 13, 2008, for the Olympic torch relay through his country.

<doc id="685613" wikidata="Q7839794" url="?curid=685613" title="Tri-oval">
<text>A tri-oval is a shape which derives its name from the two other shapes it most resembles, a triangle and an oval. Rather than meeting at sharp, definable angles as the sides of a triangle do, in a tri-oval these angles are instead rounded into smooth curves.

While an oval has four turns, a tri-oval has six. More formally, according to the four-vertex theorem, every smooth simple closed curve has at least four vertices, points where its curvature reaches a local minimum or maximum. In a tri-oval, there are six such points, alternating between three minima and three maxima.

==Use in racetracks==

This term is most often used to describe the shape of many automobile racetracks.

The use of the tri-oval shape for automobile racing was conceived by Bill France Sr. during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as Indianapolis) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans to look back and forth much like a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to &quot;lean&quot; to see oncoming cars, and creates more forward sight lines.

In other racing vernacular, the term &quot;tri-oval&quot; is also used to specifically describe the part of the track which represents the top triangular point of the course, which is used as the main stretch, the pit straight and usually the start–finish line. It is recognizable in most tracks by a manicured grass area.

The modern tri-ovals were often called &quot;cookie cutters&quot; because of their (nearly) identical shape and identical kind of races.

<doc id="685620" wikidata="Q3953767" url="?curid=685620" title="Ancient Order of Hibernians">
<text>The Ancient Order of Hibernians (AOH; ) is an Irish Catholic fraternal organization. Members must be male, Catholic, and either born in Ireland or of Irish descent. Its largest membership is in the United States, where it was founded in New York City in 1836.

The name was adopted by groups of Irish immigrants in the United States, its purpose to act as guards to shield Catholic churches from anti-Catholic forces in the mid-19th century, and to assist Irish Catholic immigrants, especially those who faced discrimination or harsh coal mining working conditions. Many members in the coal mining area of Pennsylvania allegedly had a background with the Molly Maguires. It became an important focus of Irish American political activity.

== Ireland ==
=== Origins ===

The organization had its roots in the Defenders and the Ribbonmen, Catholic agrarian movements of the 18th and 19th centuries. It emerged in Ulster at the end of the 19th century in opposition to the Orange Order. It was organized by Joseph Devlin of Belfast, who was Grand Master by 1905. The AOH was closely associated with the Irish Parliamentary Party, its members mainly members of the party. It was strongly opposed to secular ideologies such as those of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (the IRB), who were most unhappy at the re-emergence of this old rival &quot;right-wing&quot; nationalist society.

From a membership of 5,000 in 1900, nearly all in Ulster, it climbed to 64,000 by 1909, complementing the United Irish League. By 1914 the order had spread throughout the country, mainly because of its utility as a patronage, brokerage and recreational association. As a vehicle for Irish nationalism, the AOH greatly influenced the sectarian aspect of Irish politics in the early twentieth century. In Ulster and elsewhere it acted as an unruly but vigorous militant support organization for Devlin, Dillon and Redmond against radicals and against William O&#x27;Brien: O&#x27;Brien regarded himself as having been driven from the party by militant Hibernians at the &quot;Baton Convention&quot; of 1909.

The ceremonial aspects of the Order resembled those of the Orange Order with green replacing orange on sashes and banners. This led to opponents such as Jim Larkin calling it the &quot;Ancient Order of Catholic Orangemen&quot;.

=== After 1916 ===
After the 1916 Easter Rising the organisation declined outside of Ulster, its members absorbed into Sinn Féin and the Irish Republican Army (the IRA). In many areas the organisation provided by the AOH was the nearest thing to a paramilitary force. On the other hand, on 13 June 1916 Joe Devlin chaired an AOH Convention in Dublin that approved the proposed partition of Ireland by 475 votes to 265.

Many republican leaders in the 1916–1923 period, among them Seán Mac Diarmada, J. J. Walsh, and Rory O&#x27;Connor, had been &quot;Hibs&quot; before the formation of the Irish Volunteers in 1913.

The AOH is also significant as a link between the new nationalist organisations and the century-old tradition of popular militant societies. More directly, it lingered on as a pro-Treaty support organisation. Some Hibernians fought in the Irish Brigade in the Spanish Civil War. The quasi-Fascist Blueshirts movement of the 1930s may, in fact, have owed as much to the Ribbon tradition which it so much resembled, as it did to continental analogies.

=== Recent decades ===
Within Ulster generally, but especially within Northern Ireland, the AOH remains a visible but somewhat marginal part of the Catholic community. It parades at Easter, Lady Day and a few other times a year.

At the beginning of The Troubles, the AOH placed a voluntary ban on its members parading until 1975, though records of some parades taking place in defiance of the ban were reported. In 1978 an estimated 10,000 participants attended a parade in Kilrea. Since then there has been a rapid decrease of numbers and usually around twenty divisions parade at a single location.

The locations of AOH parades in Northern Ireland generally tend to be cities with a high Catholic population, coupled with the AOH&#x27;s desire not to provoke trouble. County Fermanagh has never hosted an AOH parade since the onset of The Troubles and County Armagh has held one. The majority of the 21 locations for parades have been in counties Antrim, Down and Londonderry. On occasion when the parade has been held in an area with a significant loyalist population it has been met with an aggressive protest, notably Garvagh in 1985 and Armoy in 1989 which held its first AOH parade in 35 years.

== United States ==

=== Early years ===
The order was founded in the United States on 4 May 1836, at St. James Church in New York City, near the old Five Points neighbourhood. A branch was formed the same year at Pottsville, Pennsylvania. The existence and activities of the order were concealed for some years.

In 1850, members prevented the burning of St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral by mobs of anti-Catholic Know Nothings.

During the late 1860s and early 1870s many of the lodges of the order in Pennsylvania were infiltrated by the Molly Maguires. However the Molly Maguires and their criminal activities were condemned at the 1876 national convention of the AOH and the order was reorganised in the Pennsylvania coal areas.

=== Split, reunion and auxiliary ===
In 1884 there was a split in the organisation. The order had previously been governed by the Board of Erin, which had governed the order in Ireland, Great Britain and the United States, but was composed of officers selected exclusively by the organisations in Ireland and Great Britain. The majority left in 1884 and became the Ancient Order of Hibernians of America (A.O.H. (Irish-American Alliance)), while the small earlier group called itself Ancient Order of Hibernians, Board of Erin (A.O.H (B.O.E.)). In 1897 the Ancient Order of Hibernians, Board of Erin, had approximately 40,000 members concentrated in New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, while the Ancient Order of Hibernians of America had nearly 125,000 members scattered throughout nearly every state in the union. The two groups reunited in 1898.

A female auxiliary, the Daughters of Erin, was formed in 1894, and had 20,000 members in 1897. It was attached to the larger, &quot;American&quot; version of the order.

In 1883, Bucks County Division 1 was formed in Bristol, Pennsylvania. It is the oldest continuously chartered division in Pennsylvania and one of the oldest in the United States. The Bucks County Division 1 Clubhouse, constructed in 1893, is believed to be the one of the oldest, continuously operated AOH Halls. Michael Dougherty, a Division 1 Charter Member, was an Irish immigrant from Falcarragh, County Donegal, Ireland, is the Division 1 Namesake. He was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his service during the Civil War, where he served in the Union Army with the Second Irish Dragons.

In 1898, the Port Richmond Division 87 was formed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It remains one of the oldest continuously chartered divisions within the Philadelphia County Board and Pennsylvania State Board.

The Ladies Auxiliary of the Ancient Order of Hibernians raised $50,000 to build the Nuns of the Battlefield sculpture in Washington, D.C., which the United States Congress authorised in 1918. The Irish-American sculptor, Jerome Connor, ended up suing the order for non-payment.

John F. Kennedy joined the AOH in 1947. The AOH&#x27;s national chaplains have included prominent clergymen such as Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen and Cardinal Francis Spellman.

=== 1960s onwards ===
The AOH had 181,000 members in 1965, and 171,000 in 736 local units or &quot;Divisions&quot; in 1979.

U.S. Congressman Mario Biaggi received the Ancient Order of Hibernians Friend of the Irish Award in 2011.

In 1982, in a revival of Hibernianism, the Thomas Francis Meagher Division No. 1 formed in Helena, Montana, dedicated to the principles of the order and to restoring a historically accurate record of Brigadier General Meagher&#x27;s contributions to Montana. Soon after, six additional divisions formed in Montana.

The Brothers of St. Patrick Division of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in America was established at Brothers of St. Patrick in Midway City, California, in 1995. In 1997, the first division in Tennessee, the James Dardis Division No. 1, was formed in Knoxville Tennessee.

In 2002, the Fr. Bernard Donnelly Division was established in Johnson County, Kansas dedicated to community service and reintroducing Hibernianism to Kansas. Its name honors the founder of Kansas City&#x27;s Irish Community, Fr. Bernard Donnelly (c. 1800–1880), an immigrant from County Cavan.

In 2013, The Ancient Order of Hibernians raised and distributed over $200,000 to aid victims of Hurricane Sandy. In 2014, the AOH called for a boycott of the retailer Spencer&#x27;s for selling products the AOH says promote anti-Irish stereotypes and irresponsible drinking. On 10 May 2014 a memorial to John Barry, an immigrant to the US from Wexford who was a naval commander of the American Revolution and who holds commission number one in the subsequent U.S. Navy, was dedicated on the grounds of the United States Naval Academy. The memorial and associated &quot;Barry Gate&quot; was presented to the academy by the members of the Ancient Order of Hibernians.

On 17 August 2017, the John Fitzgerald Division was chartered in Lincoln, Nebraska. On 23 April 2019, the first division in Arizona, No. 1, was formed in Phoenix, Arizona. The division was formed on the grounds of the Irish Cultural Center.

== Symbols ==
At formal events, members wear a green blazer and an Irish tricolor sash of green, white, and orange.

== Activities ==
The order organised the New York City St. Patrick&#x27;s Day Parade for 150 years until 1993, when control was transferred to an independent committee amid controversy over the exclusion of Irish-American gay and lesbian groups and after Mayor Dinkins for that reason had boycotted the 1992 parade.

== Buildings ==

Several buildings of the Ancient Order of Hibernians are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places or are otherwise notable.

<text>Norman Adrian Malcolm (; 11 June 1911 – 4 August 1990) was an American philosopher.

==Biography==
Malcolm was born in Selden, Kansas. He studied philosophy with O. K. Bouwsma at the University of Nebraska, then enrolled as a graduate student at Harvard University in 1933.

At Cambridge University in 1938–9, he met G. E. Moore and Ludwig Wittgenstein. Malcolm attended Wittgenstein&#x27;s lectures on the philosophical foundations of mathematics throughout 1939 and remained one of Wittgenstein&#x27;s closest friends. Malcolm&#x27;s memoir of his time with Wittgenstein, published in 1958, is widely acclaimed as one of the most captivating and most accurate portraits of Wittgenstein&#x27;s remarkable personality.

After serving in the United States Navy from 1942 to 1945, Malcolm, with his wife, Leonida, and their son, Raymond Charles Malcolm, resided in Cambridge again in 1946–47. He saw a good deal of Wittgenstein during that time, and they continued to correspond frequently thereafter. In 1947, Malcolm joined the faculty at Cornell University, where he taught until his retirement. In 1949, Wittgenstein was a guest of the Malcolms in Ithaca, New York. In that year Malcolm introduced O. K. Bouwsma to Wittgenstein. Bouwsma remained close to Wittgenstein until Wittgenstein&#x27;s death in 1951.

==Philosophical work==
In 1959, his book &quot;Dreaming&quot; was published, in which he elaborated on Wittgenstein&#x27;s question as to whether it really mattered if people who tell dreams &quot;really had these images while they slept, or whether it merely seems so to them on waking&quot;. This work was also a response to Descartes&#x27; &quot;Meditations&quot;.

Other than that he is known for propagating the view that common sense philosophy and ordinary language philosophy are the same. He was generally supportive of Moore&#x27;s theory of knowledge and certitude, though he found Moore&#x27;s style and method of arguing to be ineffective. His critique of Moore&#x27;s articles on skepticism (and also on Moore&#x27;s &#x27;Here is a hand&#x27; argument) lay the foundation for the renewed interest in common sense philosophy and ordinary language philosophy.

Malcolm was also a defender of a modal version of the ontological argument. In 1960 he argued that the argument originally presented by Anselm of Canterbury in the second chapter of his &quot;Proslogion&quot; was just an inferior version of the argument propounded in chapter three. His argument is similar to those produced by Charles Hartshorne and Alvin Plantinga. Malcolm argued that a God cannot simply exist as a matter of contingency but rather must exist in necessity if at all. He argued that if God exists in contingency then his existence is subject to a series of conditions that would then be greater than God and this would be a contradiction (referring to Anselm&#x27;s definition of God as That than which Nothing Greater can be Conceived).

<text>Carlos Latuff (Arabic: كارلوس لطوف; born 30 November 1968) is a Brazilian political cartoonist. His work deals with themes such as anti-Western sentiment, anti-capitalism, and opposition to U.S. military intervention in foreign countries. He is best-known for his images depicting the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the Arab Spring.

Latuff&#x27;s cartoons comparing Israel to Nazi Germany have been labelled as antisemitic by some advocacy organisations and individuals. Latuff has dismissed the charges as &quot;a strategy for discrediting criticism of Israel&quot; and stated that his drawings are aimed at highlighting the similarities between the status of Jews in German-occupied Europe and the status of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories.

==Early life==
Latuff was born in the São Cristóvão neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and is of Lebanese descent. He has stated that his &quot;Arab roots&quot; are what drive him to advocate for Arab causes, including the Palestinian cause.

== History ==
Latuff&#x27;s career began in 1990, as a cartoonist for leftist publications in Brazil. After watching a 1997 documentary about the Zapatistas in Mexico, he sent a couple of cartoons to them, and received a positive response. He has stated that after this experience, he decided to start a website and engage in &quot;artistic activism&quot;. Graham Fowell, ex-chairman of the Cartoonists&#x27; Club of Great Britain, has compared his work to that of Banksy, the English-based graffiti artist.

In 2011, Latuff was contacted by activists in Egypt. Latuff has stated that he was encouraged when he saw some of his cartoons depicted in the January 25 Egyptian protests, a couple of days after he made them. According to Reuters, this helped him become &quot;a hero of the tumultuous Arab Spring with rapid-fire satirical sketches&quot;.

Latuff has been arrested at least three times in Brazil for his cartoons about the Brazilian police, whom he has criticized for police brutality.

==Published works==
Latuff&#x27;s works have often been self-published on Indymedia websites and private blogs. He is a weekly cartoonist for &quot;The Globe Post&quot; and some of his cartoons have been featured in magazines such as the Brazilian edition of &quot;Mad&quot;, &quot;Le Monde Diplomatique&quot; and the &quot;Mondoweiss&quot; website. In addition, a few of his works were published on Arab websites and publications such as the &quot;Islamic Front for the Iraqi Resistance&quot; (JAMI) magazine, the Saudi magazine &quot;Character&quot;, the Lebanese newspaper &quot;Al Akhbar&quot;, among others. Additionally, Latuff also contributes to several Middle Eastern newspapers, including &quot;Alquds Alarabi&quot;, &quot;Huna Sotak&quot; and the &quot;Islamophobia Research and Documentation Project – IRDP.&quot; In 2019 a selection of his cartoons was published in the book &quot;Drawing Attention to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Political Cartoons by Carlos Latuff&quot;. His work is also published on the Chinese Twitter account &quot;Valiant Panda&quot; heavily shared by Chinese state affiliated media, government officials, and embassies.

==Themes==
Latuff has produced numerous cartoons related to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which assumed significance for the cartoonist after a visit to the region in the late 1990s. His cartoons are highly critical of Israel.

Latuff&#x27;s work has also been critical of the US military action in Iraq and in Afghanistan. He began to publish his work on the web from the earliest stages of the invasion. Latuff says, &quot;war is not a video game, and technofetishism is not to be celebrated, but exposed.&quot; 

Since the end of 2010, he has been engaged in producing cartoons about the Arab Spring in which he sided with the revolutionaries. After the victory of revolutions in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya his cartoons about these countries have focused on the menace of counter-revolution or Western interference. Some of his cartoons have been displayed in mass demonstrations in Arab countries.

== Controversies ==
=== Allegations of antisemitism ===
In 2002 the Swiss-based Holocaust survivors&#x27; organization Aktion Kinder des Holocaust sued the Indymedia of Switzerland on the charge of antisemitism for publishing Latuff&#x27;s cartoon titled &quot;We are all Palestinians&quot; series in their website, which depicted a Jewish boy in the Warsaw Ghetto saying: &quot;I am Palestinian.&quot; The criminal proceedings were suspended by Swiss court.

Eddy Portnoy, in &quot;The Forward&quot;, reviewing the book in 2008, wrote that Latuff&#x27;s material is &quot;often terribly obnoxious... but it is a stretch to categorize his cartoons as antisemitic.&quot;

=== Latuff&#x27;s response ===
Latuff, in an interview with the Jewish-American weekly newspaper &quot;The Forward&quot; in December 2008, responded to charges of antisemitism and the comparisons made between his cartoons and those published in &quot;Der Stürmer&quot; in Nazi Germany:

My cartoons have no focus on the Jews or on Judaism. My focus is Israel as a political entity, as a government, their armed forces being a satellite of U.S. interests in the Middle East, and especially Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. It happens to be Israeli Jews that are the oppressors of Palestinians... My detractors say that the use of the Magen David in my Israel-related cartoons is irrefutable proof of antisemitism; however, it&#x27;s not my fault if Israel chose sacred religious motifs as national symbols, such as the Knesset Menorah or the Star of David in killing-machines like F-16 jets.

Latuff also stated that antisemitism is real, that antisemites - like European neo-Nazis - &quot;hijack&quot; the Palestinian cause to bash Israel. However, to assert that anti-Zionism is antisemitic is, in his view, &quot;a well-known tactic of intellectual dishonesty.&quot; He said that political cartoonists work by metaphors, and that similarities can be found between the IDF treatment of Palestinians and what Jews experienced under the Nazis. Such comparisons are not created by cartoonists, he said, but can be made by the viewer. He instanced the fact that a Holocaust survivor like Tommy Lapid reacted to the image of a Palestinian woman foraging in the rubble by thinking of his grandmother who was murdered in Auschwitz. The use of cartoons insulting Muslims by depicting Muhammad as a bomber is defended as &quot;freedom of speech&quot;, while using the Holocaust in drawings is deplored as &quot;hatred against the Jews&quot;.

Latuff was included in Simon Wiesenthal Center&#x27;s 2012 Top Ten Anti-Israel/Anti-Semitic Slurs list being placed third for depicting Israeli premier Benjamin Netanyahu squeezing votes out of a dead Arab child. Latuff told Brazil&#x27;s &quot;Opera Mundi&quot; newspaper that he considered the award &quot;a joke worthy of a Woody Allen movie&quot;. He also said that Zionist lobbying groups try to associate him with well-known extremists and racists in order to disqualify his criticism of the Israeli government. He also said figures such as José Saramago, Desmond Tutu and Jimmy Carter were also accused of being antisemitic, saying that he was &quot;in good company&quot;.

<text>Phra That Si Song Rak (, literally means &quot;the Stupa in Honour of Two Loves&quot;;()Phra That Sri Song Hak in [[Lao language|Lao]], and varied other spellings) is a Buddhist stupa built in c. 1560 by King Setthathirath of Lan Xang and King Maha Chakkraphat of Ayutthaya. It is located on the Man River in Dan Sai district, Loei province of modern-day Thailand, from the modern Thailand-Laos border. The name means &quot;Stupa of Love from the Two Nations&quot;.

The ancient kingdoms of Lan Xang and Ayutthaya enjoyed a strong amount of common bond, and faced a common enemy: (the Burmese). In c. 1556, King Setthathirath of Lan Xang and King Maha Chakkraphat of Ayutthaya, decided to build a great temple celebrating a pact of mutual respect and defense between the two kingdoms. Phra That Sri Songrak was built on the border.

A stone inscription at the stupa reads:
:&quot;The generations to come must not violate and dispossess territory of the other. They must not be greedy or act in a deceitful manner in their interaction until the sun and the moon fall down on this land.&quot;

When the French annexed Dan Sai district as part of colonial Laos, the inscription was taken to Vientiane. At some point it was shattered into fragments, and the remnants are maintained at Haw Phra Kaew Museum. A replica of the tablet now exists at Phra That Si Song Rak.

The stupa is roughly tall and wide at the base on each side.

Locals have held an annual offertory ritual and celebration at That Sri Songrak every May 15 for centuries. The celebration is a major Loei attraction.

Loei province uses the image of the stupa&#x27;s tower in its provincial seal.
