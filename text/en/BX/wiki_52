<text>Santa Cruz de la Sierra (; ), commonly known as Santa Cruz, is the largest city in Bolivia and the capital of the Santa Cruz department.

Situated on the Pirai River in the eastern Tropical Lowlands of Bolivia, the Santa Cruz de la Sierra Metropolitan Region is the most populous urban agglomeration in Bolivia with an estimated population of 2.4 million in 2020. It is formed out of a conurbation of seven Santa Cruz municipalities: Santa Cruz de la Sierra, La Guardia, Warnes, Cotoca, El Torno, Porongo, and Montero.

The city was first founded in 1561 by Spanish explorer Ñuflo de Chavez about east of its current location, and was moved several times until it was finally established on the Pirai River in the late 16th century. For much of its history, Santa Cruz was mostly a small outpost town, and even after Bolivia gained its independence in 1825 there was little attention from the authorities or the population in general to settle the region. It was not until after the middle of the 20th century with profound agrarian and land reforms that the city began to grow at a very fast pace. Due to its low elevation at the foothills of the Andes and being situated in the Amazon basin, the city has a tropical climate unlike the other main metro area of La Paz that is thousands of meters higher in terms of elevation.

Santa Cruz is Bolivia&#x27;s most populous city, produces nearly 35% of Bolivia&#x27;s gross domestic product, and receives over 40% of all foreign direct investment in the country. The city is the most important business center in Bolivia and the country&#x27;s principal destination for national and international migrants.

== History ==

===Pre-Columbian era===

Like much of the history of the people of the region, the history of the area before the arrival of European explorers is not well documented, mostly because of the somewhat nomadic nature and the absence of a written language in the culture of the local tribes. However, recent data suggests that the current location of the city of Santa Cruz was inhabited by an Arawak tribe that later came to be known by the Spanish as Chané. Remains of ceramics and weapons have been found in the area, leading researchers to believe they had established settlements in the area. Among the few known facts of these tribes, according to accounts of the first Spanish explorers that came into contact with the Chané, are that they had a formal leader, a &quot;cacique&quot;, called Grigotá for several years but his reign came to an end after one of the several Guarani (Chiriguano) incursions in the area.

===Early European incursions and founding of the city===

The first Europeans to set foot in the area were Spanish conquistadores from the recently created Governorate of New Andalusia that encompassed the territories of present-day Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile.

In 1549, Captain General Domingo Martinez de Irala became the first Spaniard to explore the region, but it was not until 1558 that Ñuflo de Chavez, who had arrived in Asunción in 1541 with Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, led a new expedition with the objective of settling the region. After discovering that a new expedition from Asuncion was already underway, he quickly traveled to Lima and successfully persuaded the Viceroy to create a new province and grant him the title of governor on February 15, 1560. Upon returning from Lima, Chavez founded the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra (Holy Cross of the Hills) on February 26, 1561, east of its present-day location, to function as the capital of the newly formed province of Moxos and Chaves. The settlement was named after Chaves&#x27;s home town in Extremadura, where he grew up before venturing to America.

Shortly after the founding, attacks from local tribes became commonplace and Ñuflo de Chaves was killed in 1568 by Itatine natives. After Chaves&#x27;s death, the conflicts with the local population as well as power struggles in the settlement forced the authorities in Peru to order the new governor, Lorenzo Suarez de Figueroa to relocate the city to the west. Many of the inhabitants, however, chose to stay behind and continued living in the original location. On September 13, 1590, the city was officially moved to the banks of the Guapay Empero river and renamed San Lorenzo de la Frontera. Nevertheless, the conditions proved to be even more severe at the new location forcing the settlers to relocate once again on May 21, 1595. Although this was the final relocation of the city, the name San Lorenzo continued to be used until the early 17th century, when the settlers who remained behind in Santa Cruz de la Sierra were convinced by the colonial authorities to move to San Lorenzo. After they moved the city was finally consolidated in 1622 and took its original name of Santa Cruz de la Sierra given by Ñuflo de Chaves over 60 years before. Remnants of the original settlement can be visited in Santa Cruz la Vieja (&quot;Old Santa Cruz&quot;), an archaeological site south of San José de Chiquitos.

===Colonial Santa Cruz and revolutionary war===

Over the next 200 years, several tribes were either incorporated under Spanish control or defeated by force. The city also became an important staging point for Jesuit missions to Chiquitos and Moxos, leading to the conversion of thousands of Guaranies, Moxeños, Chiquitanos, Guarayos and Chiriguanos that eventually became part of the racially mixed population of the modern Santa Cruz, Beni, Pando and Tarija departments of Bolivia. Another important role the small town played in the region for the Spanish Empire was to contain the incursions of Portuguese Bandeirantes, many of which were repelled by the use of force over the years.
The efforts for consolidating the borders of the Empire were not overlooked by the authorities in Lima, who granted the province a great degree of autonomy. The province was ruled by a Captain General based in Santa Cruz, and, in turn, the city government was administered by two mayors and a council of four people. Citizens of Santa Cruz were exempt from all imperial taxes and the mita system used in the rest of the Viceroyalty of Peru was not practiced. However, in spite of its strategic importance, the city did not grow much in colonial times. Most of the economic activity was centered in the mining centers of the west and the main source of income of the city was agriculture.

Animosity towards imperial authorities began at the turn of the 18th century when the new system of intendencias reached the new world. The seat of government was taken away from the city and moved to Cochabamba, and many of the powers delegated by the viceroyalty were now in the hands of appointees of the crown. Like in many parts of Spanish America at the time, angered by the reforms the criollos saw as a threat to their way of life, and taking advantage of the Peninsular War, the local population, led by Antonio Vicente Seonane, revolted on September 24, 1810, overthrowing the governor delegate. A junta of local commanders took control of the government in his place. The revolutionaries, as it was the case with most of the revolts in Spanish America, remained loyal to the King of Spain, while repudiating the colonial authorities until after the end of the Peninsular War.

By 1813 the city was once again under imperial control. At this time, by order of General Manuel Belgrano, the revolutionary armies of Argentina sent a small force led by Ignacio Warnes to &quot;liberate&quot; Santa Cruz. After his successful campaign, he assumed control of the government of the city. In a little over a year Warnes was able to gather tremendous support from the population, enlisting criollos, mestizos and natives to the revolutionary army, and allying with the revolutionary leader of Vallegrande, Alvarez de Arenales, to defeat a strong imperial force in the Battle of Florida. This victory proved to be a serious blow to Spanish forces in the region. Nevertheless, two years after the victory of Florida, imperial forces launched a new offensive in the province led by Francisco Javier Aguilera. This campaign ended with the defeat and death of Ignacio Warnes and his forces in the Battle of Pari. Triumphant, Aguilera marched into the city with orders to quell the insurrection and reinstate the Spanish governor. This proved to be a very difficult task, with several revolutionary leaders, such as Jose Manuel &quot;Cañoto&quot; Baca and Jose Manuel Mercado, rising up in the coming years from the city itself and elsewhere in the province. These new leaders fought colonial authorities for seven years until they finally deposed the last Spanish governor, Manuel Fernando Aramburu, in February 1825 after news of the defeat of the imperial armies in the west had reached the city.

==Geography==

The city is located in the eastern part of Bolivia (17°45&#x27;, South, 63°14&#x27;, West) at around 400 m above sea level. It is part of the province of Andrés Ibáñez and the capital of the department of Santa Cruz. The city of Santa Cruz is located not far from the easternmost extent of the Andes Mountains and they are visible from some parts of the city.

===Climate===
The city has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;), with an average annual temperature around and all months above of . Santa Cruz is an example of the influence of continentality (reflecting the thermal amplitude) in the tropics, without the four well-defined seasons of the year but greater deviations of temperature than other places in the coast or island. Although the weather is generally very warm all year round, cold winds called &quot;surazos&quot; can blow in occasionally (particularly in the winter) from the Argentine pampas making the temperature drop considerably. The months of greatest rainfall are December and January. The average annual rainfall is .
Santa Cruz sits at the edge of the Codo de Arica, where winds are particularly strong in Bolivia. Annual variations in temperature and precipitation are common, as is the case across much of the region. Annual precipitation in recent history has varied between .

==Demographics==

The city of Santa Cruz is, besides being the largest city in Bolivia, the one with the greatest mestizo and Creole identity, and with a smaller indigenous population. The first settlers of Santa Cruz were mainly the Native Chane people of East Bolivia followed by the Spaniards that accompanied Ñuflo de Chávez, as well as Guarani natives from Paraguay, and other native American groups that previously lived there working for the Spanish crown. Eventually, the Spanish settlers and native people of Bolivia began to mix which has resulted in the majority of the city population being mestizo. When the Spanish settlers arrived to Bolivia, Catholicism, as well as the Spanish language, were implemented onto the natives which is now why the city is predominantly Catholic and speak Spanish. Nevertheless, native religions and languages are still used by a minority of the population.

There was a distinction between the ethno-demographic profile of the Santa Cruz de la Sierra region, marked by the mestizo, Spanish and eastern indigenous presence, in relation to the population of the Bolivian Altiplano, western part of the country mostly Andean indigenous with a smaller mestizo and Spanish presence. However, in the last 60 years, large migrations from the western regions of Bolivia to Santa Cruz have transformed the demographics of the city and department redefining its social and ethnic spectrum. In recent years, external migration has also become noticeable in Santa Cruz. Immigrants in Bolivia, especially in Santa Cruz have mainly originated from Argentina, Brazil, Spain, Peru, United States and Mexico.

==Economy==

The city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra has utility infrastructure, roads and highways, and lively shopping and businesses. The main sectors that drive the economy are oil, forestry companies, agribusiness, and construction. Santa Cruz contributes more than 80% of national agricultural production, and also has contributed over 35% of GDP in recent years. 

Santa Cruz de la Sierra is served by Bolivia&#x27;s largest airport, the Viru Viru International Airport, with service on 14 airlines, 10 of which are from other countries, and 12 of them being passenger ones and two being cargo-only airlines. The airline AeroSur had its headquarters in Santa Cruz. The airline ceased operations in May 2012 and has been replaced by Boliviana de Aviación, which flies from Santa Cruz to Miami, Madrid, São Paulo, Buenos Aires and Lima. 

It was formerly linked with the Brazilian railway system through a line to Corumbá, Brazil. This line, which was reputed to have a poor safety record, was abandoned after a highway to the Brazilian border was built in the 1980s.

Bolivia&#x27;s largest shopping mall, the Ventura Mall is located in the city of Santa Cruz.

==Sports==
Two of Bolivia&#x27;s biggest football clubs are located in Santa Cruz de la Sierra: Club Blooming and Oriente Petrolero. Both teams currently play in the Bolivian Primera División. The match between the two, known as the Clásico Cruceño, is one of the fiercest rivalries in Bolivia. Each team has won 5 national titles.

Other football teams in Santa Cruz include Destroyers, Real Santa Cruz, Royal Pari, and Universidad Cruceña.

The main stadium in Santa Cruz is Estadio Ramón Tahuichi Aguilera. The stadium hosted several matches of the 1997 Copa America including one of the semi-finals.

<text>William Bruce Davis (born January 13, 1938) is a Canadian actor, best known for his role as the Cigarette Smoking Man on &quot;The X-Files&quot;. Besides appearing in many TV programs and movies, he founded his own acting school, the William Davis Centre for Actors Study. In his personal life, he is an avid water-skier, lectures on skepticism at events such as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry&#x27;s CSICon, and advocates for action on climate change. In 2011 he published his memoir, &quot;Where There&#x27;s Smoke ... The Musings of a Cigarette Smoking Man&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Davis was born in Toronto to a lawyer father and psychologist mother. In 1949, he began his acting career as a child, in radio drama and summer stock theatre. His cousins Murray and Donald Davis ran the Straw Hat Players in Ontario in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and rehearsed in the basement of Davis&#x27;s house. When they needed a boy, they gave William his first professional acting job. He subsequently became a boy actor on Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) radio before his voice broke. 

In 1955 he enrolled at the University of Toronto to study philosophy, but actively pursued an acting career, as did his friend Donald Sutherland. In 1959, he graduated from the University of Toronto with a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy. While at university he switched his attention from acting to directing and with his partner, Karl Jaffary, ran the Straw Hat Players for four years.

== Career ==
In 1960, Davis went to England to train at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. He worked in the UK for the next five years directing in repertory theatres and acting schools. He was artistic director of the Dundee Repertory Theatre. His last position in the UK was as an assistant director at the National Theatre of Great Britain under Laurence Olivier where he worked with Albert Finney, Maggie Smith, Derek Jacobi, and Ronald Pickup among others. 

In 1965, he returned to Canada to work at the National Theatre School of Canada. At the age of 28, was appointed artistic director of the English acting section. During this period he was also active as a freelance director at major Canadian theatres. In 1971, he joined the newly formed drama department at Bishop&#x27;s University in Lennoxvile, Quebec. While there he became the founding artistic director of Festival Lennoxville, a professional summer theatre that ran for the next decade.

Returning to Toronto in the late seventies, Davis spent several years as a radio drama director and on the faculty of Humber College. In demand as an acting teacher during this period, he resumed acting after an absence of nearly 20 years. He earned a number of roles on stage and film before accepting the position of artistic director of the Vancouver Playhouse Acting School, which required relocating with his wife and family. Davis writes in his memoir, &quot;And so, in the fall of 1985, we hitched our second hand boat to our second hand car and drove across the country.&quot;

While his time at the Vancouver Playhouse was short-lived, he remained in Vancouver, where he founded his own acting school, the William Davis Centre for Actors Study, a training ground for several future stars including New Zealand actress Lucy Lawless. Acting roles became more frequent, leading up to his iconic role as the Cigarette Smoking Man, also called the &quot;Cancer Man&quot;, on the hit TV series &quot;The X-Files&quot;, where he made frequent appearances for the next nine years. Davis has also had a wide range of roles in other series, including &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Smallville,&quot; and has participated in a host of television movies and other projects. From time to time he attends fan conventions, signing autographs and copies of his memoir.

In recent years Davis has returned to directing theatre and film. He wrote and directed three short films, and co-wrote and directed several episodes of a television series for CBC Television, &quot;49th &amp; Main&quot;. In 2011, he directed two plays for The United Players of Vancouver: &quot;Waste&quot; by Harley Granville Barker, and &quot;Hay Fever&quot; by Noël Coward. Most recently he directed &quot;The Habit of Art&quot; (2013) by Alan Bennett, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; &quot;and the Case of the Jersey Lily (2015)&quot; by Katie Forgette, and Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;A Man for All Seasons&quot; at the Jericho Arts Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia.

During that period, he appeared in 10 episodes of the Canadian hit show &quot;Continuum&quot; as Older Alec Sadler on Showcase. Most recently, he reprised his iconic &quot;X-Files&quot; role in the six-episode Season 10.[17]

== Personal life ==
Despite being known for his smoking character, Davis quit smoking in the 1970s. When &quot;The X-Files&quot; started, he was given a choice between herbal cigarettes and tobacco cigarettes. At first he chose to use tobacco, but switched to herbal because he feared becoming addicted to them again. He used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. 

In 2014, he donated his investments that supported fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation, in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. He is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believing it a critical issue of our time and speaking on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, he drives a Tesla.

He is a former national champion water skier and for a time held records in older age divisions. In a 2008 conversation with Brendan Beiser, he said he held the record for tricks in his age category, adding: &quot;I did hold the slalom record until this past year until some young whippersnapper of 65 from Ontario took the record away from me.&quot;

In 2011, Davis married Emmanuelle Herpin. He has two daughters, Melinda and Rebecca, from an earlier marriage, and two grandchildren.

== Skepticism ==

While on &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Davis was constantly challenged by fans of the show about his non-belief in the paranormal and aliens. Davis credits Barry Beyerstein and the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSI) for introducing him to the skeptic community. Davis became increasingly involved in the skeptic movement and began to give lectures as a skeptic spokesman at universities across North America and at skeptic conventions, including CSI&#x27;s CSICon in New Orleans.

When asked about his belief in the paranormal at the London Film and Comic Con in 2010, Davis replied, &quot;The onus is on you to prove the extraordinary ... I did a lot of research and saw where a lot of the arguments were wanting.&quot;

Interviewed by Jacob Fortin on guilt about being a sceptic, yet acting in a show that Richard Dawkins campaigned against, Davis replied that at first he had some trepidation until realizing that Dawkins &quot;had no evidence whatsoever and presented none&quot; that the show encouraged people to think uncritically. &quot;The show is fiction ... it isn&#x27;t a documentary.&quot; In another interview with Justin Trottier of the Centre for Inquiry Canada, Davis answered similarly, adding that from his own informal polls of audiences of &quot;X-Files&quot; fans, it seemed there was no greater belief in the paranormal than the normal population, and he comforted himself with this thought.

Asked about a debate Davis moderated with alien abduction believer John E. Mack, Davis said that many people expected him to support Mack, but they discovered that he was &quot;way on the other side&quot;. Davis recounted that he had some great discussions with Mack; &quot;He was brilliant ... he was wrong, but he was very good ... One of the problems with human intelligence is that we are so good at defending ideas that we arrived at irrationally.&quot;

In 2002, Davis narrated a Discovery Science Channel docuseries, &quot;The Critical Eye&quot;. Produced in association with &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot; magazine, the series examined pseudoscientific and paranormal phenomena.

<doc id="673995" wikidata="Q3176144" url="?curid=673995" title="Sengaku-ji">
<text>is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Sōtō school of Japanese Zen located in the Takanawa neighborhood of Minato-ku, near Sengakuji Station and Shinagawa Station, Tokyo, Japan. It was one of the three major Sōtō temples in Edo during the Tokugawa shogunate, and became famous through its connection with the Akō incident of the forty-seven Rōnin in the 18th century.

== History ==
Sengaku-ji was founded as a small chapel by founding &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1612 and was initially located in Sotosakura, near modern Kasumigaseki. After it was destroyed in the &quot;Kan&#x27;ei&quot; Fire of 1641, third &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Iemitsu ordered the five &quot;daimyō&quot; clans of Mori, Asano, Kutsuki, Niwa and Mizutani to rebuild the temple at its present location in Takanawa, but on a much larger scale.

As this temple became the Edo &quot;bodaiji&quot; for the Asano clan, after the &quot;seppuku&quot; Asano Takumi-no-Kami Naganori for having broken protocol and drawing a sword in the Edo Castle, his funeral and tomb were located here. In 1702, the forty-seven Rōnin led by Ōishi Kuranosuke avenged his death and assassinated Kira Kōzuke-no-suke Yoshinaka. After parading Kira&#x27;s severed head through Edo, they washed it at a well at the temple and presented it on the altar in front of Asano&#x27;s tomb. They then surrendered to the authorities and were subsequently ordered by the Shōgun to commit &quot;seppuku&quot;. Their tombs were built at Sengaku-ji next to that of their master. This story became famous through the Kabuki epic &quot;Chūshingura&quot; and their graves became a popular site of pilgrimage. The graves of Asano Naganori and of the &quot;47 &quot;Rōnin&quot;&quot; were designated a National Historic Site in 1922. Each year on 14 December, the temple holds a festival commemorating the 47 &quot;Rōnin&quot;. The temple maintains a museum displaying the personal belongings of the 47 &quot;Rōnin&quot; and displays on the events of the Akō incident.

The temple also has the graves of Asano Naganori&#x27;s widow, Yozen-in (1674-1714) and his younger Asano Nagahiro (1670-1734) who was allowed by the Shogunate to re-establish the Asano clan as a &quot;hatamoto&quot;. With regards to the graves of the &quot;47 &quot;Rōnin&quot;&quot;, there are actually 48 graves, as the grave of Kayano Shigezane (also known as &quot;Sanpei&quot;) is included in their number. Kayano was one of the Asano &quot;ronin&quot;, but committed suicide before the vendetta took place.

<text>Howard Roger Garis ( – ) was an American author, best known for a series of books that featured the character of Uncle Wiggily Longears, an engaging elderly rabbit. Many of his books were illustrated by Lansing Campbell. Garis and his wife, Lilian Garis, were possibly the most prolific children&#x27;s authors of the early 20th century.

== Biography ==
Garis was born in Binghamton, New York. He and his spouse Lilian Garis both worked as reporters for the &quot;Newark Evening News&quot;. He did some work on the side for WNJR also in Newark.

===&quot;Uncle Wiggily&quot;===
The first &quot;Uncle Wiggily&quot; story appeared January 10, 1910, in the &quot;Newark News&quot;. For almost four decades the newspaper published an &quot;Uncle Wiggily&quot; story by Garis every day except Sunday, and the series was eventually nationally syndicated. By the time Garis retired from the newspaper in 1947, he had written more than 11,000 &quot;Uncle Wiggily&quot; stories.

In 1916 Milton Bradley began selling the &quot;Uncle Wiggily Game&quot;. In 1987 Parker Brothers bought the rights to the board game and produced it for many years. As of 2018 Winning Moves was manufacturing the &quot;Uncle Wiggily Game&quot;.

===Stratemeyer Syndicate===
Garis wrote many books for the Stratemeyer Syndicate under various pseudonyms. As Victor Appleton, he wrote about the enterprising Tom Swift; as Laura Lee Hope, he is generally credited with writing volumes 4–28 and 41 of the Bobbsey Twins; as Clarence Young, the Motor Boys series; as Lester Chadwick, the Baseball Joe series; and as Marion Davidson, a number of books including several featuring the Camp Fire Girls. The couple&#x27;s children also wrote for Stratemeyer.

After Edward Stratemeyer&#x27;s death in May 1930, his two daughters, Harriet Stratemeyer Adams (1892–1982) and Edna C. Squier (1895–1974), ran the company, with the result that Garis stopped writing for the Syndicate in 1933 after several disagreements.

=== Death ===
Garis moved to Amherst, Massachusetts in 1950, and died there in 1962.

==Biographies==
Garis&#x27; son, Roger Garis, penned a biography of the writing Garis family &quot;My Father Was Uncle Wiggily&quot; (McGraw-Hill, 1966), as well as writing several books under his own name and pseudonyms, including a four-volume series of children&#x27;s adventures/mysteries for A. L. Burt. His daughter, Cleo F. also wrote a three-volume series of children&#x27;s mysteries, published by A. L. Burt. His granddaughter, Leslie Garis, wrote a more revealing Garis family memoir, &quot;The House of Happy Endings&quot; (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2007).

<text>Hūsker Dū? is a memory board game that can be played by children and adults, published in the United States in the 1950s. The game is currently published in the United States by Winning Moves Games USA.

==Game play==
The game board consists of a surface with holes in it, laid on top of a dial that contains several sets of small pictures. The holes are covered by markers at the start of the game, and the dial is rotated to line up one set of positions with the holes. On each turn, a player removes two markers to reveal the pictures underneath. If they do not match, the player replaces the markers and their turn ends. If the pictures do match, the player keeps the two markers and takes another turn. Once the board is cleared, the player holding the most markers is the winner.

==Marketing==
The American version of the board game was first distributed in the 1950s by the Pressman Toy Corporation. The boxed game proclaimed itself one &quot;in which the child can outwit the adult.&quot;

A notorious advertisement for the game that aired during the 1973 Christmas season featured subliminal cuts, with the phrase &quot;Get It.&quot; Even though subliminal messages are commonly believed to be ineffective, the FCC received complaints about the ad and issued a public notice calling subliminal advertising &quot;deceptive and contrary to the public interest.&quot; The Premium Corporation of America voluntarily removed the commercial from the air, claiming that the subliminal message was inserted by a misguided employee.

Another early ad featured a voiceover by professional-wrestling announcer &quot;Mean Gene&quot; Okerlund.

<doc id="674005" wikidata="Q73430" url="?curid=674005" title="Black-naped monarch">
<text>The black-naped monarch or black-naped blue flycatcher (Hypothymis azurea) is a passerine bird belonging to the family of monarch flycatchers found in southern and south-eastern Asia. They are sexually dimorphic, with the male having a distinctive black patch on the back of the head and a narrow black half collar (&quot;necklace&quot;), while the female is duller with olive brown wings and lacking the black markings on the head. They have a call that is similar to that of the Asian paradise flycatcher, and in tropical forest habitats, pairs may join mixed-species foraging flocks. Populations differ slightly in plumage colour and sizes.

==Taxonomy==
The black-naped monarch was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1779 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot;. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Muscicapa azurea&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. Buffon specified that his specimen had been collected in the Philippines, and in 1939 the American ornithologist James L. Peters restricted the type locality to Manila on the island of Luzon. The black-naped monarch is now placed in the genus &quot;Hypothymis&quot; was introduced by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1826 with the black-naped monarch as the type species. The genus name is from the Ancient Greek &quot;hupothumis&quot;, the name of an unidentified bird mentioned by the playwright Aristophanes. The specific epithet &quot;azurea&quot; is from the Medieval Latin &quot;azureus&quot; meaning &quot;azure-coloured&quot; or &quot;azure-blue&quot;.

Alternate names for the black-naped monarch include black-naped blue monarch and black-naped monarch flycatcher. Some authorities separate two former subspecies, &quot;H. a. blasii&quot; (Banggai Island) and &quot;H. a. puella&quot; (Sulawesi), and place them as subspecies of the pale-blue monarch (&quot;Hypothymis puella&quot;).

===Subspecies===
Twenty-three subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;H. a. styani&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Ficedula&quot;, found from India and Nepal to southeast China and Vietnam. The abdomen is whitish in males.
* &quot;H. a. oberholseri&quot; – : Found in Taiwan
* &quot;H. a. ceylonensis&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species, found in Sri Lanka. The males lack the black necklace.
* &quot;H. a. tytleri&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Myiagra&quot;. Found in the Andaman Islands. The abdomen of males is blue.
* &quot;H. a. idiochroa&quot; – : Found on Car Nicobar (northern Nicobar Islands). The abdomen of males is white tinged with blue.
* &quot;H. a. nicobarica&quot; – : Found on southern Nicobar Islands. The abdomen of males is white tinged with blue.
* &quot;H. a. montana&quot; – : Found in northern and central Thailand
* &quot;H. a. galerita&quot; – : Found in southwest and southeast Thailand
* &quot;H. a. forrestia&quot; – : Found in Mergui Archipelago (off western Myanmar)
* &quot;H. a. prophata&quot; – : Found on Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo
* &quot;H. a. javana&quot; – : Found on Java and Bali (Indonesia)
* &quot;H. a. penidae&quot; – : Found on Nusa Penida (near Bali in the Lesser Sundas)
* &quot;H. a. karimatensis&quot; – : Found on Karimata Island (off western Borneo)
* &quot;H. a. opisthocyanea&quot; – : Found on Anambas Islands (in the South China Sea)
* &quot;H. a. gigantoptera&quot; – : Found on Natuna Besar (Natuna Islands, South China Sea)
* &quot;H. a. consobrina&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species, found on Simeulue (off north-western Sumatra)
* &quot;H. a. leucophila&quot; – : Found on Siberut (off western Sumatra)
* &quot;H. a. richmondi&quot; – : Found on Enggano Island (off south-western Sumatra)
* &quot;H. a. abbotti&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species, found on Reusam and Babi Islands (off north-western Sumatra)
* &quot;H. a. symmixta&quot; – : Found on western and central Lesser Sundas
* &quot;H. a. azurea&quot; (Philippine black-naped monarch) – : Also known as the black-capped monarch and Philippine black-naped blue monarch. Found in Philippines (except Camiguin Sur Island)
* &quot;H. a. aeria&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species, found on Maratua Island (off eastern Borneo)
* &quot;H. a. catarmanensis&quot; – : Found on Camiguin Sur Island (southern Philippines)

==Description==

The adult male black-naped monarch is about 16 cm long, and is mainly pale azure blue apart from a whitish lower belly. It has a black nape and a narrow black gorget. The female is duller and lacks the black markings. Its wings and back are grey-brown. However, several geographically separated breeding populations differ in the extent and shade of markings. The Indian peninsula has subspecies &quot;H. a. styani&quot; (which subsumes &quot;H. a. sykesi&quot; of Stuart Baker), in which males have very distinct black markings and a whitish abdomen. Males of the Sri Lankan race &quot;H. a. ceylonensis&quot; lack the black nape and gorget and the shade is more purplish. The subspecies of the Andaman Islands, &quot;H. a. tytleri&quot;, has the underparts blue grey. The form on Car Nicobar Island, &quot;H. a. idiochroa&quot;, has a greyish white belly, while &quot;H. a. nicobarica&quot; from the southern Nicobars has a smaller and finer bill. The colour of the gape is yellowish to green.

The black-naped monarch&#x27;s calls are a sharp and abrupt &quot;skrip&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-naped monarch breeds across tropical southern Asia from Iran and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and the Philippines. This species is usually found in thick forests and other well-wooded habitats.

The main breeding season in India is in summer from May to July. Two to three eggs are laid in a cup nest placed in the fork of a tree. The nest is decorated with spider-egg cases.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The black-naped monarch has short legs and sits very upright whilst perched prominently, like a shrike. It is insectivorous, often hunting by flycatching. When alarmed or alert, the nape feathers are raised into a pointed crest. They join mixed-species foraging flocks, being among the most significant members of such flocks in the Western Ghats, and are active in the understory of forest canopies. A study in Sri Lanka showed that they are affected by human disturbance causing them to recede from disturbed edges by about 75 m.

Although they are largely residents, local seasonal movements are known. The breeding season in India is March to August and the nest is a neat cup placed in a fork. The cup is lined with filaments of webbing and fungi including those of the genus &quot;Marasmius&quot; which are known to produce antibiotics and may benefit the birds by protecting the young from infection. The nest is built by the female while the male guards. The typical clutch is three eggs, which both parents incubate and both feed the young, which hatch after about 12 days.

The webs of large spiders, such as &quot;Nephila maculata&quot;, have been known to trap the bird. An astrovirus was detected in a black-naped monarch in Cambodia, a virus that was earlier unknown from passerines. The feather mite &quot;Proterothrix hypothymis&quot; (Pterodectinae: Protophyllodidae) has been described from black-naped monarchs in Vietnam.

<text>Roy Rockwood was a house pseudonym used by Edward Stratemeyer and the Stratemeyer Syndicate for boy&#x27;s adventure books. The name is most well-remembered for the &quot;Bomba the Jungle Boy&quot; series.

== Series ==
The following series used the Roy Rockwood pseudonym:
*Deep Sea (1905–1908; the three books in the series were republished as the first three Dave Fearless books)
*Dave Fearless (1905–1927)
*Great Marvel (1906–1935)
*Speedwell Boys (1913–1915)
*Dave Dashaway (1913–1915)
*Bomba, the Jungle Boy (1926–1938)

Edward Stratemeyer used the pseudonym for the serialized story &quot;Joe Johnson, the Bicycle Wonder&quot; (1895), published in &quot;Young Sports of America&quot;. He also used Roy Rockwood for &quot;Lost in the Land of Ice&quot; (1900-1901 – later published as a book under the Capt. Ralph Bonehill pen name) and &quot;The Rival Ocean Divers&quot; (1901), both serialized in &quot;Golden Hours&quot;. &quot;The Rival Ocean Divers&quot; became the first book in the &quot;Deep Sea&quot; series, and was later used in the &quot;Dave Fearless&quot; series.

==Known authors==
The Dave Dashaway series was written by Weldon J. Cobb. Howard R. Garis contributed to the Great Marvel series. In 1926 Leslie McFarlane was hired to write a Dave Fearless novel. John Duffield wrote many of the Bomba, the Jungle Boy novels.

<doc id="674021" wikidata="Q1591229" url="?curid=674021" title="White-throated fantail">
<text>The white-throated fantail (Rhipidura albicollis) is a small passerine bird. It is found in forest, scrub and cultivation across tropical southern Asia from the Himalayas, India and Bangladesh east to Indonesia. The white-spotted fantail (&quot;R. albogularis&quot;) until recently was considered a subspecies.

==Description==
The adult white-throated fantail is about long. It has a dark fan-shaped tail, edged in white, and white supercilium and throat. There is otherwise much variation in plumage between races. Most resemble the Himalayan R. a. canescans, which is primarily slate grey above and below, featuring a black eye mask, and a white throat and eyebrow.

Local names for the bird in India include &quot;Nasoni sorai&quot; (Assamese).

==Behaviour==
The white-throated fantail lays three eggs in a small cup nest in a tree. It is insectivorous, and often fans its tail as it moves through the undergrowth.

The eggs are approximately in length. They are white in colour, with a band of brown spots around the middle, closer towards the base of the egg. 

Birds use the same song year after year, with progressively small changes, with the result that the song sounds very different after 4–5 years. The male&#x27;s call is a valuable tool in detection and identification of the bird, which can often be confused with the white-browed fantail, &quot;R. aureola&quot;, where their ranges overlap. &quot;R. aureola&quot; has light underparts and prominent spots in two rows on the wings.

== Subspecies ==
According to IOC there are 9 recognised subspecies. In alphabetical order, these are:

* &quot;R. a. albicollis&quot; (Vieillot, 1818)
* &quot;R. a. atrata&quot; Salvadori, 1879
* &quot;R. a. canescens&quot; (Koelz, 1939)
* &quot;R. a. celsa&quot; Riley, 1929
* &quot;R. a. cinerascens&quot; Delacour, 1927
* &quot;R. a. kinabalu&quot; Chasen, 1941
* &quot;R. a. orissae&quot; Ripley, 1955
* &quot;R. a. sarawacensis&quot; Chasen, 1941
* &quot;R. a. stanleyi&quot; Baker, 1916

<doc id="674024" wikidata="Q899363" url="?curid=674024" title="Papier-mâché">
<text>Papier-mâché ( , , - the French term &quot;mâché&quot; here means &quot;crushed and ground&quot;) is a versatile craft technique with roots in ancient China, in which waste paper is shredded and mixed with water and a binder to produce a pulp ideal for modelling or moulding, which dries to a hard surface and allows the creation of light, strong and inexpensive objects of any shape, even very complicated ones. There are various recipes, including those using cardboard and some mineral elements such as chalk or clay (carton-pierre, a building material). Papier-mâché reinforced with textiles or boiled cardboard (carton bouilli) can be used for durable, sturdy objects. There is even carton-cuir (cardboard and leather) There is also a &quot;laminating process&quot;, a method in which strips of paper are glued together in layers. Binding agents include glue, starch or wallpaper paste. &quot;Carton-paille&quot; or strawboard was already described in a book in 1881. Pasteboard is made of whole sheets of paper glued together, or layers of paper pulp pressed together. Millboard is a type of strong pasteboard that contains old rope and other coarse materials in addition to paper.

This composite material can be used in a variety of traditional and ceremonial activities, as well as in arts and crafts, for example to make many different inexpensive items such as Christmas decorations (including nativity figures), toys or masks, or models for educational purposes, or even pieces of furniture, and is ideal for large-scale production; Carton-pierre can be used to make decorative architectural elements, sculptures and statues, or theatre or film sets; papier-mâché has also been used to make household objects, which can become valuable if artistically painted (as many boxes and snuffboxes were in the past) or lacquered, sometimes with inlays of mother-of-pearl, for example. Large papier-mâché pieces, such as statues or carnival floats, require a wooden (or bamboo, etc.) frame. Making papier-mâché is also a popular pastime, especially with children.

==Preparation methods==

There are two methods to prepare papier-mâché. The first method makes use of paper strips glued together with adhesive, and the other uses paper pulp obtained by soaking or boiling paper to which glue is then added.

With the first method, a form for support is needed on which to glue the paper strips. With the second method, it is possible to shape the pulp directly inside the desired form. In both methods, reinforcements with wire, chicken wire, lightweight shapes, balloons or textiles may be needed.

The traditional method of making papier-mâché adhesive is to use a mixture of water and flour or other starch, mixed to the consistency of heavy cream. Other adhesives can be used if thinned to a similar texture, such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA) based glues (often sold as wood glue or craft glue). Adding oil of cloves or other preservatives, such as salt, to the mixture reduces the chances of the product developing mold. Methyl cellulose is a naturally mold free adhesive used in a ratio of one part powder to 16 parts hot water and is a popular choice because it is non-toxic, but is not waterproof.

For the paper strips method, the paper is cut or torn into strips, and soaked in the paste until saturated. The saturated pieces are then placed onto the surface and allowed to dry slowly. The strips may be placed on an &quot;armature&quot;, or skeleton, often of wire mesh over a structural frame, or they can be placed on an object to create a cast. Oil or grease can be used as a release agent if needed. Once dried, the resulting material can be cut, sanded and/or painted, and waterproofed by painting with a suitable water-repelling paint. Before painting any product of papier-mâché, the glue must be fully dried, otherwise mold will form and the product will rot from the inside out.

For the pulp method, the paper is left in water at least overnight to soak, or boiled in abundant water until the paper breaks down to a pulp. The excess water is drained, an adhesive is added and the papier-mâché applied to a form or, especially for smaller or simpler objects, sculpted to shape.

== History ==
=== Imperial China ===

The Chinese during the Han dynasty appeared to be the first to use papier-mâché around 200 CE, not long after they learned how to make paper. They employed the technique to make items such as warrior helmets, mirror cases, or ceremonial masks.

=== Ancient Egypt ===

In ancient Egypt, coffins and death masks were often made from cartonnage—layers of papyrus or linen covered with plaster.

=== Middle and Far East ===

In Persia, papier-mâché has been used to manufacture small painted boxes, trays, étagères and cases. Japan and China also produced laminated paper articles using papier-mâché. In Japan and India, papier-mâché was used to add decorative elements to armor and shields.

In Persia, from the 16th century onwards, papier-mâché bookbindings were preferred to leather ones because the paint held better on the paper. This continued at least into the Qajar period, particularly in Tabriz and Isfahan. The Louvre owns a leather and papier-mâché board with a painted scene, and a later papier-mâché board with lacquered or varnished birds and flowers. They also made scientific instruments like a celestial globe known as the Kugel globe (1694 / 1726) in painted, gilded and varnished papier-mâché on a wooden core. Other papier-mâché items in the Louvre include a pencil box with floral decoration (1880 / 1890, Tabriz), a lacquered writing case (1900) and a half-moon mirror box with a typical &quot;&quot; decoration (1850 / 1900).

In Japan, Sendai hariko involves creating papier-mâché figurines of animals like tigers or rabbits, and Daruma dolls. Traditionally, Sendai hariko figures were gifted as toys and talismans to protect children or bring good luck. The word &quot;hariko&quot; refers to objects made from &quot;kami&quot; (paper) and &quot;kiji&quot; (wooden moulds), which are layered with papier-mâché, dried, and then painted by hand.

=== Kashmir ===
The papier-mâché technique was first adopted in Kashmir in the 14th century by Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani, a Sufi mystic, who came to Kashmir during the late 14th century along with his followers, many of whom were craftsmen. These craftsmen used hand-made paper pulp from Iran. Kashmir papier-mâché has been used to manufacture boxes (small and big), bowls, trays, étagères, useful and decorative items, models, birds and animals, vases, lights, corporate gifts and lot more. It remains highly marketed in India and Pakistan and is a part of the luxury ornamental handicraft market. The product is protected under the Geographic Indication Act 1999 of Indian government, and was registered by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks during the period from April 2011 to March 2012 under the title &quot;Kashmir Paper Machie&quot;.

The Shah Hamdan Mosque in Srinagar, one of the city&#x27;s oldest mosques, is celebrated for its intricate papier-mâché work on the walls and ceilings. Similarly, the Shalimar Bagh, a garden created by Mughal Emperor Jahangir, and dubbed the &quot;Versailles of Mughal Emperors,&quot; features a papier-mâché ceiling in its central pavilion that has lasted nearly 400 years.
Papier-mâché, a popular Kashmiri craft, originated in the 15th century when King Zain-ul-Abidin invited papier-mâché artists from Central Asia. Prior to this, vibrant patterns had been painted on wood, used in items like ceiling panels and furniture.

In recent years, there has been a decline in the number of artisans engaged in Kashmiri papier-mâché due to economic challenges and a lack of sustainable income. However, local craftsmen continue to keep the tradition alive by integrating contemporary designs while preserving traditional methods

=== Ladakh === 
In Ladakh, papier-mâché with paper pulp mixed with clay, cotton, flour, and glue, is used to create brightly colored masks depicting deities and spirits, essential in monastery mystery plays. This technique is also used to make statues for monasteries.

=== Europe ===

====Italy====
Originating in Asia, papier-mâché reached Europe in the 15th century, where it was first used for bas-reliefs and nativity figures. By incorporating some mineral elements, artisans were able to make copies of traditional statues for devotional use, which gained popularity after the Counter-Reformation. New devotional practices rested on faithful copies of particularly venerated images reproduced in series in stucco or in papier-mâché, such as Lorenzo Ghiberti&#x27;s Madonnas, or Donatello&#x27;s (c. 1386-1466) bas-relief of the Virgin and Child, known as the &quot;Madonna of Verona&quot; (Louvre, RF 589, 1450 / 1500 polychrome cartapesta ). Jacopo Sansovino also used papier-mâché, for example in his bas-relief &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; (polychrome cartapesta, c.1550, Louvre: RF 746). Another &quot;Virgin and Child&quot; (with two putti) is attributed to Sansovino (1532, found in Venice, soon to be exhibited at the Ca&#x27; d&#x27;Oro). The Museo Nazionale d&#x27;Abruzzo has a Saint Jerome (c.1567-1569, polychrome papier-mâché) by Pompeo Cesura.

Baroque culture in Italy embraced papier-mâché, fostering devotion among the faithful through vivid religious imagery. In Bologna, in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, with sculptors such as Mazza (Giuseppe Maria Mazza), his pupil Angelo Piò and , papier-mâché flourished. In the nineteenth century, Emilia-Romagna once again took over with the famous workshops in Faenza of and his sons and and the followers of and Graziani, and the workshop of Gaetano Vitené and his successors, and the latest specialists of cartapesta: Enrico dal Monte and his son Gaetano dal Monte (1916-2006).

Early examples of Italian cartapasta seem to include mostly bas-reliefs. For example, there are many copies in cartapasta of Benedetto da Maiano&#x27;s &quot;Madonna &#x27;del Latte&quot; (Nursing Madonna), the earliest ones attributed to his workshop, but some others dating from the early 17th century. Some were made in Tuscany, such as a polychrome papier-mâché of &quot;The Deposition of Christ&quot; with a papier-mâché Christ on a wooden cross. Another papier-mâché bas-relief representing &quot;The Beheading of Saint Paul&quot; was inspired by Alessandro Algardi, who worked almost exclusively in Rome.

The Louvre owns two very different pieces dating from the very end of the 17th century: a celestial globe (1693 signed &#x27;Coronelli&#x27;: SN 878 ; SN 340) and an earth globe (1697 signed &#x27;Coronelli&#x27;, &#x27;P. Vincenzo, Venice&#x27;: OA 10683 A)

In the 18th century, cartapesta also developed in Lecce (Puglia), where it remains a speciality. The Castle of Charles V houses the Museo della Cartapesta. Religious bas-reliefs in papier-mâché were still in vogue, but a man like Giacomo Colombo, who seems to have worked mainly in Naples, made a high-relief &quot;Saint Paschal Baylón&quot; (c.1720) measuring 168 cm.

The places of production diversified: we know of a cartapesta &#x27;Jesus Christ Dead in the Tomb&#x27; made in Sicily. In Siena, cartapesta products also diversified, from painted and gilded papier-mâché cherubs to boxes, trays, shelves, wall lamps and more.

In the 19th century, new objects appeared, such as table centrepieces representing a pyramid of papier-mâché and glass fruits under a glass cloche, or views of Italy, probably made for tourists, such as one of &quot;il Colosseo ed i Fori Imperiali&quot;. Pope Pius VII was crowned on 21 March 1800 (during the Marengo campaign), in Venice, wearing a papier-mâché papal tiara. Founded in 1802 by Giovanni Battista Paravia, Paravia Publishing dominated educational materials in Italian schools by the late 19th century, offering papier-mâché globes, anatomical models, and flower models along with many other things. Didactic papier-mâché models of flowers were also made by C. Luppi in Modena (1900-1930). Papier-mâché came to be used for carnival masks and floats, in Viareggio for example.

====England ====
In 1772, an English inventor, Henry Clay (apprenticed to John Baskerville in 1740 - died in 1812), patented a process for making laminated sheets of papier-mâché and treating them with linseed oil to produce waterproof panels. His technique &quot;involved pasting sheets of paper together and then oiling, varnishing and stove-hardening them. This process produced panels suitable for coaches, carriages, sedan chairs and furniture. It was claimed that the material could be ‘sawn, planed, dove-tailed or mitred in the same manner as if made in wood&quot;. Clay, japanner, was a supplier to the Royal Family. (It was probably in the 1660s that Thomas Allgood had pioneered the use of japanning on metal.)

Clay became a papier-mâché manufacturer in or before 1772 (until his death), first in Birmingham and then in London. When his patent expired in 1802 &quot;a number of rival producers set up including Jennens and Bettridge who opened up in 1816 in Henry Clay&#x27;s former Birmingham works&quot;. Theodore Jennens patented a process in 1847 for steaming and pressing laminated sheets into various shapes, which were then used to manufacture trays, chair backs, and structural panels, usually laid over a wood or metal armature for strength. The papier-mâché was smoothed and lacquered, or given a pearl-shell finish. The industry lasted through the 19th century. This made the material more durable and it could be moulded into objects that would otherwise be difficult to manufacture, such as
the globe of Jennens and Bettridge&#x27;s sewing table, and that could withstand greater wear and tear than traditional papier mâché such as &quot;teatrays, waiters, caddies and dressing cases … japanned and decorated with painted scenes and classical (Etruscan) and Chinoiserie subjects&quot;. Jennens and Betridge (London, Birmingham) made large tea caddies circa 1850. Other objects included cane holders, fruit bowls with mother-of-pearl inlays or papier mache head dolls by &quot;Childs &amp; Sons&quot;. The papier-mâché stags&#x27; heads in Powerscourt were German, though.

In the 18th century, papier-mâché (that could be gilded) had begun to appear as a low-cost alternative to similarly treated plaster or carved wood in architecture, even replacing stucco in ceilings and wall decorations. Some Italian craftsmen (and the painter Giuseppe Mattia Borgnis), were invited by Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer, around 1750 to work on St Lawrence&#x27;s Church, West Wycombe and West Wycombe Park, maybe importing carta pasta to England. Robert Adam soon embraced paper stucco for elaborate interiors.

By the 19th century, two London companies—Jackson and Son, founded by fondateur George Jackson, and Charles Frederick Bielefeld’s workshop—advanced papier-mâché’s architectural use. Jackson had previously worked for Robert Adam ; he established his firm in 1780, and it became one of the leading suppliers of decorative elements, particularly for ceilings, walls, and other architectural details, using plaster and papier-mâché. Jackson and Son won a gold medal at the 1878 Paris Exposition.
In the 1830s, Jacob Owen&#x27;s redesign of Dublin Castle featured papier-mâché work by Charles Frederick Bielefeld (1803–1864), known for his cornices and consoles at St James’s Palace. Bielefeld created papier-mâché ceiling roses, cornices, and Corinthian capitals for the castle, which were later reproduced in plaster after a fire in 1941. In 1846, Bielefeld patented large, robust papier-mâché panels that could be painted for ceiling and wall decorations, or used as cabin dividers in steamboats and train carriages as well as prefabricated homes. Bielefeld &quot;modelled, gilt and fixed&quot; the ornaments of papier mâché of the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane in 1847 (some of which were removed in 1851).

The popularity of papier-mâché declined as electroplating offered a cheaper metal-coated alternative. McCallum and Hodson (&quot;Summer-row, near the Town-hall, Birmingham&quot; ), the last papier-mâché company, closed in 1920.

Martin Travers, the English ecclesiastical designer, made much use of papier-mâché for his church furnishings in the 1920s, in St Mary&#x27;s, Bourne Street and St Augustine&#x27;s, Queen&#x27;s Gate, for example. Papier-mâché was still used in the 20th century, for George Philip &amp; son&#x27;s papier-mâché globes (1963) for example.

====A church in Norway====
 (1746-1822), a cartographer who also quarried marble and extracted lime, had his own farm workers build a large octagonal paper church known as &quot;Hop church&quot;, on his estate near Bergen in 1796. It was uniquely constructed using papier-mâché as a building material (a blend of waste paper, lime, and other natural ingredients) that could mimic the look of marble. described it: &quot;The supporting structures are made of stone, but the church is covered inside and out in papier-mâché. In each room of the farmhouse, also made of papier-mâché, there is a large stove, and these stoves are literally made of paper&quot;. Christie may have drawn inspiration from English papier-mâché techniques that he encountered on a trip to England. Unfortunately, the building deteriorated due to bad weather, and after Christie&#x27;s death, the new owner, Michael Krohn, demolished both the church and mansion in 1830. Today, only &#x27;s watercolour of &quot;The octagonal church at Wernersholm&quot; (1827) illustrates what the church once looked like.

====Germany====
The cartapesta expert Raffaele Casciaro states that the earliest use of papier-mâché (or &quot;Pappmaché&quot;) in Germany dates back to the first half of the 15th century, and he mentions a sculpture of the Virgin Mary that was part of a &quot;Vesperbild&quot; (or Pietà), by an anonymous German sculptor using stucco, pastiglia and cartapesta).

In the 16th century, the North German sculptor carved wooden moulds from which a plaster cast was made. These in turn were used to make multiple copies of papier-mâché Protestant images such as portraits of Martin Luther. There is an example in the Danish National Museum. and a portrait of Philip Melanchthon in the collection of the Staatliches Museum Schwerin.

Georg Heinrich (1717-1776) founded a ‘lacquerware factory’ in Braunschweig in 1763 together with his father Georg Siegmund Eustachius Stobwasser. Due to the high quality of the (papier-mâché, wood or metal) goods and the resulting high demand from the Brunswick court, court society, the military and the merchant class, the new ‘factory’ soon employed almost a hundred people and started selling its products nationally and internationally. They produced household items as well as luxury items. However, their main products were snuff boxes and tobacco pipes, in which even the meerschaum was replaced by papier-mâché. The snuffboxes were particularly popular - not least because of their sometimes erotic depictions, which were concealed under a false bottom. High-quality furniture was also produced for courts throughout Europe. The manufactory soon attracted a large number of highly qualified painters, such as the miniature painter Friedrich Georg Weitsch, who applied Stobwasser&#x27;s miniature motifs (including idealised, romantic landscapes, historical and mythological scenes based on Italian, French or Dutch models) to the objects. Paintings by , Pascha Johann Friedrich Weitsch and his son Friedrich Georg Weitsch, and Heinrich Brandes are also mentioned. King Frederick the Great tried to entice Stobwasser away to Berlin, but in 1772/73 only a branch office (the &#x27;Manufaktur für Lackwaren&#x27; ) was founded, specialising in the manufacture of lacquered lamps. The Brunswick headquarters closed down in 1863. Stobwasser Berlin transitioned to lighting fixture production, becoming, by 1900, one of Germany&#x27;s leading lamp manufacturers. The Braunschweig Municipal Museum has a large collection of ‘Stobwasser articles’.

In the late 18th century, Frederick II, Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, at the suggestion of one of his footmen, , considered using papier-mâché to redecorate Ludwigslust Palace. Bachmann became the first head of the Ludwigsluster Carton (papier-mâché) workshop, which initially produced capitals, ornemental mouldings, statues etc for the palace, its church, park, and nearby buildings such as . The entire interior decoration of the Golden Hall of Ludwigslust Palace, including the sconces, is made of papier-mâché. Later the workshop turned to the production of small furniture, vases, centrepieces, portrait busts, church decorations and other decorative objects, which were advertised in the Journal des Luxus und der Moden, among other publications, and sold throughout Europe.

Genuine Mauchline ware made in Scotland for the tourist market between the 1820s and 1900, notably hand-painted snuffboxes, was flooded out of the market by German-made imitations, some of them in papier-mâché rather than wood.

It is difficult to say when the first papier-mâché doll was made. The date 1540 is everywhere on the Internet, but it doesn&#x27;t refer to anything specific, except sometimes to a book by Édouard Fournier, in which he mentions doll makers using a &quot;terrible mixture of clay, paper and plaster&quot; before 1540, and suggests that doll makers used the same mixture when they worked as ornamentalists making cornice and ceiling ornaments in carton-pierre. But he only mentions &quot;un compte de 1540&quot; (probably in the sense of a report or an invoice). The date 1540 is also too early for carton-pierre. What we do know is that papier-mâché was used in the early 19th century, perhaps since the mid-18th century, in Nuremberg ( had a shop there and published his first mail-order catalog in 1793) and Sonneberg when they developed into world-renowned toy manufacturing centers. An important doll manufacturer in the last decades of the 19th century was , in Sonneberg. There was also Armand Marseille in Köppelsdorf, a district of Sonneberg, who from 1885 developed into one of the world&#x27;s largest suppliers of bisque porcelain doll heads, some of them at least with moving eyes and a papier-mâché body. Ernst Heubach&#x27;s doll heads could also be mounted on a papier-mâché body.

In the middle of the 19th century, another German, Ludwig Greiner (†1874) had emigrated to the United States of America and founded a papier-mâché doll manufacturing company in 1840. Doll heads (like globes) were moulded in two parts: &quot;For round objects, such as doll heads, for example, two molds are used, one for the front of the head, the other for the back; the two pieces of cardboard made in these different moulds are joined by bringing them together and gluing strips of strong paper over the joint. All that remained was to smooth the surface before painting and varnishing.

Many other toys were made of papier-mâché, such as puppets, or puppet heads, and all kinds of animals, pull toy dogs, rocking horses or horses on wheels, and even elephants on wheels 1910/1920

In 1900, Richard Mahr (1876-1952) founded in Steinach, Germany, producing papier-mâché figures for nativity scenes. Production halted in 1940, but revived in 1990. Today, Marolin offers toy animals and nativity figures in plastic and papier-mâché.

====France====
Papier-mâché objects were made under Louis XIV, such as a watch-holder in the form of a clock (Cartel porte-montre) in papier-mâché on a wooden frame, with a finish imitating tortoiseshell, or a polychrome papier-mâché bas-relief depicting the ‘Immaculate Conception’.

Papier-mâché was used at the Château de Versailles in the 18th century: it allowed ornamentalists to improve the decorations and give them greater freedom to adapt to the different spaces to be decorated. The decoration could also be modified or changed at minimal cost. The decoration of the Théâtre de la Reine in the grounds of the Petit Trianon in Marie-Antoinette&#x27;s time was largely papier-mâché.

At that time, many precious objects were made using papier-mâché. One example is a case made around 1760-1770. It was crafted from wood and papier-mâché, covered in black lacquer, and decorated with scenes from mythology inspired by &quot;The Birth of Venus&quot; and &quot;The Abduction of Europa&quot; by François Boucher in oil paint. The finish was a lacquer imitation called vernis Martin, developed in 1728.

The Musée Carnavalet houses a &quot;Model of the Chinese Pavilion at the &quot;, circa 1775-1785, with papier-mâché rocks that are actually boxes. There were also many papier-mâché mirror frames.

French lacquer applied to cardboard is a technique similar to lacquered papier-mâché invented by Guillaume Martin (1689-1749) around 1740. We know of cardboard bowls covered with red lacquer imitating the shape of Chinese bowls attributed to Étienne-Simon Martin (1703-1770). The same technique could be used to make vases, for example. The Louvre owns a round candy box in violet varnished cardboard lined with brown tortoiseshell with a gouache signed van Blarenberghe on its lid. Papier-mâché tableware was also made, like this Déjeuner breakfast tableware) from the French Directory period, ca. 1790/1800 Pasteboard was used for the geocentric armillary sphere attributed to in the Louvre

The Adt papier-mâché dynasty was a family-owned manufacturer of papier-mâché consumer goods that started in the mid-18th century in the Saar region with small-scale hand production and went on to become the world leader in papier-mâché products before being driven into bankruptcy. Its catalog listed over 10,000 products: from buttons and snuff boxes to cardboard casings for grenades, paper wagon wheels and items for the electrical industry, the company produced almost anything that could be made from papier-mâché. After the Franco-Prussian War, the factory in Forbach (Lorraine) surpassed the production output in and became the company headquarters until 1918.

Mathias Adt, son of the miller Johann Michael Adt (b. 1715), began making functional tobacco boxes. A monk, probably Mathias&#x27;s brother, introduced him to papier-mâché boxes associated with the Parisian bookbinder Martin, although these had failed commercially in Paris. By 1739, Mathias was producing boxes for the , and Abbot Michael Stein saw potential in the trade of what were called miller&#x27;s tins or monastery tins. They were made by gluing strips of paper around a solid block of wood, which was then removed. The tin was then soaked in linseed oil and dried at low to medium heat, and when the surface was perfectly smooth, it was covered with three to eighteen layers of varnish.

Mathias&#x27; son Johann Peter (1751-1808) was in charge of the workshop, which was eventually set up in the abbey&#x27;s provostry. Papier-mâché was a flourishing industry. French troops then occupied the Saar region in 1792 (until 1815) and the monasteries were secularised. Peter III Adt (1798-1879) bought the monastery in 1826 and a few years later founded the company Gebrüder Adt (Adt Brothers) with his three sons. Sales markets and trading offices were opened on all continents. By 1889, the company employed more than 2,500 people and produced more than six million items per year. There was a branch in Forbach (Lorraine) and another one in Pont-à-Mousson, which focused entirely on the French market, with a different range of products. Pont-à-Mousson now has a museum of papier maché, .

The decline began with the invention of Bakelite in 1907 and the First World War. The Second World War resulted in the destruction of the Ensheim and Schwarzenacker factories and the loss of the London branch.

There are many more details in the German version of Wikipedia ().

Papier-mâché painted with black lacquer and inlaid with mother-of-pearl inlays (&quot;burgauté&quot;) was adopted by French furniture makers inspired by English production from 1860 onwards, and then manufactured in the Pont à Mousson workshops, which also made small household objects such as trays and boxes were also made, some of them decorated with Japanese court scenes or battle scenes. Other objects included playing card cases , and jewellery boxes lacquered red on the inside and black on the outside, decorated with stylised flowers and birds of paradise. They also made items for restaurants, such as a waterproof bottle cooler.

In the 19th century, carton-pierre (papier-mâché into which clay is added, for example) was used extensively at Versailles and the Palais du Louvre. The Salle des Bijoux in the Musée Royal (now Room 661 in the Musée du Louvre), in the former Grand Cabinet of Louis XIV, was redecorated between 1828 and 1840: the new wall decoration, in wood and carton-pierre painted in faux marble or gilded, can be seen in a painting by Joseph Auguste.

The Duke of Nemours (1814-1896), after the death of his elder brother in 1842, had the first floor of the Pavillon de Marsan refurbished and engaged the services of sculptor and ornamentalist Michel-Victor Cruchet (1815-1899), who made carved wooden furniture and architectural ornaments in carton-pierre.

Less prestigious items are the dummy heads (&quot;marottes&quot;) used by milliners, hatters or wigmakers and hairdressers to model or display their products. They could be made of polychrome papier-mâché or carton bouilli (&quot;boiled cardboard&quot;), and some had &quot;yeux sulfure&quot; which were simply glass eyes. Male heads are relatively rare. There were also papier-mâché hats to decorate a hatter&#x27;s window. A surprising item is a bear&#x27;s head: it was a taxidermist&#x27;s dummy used to make fashionable bearskin carpets or bedside rugs. Schoolchildren may have been lucky enough to get a papier-mâché pencil box decorated with a transfer print while their parents seated on a gondola chair made of wood and black-lacquered papier-mâché sorted their mail into the papier-mâché or boiled cardboard letter rack decorated with mother-of-pearl inlays. There might be somewhere a bowl of papier-mâché fruit painted in all the colours of the rainbow under a glass cloche. There would be papier-mâché statues in churches. This was also the time of the very accurate human and veterinary papier-mâché anatomical models by Jean-François Ameline or Louis Auzoux. Didactic pieces were also made by Émile Deyrolle in France. In mid-19th-century France, high-quality artists&#x27; articulated mannequins or &quot;lay figures&quot; by Paul Huot and others, like &quot;Child No. 98,&quot; (in the Fitzwilliam Museum) with its removable papier-mâché head, became invaluable tools for painters.

In 1904, La Revue universelle described Paris&#x27;s small-scale toy industry relying on couples who worked in modest Temple and Belleville apartments and made papier-mâché items, with women pressing the papier-mâché into a mould and then unmoulding items, while men coloured and assembled them. Items included masks, carnival heads, streamers, zobos called s in French, April Fools&#x27; Day fish, , meats and pastries for theatre productions, fairground ball toss games, etc.

====Netherlands and Belgium====
A ceiling made of papier-mâché can be found at Soestdijk Palace and in the spectacular hall of Groningen railway station.

The Museum aan de Stroom in Antwerp owns the papier-mâché head of Druon Antigoon made by Pieter Coecke van Aelst in 1534-35. It used to be carried in a procession, together with that of Pallas Athena.

====Russia====
Papier-mâché was introduced to Russia in the early 18th century, likely through Western Europe. By the mid-19th century, Russian artisans had mastered and uniquely developed papier-mâché crafting, leading to the rise of Russian lacquer art, a style particularly centred in villages like Fedoskino, famous for Fedoskino miniatures (there are many details in the pages in French and in German). Cardboard houses built by a Russian engineer, one Melnikov, are sometimes mentioned: a railway hut in Benderi (probably Bender, Moldova) and a hut for the sick in Bucharest’ seem to have been assembled.

=== Mexico ===
Cartonería or papier-mâché sculpture is a traditional handcraft in Mexico. The papier-mâché works are also called &quot;carton Piedra&quot; (rock cardboard) for the rigidness of the final product. These sculptures today are generally made for certain yearly celebrations, especially for the Burning of Judas during Holy Week and various decorative items for Day of the Dead. However, they also include piñatas, mojigangas, masks, dolls and more made for various other occasions. There is also a significant market for collectors as well. Papier-mâché was introduced into Mexico during the colonial period, originally to make items for church. Since then, the craft has developed, especially in central Mexico. In the 20th century, the creation of works by Mexico City artisans Pedro Linares and Carmen Caballo Sevilla were recognized as works of art with patrons such as Diego Rivera. The craft has become less popular with more recent generations, but various government and cultural institutions work to preserve it.

=== Philippines ===

Papier-mâché, locally referred to as taka, is a known folk art of the town of Paete, the Carving Capital of the Philippines. It is said that the first known taka &quot;was wrapped around a mold carved from wood and painted with decorative pattern.&quot;

==== 20th century artists ====
In 20th-century France, papier-mâché was used in the performing arts, whether to make Noh theatre masks, or masks for the play for ‘’Compère le Renard‘’, a one-act farce by Georges Polti (1867-1946), created before the First World War (, 1920). Georges Lafaye (1915-1989) also built up a collection of puppets over the course of the century, some in papier mâché. This material is also used in the decorative arts, for example by Catherine David to create the frame of a large papier-mâché mirror with mirror marquetry (1970s). More recently, artists such as Gilles Jonemann, with his brooch in white coral and papier mâché, and Christian Astuguevieille have introduced papier mâché into jewellery design. Sculptors also used it, whether in works such as ‘’Homme au lévrier‘’ or Jean Dubuffet, in the 1960s, who experimented with papier mâché in sculptures such as Bouche en coup de sabre and Fruits de terre. His use of this material reflects his exploration of so-called ‘poor’ materials to create raw, singular forms.

Arnold Böcklin, with the help of his son-in-law , made several copies of &quot; Shield with Medusa&#x27;s face&quot; (Musée d’Orsay : S RF 2007 12).

The expressionist painter James Ensor owned a papier-mâché &quot;Fiji Mermaid,&quot; which was displayed at the Grand Palais in 2009 as part of an exhibition of his works. The original Fiji Mermaid was the one in P. T. Barnum&#x27;s 19th-century sideshow attraction. Other examples are found in museums like the Harvard Museum and MUCEM in Marseille.

Some artists take old ideas, play with them, and give them a new twist: for instance, Michelangelo Pistoletto, a pioneer of Arte Povera, used humble materials like paper mâché and iron in his work Mappamondo (1966-1968). Similarly, Riccardo Dalisi’s Sedia in cartapesta -1973) is a chair entirely crafted from papier mâché. German surrealist Hans Bellmer reinvented papier-mâché dolls with his polychrome wood and paper-mâché figures with natural hair and painted details, a form that blurs innocence with unsettling complexity. Paolo Spalluto (from Lecce), inspired by the paper church in Norway, constructed the &quot;Paper Room&quot; in Tjøme, with walls covered in papier-mâché, and has also crafted a paper mosaic and a wall made with papier-mâché bricks.

Mexico is also home to a synthesis of ancient art and modern creations. Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo showed an interest in Mexican folk art, including cartonería, and collected traditional crafts. The Museo Dolores Olmedo preserves some of them. Pedro Linares is famous for creating the first papier-mâché figures of ‘alebrijes’ (fantastic, colourful creatures typical of Mexican culture).

Many contemporary sculptors have used papier-mâché, for example Kiki Smith and John Connell. Claes Oldenburg&#x27;s first one-man show in 1959 included papier-mâché sculptures. Mirka Mora used papier-mâché to create playful, colourful sculptures, sometimes reminiscent of big heads and giant carnival figures (Little Miss Muffet, 1974).

==== Paper boats ====

One common item made in the 19th century in America was the paper canoe, most famously made by Waters &amp; Sons of Troy, New York. The invention of the continuous sheet paper machine allows paper sheets to be made of any length, and this made an ideal material for building a seamless boat hull. The paper of the time was significantly stretchier than modern paper, especially when damp, and this was used to good effect in the manufacture of paper boats. A layer of thick, dampened paper was placed over a hull mold and tacked down at the edges. A layer of glue was added, allowed to dry, and sanded down. Additional layers of paper and glue could be added to achieve the desired thickness, and cloth could be added as well to provide additional strength and stiffness. The final product was trimmed, reinforced with wooden strips at the keel and gunwales to provide stiffness, and waterproofed. Paper racing shells were highly competitive during the late 19th century. Few examples of paper boats survived. One of the best known paper boats was the canoe, the &quot;Maria Theresa&quot;, used by Nathaniel Holmes Bishop to travel from New York to Florida in 1874–75. An account of his travels was published in the book &quot;Voyage of the Paper Canoe&quot;.

==== Paper observatory domes ====
Papier-mâché panels were used in the late 19th century and early 20th century to produce lightweight domes, used primarily for observatories. The domes were constructed over a wooden or iron framework, and the first ones were made by the same manufacturer that made the early paper boats, Waters &amp; Sons. The domes used in observatories had to be light in weight so that they could easily be rotated to position the telescope opening in any direction, and large enough so that it could cover the large refractor telescopes in use at the time.

== Applications ==

With modern plastics and composites taking over the decorative and structural roles that papier-mâché played in the past, papier-mâché has become less of a commercial product. There are exceptions, such as Micarta, a modern paper composite, and traditional applications such as the piñata. It is still used in cases where the ease of construction and low cost are important, such as in arts and crafts.

=== Carnival floats ===
Papier-mâché is commonly used for large, temporary sculptures such as Carnival floats. A basic structure of wood, metal and metal wire mesh, such as poultry netting, is covered in papier-mâché. Once dried, details are added. The papier-mâché is then sanded and painted. Carnival floats can be very large and comprise a number of characters, props and scenic elements, all organized around a chosen theme. They can also accommodate several dozen people, including the operators of the mechanisms. The floats can have movable parts, like the facial features of a character, or its limbs. It is not unusual for local professional architects, engineers, painters, sculptors and ceramists to take part in the design and construction of the floats. New Orleans Mardi Gras float maker Blaine Kern, operator of the Mardi Gras World float museum, brings Carnival float artists from Italy to work on his floats.

=== Costuming and the theatre ===

Creating papier-mâché masks is common among elementary school children and craft lovers. Either one&#x27;s own face or a balloon can be used as a mold. This is common during Halloween time as a facial mask complements the costume.

Papier-mâché is an economical building material for both sets and costume elements. It is also employed in puppetry. A famous company that popularized it is Bread and Puppet Theater founded by Peter Schumann.

== Military uses ==

=== Paper sabots ===
Papier-mâché was used in a number of firearms as a material to form sabots. Despite the extremely high pressures and temperatures in the bore of a firearm, papier-mâché proved strong enough to contain the pressure, and push a sub-caliber projectile out of the barrel with a high degree of accuracy. Papier-mâché sabots were used in everything from small arms, such as the Dreyse needle gun, up to artillery, such as the Schenkl projectile.

=== Drop tanks ===

During World War II, military aircraft fuel tanks were constructed out of plastic-impregnated paper and used to extend the range or loiter time of aircraft. These tanks were plumbed to the regular fuel system via detachable fittings and dropped from the aircraft when the fuel was expended, allowing short-range aircraft such as fighters to accompany long-range aircraft such as bombers on longer missions as protection forces. Two types of paper tanks were used, a 200-gallon (758 L) conformal fuel tank made by the United States for the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, and a 108-gallon (409 L) cylindrical drop tank made by the British and used by the P-47 and the North American P-51 Mustang.

=== Combat decoy ===

From about 1915 in World War I, the British were beginning to counter the highly effective sniping of the Germans. Among the techniques the British developed was to employ papier-mâché figures resembling soldiers to draw sniper fire. Some were equipped with an apparatus that produced smoke from a cigarette, to increase the realism of the effect. Bullet holes in the decoys were used to determine the position of enemy snipers who had fired the shots. Very high success rates were claimed for this experiment.

<text>The Arjun () is a third generation main battle tank developed by the Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (CVRDE) of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), for the Indian Army. The tank is named after Arjuna, the archer prince who is the main protagonist of the Indian epic poem &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Design work began in 1986 and was finished in 1996. The Arjun main battle tank entered service with the Indian Army in 2004. The 43rd Armoured Regiment, formed in 2009, was the first regiment to receive the Arjun.

The Arjun features a 120 mm rifled main gun with indigenously developed armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot ammunition, one PKT 7.62 mm coaxial machine gun and a NSVT 12.7 mm machine gun. Powered by a single MTU multi-fuel diesel engine rated at 1,400 hp, it can achieve a maximum speed of and a cross-country speed of . It has a four-man crew: commander, gunner, loader and driver.

In 2010 and 2013, the Indian Army carried out comparative trials in the Thar Desert of Rajasthan, pitting the newly inducted Arjun MK1 against the Indian Army&#x27;s frontline Russian-designed T-90 tanks, during which the Arjun reportedly exhibited better accuracy and mobility.

The fire-control system (FCS) originally developed for the Arjun main battle tank has been integrated into the T-90 tanks built in India under a transfer of technology (ToT) agreement by the Heavy Vehicles Factory (HVF) at Avadi.

== History ==
After the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, the Government of India decided to develop a new main battle tank. The Indian Army issued a general staff qualitative requirement (GSQR) for a new battle tank, called for a 50 tonne main battle tank equipped with a 120 mm rifled gun, computerised FCS and powered by a 1,400 hp diesel engine. The programme to develop an indigenous tank was authorised in 1974 and funds were released for its development. In 1976, the Combat Vehicles Research and Development Establishment  (CVRDE) was established under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to undertake the development of the Arjun main battle tank and to carry out research and development (R&amp;D) on future combat vehicles for the Indian Army.

In 1983, the project began following a consultancy agreement with Krauss-Maffei, who had previously developed the Leopard 2, to oversee design, development and evaluation, while Indian state owned Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and HVF were joined with the CVRDE in the development of the Arjun. The original plan envisaged the development and rollout of the first tank prototype by 1980, which was later revised to 1987. The first prototype was delivered in 1989. The prototype tank resembled the Leo2A4 main battle tank of Germany.

From 1993 to 1996, the Indian Army carried out an extensive series of trials, which revealed some major defects in the tank, including the engine overheating and suboptimal performance of the weapons system. By the end of 1996, 14 pre-production series (PPS) tanks (PPS-1 to PPS-14) were built and delivered to the Indian Army to conduct trials. Based on these trials, the Army identified 10 shortcomings that needed to be addressed before inaugurating the tank into the service. During this period, the cost of the Arjun programme increased significantly from the 1974 estimate of to a developmental cost of in 1995.

The initial delays and cost escalations were attributed to the sequential revisions done to the original General Staff Qualitative Requirement (GSQR) issued in 1974 to accommodate new features. In 1996, the development of the PPS-15 tank prototype was initiated to address the shortcomings listed by the Army. In 1997, a &#x27;joint action plan&#x27; was formulated to address the identified flaws and to make the tank ready for induction. By 1999, both the Army and Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) gave clearance for a limited production run of the Arjun main battle tank based on the PPS-15 prototype. In 2000, the Indian Army placed an order for the procurement of 124 Arjun MK1 tanks.

=== Production and deployment ===

One Arjun tank (PPS-15) operated by the 43rd Armoured Regiment made a public appearance in the 1997 and 2001 Republic Day Parades. The serial production of the Arjun main battle tank began in 2003 at HVF Avadi. The first tank equipped with the BEL developed Integrated Fire Control System (IFCS), ballistic computer and gunner&#x27;s main sight, was rolled out in 2004 and delivered in the first batch of five Arjun tanks on 7 August 2004. The first tranche of production version Arjun tanks was delivered to the 43rd Armoured Regiment in 2004. By 2009, two armoured regiments had been equipped with the vehicle. The two regiments with Arjun MBT were 43rd and 75th Armoured Regiment. The first test firing of the LAHAT-launched (Laser Homing Attack or Laser Homing Anti-Tank gun) anti-tank guided missile was carried out in 2004.

By 2006, unit maintenance and unit repair vehicles developed for the Arjun-equipped regiments had been cleared for induction. In 2008, a multi-purpose mobile camouflage system (MCS), developed as part of the Defensive Aid System (DAS) project, had been completed successfully. Field evaluation trials were conducted on the Arjun MK1 main battle tank in 2009. In 2009, an advanced laser warning countermeasure system (ALWCS) and a fibre-optic gyro-based sensor package unit was developed and integrated on the Arjun MK1 main battle tank after field trials were carried out in two phases from May to August 2009. The first batch of the Armament Research &amp; Development Establishment (ARDE) developed recoil system for the Arjun was delivered to the HVF Avadi after successful completion of field trials in 2009; the total order was for 124 systems.

In 2010, combat simulators (turret and driver simulators) developed for the Arjun had been inducted into the Army, its development was authorised in 2009. By June 2011, more than 100 tanks had been delivered to the Indian Army. The delivery of all 124 tanks was completed by mid-2012. From 2013 to 2015, 75% of the Arjun tanks had to be grounded because of a lack of spare parts. By 2016, this problem had been rectified, and the tanks returned to active service.

=== Upgrades ===
In 2010, the DRDO proposed an improved variant of the Arjun designated as the Arjun MK2 as a next step in the programme. The configuration of the new variant was finalised in mid-2010 after consultations with the army. The new tank was redesigned to have 89 major and minor improvements intended to enhance the firepower and survivability of the tank. Of these, 73 improvements could be fitted easily on the existing MK1 variant tanks. In the same year, the Indian Army placed an order for the procurement of 124 Arjun MK2 tanks, which was later approved by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC). In 2011, the first MK2 prototype was built. This incorporated some 20 improvements, including a new commander&#x27;s independent panoramic sight system. The tank was handed over to the army to carry out validation trial phase one. By 2012, the first complete prototype incorporating all the listed improvements was rolled out for system validation trial phase two.

As part of the developmental trials, the first phase of the LAHAT gun-launched anti-tank guided missile firing trials were carried out by 2013. In 2015, DRDO developed an Integrated Automotive Vetronics System (IAVS) that was integrated into the Arjun MK2 prototype tank. Field trials were carried out over under harsh environmental conditions. In 2014 and 2016, two new rounds, Penetration-Cum-Blast and Thermobaric, were developed for the Arjun tank and successfully tested. Impact assessments were also carried out with instruments to measure shock and blast pressure.

In the meantime, the Arjun MK2 variant was redesignated as the Arjun Mk1A. By 2018, two Arjun Mk1A prototypes had been built and completed user trials by the end of the year.

In February 2024, DRDO reported that deliveries of the Mk1A are facing delays because of shortages of tank engines.

==Design==
=== Armament ===

====Primary====
The Arjun main battle tank has a 120 mm rifled gun fitted with an ARDE-developed (Armament Research and Development Establishment) recoil system, muzzle reference system and fume extractor, which can fire a variety of guided or unguided anti-armour munitions. The main gun is made from high strength electro-slag remelting (ESR) steel which is insulated with a thermal sleeve and autofrettaged to withstand higher pressure. The newer Arjun Mk1A variant retains the 120 mm rifled gun with improved barrel, although India has developed a 125 mm smoothbore gun for the T-90 tank, which is under license for production. 

The Arjun MK1 can fire several types of munitions, including indigenously developed armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS) and dual purpose high-explosive squash head (HESH) rounds. The Arjun MK1 can carry a mix of 42 APFSDS and HESH rounds in blast-proof canisters with blow out panels. In 2017, the Mark 2 variant of the APFSDS with a long rod tungsten alloy penetrator was developed and successfully tested by ARDE for the new Alpha variant of the Arjun (Mk1A). The new APFSDS Mark 2 round reportedly has improved penetration compared to the extant Mark 1 round. In addition to the existing rounds, the ARDE also developed and successfully tested two high explosive 120 mm rounds for the Arjun: Penetration Cum Blast (PCB) and Thermobaric (TB) Ammunition for urban warfare, which can be fired from existing MK1 and newer Mk1A tanks.

=====SAMHO=====

To enhance the firepower of the Arjun, DRDO earlier considered equipping the tank with a LAHAT gun-launched anti-tank guided missile, but in 2014, it was announced the plan had been dropped. In the same year, DRDO announced the development of an Indian-made, gun-launched guided missile under Cannon Launched Guided Missile Programme (CLMDP), the SAMHO. In 2020, DRDO successfully test fired SAMHO from an Arjun main battle tank.

ARDE developed the SAMHO missile in association with the High Energy Materials Research Laboratory (HEMRL) and the Instruments Research and Development Establishment (IRDE). The SAMHO guided missile has two high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) tandem-charge warheads designed to defeat explosive reactive armour (ERA) protection. The SAMHO is a dual purpose guided missile which can engage and neutralise armoured fighting vehicles, tanks, and low flying targets such as attack helicopters at a minimum range of and maximum range of up to .

====Secondary====

In addition to the main gun, the Arjun has two machine guns:
# A 12.7 mm NSV heavy machine gun mounted in front of the gunner&#x27;s hatch for engaging armoured vehicles, low flying aircraft and attack helicopters. In the Arjun MK1 it is operated manually while in Mk1A it has been replaced with a remotely operated gun turret which can be operated from inside the tank without exposing personnel to the hostile battlefield.
# A 7.62 mm machine gun in a coaxial weapon mount.

=== Fire control and sights ===
The Arjun tanks are equipped with an indigenous fire control system developed by BEL, the Integrated Fire Control System (IFCS). The IFCS consists of a digital ballistic computer which cues information from microprocessor-based sensors for wind-speed, tilt angle, target range, vehicle speed etc., to provide an accurate firing solution. The Arjun&#x27;s IFCS is designed for quick target acquisition with &quot;first round-first hit probability&quot; during day and night and in all weather conditions. The Arjun has a gun control system integrated into its 120 mm rifled gun which electro-hydraulically stabilises the gun to retain aim accuracy irrespective of the terrain disturbances (while moving). The two axis-stabilised gun control system interfaced with the IFCS offers high accuracy and slewing speed for engaging moving targets while on the move. The fire control system originally developed for the Arjun tank has been integrated into the Indian Army&#x27;s T-90 tanks.

The Arjun gunner&#x27;s main sight has an integrated laser range finder, day sight and thermal sight for day and night target recognition and engagement, and dual magnification and fibre-optic gyro based two-axis stabilisation. The sight is integrated with an automatic target tracking system developed by DRDO.

The commander&#x27;s panoramic sight operates independently of the turret. It is stabilised with a fibre-optic gyro, and has an integrated laser rangefinder, day sight with dual magnification and a thermal imaging camera for day and night all-weather 360-degree surveillance. The sight is also interfaced with the ballistic computer, which enables the commander to override the gunner to select and engage targets independently. In addition to the laser rangefinder, the Arjun Mk1A variant has an integrated laser target designator linked to the SAMHO gun-launched guided missile.

===Protection===

==== Armour ====

The Arjun MK1 tanks are protected by an indigenously developed armour called Kanchan armour, named after the city of Kanchanbagh, where the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL) which designed and developed the armour is located. Kanchan is a composite armour that consists of ceramic tiles and composite panels sandwiched between rolled homogeneous armour (RHA) plates. Its exact composition, the material used and the manufacturing processes are kept highly secret. The armour was fielded on the Arjun after extensive evaluation trials carried out against a variety of modern anti-tank munitions, including APFSDS.

The Arjun tanks are also protected with ultra-high strength low alloy DMR-1700 steel armour plates developed by the DMRL, which offer enhanced protection against kinetic energy penetrator projectiles such as APFSDS (125 mm) rounds, over the existing RHA plates by a margin of 20 per cent and 25 per cent against 7.62 mm and 12.7 mm armour-piercing projectiles.

The latest variant Arjun, the Mk1A, has a completely redesigned turret protected with improved Kanchan armour with enhanced protection against large calibre kinetic energy projectiles, explosive reactive armour (ERA) panels (ERA MK-II) on the turret, hull glacis and the side skirt. The Mk1A also has non-explosive reactive armour (NERA) protection. The turret is redesigned to reduce its silhouette, thereby delaying detection at ranges using modern electro-optical sights.

The tank has NBC protection and an automatic fire detection and suppression system for enhanced crew protection and survival.

==== Defensive aid system ====
Passive protection is provided by a multi-purpose mobile camouflage system (MCS) developed by DRDO; it is integrated on Arjun tanks and evaluations were carried out in 2009. The Arjun also has anti-infrared/anti-thermal paints to reduce its IR signature.

Active protection is provided by the Advanced Laser Warning Countermeasure System (ALWCS), and consists of four laser warning receivers mounted on the top of the turret to provide 360-degree protection cover. The ALWCS alerts the crew and indicates the direction of a threat when a laser rangefinder/designator, IR illuminator is pointed at the tank. The ALWCS has integrated IR jammers and aerosol based smoke grenades to confuse the anti-tank guided munitions.

The ALWCS is interfaced with the FCS of the Arjun tank, which autonomously rotates the grenade launcher in the direction of and perceived threat and fires aerosol smoke grenades. It has auto and manual modes of operation.

==== Crew safety and protection ====
The Arjun has a crew of four—commander, gunner, loader and driver. The Arjun&#x27;s crew compartment is ergonomically designed for crew safety and comfort and is protected with armour and ERA. In Arjun Mk1A, the driver&#x27;s safety and comfort is enhanced with roof mounted seat to protect him from Shock waves. The Arjun&#x27;s crew and engine compartments are equipped with an automatic fire detection and suppression system, which detects and suppresses fire within 200 milliseconds, while ammunition rounds are stored in a containerised ammunition bin with an individual shutter with blow off panels to mitigate the hazard caused by ammunition cook off. The Arjun Mk1A variant tank has a track-width mine plough to reduce the risk of anti-tank mines; the tank also has NBC protection.

===Mobility===
The Arjun is a heavy main battle tank that moves on seven roadwheels on each side, supported by an indigenously developed hydropneumatic suspension system. Powered by an MTU 838 Ka 501 turbo charged 10 cylinder liquid cooled diesel engine with a rated power output of 1400 hp at 2400 rpm, the tank has a top speed and a cross country speed. The Arjun tank has a maximum fuel capacity of and a range of .

The Arjun has a ground of clearance , and can ford through deep water without using a snorkel. During this operation, air for fuel combustion is drawn through the commander&#x27;s and loader&#x27;s hatches.

The latest Arjun Mk1A variant retains the 1,400 hp diesel powerplant but with a redesigned hydropneumatic suspension system and new advanced running gear system for optimal performance and efficiency. Earlier Arjun tanks were equipped with tracks supplied by the German company, Diehl, but these were later replaced with tracks supplied by Larsen &amp; Toubro.

The Mk1A variant has a new auxiliary power unit (APU) with double power generation capacity, which allows the tank to operate in silent watch mode while the main engine is off. The use of an APU reduces the IR/thermal and acoustic signature and enhances the tank&#x27;s ambush attack capability. The Arjun Mk1A has an Advanced Land Navigation System (ALNS) in addition to the GPS/inertial navigation system it retains from its predecessor, for enhanced navigation in uncharted hostile enemy territory.

In the Arjun Mk1A variant, the driver has an uncooled night-vision camera and an uncooled thermal imager with binocular vision enabling effortless driving at a reasonable speed on a pitch-black night.
====DATRAN 1500====
==== Integrated Automotive Vetronics System ====
Developed by CVRDE, the Integrated Automotive Vetronics System (IAVS) is a health monitoring system developed for tanks and armoured fighting vehicles operated by the Indian Army. The IAVS is a &quot;system of systems&quot; which integrates sensors and subsystems on board the Arjun to make the tank an efficient fighting machine. The IAVS monitors the data bus that interlaces the hull and turret subsystems, analyses automotive performance and alerts the crew when maintenance is due.

The system also integrates the driver&#x27;s enhanced sight system and provides automated driving. The tank crew interacts with the system through an integrated touch screen display. Its trials were successfully completed in August 2015 during which the prototype covered under harsh weather conditions.

== Operational history ==
Since its induction into service, the Arjun has participated in a number of wargames carried out by the Indian Army. In 2010, the first two armoured regiments equipped with Arjun tanks participated in the Army&#x27;s annual winter exercise. The same year, the Indian Army carried out a comparative trial pitting the newly inducted Arjun MK1 tanks against the imported T-90 tanks. The trial was carried out in four phases from 19 February 2010 to 12 March 2010, checking the subsystem performance, medium fording capability, automotive run and firing trials. In March 2010, it was reported that the Arjun had outperformed the T-90 in terms of both firepower and mobility.

During the comparative trials, the Arjun reportedly demonstrated its ability to target and engage moving targets while moving in the opposite direction. In addition, it demonstrated a zero water ingress medium fording capability, multiple target discrimination, and effortless automotive performance achieved even in the heavy dunal desert terrain.

In 2013, the Indian Army announced it would not purchase any additional vehicles above the 124 Arjuns that had already been ordered. In 2014, a report from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India noted that some parameters of the 2010 comparative trials had been relaxed for the T-90 tanks.

<text>The Yale Daily News is an independent student newspaper published by Yale University students in New Haven, Connecticut, since January 28, 1878.

== Description ==
Financially and editorially independent of Yale University since its founding, the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; is published online by a student editorial and business staff five days a week, Monday through Friday, during Yale&#x27;s academic year. Although the paper historically produced a daily print edition, it transitioned during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to a weekly print schedule and now prints only a Friday paper. Called the &quot;YDN&quot;, or sometimes the &quot;News&quot;, the &quot;Daily News&quot;, or the &quot;Daily Yalie&quot;, the newspaper and the website are produced in Briton Hadden Memorial Building at 202 York Street in New Haven and printed off-site at Valley Publishing Company in Derby, Connecticut.

Each day, reporters, mainly freshmen and sophomores, cover the university, the city of New Haven and sometimes the state of Connecticut. Besides updating its website with new stories five days a week, the &quot;YDN&quot; sends out daily, weekend and breaking -news newsletters and posts its contents to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok and YouTube. Its robust multimedia platforms include YTV, which produces video news, features and commentary, and numerous podcast series.

The &quot;YDN&quot; also publishes a daily opinion section, a Friday &quot;WKND&quot; section and special issues focusing on the experiences of Latinx, Black and Asian students in October, February and April, respectively.

Staff members generally serve as editors on the managing board during their junior year. A single chairman led the editorial and business sides of the &quot;News&quot; until 1970. Today, the editor-in-chief also serves as president of the Yale Daily News Publishing Company, while the publisher oversees business operations. An editorial board, independent of the newsroom, publishes a monthly column

In addition to the newspaper, the Yale Daily News Publishing Company produces the &quot;Yale Daily News Magazine&quot; and special newspaper issues for the incoming freshman class, Yale&#x27;s Class Day and Commencement and The Game against Harvard University.

==History==
===19th century===
In its inaugural edition on January 28, 1878, the newspaper&#x27;s first editors wrote: &quot;The innovation which we begin by this morning&#x27;s issue is justified by the dullness of the times, and the demand for news among us.&quot;

===20th century===
In 1920, the &quot;News&quot; began to report on national news and viewpoints. In 1940 and 1955, when professional dailies were not operating due to unrest among its workers, the &quot;News&quot; continued to report on national topics.

From 1968 to 1970, the &quot;YDN&quot; published a cartoon strip called &quot;Bull Tales&quot; by Garry Trudeau &#x27;70, parodying the exploits of Yale quarterback Brian Dowling. The strip which was reborn as &quot;Doonesbury&quot; and syndicated in newspapers nationwide for decades.

During the student strike of 1970, in response to the U.S. expansion of the Vietnam War into Cambodia, the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; announced that it did not support involvement in the student strikes occurring across the nation, making it the only Ivy League college newspaper to disagree with the protests. In response, fifty pro-strike demonstrators visited the &quot;News&quot; offices and called the editors &#x27;fascist pigs&#x27;. In its editorial, the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; warned that &quot;radical rhetoric and sporadic violence, such as marked the weekend demonstrations at Yale, only added fuel to the &#x27;demagoguery of Richard Nixon, Spiro Agnew, John Mitchell and the other hyenas of the right.&#x27;&quot;

When women first arrived at Yale College in the fall of 1969, the &quot;YDN&quot; was one of Yale&#x27;s first meaningfully coed student organizations. Within weeks, the newspaper published bylined articles by five women—Dori Zaleznik, Shelley Fisher (now Fishkin), Martha Wesson, Linda Temoshok (now Lydia Temoshok), and Ruth Falk. That first year, Fisher and Zaleznik were elected to the 1971 Editorial Board and Falk and Temoshok to the 1972 Editorial Board.

The &quot;YDN&quot; was also among the first student organizations to elect women to leadership roles. Zaleznik was elected Associate Executive Editor in 1970. Amy Oshinsky became the first female publisher in 1975. Anne (&quot;Andy&quot;) Perkins was elected the first female editor-in-chief in 1979.

The &quot;News&quot; survived for a century solely on income generated by subscriptions and ad sales. But by the mid 1970s, its Gothic building on the Yale campus had fallen into disrepair and help was needed to maintain it. 

In 1978, a group of News alumni including Eric Nestler &#x27;76, Jonathan Rose &#x27;63, Jim Ottaway &#x27;60, and Joseph Leiberman &#x27;64 created the Oldest College Daily Foundation to solicit philanthropic support for building repairs and capital expenditures.

===21st century===

The &quot;YDN&quot; has won numerous awards for its design and editorial content. Its front page design for November 5, 2008, the day after Barack Obama&#x27;s victory in the 2008 Presidential Election, was featured in the Poynter Institute book: &quot;President Obama Election 2008: Collection of Newspaper Front Pages by the Poynter Institute&quot;.

In 2009, the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot; won the Associated Collegiate Press Newspaper Pacemaker Award. 

On September 10 of that year, the &quot;News&quot; broke the news of the murder of Annie Le, a Yale graduate student reported missing and subsequently found murdered in the basement of her laboratory. 

In summer 2010, the 78-year-old Briton Hadden Memorial Building was renovated, increasing the amount of usable space in the basement and adding a multimedia studio in the heart of the newsroom.

On November 21, 2019, the &quot;News&quot; published an article detailing allegations of impropriety and sexual misconduct against Brendan Faherty, the Yale women&#x27;s soccer coach, by former players when he was coach of the women&#x27;s soccer team at the University of New Haven from 2002 to 2009. Yale announced Faherty&#x27;s departure the same day.

In 2018, the Foundation changed its name to the Yale Daily News Foundation in 2018 and now provides financial support to News staffers who would otherwise need to take paying jobs during the academic year and staffers taking low-paying journalism jobs during the summer. The &quot;YDN&quot; student staff continues to be responsible for all editorial and business decisions.

The Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University has an extensive Yale Daily News Historical Archive, containing digitized versions of printed issues from 1878 through 2020. Digitization of issues from 2021 through the present is currently underway. The collection is indexed, searchable and available to the public.

=== Contested claim ===
The &quot;News&quot;, founded in 1878, calls itself the &quot;oldest college daily&quot; in the United States, a claim contested by at least six other college student newspapers.

*&quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;, founded one year earlier than the &quot;YDN&quot; in 1877, calls itself the second-oldest college daily, but was not independent until the 1960s. 
*&quot;The Cornell Daily Sun&quot;, launched in 1880, calls itself the &quot;oldest independent college newspaper&quot;, notwithstanding the &quot;YDN&quot;″s independence since its founding two years earlier. 
*&quot;The Daily Californian&quot; at the University of California, Berkeley, was founded in 1871 but did not achieve independence until 1971. 
*&quot;The Daily Targum&quot; at Rutgers University was founded in 1869 but was published initially as a monthly newspaper and did not gain independence from the University until 1980.
*&quot;The Dartmouth&quot; at Dartmouth College, which opened in 1799 as the &quot;Dartmouth Gazette&quot;, calls itself the oldest college newspaper, though not the oldest daily. Most accurately put, the &quot;News&quot; is the oldest independent college daily newspaper.
*&quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; calls itself &quot;the oldest continuously published college daily&quot;, but it was founded in 1873 as a fortnightly publication called &quot;The Magenta&quot; and did not appear daily until 1883. The &quot;News&quot; ceased publishing briefly during World War I and World War II after editors volunteered for military service.

== Alumni ==
The &quot;News&quot; serves as a training ground for journalists at Yale, and has produced a steady stream of professional reporters who work at newspapers, magazines and websites including &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker,&quot; &quot;The Economist&quot;, &quot;ProPublica&quot; and &quot;Politico&quot;.

&quot;Yale Daily News&quot; alumni have also pioneered new forms of American journalism. Shortly after graduating from Yale, classmates and rivals Briton Hadden &#x27;20 and Henry Luce &#x27;20 co-founded Time Inc. and its magazine empire. In 2010, Paul Steiger &#x27;64, the longtime managing editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; co-founded ProPublica Inc., a nonprofit online newsroom that has won six Pulitzer Prizes for investigative journalism.

<text>The white-browed fantail (Rhipidura aureola) is a small passerine bird belonging to the family Rhipiduridae.

== Description ==

The adult white-browed fantail is about 18 cm long. It has dark brown upperparts, with white spots on the wings, and whitish underparts. The fan-shaped tail is edged in white, and the long white supercilia meet on the forehead. The throat and eyemask are blackish and border whitish moustachial stripes.

==Distribution and habitat==
The white-browed fantail breeds across tropical regions of the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The species ranges from eastern Pakistan to southern Indochina. It is found in forest and other woodland.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Three eggs are laid in a small cup nest in a tree. The white-browed fantail is insectivorous, and often fans its tail as it moves through the undergrowth.

<text>In complex analysis, Picard&#x27;s great theorem and Picard&#x27;s little theorem are related theorems about the range of an analytic function. They are named after Émile Picard.

==The theorems==
Little Picard Theorem: If a function formula_1 is entire and non-constant, then the set of values that formula_2 assumes is either the whole complex plane or the plane minus a single point. 

Sketch of Proof: Picard&#x27;s original proof was based on properties of the modular lambda function, usually denoted by formula_3, and which performs, using modern terminology, the holomorphic universal covering of the twice punctured plane by the unit disc. This function is explicitly constructed in the theory of elliptic functions. If formula_4 omits two values, then the composition of formula_4 with the inverse of the modular function maps the plane into
the unit disc which implies that formula_4 is constant by Liouville&#x27;s theorem.

This theorem is a significant strengthening of Liouville&#x27;s theorem which states that the image of an entire non-constant function must be unbounded. Many different proofs of Picard&#x27;s theorem were later found and Schottky&#x27;s theorem is a quantitative version of it. In the case where the values of formula_4 are missing a single point, this point is called a lacunary value of the function.

Great Picard&#x27;s Theorem: If an analytic function formula_4 has an essential singularity at a point formula_9 , then on any punctured neighborhood of formula_10 takes on all possible complex values, with at most a single exception, infinitely often.

This is a substantial strengthening of the Casorati–Weierstrass theorem, which only guarantees that the range of formula_4 is dense in the complex plane. A result of the Great Picard Theorem is that any entire, non-polynomial function attains all possible complex values infinitely often, with at most one exception.

The &quot;single exception&quot; is needed in both theorems, as demonstrated here: 
*ez is an entire non-constant function that is never 0,
*formula_12 has an essential singularity at 0, but still never attains 0 as a value.

==Proof==

===Little Picard Theorem===
Suppose formula_13 is an entire function that omits two values formula_14 and formula_15. By considering formula_16 we may assume without loss of generality that formula_17 and formula_18.

Because formula_19 is simply connected and the range of formula_4 omits formula_21 , &quot;f&quot; has a holomorphic logarithm. Let formula_22 be an entire function such that formula_23. Then the range of formula_22 omits all integers. By a similar argument using the quadratic formula, there is an entire function &quot;formula_25&quot; such that formula_26. Then the range of formula_25 omits all complex numbers of the form formula_28, where formula_29 is an integer and formula_30 is a nonnegative integer.

By Landau&#x27;s theorem, if formula_31, then for all formula_32, the range of formula_25 contains a disk of radius formula_34. But from above, any sufficiently large disk contains at least one number that the range of &quot;h&quot; omits. Therefore formula_35 for all formula_9. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, formula_25 is constant, so formula_4 is constant.

===Great Picard Theorem===

Suppose &quot;f&quot; is an analytic function on the punctured disk of radius &quot;r&quot; around the point &quot;w&quot;, and that &quot;f&quot; omits two values &quot;z&quot;0 and &quot;z&quot;1. By considering (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot; + &quot;rz&quot;) − &quot;z&quot;0)/(&quot;z&quot;1 − &quot;z&quot;0) we may assume without loss of generality that &quot;z&quot;0 = 0, &quot;z&quot;1 = 1, &quot;w&quot; = 0, and &quot;r&quot; = 1. 

The function &quot;F&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;e&quot;−&quot;z&quot;) is analytic in the right half-plane Re(&quot;z&quot;) &gt; 0. Because the right half-plane is simply connected, similar to the proof of the Little Picard Theorem, there are analytic functions &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; defined on the right half-plane such that &quot;F&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;e&quot;2π&quot;iG&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) and &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = cos(&quot;H&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)). For any &quot;w&quot; in the right half-plane, the open disk with radius Re(&quot;w&quot;) around &quot;w&quot; is contained in the domain of &quot;H&quot;. By Landau&#x27;s theorem and the observation about the range of &quot;H&quot; in the proof of the Little Picard Theorem, there is a constant &quot;C&quot; &gt; 0 such that |&quot;H&quot;′(&quot;w&quot;)| ≤ &quot;C&quot; / Re(&quot;w&quot;). Thus, for all real numbers &quot;x&quot; ≥ 2 and 0 ≤ &quot;y&quot; ≤ 2π,
:::formula_39
where &quot;A&quot; &gt; 0 is a constant. So |&quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;iy&quot;)| ≤ &quot;x&quot;&quot;A&quot;.

Next, we observe that &quot;F&quot;(&quot;z&quot; + 2π&quot;i&quot;) = &quot;F&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) in the right half-plane, which implies that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot; + 2π&quot;i&quot;) − &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is always an integer. Because &quot;G&quot; is continuous and its domain is connected, the difference &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot; + 2π&quot;i&quot;) − &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = &quot;k&quot; is a constant. In other words, the function &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) − &quot;kz&quot; / (2π&quot;i&quot;) has period 2π&quot;i&quot;. Thus, there is an analytic function &quot;g&quot; defined in the punctured disk with radius &quot;e&quot;−2 around 0 such that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) − &quot;kz&quot; / (2π&quot;i&quot;) = &quot;g&quot;(&quot;e&quot;−&quot;z&quot;).

Using the bound on &quot;G&quot; above, for all real numbers &quot;x&quot; ≥ 2 and 0 ≤ &quot;y&quot; ≤ 2π,
::formula_40
holds, where &quot;A&quot;′ &gt; &quot;A&quot; and &quot;C&quot;′ &gt; 0 are constants. Because of the periodicity, this bound actually holds for all &quot;y&quot;. Thus, we have a bound |&quot;g&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)| ≤ &quot;C&quot;′(−log|&quot;z&quot;|)&quot;A&quot;′ for 0 &lt; |&quot;z&quot;| &lt; &quot;e&quot;−2. By Riemann&#x27;s theorem on removable singularities, &quot;g&quot; extends to an analytic function in the open disk of radius &quot;e&quot;−2 around 0.

Hence, &quot;G&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) − &quot;kz&quot; / (2π&quot;i&quot;) is bounded on the half-plane Re(&quot;z&quot;) ≥ 3. So &quot;F&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)&quot;e&quot;−&quot;kz&quot; is bounded on the half-plane Re(&quot;z&quot;) ≥ 3, and
&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)&quot;z&quot;&quot;k&quot; is bounded in the punctured disk of radius &quot;e&quot;−3 around 0. By Riemann&#x27;s theorem on removable singularities, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)&quot;z&quot;&quot;k&quot; extends to an analytic function in the open disk of radius &quot;e&quot;−3 around 0. Therefore, &quot;f&quot; does not have an essential singularity at 0.

Therefore, if the function &quot;f&quot; has an essential singularity at 0, the range of &quot;f&quot; in any open disk around 0 omits at most one value. If &quot;f&quot; takes a value only finitely often, then in a sufficiently small open disk around 0, &quot;f&quot; omits that value. So &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) takes all possible complex values, except at most one, infinitely often.
==Generalization and current research==
&quot;Great Picard&#x27;s theorem&quot; is true in a slightly more general form that also applies to meromorphic functions:

 Great Picard&#x27;s Theorem (meromorphic version): If &quot;M&quot; is a Riemann surface, &quot;w&quot; a point on &quot;M&quot;, P1(C) = C ∪ {∞} denotes the Riemann sphere and &quot;f&quot; : &quot;M&quot;\{&quot;w&quot;} → P1(C) is a holomorphic function with essential singularity at &quot;w&quot;, then on any open subset of &quot;M&quot; containing &quot;w&quot;, the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) attains all but at most &quot;two&quot; points of P1(C) infinitely often.

Example: The function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) = 1/(1 − &quot;e&quot;1/&quot;z&quot;) is meromorphic on C* = C - {0}, the complex plane with the origin deleted. It has an essential singularity at &quot;z&quot; = 0 and attains the value ∞ infinitely often in any neighborhood of 0; however it does not attain the values 0 or 1.

With this generalization, &quot;Little Picard Theorem&quot; follows from &quot;Great Picard Theorem&quot; because an entire function is either a polynomial or it has an essential singularity at infinity. As with the little theorem, the (at most two) points that are not attained are lacunary values of the function.

The following conjecture is related to &quot;Great Picard&#x27;s Theorem&quot;:

Conjecture: Let {&quot;U&quot;1, ..., &quot;Un&quot;} be a collection of open connected subsets of C that cover the punctured unit disk D \ {0}. Suppose that on each &quot;Uj&quot; there is an injective holomorphic function &quot;fj&quot;, such that d&quot;f&quot;&quot;j&quot; = d&quot;fk&quot; on each intersection &quot;U&quot;&quot;j&quot; ∩ &quot;U&quot;&quot;k&quot;. Then the differentials glue together to a meromorphic 1-form on D.

It is clear that the differentials glue together to a holomorphic 1-form &quot;g&quot; d&quot;z&quot; on D \ {0}. In the special case where the residue of &quot;g&quot; at 0 is zero the conjecture follows from the &quot;Great Picard&#x27;s Theorem&quot;.

<doc id="674055" wikidata="Q10306813" url="?curid=674055" title="Jesse Palmer">
<text>Jesse James Palmer (born October 5, 1978) is a Canadian television personality, sports commentator, and former professional football player who was a quarterback for five seasons in the National Football League (NFL) in the early 2000s. Palmer played college football for the Florida Gators under coach Steve Spurrier, and thereafter, he played professionally for the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers in the NFL before spending half of the 2006 season with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League (CFL).

Palmer was cast in 2004 as the Bachelor on the fifth season of the reality television series &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. He went on to become a college football analyst for ESPN/ABC in the United States, and has been a contributor to The Sports Network (TSN) in Canada. He was also a contributor to ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. In 2018, he hosted the kickoff season of &quot;The Proposal&quot; on ABC. Since 2017, he has hosted the &quot;Holiday Baking Championship&quot; on Food Network. He was host of &quot;DailyMailTV&quot; from 2017 to 2020. In 2021, Palmer was named as the permanent host of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; and &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;.

==Early life==
Palmer was born in Toronto, Ontario, and raised in Nepean, Ontario, a suburb of Ottawa. He attended both Confederation and St. Pius X high schools, although he played all of his amateur football on teams in the Ontario Minor Football Association and most importantly with the Ottawa Norsemen and Myers Riders Football Clubs in Ottawa.

His father, Bill Palmer, played seven years for the Ottawa Rough Riders. His mother, Susan, was a prominent fashion and print model, co-founder of Barrett Palmer Models and former owner of International Top Models, a modeling agency and training centre located in Ottawa which became MIM Model International Management.

He has two younger brothers and attended a French-immersion school. His brother Billy played tight end for the University of Notre Dame. His cousin, Griffen Palmer is a country music singer and songwriter.

==College career==
Palmer accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Steve Spurrier&#x27;s Florida Gators football team from 1997 to 2000.

Palmer often alternated playing time with quarterback Doug Johnson, and, later, with quarterback Rex Grossman. As a senior, he was selected as one of the team captains and received the Gators&#x27; Fergie Ferguson Award, recognizing the &quot;senior football player who displays outstanding leadership, character and courage.&quot; He finished his four-year college career with 3,755 passing yards.

Palmer graduated from the University of Florida in 2001 with two undergraduate degrees: a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, and a Bachelor of Science degree in marketing from the College of Business Administration. He was named to the Southeastern Conference’s academic honor roll in 1998, 1999 and 2000.

==Professional football career==

===National Football League===
Palmer was selected by the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL) in the fourth round (125th overall pick) of the 2001 NFL draft, and he played for the Giants from until he was cut before the start of the season. As a Giants quarterback, he spent most of his NFL career as a backup behind starter Kerry Collins. In 2002, Palmer played in two games. The following season, Palmer played in six games, starting three. Palmer was the second Canadian (after Mark Rypien of the Washington Redskins) to start at quarterback in the NFL.

After a four-year stint as a backup quarterback, he was cut on September 3, 2005, by the Giants. He had entered the summer 2005 training camp as the backup to Eli Manning, but found himself odd-man-out when the Giants went with Tim Hasselbeck at number two and Jared Lorenzen at number three QB.

Attempting to locate another opportunity to stay in the NFL, Palmer worked out with the Minnesota Vikings and Oakland Raiders and was signed by the San Francisco 49ers on November 1, 2005, as injuries plagued their quarterbacks Alex Smith and Ken Dorsey. Dorsey and Smith returned from injury three weeks later, and Palmer was released without having played a down. Palmer was re-signed by the 49ers in March 2006 during the off-season, but was released on August 29, 2006, toward the end of training camp.

===Canadian Football League===
After leaving the NFL, he looked to the Canadian Football League for employment. Palmer had been drafted 15th overall by the Montreal Alouettes in the 2001 CFL Draft. His rights were still held by Montreal; however, the Ottawa Renegades tried to acquire the Ottawa native as their top quarterback in September 2005, and Palmer expressed interest in playing for his home town.

On September 11, 2006, the Montreal Alouettes signed him to their developmental roster. Palmer did not dress for a game with Montreal. He retired from the CFL before the start of the 2007 season to pursue a broadcasting career.

During the first rose ceremony, Palmer called the name Katie in error, meaning to say Karen. After consulting with host Chris Harrison, Palmer offered a rose to both contestants. He eventually selected Jessica Bowlin, but their courtship lasted for only a few months after the end of the show. He would return as host of the 26th season, a role which he also filled on the 19th season of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;. Palmer also hosted &quot;Bachelor In Paradise&quot;, Season 8. He is currently host of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; franchises. This includes &quot;The Golden Bachelor,&quot; the first season of which aired in Fall of 2023.

Palmer was also New York correspondent for CTV&#x27;s entertainment news program, &quot;eTalk&quot;, covering both sports and entertainment events, including the Super Bowl and the 79th and 80th Academy Awards.

Palmer was a studio analyst for ESPN&#x27;s broadcast of the 2012 Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Texas, the 2010 Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona, and the 2009 Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. He was the ESPN analyst for the 2023 Orange Bowl in Miami Gardens, Florida.He is also an NFL analyst for TSN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Morning Quarterback&quot; segment.

Palmer guest starred in the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; season 7 episode &quot;Design,&quot; portraying professional baseball player Don Lacey. He hosted the first two seasons of the food competition show &quot;Recipe to Riches&quot; on Food Network Canada. On May 19, 2015, Palmer joined &quot;Good Morning America&quot; as a &quot;Special Contributor&quot;. He left the position in August 2017, to host the newly launched &quot;DailyMailTV&quot;. He began hosting &quot;Spring Baking Championship&quot; in 2023 and has been hosting the &quot;Holiday Baking Championship&quot; for several seasons on Food Network, as well as &quot;Food Truck Face Off&quot;, &quot;Bakeaway Camp,&quot; and &quot;Holiday Baking: Gingerbread Showdown.&quot; In 2019, he became one of the commentators on ESPN&#x27;s College Football Final.

In September 2018, Palmer began doing commercials as a spokesman for retail furniture chain Rooms To Go. He also became host of &quot;The Proposal&quot; on ABC.

On August 14, 2020, the producers of &quot;DailyMailTV&quot; announced that for the show&#x27;s fourth season, Thomas Roberts was replacing Palmer.

In 2021, Palmer hosted the inaugural season of ABC&#x27;s show &quot;The Ultimate Surfer&quot;. Subsequently, it was announced that he would become the new host of &quot;The Bachelor&quot;, Season 26, replacing Chris Harrison. He then hosted &quot;The Bachelorette,&quot; Season 19, and &quot;Bachelor In Paradise&quot;, Season 8. He is currently host of &quot;The Bachelor&quot; franchises.

In October 2023, he became the spokesman for Avocados from Mexico.

<doc id="674067" wikidata="Q728141" url="?curid=674067" title="Taman Negara">
<text>Taman Negara is a national park in Peninsular Malaysia. It was established in 1938 and 1939 as the King George V National Park after Theodore Hubback lobbied the sultans of Pahang, Terengganu and Kelantan to set aside a piece of land that covers the three states for the creation of a protected area. After independence, it was renamed Taman Negara, which means &quot;national park&quot; in Malay. 

Taman Negara has a total area of 4,343 km2 and it is one of the world&#x27;s oldest rainforests, estimated to be more than 130 million years old. Mount Tahan, Peninsular Malaysia&#x27;s highest point, is within the park&#x27;s boundaries. Taman Negara is an important conservation area for the Peninsular Malaysian rain forest and montane rain forest ecoregions, is rich in biodiversity and home to several endangered species such as the Malayan tiger and Asian elephant. The park exists on the traditional lands of several Orang Asli groups, such as the Batek people, whose use rights are recognised in the park&#x27;s legislation.

A popular tourist attraction, the park is found near Kuala Tahan (where the Park headquarters for Pahang is located) and features a canopy walkway, the Gua Telinga cave system, and the Lata Berkoh rapids. Visitors can experience the tropical rainforest, birdwatching, jungle trekking, and the river views along the Tahan River, with many local resorts and hotels for visitors located nearby. 

==Geography==

The park encompasses three states, Pahang, Kelantan and Terengganu, each with its own legislation. The Taman Negara Enactment (Pahang) No. 2 of 1939 is enforced in the state of Pahang, the Taman Negara Enactment (Kelantan) No. 14 of 1938 in the state of Kelantan and the Taman Negara Enactment (Terengganu) No. 6 of 1939 in the state of Terengganu. The enactments have similar contents.

Taman Negara Pahang is the largest at 2,477 km2, followed by Taman Negara Kelantan at 1,043 km2 and Taman Negara Terengganu at 853 km2. At an estimated age of more than 130 million years old, it is reputed to be the &quot;oldest tropical rainforest&quot;, although the title more accurately belongs to the Daintree Rainforest in Queensland, Australia, estimated to be between 135 million years old and 180 million years old.

Taman Negara is mostly located on ancient, sedimentary rocks and the oldest part of the continent, it features mostly gentle rolling hills where about 57% of the total land area of the park are located below 300m above sea level due to a long time erosion. Despite that, it also features some mountainous parts of the Tahan Range, a subrange of the Tenasserim Hills. The Tahan Range is home to Mount Tahan, the highest and most prominent point in Peninsular Malaysia at about 2,187m above sea level.

The park acts as an important headwater for the states of Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang. There are three main river systems that originated from The park, which are the Lebir, Terengganu and Tembeling Rivers. The Lebir is one of the tributaries of the Kelantan River, flowing northward passing through Kelantan Delta, while the Terengganu River flows eastward toward Kenyir Lake and is one of the primary inflow for the lake; and Tembeling River is one of the tributaries of the Pahang River, flowing southward towards the central valley of Pahang. These rivers ultimately discharge into the South China Sea.

The park has been developed into an ecotourism destination in Malaysia. There are several geological and biological attractions in the park. Gunung Tahan is the highest point of the Malay Peninsula; climbers can use Kuala Tahan or Merapoh as their departure point. All visitors to the park must obtain permits from the Department of Wildlife and National Parks.

== Indigenous people ==

Taman Negara is part of the traditional territory of several groups of Orang Asli, the indigenous people of Peninsular Malaysia. In particular, several groups of Batek people still live on the periphery of the park. The park legislation recognises use-rights of Orang Asli within Taman Negara (e.g. section 15(c), Pahang En. 2/1939). In this regard, six &quot;aboriginal tribes&quot; are listed (Ple, Temiar, Ple-Temiar, Senoi, Semang, and Pangan).

==Flora==
Taman Negara features a largely virgin, lowland dipterocarp rainforest as well as Peninsular Malaysian montane rain forests on the higher elevation parts of the park.

==Fauna==
Taman Negara is home to some rare mammals, such as the Malayan tiger, Malayan gaur (&quot;seladang&quot;) and Asian elephant. Additionally, some biologists also believe that a small population of Northern Sumatran Rhinoceros live in the park. As well as birds such as the great argus, red junglefowl, and the rare Malayan peacock-pheasant are still found here in some numbers. Tahan River has been preserved to protect the Malaysian mahseer (&quot;ikan kelah&quot; in Malay), a type of game fish. Species found in the park include 10,000 plants, 150,000 of insects, 25,000 invertebrates, 675 birds, 270 reptiles, 250 freshwater fish and 200 mammals at the national park, including some of which are rare or indigenous to Malaysia.

==Transportation==

Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM)&#x27;s KTM Intercity and Express trains stop at Jerantut railway station. Visitors to Taman Negara can disembark here.

Local tour operators arrange transportation from Kuala Lumpur to the entrance of the Park at Kuala Tahan. This may involve a 3-4 hour bus journey to Jerantut and Kuala Tembeling Jetty followed by a 2.5 hour river boat ride to Kuala Tahan. Entrance permits and park tours are often included in the package.

From Kuala Lumpur, buses may depart from Terminal Bersepadu Selatan and Hentian Pekeliling going to the nearest town, Jerantut. From here travel to Kuala Tembeling Jetty and Kuala Tahan.

==In the media==
Taman Negara was featured in cartoonist, Lat&#x27;s 1980 compilation of &quot;New Straits Times&quot; cartoons, &quot;With a Little Bit of Lat&quot;, published in 1980 by Berita Publishing.

The park also became the subject matter in 1998 documentary film, &quot;Taman Negara: Destinasi Alam Semulajadi&quot;, produced by Filem Negara Malaysia.

<doc id="674073" wikidata="Q368338" url="?curid=674073" title="Microsoft Publisher">
<text>[[Microsoft 365|Microsoft]] Publisher is a desktop publishing application from Microsoft, differing from Microsoft Word in that the emphasis is placed on page layout and graphic design rather than text composition and proofreading. It is planned for discontinuation in October 2026.

==Overview==
Publisher is included in higher-end editions of Microsoft Office, reflecting Microsoft&#x27;s emphasis on the application as an easy-to-use and less expensive alternative to the &quot;heavyweights&quot; with a focus on the small-business market, where firms do not have dedicated design professionals available to make marketing materials and other documents. However, it has a relatively small share of the desktop publishing market, which is dominated by Adobe InDesign and formerly by QuarkXPress.

While most Microsoft Office apps adopted ribbons for their user interface starting with Microsoft Office 2007, Publisher retained its toolbars and did not adopt ribbons until Microsoft Office 2010.

On February 15, 2024, Microsoft announced that Publisher will be discontinued on October 13, 2026. After this date, Publisher will no longer be included in Microsoft 365 plans, and existing on-premises installations will no longer be supported. This date will mark the end of Publisher as a standalone Microsoft program since its initial release in 1991.

==Compatibility==
Several applications can import Publisher&#x27;s proprietary file format (.pub) for editing with some success, including Collabora Online, LibreOffice, and Scribus. Another option is to save the document as a separate EPS file for each individual page in the publication, and to then open the EPS files in the aforementioned applications or other applications.

Publisher supports some other file formats, including Microsoft&#x27;s Enhanced Metafile (EMF) format, which is supported on Windows platforms. The Microsoft Publisher trial version can be used to view .pub files beyond the trial period.

Adobe PageMaker also saved files with a .pub extension, but the two file formats were unrelated and incompatible.

<doc id="674080" wikidata="Q125533" url="?curid=674080" title="Silver Convention">
<text>Silver Convention were a German Euro disco recording act of the 1970s. The group was originally named Silver Bird Convention or Silver Bird.

== History ==
The group was initiated in Munich, then West Germany, by producers and songwriters Michael Kunze and Sylvester Levay. The group was named after Levay&#x27;s nickname: &quot;Silver&quot;. Kunze in the late 1960s had been a pop lyricist who wrote protest songs in German; when these tunes went out of style, he began producing pop records and commercials. Levay had developed a taste for American music while growing up in then Yugoslavia, eventually becoming a music arranger and lyricist.

Using female session vocalists named Ingrid, Wilma, and Monica, they scored a successful single in the United Kingdom in 1975 with the song &quot;Save Me&quot;, which peaked at #30. They later used other vocalists, such as Gitta Walther, Lucy Neale, Betsy Allen, Roberta Kelly, and Jackie Carter for their first recordings and upcoming album. Since they were only a studio group, Levay and Kunze realized then that they would need to find professional entertainers for presentation to the public. Penny McLean, Ramona Wulf, and Linda G. Thompson became the public face of Silver Convention.

They scored two major US and Canadian hit singles. &quot;Fly, Robin, Fly&quot;, of which the complete lyrics consisted of only six different words (fly, robin, up, to, the, sky), maintained three weeks at #1 in late November and early December 1975, and won the group a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in December 1975. Initially the song was titled &quot;Run, Rabbit, Run&quot;, changed by the writers moments before the recording took place. Their next success &quot;Get Up and Boogie&quot;, which also consisted of only six different words (Get, Up, And, Boogie, That&#x27;s, Right), hit #1 in Canada on June 15, 1976, had 3 weeks at #2 in the U.S in June 1976 and also peaked at #7 in the UK, in May 1976. 

Their next release, &quot;No No Joe,&quot; only scored #60 in September 1976. The further singles released by the trio attempted to duplicate the sound that had made them successful briefly, but they were only minor successes. At this time, Linda G. Thompson left the group and was replaced by New Yorker Rhonda Heath, who was chosen over other hopefuls at an open casting call to become the newest singer for the group.

Michael Kunze wrote the lyrics on the first two albums under the pseudonym Stephan Prager. During this time the three singers released their own solo work. McLean and Thompson achieved hit singles with &quot;Lady Bump&quot; and &quot;1-2-3-4... Fire!&quot;, and &quot;Ooh What a Night&quot; respectively. Wulf&#x27;s solo effort was only a moderate success.

Silver Convention represented Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977 with &quot;Telegram&quot;, finishing eighth. The entry had only English lyrics (with considerably more words than their past hits), but was allowed to enter in spite of the language rule being reintroduced this year, because the song had been chosen to represent Germany before the reintroduction was announced. In 1994, Rhonda Heath returned to Eurovision, providing backing vocals and keyboards for the German entry &quot;Wir geben &#x27;ne Party&quot; performed in German by Mekado. This entry did better than Silver Convention&#x27;s effort, finishing third out of the 25 entries in Dublin.

With a new producer, John Davis, and a revised line-up of singers (Suzie McClosky a.k.a. Zenda Jacks, Rhonda Heath, and Ramona Wulf), Silver Convention was successful again during 1978 with the album &quot;Love in a Sleeper&quot;. The 12&quot; single release from the LP was &quot;Spend the Night With Me&quot; backed with &quot;Mission To Venus&quot;.

Levay also worked with Giorgio Moroder, and Kunze began work with Jim Steinman. The solo careers of the three singers ended quickly and they left the music industry, since interest in the disco scene was declining during this period. Levay and Kunze later collaborated on the Vienna productions of the musicals &quot;Elisabeth&quot;, &quot;Mozart!&quot; and &quot;Rebecca&quot;.

==First U.S. concert for Braniff Airways==
Silver Convention&#x27;s first United States Concert was held at Dallas, Texas, in the North Hangar of Braniff International Airways Operations and Maintenance Base at Dallas Love Field Airport on Wednesday evening, February 23, 1977. The group had travelled from Acapulco, Mexico, where they had also performed on February 19, 1977 for Braniff during a special party dubbed Three Evenings To Remember. The airline threw the promotional party to announce its new Ultra Elegance Campaign and debut new air and ground crew uniforms by American fashion designer Halston. Silver Convention penned a song titled &quot;Ultra Ultra&quot; specifically for Braniff to commemorate the carrier&#x27;s new inflight service; this song they performed in Acapulco and at the Dallas concerts. The day after the Love Field concert, the group travelled to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to tape an interview for &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;.

==Cover versions of their songs==
American jazz flautist Herbie Mann recorded a cover version of &quot;Fly, Robin, Fly&quot; for his 1976 album, &quot;Bird in a Silver Cage&quot;, which was co-produced and arranged by Sylvester Levay. The Australian/British string quartet Bond also recorded a version of &quot;Fly, Robin, Fly&quot; for their 2004 album, &quot;Classified&quot;. In 2003, German lifestyle company Apartment20 produced a version of &quot;Fly, Robin, Fly&quot;, which featured Ramona Wulf on lead vocals and in the video for the song.

The Dancing Tolmans And Johnny Brogan covered &quot;San Francisco Hustle&quot; on their album &quot;The Dancing Tolmans And Johnny Brogans Anniversary Album&quot;.

&quot;Thank You, Mr. DJ&quot;, a B-side of the &quot;No, No, Joe&quot; single was sampled by the Australian alternative rock band Regurgitator for the track &quot;The Song Formally Known As&quot; from their second album, &quot;Unit&quot;.

American alternative rock band the Bloodhound Gang sampled &quot;Get Up and Boogie&quot; for the main riff of their 1996 song &quot;Lift Your Head Up High (And Blow Your Brains Out)&quot;, released on their album &quot;One Fierce Beer Coaster&quot;.

<doc id="674085" wikidata="Q1606695" url="?curid=674085" title="Henry Dworshak">
<text>Henry Clarence Dworshak Jr. (August 29, 1894July 23, 1962) was a United States senator and congressman from Idaho. Originally from Minnesota, he was a Republican from Burley, and served over 22 years in the House and Senate.

==Early years==
Born in Duluth, Minnesota, Dworshak attended its local public schools and learned the printer&#x27;s trade. During the First World War, he served as a Sergeant in the U.S. Army Fourth Antiaircraft Machine Gun Battalion in the American Expeditionary Forces. After the war, Dworshak managed a printing supply business in Duluth.

He moved west in 1924 to Burley, Idaho, to become the publisher and editor of the &quot;Burley Bulletin,&quot; a semi-weekly newspaper in Cassia County. Dworshak became a public figure when he was elected president of the Idaho Editorial Association in 1931, and he was a prominent member of the American Legion and Rotary International. He was also a member of the Elks and a freemason.

==Congress==
===House===
Dworshak ran for Congress in 1936 in Idaho&#x27;s 2nd district, but lost to incumbent D. Worth Clark. Two years later, in 1938, Clark ran for U.S. senator and won, and Dworshak won the open House seat. He was re-elected in 1940, 1942, and 1944.

===Senate===
Republican senator John Thomas died in office in November 1945, and Democratic governor Charles C. Gossett resigned to accept an appointment (by his successor) to fill the seat. Gossett failed to secure the nomination for the special election; Dworshak defeated state senator George Donart in the November 1946 election to complete the term. Two years later, Dworshak was defeated for a full term in the 1948 general election by state supreme court justice and former state attorney general Bert H. Miller, he had defeated Miller ten years earlier.

Miller died of a heart attack in October 1949 after only nine months in office, and Dworshak was appointed his successor by Republican governor C. A. Robins. Dworshak won a special election in 1950, and was elected to full Senate terms in 1954 and 1960. A staunch isolationist like William Borah, Dworshak stood unwavering against overseas intervention, especially in U.S. affairs. Dworshak voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 and the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, but did not vote on the Civil Rights Act of 1960.

<text>Donald &quot;Majik&quot; Vincent Majkowski (born February 25, 1964) is an American former professional football player who was a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for the Green Bay Packers, Indianapolis Colts, and Detroit Lions. He played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers.

==College career==
Following graduation from the Fork Union Military Academy in central Virginia, Majkowski played college football at the University of Virginia in nearby Charlottesville. He became the starting quarterback for the Cavaliers partway into the 1983 season, his first year there. The next year, Majkowski led the Cavaliers to the school&#x27;s first ever bowl appearance and bowl win, in the Peach Bowl. During his college career, Majkowski wore jersey number one.

==Professional career==
===Green Bay Packers===
Majkowski was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the tenth round of the 1987 NFL draft. He was originally issued jersey #5, but switched to #7 the following season in anticipation that #5 would be retired for Paul Hornung. The jersey was never officially retired. As a rookie in 1987, he split time with Randy Wright, with whom he also shared quarterback duties in 1988. During the 1987 season Majkowski&#x27;s salary was $65,000; he also received a $10,000 roster bonus.

Nicknamed &quot;The Majik Man&quot;, Majkowski broke out during the 1989 season. He was given the starting job and Randy Wright was released. Majkowski had one of the finest seasons in Packers history, with 353 completed passes in 599 attempts. He also threw for 27 touchdowns, and his 4,318 passing yards led the NFL. Notably, the Packers won their first game against the hated rival Chicago Bears since 1984. The key was a touchdown play, first nullified by an illegal forward pass by Majkowski, then upheld by instant replay as a legal pass. The season ended with 10 wins and 6 losses; Majkowski capped the season with being selected to the Pro Bowl.

Majkowski signed a new one-year contract for over $1.5 million in September 1990, but his success was cut short in the tenth game of the season. He was injured when he was upended and tackled on his shoulder by Freddie Joe Nunn of the Phoenix Cardinals, who drew a personal foul on the play. At first thought to be a bruise, Majkowski&#x27;s injury turned out to be more serious, a torn rotator cuff. The Packers finished the season with backups Anthony Dilweg and Blair Kiel. During the 1991 season, Majkowski was benched by head coach Lindy Infante and replaced by Mike Tomczak as starter, but resumed starting duties at the beginning of 1992. On a play on September 20 against the Cincinnati Bengals, Majkowski tore a ligament in his ankle in the first quarter. He was replaced by 22-year-old Brett Favre, who completed the game, a one-point victory, and went on to start every Packers game through 2007. In 2005, Majkowski was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

===Indianapolis Colts===
After the Packers elected to keep Brett Favre as their starting quarterback and bench Majkowski, he decided to leave Green Bay after the 1992 season and signed with the Indianapolis Colts as a backup for two seasons.

===Detroit Lions===
Majkowski finished his football career with the Detroit Lions in 1995 and 1996 as a backup to starter Scott Mitchell. In his final season in 1996, Majkowski faced Favre and the Green Bay Packers on November 3, completing 15 of 32 passes for 153 yards, a touchdown and no interceptions in a 28–10 loss. He was also sacked five times. Majkowski&#x27;s final career start was two weeks later against the Seattle Seahawks at the Pontiac Silverdome. He went 18 for 23 (78% completion percentage) for 157 yards, one TD and one interception for a passer rating of 91.5. The Lions won the game, 17–16, and improved their record to 5–6. However, this was the Lions&#x27; last win of the season; Mitchell started the remaining five games, which the Lions lost to finish 5–11.

==NFL career statistics==
===Regular season===
===Playoffs===
==Personal life==
Majkowski lived in Johns Creek, Georgia with his family. He previously ran a real estate investment company, but sold it due to being unable to keep up with its demands because of a string of serious health issues related to his playing career. His son Bo played baseball at Clemson University.

In 2020, Majkowski and Aveion Cason filed a lawsuit against the NFL and the NFLPA over cuts made to their disability payments. It was dismissed in 2021 by U.S. District Court Judge Trevor N. McFadden.

<doc id="674090" wikidata="Q169141" url="?curid=674090" title="Cape Froward">
<text>Cape Froward () is the southernmost point of mainland South America. It is located in the Magallanes Region of Chile, along the north shore of Magellan Strait, being the southern tip of the Brunswick Peninsula. In January 1587, the English corsair Thomas Cavendish named the place after the region&#x27;s rough climate (strong rains and winds).

A large metallic cross (&quot;Cruz de los Mares&quot;, Cross of the Seas) was built on the cape&#x27;s hill in honor of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to Chile in 1987. It is the latest cross located on the site, the first of which was built in 1913 and replaced several times since then due to the harsh weather.

<text>A Taste of Honey is an American recording act, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1972 by associates Janice-Marie Johnson and Perry Kibble. In 1978, they had one of the best known chart-toppers of the disco era, &quot;Boogie Oogie Oogie&quot;. After their popularity waned during the 1980s, Johnson went on to record as a solo artist and released the album &quot;One Taste of Honey&quot;. In 2004, Johnson and Hazel Payne reunited to perform on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) specials &quot;Get Down Tonight: The Disco Explosion&quot; and &quot;My Music: Funky Soul Superstars&quot;. In 2022, A Taste of Honey featuring Johnson kicked off the celebration of 50 years of impact in the music and entertainment industries. A Taste of Honey now consists of Johnson and other musicians.

==Biography==
A Taste of Honey was formed in 1972. The band hailed from Los Angeles, California, United States. The members of the band consisted of Janice-Marie Johnson (vocals, co-writer, bass), Carlita Dorhan (vocals, guitar), Perry Kibble (keyboards, co-producer, co-writer) and Donald Ray Johnson (drums). Longtime friends Kibble and Janice-Marie Johnson were the original members of the band. Each had left a band to join forces, and after employing several drummers, they settled on Donald Johnson (no relation to Janice-Marie). Singer Greg Walker joined the band for a time before leaving in 1975 to join Santana. Carlita Dorhan left the band in early 1976, and Hazel Payne was added. 

The band began to improve its sound over a period of six years prior to being discovered by Capitol Records. Touring cities outside Los Angeles, they also began doing United Service Organizations tours, with performances in Spain, Morocco, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea and Japan. Upon returning to Los Angeles, while playing in a nightclub, they were spotted by record producers, Fonce and Larry Mizell, who convinced Capitol Records&#x27; then vice-executive-producer, Larkin Arnold, to give them an audition. They signed a five-album contract, and billed themselves after Herb Alpert&#x27;s song, &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;. The first single, &quot;Boogie Oogie Oogie&quot;, from their debut album &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot;, spent three weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1978, and sold two million copies. A Taste of Honey was awarded two platinum records for the single and album, and won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the 20th Grammys on February 15, 1979. Janice-Marie Johnson calls the single her &quot;lifeline&quot; and credits Capitol Records executive, Larkin Arnold, with ensuring they owned their own publishing. Their subsequent disco releases, such as &quot;Do It Good&quot; (number 79 in 1979) from &quot;Another Taste&quot;, and &quot;Rescue Me&quot; (1980) failed to attract attention, and by 1980 the group had become a duo consisting of Janice-Marie Johnson and Payne.

When recording their cover version of the Kyu Sakamoto song &quot;Sukiyaki&quot;, from their third album, &quot;Twice as Sweet&quot; (1980), they resisted suggestions to turn it into a dance tune. As a ballad it brought them their second and final major hit of their careers in 1981, when it reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B and Adult Contemporary charts and number 3 on the Hot 100.

A Taste of Honey released their fourth and final album, &quot;Ladies of the Eighties&quot; in 1982. It featured their final Billboard Hot 100 single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Try Something New&quot; (number 41). This cover of the Smokey Robinson and the Miracles hit from 1962 also went to number 9 on the R&amp;B charts and number 29 on the Adult Contemporary.

While preparing to record their fifth album in 1983, Payne left the group and Janice-Marie Johnson went on to record as a solo artist to fulfill contractual obligations, releasing &quot;One Taste of Honey&quot;, which produced the single &quot;Love Me Tonight&quot;, a minor hit on the R&amp;B chart. Payne went on to become an international stage actress.

Upon moving to Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in the early 1990s to play in local night clubs and to write music for a television production, Kibble married a local music teacher, Anne-Marie LaMonde, in 1993, and became stepfather to her three children, Natalie, Marci and Gregory Pilkington. Kibble died in February 1999 of heart failure, at the age of 49. Donald Ray Johnson continues to live and play blues in Calgary, where he also married a local. Johnson released several blues albums under his own name. The following year, Janice-Marie Johnson released her second solo album, &quot;Hiatus of the Heart&quot;. In 2004, Payne and Janice-Marie Johnson reunited for the first time in over twenty years to perform on the PBS specials &quot;Get Down Tonight: The Disco Explosion&quot; and &quot;My Music: Funky Soul Superstars&quot;.

Janice-Marie Johnson was inducted in the Native American Music Association Hall of Fame in 2008.

Guitarist Suzanne &quot;Minnie&quot; Thomas died on June 15, 2015, at the age of 60.

<text>The 1981 New Zealand general election, held on 28 November 1981, was a nationwide vote to determine the shape of the 40th New Zealand Parliament. It saw the governing National Party, led by Robert Muldoon, win a third term in office, but the opposition Labour Party, led by Bill Rowling, won the largest share of the votes cast. 

Social Credit also won over 20% of the vote – their best result ever – but received no new seats. This was also the highest ever vote a party other then Labour or National have ever received.

This was the second consecutive election in which National lost the popular vote to Labour. More electorates were rural and right-leaning than urban and progressive, and therefore National benefitted under the first-past-the-post electoral system. That the unpopular Muldoon was able to continue to govern was a major catalyst for the growing public desire to reform New Zealand&#x27;s electoral system. This happened within fifteen years, when the 1996 election was the first to use mixed-member proportional representation.

Notable MPs first elected at this election include future Labour Party leader and mayor of Auckland Phil Goff, the first Māori Speaker of the House Peter Tapsell, future Finance Minister Michael Cullen, and future Prime Minister Helen Clark. Future Minister of Foreign Affairs and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters lost his seat of Hunua at this election to Colin Moyle of the Labour Party, whom Robert Muldoon had aggressively accused of being gay as part of a McCarthyist smear campaign in 1977.

==Background==
Before the election, the National Party governed with 50 seats, while the opposition Labour Party held 40 seats. The Social Credit Party held two seats (one of which they took from National in a 1980 by-election). The National Party had won a landslide victory in the 1975 election, then lost ground in the 1978 election, but remained in government. The style of Robert Muldoon&#x27;s leadership was growing increasingly unpopular, both with his party and with the public, and there had been an abortive leadership challenge by Brian Talboys in 1980. Some commentators believed that the 1981 election would mark an end to Muldoon&#x27;s government.

The Labour Party was led by Bill Rowling, who had been leader of the party in the past two elections. While Rowling had performed poorly against Muldoon in 1975, and was generally viewed by the public as weak, he had gradually recovered a measure of public respect. In 1980, Rowling survived a leadership challenge by David Lange. In the 1978 election, Labour had won a plurality of the vote, but did not win a majority of the seats. Many believed that this time, Labour would manage to convert its support into seats, although that did prove not to be the case.

Not all of Muldoon&#x27;s opponents gave their support to Rowling and the Labour Party, however. The small Social Credit Party, New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;third party&quot;, was enjoying strong support, although the first-past-the-post electoral system made it difficult for them to win seats. After the 1980 East Coast Bays by-election, Social Credit support rose as high as 30% in opinion polls, but then declined.

Some pundits have since claimed that the Springbok Tour increased votes for National in provincial electorates, despite the tour not being seen as a major election issue.

===MPs retiring in 1981===
Five National MPs and seven Labour MPs intended to retire at the end of the 39th Parliament.

==Election day==
The election was held on 28 November. 2,034,747 people were registered to vote, and 91.4% turned out. That was a markedly higher turnout than recorded for the previous election, but as the official statistics for that election are regarded as highly misleading, the comparison is probably not valid. It is likely that turnout in the 1981 election was about the same as in the election before it.

==Summary of results==
The 1981 election saw the National Party win 47 of the 92 seats in parliament, a drop of three from before the election (National lost Hunua, Kapiti, Miramar and Wellington Central but won Taupo). This meant that National kept its majority by only a single seat, which became highly problematic over the next parliamentary term. The Labour Party won 43 seats, a gain of three (Labour won Hunua, Kapiti, Miramar and Wellington Central but lost Taupo). The Social Credit Party managed to retain its two seats, East Coast Bays and Rangitikei. No party initially held a majority until a recount flipped the seat of Gisborne from Labour to National, which gave National a working majority of one.

For the second election in a row, Labour won more votes than National, but fewer seats, allowing National to retain government despite not winning the popular vote. Social Credit won more than 20% of the popular vote but only two seats. This result, and that of 1978, contributed to New Zealand adopting the Mixed Member Proportional system of proportional representation in the 1990s.

===Summary of changes===
*The seats of Hunua, Kapiti, Miramar and Wellington Central were won from incumbent National MPs by Labour challengers. The challengers in question were Colin Moyle, Margaret Shields, Peter Neilson and Fran Wilde, respectively. The defeated incumbents were Winston Peters, Barry Brill, Bill Young and Ken Comber, respectively.
*The seat of Taupo was won from the incumbent Labour MP by a National challenger. The challenger was Roger McClay and the defeated incumbent was Jack Ridley.
*The seats of Heretaunga, Mt. Albert, Napier, Palmerston North, Roskill, St. Kilda and Northern Maori passed from incumbent Labour MPs to new Labour MPs.
*In Nelson, Mel Courtney achieved the best result by an Independent candidate in a New Zealand election in nearly forty years.
*The seats of Fendalton, Hauraki, Selwyn and Whangarei passed from incumbent National MPs to new National MPs. Two of these changes were the result of MPs retiring, but two (in Selwyn and Whangarei) were the result of controversial challenges to the re-selection of the incumbents. In Selwyn, Ruth Richardson successfully challenged the re-nomination of incumbent Colin McLachlan, and in Whangarei, John Banks successfully challenged the re-nomination of incumbent John Elliott.

<text>Zincite is the mineral form of zinc oxide (ZnO). Its crystal form is rare in nature; a notable exception to this is at the Franklin and Sterling Hill Mines in New Jersey, an area also famed for its many fluorescent minerals. It has a hexagonal crystal structure and a color that depends on the presence of impurities. The zincite found at the Franklin Furnace is red-colored, mostly due to iron and manganese dopants, and associated with willemite and franklinite.
Zincite crystals can be grown artificially, and synthetic zincite crystals are available as a by-product of zinc smelting. Synthetic crystals can be colorless or can range in color from dark red, orange, or yellow to light green. 
Both natural and synthetic zincite crystals are significant for their early use as semiconductor crystal detectors in the early development of crystal radios before the advent of vacuum tubes. As an early radio detector it was used in conjunction with another mineral, galena, and this device was known as the cat&#x27;s-whisker detector.

<text>In family law in the United Kingdom implacable hostility denotes the attitude shown by one parent to another in denying access to, or contact with, their child(ren) after separation or divorce. What differentiates &quot;implacable hostility&quot; from the typical hostility that may arise after separation/divorce is that the deep-rooted nature of the hostility cannot be justified on rational grounds and measures taken by third parties including mediators and the family courts are to no avail.

<doc id="674125" wikidata="Q605336" url="?curid=674125" title="Boeing C-135 Stratolifter">
<text>The Boeing C-135 Stratolifter is a transport aircraft derived from the prototype Boeing 367-80 jet airliner (also the basis for the 707) in the early 1950s. It has a narrower fuselage and is shorter than the 707. Boeing gave the aircraft the internal designation of Model 717, a name later assigned to a completely different aircraft.

Since the first one was built in August 1956, the C-135 and its variants have been a fixture of the United States Air Force.

It was developed from the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker.

==Origins and operational history==
In the early 1960s, the Military Air Transport Service operated a fleet consisting almost entirely of propeller-driven aircraft such as the piston-powered Douglas C-124 Globemaster II and C-133 Cargomaster turboprop. While capable of carrying large, outsized payloads, they were becoming increasingly obsolescent and lacked the global reach required of the rapidly-modernizing Air Force. In May 1960, Congress approved the purchase of 50 C-135 aircraft; it was selected in part because of its low development cost, being a straightforward derivative of the KC-135 tanker already in production. Ultimately, only 15 C-135As would be produced (in addition to three converted from KC-135s while still on the assembly line), with 30 additional aircraft being delivered as C-135Bs with the improved Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33 turbofan engine.

The C-135 was largely intended as an interim measure pending the development of more specialized jet transports such as the Lockheed C-141 Starlifter, and as such it incorporated numerous compromises in its strategic airlift capability. The aircraft&#x27;s load floor was some off the ground, which required ground-handling equipment, its single side-loading cargo door was limited in what could fit through it, and its useful range was approximately , insufficient to reach many of the Air Force&#x27;s operating locations in Asia and the Pacific Rim. While range was greatly improved over earlier transports, it could not be augmented by aerial refueling, as C-135s were not configured with refueling receptacles. Additionally, its takeoff and landing performance required long runways available only at the largest military bases or commercial airports, which were not necessarily located in close proximity to potential combat areas.

The Lockheed C-141 entered front-line service in April 1965, which finally gave MATS and its successor, Military Airlift Command, the strategic airlift capability it needed. By the early 1970s, the C-135 fleet had been modified and relegated to other duties, which included staff/VIP transport, systems testing, and strategic reconnaissance.

==Variants==
The large majority of the 820 airframes of this type built were KC-135A Stratotankers, equipped to provide mid-air refueling to other aircraft. Forty-five base-model aircraft were built as C-135A or C-135B transports with the tanking equipment excluded; three more aircraft originally ordered as KC-135A were factory converted to C-135A. The C-135/KC-135 type was also known internally at Boeing as the Model 717, a name later assigned to a completely different aircraft.

===C-135A/E===
Eighteen C-135As (Boeing model number &quot;717-157&quot;), powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojets, were built. In later years, almost all were upgraded with Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33 turbofan engines and wide-span horizontal stabilizers, and were re-designated C-135E. Most were converted to various special roles, including airborne command posts, missile-tracking platforms, and VIP transports, and were withdrawn throughout the 1990s. The C-135E designation was also applied to EC-135Ns that were used in the combat support role.

===C-135B===
Thirty C-135Bs (Boeing model number &quot;717-158&quot;) were built new with the TF33 turbofan and improved wide-span horizontal stabilizers. Ten were modified for a weather reconnaissance (flying through radioactive clouds from nuclear tests or other agents) role and designated WC-135B Stratolifter (Constant Phoenix in later versions). Additional airframes were converted to RC-135s from the 1970s to 2006, and remain in service with further equipment upgrades installed.

===C-135C===
The C-135C designation applies to three WC-135B (originally converted from C-135B) weather reconnaissance aircraft, which were de-modified to transport status. Most of the other C-135Bs were converted to various special mission variants following their service with the Military Airlift Command. C-135Cs also retained their air refueling receptacle, added during modifications to WC-135 standard.

Although most of the remaining C-135 aircraft are used for transporting senior military leaders and other high-ranking dignitaries, the C-135C communications aircraft serves as an aerial test-bed for emerging technologies. Developmental tests using this aircraft have demonstrated the capability to fly precision approaches using a local area differential GPS system. This modified C-135 has been fitted with a millimeter wave camera and a radome to test the camera&#x27;s generation of video images of the forward scene in low-visibility conditions. The aircraft, which in the VIP/Distinguished Visitor (DV) transport role seats 14 passengers, also gives a Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) a limited ability to plan and control the simulated battle while in the air en route to the crisis area.

====Speckled Trout====
Speckled Trout is the official name of a combined SAF/CSAF support mission and concurrent test mission. It was also the official nickname given to a modified C-135C, serial number 61–2669, that was used by the Secretary and the Chief of Staff of the Air Force for executive transport requirements. Fully equipped with an array of communications equipment, data links and cryptographic sets, the aircraft served a secondary role as a testbed for proposed command and control systems and was also used to evaluate future transport aircraft design. The 412th Flight Test Squadron (412 FLTS) of the Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) at Edwards AFB, California operated the C-135 Speckled Trout airframe and managed its test mission.

The name &quot;Speckled Trout&quot; applies to both the organization and the aircraft. The name was chosen in honor of an early program monitor, Faye Trout, who assisted in numerous phases of the project. Trout reportedly had many freckles, hence the addition of &quot;Speckled.&quot;

Speckled Trout acquired the C-135C, serial number 61–2669, in 1974 and retired the aircraft on 13 January 2006. An interim aircraft was in use for the Speckled Trout mission until the 2008 delivery of the current aircraft, a modified KC-135R Stratotanker serial number 63–7980 with a more modern communications architecture testbed. The current KC-135R Speckled Trout also supports additional tests and air refueling requirements that the C-135C could not.

===C-135F===
C-135F (Boeing model number &quot;717-164&quot;) was new-built variant for France as a dual-role tanker/cargo and troop carrier aircraft. 12 were built for the French Air Force with the addition of a drogue adapter on the refueling boom. 11 surviving C-135Fs upgraded to C-135FRs with CFM International F108 turbofans between 1985 and 1988. Later modified with MPRS wing pods.

===C-135K===
One former EC-135K modified for VIP use for CINCPAC.

==Accidents and incidents==
*23 October 1962: A USAF/MATS C-135B (serial number 62-4136) stalled and crashed on approach to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba after a flight from McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. All seven crew members aboard were killed.
*11 May 1964: A USAF/MATS C-135B, (serial number 61-0332), was on a Military Air Transport Service (MATS) flight from Fairfield-Travis AFB, CA (SUU) to Clark AB in the Philippines via Honolulu-Hickam AFB, HI (HIK). Thunderstorms were in the area as the flight approached Clark AB. An indefinite ceiling was at 300 feet and visibility was 2000 m. The crew carried out a Precision approach radar (PAR) approach to runway 02. The aircraft descended below the glidepath and the crew were urged to initiate go around as the C-135 had descended below the PAR lower safety limit. By then, the co-pilot had the runway in sight and the approach was continued. On final, the undercarriage struck the perimeter fence. The airplane struck a TACAN facility, hit the ground and slid across a road, striking a cab and killing the driver. The airplane broke up and caught fire. Five of the ten crewmembers and all 74 passengers were fatally injured, along with the unfortunate cab driver.
*25 June 1965: A USAF/MATS C-135A, (serial number 60-0373), carrying 85 US Marine Corps personnel was flying from MCAS El Toro to Okinawa. Weather was poor at El Toro when the airplane was ready to depart: thick fog and light drizzle. Takeoff was accomplished at night at 01:45 from runway 34R. After takeoff, the pilot should have made a prescribed left turn. Instead, the airplane continued straight ahead. It contacted the 1,300-foot Loma Ridge, some 150 feet below the crest. The aircraft broke up and burst into flames. The crash killed all 12 crewmembers and 72 other personnel on board.

<text>The Australia First Party (AFP), officially known as the Australia First Party (NSW) Incorporated, is an Australian nationalist political party founded in 1996 by Graeme Campbell, a former member of the Australian Labor Party. The policies of the party have been described as nationalist, anti-multicultural and economically protectionist, advocating for strict immigration controls, the prioritization of Australian citizens in employment, and the promotion of Australian culture and values. The party&#x27;s logo includes the Southern Cross of the Eureka Flag.

The AFP&#x27;s current leader, Jim Saleam, is a Lebanese Australian, a convicted arsonist, a former member of the National Socialist Party of Australia and founder of the militant Australian white nationalist group National Action. The party has been accused of having ties with fascism and neo-Nazism. In October 2022, the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism (GPAHE) released a report in which it classified the AFP as a &quot;white nationalist&quot; and &quot;anti-immigrant&quot; group.

As of July 2024, the party is only registered for local government elections with the New South Wales Electoral Commission (NSWEC) as &quot;Australia First Party (NSW) Incorporated (Councils)&quot;.

== History ==
===Campbell era ===
The Australia First Party was established in June 1996 by Graeme Campbell, and registered as a political party by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on 13 September 1996. Campbell had been the federal Labor member for Kalgoorlie since 1980. However, he was disendorsed by Labor in 1995, and continued to sit in parliament as an independent. He was reelected as an independent at the 1996 Australian federal election, and formed AFP soon after. However, AFP was not successful at the 1998 federal election and Campbell lost his seat, blaming his loss on Australia First being eclipsed by One Nation. In 2009, he claimed that, if not for the presence of a One Nation candidate, he would have picked up an additional 8.5% of the vote, which would have been enough to keep him in the race.

Campbell remained Australia First&#x27;s leader until June 2001, when he left the party to stand (unsuccessfully) as a One Nation Senate candidate in Western Australia. At the 2004 federal election, Campbell attempted unsuccessfully to regain his old federal seat as an independent. He again stood for the Senate in Western Australia at the 2007 federal election as an independent, but only achieved 0.13% of the vote.

===Saleam era===

Saleam has served two jail terms, one for property offences and fraud in 1984 and one for being an accessory before the fact in 1989 for his involvement in the shotgun attack on the home of African National Congress representative Eddie Funde.

In 2002, Jim Saleam ran as an AFP candidate for a seat on Marrickville council, New South Wales, claiming &quot;to oppose Marrickville being a Refugee Welcome Zone&quot;. Later that year the party formed its youth wing, the Patriotic Youth League. 
AFP was deregistered by the AEC on 13 August 2004 for failing to nominate candidates at elections for four years. By 2007, Saleam had reestablished AFP, and in July 2009, Saleam claimed that the party had 500 members, and announced that he was registering its New South Wales branch, Australia First Party (NSW) Incorporated, with the AEC. The branch was registered by AEC on 13 June 2010, in time for the 2010 federal election.

At the 2013 federal election, AFP was involved in Glenn Druery&#x27;s Minor Party Alliance. Saleam stood in the seat of Cook on a platform to end refugee intakes, running against Scott Morrison, and received 617 votes, or 0.67% of the vote.

On 14 July 2015, the AEC de-registered the AFP due to its failure to demonstrate the required 500 members. It was re-registered on 1 March 2016 as &quot;Australia First Party (NSW) Incorporated&quot;.

AFP contested the 2016 federal election, without any success. Saleam stood in the seat of Lindsay, New South Wales, receiving 1068 votes or 1.2% of the vote. In October 2016, the Australia First Party joined with the Australian Protectionist Party, Nationalist Alternative, Eureka Youth League, and Hellenic Nationalists of Australia to form the Australian Coalition of Nationalists, as a framework for cooperation between these entities.

Saleam also stood for AFP in the 2018 Longman by-election, receiving 709 votes or 0.8% of the vote.

Saleam stood in the seat of Cootamundra, New South Wales, in the 2017 by-election as an independent, though still a member of Australia First, as the party was not registered for NSW elections. He received 453 votes, 1% of the total. He again stood in the seat at the 2019 New South Wales state election as an independent. Saleam&#x27;s platform included the reintroduction of the White Australia policy and opposition to Chinese immigration.

On 2 May 2014, the party aligned itself with the Golden Dawn party of Greece, an ultranationalist organisation, and on 24 July 2016, the party endorsed former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke for the 2016 Louisiana election via Twitter.

On 12 January 2022, the party was de-registered by the Australian Electoral Commission for failing to meet the increased requirement of 1,500 members.

==Policies and electoral performance==

The party stands on a nationalist, anti-multicultural and economic protectionist platform. It advocates for strict immigration controls, the prioritization of Australian citizens in employment, and the protection of national sovereignty. The party follows eight core policies in their programme:

*Ensure Australia retains full independence.
*Rebuild Australian manufacturing industries.
*Control foreign ownership.
*Reduce and limit immigration.
*Abolish multiculturalism.
*Introduce Citizen&#x27;s Initiated Referendums.
*Strengthen the family.
*Strive to rebuild a united Australia.
The Australia First Party has been largely unsuccessful electorally. It has been elected to two local council seats, one in City of Penrith and one in City of Prospect. Saleam ran as a candidate in the 2018 Longman by-election, receiving 684 votes or 0.8% of the vote.

In the 2019 Australian federal election, the party put up three candidates: Susan Jakobi in Lalor, Peter Schubeck for Longman, and Michael Chehoff for Swan.

== Activities ==

The Australia First Party&#x27;s activities have mainly consisted of distributing anti-immigration and racist pamphlets and protesting, although they denied involvement in some highly racist leaflets dropped in mailboxes in 2010 Campbelltown.

===Cronulla riots (2005)===
The group played a large role in the 2005 Cronulla riots. In the week prior to the riots, the AFP encouraged members to go to the seaside suburb of Cronulla. Its website called for &quot;patriots&quot; to show solidarity with victims of &quot;anti-Australian race and hate and violence&quot;. AFP claim that 120 members and supporters attended the riots, and both members of the AFP and their youth wing the Patriotic Youth League were seen handing out anti-immigration leaflets and supplying alcohol there. Their website later described the riots as a &quot;civil uprising of the Australian people&quot;.

===Nathan Sykes arrest===
On 20 March 2019, Australia First member Nathan Sykes, described as a &quot;prolific online troll and a lieutenant of Australia&#x27;s most prominent white supremacist Jim Saleam&quot;, was charged with at least eight offences, after allegations that he made repeated and detailed violent threats to Melbourne journalist and lawyer Luke McMahon. He had previously made numerous racist and intimidating online comments targeting high-profile Australians, including ex-Racial Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane, activist Mariam Veiszadeh and Guardian journalist Van Badham.

==Patriotic/Eureka Youth League==
The Patriotic Youth League was formed in 2002 by former One Nation activist Stuart McBeth as the youth wing of the Australia First Party. It was described by numerous media commentators and academics as a far right, white nationalist youth organisation that has been linked to neo-Nazism, including the now-disbanded US-based Volksfront, and hate crimes.

The group was mainly active in the northern suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, and played a large role in the 2005 Cronulla riots. They distributed white power leaflets in the days prior to the riots, displayed banners saying &quot;Aussies fighting back&quot; at the riots, and also distributed pamphlets and alcohol during the riots.

The league disbanded in 2006, but was reincarnated as the Eureka Youth League in 2010 (not to be confused with the historical Eureka Youth League). , the Eureka Youth League has a website and Facebook group; however, the last post on the latter was in October 2017.

== Racism allegations ==
Australia First Party is led by convicted criminal and far-right activist Jim Saleam. Saleam was a member of the short-lived National Socialist Party of Australia as a teenager during the early 1970s and the founder of the militant Australian white nationalist group National Action.

Australia First also endorsed independent candidate John Moffat, who was later criticised by B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Anti-Defamation Commission chairman Michael Lipshutz, Cronulla Liberal MLA Malcolm Kerr and Lebanese Muslim Association spokesman Jihad Dib for &quot;inciting racial hatred&quot;.

On 10 July 2009, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that David Palmer, the Imperial Wizard of the &quot;Ku Klux Klan&quot; in Australia, said several Klan members had secretly joined Australia First. Palmer said Australia First had been identified as an Aryan party and would prove useful &quot;in case the ethnics get out of hand and they need sorting out.&quot; The Australia First Party later endorsed former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke for the 2016 Louisiana election via Twitter.

In July 2010, it was reported that Australia First was distributing leaflets comparing Africans to monkeys, and &quot;blaming Africans for the social problems in Sydney&#x27;s west&quot;. Australia First denied responsibility for the leaflets, claiming that they had been distributed in an attempt to discredit the party.

The Australia First Party used Sinophobia and fear of African Australians in their campaign during the 2019 election.

<text>Ronald Owen Perelman (; born January 1, 1943) is an American banker, businessman, investor, and philanthropist. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Incorporated, his company, has invested in companies with interests in groceries, cigars, licorice, makeup, cars, photography, television, camping supplies, security, gaming, jewelry, banks, and comic book publishing. Perelman holds significant shares in companies such as Deluxe Entertainment, Revlon, SIGA Technologies, RetailMeNot, Merisant, Scantron, Scientific Games Corporation, Valassis, vTv Therapeutics and Harland Clarke. He previously owned a majority of shares in AM General, but in 2020 sold the majority of his shares in AM General along with significant works of art, in light of the impact of the economy on the high debt burdens many of his companies have from leveraged buyouts. In early 2020, Revlon, acquired by Perelman in the 1980s, undertook a debt deal.
Previously worth $19.8 billion in 2018, Perelman is, as of November 2022, worth $1.9 billion.

==Early life and education==
Perelman was born in Greensboro, North Carolina, on January 1, 1943, the son of Ruth (née Caplan) and Raymond G. Perelman. He was raised in a Jewish family in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, and is the grandson of Litvak (Lithuanian Jewish) immigrants. With family members, he managed the American Paper Products Corporation. Raymond eventually left the company and bought Belmont Iron Works, a manufacturer of structural steel.

Perelman graduated from The Haverford School in Haverford, Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania in 1962.

From his father, Perelman learned the fundamentals of business. By the time Ronald turned eleven years old he regularly sat in on board meetings of his father&#x27;s company. A 2006 article published in the Forbes 400 discusses their rough relationship in detail.

Perelman first attended the Villanova School of Business for one semester before transferring to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he majored in business. He earned his MBA from Wharton in 1966.

In September 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine named Perelman as one of the &quot;100 Greatest Living Business Minds&quot;.

==Business career==
===Belmont Industries===
Perelman&#x27;s first major business deal took place in 1961 during his Freshman year at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He and his father bought the Esslinger Brewery for $800,000, then sold it three years later for a $1 million profit.

Throughout Perelman&#x27;s tenure at the Belmont Iron Works (later renamed Belmont Industries) he assisted his father on other deals. Their general strategy was to purchase a company, sell off superfluous divisions to reduce debt and generate profit, bring the company back to its core business, and either sell it or hang onto it for cash flow. In 1978, twelve years after Perelman formally joined Belmont Industries, he was the vice president but he still strove for more power and influence in the company. His father Raymond told him that he had no intention of stepping down anytime soon. Perelman resigned and moved to New York. The two barely spoke to one another for the next six years.

===MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Incorporated===
He orchestrated the purchase of Cohen-Hatfield Jewelers in 1978, his first deal as an independent investor free of his father&#x27;s influence and took a loan from his wife, Faith Golding. Within a year, Perelman had sold all of the company&#x27;s retail locations and reduced the company to its lucrative wholesale jewelry division, earning him $15 million.

Perelman acquired MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate. He faced resistance from the management and investors who filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to prevent the acquisition, but Perelman prevailed. In 1983, Perelman started selling bonds to acquire the remaining 66% stake in MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Group Inc. to take MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Group Inc. private.

Also in 1983, MacAndrews had acquired Technicolor Inc. Despite the bond debt, in 1984, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes purchased Consolidated Cigar Holdings Ltd. from Gulf &amp; Western Industries, in addition to Video Corporation of America. The Technicolor Inc. divisions were sold off and, in 1988, its core business was sold to Carlton Communications for 6.5 times the purchase price. Using the proceeds from the Technicolor division sell off, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes purchased a 20 percent stake in Compact Video Inc., a television and film syndication company. Ronald Perelman&#x27;s controlling buyout of Compact Video was in 1986.

In 1989, Perelman acquired New World Entertainment, with David Charnay&#x27;s Four Star Television becoming a unit of Ronald Perelman&#x27;s Compact Video, later that year. Ownership of Compact Video Inc. was increased to 40% in 1989 after the buyout of Four Star International. After Compact shut down, its remaining assets, including Four Star, were folded into MacAndrews and Forbes Incorporated. In 1989, Perelman also acquired New World Entertainment with Four Star becoming a division of New World as part of the transaction. Four Star International was purchased through a golden parachute deal that was negotiated with David Charnay by Ronald Perelman after Charnay was notified of stock purchases made by Perelman in 1989. By the end of 1989, MacAndrews refinanced the Holding companies&#x27; junk bonds for standard bank loans. The bulk of New World&#x27;s film and home video holdings were sold in January 1990 to Trans-Atlantic Pictures, a newly formed production company founded by a consortium of former New World executives.

His company MacAndrews &amp; Forbes became a holding company with interests in a diversified portfolio of public and private companies and was still wholly owned by Perelman, who served as its chairman and chief executive officer. In 1989, one of the company&#x27;s holdings was Marvel Comics, which under Perelman&#x27;s watch declared bankruptcy; he sold off Marvel in 1997. MacAndrews &amp; Forbes&#x27;s current holdings include Deluxe, Revlon, SIGA Technologies, VTV, and as of late 2019, 39% of Scientific Games. However, as of Q3 2019, the company had hired Goldman Sachs to help review strategic alternatives for Revlon.

He has also done deals with Revlon Corporation, thrifts for $315 million and renamed it First Gibraltar Bank, Coleman Company, Sunbeam Products, and New World Entertainment.

===Morgan Stanley===
On February 17, 2005, Perelman filed a lawsuit against Morgan Stanley. Two facts were at issue: did Morgan Stanley know about the problems with Sunbeam, and was Perelman misled? After a five-week trial, the jury deliberated for two days, found in favor of Perelman, and awarded him $1.45 billion. The damages stung particularly because Morgan Stanley passed up Perelman&#x27;s offer to settle the case for $20 million. Morgan Stanley maintained that the court case was improperly decided, citing the judge&#x27;s decision to use Florida law over New York law and her decision to order the jury to consider Morgan Stanley guilty before the trial began. In 2007, the court of appeals reversed the judgement. The judges declared Perelman hadn&#x27;t provided any evidence showing he&#x27;d suffered any actual damage as a result of Morgan Stanley&#x27;s actions. Perelman appealed, but found himself shot down by the Florida Supreme Court who dismissed it in a 5–0 decision. Undeterred even after that setback, Perelman went back to the trial court and asked for the case to be reopened because the hiding of email evidence was &quot;a classic example of fraud on the court&quot;. The trial court rejected his arguments, but as of January 2009, he is beseeching Florida&#x27;s 4th Circuit to reopen the case.

&quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported on September 18, 2020, that Perelman had sold his Gulfstream 650, as well as his 257-foot yacht.

==Philanthropy==
===Personal donations===
Perelman was a funder of the election campaign of Donald Trump, giving US$125,000 to Trump Victory in September 2017. In 2015, Perelman donated $500,000 each to Super PACs supporting the presidential candidacies of Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush.

In 1995, Perelman donated to Princeton University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Institute for Judaic Studies. Other notable donations include $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania for naming rights to the quadrangle, $10 million to New York University to create the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Dermatology, $4.7 million to Princeton University to create the Ronald Perelman Institute for Jewish Studies, and $20 million to the Guggenheim Museum. From 2006 through 2008, Perelman donated $63.5 million to causes including, but not limited to: Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Stand Up to Cancer (SU2C), World Trade Center Memorial Fund and Ford&#x27;s Theatre, Carnegie Hall and the World Trade Center Memorial. In February 2008, Perelman made a $50 million donation to the New York Presbyterian Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Heart Institute, and to provide vital financial aid to the Ronald O. Perelman and Claudia Cohen Center for Reproductive Medicine.

Perelman serves as a member of the board of directors of the Police Athletic League of New York City, a nonprofit youth development agency serving inner-city children and teenagers. On June 3, 2011, Perelman was honored for his charitable contributions at the New York Police Foundation&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Gala at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City—an event that raised $2.3 million for charity.

Since 2013, Perelman donated $50 million to the NYU Langone Medical Center to create the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Emergency Services, $25 million to the University of Pennsylvania to create a new Center for its Economics and Political Science Departments, $100 million to the Columbia Business School, the graduate business school of Columbia University. The gift will be used to support the construction of new facilities in Manhattanville, including the Ronald O. Perelman Center for Business Innovation. and donated $75 million to revive plans to build a performing arts center at the World Trade Center site.

In May 2015, Perelman succeeded Sanford I. Weill as Chairman of Carnegie Hall, and since 2010 he has also hosted annual benefits for the Apollo Theater, raising millions of dollars annually for the legendary venue.

In August 2021, Princeton University announced that it would no longer name a newly constructed student dormitory for Perelman after the family foundation failed to make payments on a pledged $65 million donation.

==Controversy==
===Greenmail===
In the late 1980s, Perelman was accused of engaging in greenmail. &quot;Greenmail&quot; occurs when someone buys a large block of a company&#x27;s stock and threatens to take over the company unless he is paid a substantial premium over his purchase price. In the case of someone with a reputation as a corporate raider, the mere act of buying up shares could send a company into a panic and investors into a buying frenzy. Perelman insists he seriously intended to buy every corporation he bought into.

He was first accused of greenmail in late 1986 during a run at CPC International when he bought 8.2% of CPC at around $75 a share and indirectly sold it back to CPC through Salomon Brothers a month later at $88.5 a share for a $40 million profit. Both CPC and Perelman denied it was greenmail despite appearances to the contrary, including what looked like an artificial price increase by Salomon shortly before they sold Perelman&#x27;s shares.

Another accusation of greenmailing levied against him was the best-known and stemmed from his attempt to purchase Gillette in November 1986. Perelman opened negotiations with a bid of $4.12 billion. Gillette responded with an unsuccessful lawsuit and public insinuations of insider trading. Perelman accumulated 13.8% of Gillette before he made what he would later call the worst decision he ever made and sold his stake to Gillette later that month for a $34 million profit. Gillette had put word out that Ralston Purina had agreed to buy a 20% block of stock, making any attempt by Perelman to buy Gillette much more difficult. Perelman decided to sell his share to Ralston Purina, but before he did so Gillette&#x27;s executives called him up, asking if he&#x27;d sell his shares to them and they&#x27;d sell the shares to Ralston Purina. He sold his shares to Gillette and Ralston backed out of the deal.

===Panavision===
In April 2001, M&amp;F Worldwide bought Perelman&#x27;s 83% stake in Panavision for $128 million. This would be unremarkable except that Perelman controlled M&amp;F Worldwide and the price paid for his stake was four times market value. At the time, M&amp;F Worldwide was a healthy company with an excellent balance sheet while Panavision was bleeding red ink. M&amp;F Worldwide&#x27;s other shareholders cried foul, alleging the only person who stood to benefit from the deal was Perelman and took their complaints to the courts. Perelman insisted the deal was an excellent one and in the best interest of the shareholders because Panavision was well-positioned to profit from the move to digital cinematography. The share price tumbled from six to three after the deal and reflected M&amp;F Worldwide shareholders&#x27; lack of confidence. Perelman tried to pacify M&amp;F Worldwide&#x27;s shareholders with a $15 million settlement, but the judge rejected it as grossly inadequate. Ultimately, Perelman agreed to undo the deal.

===Fred Tepperman===
Perelman hired Fred Tepperman as his CFO after Tepperman left Warner Communications in 1985. Starting with Pantry Pride, Tepperman worked on every single business deal Perelman orchestrated throughout Tepperman&#x27;s seven-year stint at MacAndrews &amp; Forbes. Tepperman&#x27;s tenure came to an abrupt end just after Christmas in 1991 when Perelman fired him for being derelict in his duties. Tepperman had been distracted, he claimed, by caring for his Alzheimer&#x27;s-afflicted wife of 30 years. A clause in Tepperman&#x27;s contract entitled him to a large portion of his salary and benefits in the event of an injury that prevented him from being able to work; Tepperman claimed he had suffered such an injury, albeit psychologically, as a result of the effect his wife&#x27;s condition had on him. His demands totaled $30 million. That number stems partially from Tepperman&#x27;s salary, which started at $275,000 and rose to $1.2 million in 1990 and partially from his large benefits package. Perelman was quick to file a countersuit for fraud, claiming that Tepperman had sneakily changed the company&#x27;s retirement plan in such a way that Tepperman would personally gain millions of dollars. It took over three years for the case to make it to court. The case ended with a sealed settlement.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Perelman has been married five times. He married Sterling Bank heiress Faith Golding in 1965 and they divorced in 1984. His marriage to gossip columnist Claudia Cohen lasted from 1985 to 1994. He married socialite Patricia Duff in 1995 and divorced in 1996. He was married to actress Ellen Barkin from 2000 to 2006. On October 13, 2010, Perelman married Dr. Anna Chapman, a Harvard University-educated psychiatrist.

====Faith Golding====
Perelman met his first wife, Faith Golding, in 1965 on a cruise to Israel. As the heir to a real-estate and banking fortune, she controlled personal wealth of around $100 million at the time of their marriage. After they had adopted three children—Steven, Josh, and Hope—Faith gave birth to their fourth child, Debra. Their marriage lasted until 1984, when Faith discovered Perelman&#x27;s ongoing affair with a local florist after a bill for a Bulgari bracelet arrived at their home, instead of Perelman&#x27;s office. She further declared he had defrauded the owners of First Sterling Corporation (i.e. herself) by diverting thousands of dollars of company money into gifts for the florist. Faith made a very public spectacle of the divorce. Perelman responded by hiring Roy Cohn and flatly denying all her allegations. The pair quickly settled the divorce with an estimated payout to Faith in excess of $8 million.

====Claudia Cohen====
Perelman met his second wife, Claudia Cohen, in 1984 at Le Cirque. They had one daughter together, Samantha, in 1990. In August 1993, Ron filed for divorce. Claudia left the marriage with well over $80 million. In 2007, Claudia died after a secret seven-year battle with ovarian cancer. Perelman revealed in his eulogy at her funeral that he had known about her cancer from the beginning and privately commissioned a vaccine in his efforts to cure her. He donated $20 million to the University of Pennsylvania to remodel what is now Perelman Quadrangle and, as part of that donation, had the option of renaming Logan Hall. His decision to change it to Cohen Hall dismayed some Penn faculty, alumni, and students.

====Patricia Duff====
Patricia Duff was Perelman&#x27;s third wife. The pair first met in a Paris hotel lobby when both were still married: Perelman to Cohen, and Duff to Mike Medavoy. After Duff divorced Medavoy, Duff converted to Judaism and married Perelman, on January 25, 1995. She gave birth to his fourth daughter, Caleigh Sophia, before the wedding took place. When the marriage between Duff and Perelman disintegrated in 1996, custody over Caleigh became a major issue. Both Perelman and Duff wanted full custody and their prenuptial agreement did not address the subject of child support. Initially private, the divorce proceedings were opened to the public at the request of Duff. Neither party emerged with their reputations unscathed. The court psychiatrist found Duff to be paranoid and narcissistic and Perelman to have serious anger management issues, Perelman caught a great deal of flak for testifying that it cost about $3 a day to feed his daughter, and both sides alleged physical abuse by the other party. The judge&#x27;s sealed decision means the public will never know the exact results of the case, but it&#x27;s known that neither party actually won. Perelman is Caleigh&#x27;s legal guardian, but Patricia has extensive visitation rights.

====Ellen Barkin====

Perelman met his fourth wife, actress Ellen Barkin, at a &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; Oscar after-party in 1999. After slightly more than a year of courtship, the two married in June 2000. All accounts indicate their five-year marriage was a stormy one. Much of the friction arose due to Barkin&#x27;s acting career and her attendant travel schedule. Perelman filed and obtained a divorce in early 2006. The press soundly mocked Perelman for his actions, the speed and timing of which suggested his real motivation was to avoid a clause in his prenuptial that would raise the amount in alimony he owed Barkin if he waited a few days longer. Depending on the source used, Barkin&#x27;s yearly alimony ranges from $2 million to $3 million, and the total payout ranged from $20 million to $65 million. In late 2007, the pair exchanged lawsuits. Part of the divorce settlement required Perelman to invest several million dollars in a film production company Barkin and her brother George (an aspiring screenwriter) had started. Perelman made only one of the payments, claiming that there was no evidence the two were actually producing films. Barkin sued for her money while Perelman counter-sued, alleging Barkin and her brother had looted the film company for themselves. Four years later the lawsuits ended in a confidential settlement.

====Anna Chapman====
Perelman began dating psychiatrist Dr. Anna Chapman, in mid-2006. In late November 2010, the couple celebrated the birth of their son, Oscar. The couple later had a second child, Ike, in May 2012.

===Judaism===
Judaism has had a strong influence on Perelman&#x27;s life. He grew up in a Conservative household. The temple he went to growing up was a Reconstructionist temple, and his father donated millions to Conservative causes. He had a religious reawakening at the age of eighteen while on a family trip to Israel:

I felt not just this enormous pride at being a Jew; I felt this enormous void at not being a &quot;better&quot; Jew. So I decided then to begin being a better Jew. As soon as I got married, we kept a kosher house, we became much more observant. We moved to New York shortly thereafter and joined an Orthodox synagogue and the kids grew up with much more Judaism surrounding them than I ever did.

Today, he strictly observes the Jewish Sabbath, spends three hours every Saturday in prayer, keeps a kosher home, and donates millions to Jewish groups and causes, particularly the Chabad-Lubavitch sect. He does not consider himself to be a member of Lubavitch. He supports them because he thinks they are Judaism&#x27;s best chance for surviving and thriving in modern society.

==Homes==

Perelman is the owner of &quot;Près Choisis&quot; (now called &quot;The Creeks&quot;), a 40-room Mediterranean-style villa on Georgica Pond in East Hampton, Long Island. It was built in 1899 by the artists Adele and Albert Herter. In October 2018 a fire spread from the attic and burned for several hours. Insurers paid around $141 million for fire damage, but rejected claims of damage to five paintings insured for a total of $410 million. , Perelman&#x27;s suit against the insurers is before the New York Supreme Court.

<doc id="674133" wikidata="Q144362" url="?curid=674133" title="Azulene">
<text>Azulene is an aromatic organic compound and an isomer of naphthalene. Naphthalene is colourless, whereas azulene is dark blue. The compound is named after its colour, as &quot;azul&quot; is Spanish for blue. Two terpenoids, vetivazulene (4,8-dimethyl-2-isopropylazulene) and guaiazulene (1,4-dimethyl-7-isopropylazulene), that feature the azulene skeleton are found in nature as constituents of pigments in mushrooms, guaiac wood oil, and some marine invertebrates.

Azulene has a long history, dating back to the 15th century as the azure-blue chromophore obtained by steam distillation of German chamomile. The chromophore was discovered in yarrow and wormwood and named in 1863 by Septimus Piesse. Its structure was first reported by Lavoslav Ružička, followed by its organic synthesis in 1937 by Placidus Plattner.

== Structure and bonding==
Azulene is usually viewed as resulting from fusion of cyclopentadiene and cycloheptatriene rings. Like naphthalene and cyclodecapentaene, it is a 10 pi electron system. It exhibits aromatic properties: (i) the bonds have similar lengths and (ii) it undergoes Friedel-Crafts-like substitutions. The stability gain from aromaticity is estimated to be half that of naphthalene.

Its dipole moment is , in contrast with naphthalene, which has a dipole moment of zero. This polarity can be explained by regarding azulene as the fusion of a 6 π-electron cyclopentadienyl anion and a 6 π-electron tropylium cation: one electron from the seven-membered ring is transferred to the five-membered ring to give each ring aromatic stability by Hückel&#x27;s rule. Reactivity studies confirm that seven-membered ring is electrophilic and the five-membered ring is nucleophilic.

The dipolar nature of the ground state is reflected in its deep colour, which is unusual for small unsaturated aromatic compounds. Another notable feature of azulene is that it violates Kasha&#x27;s rule by exhibiting fluorescence from an upper-excited state (S2 → S0).

==Organic synthesis==
Synthetic routes to azulene have long been of interest because of its unusual structure. In 1939 the first method was reported by St. Pfau and Plattner starting from indane and ethyl diazoacetate.

An efficient one-pot route entails annulation of cyclopentadiene with unsaturated C5-synthons. The alternative approach from cycloheptatriene has long been known, one illustrative method being shown below.

Procedure:
# cycloheptatriene 2+2 cycloaddition with dichloro ketene
# diazomethane insertion reaction
# dehydrohalogenation reaction with DMF
# Luche reduction to alcohol with sodium borohydride
# elimination reaction with Burgess reagent
# oxidation with p-chloranil
# dehalogenation with polymethylhydrosiloxane, palladium(II) acetate, potassium phosphate and the DPDB ligand
Another synthesis route starts from the of pyridinium or pyrylium salts with cyclopentadienyl anion:
Azulene can also be synthesized via a Diels Alder and retro-Diels Alder reaction:
The starting material of the above reaction can be generated through the flash vacuum pyrolysis of phenyl propiolate.

==Organometallic complexes==
In organometallic chemistry, azulene serves as a ligand for low-valent metal centers. Illustrative complexes are (azulene)Mo2(CO)6 and (azulene)Fe2(CO)5.

==Derivatives==

1-Hydroxyazulene is an unstable green oil and it does not show keto–enol tautomerism. 2-Hydroxyazulene is obtained by hydrolysis of 2-methoxyazulene with hydrobromic acid. It is stable and does show keto–enol tautomerism. The p&quot;K&quot;a of 2-hydroxyazulene in water is 8.71. It is more acidic than phenol or naphthol. The p&quot;K&quot;a of 6-hydroxyazulenes in water is 7.38 making it also more acidic than phenol or naphthol.

In naphth[&quot;a&quot;]azulene, a naphthalene ring is condensed at the 1,2-positions of azulene. In one such system deviation from planarity is found, similar to that of tetrahelicene.

Guaiazulene (1,4-dimethyl-7-isopropylazulene) is an alkylated derivative of azulene with an almost identical intensely blue colour. It is commercially available to the cosmetics industry where it functions as a skin conditioning agent.

<text>OSNews is a computing online newspaper. It originally focused on operating systems and their related technologies that launched in 1997, but is now aggregating consumer electronics news. The content is managed by a group of editors and the owner. As of 2014, its managing editor is Thom Holwerda, who joined in 2005.

OSnews has been referenced by &quot;TIME&quot;, Ars Technica, &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;Computerworld&quot;, LifeHacker, Linux.com, OMG! Ubuntu! and lwn.net. &quot;Wired&quot; described OSnews as &quot;an alternative operating system Web magazine&quot;, and in 2011 Holwerda noted that &quot;while the alternative operating systems scene might no longer be the prime focus of OSNews due to a lack of activity in that field, it&#x27;s still where our heart lies.&quot;

==Staff==
*Thom Holwerda is managing editor.
*David Adams is a publisher and regular contributor.
*Eugenia Loli-Queru, the former editor-in-chief of OSNews, resigned in June 2005. Version 2 of OSNews was written by Eugenia in August 2001 when she resurrected the site after long periods of inactivity. She took on a more passive role in recent years as senior editor. She started the original GnomeFiles.org (GTK+ software repository).
*Adam Scheinberg is the webmaster. He wrote version 3 of the site in 2005, which added user registration, and version 4, a complete and total rewrite of the codebase. In late 2018, he led the conversion to WordPress.
*Jon Jensen is the systems administrator, dealing with site availability and DNS.

==Function==
Besides its main site, OSNews previously detected hundreds of mobile browsers and handsets and redirected them to a specially formatted cHTML version of the website at mobile.osnews.com. Eugenia Loli-Queru, the author of this script, open sourced it in 2008.

The editors contribute original articles and manage the submissions of news bits, articles, editorial comments and reviews that are submitted by readers. OSNews serves daily 275,000 page views on average (as of October 2005).

Like other technology news sites such as Slashdot, it has a free user/subscription model, and allows viewers to add commentary to articles. In 2005, OSNews published version 3 of its website, which includes an all-new commenting engine. Instead of reporting comments to moderators, this system now relies on votes. Readers can vote comments up or down, and readers can set a score threshold, which can eliminate the down-voted comments from view.

In late 2007, version 4 was launched, which completely overhauled the backend of the website, and was followed by version 4.1 which added a brand new theme and look to the website.

On February 12, 2007, managing editor Thom Holwerda published the 1.0 version of the OSNews Style Guide. This style guide is licensed under a Creative Commons license so that other websites and publications can use and adapt the guide to their liking. OSNews is one of the few sites of its kind with such a style guide.

In January 2008, Thom Holwerda launched &quot;Focus Shift&quot;, a webcomic based on the various news items OSNews carries. &quot;Focus Shift&quot; was updated tri-weekly, until it was discontinued in mid-2008.

<doc id="674149" wikidata="Q2920011" url="?curid=674149" title="Tel Rehov">
<text>Tel Rehov () or Tell es-Sarem (), is an archaeological site in the Bet She&#x27;an Valley, a segment of the Jordan Valley, Israel, approximately south of Beit She&#x27;an and west of the Jordan River. It was occupied in the Bronze Age and Iron Age.

The site is one of several suggested as Rehov (also Rehob), meaning &quot;broad&quot;, &quot;wide place&quot;. 

The oldest apiary discovered anywhere by archaeologists, including man-made beehives and remains of the bees themselves, dating between the mid-10th century BCE and the early 9th century BCE, came to light on the tell. In the nearby ruins of the mainly Byzantine-period successor of Iron Age Rehov, a Jewish town named Rohob or Roōb, within it a synagogue with the Mosaic of Rehob, considered one of the most important discoveries from the Roman - Byzantine period and the longest mosaic inscription found so far in the Land of Israel.

==Identification==
Tel Rehov does not correspond to the Hebrew Bible places named as Rehov, of which two were in the more westerly allotment of the Tribe of Asher, and one more northerly.

Identification of Tell es-Sarem/Tel Rehov with the ancient Canaanite and Israelite city of Rehov was based on the preservation of the name at the nearby Islamic holy tomb of esh-Sheikh er-Rihab (one kilometre; 1000 yards to the south of Tel Rehov), and the existence of the ruins of a Byzantine-period Jewish town that preserved the old name in the form of Rohob or Roōb/Roob (one kilometre; 1000 yards northwest of Tel Rehov).

Rehov was one of the largest cities in the region during the Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BCE) and Iron Age I–IIA (1200–900 BCE). During the Late Bronze Age, while Egypt ruled over Canaan, Rehov was mentioned in at least three sources dated between the 15th–13th century BCE, and again in the list of conquests of Pharaoh Shoshenq I, whose campaign took place around 925 BCE.

==History==
===Bronze Age===
Excavations revealed an eight meter wide mud brick fortification wall (with glacis) around the upper mound which the excavators attributed to the Early Bronze III period though no city of that period was found. The site was clearly occupied during the Late Bronze I and Late Bronze II periods, from 15th century BC to 13th century BC. Actual occupation from this period was found only on a small area (Area D) of the lower mound with possible exposure in probes on the upper mound. Some Egyptian material, including a scarab with the inscription &quot;Scribe of (the) house
of (the) overseer of sealed items, Amenemhat&quot; indicates the town may have been under Egyptian control like other towns in the region, after the time of Thutmose III.

===Iron Age===
The site was occupied in the Iron Age I and Iron Age II periods, from 12 century BC to 9th century BC. At that point it was destroyed and burnt which the excavators ascribe to the Assyrians in the mid-800s BC.

In the Levant there is a large Iron Age chronology controversy (similar the even more complicated Chronology of the ancient Near East with which there is some overlap). It is all very tangled with a High Chronology and a Low Chronology and some variants thereof. Given the careful stratigraphy and many radiocarbon dates Tel Rehov has been used to support and deny various chronologies. It has also been identified as a Lowland power center in opposition to the Omrides.

====Greek pottery====
From the 10th century BC and 9th century BC (Strata VI to IV) Greek pottery was found in stratified context. This is a useful result in addressing the chronology problems of the Levant (High vs Low) and of Greek pottery.

==== &quot;Elisha&quot; ostracon ====
In 2013, a potsherd was found holding a partially preserved inscription, which has been reconstructed as to be the rare name of Elisha, best known as the name of biblical Prophet Elisha.
 The association with the prophet is tenuous, based on the date of the ostracon (the second half of the ninth century), the rarity of the name, and the geographic vicinity of Elisha&#x27;s biblical hometown, Abel-meholah; but the name reconstruction is disputed, and the presence of incense altars in the house of the find and throughout Tel Rehov is considered contrary to the teachings of biblical prophets.
==== Inscriptions ====
In and near Tel Rehov, inscriptions containing references to the family of Nimshi have been found. King Jehu of the northern kingdom of Israel, anointed by a disciple of Elisha, is the son, grandson, or otherwise descendant of a certain Nimshi.

==== Iron Age beehives ====
The oldest known archaeological finds relating to beekeeping were discovered at Rehov. 

In September 2007, it was reported that 30 intact beehives and the remains of 100–200 more dated to the mid-10th century BCE to the early 9th century BCE were found (Strata V, Area C) by archaeologists in the ruins of Rehov. The hives had been destroyed by fire. The beehives were evidence of an advanced honey-producing beekeeping (apiculture) industry almost 3000 years ago in the city, thought to have had a population of about 2000 residents at that time, both Israelite and Canaanite. The beehives, made of straw and unbaked clay, were found in orderly rows of 100 hives each. Each individual beehive was shaped as a hollow cylinder measuring ca. 80 cm in length and 40 cm in diameter, with ca. 4 cm. thick walls. One end of the cylinder was sealed, with only a small hole in its center that allowed the bees to enter and exit the hive. Previously, references to honey in ancient texts of the region (such as the phrase &quot;land of milk and honey&quot; in the Hebrew Bible) were thought to refer only to &quot;honey&quot; produced from dates and figs; the discoveries show evidence of commercial production of bee honey and beeswax.

In addition to beehives, the remains of bees and bee larvae and pupae were also found. In 2010, using DNA from the remains of bees found at the site, researchers identified the bees as a subspecies, similar to the Anatolian bee, found now only in Turkey. It is possible that the bees&#x27; range has changed, but more likely that the inhabitants of Tel Rehov imported bees because they were less aggressive than the local bees and provided a better honey yield (three to eight times higher than Israel&#x27;s native bees).

Supporting archaeological knowledge include evidence of other imports in Rehov from eastern Mediterranean lands; later Egyptian documentation of transferring bees in large pottery vases or portable beehives; and an Assyrian stele from the 8th century BCE that evidences that bees had been brought from the Taurus Mountains of southern Turkey to the land of Suhu—about the same distance as between the Taurus and Rehov ().

The beehives were dated by carbon-14 radiocarbon dating at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, using organic material (wheat found next to the beehives).

Ezra Marcus of the University of Haifa, said the finding was a glimpse of ancient beekeeping seen in Near Eastern texts and ancient art. Religious practice was evidenced by an altar decorated with fertility figurines found alongside the hives.

== Archaeology ==
The site of Tel Rehov consists of an upper and lower mound with a total area, including mound slopes, of 11 hectares (27 acres). The total area of the mound tops is 7 hectares (17 acres).

The site was inspected by W.F. Albright in the 1920s, identifying the main occupation period as being the 13th to 10th century BC. In the 1940s Avraham Bergman and Ruth Brandstater inspected Tel Rehov. While there they found a Proto-Canaanite inscription in the topsoil. In the following decades some local residents collected items from the site, including a cylinder seal from the Old Babylonian period.

After full surface surveys and a geophysical study of the lower mound in 1995–1996 modern archaeological excavations were conducted for 11 seasons between 1997 and 2012 under the directorship of Amihai Mazar, Professor at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, and with the primary sponsorship of writer John Camp. Seven occupation strata were established with the uppermost (Strata I) representing scattered Islamic finds and the rest (Strata II to VII) being Iron Age. The lower mound was abandoned after Strata IV. No strata were established for the Bronze Age as results in this period were scanty and primarily on a small part of the lower mound. Among the finds, recovered in the 2003 season, was a 10th century BC jar with 2 identical three letter Proto-Canaanite inscriptions.

In 2002 a small rescue excavation occurred after ditching damaged several Bronze Age shaft tombs on the fringes of the site. Besides human remains, pottery fragments, ostrich egg-shell fragments, and two complete bronze daggers were found.

=== Ancient synagogue ===

Remains of a mainly Byzantine-period synagogue built in three successive phases between the fourth and the seventh century CE were found at the site of Tulul Farwana (&quot;mounds of Farwana&quot;), now part of the agricultural lands of Kibbutz Ein HaNetziv. Among the remains of the synagogue archaeologists found a relatively well-preserved mosaic pavement, the narthex part of which includes a very long sixth-century inscription in Aramaic; the so-called Mosaic of Rehob, Tel Rehov inscription or Baraita of the Boundaries with details of Jewish religious laws concerning &quot;the Borders of the Land of Israel&quot; (&quot;Baraitha di-Tehumin&quot;), tithes and the Sabbatical Year. During an archaeological survey of the abandoned structures standing at Farwana, there was found a marble-parapet with a relief of a seven-branched menorah, believed to have once enclosed the raised rostrum of the synagogue. Today, the marble-parapet with its menorah relief is on display at the synagogue in Kibbutz Ein HaNetziv. Later, children from the kibbutz discovered nearby one of the abandoned structures a cache of gold coins, which discovery prompted a more thorough investigation of the site, under the tutelage of archaeologist Fanny Vitto. An excavation of the site by her team led to the discovery of the aforementioned mosaic.

===Byzantine era town===
During the Byzantine era, a Jewish town that preserved the old name in the form of Rohob or Roob, stood one kilometre (1000 yards) northwest of Tel Rehov, at Khirbet Farwana/Horbat Parva and was mentioned by Eusebius as being on the fourth mile from Scythopolis, modern-day Beit She&#x27;an/Bisan.

Archaeological work at Farwana has also exposed pottery and other finds from the Iron Age, the Persian, Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, Early Islamic, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman periods.

<text>Sears Point is a prominent landform that juts into the San Pablo Bay in Sonoma County, California, United States. This hill is the southernmost peak of the Sonoma Mountains and forms the southwestern ridge above Tolay Lake. Starting with European settlement of this area in the mid-19th century considerable modification of the Napa Sonoma Marsh began to occur, such that in contemporary times, there is considerable upland between Sears Point and San Pablo Bay. Numerous local conservation organizations are presently working to restore hundreds of acres of these historic tidal wetlands as part of the Sears Point Wetlands and Watershed Restoration Project. The region can be accessed via State Route 37 or State Route 121.

Sears Point was named after Franklin Sears, who settled on south of Sonoma in 1851. Later, he partnered with his father-in-law to purchase some , part of which is the present-day Sonoma Raceway racetrack.

<text>The University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) is a public research university in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It is one of four campuses that make up the University of Colorado system. As of Fall 2023, UCCS had over 11,000 students, including more than 9,000 undergraduates and nearly 2,000 graduate students. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
The campus history begins with the creation of Cragmor Sanatorium, which is now Main Hall. In 1902, William Jackson Palmer donated funds to build a sanatorium (a place for treatment, rehabilitation, and therapy for the chronically ill). The Cragmor Sanatorium opened in 1905 and was nicknamed the &quot;Sun Palace&quot; due to its sun-loving architecture. In the following decades, it developed a following among the cultural elite, and many of its patients were wealthy. However, they were hit hard by the Great Depression in the 1930s and Cragmor suffered from financial distress into the 1940s. It was briefly reinvigorated in the 1950s when a contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs established Cragmor as a treatment center for Navajos with tuberculosis. About ten years later, the Navajo patients were transferred elsewhere.

As early as 1945, the University of Colorado offered classes in the Colorado Springs area at various locations, mostly Colorado College. By the 1960s, however, a permanent campus was desired.

On February 16, 1961, the Committee for the Expansion of the University of Colorado was formed. The co-chairmen were Joseph Petta and Ronald B Macintyre. Members included Angelo Christopher, Clint Cole, Albert Hesse, Don King, Don Kopis, Rosemary Macintyre, Dorothy Petta, Harrington Richardson, Joseph Reich, Robin Tibbets, Mike Valliant, Phyllis Warner, and John Whigham. (These Co-founders are all honored on a plaque in the lobby of the current campus site.) On March 4, 1961, they submitted a resolution to expand the extension of The University of Colorado to Colorado Springs. Legislators were favorable. After several more years of local and state meetings in June 1964, the next phase of UCCS&#x27;s development came about when Dr. George Dwire, the executive director of the Cragmor Sanatorium, began formal actions necessary to transfer the assets of the Cragmoor Corporation to the University of Colorado. The solution came when George T. Dwire sold the Cragmor Sanatorium property for $1 to the state, which became the property of the University of Colorado in 1964.

In 1965, UCCS moved to its current location on Austin Bluffs Parkway in the Cragmor neighborhood of Northern Colorado Springs. The campus is located at one of the highest parts of the city.

Because of its ties to Hewlett-Packard, initial university programs focused on engineering and business, and classes were held in the Cragmor Sanatorium building, what is now Main Hall, and Cragmor Hall, a modern expansion of Main Hall. The first building built exclusively for UCCS, Dwire Hall, was not complete until 1972.

A 1997 community referendum merged Beth-El College of Nursing with UCCS. In recent years, programs such as the Network Information and Space Security Center were added to connect the university with the military to improve national security. Other programs, including the CU Institute for Bioenergetics and the Institute for Science and Space Studies, cast an eye toward the future.

In 2001, UCCS purchased an building at the corner of Union and Austin Bluffs to house the Beth-El College of Nursing.

== Master plan and future growth ==
In 2000, the CU Board of Regents designated UCCS as the CU growth campus. In 2003, the Colorado Legislature approved revisions in the university&#x27;s statutory role and mission to remove geographic and program restrictions. In 2005, the Regents approved a seven-year plan that calls for the university to add to its base of 7,650 students (Fall 2004), 347 FTE faculty and 254 FTE staff.

The 2006–2012 plan called for growth to 9,100 students with corresponding increases in faculty, staff, programs and campus infrastructure.

In addition to the completion of the recreation center, Dwire Hall renovation, and the third wing of the new science/engineering building, the seven-year plan also calls for the renovation and transition of the old Heller Center on the other side of the bluff that campus sits in front of into a sort of &quot;arts retreat&quot;. This project is expected to cost around $4.4 million. Also, by 2014, two new buildings are in the works for Summit, and by that year the Alpine Village should be built out with three additional buildings across from the current ones.

With construction on the new Austin Bluffs/Union interchange, the construction of a new frontage road from campus to University Hall began as well, enabling a closed circuit connecting Cragmor Campus with University Hall, making access to Austin Bluffs unnecessary.

From 2014 a new indoor athletics complex will be constructed along Nevada in the existing 4-Diamonds area. North Nevada is the second phase of campus in the long-term, and extreme long-term build-out calls for dozens of new buildings, academic halls, and another resident village to be built along Nevada.

Slated for completion by the end of 2019, a new road will connect the main campus with the Ent Center for the Arts. This road will bypass Stanton Road running through the Eagle Rock neighborhood.

==Athletics==

UCCS competes in NCAA Division II in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (RMAC), fielding teams in men&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s basketball, women&#x27;s volleyball, men&#x27;s cross country, women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s indoor track and field, women&#x27;s indoor track and field, men&#x27;s outdoor track and field, women&#x27;s outdoor track and field, men&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s softball and women&#x27;s lacrosse.

The school mascot is the mountain lion, Clyde, with official colors of gold and black, the same school colors of CU-Boulder (black, gold and silver).

==Honor societies==
In addition to its honors programs, UCCS has chapters of the following honor societies on campus:
*Alpha Kappa Delta (sociology)
*Alpha Lambda Delta (freshman)
*Alpha Phi Sigma (criminal justice)
*Beta Gamma Sigma (business)
*Chi Sigma Iota (counseling)

==School publications==
*The official campus newspaper is &quot;The Scribe&quot;, since 1966.
*The university is home to &quot;Writers&#x27; Forum&quot;, a national literary journal founded in 1974.
*&quot;URJ-UCCS: Undergraduate Research Journal at UCCS&quot;
*&quot;riverrun&quot; is the student literary and arts journal published annually. They take poetry, fiction, nonfiction, and visual art submissions. &quot;riverrun&quot; must never be capitalized because it is a reference to the first word of the book &quot;Finnegans Wake,&quot; which starts in the middle of a sentence. The beginning of the sentence is at the end of the book.

<text>Krýsuvík (also Krísuvík, both pronounced in Icelandic) is an area in Southwest Iceland at about 35 km from Reykjavík.

==Geography and access==
It is situated on the Reykjanes peninsula between Þorlákshöfn and Grindavík and accessed by Routes 42 and 427.

== Name ==
The name Krýsuvík means &quot;bay of Krýsa,&quot; a folk tale figure from the area. &quot;Krýsa&quot; was an old woman who, together with her cousin &quot;Herdís,&quot; could use witchcraft. They had a discussion about the borders of their respective lands; one wanted to cast a spell so that all the fish in a nearby lake would be hairy, the other intended to bring up a storm and let all fishermen die. The dispute ended with the death of both of them. The folk tale says that they were buried side by side, and the place of the graves is still known to locals.

The &quot;Ögmundarhraun&quot; lava flows which were emitted by the nearby Krýsuvík volcanic system in the 12th century, destroyed the Krýsuvík farm, which was located at the coast, and filled up the bay.

==History==

There were farms in the vicinity from the Middle Ages till 1945. After the eruption known as the Krýsuvík fires in the middle of the 12th century, probably in 1151-1188, the main farm was transferred to a place under the mountain Bæjarfell. The name Krýsuvík was still used for the farm, though the buildings were at a distance of some kilometers from the sea. The farm had a reputation for being very rich till the end of the 19th century. Being near the sea, the farm had additional income from fishing and hunting. Commerce was also done, because the farm was a junction of old trails from the north to the south coast. Also the sulfur of the nearby geothermal areas was mined and exported. However, Krýsuvík was too far away from upcoming industry and commerce and therefore abandoned in the middle of the 20th century.

Árni Gíslason, one of the richest people in Iceland in the 19th century, lived in Krýsuvík. In 1949, a new farm (Fjósið) was constructed near the maar Grænavatn, but for many reasons, never used much as such.

As all the estate farms in Iceland, Krýsuvík had its own small proprietary church, in this case from the 13th century until 2010. The last building was a 19th century timber church built in 1857. The church was then changed into an apartment building for some time after 1927. In 1964, the mayor of Hafnarfjörður had the church renovated and used for weddings and placed under the protection of the National Museum as part of the National Museum’s Buildings Collection. It burned down in January 2010. An association was formed to build a replica, which was done by students and teachers at the technical school in Hafnarfjörður. The replica was driven to the site by truck and unloaded in 2020.

==Sites==


Under the mountain Bæjarfell is a boarding school for young people who have problems with drug abuse.

In the vicinity are some maars and the high temperature geothermal area of &quot;Seltún&quot;, all part of the Krýsuvík volcanic system. The largest lake in the area, Kleifarvatn, began to diminish after an earthquake in 2000; 20% of its surface disappeared by 2005, but it had filled up again by 2019. Many interesting tuff rock formations are to be found at its western coast near Route 42 on the slopes of Sveifluháls.

The &quot;Ögmundarhraun&quot; lava field south of Krýsuvík includes some kīpukas, vegetation islands in the lava field, which can be reached by hiking trails. One of them, the Húshólmi , contains some ruins of the medieval farm of Krýsuvík. Scientists identified some stone fences within the same kipuka as being older as the official time of settlement (874). They used tephrochronology and saw that the famous bimodal settlement tephra (&quot;landnámslagið&quot;) derived from a combined eruption series within the Bárðarbunga-Veiðivötn and Torfajökull systems in the years 871-874, was covering these structures.

A jeep track runs down to the sea from Krýsuvík and Route 427. It ends at the high cliffs of &quot;Krýsuvíkurbjarg&quot; or &quot;Krýsuvíkurberg&quot; which are renowned as bird cliffs with thousands of Icelandic sea birds like arctic terns, puffins, fulmars and more. About 63,000 pairs of birds were counted there shortly before 2014. But the cliffs, which can be reached on foot, are also a window in the geologic past. The lava flows covering the area came mostly from the crater up on Geitahlíð tuya, not from the Krýsuvík, but from the neighbouring Brennisteinsfjöll volcanic system. The area is protected as part of &quot;Reykjanesfólkvangur&quot;.

Krýsuvík is a popular hiking area, and tourism infrastructure such as wooden pathways has been developed.

The music video for the song &quot;Never Forget&quot; by Greta Salóme and Jónsi was filmed in this area.

<doc id="674172" wikidata="Q83590" url="?curid=674172" title="Thirty-Six Stratagems">
<text>The Thirty-Six Stratagems is a Chinese essay used to illustrate a series of stratagems used in politics, war, and civil interaction.

Its focus on the use of cunning and deception both on the battlefield and in court have drawn comparisons to Sun Tzu&#x27;s &quot;The Art of War&quot;. Zhang Yingyu&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Swindles&quot;, a late-Ming dynasty work that focuses on the realms of commerce and civil society, shares some thematic similarities.

==Origin==

The name of the collection comes from the &quot;Book of Qi&quot; seventh biographical volume, &quot;Biography of Wang Jingze&quot; (). Wáng was a general who had served Southern Qi since the first Emperor Gao of the dynasty. When Emperor Ming came to power and executed many members of the court and royal family for fear that they would threaten his reign, Wang believed that he would be targeted next and rebelled. As Wang received news that Xiao Baojuan, son and crown prince of Emperor Ming, had escaped in haste after learning of the rebellion, he commented that &quot;of the thirty-six stratagems of Lord Tán, retreat was his best, you father and son should run for sure.&quot; &quot;Lord Tán&quot; refers to general Tan Daoji of the Liu Song dynasty, who was forced to retreat after his failed attack on Northern Wei, and Wang mentioned his name in contempt as an example of cowardice.

The number thirty-six was used by Wang as a figure of speech in this context, and is meant to denote &quot;numerous stratagems&quot; instead of any specific number. Wang&#x27;s choice of this term came from the &quot;I Ching&quot;, where six is the number of &quot;yin&quot; that shared many characteristics with the dark schemes involved in military strategy. As thirty-six is the square of six, it therefore acted as a metaphor for &quot;numerous strategies&quot;. Since Wang did not refer to any thirty-six specific stratagems, the thirty-six proverbs and their connection to military strategies and tactics are likely to have been created after the fact, with only the collection&#x27;s name being attributed to Wang.

The prevailing view is that contents of the &quot;Thirty-Six Stratagems&quot; originated in both written and oral history. Some stratagems reference occurrences in the time of Sun Bin, approximately 150 years after Sun Tzu&#x27;s death. The original hand-copied paperback was believed to have been discovered in China&#x27;s Shaanxi province, of an unknown date and author, and put into print by a local publisher in 1941. The &quot;Thirty-Six Stratagems&quot; came to the public&#x27;s attention after a review of it was published in the Chinese Communist Party&#x27;s &quot;Guangming Daily&quot; newspaper on September 16, 1961. It was subsequently reprinted and distributed with growing popularity.

The &quot;Thirty-Six Stratagems&quot; are divided into a preface, six chapters containing six stratagems each, and an incomplete afterword that was missing text. The first three chapters generally describe tactics for use in advantageous situations, while the last three chapters contain stratagems that are more suitable for disadvantageous situations. The original text of the &quot;Thirty-Six Stratagems&quot; has a laconic style that is common to Classical Chinese. Each proverb is accompanied by a short comment, no longer than a sentence or two, that explains how said proverb is applicable to military tactics. These 36 Chinese proverbs are related to 36 battle scenarios in Chinese history and folklore, predominantly of the Warring States period and the Three Kingdoms period.

==Content==
The &quot;Thirty-Six Stratagems&quot; consists of six chapters, with each chapter consisting of six stratagems.

=== Chapter 1: Winning Stratagems (, Shèng zhàn jì) ===

====Deceive the heavens to cross the sea (, Mán tiān guò hǎi)====
:Mask one&#x27;s real goals from those in authority who lack vision by not alerting them to one&#x27;s movements or any part of one&#x27;s plan.

==== Besiege Wèi to rescue Zhào (圍魏救趙, Wéi Wèi jiù Zhào)====

:When the enemy is too strong to be attacked directly, attack something they cherish. The idea is to avoid a head-on battle with a strong enemy, and instead strike at their weakness elsewhere. This will force the strong enemy to retreat in order to support their weakness. Battling against a tired and dispirited enemy will give a much higher chance of success.

====Kill with a borrowed knife (借刀殺人, Jiè dāo shā rén)====
:Attack using the strength of another when in a situation where using one&#x27;s own strength is not favourable. For example, trick an ally into attacking the enemy, or use the enemy&#x27;s own strength against them. The idea is to cause damage to the enemy via a third party.

====Wait at leisure while the enemy labors (以逸待勞, Yǐ yì dài láo)====
:It is advantageous to choose the time and place for battle while the enemy does not. Encourage the enemy to expend their energy in futile quests while one conserves their strength. When the enemy is exhausted and confused, attack with energy and purpose.

====Loot a burning house (趁火打劫, Chèn huǒ dǎ jié)====
:When a country is beset by internal problems, such as disease, famine, corruption, and crime, it is poorly-equipped to deal with an outside threat. Keep gathering internal information about an enemy. If the enemy is in its weakest state, attack them without mercy and annihilate them to prevent future troubles.

====Make a sound in the east, then strike in the west (聲東擊西, Shēng dōng jī xī)====
:In any battle the element of surprise can provide an overwhelming advantage. Even when face-to-face with an enemy, surprise can still be employed by attacking where they least expect it. Create an expectation in the enemy&#x27;s mind through the use of a feint. Manipulate the enemy to focus their resources somewhere before attacking elsewhere that is poorly defended. Tactically, this is known as an &quot;open feint&quot;.

===Chapter 2: Enemy Dealing Stratagems (敵戰計, Dí zhàn jì)===
====Create something from nothing (无中生有, Wú zhōng shēng yǒu)====
:A plain lie. Make somebody believe there was something when there is in fact nothing or vice versa.

====Openly repair the gallery roads, but sneak through the passage of Chencang (明修棧道，暗渡陳倉, Míng xiū zhàn dào, àn dù Chéncāng)====
:Deceive the enemy with an obvious approach that will take a very long time, while ambushing them with another approach. It is an extension of the &quot;Make a sound in the east, then strike in the west&quot; tactic, but instead of merely spreading misinformation to draw the enemy&#x27;s attention, physical decoys are used to further misdirect the enemy. The decoys must be easily seen by the enemy to draw their attention while acting as if they are meant to do what they are falsely doing to avoid suspicion.
:Today, &quot;sneaking through the passage of Chencang&quot; also has the meaning of having an affair or doing something that is illegal.

====Watch the fires burning across the river (隔岸觀火, Gé àn guān huǒ)====
:Delay entering the field of battle until all other parties become exhausted by fighting amongst each other. Go in at full strength and finish them off.

====Hide a knife behind a smile (笑裏藏刀, Xiào lǐ cáng dāo)====
:Charm and ingratiate oneself with the enemy. When their trust is gained, move against them in secret.

====Sacrifice the plum tree to preserve the peach tree (李代桃僵, Lǐ dài táo jiāng)====
:There are circumstances where short-term objectives must be sacrificed in order to gain the long-term goal. This is the scapegoat strategy where someone suffers the consequences so that the rest do not.

====Take the opportunity to pilfer a goat (順手牽羊, Shùn shǒu qiān yáng)====
:While carrying out one&#x27;s plans, be flexible enough to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself, however small, and avail oneself of any profit, however slight.

===Chapter 3: Offensive Stratagems (攻戰計, Gōng zhàn jì)===
====Stomp the grass to scare the snake (打草驚蛇, Dǎ cǎo jīng shé)====
:Do something unaimed, but spectacular (&quot;hitting the grass&quot;) to provoke a response from the enemy (&quot;startle the snake&quot;) to have them give away their plans or position. Do something unusual, strange, and unexpected to arouse the enemy&#x27;s suspicion and disrupt their thinking. It is more widely used as a warning: &quot;[Do not] startle the snake by hitting the grass&quot;. An imprudent act will give one&#x27;s position or intentions away to the enemy.

====Borrow a corpse to resurrect the soul (借屍還魂, Jiè shī huán hún)====
:Take an institution, a technology, a method, or even an ideology that has been forgotten or discarded and appropriate it for one&#x27;s own purposes.

====Lure the tiger down the mountain (調虎離山, Diào hǔ lí shān)====
:Never directly attack an opponent whose advantage is derived from their position. Instead, lure them away from their position to separate them from their source of strength.

====In order to capture, one must let loose (欲擒故縱, Yù qín gù zòng)====
:Cornered prey will often mount a final desperate attack. To prevent this, let the enemy believe they still have a chance for freedom. Their will to fight is hampered by their desire to escape. The enemy&#x27;s morale will be depleted and they will surrender without a fight when the illusion of escape is revealed.

====Tossing out a brick to lure a jade gem (拋磚引玉, Pāo zhuān yǐn yù)====

:Bait someone by making them believe they gain something or to just make them react to it; &quot;toss out a brick&quot; to obtain something valuable from them in return (&quot;get a jade gem&quot;).

====Defeat the enemy by capturing their chief (擒賊擒王, Qín zéi qín wáng)====
:If the enemy&#x27;s army is strong but is allied to the commander only by money, superstition, or threats, target the leader. If the commander falls, the rest of the army will disperse or join one&#x27;s side. If they are allied to the leader through loyalty, beware, as the army can continue to fight on after their death out of vengeance.

===Chapter 4: Mixed Warfare Stratagems (混戰計, Hùnzhàn jì)===
====Remove the firewood from under the pot (釜底抽薪, Fǔ dǐ chōu xīn)====
:Take out the leading argument or asset of someone; &quot;steal someone&#x27;s thunder&quot;. This is the essence of the indirect approach: instead of attacking enemy&#x27;s fighting forces, direct attacks against their ability to wage war. Literally, take the fuel out of the fire.

====Disturb the water and catch a fish (渾水摸魚／混水摸魚, Hùn shuǐ mō yú)====
:Create confusion and exploit it to further one&#x27;s own goals.

====Slough off the cicada&#x27;s golden shell (金蟬脱殼, Jīn chán tuō ké/qiào)====
:Mask oneself. Either leave one&#x27;s distinctive traits behind and become inconspicuous or masquerade as something or someone else. This strategy is mainly used to escape from a stronger enemy.

====Shut the door to catch the thief (關門捉賊, Guān mén zhuō zéi)====
:To capture one&#x27;s enemy, or more generally in fighting wars, to deliver the final blow to the enemy, plan prudently for success; do not rush into action. Before &quot;moving in for the kill&quot;, first cut off the enemy&#x27;s escape routes and any routes from external aid.

====Befriend a distant state and strike a neighbouring one (遠交近攻, Yuǎn jiāo jìn gōng)====
:Invading nations close to oneself carries a higher chance of success. The battlefields are close to one&#x27;s domain and as such is easier for one&#x27;s troops to receive supplies and defend the conquered land. Make allies with nations far away from oneself, as it is unwise to invade them.

====Obtain safe passage to conquer the State of Guo (假途伐虢, Jiǎ tú fá Guó)====
:Borrow the resources of an ally to attack a common enemy. Once the enemy is defeated, use those resources to turn on the ally that lent them in the first place.

===Chapter 5: Combined Stratagems (並戰計, Bìng zhàn jì)===
====Replace the beams with rotten timbers (偷梁換柱, Tōu liáng huàn zhù)====
:Disrupt the enemy&#x27;s formations, interfere with their methods of operations, and change the rules that they are used to following. In this way the supporting pillar, the common link that makes a group of men an effective fighting force, is removed.

====Point at the mulberry tree while cursing the locust tree (指桑罵槐, Zhǐ sāng mà huái)====
:To discipline, control, or warn others whose status or position excludes them from direct confrontation; use analogy and innuendo. Without directly naming names, those accused cannot retaliate without revealing their complicity.

====Feign madness but keep your balance (假痴不癲, Jiǎ chī bù diān)====
:Pretend to be incompetent to create confusion about one&#x27;s intentions and motivations. Lure the opponent into underestimating one&#x27;s ability until they drop their guard.

====Remove the ladder when the enemy has ascended to the roof (上屋抽梯, Shàng wū chōu tī)====
:With baits and deceptions, lure the enemy into treacherous terrain and cut off their lines of communication and escape routes. To save themselves, they must fight both one&#x27;s own forces and the elements of nature.

====Decorate the tree with false blossoms (樹上開花, Shù shàng kāi huā)====
:Tying silk blossoms on a dead tree gives the illusion that the tree is healthy. Using artifice and disguise, make something worthless appear valuable and vice versa.

====Make the host and the guest exchange roles (反客為主, Fǎn kè wéi zhǔ)====
:Usurp leadership in a situation where one is normally subordinate. Infiltrate one&#x27;s target. Initially, pretend to be a guest to be accepted, but develop from inside and become the owner later.

===Chapter 6: Defeat Stratagems (敗戰計, Bài zhàn jì)===
====The beauty trap (Honeypot) (美人計, Měi rén jì)====
:Send the enemy beautiful women to cause discord within his camp. This strategy can work on three levels. First, the ruler becomes so enamoured with the beauty that he neglects his duties and allows his vigilance to wane. Second, the group of men will begin to have issues if the desired women court another man, thus creating conflict and aggressive behavior. Third, other females at court, motivated by jealousy and envy, begin to plot subversions that further exacerbate the situation.

====The empty fort strategy (空城計, Kōng chéng jì)====
:When the enemy has stronger forces and one expects to be overrun at any moment, act calmly and taunt the enemy, so that the enemy thinks they are walking into an ambush. This stratagem is only successful if in most cases one has a powerful hidden force and the stratagem is seldom used.

====Let the enemy&#x27;s own spy sow discord in the enemy camp (反間計, Fǎn jiàn jì)====
:Undermine the enemy&#x27;s ability to fight by secretly causing discord between them and their friends, allies, advisors, family, commanders, soldiers, and population. While they are preoccupied with settling internal disputes, their ability to attack or defend is compromised.

====Inflict injury on oneself to win the enemy&#x27;s trust (苦肉計, Kǔ ròu jì)====
:Pretending to be injured has two advantages: first, the enemy is lulled into lowering their guard since they no longer consider one to be an immediate threat. Second, ingratiating oneself with the enemy by pretending the injury was caused by a mutual enemy conserves one&#x27;s strength while one&#x27;s enemies fight each other.

====Chain stratagems (連環計, Lián huán jì)====
:In important matters, one should use several stratagems applied simultaneously after another as in a chain of stratagems. Keep different plans operating in an overall scheme; if any one strategy fails, apply the next strategy.

====If all else fails, retreat (走為上策, Zǒu wéi shàng cè)====
:If it becomes obvious that one&#x27;s current course of action will lead to defeat, retreat and regroup. When one&#x27;s side is losing, three choices remain: surrender, compromise, or escape. Surrender is complete defeat, compromise is half defeat, but escape is not defeat. As long as one is not defeated, there is still a chance. This is the most famous of the stratagems and is immortalized in the form of a Chinese idiom: &quot;Of the Thirty-Six Stratagems, fleeing is best&quot; (三十六計，走為上計, Sānshíliù jì, zǒu wéi shàng jì).

<text>Toodyay (, ), known as Newcastle between 1860 and 1910, is a town on the Avon River in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, north-east of Perth. The first European settlement occurred in the area in 1836. After flooding in the 1850s, the townsite was moved to its current location in the 1860s. It is connected by railway and road to Perth. During the 1860s, it was home to bushranger Moondyne Joe.

==History==
===Origin of the name &quot;Toodyay&quot;===

The meaning of the name is uncertain, although it is probably indigenous Noongar in origin. In an 1834 reference it is transcribed as &quot;Toodye&quot; while maps in 1836 referred to &quot;Duidgee&quot; The Shire of Toodyay&#x27;s official website says that &quot;[t]he name Toodyay is believed to be derived from an Aboriginal word &quot;Duidgee&quot; which means &quot;place of plenty&quot;, referring to the richness and fertility of the area and the reliability of the Avon River&quot;. This meaning appears to be a long-standing belief in the local community, but may be based on an interpretation of an explanation by an Aboriginal guide about the value of the location rather than the literal meaning of the word.

An alternative meaning was ascribed by a research project headed by Professor Len Collard which provides the meaning as &quot;today it is misty and foggy&quot;. Yet another version was more recently postulated by local anthropologists Ken Macintyre and Dr Barb Dobson, who provide a very erudite analysis which says that the name most likely mimics a birdcall, possibly the restless flycatcher or one of that family. The name in the form &quot;Duidgee&quot; is preserved in the riverside recreation area &quot;Duidgee Park&quot;.

===The Ballardong people of Duidgee===
Before the arrival of Europeans, the Toodyay (Duidgee) region was owned by the Ballardong Noongar people, whose country extended from the Wongan Hills and beyond in the north to beyond Pingelly in the south, though the people whose land included present-day Toodyay probably numbered about 100 people and occupied the area from around Bolgart to Burlong Pool on the Avon River near Northam, a range of about 50 kilometres. The Avon River at Toodyay was a key site for food supply for the Ballardong, as was revealed to botanist and new landholder James Drummond as soon as he arrived in the area. The site was also located along the route taken by the river serpent, the Wagyl, in his seasonal underground travels between the spring at Bolgart and Burlong Pool. It had been a focal point of Ballardong life for thousands of years.

===Old Toodyay, 1836-1860===

The Avon River valley in which Toodyay was to be located was discovered for the white settlers by Ensign Robert Dale in 1830, leading to further exploration by settlers including James Drummond, Captain Francis Whitfield and Alexander Anderson. The first village of Toodyay was established in 1836, one of the earliest inland settlements in Western Australia. Drummond established his homestead &quot;Hawthornden&quot; a few kilometres to the north.

===Newcastle, 1860-1910===
The original townsite was subject to flooding, which led to its abandonment in the 1850s, and a new townsite was established on higher ground upstream. This was proclaimed by Governor Arthur Kennedy on 1 October 1860 as &quot;Newcastle&quot; and the original settlement came to be referred to as &quot;Old Toodyay&quot;.

The Newcastle Gaol, in Clinton Street, completed in 1864, was in use as a state prison until 1909. It is now preserved as a heritage building and tourist attraction, the Old Gaol Museum.

In 1870, a steam-driven flour mill, Connor&#x27;s Mill, was built on Stirling Terrace by George Hasell. The mill was also used to generate electricity in the early twentieth century. Saved from demolition in the 1970s, and restored to demonstrate the milling process and machinery, the mill now forms the museum section of the Toodyay Visitor Centre.

===Toodyay since 1910===
In May 1910, due to confusion with the New South Wales city of Newcastle, a name-change to Toodyay was proposed and the original townsite, which had by this time declined substantially, became &quot;West Toodyay&quot;.

The Heritage Council of Western Australia lists over one hundred places of historical significance in or near Toodyay, including cottages (some of which are now ruins), homesteads, shops, churches, parks and railway infrastructure. The State Register of Heritage Buildings includes the Gaol, Connor&#x27;s Mill, Toodyay Public Library, the old Toodyay Post Office and the old Toodyay Fire Station, as well as several other historic sites. The historic architecture of shops and residences along the main street, Stirling Terrace, presents a distinctive frontage termed the Stirling Terrace Streetscape Group.

Some of the buildings are also listed on the Australian Heritage Database. They include the Freemasons Hotel, the Victoria Hotel, and Urwin&#x27;s Store on Stirling Terrace, and Butterly&#x27;s Cottage on Harper Road.

The current Toodyay District High School was established in 1954, replacing an older building constructed in 1886.

In 1986 the town was the location used to film the movie Shame.

==Notable people==
In 1861, Western Australia&#x27;s notorious bushranger Moondyne Joe was imprisoned in Toodyay for stealing a horse, but escaped. After a series of crimes and prison terms, he was on the run again, returning to Toodyay in 1865 to steal supplies for an attempt to escape overland to South Australia. The annual Moondyne Festival is a light-hearted celebration of this darker side of Toodyay&#x27;s history.

==Tourism==
::&quot;See also Toodyay pioneer heritage trail&quot;
By the early 1920s Toodyay was being recognised for its potential to develop into a tourist destination, with ample accommodation, its link to WA colonial past, Moondyne Joe and the Newcastle Gaol as point of interest. Being an hour&#x27;s drive from Perth, present day Toodyay is a popular venue for tourists. A picturesque circuit of Toodyay Road through Gidgegannup, Toodyay, Chittering Valley and Great Northern Highway attracts motorists. Other destinations include olive oil farms, lavender farms, holiday retreats, hotels, restaurants, caravan parks, an emu farm and a public archery park.

==Transport==

===Railways===

Historically, Newcastle was connected to the Western Australian Government Railways network by a line that left the Eastern Railway at Clackline, which then travelled through Western Toodyay to proceed to Bolgart and then on to Miling. This connection was changed when the Eastern Railway was re-routed through the Avon Valley in 1966. The Clackline connection was closed, and Toodyay became part of the main eastern railway route.

Toodyay railway station is currently served by Transwa &quot;AvonLink, MerredinLink&quot; and &quot;Prospector&quot; passenger trains on the route from Perth to Northam and Kalgoorlie.

===Roads===
Toodyay is connected to Perth by Toodyay Road, which runs in a south-westerly direction to Great Northern Highway in Middle Swan, Perth. Within Toodyay, it continues as the town&#x27;s main street, Stirling Terrace. Other major roads radiating out from Toodyay are:
* Clackline Toodyay Road, heading south to Clackline on Great Eastern Highway
* Northam Toodyay Road, heading south-east to Northam and Great Eastern Highway
* Goomalling Toodyay Road, heading north-east to Goomalling
* Bindi Bindi Toodyay Road, heading north to Calingiri, and later Bindi Bindi on Great Northern Highway
* Bindoon Dewars Pool Road, heading north-west to Bindoon
* Julimar Road, heading west to Chittering
Toodyay is also the northern end of the Avon Historic Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive 254), which follows the Avon River to Beverley.

===Motor racing===
On 5 May 1947, a motor racing meeting took place, using the towns streets for the course. The circuit was in a clockwise direction, following the route Stirling Terrace (where the start and finish was located)-Henry Street-Duke Street-Fiennes Street-Templar Lane and back to Stirling Terrace. The main race of the meeting was the 30 mile Toodyay Speed Classic, which was won by Syd Barker. A second meeting was planned for 17 November 1948, to coincide with the King&#x27;s Birthday holiday, but the holiday was cancelled, as was the race meeting.

Toodyay plays host to a leg of the Quit Targa West each year, normally on the Saturday of the event.

===Waterways===
Toodyay is located on the Avon River, which runs through to the Swan River in Perth. The annual Avon Descent sees a range of crafts make their way downriver through Toodyay, from the starting point at Northam.

==Bushfires==
Toodyay has been impacted by fires – a common occurrence in the summer months – since it was settled. Significant bushfires have regularly been reported in the area from as early as 1853. Two of the most devastating fires to threaten Toodyay have resulted from state government infrastructure, along with other smaller fires, including the spontaneous combustion of a dung heap at the Newcastle Police Stables.

On 10 December 1909 a fire was started by a train using the newly opened Newcastle–Bolgart Railway near Coondle; the fire was referred to as the most disastrous that had ever occurred in the area. It burnt an area of about 15 miles in length and up to 4 miles wide. Three hundred and fifty people fought the fire over two days before putting it out. A later flare up caused further damage to 600 acres of land, 500 of which was on the property of Timothy Quinlan. In 1906, when he was Speaker of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, Quinlan had been an advocate for the building of the line.

A major bushfire, blamed on collapsed power lines, broke out at about noon on 29 December 2009 after outdoor temperature had reached and the &quot;catastrophic&quot; fire risk rating had been used for the first time in the state. Areas to the south, south-west and east of Toodyay were affected, with more than of forest burnt and 38 homes lost.

==Toodyaypedia==

Since 2013, the Shire of Toodyay and the Toodyay Historical Society have collaborated with Wikipedia editors to create and maintain Wikipedia articles about heritage buildings in Toodyay and West Toodyay, and significant people in the towns&#x27; history. Plaques with QR codes have been attached to some buildings, linking to the corresponding articles.

<doc id="674179" wikidata="Q927181" url="?curid=674179" title="Clayton-le-Moors">
<text>Clayton-le-Moors is an industrial town in the Borough of Hyndburn in the county of Lancashire, England. located two miles north of Accrington. The town has a population of 8,522 according to the 2011 census.

To the west lies Rishton, to the north Great Harwood, and two miles to the south, Accrington. Clayton-le-Moors is situated on the A680 road alongside the M65 motorway.

==History==
It is thought that the town developed with the fusion of the two hamlets of Oakenshaw (bottom end) and Enfield (top end) which began during the construction of the Leeds Liverpool Canal, which pre-dated the railways. The merger continued with the development of the cotton textile industry, particularly that of weaving and cloth finishing. The stretch of canal between Burnley and Enfield Wharf (now alongside the Enfield Bridge on Blackburn Road) was opened in 1801. By 1808 it had been extended to the village of Church. The final link up between Leeds and Liverpool was completed 1816. Clayton-le-Moors now lies at the midpoint of the Leeds Liverpool Canal although there is no marker. The canal continued to be used for the commercial transportation of coal between Bank Hall Colliery, Burnley and the now demolished power generating station at Whitebirk, Blackburn, until 1963. During the harsh winter of 1963 the thickness of the ice on the canal prevented the movement of barges and coal had to be transported by road. Canal transportation was never resumed. The canal is now used solely for leisure boating and is managed and maintained by the Canal and River Trust, a charitable trust.

The Roman Catholic St. Mary&#x27;s Church which opened in 1819, was originally sited on Burnley Road, east of the town, on the boundary with Altham, as a replacement for the chapel at Dunkenhalgh. The present-day St. Mary&#x27;s in Clayton-le-Moors was built in 1959 and the old one demolished, with only the graveyard surviving. The Church of England, All Saints&#x27; Church was erected in 1840.

The town&#x27;s two main thoroughfares are the A680 Whalley Road, which still has some canal workers&#x27; cottages, and A678 which is named Blackburn Road to the west of the junction with Whalley Road and Burnley Road to the east.

Mercer Park, once the grounds of Mercer House, is freely open to the public, and contains an updated war memorial. The house was previously Oakenshaw Cottage, where John Mercer lived towards the end of his life. Mercer, a self-taught chemist born in Great Harwood, invented the mercerisation process for treating cotton which is still in use today. He was also a pioneer of colour photography.

Clayton-le-Moors is said to be a town of two halves. Residents were either &#x27;top-enders&#x27; or &#x27;bottom-enders&#x27;, depending on which side of the Whalley Road canal bridge they lived. The two communities had firm opinions about each other and were said to rarely mix. With the mixing of the town&#x27;s children at common schools, this is no longer the case but the distinction between top and bottom enders still remains. There was, however, an annual football match between them at the running track at Wilson&#x27;s Playing Fields (formerly the Woodlands Playing Fields), which lie behind woodland close to Sparth House in lower Whalley Road. The synthetic running track there is surrounded by football pitches, a cricket pitch and changing rooms. It also hosts Hyndburn parkrun, a timed 5 km run every Saturday morning.

==Governance==
Clayton-le-Moors was once a township in the ancient parish of Whalley, with Dunkenhalgh in the south-west and Hyndburn Brook forming the boundary with Rishton and Great Harwood as far as the River Calder. This became a civil parish in 1866. Between 1894 and 1974 the area was administered by an Urban District Council. As a consequence of the re-organisation of Local Government in 1974, Clayton became an unparished constituent of the Borough of Hyndburn, centered on Accrington.

==Demography==

<text>Arnarvatnsheiði () is a plateau in the west of Iceland. It belongs to the Highlands of Iceland.

It is situated to the north-east of the valley Reykholsdalur and the town Húsafell and to the north of the glacier Langjökull.

The region is very well known for the multitude of lakes with fishing in the summer. On the other hand, climate is rather rough like in the rest of the Highlands of Iceland.

To the southwest of Arnarvatnsheiði, there are the lava caves Surtshellir. In former times, outlaws used to live there. It was then common in Iceland to exclude people from society when they had committed crimes.

<doc id="674186" wikidata="Q482538" url="?curid=674186" title="Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion">
<text>The CH-53 Sea Stallion (Sikorsky S-65) is a family of American heavy-lift transport helicopters designed and built by the American manufacturer Sikorsky Aircraft. The Sea Stallion was originally developed in response to a request from the United States Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Naval Weapons made in March 1962 for a replacement for the Sikorsky CH-37 Mojave helicopters flown by the United States Marine Corps (USMC).

In July 1962, Sikorsky&#x27;s proposal, which was essentially a scaled-up S-61R fitted with twin General Electric T64 turboshaft engines and the dynamic systems of the S-64/CH-54, was selected. On 14 October 1964, the YCH-53A performed its maiden flight; the first deliveries of production CH-53s to operational units commenced on 12 September 1966. The first combat use of the type occurred during the following year when it was deployed to the Vietnamese theater; the CH-53 quickly proved its value for moving heavy payloads, particularly in the recovery of damaged aircraft.

Several variants of the type were promptly introduced. The United States Air Force introduced the HH-53 &quot;Super Jolly Green Giant&quot;, configured for special operations and combat search and rescue (CSAR) missions, during the latter part of the Vietnam War; the majority of these were subsequently rebuilt into the MH-53 Pave Low. The visually similar CH-53E Super Stallion is a heavier-lifting improved version of the rotorcraft, designated &quot;S-80E&quot; by Sikorsky; its third engine makes it more powerful than the Sea Stallion and thus displaced it for the heavy-lift mission. Furthermore, many early-build CH-53s were refitted with more powerful engines, while others were reconfigured for different mission roles, such as US presidential flights, training, and airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) operations.

Several export deals for the CH-53 were made, leading to several international operators of the type. Among these are Germany, Iran, and Israel. Several unusual or high-profile operations have been undertaken, such as the capture and transportation of a Soviet advanced radar system to Israel under Operation Rooster 53 in 1969, and Iran&#x27;s capture of five American CH-53s as a result of Operation Eagle Claw in 1980. Various operators deployed their CH-53s during international missions, often under the auspices of NATO or the United Nations, such as for UNSCOM in Iraq, in Kosovo with Kosovo Force (KFOR), Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. While several operators have opted to retain the type into the twenty-first century, many others have opted to supplement or withdraw their Sea Stallions in favor of other platforms, sometimes with the more powerful CH-53E. The CH-53 remains in service with German and Israeli forces, and is one of the largest military helicopters in service. Germany is planning to replace its fleet, as of the 2020s, with the latest version of the twin-rotor CH-47 Chinook. The latest version of the CH-53, the K model King Stallion is in production as of the 2020s entering service with the United States Marine Corps; this is replacing the Super Stallion, itself an upgraded version of Sea Stallion. The heavily upgraded Jolly Green Giant and Pave Low versions of the CH-53 were retired by 2008, flown by the U.S. Air Force for combat search and rescue. Overall, the CH-53 was replaced in many roles by the V-22 Osprey tilt rotor in U.S. service.

==Development==

===Origins===
In 1960, the United States Marine Corps (USMC) began to seek a replacement for their HR2S piston-powered helicopters. On 27 January 1961, the USMC began working with the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force on the &quot;Tri-Service VTOL transport&quot;, which would eventually emerge as the LTV XC-142 tiltwing. The design became more elaborate and the program stretched out, causing the USMC to drop out when they decided they would not receive a working machine in a satisfactory timeframe. In particular, there were concerns that the high levels of downwash produced by the XC-142A would render shipborne operations impractical. In the end, the XC-142A, although a very innovative and capable machine, never entered production.

In March 1962, the United States Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Naval Weapons, acting on behalf of the USMC, issued a request for a &quot;Heavy Helicopter Experimental / &quot;. The specifications dictated a load capability of with an operational radius of at a speed of . It was also specified to possess a higher top speed and greater lifting capacity than existing helicopters while also having a lower empty weight than preceding designs as well. The was to be used in the assault transport, aircraft recovery, personnel transport, and medical evacuation roles. In the assault transport role, it was to be mostly used to haul heavy equipment instead of troops.
In response, Boeing Vertol offered a modified version of the CH-47 Chinook; Kaman Aircraft offered a development of the British Fairey Rotodyne compound helicopter; and Sikorsky offered what amounted to a scaled-up version of the S-61R, with twin General Electric T64 turboshaft engines and the dynamic system of the S-64/CH-54, to be designated the S-65. Kaman&#x27;s proposal quickly died when the British government dropped its backing of the Rotodyne program. Competition between Boeing Vertol and Sikorsky was intense, with the Chinook having an advantage because it was being acquired by the United States Army. During July 1962, it was announced that Sikorsky&#x27;s bid had been selected as the winner on account of various considerations, including cost, technical factors, and production capability. However, a contract was not immediately forthcoming due to budgetary limitations.

The USMC had originally sought to procure four prototypes. However, in light of funding shortfalls, Sikorsky, determined to keep the deal, reduced their estimate for the program&#x27;s development costs by proposing that development could be performed with only two prototypes. Military officials favorably received the company&#x27;s proposed reduction; in September 1962, Sikorsky was awarded a $9,965,635 (~$ in ) contract for the production of a pair of YCH-53A prototypes, as well as a mockup and a ground-test airframe.

The development program did not go entirely smoothly, due to a shortage of engineering resources plus various failures of subcontractors and the government, but these problems were gradually overcome. There was also pressure against the program from U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara, who promoted the concept of &quot;commonality&quot; between the armed services by adopting the Chinook instead. However, the USMC managed to convince McNamara&#x27;s staff that the Chinook could not meet their requirements without numerous expensive changes.

The first YCH-53A performed its initial flight at the Sikorsky plant in Stratford, Connecticut, on 14 October 1964, about four months behind schedule. During the previous month, the USMC had already placed an initial production contract for 16 helicopters. Flight trials went more smoothly than expected, helping make up for the time lost in development; on 19 November 1964, the type was formally introduced to the general public. Around this time, it received the military designation and name &quot;CH-53A Sea Stallion&quot;. On 12 September 1966, the first deliveries of the CH-53 to an operational unit occurred.

===Further development===

The CH-53A arrived in Vietnam in January 1967 and proved useful, eventually recovering even more downed aircraft than the CH-54. A total of 141 CH-53As were built, including the two prototypes. The U.S. Navy acquired 15 CH-53As from the USMC in 1971 for airborne mine countermeasures (AMCM) activities. The helicopters had more powerful T64-GE-413 turboshafts installed and received the designation &quot;RH-53A&quot;.

The United States Air Force ordered the HH-53B in September 1966 and it first flew on 15 March 1967. It added a refueling probe, drop fuel tanks and a rescue hoist; it also featured upgraded T64-GE-3 engines. The Air Force used the HH-53B for combat search and rescue (CSAR). HH-53C was an improved CSAR variant with a smaller fuel tank in exchange for more armor and better communication systems. The CH-53C was similar except it lacked a refueling probe. It was used by the USAF for more general transport work.
Heavy lifting in tropical climates demanded more power, so the USMC decided to acquire an improved variant, the CH-53D, with uprated engines, originally the T64-GE-412 then later the T64-GE-413. The CH-53D also included an uprated transmission to go with the more powerful engines, and a revised interior to permit a load of 55 troops.

The initial flight of the CH-53D was on 27 January 1969. The CH-53D served alongside the CH-53A through the rest of the Vietnam War. A VIP transport version designated &quot;VH-53D&quot; with plush accommodations was used by the USMC for the US presidential flights. The US Navy also acquired CH-53D-based helicopters for minesweeping. These were designated &quot;RH-53D&quot; and included mine sweeping gear such as a pair of 0.50 BMG (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns for detonating mines. The Navy received 30 RH-53Ds beginning in 1973. After the RH-53Ds were in service, the RH-53As were handed back to the USMC and restored to CH-53A configuration.

During the 1980s, Israeli Air Force&#x27;s CH-53 &quot;Yas&#x27;ur&quot; fleet was upgraded by Israel Aircraft Industries and Elbit Systems. The project – which ended only in 1997 – improved the CH-53 avionics, robustness and extended its life span by at least two decades.

In 1989, some of the CH-53As being retired by the USMC were passed on to the U.S. Air Force for training, with these helicopters redesignated &quot;TH-53As&quot;. The TH-53As were stripped of most operational equipment and painted in USAF camouflage colors.

==Design==
The Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion is a heavy lift military transport helicopter. The CH-53A carries a crew of four; pilot, copilot, crew chief, and an aerial observer. It can carry various payloads, including up to 38 fully-equipped troops, 24 litters with medical attendants, an internal cargo load of , or an external load of on the single-point sling hook. Access to the main cabin is via the large passenger door on the right side of the fuselage behind the cockpit, as well as by a power-operated loading ramp to the rear. This loading ramp was capable of facilitating drive-on loading operations, enabling quicker cargo movements. The CH-53A was designed to have a useful payload capacity, in terms of weight, of almost half of the rotorcraft&#x27;s empty weight.

It is provisioned with mechanical flight controls, which are backed by three independent hydraulic systems. As noted by Sikorsky engineer Edward S Carter Junior, the rotorcraft could be equipped to facilitate all-weather operations. It shares a somewhat similar fuselage design, albeit on a substantially larger scale, with the Sikorsky S-61R series. While the Sea Stallion&#x27;s fuselage is watertight, the helicopter is not intended for amphibious use and its ability to land on water is meant to only be used in emergency situations. To save space, which is normally at a premium on board most naval vessels, both the tail boom and the rotors can be folded while the helicopter is stowed; to reduce the workload involved in this process, an automated folding system was developed by Sikorsky. Both the crew and vital systems are protected by armoring across key areas. All of the fuel was housed within sponsons on either side of the fuselage. The CH-53A was typically equipped with a pair of 7.62×51mm NATO M60 machine guns that point out to each side of the fuselage.

The CH-53A features a fully-articulated six-bladed main rotor and four-bladed tail rotor. According to Carter, the relatively high speed requirement stipulated by the USMC was the primary factor shaping the dynamic design. While the Sea Stallion&#x27;s dynamic systems were largely derived from those used on the earlier Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane, substantial reengineering were also involved due to the vastly different operating requirements. Extensive use of titanium was made across its dynamic components, particularly for elements that may have been susceptible to degradation over time due to metal fatigue. Initially, the CH-53 was powered by a pair of General Electric T64-6 turboshaft engines, each of which provided up to . These engines were located on the upper fuselage. Later engines included the T64-1, capable of generating up to , and the T64-16, which was rated for up to . The HH-53B model featured T64-3 engines, which produced up to .
The improved CH-53D features uprated engines, initially using the T64-GE-412 that could provide up to , then the T64-413 with its further elevated output of ; these more powerful engines necessitated the use of an uprated transmission. Interior changes included additional seats, which allowed for up to 55 troops to be carried at a time. The CH-53D is generally armed with twin .50 BMG (12.7 mm) M2/XM218 machine guns. During the type&#x27;s later years of service, it has become commonplace for CH-53Ds to have been retrofitted with various defensive countermeasures; such apparatus has often included an AN/ALE-39 chaff dispenser and an AN/ALQ-157 infrared countermeasure.

Later production CH-53Ds featured a Blade Inspection Method (BIM) scheme to detect cracks in its metal rotors. BIM involved pressurizing the interior of the rotor blades with nitrogen. If a crack is present pressure is lost and a red indicator on the rotor blade tip was tripped. Later, the BIM system was connected to a cockpit display. BIM reduced the need to routinely swap rotor blades.

==Operational history==

===United States===
The CH-53/HH-53 has seen considerable use in warzones and served in various conflict during its service. It was first used in the Vietnam War, often recovering downed aircraft and evacuating personnel. The CH-53D served alongside the CH-53A through the latter portion of the US&#x27;s presence in Vietnam; both types played a critical role at the end of the conflict, performing evacuations of personnel during Operation Frequent Wind.

U.S. Air Force HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giants were the primary search-and-rescue helicopter in Southeast Asia between 1967 and 1975, inserted the Operation Ivory Coast rescue team into the North Vietnamese prison camp at Son Tay in 1970, and carried the USMC and Air Force Security Forces who attempted to rescue the crew of SS &quot;Mayagüez&quot;. Marine-flown Navy Sea Stallions were the rotary-wing element of Operation Eagle Claw, the attempted rescue of American hostages in Iran in 1980 that ended in disaster and embarrassment at &quot;Desert One&quot;. Marine CH-53s were used in Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury.
The CH-53 was operated by the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. It is also operated by all three services in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. It was in the Afghan theatre than the final operational missions of the CH-53D fleet were performed during February 2012.

On 17 September 2007, VMM-263 of the USMC was deployed with ten MV-22B Ospreys, a tiltrotor aircraft. The V-22 has been the primary replacement for the USMC&#x27;s fleets of CH-53Ds and CH-46E Sea Knights, but not the more powerful CH-53Es; instead, the in-development CH-53K is planned to supplant the Navy and USMC CH-53E fleets.

During September 2011, HMH-463 replaced its CH-53Ds with CH-53Es. HMH-363 and HMH-362 are to operate D-models until the squadrons are deactivated. Both units are to be reactivated as MV-22 and CH-53K squadrons respectively. Several CH-53D helicopters will be retained for the 3rd Marine Regiment for training. HMH-362 retired the last CH-53Ds after its combat deployment in August 2012 and decommissioned in November 2012.

===Israel===
In August 1968, an Israeli Air Force (IAF) delegation visited Sikorsky&#x27;s Connecticut plant while seeking information to select the service&#x27;s next assault helicopter. The delegation was looking for a helicopter with augmented payload carry capacity, highly maneuverable and robust, that could survive direct hits from different caliber projectiles. They examined Boeing&#x27;s CH-47 Chinook and Sikorsky&#x27;s CH-53, it was recognised that the latter was both larger and stronger than any of the IAF&#x27;s other helicopters, and thus represented a major advancement in terms of capability. Based upon experience gained from the intense combat of the then-recently fought Six-Day War, the delegation opted to favor the CH-53.
On 2 October 1969, the first S-65C-3 (CH-53D) helicopters were delivered to Israel of an initial order of seven. At the time, the country was engaged in the War of Attrition, and thus the type was quickly dispatched into combat. Receiving the Hebrew name &quot;Yas&#x27;ur&quot; (Petrel), a further 35 helicopter were delivered to fulfil subsequent orders. On 6 August 1970, the first Yas&#x27;ur squadron was established. For several decades, the type has served as the primary cargo helicopters of the IAF, being routinely used to carry both troops and heavy equipment.

In 1969, during the War of Attrition, IAF CH-53s landed in Egypt and conveyed a captured Soviet advanced radar system back to Israel for examination by Israeli scientists and engineers (see &quot;Operation Rooster 53&quot;). The Yas&#x27;ur was also used in various other capacities during the conflict, including the retrieval of a navigator from a downed IAF F-4 Phantom II under sustained enemy fire on 30 June 1970.
During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Yas&#x27;ur routinely moved artillery batteries and for the insertion of IDF units around the fronts. The type was also used to evacuate hundreds of wounded soldiers and rescued pilots from behind enemy lines in both Egypt and Syria. In one engagement, a single Yas&#x27;ur was attacked by multiple aircraft, including a pair of MiG-21s; while sustaining damage, it was still able to return to base. Since 1973, Yas&#x27;urs have also been used by the IDF to land and extract Sayeret commandos on raids and patrols deep behind enemy lines in Lebanon Syria and the greater Middle East.

During the 1980s, Israel Aircraft Industries, along with Elbit Systems, commenced a major upgrade program for the IAF Yas&#x27;ur fleet. The project, which was completed in 1997, improved the CH-53&#x27;s avionics and increased its robustness, as well as extending the fleet&#x27;s operating life by at least two decades.

Several Yas&#x27;urs were used to perform firefighting operations on and around 1989 Mount Carmel forest fire. They performed dozens of low flyovers into the smoke and flames, dumped 700 tons of water on the fire, and doused it. On 8 November 1992, a pair of CH-53s performed one of the IAF&#x27;s longest-distance sea rescue operations to retrieve passenger from the distressed yacht &quot;Fantasy 2&quot; off the coast of Sudan.

During the 2006 Lebanon War, Hezbollah shot down an Israeli CH-53 Yas&#x27;ur with an anti-tank missile, killing five air crew members. This was reportedly the only combat loss of an Israeli CH-53 during this conflict.

On 16 August 2012, the IAF temporarily grounded its CH-53 fleet following one having experienced in-flight difficulties that led to an emergency landing; initial reports state the issue was related to the rotor blades. The fleet was again grounded for three weeks after a CH-53 was destroyed by a fire during a training exercise; the IAF subsequently attributed this loss to a defective component and blamed Lockheed Martin for failing to communicate the issue.
During 2015, it was announced that Israel planned to withdraw the last of its Yasurs around 2025. Replacement options studied included the CH-53K and the CH-47F Chinook, with a prospective order for approximately 20 helicopters being placed for the preferred option. During February 2021, the Israeli Ministry of Defense announced the selection of the CH-53K to replace the Yasur fleet.

On 7 October 2023, during the first day of the Israel-Hamas war, and the first time since the 2006 Lebanon War in a similar incident, Hamas shot down an IAF CH-53 with an anti-tank rocket and hitting its left engine, while carrying about 50 paratroopers (a very unusual procedure, as opposed to the approved IAF&#x27;s max capacity of 33 troops). The pilot managed to land safely in an open field, offloading both the aircrew and the paratroopers. The CH-53 was then hit by a second anti-tank rocket, completely destroying the helicopter. The occupants survived the attack with minor to medium injuries.

===Iran===
During the 1970s, an initial fleet of six RH-53D Sea Stallions was delivered to the Imperial Iranian Navy (IIN). Following the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Sea Stallions continued in service with the renamed Islamic Republic of Iran Navy (IRIN). These were supplemented by five U.S. Navy examples that were abandoned during Operation Eagle Claw in 1980. Despite US sanctions that have blocked the nation from acquiring spares and support from overseas, Iran has reportedly been able to keep at least a portion of their Sea Stallions in an operational condition; this effort has been aided by illegal exports of controlled parts to Iran by US citizens.

===Germany===
In 1966, the German military evaluated both the CH-53 and CH-47 as a replacement for the H-21 and H-34G helicopters with an initial requirement for 133. The purchase of the CH-53 was approved in June 1968 but due to budget constraints only 110 were ordered. Following the delivery in 1969 of two pre-production helicopters from Sikorsky the production aircraft were licence built by VFW-Fokker at Speyer in Germany. The first German-built CH-53G Mittlerer Transporthubschrauber helicopter flew from Speyer on 11 October 1971 and was delivered to the Erprobungsstelle der Bundeswehr 61 flight test center at Manching on 1 December 1971.

The German Army Aviation Corps received 110 type CH-53Gs, derivatives of the CH-53D, between 1971 and 1975. 108 helicopters were built in Germany by VFW-Fokker. The first flight by a German CH-53G was made in 1971, followed in March 1973 by the delivery of the first machines to Heeresfliegerregiment (HFlgRgt, Army Aviation Corps Regiment) 35 in Mendig, and shortly afterwards to the newly formed Army Aviation Corps Regiment 15 based at Rheine and Army Aviation Corps Regiment 25 based at Laupheim.
To meet ever more demanding specifications, over time the CH-53G received modifications from 1990 designed to improve its service life and operational capabilities. These involved three major upgrades: new missile warning and self-protection systems; provision for two external fuel tanks allowing range to be increased to when carrying 36 armed soldiers or a payload; and addition of a night vision goggles-compatible cockpit for night low-level flying capabilities. All CH-53Gs were upgraded by Eurocopter Germany by early 2001, resulting in updated GS/GE/GA variants. As a result of foreign military operations 20 CH-53G helicopters were converted to perform Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) missions. Version CH-53GS is equipped with modernized IFR equipment, additional exterior fuel tanks, low-flight night vision cockpit and NVG, partial ballistic protection, engine dust collectors, missile counter measure and self-defence armament. Additionally the original engines were replaced by the more powerful T64-100 engines.
German Army Aviation Corps units have carried out a wide range of international missions under the auspices of NATO and the UN, providing transport for members of UNSCOM in Iraq, serving in Kosovo with KFOR, with IFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and more recently with ISAF in Afghanistan. On 1 January 2013, all Army Aviation Corps CH-53Gs were transferred to the German Air Force and incorporated into Helicopter Wing 64.

During the 2010s, Germany was reportedly considering options for replacing its aging CH-53G fleet, with candidates including the Chinook and the CH-53K model. On 29 September 2020, the German Ministry of Defense cancelled the &quot;Schwerer Transporthubschrauber&quot; (STH) heavy-lifting helicopter program for 45 to 60 helicopters after the initiative was judged to be too expensive and stated that its CH-53Gs fleet would be replaced following a period of reexamination. In 2022, the Federal Government announced that all of Germany&#x27;s CH-53s would be replaced by 60 CH-47Fs.

===Austria===

During 1970, a pair of S-65C-2 or S-65Ö (equivalent to the CH-53D standard, albeit without the aerial refuelling probe) helicopters were delivered to Austria. Intended primarily to perform airborne rescue operations in the Alps, they were assigned to 1st Helicopter Wing of the Austrian Air Force, making the service the second foreign operator of the CH-53. Their equipment included same rescue hoist as the HH-53 and fittings for auxiliary fuel tanks and accommodation for 38 passengers. Although they performed well in high altitude operations, the type&#x27;s relatively high operating costs were a major contributing factor in Austria&#x27;s decision to sell both rotorcraft to Israel in 1981. However, since the 1999 Galtür avalanche, in which over 7000 thousand people had transported by international collaboration of helicopter resources from Austria, USA, German, France, and Switzerland including 50 helicopters, more helicopter resources have been pursued.

===Mexico===
During 2003, the Fuerza Aérea Mexicana (FAM) acquired four surplus CH-53D Sea Stallions from Israel at a combined cost of $25 million (~$ in ). Prior to their delivery in 2005, all helicopters were upgraded to the Yasur 2000 standard. Due to restricted budgets, only two were actually operated by 104th Air Squadron, while the other pair served as a source of spare parts. Their initial missions were troop transport and commando insertion, but their principal mission was subsequently changed to performing rescue and disaster relief operations, being relocated to BAM 8 at Yucatán. By 2013, all examples had been permanently withdrawn from service.

===Civil use===
During 2007, the first commercially owned CH-53D was being converted by the Californian company Heavy Lift Helicopters into a firefighting configuration, which was referred to by the firm as the &quot;Fire Stallion&quot; Having acquired a batch of six ex-military CH-53Ds, the company planned to make them available for hire by other operators; in addition to fire-fighting, construction work and general transport duties were envisioned for the fleet. While the fleet reportedly flew for a handful of years, they entered storage after only a short period of use due to component shortages.

William H. &quot;Sonny&quot; Coke; Co-Pilot Capt James B. Huff; Crew Chief SSgt. Gary J. &quot;Butch&quot; Lester; Sgt. Timothy A. &quot;Tim&quot; Creighton; and chaplain, Navy Cdr. David R. Morrison. The Sea Stallion was part of Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron-777.
* On 27 April 1983, a CH-53D crashed in the Atlantic off the coast of Virginia. The crash resulted in the drowning of Marine 1st Lt David A. Boyle. The suit brought by Boyle&#x27;s father went to the Supreme Court.
* On 24 March 1984, a CH-53D crashed into a mountain in South Korea during a night troop operation, killing 29.
* On 6 May 1985, a CH-53D experienced a transmission failure and fell into Sea of Japan, killing 17. It was returning to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from MCAS Iwakuni, Yamaguchi Prefecture.
* On 29 December 1988, an Israeli Yas&#x27;ur crashed during a border-stone laying mission at the Israel-Egypt border. Investigation determined that high-frequency heterodyne vibration, induced by a late control column attitude correction during hover by the pilot (the sole fatality), caused a structural failure; the separation of the aircraft&#x27;s tail and its immediate, rapid counter-rotation and subsequent crash. The three remaining occupants were injured. A footage of this crash can be viewed on-line. A system of dampers to prevent rapid correction and thus the heterodyne vibrations, has been installed since on the remaining Yas&#x27;ur helicopters.
* On 20 March 1989, a Sea Stallion crashed while on maneuvers off mountainous east coast of South Korea, near P&#x27;ohang. Nineteen on board were killed. Sixteen other marines, including one on the ground, were injured in the crash.
* On 18 May 1990, a USMC CH-53D en route to Marine Corps Air Station Tustin crashed in Imperial County, California, killing one crew member and injuring five others. In climbing flight, a pitch lock engaged in one main rotor blade causing a violent vibration that resulted in the tail rotor departing the aircraft at AGL. Torque and rapid rotation contributed to the aircraft breaking apart further just aft of the main transmission. Auto-rotation resulted a bounce, roll over and fire. Auxiliary tanks were attached. More than 200 servicemen had been killed in accidents involving the CH-53A, CH-53D, and CH-53E from 1969 to 1990.
* On 14 March 1994, a CH-53D landed tail-first and burst into flames on a military runway in Northern California. One marine was killed and four marines were injured.
* On 4 February 1997, two CH-53s collided in Israel. A total of 73 people died in the accident.
* On 21 December 2002, a CH-53G of the German Army Aviation Corps&#x27; Medium Transport Helicopter Regiment 25 crashed near Kabul killing all seven occupants. An investigation following the accident concluded that the crash was caused by mechanical failure.
* On 23 November 2003, a MH-53M crashed near Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. Five U.S. servicemen were killed.
* On 13 August 2004, a USMC CH-53D from Marine Corps Air Station Futenma crashed into Okinawa International University on Okinawa, Japan. No serious damage or injuries resulted but the crash caused an international incident because of strained relations about the US use of Futenma. The crash was caused by a maintenance error.
*On 17 February 2006, two USMC CH-53E helicopters collided and then crashed into the Gulf of Aden in the vicinity of Ras Siyyan, northern Djibouti, while flying a training mission in the Godoria Range area. The crash resulted in the death of eight Marines and two airmen who were supporting Operation Enduring Freedom. The Marines and airmen were deployed to Djibouti as part of the Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa.
* On 28 November 2008, CH-53G Registratin 84+36 of the German Army Aviation Corps&#x27; Medium Helicopter Transport Regiment 25 had a hard landing during an exercise at an altitude of 6,900 feet (2,300 m) near Engelberg in the Swiss Alps, injuring one of the six occupants.

<text>The City of Nedlands is a local government area in the inner western suburbs of the Western Australian capital city of Perth, about west of Perth&#x27;s central business district. The city is situated within the western suburbs of the metropolitan area—known colloquially as the “golden triangle” for the concentration of wealth and high housing values.

==History==
The City of Nedlands originated in the Claremont Road District, which was established on 30 March 1893 after a petition from ratepayers who lived in the areas of Nedlands and Claremont, which had grown substantially in population at the end of the 19th century. Seven men were nominated to the new Board, which became the first local government authority for the Nedlands/Claremont area.

In 1898, Claremont itself split away to form a municipal government, which still exists today as the Town of Claremont.

It was renamed the Nedlands Road District on 12 August 1932 and given municipal status as the Municipality of Nedlands on 17 February 1956. It then assumed its current name when it was granted city status on 1 July 1959. The city was made up of four wards – Melvista, Hollywood, Dalkeith and Coastal. These wards continue to the present day.

Following an unsuccessful effort to amalgamate metropolitan local governments in 2016, the state government expanded the boundary of the City of Perth to incorporate a portion of the City of Nedlands that included the University of Western Australia and surrounding residential areas.

Following the change of government in the 2017 state election, the City of Nedlands experienced sustained political pressure to accommodate infill development and higher residential densities. The failure of Council to cooperate in replacing the city&#x27;s 30-year old planning scheme led to the imposition of a new planning scheme by the Minister of Planning. A subsequent spate of development applications led to significant community unrest and opposition and contributed to the resignations of key executive staff (including the chief executive officer and director of planning) and the mayor.

==Wards==
The town is divided into four wards, each electing three councillors. The mayor is directly elected.

* Coastal Ward
* Dalkeith Ward
* Hollywood Ward
* Melvista Ward

==Mayor==

The current mayor of the City of Nedlands, since July 2021, is Fiona Argyle.

<doc id="674196" wikidata="Q626295" url="?curid=674196" title="Ararat, Victoria">
<text>Ararat () is a town in the Central Highlands region in Victoria, Australia, about west of Melbourne, on the Western Highway on the eastern slopes of the Ararat Hills and Cemetery Creek valley between Victoria&#x27;s Western District and the Wimmera. 

The source of the Hopkins River is a few kilometres to the east below Telegraph Hill.

Its urban population according to 2021 census is 8,500 and services the region of 11,880 residents across the Rural City&#x27;s boundaries. It is also the home of the 2018/19 GMGA Golf Championship Final.

It is the largest settlement in the Rural City of Ararat local government area and is the administrative centre.

The discovery of gold in 1857 during the Victorian gold rush transformed it into a boomtown which continued to prosper until the turn of the 20th century, after which it has steadily declined in population. It was proclaimed as a city on 24 May 1950. After a decline in population over the 1980s and 90s, there has been a small but steady increase in the population, and it is the site of many existing and future, large infrastructure projects, including the Hopkins Correctional Facility development project.

It is named after Mount Ararat 10 kilometres south-west of the town which was named by politician/pastoralist Horatio Wills in 1841.

Ararat is the only city in Australia founded by Chinese people.

== History ==
Prior to the European settlement of Australia, Ararat was inhabited by the Djab wurrung group of Aboriginal Australian people. The area encompassing Ararat has many Djabwurrung language placenames; &#x27;Karangajaruk&#x27; refers to &#x27;the valley in which Cathcart and the Ararat (gold) diggings lie&#x27;, &#x27;Warrayatkin&#x27; refers to Green Hill Lake, &#x27;Butingitch&#x27; refers to the Ararat town site, &#x27;Gorambeep barak&#x27; refers to Mount Ararat, and &#x27;Pandort&#x27; refers to a large waterhole to the south.

Europeans first settled in the Grampians region in the 1840s after surveyor Thomas Mitchell passed through the area in 1836. In 1841, Horatio Wills, on his way to selecting country further south, wrote in his diary, &quot;like the Ark we rested&quot; and named a nearby hill Mt Ararat. It is from this entry and the nearby Mount that the town takes its name. 

When gold was first discovered most activity was west of the current town. The first Post Office opened in Cathcart on 1 February 1856 before being transferred to the current town on 31 August 1857. One month later the Gold Warden relocated to the current town. The current town was known for a time as Canton Lead. A tender was issued by the Public Works Office in 1858 for a cookhouse for the Police at Canton Lead. Until 1859 the local courts were the Canton Lead Court of Petty Sessions.

=== Gold in &amp; around Ararat ===
Alluvial gold was first discovered in the Ararat area in May 1854 at Pinky Point on the Denicull Creek. (A memorial can be found on the corner of the Ararat - Halls Gap Road (C222) and Better Route Road 5km west of Ararat. Pinky Point is to the north.) By June that year 30 claims were being worked by 200 men across what was first called the Mt William field.

Other leads were quickly discovered in nearby creeks including Spring Gully . This discovery led to the establishment of the town of Cathcart (near where Spring Lead Road meets the C222). Gold was also discovered in Armstrong towards Great Western.

The alluvial rush peaked in 1857 when gold was discovered at Cambell’s Diggings (Moyston) and in the Canton lead by a party of Chinese miners en route to the Central Victorian gold fields. The Canton lead swung around the west side of the current town centre from the Gum San Chinese Heritage Centre along the current alignment of Banfield Street between View Point and Laby Streets. The Gum San Chinese Heritage Centre commemorates the history of the substantial Chinese community in Ararat.

By 1864, most of the 1,500 miners were reworking the known leads with puddling machines, sluices and Long Toms. Returns were diminishing and the 1865-1866 drought brought this phase of full-time gold mining to an end.Between 1866 and the early 1870s there were investments in deep lead mining. None were profitable and all closed. Investment in quartz mining and crushing was more successful. Inspired by the success of the Campbell’s Reef operation other companies including in 1867 the Noah’s Ark Company in Ararat that operated a 24 horsepower steam engine and 8 stamping heads. By 1870 the only profitable quartz mine was on the Ryhmney Reef.

In 1870 investment flowed into hydraulic sluicing. By building reservoirs and carefully contouring the aqueducts or channels these companies could wash out the gold bearing soil on the higher ground which the alluvial miners had not been able to reach. The Norval Dam on the Ryhmney Road and the half kilometre of sluice constructed in 1875 enabled sluicing of Curtis Hill and Oppossum Gully.

Attention in the 1880s turned back to deep lead mining including on the Black Lead. This lead ran from Albert Street and McGibbony Street east to the rail line and the Hopkins River. In 1881 the Grand Junction Company began to pump groundwater from a depth of 50m. By 1883, they were pumping 13Ml a day which enabled them to begin to extract gold from the Black Lead. Unable to make a profit, the mine closed in 1885.

Similar difficulties were faced by all deep lead speculators including well after the turn of the century. The only company to have longer term success was the Cathcart Proprietary Company (Denicull Creek) which switched to electric power, and in 1905 employed 100 men. The Company achieved ‘sensational yields’ in 1909. This success stimulated the formation of at least ten other deep lead companies. Three, including the Cathcart Company, proved profitable. But by 1925 all had closed. A final effort at deep lead mining in 1932 failed before achieving production, ending what might be called the professional gold era in Ararat.

The area still attracts enthusiasts who report finding valuable nuggets. &#x27;Ararat’s main goldfields have produced a great deal of gold to detector operators and will continue to do so for many years.&#x27;

The rapid growth generated by gold brought about a municipality, which was incorporated as a borough on 24 September 1858.

In the aftermath of the goldrush, Ararat soon became known for its asylum. The Aradale Mental Hospital opened in 1865 with the former the Ararat County Gaol converted in 1887 to J Ward, a psychiatric facility for the criminally insane. The Hospital remained open as a treatment facility until 1997 and has since become the site for paranormal and haunted house tours.

Vines were planted in 1863 by Swiss settlers, the Pola family.

==Traditional ownership claims==

The formally recognised traditional owners for the area in which Ararat sits, north-west of Campbell Street and the Pyrenees Highway and north-east of the Western Highway and Lambert Street are the Wotjobaluk, Jardwadjali (also known as Jaadwa), Wergaia and Jupagalk nations.

Several buildings survive from the first decade of the Ararat gold rush including the bluestone Sub-Treasury &amp; Assay Office, the neighbouring Telegraph &amp; Post Office and the brick Court House on Barkly Street. All sit on the Police Camp block, which was bounded by Barkly, Ligar, High and Ingor Streets. 

==== Sub-Treasury &amp; Assay Office 1858 ====
Sub-Treasuries were established at major gold fields from the late 1850s onwards by the Victorian Government to receive and hold the gold recovered from the diggings. There were Sub-Treasuries at Ballarat, Castlemaine, Beechworth, Sandhurst [Bendigo], Maryborough and Ararat. Several survive. The Sub-Treasury building in Beechworth (1856) which was repurposed as the in the 1880s as the Police Station is one. The main (Old) Treasury Building in Melbourne was completed in 1862.

The Ararat Sub-Treasury &amp; Assay Office (1858) was the sixth to be opened. The value of the gold received by the Ararat Sub-Treasury in that year was £29,820 7sh 2d with a value in the 2020s in the order of $15m. 

(The Victoria Heritage Database records the 1993 relocation to Ballarat of the wooden flat-pack building (1857) used by the Ararat Gold Warden and originally located in Campbell Street, Ararat.)

==== Telegraph &amp; Post Office 1861 ====
The Telegraph &amp; Post Office (1861), is one of the oldest surviving Post Office buildings in Victoria. 

It was the first Victorian Post Office to be designed in the Italianate style with, for example, an arched arcade or loggia (since filled in). Under the influence of William Wardle, who had been appointed Inspector-General and Chief Architect at the beginning of 1861, many more Victorian Post Offices were constructed in this style including for example the Post Office in Stawell. The Ararat building is unusual among Post Offices in that the bluestone wall has not been rendered.

In 1861 the mail to Melbourne closed at 07:00 and the inbound Melbourne mail was scheduled for 14:30.

Following completion of the building, the Telegraph Office moved in. The town had been linked by telegraph since1858 when the line was extended from Ballarat via a Post Office that was variously called Raglan, Firey Creek, or Beaufort. The telegraph went live on Thursday 11 November 1858. Reporting the first communication on the line, a journalist wrote ‘Now through the click click, of the small mysterious brass apparatus we find ourselves within a minute of Melbourne’.

1876, the Post Office incorporated the Sub-Treasury Building. 

In April 1888 the Mayor asked the Postmaster General to provide the building with a clock, which was added in 1889.

==== Court House 1866 - 1867 ====
In the 1850s the jurisdiction of the Ararat Courts expanded rapidly. In 1857 the Court of Petty Sessions, County Court and Gold Fields Local Court District all sat in Ararat. In 1859 was added the Court of Mines and a General Sessions District that could consider criminal cases. These Courts sat in a bluestone building on the corner of High and Vincent Streets that is now the site of the municipal offices. By the time the current building was completed the Ararat Courts had been included in the Supreme Court Circuit. Today the Courthouse is used for Magistrates’ and Children’s Court sittings. 

The distinctive building with its two-colour brickwork is in the Free Classical style as are other court houses of the time including the old Court House in Beaufort.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===

The main form of transport is road transport and motor vehicles. According to the 2006 Census, 88% of people traveled to work by motor vehicle, the vast majority of which traveled by automobile. Ararat is situated at the junction of several main roads including the Western Highway via High Street (running eastward to Ballarat and Melbourne and westward to Horsham and Adelaide); the Pyrenees Highway via Vincent Street (running east to Avoca and Maryborough); Ararat-Pomonal Road via Barkly Street (westward towards Halls Gap) and the Mortlake-Ararat Road via Vincent Street (running south with connections to the west and Hamilton, south and Warrnambool and to the east and Geelong). Ararat&#x27;s urban area streets are laid out in grid plan. Roads are also important for public transport. Ararat Transit provides 120 bus services on three routes 6 days a week, connecting with train services. According to the 2006 Census, just 4 persons in Ararat traveled to work by bus. Taxi services are provided by Ararat Cabs (since November 2010), provides 6 normal taxi-cabs and 1 wheel-chair bus, capable of 2 wheelchairs or 10 standard passengers.

Rail transport includes both passenger rail and freight rail. The city&#x27;s only station is Ararat&#x27;s railway station which is on the Ararat railway line and is the terminal train station for the Ararat V/Line rail service. Twice daily peak VLocity services run to Ballarat (53 minutes) and on to Melbourne (133–143 minutes), with some trains stopping at stations in between. The rail station is at the junction of the Ararat line, the Western standard gauge railway and Avoca railway. &quot;The Overland&quot; runs to Melbourne twice weekly (140 minutes) and travel to Adelaide is also possible (8 hours).

A regional airport, Ararat Airport YARA (ARY) is located 5 km south of the city on the Western Highway and provides for general aviation.

=== Health ===

Ararat &amp; District Hospital (established in 1850) is a major regional hospital and is coordinated by the East Grampians Health Service and Ararat Medical Centre.

=== Utilities ===
Water and waste-water services are supplied by Grampians-Wimmera-Mallee Water (GWMWater). Ararat&#x27;s water supply source is a combination of Mt Cole Reservoir and Lake Fyans, with the smaller Langi Ghiran (Picnic Road) Reservoir also part of the water supply system. Olivers Gully and Copes Hill reservoirs provide additional water storage.

<doc id="674200" wikidata="Q841423" url="?curid=674200" title="Upper limb">
<text>The upper [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]]s or upper extremities are the forelimbs of an upright-postured tetrapod vertebrate, extending from the scapulae and clavicles down to and including the digits, including all the musculatures and ligaments involved with the shoulder, elbow, wrist and knuckle joints. In humans, each upper limb is divided into the shoulder, arm, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand, and is primarily used for climbing, lifting and manipulating objects. In anatomy, just as arm refers to the upper arm, leg refers to the lower leg.

==Definition==
In formal usage, the term &quot;arm&quot; only refers to the structures from the shoulder to the elbow, explicitly excluding the forearm, and thus &quot;upper limb&quot; and &quot;arm&quot; are not synonymous. However, in casual usage, the terms are often used interchangeably. The term &quot;upper arm&quot; is redundant in anatomy, but in informal usage is used to distinguish between the two terms.

==Structure==
In the human body, the muscles of the upper limb can be classified by origin, topography, function, or innervation. While a grouping by innervation reveals embryological and phylogenetic origins, the functional-topographical classification below reflects the similarity in action between muscles (with the exception of the shoulder girdle, where muscles with similar action can vary considerably in their location and orientation.

===Musculoskeletal system===

====Shoulder girdle====
The shoulder girdle or pectoral girdle, composed of the clavicle and the scapula, connects the upper limb to the axial skeleton through the sternoclavicular joint (the only joint in the upper limb that directly articulates with the trunk), a ball and socket joint supported by the subclavius muscle which acts as a dynamic ligament. While this muscle prevents dislocation in the joint, strong forces tend to break the clavicle instead. The acromioclavicular joint, the joint between the acromion process on the scapula and the clavicle, is similarly strengthened by strong ligaments, especially the coracoclavicular ligament which prevents excessive lateral and medial movements. Between them these two joints allow a wide range of movements for the shoulder girdle, much because of the lack of a bone-to-bone contact between the scapula and the axial skeleton. The pelvic girdle is, in contrast, firmly fixed to the axial skeleton, which increases stability and load-bearing capabilities.
The mobility of the shoulder girdle is supported by a large number of muscles. The most important of these are muscular sheets rather than fusiform or strap-shaped muscles and they thus never act in isolation but with some fibres acting in coordination with fibres in other muscles.
; Muscles: of shoulder girdle excluding the glenohumeral joint
:; Migrated from head: Trapezius, sternocleidomastoideus, omohyoideus
:; Posterior: Rhomboideus major, rhomboideus minor, levator scapulae
:; Anterior: Subclavius, pectoralis minor, serratus anterior

====Shoulder joint====

The glenohumeral joint (colloquially called the shoulder joint) is the highly mobile ball and socket joint between the glenoid cavity of the scapula and the head of the humerus. Lacking the passive stabilisation offered by ligaments in other joints, the glenohumeral joint is actively stabilised by the rotator cuff, a group of short muscles stretching from the scapula to the humerus. Little inferior support is available to the joint and dislocation of the shoulder almost exclusively occurs in this direction.
The large muscles acting at this joint perform multiple actions and seemingly simple movements are often the result of composite antagonist and protagonist actions from several muscles. For example, pectoralis major is the most important arm flexor and latissimus dorsi the most important extensor at the glenohumeral joint, but, acting together, these two muscles cancel each other&#x27;s action leaving only their combined medial rotation component. On the other hand, to achieve pure flexion at the joint the deltoid and supraspinatus must cancel the adduction component and the teres minor and infraspinatus the medial rotation component of pectoralis major. Similarly, abduction (moving the arm away from the body) is performed by different muscles at different stages. The first 10° is performed entirely by the supraspinatus, but beyond that fibres of the much stronger deltoid are in position to take over the work until 90°. To achieve the full 180° range of abduction the arm must be rotated medially and the scapula most be rotated about itself to direct the glenoid cavity upward.
; Muscles: of shoulder joint proper
:; Posterior: Supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, subscapularis, deltoideus, latissimus dorsi, teres major
:; Anterior: Pectoralis major, coracobrachialis

====Bones of upper limb====
The bones forming the human upper limb are
* Clavicle
* Scapula
* Humerus
* Radius
* Ulna
* Carpal bones
** Scaphoid
** Lunate
** Triquetral
** Pisiform
** Trapezium
** Trapezoid
** Capitate
** Hamate
* 5 Metacarpal bones
* 14 Phalanges
====Arm====
The arm proper (&quot;brachium&quot;), sometimes called the upper arm, the region between the shoulder and the elbow, is composed of the humerus with the elbow joint at its distal end.

The elbow joint is a complex of three joints — the humeroradial, humeroulnar, and superior radioulnar joints — the former two allowing flexion and extension whilst the latter, together with its inferior namesake, allows supination and pronation at the wrist. Triceps is the major extensor and brachialis and biceps the major flexors. Biceps is, however, the major supinator and while performing this action it ceases to be an effective flexor at the elbow.
; Muscles: of the arm
:; Posterior: Triceps brachii, anconeus
:; Anterior: Brachialis, biceps brachii

====Forearm====
The forearm (), composed of the radius and ulna; the latter is the main distal part of the elbow joint, while the former composes the main proximal part of the wrist joint.

Most of the large number of muscles in the forearm are divided into the wrist, hand, and finger extensors on the dorsal side (back of hand) and the ditto flexors in the superficial layers on the ventral side (side of palm). These muscles are attached to either the lateral or medial epicondyle of the humerus. They thus act on the elbow, but, because their origins are located close to the centre of rotation of the elbow, they mainly act distally at the wrist and hand. Exceptions to this simple division are brachioradialis — a strong elbow flexor — and palmaris longus — a weak wrist flexor which mainly acts to tense the palmar aponeurosis. The deeper flexor muscles are extrinsic hand muscles; strong flexors at the finger joints used to produce the important power grip of the hand, whilst forced extension is less useful and the corresponding extensor thus are much weaker.
Biceps is the major supinator (drive a screw in with the right arm) and pronator teres and pronator quadratus the major pronators (unscrewing) — the latter two role the radius around the ulna (hence the name of the first bone) and the former reverses this action assisted by supinator. Because biceps is much stronger than its opponents, supination is a stronger action than pronation (hence the direction of screws).

:; Radial: Brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi radialis brevis

====Wrist====

The wrist (), composed of the carpal bones, articulates at the wrist joint (or radiocarpal joint) proximally and the carpometacarpal joint distally. The wrist can be divided into two components separated by the midcarpal joints. The small movements of the eight carpal bones during composite movements at the wrist are complex to describe, but flexion mainly occurs in the midcarpal joint whilst extension mainly occurs in the radiocarpal joint; the latter joint also providing most of adduction and abduction at the wrist.
How muscles act on the wrist is complex to describe. The five muscles acting on the wrist directly — flexor carpi radialis, flexor carpi ulnaris, extensor carpi radialis, extensor carpi ulnaris, and palmaris longus — are accompanied by the tendons of the extrinsic hand muscles (i.e. the muscles acting on the fingers). Thus, every movement at the wrist is the work of a group of muscles; because the four primary wrist muscles (FCR, FCU, ECR, and ECU) are attached to the four corners of the wrist, they also produce a secondary movement (i.e. ulnar or radial deviation). To produce pure flexion or extension at the wrist, these muscle therefore must act in pairs to cancel out each other&#x27;s secondary action. On the other hand, finger movements without the corresponding wrist movements require the wrist muscles to cancel out the contribution from the extrinsic hand muscles at the wrist.
====Hand====
The hand (), the metacarpals (in the hand proper) and the phalanges of the fingers, form the metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP, including the knuckles) and interphalangeal joints (IP).

Of the joints between the carpus and metacarpus, the carpometacarpal joints, only the saddle-shaped joint of the thumb offers a high degree of mobility while the opposite is true for the metacarpophalangeal joints. The joints of the fingers are simple hinge joints.
The primary role of the hand itself is grasping and manipulation; tasks for which the hand has been adapted to two main grips — power grip and precision grip. In a power grip an object is held against the palm and in a precision grip an object is held with the fingers, both grips are performed by intrinsic and extrinsic hand muscles together. Most importantly, the relatively strong thenar muscles of the thumb and the thumb&#x27;s flexible first joint allow the special opposition movement that brings the distal thumb pad in direct contact with the distal pads of the other four digits. Opposition is a complex combination of thumb flexion and abduction that also requires the thumb to be rotated 90° about its own axis. Without this complex movement, humans would not be able to perform a precision grip.
In addition, the central group of intrinsic hand muscles give important contributions to human dexterity. The palmar and dorsal interossei adduct and abduct at the MCP joints and are important in pinching. The lumbricals, attached to the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and extensor digitorum communis (FDC), flex the MCP joints while extending the IP joints and allow a smooth transfer of forces between these two muscles while extending and flexing the fingers.

===Neurovascular system===

====Nerve supply====

The motor and sensory supply of the upper limb is provided by the brachial plexus which is formed by the ventral rami of spinal nerves C5-T1. In the posterior triangle of the neck these rami form three trunks from which fibers enter the axilla region (armpit) to innervate the muscles of the anterior and posterior compartments of the limb. In the axilla, cords are formed to split into branches, including the five terminal branches listed below.

The muscles of the upper limb are innervated segmentally proximal to distal so that the proximal muscles are innervated by higher segments (C5–C6) and the distal muscles are innervated by lower segments (C8–T1).
Motor innervation of upper limb by the five terminal nerves of the brachial plexus:
* The musculocutaneous nerve innervates all the muscles of the anterior compartment of the arm.
* The median nerve innervates all the muscles of the anterior compartment of the forearm except flexor carpi ulnaris and the ulnar part of the flexor digitorum profundus. It also innervates the three thenar muscles and the first and second lumbricals.
* The ulnar nerve innervates the muscles of the forearm and hand not innervated by the median nerve.
* The axillary nerve innervates the deltoid and teres minor.
* The radial nerve innervates the posterior muscles of the arm and forearm

Collateral branches of the brachial plexus:
* The dorsal scapular nerve innervates rhomboid major, minor and levator scapulae .
* The long thoracic nerve innervates serratus anterior.
* The suprascapular nerve innervates supraspinatus and infraspinatus
* The lateral pectoral nerve innervates pectoralis major
* The medial pectoral nerve innervates pectoralis major and minor
* The upper subscapular nerve innervates subscapularis
* The thoracodorsal nerve innervates latissimus dorsi
* The lower subscapular nerve innervates subscapularis and teres major
* The medial brachial cutaneous nerve innervates the skin of medial arm
* The medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve innervates the skin of medial forearm

====Blood supply and drainage====
Arteries of the upper limb:
* The superior thoracic, thoracoacromial, posterior circumflex humeral and subscapular branches of the axillary artery.
* The deep brachial, superior ulnar collateral, inferior ulnar collateral, radial, 
ulnar, nutrient and muscular branches of the brachial artery.
* The radial recurrent, muscular, superficial palmar, dorsal carpal, princeps pollicis and radialis indicis branches of the radial artery.
* The anterior ulnar recurrent, posterior ulnar recurrent, anterior interosseous, posterior interosseous and superficial branches of the ulnar artery.
Veins of the upper limb:
* Basilic vein
* Cephalic vein
* Median cubital vein
* Median antebrachial vein
* Dorsal venous arch

As for the upper limb blood supply, there are many anatomical variations.

==Other animals==

===Evolutionary variation===

The skeletons of all mammals are based on a common pentadactyl (&quot;five-fingered&quot;) template but optimised for different functions. While many mammals can perform other tasks using their forelimbs, their primary use in most terrestrial mammals is one of three main modes of locomotion: unguligrade (hoof walkers), digitigrade (toe walkers), and plantigrade (sole walkers). Generally, the forelimbs are optimised for speed and stamina, but in some mammals some of the locomotion optimisation have been sacrificed for other functions, such as digging and grasping.

In primates, the upper limbs provide a wide range of movement which increases manual dexterity. The limbs of chimpanzees, compared to those of humans, reveal their different lifestyle. The chimpanzee primarily uses two modes of locomotion: knuckle-walking, a style of quadrupedalism in which the body weight is supported on the knuckles (or more properly on the middle phalanges of the fingers), and brachiation (swinging from branch to branch), a style of bipedalism in which flexed fingers are used to grasp branches above the head. To meet the requirements of these styles of locomotion, the chimpanzee&#x27;s finger phalanges are longer and have more robust insertion areas for the flexor tendons while the metacarpals have transverse ridges to limit dorsiflexion (stretching the fingers towards the back of the hand). The thumb is small enough to facilitate brachiation while maintaining some of the dexterity offered by an opposable thumb. In contrast, virtually all locomotion functionality has been lost in humans while predominant brachiators, such as the gibbons, have very reduced thumbs and inflexible wrists.

In ungulates the forelimbs are optimised to maximize speed and stamina to the extent that the limbs serve almost no other purpose. In contrast to the skeleton of human limbs, the proximal bones of ungulates are short and the distal bones long to provide length of stride; proximally, large and short muscles provide rapidity of step. The odd-toed ungulates, such as the horse, use a single third toe for weight-bearing and have significantly reduced metacarpals. Even-toed ungulates, such as the giraffe, uses both their third and fourth toes but a single completely fused phalanx bone for weight-bearing. Ungulates whose habitat does not require fast running on hard terrain, for example the hippopotamus, have maintained four digits.

In species in the order Carnivora, some of which are insectivores rather than carnivores, the cats are some of the most highly evolved predators designed for speed, power, and acceleration rather than stamina. Compared to ungulates, their limbs are shorter, more muscular in the distal segments, and maintain five metacarpals and digit bones; providing a greater range of movements, a more varied function and agility (e.g. climbing, swatting, and grooming). Some insectivorous species in this order have paws specialised for specific functions. The sloth bear uses their digits and large claws to tear logs open rather than kill prey. Other insectivorous species, such as the giant and red pandas, have developed large sesamoid bones in their paws that serve as an extra &quot;thumb&quot; while others, such as the meerkat, uses their limbs primary for digging and have vestigial first digits.
The arboreal two-toed sloth, a South American mammal in the order Pilosa, have limbs so highly adapted to hanging in branches that it is unable to walk on the ground where it has to drag its own body using the large curved claws on its foredigits.

<doc id="674204" wikidata="Q593691" url="?curid=674204" title="Albedo 0.39">
<text>Albedo 0.39 is a studio album by the Greek electronic composer Vangelis, released in 1976. It was the second album produced by Vangelis in Nemo Studios, London, which was his creative base until the late 1980s. It contrasts with his previous album, &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, which was classically inspired and choral, while &quot;Albedo 0.39&quot; has blues and jazz overtones. It was his first Top 20 UK album.

==Overview==
It is a concept album themed around space physics. Its title is inspired by the idea of a planet&#x27;s albedo, the proportion of the light it receives that is reflected back into space. The album title refers to the average albedo value of the planet Earth as it was calculated in 1976 (the current value is 0.30). From the explanation on the back of the LP cover : &quot;The reflecting power of a planet or other non-luminous body. A perfect reflector would have an Albedo of 100%. The Earth&#x27;s Albedo is 39%, or 0.39&quot;.

As with &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;, it was performed at the Royal Albert Hall in 1977.

==Release==
The album reached #18 on the UK Album Charts. In 2011 the album was included along with &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; and &quot;Spiral&quot; in a 3-CD box set series &quot;Original Album Classics&quot; by Sony, RCA and Legacy Recordings. In 2013 the album was released in a remastered and reissued digipak edition by Esoteric Recordings.

==Instruments==
Vangelis plays all instruments. As well as synthesizers, other instruments include acoustic drums, bass, percussion, a xylophone, a gamelan (track 2), and recordings of the speaking clock and the Apollo Moon landing. The only vocal is the narrative on the closing title track by Vangelis&#x27; sound engineer, Keith Spencer-Allen.

==Composition==
&quot;Pulstar&quot; builds on a synthesizer pulse sequence, a main line and various other synthesizer brass lines. It ends with a recording of the speaking clock. &quot;Freefall&quot; builds on a gamelan sequence and a synthesizer line. &quot;Mare Tranquillitatis&quot; is a quiet synthesizer piece featuring recordings of several Apollo Moon landings. &quot;Main Sequence&quot; is propelled by a pulsed synthesizer sequence, along which a drums-based jazz track develops. It calms down and flows into the next song, &quot;Sword of Orion&quot;, built on an arpeggio chord, melody, and percussion.

On &quot;Alpha&quot;, Vangelis employs a composing technique he would use extensively on later albums (e.g. &quot;Direct&quot;): a simple theme of a few bars is developed through increasingly complex instrumentation. Instruments include a slow synthesizer arpeggio, synthesizer mallet melody line, xylophone, percussion and (later) acoustic drums. The &quot;Nucleogenesis&quot; suite is a collage that conveys a somewhat darker mood, employing a church organ, an organ synthesizer pulse, various lines of Vangelis&#x27; patent synthesizer brass, acoustic drums and basses. The title track, &quot;Albedo 0.39&quot; builds on waxing and waning synthesizer chords and arpeggios, while a voice, reputedly the album&#x27;s engineer Keith Spencer-Allen, narrates various physical properties ascribed to the Earth according to popular current theories, such as its mass, length of the year in various measurements, and, finally, its albedo.

==Reception==
Mike DeGagne of Allmusic described the tracks as &quot;mesmerizing trips of assorted rhythms that include elements of jazz and mild rock&quot;, that along with &quot;Albedo 0.39&quot;, &quot;the two parts of &quot;Nucleogenesis&quot; are among the strongest cuts that keep his cosmic theme from deviating, while the livelier &quot;Pulstar&quot; involves some impressive instrumental range and electronic buoyancy&quot;. He concluded that &quot;the stretches of notes and rhythms don&#x27;t become weary or monotonous at any point of the album&quot;, and that &quot;intention of conjuring up the vastness and immensity of space is soundly accomplished&quot;. Henri Stirk from Background Magazine rated the 2013 edition by Esoteric Recordings 4/5 stars.

*&quot;Pulstar&quot; was used as the theme music for a children&#x27;s BBC television programme, &quot;Horses Galore&quot;. It was also used as an early theme tune for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, ABS-CBN&#x27;s news programs &quot;TV Patrol&quot; (until November 1994) and &quot;The World Tonight&quot; (until 1996) in the Philippines and TVRI&#x27;s news program &quot;Dunia Dalam Berita&quot; (until 1981, 2002–2005, modified version used since 2018) in Indonesia. Some local newscasts used Pulstar as theme music, including WNEV in Boston, CBLT in Toronto and CBMT Newswatch in Montreal. In Brazil it appeared on a TV ad for the cigarette brand Advance, in a high-tech styled, three-minute long clip by director involving several cigarettes rolling and moving to make geometric shapes. It was an instantaneous success due to its vanguard look for the time.
*Excerpts from &quot;Pulstar&quot; and &quot;Alpha&quot; can be heard on episodes of Carl Sagan&#x27;s documentary series &quot;&quot;, along with several other Vangelis themes. &quot;Alpha&quot; was used over animation illustrating evolutionary theory, with the music&#x27;s climax timed to coincide with the appearance and achievements of humans.
*An excerpt from &quot;Pulstar&quot; was used as the title track in the 2009 BBC drama series &quot;Micro Men&quot;.
*Excerpts from &quot;Pulstar&quot; and &quot;Alpha&quot; were used in the 1980 film &quot;Death of a Princess&quot;. Despite the controversy over the film that outraged the government of Saudi Arabia, both pieces were used for a long time as background music for interludes on Saudi national TV.
* &quot;Alpha&quot; was used in the 1981 XXX movie American Desire.
* In Spain, &quot;Pulstar&quot; was used by Cadena COPE radio station as an ident of their news services.
* In Brazil, excerpts from &quot;Nucleogenesis (Part One)&quot; were used during journalistic reports in the Domingo Legal TV show, from SBT, during the 1990s and 2000s. It was revived in 2014 in Band&#x27;s show, Tá Na Tela, again, serving as the background music for journalistic reports.
* In Israel, &quot;Alpha&quot; was heard on the first Empire of Cinema logo in the early 1980s. In the United States, it can also be heard on a local station id for Los Angeles, California-based public television station KCET when it was a PBS member station in the early 1980s.
* A remixed version of &quot;Alpha&quot; is heard on seasons 1 and 2 in travel documentary television series Madventures.

<text>The torso or trunk is an anatomical term for the central part, or the core, of the body of many animals (including human beings), from which the head, neck, limbs, tail and other appendages extend. The tetrapod torso — including that of a human — is usually divided into the &quot;thoracic&quot; segment (also known as the upper torso, where the forelimbs extend), the &quot;abdominal&quot; segment (also known as the &quot;mid-section&quot; or &quot;midriff&quot;), and the &quot;pelvic&quot; and &quot;perineal&quot; segments (sometimes known together with the abdomen as the lower torso, where the hindlimbs extend).

==Anatomy==
===Major organs===

In humans, most critical organs, with the notable exception of the brain, are housed within the torso. In the upper chest, the heart and lungs are protected by the rib cage, and the abdomen contains most of the organs responsible for digestion: the stomach, which breaks down partially digested food via gastric acid; the liver, which respectively produces bile necessary for digestion; the large and small intestines, which extract nutrients from food; the anus, from which fecal wastes are egested; the rectum, which stores feces; the gallbladder, which stores and concentrates bile; the kidneys, which produce urine, the ureters, which pass it to the bladder for storage; and the urethra, which excretes urine and in a male passes sperm through the seminal vesicles. Finally, the pelvic region houses both the male and female reproductive organs.
===Major muscle groups===
The torso also harbours many of the main groups of muscles in the tetrapod body, including the pectoral, abdominal, lateral and epaxial muscles.
===Nerve supply===
The organs, muscles, and other contents of the torso are supplied by nerves, which mainly originate as nerve roots from the thoracic and lumbar parts of the spinal cord. Some organs also receive a nerve supply from the vagus nerve. The sensation to the skin is provided by the lateral and dorsal cutaneous branches.

<doc id="674219" wikidata="Q1067286" url="?curid=674219" title="Charlotte Motor Speedway">
<text>Charlotte Motor Speedway (known as Lowe&#x27;s Motor Speedway from 1999 to 2009 due to sponsorship reasons) is a quad-oval intermediate speedway in Concord, North Carolina. It has hosted various major races since its inaugural season of racing in 1960, including NASCAR, IndyCar, and IMSA SportsCar Championship races. The facility is owned by Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI), with Greg Walter serving as its general manager. Charlotte Motor Speedway is served by U.S. Route 29. 

The speedway has a capacity of 95,000 as of 2021. The track features numerous amenities, including a Speedway Club, condos, and a seven-story tower located on the complex for office space and souvenirs. In addition, the Charlotte Motor Speedway complex features numerous adjacent tracks, including a clay short track, a dirt track, and a long drag strip. The main track also features an infield road course that is used with the oval to make a &quot;roval&quot;. 

With the rise of popularity in stock car racing in the American Southeast that began in the late 1940s and stretched into the 1950s, racing promoter Bruton Smith sought to build a state-of-the-art facility. At the same time, driver and businessman Curtis Turner sought to do the same. After initially refusing, Turner eventually partnered with Smith after they agreed to sell shares needed for the track&#x27;s construction. Charlotte Motor Speedway was constructed in less than 11 months. The facility immediately faced a litany of issues, particularly financial woes. Within the facility&#x27;s first decade of existence, ownership changed hands numerous times, with Smith and Turner both leaving. After a period of stability under the ownership of Richard Howard from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, Smith and his new partner, racing promoter and eventual longtime track general manager Humpy Wheeler, completed a takeover of Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1976. Since then, the Smith family and their company, SMI, have directed the facility&#x27;s expansion and growth into one of the largest sports facilities in the United States.

== Description ==
=== Configurations ===
Charlotte Motor Speedway (CMS) in its current form is measured at , with 24 degrees of banking in the turns and five degrees of banking on the track&#x27;s frontstretch and backstretch. Within the main track&#x27;s frontstretch, there is a oval that was built in 1991 and is primarily used for legends car racing.

Numerous tracks exist in the track&#x27;s infield. In 1970, track officials announced plans for an infield road course that was connected to the speedway&#x27;s backstretch. According to then-general manager Richard Howard, original plans for the speedway included a road course, but this was cut due to budget issues. The original road course&#x27;s length has varied in reports, from as short as according to the &quot;Salisbury Post&quot; to as long long according to &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;. The road course held its first races on May 22, 1971, as part of the 1971 World 600 race weekend. By August 1974, the track was reconfigured to a length of . In 2018, the road course was modified to suit NASCAR racing, adding a backstretch chicane. this was modified the following year In 2019, one of the speedway&#x27;s chicanes, located on the backstretch, was modified. In 2020, developers constructed a purpose-built go-kart track in the track&#x27;s infield. Further modifications to two of the road course&#x27;s chicanes were announced in 2024.

=== Amenities ===
CMS is located in Concord, North Carolina, directly next to U.S. Route 29. At the time of CMS&#x27;s initial construction, the complex covered and had a capacity of around 30,000. Over the span of several decades, CMS and its complex have been expanded and improved numerous times. Throughout the ownership of Bruton Smith, the facility oversaw capacity growth, seeing a peak of over 170,000 by the end of the 1980s. However, since the 2000s, capacity has seen a decrease, with multiple grandstands being demolished in the 2010s; , the track is reported to have a capacity of 95,000. The complex has also expanded to around . 

Numerous buildings, used for a variety of purposes, are located in the complex. In 1983, to celebrate the facility&#x27;s 25th anniversary, officials announced the construction of 36 condominiums that were built to overlook CMS&#x27;s first turn. By the time the project was completed in mid-1984, the number of condos increased to 40, and all were sold by the end of 1983. At the end of 1984, officials announced the construction of a mall underneath the condos. Three years later, officials announced the construction of a members-only private club and restaurant named The Speedway Club, with annual membership starting at $6,500 (adjusted for inflation, $).

==== Adjacent tracks ====
The Charlotte Motor Speedway complex has two adjacent tracks and a drag strip near the main speedway. By July 1993, construction started on a clay short track that was made to conduct dirt legends car races. On August 10, 1999, then-general manager Humpy Wheeler announced a new dirt track that was to be constructed across the main speedway. By January 2000, the planned track had been extended to . The first races on this track, which featured a lighting system and a capacity of 15,000, were held on May 28, 2000.

In August 2007, owner of Speedway Motorsports, Bruton Smith, announced plans to build a drag strip on the complex. Although the plan initially faced heavy opposition from local politicians, the drag strip was eventually built after Smith threatened to close down the speedway, coercing the city to give him an incentive package of approximately $80 million by leveraging fears that a closure would cripple the Concord economy. The drag strip, which cost $60 million to build, held its first races in September 2008.

== History ==

=== Planning and construction ===
Stock car racing, which traces its roots to moonshiners during the Prohibition era, gained significant popularity across the American Southeast during the 1940s and 1950s. This surge in interest led to the construction of modern racetracks like Darlington Raceway. In the late 1950s, promoter Bruton Smith, who had achieved success organizing races in the Carolinas, aspired to build his own racetrack. In 1956, he partnered with businessman John William Propst Jr. to pursue the project. At the same time, driver and timber businessman Curtis Turner was also working with a group of investors to build a racetrack. However, Propst suffered a heart attack in 1958 and withdrew from his partnership with Smith due to health concerns. Smith then sought a partnership with Turner. After initial discussions, Turner declined the offer during a meeting at the Barringer Hotel. Feeling betrayed and aware that Turner lacked the funds to start his track independently, Smith decided to bluff Turner&#x27;s plans. On April 22, 1959, Smith announced his intention to build his own speedway—the same day Turner officially announced his track plans. Turner&#x27;s track was set to be built near U.S. Route 29 in Cabarrus County, North Carolina, with a proposed capacity of 30,000 spectators. However, he struggled to sell the 300,000 shares needed to finance the project. Ultimately, Turner agreed to partner with Smith, who became the vice president of the project and successfully sold 100,000 shares. Additional stocks were made available in December 1959 and April 1960 to continue funding the speedway&#x27;s construction. 

Groundbreaking on the facility began on July 28, 1959, two months later than planned due to legal issues surrounding the land purchase. Construction faced immediate challenges. Crews discovered large granite veins beneath the soil shortly after breaking ground, forcing grading contractor W. Owen Flowe to use dynamite for removal, causing further delays. Aggressive hornets on-site led to multiple workers quitting, and in March 1960, three snowstorms compounded the setbacks. Despite the delays, the track&#x27;s publicity director insisted construction was &quot;still ahead of schedule.&quot; By late March, developers considered scrapping plans for grandstands to save time. The complications forced the track’s first major race, the NASCAR-sanctioned 1960 World 600, to be postponed from May 29 to June 19. Longtime NASCAR mechanic Smokey Yunick criticized the location, remarking, &quot;a giant mistake. If they&#x27;d have searched North Carolina for the worst possible place to build a racetrack, that&#x27;s where they built it.&quot; Smith blamed Turner for many of the delays, claiming Turner often hired workers while intoxicated, requiring Smith to dismiss them. Despite these obstacles, the project secured additional funding, including a $300,000 (about $ today) loan from Washington D.C. businessman James L. McIlvaine, who expressed confidence in its success, stating in &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot;, &quot;This is going to be one of the best investments I&#x27;ve ever made, and I&#x27;ve made some good ones.&quot;

As construction of the facility neared completion, a contract dispute arose between Flowe and his workers over unpaid fees and bounced checks. On June 9, just days before the World 600, Flowe halted construction by parking several earthmovers on the track and threatened to sue CMS officials. Accounts differ regarding what followed: Flowe claimed that multiple individuals, including Smith and Turner, threatened to shoot him and his workers if they did not resume work. Smith, however, stated that only Turner showed up with a shotgun, &quot;[act] like he was somebody&quot; before a guard confiscated the weapon. Construction eventually resumed and was barely completed in time for the start of activities for the 1960 World 600. Smith later called it a &quot;miracle&quot; that CMS was finished, admitting to losing $150,000 during its construction. According to McIlvaine, the project cost approximately two million dollars (about $ today) with $74,000 (about $ today) in debts owed to Flowe at the time of its completion.

=== Early track and financial troubles ===
CMS officially opened to cars for a practice session on June 15, 1960, but issues quickly emerged. &quot;The State&quot; reported incomplete facilities on the first day, while the track&#x27;s asphalt surface developed holes due to cars reaching speeds of around . &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; writer George Cunningham described the scene, noting &quot;four gravel-deep fox holes grew...out of the second turn. And practically the entire surface on the third and fourth turns resembled an old lady&#x27;s wrinkled face.&quot; Despite this, some, including driver Glenn &quot;Fireball&quot; Roberts, hoped the surface would improve at higher speeds. Track officials ordered a hasty repaving, which mostly held up by the following day. However, financial troubles followed on June 18, when officials were sued for $10,000 (about $ today) by Roy E. Thomas, who claimed breach of contract after being fired from his role selling advertising space for souvenir programs. On race day, promoter Bruton Smith prayed the race would surpass halfway, fearing he&#x27;d have to issue refunds otherwise. During the race, surface problems returned. Drivers such as Tom Pistone, Doug Yates, and Ned Jarrett reported mechanical failures, including blown tires, broken axles, and suspensions due to the track&#x27;s rough conditions. Emanuel Zervakis exclaimed, &quot;It&#x27;s rough as hell! All the cars will have to be rebuilt...there&#x27;s no doubt about it.&quot; Asphalt broke apart in multiple areas, forcing drivers to dodge flying debris. Max Muhlehurn of &quot;The Charlotte News&quot; summed it up: &quot;The 600 will go down in history as the only race ever run in which drivers were forced to dodge track blemishes more often than other cars.&quot;.

On July 17, McIlvaine spread rumors that the facility&#x27;s board of directors intended to appoint new management, possibly under NASCAR president Bill France Sr. or Darlington Raceway president Bob Colvin. Both Smith and Turner quickly denied the rumors, with Turner threatening legal action. Over the next few months, multiple claims surfaced alleging that Smith and Turner owed significant sums to various organizations and companies, including $90,000 (about $ today) to the Connecticut General Life Insurance Co., $40,200 (about $ today) to the Internal Revenue Service, $65,000 (about $ today) to Propst and his construction company, and $204,000 (about $ today) to McDevitt Street and Co. The facility had also defaulted on its initial mortgage. By early August, only Propst had been paid, though additional track repaving was scheduled to address ongoing surface issues. By November 22, reports indicated that CMS had accumulated approximately $1 million (about $ today) in debt. In January 1961, two more lawsuits were filed by excavating companies.

On March 1, 1961, Flowe filed a civil lawsuit against the track, alleging breach of contract and seeking $138,155.28 (about $ today) in reparations for construction costs. Three months later, following McIlvaine&#x27;s threat of foreclosure and the auction of CMS, Turner and Smith resigned from the board of directors, though Smith remained as the promotional director. Duke Ellington, a board member, replaced Turner as the track&#x27;s general manager. Turner later accused Smith and Ellington of conspiring to oust him and inflating the track&#x27;s profits. In July, Turner and his investor group announced plans to regain control of CMS by either purchasing the track in a public sale or acquiring a controlling amount of stock. By August, despite an &quot;unusually successful&quot; 1961 World 600, the track warned stockholders that CMS was in &quot;serious trouble&quot; and could only achieve financial stability through immediate long-term financing. By early October, the facility still faced $500,000 in debt, and foreclosure proceedings began, with plans to auction the track on October 30. In a last-ditch effort to stop the foreclosure, several solutions were proposed, including securing a &quot;miracle&quot; loan and a plan for Smith to partner with investors to raise $600,000 to save the facility. After the auction was delayed, U.S. District Judge James Braxton Craven Jr. ruled on November 3 that the court would take over management of CMS. The track entered Chapter 10 bankruptcy, with all officers and directors removed from their positions. The facility was placed under court protection, shielding it from creditors and effectively becoming a ward of the court.

==== Federal court control ====

After Craven&#x27;s ruling, he appointed Robert Nelson Robinson, a local Charlotte lawyer, to manage the track. Several loan offers were made to help resolve the facility&#x27;s financial troubles, including separate proposals from businessmen Roger D. Edwards and Dwight Cross. On December 9, Craven ruled that the track&#x27;s management could seek loans without immediate pressure from creditors, and he ordered Robinson to develop a plan to ensure a $900,000 (about $ today) payment to various creditors. By early January 1962, no progress had been made, prompting Craven to threaten liquidation of the track by March if a viable plan was not presented. By the end of January, a shareholder committee led by A. C. Goines proposed a solution: asking the track&#x27;s nearly 2,300 shareholders to purchase trustee certificates valued between $100 and $1,000, with the goal of raising $300,000—half of the $600,000 needed for reorganization. Following a successful stockholder meeting on February 18, a final effort to raise an additional $50,000 took place six days later. The committee succeeded in meeting the $300,000 goal, but a loan offer from Cross to cover the remaining debts was rejected. By May, Craven ordered an investigation into Charlotte Motor Speedway (CMS). By July, while Craven remained optimistic about saving the facility, preliminary findings of mismanagement and potential fraud led to the involvement of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Eventually, a reorganization plan hearing was scheduled for November 5.

In October, a new $345,000 loan from McIlvaine was guaranteed, despite track officials already owing him over $300,000, alleviating some financial pressure. The following month, Craven approved Robinson&#x27;s proposal to allow stockholders and creditors to vote on a reorganization plan, scheduled to run through January 3, 1963. While the plan initially lacked sufficient creditor support, it was eventually approved, and Craven granted final approval for a stock sale in February. By April, the plan had achieved significant success, with the owners repaying over $740,000 in debt. In mid-April, Craven approved the establishment of private ownership under an 11-person board of directors led by A.C. Goines, with the arrangement set to last for at least one year, effectively completing the reorganization process. That same year, Bruton Smith left his position after being found guilty of failing to file tax returns for 1955 and 1956.

=== Richard Howard era, stabilization ===
In December 1963, Goines announced a 10% stock dividend, stating, &quot;We&#x27;ve taken some bitter medicine, but the patient has been saved.&quot; By February 1964, CMS reported its first profit. Goines stepped down after the mandatory one-year period, and Richard Howard, a leading stockholder and furniture store owner, took over. The track faced several tragedies in the mid-1960s. Veteran driver Fireball Roberts died on July 2, 1964, from complications following a fiery crash at the 1964 World 600. Another fatality occurred on October 17, 1965, when Harold Kite, a World War II veteran, was killed in a crash during the first lap of the 1965 National 400.

Under Howard&#x27;s leadership, CMS paid off its mortgage three years ahead of schedule, finally resolving the track&#x27;s financial challenges. Known as a &quot;good ol&#x27; country boy,&quot; Howard was conservative with spending but invested strategically in renovations and capacity expansions. In 1965, track officials diversified their holdings by acquiring the Rightway Investment Corporation, an insurance finance company. In 1970, management announced plans to construct a new road course and additional grandstands, as indicated by tax records. By 1972, CMS was achieving consistent year-over-year profit growth.

=== Bruton Smith and Humpy Wheeler&#x27;s takeover ===

In the mid-1970s, after a successful career in the car dealership business, Smith saw the potential profitability of reacquiring CMS, particularly with the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and its subsidiary Winston sponsoring the NASCAR Cup Series starting in 1970. By 1973, Smith had purchased nearly 500,000 shares—a significant increase from his initial 40,000 shares—remarking that he wasn&#x27;t sure why he acquired so many. In early 1974, despite efforts to block board elections, Smith was elected chairman of the track&#x27;s board of directors, effectively returning him to a leadership role. Howard was appointed as the facility&#x27;s president, and later that year, he announced a $2.5 million (about $ today) renovation project to enhance the track&#x27;s appearance and expand seating capacity.
Throughout 1975, Howard and Smith engaged in a heated battle for control of the organization, exchanging sharp criticisms in the media. In January, Howard regained control of the board of directors despite initially threatening to resign. By February, Howard criticized Smith for managing the track from Illinois, prompting Smith to accuse him of consolidating power and financial misconduct. A major turning point came in July when Smith purchased approximately 80,000 shares from Howard&#x27;s relatives. On August 29, Smith hired H. A. &quot;Humpy&quot; Wheeler, a former public relations executive, as the track&#x27;s development director. Local media speculated that Wheeler’s hiring signaled Smith’s impending takeover. On October 5, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported that the upcoming National 500 would likely be Howard&#x27;s last race associated with the facility, with a final decision expected at the annual stockholders&#x27; meeting on January 30, 1976. Although Howard initially denied these claims and expressed interest in working as a consultant for Smith, he later admitted on October 23 that he was &quot;99% certain&quot; of leaving. At the stockholders&#x27; meeting, a tearful Howard officially announced his resignation, giving Smith full control of the facility. Wheeler subsequently assumed the role of president.

==== Humpy Wheeler era, promotions, failed NFL proposal ====
Under the leadership of Wheeler and Smith, CMS underwent significant promotion, expansion, and modernization. In Wheeler&#x27;s first year as president, he announced a $3–5 million renovation project slated for completion in 1981. Wheeler became known for his creative and elaborate promotional efforts. In 1976, he attracted female spectators by convincing Janet Guthrie to enter the World 600. The following year, he fueled the rivalry between veteran driver Cale Yarborough and newcomer Darrell Waltrip by creating a spectacle involving Waltrip&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Jaws,&quot; and Yarborough&#x27;s sponsor, Holly Farms Poultry. Wheeler placed a dead chicken inside the mouth of a dead shark, mounted it on a pickup truck&#x27;s sling, and paraded it before the first qualifying round of the 1977 NAPA National 500. By 1980, officials announced additional renovations worth $16 million, aiming to increase the speedway&#x27;s capacity to 150,000. In 1983, Bruton and Wheeler unveiled plans for the construction of 36 condominiums, later expanded to 40. Despite initial skepticism, all units sold out by their completion in 1984.

In 1985, the city of Charlotte made efforts to attract a professional football team. In March, Bruton Smith announced plans to construct a 76,000-seat stadium on the frontstretch of CMS. The proposed stadium would feature temporary endzone grandstands and retractable seating behind the track&#x27;s pit road. While the original track plans had included a football stadium, those plans were abandoned due to construction challenges. During the official announcement on March 13, Smith declared he would move forward with the stadium project if the local government or private investors contributed $10 million. Meanwhile, George Shinn, another Charlotte businessman, also pursued a professional football team, expressing interest in acquiring either a National Football League (NFL) franchise or a United States Football League (USFL) team. Smith, however, was focused solely on securing an NFL team. The city ultimately declined to provide financial support for the stadium, and the plans were abandoned by the end of the year. Despite this, Smith expressed renewed interest in hosting an NFL team at the track two years later.

==== Mass expansion and improvement, injury-riddled period ====

In 1987, construction began on a membership-exclusive club and restaurant named The Speedway Club. By the end of the 1980s, CMS had a maximum capacity of 170,922. In 1991, Smith directed the installation of lights at the track with the help of Iowa-based Musco Lighting. At the time, it was viewed as a major feat, as no oval track as large as the Charlotte Motor Speedway had ever implemented such a system. The lights were completed in April 1992. In 1994, the track renovated its garage area at a cost of around $1 million, drawing praise from driver Dale Jarrett. In 1999, the track partnered with hardware retail chain Lowe&#x27;s, which bought naming rights, the first time a corporate sponsor ever had such rights for a track.

Throughout the 1990s and the early 2000s, numerous injuries and fatalities occurred at the track, involving both drivers and spectators. In 1989, Wheeler created the NASCAR Sportsman Division, a series that had the intended goal of giving short-track drivers experience on longer tracks. The track played host to numerous races. The series immediately gained a reputation for danger due to a series of crashes at CMS. Three fatal crashes occurred within six years; David Gaines in 1990, Gary Batson in 1992, and Russell Phillips in 1995, with the third being decapitated when his head hit a caution light. In late 1995, Wheeler gave control of the series to NASCAR, who ended it quickly afterward in 1996. During the 1999 VisionAire 500K – an Indy Racing League race – an early accident involving Stan Wattles and John Paul Jr. occurred on the speedway&#x27;s front stretch, resulting in heavy debris. Wattles&#x27; right rear wheel and tire assembly flew into the grandstands at high speeds, killing three people and injuring eight more, resulting in the cancellation of the race. After the 2000 The Winston, a pedestrian bridge collapsed, injuring 107 people, which was later blamed on the bridge&#x27;s manufacturer using an improper additive. In the next two years, two ARCA drivers died in accidents; Blaise Alexander in 2001, and Eric Martin in 2002.

In 2005, officials announced a repave, using a process called to smooth out bumps on the track&#x27;s surface. This repave led to numerous problems for both of the facility&#x27;s NASCAR race weekends in 2005, leading to another repave in 2006. In 2007, Smith announced plans to construct a drag strip. This plan was met with heavy criticism from the Concord City Council, which held a special legislative session to decide whether to block it. Smith, in turn, decided to start preliminary grading work regardless of the council&#x27;s decision. On October 2, the council voted unanimously to block Smith&#x27;s plans. In response, Smith threatened to shut down the track or relegate it to a testing facility unless the decision was reversed, which would have significant financial repercussions for the Concord economy. The council quickly backtracked, and tried to convince Smith to stay by offering him an incentive package of $80 million (adjusted for inflation, $), a street named in his honor, and a tax break, along with letting him build the drag strip. On November 26, Smith stated his final decision in letting the track continue as is, stating, &quot;We&#x27;re here forever&quot;.

=== Retirement of Wheeler ===
Tensions between Smith and Wheeler had been documented since 1991, with the two being in &quot;constant disagreement&quot; over topics. By 2008, Wheeler grew angry at several new developments directed by Smith, including the controversial drag strip. On May 21, 2008, Wheeler announced his retirement, effective after the 2008 Coca-Cola 600, ending a tenure that had lasted since 1975. Although Smith claimed that he offered Wheeler a consulting job and that Wheeler himself hoped for a part-time position, Wheeler ultimately left all track duties related to CMS. Wheeler was replaced by Marcus Smith, one of Smith&#x27;s sons. In 2009, corporate sponsor Lowe&#x27;s ended its eleven-year partnership with the track, which reverted back to the &quot;Charlotte Motor Speedway&quot; name.

==== Steady attendance declines, renovations ====

Throughout the 2010s, CMS oversaw steady attendance declines that correlated with overall reduced attendance within NASCAR. As a result, officials ordered the removal of 41,000 seats in 2014 and an unspecified amount of seats in 2017. In 2017, the track was used for the filming of the movie &quot;Logan Lucky&quot;, a fictional tale about a group of people stealing $14 million from the facility. In 2018, Marcus stepped down from general manager responsibilities to focus on running SMI as its CEO, handing the position over to the speedway&#x27;s executive vice president at the time, Greg Walter. In interviews, Walter expressed a desire for expanding the CMS&#x27;s uses for endeavors other than racing, along with further renovations. In 2021, the NASCAR All-Star Race, which had been held at the track annually, with two exceptions in 1986 and 2020, was moved to the Texas Motor Speedway in an attempt to reverse sagging attendance at Texas.

CMS has seen numerous renovations and additions since the 2010s. In 2011, Marcus directed the construction of a television screen on the track&#x27;s backstretch, demolishing old seats in the process. In 2015, the track&#x27;s barriers were renovated in response to Kyle Busch&#x27;s injury at the Daytona International Speedway in February. In 2023, officials announced plans to build a dedicated road course.

==== NASCAR ====

As of 2025, Charlotte Motor Speedway hosts two annual NASCAR weekends: the Coca-Cola 600 (originally known as the World 600) and the Bank of America Roval 400. The Coca-Cola 600, introduced in 1960, quickly became one of the longest, most prestigious, and highest-paying motor races in the world. It is now considered a &quot;Crown Jewel&quot; event on the NASCAR schedule.

The Bank of America 500 was originally a race held in October, first run in 1960. In 1966, the race distance was increased to , a format that remained until 2018. To address declining attendance, the 2018 race was shortened to and shifted to a specialized &quot;Roval&quot; course. In 2020, a one-off third points paying race was held on the oval configuration, alongside the Coca-Cola 600 and the annual &quot;roval&quot; event. In addition to its NASCAR Cup Series races, CMS also hosts lower-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series and NASCAR Truck Series events on both the oval and roval layouts as support races for the Cup Series.

In 1985, Wheeler and the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company introduced The Winston (now known as the NASCAR All-Star Race), a showcase event featuring race winners from the previous season. From 1987 to 2020, Charlotte Motor Speedway hosted the event annually, with periodic changes to its format and eligibility rules. In 2020, the race was relocated to Bristol Motor Speedway.

==== Other racing events ====

In late 1979, the United States Auto Club (USAC) announced plans to run a race in October 1980. However, the race was canceled in April due to an agreement with USAC and Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART). In December 1996, IndyCar announced plans for a race to be held in July 1997. The race ran for three years; the last race was canceled after an accident caused flying debris that killed three spectators.

Numerous runnings of the Grand Prix of Charlotte, a sports car event, have been run by various organizations. In 2000, the facility held a one-off Grand Prix of Charlotte that was sanctioned by the American Le Mans Series. The race was last run in 2020 by the IMSA SportsCar Championship.

=== Non-racing events ===

==== Festivals and shows ====
On August 10, 1974, CMS hosted the August Jam. Regarded as &quot;Carolina&#x27;s Woodstock&quot;, the festival drew over 200,000 people, more than double than what was expected due to a security breach. The festival unintentionally became the largest music festival in North Carolina history. It soon gained a reputation for violence; Richard Howard, president of CMS, compared the actions of spectators to Japanese Army suicide attacks at the Battle of Okinawa, with damages totaling $50,000.

From 2013 to 2018, the facility held the Carolina Rebellion festival. Since 2021, CMS has hosted a branch of the touring Breakaway Festival. In 2024, the organizers of the Breakaway Festival also planned a second show at the facility, tailored for EDM. That same year, CMS officials also announced that the speedway would host the inaugural edition of the Lovin&#x27; Life Music Fest.

CMS hosts an annual Christmas-themed drive-thru lights show, a tradition that started in 2010. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the track hosted high school graduations for 10 high schools within the Cabarrus County area.

==== Unrealized events ====
In February 1961, track officials wished to host a National Football League (NFL) exhibition game between the Washington Redskins and the Philadelphia Eagles; however, the deal fell through when Smith found terms from Redskins owner George Preston Marshall to be unreasonable.

<doc id="674227" wikidata="Q971172" url="?curid=674227" title="Murchison, New Zealand">
<text>Murchison is a town in the Tasman Region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is near the western end of the &quot;Four Rivers Plain&quot;, at the confluence of the Buller River and the Mātakitaki River. The other two rivers are the Mangles River, and the Matiri River.
It is a rural service town for the surrounding mixed farming district, approximately halfway between Westport and Nelson. Murchison was named after the Scottish geologist Roderick Murchison, one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society.

==History==
During the period 1853 to 1876, the area that became Murchison was administered as part of Nelson Province. The future settlement of Murchison did not come into being until gold was discovered in the area, and the town was surveyed in 1865, under the name Hampden.
With the Abolition of Provinces Act 1876, the new Murchison County was created, taking over administration of its area in January 1877, with Hampden as the county&#x27;s headquarters. The town changed its name to Murchison in 1882, taking its name from the county, to avoid confusion with another South Island town with the same name.
The world&#x27;s earliest non-military suicide attack is believed to have occurred in Murchison on 14 July 1905. A long-standing dispute between two farmers resulted in a court case, and the defendant (Joseph Sewell) had sticks of gelignite strapped to his body. When Sewell excitedly shouted during the court sitting, &quot;I&#x27;ll blow the devil to hell, and I have enough dynamite to do just that&quot;, he was ushered out of the building. Sewell detonated the charge when a police officer tried to arrest him on the street, and his body was blown to pieces; no one else died from the explosion.

Murchison was the epicentre of the 1929 Murchison earthquake, which resulted in the deaths of 17 people, making it the third deadliest earthquake in New Zealand&#x27;s recorded history.

Murchison County existed until the 1989 local government reforms, when the Tasman District was formed through the amalgamation of the Murchison County, Golden Bay County, Waimea County and Richmond Borough administrative areas. Since that time, the urban area of Murchison is administered by the Tasman District council, from the district seat of Richmond.

After the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, which closed State Highway 1 and Main North Line through Kaikōura for 13 months, all traffic north of Christchurch to Nelson, Blenheim, Picton and onwards to the North Island was diverted via Murchison. The resulting detour resulted in traffic volumes through the town more than doubling, with accommodation in the town at capacity and food outlets struggling to cope with the influx. Murchison has one petrol station (Mobil) and one electric vehicle charging station.

He founded AutoNation and Waste Management Inc., and was the owner or co-owner of Blockbuster Video, the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL), the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL), and the Miami Marlins (formerly Florida Marlins) of Major League Baseball (MLB).

==Early life and education==
Harry Wayne Huizenga was of Dutch descent. His grandfather, Harm Huizenga, came to the United States from the Netherlands. Starting with a horse and wagon, Harm Huizenga built a trash hauling service, Huizenga &amp; Sons Scavenger Co. in suburban Chicago in 1894. Wayne Huizenga&#x27;s parents, Gerrit Harry Huizenga (1916–2001), a cabinet maker, and Jean Huizenga (née Riddering; 1918–2006), a home decorator; grew up in the Dutch community in Chicago and were strict Dutch Reformed Christians.

Huizenga was born at Little Company of Mary Hospital, in Evergreen Park, Illinois, on December 29, 1937, the first child in a family of garbage haulers. In 1940 when Wayne was 2, the Huizenga family were listed as living in an apartment building in Berwyn, Illinois. He had one sister, Bonnie, who was five years younger. He attended Chicago Christian High School in his sophomore year. In 1953, the Huizenga family moved to Florida and settled in the Fort Lauderdale area. His father became a building contractor in a booming real estate market.

The remainder of Huizenga&#x27;s high school years were spent at Pine Crest School, where he was a member of the football team and senior class treasurer. After high school graduation in 1956, he moved back to Chicago where most of his friends, grandparents and other relatives lived, and enrolled for three semesters at Calvin College, a liberal arts college in Grand Rapids, Michigan, but he dropped out before finishing his sophomore year. For approximately five years after graduation, he took on low-wage jobs and in September 1959 enlisted in the United States Army Reserve and spent six months on active duty.

==Career==
In Fort Lauderdale, Huizenga started a garbage hauling business, as his grandfather had done in Chicago in 1894. In 1962, he started the Southern Sanitation Service by borrowing US$5,000 from his father and convincing a rival trash hauler to sell him used trucks. Beginning with one garbage truck in 1968, and pursuing customers in an aggressive manner, he created Waste Management, Inc., an entity that eventually became a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company. Huizenga purchased many independent garbage hauling companies; when he took the company public in 1972, he had acquired 133 small-time haulers. In the early 1980s, he had grown Waste Management into one of the largest waste-disposal companies in the United States. In 1984, he left the company and soon again bought companies including suppliers of portable toilets and water bottles for home coolers.

Huizenga repeated the process with Blockbuster Video, acquiring a handful of stores in 1987, with the company becoming the leading movie-rental chain in the U.S. by 1994. After a process of building and acquiring auto dealerships, in 1996, he formed AutoNation, which became the nation&#x27;s largest automotive dealer.

In 2004, he sold Boca Resorts, a group of hotels, including The Hyatt Pier 66 Hotel and the Radisson Bahia Mar Hotel &amp; Marina in Fort Lauderdale, The Boca Raton Resort &amp; Club in Boca Raton, Florida, and several others in Naples, Florida, and Arizona, to private equity firm Blackstone as part of a $1.25 billion deal.

In 2010, Huizenga along with Steve Berrard, former CEO of Blockbuster Video and AutoNation, took a majority stake in Swisher Hygiene, after paying $8.1 million to founder Patrick Swisher and his wife, Laura. Swisher Hygiene went on to be traded on the NASDAQ and the Toronto Stock Exchange via a 2010 reverse takeover deal in which the company acquired the publicly traded CoolBrands International, a Canada-based frozen food and dessert manufacturer. CoolBrands had divested its core businesses in 2007, leaving little more than a corporate shell.

==Sports team ownership==
Huizenga was notable for introducing baseball and ice hockey to the South Florida area as the creator and initial owner of the Florida Marlins and Florida Panthers. Also, he bought the cable television channel SportsChannel Florida (now Bally Sports Florida) in 1996 to air his teams&#x27; games in the region.

He was criticized for naming the two teams for the state of Florida rather than the city of Miami. As an advocate for the city of Fort Lauderdale, he explained that his goal was to include Broward County and Palm Beach County in his teams&#x27; fan base.

In 1994, Huizenga&#x27;s brother-in-law attempted to purchase the NBA&#x27;s Miami Heat, but was unsuccessful.

===American football===
In 1990, during a period of financial hardship for the franchise, Huizenga purchased 15% of the National Football League&#x27;s Miami Dolphins and its stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida. Founding owner Joe Robbie had recently died, and his surviving family found it difficult to keep the team afloat. In turn, Huizenga bought the remaining shares of the team for $115 million to obtain full ownership in 1994. He changed the name of Joe Robbie Stadium, selling the naming rights to Fruit of the Loom brand Pro Player for $2 million per year for 10 years. It has since been renamed many times – as Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, Land Shark Stadium, Sun Life Stadium, as well as a few other corporate names, such as Fruit of the Loom, and is currently named Hard Rock Stadium.

In 2008, Huizenga sold 50% of the team and 50% of the stadium to Stephen M. Ross, chairman of The Related Companies. Huizenga remained the managing general partner of the franchise until January 2009, when he sold another 45% of the team and as much of the stadium to Ross. Thus, Ross became managing general partner with 95% ownership of the Dolphins and the stadium, and Huizenga retained a 5% share of both club and stadium. Huizenga remained the proprietor of 50% of the land.

In the early 1990s, Huizenga served a two-year probationary period with the National Football League as an owner, with the stipulation that he not buy another team.

===Baseball===
In the 1996 off-season period, and only four years after the Marlins&#x27; first expansion appearance in the Major League, Huizenga and General Manager Dave Dombrowski spent more than $89 million on free agents, the amount surprising the rest of the league. The Marlins strengthened its pitching staff by luring Alex Fernandez to Miami and brought over third baseman Bobby Bonilla, outfielder Moisés Alou, reliever Dennis Cook and outfielders John Cangelosi and Jim Eisenreich. In the 1997 season, the team made the playoffs for the first time then went on to win the World Series, defeating the Cleveland Indians in seven games.

In the next off season, Huizenga, claiming a financial loss of about $34 million running the team that year, a claim subsequently disputed by Smith College economist Andrew Zimbalist in an essay, ordered the $54 million players-payroll to be cut, which led to the exodus of most of the championship players. In November 1998, the year after it won the World Series, the Marlins were sold for a reported amount of approximately $150 million to commodities trader John Henry, who later sold the franchise to finance his 2002 acquisition of the Boston Red Sox. In 2017, the Marlins was sold by entrepreneur owner Jeffrey Loria to a group of investors for a reported sum of $1.2 billion.

While his sale of the Marlins was characterized as &quot;one of the worst moves in the franchise&#x27;s history&quot; and Huizenga subsequently expressed regret over his final years with the club and wished he had instead chosen to &quot;go one more year&quot;, the analysts of the Baseball Prospectus, through statistical work, claimed by both winning the sport&#x27;s ultimate trophy and selling the club immediately after that win for a substantial profit, Wayne Huizenga proved to be a &quot;genius.&quot;

When he sold the Marlins, Huizenga, who still owned then-Pro Player Stadium, retained the rights to skybox tickets and club seat customers, as well as 62.5% of parking revenue, and 30% of concessions. Economist Andrew Zimbalist commented &quot;Huizenga made a killing when he sold the team for $150 million [in 1998] and had the lease for this stadium that enabled him to keep just about all the stadium revenue.&quot;

===Ice hockey===
Huizenga operated the Florida Panthers as a public holding company, buying numerous real estate properties in the name of his Panthers Holding Group. Capitalizing on the team&#x27;s 1996 drive to the Stanley Cup finals, he sold shares to the public, whose enthusiasm for the club drove civic leaders in Broward County to use public money to build a new arena for the team. Huizenga used the hockey team&#x27;s stock as currency to begin building yet another diversified enterprise, buying two resort hotels owned partly by Huizenga and other Panthers officials. His original investment in the Panthers had nearly tripled in total value to $150 million.

In 2001, he sold the Panthers to pharmaceutical businessman and friend Alan Cohen and Cohen&#x27;s partner, former NFL quarterback Bernie Kosar, for approximately $100 million. In December 2017, 25 years after he created the club, the Panthers retired the no. 37 shirt in honor of Huizenga. His family chose the number because it was his &quot;birth year and lucky number.&quot;

==Honors==
In 1991, Huizenga received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 1992, he was named a &quot;Distinguished American&quot; by the Horatio Alger Association in 1992. He was named its 2008 Norman Vincent Peale Award recipient. He was named the 2005 Ernst &amp; Young World Entrepreneur Of The Year. In 2012, the City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, renamed Southeast 9th Street in the Rio Vista neighborhood Wayne Huizenga Blvd.

==Personal life and death==
On September 10, 1960, he married Joyce Vander Wagen whom he met while in high school. He had known Joyce since his early school years in Evergreen Park. Wayne and Joyce had two children, Wayne Jr. and Scott. The marriage ended in divorce in 1966. Huizenga married his second wife, Martha Jean &quot;Marti&quot; (née Pike) Goldsby, a native of San Antonio, Florida, in April 1972. She was a secretary, and had done billing and clerical work in one of his businesses. He later adopted her son, Robert Ray, and daughter Pamela. The couple remained married until her death on January 3, 2017, following a fourteen-year battle with cancer.

In 2004, Huizenga purchased a private luxury yacht from Australian professional golfer Greg Norman. The yacht cost $77 million and was further modified by Huizenga to feature a helipad for a 12-seat helicopter. In August 2004, &quot;Power &amp; Motoryacht&quot; ranked it the 43rd-longest yacht in the world.

Huizenga co-funded the H. Wayne Huizenga School of Business and Entrepreneurship at the Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He donated to Pine Crest School, a private preparatory school, which named its science building the Huizenga Science Building. He was a board member of the Laureus Foundation, a charity which, according to its mission statement, &quot;us[es] the power of sport to end violence, discrimination and disadvantage.&quot; In 2009, his Huizenga Family Foundation donated the chapel at the South Florida Council&#x27;s Scout camp in Davie, Florida.

In the 1980s, he began acquiring some 2,000 acres about 30 miles north of West Palm Beach. In 1996, he based the Floridian Golf &amp; Yacht Club there, an exclusive golf club &quot;with enough estate homes on the property to cover his costs,&quot; whose course was designed by Gary Player, where he extended free privileges to some two hundred &quot;friends, relatives, and business associates,&quot; including actors Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones and retired GE Chairman Jack Welch. He renamed his yacht &quot;Floridian&quot;, before selling the Floridian club and estate to Texas entrepreneur Jim Crane in 2010.

Huizenga died of cancer at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on the night of March 22, 2018. He was 80.

<doc id="674229" wikidata="Q1132734" url="?curid=674229" title="Angels of Mons">
<text>The Angels of Mons is one of many stories of the reputed appearance of a variety of supernatural entities which protected the British Army from defeat by the invading forces of the German Empire at the beginning of World War I during the Battle of Mons in Belgium on 23 August 1914.

==History==
On 22–23 August 1914, the first major engagement of the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War occurred at the Battle of Mons. Advancing German forces were thrown back by heavily outnumbered British troops, who suffered heavy casualties and, being outflanked, were forced into rapid retreat the next day. The retreat and the battle were rapidly perceived by the British public as being a key moment in the war.

===Arthur Machen and the phantom bowmen===

On 29 September 1914, the Welsh author Arthur Machen published a short story entitled &quot;The Bowmen&quot; in &quot;The Evening News&quot;, inspired by accounts that he had read of the fighting at Mons and an idea he had had soon after the battle. Machen, who had already written some factual articles on the conflict for the paper, set his story at the time of the retreat from the Battle of Mons in August 1914. The story described phantom bowmen from the Battle of Agincourt summoned by a soldier calling on St. George, destroying a German host. Machen&#x27;s story was not, however, labelled as fiction, and the same edition of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Evening News&quot; ran a story by a different author under the heading &quot;Our Short Story&quot;. Machen&#x27;s story was written from a first-hand perspective and was a kind of false document, a technique Machen knew well. The unintended result was that Machen had a number of requests to provide evidence for his sources for the story soon after its publication, from readers who thought it was true, to which he responded that it was completely imaginary, as he had no desire to create a hoax.

A month or two later Machen received requests from the editors of parish magazines to reprint the story, which were granted. In the introduction to &quot;The Bowmen and Other Legends of the War&quot; (1915) Machen relates that an unnamed priest, the editor of one of these magazines, subsequently wrote to him asking if he would allow the story to be reprinted in pamphlet form, and if he would write a short preface giving sources for the story. Machen replied that they were welcome to reprint but he could not give any sources for the story since he had none. The priest replied that Machen must be mistaken, that the &quot;facts&quot; of the story must be true, and that Machen had just elaborated on a true account. As Machen later said:
Around that time variations of the story began to appear, told as authentic histories, including an account that told how the corpses of German soldiers had been found on the battlefield with arrow wounds. 

In &quot;The Bowmen&quot; Machen&#x27;s soldier saw &quot;a long line of shapes, with a shining about them&quot;. A Mr. A. P. Sinnett, writing in &quot;The Occult Review&quot;, stated that &quot;those who could see said they saw &#x27;a row of shining beings&#x27; between the two armies&quot;. This led Machen to suggest that the bowmen of his story had become the Angels of Mons. This last point was challenged by Harold Begbie in his book: &quot;On the Side of the Angels: A Reply to Arthur Machen&quot;, London 1915.

Phyllis Campbell&#x27;s 1915 memoir &quot;Back to the Front: Experiences of a Nurse&quot; includes tales of soldiers&#x27; visions of Joan of Arc and the archangel Michael which were told to her while serving as a nurse on the front in France. The construction of the book has led some literary scholars to describe it as a &quot;parallel work&quot; to Machen&#x27;s &quot;The Bowmen&quot;.

===Angels===

On 24 April 1915, an account was published in the British &quot;Spiritualist&quot; magazine telling of visions of a supernatural force that miraculously intervened to help the British at the decisive moment of the battle. This was rapidly followed by a flurry of similar accounts and the spread of wild rumours. Descriptions of this force varied from it being medieval longbow archers alongside St. George, to a strange luminous cloud, though eventually the dominant version came to be angelic warriors. Similar tales of such battlefield visions occurred in medieval and ancient warfare. Atrocity reports like the Rape of Belgium and that of the Crucified Soldier paved the way for a belief that the Christian God would intervene directly against such an evil enemy. However, there are strong similarities between many of these accounts of visions and Machen&#x27;s story published six months earlier.

In May 1915 a full-blown controversy was erupting, with the angels being used as proof of the action of divine providence on the side of the Allies in sermons across Britain, and then spreading into newspaper reports published widely across the world. Machen, bemused by all this, attempted to end the rumours by republishing the story in August in book form, with a long preface stating the rumours were false and originated in his story. It became a best-seller, and resulted in a vast series of other publications claiming to provide evidence of the Angels&#x27; existence. Machen tried to set the record straight, but any attempt to lessen the impact of such an inspiring story was seen as bordering on treason by some. These new publications included popular songs and artists&#x27; renderings of the angels. There were more reports of angels and apparitions from the front including Joan of Arc.

Kevin McClure&#x27;s study describes two types of accounts circulating: some more clearly based on Machen, others with different details. In a time of intense media interest all these reports allegedly confirming sightings of supernatural activity were second-hand and some of them were hoaxes created by soldiers who were not even at Mons. A careful investigation by the Society for Psychical Research in 1915 said of the first-hand testimony, &quot;We have received none at all, and of testimony at second-hand we have none that would justify us in assuming the occurrence of any supernormal phenomenon.&quot; The SPR went on to say the stories relating to battlefield &quot;visions&quot; which circulated during the spring and summer of 1915, &quot;prove on investigation to be founded on mere rumour, and cannot be traced to any authoritative source&quot;. Given that the Society for Psychical Research believed in the existence of supernatural forces, the conclusions of this report are highly significant.

The sudden spread of the rumours in the spring of 1915, six months after the events and Machen&#x27;s story was published, is also puzzling. The stories published then often attribute their sources to anonymous British officers. The latest and most detailed examination of the Mons story by David Clarke suggests these men may have been part of a covert attempt by military intelligence to spread morale-boosting propaganda and disinformation. As it was a time of Allied problems with the &quot;Lusitania&quot; sinking, Zeppelin attacks and failure to achieve a breakthrough on the Western Front, the timing would make military sense. Some of the stories conveniently claimed that sources could not be revealed for security reasons.

The only real evidence of visions from actual named serving soldiers provided during the debate stated that they saw visions of phantom cavalrymen, not angels or bowmen, and this occurred during the retreat rather than at the battle itself. Furthermore, these visions did not intervene to attack or deter German forces, a crucial element in Machen&#x27;s story and in the later tales of angels. Since during the retreat many troops were exhausted and had not slept properly for days, such visions could be hallucinations. 

According to the conclusion of the most detailed study of the event it seems that Machen&#x27;s story provided the genesis for the vast majority of the tales. The stories themselves certainly boosted morale on the home front, as popular enthusiasm was dying down in 1915 and they demonstrate the usefulness of religion in wartime.

==Post-war developments==

After the war the story continued to be frequently repeated, but with little factual evidence to support it from eye-witnesses to the events at the Battle of Mons. The most substantial piece of corroboratory evidence that is known to exist comes from Brigadier-General John Charteris&#x27; memoir &quot;At G.H.Q.&quot; (published 1931), which implies that the story of an: &quot;Angel of the Lord, clad in white raiment bearing a flaming sword, appearing before the German forces at the Mons battle forbidding their advance&quot;, was a popular rumour circulating in September 1914 among the troops of the British Army&#x27;s II Corps who had fought in the battle. However, General Charteris was not serving with II Corps in 1914, and was commenting on it therefore from a second-hand perspective, and an examination of his original war correspondence and notes from which his book&#x27;s text was drawn makes no contemporary mention of the story at that time. It would appear likely that he retrospectively added it into the book&#x27;s narrative when writing it post-war, acknowledging in the book&#x27;s preface that he had &#x27;amplified&#x27; the original source material in parts in such a way to supplement the text.

One example of the proliferation of material, which was particularly notable in religious circles, is the production in 1915 of a 160-line poem entitled &quot;The Angels of Mons&quot;, by Dugald MacEchern. It is contained in his book &quot;The Sword of the North: Highland Memories of the Great War&quot;, published in 1923. MacEchern, who was the Minister of the Parish of Bower (Caithness) between 1908 and 1946, was The Bard to the Gaelic Society of Inverness. He was attached to the Seaforth Highlanders during the Great War. He had a very wide range of contacts, including David Lloyd George

He supplied no original information about the legend of the Angels of Mons, but embellished it considerably – emphasizing that the heavenly hosts were actively engaged in the battle (on the side of the British), as well as supplying some details about their appearance. A short section of the poem is copied below:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Loose-flowing were their garments,&quot;
&quot;Their hair was burning gold—&quot;

&quot;Oh, they were fairer than the sun&quot;
&quot;So god-like was their mould!&quot;

&quot;We gazed! Were these the shining shapes&quot;
&quot;Of which the prophets tell?&quot;

&quot;We knew not: yet we felt we looked&quot;
&quot;On Michael and Gabriel.&quot;

&quot;And the central shining seemed the Christ&quot;
&quot;Whose wounds Heaven&#x27;s gates unbar,&quot;

&quot;And &#x27;neath his feet once pierced for us&quot;
&quot;There burned one golden star;&quot;

&quot;And in their hands were shining brands&quot;
&quot;That smote the tyrant&#x27;s pride!&quot;

&quot;Christ and his holy angels&quot;
&quot;Were fighting on our side!&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

Machen was associated with the story for the rest of his life and grew sick of the connection, as he regarded &quot;The Bowmen&quot; as a poor piece of work. He made little money from the story then or later.

The sudden revival of interest in appearances of angels from the 1980s onwards, especially in the United States, not only among Christians, but those interested in the New Age, has caused uncritical accounts of the story of the angels who saved the British Army to be regularly published in books and magazines. Similarly, the story is also often used by skeptics as a good example of how believers in the supernatural can become convinced of fantastic things by slender evidence. References to the story can be found in novels and films like &quot;&quot; set during World War I. The Friends of Arthur Machen frequently publish articles on developments in the case.

===William Doidge hoax===

In 2001, an article in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; claimed that a diary, film and photographic evidence proving the existence of the Angels of Mons from a World War I soldier named William Doidge had been found. The article discussed an involved story in which Doidge was involved with an American GI and an angel seen years later in Woodchester Mansion. It was claimed Marlon Brando and Tony Kaye were going to spend £350,000 to buy the evidence to make a film. Other papers like &quot;Variety&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and television programmes soon followed up the story and a website connected to the mystery became very popular. The footage was supposedly found in a trunk in an antique shop by Danny Sullivan in Monmouth, close to Machen&#x27;s birthplace of Caerleon. In 2002, in a BBC Radio documentary; &quot;The Making of an Urban Myth&quot;, Sullivan admitted the story was a hoax created to drum up interest in Woodchester Mansion, and the film footage and soldier were fictional.

<text>Presidency College is an art, commerce, and science college in the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu, India. On 16 October 1840, this school was established as the Madras Preparatory School before being repurposed as a high school, and then a graduate college. The Presidency College is one of the oldest government arts colleges in India. It is one of two Presidency Colleges established by the British in India, the other being the Presidency College, Kolkata.

== History ==

Sir Thomas Munro asked for a Committee of Public Instruction to form in 1826. In 1836, the committee&#x27;s duties changed to the &quot;Committee of Native Education&quot;. The plans drawn up by the committee did not commend themselves to the Governor of Madras, Lord Elphinstone, who proposed nineteen resolutions that passed unanimously.

Elphinstone chose E. B. Powell, a University of Cambridge Wrangler in mathematics, to be the first principal, and Powell accepted the post. He arrived in Mumbai (Bombay) on September 20, 1840, but did not reach Chennai (Madras) until 24 November. Meanwhile, the committee had invited Cooper from Hoogly College, Kolkata, to temporarily carry out the principal duties at a salary of Rs 400 per month. Cooper accepted the invitation and came to Chennai (Madras). He and his staff opened Presidency School, a preparatory school, in a rented building in Egmore known as Edinburgh Home, on 16 October 1840. Cooper remained in the primary school for only a few months. Soon after Powell&#x27;s arrival, and before the high school department opened on 12 April 1841, he returned to Kolkata. The preparatory school shifted to Popham&#x27;s Broadway in 1841.

The schools grew into Presidency College. When the University of Madras was founded in 1857, Presidency College became affiliated with it.

In 1870, the college moved to its present location in Kamaraj Salai, opposite Marina Beach.

<text>The Fell system was a third-rail system for railways that were too steep to be worked by adhesion on the running rails alone. It used a raised centre rail between the two running rails to provide extra traction and braking, or braking alone. Trains were propelled by wheels horizontally applied and retracted by springs onto the centre rail, controlled from the footplate, as well as by the normal running wheels. In practice, the running wheels could be allowed to run freely to reduce wear, but the centre brake shoes needed to be replaced frequently. For example: the locomotives&#x27; shoes were replaced after each journey on the Mont Cenis Pass Railway. Extra brake shoes were fitted to specially designed or adapted Fell locomotives and brake vans, and for traction the prototype locomotive had auxiliary cylinders powering the horizontal wheels. The Fell system was developed in the 1860s and was soon superseded by various types of rack railway for new lines, but some Fell systems remained in use into the 1960s. The Snaefell Mountain Railway still uses the Fell system for (emergency) braking, but not for traction.

== History ==

The Fell system was designed, developed and patented by British engineer John Barraclough Fell. The first test application was alongside the Cromford and High Peak Railway&#x27;s cable-hauled incline at Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire, England, in 1863 and 1864. The prototype locomotive had separate pairs of cylinders for the horizontal and vertical drive wheels (but this arrangement was simplified in subsequent versions). The outer pair of cylinders (11¾ inches diameter, stroke 18 inches) drove the vertical driving wheels in the usual way. An inner pair of cylinders (11 inches diameter, stroke 10 inches) drove the horizontal wheels. These wheels were forced into contact with the central rail by a horizontal screw thread, controlled by a hand wheel on the footplate, that forced helical springs inwards to press on the vertically aligned journals.

These tests attracted the attention of the French Government, which conducted its own tests on the slopes of Mont Cenis in 1865. As a result, the Mont Cenis Pass Railway was built by a British company as a temporary connection between France and Italy whilst the tunnel under the Alpine pass was being built; shortening the transit time for mail from Britain and France to Italy and beyond.

In 1913 Fell&#x27;s son George Noble Fell published variations of his father&#x27;s apparatus using either electric traction or &quot;gaseous fuel&quot;. For electric traction the centre rail would also act as the current conductor rail; the horizontal drive wheels would adhere by magnetism, and the brakes would be applied by electromagnets. For the internal combustion version the horizontal guide wheels would be coated with carborundum for improved grip.

== List of Fell railways ==

The following railways have used the Fell system. Of these, the only one still in operation is the electrified Snaefell Mountain Railway on the Isle of Man, which occasionally uses the centre rail for braking only; the cars are all now equipped with rheostatic braking, which meets all normal braking needs. The only surviving Fell locomotive, New Zealand Railways H 199, is preserved at the Fell Locomotive Museum, Featherston, New Zealand, near the site of the Rimutaka Incline.

===France===
*The Mont Cenis Pass Railway on the border with Italy was long and ran from 1868 until superseded by a tunnel under the pass in 1871. Some characteristics of the Mont Cenis Pass Railway include:
** gauge – the gauge in English speaking world is sometimes quoted as 3 ft  in
** Steepest gradient 1 in 12 (8.3%)
** Gradient where Fell grip system was deemed to be needed 1 in 25 (4.0%)
** Climb 
** Centre rail above running rails and about above sleeper.
** Sharpest curve 
** Since there were breaks-of-gauge at each end of the Fell railway, it is not known if ordinary standard gauge rolling stock were needed.
** Length of line .
** Length of Fell section 

===Brazil===

*The Estrada de Ferro Cantagalo from Niterói to Nova Friburgo opened in 1873. Brazil&#x27;s first mountain railway, of gauge, re-used some of the equipment from the Mont Cenis Pass Railway, and continued in operation until the 1960s. The Fell centre rail was used only for braking after 1884.

===Isle of Man===

* The Snaefell Mountain Railway opened in 1895. It uses electric railcars, with a Fell rail for braking.

=== Italy ===
* See France: Mont Cenis Pass Railway.
===New Zealand===
** The Rewanui Incline on the West Coast of the South Island used a Fell rail for braking from its opening in 1914 to 1966. It closed in 1985.
** The Rimutaka Incline on the Wairarapa Line near Featherston in the North Island opened in 1878 and closed in 1955. It was replaced by the Rimutaka tunnel. Unlike the other lines noted, it used the Fell system for propulsion as well as braking throughout its active life. The Fell Engine Museum in Featherston houses the sole preserved Fell locomotive (NZR H class). .
** The Roa Incline on the West Coast of the South Island used a Fell rail for braking from its opening in 1909. It closed in 1960.
** The Kaikorai Cable Car which ran from Dunedin to the Kaikorai Valley used an off-centre Fell rail for braking.
* Funicular railway
** The Wellington Cable Car used a Fell rail for emergency braking from its opening in 1902 until 1978, when it was upgraded.
* unknown gauges
**Price&#x27;s Bush Tramway near Akatarawa.
**Charming Creek Tramway near Ngakawau.
** Several bush tramways used Fell rails for braking.

<doc id="674234" wikidata="Q2749583" url="?curid=674234" title="Presidency University, Kolkata">
<text>Presidency University, formerly Presidency College, is a public state university located in College Street, Kolkata. Established in 1817 as the &quot;Hindoo College&quot;, it was later renamed &quot;Presidency College&quot; in 1855 and functioned as a leading constituent college under the University of Calcutta. It is widely regarded as one of the oldest and most prestigious places of higher education in India. Alumni of Presidency University include two Nobel laureates, leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, heads of state, Academy Award winners and pioneers in Bengali art and literature playing a pivotal role in shaping modern Indian and Bengal education and intellectual discourse.

In its first cycle as a university, Presidency received &quot;A&quot; grade with a score of 3.04/4.00 by the National Assessment and Accreditation Commission. It has been recognized as an University of National Eminence by the University Grants Commission. It was awarded an &quot;A&quot; grade by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) in June 2024. The university received a Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) of 3.13 out of 4, which is valid for five years.
==History==
With the creation of the Supreme Court of Calcutta in 1773 many Hindus of Bengal showed an eager interest in learning the English language. David Hare, in collaboration with Raja Radhakanta Deb had already taken steps to introduce English language education in Bengal. Babu Buddinath Mukherjee advanced the introduction of English as a medium of instruction further by enlisting the support of Sir Edward Hyde East, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Fort William, who called a meeting of &#x27;European and Hindu Gentlemen&#x27; at his house in May 1816. The purpose of the meeting was to &quot;discuss the proposal to establish an institution for giving a liberal education to the children of the members of the Hindu Community&quot;. The proposal was received with unanimous approbation and a donation of over Rs. 100,000 was promised for setting up the new college. The 5 Babus who contributed the most in setting up the college with their donations were - Raja Gopi Mohun Deb of Shovabazar Raj, Maharaja Tej Chandra of Bardhaman Raj, Raja Gopi Mohan Tagore of Pathuriaghata, Babu Joy Krishna Singha of Jorasanko, and Babu Ganga Narayan Das. Raja Ram Mohan Roy showed full support for the scheme, but chose not to come out in support of the proposal publicly for fear of &quot;alarming the prejudices of his orthodox countrymen and thus marring the whole idea&quot;.

At first, the classes were held at Gorachand Bysack house called Garanhatta (later renamed 304, Chitpore Road), which was rented by the college. In January 1818 the college moved to &#x27;Feringhi Kamal Bose&#x27;s house in Chitpore. From Chitpore, the college moved to Bowbazar and later to the building that now houses the Sanskrit College on College Street.

===Transformation to university===
On 19 March 2010, the West Bengal Government passed the Presidency University Bill, 2009 in the State Legislative Assembly. On 7 July 2010, the Governor of West Bengal, M K Narayanan gave his assent to the Presidency University Bill. On 23 July 2010, the Government of West Bengal published the gazette notification completing all the legal formalities for presidency to become a full university. Amiya Bagchi was given the responsibility of chairing a committee set up to select and appoint the first vice-chancellor of the university. 
Amita Chatterjee, a retired professor of philosophy at Jadavpur University, was appointed as the first Vice-Chancellor of Presidency University on 5 October 2010.

In 2011, Higher Education Minister Bratya Basu suggested that a mentor group, along the lines of the Nalanda mentor group, would be formed to oversee the work of the university. At the beginning of June 2011, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, announced that a committee would be formed with Amartya Sen as its chief mentor and Harvard-based Sugata Bose as its chairman to oversee the running of the college and perform the task of appointing all its officials and faculty members. The Presidency mentor group
 also includes as its members 2019 Economics Nobel Prize winner Abhijit Banerjee, Ashoke Sen, Sabyasachi Bhattacharya, Nayanjot Lahiri, Himadri Pakrashi, Rahul Mukerjee and Isher Judge Ahluwalia, Swapan Kumar Chakravorty. Sukanta Chaudhuri resigned from the committee in 2012.

The entrance of the campus is marked with a small guardhouse on the left. On the wall of the guard room is a plaque dedicated to durwan (guard) Ram Eqbal Singh, who died defending the institute from rioters. The university held its bicentenary celebrations in 2017.

==Organisation structure==
=== Governance ===
Like every state university in West Bengal, Presidency University is headed by the chancellor, who is the Governor of West Bengal. The vice-chancellor is the academic and administrative head of the institution. The post of the vice-chancellor replaced that of the principal after Presidency College received university status. Professor Anuradha Lohia was the first permanent vice-chancellor of the institution. The current Registrar of the university is Dr. Debajyoti Konar.

The Controller of Examinations, the Chief Librarian, the Finance officer and the Dean of students, along with the Dean of Arts and the Dean of Sciences, are the other important office holders of the university. The university is guided by a mentor group. The Mentor Group is chaired by Sugata Bose, the Gardiner Professor of Oceanic History and Affairs at Harvard University. Nobel Laureate and economist Amartya Sen serves as the Advisor to the chair.


=== Principals of Presidency College ===


=== Departments ===
In academics, the university consists of two faculties – the Faculty of Natural and Mathematical Sciences and the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. Both Faculties are headed by deans. A total of 16 departments function under the university. They are: Bengali, English, Hindi, History, Performing Arts, Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology, Life Sciences, Chemistry, Economics, Geography, Geology, Mathematics, Physics and Statistics.


== Rankings ==
During its tenure as a college, formal national ranking systems like the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) were not in place. However different news outlets ranked &quot;Presidency college&quot; as one of the leading institutes for humanities and natural sciences.

Presidency University, Kolkata was in the inaugural list of the top 50 institutions in the National Institutional Ranking Framework(NIRF) in 2016. In 2025, the university was ranked 124 in Asian University Rankings - Southern Asia. The university was ranked 151-200 overall in India by the NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) in 2024.

==Notable alumni==
Alumni of Presidency University include two Nobel Laureates in Economics, leaders of the Indian Independence Movement, heads of state, Academy Award winners, academicians and pioneers in Bengali renaissance.

<doc id="674251" wikidata="Q18828" url="?curid=674251" title="Cecilia Bartoli">
<text>Cecilia Bartoli (; born 4 June 1966) is an Italian mezzo-soprano widely known in the music of Bellini, Handel, Mozart, Rossini and Vivaldi and for lesser-known music of the Baroque and Classical periods. She has also sung soprano and alto repertory.

Bartoli is considered a singer with an unusual timbre. According to Nicholas Wroe in 2001, her voice was known for its &quot;fully developed sumptuousness of the lower register, the vibrancy of the middle range...the top was limpid and powerful&quot;, and she was one of the most popular opera singers of recent years.

== Early life ==
Bartoli was born in Rome. Her parents, Silvana Bazzoni and Pietro Angelo Bartoli, were professional singers and gave her her first music lessons. She first performed publicly at age nine as the shepherd boy in &quot;Tosca&quot;. Bartoli later studied at the Conservatorio di Santa Cecilia in Rome. At the age of 19, she made her singing debut on the Italian television show &quot;Fantastico&quot;. She did not win the competition but was asked to sing with Paris Opera for an homage concert for Maria Callas.

==Performing career==
Bartoli made her professional opera debut in 1987 at the Arena di Verona. The following year she undertook the role of Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; at the Cologne Opera, the Schwetzingen Festival and the Zurich Opera earning rave reviews. Working with conductors Daniel Barenboim and Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Bartoli focused on Mozart roles, such as Zerlina in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; and Dorabella in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, and from then on her career developed internationally.

In 1990, she made her debut at the Opéra Bastille as Cherubino in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; and her debut at the Hamburg State Opera as Idamantes in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Idomeneo,&quot; followed by her La Scala debut as Isolier in &quot;Le comte Ory&quot; in 1991, a performance that solidified her reputation as one of the world&#x27;s leading Rossini singers.

In 1996, Bartoli made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera as Despina in &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; and returned in 1997 to sing the title role of &quot;La Cenerentola&quot; and in 1998 to sing the role of Susanna in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;. In 2000, she sang in another Mozart soprano role, Donna Elvira in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, at the Deutsche Oper Berlin. In 2001, she made a long-awaited Royal Opera House debut, taking the roles of Euridice and the Genio in the London stage premiere of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;anima del filosofo&quot;.

She is foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.

=== Work in Baroque music ===

In addition to Mozart and Rossini, Bartoli has spent much of her career performing and recording Baroque and early Classical era music by such composers as Gluck, Vivaldi, Haydn and Salieri. In early 2005, she sang Cleopatra in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;. She often performs with the Baroque ensemble Il Giardino Armonico.

In 2012, Bartoli produced a project entitled &quot;Mission&quot;, which premiered the works of Agostino Steffani, a lesser-known Baroque composer. Bartoli produced the music of the composer in CD form as well as an extended music video that portrays her as the priest-composer Agostino in the palace of Versallies. The video is known for its historic and visual accuracy of the Baroque period. Cecilia Bartoli&#x27;s performance and production of Mission reflect the music and aesthetic of Steffani&#x27;s time period through the setting, wardrobe, and cinematography.&quot;

=== Work in bel canto ===
In 2007/08, Bartoli devoted her time to studying and recording the early 19th-century repertoire – the era of Italian Romanticism and bel canto – and especially the legendary singer Maria Malibran, the 200th anniversary of whose birth was celebrated in March 2008. The album &quot;Maria&quot; was released in September 2007. In May 2008, Bartoli sang the title role written for Malibran in a revival of Fromental Halévy&#x27;s 1828 opera &quot;Clari&quot; at the Zurich Opera. In June 2010, she sang the title role of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot; for the first time with conductor Thomas Hengelbrock in a concert at the Konzerthaus Dortmund. In March 2011, Bartoli toured five Australian cities with two programs drawn from &quot;Sacrificium&quot; and &quot;Maria&quot;.

== Administration career ==

=== Salzburg Whitsun Festival ===

In 2012, Bartoli became the artistic director of the Salzburg Whitsun Festival, an extension of the traditional Salzburg Festival, which produces performances during Whitsun (Pentecost) weekend. Forgoing the academic programming of her predecessors, she reformulated the festival&#x27;s programming—returning to &quot;the old recipe of organizing beautiful programs and inviting great artists&quot;—resulting in record ticket sales and placing the festival on the international opera calendar. In 2012, she sang Cleopatra in Handel&#x27;s &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot;, in 2013 the title role in Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;, and in 2014 Rossini&#x27;s &quot;La Cenerentola&quot;.

=== Opéra de Monte-Carlo ===
In December 2019, it was announced that Bartoli would succeed Jean-Louis Grinda as the director of the Opéra de Monte-Carlo, effective on 1 January 2023. She became the first woman to hold the position.

== Personal life ==
Bartoli lives with her husband, the Swiss bass-baritone Oliver Widmer, in Zollikon on the north shore of Lake Zurich, Switzerland, and in Rome part of the year. The couple married in 2011 after twelve years together. Bartoli lived in Monaco in the early 2010s.

== Awards and honours ==
Bartoli was appointed Chevalier of the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (1995), and Commander of Monaco&#x27;s Order of Cultural Merit (November 1999).

In 2003, she received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music at the Classic Brit Awards.

In 2010, she was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Music from University College Dublin.

In 2011, she won a fifth Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Performance for &quot;Sacrificium&quot;. In 2012, she was voted into the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Gramophone&quot;&#x27;s Hall of Fame. She is the 2012 recipient of the Herbert von Karajan Music Prize.

<text>Westport () is a town in the West Coast region of the South Island of New Zealand. Established in 1861, it is the oldest European settlement on the West Coast. Originally named Buller, it is on the right bank and at the mouth of the Buller River, close by the prominent headland of Cape Foulwind. It is connected via State Highway 6 with Greymouth, to the south, and with Nelson in the northeast, via the Buller Gorge. The population of the Westport urban area was as of . The Buller District had a population of .

== Name ==
The Māori language name for the river and the region is , meaning deep and swift. The town is thought to have been named after Westport, County Mayo in Ireland, although the choice of name was no doubt also guided by its location.

==History==
From an archaeological excavation site, near the mouth of the Buller River (), it is clear that Māori were living close to Westport by the early 14th century. Māori mostly lived in coastal areas, though they explored the mountains for pounamu (jade or greenstone), which they then traded with other iwi.

The first wave of European settlers came to Westport in 1861 as gold miners, and the first European vessel said to have entered the river was the sealing schooner &quot;Three Brothers&quot; in 1844, though other sealing vessels were recorded in the Cape Foulwind area in the 1820s. The 1880s saw many exploratory parties of geologists and surveyors combing the area for the presence of valuable resources and taking the measure of the land. Amongst them were Charles Heaphy, William Fox and Thomas Brunner. While gold brought initial interest to the area, and for example, led to large areas of the coastal areas (covered by sediment from the river) being dredged for the valuable mineral, the area soon became much more famous for coal mining, still a dominant concern in the region today.
A coal mining company was formed in 1878 called the Westport Colliery Company Ltd, and then became The Westport Coal Company in 1881 when a group of Dunedin businessmen purchased the mines. The coal fields were at Coalbrookdale (Denniston) and Granity Creek (Millerton) and coal was transported to the Westport harbour to be shipped out. By 1905 The Westport Coal Company was New Zealand&#x27;s largest coal producer.

Westport was administrated as part of the Nelson Province from 1853 to 1876.

Westport has been damaged by several earthquakes, the worst the 1929 Murchison earthquake, in which several buildings collapsed, including the post office tower. The town now has a number of Art Deco buildings that were constructed after the earthquake, for example the Clock Tower Chambers.
===Flooding===
Westport and the Buller District have had several floods since 1846. In January 1868, heavy rain led to flooding, which destroyed two wharves. The town was flooded again in October and November 1926, and yet again in 1970, 2012, and 2015. In 2018, Westport was damaged by Cyclone Fehi during the 2017–18 South Pacific cyclone season. According to Land River Sea Consulting founder and river engineer Matthew Gardner, Westport is sited on a flood-prone catchment and climate change is causing water levels to rise. A West Coast Regional Council spokesperson expressed concern about the under-investment in flood protection including dredging and river management work in Westport. 
In July 2021, wet weather throughout New Zealand caused more flooding, leading to the evacuation of about 2,000 people, roughly half of the town&#x27;s 4,600 residents. The flood caused millions of dollars in damages and damaged hundreds of homes in Westport. 563 homes were damaged with 70 homes being red stickered and 393 homes being yellow stickered. 23% of the town&#x27;s 983 dwellings required repairs. By mid-October 2021, 450 homes remained uninhabitable or damaged. 140 remained in temporary accommodation including cabins, motels, or relatives&#x27; homes.

In February 2022, Westport and the Buller District had heavy rain and significant flooding, which damaged homes, infrastructure, farms, and roads. Residents were also evacuated. On 10 February, a state of emergency was declared in the Buller District. Minister of Rural Affairs Damien O&#x27;Connor described the February flooding in Westport as &quot;one of the worst he had seen&quot; and attributed it to climate change. On 23 February, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced a NZ$500,000 scheme to assist farmers in Westport and the wider West Coast region with flood damage called &quot;Task Force Green.&quot;

In July 2022, Stuff reported that over 400 homes in Westport had not been fully repaired since the floods that struck the city in July 2021. Of the 563 flood damaged homes, just over 100 had fully completed their repairs. The Buller District Council and the West Coast Regional Council submitted a NZ$54 million business case for the region which includes investing in flood walls, subsidising people to move from flood-prone areas, and investing in Westport&#x27;s stormwater system.

==Geography==

===Climate===

The Westport climate is strongly influenced by the high amount of precipitation from the Tasman Sea, with all months being rather wet on average. Despite very high annual rainfall, Westport is often prone to drought and conservation measures are sometimes triggered. While colder than the more northern parts of New Zealand, average temperature changes over the year are not extreme.

The percentage of people born overseas was 9.2, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 56.3% had no religion, 33.6% were Christian, 0.3% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.5% were Hindu, 0.1% were Muslim, 0.3% were Buddhist and 1.5% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 303 (8.3%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 1,179 (32.2%) people had no formal qualifications. 351 people (9.6%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 1,398 (38.2%) people were employed full-time, 561 (15.3%) were part-time, and 159 (4.3%) were unemployed.

===Rural surrounds===
Westport Rural surrounds Westport on the west, south and east, and includes Carters Beach. It covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, Westport Rural had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Westport Rural had a population of 1,260 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 30 people (2.4%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 285 people (29.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 498 households, comprising 624 males and 639 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.98 males per female. The median age was 50.1 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 249 people (19.8%) aged under 15 years, 96 (7.6%) aged 15 to 29, 606 (48.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 306 (24.3%) aged 65 or older.

==Economy==
Economic activity is based around fishing, coal mining and dairy farming. Historically, gold mining was a major industry, and coal mining was much more extensive than today (especially in terms of employment numbers). However, the region still is home to New Zealand&#x27;s largest opencast mining operation in Stockton. Some native forest logging occurred in the area until cessation around 1999.

The Holcim company had a large cement plant in the southwest side of town until its closure on 30 June 2016.

Westport is also home to EPIC Westport an innovation hub, which houses software developers and business startups.

==Media==

A daily local newspaper is published in Westport, the &quot;Westport News&quot;. The Westport News building also houses coast-wide local radio station Coast FM.

==Tourism==

Tourist attracts in the area include Cape Foulwind, Tauranga Bay with its large fur seal colony, and fine surfing beaches. The opening of the Old Ghost Road which runs between Lyell and Seddonville to the north of Westport has seen an explosion in the number of mountain bikers visiting the area. The Kawatiri Coastal Trail is under development between Westport, Carters Beach, Cape Foulwind, and Charleston.The Pūwaha Section of the trail from Westport to Carters Beach was the first of nine sections to be built. It was officially opened on 6 December 2020. The remaining sections are expected to be completed by June 2022.

Rafting and jetboating in the Buller Gorge are popular. Westport is a base for trips to Karamea and the Oparara Basin Arches with the only road access to the area running north from Westport. Paparoa National Park is also located nearby.

== Transport==
Westport is served by State Highway 67, and the 8.9 km spur State Highway 67A to Carters Beach and Cape Foulwind which terminates at the former Holcim cement plant location.

The Holcim company managed the day-to-day operations of Westport&#x27;s port until ceasing operations in the district, using it to ship their cement product to market, for example to the Port of Onehunga in Auckland.

The first railway of the area in 1864 ran from Westport to the coal fields, most of them north of town. The first section of railway from Westport to Fairdown via Sergeants Hill opened on 31 December 1875; this line ultimately reached Seddonville in 1895 and was known as the Seddonville Branch. From this beginning, an isolated network of branch lines was developed: a Westport-Inangahua branch line of about 12 miles (19 km) was authorised by the Railways Authorisation Act, 1904. But the lines were not linked to the national network until the completion of the Stillwater–Westport Line through the Buller Gorge in 1942.

<text>A hechsher or hekhsher (; &quot;prior approval&quot;; plural: &quot;hechsherim&quot;) is a rabbinical product certification, qualifying items (usually foods) that conform to the requirements of Jewish religious law.

==Forms==
A hechsher may be a printed and signed certificate displayed at a commercial venue or on a media advertisement advising the consumer that the subjected product is kosher. Such certificates usually display the name of the rabbinical court issuing the hechsher, the name of the business or product, date of issue, expiry date and stamp of rabbi who issued the certificate.

It may also be a certification marking on individual retail packaging of items which have been certified as Kosher. This marking is usually a basic stamp or emblem indicating the issuing rabbinical court. Modern hechsherim display sophisticated holograms and seals which are hard to forge.

==Types==
A hechsher is typically issued for food products, and is also issued on non-food items which come in contact with foods, such as cleaning agents and disposable cutlery, certifying that its ingredients do not contain any animal extracts or other halakhically prohibited substances.

The dietary laws of kashrut specify food items that may be eaten and others that are prohibited as set out in the commandments of the Torah.

Observant Jews will generally only eat permitted foods. To assist Jewish consumers, rabbinic authorities produce and regulate their own &quot;hechsherim&quot;. It is usually Orthodox rabbis who assume the jobs of &quot;mashgichim&quot; (singular masculine &quot;mashgiach&quot; or singular feminine &quot;mashgicha&quot;, &quot;supervisor&quot;). This means that they will &quot;supervise&quot; the products and processes that manufacture kosher food to ensure compliance with the required standards. The &quot;mashgichim&quot; allow the manufacturer to apply a &quot;hechsher&quot; to the packaging of the product only if it is found to contain only kosher ingredients and produced following &quot;halakha&quot;.

The rabbi may also apply additional words or letters after the &quot;hechsher&quot; to denote whether the product contains meat (often denoted &quot;Meat&quot;), dairy (D or Dairy), neither meat nor dairy (Pareve), whether the product is Kosher for Passover because it contains no chametz (P), whether the product is &quot;Pas Yisroel&quot; (bread baked at least in part by a Jew), &quot;cholov yisroel&quot; (milk whose extraction was done by or under the supervision of a Jew), or whether the product is yoshon (lit. &quot;old&quot;: all grain contents took root before the previous Passover).

It is also common for rabbis to issue a hechsher on religious accessories, such as tefillin, mezuzot and tzitzit, which must be produced according to specific halakhic procedures and requirements. Other items which are used for religious practice such as Four Species bear a hechsher testifying that they confirm to halakhic requirements.

In Israel, it is common for manufacturers of all kinds to display a hechsher on products or in commercial advertisements, certifying that their production was not done during the Shabbat.

==History==

===Seals===

The Babylonian Talmud cites an early example of a kashrut seal: the seal of the Kohen Gadol on jugs containing olive oil used in the Jewish Temple for the lighting of the Menorah.

&#x27;LMLK seals&#x27; (bearing the Hebrew letters למלך, equivalent to LMLK) were stamped on the handles of large storage jars mostly in and around Jerusalem during the reign of King Hezekiah (circa 700 BC), based on several complete jars found &quot;in situ&quot; buried under a destruction layer caused by Sennacherib at Lachish. None of the original seals have been found, but about 2,000 impressions (also referred to as &quot;stamps&quot;) made by at least 21 seal types have been published.

The practice of marking food as a sign of kashrut can be dated back as far as the 6th century CE. A clay stamp bearing a Menorah image from this period was discovered in an excavation near Acre, Israel in 2011. According to archeologists, local Jews stamped their dough with Menorah impressions while preparing bread, in order for consumers to verify its kashrut.

In New York City in the late 18th and early 19th centuries a shochet (kosher slaughterer) sold meat from the animals he slaughtered, with a seal affixed certifying it was kosher, to butchers who also sold non-kosher meat. In 1796 the city&#x27;s Common Council suspended the butcher license of a non-Jewish butcher, Nicholas Smart, for seven weeks for selling non-kosher meat with a counterfeit seal. In 1805 another non-Jewish butcher, Caleb Vandenburg, also had his butcher license temporarily suspended after Jacob Abrahams, who had been the shochet in New York since 1803, inspected meat to which Vandenburg had affixed a seal saying it was kosher and testified that he had not slaughtered the animal the meat came from.

===Certification===
An 11th-century certificate found in the Cairo Geniza written by a rabbinical court, testified the kosher status &quot;according to rabbinic law&quot; of the cheeses being sold by a Karaite grocer, Yefet b. Meshullam of Jerusalem. The document explains that the cheese was produced in a factory on the Mount of Olives that followed rabbinic practice. The certificate reads: &quot;The cheeses are kosher and it is appropriate for Rabbanite Jews to purchase them. We grant this permission only after having made a formal purchase from him and having witnessed an oath he took on the holy Torah.&quot;

==Specific authorities==

In America, one of the best known &quot;hechsher&quot; symbols is the &quot;OU&quot; from Orthodox Union Kosher the world&#x27;s largest kosher certification agency, under the auspices of the Orthodox Union. As of 2010, it supervises more than 400,000 products in 8,000 plants in 80 different countries.

In Britain, the largest &quot;hechsher&quot; symbol in Europe, is the &quot;KLBD&quot; of the London Beth Din based in London. The &quot;MK&quot; symbol of the Manchester Beth Din is also a globally recognised symbol, listed by many international brands.

Other hechsher include: OK Kosher Certification based in Brooklyn, New York, Star-K based in Baltimore, Maryland, EarthKosher Kosher Certification Agency with offices in Colorado, New York and Israel, the logo of both the Johannesburg and Cape Town Beth Din used in South Africa, MK Va&#x27;ad Ha&#x27;ir based in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, and The Kashrut Authority based in Sydney, Australia. The largest number of agencies is in the USA.

&quot;Kashrus Magazine&quot; publishes a bi-annual guide to almost all kosher supervision agencies worldwide; its 2019 &quot;Kosher Supervision Guide&quot; (226 pages including an index) features 1,427 agencies. A bi-annual supplement of some 32 pages is published in alternate years. The latest supplement was published in September 2021 and brought the number of agencies listed to 1,493.

==In popular culture==
At the 2006 Scripps National Spelling Bee, contestant Saryn Hooks correctly spelled &quot;hechsher&quot;, but her spelling was ruled incorrect. A few minutes later, the judges realized their printed spelling of &quot;hechscher&quot; was incorrect and reinstated Hooks, thanks to 7th grader Lucas Brown, who noticed the error and called it to the attention of his father.

<text>Jago Nicholas Aldo Eliot, Lord Eliot (24 March 1966 – 15 April 2006) was the son of Peregrine Eliot, 10th Earl of St Germans, and Jacquetta Eliot, Countess of St Germans (née Lampson).

==Biography==
In 1988, on the death of his grandfather, he became styled Lord Eliot. He was educated at Millfield School.

Eliot was an early collaborator with Eddie Izzard at Covent Garden as a busker, he then moved to Brighton in the late 1980s where he promoted a number of nights at the ZAP club, including Fundamental and Pow Wow. He returned to Cornwall in the mid-1990s and in 2002 founded the Port Eliot Literature Festival, an annual event held in the grounds of the house.

Eliot worked with digital and creative projects, either with the Arts Council or the Port Eliot Literary Festival, and London Arts projects. Shortly before his death, Eliot had been awarded an Artist Fellowship in Creative Technology by Hewlett-Packard and was exploring invisible sculpture and 3D soundscapes.

He also began to develop strategies to ensure Port Eliot would continue to be a vibrant cultural laboratory, building on the legend of the Elephant Fayre and helping define the ethos of the Port Eliot Literary Festival, through conversations with friends such as Tom Hodgkinson of the Idler magazine. His passion for the arts saw him also involved with the A Foundation, through his Literati project and i-DAT with the A Conversation at Port Eliot in 2006. This was the first in a proposed series on emerging ideas in art, science and technology organised by Jago Eliot and The Institute of Digital Art and Technology at the University of Plymouth. The themes for this seminar were &#x27;art and irrationality&#x27; and &#x27;a geography of the immaterial&#x27;.

==Marriage &amp; children==
Eliot married former model Bianca Ciambriello. The couple were first &quot;married&quot; in the &quot;Lost Vagueness&quot; garden at the Glastonbury Festival, before a more formal ceremony at Port Eliot, the seat of the Eliot family. The alternative wedding is featured in Julian Temple&#x27;s 2006 film Glastonbury. They had one son and twin daughters.

==Death==
Eliot died on 15 April 2006. He was determined to have died from epilepsy, which he had developed in 2004.

<doc id="674263" wikidata="Q82648" url="?curid=674263" title="Sarehole">
<text>Sarehole () is an area in Hall Green, Birmingham, England. Historically in Worcestershire, it was a small hamlet in the larger parish, and manor, of Yardley, which was transferred to Birmingham in 1911. Birmingham was classed as part of Warwickshire until 1974, and since then has been part of the West Midlands.

W. H. Duignan&#x27;s &quot;Worcestershire Place Names&quot; conjectures that the name derives from Old English &quot;Syrfe&quot;, &quot;Service tree&quot;, and &quot;hyll&quot;, &quot;Hill&quot;.

Sarehole gave its name to a farm (now built over) and a mill. It extended from the ford at Green Lane (now Green Road), southwards for about a mile, along the River Cole to the Dingles. Birmingham City Council has named the segment of the path along the Cole southwards from Sarehole Mill the &quot;John Morris Jones Walkway&quot; after a local historian.

J. R. R. Tolkien lived here as a child in the 1890s. The area influenced his description of the green and peaceful country of the Shire in his books. The nearby Moseley Bog (now a nature reserve) may have been the inspiration for the Old Forest. Tolkien stated:

According to local legend, the hill on which Spring Hill College stands is criss-crossed with secret tunnels and could easily have become Tolkien&#x27;s Bag End. Sarehole Mill, which also influenced the young Tolkien, is a water-driven mill, now a museum, within the Shire Country Park. During the 18th century the mill was leased by Matthew Boulton, one of the pioneers of the Industrial Revolution and leading figure of the Lunar Society, for scientific experimentation.
