<doc id="676246" wikidata="Q5644910" url="?curid=676246" title="Hamilton E. Holmes">
<text>Hamilton E. Holmes (8 July, 1941 – 26 October, 1995) was an American orthopedic physician. He and Charlayne Hunter-Gault were the first two African-American students admitted to the University of Georgia. Additionally, Holmes was the first African-American student to attend the Emory University School of Medicine, where he earned his M.D. degree in 1967, later becoming a professor of orthopedics and associate dean at the school.

== Early life ==
Holmes was born July 8, 1941, in Atlanta, Georgia. His father, Alfred, was an Atlanta businessman and his mother, Isabella, was a teacher. His grandfather, Hamilton Mayo Holmes, was a physician, and was one of Hamilton&#x27;s influences. His grandfather and uncle, Oliver Wendell Holmes, helped to desegregate golf courses in Atlanta in 1955. In his high school years, Holmes attended Henry McNeal Turner High School, which at the time was considered one of the most prestigious high schools for African-Americans in Atlanta. He graduated in 1959 as valedictorian. He was also a member of his high school&#x27;s football and basketball teams.

== Morehouse College and The University of Georgia ==
After graduating from high school, Holmes, along with fellow Henry McNeal Turner High School graduate Charlayne Hunter, applied to the University of Georgia in the fall of 1959; however, both were denied. After this, Holmes enrolled at Morehouse College, while he and Hunter continued to apply to the University of Georgia every quarter. Meanwhile, Holmes sought membership and was initiated into the Alpha Rho chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha at Morehouse College. In January 1961, both Holmes and Hunter were admitted to UGA.

During his time at UGA, Holmes would generally keep to himself. He lived off campus, and on the weekends, he would return home to Atlanta where he continued his membership with the Morehouse College chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha until 1963. Holmes was a member of Phi Beta Kappa fraternity and Phi Kappa Phi Honors fraternity.

== Emory University and Medical career ==
After graduating from the University of Georgia, Holmes became the first African-American student to be accepted to the Emory University School of Medicine. He graduated in 1967 and began his residency at Detroit General Hospital. He then left in 1969 to serve as an army ranger in Germany, before returning to Emory to complete his residency. He eventually opened up a private practice in Atlanta, later becoming a professor and associate dean at Emory, and the medical director and head orthopedic surgeon at Grady Memorial Hospital.

== Personal life ==
Holmes was married to Marilyn Vincent Holmes. They had two children; a son, Hamilton Jr., who is also a University of Georgia alumnus, and a daughter, Alison. He is a namesake of the Holmes-Hunter Academic Building on the University of Georgia campus and the university&#x27;s Holmes-Hunter Lectures, and was a trustee of the University of Georgia Foundation.

Holmes died in 1995 of heart failure in Atlanta, Georgia.

For many years after graduating, Holmes stayed away from the University of Georgia, stating that his &quot;time as a student there was very bad&quot;. In the early 1980s, Holmes agreed to help plan the university&#x27;s bicentennial celebration and became the first African-American to be on the university&#x27;s board of trustees.
The Atlanta native has several landmarks named in his honor including the Hamilton E. Holmes Elementary School in East Point, Georgia; Hamilton E. Holmes Drive (Highway 280) in Fulton County, Georgia, Hamilton Holmes Middle School in King William, Virginia; and the H.E. Holmes MARTA station in Atlanta. The first endowed professorship at the University of Georgia named for an African-American was created in his name on 11 November 1999. The University of Georgia Academic Building is named for him as well, along with Charlayne Hunter-Gault, as it is called the Holmes/Hunter Academic Building, as of 2001. Also in 2012, Emory University has dedicated a new dorm in his honor, called Hamilton Holmes Hall. The Emory University School of Medicine hosts an annual memorial lecture series in his name honoring diversity in medicine.

<text>Priest Anthony Holmes (born October 7, 1973) is an American former professional football running back who played 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He started his career with the Baltimore Ravens but experienced breakout success after signing with the Kansas City Chiefs as a free agent in 2001. During his seven-year stint with the Chiefs, Holmes was a three-time All-Pro, three-time Pro Bowl selection and was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year in 2002. Prior to playing for the Chiefs, Holmes earned a Super Bowl ring with the Ravens, who&#x27;d signed him as an undrafted free agent in 1997, in their 2000 Super Bowl XXXV victory over the New York Giants, but was the backup to Jamal Lewis at the time. He rushed for just over 2,000 yards in four seasons in Baltimore. Holmes sat out the 2006 season with a neck injury, and after a brief comeback attempt in 2007, he retired from the NFL.

Holmes played college football for the University of Texas at Austin. He was inducted into the University of Texas Hall of Honor and the Texas High School Sports Hall of Fame in 2007. He was inducted into the Kansas City Chiefs Hall of Fame in 2014.

==Early life==
Holmes was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Although he carries the last name of his biological father, he never met the man, only seeing him for the first time at his funeral. He was raised in San Antonio, Texas by his mother Norma, and stepfather Herman Morris. Holmes was raised in a military household as his stepfather was an aircraft technician at Kelly Air Force Base for 20 years. When he was 13, Holmes spent a summer in Detroit, Michigan, working for his grandfather&#x27;s lawn care service. Working with much older men for 12 hours a day, six days a week, Holmes learned the work ethic that later shaped him as a football player.

==School career==

===High school===
Holmes, who had idolized Dallas Cowboys&#x27; running back Tony Dorsett growing up, developed his own elusive running style while playing street football with the children in his neighborhood. Holmes later attended John Marshall High School, where he became a starter for head coach David Visentine. As a senior in 1991, Holmes rushed for 2,061 yards, and led his team to a runner-up finish in the state championship game, losing to Odessa Permian.

===College===
Holmes attended the University of Texas at Austin from 1992 to 1996, playing the entire time for John Mackovic. He played in the final seven games of his freshman season, Mackovic&#x27;s first as head coach, rushing for 114 yards against Houston. After starting two games and averaging over five yards per carry for the second straight season as a sophomore, Holmes received more significant playing time as a junior. He rushed for 524 yards and five touchdowns, and was named MVP of the 1994 Sun Bowl after rushing for 161 yards and four touchdowns in a win against North Carolina. Holmes missed the 1995 season with a knee injury, allowing for the emergence of future Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams as the starter. Relegated to third string behind Williams and Shon Mitchell, Holmes scored 13 touchdowns despite carrying the ball only 59 times. Holmes&#x27;s biggest moment came in the inaugural Big 12 Championship Game. Entering the game with a 7–4 record against third-ranked Nebraska, Texas upset the Cornhuskers 37–27, with Holmes rushing for 120 yards and three touchdowns. In Holmes&#x27; final two seasons, Texas posted a record of 16–9, finishing ranked in the top 25 each season. He rushed for a career total of 1,276 yards and 20 touchdowns, averaging 5.1 yards per carry. During college, Holmes began going by his first name, Priest. He had previously used his middle name, Anthony.

==Professional career==
===Baltimore Ravens===
After graduating from college, he joined Baltimore Ravens as an undrafted free agent in 1997. Holmes spent his entire rookie season as the Baltimore Ravens&#x27; fourth-string running back, behind Bam Morris, Earnest Byner, and Jay Graham. On September 24, 1997, Holmes made his professional regular season debut as part of the special teams unit during a 38–10 victory at the Tennessee Oilers in Week 4. He appeared in seven games as a rookie in 1997.

During training camp in 1998, Holmes competed to be the starting running back after the departures of Bam Morris and Earnest Byner. Head coach Ted Marchibroda named Holmes the third running back on the depth chart to begin the regular season, behind Errict Rhett and Jay Graham.

In the 1998 season with the Ravens, Holmes rushed for over 1,000 yards (leading the team in rushing) including one 200-plus yard game, the highest single game total of the season. In the 1999 season, he appeared in nine games and started four. He finished with 89 carries for 506 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown to go along with 13 receptions for 104 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.

In the 2000 season, he was supplanted as a starter by rookie running back Jamal Lewis. The Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV with Holmes as their second string halfback.

===Kansas City Chiefs===
In 2001, Holmes signed an inexpensive contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. In his first season with the Chiefs, he exceeded expectations by leading the NFL in rushing with 1,555 yards for the 2001 NFL season, becoming the first undrafted player to do so. (Arian Foster was next to accomplish the feat during the 2010 NFL season.)

Despite missing the final two games in the 2002 NFL season because of a hip injury, Holmes rushed for 1,615 yards with 21 touchdowns. In the 2003 NFL season, he broke Marshall Faulk&#x27;s NFL record for total touchdowns in a season with 27, which was subsequently broken by Shaun Alexander with 28 total touchdowns in 2005 and broken again by LaDainian Tomlinson with 31 total touchdowns in 2006. Holmes and Emmitt Smith are the only two running backs in NFL history to have back to back seasons with 20 or more rushing touchdowns. On a pace to repeat the feat in 2004, he suffered an injury that ended his season with 14 touchdowns.

Holmes&#x27;s 2005 season was also cut short by an injury to his spinal column from a tackle by Shawne Merriman on October 30, 2005. He was replaced for the season by backup Larry Johnson. During the following off-season, new head coach Herm Edwards promoted Johnson to the starting position. Holmes&#x27;s spinal injury did not heal by the end of the 2006 pre-season, and he was placed on the Chiefs&#x27; Physically Unable to Perform list for the season. Larry Johnson took over full-time as the Chiefs&#x27; starting running back.
Throughout the 2006 season, Holmes repeatedly said that he would like to return for at least two or three more seasons in the NFL, but that he would not force a comeback if it could be detrimental to his long-term health.

Following encouraging medical tests, Holmes reported to the Chiefs&#x27; training camp in July 2007. However, the Chiefs did not include him on the roster at the start of the season, listing him on the non-football injury list instead. Michael Bennett was traded at mid-season, and Holmes returned to the Kansas City roster, beginning practice on October 17, 2007. Holmes then completed the comeback four days later, playing in the Chiefs regular season game against the Oakland Raiders, carrying the ball four times. He made his first start since October 30, 2005, against the San Diego Chargers and played in a home game on November 11, 2007, in a 27–11 loss to the Denver Broncos. Holmes led the 
Chiefs with 20 rushes for 65 yards.

===Retirement===
Holmes announced his retirement on November 21, 2007, after re-injuring his neck on the previous Sunday, November 18, in a game against the Indianapolis Colts.

===Legacy===
Holmes retired as the Chiefs&#x27; all-time leader for career rushing touchdowns (76), total touchdowns (83), and career rushing yards (6,070). His rushing yards record has since been broken by Jamaal Charles. The team inducted Holmes into the Chiefs Hall of Fame during the 2014 season. The induction ceremony took place on November 2 at halftime of a game against the New York Jets.

Holmes has been a nominee for the Pro Football Hall of Fame nine times as of 2023, but has never advanced to a semi-finalist.

<doc id="676260" wikidata="Q435068" url="?curid=676260" title="Alain Mimoun">
<text>Alain Mimoun, born Ali Mimoun Ould Kacha (1 January 1921 – 27 June 2013), was a French long-distance runner who competed in track events, cross-country running and the marathon. He was the 1956 Olympic champion in the marathon. He is the most bemedalled French athletics sportsperson in history. In 1999, readers of the French athletics magazine &quot;Athlétisme Magazine&quot; voted him as the “French Athlete of the 20th Century”.

On the track Mimoun won three Olympic silver medals, finishing second behind Emil Zátopek in the 10,000 metres final in 1948 and again second behind him in both the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres finals in 1952. He was also the silver medallist in both events behind Zátopek at the 1950 European Athletics Championships. From 1949 to 1958, he won four individual gold medals and two individual silver medals at the International Cross Country Championships. He was a four-time gold medallist at the Mediterranean Games, completing the 5,000 m/10,000 m double in both 1951 and 1955.

Born in Algeria, Mimoun fought military battles for France and the Western Allies during World War II. He settled in metropolitan France shortly after leaving the French army. Overall, he represented France in four consecutive 
Olympic Games from 1948 to 1960. He competed internationally for France on 86 occasions. From 1947 to 1966, he won a total of 29 senior titles in the 5,000 m, 10,000 m, marathon and cross-country events of the French national championships. Mimoun continued to run in his later life and set a number of veteran age-category records.

==Early life==
Alain Mimoun was born Ali Mimoun Ould Kacha in the arrondissement of Maïder in the town of Telagh, Algeria, into a very poor, Arab-Berber family. Ali was the oldest of seven children in the family and his parents were peasants. His mother, Halima, also wove blankets for a living. He had always been a model pupil in primary school. When he was eleven, he finished his primary school education and obtained a certificate with &quot;mention bien&quot;. In view of his good academic results, his illiterate mother wanted him to become a primary school teacher. She applied for a scholarship for Ali after being told to do so by some colonists who had come to visit her. Ali was denied the scholarship—it was the only application rejected by the school—that could have enabled him to further his studies. He noted that sons of colonists with worse grades than he obtained their scholarships. When Ali learned of his scholarship rejection, he told his mother that Algeria was not his country and that his country was on the other side of the Mediterranean, even though he was against colonization. He said that as a teenager, he would dream that he was in front of maps and show France to his mother. Ali first worked as a mason, and then in a hardware shop when he was fourteen. He said that hardware shop owner was a Frenchman who came from France, was an admirable man who treated him like his son and with whom he would eat on the same table. Ali started to play association football when he was twelve and practice cycling when he was fifteen.

==World War II and early running career==
Mimoun enlisted in the French Army in 1939 when he was about 18 years old. In the same year, he was posted to the 19th infantry regiment. In September 1939, he was mobilised to the Franco-Belgian border. He spent nine months there in anticipation of the German offensive campaign – the Battle of Belgium. He engaged in combat at the Franco-Belgian border. After the fall of Belgium to the Germans in May 1940, his regiment retreated south into northern France, where he avoided being captured by the German army near Valenciennes. After France was defeated by the Germans in June 1940, Mimoun was posted to Bourg-en-Bresse in the Free Zone of Vichy France. When he was there, he discovered almost by accident a talent for long-distance running. He said that he joined in a race as he was passing a suburban track with some friends. While he was in Bourg-en-Bresse, he would train regularly in a stadium next to the military barracks. One day, he competed in some local racing events without any preparations. He won his first running event, the 1,500-metre Ain departmental championship, in front of 4,000 spectators. In that event, he beat the defending champion, thus ending his six-year reign as champion. He then finished a 5,000-meter race in under sixteen minutes. This prompted a local journalist to write, &quot;A marathoner is born. He could become an Olympic champion.&quot; In 1942, Mimoun was posted to a regiment of combat engineers based in Besançon. Later that year, he was transferred to Algeria, where he won numerous races on track and in cross country, including the 1942 North African cross country running championship title.

Mimoun&#x27;s running career was interrupted when he was called up to fight for the Western Allies in the Tunisia Campaign and then in the Italian Campaign. In the Tunisia Campaign, he fought under the command of General Henri Giraud against the Afrika Korps. In July 1943, he was sent to fight in the Italian Campaign, where he was a lance corporal in the 83rd combat engineers battalion of the Algerian 3rd infantry division of the French Expeditionary Corps commanded by Marshal Alphonse Juin. On 28 January 1944, during the Battle of Monte Cassino, Mimoun was seriously injured by fragmentation in his left leg originating from shells fired by the Germans. American doctors working in the field hospital recommended its amputation. Determined not to lose his leg, he refused. Fortunately, a French surgeon there managed to successfully perform an operation and his left leg was saved. He was later sent to a Naples hospital for convalescence. He recovered sufficiently to the extent that he could still engage in military combat in the last part of World War II. In the summer of 1944, Lance Corporal Mimoun participated in the Allied invasion of France from the Mediterranean Sea. After that campaign, he was involved in the liberation of the Jura Mountains from the German troops. He spent the winter of 1944–1945 in the Vosges Mountains before taking part in the Western Allied invasion of Germany. He spent about one year in Germany.

After his stint in the army in Europe had ended, Mimoun returned to Algeria where he continued to participate in running events. He was demobilised in 1946 while he was in Algiers. Upon leaving the French Army after seven years of service, he moved from Algeria to Paris. There, he signed up with the Racing Club de France, a famous sports club, and began calling himself Alain. The club arranged for him to work as a waiter in the café-bar of its facilities, which were then located in the Bois de Boulogne, and Mimoun would train in that park. In October 2002 and March 2012, Mimoun spoke of his difficult return to civilian life, &quot;I was a café waiter. I did not have enough to eat. I won four Olympic medals while I was living in a small, two-room apartment (in the 19th arrondissement of Paris) without heating, shower and toilet.&quot;
 Mimoun caused a major surprise by finishing second in the 1946 French national championships 10,000-meter race, despite having lost a shoe during the race. He made his international debut the following year when he represented France in an athletics meeting against Czechoslovakia in Prague. He established himself at national level in 1947 when he clinched his first French national championships titles, taking a track double in the 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres races.

==Running career from 1948 onwards ==
===Before the 1956 Olympic Games===
Mimoun rose to international prominence at the 1948 Summer Olympics. He was the runner-up in the 10,000 m final held at the Wembley Stadium on 31 July, behind the Czechoslovak runner Emil Zátopek. Zátopek was dominant and lapped all competitors bar Mimoun and bronze medallist Bertil Albertsson. Mimoun finished 47.8 seconds and more than 300 meters behind Zátopek. Mimoun also ran in the 5,000 m event of the 1948 Summer Olympics but did not progress to the final round. The following year he won the 5,000 m and 10,000 m French national championships titles and won his first major race at the International Cross Country Championships in Dublin, finishing ahead of compatriot Raphaël Pujazon in the individual event. He also led France to the team title.

He claimed cross country and 10,000 m French national championships titles in 1950, but on the international stage he was again second best to Zátopek, taking the silver medals in the 5,000 m and 10,000 m events at the 1950 European Athletics Championships. At the 1950 International Cross Country Championships he was runner-up to Belgium&#x27;s Lucien Theys in the individual race, but retained the team title with France. He won the 5,000 m and 10,000 m gold medals
at the 1951 Mediterranean Games and swept the French national championships 5,000 m, 10,000 m and cross country titles in both 1951 and 1952.

Mimoun topped the podium for the individual and team events at the International Cross Country Championships in March 1952. The 1952 Helsinki Olympics saw by now a familiar sight: Zátopek claimed victory in the 5,000 m and 10,000 m races and Mimoun was the silver medallist in both. In the 10,000 m final Mimoun finished 15.8 seconds behind Zátopek, but 15.4 seconds ahead of the bronze medallist Aleksandr Anufriyev. In the 5,000 m final, Mimoun, Herbert Schade and Christopher Chataway were in the lead entering the final bend of the last lap, with Zátopek in fourth place. Zátopek then made his move, and he took the lead halfway through the final bend and never relinquished it. Zátopek finished the 5,000 m race 4.5m and 0.8 second ahead of Mimoun, with the latter improving his personal best by over 14 seconds. His second-place finishes behind the Czechoslovak champion gave Mimoun the nickname &quot;Zátopek&#x27;s Shadow&quot;.

Away from Zátopek, Mimoun continued to dominate the French scene and claimed a third individual title at the International Cross Country Championships in 1954, although a foot injury left him unable to compete at the 1954 European Athletics Championships later that year. His 1955 was highlighted by the successful defence of his 5,000m and 10,000m track titles at both the 1955 Mediterranean Games and the French national championships.

On 10 Oct 1955 in Algiers, Mimoun beat the French national record for the one hour run that had been held by Jean Bouin since 6 July 1913. On that day, Mimoun ran a distance of 19 km 78 metres, compared to the 19 km 21 metres (which then became a new world record) ran by Bouin on 6 July 1913 in Stockholm.

Mimoun began 1956 in strong form, capturing the French national championships 5,000m, 10,000m and cross country titles, and winning what would be his fourth and final individual title at the International Cross Country Championships.

===1956 Olympic Games===
Mimoun faltered in his first event at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, managing only twelfth place in the 10,000 m final – 1 minute and 32.4 seconds behind Soviet winner Vladimir Kuts.
Mimoun entered the Olympic marathon race that took place in sweltering heat – the temperature went up to 38 °C (100.4 °F) in the shade during the race – on Dec 1, 1956, with the defending champion Emil Zátopek in the starting line-up. He was certain that day would be his lucky day. Frenchmen had won the Olympic marathon in 1900 (Michel Théato), and 28 years later in 1928 (Boughera El Ouafi). Now, 28 years had passed since the last French victory in 1928. One month ago, he had gone on a pilgrimage to the Basilica of St. Thérèse in Lisieux, France. The day before the marathon, Mimoun received a telegram from his wife, Germaine, back in France telling him of the birth of their first child, a daughter called Olympe. Besides, Mimoun was wearing on his blue, French flag-bearing, running singlet what he considered to be the lucky number – number 13. The 1.70 m tall, 56 kg heavy Frenchman had never raced over the distance before but he excelled on his first attempt. The marathon started at 15:13 inside the Melbourne Cricket Ground. It had forty-six competitors representing twenty-three nations. The marathon had a false start, which was the first in Olympic history. The mustachioed Mimoun had a white bandana, embroidered with his wife&#x27;s initials, tied around the top of his head since the start of the race to protect himself from the sun&#x27;s rays. A group of thirteen runners was leading the race after fifteen kilometers. At the twenty-kilometer mark, only five of them remained in that group. The American John J. Kelley patted Mimoun&#x27;s back to urge him to take the lead together with him. The two of them then broke away from the leading group of runners, with Kelley briefly ahead of Mimoun. Mimoun surged forward in the uphill section of the course near the top of the hill, ran past Kelley and was solely in the lead before the halfway point of the marathon. By the 25-km mark he had opened a 50-second lead, and henceforth, no competitor came close to him again. In the last quarter of the race, Mimoun removed his white bandana from his head and threw it onto the road surface, because according to him, it &quot;felt like a ton&quot;. 5 km from the finish line, he no longer took the cups of water on tables lining the course as he pulled further away from his fellow runners. Mimoun crossed the finish line in a time of 2:25:00, 1 minute and 32 seconds ahead of the runner-up Franjo Mihalić, in front of 110,000 spectators at the Melbourne Cricket Ground and before any other runner had entered the stadium. For the third time in a row, the Olympic marathon had been won by an athlete competing in his first marathon. It was the first time Mimoun had ever beaten Emil Zátopek in a running event. Mimoun had expected to see his great rival and close friend Zátopek finish second behind him. He waited at the finish line for the Czechoslovak runner to arrive. Zátopek, who had undergone hernia surgery six weeks earlier, crossed the finishing line in sixth place, four minutes and thirty-four seconds after Mimoun. Grabbing Zátopek&#x27;s shoulder, Mimoun asked, &quot;Emil, why don&#x27;t you congratulate me? I am an Olympic champion. It was I who won.&quot; Zátopek, who was then a colonel in the Czechoslovak army, stood to attention, took off his white cap and saluted Mimoun. Zátopek then kissed and embraced Mimoun, saying, &quot;You did great, Alain.&quot; In a later interview with Sports Illustrated, Mimoun said, &quot;For me, that was better than the medal&quot;. That was the last time Mimoun raced against Zátopek.

 &quot;When I entered the stadium&#x27;s tunnel and came out onto the track, cheered by 100,000 spectators, I experienced the finest minutes of my life,&quot; Mimoun said later.

On his return home from Melbourne, there was a crowd of 15,000 people, a hero&#x27;s welcome and a red carpet awaiting Mimoun at Paris&#x27; Orly Airport. At the airport, he did not get a chance to walk on the red carpet as he was carried in triumph by the crowd. Thereafter, receptions were held in his honour for three months. The day after he arrived home from Melbourne, he returned to the regular job that he had been doing since 1946 – as a waiter in a café-bar at the Racing Club de France 

“I was sure Emil was there at my heels,” Mimoun told Sports Illustrated in 1972. “I was hoping he would be second. I was waiting for him. Then I thought, well, he would be third. It would be nice to stand on the podium with him again. But Emil came in sixth, oh, very tired. He seemed to be in a trance, staring straight ahead. He said nothing.&quot; Mimoun later told a biographer, Pat Butcher, that he had been well-prepared for racing the Melbourne Olympics marathon. &quot;I gorged myself on 40 km a day for two years, without telling a soul.&quot;
&quot;He would train three times a day, running a daily total distance of 35 km. It was certainly not for the 10,000-meter race, even though he had told me that he would not contest the marathon,&quot; said Mimoun&#x27;s wife, Germaine, during an interview in 2006 with AFP. Mimoun revealed that before leaving for Melbourne for the 1956 Olympics, he had done his final training in the Corrèze village of Bugeat, which resembled his native village in Algeria. In an interview conducted in October 2002, Mimoun said,&quot;When I announced that I was going to run the 1956 Melbourne Olympics marathon, everyone told me that I was too old. The French, the foreigners and everyone were laughing except Zátopek.&quot;

Reflecting on the four Olympic medals that he had won, Mimoun remarked, &quot;I compare my career to a castle: my London silver medal is the foundation; my two Helsinki silver medals are the walls; my gold medal in Melbourne is the roof.&quot;

Upon hearing the news of the death of Emil Zátopek in November 2000, he stated, &quot;I have not lost an opponent, I have lost a brother.&quot;

===After the 1956 Olympic Games===
Mimoun did not compete in 1957 but returned in 1958 with a runner-up finish behind Stan Eldon in the individual race at the International Cross Country Championships and his first national marathon title. He placed seventh in the 10,000-meter event at the 1958 European Athletics Championships. In 1959 he came sixth in the individual race at the International Cross Country Championships, and won national titles in the marathon and cross country. As he neared his forties, his athletic powers began to decline. Although he continued to compete, he did not win a national title on grass or the track after 1959. Four further outings from 1960 to 1964
at the International Cross Country Championships saw finishes in the individual event ranging from 18th to 26th place.

Mimoun made the French team for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome and placed 34th in the marathon. He won his final national championship title at the senior level – the marathon – in 1966, some twenty years after his debut. His career at the top of the national and international ranks finished at that point but he continued to be a presence as a veteran runner. At the age of 51, he completed a marathon in a time of 2:34:36.2. He set French age-category records for the 5,000 m, 10,000 m, 20,000 m and the one hour run. He won a total of more than 80 French national running championships titles, including those for veteran athletes, the last one while in his seventies. In the last years of his life, he continued to jog or racewalk almost daily, up to 10–15 miles per day, on the roads and paths in the vicinity of his detached house in Champigny-sur-Marne in Val-de-Marne department, at the Bois de Vincennes and on the roads around Bugeat in Corrèze department.

==Later life and legacy==
After Mimoun arrived back home from the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, he mooted the idea of creating a world-class sports training center in France. In order to take advantage of better training facilities, he had to train overseas, especially in Sweden, for some of his running events. That was something that annoyed him and therefore he felt that it was necessary to build such a sports training center. Mimoun attempted to seek government funding to build it. After several failed attempts in previous years, he received a telephone call from Jacques Chirac to meet him in the Hôtel Matignon. During that meeting in 1967, Chirac, who was then a senior civil servant working as Prime Minister Georges Pompidou&#x27;s technical adviser, told Mimoun, &quot;I have followed your entire (running) career and I like your idea of creating a (sports) training center in Corrèze.&quot; The following day, Mimoun was received by the Sports Minister François Missoffe in his office and informed by him that government funding for the sports training center had been approved. The sports training center – initially named &quot;Centre national d&#x27;entraînement sportif&quot; – located in the Corrèze village of Bugeat, was later renamed &quot;Espace 1000 Sources&quot;. Right after Mimoun&#x27;s funeral in July 2013, the sports training center was rechristened &quot;Centre sportif Alain Mimoun&quot; 

Mimoun worked as a waiter in a café-bar at the Racing Club de France and as a physical education instructor in France after the end of World War II.

When Mimoun settled in metropolitan France after the end of World War II, he first lived in Paris. Then, he moved to Champigny-sur-Marne. He and his wife, Germaine, bought a second home in Bugeat and he would go to live there each summer.

In 1997, Mimoun protested in the strongest terms against the decision of the Comité national olympique et sportif français (CNOSF) to remove the Gallic rooster from the jerseys of French athletes.

For his successful running career and wartime military services, Mimoun received four Legion of Honour awards during his lifetime from four different presidents of France: Chevalier (1956), Officier (1972), Commandeur (1999) and Grand Officier(2008). He also received the Sporting Order of Merit (&quot;Ordre du Mérite sportif&quot;), &quot;Gloire du sport&quot;, and the National Order of Merit. He is the first French person of North African origin to receive the Legion of Honour.
Mimoun was chosen as the French L&#x27;Équipe Champion of Champions in 1949 and again in 1956.

In 1999, readers of the bimonthly, French athletics magazine Athlétisme voted him as the “French Athlete of the 20th Century”.

On 25 Sep 2002 in Argenteuil, Mimoun inaugurated the 50th stadium bearing his name.

In December 2012, L&#x27;Equipe presented him its first &quot;trophée de champion des champions de légende&quot;.

At the time of Mimoun&#x27;s death, more than a hundred and fifty stadia, schools and streets bore his name. More than 50 municipal athletics stadia in France were named Stade Alain Mimoun and more than a dozen streets in France were named after him.

==Family and personal life==
Mimoun&#x27;s wife, Germaine, was born in Tulle, capital of the Corrèze département in the Limousin region in central France. She died in May 2013. Their first child, a daughter named Olympe, was born on 30 November 1956, one day before Mimoun won the 1956 Olympics marathon in Melbourne. They have another daughter, Pascale.

Mimoun converted from Islam to Roman Catholicism in 1955. Several months before the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, he had deep doubts about his ability to participate in those Olympics. In desperation, he let himself be driven by an atheist friend to the Basilica of St. Thérèse in Lisieux. One month after his pilgrimage there, he won the 1956 Olympics marathon. Mimoun asserted that he owed that marathon win to Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. After that victory, he became very attached to Saint Thérèse of Lisieux. He would go to the Basilica of St. Thérèse in Lisieux every year on a pilgrimage, usually on 1 October – the feast day of the saint. Prior to his death, he had a chapel constructed in the Bugeat cemetery to serve as his final resting place.

==Death, tributes and funeral==
Alain Mimoun died at the age of 92 in the evening of 27 June 2013 at the Hôpital d&#x27;instruction des armées Bégin in Saint-Mandé, in the departement of Val-de-Marne in the Île-de-France region. The cause of death was not disclosed.

In a communiqué made public by the Élysée Palace French President François Hollande wrote that Alain Mimoun was &quot;a magnificent Frenchman&quot; and &quot;left a deep mark on the history of French sport&quot;. &quot;Throughout his life, Alain Mimoun, who was born in Algeria, loved and served France. And he was very attached to his department of Corrèze,&quot; emphasized Hollande, who also has ties to the area.

French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault emphasized Mimoun&#x27;s “exceptional victory” at the 1956 Olympics marathon and called him “a great servant of France who etched his name in the pantheon of French sport”. Ayrault concluded that “the death of Mimoun left France without one of her finest figures”.

The French minister of sports, Valérie Fourneyron, hailed Mimoun as &quot;one of the most endearing and loved figures of French sport&quot;. &quot;All French people will remember him as the most medalled French athletics sportsperson of all time, above all as
a model of uprightness and kindness,&quot; added Fourneyron.

Michel Jazy, a French Olympic runner who shared a room with Mimoun for six weeks during the 1956 Olympics, remembered seeing him show the intensity and professionalism in order to succeed at the Olympics. &quot;Alain was a role model for me. He would wake me up at 5:30 in the morning to go and run, and in the evening he would force me to go to bed at 8:30. Even though we were at the Olympics Games, I could not go to the parties in the Olympic village!&quot; Jazy told RTL radio on the day after Mimoun&#x27;s death.

The Comité national olympique et sportif français (CNOSF) described Mimoun as someone who &quot;embodied selflessness and panache&quot;, &quot;was devoted to the humanist values of sport&quot; and &quot;who would forever be among the sportspersons who had given French sport its finest hours&quot;.
On 6 July 2013, a minute&#x27;s silence in honour of Mimoun&#x27;s memory was held in front of 50,000 spectators during the 2013 edition of the Meeting Areva – an annual track and field event – that took place at the Stade de France.

Mimoun was accorded a state funeral will military honors. It was held on Monday, 8 July 2013 at 10am local time, in the main courtyard of the Hôtel national des Invalides in Paris. French President François Hollande presided over the ceremony, during which he paid homage to Mimoun. Retired French athletes like Stéphane Diagana, Michel Jazy and Marie-José Pérec attended the ceremony. In his eulogy, Hollande said,&quot;Today, it is all of France which is paying homage to Alain Mimoun, to the one who ran throughout his life on the tracks of stadiums in order to make the La Marseillaise resound, seeking glory for his country everywhere.&quot; Hollande described Mimoun as &quot;a courageous soldier, an exceptional sportsman and a fervent patriot&quot; who was &quot;loved by France&quot; and stated, &quot;To Alain Mimoun, France was a choice, a passion, a pride and an ideal.&quot;

In the afternoon of 9 July 2013, Mimoun was buried in the cemetery in Bugeat after a religious ceremony in the Bugeat church. The funeral was attended by about sixty persons.

<text>An anti-copyright notice is a specific statement that is added to a work in order to encourage wide distribution. Such notices are legally required to host such specific media; under the Berne Convention in international copyright law, works are protected even if no copyright statement is attached to them. However, &quot;anti-copyright&quot; statements typically do not take the form of either sophisticated public copyright licenses or a simple dedication to the public domain; instead, they usually just encourage wide distribution. Depending on jurisdiction, it is possible to denounce all claims to copyright in a work including moral rights in a written disclaimer.

An example of an anti-copyright notice is the following: &quot;Anti-Copyright! Reprint freely, in &quot;any&quot; manner desired, even without naming the source.&quot; Where such notices are attached depends highly on the type of work. They are often found in anarcho-socialist magazines and books.

An example of a copyright waiver is the following:

The Creative Commons CC0 was created for compatibility with also law domains (e.g. civil law of continental Europe) which have problems with the concept of &quot;dedicating into public domain&quot;, as waiver statement with a fallback all-permissive license. The WTFPL, first published in 2000, differs from licenses with public domain designations in that an author can use it even if they do not necessarily have the ability to place their work in the public domain according to their local laws. The Unlicense, published around 2010, has a focus on an anti-copyright message.

Woody Guthrie used an anti-copyright notice on his songs:

This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright # 154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don&#x27;t give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that&#x27;s all we wanted to do.

Despite this, a number of organisations claim copyright of Guthrie&#x27;s songs.

Most people would regard &quot;anti-copyright&quot; notices as being equivalent to a dedication of material into the public domain (as in the second example above). Some of these disclaimers, however, are less accurate and need to be interpreted individually as the term anti-copyright has no accepted legal meaning. For example, if just free distribution is encouraged, modification or lack of attribution is still illegal, making the material ineligible for collaborative writing projects like English Wikipedia. In such a case anti-copyright is not a true denial of copyright, but just a modification of the protection it affords copyright holders.

<doc id="676277" wikidata="Q93665" url="?curid=676277" title="Belinus">
<text>Belinus was a legendary king of the Britons, as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He was the son of Dunvallo Molmutius and brother of Brennius and came to power in 390 BC. He was probably named after the ancient god Belenus.

== Earning the crown ==
In an effort to win the crown of Britain, Brennius and Belinus waged war between each other to determine who should succeed their father. Many battles were fought between the two brothers until a time came when their friends intervened and a compromise was decided upon. Belinus became the King of the Britons with Brennius as king of the north.

Five years later, Brennius wed the daughter of the King of Norway without consulting Belinus. Belinus invaded Northumbria and seized Brennius&#x27;s land. The King of Denmark was in love with Brennius&#x27;s new wife and had pursued him and captured her ship. A storm drove the Danish king to land in Britain by accident. Belinus imprisoned them and awaited the return of his brother. Brennius landed in Albany and demanded the return of all his lands and his wife. If not, he swore he would kill Belinus if they ever met in battle.

Belinus called to arms all of Britain against Brennius and the two armies met in the forests of Calaterium. The battle was fought ruthlessly and Belinus defeated the army of Brennius. Brennius fled to Gaul and Belinus became king over all the Britons. He emphasized the Molmutine Laws of his father and ruled justly.

Eventually, Brennius invaded Britain behind a massive Gallic army and met Belinus on the battlefield once again. Their mother, however, convinced Brennius to make peace, and the two brothers ruled their two realms in harmony with each other.

== Invader of Gaul, Italy and Germany ==

Following their unification, Belinus and Brennius merged their armies into one great one and invaded Gaul. According to the story, after a year of warfare, the joint army managed to submit all the Frankish kingdoms in Gaul to their authority. Now with an even greater army, Belinus led his great army to the Italian peninsula and threatened to invade Rome. Outside Rome the two consuls, Gabias and Porsenna, sued for peace and offered wealth, tribute, and hostages as a sign of their submission. Belinus and Brennius accepted and took their great army to Germany. Soon after this movement north, Rome broke the treaty and marched north and Brennius went to fight the Romans while Belinus remained at war with the Germans (who were being helped by various other Italian troops).

After Brennius had left, the Italian troops who were reinforcing the Germans abandoned the Germans in a vain attempt to unite with the Roman soldiers on the other side of Belinus&#x27;s army. Belinus learned of this and moved his army to a valley through which the Italians had to pass. In the morning, Belinus attacked the Italians, who were not in armour and were unprepared for battle at that point in time. All day the Britons pursued the Italians until it was night.

Belinus decided to join forces with his brother, who was besieging Rome. The Romans defended the city for many days and were successful in repelling the invaders. At last, Belinus decided to hang the hostages they were given in the treaty, but it only enraged the Romans more. Finally, the two consuls put on armour and joined the men defending the city. They pushed the invaders back but Belinus was able to reform the lines and stop the attacks. Belinus continued forward until the walls were breached and the Britons invaded the city. Belinus left Brennius in Rome and returned to Britain.

== Later years ==
He ruled in peace, building many new cities and restoring many decaying ones. Most important of the cities he founded was Kaerusc, which would be renamed Caerleon or the City of Legions when the Romans occupied Britain. (This was the first reference to Caerleon-upon-Usk in Geoffrey&#x27;s history.) Belinus continued using many of his father&#x27;s laws and enacted a number of his own. Britain became more wealthy than ever before in this time.

When Belinus finally died, he was cremated and placed on top of a great tower he had created; he was succeeded by his son Gurguit Barbtruc.

==Comments on historicity==
Rome was indeed captured by one Brennus following the Battle of the Allia on 18 July 390 BC. Gabias and Porsenna are not mentioned in any Roman sources. The latter is a namesake of Lars Porsena, a King of the Etruscans who is believed to have fought against the recently founded Roman Republic around 500 BC.

<doc id="676289" wikidata="Q4776928" url="?curid=676289" title="Antonio Rodríguez Balinas">
<text>Brigadier General Antonio Rodríguez Balinas (February 28, 1928 – September 21, 2011) was the first commander of the Office of the First U.S. Army Deputy Command.

==Early years==
Rodríguez Balinas was born and raised in the town of Adjuntas, Puerto Rico, where he received his primary and secondary education.

He joined the United States Army upon graduating from the University of Puerto Rico, where he earned is Bachelor of Arts degree in Economics and a Doctorate in Law from University of Puerto Rico School of Law. Rodríguez Balinas entered the Officer Candidate School program and was commissioned a second lieutenant upon completing the program. At the outbreak of the Korean War, he was assigned to the 65th Infantry Regiment.

==Korean War==
On April 23, 1951, Rodríguez Balinas, who was assigned to &quot;F&quot; Co., of the 65th Infantry, 3rd Infantry Division, defended the left flank of his company from constant enemy attacks at Ognyo-Bong, Hill 305 at a great risk to his life. He was awarded the Silver Star Medal and promoted to the rank of first lieutenant for his bravery. On December 23, 1951, he fearlessly walked through a lethal hail of enemy fire directly toward the hostile bunker of the enemy, hurled his hand grenades and singlehandedly completely destroyed the enemy position and its occupants near Sorgyon-Myon, Korea. For his actions he was awarded his second Silver Star and a Purple Heart.

==Later career==

Rodríguez Balinas continued his academic education and earned a PhD degree in Law from the UPR. In March 1968, the reserve units in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands of the United States Army were organized into the 166th Support Group. On July 14, 1973, the then-Colonel Rodríguez Balinas took command of the 166th Support Group and was given full command and control of all USAR (United States Army Reserve) units in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. One of Colonel Rodríguez Balinas&#x27;s accomplishments was to have all the missions and functions of a major U.S. Army Reserve Command under the First U.S. Army. He wanted full autonomy for the Army Reserve forces in Puerto Rico.

In February 1977, the USAR Forces in Puerto Rico became a General Office Command with the establishment of the Office of the First U.S. Army Deputy Command with Antonio Rodríguez Balinas, who was promoted to the rank of brigadier general, as its first General Officer. In 1979, the USAR Forces in Puerto Rico were awarded the Best Major U.S. Army Reserve Command Award. Brigadier General Rodríguez Balinas held the position of General Officer until February 27, 1988, when he retired after 37 years of active and reserve duty. He was awarded the Legion of Merit Medal upon his retirement.

In 2018 Antonio Rodríguez Balinas was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.

==Death==
He died on September 21, 2011, in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico, and was buried with military honors in the Puerto Rico National Cemetery located in the city of Bayamon.

==Military awards and decorations==
Among Rodríguez Balinas&#x27; decorations were the following:


Foreign decoration

The Bravery Gold Medal of Greece was given by the government of Greece to the 65th Infantry Regiment and to the members of the regiment who fought in the Korean War.
*  Chryssoun Aristion Andrias (Bravery Gold Medal of Greece)
Congressional Gold Medal

On June 10, 2014, President Barack Obama, signed the legislation known as &quot;The Borinqueneers CGM Bill&quot; at an official ceremony. The Bill honors the 65th Infantry Regiment with the Congressional Gold Medal.

<text>Luis Antonio Argüello (; June 21, 1784 – March 27, 1830) was the first Californio (native-born) governor of Alta California, and the first to take office under Mexican rule. He was the only governor to serve under the First Mexican Empire (of 1821–1823) and also served as acting governor under the subsequent provisional government, which preceded the First Mexican Republic (of 1824–1835).

== Biography ==
Argüello was born at Presidio of San Francisco (in present-day San Francisco), Alta California, to José Darío Argüello and Maria Ygnacia Moraga, members of one of the most distinguished and influential families in early California history. His father founded the Pueblo de Los Angeles, and served as Governor of Alta California and later of Baja California.

In August, 1806, Argüello succeeded his father as Commandant of California with the rank of lieutenant. In 1821, he launched an exploration of Northern California to investigate the rumors of &quot;Foreigners&quot; setting up a base. Argüello published his expedition diary, titled &quot;The Diary of Captain Arguello: The Last Spanish Expedition in California, October 17 - November 17, 1821&quot;. He ordered retribution on hunters of the Russian-American Company who were catching sea otters in San Francisco Bay. There were numerous sea otter populations to hunt and a lack of Spanish military posts above San Francisco Bay made it hard for Argüello to stop this northern activity and the possibility of them trading with the Spanish Missions.

His brother was Santiago Argüello, who was commandant of the Presidio of San Diego and &quot;alcalde&quot; (mayor) of Pueblo de San Diego. His sister Concepción Argüello (1791–1857) was noted for her romance with Nikolai Rezanov (1764–1807), a Russian promoter of the colonization of Alaska and California.
Argüello and his second wife Maria Soledad Ortega de Argüello inherited his parents Spanish Rancho land grant of 1795 named Rancho de las Pulgas, encompassing present day San Mateo, Belmont, San Carlos, Redwood City, Atherton, and Menlo Park. Though Luis never actually lived there, his widow and children settled there after his death.

Josefa Arguello was one of his daughters, she married Eulogio de Celis, their son Eulogio F. de Celis became a predominant landowner in the San Fernando Valley.

Luis Antonio Argüello died in Yerba Buena (San Francisco) in 1830, and is buried at the Mission San Francisco de Asís (Mission Dolores) cemetery.

==Governor==

In 1822, William Edward Petty Hartnell persuaded Argüello to grant him the right to do business in any port in Alta California, whereas other foreigners were restricted to Monterey and San Diego.

Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo was served as the personal secretary to the new Governor Luis Argüello, when news of Mexico&#x27;s independence reached Monterey. Argüello enrolled Vallejo as a cadet in the Presidio company in 1824. After being promoted to corporal, Argüello appointed Vallejo to the &quot;diputación&quot;, the territorial legislature. He was promoted to &quot;alférez&quot; (equal to a modern army second lieutenant).

In 1823, he granted Rancho Los Corralitos in present-day Santa Cruz County, California to José Amesti. &quot;Los Corralitos&quot; means &quot;the little corrals&quot; in Spanish. The grant extended along Corralitos Creek north of Watsonville, and encompassed present-day Corralitos and Amesti.

In 1823, Rancho Llano de Buena Vista, means &quot;Good View Plain&quot;. in the Salinas Valley was given by Argüello to José Mariano Estrada a lieutenant of the Mexican Artillery and in-law of Argüello.

In 1823, Argüello gave a land grant of Rancho San Pablo, in present-day Contra Costa County, California to Francisco María Castro (1775–1831), a former soldier at the San Francisco Presidio and one-time &quot;alcalde&quot; of the Pueblo of San José. The San Pablo grant covered what is now Richmond, San Pablo, and Kensington in western Contra Costa County.

In 1823, Argüello gave a land grant of Rancho Las Cienegas, at a size of in present-day Los Angeles County, California to Francisco Avila

Argüello was Governor at the time of the Chumash Revolt of 1824. Nearly a month after the initial revolt on February 21, 1824, a company of 100 Mexican soldiers, cavalrymen and priests, as well as a four-pound cannon, arrived at La Purisima Mission in the morning, intent on violently crushing the rebellion. Argüello, had had enough chaos in his country&#x27;s new territory, and so had given the orders for the Chumash rebellion to be quelled with bloodshed, if necessary.

In 1824, Rancho Bolsa de San Cayetano was a land granted in present-day Monterey County, California near Monterey Bay by Argüello to Ygnacio Ferrer Vallejo

Rancho Bolsa de San Cayetano was an 8,896-acre (36.00 km2) Mexican land grant in present-day Monterey County, California given in 1824 by Governor Luís Antonio Argüello to Ygnacio Ferrer Vallejo, and confirmed to his eldest son, José de Jesús Vallejo, by Governor José Figueroa in 1834.[1] The name means &quot;pocket of St. Cayetano&quot;. Pocket in this case usually refers to land surrounded by slough - in this case the Elkhorn Slough. The grant was bordered on the west by Monterey Bay.

Rancho Moro Cojo, that became part of Rancho Bolsa Nueva y Moro Cojo, in present-day Monterey County, California was granted by Governor Luís Antonio Argüello in 1825.

Antonio Maria Osio married Dolores Argüello, sister of Luis Antonio Argüello. In 1838, Osio settled in Monterey. In 1839, Governor Alvarado granted Osio, Angel Island (California), on the condition that Osio would set aside part of the island for a fort. However, Osio never took up residence there.

Francisco de Paula Marín a Spaniard who became influential in the early Kingdom of Hawaii, was a confidant of Hawaiian King Kamehameha I. Marín acted as a jack-of-all-trades, sometimes even acting as a physician, probably without any formal education, and is credited with introducing many agricultural products. Marín wrote to governor Luis Antonio Argüello about moving to Alta California, but was told his multiple wives would not be welcome in California.

In Argüello&#x27;s tenure one new mission was founded: Mission San Francisco Solano (California) on July 4, 1823, by Father Jose Altimira. This was the last of the 21 missions founded as the Mexican secularization act of 1833 put an end to the missions. Mission San Francisco Solano was also the northernmost mission and the only one started after Mexico gained independence from Spain. Argüello wanted a robust Mexican presence north of the San Francisco Bay to keep the Russians who had established Fort Ross on the Pacific coast from moving further inland and down the coast. General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo later closed the mission in 1834–1835, he took the roof titles for his own home, others joined in taking parts of the buildings and it turned to ruins, later being completely torn down. In need of a church for the town he made, in 1840 Vallejo had a small chapel built were the original parish church was.

==Legacy==
In World War II, the United States liberty ship SS &quot;Luis Argüello&quot; was named in his honor.

<doc id="676299" wikidata="Q1475103" url="?curid=676299" title="Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan">
<text>Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan (JIP), is a Pakistani Islamist political party. It is the Pakistani successor to Jamaat-e-Islami, which was founded in colonial India in 1941. JIP is a &quot;vanguard party&quot;, whose members are intended to be leaders spreading party beliefs and influence. Supporters not thought qualified to be members may become &quot;affiliates&quot;, and beneath them are &quot;sympathizers&quot;. The party leader is called an &quot;ameer&quot;. Although, it does not have a large popular following, the party is quite influential and considered one of the major Islamic movements in Pakistan, along with Deobandi and Barelvi (represented by Jamiat Ulema-e Islam political party and Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan party respectively).

Jamaat-e-Islami was founded in Islamia Park, Lahore, British India in 1941 by the Muslim theologian and socio-political philosopher, Abul Ala Maududi, who was widely influenced by the Sharia based reign of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. At the time of the Indian independence movement, Maududi and the Jamaat-e-Islami actively worked to oppose the partition of India. In 1947, following the partition of India, the Jamaat split into two organisations, Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan and Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (the Indian wing). Other wings of Jamaat include Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir, founded in 1953, Jamaat-e-Islami Azad Kashmir founded in 1974, and Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, founded in 1975.

Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan came under severe government repression in 1948, 1953, and 1963. During the early years of the regime of General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Jamaat-e-Islami&#x27;s position improved and it became seen as the &quot;regime&#x27;s ideological and political arm&quot;, with party members at times holding cabinet portfolios of information and broadcasting, production, and water, power and natural resources. 
In 1971, during the Bangladesh Liberation War, JIP opposed the independence of Bangladesh. However, in 1975, it established Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh with Abbas Ali Khan as the first ameer. Since the early 1980s, it has also developed close links with Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir and acted as the vanguard of the armed insurgency in that province.

==History==
===Syed Abul A&#x27;la Maududi (1941–1972)===
Jamaat-e-Islami&#x27;s founder and leader until 1972 was Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, a widely read Islamist philosopher and political commentator, who wrote about the role of Islam in South Asia. His thought was influenced by many factors including the Khilafat Movement; Mustafa Kemal Atatürk&#x27;s ascension at the end of the Ottoman Caliphate; and the impact of Indian Nationalism, the Indian National Congress and Hinduism on Muslims in India. He supported what he called &quot;Islamization from above&quot;, through an Islamic state in which sovereignty would be exercised in the name of Allah and Islamic law (&quot;sharia&quot;) would be implemented. Maududi believed politics was &quot;an integral, inseparable part of the Islamic faith, and that the Islamic state that Muslim political action seeks to build&quot; would not only be an act of piety but would also solve the many (seemingly non-religious) social and economic problems that Muslims faced.

Maududi opposed British rule but also opposed the Muslim nationalist movement (nationalism being un-Islamic) and their plan for a circumscribed &quot;Muslim state&quot;. Maududi agitating instead for an &quot;Islamic state&quot; covering the whole of India – this despite the fact, Muslims made up only about one quarter of India&#x27;s population.

Jamaat-e-Islami thus actively opposed the partition of India, with its leader Maulana Abul A&#x27;la Maududi arguing that concept violated the Islamic doctrine of the ummah. The Jamaat-e-Islami saw the partition as creating a temporal border that would divide Muslims from one another.

===Founding of JIP in colonial India===

Jamaat-e-Islami was founded in colonial India on August 26, 1941 at Islamia Park in the city of Lahore, before the Partition of India. JIP began as an Islamist social and political movement. Seventy-five people attended the first meeting and became the first members of the movement. Maulana Amin Ahsan Islahi, Maulana Naeem Siddiqui, Maulana Muhammad Manzoor Naumanai and Maulana Abul Hasan Ali Hasani Nadwi (although he left after a few years) were among the founders of Jamaat-e-Islami along with Syed Abul Ala Maududi.

Maududi saw his group as a vanguard of Islamic revolution following the footsteps of early Muslims who gathered in Medina to found an Islamic state. JIP was and is strictly and hierarchically organised in a pyramid-like structure, working toward the common goal of establishing an ideological Islamic society, particularly though educational and social work, under the leadership of its emirs (commanders or leaders). As a vanguard party, its fully-fledged members (&quot;arkan&quot;) are intended to be leaders and devoted to the party, but there is also a category of much more numerous sympathizers and workers (&quot;karkun&quot;).

The emir is obliged by the party constitution to consult an assembly called the &quot;shura&quot;. The JIP also developed sub-organisations, such as those for women and students. JIP began by volunteering in refugee camps; performing social work; opening hospitals and medical clinics and by gathering the skins of animals sacrificed for Eid-ul-Azha.

JIP had a number of unique features. All members, including its founder Mawdudi, uttered the shahadah – the traditional act of converts to Islam – when they joined. This was a symbolic gesture of conversion to a new Islamic perspective, but to some implied that &quot;the Jamaat stood before Muslim society as Islam before jahiliyah&quot;, (pre-Islamic ignorance). After Pakistan was formed, it forbade Pakistanis to take an oath of allegiance to the state until it became Islamic, arguing that a Muslim could in clear conscience render allegiance only to God.

;Creation and early years
Following the Partition of India, Maududi and JIP migrated from East Punjab to Lahore in Pakistan. There they volunteered to help the thousands of refugees pouring into the country from India – performing social work; opening hospitals and medical clinics; and by gathering the skins of animals sacrificed for Eid-ul-Azha.

During the prime-ministership of Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy (September 1956 – October 1957), JIP argued for a separate voting system for different religious communities. Suhrawardy convened a session of the National Assembly at Dhaka and through an alliance with Republicans, his party passed a bill for a mixed voting system.

In 1951, it ran candidates for office, but did not do well. JIP found it was more successful in promoting its cause in the streets. The election also occasioned a split in the party with the JIP shura passing a resolution in support of the party withdrawing from politics but Maududi arguing for continued involvement. Maududi prevailed and several senior JIP leaders resigned in protest. All this strengthened Maududi&#x27;s position still further and &quot;a cult of personality began to grow up around him.&quot;

In 1953, JIP led &quot;direct action&quot; against the Ahmadiyya, who the JIP believed should be declared non-Muslims. In March 1953, riots in Lahore started leading to looting, arson and the killing of at least 200 Ahmadis and the declaration of selective martial law. The military leader, Azam Khan had Maududi arrested and Rahimuddin Khan sentenced him to death for sedition (writing anti-Ahmadiyya pamphlets). Many JIP supporters were imprisoned during this time.

The 1956 Constitution was adopted after accommodating many of the demands of the JIP. Maududi endorsed the constitution and claimed it a victory for Islam. In 1958, JIP formed an alliance with Abdul Qayyum Khan (Muslim League) and Chaudhry Muhammad Ali (Nizam-e-Islam Party). The alliance destabilised the presidency of Iskander Mirza (1956–1958), and Pakistan returned to martial law. The military ruler, the president Muhammad Ayub Khan (1958–1964), had a modernising agenda and opposed the encroachment of religion into politics. He banned political parties and warned Maududi against continued religio-political activism. JIP offices were closed down, funds were confiscated and Maududi was imprisoned in 1964 and 1967.

JIP supported the opposition party, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM). In the 1964–1965 presidential elections, JIP supported the opposition leader, Fatima Jinnah, despite its opposition to women in politics.

In 1965, during the Indo-Pakistani war, JIP supported the government&#x27;s call for jihad, presenting patriotic speeches on Radio Pakistan and seeking support from Arab and Central Asian countries. The group resisted Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Maulana Bhashani&#x27;s socialist program of the time.

By the end of 1969, the Jamaat-e-Islami was spearheading a major &quot;campaign for the protection of ideology of Pakistan,&quot; which it believed was under threat from atheistic socialists and secularists.

JIP participated in the 1970 general election. Its political platform advocated political freedom of the provinces and Islamic law based on the Quran and Sunnah. There would be separation of the powers (judiciary and legislature); basic rights for minorities (such as equal employment opportunities and the &quot;Bonus Share Scheme&quot; allowing factory workers to own shares in their employers&#x27; companies); and a policy of strong relationships with the Muslim world. Just prior to the election, Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan left the alliance leaving JIP to run against the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Awami League. The party had a disappointing showing when it won only four seats in the National Assembly and four in the provincial assemblies after fielding 151 candidates.

Zulfikar Ali Bhutto won the 1970 election campaign and was strongly opposed by JIP who believed he and his socialist ideology were a threat to Islam.

;Division
JIP opposed the Awami League East Pakistani separatist movement. Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba organised the Al-Badar to fight the Mukti Bahini (Bengali liberation forces). In 1971, during the Bangladesh liberation war, JIP members may have collaborated with the Pakistani army.

In 1968, Maulana Maududi took leave from Emarat of the Jamaat and Maulana Naeem Siddiqui became the Ameer of Jamat e Islami for one year. In 1969, Maulana took Charge of the Jamaat again. In 1972, Maududi resigned citing poor health, and Maulana Naeem Siddiqui refused to become the Ameer of the Jamaat due to his research activities. Thus, in October 1972, the &quot;Majlis-e-Shoura&quot; (council) elected Mian Tufail Mohammad (1914–2009) as the new leader of JIP. Naeeem Siddiqui was chosen as the general secretary.

===Mian Tufail Mohammad (1972–1987)===
After Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1973–1977) was elected, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami (Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba) burned effigies of him in Lahore and declared his election a &quot;black day&quot;. In early 1973, the amir, of the JIP even appealed to the army to overthrow Bhutto&#x27;s government because of &quot;its inherent moral corruption.&quot;

JIP &quot;spearheaded&quot; the anti-Bhutto political movement under the religious banner of &quot;Nizam-i-Mustafa&quot; (Order of the Prophet). Bhutto attempted to suppress JIP through the imprisonment of JIP and Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba members. There were electoral irregularities at the 1975 elections with JIP members being arrested in order to prevent them from lodging their nomination papers. However, by 1976, JIP had 2 million registrants.

In the 1977 election, JIP won nine of the 36 seats won by the opposition Pakistan National Alliance. The opposition considered the election rigged (Bhutto&#x27;s PPP won 155 out of 200 seats) and Maududi, who had been arrested, called on Islamist parties to commence a campaign of civil disobedience. The Sunni-led government of Saudi Arabia intervened to secure Maududi&#x27;s release from prison warning of revolution in Pakistan. JIP assisted the Pakistan National Alliance (PNA) to oust Bhutto and met with Zia-ul-Haq for ninety minutes on the night before Bhutto was hanged.

Initially, JIP supported General Zia-ul-Haq (1977–1987). In turn, Zia&#x27;s use of Islamist rhetoric gave JIP importance in public life beyond the size of its membership. According to journalist Owen Bennett-Jones, JIP was the &quot;only political party&quot; to offer Zia &quot;consistent support&quot; and was rewarded with jobs for &quot;tens of thousands of Jamaat activists and sympathisers&quot;, giving Zia&#x27;s Islamic agenda power &quot;long after he died.&quot;

However, Zia failed to deliver timely elections and distanced himself from the JIP. When Zia banned student unions, Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba and pro-JIP labour unions protested. However, JIP did not participate in the Pakistan Peoples Party&#x27;s Movement for the Restoration of Democracy. JIP also supported Zia&#x27;s Jihad against the Soviet–Afghan War and its sister party Jamiat-e Islami led by Burhanuddin Rabbani became part of the Peshawar Seven that received aid from Saudi Arabia, United States and other jihad supporters. Such conundrums caused tension in JIP based on conflict between ideology and politics.

In 1987, Mian Tufail declined further service as head of JIP for health reasons and Qazi Hussain Ahmad was elected.

=== Qazi Hussain Ahmad (1987–2008) ===
In 1987, when Zia died, the Pakistan Muslim League formed the right-wing alliance, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI). In 1990 when Nawaz Sharif came to power, JIP boycotted the cabinet on the basis that the Pakistan Peoples&#x27; Party and the Pakistan Muslim League were problematic to equal degrees.

In the election of 1993, JIP won three seats. In this year, JIP was a member of the newly formed All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) which promotes the independence of Jammu and Kashmir from India. Prior to this, JIP had allegedly set up the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen, a Kashmir liberation militia to oppose the Kashmir Liberation Front which fights for the complete independence of the Kashmir region.

Ahmad left his position in the Senate in protest against corruption.

=== Successful long march against Bhutto&#x27;s government ===
On 20 July 1996, Qazi Hussain Ahmed announced to start protests against government alleging corruption. Qazi Hussain resigned from the Senate on 27 September and announced the start of a long march against Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s government. The protest started on 27 October 1996 by Jamaat-e-Islami and opposition parties. On 4 November 1996, Bhutto&#x27;s government was dismissed by President Leghari primarily because of corruption. JIP then boycotted the 1997 election, and therefore, lost representation in Parliament. However, the party remained politically active, for example, protesting the arrival of the Indian Prime Minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, in Lahore.

In 1999, Pervez Musharraf took power in a military coup. JIP, at first, welcomed the general but then objected when Musharraf began to make secular reforms and then again in 2001, when Pakistan joined the war on terror, alleging Musharraf had betrayed the Taliban. JIP condemned the events of 11 September 2001, but equally condemned the US when Afghanistan was invaded. Some members of Al-Qaeda, for example, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, were arrested in Pakistan.

In the 2002 election, JIP made an alliance of religious parties called Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal (MMA) () and won 53 seats, including most of those representing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. JIP continued its opposition to the War on terrorism, particularly the presence of American troops and agencies in Pakistan. JIP also called for restoration of judiciary.

In 2006, JIP opposed the Women&#x27;s Protection Bill saying it did not need to be scrapped but instead, be applied in a fairer way and be more clearly understood by judges. Ahmed said,
: &quot;Those who oppose [these] laws are only trying to run away from Islam. ... These laws do not affect women adversely. Our system wants to protect women from unnecessary worry and save them the trouble of appearing in court.&quot;

Samia Raheel Qazi, MP and daughter of Ahmed stated,
:&quot;We have been against the bill from the start. The Hudood Ordinance was devised by a highly qualified group of Ulema, and is beyond question&quot;.

At least during the time of Ahmad, the position of JIP on revolutionary action was that it was not ready to turn to extra-legal action but that its objectives are definite (&quot;qat&#x27;i&quot;) but its methods are &quot;open to interpretation and adaptation (&quot;ijtihadi&quot;)&quot; based on the &quot;exigencies of the moment&quot;.

On 23 July 2007, Qazi Hussain Ahmad tendered his resignation from the National Assembly to protest against the Army operation at Lal Masjid.

===Sayyed Munawer Hassan (2008–2014)===
In 2008, JIP and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf again boycotted the elections. Ahmad declined to stand for re-election due to health issues, and Syed Munawar Hassan was elected as the ameer.

===Siraj-ul-Haq (2014–2024)===
On 30 March 2014, Siraj-ul-Haq, serving as senior minister in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and the party&#x27;s deputy chief, was elected as the new ameer. He replaced the incumbent Munawer Hasan and the party&#x27;s general secretary, Liaqat Baloch. 25,533 office bearers of the party out of a total of 31,311 voted in these elections. It was the first time that the party had voted out an ameer after just one term. He, therefore, resigned from his role as senior minister. This coincided with a drone attack on a madrassa in Bajaur Agency.

In 2016, Siraj-ul-Haq led funeral prayers for Mumtaz Qadri, who had been executed for assassinating Punjab Governor Salmaan Taseer while serving as his bodyguard. Siraj-ul-Haq called for nationwide protests against the execution of Qadri.

===Hafiz Naeem Ur Rehman (2024-Present)===

Hafiz Naeem Ur Rehman was elected the Ameer of Jamaat e Islami on 4 April 2024.

== Organisations ==
JIP provides unions for doctors, teachers, lawyers, farmers, workers and women, for example, Islami Jamiat-e-Talaba (IJT), Jamiat Talaba Arabia and Islami Jamaat-e-Talibaat (its female branch) a Students&#x27; union and JI Youth Pakistan, a youth group.

The party has a number of publications from affiliated agencies such as Idara Marif-e-Islami, Lahore, the Islamic Research Academy, Karachi, Idara Taleemi Tehqeeq, Lahore, the Mehran Academy, and the Institute of Regional Studies. Its print media publications number 22, including the daily &quot;Jasarat&quot;, weekly &quot;Friday Special&quot;, weekly &quot;Asia&quot;, monthly &quot;Tarjumanul Quran&quot; and fortnightly &quot;Jihad-e-Kashmir&quot;, with &quot;Jasarat&quot; in particular having a circulation of 50,000.

The Islami Nizamat-e-Taleem, led by Abdul Ghafoor Ahmed, is an educational body that includes 63 Baithak schools. &quot;Rabita-ul-Madaris Al-Islamia&quot; supports 164 JIP madrasas. JIP also operates the Hira Schools (Pakistan) Project and Al Ghazali Trust. The foundation administers schools, women&#x27;s vocational centres, adult literacy programs, hospitals and mobile chemists and other welfare programs. In this respect, JIP interacts with the general market.

In total, there are around 1000 registered madrasas affiliated with the JeI in Pakistan, the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa having most of them, with some 245 or nearly a quarter of the total.

===Jamaat-e-Islami Azad Kashmir===
An independent wing of Jamaat-e-Islami in Azad Kashmir was started in 1974. According to journalist Arif Jamal, it was done to slow the spread of secular ideas in Azad Kashmir. It had its own &quot;amir&quot;, Maulana Abdul Bari, who had previously participated in the First Kashmir War (1947) as well as the Operation Gibraltar (1965).

The main activity of the Azad Kashmir wing is noted as the sponsorship of jihad in Indian-administered Kashmir. Bari said that he was called for a meeting with President Zia ul-Haq in 1980, and asked to make preparations. He travelled to the Kashmir Valley and eventually persuaded the leaders of Jamaat-e-Islami Kashmir. However, despite having several groups of Islamist youth trained in militancy, the Kashmiri Jamaat was hesitant to take the plunge. Pakistan&#x27;s ISI then used the pro-independence Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) to initiate operations in July 1988.
A year later, Jamaat-e-Islami Azad Kashmir sent operatives to Indian-administered Kashmir to bring all the Islamist groups under an umbrella group called Hizbul Mujahideen as a counter to the JKLF. Jointly with Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan, it also persuaded the Kashmiri Jamaat to take charge of Hizbul Mujahideen by June 1990, and a Jamaat leader called Syed Salahuddin was appointed as its chief.

Jamaat-e-Islami Azad Kashmir also has a student wing called Islami Jamiat-i-Tulaba (IJT). It gained popularity after the founding of Hizbul Mujahideen. Many of its members are said to join the ranks of Hizbul Mujahideen in due course.

===Connections with terrorism===
Jama&#x27;ati was said to had close links to many banned outfits of Pakistan. The most notable connection was with the Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi. This militant organisation grew as an offshoot of Jammat e Islami and was founded by Sufi Muhammad in 1992 after he left Jamaat-e-Islami.
When the founder was imprisoned on 15 January 2002, Maulana Fazlullah, his son-in-law, assumed leadership of the group. In the aftermath of the 2007 siege of Lal Masjid, Fazlullah&#x27;s forces and Baitullah Mehsud&#x27;s Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) formed an alliance. Fazlullah and his army reportedly received orders from Mehsud.
After the death of Hakimullah Mehsud in a drone attack, Fazlullah was appointed as the new &quot;Amir&quot; (Chief) of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan on 7 November 2013. In a May 2010 interview, U.S. Gen. David Petraeus described the TTP&#x27;s relationship with other militant groups as difficult to decipher: &quot;There is clearly a symbiotic relationship between all of these different organizations: al-Qaeda, the Pakistani Taliban, the Afghan Taliban, TNSM [Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi]. And it&#x27;s very difficult to parse and to try to distinguish between them. They support each other, they coordinate with each other, sometimes they compete with each other, [and] sometimes they even fight each other. But at the end of the day, there is quite a relationship between them.&quot;
According to another source, TNSM and Jamaat-e-Islami (JIP) seem to have been locked in a turf war in the Malakand District of Pakistan, and the Jamaat-Ulema-e-Islam, JIP, and TNSM are in conflict with each other in the tribal areas for power and influence.

<text>Atlanta Motor Speedway (formerly known as the Atlanta International Raceway from 1960 to 1990) is a quad-oval intermediate speedway in Hampton, Georgia. The track has hosted a variety of sanctioning bodies since its inaugural season of racing in 1960, including NASCAR and IndyCar. The venue has a capacity of 71,000 as of 2015 and includes various track layouts, including a oval on the track&#x27;s frontstretch, and a roval road course layout. Atlanta Motor Speedway is currently owned Speedway Motorsports, LLC (SMI) and is led by track general manager Brandon Hutchison.

In the late 1950s, plans were made by the First Georgia Securities Corporation to build a facility that rivaled the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. After a months-long delay, the first races were held in 1960. Shortly after, the track faced heavy financial troubles, having to enter Chapter 10 bankruptcy in 1971. After periods of stability directed by Stacey Cotton and Walt Nix, the facility was bought out by motorsports mogul Bruton Smith in 1990, with Smith and his company, SMI, directing the facility&#x27;s expansion and renovation under longtime general manager Ed Clark. The track has since gone through two major reconfigurations since Smith&#x27;s purchase: one in 1997 that changed the layout of the track, and one in 2021 that changed the style of racing to produce pack racing seen at superspeedways.

== Description ==

=== Configurations ===
The track in its current form is measured at , with 28 degrees of banking in the turns and five degrees of banking in the straightaways. The racing surface width varies, with a recorded 52 feet on the frontstretch, 42 feet on the backstretch, and 40 feet in the turns. From 1997 to 2021, the racing surface was at a recorded 55 feet with 24 degrees of banking in the turns. When the track first opened as a true oval, it was advertised to be banked at 24 degrees in the turns, with the straightaways being &quot;banked slightly&quot;.

In 1992, developers added a road course layout that combined the main oval with a specialized infield portion to create a &quot;roval&quot;. As part of the 1997 reconfiguration, developers added a oval on the track&#x27;s frontstretch to accommodate legends car racing.

=== Amenities ===

Atlanta Motor Speedway is next to the concurrent U.S. Route 41 and U.S. Route 19, along with Georgia State Route 20. As of 2015, the track had a reported capacity of 71,000, with recent estimates being unknown due to the track&#x27;s parent company, SMI, refusing to release capacity statistics as late as 2021. At its peak, the facility held a maximum of 124,000 according to a 2010 report by the Atlanta Magazine. The track complex also features a nine-story condominium complex called Tara Place. It was completed in 1994 and features 46 units along with a ballroom. In total, the facility covers around 850 acres of land.

== Track history ==

=== Planning and construction ===
On April 8, 1958, &quot;The Atlanta Constitution&quot; reported that the First Georgia Securities Corporation, led by president Richard W. King, announced plans to build a $1 million (adjusted for inflation, $), 50,000-seat, 400-acre racing facility south of Atlanta along a location near U.S. Route 41. Atlanta International Raceway, Inc. (AIR) was formed to head the project. Two months later, King and racing promoter of the nearby Lakewood Speedway, Carl Queen, opened a stock sale to the general public, with 479,550 shares being offered at $4 each; along with the announcement, the duo stated hopes of hosting NASCAR and United States Auto Club (USAC)-sanctioned races. King later stated hopes of expanding the facility&#x27;s uses to include &quot;almost any conceivable outdoor show&quot;, with developers hoping to host four major races annually. With the announcements, it was slated to become the second-biggest racing facility in the United States at the time, only behind the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. 

The stock sale stagnated, with only $40,000 worth of shares being sold by the end of July. In August, drivers Curtis Turner and Joe Weatherly were announced by King as racing directors within the track&#x27;s leadership, replacing Queen and Ernie Troutman, whose stock in the company was bought by track directors. With Queen sacked, he and King entered into a dispute over future race dates between Lakewood Speedway and Atlanta International Raceway, with both stating that they weren&#x27;t willing to give up dates if they happened to run races on the same day. Groundbreaking occurred on September 17 at 1 PM EST, with King stating plans to host the first races at the facility &quot;sometime in 1959&quot;; actual work on the facility, however, did not start until late November.

==== Delays and postponements ====
By February 1959, Turner and Weatherly both threatened to resign from their positions and file lawsuits against the company, with Weatherly stating that they did not pay them enough for stock sold at meetings, a claim which King refuted. In addition, Weatherly claimed that he only hired to promote and did not want to be involved with selling stock, but was later forced to; he also implied that the financial situation and opening date of the track was unstable, stating, &quot;They painted us a pretty picture... that picture isn&#x27;t so pretty anymore&quot;. Four months later, although stock sales saw further stagnation, the project was able to secure a $400,000 loan, with King claiming that construction progressed enough that construction crews started building the grandstands. The number of flagship races for the track later decreased to three.

A NASCAR-sanctioned race for November 22, 1959, was set in late August, with NASCAR executive director Pat Purcell stating that he thought that the facility would be completed within the next 60 days. In its USAC ventures, however, Indianapolis Motor Speedway superintendent Clarence Cagle recommended changes to the track to increase safety for it to have a better chance at receiving a USAC date. Construction hit its first snag when road building was delayed due to fears of explosive hazards in August. In October, 20 days of rain plagued the track&#x27;s construction, with construction being left half complete. As a result, track leaders decided to postpone the race, hoping to reschedule it in December or January 1960. The race was eventually postponed to March 27, the same day as a major race for Lakewood Speedway; however, with the track still being constructed by February, leaders opted to postpone the race indefinitely.

Four months later, Art Lester replaced King as president of the facility after he obtained over $1 million in financial aid. In addition, the track was able to reschedule the NASCAR race for a July 31 date along with the addition of another unscheduled NASCAR race within the year, signing a $636,000 contract with the E. Jack Smith Construction Company to build the remainder of the track. USAC, despite encouraging words from USAC director of competition Henry Banks, reportedly refused to race at the facility unless &quot;changes are made in the banking of the track&quot;, with USAC claiming they found &quot;one dip especially awkward&quot;. By the end of June, while NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. was confident that the track would be ready for racing by July 31, he stated that developers had &quot;a heck of a lot of work to do&quot;. On July 3, Furman Bisher, a writer for &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;, remarked that while he was able to confirm that the facility would open on time, he wrote that the facility had only built &quot;necessary conveniences&quot;, had costed $1.8 million, and that most of its original leadership abandoned the project by its completion.

=== First years ===
The first tests on the facility were ran by Jack Smith on July 10, with Smith being told to sandbag the session. The facility officially opened to teams on July 25 for pre-race activities for the 1960 Dixie 300; however, the track saw immediate problems. Purcell ordered the fixing of a seven-foot flaw &quot;between the straightaway and the pits&quot; the same day, with no protective guardrails were installed. Rain plagued the track on the 28th, with &quot;a bad bump in the middle groove of the first turn&quot; being reported by drivers. To run the race, track executive Alf Lester hired 17 high school football players for a week. The race itself did not produce any major problems in the track, with a crowd of 25,000 witnessing Edwin &quot;Fireball&quot; Roberts winning the inaugural race. The victory was disputed by numerous drivers, most notably runner-up Cotton Owens who accused NASCAR officials of a scoring error. Bisher later criticized the facility, stating that &quot;[nothing] was ready, there was dirt everywhere. It was like a county fair in the boondocks&quot;. Two weeks later, another annual NASCAR-sanctioned race, the Atlanta 500, was confirmed to be run in late October.

On the same day, an attempt to overthrow Lester by an opposing stockholder group led by T. Walker Jackson and A. E. Deermont was formed because they felt that &quot;Lester is not doing a good job&quot;. Lester, who was facing his second attempt to overthrow him during his tenure, angrily stated that if he was overthrown, leadership would have to pay off an insurmountable $562,000 mortgage payment. A vote was scheduled for September 10, with Jackson claiming that their group had enough votes to sack Lester, unlike the first attempt. A lawsuit was filed on September 1 by 15 stockholders who supported Lester against five opposing stockholders who claimed that they wanted to hold a special stockholders&#x27; meeting to oust the current leadership, leading to the &quot;endanger[ment of] the corporation&#x27;s financial structure&quot;. A second lawsuit, filed by director I. C. Mitchell for libel, was made nine days later against Deermont and four other stockholders that claimed his reputation was damaged in a letter sent to 800 stockholders, which allegedly stated that Mitchell stole $100,000 in gate revenue. Although Lester was able to garner enough support by election day to retain the current administration, he decided to resign from his position, handing it to Nelson Weaver. 

Renovations were steadily made during the first years. A guardrail was eventually installed by late October in time for the 1960 Atlanta 500, but parts of the track still remained unpaved. A new scoreboard, touted as the &quot;world&#x27;s most modern&quot; by &quot;The Atlanta Journal&quot;, was installed nearly two years later. By mid-1963, after further renovations, Weaver announced that the facility was able to make $179,046 (adjusted for inflation, $) in profit for the year, displaying financial success. In 1965, Weaver announced preliminary plans to build a $500,000 dragstrip. In 1967, rumors about the potential sale of AIR to various prospective buyers were reported, including driver and businessman Curtis Turner and then-Atlanta Braves owner William Bartholomay. Weaver later died on February 16, 1968. The day before his death, Weaver appointed Jack Black to replace his position as president of AIR.

=== American Raceways merger, financial troubles ===

Throughout the facility&#x27;s first few years, most of its NASCAR-sanctioned races were plagued by rain delays, leading to financial troubles. In addition, according to &quot;Macon News&quot; writer John Krueger, AIR leadership was plagued by &quot;power struggles for several years&quot; along with &quot;too many chiefs and not enough Indians&quot;. NASCAR personalities, including Junior Johnson and Buddy Arrington, also stated displeasure with the facility, with a poor track surface, heavy mismanagement, and traffic concerns being key issues. Before Weaver died, he used his own finances to keep the track afloat; the stability went away after his death. Under Black&#x27;s leadership, in December 1968, AIR merged with the Lawrence LoPatin-owned Michigan International Speedway, which was built in the same year. With the deal, AIR announced an investment of $1 million worth of renovations for the facility, which covered a repave, a new dragstrip, seating expansion, and amenity improvements. The merger was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in March 1969.

By late 1969, after LoPatin expanded the company and a rebranded it to American Raceways, the company fell into financial trouble after their director of operations, Les Richter, left the company. In response, American Raceways merged with the STP Corporation. The next year, AIR directors attempted to stop LoPatin from purchasing controlling interest of the facility; by this point, LoPatin was seen as a self-centered dictator who had virtually no practical experience with racing within local Atlanta media. In June, AIR directors initiated plans to sever ties from American Raceways after numerous executives, including Black, were removed from active roles or resigned due to LoPatin&#x27;s leadership and the company&#x27;s financial troubles. However, by mid-July, American Raceways was able to purchase complete control over AIR. LoPatin was reportedly ousted shortly after from his position, with Charlotte Motor Speedway president Richard Howard deciding to assist the track so it could run the 1970 Dixie 500. Furman Bisher later recalled, &quot;it was run like a 10-year-old boy would run a candy store. People who knew nothing about racing were trying to run races. Stockholders who knew nothing about a race track were trying to tell people who did how a race track ought to be run.&quot;

By the running of the Dixie 500 in August, American Raceways oversaw numerous major executive changes. The race itself was under threat of being cancelled when the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) demanded they pay $35,000 as a partial payment on their delinquent taxes, which totaled over $58,000. As part of a last-ditch effort to save the facility from filing bankruptcy, they hoped to merge companies with the Charlotte Motor Speedway, led by track president Richard Howard. A deal with Charlotte was officially confirmed in December; an announcement that American Raceways had left the track&#x27;s management was also made. However, a month later, Charlotte backed out of the merger, with Howard claiming that &quot;many factors&quot;, including a local 5% &quot;amusement tax&quot; on gate receipts, misleading debt figures, and an increase of ad-valorem tax by fourfold had made him back out of the deal, essentially sealing the facility&#x27;s fate of bankruptcy.

==== Bankruptcy ====
Atlanta International Raceway officially filed for Chapter 10 bankruptcy on January 19, 1971, becoming a ward under the orders of United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia judge Sidney Oslin Smith Jr. The court later appointed attorney R. Neal Batson to run the track as trustee. The bankruptcy itself was also seen as a key point that put the stability of stock car racing into question; superspeedways like Atlanta across the Southeast had found themselves in economic trouble, with car manufacturers withdrawing financial support from it. At the time of the filing, the facility found itself with around $1,400,000 in debt. With the move, the facility was able to hold the 1971 Atlanta 500, securing a loan from the First National Bank of Atlanta. Five board members also pledged to raise $175,000–200,000 for the race to run. The race later found itself to be crucial to AIR&#x27;s survival; with a crowd of 65,000 or more being claimed for the minimum number needed for its survival, former general manager Hal Hamrick stated, &quot;If the fans don&#x27;t turnout for this one, it is the end of major league auto racing in Atlanta and the end of AIR&quot;. 

The 1971 Atlanta 500 saw a crowd of around 57,000. While below the number that was claimed to be needed, Batson viewed it optimistically, although warning that &quot;we&#x27;re not out of the woods&quot;. After the race, three groups displayed interest in buying the track, including Howard. In May, Batson was replaced by lawyer Stacy Cotton as trustee, with Walter Nix later being appointed as general manager. Within the first year of bankruptcy, AIR made around $188,000, showing optimistic progress. In the 1972 Atlanta 500, a storm plagued the track, destroying numerous amenities, including concession stands and parts of grandstands. However, despite the storm, the race was able to make a profit. The next year, while making around $750,000 in profit, Cotton approved a reorganization plan that would allow Jim Baker and Walter Nix to own controlling interest of the track for $500,000, with the duo planning to use $350,000 of the money to buy stocks. The plan caused some outrage among minority stockholders, who felt that the value of their stock had decreased massively with the deal.

Bankruptcy judge W. H. Drake recommended the reorganization plan in June. The next month, North Carolina Motor Speedway president L. G. DeWitt joined Baker and Nix in their bid to own the track. The reorganization plan was rejected by AIR stockholders; in response, Drake made modifications to appease the opposing stockholders. By the end of the year, Smith awarded the three ownership and placed Larry Hogan and Bob Latford to run AIR. However, in April 1974, leading stockholder James Price challenged the decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, as stockholders voted again to reject the plan. Price claimed that if the three bought the track, the stock would lose five-sixths of its value. The court denied Price&#x27;s bid in January 1975, essentially setting up control for the three. Price later appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States in May, who rejected to hear his appeal. The initial phase of reorganization that included debt payments began in July of that year. By January 1976, the second phase started, which gave creditors options for their stock. Two months later, on March 10, the track was officially turned over to a five-man board of directors, ending five years of bankruptcy. With the deal, the three owned around 52% of AIR.

=== Post-bankruptcy under Walter Nix and L. G. DeWitt ===
In 1978, AIR underwent a repave which was completed by June of that year. By the end of the year, Hogan resigned from his position as general manager. The next year, during the 1979 Atlanta 500, the first fatality at AIR occurred when Dennis Wade, an 18-year-old mechanic for Dave Watson, was hit by Watson after he spun on pit road, killing Wade. Within the year, &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot; writer Mike Mulhurn reported that a group directed by Hogan tried to oust DeWitt from his leadership at both North Carolina Motor Speedway and AIR. However, the takeover of both facilities failed. In 1984, a crash including driver Terry Schoonover claimed the life of the first racer at the facility during the 1984 Atlanta Journal 500. Partly as a result of Schoonover&#x27;s death, then-general manager Mike Helton announced the construction of new walls. In January 1986, Helton announced $3 million in renovations ahead of the 1986 The Winston. Two years later, the facility went through its second repave in 10 years; the repave was meant to be done the next year, but Nix decided otherwise. In September 1989, &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; reported that motorsports businessman Roger Penske offered to purchase the facility from DeWitt and Nix at an unspecified amount. However, on the 22nd, the duo was reported to have rejected Penske&#x27;s offer.

=== Bruton Smith era ===
On February 22, 1990, both Charlotte and Atlanta local media reported that negotiations between Nix and a prospective buyer looking to purchase AIR, Charlotte Motor Speedway owner Bruton Smith, began. Although the facility was expected to have been sold within the month, by the next day, both men denied that the sale had gone through; Smith reported delays in the sale due to &quot;small snags&quot;, and Nix outright denied a closed deal. Four days later, &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; writer Tom Higgins reported that a sale was imminent, which Nix again denied. In early March, Smith claimed that he was waiting for Nix to agree to the deal. Two months later, although his earlier offer stalled, Smith stated renewed hope at purchasing AIR. After another two months passed, AIR released a press statement that declared that Smith&#x27;s second offer was most likely going to be accepted by AIR&#x27;s directors. By mid-October, &quot;Winston-Salem Journal&quot; writer Mike Mulhurn wrote that Smith had begun planning his first promotions at the track, unofficially confirming his purchase.

Smith&#x27;s purchase was officially confirmed on October 24, paying $19.8 million for the facility. Bob Marcum, the manager at the Speedway Club at Charlotte Motor Speedway, was appointed as general manager. With the purchase, Smith announced a plan that sought to invest $75 million worth of renovations to the track. The facility was also renamed to Atlanta Motor Speedway. Within the first year of Smith&#x27;s ownership, he announced the construction of a new 21,000-seat grandstand along with traffic flow improvements, which had been a major issue with the facility since the track&#x27;s inception. The improvements were completed by November 1991. A month later, he announced the construction of a road course layout that utilized both the oval and specialized infield portions, creating a &quot;roval&quot;; the road course held its first races in September 1992. That same year, Marcum resigned from his position, with vice president of events at Charlotte Motor Speedway, Ed Clark, replacing him. In 1993, Clark announced a three-year plan to expand capacity to 180,000. Along with the announcement, plans for a new condominium complex, totaling 112 units, were made. Groundbreaking on the complex, named Tara Place, started on June 1, and although it saw initial poor sales, the $25 million facility partially opened by March 1994. 

==== 1997 repave ====
Within 1994, Clark announced further renovations that were scheduled to be completed by 2000. Among said renovations were the addition of 68,000 seats, expansion of luxury boxes, and the reconfiguration of the track to become a quad-oval. Tara Place was fully completed in November of that year, with 32 of the 46 condos being sold. In August 1995, a new grandstand was constructed, adding 21,000 permanent seats. The reconfiguration started a year and a half later, turning the track from a true oval into a quad-oval. The decision at the time drew criticism from drivers, including Dale Earnhardt, John Andretti, and Johnny Benson Jr. The renovation itself cost $30 million and added 37,000 seats, a oval for legends car racing within the track&#x27;s frontstretch, 44 luxury suites, and upgraded garages. The first tire tests on the new surface were run in September by Bill Elliott, and it held its first races in November. 

In July 2005, a F2 tornado caused by the remnants of Hurricane Cindy hit the facility, causing an estimated $40 million in damage to the facility&#x27;s grandstands, condominium complex, and other amenities. The racing surface, however, was not affected, and cars were able to test on the facility in early August. The next year, developers demolished the backstretch Weaver Grandstands, converting it to a motorhome parking lot. To replace it, developers built a new portion of grandstands on the frontstretch, adding new suites on top of the newly-built Winners Grandstand. With the addition, seating was expanded to 113,000. Four years later, the track lost one of its NASCAR Cup Series race weekends to Kentucky Speedway, another track that Bruton Smith owned. Throughout the 2010s, AMS made gradual decreases to capacity; by 2015, capacity decreased to 71,000 according to &quot;NBC Sports&quot;. Further decreases were made in early 2018, when an unspecified number of seats were torn down in order to construct a hospitality area. Later that year, Clark stepped down from his position as general manager, handing it over to assistant general manager Brandon Hutchison.

=== Entertainment complex proposal, 2021 repave ===
In late 2019, Clark announced a proposal to build a $1 billion entertainment complex if the state of Georgia legalized gambling. A hearing in the Georgia House of Representatives was scheduled in January 2020, with the Henry County Board of Commissioners later voting in favor a statement of approval for a statewide referendum on the issue on the 21st. However, the bill, now titled Senate Resolution 841, was viewed as a long shot; SR 841 needed a two-thirds majority in both houses of the Georgia General Assembly along with a popular vote, with Georgia historically holding a hardline stance on anti-gambling due to religious influence. In March 2021, the proposal saw revived support when Georgia saw increased support for online sports betting, with Clark now campaigning to legalize gambling. However, by 2022, although Hutchison and Clark maintained they were still campaigning for the legalization of gambling and were still in support of building the complex, support for it essentially stagnated.

Clark announced his retirement from his position of president in December 2019 which took effect in March 2020, ending a 27-year reign and giving complete control to Hutchison. After Clark&#x27;s retirement, SMI CEO Marcus Smith hinted an upcoming repave and possible reconfiguration back to the original oval configuration if the entertainment complex proposal passed. On July 6, 2021, a repave and subsequent reconfiguration was officially announced; the first repave since 1997. Banking was increased in the turns by four degrees to a total of 28 degrees, and the racing surface was narrowed to produce a style of racing similar to superspeedway pack racing. The decision was met with criticism from drivers such as Denny Hamlin, Kevin Harvick, and Kyle Busch; particularly on accusations of a lack of driver input from SMI leadership. The repave was completed in late December, and the first tire tests took place the next month.

==== NASCAR ====
Since its inaugural season in 1960, the track has hosted two annual Nascar weekends: the NASCAR Cup Series the Ambetter Health 400 and the Quaker State 400. The Ambetter Health 400, originally named the Dixie 500, was initially planned as a race set to debut in late 1959. However, construction delays caused by bad weather pushed the first race to June 1960. The Quaker State 400, traditionally called the Atlanta 500, was first held in 1960. It ran annually in the spring until 2011, when it was moved to the Bruton Smith-owned Kentucky Speedway. The second race was reinstated to the schedule ten years later, taking place in July. The track also hosts second-tier NASCAR Xfinity Series races with the Bennett Transportation &amp; Logistics 250 and the Focused Health 250 and third-tier NASCAR Truck Series race with the Fr8 208.

In 1986, the facility hosted a one-off iteration of The Winston (now known as the NASCAR All-Star Race), which was originally intended to rotate among different venues each year. However, due to lackluster attendance, the race was moved to Charlotte Motor Speedway, where it remained its permanent home until 2020.

==== IndyCar====

In January 1961, the track confirmed dates for a USAC-sanctioned race in July with Indianapolis-style cars. However, after a frightened Eddie Sachs performed tire tests that saw average lap speeds over , USAC decided to cancel the race, with Henry Banks claiming that modifications to the track to accommodate USAC cars had not been made and that asphalt surface readings were at unsafe temperatures; up to . Track president at the time, Nelson Weaver, later questioned the authenticity of Sachs&#x27; fears and put out a statement that criticized USAC officials. Four years later, Weaver began renewed talks with USAC to host a race; this time, USAC awarded a race weekend in September. The race ran again the next year. In the 1970s and 1980s, Championship Auto Racing Teams (CART) also raced at the facility.

In 1997, the Indy Racing League (IRL) announced plans to race a race at the facility, starting in 1998. The race lasted for four years; the race was removed from the IRL schedule by the 2002 season.

=== Other events and uses ===
The facility on numerous occasions has been used as an evacuee center in the event of hurricanes, including Hurricane Irma in 2017, Hurricane Florence and Hurricane Michael in 2018, Hurricane Dorian in 2019, Hurricane Ian in 2022, and Hurricane Idalia in 2023.

In 2021, the Atlanta Marathon was moved to the speedway and its perimeter roads as a result of COVID-19 restrictions in Fulton County. That same year, &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent: Extreme&quot; filmed its first season at the facility.

==== Movie production ====
The facility has been used in the production of numerous films. It was first used for movie production in 1962 movie &quot;Thundering Wheels&quot;, with driver Jack Smith being featured in the movie. Since, the facility has been used for the 1980 film &quot;Smokey and the Bandit II&quot;, the 1982 Daniel Petrie-directed &quot;Six Pack&quot;, and the 1983 Hal Needham-directed &quot;Stroker Ace&quot;. In recent years, the 2017 film &quot;Logan Lucky&quot; used the facility as a stand-in for the Charlotte Motor Speedway.

<text>In graph theory, a uniquely colorable graph is a -chromatic graph that has only one possible (proper) -coloring up to permutation of the colors. Equivalently, there is only one way to partition its vertices into independent sets and there is no way to partition them into independent sets.

==Examples==

A complete graph is uniquely colorable, because the only proper coloring is one that assigns each vertex a different color.

Every &quot;k&quot;-tree is uniquely (&quot;k&quot; + 1)-colorable. The uniquely 4-colorable planar graphs are known to be exactly the Apollonian networks, that is, the planar 3-trees.

Every connected bipartite graph is uniquely 2-colorable. Its 2-coloring can be obtained by choosing a starting vertex arbitrarily, coloring the vertices at even distance from the starting vertex with one color, and coloring the vertices at odd distance from the starting vertex with the other color.

==Properties==
A uniquely -colorable graph with vertices has at least edges. Equality holds when is a -tree.

==Related concepts==
===Minimal imperfection===
A &quot;minimal imperfect graph&quot; is a graph in which every subgraph is perfect. The deletion of any vertex from a minimal imperfect graph leaves a uniquely colorable subgraph.

===Unique edge colorability===

A uniquely edge-colorable graph is a &quot;k&quot;-edge-chromatic graph that has only one possible (proper) &quot;k&quot;-edge-coloring up to permutation of the colors. The only uniquely 2-edge-colorable graphs are the paths and the cycles. For any &quot;k&quot;, the stars &quot;K&quot;1,&quot;k&quot; are uniquely &quot;k&quot;-edge-colorable. Moreover, conjectured and proved that, when &quot;k&quot; ≥ 4, they are also the only members in this family. However, there exist uniquely 3-edge-colorable graphs that do not fit into this classification, such as the graph of the triangular pyramid.

If a cubic graph is uniquely 3-edge-colorable, it must have exactly three Hamiltonian cycles, formed by the edges with two of its three colors, but some cubic graphs with only three Hamiltonian cycles are not uniquely 3-edge-colorable.
Every simple planar cubic graph that is uniquely 3-edge-colorable contains a triangle, but observed that the generalized Petersen graph &quot;G&quot;(9,2) is non-planar, triangle-free, and uniquely 3-edge-colorable. For many years it was the only known such graph, and it had been conjectured to be the only such graph but now infinitely many triangle-free non-planar cubic uniquely 3-edge-colorable graphs are known.

===Unique total colorability===
A uniquely total colorable graph is a &quot;k&quot;-total-chromatic graph that has only one possible (proper) &quot;k&quot;-total-coloring up to permutation of the colors.

Empty graphs, paths, and cycles of length divisible by 3 are uniquely total colorable graphs.
 conjectured that they are also the only members in this family.

Some properties of a uniquely &quot;k&quot;-total-colorable graph &quot;G&quot; with &quot;n&quot; vertices:
# χ″(&quot;G&quot;) = Δ(&quot;G&quot;) + 1 unless &quot;G&quot; = &quot;K&quot;2.
# Δ(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ 2 δ(&quot;G&quot;).
# Δ(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ n/2 + 1.
Here χ″(&quot;G&quot;) is the total chromatic number; Δ(&quot;G&quot;) is the maximum degree; and δ(&quot;G&quot;) is the minimum degree.

<doc id="676309" wikidata="Q379266" url="?curid=676309" title="Petrov Affair">
<text>The Petrov Affair was a Cold War spy incident in Australia, concerning the defection of Vladimir Petrov, a KGB officer, from the Soviet embassy in Canberra in 1954. The defection led to a Royal Commission and the resulting controversy contributed to the Australian Labor Party split of 1955.

== Background ==
Petrov, despite his relatively junior diplomatic status, was a colonel in (what became in 1954) the KGB, the Soviet secret police, and his wife was an officer at the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD). The Petrovs had been sent to the Canberra embassy in 1951 by the Soviet security chief, Lavrentiy Beria. After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in March 1953, Beria had been arrested and shot by Khrushchevites, and Vladimir Petrov evidently feared that, if he returned to the Soviet Union, he would be purged as a &quot;Beria man&quot;.

== Defection ==
Petrov made contact with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) and offered to provide evidence of Soviet espionage in exchange for political asylum. The defection was arranged by Michael Bialoguski, a Polish doctor and musician, and part-time ASIO agent, who had cultivated Petrov for nearly two years, befriending him and taking him to visit prostitutes in Sydney&#x27;s King&#x27;s Cross area. Bialoguski introduced Petrov to a senior ASIO officer, Ron Richards, who offered Petrov asylum plus £5,000 in exchange for all the documents he could bring with him from the embassy. Planning for Petrov&#x27;s defection was codenamed Operation Cabin 12, after a briefer period of being designated Operation Cabin 11, following the standard practice of referring to potential defectors as &quot;Cabin Candidates&quot;. Petrov defected on 3 April 1954.

=== Evdokia Petrova ===
Petrov did not tell his wife Evdokia of his intentions; apparently he planned to defect without her. After falsely claiming that Australian authorities had kidnapped Petrov, the MVD sent two couriers to Australia to fetch Evdokia Petrova. Word of this leaked out and on 19 April there were violent anti-Communist demonstrations at Sydney Airport as Evdokia Petrova was escorted by the KGB men to the aircraft. On the plane, on radioed instructions from Prime Minister Robert Menzies, a flight attendant asked her if she was happy being escorted back to the USSR, but she did not give a clear answer, as she was racked with indecision – defection could have severe consequences for her family in the USSR. Menzies decided that he could not allow her to be removed in this way, and when the aircraft stopped for refuelling at Darwin Airport, she was seized from the MVD men by ASIO officials. (In order to separate Petrova from the MVD, the ASIO officials confronted them on the grounds that they were carrying arms, which it was illegal to do on an aircraft.) The ASIO officials offered Petrova asylum, which she accepted, after speaking to her husband by phone. By now it was the early hours of 20 April 1954.

These dramatic events were flashed around the world giving immediate sense to a world public of the real life drama that was at pitch and occurring. The photos of Evdokia Petrova being rough-handled by KGB agents at Sydney Airport and her agonised last-moment decision to defect with her husband, made at Darwin Airport, have become iconic Australian images of the 1950s.

=== Royal Commission ===

The affair grew more dramatic when Menzies told the House of Representatives that Petrov had brought with him documents concerning Soviet espionage in Australia. He announced that a Royal Commission would investigate the matter, the Royal Commission on Espionage. Petrov&#x27;s documents were shown to the commission members, though they were never made public. The documents were alleged to provide evidence of an extensive Soviet spy ring in Australia, and named (among many others), two staff members of the leader of the Australian Labor Party, Dr. H. V. Evatt, during proceedings. Evatt, a former justice of the High Court of Australia and the third President of the United Nations General Assembly, appeared before the Royal Commission as counsel for his staff members. His cross-examination of a key ASIO operative transformed the commission&#x27;s hearings and greatly perturbed the government. Almost immediately, the Royal Commission simply withdrew Evatt&#x27;s leave to appear. Evatt alleged that the judges of the commission were biased towards the Menzies&#x27; government in the wake of this unprecedented denial of his right to appear.

Another person who was questioned at length (over a week) about his activities and associations was Ric Throssell, a diplomat and former adviser to Evatt. His mother, the writer Katharine Susannah Prichard, was a committed Communist, and it was strongly suggested he had at least inadvertently, if not wittingly, given her classified information, as well as actively spying for the Soviet Union. The final report did not uphold these charges, but his career from then on was blighted by these suspicions.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
As a result of the defections, the Australian embassy staff in Moscow was expelled and the USSR embassy staff in Canberra recalled. Diplomatic relations were not re-established until 13 March 1959.

=== Political repercussions ===

The defections came shortly before the 1954 federal election. Evatt accused Menzies of having arranged the defections to coincide with the election, for the benefit of the incumbent Liberal Party.

According to some, partly as a result of the Petrov Affair, Menzies was successful at the election, which Labor had been widely expected to win. The Royal Commission continued for the rest of 1954 and uncovered some evidence of espionage for the Soviet Union by some members and supporters of the Communist Party of Australia during and immediately after World War II, but no-one was ever charged with an offence as a result of the commission&#x27;s work and no major spy ring was uncovered. (One was given immunity from prosecution, others who had handled documents had not technically broken the law, one was in Prague and remained there, and evidence against others could not be presented because it would have revealed that Western intelligence services had broken Soviet codes).

Evatt&#x27;s loss of the election and his belief that Menzies had conspired with ASIO to contrive Petrov&#x27;s defection led to criticism within the Labor Party of his decision to appear before the Royal Commission. He compounded this by writing to the Soviet Foreign Minister, Vyacheslav Molotov, asking if allegations of Soviet espionage in Australia were true. When Molotov replied, denying the allegations, Evatt read the letter out in Parliament, inviting amazement and ridicule from his opponents.

Evatt&#x27;s actions aroused the anger of the right wing of the Labor Party, influenced by the Catholic anti-Communism of B. A. Santamaria and his clandestine &quot;Movement&quot;. Evatt came to believe that the Movement was also part of the conspiracy against him, and publicly denounced Santamaria and his supporters in October 1954, leading to a major split in the Labor Party, which did not win office again until 1972.

=== Fate of the Petrovs ===
The Petrovs, having been given political asylum, were eventually settled in suburban Melbourne under the names Sven and Anna Allyson, and given a pension. Prior to this, they spent an 18-month period in a safe house in Palm Beach, Sydney, with the then ASIO officer Michael Thwaites, who ghost-wrote their memoirs, published in 1956 as &quot;Empire of Fear&quot;.

They lived in relative obscurity for the rest of their lives. The press was formally requested by the Department of Defence, by way of a D-Notice, not to reveal their identities or whereabouts, but this was not always honoured. Vladimir died in 1991 and Evdokia in 2002.

=== Retrospection ===
The belief that there had been a &quot;Petrov conspiracy&quot; became an article of faith in the Labor Party and on the left generally for many years, although even pro-Labor historians acknowledged that Evatt&#x27;s eccentric conduct had contributed greatly to the Labor split. The &quot;left&quot; version of the Petrov story was given in 1974 in &quot;Nest of Traitors: The Petrov Affair&quot;, by Nicholas Whitlam (son of Gough Whitlam, who was Labor Prime Minister at the time of publication) and John Stubbs. This book was written without access to classified documents.

Menzies always denied that he had had advance knowledge of Petrov&#x27;s defection, although he did not deny that he had exploited it and Cold War anti-Communist sentiment. Colonel Charles Spry, head of ASIO at the time, when interviewed after his retirement, maintained that, although it had taken some months of negotiations to bring about Petrov&#x27;s defection, he had not told Menzies about these negotiations and that the timing of the defection had no connection to the elections.

In 1984, the ASIO files on Petrov and the records of the Royal Commission were made available to historians. In 1987, the historian Robert Manne published &quot;The Petrov Affair: Politics and Espionage&quot;, which gave the first full account of the affair. He showed that Evatt&#x27;s suspicions were unfounded, that Menzies and Spry had been telling the truth, that there had been no conspiracy, and that Evatt&#x27;s own conduct had been mainly responsible for subsequent political events.

But Manne also showed that although there had been some Soviet espionage in Australia, there was no major Soviet spy ring, and that most of the documents given by Petrov to ASIO contained little more than political gossip which could have been compiled by any journalist. This included the notorious &quot;Document J&quot;, which had been written by Rupert Lockwood, a member of the Communist Party of Australia expressing his beliefs on the matter. Page 35 of the document sourced the information to Evatt&#x27;s staffers, Fergan O’Sullivan, Albert Grundeman, and Allan Dalziel. Evatt insisted that page 35 was misinformation added specifically to damage the Australian Labor Party. He managed to prove that his staff had not authored the document. The Royal Commission concluded that Document J was entirely Lockwood&#x27;s work.

<text>Crazy Woman Creek is a creek in the United States, in Johnson County, Wyoming.

There are several legends about the name. It was the site of a trading post and the site of battles in the American Indian Wars. It was also a locale of the Johnson County War, in which cattle barons started ruthlessly persecuting alleged rustlers in the area through hired killers.

An FAA-operated VOR navigation beacon, named after this area, is located about seven miles (12 km) southeast of the creek. Crazy Woman VOR&#x27;s FAA three-letter station designator is CZI.

The creek that winds and twists for a long distance is large enough that it is broken into three sections, an upper, middle and lower section.

<doc id="676317" wikidata="Q35100" url="?curid=676317" title="Bouyei language">
<text>The Bouyei language (autonym: Haausqyaix, also spelled &quot;Buyi&quot;, &quot;Buyei&quot; or &quot;Puyi&quot;; ; or ) is a language spoken by the Bouyei ethnic group of Southern Guizhou Province, China. Classified as a member of the Northern Tai group in the Tai language branch of the Tai–Kadai language family, the language has over 2.5 million native speakers and is also used by the Giay people () in some parts of Vietnam. There are native speakers living in France or the United States as well, which emigrated from China or Vietnam. About 98% of the native speakers are in China.

Bouyei&#x27;s characteristics are similar to the other members of its language branch. It is generally monosyllabic and word order and particles are the main forms of grammar. Bouyei&#x27;s syllable initials match up closely to the other Northern Tai languages, with relatively fast simplification and merging. Bouyei sentences can be shown to contain many different levels of phrasing.

The contemporary Bouyei script was developed after the abandonment of the Bouyei-Zhuang Script Alliance Policy in 1981 and was designed from 1981 to 1985. It is focused and phonologically representative and takes the Wangmo County dialect as its foundation.

==Distribution==

===China===
According to a 1950s survey performed by the Chinese government, the Bouyei language as spoken in Guizhou can be divided into three general dialect groups (Snyder 2008).

#The Southern Guizhou (Qian) group – the largest of the three – from the Qianxinan Bouyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, which is mostly intelligible with the Guibian and Guibei Zhuang dialects. This vernacular is spoken in the counties of Wangmo, Ceheng, Luodian, Dushan, Libo, Duyun, Pingtang, Zhenfeng, Anlong, Xingren, and Xinyi.
#The Central Guizhou (Qian) group – next most spoken of the three – which is spread throughout Qiannan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and the suburbs of Guiyang, and is partially intelligible with the Southern Guizhou dialects (it is very similar to the Zhuang dialects of northern Guangxi). This vernacular is spoken in the counties of Longli, Guiding, Qingzhen, Pingba, Kaiyang, Guiyang, and Anshun.
#The Western Guizhou (Qian) dialects – the least spoken of the three – which is spoken in the counties of Zhenning, Guanling, Ziyun, Qinglong, Pu&#x27;an, Liuzhi, Panxian, Shuicheng, Bijie, and Weining. The western dialects show more unique features than the other two groups. Some western dialects have aspirated stops, which is an uncommon feature in northern Tai languages (Snyder 2008).

Wu, Snyder, &amp; Liang (2007) is the most comprehensive Bouyei survey to date, and covers the following data points.

The Yei Zhuang varieties of Wenshan Prefecture, Yunnan are closely related to the Bouyei varieties of Guizhou. Many other languages outside China with the names &quot;Yei&quot;, &quot;Yay&quot;, &quot;Yoy&quot;, are also closely related.

===Vietnam===
Bouyei is also spoken in northern Vietnam by several groups, the Bouyei people of Muong Khuong District of Lào Cai Province and in Quan Ba District of Ha Giang Province and the Giáy. Edmondson and Gregerson (2001) has determined their language to be most similar to the Bouyei dialects of southwest Guizhou. The Giáy are an officially recognized group in Vietnam who now number nearly 50,000. Some household registries of the Giáy of Vietnam indicate that their ancestors had left Guizhou 160 years ago during the Qing dynasty, and traveled overland to southern Yunnan and then Vietnam (Edmondson &amp; Gregerson 2001). This coincides with the Miao Rebellion (1854–73) of Guizhou. The Giáy are found in the following locations of Vietnam.

*Lào Cai province
**Tả Van village near Sa Pa
**Bát Xát District
**Mường Khương District
**Bảo Yên District
*Hà Giang Province
**Yên Minh District
**Đồng Văn District
*Lai Châu Province
**Mường Tè District
**Phong Thổ District
*Cao Bằng Province
**Bảo Lạc District
Some Giày are in Yên Bái Province.

The Giáy of Mường Khương District of Lào Cai who call themselves Tu Dí [&quot;thu zi&quot;] can only speak a form of Chinese, and no Giáy. Their autonym comes from their ancestral place of origin, which is Duyun of Guizhou province, China. According to their household records, they had arrived in Maguan County and in Honghe Prefecture about 200 years ago. Similarly, some Giáy of Vietnam report that they have relatives still living in Hekou, Yunnan province, China (Edmondson &amp; Gregerson 2001).

The Pu Nả people of Tam Đường District, Lai Châu Province, Vietnam call themselves the &quot;Vần Nả&quot; (with &quot;vần&quot; meaning &#x27;people&#x27;), and number about 5,000 individuals (Lò 2012:11–20). They are also called &quot;Quý Châu&quot; (&quot;Guizhou&quot; ), &quot;Sa Quý Châu&quot;, &quot;Củi Chu&quot;, &quot;Pu Y&quot;, or &quot;Pâu Thìn&quot;. The Pu Nả live in the following villages of Tam Đường District (Lò 2012:18).

The Yay language described by William J. Gedney is in fact the Giáy dialect of Mường Hum, Bát Xát District, Lào Cai (Edmondson &amp; Gregerson 2001). There are also other related Northern Tai languages spoken in Vietnam as well, such Bố Y, Nhang, and Quy Châu (possibly closely related to Tai Mène of Laos). The Bố Y had originally came from around Wangmo County in southwestern Guizhou. Some subgroups of Bố Y call themselves the &quot;Pu Na&quot; or &quot;Pu Thin&quot;, meaning &#x27;people of the paddy field&#x27;.

===Laos===
There are also some speakers in Laos. In Laos, the Giáy people are called Yang, which is also used four various Rau peoples living there.

The Yang people, also spelled Nhang, are located in Louang Namtha Province, Oudomxay Province and Phongsaly Province. This three provinces are bordered by Yunnan, and one border Vietnam.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The Bouyei script recognizes 32 consonants, with names formed by the consonant in an initial position followed by a long &quot;a&quot; vowel.

Pink: p, t, k, q, z, and c are used only to write Chinese loanwords.

Beige: sl and hr are used for sounds that occur only in certain dialects.

V is pronounced as a before a &quot;u&quot;. 

An absent consonant may produce a glottal sound . is also heard as a final sound.

=== Vowels and diphthongs ===
Bouyei has 77 vowels and diphthongs.


The endings , , , , , , , , and are used in writing Chinese loanwords.

Vowels may also have allophones of .

Another vowel sound may occur phonemically in the dialects of Anshun, Qinglong, Shuicheng, Zhenning, and Ziyun.

=== Tones ===
Bouyei has six tones, corresponding to the eight &quot;sheng&quot; of Middle Chinese: all six in open syllables or with a final or , reduced to two &quot;entering&quot; tones with a final stop.
Marking letters are placed at the end of syllables to indicate tone. Loanword marking letters y, f, j, and q match with Mandarin tones 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

=== Phonological shifts ===
Bouyei shows de-voicing of Proto-Tai–Kadai&#x27;s voiced consonants ( → , → , → ), and loss of aspiration.

Proto-Tai–Kadai&#x27;s tones experienced a splitting into modern Bouyei, shown in the following table.
==Scripts==

===Ancient Bouyei script===
Ancient Bouyei writing was created by borrowing elements from Chinese characters or by mimicking their forms, and is similar to Sawndip. Items collected were mostly Shaman&#x27;s books of the Buyi ancestors, which were used to select auspicious days, lucky numbers and directions, and divination. The scriptures also produced Nuo books and literary works. The Nuo scripts have been widely circulated among the Buyi people in Libo region for more than a thousand years to praise goodness, condemn evil, advocate filiality, and to promote truth, kindness and beauty; and these have become the code of conduct among the local Buyei people. The epic poem &quot;Wang Yulian&quot; was a literary work that is believed to be the retelling of a Chinese story in Buyei language. Its manual copies are popular in Zhexiang Township, Wangmo County in Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture in Southwest Guizhou.

===Old Modern Bouyei===
In November 1956, a scientific conference was held in Guiyang to discuss the creation and implementation of a Latin-based alphabet for Bouyei. The result was a script similar some Zhuang romanizations that used the Longli County dialect as its base. The script was approved by the Chinese government and was put into use in 1957, though its use ceased in 1960.

===Current Bouyei script===
In 1981 a conference on Bouyei history revised the script developed in 1956 in an attempt to make it more practical and phonologically representative of Wangmo County speech. It also was approved by the Chinese government, and was adopted on an experimental basis in 1982. Feedback was largely positive, and the script was officially brought into use in March 1985 and continues to be used to the present.

<text>Leroy Matthiesen (June 11, 1921 – March 22, 2010) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the sixth bishop of the Diocese of Amarillo in Texas from 1980 to 1997.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Leroy Matthiesen was born June 11, 1921, in Olfen, an unincorporated community in Runnels County, Texas. He grew up on a cotton farm.

=== Priesthood ===
Matthiesen was ordained a priest by Cardinal Amleto Cicognani for the Diocese of Amarillo on March 10, 1946. After receiving a Master of Journalism degree in 1948, Matthiesen was appointed editor of the diocesan newspaper &quot;The West Texas Catholic.&quot; The paper featured his column “Wise and Otherwise” until 1998.

In 1954, Matthiesen was appointed the founding pastor of St. Laurence Parish in Amarillo. In 1961. he received a Master of School Administration degree and in 1962 was appointed rector of St. Lucian&#x27;s Preparatory Seminary in Amarillo.

Matthiesen was awarded a Doctor of Journalism degree in 1961, and in 1968 was named principal of Alamo Catholic High School. During this period, he also served for nine years as pastor of St. Francis Parish in Amarillo.

=== Bishop of Amarillo ===
On May 30, 1980, Pope John Paul II appointed Matthiesen as bishop of the Diocese of Amarillo. He was consecrated on May 30, 1980. by Archbishop Patrick Flores. Matthiesen received the Isaac Hecker Award for Social Justice in 1984. In September 1981, in protest of the assembly of the neutron bomb at a facility in Pantex, Texas, Matthiesen called for workers there to resign their jobs in protest. None were reported to have obeyed his call. He remarked: &quot;I&#x27;m no rabble rouser. On the whole I accomplished what I wanted to by bringing an issue to the consciousness of people. It&#x27;s amazing how people have begun to live with the unlivable.&quot;In 1992, Matthiessen called for a stay of execution for Johnny Frank Garrett, a Texas man convicted of raping and murdering 76 year-old Sister Tadea Benz at an Amarillo convent. Garrett was executed on February 12, 1992.

Matthiesen admitted eight priests into the Diocese of Amarillo after they had undergone treatment following accusations of sexual impropriety. His most controversial priest assignments are Orville Blum, Mattheisen appointed as Principal of Alamo Catholic High and pastor of Sacred Heart Church in Amarillo. Im addition. Salazar and Ed Graff. Both of these priests were known to be serious sexual abusers and Matthiesen was warned not to assign them to parishes by other Church officials.

=== Retirement and legacy ===
On January 21, 1997, John Paul II accepted Matthiesen&#x27;s resignation as bishop of the Diocese of Amarillo. Matthiesen received the Ketteler Award for Social Justice from the Sisters of Divine Providence in 2002. In 2002, he celebrated mass at a conference center in Louisville, Kentucky, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of New Ways Ministry. This mass violated a Vatican directive not to celebrate mass for this group.

In 2003, the diocese settled a lawsuit brought by a Texas woman. She claimed that Rosendo Herrera, a priest in the diocese, had impregnated her when she was 17 years ago. The plaintiff claimed that the diocese and Matthiessen tried to cover up the scandal. The diocese settled for approximately $27,000 for the child. In November 2004, the diocese settled a lawsuit for $50,000 in which Matthiessen was listed as a codefendant. A different female plaintiff claimed that Herrera had engaged in wrongful contact with her. Also in 2004, Matthiessen stirred controversy when he started a fundraising effort to assist three priests whom his successor bishop had removed from public ministry.

In 2009, Matthiessen was presented with the Teacher of Peace Award from Pax Christi USA. In his retirement, Matthiesen published three books:

* &quot;Wise and Otherwise: The Life and Times of a Cottonpicking Texas Bishop&quot; (2004) 
* &quot;The Golden Years: The History of St. Laurence Cathedral in Amarillo&quot; (2005)
* &quot;Lieber Bernard und Elise: The Lives and Times of a German Texas Family&quot; (2009)

Leroy Matthiesen died on March 22, 2010, in Amarillo at age 88.

<doc id="676323" wikidata="Q1050460" url="?curid=676323" title="Catawba River">
<text>The Catawba River is a major river located in the Southeastern United States. It originates in Western North Carolina and flows into South Carolina, where it later becomes known as the Wateree River. The river is approximately 220 miles (350 km) long. It rises in the Appalachian Mountains and drains into the Piedmont, where it has been impounded through a series of reservoirs for flood control and generation of hydroelectricity. The river is named after the Catawba tribe of Native Americans, which lives on its banks. In their language, they call themselves &quot;yeh is-WAH h’reh&quot;, meaning &quot;people of the river.&quot;

The river rises in the Blue Ridge Mountains in western McDowell County, North Carolina, approximately 20 miles (30 km) east of Asheville. It flows ENE, falling over two waterfalls, Upper Catawba Falls and Catawba Falls, before being dammed by Lake James, and joining the Linville River. It passes north of Morganton, then southeast through Lake Rhodhiss and Lake Hickory just north of Hickory, and into the Lake Norman reservoir. From Lake Norman it flows south, passing west of Charlotte, then flowing through the Mountain Island Lake and Lake Wylie reservoirs, where it exits the reservoirs approximately 10 miles (15 km) south of the border between North Carolina and South Carolina. The confluence of the South Fork Catawba River and Catawba River is submerged by Lake Wylie near the NC/SC state line.

The river flows into northern South Carolina, passing Rock Hill, through Fishing Creek Reservoir near Great Falls, and into the Lake Wateree reservoir, approximately 30 miles (50 km) northeast of Columbia. At the now-submerged confluence with Wateree Creek, it becomes known as the Wateree River.

==Dams==

The Catawba has been controlled by several dams, including the following:

North Carolina
*Lake James Dam
*Rhodhiss Dam
*Oxford Dam
*Lookout Shoals Dam
*Cowans Ford Dam, creating Lake Norman
*Mountain Island Lake Dam

South Carolina
*Lake Wylie Dam in India Hook
*Fishing Creek Reservoir in Great Falls
*Dearborn-Great Falls Dam
*Cedar Creek Reservoir Dam
*Lake Wateree Dam

==Headwaters and basin==
The Catawba basin begins on the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, near Evans Knob and Cross Mountain, at the edge of Pisgah National Forest. The Broad River begins collecting water on mountain slopes just to the south, with the two rivers waters meeting up again at the confluence of the Wateree and Congaree Rivers near Wateree, South Carolina.

==Controversy==
In 2006 the river became the center of a water use controversy between the residents of the Catawba watershed and Cabarrus County, North Carolina. The cities of Concord and Kannapolis are expecting a daily shortfall of of water a day by 2035 
in their Rocky River watershed and want to pump up to of water daily from the Catawba River. 
The Concord/Kannapolis Interbasin Transfer (IBT) proposal calls for water to be permanently transferred from one river basin to another river basin. Such a transfer is unlike the more common water usage, in which municipalities within the Catawba basin pump water from the river and treat it for residential use. Much of that treated water eventually returns to the Catawba River.

Though neither Concord nor Kannapolis is located in the Catawba River basin (both are located in the Rocky River branch of the larger Pee Dee River basin), the cities said the Catawba River is a regional resource. Opponents of the IBT argued that towns and cities along the Catawba River basin are growing as well, and that the cities&#x27; request is too large.

On January 10, 2007, the North Carolina state environmental panel authorized Concord and Kannapolis to pump up to a day from the Catawba River. This decision represented a compromise recommended by hearing officers for the Environmental Management Commission. The mayors of Morganton and Valdese said that they were adamantly against the transfer and that the panel&#x27;s ruling was skewed and biased. Concord&#x27;s city manager said the approval of the water transfer was &quot;bittersweet&quot;, since the panel authorized an amount much lower than was originally requested and the action is likely to be delayed by lawsuits. 
“Well, (officials from) Hickory are going to file an appeal,” said Concord Mayor Scott Padgett, who spoke briefly with Hickory Mayor Rudy Wright after the EMC meeting. “His major concern is changing the (interbasin transfer) process. My appeal to him is that there should be a truce. To file an appeal is just going to prolong something we deserve, is less than what we asked for and is going to further hard feelings this has already created.”

The controversy ended in early 2010 when all the parties reached a settlement. It further limits the amount of water available to Concord and Kannapolis under drought conditions.

==A river at risk==
Starting in the early autumn months of 2007, residents and businesses of the Catawba basin, along with large swaths of the Southern United States, began to feel the effects of an extreme drought. On October 15, 2007, the &quot;Morganton News Herald&quot; reported that North Carolina Governor Mike Easley described the drought as &quot;the worst in recorded history&quot;.

On January 29, 2008, Duke Energy, the utility responsible for managing the Catawba River, extended its estimated time frame for Stage 4 water restrictions to August. The extension was possible because of conservation measures and the 6 inches of rain the basin received in December. However, area leaders converged on Valdese to hear presentations from representatives of the N.C. Rural Center, N.C. Department of Commerce, N.C. Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and the Appalachian Regional Commission about grants and loans available to help pay for solutions to the drought.

In April 2008 the environmental group American Rivers named the Catawba-Wateree River &quot;the most endangered river in America.&quot; Reasons cited for the river&#x27;s condition are the drought, the presence of 11 hydroelectric dams, global warming, and unchecked development along its banks, with the latter reported as the most serious threat.

On June 11, 2008, South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford signed legislation denoting the Catawba as a state scenic river. The designation carries no land-use restrictions, but it allows the state to convene an advisory group to address river-related concerns.

On June 29, 2009, the EPA announced that four of the top 44 &quot;High Hazard Ash Ponds&quot; in the United States are on the Catawba River. Two ash ponds are adjacent to and discharge into Mountain Island Lake. The EPA High Hazard list also includes ash ponds on Lake Wylie and Lake Norman.

On December 11, 2014, Duke Energy received approval from North Carolina to dump coal ash (containing arsenic, lead, thallium and mercury, among other heavy metals) from the Marshall Steam Station into Lake Norman in order to repair a rusted, leaking pipe at their facility. Groundwater at the Marshall Steam Station flows toward Lake Norman, and the contaminated field abuts the lake for about 30 feet of shoreline near its largest coal ash basin, threatening water quality in the lake.

On October 3, 2015, Duke Energy reported that a sinkhole had formed at the base of the Marshall Steam Station dam north of Charlotte on Lake Norman. The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) says Duke Energy placed a liner in the hole and filled it with crushed stone.

The Catawba River basin is one of only four areas left in the southeast with significant populations of &quot;Hymenocallis coronaria&quot;, the Shoals spider lily. It has one large population left at Landsford Canal State Park.

<text>The O&#x27;Brien Trophy, or O&#x27;Brien Cup, as labelled on the trophy itself, is a retired trophy that was awarded in the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the National Hockey League (NHL) ice hockey leagues of North America from 1910 to 1950. It was originally donated to the NHA by Canadian Senator M. J. O&#x27;Brien in honour of his son, Ambrose O&#x27;Brien. The Cup was fabricated using silver from an O&#x27;Brien mine.

The Cup has been awarded under four definitions. From 1910 through 1917, it was awarded to the NHA champion. In 1921, the Cup was transferred to the NHL and awarded to the NHL playoff champion until 1926–27. From 1927–28 until 1937–38, it was awarded to the Canadian Division regular season champion. Starting with the 1938–39 season, it was awarded to the NHL playoff runner-up. After 1949–50, the Cup was retired and has not been awarded since. In total, the Cup has been awarded in 41 seasons to twelve different teams. The Cup is now in the collection of the Hockey Hall of Fame.

==History==
The Cup was donated to the National Hockey Association by Canadian Senator Michael J. O&#x27;Brien in honour of his son, Ambrose O&#x27;Brien, who was credited with the formation of the National Hockey Association, the forerunner to the NHL. The Cup was originally to be given to the NHA&#x27;s championship team. Made entirely from silver from the O&#x27;Brien mine, the trophy&#x27;s value was estimated at (over CA$ in dollars). Like the Stanley Cup, trustees were named for the trophy. These were NHA executives Harry Trihey, Emmett Quinn and T. Yates Foster. Later, Stanley Cup trustee William Foran would become the sole trustee of the O&#x27;Brien Cup. On December 2, 1911, the NHA officially designated the trophy as the league&#x27;s championship trophy.

When the NHA was suspended in 1917, the Cup was held by the Montreal Canadiens. It remained in their care until 1921. In November 1921, it was announced that the Cup would be given over to the National Hockey League to be awarded annually to the NHL playoff champions. NHL president Frank Calder arranged with Ambrose O&#x27;Brien a new deed of gift. The Cup, which Calder had secured following the death of Montreal President George Kennedy, was then presented to the NHL champion Ottawa Senators. In 1925, the NHL inaugurated the Prince of Wales Trophy, which also was presented to the NHL playoff champions.

From 1927–28 onwards, one year after the NHL expanded to two divisions in 1926, the Cup was awarded to the winner of the Canadian Division, while the Prince of Wales Trophy was awarded to the winner of the American Division. It would be awarded under this definition until the end of the 1937–38 season.

The 1938–39 NHL season saw the NHL move back to a single division, and from that point on the Cup was awarded to the playoff runner-up. The Cup was not formally awarded from 1939 to 1943 and it would not be until 1944 that the winning teams from that period were inscribed on the trophy. At the end of the 1949–50 NHL season, the trophy was retired and has not been awarded since. It is now in the collection of the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and is on display with other historic trophies in the entrance to the Panasonic Hometown Hockey exhibit.

The Montreal Canadiens have won it the most, having won the Cup eleven times. The Toronto Maple Leafs have won it the second most, a total of eight times, six as the Maple Leafs, once as the St. Patricks and once as the Torontos. The Detroit Red Wings have won the Cup the most times of any American team, having won it five times.

<text>Laguna Seca Raceway (branded as WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca, and previously Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca for sponsorship reasons) is a paved road racing track in central California used for both auto racing and motorcycle racing, built in 1957 near both Salinas and Monterey, California, United States.

The racetrack is long, with a elevation change. Its eleven turns are highlighted by the circuit&#x27;s signature turn, the downhill-plunging &quot;Corkscrew&quot; at Turns 8 and 8A. A variety of racing, exhibition, and entertainment events are held at the raceway, ranging from superkarts to sports car racing to music festivals. Laguna Seca is classified as an FIA Grade Two circuit.

The name Laguna Seca is Spanish for &quot;dry lake&quot;: the area where the track now lies was once a lake, and the course was built around the dry lake bed. After the course was reconfigured, two artificial ponds were added.

== History ==
The earliest development of the local area occurred in 1867 with the founding of the nearby Laguna Seca Ranch, which has operated continuously for 140 years with grazing and equestrian uses.

The track was built in 1957 at a cost of $1.5 million raised from local businesses and individuals on part of the US Army&#x27;s Fort Ord (a maneuver area and field artillery target range) after the nearby Pebble Beach Road Races were abandoned for being too dangerous. In 1974 the property was deeded over to the Monterey County Parks Department and continues to be part of the park system.

The first race, held on November 9, 1957, was won by Pete Lovely driving a Ferrari. In the intervening years, the track has hosted USRRC, Can-Am, Trans-Am, Formula 5000, IMSA GT, CART, Indy Car, American Le Mans Series, Grand American, Monterey Historic Automobile Races, Speed World Challenge, AMA (American Motorcyclist Association), WSBK Superbike World Championship and MotoGP motorcycle races (but 125/Moto3 and 250/Moto2 are not admitted).

The day-to-day operations of the track, along with the management and promotion of major racing events, are now handled by A&amp;D Narigi Consulting, LLC. John V. Narigi is the General Manager and President. Until January 1, 2020, it was managed by the Sports Car Racing Association of the Monterey Peninsula (SCRAMP), which is a non-profit organization. With oversight by a board of local residents, SCRAMP operates with a professional staff on-site with the goal of generating income through the operations of the racetrack which is then redistributed to local charities.

The track itself has undergone significant changes over the past two decades to meet evolving safety homologation requirements of the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile (FIA) and other sanctioning bodies. Changes include the addition of the entire infield area in 1988 (present-day turns 3, 4, and 5, eliminating the straight that started at present-day turn 2 and ended at present-day turn 5) extending the track from its original length to meet the minimum-track-length criteria of the FIM for MotoGP events, plus the more recent relocation of pedestrian bridges and embankments, and the expansion of gravel pits outside turns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 for additional runoff. The original media center was demolished in 2006 to make way for additional run-off room in Turn 1. Also in 2006, the &#x27;hump&#x27; at the top of the Rahal Straight was flattened to accommodate the MotoGP riders, though some claim that this increases the wind effects that can perturb a race motorcycle. Remnants of the old configuration can still be seen from the parking lot between turns two and five. They are found underneath a road leading to the parking area for entrant trailers and RVs.


The famous Turn 8 and 8A combination, popularly referred to as &#x27;the Corkscrew&#x27;, is considered one of the motorsport world&#x27;s most challenging turns, due to the drop in elevation as well as its blind crest and apex on the uphill approach.
Turn 2, with its difficult and technical double-apex, has been renamed the &#x27;Andretti Hairpin&#x27;, in honor of former Formula 1 World Champion Mario Andretti, while Turn 9 has been renamed &#x27;Rainey Curve&#x27; in honor of 500cc Grand Prix motorcycle racing World Champion Wayne Rainey, a resident of nearby Salinas, California. Also, the straight that runs between Turn 6 and Turn 7 has been renamed the &#x27;Rahal Straight&#x27; after four-time consecutive Champ Car race winner Bobby Rahal.

A Champ Car World Series weekend had been a prominent event from 1983 through 2004, when its spot on the calendar was shifted to the San Jose Grand Prix. On the last lap of the 1996 CART race, Alex Zanardi passed Bryan Herta on the inside of the Corkscrew to take the victory. Uruguayan driver Gonzalo Rodríguez died during the practice session of the 1999 CART race after crashing at the same corner. Because of the incident, runoff was installed at the end of the Rahal Straight.

Champ Car announced on September 11, 2007, that they would be returning the Northern California race to Laguna Seca from San Jose over the May 16–18 weekend in 2008. But the subsequent merger of Champ Car and IndyCar resulted in the race being canceled. On July 17, 2018, IndyCar announced a return of IndyCars to Laguna Seca, with the event to be held the weekend of September 20–22, 2019.

The track is also the site of the annual Rolex Monterey Motorsports Reunion, formerly known as the Monterey Historic Automobile Races. The event features an extraordinarily eclectic mixture of race cars on the course. Each year features a different marque. Considered one of the two greatest historic racing events (along with the Goodwood Festival in England), attendance often rivals, or surpasses the professional racing events listed above.

There are many permanent dry and hook-up camping facilities located at the raceway, which are available year-round as part of the Laguna Seca Recreation Area, the county park in which the racetrack is set.

The track&#x27;s primary corporate sponsor is WeatherTech which began in April 2018. As part of the sponsorship, the track is now officially referred to as WeatherTech Raceway Laguna Seca. Previously, the sponsorship belonged to Mazda for 17 years with the track being known as Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca.

A 2015 study by California State University, Monterey Bay and commissioned by SCRAMP states that the raceway generated $62.1 million (2015 USD) to the Monterey County economy and $5.2 million in state and local taxes.

==Lap records==
On August 20, 2006, Toyota F1 test driver Ricardo Zonta set an unofficial lap record of 1:06.309. The previous record time was 1:07.722, set by Hélio Castroneves in a Penske Champ Car during qualifying for the 2000 CART Honda Grand Prix of Monterey. The unofficial record was re-taken by a Champ Car on March 10, 2007, by Sébastien Bourdais, who lapped in 1:05.880 during Champ Car Spring Training. The unofficial record was again re-taken by a Formula One car on May 19, 2012, by Marc Gené, who lapped in 1:05.786 in a Ferrari F2003-GA during the 2012 Ferrari Racing Days.

Christian Lundgaard is the unofficial qualifying record-holder with a lap time of 1:06.4610.

At the 2008 Monterey Sports Car Championships, David Brabham set a pole position time of 1:10.103 in a Le Mans Prototype.

At the 2012 United States motorcycle Grand Prix, Jorge Lorenzo set a pole time of 1:20.554 on the Yamaha YZR-M1. During the 2014 Superbike World Championship season, Tom Sykes set the superbike qualifying record time of 1:21.811 on the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R.

The 2019 McLaren Senna holds the current production car lap record. Driver Randy Pobst piloted the unmodified McLaren to a 1:27.62 lap time during MotorTrend&#x27;s 2019 best driver car award testing.

The 2018 Porsche 911 GT2 RS previously held the current unofficial production car lap record with 1:28.30.

The Porsche 918 Spyder held the previous unofficial production car lap record with 1:29.89.

A Mission Motors Mission R, ridden by Steve Rapp, previously held the outright EV lap record with a time of 1:31.376. This was set during qualifying for the 2011 FIM e-Power International Championship/TTXGP World Series race.

In 2018, Earl Bamber clocked an unofficial best lap time of 1:07 around Laguna Seca in the Porsche 919 EVO, despite not intentionally trying to set a lap record.

A McLaren MP4/13, driven by Pato O&#x27;Ward set an unofficial lap time of 1:10.24 at the 2021 Velocity Invitational festival.

As of May 2024, the fastest official race lap records at Laguna Seca for different classes are listed as:

== Other use ==

===Automotive===
When not being used by the major events the track can be rented. Approximately twice a year the Sports Car Club of America holds regional club races for the San Francisco Region. Various clubs rent the track throughout the year for informal high-performance driving schools that allow the public to drive their own cars at speed. The raceway has also played host to prototype testing of the Nissan GT-R in 2007.

The track is featured in video games such as the &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; series (since the second installment, including the bike version &quot;Tourist Trophy&quot;), the &quot;Forza Motorsport&quot; series, and the &quot;MotoGP&quot; series. In a bid to compare real life versus video games, Jeremy Clarkson of the British automotive show &quot;Top Gear&quot; attempted to beat his &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot; time of 1:41.148 in a Honda NSX by racing the real track in the same car in 2005. During the trials, Clarkson determined that the game omitted a few details of the track, and the game&#x27;s physics allowed him to brake later when coming into turns than he could in real life. As a consequence, he managed a best time of only 1:57 on the real course. However, both he and the track instructor agreed that it is possible to complete the course in 1:41 in a Honda NSX if the driver were sufficiently experienced, talented, and most importantly fearless.

It was also used in 1976 for the film &quot;Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo&quot; as a qualifying track.

===Other non-automotive events===
Laguna Seca and the part of the old Fort Ord that is now Bureau of Land Management land annually host the Sea Otter Classic &quot;Celebration of Cycling&quot;. The event has now become the largest cycling festival in the United States, bringing in over 10,000 racers and over 100,000 spectators – and is now the first major event of the year, typically held in April – for both the road bike and mountain bike professional seasons.

Several times each year, bicycles are permitted on the track for 2 hours. The admission fee is $10 per bicycle rider.

Laguna Seca served as the finish line for Stage 4 of the 2016 Amgen Tour of California and
Stage 3 of the 2018 Amgen Tour of California bicycle races.

The raceway has been occasionally as a venue for concerts and other non-sporting events. The Grateful Dead performed on the racetrack in May 1987; later that night, the band filmed their music video for &quot;Touch of Grey&quot; there.

On September 17, 1987, Pope John Paul II celebrated mass at Laguna Seca Raceway, where 72,000 people had gathered to see him.

In the 1990s, the raceway was the venue for the Laguna Seca Daze music festival, which featured performances from music acts in the folk, alternative rock and jam band genres. Artists who performed at the festival include Bob Dylan, Phish, Blues Traveler, 10,000 Maniacs, Big Head Todd and the Monsters, Meat Puppets, 4 Non Blondes, Jeff Healey, The Allman Brothers Band, Gin Blossoms and Shawn Colvin.

On June 24, 2011, John Mueller of Muellerized Suspension Systems married Sheila Stone on the top of the Corkscrew at Laguna Seca. This is the location where the ashes of Lee Mueller (4-time SCCA National Champion, IMSA GTU Champion, 3-time winner of the 24 Hours of Daytona, and 12 Hours of Sebring winner), John Mueller&#x27;s father, were spread.

In spring 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, graduation ceremonies took place at the raceway. Local schools participating included Carmel High School (June 3, 2020) and Pacific Grove High School (May 29, 2020). After collecting diplomas, graduates and their families were able to drive around the track in celebration.

=== Formula One ===
In 1989, the year following the last Formula One race in Detroit, choices for a new location for the United States Grand Prix came down to Laguna Seca and Phoenix. The aforementioned 1988 improvements to the track were made in part to lure the F1 race. In the final decision, Laguna Seca was thought to be too remote and too small for an F1 crowd, and so Phoenix was granted the Grand Prix.

* Dani Rivas – 2015 MotoAmerica (SBK meet)
* Bernat Martínez – 2015 MotoAmerica (SBK meet)

<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a graph homomorphism is a mapping between two graphs that respects their structure. More concretely, it is a function between the vertex sets of two graphs that maps adjacent vertices to adjacent vertices.

Homomorphisms generalize various notions of graph colorings and allow the expression of an important class of constraint satisfaction problems, such as certain scheduling or frequency assignment problems.
The fact that homomorphisms can be composed leads to rich algebraic structures: a preorder on graphs, a distributive lattice, and a category (one for undirected graphs and one for directed graphs).
The computational complexity of finding a homomorphism between given graphs is prohibitive in general, but a lot is known about special cases that are solvable in polynomial time. Boundaries between tractable and intractable cases have been an active area of research.

==Definitions==
In this article, unless stated otherwise, &quot;graphs&quot; are finite, undirected graphs with loops allowed, but multiple edges (parallel edges) disallowed.
A graph homomorphism   from a graph formula_1 to a graph formula_2, written
is a function from formula_3 to formula_4 that preserves edges. Formally, formula_5 implies formula_6, for all pairs of vertices formula_7 in formula_3.
If there exists any homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is said to be homomorphic to &quot;H&quot; or &quot;H&quot;-colorable. This is often denoted as just

The above definition is extended to directed graphs. Then, for a homomorphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot;, (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;),&quot;f&quot;(&quot;v&quot;)) is an arc (directed edge) of &quot;H&quot; whenever (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) is an arc of &quot;G&quot;.

There is an injective homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot; (i.e., one that maps distinct vertices in &quot;G&quot; to distinct vertices in &quot;H&quot;) if and only if &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to a subgraph of &quot;H&quot;.
If a homomorphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; is a bijection, and its inverse function is also a graph homomorphism, then &quot;f&quot; is a graph isomorphism.

Covering maps are a special kind of homomorphisms that mirror the definition and many properties of covering maps in topology.
They are defined as surjective homomorphisms (i.e., something maps to each vertex) that are also locally bijective, that is, a bijection on the neighbourhood of each vertex.
An example is the bipartite double cover, formed from a graph by splitting each vertex &quot;v&quot; into &quot;v0&quot; and &quot;v1&quot; and replacing each edge &quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot; with edges &quot;u0&quot;,&quot;v1&quot; and &quot;v0&quot;,&quot;u1&quot;. The function mapping &quot;v0&quot; and &quot;v1&quot; in the cover to &quot;v&quot; in the original graph is a homomorphism and a covering map.

Graph homeomorphism is a different notion, not related directly to homomorphisms. Roughly speaking, it requires injectivity, but allows mapping edges to paths (not just to edges). Graph minors are a still more relaxed notion.

===Cores and retracts===

Two graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are homomorphically equivalent if
&quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; and &quot;H&quot; → &quot;G&quot;. The maps are not necessarily surjective nor injective. For instance, the complete bipartite graphs &quot;K&quot;2,2 and &quot;K&quot;3,3 are homomorphically equivalent: each map can be defined as taking the left (resp. right) half of the domain graph and mapping to just one vertex in the left (resp. right) half of the image graph.

A retraction is a homomorphism &quot;r&quot; from a graph &quot;G&quot; to a subgraph &quot;H&quot; of &quot;G&quot; such that &quot;r&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) = &quot;v&quot; for each vertex &quot;v&quot; of &quot;H&quot;.
In this case the subgraph &quot;H&quot; is called a retract of &quot;G&quot;.

A core is a graph with no homomorphism to any proper subgraph. Equivalently, a core can be defined as a graph that does not retract to any proper subgraph.
Every graph &quot;G&quot; is homomorphically equivalent to a unique core (up to isomorphism), called &quot;the core&quot; of &quot;G&quot;. Notably, this is not true in general for infinite graphs.
However, the same definitions apply to directed graphs and a directed graph is also equivalent to a unique core.
Every graph and every directed graph contains its core as a retract and as an induced subgraph.

For example, all complete graphs &quot;K&quot;n and all odd cycles (cycle graphs of odd length) are cores.
Every 3-colorable graph &quot;G&quot; that contains a triangle (that is, has the complete graph &quot;K&quot;3 as a subgraph) is homomorphically equivalent to &quot;K&quot;3. This is because, on one hand, a 3-coloring of &quot;G&quot; is the same as a homomorphism &quot;G&quot; → &quot;K&quot;3, as explained below. On the other hand, every subgraph of &quot;G&quot; trivially admits a homomorphism into &quot;G&quot;, implying &quot;K&quot;3 → &quot;G&quot;. This also means that &quot;K&quot;3 is the core of any such graph &quot;G&quot;. Similarly, every bipartite graph that has at least one edge is equivalent to &quot;K&quot;2.

==Connection to colorings==
A &quot;k&quot;-coloring, for some integer &quot;k&quot;, is an assignment of one of &quot;k&quot; colors to each vertex of a graph &quot;G&quot; such that the endpoints of each edge get different colors. The &quot;k&quot;-colorings of &quot;G&quot; correspond exactly to homomorphisms from &quot;G&quot; to the complete graph &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot;. Indeed, the vertices of &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot; correspond to the &quot;k&quot; colors, and two colors are adjacent as vertices of &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot; if and only if they are different. Hence a function defines a homomorphism to &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot; if and only if it maps adjacent vertices of &quot;G&quot; to different colors (i.e., it is a &quot;k&quot;-coloring). In particular, &quot;G&quot; is &quot;k&quot;-colorable if and only if it is &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot;-colorable.

If there are two homomorphisms &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; and &quot;H&quot; → &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot;, then their composition &quot;G&quot; → &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot; is also a homomorphism. In other words, if a graph &quot;H&quot; can be colored with &quot;k&quot; colors, and there is a homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; can also be &quot;k&quot;-colored. Therefore, &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; implies χ(&quot;G&quot;) ≤ χ(&quot;H&quot;), where &quot;χ&quot; denotes the chromatic number of a graph (the least &quot;k&quot; for which it is &quot;k&quot;-colorable).

===Variants===
General homomorphisms can also be thought of as a kind of coloring: if the vertices of a fixed graph &quot;H&quot; are the available &quot;colors&quot; and edges of &quot;H&quot; describe which colors are &quot;compatible&quot;, then an &quot;H&quot;-coloring of &quot;G&quot; is an assignment of colors to vertices of &quot;G&quot; such that adjacent vertices get compatible colors.
Many notions of graph coloring fit into this pattern and can be expressed as graph homomorphisms into different families of graphs.
Circular colorings can be defined using homomorphisms into circular complete graphs, refining the usual notion of colorings.
Fractional and &quot;b&quot;-fold coloring can be defined using homomorphisms into Kneser graphs.
T-colorings correspond to homomorphisms into certain infinite graphs.
An oriented coloring of a directed graph is a homomorphism into any oriented graph.
An L(2,1)-coloring is a homomorphism into the complement of the path graph that is locally injective, meaning it is required to be injective on the neighbourhood of every vertex.

===Orientations without long paths===

Another interesting connection concerns orientations of graphs.
An orientation of an undirected graph &quot;G&quot; is any directed graph obtained by choosing one of the two possible orientations for each edge.
An example of an orientation of the complete graph &quot;Kk&quot; is the transitive tournament &quot;k&quot; with vertices 1,2,…,&quot;k&quot; and arcs from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;j&quot; whenever &quot;i&quot; &lt; &quot;j&quot;.
A homomorphism between orientations of graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; yields a homomorphism between the undirected graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;, simply by disregarding the orientations.
On the other hand, given a homomorphism &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot; between undirected graphs, any orientation of &quot;H&quot; can be pulled back to an orientation of &quot;G&quot; so that has a homomorphism to .
Therefore, a graph &quot;G&quot; is &quot;k&quot;-colorable (has a homomorphism to &quot;Kk&quot;) if and only if some orientation of &quot;G&quot; has a homomorphism to &quot;k&quot;.

A folklore theorem states that for all &quot;k&quot;, a directed graph &quot;G&quot; has a homomorphism to &quot;k&quot; if and only if it admits no homomorphism from the directed path &quot;k&quot;+1.
Here &quot;n&quot; is the directed graph with vertices 1, 2, …, &quot;n&quot; and edges from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;i&quot; + 1, for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, …, &quot;n&quot; − 1.
Therefore, a graph is &quot;k&quot;-colorable if and only if it has an orientation that admits no homomorphism from &quot;k&quot;+1.
This statement can be strengthened slightly to say that a graph is &quot;k&quot;-colorable if and only if some orientation contains no directed path of length &quot;k&quot; (no &quot;k&quot;+1 as a subgraph). 
This is the Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem.

==Connection to constraint satisfaction problems==
===Examples===

Some scheduling problems can be modeled as a question about finding graph homomorphisms. As an example, one might want to assign workshop courses to time slots in a calendar so that two courses attended by the same student are not too close to each other in time. The courses form a graph &quot;G&quot;, with an edge between any two courses that are attended by some common student. The time slots form a graph &quot;H&quot;, with an edge between any two slots that are distant enough in time. For instance, if one wants a cyclical, weekly schedule, such that each student gets their workshop courses on non-consecutive days, then &quot;H&quot; would be the complement graph of &quot;C&quot;7. A graph homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot; is then a schedule assigning courses to time slots, as specified. To add a requirement saying that, e.g., no single student has courses on both Friday and Monday, it suffices to remove the corresponding edge from &quot;H&quot;.

A simple frequency allocation problem can be specified as follows: a number of transmitters in a wireless network must choose a frequency channel on which they will transmit data. To avoid interference, transmitters that are geographically close should use channels with frequencies that are far apart. If this condition is approximated with a single threshold to define &#x27;geographically close&#x27; and &#x27;far apart&#x27;, then a valid channel choice again corresponds to a graph homomorphism. It should go from the graph of transmitters &quot;G&quot;, with edges between pairs that are geographically close, to the graph of channels &quot;H&quot;, with edges between channels that are far apart. While this model is rather simplified, it does admit some flexibility: transmitter pairs that are not close but could interfere because of geographical features can be added to the edges of &quot;G&quot;. Those that do not communicate at the same time can be removed from it. Similarly, channel pairs that are far apart but exhibit harmonic interference can be removed from the edge set of &quot;H&quot;.

In each case, these simplified models display many of the issues that have to be handled in practice. Constraint satisfaction problems, which generalize graph homomorphism problems, can express various additional types of conditions (such as individual preferences, or bounds on the number of coinciding assignments). This allows the models to be made more realistic and practical.

===Formal view===
Graphs and directed graphs can be viewed as a special case of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple of relations on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.
In general, the question of finding a homomorphism from one relational structure to another is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP).
The case of graphs gives a concrete first step that helps to understand more complicated CSPs.
Many algorithmic methods for finding graph homomorphisms, like backtracking, constraint propagation and local search, apply to all CSPs.

For graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;, the question of whether &quot;G&quot; has a homomorphism to &quot;H&quot; corresponds to a CSP instance with only one kind of constraint, as follows. The &quot;variables&quot; are the vertices of &quot;G&quot; and the &quot;domain&quot; for each variable is the vertex set of &quot;H&quot;. An &quot;evaluation&quot; is a function that assigns to each variable an element of the domain, so a function &quot;f&quot; from &quot;V&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) to &quot;V&quot;(&quot;H&quot;). Each edge or arc (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) of &quot;G&quot; then corresponds to the &quot;constraint&quot; ((&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;), E(&quot;H&quot;)). This is a constraint expressing that the evaluation should map the arc (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) to a pair (&quot;f&quot;(&quot;u&quot;),&quot;f&quot;(&quot;v&quot;)) that is in the relation &quot;E&quot;(&quot;H&quot;), that is, to an arc of &quot;H&quot;. A solution to the CSP is an evaluation that respects all constraints, so it is exactly a homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot;.

==Structure of homomorphisms==
Compositions of homomorphisms are homomorphisms. 
In particular, the relation → on graphs is transitive (and reflexive, trivially), so it is a preorder on graphs.
Let the equivalence class of a graph &quot;G&quot; under homomorphic equivalence be [&quot;G&quot;].
The equivalence class can also be represented by the unique core in [&quot;G&quot;].
The relation → is a partial order on those equivalence classes; it defines a poset.

Let &quot;G&quot; &lt; &quot;H&quot; denote that there is a homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot;, but no homomorphism from &quot;H&quot; to &quot;G&quot;.
The relation → is a dense order, meaning that for all (undirected) graphs &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot; such that &quot;G&quot; &lt; &quot;H&quot;, there is a graph &quot;K&quot; such that &quot;G&quot; &lt; &quot;K&quot; &lt; &quot;H&quot; (this holds except for the trivial cases &quot;G&quot; = &quot;K&quot;0 or &quot;K&quot;1).
For example, between any two complete graphs (except &quot;K&quot;0, &quot;K&quot;1, &quot;K&quot;2) there are infinitely many circular complete graphs, corresponding to rational numbers between natural numbers.

The poset of equivalence classes of graphs under homomorphisms is a distributive lattice, with the join of [&quot;G&quot;] and [&quot;H&quot;] defined as (the equivalence class of) the disjoint union [&quot;G&quot; ∪ &quot;H&quot;], and the meet of [&quot;G&quot;] and [&quot;H&quot;] defined as the tensor product [&quot;G&quot; × &quot;H&quot;] (the choice of graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; representing the equivalence classes [&quot;G&quot;] and [&quot;H&quot;] does not matter).
The join-irreducible elements of this lattice are exactly connected graphs. This can be shown using the fact that a homomorphism maps a connected graph into one connected component of the target graph.
The meet-irreducible elements of this lattice are exactly the multiplicative graphs. These are the graphs &quot;K&quot; such that a product &quot;G&quot; × &quot;H&quot; has a homomorphism to &quot;K&quot; only when one of &quot;G&quot; or &quot;H&quot; also does. Identifying multiplicative graphs lies at the heart of Hedetniemi&#x27;s conjecture.

Graph homomorphisms also form a category, with graphs as objects and homomorphisms as arrows.
The initial object is the empty graph, while the terminal object is the graph with one vertex and one loop at that vertex.
The tensor product of graphs is the category-theoretic product and 
the exponential graph is the exponential object for this category.
Since these two operations are always defined, the category of graphs is a cartesian closed category.
For the same reason, the lattice of equivalence classes of graphs under homomorphisms is in fact a Heyting algebra.

For directed graphs the same definitions apply. In particular → is a partial order on equivalence classes of directed graphs. It is distinct from the order → on equivalence classes of undirected graphs, but contains it as a suborder. This is because every undirected graph can be thought of as a directed graph where every arc (&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;) appears together with its inverse arc (&quot;v&quot;,&quot;u&quot;), and this does not change the definition of homomorphism. The order → for directed graphs is again a distributive lattice and a Heyting algebra, with join and meet operations defined as before. However, it is not dense. There is also a category with directed graphs as objects and homomorphisms as arrows, which is again a cartesian closed category.

===Incomparable graphs===

There are many incomparable graphs with respect to the homomorphism preorder, that is, pairs of graphs such that neither admits a homomorphism into the other.
One way to construct them is to consider the odd girth of a graph &quot;G&quot;, the length of its shortest odd-length cycle.
The odd girth is, equivalently, the smallest odd number &quot;g&quot; for which there exists a homomorphism from the cycle graph on &quot;g&quot; vertices to &quot;G&quot;. For this reason, if &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot;, then the odd girth of &quot;G&quot; is greater than or equal to the odd girth of &quot;H&quot;.

On the other hand, if &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot;, then the chromatic number of &quot;G&quot; is less than or equal to the chromatic number of &quot;H&quot;. 
Therefore, if &quot;G&quot; has strictly larger odd girth than &quot;H&quot; and strictly larger chromatic number than &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are incomparable.
For example, the Grötzsch graph is 4-chromatic and triangle-free (it has girth 4 and odd girth 5), so it is incomparable to the triangle graph &quot;K&quot;3.

Examples of graphs with arbitrarily large values of odd girth and chromatic number are Kneser graphs and generalized Mycielskians.
A sequence of such graphs, with simultaneously increasing values of both parameters, gives infinitely many incomparable graphs (an antichain in the homomorphism preorder).
Other properties, such as density of the homomorphism preorder, can be proved using such families.
Constructions of graphs with large values of chromatic number and girth, not just odd girth, are also possible, but more complicated (see Girth and graph coloring).

Among directed graphs, it is much easier to find incomparable pairs. For example, consider the directed cycle graphs &quot;n&quot;, with vertices 1, 2, …, &quot;n&quot; and edges from &quot;i&quot; to &quot;i&quot; + 1 (for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, …, &quot;n&quot; − 1) and from &quot;n&quot; to 1.
There is a homomorphism from &quot;n&quot; to &quot;k&quot; (&quot;n&quot;, &quot;k&quot; ≥ 3) if and only if &quot;n&quot; is a multiple of &quot;k&quot;. 
In particular, directed cycle graphs &quot;n&quot; with &quot;n&quot; prime are all incomparable.

==Computational complexity==
In the graph homomorphism problem, an instance is a pair of graphs (&quot;G&quot;,&quot;H&quot;) and a solution is a homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; to &quot;H&quot;. The general decision problem, asking whether there is any solution, is NP-complete. However, limiting allowed instances gives rise to a variety of different problems, some of which are much easier to solve. Methods that apply when restraining the left side &quot;G&quot; are very different than for the right side &quot;H&quot;, but in each case a dichotomy (a sharp boundary between easy and hard cases) is known or conjectured.

===Homomorphisms to a fixed graph===
The homomorphism problem with a fixed graph &quot;H&quot; on the right side of each instance is also called the &quot;H&quot;-coloring problem. When &quot;H&quot; is the complete graph &quot;K&quot;&quot;k&quot;, this is the graph &quot;k&quot;-coloring problem, which is solvable in polynomial time for &quot;k&quot; = 0, 1, 2, and NP-complete otherwise.
In particular, &quot;K&quot;2-colorability of a graph &quot;G&quot; is equivalent to &quot;G&quot; being bipartite, which can be tested in linear time.
More generally, whenever &quot;H&quot; is a bipartite graph, &quot;H&quot;-colorability is equivalent to &quot;K&quot;2-colorability (or &quot;K&quot;&quot;0&quot; / &quot;K&quot;&quot;1&quot;-colorability when &quot;H&quot; is empty/edgeless), hence equally easy to decide.
Pavol Hell and Jaroslav Nešetřil proved that, for undirected graphs, no other case is tractable:

: Hell–Nešetřil theorem (1990): The &quot;H&quot;-coloring problem is in P when &quot;H&quot; is bipartite and NP-complete otherwise.

This is also known as the &quot;dichotomy theorem&quot; for (undirected) graph homomorphisms, since it divides &quot;H&quot;-coloring problems into NP-complete or P problems, with no intermediate cases.
For directed graphs, the situation is more complicated and in fact equivalent to the much more general question of characterizing the complexity of constraint satisfaction problems.
It turns out that &quot;H&quot;-coloring problems for directed graphs are just as general and as diverse as CSPs with any other kinds of constraints. Formally, a (finite) &quot;constraint language&quot; (or &quot;template&quot;) &quot;Γ&quot; is a finite domain and a finite set of relations over this domain. CSP(&quot;Γ&quot;) is the constraint satisfaction problem where instances are only allowed to use constraints in &quot;Γ&quot;. 
: Theorem (Feder, Vardi 1998): For every constraint language &quot;Γ&quot;, the problem CSP(&quot;Γ&quot;) is equivalent under polynomial-time reductions to some &quot;H&quot;-coloring problem, for some directed graph &quot;H&quot;.

Intuitively, this means that every algorithmic technique or complexity result that applies to &quot;H&quot;-coloring problems for directed graphs &quot;H&quot; applies just as well to general CSPs. In particular, one can ask whether the Hell–Nešetřil theorem can be extended to directed graphs. By the above theorem, this is equivalent to the Feder–Vardi conjecture (aka CSP conjecture, dichotomy conjecture) on CSP dichotomy, which states that for every constraint language &quot;Γ&quot;, CSP(&quot;Γ&quot;) is NP-complete or in P. This conjecture was proved in 2017 independently by Dmitry Zhuk and Andrei Bulatov, leading to the following corollary:
: Corollary (Bulatov 2017; Zhuk 2017): The &quot;H&quot;-coloring problem on directed graphs, for a fixed &quot;H&quot;, is either in P or NP-complete.

===Homomorphisms from a fixed family of graphs===
The homomorphism problem with a single fixed graph &quot;G&quot; on left side of input instances can be solved by brute-force in time |&quot;V&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)|O(|&quot;V&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)|), so polynomial in the size of the input graph &quot;H&quot;. In other words, the problem is trivially in P for graphs &quot;G&quot; of bounded size. The interesting question is then what other properties of &quot;G&quot;, beside size, make polynomial algorithms possible.

The crucial property turns out to be treewidth, a measure of how tree-like the graph is. For a graph &quot;G&quot; of treewidth at most &quot;k&quot; and a graph &quot;H&quot;, the homomorphism problem can be solved in time |&quot;V&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)|O(&quot;k&quot;) with a standard dynamic programming approach. In fact, it is enough to assume that the core of &quot;G&quot; has treewidth at most &quot;k&quot;. This holds even if the core is not known.

The exponent in the |&quot;V&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)|O(&quot;k&quot;)-time algorithm cannot be lowered significantly: no algorithm with running time |&quot;V&quot;(&quot;H&quot;)|o(tw(&quot;G&quot;) /log tw(&quot;G&quot;)) exists, assuming the exponential time hypothesis (ETH), even if the inputs are restricted to any class of graphs of unbounded treewidth.
The ETH is an unproven assumption similar to P ≠ NP, but stronger.
Under the same assumption, there are also essentially no other properties that can be used to get polynomial time algorithms. This is formalized as follows:
: Theorem (Grohe): For a computable class of graphs formula_9, the homomorphism problem for instances formula_10 with formula_11 is in P if and only if graphs in formula_9 have cores of bounded treewidth (assuming ETH).

One can ask whether the problem is at least solvable in a time arbitrarily highly dependent on &quot;G&quot;, but with a fixed polynomial dependency on the size of &quot;H&quot;.
The answer is again positive if we limit &quot;G&quot; to a class of graphs with cores of bounded treewidth, and negative for every other class.
In the language of parameterized complexity, this formally states that the homomorphism problem in formula_9 parameterized by the size (number of edges) of &quot;G&quot; exhibits a dichotomy. It is fixed-parameter tractable if graphs in formula_9 have cores of bounded treewidth, and W[1]-complete otherwise.

The same statements hold more generally for constraint satisfaction problems (or for relational structures, in other words). The only assumption needed is that constraints can involve only a bounded number of variables (all relations are of some bounded arity, 2 in the case of graphs). The relevant parameter is then the treewidth of the primal constraint graph.

<text>Lamb of God is an American heavy metal band from Richmond, Virginia. Formed in 1994 as Burn the Priest, the group consists of bassist John Campbell, vocalist Randy Blythe, guitarists Mark Morton and Willie Adler, and drummer Art Cruz. The band is considered a significant member of the new wave of American heavy metal movement.

Since their formation, Lamb of God has released eleven studio albums, including two under the name Burn the Priest; their most recent album, &quot;Omens&quot;, was released in October 2022. The band has also released one live album, one compilation album, three DVDs, two EPs, and twenty-eight singles.

The band&#x27;s cumulative sales equal almost two million in the United States, including two albums certified Gold by the RIAA. In 2010 and 2011 the band received Grammy nominations for songs from their 2009 album &quot;Wrath&quot;. They also received a nomination in 2016 for their song &quot;512&quot;. Lamb of God has toured with the Ozzfest twice. Other appearances include Download Festival and Sonisphere Festival in the UK, Soundwave Festival, Mayhem Festival 2010 and Gigantour. From 2008 to 2010 they toured as part of Metallica&#x27;s World Magnetic Tour, and supported Slayer on their final world tour in 2018 and 2019.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Burn the Priest&quot; (1994–1999)===

In 1994, bassist John Campbell, drummer Chris Adler, and guitarists Mark Morton and Matt Conner started a band named Burn the Priest. The band members knew each other from the college they were all attending, Virginia Commonwealth University, in Richmond, Virginia. Morton and Conner left the band soon after its inception to pursue a master&#x27;s degree and work on other bands respectively. Adler and Campbell replaced Morton with Abe Spear. For the next five years, the band practiced in Richmond and around Virginia. In 1995, the band released its self-titled first demo. After the demo, Burn the Priest recorded two split EPs with Agents of Satan and ZED respectively. After the band&#x27;s first three demos, Burn the Priest added vocalist Randy Blythe to its line up.

In 1997, Morton returned to the band. Two years later, the band released its first full-length self-titled album, &quot;Burn the Priest&quot;, through Legion Records. Mikey Brosnan of Legion Records saved up $2,500 for the recording and then broke them in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, through DIY shows. The album was produced by Today Is the Day guitarist and vocalist Steve Austin. Spear left the band, leaving an open position for a guitarist. Adler&#x27;s younger brother Willie became the band&#x27;s second guitarist a year later, and a deal with Prosthetic Records was signed. Contrary to rumour, the band did not change their name to Lamb of God after being banned from venues; these bans occurred afterwards. They changed their name because of the altered line-up and to avoid being mistaken for a satanic metal band.

===&quot;New American Gospel&quot; and &quot;As the Palaces Burn&quot; (2000–2003)===
With a new name and label, the band released its second album, &quot;New American Gospel&quot;, in September 2000. Patrick Kennedy of Allmusic compared the band to Pantera stating, &quot;The essential signatures of post-Pantera metal are in abundance on Lamb of God&#x27;s inaugural album. &quot;New American Gospel&quot; provides a mighty oak upon which gritty American metal&#x27;s faith is maintained, effectively bridging the &#x27;90s&#x27; insistence upon drill-sergeant technicality and the old school&#x27;s determined focus on riff construction.&quot; Chris Adler commented: &quot;This is a classic record. We had all the elements come together to make one of the heaviest, yet contagious records of our career. It was difficult to contain us—we didn&#x27;t even understand at the time what we had created.&quot;

Lamb of God toured for two years before releasing their third studio album, &quot;As the Palaces Burn&quot;, on May 6, 2003. Kirk Miller of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album three out of five stars, writing that &quot;unlike many of their overreaching, Slipknot-influenced contemporaries, Lamb of God deliver a meticulously crafted metal assault.&quot; The album was voted the number one album of 2003 by both &quot;Revolver Magazine&quot; and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;. The band was part of the first Headbangers Ball tour, where they recorded a DVD including live performances and a documentary, titled &quot;Terror and Hubris&quot;. The DVD was a success, debuting at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Music Videos chart.

===&quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot; (2004–2005)===
Lamb of God released &quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot; in August 2004. The album debuted at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and sold over 35,000 copies in its first week. The album was distributed through the band&#x27;s new record label, Epic Records. Johnny Loftus of Allmusic praised the album, saying &quot;With the genre getting clogged by PVC goofs and Alice in Chains impersonators, Lamb of God balances the equation of power, rage, tradition, and craft. It kills the filler.&quot; The title track of the album featured Testament guitarist Alex Skolnick and ex–Megadeth guitarist Chris Poland. &quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot; eventually became their first Recording Industry Association of America certified studio album, being awarded gold status in February 2016.

The band supported &quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot; with extensive touring, including a second stage slot on Ozzfest in 2004, and the 2005 Sounds of the Underground tour. The band was awarded 2nd Best Album of the Year by &quot;Revolver&quot; magazine behind Mastodon&#x27;s &quot;Leviathan&quot;, and was awarded Best Music Video for &quot;Laid to Rest&quot; (2005). While on tour, the band recorded a performance and released it with the name of &quot;Killadelphia&quot;. The release was made available as a DVD and a CD. The DVD was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2007.

In 2006, a cover version of the first single from the album, &quot;Laid to Rest&quot;, was featured as a playable track in &quot;Guitar Hero II.&quot; The original version was released for &quot;Guitar Hero Smash Hits&quot; in 2009. The original version is also available as downloadable content for &quot;Rock Band&quot;.

===&quot;Sacrament&quot; (2005–2007)===

In August 2006, Lamb of God released its fifth studio album &quot;Sacrament&quot;. The album debuted at number eight on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold nearly 65,000 copies in its first week of sales, nearly doubling the first week sales of &quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot;. The album received generally positive reviews, with Cosmo Lee of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; stating, &quot;&quot;Sacrament&quot; has the band&#x27;s most memorable songs to date. Musically, there&#x27;s no fat. The band plays with laser precision and songs move smoothly through riffs and transitions.&quot; Ed Thompson of IGN referred to &quot;Sacrament&quot; &quot;one of the best metal albums of 2006&quot;, and Jon Pareles of &quot;Blender&quot; called it a &quot;speed rush all the way through&quot;. &quot;Sacrament&quot; would become the band&#x27;s second gold record issued by the RIAA in September 2019.
The band appeared on major tours to support the album, including The Unholy Alliance with Slayer, Mastodon, Children of Bodom, and Thine Eyes Bleed, Gigantour, supporting Megadeth; main stage at Ozzfest; an appearance at the Download Festival, and an exclusive co-headlining tour with Killswitch Engage, Soilwork, and DevilDriver, where Killswitch Engage and Lamb of God shared headlining spots alternately each show. Lamb of God was nominated for Best Metal Performance at the 2007 Grammy Awards for &quot;Redneck&quot;, but lost out to Slayer&#x27;s &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot;.

In December 2007, the band rereleased the album as &quot;Sacrament: Deluxe Producer Edition&quot;. The release contained all of the original songs from &quot;Sacrament&quot; on the first disc, and the second disc was a CD-ROM featuring all of the vocal, bass, guitar, and drum tracks in 192 kbit/s MP3 format, enabling the buyer to produce their own interpretation of the songs. Blythe stated, &quot;you sometimes have to do something special to get kids to even buy an album these days rather than download it.&quot; The band took a break to write new material throughout 2008 and prepare a new record for release, slated for 2009. The band negotiated for a new record label to distribute records outside the United States. Chris Adler stated Epic Records in the United States &quot;couldn&#x27;t be more perfect&quot;, but wants a different label for international releases.

In spite of the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a sell-out show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a kilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the latter of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, but it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe down hard on the pavement beneath him, briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.

===&quot;Wrath &quot;(2008–2009) ===

On May 2, Lamb of God announced via MySpace their new DVD, &quot;Walk with Me in Hell&quot;, would be released on July 1, 2008. The DVD is a double-disc and has nearly five hours of footage, containing the feature documentary &quot;Walk with Me in Hell&quot; and multiple live performance extras from the Sacrament World Tour. In August 2008, it was announced, by studio producer Cole Higley, that the band had commenced work on the follow-up to Sacrament, and that its release was scheduled for February 2009. Josh Wilbur was also named as the producer for the record. They also toured with Metallica as a direct support act starting in December 2008. The recording process of the new record was made available to view online live through the band&#x27;s website, with two webcams installed in the studio (specifically in the drum room and mixing room).
On February 23, 2009, the band released their sixth studio album internationally via Roadrunner Records, titled &quot;Wrath&quot; and one day later in America via Epic Records. The album is dedicated to Mikey Bronsnan, who helped them get started in Philadelphia. In November 2008, Bronsnan was killed by a drunk driver. According to drummer Chris Adler, &quot;Without Mikey, we&#x27;d very well might not be a band today.&quot; Drummer Chris Adler was quoted saying &quot;This album is going to surprise a lot of people. Typically bands that get to where we are in our career begin to slack off, smell the roses and regurgitate. We chose a different path. No one wants to hear another band member hyping a new record. ‘Wrath’ needs no hype. We have topped ourselves and on February 24 you will feel it.&quot; &quot;Wrath&quot; debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number two, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week.

In support of Wrath, the band in spring of 2009 embarked on the first leg of their world tour, &quot;No Fear Energy Tour&quot; headlined by themselves with main support from Children of Bodom and As I Lay Dying, and rotating opening slots with God Forbid and Municipal Waste. The band played in Europe in the summer to perform with Metallica on the &quot;World Magnetic Tour&quot; along with Mastodon, while also playing headlining shows of their own and performing at major European festivals. For the final six dates of the tour, Unearth&#x27;s Buz McGrath filled in for Mark Morton, as he left early to be with his wife and his first child.

Lamb of God was announced to also serve as Metallica&#x27;s direct support for the North American leg of their 2009 world tour, as well as finishing the year off by headlining shows in Australia and New Zealand with Shadows Fall and DevilDriver.

===&quot;Resolution&quot; and Blythe&#x27;s arrest (2010–2013)===
Lamb of God performed for the first time in the Philippines for the annual PULP Summer Slam on April 17, 2010 with thrash metal band Testament and performed there again on February 18, 2012. The band also played in India for the first time on May 15, 2010, headlining the Summer Storm festival in Bangalore. They played for their Turkish fans at Kucukciftlik Park, Istanbul, on May 17. Lamb of God was featured on the 2010 Mayhem Festival, playing on the main stage alongside Korn, Rob Zombie, and Five Finger Death Punch. Paul Waggoner, guitarist for Between the Buried and Me, filled in for Lamb of God guitarist Mark Morton during the Mayhem Festival. In June 2010, the band played on the main stage at the Download Festival. It was their third appearance at Download Festival.

On April 19, 2010, IGN released a &#x27;making of&#x27; video that features Lamb of God working on their next single, &quot;Hit the Wall&quot;. The single is featured in the &quot;Iron Man 2&quot; video game. On February 15, 2011, Lamb of God announced that &quot;Hit the Wall&quot; would be available to buy via digital download. The band was also featured on the soundtrack for Namco Bandai Games&#x27; 2010 remake of &quot;Splatterhouse&quot;. Lamb of God was announced as one of the bands (the other being Baroness) to support Metallica on their Australian tour in late 2010.
In a September 2010 interview, drummer Chris Adler mentioned that Lamb of God will enter the studio in February 2011 to begin work on a seventh album. In November, Chris also mentioned that the band will work with producer Josh Wilbur again.

Lamb of God was nominated for a Grammy in 2010 for Best Metal Performance, but lost out to Judas Priest&#x27;s &quot;Dissident Aggressor&quot;. The band was once again nominated in 2011, at the 53rd Grammy Awards, but lost, this time to Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;El Dorado&quot;.

On October 31, 2011, it was announced that the band is set to release their seventh studio album, &quot;Resolution&quot;, on January 24, 2012. The band also revealed the album&#x27;s track list and cover art. On January 19, 2012, Lamb of God released a second music video for the single &#x27;Ghost Walking&#x27;, the first video being the lyric video. The video, which is completely animated, depicts a man fleeing from assassins in order to enter the abort codes for a large unidentified weapon. All the animation was completed by Moreframes Animation, and it was premiered on the music channel Vevo and YouTube.

In February 2012 Lamb of God played the Soundwave Festival in Australia and the Download Festival on the main stage in June.

On June 27, 2012, the Czech police arrested Randy Blythe for his actions during a 2010 concert in Prague. Blythe was charged, in the Prague 8 district court, with committing intentional bodily harm after an incident in which 19-year-old fan Daniel Nosek climbed up onto the stage with him. Blythe pushed the teen who then hit his head on the floor when he fell and later died of the injury. Lamb of God canceled their upcoming tour but resumed touring 38 days later when Blythe was released on bail. Blythe was indicted on the charges in December 2012. According to a verdict delivered by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, Blythe had thrown Nosek off the stage and had moral responsibility for the fan&#x27;s death but he was not criminally liable. The decision was appealed, and upheld by the Prague High Court in June 2013.

=== First hiatus, &quot;VII: Sturm und Drang&quot;, and &quot;The Duke EP&quot; (2014–2016) ===
Despite statements from band members that Lamb of God planned to enter the studio in 2014 to begin recording their eighth studio album, hoping to complete it by the end of the same year, Chris Adler said in an interview with &quot;The Virginian-Pilot&quot; that besides the large amount legal fees the band encountered from Randy Blythe&#x27;s trial, the band&#x27;s inactivity during the trial had eventually depleted the band&#x27;s funds and thus were unable to fulfill those plans.

On January 26, 2014, Randy Blythe posted a picture and a statement on his Instagram saying he would be taking a long break from Lamb of God. The band, after the then-current album cycle would be on hiatus, except for some summer festival appearances. By September, however, Blythe revealed that he was planning to release a new Lamb of God record, which uses lyrics he had written while he was incarcerated along with his book, &quot;Dark Days: A Memoir&quot; in early 2015.

The band began teasing a new album, with the placeholder title &quot;Lamb of God VII&quot; via Instagram and Twitter in late April 2015. A website, lambofgodvii.com, initially comprising an empty black screen, went online in early May. The &quot;VII&quot; (the roman numeral for the number seven) refers to the album being the band&#x27;s seventh, and does not take into account the first of their albums, released with a slightly different line-up as &quot;Burn the Priest&quot;. On May 15, 2015, it was announced that the title of the new album &quot;&quot;, and would be released in July via Epic and Nuclear Blast Entertainment. The first song, &quot;Still Echoes&quot; was made available for streaming on LambofGodVII.com, and available for digital download on May 18. In June of the same year, the band released a video for the song &quot;512&quot;.

On November 14, 2016, Lamb of God released a new EP titled &quot;The Duke&quot;, which featured two new songs from the &quot;&quot; recordings and three live tracks. The title track is dedicated to a fan and friend of vocalist Randy Blythe, Wayne Ford, who died after a five-year battle with leukaemia. In addition to the new release, several members of the band auctioned off their instruments, signed CDs, lyric books and gold records to raise money for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.

===Second Lamb of God hiatus and Burn the Priest cover album (2017–2018)===

On April 4, 2017, Blythe said it was time for the band to &quot;really go on hiatus&quot; after their summer North American tour; this was in reference to the first hiatus being on the back of his release from prison and acquittal. On August 10, guitarist Mark Morton confirmed that the band would be going on hiatus but stated that they would still be making music but did not hint at whether this was either for an upcoming release or indeed for Lamb of God at all.

On January 22, 2018, Lamb of God was announced as one of the bands supporting the Slayer Farewell Tour. On March 22, Lamb of God announced that on May 18, 2018, they would release a cover album, &quot;&quot; under their original name Burn the Priest. It is the band&#x27;s first album as Burn the Priest since their 1999 album.

On October 23, 2018, Lamb of God drummer Chris Adler was interviewed on the 486th Metal Injection Livecast and in the interview with Metal Injection he revealed that the band is aiming for a December 2019 release date for Lamb of God&#x27;s tenth studio album. He also revealed in the interview that he had a conversation with fellow heavy metal drummer Lars Ulrich of the band Metallica about what it was like to work with ex-Metallica guitarist and current Megadeth lead vocalist and guitarist Dave Mustaine prior to working with him on Megadeth&#x27;s 15th album, &quot;Dystopia&quot;, which was released in 2016.

=== Departure of Chris Adler, self-titled album, and &quot;Omens&quot; (2019–2023) ===

In 2017, Chris Adler was involved in a motorcycle accident that shattered his collarbone and right shoulder. While Adler had largely recovered to rejoin Lamb of God in time for its summer 2018 tour with Slayer, further complications from the injuries forced him to take a leave of absence from the band in July. Winds of Plague and former Prong drummer Art Cruz was brought in to replace Adler for the remainder of the tour. For several months, Adler&#x27;s future with the band was uncertain, with Blythe stating in a June 2019 interview that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to see what&#x27;s going to happen with [him].&quot; On July 19, 2019, the band released a statement declaring that they parted ways with Adler, with Cruz becoming his permanent replacement. They additionally stated that they had begun pre-production on their forthcoming 10th album. On October 23, 2019, Adler released his own statement about his departure from Lamb of God revealing that he &quot;did not make the decision to leave my life’s work&quot; and he &quot;is unwilling to paint by numbers&quot;.

On February 5, 2020, the band released &quot;Checkmate&quot; as the debut single from their self-titled album, &quot;Lamb of God&quot;, which marks the first song to feature Cruz. The album was initially planned to be released on May 8, but was postponed to June 19, 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Lamb of God toured in support of the album, including a co-headlining US trek with Megadeth in the summer and fall of 2021.

In a September 2020 interview with Australia&#x27;s Subculture Entertainment, Lamb of God guitarist Mark Morton was asked how he was spending his coronavirus downtime. He responded, &quot;Writing and recording and creating new music is my favorite part out of all the things we get to do. There&#x27;s a lot of elements, a lot of components about being in a band like Lamb of God. Performing and touring is one of them. Writing and recording is another one of them. The writing and recording part is far and away my favorite part of what we get to do. And so I have been doing some writing. I&#x27;ve been writing some stuff for Lamb of God, some stuff for other people, some stuff for my own solo project, so there&#x27;s a lot of new music jumping out of me right now.&quot;

On February 4, 2021, the band released a song called &quot;Ghost Shaped People&quot; off the upcoming deluxe version of their 2020 self-titled album. The reissue of the album was released on March 26, 2021. On April 1, 2022, the band released a cover of Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Wake Up Dead&quot; (1986). The cover also features Megadeth. For select dates throughout 2022, Phil Demmel filled in for both Willie Adler on guitar and John Campbell on bass.

Lamb of God&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Omens&quot;, was released on October 7, 2022, nearly four months after the release of its lead single &quot;Nevermore&quot;. The band supported the album by touring North America with Killswitch Engage and Europe with Kreator, Thy Art Is Murder and Gatecreeper throughout the fall and winter of 2022. They also opened for Pantera on the North American leg of their reunion tour during the summer of 2023.

=== Upcoming twelfth studio album (2024–present) ===
When asked in a February 2024 interview with the &quot;RRBG&quot; podcast about the next Lamb of God album, bassist John Campbell said: &quot;We&#x27;re gonna put out some records on the same rough schedule that we always do. We put out a record, tour the shit out of it, take a little time back, start working on another one, record it, tour the shit out of it. So, yeah, there&#x27;s definitely — we are still alive and kicking, and there will be more records. In the next five years, there will definitely be a new Lamb of God record. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m giving away any secrets with that.&quot;

==&quot;As the Palaces Burn&quot; documentary==
In February 2014, a documentary film featuring Lamb of God entitled &quot;As the Palaces Burn&quot; was released worldwide. The documentary, directed by Don Argott, began filming in 2012 and was set to focus on fans of the band but drastically altered its scope following the arrest of lead singer Randy Blythe on charges of committing intentional bodily harm stemming from the death of a fan following a concert in Prague two years earlier. The film has been met with positive reviews by critics.

==Musical style and influences==
Lamb of God is considered a significant member of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal movement, having been referred to as one of &quot;big four&quot; bands of the movement, along with Killswitch Engage, Shadows Fall and Unearth. The band is mainly considered a groove metal band. Their music has also been described as metalcore, thrash metal, and death metal. Lamb of God&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;New American Gospel&quot; has been described as &quot;grindcore and death metal for the hardcore kids&quot;. The band&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;Ashes of the Wake&quot; has been described &quot;to showcase their thrash and melodic death metal influences and break out of the metalcore category critics tried to push the band into.&quot; The band incorporated more thrash metal elements in later albums, which was shown as a direction on &quot;Wrath&quot; (2009) and &quot;Resolution&quot; (2012). &quot;Burn the Priest&quot; has been called a fusion of thrash metal, death metal and hardcore punk. The Burn the Priest cover album, &quot;&quot; has been described as crossover thrash, hardcore punk, punk rock and sludge metal.

Lamb of God&#x27;s influences include Pantera, the Accüsed, Septic Death, Drunk Injuns, the Faction, Black Sabbath, Obituary, Bolt Thrower, Corrosion of Conformity, Napalm Death, D.R.I., Machine Head, Shellac, At the Gates, Metallica, Testament, Slayer, Meshuggah, Megadeth, Aerosmith, and the Jesus Lizard. Although Lamb of God is a heavy metal band, the band&#x27;s vocalist Randy Blythe is a more avid fan of punk rock than heavy metal, and refuses to consider himself a &quot;metalhead&quot;.

<text>Beitou District is the northernmost of the twelve districts of Taipei City, Taiwan. The historical spelling of the district is Peitou. The name originates from the Ketagalan word &quot;Kipatauw&quot;, meaning witch. Beitou is the most mountainous and highest of Taipei&#x27;s districts, encompassing a meadow with rivers running through the valley which have abundant steam rising from them; the result of geothermal warming. The valley is often surrounded by mist shrouding the trees and grass. Beitou is famous for its hot springs. In March 2012, it was named one of the &quot;Top 10 Small Tourist Towns&quot; by the Tourism Bureau of Taiwan.

==History==
The area&#x27;s hot springs had long been enjoyed by the aboriginal people of Taiwan. Shortly before the Japanese period a German sulfur merchant established the first hot spring club in Beitou.

During early Japanese rule, &quot;Hokutō&quot; () was a village at the entrance of the well-known North Formosa sulfur district. Three Japanese extracting plants in this district produced about of sulfur monthly. The Japanese had already recognized the value of the village as a sanitary resort and constructed a Japanese inn with hot mineral baths provided by the sulfur springs. The hot springs have been developed to include aroma therapy, massage, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, and excellent cuisine which complement the entire spa experience. The mineral waters stream from the numerous geothermal vents that occur naturally in the region and are famous for their health benefits.

Between 1920 and 1941, was governed under Shichisei District, Taihoku Prefecture. It was upgraded to a Hokutō Town in 1941.

After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, it was renamed as &quot;Peitou&quot; urban township (), belonging to Taipei County. Beginning in 1949, &quot;Peitou&quot; and Shilin were administered by the newly formed Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau. Both of them were merged into Taipei City on 1 July 1968 as districts. In 1974, Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau underwent restructuring and Beitou District was placed under direct jurisdiction of Taipei City.

<doc id="676345" wikidata="Q7811968" url="?curid=676345" title="Toccoa/Ocoee River">
<text>The Toccoa River and Ocoee River are the names in use for a single river that flows northwestward through the southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States. It is a tributary of the Hiwassee River, which it joins in Polk County, Tennessee, near the town of Benton. Three power generating dams are operated along it.

The river is called the Toccoa for its through Georgia, until it reaches the twin cities of McCaysville, Georgia and Copperhill, Tennessee, at the truss bridge which connects Georgia 5 (Blue Ridge Street) with Tennessee 68 and Georgia 60 (Ocoee Street and Toccoa Street). The remainder is called the Ocoee through Tennessee. The Ocoee is known for its Class III-V whitewater rapids, appealing to kayakers and rafting enthusiasts. It is also home to the local salamander, &quot;Desmognathus ocoee&quot;. The upper section of the Ocoee was host to whitewater slalom events during the Centennial 1996 Summer Olympics held primarily in Atlanta, about to the south.

The name Ocoee originates from the Cherokee name for &quot;Passiflora incarnata&quot;, ocoee. Toccoa comes from a Cherokee word meaning &quot;Catawba place&quot; or &quot;beautiful&quot;.

On February 16, 1990 flooding of the river submerged much of the central business district of the riverfront towns of Copperhill, Tennessee and McCaysville, Georgia. The area was once heavily mined for copper ore from the Copper Basin and polluted by smelting operations. Extensive logging and plant-destroying smog depleted topsoil and released polluted acid and metals into the area&#x27;s streams. The area has since been cleaned and greened. Olympic kayaker Joe Jacobi led a successful effort to bring the Atlanta Olympic white-water event to the Ocoee River in 1996, and his wife Lisa, a former CNN news producer, left her job to open a downtown bed-and-breakfast and become a local internet entrepreneur.

==Dams and power generation==

The Ocoee&#x27;s flow is controlled by the Tennessee Valley Authority via three dams. Most often the riverbed is nearly dry in the ten-mile (16 km) stretch used for sporting, the water being diverted through flumes along the side of the river gorge. The dam was originally built in 1913 by the East Tennessee Power Company to provide hydroelectric power to the new Alcoa company, which was starting aluminum production operations in Blount County, Tennessee, south of Knoxville.

The three Ocoee dams are numbered sequentially, with #1 being the farthest downstream and #3 being the farthest upstream. TVA acquired the two original dams (Ocoee #1 and Ocoee #2) in 1939 and started building Ocoee #3 dam in 1940. These dams generate an average of 67,000 kilowatts of electricity in total. The Ocoee #2 dam diverts water from the middle section of the river through the flume. After a rock slide in September 1976 that damaged the flume, the TVA began a major overhaul of the flume system. During this time, the river, which had been dry during the early years of recreational whitewater sports, ran without diversion. The Ocoee gained the attention of paddlers and rafting companies who offered rafting trips to the public while the repairs were taking place. When the flume overhaul was finished, the Ocoee River Council was formed in order to secure future recreational releases from the TVA. After an extensive legal battle requiring an act of Congress, recreational releases were conceded by the TVA and the river runs most weekends from March through October. The Middle Section contains some 20 named Class III and IV rapids and provides recreational opportunities throughout its eight-month season. One of the largest rapids on the Middle Ocoee, &quot;Hell&#x27;s Hole,&quot; runs right beneath the bridge leading to the power station, with &quot;Powerhouse&quot;, a significant ledge with a strong hydraulic, right after it. Upstream (to the southeast), TVA also operates Blue Ridge Dam, which creates Lake Blue Ridge (called Blue Ridge Reservoir by TVA).

==Whitewater kayaking and rafting==
The Canoe slalom events during the 1996 Summer Olympics were conducted on a half-mile Olympic whitewater course that is fed by releases of water from Ocoee #3. The Ocoee Whitewater Center was built by the U.S. Forest Service for this purpose, including a large building along U.S. 64, whose eastbound lanes were originally built for traffic which are now converted to be used as a parking and staging area. A 4.5-mile whitewater rafting area farther downstream is fed by water released from Ocoee Dam #2. The Olympic section was not open to the public until after the Olympics, while the middle section had been open to the public since the late 1970s. After the Olympics, rafting tours (including bus transportation) are provided by several different companies located in both directions on U.S. 64, which runs next to the river for a few miles (several kilometers). These outfitters provide other activities on and along the river such as biking, hiking, kayaking and lodging. Whitewater rafting is the most popular and is led by trained river guides through a number of rapids.

==Variant names==
The river was once known as the Ocowee River and, according to the Geographic Names Information System, the Toccoa/Ocoee River has also been known as:
*Taccoy River 
*Tacoy River

<text>Patrick Floyd Jarvis Garrett (June 5, 1850February 29, 1908) was an American Old West lawman, bartender and customs agent known for killing Billy the Kid. He was the sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico, as well as Doña Ana County, New Mexico.

==Early years==
Patrick Floyd Jarvis Garrett was born on June 5, 1850, in Chambers County, Alabama. He was the second of five children born to John Lumpkin Garrett and his wife Elizabeth Ann Jarvis. Garrett&#x27;s four siblings were Margaret, Elizabeth, John, and Alfred. Garrett was of English ancestry, and his ancestors migrated to America from the English counties of Hertfordshire, Northamptonshire, Bedfordshire, Lincolnshire and Buckinghamshire. When Pat was three years old his father purchased the John Greer plantation in Claiborne Parish, Louisiana. The Civil War, however, destroyed the Garrett family&#x27;s finances. Their mother died at the age of 37 on March 25, 1867, when Garrett was 16. The following year, on February 5, 1868, his father died at age 45. The children were left with a plantation that was more than $30,000 in debt. The children were taken in by relatives. The 18-year-old Garrett headed west from Louisiana on January 25, 1869.

=== Buffalo hunter ===
Garrett&#x27;s whereabouts over the next seven years are obscure. By 1876 he was in Texas hunting buffalo. During this period Garrett killed his first man, another buffalo hunter named Joe Briscoe. Garrett surrendered to the authorities at Fort Griffin, Texas, but they declined to prosecute. When buffalo hunting declined, Garrett left Texas and rode to New Mexico Territory. When Garrett arrived at Fort Sumner, New Mexico, he found work as a bartender, then as a cowboy for Pedro Menard &quot;Pete&quot; Maxwell.

=== Family life ===
Garrett&#x27;s first wife was Juanita Martinez (born May 1860 in Taos, New Mexico). Garrett and Juanita married in the fall of 1879. Tom O&#x27;Folliard, Charlie Bowdre and Billy the Kid, among others, attended the wedding. As guests watched Garrett and his wife dancing at a celebration of their recent wedding, she collapsed, dying the next day. She was 19. She was interred in Fort Sumner Cemetery.

The reference Leon C. Metz made about Juanita being the older sister of Pat&#x27;s second wife Apolonia is unfounded. Apolonia had only one sister by the name of Celsa Gutierrez. On January 14, 1880, Garrett married Apolinaria Gutierrez. Between 1881 and 1905 Apolinaria Garrett gave birth to eight children: Ida, Dudley, Elizabeth, Annie, Patrick, Pauline, Oscar, and Jarvis.

=== Pursuit of Billy the Kid ===

Billy the Kid, William Henry Bonney Jr, born Henry McCarty was wanted for murder in the aftermath of the Lincoln County War. On November 2, 1880, Garrett was elected sheriff of Lincoln County, New Mexico, having defeated the incumbent, Sheriff George Kimball, by a vote of 320 to 179. Although Garrett&#x27;s term would not begin until January 1, 1881, Sheriff Kimball appointed him a deputy sheriff for the remainder of Kimball&#x27;s term. Garrett also obtained a deputy U.S. Marshal&#x27;s commission, which allowed him to pursue the Kid across state lines. Garrett and his posse stormed the Dedrick ranch at Bosque Grande on November 30, 1880. They expected to find the Kid there, but only succeeded in capturing John Joshua Webb, who had been charged with murder, along with an accused horse thief named George Davis. Garrett turned Webb and Davis over to the sheriff of San Miguel County a few days later, and moved on to the settlement of Puerto de Luna. There a local tough named Mariano Leiva picked a fight with Garrett and was shot in the shoulder.

On December 19, 1880, Billy the Kid, Charlie Bowdre, Tom Pickett, Billy Wilson, Dave Rudabaugh, and Tom O&#x27;Folliard rode into Fort Sumner. Lying in wait were deputy Garrett and his posse. Mistaking O&#x27;Folliard for the Kid, Garrett&#x27;s men opened fire and killed O&#x27;Folliard. Billy and the others escaped unharmed. Three days later, Garrett&#x27;s posse cornered Billy and his companions at a spot called Stinking Springs. They killed Bowdre and captured the others. On April 15, 1881, Billy the Kid was sentenced to hang by Judge Warren Bristol, but escaped thirteen days later, killing two deputies.

On July 14, 1881, Garrett visited Fort Sumner to question a friend of the Kid&#x27;s about his whereabouts and learned he was staying with a common friend, Pedro Menard &quot;Pete&quot; Maxwell. Around midnight, Garrett went to Maxwell&#x27;s house. The Kid was asleep in another part of the house, but woke up in the middle of the night and entered Maxwell&#x27;s bedroom, where Garrett was standing in the shadows. The Kid did not recognize the man standing in the dark. He asked him, repeatedly, &quot;¿Quién es?&quot; (&quot;Who is it?&quot;), and Garrett replied by shooting at him twice. The first shot hit the Kid in the chest just above the heart, while the second missed. Garrett&#x27;s account leaves it unclear whether Billy was killed instantly or took some time to die.

=== Account of Billy the Kid ===
He coauthored &quot;The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid&quot; with Ash Upson, and for decades his book was deemed authoritative.

Following Billy the Kid&#x27;s death, writers quickly went to work producing books and articles that made a folk hero out of him, while making Garrett seem like an assassin. Although filled with many errors of fact, &quot;The Authentic Life&quot; served afterward as the main source for most books written about the Kid until the 1960s. A failure when originally released, an original copy of the Pat Garrett–Ash Upson book became a rare commodity; in 1969 the original 1882 edition of the Garrett–Upson book was described by Ramon F. Adams as being &quot;exceedingly rare&quot;. Twentieth-century editions of Garrett&#x27;s &quot;Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid&quot; (with alterations to the original title) appeared in 1927, 1946 and 1964.

=== Texas Ranger ===
Garrett did not seek re-election as sheriff of Lincoln County in 1882. He moved to Texas, where he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the state senate. Garrett became a captain with the Texas Rangers for less than a month, then returned to Roswell, New Mexico.

== Middle years ==

=== Irrigation investments and move to Texas ===
Garrett discovered a large reservoir of artesian water in the Roswell region and went into partnership with two men to organize the &quot;Pecos Valley Irrigation and Investment Company&quot; on July 18, 1885. Garrett kept his irrigation schemes alive for several years, and on January 15, 1887, he purchased a one-third interest in the &quot;Texas Irrigation Ditch Company&quot;, but the partners got rid of him. On August 15, 1887, he formed a partnership with William L. Holloman in the &quot;Holloman and Garrett Ditch Company&quot;. All of Garrett&#x27;s forays into the irrigation field, however, resulted in failure. By 1892, Garrett had moved his large family to Uvalde, Texas, where he became a close friend of John Nance Garner (1868–1967), a future vice president of the United States. Garrett might have lived out the remainder of his life in Uvalde, had it not been for a headline-making event back in New Mexico.

=== Disappearance of Albert Jennings Fountain ===
On January 31, 1896, Colonel Albert Jennings Fountain and his eight-year-old son Henry disappeared at the edge of the White Sands area of southern New Mexico. Neither of the Fountains were ever seen again. The mystery was never officially solved, even with the efforts of Apache scouts, the Pinkertons, and an all-out push by the Republican Party. In April 1896, Garrett was appointed sheriff of Doña Ana County, and two years later had gathered sufficient evidence to make arrests, asking a judge in Las Cruces for warrants to arrest Oliver M. Lee, William McNew, Bill Carr and James Gililland. Within hours, he had arrested McNew and Carr.

During the early morning hours of July 12, 1898 Garrett and his posse confronted Oliver M. Lee and James Gililland at a spot called &quot;Wildy Well&quot; near Orogrande, New Mexico. Garrett had hoped to capture the fugitives while they were sleeping, but Lee and Gililland expected trouble and took their bedrolls up to the roof of the bunkhouse to avoid being taken by surprise. One of Garrett&#x27;s deputies named Kearney heard footsteps on the roof, scaled a ladder, and was mortally wounded by the fugitives. A stray shot nicked Garrett. Due to his concern for his dying deputy, Garrett arranged a truce with the fugitives and withdrew while Kearney was lifted into a wagon. Kearney, however, died on the road to Las Cruces, and Lee and Gililland remained at large for another eight months, before they finally surrendered to Sheriff George Curry. They were found not guilty in the Fountain killings, and the indictments for killing the deputy were also dismissed.

=== Final kill ===
Garrett killed his last offender in 1899, a fugitive named Norman Newman, who was wanted for murder in Greer County, Oklahoma. Newman was hiding out at the San Augustin Ranch in New Mexico. Sheriff George Blalock of Greer County went to New Mexico and asked Garrett for his assistance. The lawmen and Jose Espalin, one of Garrett&#x27;s deputies, rode to the ranch, and on October 7, 1899, Newman was killed in a gunfight.

=== Presidential appointment in El Paso ===
On December 16, 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt nominated Garrett to the post of collector of customs in El Paso. He also became one of President Roosevelt&#x27;s three &quot;White House Gunfighters&quot; (Bat Masterson and Ben Daniels being the others). Despite public outcry over his appointment, Garrett was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 2, 1902. Garrett&#x27;s tenure as El Paso&#x27;s collector of customs was stormy from the start. On May 8, 1903, he got into a public fistfight with an employee named George Gaither. The following morning, both Garrett and Gaither paid five dollar fines for disturbing the peace. Continued complaints about Garrett&#x27;s alleged incompetence were sent to Washington. Through it all, President Roosevelt stood by Garrett. As a show of his support, Roosevelt invited Garrett to attend a Rough Riders reunion being held in San Antonio during April 1905. Since Garrett had not been a member of that regiment, Roosevelt&#x27;s invitation was taken as a snub at those critics who wanted Garrett replaced from his post. Garrett brought a guest of his own to the event named Tom Powers. Garrett introduced Powers to the president as &quot;a prominent Texas cattleman.&quot; Garrett and Powers posed for two photographs with Roosevelt, first standing with him in a group and later seated with Roosevelt at dinner. Garrett&#x27;s enemies obtained copies of the photos and sent them to Roosevelt, informing the president that instead of being the &quot;cattleman&quot; that Garrett claimed, Powers was, in fact, the owner of a &quot;notorious dive&quot; in El Paso called the Coney Island Saloon. That was the final straw for Roosevelt, who replaced Garrett with a new collector of customs on January 2, 1906.

== Late years ==

=== Financial problems ===
Following his dismissal, Garrett returned with his family to New Mexico. Garrett was in deep financial difficulty. His ranch had been heavily mortgaged, and when he was unable to make payments, the county auctioned off all of Garrett&#x27;s personal possessions to satisfy judgments against him. The total from the auction came to $650. President Roosevelt had appointed Pat&#x27;s friend George Curry as the territorial governor of New Mexico. Garrett met with Curry, who promised him the position of superintendent of the territorial prison at Santa Fe, once he was inaugurated. Since Curry&#x27;s inauguration was still months away, the destitute Garrett left his family in New Mexico and returned to El Paso, where he found employment with the real estate firm of H.M. Maple and Company. During this period Garrett moved in with a woman known as &quot;Mrs. Brown&quot;, who was described as an El Paso prostitute. When Governor-elect Curry learned of his involvement with Brown, the promised appointment of prison superintendent was withdrawn.

=== Last conflict and death ===
Dudley Poe Garrett, Pat&#x27;s son, had signed a five-year lease for his Bear Canyon Ranch with Jesse Wayne Brazel. Garrett and his son objected when Brazel began bringing in large herds of goats, which were anathema to cattlemen like Garrett. Garrett tried to break the lease when he learned that the money for Brazel&#x27;s operation had been put up by his neighbor, W. W. &quot;Bill&quot; Cox. He was further angered when he learned that Archie Prentice &quot;Print&quot; Rhode was Brazel&#x27;s partner in the huge goat herd. When Brazel refused, the matter went to court. At this point James B. Miller met with Garrett to try to solve the problem. Miller met with Brazel, who agreed to cancel his lease with Garrett – provided a buyer could be found for his herd of 1,200 goats. Carl Adamson, who was related to Miller by marriage, agreed to buy the 1,200 goats. Just when the matter seemed resolved, Brazel claimed that he had &quot;miscounted&quot; his goat herd, claiming there were actually 1,800 – rather than his previous estimate of 1,200. Adamson refused to buy that many goats, but agreed to meet with Garrett and Brazel to see if they could reach some sort of agreement.

Garrett and Carl Adamson rode together, heading from Las Cruces, New Mexico, in Adamson&#x27;s wagon. Brazel appeared on horseback along the way. Garrett was shot and killed, but exactly by whom remains the subject of controversy. Brazel and Adamson left the body by the side of the road and returned to Las Cruces, where Brazel surrendered to Deputy Sheriff Felipe Lucero. More than thirty years later, Lucero claimed that Brazel exclaimed, &quot;Lock me up. I&#x27;ve just killed Pat Garrett!&quot; Brazel then pointed to Adamson and said, &quot;He saw the whole thing and knows that I shot in self-defense.&quot; Lucero incarcerated Brazel, summoned a coroner&#x27;s jury, and rode to Garrett&#x27;s death site. Brazel&#x27;s trial for Garrett&#x27;s murder concluded on May 4, 1909. Brazel was represented at his trial by attorney and future Secretary of the Interior Albert Bacon Fall. The only eyewitness to Garrett&#x27;s murder, Adamson, never appeared at the trial, which lasted only one day and ended with an acquittal.

=== Identity of the murderer ===
The coroner&#x27;s report on Garrett&#x27;s death states that Brazel shot Garrett. Brazel reportedly confessed, but was acquitted at trial. Four other suspects have been proposed: Adamson, Cox, Rhode, and Miller. In a book published in 1970, Glenn Shirley gave his reasons for naming Miller as the killer of Pat Garrett. Leon C. Metz in his 1974 biography of Garrett related the claim of W. T. Moyers that &quot;his investigations led him to believe that [W. W.] Cox himself ambushed and killed Garrett,&quot; but also wrote that &quot;[t]he Garrett family believes that Carl Adamson pulled the trigger.&quot; In his 2010 book on Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett, Mark Lee Gardner suggests that Archie Prentice &quot;Print&quot; Rhode killed Garrett.

===Death site===

The site of Garrett&#x27;s death is now commemorated by a historical marker south of U.S. Route 70, between Las Cruces, New Mexico and the San Augustin Pass. The historical marker is located about 1.2 miles from where Garrett was murdered. In 1940 his son, Jarvis Garrett, marked the spot with a monument consisting of concrete laid around a stone with a cross carved in it. The cross is believed to be the work of Garrett&#x27;s mother. Scratched in the concrete is &quot;P. Garrett&quot; and the date of his killing. The marker is located in the desert. In 2020, the city of Las Cruces revealed plans for a development that would destroy the site. An organization called Friends of Pat Garrett has been formed to ensure that the city preserves the site and marker.

=== Funeral and burial site ===
At six feet five inches, Garrett&#x27;s body was too tall for any finished coffins available, so a special one had to be shipped in from El Paso. His funeral service was held March 5, 1908, and he was laid to rest next to his daughter, Ida, who had died in 1896 at the age of fifteen. Garrett&#x27;s grave and the graves of his descendants are in the Masonic Cemetery, Las Cruces.

<doc id="676357" wikidata="Q605846" url="?curid=676357" title="Asian fairy-bluebird">
<text>The Asian fairy-bluebird (Irena puella) is a medium-sized, arboreal passerine bird. This fairy-bluebird is found in forests across tropical southern Asia, Indochina and the Greater Sundas. Two or three eggs are laid in a small cup nest in a tree. It was described by British ornithologist John Latham in 1790. The only other member of the genus and family is the Philippine fairy-bluebird, &quot;I. cyanogastra&quot;, which replaces the Asian fairy-bluebird in most of the Philippines. Both species are considered as sacred to the Tagalog people as they are perceived as tigmamanukan omens.

The adult Asian fairy bluebird is about . The male has glossy, iridescent blue upperparts, and black underparts and flight feathers. The female and first year male are entirely dull blue-green.

The Asian fairy bluebird eats fruits, nectar and some insects. Its call is a liquid two note &quot;glue-it&quot;.

==Description==
The Asian fairy bluebird measures in length. The iris is crimson and eyelids pinkish; the bill, legs and claws are black, and mouth a flesh- colour. Marked sexual dimorphism is evident. The male is a shining ultramarine-blue with lilac reflections on its upper plumage, lesser wing coverts, and under tail coverts, while the sides of its head and the whole lower plumage are deep black; greater wing-coverts, quills, and tail black, and some of the coverts tipped with blue, and the middle tail-feathers glossed with blue.

The upper plumage, the lesser wing coverts, and the lower tail coverts of the female are brownish blue, with the edges of the feathers brighter. The middle tail feathers and the outer webs of all the others, except the outer pair, like the upper plumage, and remainder of tail dark brown. primaries and secondaries dark brown. The greater wing coverts, primary coverts, and tertiaries dark brown, with a blue tinge on the outer webs. Sides of the head and whole lower plumage blue, very similar to the upper parts. The young resemble the female. The male changes into adult plumage in March, the change taking place without a moult. The feathers of the upper parts first become fringed with bright blue, then the tail coverts change, and finally the lower plumage changes. Young birds with the lower plumage mixed black and dull blue, and the upper plumage like that of the adult are frequently seen.

There are several subspecies, including &quot;I. cyanea malayensis&quot; from the Malay Peninsula, where the male differs in having the undertail coverts longer, nearly reaching to the tip of the tail.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Asian fairy bluebird is found in Sri Lanka and the western coast of India from Travancore up to the latitude of Shivamogga, Belgaum and Sawantwadi; Sikkim and the lower ranges of the Himalayas to Dibrugarh in Assam; the Khasi Hills; Cachar; Manipur; Bangladesh; Arrakan; Bago and Taninthayi Division in Burma; the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. In southeast Asia it occurs throughout most of Indochina (including Peninsular Malaysia), Sumatra, Borneo, Java and on smaller nearby islands. In the Indian part of its range this species is confined to the evergreen forests of the hills and plains, but elsewhere it is regular in various types of humid and deciduous forests from lowlands up to about . The species has been reported to be more frequent in mature rainforests and in rustic cardamom plantations under native shade trees than in coffee plantations.

The subspecies known from Palawan is now thought to be a distinct species, the Palawan fairy-bluebird (&quot;I. tweeddalii&quot;).

==Behaviour and ecology==
This bird is common in most of the tracts it frequents, going about in small parties or in pairs.
===Breeding===
It breeds from February to April, constructing a shallow cup-shaped nest, sometimes of moss and sometimes of small twigs, in a sapling or small tree. The eggs, which are generally two in number, are greenish white marked with brown, and measure about 1.14 cm by .77 cm.

===Feeding===
It feeds principally on fruit and is generally found on the larger forest-trees.

<text>A paraprosdokian (), or [[par&#x27;hyponoian]], is a figure of speech in which the latter part of a sentence, phrase, or larger discourse is surprising or unexpected in a way that causes the reader or listener to reframe or reinterpret the first part. It is frequently used for humorous or dramatic effect, sometimes producing an anticlimax. For this reason, it is extremely popular among comedians and satirists, such as Groucho Marx.

==Etymology==
&quot;Paraprosdokian&quot; derives from Greek &quot;&quot; &quot;against&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;expectation&quot;. The noun &quot;prosdokia&quot; occurs with the preposition &quot;para&quot; in Greek rhetorical writers of the 1st century BCE and the 1st and 2nd centuries CE, with the meaning &quot;contrary to expectation&quot; or &quot;unexpectedly.&quot;

While the word is now in wide circulation, &quot;paraprosdokian&quot; (or &quot;paraprosdokia&quot;) is not a term of classical (or medieval) Greek or Latin rhetoric; it was first attested in 1896.

==Double meaning==
Some paraprosdokians not only change the meaning of an early phrase, as in garden-path sentence, but also play on the double meaning of a particular word, creating a form of syllepsis or antanaclasis (a type of pun).

For example, in response to the question &quot;how are you two?&quot;, a Modern Hebrew speaker can say (&quot;be-séder gamúr; hi be-séder, aní gamúr&quot;), literally &quot;in-order complete; she in-order, I complete&quot;, i.e., &quot;We are very good. She is good, I am finished&quot;. Note the ambiguity of the Hebrew lexical item גמור &quot;gamúr&quot;: it means both &quot;complete&quot; and &quot;finished&quot;. A parallel punning paraprosdokian in English is a man&#x27;s response to a friend&#x27;s question &quot;Why are you and your wife here?: A workshop; I am working, she is shopping.&quot;

==Examples==
* &quot;Take my wife—please!&quot; —Henny Youngman
* &quot;If I could just say a few words … I&#x27;d be a better public speaker.&quot; —Homer Simpson
* &quot;If I am reading this graph correctly—I&#x27;d be very surprised.&quot; —Stephen Colbert

<text>Targum Onkelos (or Onqelos; , &quot;Targūm ’Unqəlōs&quot;) is the primary Jewish Aramaic targum (&quot;translation&quot;) of the Torah, accepted as an authoritative translated text of the Five Books of Moses and thought to have been written in the early second century CE.

==Authorship==
Authorship of the Targum Onkelos is traditionally attributed to Onkelos, a famous convert to Judaism in Tannaic times (c. 35–120 CE). According to the Talmud, the essential content of Targum Onkelos was already known in the time of Ezra (immediately after the Babylonian captivity). However, it was later forgotten by the masses, and rerecorded by Onkelos.

While the Aramaic translation of the Torah is traditionally attributed to Onkelos, a translation of the Torah into Greek is mentioned in the Talmud as being made by Aquila of Sinope. However, most scholars hold these to be one and the same person. According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the Greek translation was made by Aquilas before he converted to Judaism, while the Aramaic translation was made after his conversion. This is said to have been under the direct guidance and instruction of the tannaim Joshua ben Hananiah and Eliezer ben Hurcanus. Indeed, the same biographical stories that the Jerusalem Talmud attributes to Aquila, the Babylonian Talmud attributes to Onkelos.

The overwhelming similarities between the biographies of Aquila and Onkelos has led many to conclude they are the same person. Zvi Hirsch Chajes identified the Aramaic &quot;Targum Onkelos&quot; as Aquila&#x27;s Greek translation, translated once again into Aramaic. Likewise, A.E. Silverstone (1931:73) has shown quite consummately that Aquilas wrote both the Greek and the Aramaic versions, insofar that &quot;both versions betray the same outstanding characteristics.&quot;

A modern scholar has argued that the Aramaic translation must date to the late fourth-early fifth centuries, due to reusing language from other midrashim composed at that time, and thus could not have been composed by Aquila/Onkelos, who lived in the second century. Others, dissenting, have concluded that Onkelos&#x27; Aramaic translation originated in Syria Palaestina in the first or early second centuries CE, but that its final redaction was done in Babylonia probably in the fourth or fifth century CE. Onkelos&#x27; revised translation became the official version used in translating the Torah on each Sabbath day, displacing the earlier Palestinian Aramaic traditions which had been widely used. The Babylonian Talmud refers to the Torah&#x27;s Aramaic translation (Targum Onkelos) as &quot;targum didan&quot; (&quot;our translation&quot;), as opposed to that of the more ancient Palestinian Targum. The earliest text samples (Exodus 15:9–12 in Hebrew-Aramaic) appear on two incantation bowls (5th–7th centuries CE) discovered at Nippur, Babylonia.

==Ritual use==
In Talmudic times, readings from the Torah within the synagogues were rendered, verse-by-verse, into an Aramaic translation. To this day, the oldest surviving custom with respect to the Yemenite Jewish prayer-rite is the reading of the Torah and the &quot;Haftara&quot; with the Aramaic translation (in this case, &quot;Targum Onkelos&quot; for the Torah and &quot;Targum Jonathan ben &#x27;Uzziel&quot; for the &quot;Haftarah&quot;). The custom to read the Aramaic Targum each Sabbath day in the synagogue during the weekly Torah lection was eventually abandoned by other communities, and eventually codified in the Shulhan Arukh (&quot;Orach Chaim&quot; §145:3) who did not encourage its practice, saying that they do not understand the meaning of its words.

Where the custom is to read the Aramaic Targum during the public reading of the Torah on Sabbath days, the story of Reuben and the second &quot;Golden Calf&quot; episode are read but not translated, as they involve shameful events. Similarly, the Priestly Blessing is read but not translated, since the blessings are only to be recited in Hebrew.

The reading of the Targum, verse by verse, in conjunction with the Torah that is read aloud on the Sabbath day is not to be confused with a different practice, namely, that of reviewing the entire &quot;Parashah&quot; before the commencement of the Sabbath, and which practice has its source in the Talmud, and which the codifiers of Jewish law have ruled as Halacha: &quot;A person should complete his portions of scripture along with the community, reading the scripture twice and the &quot;targum&quot; once (&quot;Shnayim mikra ve-echad targum&quot;).&quot; Here, the reference is to completing the reading of the &quot;Parashah&quot; at home or in the Beit Midrash, along with others, reading in tandem, during which reading each verse is repeated twice; once by the reader himself, followed by a repetition of the same verse by the entire group, and lastly by the initial reader himself who cites the Aramaic Targum of Onkelos.

The days in which the &quot;Parashah&quot; was read depended largely upon custom. Some had it as their custom to break down the reading into two days. Among Yemenite Jews, Wednesday mornings were given over to the first half of the &quot;Parashah&quot;, while Thursday mornings were given to the second half of the &quot;Parashah&quot;. Others read the entire &quot;Parashah&quot; on Thursday mornings, while others on Thursday nights.

==Methodology==
Onkelos&#x27; Aramaic translation of the Five Books of Moses is almost entirely a word-by-word, literal translation of the Hebrew Masoretic Text, with very little supplemental material in the form of aggadic paraphrase. However, where there are found difficult biblical passages, Onkelos seeks to minimize ambiguities and obscurities. He sometimes employs non-literal aggadic interpretations or expansions in his translated text, usually in those places where the original Hebrew is marked either by a Hebrew idiom, a homonym, or a metaphor, and could not be readily understood otherwise.

The translator is unique in that he avoids any type of personification, or corporeality, with God, often replacing &quot;human-like&quot; characteristics representing God in the original Hebrew with words that convey a more remote and impersonal sense. For example, &quot;my face&quot; (Heb. &quot;panai&quot;) is replaced by &quot;from before me&quot; , while &quot;beneath his feet&quot; is replaced by &quot;under his throne of glory&quot; , and &quot;The Lord came down upon Mount Sinai&quot; by &quot;The Lord manifested himself upon Mount Sinai&quot; . Samuel David Luzzatto suggests that the translation was originally meant for the &quot;simple people&quot;. This view was strongly rebutted by Nathan Marcus Adler in his introduction to his commentary to Targum Onkelos &quot;Netinah La-Ger&quot;. He often updates the names of biblical nations, coinage and historical sites to the names known in his own post-biblical era.

In matters of halakha, the targum entirely agrees with Rabbi Akiva&#x27;s opinions. Some authors suggest that Akiva provided for a revised text of the essential base of Targum Onkelos.

Some of the more notable changes made by Onkelos, in which he attempts to convey the underlying meaning of a verse, rather than its literal translation, are as follows:
* (Genesis 1:2) (Aramaic: וְאַרְעָא הֲוָת צָדְיָא וְרֵיקָנְיָא, in Hebrew characters) [= &quot;...and the earth was devastated and empty&quot;], instead of &quot;...and the earth was without form and void.&quot;
* (Genesis 2:7) (Aramaic: הות באדם לְרוּחַ מְמַלְלָא, in Hebrew characters) [= &quot;...and it became in man a speaking spirit&quot;], instead of &quot;...and man became a living soul.&quot;
* (Genesis 3:5) (Aramaic: וּתְהוֹן כְּרַבְרְבִין, in Hebrew characters), [= &quot;...and you shall be like potentates&quot;], instead of &quot;...and you shall be like gods.&quot;
* (Genesis 3:15) (Aramaic: הוּא יְהִי דְּכִיר מָה דַּעֲבַדְתְּ לֵיהּ מִלְּקדְמִין וְאַתּ תְּהֵי נָטַר לֵיהּ לְסוֹפָא, in Hebrew characters) [=&quot;...he (i.e. Eve&#x27;s offspring) shall remember what you (i.e. the serpent) did to him at the beginning, but you (i.e. the serpent) shall hold it against him at the end&quot;], instead of &quot;he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.&quot;
* (Genesis 4:16) (Aramaic: וּנְפַק קַיִן מִן קֳדָם יי&#x27; וִיתֵיב בַּאֲרַע גָּלֵי וּמְטֻלְטַל דַּהֲוָת חֲשִׁיבָא עֲלוֹהִי מִלְּקַדְמִין כְּגִנְּתָא דְּעֵדֶן, in Hebrew characters) [=&quot;And Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in a land of exiles and wandering, which was considered by him beforehand as the Garden of Eden&quot;], instead of &quot;Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod to the east of Eden.&quot;
* (Genesis 18:8) (Aramaic: וְהוּא מְשַׁמֵּשׁ עִלָּוֵיהוֹן תְּחוֹת אִילָנָא, in Hebrew characters), [= &quot;...and he waited upon them under the tree, etc.&quot;], instead of &quot;...and he stood by them under the tree, etc.&quot;
* (Genesis 20:13) (Aramaic: וַהֲוָה כַּד טְעוֹ עַמְמַיָּא בָּתַר עוּבָדֵי יְדֵיהוֹן, יָתִי קָרֵיב יְיָ לְדַחְלְתֵיהּ מִבֵּית אַבָּא, in Hebrew characters), [= &quot;And it was, when the people erred after the works of their hands, the Lord did bring me near to the fear of Himself, from [among] the house of my father...&quot;], instead of &quot;And when God caused me to wander from my father&#x27;s house, etc.&quot;
* (Genesis 20:16) (Aramaic: הָא יְהַבִית אֶלֶף סִלְעִין דִּכְסַף לַאֲחוּיִיךְ הָא הוּא לִיךְ כְּסוּת דִּיקָר חֲלָף דִּשְׁלַחִית דְּבַרְתִּיךְ וַחֲזֵית יָתִיךְ וְיָת כָּל דְּעִמִּיךְ וְעַל כָּל מָא דַּאֲמַרְתְּ אִתּוֹכָחְתְּ, in Hebrew characters) [= &quot;...behold, I have given to your brother one-thousand silver coins in specie. Lo! It is for you an honorable remittance, for my having sent [unto you] and having controlled you; and for my having seen you [in private] and everything that is with you, and how that you have been proven [to be honest] in all the things you have spoken&quot;], instead of &quot;I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to you a covering of the eyes, unto all that are with you, and with all other: thus she was reproved.&quot;
* (Genesis 22:14) (Aramaic:וּפְלַח וְצַלִּי אַבְרָהָם תַּמָּן בְּאַתְרָא הַהוּא. אֲמַר קֳדָם יי&#x27; הָכָא יְהוֹן פָּלְחִין דָּרַיָּא. בְּכֵין יִתְאֲמַר בְּיוֹמָא הָדֵין בְּטוּרָא הָדֵין אַבְרָהָם קֳדָם יי&#x27; פְּלַח, in Hebrew characters) &quot;And Abraham worshiped and prayed there in that place, and said before God, &#x27;Here shall coming generations worship the Lord.&#x27; Wherefore, it shall be said on that day, &#x27;In this mountain Abraham worshiped before God&#x27;.&quot;], instead of &quot;And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah-jireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.&quot;
* (Genesis 25:27) (Aramaic:וְיַעֲקֹב גְּבַר שְׁלִים מְשַַׁמֵּישׁ בֵּית אוּלְפָנָא, in Hebrew characters) [=&quot;...and Jacob was a wholly perfect man, attending the house of study&quot;], instead of &quot;...and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.&quot;
* (Genesis 27:13) (Aramaic:עֲלַי אִתְאֲמַר בִּנְבוּאָה דְּלָא יֵיתוֹן לְוָטַיָּא עֲלָך בְּרִי, in Hebrew characters) [=&quot;...Concerning me it was said in prophecy no curses will come upon you, my son, etc.&quot;], instead of &quot;...&#x27;Let your curse be on me, my son, etc.&quot;
* (Genesis 31:53) (Aramaic:וְקַיֵּים יעֲקֹב בִּדְדָּחֵיל לֵיהּ אֲבוּהִי יִצחָק, in Hebrew characters) [=&quot;...and Jacob made an oath by him whom his father Isaac feared&quot; (i.e. the God of his father, without naming Him)], instead of &quot;...and Jacob sware by the fear of his father Isaac.&quot;
* (Genesis 38:26) (Aramaic: וַאֲמַר זַכָּאָה, מִנִּי מְעַדְּיָא, in Hebrew characters), [= &quot;...and he said, &#x27;She is in the right. It is from me that she is pregnant&#x27;, etc.&quot;], instead of &quot;...and he said, &#x27;She has been more righteous than I&#x27;, etc.&quot;

<text>Onkelos ( &quot;ʾunqəlōs&quot;), possibly identical to Aquila of Sinope, was a Roman national who converted to Judaism in Tannaic times ( 35–120 CE). He is considered to be the author of the Targum Onkelos ( 110 CE).

==In the Talmud==

Onkelos is mentioned several times in the Talmud. According to the traditional Jewish sources, he was a prominent Roman nobleman, the son of a man named Callinicus ( &quot;Qəlūnīqūs&quot; or קַלִינִיקוּס &quot;Qalīnīqūs&quot;) and the sister of Titus, the Roman emperor. According to the midrash Tanhuma, he was a nephew of Hadrian, and not Titus. These claims have been questioned, as Hadrian&#x27;s sister, his only sibling, had a daughter, and the only known child of either of Titus&#x27; siblings to survive to adulthood was also a girl, later known as Saint Flavia Domitilla. This lack of mention of any other sibling, can easily be explained, that due to the conversion, his uncle had him expurgated from the historical record. Whether historical or not, the story goes that his uncle, the emperor, advised Onkelos to go out and find something that wasn&#x27;t worth much today but would be invaluable in the future. Onkelos found Judaism.

Onkelos&#x27; conversion is the subject of a story wherein he first consulted with the spirits of three deceased enemies of Israel to see how Israel fared in the next world. The first was his uncle Titus, who was blamed for the destruction of the Second Temple; the second was the seer Balaam, hired by Balak king of Moab to curse Israel; and the last was Yeshu, a name used for those who sought to lead Jews astray to idolatry, in particular an idolatrous former student of Joshua ben Perachiah in the Hasmonean period as well as Manasseh of Judah. (In later writings &quot;Yeshu&quot; is used for Jesus, but opinions differ over whether it can be understood this way in the Talmud.) Onkelos is said to have seen all of them subjected to humiliating punishments for harming Israel. However, while Titus and Balaam dissuade him from converting, Yeshu encourages him to join the Jewish people (prompting the Talmud to praise &quot;the sinners of Israel&quot;). The earlier Jerusalem Talmud gives the subject of these stories as Aquilas the proselyte, often understood as being a person other than Onkelos. The difficulty with this theory, however, is that the Jerusalem Talmud says explicitly that he (Aquilas the proselyte) translated the Torah under Eliezer ben Hurcanus and Joshua ben Hananiah. The Babylonian Talmud repeats the same oral tradition, but this time calls him by the name Onkelos the proselyte, which leads one to conclude that the name is a mere variant of &quot;Aquila&quot;, applied in error to the Aramaic instead of the Greek translation. This view is supported by Epiphanius of Salamis (4th century).

The following story about Aquila&#x27;s conversion appears in Midrash Rabbah:
After his conversion, the Talmud records a story of how the Roman emperor tried to have Onkelos arrested. Onkelos cited verses from the Tanakh to the first Roman contubernium, who then converted. The second contubernium was also converted, after he juxtaposed God&#x27;s personal guidance of Israel in the Book of Numbers to the Roman social hierarchy. A similar tactic was used for the third contubernium, where Onkelos compared his mezuzah to a symbol of God guarding the home of every Jew, in contrast to a Roman king who has his servants guard him. The third contubernium also converted and no more were sent.

==The Targum of Onkelos==

According to tradition, Onkelos authored the Targum Onkelos as an exposition of the &quot;official&quot; interpretation of the &quot;peshat&quot; (or basic meaning) of the Torah as received by rabbis Eliezer ben Hurcanus and Joshua ben Hananiah. This helped canonise the status of both Onkelos and his Targum in the Jewish tradition.

<text>Brennius was a legendary king of Northumbria, Scotland, and the Allobroges, as recounted in Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; (). He was the son of Dunvallo Molmutius and brother of Belinus, probably based upon one or both of the historical Brenni. He came to power in 390 BC.

==&quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot;==
===Claimant to the throne of Britain===
In an effort to win the crown of Britain, Brennius and Belinus waged war between each other to determine who should succeed their father. Many battles were fought between the two brothers until a time came when their friends intervened and a compromise was decided upon. Belinus became the King of the Britons with Brennius as King of Northumbria and Scotland.

Five years later, Brennius wed the daughter of the King of Norway without consulting Belinus. Belinus invaded Northumbria and seized Brennius&#x27;s land. Brennius heard of this violation and gathered a large Norwegian army together to sail for Britain. On the way, a fleet of ships under the King of Denmark attacked because the king wanted Brennius&#x27;s wife for himself. They fought in the open ocean and the two sides dispersed. The King of Denmark managed to capture the wife of Brennius but he then got lost and landed on Britain. Belinus captured the king and his brother&#x27;s wife. Brennius landed in Albany and demanded the return of all his lands and his wife. If not, he swore he would kill Belinus if they ever met in battle.

Belinus called to arms all of Britain against Brennius and the two armies met in the forests of Calaterium. The battle was fought ruthlessly and Belinus defeated the army of Brennius. Brennius fled to Gaul and Belinus became king over all the Britons.

===Duke of the Allobroges===
While in Gaul, Brennius travelled from king to king explaining his situation. All denied him help or protection until the Duke of the Allobroges, Segnius, befriended him. He became highly influential in the duke&#x27;s ranks and was given the duke&#x27;s daughter in marriage. The duke and all his men pledged to Brennius that if the duke produced no male heirs, Brennius would succeed him as leader of the Allobroges. The duke died within the year and Brennius became duke. He divided the treasures of the duke among the people and kept an open court to them all.

Soon after becoming duke, Brennius gathered together another army and made right of passage treaties with all the Gauls. Eventually, he invaded Britain with his army and met Belinus on the battlefield. Their mother, however, convinced Brennius to make peace, and the two brothers ruled their two realms in harmony with each other.

===Conqueror of Rome===
Following their unification, Belinus and Brennius merged their armies into one great one and invaded Gaul. After a year of warfare, the joint army managed to subject all the Frankish kingdoms in Gaul to their authority. Now with an even greater army, Belinus lead his great army to Italy and threatened to invade Rome. Outside Rome, the two consuls, Gabias and Porsenna, sued for peace and offered wealth, tribute, and hostages as a sign of their submission. Belinus and Brennius accepted and took their great army to Germany. Soon after this movement north, Rome broke the treaty and marched north, and Brennius went to fight the Romans while Belinus remained at war with the Germans (who were being helped by various other Italian troops).

Brennius traveled south and besieged Rome for three days until his brother came to his aid in the invasion. The Romans defended the city for many days and were successful in repelling the invaders. Finally, the two consuls put on armour and joined the men defending the city. They pushed the invaders back but Belinus was able to reform the lines and stop the attacks. Brennius and Belinus continued forward until the walls were breached and the Britons and Gauls invaded the city.

Brennius stayed in Rome and ruled ruthlessly for the rest of his days.

===Comments on historicity===
Rome was indeed captured by Brennus, a Gaulish chieftain, following the Battle of the Allia on 18 July 390 BC. Gabias and Porsenna are not mentioned in any Roman sources. The later is a namesake of Lars Porsena, a King of the Etruscan civilization who is believed to have fought against the recently founded Roman Republic in the decade of the 500s BC.

==Later tradition==
Brennius was mentioned by Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, in 1530, when the duke, while arguing in favor of the claims of the House of Tudor claims to imperial status, told Holy Roman Imperial ambassador Eustace Chapuys that Brennius had founded Bristol and conquered Rome.

His ghost appears (as Brennus) in the Jacobean play &quot;Fuimus Troes&quot; () where he inspires the Britons&#x27; defence against Julius Caesar&#x27;s invasion.

<doc id="676366" wikidata="Q6701022" url="?curid=676366" title="Luis R. Esteves">
<text>Major General Luis Raul Esteves (April 30, 1893 – March 12, 1958) was the first Puerto Rican and the first American citizen of Hispanic heritage to graduate from the United States Military Academy (West Point), and the founder of the Puerto Rico National Guard. Of his West Point class, that included Dwight Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, Joseph McNarney, James Van Fleet and George E. Stratemeyer, Esteves was the first to achieve the rank of general.

==Early years==
Esteves was born Luis Raul Esteves y Völckers in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico on April 30, 1893. His father and mother were also natives of Aguadilla. His father, Francisco Esteves Soriano had served in the Spanish Army and his mother, Enedina Völckers Van der Dijs, of German and Dutch descent, was a housewife. His father, had also served as mayor of Aguadilla. Esteves received his primary education in the local grammar school and went to high school in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico.

At the outbreak of the Spanish–American War, the Esteves Völckers family welcomed the Americans as an alternative to Spanish rule of the island. Esteves&#x27;s father wanted his son to continue the family military tradition and encouraged him to consider a military career. However, his mother had other plans. She wanted her son to become an engineer and to study in the United States. The family&#x27;s financial situation did not permit her to realize her dream.

Esteves saw a news advertisement announcing examinations for the entry into the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York and applied without his parents&#x27; knowledge. He passed the exam, was accepted to and eventually graduated from West Point, thus becoming the first Puerto Rican to do so.

==West Point==

While at West Point he tutored Dwight D. Eisenhower in Spanish, as a second language was required in order to graduate. In 1915, Esteves graduated with Eisenhower and Omar Bradley among his classmates, and was the first Puerto Rican graduate of the academy. He was later the first graduate of 1915, &quot;the class the stars fell on&quot;, to reach the rank of general. One of the problems that Esteves faced upon his graduation was that in order to become an officer in the U.S. Army he had to be a citizen of the United States and Puerto Ricans at the time were not. The War Department was able find a precedent when they remembered that during the American Revolutionary War, foreign officers like Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette and Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben were given commissions in the Continental Army. He obtained the rank of Second Lieutenant and was assigned to the 23rd Infantry Regiment, where he worked in the National Matches of Florida.

==Pancho Villa incident==
Esteves served as a 2nd lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Brigade of the U.S. Army under the command of General Pershing, when he was sent to El Paso, Texas during the &quot;Pancho Villa Incident&quot;. During the onset of the Battle of Columbus in June 1916, Esteves was promoted to first lieutenant. He was given charge of infantry units and assigned to protect bridges. From El Paso, he was sent to the town of Polvo, Mexico. After being transferred to the town of Polvo, the population named him mayor and judge during his stay.

==Puerto Rico National Guard==
Esteves was then promoted to the rank of captain. 
Esteves helped organize the 23rd Battalion, which was composed of Puerto Ricans and was stationed in Panama during World War I. Esteves was later assigned command of a machine gun company and a battalion. He was sent to Camp Las Casas and Henry Barracks in Puerto Rico and served as an instructor in the preparation of Puerto Rican Officers for the Porto Rico Regiment of Infantry (which in 1919 was renamed the 65th Infantry).

He saw a need for a Puerto Rican National Guard. Esteves pressured colonial governor Arthur Yager and the colonial legislature about the necessity of a local militia. His request was met with approval. The National Guard Bureau approved this initiative, and on July 19, 1919, the current incarnation of the PRNG was organized. In 1918, he was promoted to Major and by 1919, the first regiment of the Puerto Rico National Guard was formed. After the war, Esteves was sent to Washington, D.C., however his assignment there was cut short and he resigned his commission in the Regular Army because of a medical admonition that residence in a cold climate could have been fatal to his wife. Esteves joined the new entity on February 25, 1920, as commander of the First Battalion of the First Puerto Rico Regiment and its companies. On February 7, 1939, Esteves was named Adjutant General. He was responsible for funneling an increase of new recruits at Camp Tortuguero. In 1942, Esteves was given command of the temporary State Guard. 
On October 15, 1940, the Puerto Rico National Guard was activated pursuant to Executive Order 3551. Esteves was promoted to the rank of Brigadier General and ordered to active duty and given the command of the 92nd Infantry Brigade. He commanded the 92nd until he was summoned by José Miguel Gallardo the Interim Governor of Puerto Rico to organize a State Guard, with the Army&#x27;s approval, that in a short time consisted of nine well trained and equipped regiments. On June 22, 1946, Esteves was awarded with the Legion of Merit by the Military Department of the Antilles. During this time, he reorganized the Puerto Rico National Guard and held the position of Adjutant General until his retirement in June 1957.

On October 30, 1950, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party organized a series of uprisings in numerous cities in Puerto Rico against the United States rule and the Puerto Rican commonwealth government in what is known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s. The Puerto Rico National Guard was mobilized under the command of Esteves by orders of Governor Luis Muñoz Marín and U.S. Brigadier Gen. Edwin L. Sibert, and sent to confront the Nationalists in various towns such as Jayuya, Utuado and San Juan.

==Later years==
General Esteves&#x27; main hobby was studying military history. He also published two books, &quot;Los Barrabases&quot; and &quot;¡Los Soldados Son Así!&quot; (Soldiers are like that). In &quot;¡Los Soldados Son Así!&quot;, he tells about many anecdotes, jokes, and stories of the Boricua (Puerto Rican) soldiers, covering the period from when the ancient regiment from Puerto Rico was organized (which today is the 65 Infantry) up to the Second World War. He also authored &quot;Cosas de Viajero&quot; and &quot;Cosas de Soldados&quot;.

Esteves married Guadalupe Navarro, with whom he had four children, Raúl, Roberto, Maricel and Vernon. Esteves also helped establish the first two theaters in Aguadilla, his hometown, with the help of fellow community leader Juan Garcia. On April 30, 1957, Esteves retired from service due to health concerns. On March 12, 1958, Esteves died in Santurce as a complication of these issues. His remains are interred in Cementerio Histórico Urbano de Aguadilla. On August 24, 1958, the PRNG&#x27;s Armory was re-baptized in his honor. On May 11, 1962, Division General Juan Cordero dedicated a speech to him during the re-inauguration of the PRNG&#x27;s Military Museum.

The former Puerto Rico National Guard Armory in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico &quot;Gen. Luis R. Esteves&quot; and the street in front of the Puerto Rico National Guard&#x27;s headquarters in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico was renamed &quot;La Calle Gen. Esteves&quot; in his honor.
In 2017 General Esteves was posthumously inducted to the Puerto Rico Veterans Hall of Fame.

<doc id="676368" wikidata="Q726917" url="?curid=676368" title="Auckland Region">
<text>Auckland () is one of the 16 regions of New Zealand, which takes its name from the eponymous urban area. The region encompasses the Auckland metropolitan area, smaller towns, rural areas, and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf. Containing percent of the nation&#x27;s residents, it has by far the largest population and economy of any region of New Zealand, but the second-smallest land area.

On 1 November 2010, the Auckland region became a unitary authority administered by the Auckland Council, replacing the previous regional council and seven local councils. In the process, an area in its southeastern corner was transferred to the neighbouring Waikato region. Since then, the Auckland Council has introduced a system of local boards to divide the region for local government.

== Geography ==
On the mainland, the region extends from the mouth of the Kaipara Harbour in the north across the southern stretches of the Northland Peninsula, through the Waitākere Ranges and the Auckland isthmus and across the low-lying land surrounding the Manukau Harbour, ending within a few kilometres of the mouth of the Waikato River. It also includes the islands of the Hauraki Gulf. It is bordered in the north by the Northland region, and in the south by the Waikato region. The Hunua Ranges and the adjacent coastline along the Firth of Thames were part of the region until the Auckland Council was formed in late 2010, when they were transferred to the Waikato region. In land area the region is smaller than all the other regions and unitary authorities except Nelson.

The region&#x27;s coastline is long. It has about of rivers and streams, about 8 percent of these in urban areas. Its highest point is the summit of Little Barrier Island, at 722 metres.

=== Past administrative divisions ===
Prior to the merger into the Auckland Council on 1 November 2010, the Auckland region consisted of seven territorial local authorities (TLAs); four cities and three districts:

* Auckland City
* Manukau City
* North Shore City
* Waitakere City
* Franklin District
* Papakura District
* Rodney District

<doc id="676371" wikidata="Q2065923" url="?curid=676371" title="Targum Jonathan">
<text>The Targum Jonathan () is the Aramaic translation of the Nevi&#x27;im section of the Hebrew Bible employed in Lower Mesopotamia (&quot;Babylonia&quot;).

It is not to be confused with &quot;Targum Pseudo-Jonathan,&quot; an Aramaic translation of the Torah. It is often known as &quot;Targum Jonathan&quot; due to a printer&#x27;s error or perhaps because it is so stylistically similar to the Targum Jerusalem, which is named &quot;Jonathan&quot; to differentiate the two later translations.

== Origin ==

Like Targum Onkelos, it originated in the synagogue reading of a translation from the Nevi&#x27;im, which was part of the weekly lesson.

The Talmud attributes its authorship to Jonathan ben Uzziel, a pupil of Hillel the Elder, in Megillah 3a:4. According to this source, it was composed by Jonathan ben Uzziel &quot;from the mouths of Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi,&quot; implying that it was based on traditions derived from the last prophets. The additional statements that, on this account, the entire land of Israel was shaken and that a voice from heaven cried: &quot;Who has revealed my secrets to the children of men?&quot; are legendary reflections of the novelty of Jonathan&#x27;s undertaking and the disapprobation it evoked. The story adds that Jonathan wished to translate the Ketuvim, but a heavenly voice instructed him to stop. The Targum to the Book of Job, which was withdrawn from circulation by Gamaliel, nasi of the Sanhedrin, may have represented the result of his attempts to translate the Ketuvim.

Jonathan ben Uzziel is named as Hillel&#x27;s most prominent pupil, and the reference to his Targum is at least of historical value, so there is nothing to controvert the assumption that it served as the foundation for the present Targum to the Prophets.

It was thoroughly revised, however, before it was redacted in Babylonia. In the Babylonian Talmud it is quoted with especial frequency by Joseph, head of the Academy of Pumbedita, who writes concerning the two biblical passages Isaiah 8:6 and Zechariah 12:11, &quot;If there were no Targum to it we should not know the meaning of these verses&quot;. This shows that as early as the beginning of the fourth century the Targum to the Prophets was recognized as of ancient authority.

The targum is sometimes cited with the introduction &quot;Rav Yosef has translated&quot;, suggesting a tradition of authorship by Joseph bar Hama.

== Linguistic analysis ==

The language of Targum Jonathan is Aramaic. Its overall style is very similar to that of Targum Onkelos, though it sometimes seems to be a looser paraphrase of the Biblical text.

It is the result of a single redaction.

Like Targum Onkelos, it gained general recognition in Lower Mesopotamia in the third century, and from the Talmudic academies in Babylonia it was carried throughout the Diaspora. It originated, however, in Syria Palaestina but was adapted to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, so it contains the same linguistic peculiarities as the Targum Onḳelos, including sporadic instances of Persian loanwords. In cases where the Palestinian and Babylonian texts differ, the Onqelos follows the latter.

Although Targum Jonathan was composed in classical antiquity, probably in the 2nd century, it is now known from medieval manuscripts, which contain many textual variants. The earliest attestation appears as citations of Jeremiah 2:1–2 and Ezekiel 21:23 on an incantation bowl found in Nippur.

== Liturgical use ==
In Talmudic times, and still by Yemenite Jews, Targum Jonathan was read as a verse-by-verse translation alternately with the Hebrew verses of the haftara in the synagogue. Thus, when the Talmud states that &quot;a person should complete his portions of scripture along with the community, reading the scripture twice and the &quot;targum&quot; once&quot;, the passage may be taken to refer to the Targuma Jonathan and Onqelos.

<text>The Calgary Highlanders is a Canadian Army Primary Reserve infantry regiment, headquartered at Mewata Armouries in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The regiment is a part-time reserve unit, under the command of 41 Canadian Brigade Group, itself part of 3rd Canadian Division, one of four region-based Canadian Army divisions. The regiment is one of only two regiments in the Canadian Forces (with the Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary&#x27;s)) to wear an honorary distinction on their uniform, commemorating the counterattack at Kitcheners&#x27; Wood. On 9 January 2015, the regiment was recognized with the Canadian Forces&#x27; Unit Commendation for outstanding contributions to the war in Afghanistan.

==Badge==
The badge is based on that worn by the 10th Battalion, CEF, which the regiment perpetuates. Significantly, a St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross has been added to the design (this is not a representation of the Roman Numeral ten as is often erroneously reported).

The crown is of the reigning monarch; a Tudor Crown was used from the introduction of this badge until 1953, and the ascension of Queen Elizabeth II. The crown was then changed to a St. Edward&#x27;s Crown. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;King&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Queen&#x27;s&quot; Crowns. The beaver and maple leaves are representative of Canada and the scrolls bearing thistles are representative of Scotland. The City of Calgary grew out of Fort Calgary, established in 1875 and so named by Colonel James Macleod after Calgary, Scotland, a location near his sister&#x27;s home.

The badge appears not only as a cap badge, but is also seen on the regiment&#x27;s drums, as well as the drum major&#x27;s sash and regimental pipe banners.

==Lineage==

On 1 April 1910 the regiment was raised as the 103rd Regiment &quot;Calgary Rifles&quot;. In 1914 the 103rd contributed men to several battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force and the Highlanders officially perpetuate the 10th Battalion, CEF, 56th Battalion (Calgary), CEF and 82nd Battalion, CEF. The 103rd Regiment was reorganized on 15 March 1920 as two separate regiments, The Alberta Regiment (now The South Alberta Light Horse) and The Calgary Regiment as part of the Otter Committee reorganizations. On 15 May 1924 The Calgary Regiment was again reorganized and split into two separate regiments, The Calgary Regiment (now The King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment) and The Calgary Highlanders.
On 15 September 1921 The Calgary Regiment divided into six battalions, the 1st Battalion became the 1st Battalion, Calgary Highlanders, The Calgary Regiment. The 2nd Battalion, The Calgary Regiment later became the King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment. The 3rd, 4th and 5th battalions were paper units that were never formed; they disbanded in the 1936 reorganizations of the Militia.
On 15 May 1924, The Calgary Regiment reorganized as separate regiments.

The 10th Battalion (Canadians), CEF was authorized on 10 August 1914 and embarked for Britain on 29 September 1914. It disembarked in France on 14 February 1915, where it fought as part of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade, 1st Canadian Division in France and Flanders until the end of the war. The battalion disbanded on 30 August 1920.

The 56th Battalion (Calgary), CEF was authorized on 7 November 1914 and embarked for Britain on 20 March 1916. There it provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field until 6 July 1916, when its personnel were absorbed by the 9th Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion disbanded on 15 September 1917.

The 82nd Battalion, CEF was authorized on 10 July 1915 and embarked for Britain on 20 May 1916. There it provided reinforcements for the Canadian Corps in the field until 18 July 1916, when its personnel were absorbed by the 9th Reserve Battalion, CEF. The battalion disbanded on 21 May 1917.

The Calgary Highlanders perpetuate all three battalions.

===Second World War===
The regiment mobilized for active service as The Calgary Highlanders, Canadian Active Service Force (CASF) on 1 September 1939. The regiment trained in Calgary until the summer of 1940 when it departed for CFB Shilo, Manitoba. It was re-designated as the 1st Battalion, The Calgary Highlanders, CASF, on 7 November 1940. On 27 August 1940, it embarked for Britain. In September 1940, the 1st Battalion arrived in England. The Calgary Highlanders, CASF (Canadian Active Service Force) joined the Second Canadian Division there, and the 2nd Battalion was raised in Calgary for part-time service. The battalion&#x27;s mortar platoon took part in the Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942. On 6 July 1944, the battalion landed in France as part of the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade, 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, and it continued to fight in North-West Europe until the end of the war.

During the Dieppe Raid of August 1942, the mortar platoon commanded by Lieutenant FJ Reynolds was attached to the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade but stayed offshore during the raid. Sergeants Lyster and Pittaway were decorated with a Mention in Despatches for their part in shooting down two German aircraft during the raid, and one officer of the regiment was killed while ashore with a brigade headquarters.

Sergeant Clarence &quot;Ken&quot; Crockett, DCM, of the 1st Battalion, Calgary Highlanders, was nominated for the Victoria Cross for actions in September 1944 and instead received the Distinguished Conduct Medal.

The regiment selected the Battle of Walcheren Causeway for annual commemoration after the war. The overseas battalion disbanded on 15 December 1945.

=== Post War ===
The Calgary Highlanders continued to train infantry soldiers in the late 1940s and into the 1950s. In the 1960s, as nuclear tensions mounted between the United States and the Soviet Union, Militia units in Canada moved away from warfighting roles into national disaster training, a role not very well liked. By the 1970s, the Militia had once again focussed its training activities on war fighting.

In the 1980s, the regiment trained as mechanized infantry using the Grizzly Infantry Fighting Vehicle. Militiamen and even army cadets were routinely flown to NATO exercises in Germany, Norway and Alaska to participate in realistic training, as the perceived threat of Warsaw Pact military aggression was felt to be high. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, the emphasis on training throughout Force Mobile Command moved away from large-scale armoured formations fighting Soviet tank formations in central Europe. The Grizzlies were withdrawn by the mid-1990s and the regiment resumed training in a light infantry role.

Most significantly, The Calgary Highlanders have contributed hundreds of soldiers to peacekeeping missions in the years since 1945, including peacekeeping, peace enforcing, and observation missions in Cambodia, the Persian Gulf, the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia, and Sudan. Recently, they have contributed soldiers to the Canadian mission in Afghanistan, including the deployment in early 2008 of 55 soldiers.

===Presentation of colours 1990===
On 30 June 1990, Queen Elizabeth II presented the unit with a new queen&#x27;s colour at a Trooping the Colour ceremony held at McMahon Stadium in Calgary. The King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC), who shared the queen with the Calgary Highlanders as colonel-in-chief, was also on parade and performed a mounted march-past with their vehicles. The combined bands of the Calgary Highlanders, the King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment and Princess Patricia&#x27;s Canadian Light Infantry were also on parade.

The largest peacetime deployment of the regiment occurred during the 2013 Alberta floods when over 100 Calgary Highlanders were mobilized to assist the Calgary Emergency Management Agency with flood relief efforts.

===Afghanistan===
To qualify for a battle honour, CF units were required to contribute an aggregate of more than 20% of authorized strength to the various task forces which served in Afghanistan between 2002 and 2014. The regiment contributed over 100% of its strength, and was awarded the Canadian Forces&#x27; Unit Commendation for this achievement.

== Alliances ==
In the mid-1920s, the regiment formed an official alliance with The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s) of the British Army. In 2006, that affiliation officially ended as the Imperial Argylls were absorbed into the Royal Regiment of Scotland as the 5th Battalion. It is unclear if previous affiliations will be permissible between single battalions of the new regiment, or if any future affiliations will be with the regiment as a whole. In either event, all Canadian regiments now affiliated with British regiments scheduled for amalgamation will need to be renewed separately. The 5th Battalion has since been reduced to a single sub-unit called Balaklava Company and used primarily for ceremonial duties.

==Facts==
The Calgary Highlanders adopted many dress distinctions of the allied regiment in Scotland in the 1920s and continue to cherish those distinctions into the 21st century, including the red and white diced Glengarry worn by all ranks (except pipers), the badger head sporran worn by officers, warrant officers, and senior NCOs, the six-point horsehair sporran worn by junior NCOs (except pipers), and the striped necktie of the 2nd Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, also worn by officers, warrant officers, senior NCOs, pipers and drummers of The Calgary Highlanders. It is unclear if any of these dress distinctions will continue to be worn in Scotland now that The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise&#x27;s) have been amalgamated into the Royal Regiment of Scotland.

==History==

===1910–1938===
The regiment dates back to 1 April 1910 and the creation of the 103rd Regiment (Calgary Rifles), under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel William Armstrong. The regiment did not mobilize for the First World War; however, the 103rd Regiment contributed men to several overseas battalions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force beginning in 1914, including the 10th Battalion.

In 1921, the Canadian Militia was reorganized and the 103rd Regiment became simply &quot;The Calgary Regiment&quot;. The 1st Battalion of this new unit became known as the Calgary Highlanders. The regiment was permitted to perpetuate the history of the 10th Battalion, CEF, and inherited that units battle honours (granted in 1929) as well as inheriting the memory of two Victoria Cross holders, Acting Sergeant Arthur George Knight and Private Harry W. Brown, both of whom were awarded the VC posthumously in the last year and a half of the Great War.

The process for awarding battle honours for the First World War took over a decade, and The Calgary Highlanders were first awarded battle honours for the actions of the 10th Battalion, CEF, on 15 September 1929.

The official granting of battle honours to the 10th Battalion was not done until 15 October of the same year. There was also one minor change; while the Calgary Highlanders were granted &quot;Arras, 1917, &#x27;18&quot; as a battle honour, the 10th Battalion&#x27;s honour read only &quot;Arras, 1917.&quot;

While the overall battle of Saint-Julien was considered worthy of a battle honour, to the dismay of those regiments perpetuating the units involved, the counter-attack at Kitcheners&#x27; Wood was not. This counterattack, 22 April 1915, was thrown into the first German gas attack of the war. In recognition of this gallant effort and the persistence of the Winnipeg Light Infantry, the Calgary Highlanders and the Canadian Scottish, a special &#x27;honorary distinction&#x27; was granted by Order in Council No. 10, 1934, of a special oak leaf shoulder badge now unique in the Canadian armed forces, and worn only by those three regiments at the time of adoption in 1938, and today by only two units, The Calgary Highlanders and The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary&#x27;s).

===1939–1945===
The Calgary Highlanders pioneered battle drill for the Canadian Army, which was a realistic system of training infantry for the hardships of modern war. They themselves learned battle drill from the British 47th Division.

On 6 July 1944, one month after the Normandy landings, the regiment landed in France. In Operation Spring, the Calgary Highlanders were part of the Battle of Verrières Ridge, along with the Black Watch, in which the regiment took heavy casualties. The unit saw extensive action in Normandy, marched through Dieppe with the 2nd Division in September 1944 as liberators, then moved on to the fighting for the Channel Ports. By the end of September the regiment was in Belgium and forced a crossing of the Albert Canal, northeast of Antwerp.

The regiment saw extensive fighting in the Netherlands in October 1944, opening the way to South Beveland, and then west to the Walcheren Island Causeway where the brigade fought an extended battle beginning on Hallowe&#x27;en night.

From November to February 1945 the regiment wintered in the Nijmegen Salient, then was back in action in the Rhineland fighting, clearing the last approaches to the River Rhine itself. Fighting resumed on the far bank in March, and city fighting in Doetinchem and Groningen followed. The regiment ended the war on VE Day on German soil.

The Victory Campaign had cost The Calgary Highlanders over 400 men killed, from a war establishment of just over 800 men. Several times that many were wounded in action.
===History 2010 to present===
The regiment observed its centennial in 2010, an anniversary shared with its sister unit, The King&#x27;s Own Calgary Regiment, as well as fellow unit in the Calgary garrison, 14 (Calgary) Service Battalion, as well as the Canadian Navy (represented in Calgary by ). The centennial was marked by several unique events, including the last ever military parade at Currie Barracks in Calgary, and an overseas pilgrimage to battlefield sites and places of regimental significance which included the dedication of plaques at Hill 67 and Clair Tison. Also originally part of the centennial events was the announcement of a Calgary Soldiers&#x27; Memorial, which was later dedicated on the anniversary of the battle of Vimy Ridge in 2011. In May 2014, the regiment was awarded the Battle Honour &quot;Afghanistan.&quot; As part of Canada&#x27;s role in the Afghanistan War, the regiment deployed over 100 soldiers to the theatre as individual augmentees and on other assignments with the Regular Force, to a total of 126 separate tours of duty. One officer of the regiment was Mentioned in Despatches and others were recognized by commendations. The Regiment was awarded the Battle Honour &quot;Afghanistan&quot; on 9 May 2014. The unit received the Canadian Forces&#x27; Unit Commendation on 9 January 2015.

===Lineage chart===









==Uniform==
In addition to the cap badge and oak leaf shoulder titles mentioned above, the regiment wears several other notable distinctions of dress.

;Headdress
The red and white diced glengarry of the Argylls is worn by all ranks (except pipers, who wear black). In combat dress, the khaki tam o&#x27;shanter is worn by junior NCMs with the balmoral worn by senior NCMs and officers. A cap badge in yellow metal is worn by trained privates who are not yet infantry qualified. Infantry qualified junior NCMs wear a bronze cap badge, and senior NCMs, officers, and pipe band musicians all wear a nickel-plated cap badge. Tradesmen wear the badge of their branch, as appropriate.

;Ceremonial dress
The theoretical full dress uniform for the regiment would be a scarlet jacket and feather bonnet; this uniform has never been worn in actuality. The regiment did adopt a green coatee in the 1950s, and has retained it as the standard ceremonial uniform; they are worn only by the regimental colour party or by small parties for special occasions (such as weddings, etc.). The Pipes and Drums have always retained full ceremonial band dress, consisting of green doublets for pipers and scarlet doublets with crown lace for drummers. Pipers wear a black cock feather in their glengarries in full dress, with drummers wearing the feather bonnet.

;Highland dress
The Government tartan kilt is worn, with pleats arranged in box style according to the pattern worn by the Argylls. Several types of sporran are worn. All ranks wear a brown leather purse when in walking-out dress (i.e. with green Lovat hose); NCMs wear a simpler version with brass stud closure, officers wear a separate pattern with hidden snap fastener. For dress parades (commanding officer&#x27;s parade dress), corporals and master corporals wear the six-point horsehair sporran while senior NCMs and officers wear a badger head sporran. Pipers wear three-point horsehair sporrans while the pipe major and drum major wear a separate pattern of three-point sporran. Hose tops and diced hose are in red/white dice, with pipers wearing Rob Roy tartan (red/black dice).

Honorary Colonel R.B. Bennett originally outfitted the Pipes and Drums with Royal Stewart tartan kilts and plaids in the 1920s; when the band of the 1st Battalion arrived in England in 1940 they were very quickly informed that Royal Stewart was the prerogative of royal regiments only, and they were to cease wear of that tartan at once. Pipers in the 2nd Battalion (Calgary) continued to wear Royal Stewart tartan until 1947.
;Mess dress
Mess dress for officers and senior NCMs is based closely on that worn by the Argylls; Honorary Colonel Mannix approved a new distinctive pattern officers&#x27; mess jacket in the 1980s, which featured buttons on a turn-back cuff, which differed from the Argylls pattern.

;Combat dress
Other than regimental headdress (when not wearing the CADPAT field cap or helmet), the only distinction a Calgary Highlander has in combat dress are the CALG HIGHRS titles on his slip-ons.

;Regimental order
The regiment created its own order, the Clan of the Gallant Canadians, in 1992.

==Traditions==
The Regimental Birthday is April 1. It was on 1 April 1910 that the 103rd Regiment (Calgary Rifles) was officially founded. The regiment toasts the occasion with Black Velvet and raw oysters, homage to the original toasts offered by the founder, Lieutenant-Colonel W.C.G. Armstrong and his officers in 1910. The weekend closest to April 22 is when St. Julien&#x27;s Day is formally recognized, commemorating the role of the 10th Battalion in the Battle of St. Julien in 1915. The parade day closest to October 31 commemorates the role of The Calgary Highlanders in the Battle of Walcheren Causeway.

==Regimental association==
The 10th Battalion Association was merged with The Calgary Highlanders Association in 1956 to become the 10th Battalion Calgary Highlanders Association.

During the Second World War, &quot;The Glen&quot; was the regimental newspaper of the overseas battalion beginning in September 1939, and &quot;The Glen&quot; continues to be the regimental journal of the 10th Battalion Calgary Highlanders Association. &quot;The Glen&quot; is published semi-regularly.

==Notable members==
*General John de Chastelain, who served two terms as Chief of the Defence Staff, began his military career as a private in the Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders. On 30 June 1990, while serving as CDS, he paraded as a piper with the band during the Presentation of Queen&#x27;s Colour at McMahon Stadium.
*Brigadier-General G.J.P. O&#x27;Brien, OMM, MSC, CD, served in the ranks of the Calgary Highlanders from 1976 to 1979, including a tour of duty with UNDOF. He later transferred to 4th Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment, where he was commissioned, went on to command the regiment as a lieutenant-colonel, then commanded 31 Canadian Brigade Group, and was appointed Director General Land Reserve in 2006. 
*Lieutenant-Colonel J.G. McQueen was the first commander of the Canadian contingent of the First Special Service Force (The Devil&#x27;s Brigade).
*Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Tennant rose from the rank of private in 1939 to the rank of major in 1944, and commanded the peacetime regiment after the Second World War. He was also appointed honorary lieutenant-colonel. In civilian life he served for many years as an alderman of the City of Calgary. He was admitted to the Order of Canada following his political service.
*Lieutenant Carl Nickle, later Member of Parliament and member of the Order of Canada.
*Four Calgary Highlanders officers served in the CANLOAN project during the Second World War, two were captured at Arnhem, one was killed in Normandy with the Royal Scots, and one became the last CANLOAN to die in action when he was killed with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in April 1945.
*Sergeants Lyster and Pittaway were mentioned in despatches for their part in shooting down two German aircraft during the Dieppe Raid.
*Scruffy Wallace was a piper in The Calgary Highlanders before leaving the CF and becoming a member of Dropkick Murphys.
==Regimental monuments==
As part of the celebrations of the 50th anniversary of VE Day, a special celebrations committee in Doetinchem, Netherlands, recommended that the city park be renamed in honour of Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Tennant and that a monument for the Calgary Highlanders who were killed in the fighting there be established. Tennant distinguished himself during the battle for Doetinchem where the Highlanders fought to clear the city between 1 and 3 April 1945.

As a measure of thanks on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the Netherlands, the City of Doetinchem named the park &quot;Mark Tennantplantsoen – Een Canadese bevrijder&quot; – &quot;Mark Tennant Park, A Canadian Liberator.&quot; Trees in the park still contained shrapnel; mute evidence of the fighting that raged there in April 1945.

The Calgary Soldiers&#x27; Memorial bears the names of all Calgary area soldiers who died in war from 1914, with separate sections for both the 10th Battalion, CEF and The Calgary Highlanders.

Regimental plaques can be found at various sites, including Mewata Armouries, Hill 67, Clair Tizon and Loon Plage in Normandy. A plaque to the predecessor unit, the 10th Battalion, can be found at Villers-lès-Cagnicourt, commemorating the Victoria Cross action of Sergeant Arthur Knight, VC.

==Film portrayals==
*&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; (1968). Two main characters can be seen wearing the insignia of the Calgary Highlanders, Corporal Peacock and Private MacDonald (Richard Dawson).
*&quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994). The character of Samuel Ludlow (Henry Thomas) very clearly wears the insignia of the 10th Battalion, CEF. It is presumed that Tristan Ludlow (Brad Pitt) and Alfred Ludlow (Aidan Quinn) also belong to the same battalion, but neither costume nor dialogue confirm this though a voiceover indicates that all three enlisted together in Calgary.
*&quot;Passchendaele&quot; (2008). This film project, announced by Paul Gross, filmed in Alberta in the autumn of 2007; Gross depicts a character inspired by his grandfather, Sergeant Michael Dunne, who he claimed served in the 10th Battalion, CEF. The film opened at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 4, 2008, and was released in Canada on October 17, 2008. Historical figures are referenced in the film, for example characters named Colonel Ormond and RSM Watchman are named after living historical counterparts that served with the 10th Battalion.
*&quot;The Forgotten Battle&quot; (2020). The crossing of the Walcheren Causeway is depicted in this film.

<text>Michel Jean-Pierre Barda (; born 7 March 1965) is a Swedish and Israeli singer, actor, make up artist and hair dresser of French/Algerian Jewish descent. He is one of the founding members of the pop group Army of Lovers. 

== Biography ==

Jean-Pierre Barda was born in Paris, France. His father was of Algerian Jewish origin. When he was seven, he moved to Sweden with his family, settling in Stockholm. Barda immigrated to Israel in 2015. He currently lives in Tel Aviv. He has been openly gay since he came out at age 16. His parents kicked him out for his sexuality, and he did not have contact with them for 15 years after.

== Music and acting career ==
Barda started out working with Alexander Bard as a part of the music group Barbie. He initially called himself Farouk, but reverted to his real name when Barbie later evolved into the group Army of Lovers. Barda has been with the group throughout all of its incarnations.

In 2004, Barda considered joining a new band called Bodies Without Organs. This did not come to fruition, and Barda&#x27;s explicit involvement extended only as far as co-writing BWO&#x27;s first single &quot;Living in a Fantasy&quot;.

Barda is also known as a hair-dresser and make-up artist. He has starred in movies, television and photo shoots.

<text>The Sack of Rome, then part of the Papal States, followed the capture of Rome on 6 May 1527 by the mutinous troops of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, during the War of the League of Cognac. Charles V only intended to threaten military action to make Pope Clement VII come to his terms. However, most of the Imperial army (14,000 Germans, including Lutherans, 6,000 Spaniards and some Italians) were largely unpaid. Despite being ordered not to storm the city, they broke into the scarcely defended city and began looting, killing, and holding citizens for ransom without any restraint. Clement VII took refuge in Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo after the Swiss Guard were annihilated in a delaying rear guard action; he remained there until a ransom was paid to the pillagers.

Benvenuto Cellini, eyewitness to the events, described the sack in his works. It was not until February 1528 that the spread of a plague and the approach of the League forces under Odet de Foix forced the army to withdraw towards Naples from the city. Rome&#x27;s population had dropped from 55,000 to 10,000 due to the atrocities, famine, an outbreak of plague, and flight from the city. The subsequent loss of the League army during the Siege of Naples secured a victory in the War of the League of Cognac for Charles V. The Emperor denied responsibility for the sack and came to terms again with Clement VII. On the other hand, the Sack of Rome further exacerbated religious hatred and antagonism between Catholics and Lutherans.

==Preceding events==
The growing power of the King of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor Charles V alarmed Pope Clement VII, who perceived Charles as a threat to the papal power. Clement VII formed an alliance with Charles V&#x27;s arch-enemy, King Francis I of France, which came to be known as the League of Cognac.

Apart from the Pope and the King of France, the League also included the Duchy of Milan, the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, and the Florence of the Medici. The League began hostilities in 1526 by attacking the Republic of Siena, but the undertaking proved to be a failure and revealed the weakness of the troops at the Pope&#x27;s disposal.

The Imperial Army defeated the French army, but funds were not available to pay the soldiers. The 34,000 Imperial troops mutinied and forced their commander, Duke Charles III of Bourbon, to lead them towards Rome, which was an easy target for pillaging due to the unstable political landscape at the time.

Aside from some 6,000 Spaniards under the Duke of Bourbon, the army included some 14,000 Landsknechte under Georg von Frundsberg; some Italian infantry led by Fabrizio Maramaldo, the powerful Italian cardinal Pompeo Colonna, and Luigi Gonzaga; and some cavalry under the command of Ferdinando Gonzaga and Philibert, Prince of Orange. Though Martin Luther himself was against attacking Rome and Pope Clement VII, some who considered themselves followers of Luther&#x27;s Protestant movement viewed the papal capital as a target for religious reasons. Numerous outlaws, along with the League&#x27;s deserters, joined the army during its march.

The Duke of Bourbon left Arezzo on 20 April 1527, taking advantage of chaos among the Venetians and their allies after a revolt broke out in Florence against Pope Clement VII&#x27;s family, the Medici. His largely undisciplined troops sacked Acquapendente and San Lorenzo alle Grotte, and then occupied Viterbo and Ronciglione, reaching the walls of Rome on 5 May.

==Sack==
The imperial troops were 14,000 Germans, 6,000 Spanish, and an uncertain number of Italian infantry.
The troops defending Rome were not very numerous: only 5,000 militiamen led by Renzo da Ceri and 189 Papal Swiss Guards. The city&#x27;s defenses included the massive Aurelian Walls, and substantial artillery, which the Imperial army lacked. Charles of Bourbon needed to conquer the city swiftly to avoid the risk of being trapped between the besieged city and the League&#x27;s army.

On 6 May, the Imperial army attacked the walls at the Gianicolo and Vatican hills. The Duke was fatally wounded in the assault, allegedly shot by Benvenuto Cellini. He was wearing his famous white cloak to mark him out to his troops, which also had the unintended consequence of pointing him out as the leader to his enemies. With the death of their last respected leader, the common soldiery in the Imperial army lost any restraint when they easily succeeded in storming the walls of Rome the same day. Philibert of Châlon took command of the troops, but he was not as popular or feared, leaving him with little authority.

In the event known as the Stand of the Swiss Guard, the Swiss, alongside the garrison&#x27;s remaining soldiers, made their last stand in the Teutonic Cemetery within the Vatican. Their captain, Kaspar Röist, was wounded and later sought refuge in his house, where Spanish soldiers killed him in front of his wife. The Swiss fought bitterly, but were hopelessly outnumbered and almost annihilated. Some survivors, accompanied by a band of refugees, fell back to the steps of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Those who went toward the Basilica were massacred, and only 42 survived. This group of 42, under the command of Hercules Goldli, managed to stave off the Habsburg troops pursuing the Pope&#x27;s entourage as it made its way across the Passetto di Borgo, a secure elevated passage that connects the Vatican City to Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo.
After the execution of some 1,000 defenders of the Papal capital and shrines, the pillage began. Churches and monasteries, as well as the palaces of prelates and cardinals, were looted and destroyed. Even pro-Imperial cardinals had to pay to save their properties from the rampaging soldiers. On 8 May, Cardinal Pompeo Colonna, a personal enemy of Clement VII, entered the city. He was followed by peasants from his fiefs, who had come to avenge the sacks they had suffered at the hands of the Papal armies. Colonna was touched by the pitiful conditions in the city and gave refuge to some Roman citizens in his palace.

The Vatican Library was saved because Philibert had set up his headquarters there. After three days of ravages, Philibert ordered the soldiers to stop pillaging, but few heeded his words. In the meantime, Clement remained a prisoner in Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo. Francesco Maria I della Rovere and Michele Antonio of Saluzzo arrived with troops on 1 June in Monterosi, north of the city. Their cautious behaviour prevented them from obtaining an easy victory against the now totally undisciplined imperial troops. On 6 June, Clement VII surrendered, and agreed to pay a ransom of 400,000 ducati in exchange for his life; conditions included the cession of Parma, Piacenza, Civitavecchia, and Modena to the Holy Roman Empire (however, only the last would actually change hands). At the same time Venice took advantage of this situation to conquer Cervia and Ravenna, while Sigismondo Malatesta returned to Rimini.

==Aftermath and effects==

Often cited as the end of the Italian High Renaissance, the Sack of Rome impacted the histories of Europe, Italy, and Christianity, creating lasting ripple effects throughout European culture and politics.

Before the sack, Pope Clement VII opposed the ambitions of Emperor Charles V. Afterward, he no longer had the military or financial resources to do so. To avert more warfare, Clement adopted a conciliatory policy toward Charles.

The sack had major repercussions for Italian society and culture, and in particular, for Rome. Clement&#x27;s War of the League of Cognac would be the last fight of some of the Italian city-states for independence until the nineteenth century. Before the sack, Rome had been a center of Italian High Renaissance culture and patronage, and the main destination for any European artist eager for fame and wealth, thanks to the prestigious commissions of the papal court. In the sack, Rome suffered depopulation and economic collapse, sending artists and writers elsewhere. The city&#x27;s population dropped from over 55,000 before the attack to 10,000 afterward. An estimated 6,000 to 12,000 people were murdered. Among those who died in the sack were papal secretary Paolo Valdabarini and professor of natural history Augusto Valdo.

Many Imperial soldiers also died in the aftermath, largely from diseases caused by masses of unburied corpses in the streets. Pillaging finally ended in February 1528, eight months after the initial attack, when the city&#x27;s food supply ran out, there was no one left to ransom, and plague appeared. Clement would continue artistic patronage and building projects in Rome, but a perceived Medicean golden age had passed. The city did not recover its population losses until approximately 1560.

A power shift – away from the Pope, toward the Emperor – also produced lasting consequences for Catholicism. After learning of the sack, Emperor Charles professed great embarrassment that his troops had imprisoned Pope Clement. However, though he had wanted to avoid destruction within the city of Rome, which would damage his reputation, he had ordered troops to Italy to bring Clement under his control. Charles eventually came to terms with the Pope with the Treaty of Barcelona (1529) and the coronation of Bologna. This done, Charles molded the Church in his own image. Clement, never again to directly oppose the Emperor, rubber-stamped Charles&#x27; demands – among them naming cardinals nominated by the latter; crowning Charles Holy Roman Emperor and King of Italy at Bologna in 1530; and refusing to annul the marriage of Charles&#x27; beloved aunt, Catherine of Aragon, to King Henry VIII of England, prompting the English Reformation. Cumulatively, these actions changed the complexion of the Catholic Church, steering it away from Renaissance freethought personified by the Medici Popes, toward the religious orthodoxy exemplified by the Counter-Reformation. After Clement&#x27;s death in 1534, under the influence of Charles and later his son King Philip II of Spain (1556–1598), the Inquisition became pervasive, and the humanism encouraged by Renaissance culture came to be viewed as contrary to the teachings of the Church.

The sack also contributed to making permanent the split between Catholics and Protestants. Previously, Charles and Clement had disagreed over how to address Martin Luther and the Protestant Reformation, which was spreading throughout Germany. Charles advocated for calling a Church Council to settle the matter. Clement opposed this, believing that monarchs shouldn&#x27;t dictate Church policy; and also fearing a revival of conciliarism, which had exacerbated the Western Schism during the 14th–15th centuries, and deposed numerous Popes. Clement advocated fighting a Holy War to unite Christendom. Charles opposed this because his armies and treasury were occupied in fighting other wars. After the sack, Clement acceded to Charles&#x27; wishes, agreeing to call a Church Council and naming the city of Trent, Italy as its site. He did not convene the Council of Trent during his lifetime, fearing that the event would be a dangerous power play. In 1545, eleven years after Clement&#x27;s death, his successor Pope Paul III convened the Council of Trent. As Charles predicted, it reformed the corruption present in certain orders of the Catholic Church. However, by 1545, the moment for reconciliation between Catholics and Protestants – arguably a possibility during the 1520s, given cooperation between the Pope and Emperor – had passed. In assessing the effects of the Sack of Rome, Martin Luther commented: &quot;Christ reigns in such a way that the Emperor who persecutes Luther for the Pope is forced to destroy the Pope for Luther&quot; (LW 49:169).

In commemoration of the Swiss Guard&#x27;s bravery in defending Pope Clement VII during the Sack of Rome, recruits to the Swiss Guard are sworn in on 6 May every year.

<text>Brendan Kibble aka &quot;Wig&quot; (born 16 October 1963) is an Australian singer, songwriter, and guitarist. He is best known for his work with Australian bands The Bam Balams and Navahodads and the American bands The Texreys and The Go Wows.

==Musical history==

Kibble&#x27;s first bands were the Brisbane punk rock outfits Alphabet Children (1979–80) (vocals), Flying Squad (1980–81) (vocals, guitar), Vampire Lovers (1981) (guitar) and The Horde (1982) (vocals, guitar).

After playing in The Horde, in 1983 he briefly played guitar in a line up of the Brisbane band The Headstones.

In 1984 Kibble left Brisbane for Sydney, where he formed the Bam Balams
, who released an album, an EP, and six singles. The Bam Balams split in 1992.

Over the next few years, he acted as producer for several Pyramidiacs records: the &quot;Krunch!&quot; EP (1993), the &quot;Solo Una Vez&quot; EP (1993) and the &quot;All You Want&quot; LP (1994) (which he also played guitar on).

In 1994 he started playing live again, in the band Surry Hills 2010, who took rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll songs and played them in full country/honky tonk style. Later in 1994, Kibble teamed up with Chris Flynn (ex The Headstones, The Dubrovniks) and they formed Motorhank. This band took country songs (mainly Hank Williams tunes) and played them in a hard rock style.

In 1995 Kibble and Motorhank&#x27;s bass player Karl Dogbox formed the Navahodads. The band released two albums, a single, and had tracks on compilation albums.

In 2002–03, Kibble played guitar in a band fronted by Rob Younger, the Nanker Phelge, playing 1960s British Invasion, beat, and r&amp;b covers.

The Navahodads split up in 2003, and Kibble moved to Austin, Texas, from 2007 to 2011 he fronted The Texreys a Garage rock band. The Texreys released one album. From 2012 to 2015 he fronted Power Pop/Rock band The Go Wows, who released two albums.

<text>Gurguit Barbtruc (&quot;Welsh:&quot; Gwrgant Farfdrwch) was a legendary king of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He was the son of Belinus and was said to have found a home for the Irish people.

Gurguit was a peaceful king who followed in the manner of his father and grandfather. Yet, when the king of the Danes refused to pay tribute to Belinus&#x27;s son, Gurguit took a fleet and invaded Denmark, killing the king and reducing the country to subservience.

On the return voyage, Gurguit came across a fleet of thirty ships of men and women, called Basclenses, under the leadership of Partholoim. They had been exiled from Spain and sought a new land to live in. Gurguit did not allow them to settle in Britain but he gave them the isle of Ireland to settle, which was (according to this fanciful legend) uninhabited until then, and thus the Basclenses became the Irish.

Gurguit died peacefully and was buried in the Caerleon, a city he built up from the time his father founded it. Guithelin succeeded him to the kingship.

<doc id="676392" wikidata="Q172857" url="?curid=676392" title="Lola Cars">
<text>Lola Cars Limited is a British automobile manufacturer founded in 1958 by Eric Broadley in Bromley, England. The company is now owned by Till Bechtolsheimer, who purchased it in 2022. Lola Cars endured for more than fifty years to become one of the oldest and largest manufacturers of racing cars in the world. Lola started by building small front-engine sports cars, and branched out into Formula Junior cars before diversifying into a wider range of sporting vehicles. In 2012, Lola Cars stopped operations. Lola returned to motorsport in 2024 by joining the Formula E World Championship as an entrant and a powertrain supplier in a technical partnership with Yamaha.

==History==
Lola Cars was a brand of the Lola Group, which combined former rowing boat manufacturer Lola Aylings and Lola Composites, that specialized in carbon fibre production.

Lola was acquired by Martin Birrane in 1997 after the unsuccessful MasterCard Lola attempt at Formula One. After a period in bankruptcy administration, Lola Cars International ceased trading on 5 October 2012. The administrator, CCW Recovery Solutions, was unable to find a suitable buyer and the firm ceased trading on 5 October 2012, laying off the last employees.

On 16 October 2012, it was announced in the competition press that some assets of Lola Cars were acquired by Multimatic Inc. and The Carl A. Haas Automotive company. In addition to the asset purchase, Multimatic and Haas obtained a licence agreement to use the Lola Cars name and intellectual property.

In late 2021, Till Bechtolsheimer bid and subsequently bought Lola in June 2022. The assets bought include the brand and trademarks, intellectual property, and the Lola Technical Centre (with wind tunnel). Bechtolsheimer subsequently made it clear he has the intention of reviving the company within two years. He expressed an ambition to have a car on the track in the 2024–25 time frame. Bechtolsheimer drove a Lola for the first time in November 2022—a 1958 Mk1 at Harris Hill Raceway. In October 2024, Lola acquired Paceteq, an automotive industry data technology and software company in its bid to accelerate its development after entering Formula E.

== Sports cars ==



=== Early days – the 1960s ===
Lola was one of the top chassis suppliers in the 1960s. After its small front-engined sports cars came various single-seaters including Formula Junior, Formula 3, Formula 2 and Formula 1 cars.

Broadley designed the Ford V8 powered Lola Mk.6 coupe. Ford took a keen interest in this and paid Broadley to put the company on hold for two years and merge his ideas with Roy Lunn&#x27;s work, giving rise to the Ford GT40. Initial work was done at the Lola works at Bromley before moving to a factory on the Slough Trading Estate. Broadley managed to release himself from this contract after a year and started developing his own cars again, retaining the Slough factory, which was in Lola&#x27;s name (leaving John Wyer to find new premises for Ford Advanced Vehicles, which were also on the Slough Estate). Broadley started off in sports cars with the Lola T70 and its successors (T16x, T22x) which were used successfully all over the world from the World Championship for Makes to the CanAm series, until 1973. In 2005, Lola announced that a new batch of T70 coupés, to the original specifications, would be released. These were to be homologated for historic racing and there was talk of a one-make series for the cars. The Slough built cars incorporated the letters &#x27;SL&#x27; in their chassis numbers, just as the cars built at Bromley had incorporated &#x27;BR&#x27;.

=== 1970s ===
Various Group 5 and Group 6 sports cars including the T210 and T212, and T28x/29x/38x/39x series were also built, competing with Chevron, March and others. Alain de Cadenet&#x27;s Le Mans &#x27;specials&#x27; tended to be based on Lola technology.

Lola (with rebodied Formula 5000 cars) dominated the CanAm sports car series when it was revived in the late 1970s, but many motorsport fans do not consider the single-seater Formula 5000-based cars from this era to be true sports cars, despite their full bodywork and enclosed wheel-wells.

=== 1980s and early 1990s ===
Lola introduced the T600/T610 range for IMSA GTP racing in the early 1980s – these were fitted with a range of engines including Cosworth, Mazda and Chevrolet, as well as the novel Polimotor engine built using composite materials. Derivatives of this car were successful for some time in IMSA and Group C racing. Later Lola Group C and GTP cars tended to be built specifically for manufacturer programmes, specifically the later Nissan Group C entries and the Chevrolet Corvette GTP program. Lola also built a car for the 3.5 L Group C formula, the T92/10, but the championship collapsed before this could be fully developed.

=== Late 1990s and 2000s ===
More recently, Lola produced a range of sports cars for Le Mans-style racing starting with the B98/10, which was successful in the European market but less so in the USA. The B2K/10, with its additional central headlight reminiscent of a cyclops or a locomotive was more notable for its looks than its performance. While Lola has had limited success in the top class of the sport versus factory cars like the BMW V12 LMR and Audi R8, Lola has enjoyed periods of dominance in the second class (formerly LMP675, now LMP2), including championship class victories in the American Le Mans Series, although this has been threatened in the ALMS LMP2 by works-supported entries from Acura and Porsche.

A dedicated LMP675 car was built for MG in 2001, powered by a two-litre four-cylinder AER turbocharged engine. This was entered at Le Mans by the works team as the MG-Lola EX257, and was also run as the Lola B01/60 by private entrants. Later developments of this car have been fitted with assorted small V8s and the chassis was developed into recent customer LMP1 and LMP2 chassis.

An updated version of the Lola LMP2 came in 2005 with the introduction of the Lola B05/40 (also known as the MG-Lola EX264/265). It quickly became a contender in LMP2 by taking class honours in 2005 and 2006 at Le Mans with Ray Mallock Limited. It also earned several class wins in the American Le Mans Series in 2005 and 2006 with Intersport Racing, including a second-place overall finish in the 2006 12 Hours of Sebring. In 2007, extensive updates were made to the chassis, to accommodate the all-new Acura powerplant run by Fernandez Racing. In addition, an essentially brand new LMP2 prototype, the B07/40, was built to house the new AER-based Mazda engine. This new version is being run exclusively in the U.S. by B-K Motorsports.

Lola also updated its LMP1 challenger in 2006 with the introduction of the B06/10. The car was run in the American Le Mans Series by Dyson Racing and in the Le Mans Series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans by UK-based Chamberlain-Synergy Racing. Chamberlain continued to run the machine in 2007 and 2008, while the former Dyson cars have been run off and on in the ALMS by Cytosport Racing and Intersport Racing. As with its LMP2 program, the 2007 calendar year saw Lola introduce further upgrades with the debut of the B07/10, which saw action in the Le Mans Series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans with Charouz Racing and the Swiss Spirit team (using the same engine as the Audi R8).

Lola (in association with Tracy Krohn) took over the Multimatic franchise in Grand-Am&#x27;s Daytona Prototype category in 2007. Krohn used his Riley cars at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2008 but switched to the new cars later in the season.

Lola also introduced a pair of closed-cockpit Le Mans prototypes in 2008, the first of which is the B08/60 running in the P1 category. The first B08/60 was raced by the Charouz team (with assistance from Prodrive) and featured an Aston Martin V12 engine to GT1 specification.

The B08/80 built to P2 regulations was first raced by Sebah Racing (and Speedy Racing in the 2008 Le Mans 24 Hours) and continued racing in the 2009 and 2010 seasons.

=== 2010s===
It was announced on 21 July 2010, that Lola would be building the B11/40 to comply with the new 2011 LMP2 regulations. The car was to be a carbon fibre open-top monocoque race car featuring an all-carbon bodykit, quick-release removable rear bodywork including a stabilization fin on the engine cover which is a safety requirement of the new regulations. However, on 16 May 2012, it was reported that Lola Cars was entering financial administration.

Multimatic, a subsequent owner of Lola assets, supplied two Lola B12/80 LMP2 chassis&#x27; to Mazda for IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship competition. The cars were powered by turbocharged inline-four Mazda diesel powerplants in 2014 and 2015, and a gasoline-powered turbo inline-four in 2016. All of the WeatherTech Sports Car Championship&#x27;s Prototype-class chassis were retired at the end of the 2016 season in favour of a new specification, marking the end of Mazda&#x27;s use of the Lola chassis.

== Formula One ==


Lola resisted making a &#x27;works&#x27; (i.e. a factory) Formula One entry for many years, being content to construct cars on behalf of other entrants. Lola&#x27;s first works entry in 1997 led directly to the financial ruin of the company.

===Bowmaker and Parnell===
Lola made its first foray into Formula One in 1962, supplying Lola Mk4 cars to Reg Parnell&#x27;s &quot;Bowmaker-Yeoman Racing Team&quot;, with John Surtees and Roy Salvadori as drivers. A measure of success was immediate, with Surtees&#x27;s car claiming pole position in its first World Championship race, but although points were often scored, wins in Championship Grands Prix eluded the team. After Bowmaker&#x27;s withdrawal, Parnell continued to run the cars privately. Privateer Bob Anderson gave the Mk4 its last victory, in the non-Championship 1963 Rome Grand Prix. Consistency, however, was not to be found, and after only two seasons, Lola abandoned Formula One cars for the time being.

===&quot;Hondola&quot; Honda RA300 and RA301===
In 1967, Lola assisted Honda Racing and John Surtees with the design of their F1 car. The overweight chassis design by the engine-specialists from Honda was abandoned, and a 1966 Lola Indianapolis monocoque (Lola T90) used as the basis for a Honda-engined car. The resultant Honda RA300 was called the &quot;Lola T130&quot; by Lola Cars, unofficially called the &quot;Hondola&quot; by the press, and was sufficiently light and powerful to win the 1967 Italian Grand Prix.

===BMW Formula Two cars===
A number of Lola-built BMW F2 cars were subsequently entered in the F2 class of the German Grand Prix at about this time.

===Embassy Hill===

Towards the end of his long career, Graham Hill found it difficult to attract works drives; with a view to both finding a drive and a future as a team owner he established his own team backed by the Embassy cigarette brand. After an unsuccessful 1973 with a customer Shadow, the team commissioned its own cars from Lola. The T370 was largely based on the Formula 5000 cars of the time, and looked similar to Lola&#x27;s F5000 cars, although it sported a larger airbox. The car was developed by Andy Smallman into the Hill GH1 in 1975, but the team&#x27;s first in-house design, the Hill GH2, remained unraced when Hill, Tony Brise, Smallman and several other team personnel were killed in an air crash in November 1975.

===Haas Lola===

The Haas Lola F1 programme was extremely promising, funded by a large American industrial conglomerate Beatrice Foods and run by the highly experienced Teddy Mayer, with the promise of works Ford power, but it flattered to deceive. The handsome car, designed mostly by Neil Oatley, was barely a Lola; the name was used largely because Haas was Lola&#x27;s US concessionaire although Broadley had some involvement with the car. Alan Jones was tempted out of retirement to drive it in F1 races towards the end of the 1985 season, with Patrick Tambay joining in a second car for 1986. A works Ford-Cosworth turbocharged engine was promised, but this did not materialise until 1986 and old Hart four-cylinder units were used. Car, engine, drivers and sponsors were all troublesome and the team folded after the 1986 season with most of its assets (including the factory) being sold to Bernie Ecclestone. At one point during the season, Ecclestone informed the Haas Lola team that &quot;his driver&quot; (Patrese) would be in the car at the next meeting; Ecclestone was primarily interested in acquiring the Ford engines as a replacement for the BMW units in his Brabhams but the manufacturer vetoed this, offering the engines to Benetton instead. He used the team&#x27;s factory to build the ill-fated Alfa Romeo &quot;ProCar&quot; (a series for &quot;silhouette&quot; touring cars with F1-style mechanicals and engines).

===Larrousse &amp; Calmels===
The Larrousse &amp; Calmels programme was initially much lower-key than the previous effort. Starting from a simple Cosworth-powered car based on Lola&#x27;s F3000 technologies, the French team built up a steady reputation in normally aspirated F1 from 1987 on. They attracted Lamborghini V12 power for 1989 and once the Chris Murphy-designed car was on stream, scored some good results with Éric Bernard and Aguri Suzuki. The team experienced some problems after Didier Calmels&#x27;s arrest for the murder of his wife, but continued at a slightly lower key with Cosworth power again. Unfortunately, due to irregularities with the team&#x27;s F1 entry in 1990, (the cars were entered as Larrousses but were really Lolas) they lost all their Constructors&#x27; Championship points – which promoted the politically well-connected Ligier outfit into a position in the Constructors&#x27; Championship that gave them significant FIA benefits.

===Scuderia Italia===

The Scuderia Italia programme was something of a disaster from the start. The team had done reasonably well with Dallara chassis before, but turned to Lola for 1993. Powered by customer Ferrari engines, both engine and car seemed to be well off the pace, Michele Alboreto and Luca Badoer struggled to even qualify for races. Badoer finished 7th in the 1993 San Marino Grand Prix, a race of high attrition, to score the best Lola result of the season. The team withdrew from F1 before the final two races of the season. It partly merged with Minardi for 1994.

===Unraced test cars===
Lola built a number of Cosworth V8 powered test cars in 1994–95, with rumours of a Havoline-funded quasi-works Ford team. The rumour was that Cosworth V12s badged Jaguar would go to Benetton, in fact no Ford/Jaguar V12 ran in F1 or elsewhere, and Lola would inherit the Zetec V8.
Allan McNish did much of the test driving, but as this was a period of instability in the F1 rules little was achieved.

===MasterCard-sponsored works programme===

Lola had originally intended to enter Formula One in their own right in 1998, but pressure from main sponsor MasterCard caused Lola to debut its new car one year early, in 1997. The sponsorship model was curious, linked both to MasterCard membership of a &#x27;club&#x27;, and to results – something a first-year F1 team often finds hard to achieve. A custom-built V10 engine from Al Melling was going to be fitted to the cars, which initially started racing fitted with underpowered Ford Cosworth ED V8s.

The cars had a lot of problems, the worst being aerodynamics – they had never even been tested in a wind-tunnel when they arrived in Australia, which by that point in time was unthinkable. The car was fundamentally flawed, and the lack of wind-tunnel time had made it even less competitive. Despite the car&#x27;s problems, the team was confident that it could finish ahead of some of the other teams. The results were disastrous, the cars were well off the pace and were no faster than Lola&#x27;s Formula 3000 cars. After only one race, the sponsors pulled out; the team turned up for the second race in Brazil but the cars did not turn a wheel and that was the end of the MasterCard Lola story. Shortly afterwards, the entire Lola Car Company went into receivership. The company was saved through the purchase and cash rescue package from Martin Birrane.

===Planned 2010 project and 2019 comeback attempt===
On 22 April 2009, Lola announced on its website that &quot;Lola Group has commenced a major project comprising a full technical, operational and financial evaluation aimed at developing a car to compete in the FIA Formula One World Championship&quot;. Lola was one of several teams to lodge an entry with the FIA for the 2010 Formula One World Championship.
On 17 June, however, the company abandoned its plans to return to F1 after failing to secure a place on the initial 2010 entry list.

The owner of the Force India team, Vijay Mallya, had intended to rename his team since mid-2017, however, this plan did not go ahead until the arrival of Lawrence Stroll, a Canadian billionaire, who bought Force India in 2018 and renamed as Racing Point. However, Stroll&#x27;s intention was to get the rights to the name Lola (among others) to compete in the 2019 season. Stroll failed in this attempt, and Racing Point remained with that name, until rebranding to Aston Martin in 2021.

== Formula Two / Formula 3000 / A1GP ==
After its limited success in the 1960s with Formula One, Lola turned its attention primarily to sports cars but also to Formula Two, where Lola became the works team for BMW. As the years went on, Lola had somewhat more success in Formula Two than it ever had in Formula One, although as March and later Ralt established themselves, Lola&#x27;s involvement in the category became intermittent and less successful. The final Lola F2 was derived from a Ralt design – the Ralt RT2 became the Toleman TG280, which Toleman licensed to Lola who productionised it as the T850. When Formula Two was replaced by Formula 3000 in 1985, Lola made a &quot;false start&quot; with a car based on their significantly larger Indycar chassis; from 1986 they returned with a bespoke F3000 design. Lola enjoyed significant success for the next few years, competing with Ralt and Reynard, although Reynard effectively wiped the others out of the market. In 1996 the International Formula 3000 Championship became a one-make series, and Lola was awarded the contract by the FIA to build the Lola T96/50 chassis for all teams competing in the championship. The contract which was renewed in 1999 (Lola B99/50) and 2002 (Lola B02/50) before International F3000 was replaced by GP2 and Lola lost the bid to build the new chassis.

Formula Nippon ran mixed grids of cars (with Reynard dominating) until 2003, when Lola was awarded that contract as well. The Euroseries 3000 used the B02/50 from 2007 to 2009, while the ex-A1GP B05/52 chassis was introduced in 2009.

Lola succeeded in winning the largest-ever contract for single-seater racing cars in 2005, the contract for the A1 Grand Prix series. Lola built 50 identical Zytek V8-powered A1 Grand Prix cars which were leased to the national franchisees (although the teams&#x27; spare cars were recalled part-way through the 2005 season to be used for spare parts); development work on these was strictly prohibited. The cars were approximately at the F3000 level of technology.

===List of F3000 chassis===
====T950====
Lola has been supplying the car body since 1985, the first year of F3000. The body, named T950, was developed based on the IndyCar T800.

====T86/50====
The T86/50, designed by Ralph Bellamy, who had transferred from March, was supplied to International F3000. Some of the vehicles used in the International F3000 were sold to Japanese teams and used in the All Japan F3000 Championship the following year.

====T87/50====
It is a model that improved the T86/50 and made the monocoque made of carbon. In the International Formula 3000, Stefano Modena, who rides the March, won the championship, but in the All Japan F3000, which was the first year of the F3000 in 1987, as the season progressed, more teams switched from March to Lola, and Kazuyoshi Hoshino switched to Lola. Hoshino became the champion.

====T88/50====
Developed for the 1988 season. In the All Japan F3000, Aguri Suzuki became the champion by making full use of both Reynard and March, and Kazuyoshi Hoshino was second in the series ranking in the Lola group.

====T89/50====
In the All Japan F3000, Hitoshi Ogawa became the series champion (the 1988 machine was used in the early stages and the 1989 machine was used after the middle stage), and Lola&#x27;s strength began to stand out. Reynard was the champion machine in International F3000.

====T90/50====
Until T89/50, the engine part was exposed, but for the first time in this model, a cowl covering the engine was installed behind the roll bar. The intake to the engine is not behind the roll bar until the previous year, but introduced a design that is guided from the air duct next to the cockpit, similar to the previous year&#x27;s Benetton F1.
Kazuyoshi Hoshino, who controlled this T90/50 in All Japan F3000, and Eric Comas, who entered from DAMS and drove the T90/50 in International F3000, became the champion, and Reynard users changed to Lola in the middle of the season.

====T91/50====
It looked a lot like the T90/50, but according to Lola, it was 80% new. This year, radial tires were introduced at International F3000 and the suspension geometry was reviewed.
Allan McNish, who had a hard time in International Formula 3000 and participated in the previous year&#x27;s champion team DAMS, suffered two qualifying losses in the three races since the opening. The All Japan F3000 also had a hard time, and at the beginning of the season, many teams used the old T90/50, but as the season progressed, more teams introduced the T91/50.

====T92/50====
A new underbody and front wing have been adopted to correct the aerodynamic shortcomings of the T91/50 and increase stability. The Benetton-type air intake has been abolished, and intake air to the engine has been taken in from the opening behind the roll bar.
The international F3000 continued to struggle, and the only victory was Jean-Marc Gounon &#x27;s victory in the final race. At the start of the season, there was no entry for the T92/50 in the All Japan F3000, but soon more than 10 cars entered the race. Mauro Martini on Lola won the title, and Toshio Suzuki of Lola also won second place in the series ranking.

====T93/50====
It was an evolution of the previous year&#x27;s model, but a new horizontal sequential gearbox made by Hewland was adopted. The T93/50 weighed between 20 kg and 25 kg, exceeding the specified weight. Journalist Manabu Kumano pointed out that the very heavy weight of the new gearbox may be the main cause of the overweight, comparing the weight balance with the previous year&#x27;s model T92/50. At the All-Japan F3000, some teams took measures such as introducing lightweight under panels and transmission cases to reduce the weight of the rear of the machine and installing a T92/50 gearbox.
There was no entry in International F3000 and it was used only in Japan. He won pole positions in Rounds 7 and 8 when the finals were canceled due to heavy fog, but he never recorded a victory. Kazuyoshi Hoshino, who drives Lola, became the third champion, but Hoshino used the previous year&#x27;s machine, which has abundant data and is highly reliable.
After the end of the International F3000 season, a T93/50 demonstration was held at a European circuit. The T93/50, driven by Vincenzo Sospiri, set a new time for Reynard, and Lola was confident in receiving orders from the international F3000 team for the coming season.

====T94/50====
The car body became thinner overall, and the side pods became smaller and shorter. It was thought that this change would make it aerodynamically stable and less susceptible to the pitching of the car body. Changes have also been made to the horizontal gearbox, which was pointed out to be overweight in the previous model. A new lightweight case with a total width of about 1 inch has been created, and the airflow behind the vehicle has also been improved. The weight of the car was 530 kg, and 20 kg of ballast was needed to meet the regulations.
Two teams, Nordic and Omegaland, used Lola in the International F3000, but the top of the season was Nordic Jordi Gené &#x27;s fourth place on the Catalan circuit.

====T95/50====
The body design has changed significantly from T94/50. The machine has won the international F3000 since 1992, with Mark Goosen taking third place in the series. In the All Japan F3000, it was used by the Nova The 1995 champion was won by Toshio Suzuki of Lola, but due to the older T94/50.

====T96/50====
In order to prevent the cost of entering the international F3000 from rising, the machine was Lola and the engine was Gibson Judd&#x27;s one-make series, eliminating competition in terms of hardware.
The International F3000 ended in 2004, but at the Euroseries 3000 Championship, which uses the old chassis, the Lola chassis was used consistently until the end of the 2009 series.

==Formula 5000==

In the late 1960s, the SCCA&#x27;s Formula A series evolved into Formula 5000 and attracted the attention of more professional drivers and teams. It was intended to be a cheap, high-powered open-wheeled racing series using relatively cheap tuned stock-block V8 engines. Lola entered this market as well, and after some interesting struggles with McLaren, Team Surtees and Chevron, came to dominate the later years of the series, producing the bulk of Formula 5000 cars throughout the 1970s – these competed in F5000 in Europe, the US and Australasia. The cars continued when the CanAm series was revived using Formula 5000 cars as the base. Lola made a seamless switch into this kind of &quot;sports car racing&quot;, and won five consecutive Can-Am championships.

==USAC / CART / Champ Car==
Lola had built chassis for the Indianapolis 500 as early as the 1960s – Graham Hill had won the 1966 Indianapolis 500 in a Lola, and Jackie Stewart raced a four-wheel drive Lola there. Al Unser won the 1978 Indianapolis 500 race in a modified Lola chassis. However, the marque did not make a fully fledged attack on the American open wheel market until the mid-1980s.

The revived CanAm was a fading series which collapsed in 1986, prompting Lola to move its focus to CART and the Indianapolis 500 beginning in 1983 with Mario Andretti driving a Lola for the new Newman/Haas Racing that year. Once again, Lola showed its ability to succeed in all motorsports outside of Formula One, pushing March down to one team for the 1990 CART season, and out of the series altogether by 1991. Six years after its full-time entrance into Indycar racing, Lola triumphed at Indy again, as the winning car for Arie Luyendyk in the 1990 Indianapolis 500.

The rivalry between Lola and Reynard continued in the United States as well as the European F3000 series. Reynard entered CART in 1994 and eventually almost completely displaced Lola from the market. By 1998 only the backmarker Davis Racing team was utilizing the Lola chassis, with Penske Racing using their own chassis, Newman/Haas Racing and Della Penna Motorsports using the new Swift Chassis, All American Racers running their own Eagle chassis, and all others running Reynards. However, when Penske Racing elected to abandon their proprietary chassis in 1999, they elected to run Lolas for the rest of that season, switching to Reynard for 2000 and 2001. Newman/Haas and Chip Ganassi Racing switched to Lolas in running the cars the following year. By 2001 the field was evenly split between the two cars.

Reynard&#x27;s financial trouble and the fact that many of the top teams running the Reynard switched to the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series in 2002 and 2003 meant that development on the Reynard largely ceased. By 2003 Lola was the only remaining manufacturer building new chassis for the Champ Car series. For the 2007 season, Champ Car switched to a spec Panoz chassis, the DP01, as its new chassis used by all competitors. The previous Lola, the B02/00, had been in the series since the 2002 season.

Lola also produced the spec chassis for the CART Indy Lights developmental series that was used from 1993 to 2001, replacing the previous car that was essentially a modified March 85B Formula 3000 car.

== Formula E ==
In March 2024, it was announced Lola would make its return to single-seater racing in the 2024–25 season of Formula E as a powertrain supplier in a technical partnership with Yamaha. A month later, Lola-Yamaha secured Abt as its first powertrain customer for the 2024–25 season onwards, with the team entering the season as Lola Yamaha Abt Formula E Team with Lucas di Grassi and Zane Maloney as the driver pairing. In November, it was announced that Lola has taken over Abt&#x27;s Formula E entrants&#x27; licence. Abt will continue to run the team operationally.

== Other motorsport activities ==


Lola built chassis for a wide range of minor categories over the years. Formula Atlantic cars tended to be derived from F2 and F3 designs, and other Lolas raced in Formula Ford, Sports 2000, Formula Super Vee and many other categories, often designed by people who went on to successful careers elsewhere in the sport. For example, Patrick Head of Williams fame designed his first cars for Broadley. There was not much profit margin in the minor-formulae cars, which tended to be built during the summer when the factory was otherwise quiet (most senior-formulae cars are built over the winter in the off-season) – but they kept staff occupied, gave designers somewhere to learn, and established relationships with drivers at early stages of their careers.

=== Formula 3 ===
In Formula 3, Lola partnered with Dome of Japan to produce a chassis in 2003. There they were competing with long-established Dallara, the two makers being among the last specialty race-car manufacturers in Europe. The partnership was broken in 2005, with Lola building their own chassis which won its debut race in the British series, but the Dallara near-monopoly held.

=== World Rally ===
The Lancer WRC04 with the 4G63 engine was mounted to a 5-speed semi-automatic transmission and a new all-wheel drive system co-developed by Ricardo Consulting Engineers and Mitsubishi Motors Motorsports (MMSP). The bodywork was subjected to extensive aerodynamic testing at Lola Cars&#x27; wind tunnel and significant changes to body were made after that.

== Naming scheme ==

At the time of Lola&#x27;s creation, their sports cars and formula cars followed a naming scheme of being numbered in order of construction, and preceded by the term Mark (Mk1 through Mk6). However, in 1964, the designations were altered to become Type (marked as simply T), with the first digit or two designating what type of car, and the final digit designating a variant of that car. This continued until 1986 when the numbering scheme was slightly altered. The T would remain, yet the next two digits would designate the year of original design, and the next two would designate what type of car it was. The final digit would again denote variants of that design. This was again slightly altered in 1998, with the T being replaced by a B, in honor of Lola&#x27;s owner Martin Birrane. The numbering system would however remain the same.

Since employing the new system in 1986, the final two digits stand for the following types of cars:
* /00 – CART and Champ Car
* /10 – Group C and IMSA GTP, Le Mans Prototype SR1, LMP900, and LMP1 classes
* /20 – Indy Lights
* /30 – Formula One, later replaced by Formula Three
* /40 – Le Mans Prototype SR2 and LMP2 classes
* /50 – Formula 3000 and Formula Nippon
* /60 – Le Mans Prototype LMP675 class, later LMP1 Coupes
* /70 – Mexican Formula 3000, later touring cars, now Daytona Prototypes
* /80 – Le Mans Prototype LMP2 Coupes
* /90 – Sports 2000

Therefore, a car like the T92/10 would be a 1992 Group C car, and the B02/00 would be a 2002 Champ Car chassis.

Note that the Lola former A1 Grand Prix cars currently do not have a designation that matches this scheme, and are marked simply as &quot;Lola A1GP&quot;. The evolution of this car used in the Euroseries 3000 and its immediate successor AutoGP was given the name B0552.

<text>The word dock () in American English refers to one or a group of human-made structures that are involved in the handling of boats or ships (usually on or near a shore). In British English, the term is not used the same way as in American English; it is used to mean the area of water that is next to or around a wharf or quay. The exact meaning varies among different variants of the English language.

&quot;Dock&quot; may also refer to a dockyard (also known as a shipyard) where the loading, unloading, building, or repairing of ships occurs.

==History==
The earliest known docks were those discovered in Wadi al-Jarf, an ancient Egyptian harbor, of Pharaoh Khufu, dating from c.2500 BC located on the Red Sea coast. Archaeologists also discovered anchors and storage jars near the site.

A dock from Lothal in India dates from 2400 BC and was located away from the main current to avoid deposition of silt. Modern oceanographers have observed that the ancient Harappans must have possessed great knowledge relating to tides in order to build such a dock on the ever-shifting course of the Sabarmati, as well as exemplary hydrography and maritime engineering. This is the earliest known dock found in the world equipped to berth and service ships.

It is speculated that Lothal engineers studied tidal movements and their effects on brick-built structures, since the walls are of kiln-burnt bricks. This knowledge also enabled them to select Lothal&#x27;s location in the first place, as the Gulf of Khambhat has the highest tidal amplitude and ships can be sluiced through flow tides in the river estuary. The engineers built a trapezoidal structure, with north–south arms of average 21.8 metres (71.5 ft), and east–west arms of 37 metres (121 ft).

==British English==

In British English, a dock is an enclosed area of water used for loading, unloading, building or repairing ships. Such a dock may be created by building enclosing harbour walls into an existing natural water space, or by excavation within what would otherwise be dry land.

There are specific types of dock structures where the water level is controlled:
* A wet dock or impounded dock is a variant in which the water is impounded either by dock gates or by a lock, thus allowing ships to remain afloat at low tide in places with high tidal ranges. The level of water in the dock is maintained despite the rising and falling of the tide. This makes transfer of cargo easier. It works like a lock which controls the water level and allows passage of ships. The world&#x27;s first enclosed wet dock with lock gates to maintain a constant water level irrespective of tidal conditions was the Howland Great Dock on the River Thames, built in 1703. The dock was merely a haven surrounded by trees, with no unloading facilities. The world&#x27;s first commercial enclosed wet dock, with quays and unloading warehouses, was the Old Dock at Liverpool, built in 1715 and held up to 100 ships. The dock reduced ship waiting giving quick turnarounds, greatly improving the throughput of cargo.
* A drydock is another variant, also with dock gates, which can be emptied of water to allow investigation and maintenance of the underwater parts of ships.
* A floating dry dock (sometimes just &quot;floating dock&quot;) is a submersible structure which lifts ships out of the water to allow dry docking where no land-based facilities are available.

Where the water level is not controlled berths may be:
* Floating, where there is always sufficient water to float the ship.
* NAABSA (Not Always Afloat But Safely Aground) where ships settle on the bottom at low tide. Ships using NAABSA facilities have to be designed for them.

A dockyard (or shipyard) consists of one or more docks, usually with other structures.

==American English==
In American English, &quot;dock&quot; is technically synonymous with &quot;pier&quot; or &quot;wharf&quot;—any human-made structure in the water intended for people to be on. However, in modern use, &quot;pier&quot; is generally used to refer to structures originally intended for industrial use, such as seafood processing or shipping, and more recently for cruise ships, and &quot;dock&quot; is used for almost everything else, often with a qualifier, such as ferry dock, swimming dock, ore dock and others. However, &quot;pier&quot; is also commonly used to refer to wooden or metal structures that extend into the ocean from beaches and are used, for the most part, to accommodate fishing in the ocean without using a boat.

In American English, the term for the water area between piers is &quot;slip&quot;.

===In parts of both the US and Canada===
In the cottage country of Canada and the United States, a dock is a wooden platform built over water, with one end secured to the shore. The platform is used for the boarding and offloading of small boats.

<doc id="676401" wikidata="Q2919751" url="?curid=676401" title="Targum Pseudo-Jonathan">
<text>Targum Pseudo-Jonathan (also known as the Jerusalem Targum, Targum Yerushalmi, or Targum Jonathan) is an Aramaic translation and interpretation (targum) of the Torah (Pentateuch) traditionally thought to have originated from the land of Israel, although more recently a provenance in 12th-century Italy has been proposed.

As a &quot;targum&quot;, it is not just a translation but incorporates aggadic material collected from various sources as late as the Midrash Rabbah as well as earlier material from the Talmud. So it is a combination of a commentary and a translation. It is also a composite text, involving the Old Palestinian Targum, Targum Onkelos, and a diverse array of other material.

== Name ==
The original name of Targum Pseudo-Jonathan was Targum Yerushalmi (Jerusalem Targum). However, due to an error in the fourteenth century, it came to be known as the Targum &quot;Jonathan&quot; instead of &quot;Jerusalem&quot; in reference to Jonathan ben Uzziel. Due to the pseudonymous nature of this attribution, it is now also referred to as the Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, although this is variously abbreviated as TPsJ or TgPsJ. There are editions of the Pentateuch that continue to call it Targum Jonathan to this day.

==Authorship==
The Talmud relates that Yonatan ben Uziel, a student of Hillel the Elder, fashioned an Aramaic translation of the Nevi&#x27;im. It makes no mention of any translation by him of the Torah. So all scholars agree that this Targum was not authored by Yonatan ben Uziel. Indeed, Azariah dei Rossi (16th century) reports that he saw two very similar complete Targumim to the Torah, one called &quot;Targum Yonatan Ben Uziel&quot; and the other called &quot;Targum Yerushalmi&quot;. A standard explanation is that the original title of this work was &quot;Targum Yerushalmi&quot;, which was abbreviated to ת&quot;י (TY), and these initials were then incorrectly expanded to &quot;Targum Yonatan&quot; which was then further incorrectly expanded to &quot;Targum Yonatan ben Uziel&quot;. For these reasons, scholars call it &quot;Targum Pseudo-Jonathan&quot;.

== Manuscripts ==
TPsJ is known from two extant sources. One is a manuscript called British Museum Add. 27031, stored at the British Museum in London, and first published by M. Ginsburger in 1903 though provenanced in 16th century Italy. Due to the many errors in Ginsburger&#x27;s edition, Rieder published a new edition of this manuscript in 1973. This manuscript bears the date 1598, though was written earlier, and was transcribed in an Italian hand. The second is the Venice edition first printed in 1591 and whose manuscripts were known earlier to Azariah dei Rossi (d. 1578), an Italian physician who discussed them in his work &quot;Meʾor ʿEynayim&quot; (1573–1575).

== Date ==

=== Range of possible dates ===
Earlier scholarship once posited that the TPsJ dated to the first century or earlier, although this approach has been widely abandoned. The Aramaic dialect used is late and TPsJ is likely the latest of the Pentateuchal Targums. Today, a wide variety of dates have been proposed for Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, ranging from the 4th to 12th centuries, although most date it to after the Islamic conquests and the upper boundary for the date of the text is the 13th century due to its citation in material from that time, specifically its repeated reference by Rabbi Menahem Recanati (1250–1310) in his &quot;Perush &#x27;Al ha-Torah&quot;. Earlier citations to the TPsJ are not known, and none exist in the works of Nathan b. Yehiel of Rome who otherwise cited Palestinian Targums many times. A small number of academics in recent times have continued to date the TPsJ prior to the Islamic conquests, and these have included Robert Hayward, Paul Flesher, and Beverly Mortensen who place the text between the late fourth century to the early fifth century.

=== &quot;Terminus post quem&quot; ===
A lower boundary for the date of TPsJ is given by references to certain external events, activities, and people. For example, TPsJ describes the six orders of the Mishnah, and the Mishnah dates to around 200. References can also be found to the city of Constantinople which was constructed in 324–330. Later still, the rendering of Genesis 21:21 in the TPsJ contains a polemic reducing the status of Ishmael and against Khadija (called Adisha in the text), the first wife of Muhammad, and a daughter of theirs name Fatima. As such, the current form of the targum must date to the mid-7th century at the earliest, although some argue that this material was inserted into an earlier core of the TPsJ at a later date with respect to its original composition.

=== Recent views ===
Paul Flesher and Bruce Chilton have argued that all three major Targums, including Pseudo-Jonathan, should date to the fifth century or earlier because of a lack of Arabic loanwords, for one, and that the Jerusalem Talmud describes a variant containing an expansion of Leviticus 22:28 in &quot;y&quot;. Ber. 5.3 (9c) whose only similar witness is in the TPsJ. More specifically, this expansion includes the phrase &#x27;My people, children of Israel&#x27; (‮עמי בני ישראל‬‎), which is known from Neofiti and the Cairo Geniza, as well as the phrase &#x27;As I am merciful in heaven, so shall you be merciful on earth&#x27;, only found in TPsJ. Flesher and Chilton take this to imply that the Jerusalem Talmud, which reached its form by the first half of the fifth century, has cited the TPsJ. However, Leeor Gottlieb has retorted that this only provides evidence for the presence of a tradition acting as the common source for the Jerusalem Talmud and TPsJ Lev. 22:28. Instead, Gottlieb dates the TPsJ to the end of the 12th century in Italy on the basis of a textual relationship with a 12th-century Hebrew lexicon which Gottlieb argues has priority over it. Independently, Gavin McDowell reached the same conclusion as Gottlieb, both for a provenance in the 12th century and for Italian origins, on the basis of his renewed argument for dependence of the TPsJ on the &quot;Pirkei De-Rabbi Eliezer&quot; composed in the 9th century, as well as the &quot;Chronicles of Moses&quot; dating to the 11th century. According to McDowell, a 12th-century Italian provenance also explains the absence of Arabic loanwords, which is sometimes used to argue for an early date.

<text>Guithelin was a legendary king of the Britons as accounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He became king after the death of Gurguit Barbtruc and reigned approximately 379 BC.

He ruled liberally and temperately for his life. His Queen consort was an artisan and noblewoman named Marcia; when he died, his wife took over the government as regent for their son, Sisillius II.

<doc id="676406" wikidata="Q181277" url="?curid=676406" title="Plethysmograph">
<text>A plethysmograph is an instrument for measuring changes in volume within an organ or whole body (usually resulting from fluctuations in the amount of blood or air it contains). The word is derived from the Greek &quot;plethysmos&quot; (increasing, enlarging, becoming full), and &quot;graphein&quot; (to write).

==Organs studied==

===Lungs===

Pulmonary plethysmographs are commonly used to measure the functional residual capacity (FRC) of the lungs—the volume in the lungs when the muscles of respiration are relaxed—and total lung capacity.

In a traditional plethysmograph (or &quot;body box&quot;), the test subject, or patient, is placed inside a sealed chamber the size of a small telephone booth with a single mouthpiece. At the end of normal expiration, the mouthpiece is closed. The patient is then asked to make an inspiratory effort. As the patient tries to inhale (a maneuver which looks and feels like panting), the lungs expand, decreasing pressure within the lungs and increasing lung volume. This, in turn, increases the pressure within the box since it is a closed system and the volume of the box compartment has decreased to accommodate the new volume of the subject.

With cabinless plethysmography, the patient is seated next to a desktop testing device and inserts the mouthpiece into their mouth. The patient takes a series of normal tidal breaths for approximately one minute. During this tidal breathing, a series of rapid interruptions occurs, with a shutter opening and closing, measuring pressure and volume. Lung volume measurements taken with cabinless plethysmography are considered equivalent to body plethysmography.

==== Methodological approach ====
Boyle&#x27;s law is used to calculate the unknown volume within the lungs. First, the change in volume of the chest is computed. The initial pressure of the box times its volume is considered equal to the known pressure after expansion times the unknown new volume. Once the new volume is found, the original volume minus the new volume is the change in volume in the box and also the change in volume in the chest. With this information, Boyle&#x27;s law is used again to determine the original volume of gas in the chest: the initial volume (unknown) times the initial pressure is equal to the final volume times the final pressure. Starting from this principle, it can be shown that the functional residual capacity is a function of the changes in volume and pressures as follows:

formula_1

The difference between full and empty lungs can be used to assess diseases and airway passage restrictions. An obstructive disease will show increased FRC because some airways do not empty normally, while a restrictive disease will show decreased FRC. Body plethysmography is particularly appropriate for patients who have air spaces which do not communicate with the bronchial tree; in such patients helium dilution would give an incorrectly low reading.

Another important parameter, which can be calculated with a body plethysmograph is the airway resistance. During inhalation the chest expands, which increases the pressure within the box. While observing the so-called resistance loop (cabin pressure and flow), diseases can easily be recognized. If the resistance loop becomes planar, this shows a bad compliance of the lung. A COPD, for instance, can easily be discovered because of the unique shape of the corresponding resistance loop.

===Limbs===

Some plethysmograph devices are attached to arms, legs or other extremities and used to determine circulatory capacity.
In water plethysmography an extremity, e.g. an arm, is enclosed in a water-filled chamber where volume changes can be detected. Air plethysmography uses a similar principle but based on an air-filled long cuff, which is more convenient but less accurate.
Another practical device is mercury-filled strain gauges used to continuously measure circumference of the extremity, e.g. at mid calf.
Impedance plethysmography is a non-invasive method used to detect venous thrombosis in these areas of the body.

===Genitals===

Another common type of plethysmograph is the penile plethysmograph. This device is used to measure changes in blood flow in the penis. Although some researchers use this device to assess sexual arousal and sexual orientation, courts that have considered penile plethysmography generally rule that the technique is not sufficiently reliable for use in court. An approximate female equivalent to penile plethysmography is vaginal photoplethysmography, which optically measures blood flow in the vagina.

==Use in preclinical research==
Plethysmography is a widely used method in basic and preclinical research to study respiration. Several techniques are used:

===Respiratory parameters from conscious freely moving animals: whole-body plethysmography===
Whole-body plethysmography is used to measure respiratory parameters in conscious unrestrained subjects, including quantification of bronchoconstriction.

The standard plethysmograph sizes are for the study of mice, rats and guinea pigs. On request, larger plethysmographs can also be manufactured for other animals, such as rabbits, dogs, pigs, or primates.

The plethysmograph has two chambers, each fitted with a pneumotachograph. The subject is placed in one of them (subject chamber) and the other remains empty (reference chamber).

The pressure change is measured by a differential pressure transducer with one port exposed to the subject chamber and the other to the reference chamber.

===Respiratory parameters from conscious restrained animals: double-chamber / head-out plethysmography===
The double-chamber plethysmograph (dcp) measures respiratory parameters in a conscious restrained subject, including airway resistance and conductance. Different sizes of plethysmograph exist to study mice, rats or guinea pigs.

The head-out configuration is identical to the standard configuration described above except that there is no head chamber.

Of course the collar seal is still applied, so that the body chamber remains airtight. With only a thoracic signal, all parameters can be obtained except for specific airway resistance (SRaw) and specific airway conductance (Sgaw).

===Resistance/compliance from sedated animals===

In anesthetized plethysmography, lung resistance and dynamic compliance are measured directly because the subject is anesthetized.

Depending on the level of sedation, the subject may be spontaneously breathing (SB configuration) or under mechanical ventilation (MV configuration).
A flow signal and a pressure signal are required to calculate compliance and resistance.

===Cerebral blood flow===

Cerebral venous blood flow has been recently studied trying to establish a connection between Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency and multiple sclerosis. The small study is not big enough to establish a conclusion, but some association has been shown.

<doc id="676409" wikidata="Q158940" url="?curid=676409" title="Bane (DC Comics)">
<text>Bane is a supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by Chuck Dixon, Doug Moench, and Graham Nolan, the character first appeared in &quot;Batman: Vengeance of Bane&quot; #1 (January 1993). He has become one of the superhero Batman’s most enduring enemies belonging to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery.

In his comic book appearances, Bane is an international criminal with a mix of brute strength and exceptional intelligence. Born and raised in the Peña Duro prison on the Caribbean island of Santa Prisca where he served a life sentence for his elusive father King Snake&#x27;s revolutionary ways, he serves as a test subject for the super-steroid known as &quot;Venom&quot;. Bane uses his enhanced strength to escape and heads to Gotham City, where he defeats and breaks the back of its protector, Batman. Famous for having symbolically &quot;Broken the Bat&quot;, Bane is often credited as the only villain to have bested Batman both physically and mentally.

The character has been adapted in various media incarnations, having been portrayed in film by Robert Swenson in the 1997 film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, and Tom Hardy in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, and in television by Shane West in the Fox series &quot;Gotham&quot;. Henry Silva, Héctor Elizondo, Danny Trejo, Fred Tatasciore, JB Blanc, and others have provided Bane&#x27;s voice in animation and video games. &quot;IGN&quot;″s list of the Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time ranked Bane as #34.

==Publication history==

Chuck Dixon and Graham Nolan created the character for the &quot;&quot; storyline. They developed the concept of Bane after an initial idea by Batman editor Dennis O&#x27;Neil.

O&#x27;Neil had previously created Bane&#x27;s birthplace of Santa Prisca in &quot;The Question&quot; and the drug Venom in the storyline of the same name (published in the pages of &quot;Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight&quot; #16–20, and later reprinted as a trade paperback). In the pages of &quot;Azrael&quot;, O&#x27;Neil introduced Bane&#x27;s perception of Venom as both an addiction and the weakness responsible for his earlier defeats.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin story===
Bane&#x27;s origin story is established in the storyline &quot;Guttenberg&quot;. His father, Edmund Dorrance (better known as King Snake), had been a revolutionary who had escaped the court system of Santa Prisca, an island country in the Caribbean. Upon Dorrance&#x27;s death, the corrupt government decreed that his young son would serve out the man&#x27;s life sentence, and thus Bane spent his childhood and early adult life in the country&#x27;s Peña Duro prison. Although he was imprisoned, his natural abilities allowed him to develop extraordinary skills within the prison&#x27;s walls. He read as many books as he could get his hands on, spent most of his spare time doing bodybuilding training in the prison&#x27;s gym, developed his own form of meditation, and learned to fight in the merciless school of prison life. Because of the cultural and supposed geographical location of Santa Prisca, Bane knew how to speak English, Spanish, Portuguese, Farsi, Urdu and Latin. Despite his circumstances, he found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly Jesuit priest, under whose tutelage he apparently received a classical education. Bane murdered this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later. He committed his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison. During his years in prison, Bane carried a teddy bear he called &quot;Osito&quot; (&quot;little bear&quot; in Spanish), whom he considered his only friend. It is revealed that Osito has a hole in his back to hold a knife that Bane used to defend himself.

Bane is tortured by a monstrous, terrifying bat creature that appears in his dreams, thus giving him an intense fear of bats. He ultimately established himself as the &quot;king&quot; of Peña Duro prison and became known as Bane. The prison&#x27;s controllers took note and eventually forced him to become a test subject for a mysterious drug known as Venom, which had killed all other subjects. The Peña Duro prison Venom experiment nearly killed Bane at first, but he survived and found that the drug vastly increases his physical strength, although he needs to take it every 12 hours, pumped directly into his brain via a system of tubes, or he will suffer debilitating side-effects, thus rendering him addicted. Bane escapes Peña Duro, along with several accomplices based on the Fabulous Five (his minions Trogg, Zombie and Angel Vallelunga/Bird, all of whom are named after 1960s rock bands—The Troggs, The Zombies, and The Byrds—and are designed to mimic three of Doc Savage&#x27;s assistants Monk, Ham, and Renny). His ambition turns to destroying Batman, about whom he had heard stories from Bird. Gotham City fascinates Bane because, like Peña Duro, fear rules Gotham—but it is the fear of Batman. Bane is convinced that Batman is a personification of the demonic bat that had haunted his dreams since childhood. Therefore, Bane believes fate placed Batman on a collision course with him.

In &quot;Joker&quot; #8, it is revealed that Bane&#x27;s daughter Vengeance was created in a laboratory by scientists.

===&quot;Batman: Knightfall&quot;===

During the &quot;Knightfall&quot; storyline, Bane, wanting Batman reduced to his weakest physical and psychological state, uses stolen munitions to destroy the walls of Arkham Asylum—allowing its deranged inmates (including the Joker, Two-Face, the Riddler, the Scarecrow, the Mad Hatter, the Ventriloquist, Firefly, Poison Ivy, Cornelius Stirk, Film Freak and Victor Zsasz) to escape into Gotham City. During this time, Bane murdered Film Freak who acted as the Mad Hatter&#x27;s mind-controlled assassin, kidnapped and unsuccessfully interrogated Robin who was spying on him, and had a bloody rematch with Killer Croc which ended in a stalemate as they were washed out of the sewer. Consequently, Batman is forced to recapture the escapees, a mission that takes him three months and drives him to the brink of mental and physical collapse. Exhausted, Batman returns to his home in Wayne Manor, only to find Bane waiting for him. Bane attacks Batman and beats him nearly to death, and delivers a brutal final blow in which he raises Batman up and breaks him over one knee, leaving him a paraplegic. Bane thus becomes the only man to have &quot;Broken the Bat&quot;. This iconic moment is incorporated in &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;, &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;″s &quot;DC Comics Special&quot; and alluded to numerous times in the DCAU.

While Bane establishes himself as the new ruler of Gotham&#x27;s criminal underworld, Bruce Wayne passed the mantle of Batman to Jean-Paul Valley, also known as Azrael. Ignoring Bruce&#x27;s warnings to stay away from Bane, Azrael attempts to confront the villain in his penthouse suite. Azrael has by now added a set of high-tech, heavy metal gauntlets to the Batsuit, and uses them to shoot sharp projectiles at Bane. However, Bane is able to get the upper hand in the fight after using Venom and taunting Azrael, making him angry enough to lose focus and, thus, give Bane the opportunity to beat him. Nevertheless, Bane sustains deep lacerations in the battle and loses a great deal of blood.

Unable to go to a hospital, Bane increases his Venom intake to temporarily block the pain and buy himself time to defeat the new Batman. A humiliated Azrael returned to the Batcave and builds an advanced combat suit of metal, in place of the traditional Batsuit, with many chambers within the suit that fire razor-sharp weapons. Reduced to little more than a wounded animal fleeing for survival, Bane is no match against the &quot;new&quot; Batman. Bane is finally defeated when Azrael severs the tubes that pump Venom into his bloodstream, causing severe withdrawal. Commissioner James &quot;Jim&quot; Gordon, Harvey Bullock, and Robin watch in horror as this new Batman tortures a defeated Bane, who begs his adversary to kill him. Azrael denies his innate urge to kill Bane, however, and leaves him humiliated and broken physically and mentally for the police to arrest.

===Mask===
Further following the events of &quot;Knightfall&quot;, Bane recovers from his Venom addiction while serving time in Blackgate Prison. He rebuilt his body to its peak and eventually escapes from prison and returns to Gotham, where he fights alongside the original Batman, who has by now recovered and taken his mantle back from Azrael, to take out a criminal ring that is distributing a Venom derivative to street-level thugs. Following a victory over the criminals (and the revelation that behind it is the same doctor that performed the surgery on Bane years earlier in Peña Duro), Bane proclaims that he is &quot;innocent&quot; of his past crimes and urges Batman to stop hunting him. He then leaves Gotham, without fighting Batman, to begin a search for his unknown father.

Bane&#x27;s search brings him back to Santa Prisca. In search of leads, Bane questions the Jesuit priest who had taught him while he was in Peña Duro. The priest explains that there were four men who could possibly have been his father: a Santa Priscan revolutionary, an American doctor, an English mercenary, and a Swiss banker. While searching for the Swiss man in Rome, Bane encounters Talia al Ghul and the League of Assassins and eventually impresses Ra&#x27;s al Ghul so much that he chooses Bane to marry Talia and become his heir. Ra&#x27;s also has discovered Bane&#x27;s father&#x27;s identity, but did not reveal this information to him. Ra&#x27;s al Ghul then launches a plague attack on Gotham in the &quot;Legacy&quot; storyline, with Bane at his side, who is posing as Ra&#x27;s al Ghul&#x27;s henchman Ubu. Batman gets his rematch with Bane in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #701 and finally defeats him in single combat. Disappointed by his protegé&#x27;s failure, Ra&#x27;s calls off the engagement to Talia and disowns Bane.

Following the &quot;Legacy&quot; storyline, Bane appears in a one-shot publication called &quot;Batman: Bane&quot; (1997) with the intent of destroying Gotham City using a nuclear reactor. Batman foils the plot, however. During the &quot;Angel and the Bane&quot; storyline, Bane ambushes Azrael, brutally defeating and capturing him, before getting him addicted to an even more potent form of Venom. Azrael ultimately escaped into the jungle with Nomoz and successfully, albeit painfully, overcame his addiction with his enhanced stamina and strong will. The weakened and injured Azrael managed to psyche out and defeat Bane before escorting him back to the Cataclysm ravaged Gotham. Once in Gotham, Bane briefly escaped during an aftershock before Azrael quickly recaptured him. Bane then surfaces in the story arc &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, serving as an enforcer for Lex Luthor during Luthor&#x27;s attempts to take control of Gotham under the cover of helping it to rebuild, but Batman convinces Bane to leave after a brief confrontation between Bane and the Joker. Following the fallout with Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, Bane embarks on a campaign to destroy Lazarus Pits around the world, and in the process, encounters the Black Canary.

===&quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; and &quot;Veritas Liberat&quot;===
In the &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; storyline, Bane learns from the Jesuit priest that there is a possibility that his biological father is an American doctor. In researching this issue, Bane comes to the conclusion that he and Batman share a biological father: Thomas Wayne, who had been close to Bane&#x27;s mother during his time in Santa Prisca. Bane alerts Batman to this possibility and, during the time that the DNA tests are being performed, stays at Wayne Manor and fights alongside Batman on the streets of Gotham. Ultimately, it is revealed that Dr. Wayne is not Bane&#x27;s father, and Bane leaves Gotham peacefully – and with Batman&#x27;s blessing and financial backing – to pursue leads in the snowy mountains of Kangchenjunga.

Bane eventually finds his father, who turns out to be the unscrupulous King Snake, in the &quot;Veritas Liberat&quot; storyline. Bane, with Batman looking on, helps foil King Snake&#x27;s plans to unleash a powerful weapon upon the world. Bane saves Batman from being shot by King Snake, but is mortally wounded in the process. Batman then saves Bane by bathing him in a Lazarus Pit, and leaves him with a clean slate.

===&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; and &quot;One Year Later&quot;===
In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #7, Bane fights alongside the villains during the Battle of Metropolis. During the battle, he breaks the back of the hero Judomaster, killing him. No reason was given for his actions in #7, though in the &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; collected edition, one of the many changes made to the original series was Bane saying &quot;I finally know who I am. I am &#x27;Bane&#x27;. I &#x27;break&#x27; people.&quot;

Bane resurfaces in the &quot;One Year Later&quot; continuity of &quot;JSA Classified&quot; #17–18 searching for the Hourmen (Rex and Rick Tyler), asking them for help. To win their trust, he tells them how, prior to the Battle of Metropolis, he returned to his homeland to put an end to the drug lords&#x27; government and in the process discovered that a new, more addictive strain of Venom had been created. In his furious carelessness to wipe out the drug trade, he was captured, and re-implanted with the cranial tubes, hooked to the new Venom, and now unable to shake off his addiction without dying from the withdrawal. Bane was forced to work as an enforcer for the drug cartel, unable to escape. Believing that Bane sought Rex Tyler&#x27;s expertise in chemistry, Rick lets him approach his father, only to discover that the story is a ruse. Bane, who had never truly been addicted to Venom, had in fact wiped out the drug lords and destroyed every research note on Venom. He discovered in the process both strains of Venom derived from Rex Tyler&#x27;s early research on Miraclo. He discovers from the Tylers that no written notes exist of Rex&#x27;s work, captures Rex, and steals Rick&#x27;s equipment, planning to kill Rex and force Rick to take the last of the new Venom, living forever as an addict. Rick manipulates Bane into using Miraclo and demolishing the building as he and his father escape, burying the mercenary in the rubble of the very same Santa Priscan penitentiary where his story began.

Eventually, Bane resurfaces in Santa Prisca and leads the country to democratic elections. Upon discovering that the elections were rigged by Computron, he uses his influence to enforce martial law, plunging the country into a civil war. Computron offers information to Checkmate who ordered him to rig the elections in exchange for their help to escape the country. Fire and Judomaster&#x27;s son, Thomas Jagger, are sent on the mission, with Jagger debating whether or not to seek revenge for his father&#x27;s murder. He fights Bane in order to allow Fire to escape, defeating him easily, but chooses not to kill him. At the end of the miniseries &quot;Suicide Squad: Raise the Flag&quot;, Amanda Waller recruits Bane into the Squad. In &quot;Outsiders&quot; #50, he appears once more to be wearing the tubing system to apply Venom. In &quot;Salvation Run&quot; #2, Bane is tricked by his fellow squad members, and sent to the prison planet. In &quot;Salvation Run&quot; #3, Bane remains with Lex Luthor&#x27;s faction after the Joker&#x27;s faction rebels against Luthor&#x27;s leadership. He attacks Thunder and Lightning when they were attempting to feed Martian Manhunter. &quot;Superman/Batman&quot; #53-#56 reveals Bane is trading his Venom supplies with drug lords around the globe. One of his shipments includes a trip to Gotham. Batman, who was temporarily endowed with Superman&#x27;s powers, responded by attacking Bane at his home. Not only was the Dark Knight able to easily defeat the villain, the hero nearly killed him with his far superior strength. Bane survived his injuries due to the enhanced stamina from his Venom supplies.

===&quot;Secret Six&quot; vol. 3===
From September 2008, Bane appears as a regular character in the ongoing &quot;Secret Six&quot; series. In the first issue, Bane is depicted as a stoic devil&#x27;s advocate for the group, offering alternative points of view for both Deadshot and Catman on the subject of love. He is later shown to have an almost fatherlike concern for Scandal Savage&#x27;s well-being. Although this is largely played for laughs in the early issues, the first arc&#x27;s final issue displays the depth of Bane&#x27;s affection. When the Six are attacked by an army of supervillains, a wounded (and seemingly dying) Bane&#x27;s concern for Scandal results in temporarily breaking his vow to never take Venom again in order to save her. Bane is later shown to have recovered from his ordeal, appearing in Gotham City with Cat-Man and Ragdoll in an attempt to stem some of the chaos caused by the apparent death of Batman. During the team&#x27;s several escapades, Bane reveals both deep respects for his onetime adversary and a painful yearning to assume the mantle of Batman, telling a trio of rescued citizens to tell people that it was the Batman who saved them. Bane ultimately gives his blessing to Dick Grayson, praying that &quot;God help him.&quot; Following a near-disastrous mission, Bane assumes leadership over the Six. His first act as leader is to remove Scandal from active duty, not wishing for her to be endangered. In the latest issue of &quot;Secret Six&quot;, Bane&#x27;s Secret Six and Scandal Savage&#x27;s Secret Six finally square off against each other. Bane and Scandal engage in a one on one fight where he refuses to fight back until Scandal uses her Lamentation Blades to slash his throat. The card is ultimately used to resurrect Knockout.

Driven to near madness, Bane decides to lead the Secret Six to Gotham in an attempt to psychologically break Batman by killing several of his closest allies. The team kidnaps the Penguin, who Bane pumps for information about Batman&#x27;s partners. In the final issue of the series, Bane ultimately decides on the Red Robin, Azrael and Batgirl as his victims. Before the Six can make their move, the Penguin betrays their location, resulting in a massive army of superheroes ranging from Green Lantern, Batman and the Superman family to the Justice League, the Birds of Prey, and Booster Gold converging on Gotham. The Secret Six stage a desperate last stand, but are quickly defeated. With the fates of the other Secret Six members left ambiguous, Bane is last shown being driven away in a Gotham police van. The ending of the issue implies that he plans to escape.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Bane is re-introduced in the DCU by Paul Jenkins, and David Finch&#x27;s run on &quot;&quot; (vol. 2). As Bruce Wayne is unable to keep up with the various legal conspiracies involving Batman Incorporated, he decides to investigate a breakout in Arkham. There, he finds criminals being fed a modified fear toxin that is mixed in with Venom which makes the criminals extremely strong and immune to fear. He finds it being given to criminals by a new foe named the White Rabbit; when Batman approaches her, she quickly defeats him and injects him with the fear toxin, which she then gives to the Flash. Bruce then finds Bane to be behind the new fear toxin and combats him. Bruce manages to burn the fear toxin out of his and the Flash&#x27;s bodies by getting pushed to the limit. Bruce manages to defeat Bane and knock him off an edge, but is left confused by the White Rabbit. Bane is then washed away by the tide.

Bane later appears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; vol. 2 #19, in the story &quot;War Council&quot;. There, his look had been altered to include a vest and cargo pants, and he now has an army serving him. In the story, it is revealed in a flashback that prior to his appearance in &quot;Batman: The Dark Knight&quot;, Bane had intended to steal a nuclear device to threaten Gotham City, only to have a run-in with the Court of Owls, who prevented him from stealing the device and did not want him to interfere with their plans. Later, after Batman defeats Bane, a mysterious figure confronts the villain and informs him that the Court of Owls had undermined his plans. Bane returns to Santa Prisca to lead his army against them.

During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Scarecrow learns that Bane may be the cause of the Blackgate uprising and will be their leader in the impending war and that the Talons were stored at Blackgate on ice. Bane, having escaped Peña Dura Prison in Santa Prisca, ships his Venom to Gotham City to be there for when he arrives. As he is traveling to Gotham, he orchestrates the release of Blackgate&#x27;s prisoners during the Crime Syndicate&#x27;s broadcast to the world. Later, on board his ship, he prepares his men for the impending war with Scarecrow, and with Gotham in the distant, claims it will be his. Bane enters Blackgate through the sewers to join the prisoners there. While there, he comes across where the Talons are stored hoping to make them into his weapons. While the attack on Gotham City begins between Bane&#x27;s men and the GCPD, Bane also approaches Professor Pyg, forcing him to join his cause, and spread word that everything in Gotham is now controlled by Bane. Bane arrives at Blackgate as the Man-Bat and his fellow bats are attempting to transport the Talons to Mr. Freeze and is able to keep one from leaving. Bane retrieves Emperor Penguin for the Penguin as part of their agreement.

When Bane brings Emperor Penguin to the Penguin, the Penguin tells him that the Arkham fighters are not scared of Bane, as he does not instill fear as Batman did. Realizing this, Bane constructs a Batsuit for himself and heads to Wayne Tower to confront Killer Croc. Bane fights Killer Croc and is able to defeat him, setting his sights on retrieving the Talons. Bane wakes up the Talon William Cobb and takes him through Gotham where he fights various inmates of Arkham Asylum. Bane begins recruiting Gotham citizens to his side, offering his base at Wayne Tower as a haven to the people to escape the rule of the Arkham inmates. He tells Cobb his plan to turn the city over to the Court, in exchange for use of Talons at his disposal to be powered by his Venom. The Talons attack Bane&#x27;s men, and eventually set their target on Bane. With Cobb&#x27;s help, Bane is able to injure the Talons enough to activate their regenerative powers to remove the mind-control technology.

During &quot;&quot;, after Alfred is attacked by Hush and infected with a fear toxin, he is briefly transferred to Arkham before it is attacked as part of the conspiracy. However, Alfred manages to survive the explosion of the asylum and trick Bane into helping him reach an emergency cave Batman had installed under Arkham, the cave&#x27;s defenses knocking Bane out and allowing Alfred to call for help.

===DC Rebirth===
At the beginning of the DC Rebirth continuity, Bane still lives in Santa Prisca. In &quot;Batman&quot; vol. 3 #6, it is revealed that he had been trading Venom to Professor Hugo Strange in exchange for the services of the Psycho-Pirate, who was helping him overcome his addiction to the substance. Strange then used the Venom to revive the corpses of several of his patients, as seen in the &quot;Night of the Monster Men&quot; crossover. In &quot;Batman&quot; vol. 3 #10, Batman, per the suggestion of Amanda Waller, undertakes a suicide mission to Santa Prisca aided by Catwoman, the Bronze Tiger, the Ventriloquist, and the clown couple Punch and Jewellee to take the Psycho-Pirate from Bane. Batman needs the Psycho-Pirate to undo the damage he caused to Gotham Girl, and each member of the team will receive some sort of reward for their efforts. Bane captures Batman shortly after he arrives, and then breaks his back again and throws him into the cell where he spent his childhood. Batman escapes, however, and fixes his back on his own. After allowing Catwoman to &quot;betray&quot; him and having the Bronze Tiger and Punch and Jewellee fake their deaths, Batman uses the Ventriloquist to incapacitate the Psycho-Pirate and tells Catwoman to break Bane&#x27;s back. This act of humiliation and the loss of the Psycho-Pirate causes Bane to snap and scream for Venom from the prison guards.

In &quot;Batman&quot; vol. 3 #16, Bane has recruited his old henchmen Bird, Trogg, and Zombie in his quest to break Batman once and for all before recapturing the Psycho-Pirate from Arkham Asylum. Bane hangs Dick Grayson, Jason Todd, and Damian Wayne in the Batcave before setting off for the asylum, but the three survive. Bane&#x27;s henchmen then capture Catwoman, Duke Thomas, Commissioner Gordon, and the Bronze Tiger to cut Batman off from his allies. Bane beats Batman savagely in an alley and believes him dead, but finds out that Catwoman has escaped, freed the rest of the hostages, and tied up Bane&#x27;s henchmen, giving Batman a chance to flee. Enraged, Bane storms Arkham Asylum where Alfred is forcing the Psycho-Pirate to undo the fear he inflicted upon Gotham Girl. Batman decides to release many of the inmates to fight Bane and thus buy Alfred and the Psycho-Pirate more time, but Bane easily beats the likes of Two-Face, Solomon Grundy, Amygdala, the Scarecrow, the Firefly, and the Mad Hatter, among others, before making the Riddler open a door to Batman for him. Bane and Batman then have another fight, with a bloodied Batman barely beating his nemesis. In &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, a partial clone of Bane was introduced named &quot;Vengeance&quot;, hunting Joker for information of her father.

====&quot;Bane: Conquest&quot;====
In the 12-issue miniseries &quot;Bane: Conquest&quot;, it is revealed that Bane survived his fight with Batman, as he focuses on his criminal exploits outside of Gotham City. Bane and his trio Bird, Zombie, and Trogg, investigate a group of mercenaries who are transporting nuclear weapons to Gotham. Bane is captured alongside Bruce Wayne, but the pair escape together. Bane defeats the mercenaries and their leader, Dionysus, who is little more than a head and two pairs of limbs. 

Bane and his trio decide to appropriate Dionysus&#x27; vast criminal empire. They then attempt to destroy criminal rival organizations Vor and Kobra. Bane kidnaps the infant heir to Kobra, but Batman intervenes and appeals to his humanity, leading Bane to abandon the child for adoption.

==Powers and abilities==
Bane is highly intelligent; in &quot;Bane of the Demon&quot;, Ra&#x27;s al Ghul says that Bane &quot;has a mind equal to the greatest he has known&quot; (although he dismisses Bane&#x27;s abilities as the cunning of an animal rather than the cultured, trained intellect of Batman). His strength is sufficient for him to lift 15 tons.

In prison, he taught himself various scientific disciplines equal to the level of understanding of leading experts in those fields. He knows ten active languages and at least four additional arcane and dead ones. Among these are Spanish, English, French, German, Russian, Mandarin Chinese,
Persian, Dari, Urdu, and Latin. The &quot;Bane of the Demon&quot; storyline reveals that he has an eidetic memory. Within one year, he is able to deduce Batman&#x27;s secret identity.

He is also highly devious and a superb strategist and tactician. In prison, Bane also invented his own form of calisthenics, meditation, and a fighting style that he uses against other well-known martial arts fighters within the DC Universe. Bane creator Chuck Dixon&#x27;s early tales portray Bane as a very calm, centered warrior akin to Bruce Lee; in as much that he draws strength through calm meditation and the spiritual energy of the &quot;very rock of Peña Dura&quot;. Dixon imbued Bane with an almost supernatural quality when he explained that Bane triumphed in all of his prison fights by employing these abilities, while his opponents had only rage and greed to propel them. Multiple scenes in &quot;Vengeance of Bane&quot; explore this aspect when it explains that Bane&#x27;s mastery of meditation techniques &quot;made time and space playthings to him.&quot; A subsequent scene that reinforces this ability comes when Bird first comes to Bane for help because he heard from other inmates that Bane has &quot;magic ... the kind that enables him to travel beyond the prison walls.&quot; Usage of Venom enhances his physical abilities, including his strength and healing process, to superhuman levels. In most incarnations of the character, Bane requires a specialized tank to help control the amount of Venom which he injects into his body.

Although Bane had sworn off using Venom in &quot;Vengeance of Bane II&quot; in 1995, and his character is actually written as having kept that promise to himself, it is still not uncommon for artists to draw Bane as still wearing the tube leading from his old wrist device to the back of his head, as well as almost all media adaptations of the character, show him actively using the Venom compound. Writer Gail Simone explained these lapses in the continuity of Bane&#x27;s appearance in an issue of &quot;Secret Six&quot;, in which Deadshot remarked that Bane merely kept his old Venom equipment with him out of habit, even though Bane states that he would sooner die than use it again. However, he does use the venom to save his comrade and daughter-figure, Scandal Savage.

==Other versions==
===Amalgam Comics===
In the &quot;Amalgam Universe&quot;, Bane was combined with Marvel Comics&#x27; Nuke as HYDRA&#x27;s Bane Simpson. Another version of Bane was merged with the Punisher and called the &quot;Banisher&quot;. He is described as a &quot;gun-toting, drugged up anti-hero who broke Bruce Wayne&#x27;s back.&quot;

===&quot;Kingdom Come&quot;===
In the &quot;Kingdom Come&quot; reality, an aged Bruce Wayne mentions to Superman that Bane and Two-Face broke into Wayne Manor and destroyed it, after Batman&#x27;s identity was exposed, leaving only the Batcave intact.

===&quot;Elseworlds&quot;===
Bane appeared in numerous &quot;Elseworlds&quot; including &quot;Batman: Nosferatu&quot; as a low-level criminal; a dead Bane appears in a brief cameo in &quot;JLA: Riddle of the Beast&quot;, killed by the Green Arrow.

===&quot;Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;===
In &quot;Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;, Bane was mutated into a humanoid mutant African elephant by Shredder. Bane is eventually defeated by Batman and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and returns to normal along with the other villains while in A.R.G.U.S. custody. In the sequel miniseries, Bane is chosen by a faction of the League of Assassins to serve as their new leader, in the belief that only he has the strength to succeed where Ra&#x27;s has failed, but when Donatello attempts to travel back to Batman&#x27;s universe to talk with him about his current feelings of inadequacy, the transporter instead causes Donatello to swap with Bane, resulting in Bane taking over the Foot Clan and New York after developing an enhanced Venom produced by Baxter Stockman. He is eventually taken down by the Bat-Family, the Turtles, and Shredder.

===&quot;Batman: White Knight&quot;===
Bane appears in the 2017 series &quot;&quot;. Bane, along with several other Batman villains, is tricked by Jack Napier (who in this reality was a Joker who had been force-fed an overdose of pills by Batman, which temporarily cured him of his insanity) into drinking drinks that had been laced with particles from Clayface&#x27;s body. This was done so that Napier, who was using the Mad Hatter&#x27;s technology to control Clayface, could control them by way of Clayface&#x27;s ability to control parts of his body that had been separated from him. Bane also appears in the sequel storyline &quot;&quot;, being among the villains murdered by Azrael.

<text>Cathedral Peak is part of the Cathedral Range, a mountain range in the south-central portion of Yosemite National Park in eastern Mariposa and Tuolumne Counties. The range is an offshoot of the Sierra Nevada. The peak which lends its name to the range derives its name from its cathedral-shaped peak, which was formed by glacial activity: the peak remained uneroded above the glaciers in the Pleistocene.

== Geography ==

Cathedral Peak has a subsidiary summit to the west called Eichorn Pinnacle, for Jules Eichorn, who first ascended a class 5.4 route to its summit on July 24, 1931, with Glen Dawson.

In 1869, John Muir wrote in &quot;My first summer in the Sierra&quot;:
== Geology ==
The Cathedral Peak Granodiorite of Cathedral Peak is an intrusion into an area of older intrusive (or plutonic) and metamorphic rock in the Sierra Nevada Batholith. It is part of a grouping of intrusions called the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite. Cathedral Peak is the youngest of the rock formations in the Suite, dating to the Cretaceous Period at 83 million years ago. Its composition is mainly granodiorite with phenocrysts of microcline.

Cathedral Peak was a nunatak during the Tioga glaciation of the last ice age, the peak projected above the glaciers, which carved and sharpened the peak&#x27;s base while plucking away at its sides.

<text>Marcia was the legendary third female ruler and a regent of the Britons, as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. She is presented by Geoffrey as &quot;one of the most illustrious and praiseworthy of women in early British history&quot;.

==Mythical account==
Marcia became Queen consort when she married Guithelin (Welsh: Kyhylyn) and ruled as regent for her son, Sisillius II. In her youth, she was a noblewoman and knowledgeable in all the arts. 
Queen Marcia ruled Britain for about five years after Guithelin&#x27;s death because their son was just seven years old at the time.

Geoffrey says that Queen Marcia was a learned woman who codified the Marcian Laws, the &quot;Lex Martiana.&quot; King Alfred the Great was later to translate the code into Old English as the basis of Mercian Laws, believing them to have been named after the much later Saxon kingdom of Mercia.

Sisillius (Welsh: Saessyllt), came to the throne in ca 358 BC on Queen Marcia&#x27;s death.

<doc id="676418" wikidata="Q1500431" url="?curid=676418" title="Reflection seismology">
<text>Reflection seismology (or seismic reflection) is a method of exploration geophysics that uses the principles of seismology to estimate the properties of the Earth&#x27;s subsurface from reflected seismic waves. The method requires a controlled seismic source of energy, such as dynamite or Tovex blast, a specialized air gun or a seismic vibrator. Reflection seismology is similar to sonar and echolocation.
==History==
Reflections and refractions of seismic waves at geologic interfaces within the Earth were first observed on recordings of earthquake-generated seismic waves. The basic model of the Earth&#x27;s deep interior is based on observations of earthquake-generated seismic waves transmitted through the Earth&#x27;s interior (e.g., Mohorovičić, 1910). The use of human-generated seismic waves to map in detail the geology of the upper few kilometers of the Earth&#x27;s crust followed shortly thereafter and has developed mainly due to commercial enterprise, particularly the petroleum industry.

Seismic reflection exploration grew out of the seismic refraction exploration method, which was used to find oil associated with salt domes. Ludger Mintrop, a German mine surveyor, devised a mechanical seismograph in 1914 that he successfully used to detect salt domes in Germany. He applied for a German patent in 1919 that was issued in 1926. In 1921 he founded the company Seismos, which was hired to conduct seismic exploration in Texas and Mexico, resulting in the first commercial discovery of oil using the refraction seismic method in 1924. The 1924 discovery of the Orchard salt dome in Texas led to a boom in seismic refraction exploration along the Gulf Coast, but by 1930 the method had led to the discovery of most of the shallow Louann Salt domes, and the refraction seismic method faded.

After WWI, those involved in the development of commercial applications of seismic waves included Mintrop, Reginald Fessenden, John Clarence Karcher, E. A. Eckhardt, William P. Haseman, and Burton McCollum. In 1920, Haseman, Karcher, Eckhardt and McCollum founded the Geological Engineering Company. In June 1921, Karcher, Haseman, I. Perrine and W. C. Kite recorded the first exploration reflection seismograph near Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Early reflection seismology was viewed with skepticism by many in the oil industry. An early advocate of the method commented:

:&quot;As one who personally tried to introduce the method into general consulting practice, the senior writer can definitely recall many times when reflections were not even considered on a par with the divining rod, for at least that device had a background of tradition.&quot;

The Geological Engineering Company folded due to a drop in the price of oil. In 1925, oil prices had rebounded, and Karcher helped to form Geophysical Research Corporation (GRC) as part of the oil company Amerada. In 1930, Karcher left GRC and helped to found Geophysical Service Incorporated (GSI). GSI was one of the most successful seismic contracting companies for over 50 years and was the parent of an even more successful company, Texas Instruments. Early GSI employee Henry Salvatori left that company in 1933 to found another major seismic contractor, Western Geophysical. Many other companies using reflection seismology in hydrocarbon exploration, hydrology, engineering studies, and other applications have been formed since the method was first invented. Major service companies in recent years have included CGG, ION Geophysical, Petroleum Geo-Services, Polarcus, TGS and WesternGeco, but since the oil price crash of 2015, providers of seismic services have continued to struggle financially such as Polarcus, whilst companies that were seismic acquisition industry leaders just ten years ago such as CGG and WesternGeco have now removed themselves from the seismic acquisition environment entirely and restructured to focus upon their existing seismic data libraries, seismic data management and non-seismic related oilfield services.

==Summary of the method==

Seismic waves are mechanical perturbations that travel in the Earth at a speed governed by the acoustic impedance of the medium in which they are travelling. The acoustic (or seismic) impedance, &quot;Z&quot;, is defined by the equation:

:formula_1,

where &quot;v&quot; is the seismic wave velocity and &quot;ρ&quot; (Greek &quot;rho&quot;) is the density of the rock.

When a seismic wave travelling through the Earth encounters an interface between two materials with different acoustic impedances, some of the wave energy will reflect off the interface and some will refract through the interface. At its most basic, the seismic reflection technique consists of generating seismic waves and measuring the time taken for the waves to travel from the source, reflect off an interface and be detected by an array of receivers (as geophones or hydrophones) at the surface. Knowing the travel times from the source to various receivers, and the velocity of the seismic waves, a geophysicist then attempts to reconstruct the pathways of the waves in order to build up an image of the subsurface.

In common with other geophysical methods, reflection seismology may be seen as a type of inverse problem. That is, given a set of data collected by experimentation and the physical laws that apply to the experiment, the experimenter wishes to develop an abstract model of the physical system being studied. In the case of reflection seismology, the experimental data are recorded seismograms, and the desired result is a model of the structure and physical properties of the Earth&#x27;s crust. In common with other types of inverse problems, the results obtained from reflection seismology are usually not unique (more than one model adequately fits the data) and may be sensitive to relatively small errors in data collection, processing, or analysis. For these reasons, great care must be taken when interpreting the results of a reflection seismic survey.

===The reflection experiment===
The general principle of seismic reflection is to send elastic waves (using an energy source such as dynamite explosion or Vibroseis) into the Earth, where each layer within the Earth reflects a portion of the wave&#x27;s energy back and allows the rest to refract through. These reflected energy waves are recorded over a predetermined time period (called the record length) by receivers that detect the motion of the ground in which they are placed. On land, the typical receiver used is a small, portable instrument known as a geophone, which converts ground motion into an analogue electrical signal. In water, hydrophones are used, which convert pressure changes into electrical signals. Each receiver&#x27;s response to a single shot is known as a “trace” and is recorded onto a data storage device, then the shot location is moved along and the process is repeated. Typically, the recorded signals are subjected to significant amounts of signal processing.

===Reflection and transmission at normal incidence===

When a seismic P-wave encounters a boundary between two materials with different acoustic impedances, some of the energy in the wave will be reflected at the boundary, while some of the energy will be transmitted through the boundary. The amplitude of the reflected wave is predicted by multiplying the amplitude of the incident wave by the seismic &quot;reflection coefficient&quot; formula_2, determined by the impedance contrast between the two materials.

For a wave that hits a boundary at normal incidence (head-on), the expression for the reflection coefficient is simply

:formula_3,

where formula_4 and formula_5 are the impedance of the first and second medium, respectively.

Similarly, the amplitude of the incident wave is multiplied by the &quot;transmission coefficient&quot; formula_6 to predict the amplitude of the wave transmitted through the boundary. The formula for the normal-incidence transmission coefficient is

:formula_7.

As the sum of the energies of the reflected and transmitted wave has to be equal to the energy of the incident wave, it is easy to show that

:formula_8.

By observing changes in the strength of reflections, seismologists can infer changes in the seismic impedances. In turn, they use this information to infer changes in the properties of the rocks at the interface, such as density and wave velocity, by means of seismic inversion.

===Reflection and transmission at non-normal incidence===
The situation becomes much more complicated in the case of non-normal incidence, due to mode conversion between P-waves and S-waves, and is described by the Zoeppritz equations. In 1919, Karl Zoeppritz derived 4 equations that determine the amplitudes of reflected and refracted waves at a planar interface for an incident P-wave as a function of the angle of incidence and six independent elastic parameters. These equations have 4 unknowns and can be solved but they do not give an intuitive understanding for how the reflection amplitudes vary with the rock properties involved.

The reflection and transmission coefficients, which govern the amplitude of each reflection, vary with angle of incidence and can be used to obtain information about (among many other things) the fluid content of the rock. Practical use of non-normal incidence phenomena, known as AVO (see amplitude versus offset) has been facilitated by theoretical work to derive workable approximations to the Zoeppritz equations and by advances in computer processing capacity. AVO studies attempt with some success to predict the fluid content (oil, gas, or water) of potential reservoirs, to lower the risk of drilling unproductive wells and to identify new petroleum reservoirs. The 3-term simplification of the Zoeppritz equations that is most commonly used was developed in 1985 and is known as the &quot;Shuey equation&quot;. A further 2-term simplification is known as the &quot;Shuey approximation&quot;, is valid for angles of incidence less than 30 degrees (usually the case in seismic surveys) and is given below:

:formula_9

where formula_10 = reflection coefficient at zero-offset (normal incidence); formula_11 = AVO gradient, describing reflection behaviour at intermediate offsets and formula_12 = angle of incidence. This equation reduces to that of normal incidence at formula_12=0.

===Interpretation of reflections===
The time it takes for a reflection from a particular boundary to arrive at the geophone is called the &quot;travel time&quot;. If the seismic wave velocity in the rock is known, then the travel time may be used to estimate the depth to the reflector. For a simple vertically traveling wave, the travel time formula_14 from the surface to the reflector and back is called the Two-Way Time (TWT) and is given by the formula

:formula_15,
where formula_16 is the depth of the reflector and formula_17 is the wave velocity in the rock.

A series of apparently related reflections on several seismograms is often referred to as a &quot;reflection event&quot;. By correlating reflection events, a seismologist can create an estimated cross-section of the geologic structure that generated the reflections.

===Sources of noise===

In addition to reflections off interfaces within the subsurface, there are a number of other seismic responses detected by receivers and are either unwanted or unneeded:

====Air wave====
The airwave travels directly from the source to the receiver and is an example of coherent noise. It is easily recognizable because it travels at a speed of 330 m/s, the speed of sound in air.

====Ground roll / Rayleigh wave / Scholte wave / Surface wave====
A Rayleigh wave typically propagates along a free surface of a solid, but the elastic constants and density of air are very low compared to those of rocks so the surface of the Earth is approximately a free surface. Low velocity, low frequency and high amplitude Rayleigh waves are frequently present on a seismic record and can obscure signal, degrading overall data quality. They are known within the industry as ‘Ground Roll’ and are an example of coherent noise that can be attenuated with a carefully designed seismic survey. The Scholte wave is similar to
ground roll but occurs at the sea-floor (fluid/solid interface) and it can possibly obscure and mask deep reflections in marine seismic records. 
The velocity of these waves varies with wavelength, so they are said to be dispersive and the shape of the wavetrain varies with distance.

====Refraction / Head wave / Conical wave====
A head wave refracts at an interface, travelling along it, within the lower medium and produces oscillatory motion parallel to the interface. This motion causes a disturbance in the upper medium that is detected on the surface. The same phenomenon is utilised in seismic refraction.

====Multiple reflection====
An event on the seismic record that has incurred more than one reflection is called a &quot;multiple&quot;. Multiples can be either short-path (peg-leg) or long-path, depending upon whether they interfere with primary reflections or not.

Multiples from the bottom of a body of water and the air-water interface are common in marine seismic data, and are suppressed by seismic processing.

====Cultural noise====
Cultural noise includes noise from weather effects, planes, helicopters, electrical pylons, and ships (in the case of marine surveys), all of which can be detected by the receivers.

====Electromagnetic noise====
Particularly important in urban environments (i.e. power lines), it is hardly removable. Some particular sensor as microelectromechanical systems (MEMs) are used to decrease these interference when in such environments.

===2D versus 3D===
The original seismic reflection method involved acquisition along a two-dimensional vertical profile through the crust, now referred to as 2D data. This approach worked well with areas of relatively simple geological structure where dips are low. However, in areas of more complex structure, the 2D technique failed to properly image the subsurface due to out of plane reflections and other artefacts. Spatial aliasing is also an issue with 2D data due to the lack of resolution between the lines. Beginning with initial experiments in the 1960s, the seismic technique explored the possibility of full three-dimensional acquisition and processing. In the late 1970s the first large 3D datasets were acquired and by the 1980s and 1990s this method became widely used.

==Applications==
Reflection seismology is used extensively in a number of fields and its applications can be categorised into three groups, each defined by their depth of investigation:

*Near-surface applications – an application that aims to understand geology at depths of up to approximately 1 km, typically used for engineering and environmental surveys, as well as coal and mineral exploration. A more recently developed application for seismic reflection is for geothermal energy surveys, although the depth of investigation can be up to 2 km deep in this case.
*Hydrocarbon exploration – used by the hydrocarbon industry to provide a high resolution map of acoustic impedance contrasts at depths of up to 10 km within the subsurface. This can be combined with seismic attribute analysis and other exploration geophysics tools and used to help geologists build a geological model of the area of interest.
*Mineral exploration – The traditional approach to near-surface (&lt;300 m) mineral exploration has been to employ geological mapping, geochemical analysis and the use of aerial and ground-based potential field methods, in particular for greenfield exploration, in the recent decades reflection seismic has become a valid method for exploration in hard-rock environments.
*Crustal studies – investigation into the structure and origin of the Earth&#x27;s crust, through to the Moho discontinuity and beyond, at depths of up to 100 km.
A method similar to reflection seismology which uses electromagnetic instead of elastic waves, and has a smaller depth of penetration, is known as Ground-penetrating radar or GPR.

===Hydrocarbon exploration===

Reflection seismology, more commonly referred to as &quot;seismic reflection&quot; or abbreviated to &quot;seismic&quot; within the hydrocarbon industry, is used by petroleum geologists and geophysicists to map and interpret potential petroleum reservoirs. The size and scale of seismic surveys has increased alongside the significant increases in computer power since the late 20th century. This led the seismic industry from laboriously – and therefore rarely – acquiring small 3D surveys in the 1980s to routinely acquiring large-scale high resolution 3D surveys. The goals and basic principles have remained the same, but the methods have slightly changed over the years.

The primary environments for seismic hydrocarbon exploration are land, the transition zone and marine:

&quot;Land&quot; – The land environment covers almost every type of terrain that exists on Earth, each bringing its own logistical problems. Examples of this environment are jungle, desert, arctic tundra, forest, urban settings, mountain regions and savannah.

&quot;Transition Zone (TZ)&quot; – The transition zone is considered to be the area where the land meets the sea, presenting unique challenges because the water is too shallow for large seismic vessels but too deep for the use of traditional methods of acquisition on land. Examples of this environment are river deltas, swamps and marshes, coral reefs, beach tidal areas and the surf zone. Transition zone seismic crews will often work on land, in the transition zone and in the shallow water marine environment on a single project in order to obtain a complete map of the subsurface.
&quot;Marine&quot; – The marine zone is either in shallow water areas (water depths of less than 30 to 40 metres would normally be considered shallow water areas for 3D marine seismic operations) or in the deep water areas normally associated with the seas and oceans (such as the Gulf of Mexico).

==== Seismic data acquisition====

Seismic data acquisition is the first of the three distinct stages of seismic exploration, the other two being seismic data processing and seismic interpretation.

Seismic surveys are typically designed by National oil companies and International oil companies who hire service companies such as CGG, Petroleum Geo-Services and WesternGeco to acquire them. Another company is then hired to process the data, although this can often be the same company that acquired the survey. Finally the finished seismic volume is delivered to the oil company so that it can be geologically interpreted.

====Land survey acquisition====

Land seismic surveys tend to be large entities, requiring hundreds of tons of equipment and employing anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand people, deployed over vast areas for many months. There are a number of options available for a controlled seismic source in a land survey and particularly common choices are Vibroseis and dynamite. Vibroseis is a non-impulsive source that is cheap and efficient but requires flat ground to operate on, making its use more difficult in undeveloped areas. The method comprises one or more heavy, all-terrain vehicles lowering a steel plate onto the ground, which is then vibrated with a specific frequency distribution and amplitude. It produces a low energy density, allowing it to be used in cities and other built-up areas where dynamite would cause significant damage, though the large weight attached to a Vibroseis truck can cause its own environmental damage. Dynamite is an impulsive source that is regarded as the ideal geophysical source due to it producing an almost perfect impulse function but it has obvious environmental drawbacks. For a long time, it was the only seismic source available until weight dropping was introduced around 1954, allowing geophysicists to make a trade-off between image quality and environmental damage. Compared to Vibroseis, dynamite is also operationally inefficient because each source point needs to be drilled and the dynamite placed in the hole.

Unlike in marine seismic surveys, land geometries are not limited to narrow paths of acquisition, meaning that a wide range of offsets and azimuths is usually acquired and the largest challenge is increasing the rate of acquisition. The rate of production is obviously controlled by how fast the source (Vibroseis in this case) can be fired and then move on to the next source location. Attempts have been made to use multiple seismic sources at the same time in order to increase survey efficiency and a successful example of this technique is Independent Simultaneous Sweeping (ISS).

A land seismic survey requires substantial logistical support; in addition to the day-to-day seismic operation itself, there must also be support for the main camp for resupply activities, medical support, camp and equipment maintenance tasks, security, personnel crew changes and waste management. Some operations may also operate smaller &#x27;fly&#x27; camps that are set up remotely where the distance is too far to travel back to the main camp on a daily basis and these will also need logistical support on a frequent basis.

====Marine survey acquisition (Towed Streamer)====




Towed streamer marine seismic surveys are conducted using specialist seismic vessels that tow one or more cables known as streamers just below the surface typically between 5 and 15 metres depending upon the project specification that contain groups of hydrophones (or receiver groups) along their length (see diagram). Modern streamer vessels normally tow multiple streamers astern which can be secured to underwater wings, commonly known as doors or vanes that allow a number of streamers to be towed out wide to the port and starboard side of a vessel. Current streamer towing technology such as seen on the PGS operated Ramform series of vessels built between 2013 and 2017 has pushed the number of streamers up to 24 in total on these vessels. For vessels of this type of capacity, it is not uncommon for a streamer spread across the stern from &#x27;door to door&#x27; to be in excess on one nautical mile. The precise configuration of the streamers on any project in terms of streamer length, streamer separation, hydrophone group length and the offset or distance between the source centre and the receivers will be dependent upon the geological area of interest below the sea floor that the client is trying to get data from.

Streamer vessels also tow high energy sources, principally high pressure air gun arrays that operate at 2000psi that fire together to the create a tuned energy pulse into the seabed from which the reflected energy waves are recorded on the streamer receiver groups. Gun arrays are tuned, that is the frequency response of the resulting air bubble from the array when fired can be changed depending upon the combination and number of guns in a specific array and their individual volumes. Guns can be located individual on an array or can be combined to form clusters. Typically, source arrays have a volume of 2000 cubic inches to 7000 cubic inches, but this will depend upon the specific geology of the survey area.

Marine seismic surveys generate a significant quantity of data due to the size of modern towed streamer vessels and their towing capabilities.

A seismic vessel with 2 sources and towing a single streamer is known as a &quot;Narrow-Azimuth Towed Streamer&quot; (or NAZ or NATS). By the early 2000s, it was accepted that this type of acquisition was useful for initial exploration but inadequate for development and production, in which wells had to be accurately positioned. This led to the development of the &quot;Multi-Azimuth Towed Streamer&quot; (MAZ) which tried to break the limitations of the linear acquisition pattern of a NATS survey by acquiring a combination of NATS surveys at different azimuths (see diagram). This successfully delivered increased illumination of the subsurface and a better signal to noise ratio.

The seismic properties of salt poses an additional problem for marine seismic surveys, it attenuates seismic waves and its structure contains overhangs that are difficult to image. This led to another variation on the NATS survey type, the &quot;wide-azimuth towed streamer&quot; (or WAZ or WATS) and was first tested on the Mad Dog field in 2004. This type of survey involved 1 vessel solely towing a set of 8 streamers and 2 separate vessels towing seismic sources that were located at the start and end of the last receiver line (see diagram). This configuration was &quot;tiled&quot; 4 times, with the receiver vessel moving further away from the source vessels each time and eventually creating the effect of a survey with 4 times the number of streamers. The end result was a seismic dataset with a larger range of wider azimuths, delivering a breakthrough in seismic imaging. These are now the three common types of marine towed streamer seismic surveys.

====Marine survey acquisition (Ocean Bottom Seismic (OBS))====
Marine survey acquisition is not just limited to seismic vessels; it is also possible to lay cables of geophones and hydrophones on the sea bed in a similar way to how cables are used in a land seismic survey, and use a separate source vessel. This method was originally developed out of operational necessity in order to enable seismic surveys to be conducted in areas with obstructions, such as production platforms, without having the compromise the resultant image quality. Ocean bottom cables (OBC) are also extensively used in other areas that a seismic vessel cannot be used, for example in shallow marine (water depth &lt;300m) and transition zone environments, and can be deployed by remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) in deep water when repeatability is valued (see 4D, below). Conventional OBC surveys use dual-component receivers, combining a pressure sensor (hydrophone) and a vertical particle velocity sensor (vertical geophone), but more recent developments have expanded the method to use four-component sensors i.e. a hydrophone and three orthogonal geophones. Four-component sensors have the advantage of being able to also record shear waves, which do not travel through water but can still contain valuable information.

In addition to the operational advantages, OBC also has geophysical advantages over a conventional NATS survey that arise from the increased fold and wider range of azimuths associated with the survey geometry. However, much like a land survey, the wider azimuths and increased fold come at a cost and the ability for large-scale OBC surveys is severely limited.

In 2005, ocean bottom nodes (OBN) – an extension of the OBC method that uses battery-powered cableless receivers placed in deep water – was first trialled over the Atlantis Oil Field in a partnership between BP and Fairfield Geotechnologies. The placement of these nodes can be more flexible than the cables in OBC and they are easier to store and deploy due to their smaller size and lower weight.

====Marine survey acquisition (Ocean Bottom Nodes (OBN))====

The development of node technology came as a direct development from that of ocean bottom cable technology, i.e. that ability to place a hydrophone in direct contact with the seafloor to eliminate the seafloor to hydrophone sea water space that exists with towed streamer technology. The ocean bottom hydrophone concept itself is not new and has been used for many years in scientific research, but its rapid use as a data acquisition methodology in oil and gas exploration is relatively recent.

Nodes are self-contained 4-component units which include a hydrophone and three horizontal and vertical axis orientation sensors. Their physical dimensions vary depending on the design requirement and the manufacturer, but in general nodes tend to weigh in excess of 10 kilograms per unit to counteract buoyancy issues and to lessen the chance of movement on the seabed due to currents or tides.

Nodes are usable in areas where streamer vessels may not be able to safely enter and so for the safe navigation of node vessels and prior to the deployment of nodes, a bathymetry seabed survey is normally conducted of the survey area using side-scan technology to map the seabed topography in detail. This will identify any possible hazards that could impact the safe navigation of node and source vessels and also to identify any issues for node deployment including subsea obstructions, wrecks, oilfield infrastructure or sudden changes in water depths from underwater cliffs, canyons or other locations where nodes may not be stable or not make a good connection to the seabed.

Unlike OBC operations, a node vessel does not connect to a node line, whereas ocean bottom cables need to be physically attached to a recorder vessel to record data in real-time. With nodes, until the nodes are recovered and the data reaped from them (reaping is the industry term used to remove data from a recovered node when it is placed within a computerised system that copies the hard drive data from the node), there is an assumption that the data will be recorded as there is no real-time quality control element to a node&#x27;s operating status as they are self-contained and not connected to any system once they are deployed. The technology is now well-established and very reliable and once a node and its battery system has passed all of its set up criteria there is a high degree of confidence that a node will work as specified. Technical downtime during node projects, i.e. individual node failures during deployment are usually in single figures as a percentage of the total nodes deployed.

Nodes are powered by either rechargeable internal Lithium-ion battery packs or replaceable non-rechargeable batteries - the design and the specification of the node will determine what battery technology is used. The battery life of a node unit is a critical consideration in the design of a node project; this is because once the battery runs out on a node, the data that has been collected is no longer stored on the solid-state hard drive and all data recorded since it was deployed on the sea floor will be lost. Therefore, a node with a 30-day battery life must be deployed, record data, be recovered and reaped within that 30-day period. This also ties in with the number of nodes that are to be deployed as this is closely related to battery life too. If too many nodes are deployed and the OBN crew&#x27;s resources are not sufficient to recover these in time or external factors such as adverse weather limits recovery operations, batteries can expire and data can be lost. Disposable or non-rechargeable batteries can also create a significant waste management issue as batteries must be transported to and from an operation and the drained batteries disposed of by a licensed contractor ashore.

Another important consideration is that of synchronising the timing of individual node clock units with an internal clock drift correction. Any error in synchronising nodes properly before they are deployed can create unusable data. Because node acquisition is often multi-directional and from a number of sources simultaneously across a 24-hour time frame, for accurate data processing it is vital that all of the nodes are working to the same clock time.

The node type and specification will determine the node handling system design and the deployment and recovery modes. At present there are two mainstream approaches; node on a rope and ROV operations.

Node on a rope

This method requires the node to be attached to a steel wire or a high specification rope. Each node will be evenly spaced along the rope which will have special fittings to securely connect the node to the rope, for example every 50 metres depending upon the prospect design. This rope is then laid by a specialist node vessel using an node handling system, usually with dynamic positioning along a pre-defined node line. The nodes are ‘landed’ onto pre-plotted positions with an agreed and acceptable error radius, for example, a node must be placed within a 12.5 metre radius from the navigation pre-plot 
positions. They are often accompanied by pingers, small transponders that can be detected by an underwater acoustic positioning transducer which allows a pinging vessel or the node vessel itself to establish a definite sea floor position for each node on deployment. Depending on the contract, pingers can be located on every node or every third node, for example. Pinging and pinging equipment is the industry shorthand for the use of USBL or Ultra-short baseline acoustic positioning systems which are interfaced with vessel based differential GPS or Differential Global Positioning System navigation equipment.

Node lines are usually recovered by anchor or grapple hook dragging to recover the node line back on board the vessel. Handling systems on node vessels are used to store, deploy and recover nodes and their specific design will depend upon the node design. Small nodes can include a manual handling element whereas larger nodes are automatically handled by robotic systems for moving, storing, recharging and reaping nodes. Node vessels also use systems such as spoolers to manage rope lines and rope bins to store the many kilometres of ropes often carried onboard node on a rope vessels.

Node on a rope is normally used where there is shallow water within the prospect, for example less than 100 metres or a transition zone area close to a beach. For deeper water operations, a dynamic positioning vessel is used to ensure accurate deployment of nodes, but these larger vessels have a limitation as to how far into shore they can safely navigate into; the usual cutoff will be between 15 and 20 metres water depth depending on the vessel and its in-water equipment. Specialist shallow water boats can then be used for deploying and recovering nodes in water depths as shallow as 1 to 3 metres. These shallow water nodes can then be used to tie-in with geophones on the shore to provide a consistent seismic line transition from water to land.

There are some issues with this approach which make them vulnerable to damage or loss on a project and these all must be risk assessed and mitigated. Since nodes connected together on a rope sit on the sea floor unattended: they can be moved due to strong currents, the ropes can snag on seabed obstructions, they can be dragged by third party vessel anchors and caught by trawling fishing vessels. The threat of these types of potential hazards to this equipment should normally be identified and assessed during the project planning phase, especially in oilfield locations where well heads, pipelines and other subsea structures exist and where any contact with these must be avoided, normally achieved by adopting exclusion zones. Since it is possible for node lines to be moved after deployment, the issue of node position on recovery is critical and therefore positioning during both deployment and recovery is a standard navigation quality control check. In some case, node lines may need to be recovered and re-laid if the nodes have moved outside of the contract specifications.

ROV deployment

This method utilises ROV (remotely operated underwater vehicle) technology to handle and place nodes at their pre-plotted positions. This type of deployment and recovery method uses a basket full of nodes which is lowered into the water. An ROV will connect with the compatible node basket and remove individual nodes from a tray in a pre-defined order. Each node will be placed on its allocated pre-plot position. On recovery, the process works in reverse; the node to be recovered is picked up by the ROV, placed into the node basket tray until the basket is full when it is lifted back to the surface. The basket is recovered onto the node vessel, the nodes are removed from the basket and reaped.

ROV operations are normally used for deep water node projects, often in water depths to 3000 metres in the open ocean. However, there are some issues with ROV operations that need to be considered. ROV operations tend to be complex, especially deep water ROV operations and so the periodic maintenance demands may impact upon production. Umbilical&#x27;s and other high technology spares for ROV&#x27;s can be extremely expensive and repairs to ROVs which require onshore or third-party specialist support will stop a node project. Due to extreme water depths, the node deployment and recovery production rate will be much lower due to the time for node basket transit from surface to seafloor and there will almost certainly be weather or sea condition limitation for ROV operations in open ocean areas. The logistics for supporting operations far from shore can also be problematic for regular resupply, bunkering and crew change activities.

==== Time lapse acquisition (4D) ====
Time lapse or 4D surveys are 3D seismic surveys repeated after a period of time, the 4D term refers to the fourth dimension which in this case is time. Time lapse surveys are acquired in order to observe reservoir changes during production and identify areas where there are barriers to flow that may not be detectable in conventional seismic. Time lapse surveys consist of a baseline survey and a monitor or repeat survey, acquired after the field has been in production. Most of these surveys have been repeated NATS surveys as they are cheaper to acquire and most fields historically already had a NATS baseline survey. Some of these surveys are collected using ocean-bottom cables because the cables can be accurately placed in their previous location after being removed. Better repetition of the exact source and receiver location leads to improved repeatability and better signal to noise ratios. A number of 4D surveys have also been set up over fields in which ocean bottom cables have been purchased and permanently deployed. This method can be known as life of field seismic (LoFS) or permanent reservoir monitoring (PRM).

4D seismic surveys using towed streamer technology can be very challenging as the aim of a 4D survey it to repeat the original or baseline survey as accurately as possible. Weather, tides, current and even the time of year can have a significant impact upon how accurately such a survey can achieve that repeatability goal.

OBN has proven to be another very good way to accurately repeat a seismic acquisition. The world&#x27;s first 4D survey using nodes was acquired over the Atlantis Oil Field in 2009, with the nodes being placed by a ROV in a water depth of 1300–2200 metres to within a few metres of where they were previously placed in 2005.

====Seismic data processing====

There are three main processes in seismic data processing: deconvolution, common-midpoint (CMP) stacking and migration.

&quot;Deconvolution&quot; is a process that tries to extract the reflectivity series of the Earth, under the assumption that a seismic trace is just the reflectivity series of the Earth convolved with distorting filters. This process improves temporal resolution by collapsing the seismic wavelet, but it is nonunique unless further information is available such as well logs, or further assumptions are made. &quot;Deconvolution&quot; operations can be cascaded, with each individual deconvolution designed to remove a particular type of distortion.

&quot;CMP stacking&quot; is a robust process that uses the fact that a particular location in the subsurface will have been sampled numerous times and at different offsets. This allows a geophysicist to construct a group of traces with a range of offsets that all sample the same subsurface location, known as a &quot;Common Midpoint Gather&quot;. The average amplitude is then calculated along a time sample, resulting in significantly lowering the random noise but also losing all valuable information about the relationship between seismic amplitude and offset. Less significant processes that are applied shortly before the &quot;CMP stack&quot; are &quot;Normal moveout correction&quot; and &quot;statics correction&quot;. Unlike marine seismic data, land seismic data has to be corrected for the elevation differences between the shot and receiver locations. This correction is in the form of a vertical time shift to a flat datum and is known as a &quot;statics correction&quot;, but will need further correcting later in the processing sequence because the velocity of the near-surface is not accurately known. This further correction is known as a &quot;residual statics correction.&quot;

&quot;Seismic migration&quot; is the process by which seismic events are geometrically re-located in either space or time to the location the event occurred in the subsurface rather than the location that it was recorded at the surface, thereby creating a more accurate image of the subsurface.

====Seismic interpretation====
The goal of seismic interpretation is to obtain a coherent geological story from the map of processed seismic reflections. At its most simple level, seismic interpretation involves tracing and correlating along continuous reflectors throughout the 2D or 3D dataset and using these as the basis for the geological interpretation. The aim of this is to produce structural maps that reflect the spatial variation in depth of certain geological layers. Using these maps hydrocarbon traps can be identified and models of the subsurface can be created that allow volume calculations to be made. However, a seismic dataset rarely gives a picture clear enough to do this. This is mainly because of the vertical and horizontal seismic resolution but often noise and processing difficulties also result in a lower quality picture. Due to this, there is always a degree of uncertainty in a seismic interpretation and a particular dataset could have more than one solution that fits the data. In such a case, more data will be needed to constrain the solution, for example in the form of further seismic acquisition, borehole logging or gravity and magnetic survey data. Similarly to the mentality of a seismic processor, a seismic interpreter is generally encouraged to be optimistic in order encourage further work rather than the abandonment of the survey area. Seismic interpretation is completed by both geologists and geophysicists, with most seismic interpreters having an understanding of both fields.

In hydrocarbon exploration, the features that the interpreter is particularly trying to delineate are the parts that make up a petroleum reservoir – the source rock, the reservoir rock, the seal and trap.

====Seismic attribute analysis====

Seismic attribute analysis involves extracting or deriving a quantity from seismic data that can be analysed in order to enhance information that might be more subtle in a traditional seismic image, leading to a better geological or geophysical interpretation of the data. Examples of attributes that can be analysed include mean amplitude, which can lead to the delineation of bright spots and dim spots, coherency and amplitude versus offset. Attributes that can show the presence of hydrocarbons are called direct hydrocarbon indicators.

===Crustal studies===
The use of reflection seismology in studies of tectonics and the Earth&#x27;s crust was pioneered in the 1970s by groups such as the Consortium for Continental Reflection Profiling (COCORP), who inspired deep seismic exploration in other countries such as BIRPS in Great Britain and ECORS in France. The British Institutions Reflection Profiling Syndicate (BIRPS) was started up as a result of oil hydrocarbon exploration in the North Sea. It became clear that there was a lack of understanding of the tectonic processes that had formed the geological structures and sedimentary basins which were being explored. The effort produced some significant results and showed that it is possible to profile features such as thrust faults that penetrate through the crust to the upper mantle with marine seismic surveys.

==Environmental impact==
As with all human activities, seismic reflection surveys have some impact on the Earth&#x27;s natural environment and both the hydrocarbon industry and environmental groups partake in research to investigate these effects.

===Land===
On land, conducting a seismic survey may require the building of roads, for transporting equipment and personnel, and vegetation may need to be cleared for the deployment of equipment. If the survey is in a relatively undeveloped area, significant habitat disturbance may occur and many governments require seismic companies to follow strict rules regarding destruction of the environment; for example, the use of dynamite as a seismic source may be disallowed. Seismic processing techniques allow for seismic lines to deviate around natural obstacles, or use pre-existing non-straight tracks and trails. With careful planning, this can greatly reduce the environmental impact of a land seismic survey. The more recent use of inertial navigation instruments for land survey instead of theodolites decreased the impact of seismic by allowing the winding of survey lines between trees.

The potential impact of any seismic survey on land needs to be assessed at the planning stage and managed effectively. Well regulated environments would generally require Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) or Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) reports prior to any work starting. Project planning also needs to recognise that once a project has completed, what impact if any, will be left behind. It is the contractors and clients responsibility to manage the remediation plan as per the contract and as per the laws where the project has been conducted.

Depending upon the size of a project, land seismic operations can have a significant local impact and a sizeable physical footprint, especially where storage facilities, camp utilities, waste management facilities (including black and grey water management), general and seismic vehicle parking areas, workshops and maintenance facilities and living accommodation are required. Contact with local people can cause potential disruptions to their normal lives such as increased noise, 24-hour operations and increased traffic and these have to be assessed and mitigated.

Archeological considerations are also important and project planning must accommodate legal, cultural and social requirements that will have to be considered. Specialist techniques can be used to assessed safe working distances from buildings and archeological structures to minimise their impact and prevent damage.

===Marine===
The main environmental concern for marine seismic surveys is the potential for noise associated with the high-energy seismic source to disturb or injure animal life, especially cetaceans such as whales, porpoises, and dolphins, as these mammals use sound as their primary method of communication with one another. High-level and long-duration sound can cause physical damage, such as hearing loss, whereas lower-level noise can cause temporary threshold shifts in hearing, obscuring sounds that are vital to marine life, or behavioural disturbance.

A study has shown that migrating humpback whales will leave a minimum 3 km gap between themselves and an operating seismic vessel, with resting humpback whale pods with cows exhibiting increased sensitivity and leaving an increased gap of 7–12 km. Conversely, the study found that male humpback whales were attracted to a single operating airgun as they were believed to have confused the low-frequency sound with that of whale breaching behaviour. In addition to whales, sea turtles, fish and squid all showed alarm and avoidance behaviour in the presence of an approaching seismic source. It is difficult to compare reports on the effects of seismic survey noise on marine life because methods and units are often inadequately documented.

The gray whale will avoid its regular migratory and feeding grounds by &gt;30 km in areas of seismic testing. Similarly the breathing of gray whales was shown to be more rapid, indicating discomfort and panic in the whale. It is circumstantial evidence such as this that has led researchers to believe that avoidance and panic might be responsible for increased whale beachings although research is ongoing into these questions.

Even so, airguns are shut down only when cetaceans are seen at very close range, usually under 1 km

Offering another point of view, a joint paper from the International Association of Geophysical Contractors (IAGC) and the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP) argue that the noise created by marine seismic surveys is comparable to natural sources of seismic noise, stating:

The UK government organisation, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (more commonly known as JNCC) is &quot;...the public body that advises the UK Government and devolved administrations on UK-wide and international nature conservation.&quot; has had a long term vested interest in the impact of geophysical or seismic surveys on the marine environment for many years. Even back in the 1990s, it was understood at a government level that the impact of the sound energy produced by seismic surveys needed to be investigated and monitored. JNCC guidelines have been and continue to be one of the references used internationally as a possible baseline standard for surveys in seismic contracts world-wide, such as the &#x27;JNCC guidelines for minimising the risk of injury to marine mammals from geophysical surveys (seismic survey guidelines)&#x27;, 2017.

A complicating factor in the discussion of seismic sound energy as a disruptive factor to marine mammals is that of the size and scale of seismic surveys as they are conducted into the 21st century. Historically, seismic surveys tended to have a duration of weeks or months and to be localised, but with OBN technology, surveys can cover thousands of square kilometres of ocean and can continue for years, all of the time putting sound energy into the ocean 24 hours a day from multiple energy sources. One current example of this is the 85,000 square kilometre mega seismic survey contract signed by the Abu Dhabi national oil company ADNOC in 2018 with an estimated duration into 2024 across a range of deep-water areas, coastal areas, islands and shallow water locations. It may be very difficult to assess the long-term impact of these huge operations on marine life.

In 2017, IOGP recommended that, to avoid disturbance whilst surveying:

* Protective measures are employed to address site-specific environmental conditions of each operation to ensure that sound exposure and vessel traffic do not harm marine mammals.
* Surveys planned to avoid known sensitive areas and time periods, such as breeding and feeding areas. 
* Exclusion zones are typically established around the seismic source to further protect marine fauna from any potentially detrimental effects of sound. The exclusion zone is typically a circle with a radius of at least 500 meters around the sound source. 
* Trained observers and listening devices are used to visually and acoustically monitor that zone for marine mammals and other protected species before any sound-producing operations begin. These observers help ensure adherence to the protective practices during operations and their detailed reports provide information on the biodiversity of the survey area to the local governments.
* Sound production typically begins with a “soft-start” or “ramp-up” that involves a gradual increase of the sound level from the air gun source from a very low level to full operational levels at the beginning of the seismic lines – usually over 20 to 40 minutes. This soft-start procedure is intended to allow time for any animal that may be close to the sound source to move away as the sound grows louder.

As second factor is the regulatory environment where the seismic survey is taking place. In highly regulated locations such as the North Sea or the Gulf of Mexico, the legal requirements will be clearly stated at the contract level and both contractor and client will comply with the regulations as the consequences of non-compliance can be severe such as substantial fines or withdrawal of permits for exploration blocks. However, there are some countries which have a varied and rich marine biome but where the environmental laws are weak and where a regulator is ineffective or even non-existent. This situation, where the regulatory framework is not robust can severely compromise any attempts at protecting marine environments: this is frequently found where state-owned oil and gas companies are dominant in a country and where the regulator is also a state-owned and operated entity and therefore it is not considered to be truly independent.

<doc id="676446" wikidata="Q143867" url="?curid=676446" title="Siegfried Wagner">
<text>Siegfried Helferich Richard Wagner (6 June 18694 August 1930) was a German composer and conductor, the son of Richard Wagner. He was an opera composer and the artistic director of the Bayreuth Festival from 1908 to 1930.

==Life==
Siegfried Wagner was born in 1869 to Richard Wagner and his future wife Cosima (née Liszt), at Tribschen on Lake Lucerne in Switzerland. Through his mother, he was a grandson of Franz Liszt, from whom he received some instruction in harmony.
Some youthful compositions date from about 1882. After he completed his secondary education in 1889, he studied with Wagner&#x27;s assistant Engelbert Humperdinck, but was more strongly drawn to a career as an architect and studied architecture in Berlin and Karlsruhe.

In 1892 he undertook a trip to Asia with a friend, the English composer Clement Harris. During the voyage he decided to abandon architecture and commit himself to music. Reputedly, it was also Harris who first aroused his homoerotic impulses. While on board, he sketched his first official work, the symphonic poem &quot;Sehnsucht&quot;, inspired by the poem of the same name by Friedrich Schiller. This piece was not completed until just before the concert in which Wagner conducted it in London on 6 June 1895. Though his works are numerous, none entered the standard repertory.

He made his conducting debut as an assistant conductor at Bayreuth in 1894; in 1896 he became associate conductor, sharing responsibility for conducting the &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; with Felix Mottl and Hans Richter, who had conducted its premiere 20 years earlier. In 1908 he took over as artistic director of the Bayreuth Festival in succession to his mother, Cosima.

Wagner was bisexual. For years, his mother urged him to marry and provide the Wagner dynasty with heirs, but he fought off her increasingly desperate urgings.

Around 1913, pressure on him increased due to the Harden–Eulenburg affair (1907–1909), in which the journalist Maximilian Harden accused several public figures, most notably Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, a friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II, of homosexuality. In this climate, the family found it suitable to arrange a marriage with a 17-year-old Englishwoman, Winifred Klindworth, and at the Bayreuth Festival of 1914 she was introduced to the then-45-year-old Wagner. The two married on 22 September 1915.

The couple had four children:
# Wieland (1917–1966)
# Friedelind (1918–1991)
# Wolfgang (1919–2010)
# Verena (1920–2019)

Though the marriage provided for the dynastic succession, the hope that it would also bring an end to his homosexual encounters and the associated costly scandals was disappointed, as Wagner remained sexually active with other men.

, one of Siegfried&#x27;s biographers, asserted that Siegfried had sired an illegitimate son, Walter Aign (1901–1977); several recent authors, such as Frederic Spotts and Brigitte Hamann, have taken it up.

Wagner died in Bayreuth in 1930 aged 61, having outlived his mother by only four months. Since his two sons were still only adolescents, he was succeeded at the helm of the Bayreuth Festival by his widow Winifred.

<text>Morvidus (&quot;Welsh:&quot; &quot;Morydd map Daned&quot;) was a legendary king of the Britons from 341 to 336 BCE, as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He reigned from 355BC. He was the illegitimate son of Danius by his mistress Tangustela.

==Life==
Geoffrey portrays him as being an ill-tempered yet kind ruler most of the time. Most of the time he gave out gifts handsomely. During his reign, the king of the Morini invaded Northumberland and laid waste to the countryside. Morvidus met the king of Moriani in battle and defeated the invaders. After the battle, he had every captive soldier brought before him and personally killed each one, feeding his lust for blood. When he became tired, he skinned and burned the remaining soldiers.

He fought and killed a giant using an uprooted tree stripped of bark and branches. For this reason, he is associated with the symbol of a ragged staff, which appears in the crest of the Earl of Warwick who are believed to be descended from Morvidus. 

Later in his reign, a dragon or monster appeared from the Irish Sea and began devouring the inhabitants of the western shores. In an attempt to stop this, Morvidus met the beast in single-combat and used every weapon he could against her, but to no avail. The monster lunged at Morvidus and consumed him. Morvidus had five sons: Gorbonianus, Archgallo, Elidurus, Ingenius, and Peredurus, all of which became kings of the Britons. Of these five sons, Gorbonianus, the eldest, was his direct successor.

<doc id="676468" wikidata="Q26537" url="?curid=676468" title="Common iora">
<text>The common iora (Aegithina tiphia) is a small passerine bird found across the tropical Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, with populations showing plumage variations, some of which are designated as subspecies. A species found in scrub and forest, it is easily detected from its loud whistles and the bright colours. During the breeding season, males display by fluffing up their feathers and spiral in the air appearing like a green, black, yellow, and white ball.

==Taxonomy==
In 1747 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the common iora in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Green Indian Fly-Catcher&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen that had been sent from Bengal to the silk-pattern designer and naturalist Joseph Dandridge in London. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the common iora in the genus &quot;Motacilla&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Motacilla tiphia&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The common iora is now placed in the genus &quot;Aegithina&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot. The genus name &quot;Aegithina&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;aigithos&quot; or &quot;aiginthos&quot;, a mythical bird mentioned by Aristotle and other classical authors. The etymology of specific epithet &quot;tiphia&quot; is uncertain. It may be from the Ancient Greek &quot;tuphē&quot;, &quot;tiara&quot;, from Tiphys who in Greek mythology was the helmsman of the Argonauts.

Eleven subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. t. multicolor&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – southwest India and Sri Lanka
* &quot;A. t. deignani&quot; Hall, BP, 1957 – south, east India and north, central Myanmar
* &quot;A. t. humei&quot; Baker, ECS, 1922 – central peninsular India
* &quot;A. t. tiphia&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – north India to west Myanmar
* &quot;A. t. septentrionalis&quot; Koelz, 1939 – northwest Himalayas
* &quot;A. t. philipi&quot; Oustalet, 1886 – south-central China, east Myanmar, north Thailand and north, central Indochina
* &quot;A. t. cambodiana&quot; Hall, BP, 1957 – southeast Thailand, Cambodia and south Vietnam
* &quot;A. t. horizoptera&quot; Oberholser, 1912 – southeast Myanmar and southwest Thailand, Malay Peninsula, Sumatra and nearby islands
* &quot;A. t. scapularis&quot; (Horsfield, 1821) – Java and Bali
* &quot;A. t. viridis&quot; (Bonaparte, 1850) – central, south Borneo
* &quot;A. t. aequanimis&quot; Bangs, 1922 – north Borneo and west Philippines

==Description==
Ioras have a pointed and notched beak with a culmen that is straight. The common iora is sexually dimorphic, males in the breeding season have a black cap and back adding to a black wing and tail at all seasons. Females have greenish wings and an olive tail. The undersides of both are yellow and the two white bars on the wings of the male are particularly prominent in their breeding plumage. The males in breeding plumage have a very variable distribution of the black on the upperparts and can be confused with Marshall&#x27;s iora, however, the latter always has white tips to the tail. The nominate subspecies is found along the Himalayas and males of this population are very similar to females or have only a small amount of black on the crown. In northwestern India, &quot;septentrionalis&quot; is brighter yellow than others and in the northern plains of India &quot;humei&quot; males in breeding plumage have a black cap and olive on the upper mantle. In southwestern India and Sri Lanka &quot;multicolor&quot; has the breeding males with a jet black cap and mantle. The forms in the rest of southern India are intermediate between &quot;multicolor&quot; and &quot;humei&quot; with more grey-green on the rump (formerly considered as &quot;deignani&quot; but now used for the Burmese population).

Several other populations across Southeast Asia are designated as subspecies including &quot;philipi&quot; of southern China and northern Thailand/Laos, &quot;deignani&quot; of Myanmar, &quot;horizoptera&quot; of southern Myanmar and the island chain of Sumatra, &quot;cambodiana&quot; of Cambodia, &quot;aeqanimis&quot; of Palawan and northern Borneo, &quot;viridis&quot; of Borneo and &quot;scapularis&quot; of Java and Bali.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Ioras forage in trees in small groups, gleaning among the branches for insects. They sometimes join mixed species feeding flocks. The call is a mixture of &quot;churrs&quot;, chattering and whistles, and the song is a trilled &quot;wheeeee-tee&quot;. They may sometimes imitate the calls of other birds such as drongos.

During the breeding season, mainly after the monsoons, the male performs an acrobatic courtship display, darting up into the air fluffing up all his feathers, especially those on the pale green rump, then spiralling down to the original perch. Once he lands, he spreads his tail and droops his wings. Two to four greenish white eggs are laid in a small and compact cup-shaped nest made out of grass and bound with cobwebs and placed in the fork of a tree. Both male and female incubate and eggs hatch after about 14 days. Nests predators include snakes, lizards, crow-pheasant and crows. Nests may also be brood-parasitized by the banded bay cuckoo.

Ioras moult twice in a year and the plumage variation makes them somewhat complicated for plumage based separation of the populations.

A species of &quot;Haemoproteus&quot;, &quot;H. aethiginae&quot;, was described from a specimen of the common iora from Goa.

<text>Jesse Clyde &quot;J. C.&quot; Nichols (August 23, 1880 - February 16, 1950) was an American urban planner and developer of commercial and residential real estate in Kansas City, Missouri. 

Born in Olathe, Kansas, and a student at the University of Kansas and Harvard University, his most notable developments are the Country Club District and Country Club Plaza in Kansas City, which influenced suburban developments in other parts of the United States. He served leadership roles in local and national real estate organizations. Through these organizations, his ideas about real estate and planning helped to shape methods for racist and anti-Semitic restrictive covenants and zoning. His legacy has come under increasing scrutiny for these covenants, which prohibited Blacks, Jews, and other minorities from living in these neighborhoods.

==Early life==
Jesse Clyde Nichols was born in 1880, a son of farmers living near Olathe, Kansas. He worked various jobs while attending high school, and worked for a year after graduation selling wholesale meat. 
While he matriculated at the University of Kansas, he managed the college football team, reported for a newspaper, and served as class president. Graduating at the top of his class with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1902, he accepted a one-year scholarship at Harvard University, and earned a second Bachelor of Arts degree there in 1903. Nichols returned to Kansas City and joined some college friends to establish Reed, Nichols &amp; Company, operating as real estate developers. In 1905, he married Jessie Miller, a woman from Olathe, Kansas.

==Subdivision development==
Nichols called his method for establishing residential subdivisions &quot;planning for permanence&quot;, for his objective was to &quot;develop whole residential neighborhoods that would attract an element of people who desired a better way of life, a nicer place to live and would be willing to work in order to keep it better&quot;. His philosophy about subdivision planning greatly influenced other developments in the United States, including the Beverly Hills and Westwood neighborhoods of Los Angeles, Highland Park neighborhood of Dallas, and the River Oaks neighborhood in Houston, Texas.

Nichols advocated preservation of trees and natural contours, while proscribing gridiron street networks. His Country Club District in Kansas City placed many restrictions on the use of property within the subdivision, which Nichols believed made the lots more valuable to potential homeowners. His advertisements promoted permanence. All homeowners were required to belong to the Country Club District&#x27;s homeowners association, which monitored how well homeowners maintained their lawns, but also provided services like garbage collection and street cleaning. Builders were required to observe large minimum lot sizes and large setbacks from the street. Nichols also imposed racially based covenants on all properties in the Country Club District.

The Country Club District, Nichols&#x27;s master-planned community in Kansas City, Missouri, inspired River Oaks in Houston, Texas. Will Hogg, his brother Mike, and Hugh Potter visited the area and sought the advice of Nichols while they were planning River Oaks. Nichols had a short list of exemplary communities, and urged Potter to visit them. These included Forest Hill Gardens in Queens, New York; Palos Verdes Estates in Los Angeles County; Roland Park in Baltimore, Maryland; and Shaker Heights in Cleveland, Ohio. Potter eventually was appointed President of the River Oaks Corporation, and continued to seek the advice of Nichols during his tenure.

==Innovations and leadership==
Nichols originated the percentage lease, where rents are based on tenants&#x27; gross receipts. The percentage lease is now a standard practice in commercial leasing across the United States. Modern outdoor shopping centers, now common in the United States, share a common ancestor in the Country Club Plaza, which opened in Kansas City in 1923. The Urban Land Institute&#x27;s J. C. Nichols Prize for Visionaries in Urban Development is named in his honor.

Nichols was a prominent civic booster in Kansas City, being involved in the creation of the Liberty Memorial, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, MRIGlobal, as well as the development of Kansas City University, now the University of Missouri-Kansas City.

Nichols served in leadership positions of local and national real estate and planning organizations. He was a member of the General Committee of the National Conference on City Planning. He headed the Kansas City Real Estate Board and the National Conference of Subdividers. He was a founder of the Urban Land Institute and chaired its Community Builders’ Council . He chaired the Home Builders and Subdividers Division of the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB), chaired NAREB&#x27;s War Service Board, and served as NAREB director.

===Racist restrictions===
J.C. Nichols relied on restrictive covenants to control the uses of the lands in the neighborhoods he developed. Most of the covenants restricted the lands to residential uses, and contained other features such as setback and free space requirements. However, homes in the Country Club District were restricted with covenants that prohibited Blacks and Jews from owning or occupying the homes.; and likewise in his Johnson County, Kansas developments. Nichols did not invent the practice, but he used it to effectively bar ethnic minorities from living in his properties during the first half of the century. His restrictive covenant model was later adopted by the federal government to help implement similar policies in other regions of the United States. Ultimately, the 1948 Supreme Court decision &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; made such covenants unenforceable. Nevertheless, language referencing these covenants remained on the multitude of deed documents for decades after the Supreme Court decision because the relative difficulty of revising them one by one could be used covertly to continue existence of the covenants. The deed restrictions in most neighborhoods renew automatically every twenty to twenty-five years unless a majority of the homeowners agree to change them with notarized votes, about which fact publicity is assiduously avoided. In 2005, Missouri passed a law allowing (but not requiring) the governing bodies of homeowner&#x27;s associations to delete restrictive covenants from deed restrictions without a vote of the members. The Country Club District is predominantly white, and it is among the wealthiest, most sought-after neighborhoods in the United States.

==Legacy==
Nichols&#x27;s real estate policies created a racial and economic divide to split Kansas City in half along Troost Avenue for the indefinite future. This eventually crashed the home values on the east side where Blacks and Jews were allowed. When nationwide racial integration laws came in the 1960s, this total divide thwarted their implementation by Kansas City&#x27;s public education system, and ensured that KCPS&#x27;s racial population will remain mostly non-white.

In mass resentment of this legacy, intensified in 2020 by the George Floyd protests, Kansas City removed his name from the historic fountain and road in front of Country Club Plaza.

In 1970, members of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) were charged with pipe bombing places in Kansas City, including the home of his son Miller Nichols, then president of the J.C. Nichols company. Three SDS members were convicted.

==Death==
Nichols died of cancer on February 16, 1950, at his home at 1214 West 55th Street. He was buried at Forest Hill Calvary Cemetery in Kansas City. His home is on Ward Parkway in Kansas City.

<text>Camilla Maria Henemark (born 23 October 1964), also known as La Camilla, is a Swedish singer, actress, political spokesperson, and former fashion model.

==Biography==
Henemark was born in Stockholm, to a Nigerian father and a Swedish mother. She started her modelling career in her teens and later had her own modeling agency. Henemark started her career in music in 1985 by joining Alexander Bard in his Barbie project as Katanga. That project morphed into the group Army of Lovers, and soon Henemark, using the stage name &quot;La Camilla&quot;, became the face of the group. After two albums (and at least one public fight) with the group, she left and began a solo career. She released several singles that failed to achieve commercial success, and recorded at least one album that was never released (called &quot;Temper&quot;). Henemark then rejoined Army of Lovers in 1995 for their &quot;Les Greatest Hits&quot; album, in 2000 for their &quot;Le Grand Docu-Soap&quot; and in 2013 reunion album &quot;Big Battle of Egos&quot;, working with them on some of their most recent recordings until being fired and replaced by another former female member, Dominika Peczynski.

Besides music, Henemark has had an active career in TV and movies, and is an active supporter of the Swedish Social Democratic Party. She is currently single but was married to film director Anders Skog, and had a long-term relationship with pop star and music video director Stakka Bo (Johan Renck). She likes ice hockey and soccer, and is known for her liberal views on sex, gay rights, and life.

On 3 November 2010 the Swedish newspaper &quot;Aftonbladet&quot; published excerpts from a book about the Swedish King Carl XVI Gustaf, &quot;Den motvillige monarken&quot; (&quot;The Reluctant Monarch&quot;), claiming that he had a year-long love affair with Henemark in the late 1990s.

She has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Asperger syndrome.
