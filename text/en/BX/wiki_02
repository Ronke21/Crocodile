<text>The Adelaide Oval is a stadium in Adelaide in the state of South Australia. It is located in the parklands. The venue is predominantly used for cricket and Australian rules football, but has also played host to rugby league, rugby union, soccer, and tennis, as well as regularly being used to hold concerts.

Established in 1871, the structures and grounds underwent significant redevelopment between 2012 and 2014. It has three grandstands: Riverbank Stand, Eastern Stand, and Western Stand, and is known for its heritage-listed scoreboard, which stands alongside a new digital scoreboard. Australia&#x27;s first stadium hotel, named the Oval Hotel, opened in 2024.

Adelaide Oval has been headquarters to the South Australian Cricket Association since 1871 and South Australian National Football League (SANFL) since 2014, and is managed by the Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority.

Adelaide Oval has hosted the AFLW Grand Final three times since 2019. Its record crowd for cricket was 55,317 for the Second Ashes Test on 2 December 2017 and its record crowd for an Australian rules football match was 62,543 at the 1965 SANFL Grand Final between and Sturt.In 2017, a concert by Adele attracted a record audience of 70,000. 
== History ==
===19th century===
After the formation of the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA) on 31 May 1871, a later meeting recommended a central location for the cricket ground. After an act of parliament allowed a section of the Adelaide Park Lands between North Adelaide and the River Torrens to be leased by the association, the present grounds were leased in 1872 to the first trustees, Justice Gwynne, the Henry Ayers, and Edwin Thomas Smith.

In 1882, a grandstand, possibly designed by Wright &amp; Reed Architects, and later renamed the George Giffen Stand, was opened to the public. In 1884, the first Test match was played at the grounds, for which the mound was built and Moreton Bay fig trees were planted.

In 1885, the &quot;Grand Corroboree&quot;, a corroboree performed by around 100 Aboriginal men and women from Point MacLeay mission and Yorke Peninsula, was attended by around 20,000 spectators (around a sixth of Adelaide&#x27;s population).

During 1888, a switchback rollercoaster was constructed and was adjacent to Adelaide Oval, where the present Riverbank Stand resides.

In 1889 the original grandstand was expanded to include a dining saloon and &quot;ladies retiring
rooms&quot;, and a new stand, designed by English and Soward, was built adjacent to it.

===20th century===
Ahead of a cycling event held on 24 March 1900, SACA undertook some major renovation of the grounds in order to accommodate a cycling track around the oval. Thousands of loads of earth were carted from the Torrens to create the necessary slope to the track, and a picket fence was built around the Oval&#x27;s playing surface. A newspaper commenter wrote at the time: &quot;The removal of the soil and the sloping of the banks of the lake [the Torrens] have greatly improved both its width and its appearance, while the banking up of the oval has rendered it impossible for anyone to see in from outside, for the mound is continued beyond the inner fence so as to form a natural grandstand for the spectators&quot;.

In 1911, the Adelaide Oval scoreboard, designed by architect F. Kenneth Milne, began service.

Between 1923 and 1929 substantial modifications and additions were built at the grounds, to designs by SACA architect Charles Walter Rutt. These included the John Creswell Stand (built 1923) and the entrance gates, and the western stands were integrated under one roof. At this time, the other stands were named Sir Edwin Smith Stand (built 1889), George Giffen Stand (built 1882) and Mostyn Evan Stand (built 1919-26).

On 25 August 1973, during an SANFL game between Norwood and North Adelaide, two young children, Joanne Ratcliffe (born 1962) and Kirste Gordon (born 1968), went missing, presumably abducted, in a crime sometimes referred to as the Adelaide Oval abductions.

On 20 January 1990, the Sir Donald Bradman Stand was opened, after being built to replace the John Creswell stand.

In 1997, lights were constructed at the ground allowing sport to be held at night. This was the subject of a lengthy dispute with the Adelaide City Council relating to the parklands area. The first towers erected were designed to retract into the ground; however one collapsed and they were replaced with permanent towers.

===21st century===
In 2003, two grandstands, named the Chappell Stands, after the South Australian cricketing brothers Ian Chappell, Greg Chappell, and Trevor Chappell, were completed.

Temporary stands were constructed for the 2006 Ashes Series to cope with demand. In August 2008 SACA announced that it had approved plans to redevelop the ground, involving expanding its capacity to 40,000. Development plans showed a reconfiguration of the playing surface and a remodelled Western stand. The redevelopment would make the ground a viable option for hosting Australian Football League games as well as international soccer and rugby. The state and federal Governments each pledged $25m to the project, leaving the SACA to raise at least $45m. The SACA planned for the new stand to be ready in time for the 2010–11 Ashes series. The South Australian government announced it would commit funding to redevelop Adelaide Oval into a multi-purpose sports facility that would bring AFL football to central Adelaide. Announcing an agreement negotiated with SACA, SANFL and the AFL, the Rann Labor government committed $450 million to the project.

====2010: new Western Stand====

The three original western stands were demolished (George Giffen stand (1882), Sir Edwin Smith stand (1922), Mostyn Evan stand (1920s)) were torn down in June 2009 and a single Western Stand was developed in its place ahead of the 2010–11 Ashes series.

The Adelaide Oval Stadium Management Authority (AOSMA), a joint venture of SACA and the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), was registered as a company on 23 December 2009 following the re-announcement of the plan. In 2010 AOSMA had eight directors, four associated with SACA (Ian McLachlan, chair; John Harnden; Creagh O&#x27;Connor; and John Bannon), and four with SANFL (Leigh Whicker-CEO, Rod Payze, Philip Gallagher &amp; Jamie Coppins).

In 2010 the new Western Stand was completed, incorporating 14,000 individual seats and featuring improved shading conditions and amenities for SACA members.

====2012–2014 redevelopment====
In the lead-up to the 2010 state election, the opposition SA Liberals announced that, if elected, it would build with a new stadium with a roof, located at Riverside West at the site of the state government&#x27;s new hospital location. The incumbent SA Labor government subsequently announced it would fund a $450 million upgrade and redevelopment of the whole of Adelaide Oval, rather than just the Western Grand Stand.

However, in early-mid-2010, prior to the election, it became clear that $450m would be inadequate. Following the election, won by Labor, the Rann government capped the State Government&#x27;s commitment at $450 million, and set a deadline for the parties to agree. In May, treasurer Kevin Foley announced that &quot;the government&#x27;s final offer to the SANFL and SACA for the redevelopment&quot; was $535 million, and the deadline was extended to August 2010. Simultaneously, SACA and the SANFL were in the process of negotiating an agreement that would enable Australian rules football to use Adelaide Oval during the AFL season as their home ground. In August 2010, SANFL and SACA representatives signed letters of intent committing to the project, including the capped $535 million offer from the state government.

The redevelopment included a $40 million pedestrian bridge across the River Torrens to link the Adelaide railway station precinct with the Adelaide Oval precinct, which was partially completed for the Ashes cricket series in December 2013 and fully completed ahead of the 2014 AFL season.

In early 2011, the AFL, SANFL, SACA, the SA Government and the Australian Government reached an agreement to upgrade Adelaide Oval. The SACA and the SANFL proposed, if SACA members vote yes on the upgrade in early May, that the whole Stadium would undergo redevelopment, except for the Northern Mound, the Moreton Bay fig trees and the heritage-listed scoreboard. A three-quarters majority of SACA members were required to vote in favour of the proposed upgrade for it to ahead, with a successful vote resulting in the SANFL and AFL having control over the stadium for 7 months of the year and SACA having control for 5 months of the year. SACA members had the choice of voting online on 28 April 2011 or attending in person an Extraordinary Meeting at the Adelaide Showground on 2 May 2011. At 6 pm, 28 April 2011, It was announced that 60% of SACA members that voted online voted yes, 15% short of the majority vote needed for the upgrade to go ahead. At 10.15 pm, on 2 May 2011, the final result was announced: 80.37% of total votes cast were in favour of Adelaide Oval being redeveloped (10,078 members voted yes and 2,461 voted no), meaning that the 75% threshold had been reached and the upgrade and stadium reconfiguration was approved. Following the vote, the South Australian Government increased its funding commitment to $535 million.

The upgrade commenced in April 2012. The Chappell Stands and Sir Donald Bradman Stand were demolished. The Riverbank Stand was complete in late 2013 in time for the Ashes test as well as parts of level one of the Eastern Stand. The new Eastern Stand was fully completed with a total capacity of 19,000, bringing the overall seating capacity of the stadium to 50,083 in time for the 2014 AFL season.

As part of the 2012-14 redevelopment, the already rebuilt Western Grandstand (SACA and SANFL members-only stand) had modifications to improve sightlines for some seats, the addition of a new media centre for AFL, Rugby League, Rugby Union and Soccer matches and AFL standard interchange benches. The Northern Mound had its seating capacity increased, and the historic scoreboard and the Moreton Bay fig trees, planted in the 1890s, remained untouched. The 2014 development included renaming the central part of the Western stand the Sir Donald Bradman Pavilion.

====Recent upgrades====
The lights under the roof of the grandstands were replaced with LEDs in November 2017, followed by the light towers in December 2023 with the latter costing $5 million.

Australia&#x27;s first stadium-hotel, the Oval Hotel, was announced in December 2018 and opened in September 2020. It has 138 guest rooms.

==Description and features==

The venue is predominantly used for cricket and Australian rules football, but has also played host to rugby league, rugby union, soccer, and tennis, as well as regularly being used to hold concerts.

In 2012 Austadiums.com described Adelaide Oval as being &quot;one of the most picturesque Test cricket grounds in Australia, if not the world.&quot; After the completion of the ground&#x27;s redevelopment in 2014, sports journalist Gerard Whateley described the venue as being &quot;the most perfect piece of modern architecture because it&#x27;s a thoroughly contemporary stadium with all the character that it&#x27;s had in the past&quot;.

Volunteers lead 90-minute guided walking tours of the grounds for interested visitors, including children.

=== Oval and pitch===
The oval is by . This is both unusually long and narrow for an Australian cricket or football ground. The arrangement was highly favourable for batsmen who played square of the wicket, and heavily penalised bowlers who delivered the ball short or wide so that the batsman could play cut, hook or pull shots. Before the far ends in front of and behind the wicket were roped off, making the playing area shorter, it was not uncommon for batsmen to hit an all-run four or even occasionally a five.

The Adelaide Oval pitch runs north–south. Historically, Adelaide Oval&#x27;s integral pitch was generally very good for batting, and offering little assistance to bowlers until the last day of a match. Since the redevelopment in 2013, a drop-in pitch has been used at the venue.

=== Scoreboard ===

The heritage-listed scoreboard, designed by architect F. Kenneth Milne and located on &quot;The Hill&quot;, was first used in 1911, and has been retained. Today there is a manually-operated display adjacent to a huge digital one, around four storeys high. The scoreboard, which was first heritage-listed by the National Trust in 1984, was listed on the South Australian Heritage Register in 1986. This is the only manual scoreboard still operating in major Australasian cricket venues. Due to the 10-letter limit, some names have to be truncated, or be replaced by nicknames.

=== The Hill ===
&#x27;&quot;The Hill&quot; (or &quot;Northern Mound&quot;), located under the scoreboard and shaded by the Moreton Bay fig trees, was created in 1898 or 1900, with earth from the banks of the River Torrens. It became a favoured spot for some of the most vocal supporters in the crowd, and was known for being very noisy before the 2014 redevelopment.

Since then, seating has been installed on part of the hill, and only around 3,500 spectators can be accommodated on the strip of grass in front of the scoreboard, a fraction of the crowd that used to gather there. The Hill includes the Northern Mound Terrace, a hospitality venue set on large timber decking.

===Bradshaw Bell===

Since 2021 Bradshaw Bell, named after former SACA CEO Keith Bradshaw after his death, is rung at the start of each day&#x27;s play in a Test match. Weighing , the bell was designed by Australian Bell and local digital engineering company Applidyne, and forged at Billmans Foundry in Castlemaine, Victoria.

=== Members&#x27; stands ===
The members&#x27; stands were the first section of the ground completed in the 2014 redevelopment of Adelaide Oval. They retain significant portions of the original members&#x27; stands, including the brick archways and long room.

 Adelaide Oval has three grandstands: Riverbank Stand, Eastern Stand, and Western Stand.

The Riverbank Stand is the southern stand of Adelaide Oval, gaining its name from the River Torrens which is behind it. It has a capacity of 14,000 spectators.

The Eastern Stand holds 19,000 spectators. The five segments are named after South Australian Australian rules football identities: from north to south named Gavin Wanganeen Stand, Jack Oatey Stand, Max Basheer Stand, Fos Williams Stand, and Mark Ricciuto Stand.

===Victor Richardson Gates===
The Victor Richardson Gates, at the south-eastern entrance of the oval off King William Road, were locally heritage-listed as of city significance in 2001. Architect and then mayor James Campbell Irwin suggested the idea of honouring Richardson in 1965, and a public appeal supported by SACA and SANFL raised funds for the gates. In 1966, the small road leading to the Oval from King William Road was named Victor Richardson Drive. The five iron gates, set between rectangular arches, were erected in 1967, in honour of cricketer and footballer Victor Richardson (1894–1969). Former footballer Ian Hannaford was supervising architect, and reliefs created by South Australian sculptor John Dowie were added after over £5000 was raised. The gates include two double-sided bronze reliefs, showing groups of football players competing for the ball and cricketers batting, bowling, and fielding, with the batsman resembling Richardson. Lord Mayor Walter Bridgland led the opening ceremony on 28 October 1967, with Alderman Irwin opening the gates. Sir Donald Bradman and Don Brebner, then SANFL president, attended the ceremony, which was held during a Sheffield Shield lunch break. Players Ian and Greg Chappell, Richardson&#x27;s grandsons, helped to form the guard of honour. A central bronze plaque was installed after the death of Richardson in 1969.

In 2003, when the Chappell Stands were built, the gates were moved slightly northwards, and precast concrete pillars and a capping beam replaced the original metal framework. After the stands were demolished in April 2012, the Victor Richardson Gates were repositioned in March 2014.

===Other features===
There are also a number of statues, mainly of sportsmen, at the oval.

==Cricket==

=== International cricket ===


Adelaide Oval hosts some of the many events in the cricketing calendar, including the annual Australia Day One Day International on 26 January (replacing a traditional Australia Day Test) and every four years, one of the five Ashes Test matches against England. The Tests are now normally held in early December and is a clash between Australia and the international touring team of that particular season. Adelaide Oval was the host of the first ever day/night Test match, when Australia played New Zealand on 27 November 2015.

In 2011, Adelaide Oval held its first Twenty20 International between Australia and England, a match which England won by one wicket. The ground was announced as one of the venues for the 2022 ICC Men&#x27;s T20 World Cup, and hosted one of the semi-finals.

=== Domestic cricket ===
Adelaide Oval is the home ground for the first-class South Australian state cricket team, The West End Southern Redbacks and Twenty20 cricket team, the Adelaide Strikers. The Strikers compete in the Big Bash League. The Southern Redbacks compete in the Sheffield Shield and JLT One Day Cup.

===Test cricket records===
==Australian rules football==


From 1877 until the 1973 SANFL Grand Final, Adelaide Oval was the marquee ground for South Australian National Football League matches. After a dispute between cricket and SANFL administrators, Australian rules football in South Australia was moved to Football Park in the western suburbs of Adelaide until its permanent return to the ground in 2014. Adelaide Oval hosted the 1889 SAFA Grand Final, the first grand final in any Australian rules football competition after Port Adelaide and Norwood finished the 1889 SAFA season with the same win–loss–draw record. The record crowd for an Australian rules football match at Adelaide Oval was set at the 1965 SANFL Grand Final between Sturt and Port Adelaide when 62,543 saw the latter win by three points. After 1973 Australian rules football matches were sporadically held at the ground apart from South Adelaide games as that club continued to use the ground for their home matches after 1973. After the advent of the Australian Football League in 1990 only one AFL match was held at the ground before it was permanently adopted again by the code, with Port Adelaide hosting Melbourne during the last minor round match of the 2011 AFL season. As of 2014, all SANFL Finals Series matches are played at the ground including the SANFL Grand Final. Regular Australian Football League matches at the venue also began in 2014.

== Rugby League ==
In 1991, the NSWRL came to Adelaide Oval when the St. George Dragons played the Balmain Tigers on a cold and wet Friday night under temporary lights in the first of five games that the Dragons would play at the oval over the next five years. That game, with the Dragons winning 16–2, set a rugby league record crowd for the ground when 28,884 people attended, and was in fact the highest minor round attendance for the 1991 NSWRL season (beaten only by four of the six Finals series games including the Grand Final). In 1997 Adelaide got its own side in the much vaunted (but short lived) Super League competition with the Adelaide Rams. Their first home game attracted their record crowd when 27,435 saw the Rams defeat SL&#x27;s other new team, the Hunter Mariners 10–8. However, after disputes over money (and dwindling crowds due to poor on-field results) they left the ground in 1998 and moved to Hindmarsh Stadium. In the 2010 and 2011 National Rugby League seasons, Sydney club the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs played home games at the Oval against the Melbourne Storm. The Bulldogs had intended to make Adelaide Oval their second &quot;home&quot; (the club plays its home games at Sydney&#x27;s Olympic Stadium), but the plan was abandoned after 2010. On 20 November 2016, it was announced that the Sydney Roosters will take on the Melbourne Storm in the 2017 NRL season meaning that top level Rugby league returned to Adelaide for the first time since 2011. The Roosters won the game, played on 24 June in Round 16 of the season, 25–24 in golden point extra time in front of a crowd of 21,492 fans.

It was announced in February 2018 that the Oval would host one State of Origin match in 2020.

On 10 November 2022, it was announced that Adelaide Oval would host the first game of the 2023 State of Origin series on 31 May.

===Miscellaneous events===
The largest spectator event of the 19th century at the Adelaide Oval was the &quot;Grand Corroboree&quot;, a corroboree performed by around 100 Aboriginal men and women from Point MacLeay mission and Yorke Peninsula on Friday 30 May and Saturday 1 June 1885. They had been invited to Adelaide by the colonial government to perform as part of the Queen&#x27;s Birthday celebrations. After organisers expected a crowd of around 5,000, approximately 20,000 spectators (around a sixth of Adelaide&#x27;s population) turned up. The crowd became rowdy and police had to clear the performance space before the event could begin. Profits from the show were assigned to the Aboriginal people. The corroboree was so successful that other performances were arranged at other venues. Also at this time, the first football match held between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal teams in Adelaide was organised by Football and Cricketing Association secretary John Creswell, and a second followed at the oval on 2 June 1885.

As part of the 1927 Royal Tour, the Duke and Duchess of York had a motorcade through Adelaide Oval with many people present for the event.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in South Australia, the Adelaide Christmas Pageant was held at Adelaide Oval to a permitted audience of 25,000 in 2020, and 16,000 in 2021. Tickets were drawn from a raffle, and the pageant was held in the evening. The 2022 pageant returned to the streets, although Adelaide Oval was reserved in the event of another variant.

===Concerts===

Adelaide Oval has regularly been host to large outdoor concerts. The first major international act to perform at the Oval was Fleetwood Mac, in 1977.

<text>The name &quot;Miramichi&quot; was first applied to a region in the northeast of New Brunswick, Canada, and has since been applied to other places in Canada and the United States. Although other interpretations have been suggested, it is believed that &quot;Miramichi&quot; was derived from the Montagnais words &quot;Maissimeu Assi&quot; (meaning Mi&#x27;kmaq Land), and was perhaps introduced for use in European languages by Jacques Cartier in 1535.

Miramichi is used in the names of many places, including:

<doc id="660237" wikidata="Q3493035" url="?curid=660237" title="Phallogocentrism">
<text>In critical theory and deconstruction, phallogocentrism is a neologism coined by [[Saihibb Kaura] to refer to the privileging of the masculine ([[phallus]]) in the construction of meaning. The term is a [[blend word]] of the older terms &quot;[[phallocentrism]]&quot; (focusing on the masculine point of view) and &quot;[[logocentrism]]&quot; (focusing on language in assigning meaning to the world).

Derrida and others identified [[phonocentrism]], or the prioritizing of speech over writing, as an integral part of phallogocentrism. Derrida explored this idea in his essay &quot;Plato&#x27;s Pharmacy&quot;.

==Background==
In contemporary literary and philosophical works concerned with gender, the term &quot;phallogocentrism&quot; is commonplace largely as a result of the writings of Jacques Derrida, the founder of the philosophy of [[deconstruction]], which is considered by many academics to constitute an essential part of the discourse of postmodernism. Deconstruction is a philosophy of &quot;indeterminateness&quot; and its opposing philosophy, &quot;determinateness&quot;. According to deconstruction, indeterminate knowledge is &quot;[[aporetic]]&quot;, i.e., based on contradictory facts or ideas (&quot;aporias&quot;) that make it impossible to determine matters of truth with any degree of certitude; determinate knowledge, on the other hand, is &quot;[[apodictic]]&quot;, i.e., based on facts or ideas that are considered to be &quot;true&quot;, from one perspective or another.

The phallogocentric argument is premised on the claim that modern [[Western culture]] has been, and continues to be, both culturally and intellectually subjugated by &quot;logocentrism&quot; and &quot;phallocentrism&quot;. [[Logocentrism]] is the term Derrida uses to refer to the philosophy of determinateness, while phallocentrism is the term he uses to describe the way logocentrism itself has been genderized by a &quot;masculinist (phallic)&quot; and &quot;patriarchal&quot; agenda. Hence, Derrida intentionally merges the two terms phallocentrism and logocentrism as &quot;phallogocentrism&quot;.

The French feminist thinkers of the school of [[écriture féminine]] also share Derrida&#x27;s phallogocentric reading of &#x27;all of Western metaphysics&#x27;. For example, decry the &quot;dual, hierarchical oppositions&quot; set up by the traditional phallogocentric philosophy of determinateness, wherein &quot;death is always at work&quot; as &quot;the premise of woman&#x27;s abasement&quot;, woman who has been &quot;colonized&quot; by phallogocentric thinking. According to Cixous &amp; Clément, the &#x27;crumbling&#x27; of this way of thinking will take place through a Derridean-inspired, anti-phallo / logocentric philosophy of indeterminateness.

==Critique==
Swedish authors [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] propose a critique of Derrida&#x27;s interpretation of phallogocentrism in their works. They advocate a return to phallic vision as fundamental and necessary for western civilization after 1945. They regard this phallic return as materialized through technology rather than through ever more academic discourse. In response to Derrida &quot;et al&quot;., Bard &amp; Söderqvist propose that the phallogocentric project – which they call &quot;eventology&quot; – rather needs to be complemented with a return to &quot;nomadology&quot;, or the myth of [[Eternal return of the same|the eternal return of the same]], a matrichal renaissance which they claim has already materialized in system theory and [[complexity theory for the social sciences|complexity theory]], from which both feminism and androgynism are merely later but welcome effects. According to Bard &amp; Söderqvist it is merely the centrism and not the phallogos in itself which has ever been problematic.

French philosopher [[Catherine Malabou]], part-time collaborator with Derrida himself, has taken a similar constructive critical approach to the idea of phallogocentrism, for example Going into dialogue with [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] masters like [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jacques Lacan]] and most recently [[Alain Badiou]] – to whose philosophy of the event, Malabou responds with a radical [[traumatology]] firmly rooted in the neurosciences – her take is simply that psychoanalysis is inadequate to respond to the challenges she forwards due to its phallogocentrist fixation, a dilemma she believes the neurosciences are better fit to solve. The name of her solution to this problem is [[Plasticity (brain)|plasticity]].

<doc id="660240" wikidata="Q2371355" url="?curid=660240" title="Batfink">
<text>Batfink is an American animated television series, consisting of five-minute shorts, that first aired in April 1966. The 100-episode series was quickly created by Hal Seeger, starting in 1966, to send up the popular &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Green Hornet&quot; television series, which had premiered the same year.

It depicts an anthropomorphic bat cyborg who acts as superhero and a martial artist who is acting as his sidekick. The main villain is a mad scientist who seeks world domination.

==Plot==
Batfink is a bat superhero with metal wings. With the help of his sidekick, Karate, he fights crime in his city, usually against his recurring villain, Hugo A-Go-Go, but also against others.

Many episodes place Batfink in a dangerous cliffhanger-type situation; typically, this is effected by trapping him in some sort of bondage, placing him in a position that renders his wings useless. At the moment the potentially fatal shot is fired, the action freezes, and the narrator asks dramatically if Batfink will survive. The action then continues, with Batfink escaping via a convenient but previously unseen deus ex machina or through the use of his superpowers.

==Characters==
===Batfink===
Batfink (voiced by Frank Buxton) is a superpowered anthropomorphic grey cyborg bat in a yellow costume with a big red &quot;B&quot; on the chest and red gauntlets and boots. He uses his supersonic sonar radar and black metallic wings to fight crime. When not fighting crime, Batfink lives in a split-level cave, though he also has a direct video link to the Chief&#x27;s office in case his help is needed.

Batfink&#x27;s &quot;supersonic sonar radar&quot; is a super-powered version of a bat&#x27;s echolocation, used to locate prey. Batfink&#x27;s power takes the form of the letters of the word &quot;BEEP&quot; either once or twice emanating from his mouth. The radar is anthropomorphic and sentient and can fly wherever Batfink needs them to go – accompanied by a distinctive beeping noise. His catchphrase during that time is &quot;My supersonic sonar radar will help me!&quot; Whenever Batfink said those words, he would say it through the open sun roof of the Battilac car, while it was not in motion. The radar can see, feel fear, evade capture and report back to Batfink on what it has seen. In one episode, the radar is ambushed and beaten up. The radar also gets confused, misdirected, and lost, leaving Batfink to rely on other means to spy upon the episode&#x27;s villain. Once, when the radar is sent to investigate Queenie Bee and her swarm of villainous bees, it returns with the &quot;EEP&quot; swollen with bee stings. When Karate asks Batfink &quot;How come they just stung the E-E-P?&quot;, he replies &quot;Because a bee would never harm another bee. But a bee will tell on another bee.&quot;. The literal spelled-out appearance of an onomatopœia was a running gag not limited to the supersonic sonar radar; in one episode, Hugo A-Go-Go invented a tickling stick that tickles its adversaries into submission, which sent out the words &quot;Kitchy Koo&quot; to do the deed on Batfink (the episode ended with Batfink slicing the K&#x27;s off to create the far more irritating, but less distracting, &quot;Itchy Oo&quot;).

Batfink&#x27;s main defense are his metallic wings, which he is able to fold around himself as a protective shield against most attacks, thereby spawning the most famous catchphrase of the show: &quot;Your bullets cannot harm me – my wings are like a shield of steel!&quot; He claims in some episodes that his wings are stainless steel, but in other episodes he explicitly states that they are not – since he always carries a can of spot remover to keep them polished. Batfink can also use his wings as offensive weapons. In one episode, he uses one of them as a sword during a duel. His wings can also help him fly at incredible speeds. They are often used to help him escape certain death or cut through bonds when he has been captured (he can break out of regular ropes, but not rubber ones). In the episode &quot;Ebenezer the Freezer&quot;, Batfink has automatic retrorockets built into his wings, but not in any other episode. Sometimes, his wings hinder him. When in water, he will sink because of the weight of his metal wings. Powerful magnets are also a problem for him. Plutonium, for reasons unexplained (but possibly relating to his birth in a plutonium mine), also renders the wings useless. Batfink&#x27;s life and wings are explained in the final episode, &quot;Batfink: This Is Your Life&quot;, which depicts his boyhood and how his real wings were replaced.

Batfink rides in a customized pink car resembling a Volkswagen Beetle with scalloped rear fins and bat-winged red &quot;B&quot; emblems on the doors and hood. Called the &quot;Battillac&quot; (rhymes with &quot;Cadillac&quot;), the car is outfitted with a sun roof and many defensive devices, and is resistant to collision damage and energy weapons. Batfink often says something like &quot;It&#x27;s a good thing the Battillac is equipped with a thermonuclear plutonium-insulated blast shield!&quot; and Karate replies, &quot;It&#x27;s also good it was a small bomb&quot;. As soon as a crime is acknowledged, Batfink says &quot;Karate, the Battillac!&quot;

In the last episode of the series, titled &quot;Batfink: This Is Your Life&quot;, it is revealed that Batfink was born in an abandoned plutonium mine, which is where he obtained his powers, and that he lost his natural wings as a child while saving his mother&#x27;s life after escaped convicts blew up their mountain-top cave (plutonium in real life is too scarce in the Earth&#x27;s crust to be mined, it must be synthesized, usually from uranium). This incident is what motivated him to become a crime-fighter.

Kara &quot;Karate&quot; Te (voiced by Len Maxwell) is a gi-clad martial arts expert and Batfink&#x27;s oafish sidekick who drives the Battillac. He is somewhat oversized and not very bright, but is strong enough to help Batfink out of any situation. He carries a wide variety of objects and gadgets in his &quot;utility sleeve&quot; (a parody of Batman&#x27;s utility belt), but he often has trouble finding what he needs in it. Karate tends to succeed by dumb luck rather than by skill or ingenuity, and often Karate&#x27;s involvement will make a bad situation worse. Karate is usually ordered to check downstairs while Batfink checks the upper floor. At the end of each episode, Karate will make a corny pun that is sometimes physical on the part of his stupidity. Karate&#x27;s father was the blacksmith who made Batfink&#x27;s metallic wings.

Karate is a direct send-up of Kato, the Green Hornet&#x27;s companion, but his hulking size is inspired by the Bond villain Oddjob. Also, like in &quot;The Green Hornet&quot;, when both characters are in the car, Karate is the driver, while Batfink rides in the back seat. In early episodes, he speaks in a stereotypical Asian accent; in later episodes, he is voiced in a clipped, nasal speech pattern, inspired by Don Adams, whose &quot;Get Smart&quot; character, Maxwell Smart, was popular at the time. On occasion, Karate even utters the Maxwell Smart-inspired catchphrase, &quot;Sorry about that, Batfink&quot;.

===The Chief===
The Chief of Police (voiced by Len Maxwell) is Batfink&#x27;s contact on the local police force and informs Batfink of all the latest crimes via a direct video link to Batfink&#x27;s Split-Level Cave. Batfink answers &quot;The hotline — Batfink here&quot;. The Chief also has a wife and children, who never appear onscreen, but are mentioned by Karate as having seen them in the episode &quot;Tough MacDuff.&quot;

===The Mayor===
The Mayor is the unnamed mayor of the city that Batfink protects.

===The Narrator===
The Narrator (voiced by Len Maxwell) narrates each episode while explaining certain information and doing the cliffhanger narration.

===Hugo A-Go-Go===
General Professor Hugo &quot;Jerkules&quot; A-Go-Go (voiced by Frank Buxton) is the wild-haired smocked main villain of the series. He speaks English with a German accent. He is referred to as the world&#x27;s maddest scientist and spends his time in his secret laboratory creating weird and wacky inventions (including a robot bride, complete with robot mother-in-law) to defeat Batfink and dominate the world. He always manages to escape jail to antagonize the hero in a later episode. Hugo A-Go-Go often breaks the fourth wall and has conversations with the narrator.

==Episodes==
==Hidden political message==
According to Dave Mackey&#x27;s &quot;Batfink&quot; site, a two-part political message is concealed in two episodes, disguised as sped-up gibberish. Mackey translates the message as follows:

* Part 1 (in &quot;Spin the Batfink&quot;): &quot;The most dangerous force in America today is Walter Reuther and his political machine. It&#x27;s time we realized that they intend to run this country. When the smut publishers put a...&quot;
* Part 2 (in &quot;Bride and Doom&quot;): &quot;...dirty cover on a clean book, let&#x27;s take it at face value and call it trash and dump it in the river&quot;.

==Production and syndication==
The cartoon was produced at Hal Seeger Studios, in New York City, and at Bill Ackerman Productions in Midland Park, New Jersey. It was syndicated by Screen Gems and continued to air on local stations throughout the 1980s. Nickelodeon briefly aired episodes of &quot;Batfink&quot; on &quot;Weinerville&quot; as well as its &quot;Nick in the Afternoon&quot; block in 1995 and 1997. In September 2006, it returned to the U.S. as part of &quot;Cartoons Without a Clue&quot;, Boomerang&#x27;s mystery lineup on weekends.

The &quot;Batfink&quot; series was very popular in the UK, becoming a cult series like the later &quot;Danger Mouse&quot;, and from 1967 onwards, it was shown at least once every year on UK terrestrial television until 1983, initially on the BBC network, where it was allocated an early evening slot just before the BBC News, and latterly as part of Children&#x27;s ITV; it subsequently reappeared in 1986 on the ITV Saturday morning magazine show &quot;Get Fresh&quot;. In the early 1990s, it was repeated again as part of TV-am&#x27;s &quot;Wide Awake Club/Wacaday&quot; series; after &quot;Wacaday&quot; finished in 1992, &quot;Batfink&quot; was consigned to the vaults in the UK for the next twelve years. It was introduced to a new audience in 2004. It first aired on 6 January 1994 on BBC One during its CBBC Block at the exact time of 16;00, was included in a number of episodes of the BBC&#x27;s Saturday morning show &quot;Dick and Dom in da Bungalow&quot;, and since April 2006, it has been enjoying an extended, if somewhat irregular, repeat run on CBBC. This run finished in the 2010s.

&quot;Batfink&quot; was made quickly and cheaply by re-using stock sequences. Although most serial animations do this to some extent, &quot;Batfink&quot; did it more than most. Commonly repeated scenes include the intro to the initial briefings by the Chief (the TV screen hotline buzzing into life), Batfink and Karate getting into the Battillac, the Battillac going round mountain bends, the Battillac going over a bridge, Batfink&#x27;s supersonic sonar radar, and others. Sometimes, the repeated scenes would be cut short, so that sections could be re-used to fit the storyline more closely.

==DVD release==
* Cinema Club released the complete series on Region 2 DVD on 6 December 2004.
* Shout! Factory released &quot;Batfink: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on 3 July 2007.
** Both DVD boxsets run over four DVDs and contain all 100 episodes of the series.
* In January 2007, A-Design released a single &quot;Batfink&quot; DVD in Bulgaria, which includes 26 5-minute segments.

<text>Mordehai &quot;Moti&quot; Milgrom is an Israeli physicist and professor in the department of Particle Physics and Astrophysics at the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, Israel.

==Biography==
He received his B.Sc. degree from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1966. Later he studied at the Weizmann Institute of Science and completed his doctorate in 1972. Before 1980 he worked primarily on high-energy astrophysics and became well-known for his kinematical model of the star system SS 433. In the academic years 1980–1981 and 1985–1986 he was at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In 1983, he proposed modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) as an alternative to the dark matter and galaxy rotation curve problems, although preliminary work and discussions on this subject started as early as 1981.

==Milgrom and modified Newtonian dynamics==
Milgrom is a prominent proponent of the hypothesis that Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation should be modified for very small accelerations, typically of the order of 10−11g and less.

==Personal life==
Milgrom is married and has three daughters.

<doc id="660248" wikidata="Q2594302" url="?curid=660248" title="Receivership">
<text>In law, receivership is a situation in which an institution or enterprise is held by a receiver – a person &quot;placed in the custodial responsibility for the property of others, including tangible and intangible assets and rights&quot; – especially in cases where a company cannot meet its financial obligations and is said to be insolvent. The receivership remedy is an equitable remedy that emerged in the English chancery courts, where receivers were appointed to protect real property. Receiverships are also a remedy of last resort in litigation involving the conduct of executive agencies that fail to comply with constitutional or statutory obligations to populations that rely on those agencies for their basic human rights.

==Types of receivership==
Receiverships can be broadly divided into two types: 
*those related to insolvency or enforcement of a security interest
*those where either:
**a person is incapable of managing their affairs and a court has appointed a receiver to manage the property on their behalf – for example, a receiver appointed by a court of protection under mental health legislation (in some jurisdictions, this is called conservatorship) or
**a court seizes control of property because of breaches of law or regulation.

Receiverships relating to insolvency are subdivided into two further categories: administrative/equity receivership, where the receiver is granted wide management powers over all or most of the property of a business, and other receiverships (sometimes misleadingly called &quot;fixed charge receiverships&quot;) where the receiver has limited control over specific property, with no broader powers beyond managing or selling the individual asset.

Receivers are appointed by either a government regulator, privately, or a court.

The receiver&#x27;s powers &quot;flow from the document(s) underlying his appointment&quot; – i.e., a statute, financing agreement, or court order.

==Duties of a receiver==
The receiver may:
*run the company to maximize the value of the company&#x27;s assets, sell the company as a whole, or sell part of the company and close unprofitable divisions
*secure the assets of the company or entity
*realize the assets of the company or entity
*manage company affairs to pay debts.

==United States==
Several regulatory entities have been granted power by the Congress to place banking and financial institutions into receivership like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for failing nationally chartered commercial banks; the Office of Thrift Supervision for failing savings and loan associations (thrift institutions); and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) for government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the 11 Federal Home Loan Banks. Most individual states also have granted receivership authority to their own bank regulatory agencies and insurance regulators. State Insurance Departments are accredited by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)—which states, &quot;State law should set forth a receivership scheme for the administration, by the insurance commissioner, of insurance companies found to be insolvent as set forth in the NAIC&#x27;s Insurer Receivership Model Act.&quot;

Some organizations have come into existence on the state level to alter the proceedings. An example is the California Receivers Forum, which is a non-profit organization &quot;formed by interested receivers, attorneys, accountants, and property managers, with support from the Los Angeles Superior Court, to address the needs and concerns of receivers, to facilitate communication between the receivership community and the courts, and to assist in raising the level of professionalism of receivers...&quot; The California Receivers Forum reports five local affiliates in the state: Bay Area, Central California, LA/Orange County, Sacramento Valley and San Diego.

Court-appointed receivers are &quot;the most powerful and independent of the judicially appointed managers.&quot; Unlike special masters and monitors, &quot;the receiver completely displaces the defendants: the receiver makes large and small decisions, spends the organization&#x27;s funds, and controls hiring and firing determinations.&quot; Examples of court-appointed receivers include:
*In the District of Columbia, the D.C. Jail&#x27;s medical care facility &quot;was placed under court-ordered receivership in August 1995, after the District was held in contempt for repeatedly failing to implement court orders...intended to ensure adequate medical services to jail inmates&quot;. The receivership ended in September 2000.
*An insolvent fuel company is managed by a court-appointed receiver.
*A U.S. District Judge appointed a receiver for the multi-level marketing company Equinox International in August 1999. As of 2007, the receiver was authorized to distribute settlement funds from the now-defunct company to approved claimants.
*After placing the California state prison health care system into receivership in June 2005, a U.S. District Judge appointed a receiver for it in February 2006. California Correctional Health Care Services (under control of the California Correctional Health Care Receivership) attempts &quot;to bring medical care in California prisons up to constitutional standards&quot;.
*In February 2007, a judge in Florida appointed a receiver for companies owned by Lou Pearlman that defrauded investors. The receiver later said about the companies &quot;I don&#x27;t see much in the way of hard assets that are worth anything or are not already fully encumbered [with debt].&quot;

==United Kingdom and certain other common law jurisdictions==
Administrative receivership is a procedure in the United Kingdom and certain other common law jurisdictions whereby a creditor can enforce security against a company&#x27;s assets in an effort to obtain repayment of the secured debt. It used to be the most popular method of enforcement by secured creditors, but recent legislative reform in many jurisdictions has reduced its significance considerably in certain countries.

Administrative receivership differs from simple receivership in that an administrative receiver is appointed over all of the assets and undertakings of the company. This means that an administrative receiver can normally only be appointed by the holder of a floating charge. Because of this unusual role, insolvency legislation usually grants wider powers to administrative receivers, but also controls the exercise of those powers to try to mitigate potential prejudice to unsecured creditors.

Typically, an administrative receiver is an accountant with considerable experience of insolvency matters.

===Background to receivership in the UK===

The common law has long recognised the concept of a receiver. Following development of the floating charge, creditors were effectively able to take security over a company&#x27;s entire business by means of a floating charge over the undertaking. Security documents generally contained very wide powers of appointment such that on default the creditor could take over the business immediately and without the input of any court. A receiver appointed to the entire business became known as a &quot;receiver and manager&quot;. The receiver and manager would typically have extensive powers over the business, including the power to sell it at a time and on terms that suited the appointing creditor.

The ability to appoint a receiver and manager was a very powerful remedy, but it came to be considered unsatisfactory in that it was entirely a creature of the contract between the creditor and the borrower. There was no general ability on the part of the borrower or any other party to review the actions of the receiver (who would generally be acting on behalf of &quot;the borrower&quot; under the security document) or seek the supervision of the court. A general review of UK insolvency law in the 1980s began with the Cork Report and culminated in the Insolvency Act 1986. It put forward two major reforms. First, it put the receiver and manager on a statutory footing: a receiver appointed to all or substantially all of a company&#x27;s property was now an administrative receiver and subject to some statutory responsibilities. Second, it introduced an &quot;administration order&quot; as an equivalent process to administrative receivership – but available to any company by court order independent of any particular security arrangement.

The UK Parliament expected that companies and creditors would use administration in preference to administrative receivership. Crucially, however, Parliament had conceded in the Insolvency Act that administrative receivership should have priority – that is, a secured creditor with a floating charge could defeat any attempt to commence an administration by appointing an administrative receiver. As a result, administration was not as popular as lawmakers had envisaged, and secured creditors habitually appointed administrative receivers to enforce security rights. Parliament took more drastic action in the &quot;Enterprise Act 2002&quot;. The administration regime was changed to make it more attractive, but also barred the right to appoint administrative receivers in any security created after 15 September 2003 (subject to certain specific exceptions). Any attempt to do so takes effect as a power to appoint an administrator.

===Present situation===

Administrative receivership still forms part of modern insolvency practice. Companies that get into financial difficulty today may well have security packages that were created before 15 September 2003, a situation likely to remain common for some years. Enforcement is also a significant aspect of the situations where administrative receivership is still permitted; for example, the ability to take control of the entirety of the assets is important in structuring insolvency-remote special purpose companies that issue securities or operate infrastructure projects.

In common law jurisdictions outside of the United Kingdom, administrative receivership remains popular. A number of offshore jurisdictions market transaction structures to banks on the basis that they still retain the freedom to appoint administrative receivers in those jurisdictions.

Because of their unique role, insolvency legislation usually confers wide powers on administrative receivers under applicable insolvency law, which is usually concurrent with powers granted under the security document. However, the corollary is that administrative receivers are usually required under applicable legislation to file reports in relation to the period of their receivership.

==Ireland==
Similarly to the United Kingdom process, methods for receiver appointment in Ireland are as follows:
*creditor-appointed receiver on providing debenture document (the most common method)
*High Court-appointed receiver under the &quot;Conveyancing Act 1881&quot; or the &quot;Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877&quot;
*under the Rules of the Superior Courts.

<text>The David Florida Laboratory is the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s spacecraft assembly, integration and testing centre, in Shirleys Bay, just west of central Ottawa. It is operated by the Canadian Space Agency and rented out to Canadian and foreign aerospace and telecommunications companies and organizations for qualifying space bound equipment such as communication or scientific satellites, or components made to be placed on satellites or installed in a space station. The laboratory was named to honour C. David Florida, a leading Canadian pioneer in space research.

Officially opened in September 1972, the lab has been expanded over the years to accommodate the demand for its services. There are many support facilities such as storage areas, clean rooms, electrodynamic shakers, anechoic chambers, space (thermal and vacuum) simulation chambers and in-house mechanical, electrical and electronic shops.

In the past the David Florida Laboratory has tested satellites for Brazil, Indonesia, and the European Space Agency. Inmarsat has designated it as their authorized antenna test house. It has also tested Canadian satellites such as RADARSAT-1 and previously tested the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (Dextre) which now forms part of the Mobile Servicing System of the International Space Station. It completed work on the Orbiter Boom Sensor System which first flew on Shuttle Discovery during STS-114. The Laboratory worked on RADARSAT-2 prior to launch in 2007.

Recently the David Florida Laboratory has completed the integration and environmental testing of the Maritime Monitoring and Messaging Microsatellite (M3MSat). This is a technology demonstration satellite that will be used to assess the utility of having in space an Automatic Identification System (AIS) for reading signals from vessels to better manage transport in Canadian waters. M3MSat was scheduled to be launched in 2015.

The government announced in March 2024 that the laboratory will close by March 31, 2025.

<text>Cumberland County, New York was a county in the Province of New York that became part of the state of Vermont. It was divided out of Albany County in New York in 1766, but eventually became a part of Vermont in 1777. At that time, Vermont was holding itself out as the Republic of Vermont and was not admitted to the Union until 1791.

Located south of Gloucester County and east of Charlotte County (Anderson, p. 67 ), incorporated from Albany County (see map from 1777 Charlotte County, Province of New York), Cumberland County was fused with Gloucester County, New York to become Cumberland County, Vermont, which, along with Bennington County, comprised the only two counties in that state. The Vermont Cumberland County was abolished by being partitioned into several new counties in Vermont and one in New Hampshire.

The County of Gloucester name was used occasionally in contemporary documents, but the 28 February 1770 Order for Erection and many subsequent documents refer to the region as the County of Glocester. Contemporary maps also refer to the area as the County of Glocester.

<text>The Milan Papyrus is a papyrus roll inscribed in Alexandria in the late 3rd or early 2nd century BC during the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty. It is currently held by the University of Milan (inventory no. 1295 R), and it is also known in scholarship under its label P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309.

== History ==
Originally discovered by anonymous tomb raiders as part of a mummy wrapping, it was purchased in the papyrus &quot;grey market&quot; in Europe in 1992 by the University of Milan.

As the earliest surviving example of a Greek poetry book as well as the largest addition to the corpus of classical Greek poetry in many years, the tale of the discovery made &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;National Geographic.&quot;

Labelled the &quot;Milan Papyrus,&quot; it was published in a scholarly edition in 2001, edited by Guido Bastianini, Claudio Gallazzi, and Colin Austin, with contributions by other scholars. The edition included the complete transcription of the recto of the papyrus, with extensive commentary, and high-quality facsimiles of the whole roll.

In 2002, Austin and Bastianini published a comprehensive, smaller edition, &quot;Posidippi Pellaei quae supersunt omnia&quot;, &quot;all the surviving works of Posidippus of Pella&quot;, including the epigrams of the papyrus, the epigrams known through Tzetzes and other epigrams transmitted by the &quot;Palatine Anthology&quot;, with Italian and English translations. This has been considered the authoritative edition of Posidippus&#x27; works ever since.

Scholars have rushed to mine this new trove of highly conscious literary productions at the most sophisticated level that were created in a major center of Hellenistic culture.

After a &quot;standing-room only&quot; discussion at the American Philological Association annual meeting in January 2001, a seminar on the Milan Papyrus was held at Harvard&#x27;s Center for Hellenic Studies in April 2002, and international conferences were held at Milan, Florence and Cincinnati, in November 2002.

Scholarly work on the Milan Papyrus, on Posidippus, who is now revealed in a broader range of subjects, and on the Alexandrian literary epigram in general, was invigorated by the discovery and proceeds apace.

== Description &amp; contents ==
Over six hundred previously unknown lines of Greek poetry are on the roll, representing about 112 brief poems, or epigrams. Two of these were already known and had been attributed by the 12th-century AD Byzantine scholar John Tzetzes to the Hellenistic epigrammatist Posidippus of Pella (c. 310 – c. 240 BC), a Macedonian who spent his literary career in Alexandria. The initial reaction has been to attribute all the new lines to Posidippus, though Franco Ferrari suggests that there is evidence the manuscript is an anthology, in which Posidippus&#x27; epigrams predominated.

In addition to the epigrams, which are written on the recto (i.e., the inner surface of the roll), the papyrus also bears a mythological text in Greek, heavily damaged, which was written on the verso (the outer surface) and, as of 2023, is still unpublished.

In terms of the date, one source suggests that &quot;One side contains approximately 600 lines of verse in a hand that has been dated to c. 230-200 BCE. The other side has some mythological material which dates to the early 2nd century BCE.&quot; Another says &quot;All sixteen columns of P.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309 are written in a style dating back to ca. 220 BC&quot;.

<doc id="660279" wikidata="Q7234123" url="?curid=660279" title="Postcodes in New Zealand">
<text>Postcodes in New Zealand consist of four digits, the first two of which specify the area, the third the type of delivery (street, PO Box, Private Bag, or Rural delivery), and the last the specific lobby, RD (rural delivery) number, or suburb. The present postcode system was introduced in New Zealand in June 2006, which, unlike the previous system, applies to all items of mail with effect from June 2008. In October 2008, New Zealand Post launched a &#x27;remember your postcode&#x27; campaign, offering a $10,000 prize for remembering a postcode.

This replaced a previous system, introduced in 1977, in which New Zealand Post did not require individual items of mail to include the postcode in the address. Optical character recognition (OCR) enabled automated sorting machines to scan entire addresses, rather than just postcodes, as was the case with older machines. This was very similar to the case in Ireland. OCR technology was introduced in 1992; when the first of seven OCR machines were installed in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch Mail Centres, most mail was sorted manually.

==Allocation==

There are 1,856 postcodes, each of which may serve up to 10,000 individual locations. Postcodes are generally allocated north to south.

== Examples ==

In cities and large towns, the last two digits indicate one of the four modes of delivery, as illustrated by addresses in Palmerston North:

* Street address, in which mail is delivered directly to homes by the &#x27;postie&#x27;;

:43 Vogel Street
:Roslyn
:Palmerston North 4414

* PO Box address, in which mail is delivered to a private box, usually at a Post Shop (formerly Post Office), for collection;

:PO Box 400
:Palmerston North Central
:Palmerston North 4440

* Private Bag, in which a private mail bag is delivered to an organisation such as a large company or a government department
:Private Bag 11222
:Manawatu Mail Centre
:Palmerston North 4442

* Rural Delivery, used in rural areas for home deliveries.

:Railway Road
:RD 10
:Palmerston North 4470

== Previous system ==
Although postcodes were first introduced in New Zealand in 1977, these were used entirely for pre-sorting large volumes of mail in bulk, similar to the Mailsort system used by Royal Mail in the United Kingdom. Consequently, postcodes were not usually seen in addresses:

:New Zealand Post
:Private Bag 39990
:Wellington Mail Centre
:Lower Hutt

Under the old system, Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch were divided into postal zones, which were incorporated into the postcode system for use in bulk mailings. For example, for the former Wellington 4:

:Flat 2
:173 Park Road
:Johnsonville
:Wellington 6004

In cities and large towns, the last two digits indicated the mode of delivery, as illustrated by addresses in Palmerston North:

Street address:

:43 Vogel Street
:Palmerston North 5301

Post Office Box address:

:P O Box 4000
:Palmerston North 5315

Private Bag address
:Private Bag 11222
:Palmerston North 5320

Rural Delivery address

:Railway Road
:R D 10
:Palmerston North 5321

NB: Prior to the changeover, New Zealand Post also required that a space be inserted between the letters &#x27;P&#x27; and &#x27;O&#x27; in &#x27;PO Box&#x27; or &#x27;R&#x27; and &#x27;D&#x27; in &#x27;RD&#x27;.
== Māori names ==

New Zealand Post recognises Māori names for cities and towns in New Zealand; for example, the Māori Language Commission&#x27;s address is:

:Te Taura Whiri i te Reo Māori
:Pouaka Poutāpeta 411
:Te Whanganui a Tara 6140

In English, this translates as:

:Māori Language Commission
:PO Box 411
:Wellington 6140

In spite of the considerable difference between the two languages, there was no need to add the postcode under the old system, which in this case would have been 6015.

==Freepost==
Mail to members of the New Zealand Parliament is delivered free of charge for individuals (organisations must pay regular rates). The cost is deducted from the Member&#x27;s budget.

:Rt Hon 
:Prime Minister
:Private Bag 18888
:Parliament Buildings
:Wellington 6160

Other Freepost mail includes a unique number as well as the PO Box or Private Bag number:

:Freepost 112002
:CARM
:PO Box 913
:Dunedin 9054

<doc id="660281" wikidata="Q305721" url="?curid=660281" title="Abayudaya">
<text>The Abayudaya (&quot;Abayudaya&quot; is Luganda for &quot;People of Judah&quot;) are a Jewish community in eastern Uganda, near the town of Mbale. They are devout in their practice, keeping kashrut and observing Shabbat. There are several different villages where the Abayudaya live. A community that converted to Judaism in the 20th century, most community members are affiliated with the Reform and Conservative movements of Judaism. In June 2016, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin led a Beit Din that performed an Orthodox conversion for the Putti community of Abayudaya.

The Abayudaya&#x27;s population is estimated to number between 2,000 and 3,000; like their neighbors, they are subsistence farmers. Most Abayudaya are of Bagwere origin. Some, from Namutumba, are Basoga. They speak Luganda, Soga, or Gwere, and some have learned Hebrew as well.

==History==
=== 19th century ===
The group owes its origin to Muganda military leader Semei Kakungulu. Originally, Kakungulu was converted to Christianity by British missionaries around 1880. He believed that the British would allow him to be king of the territories Bukedi and Bugisu, which he had conquered in a battle for them. However, when the British limited his territory to a significantly smaller size and refused to recognize him as king as they had promised, Kakungulu began to distance himself from them. 

=== 20th century ===
In 1913, Semei Kakungulu became a member of the Bamalaki sect, which followed a belief system that combined elements of Judaism, Christianity, and Christian Science, most notably, a refusal to use western medicine (based on a few sentences taken from the Old Testament). This led to conflict with the British when the Bamalaki refused to vaccinate their cattle. However, upon further study of the Bible, Kakungulu came to believe that the customs and laws described in the Five Books of Moses (the Torah) were really true. When, in 1919, Kakungulu insisted on circumcision as prescribed in the Hebrew Bible, the Bamalaki refused and told him that if he practiced circumcision he would be like the Jews. Kakungulu responded, &quot;Then, I am a Jew!&quot; He circumcised his sons and himself and declared that his community was Jewish. According to Henry Lubega, &quot;he fled to the foot of Mt. Elgon and settled in a place called Gangama where he started a separatist sect known as Kibina Kya Bayudaya Abesiga Katonda (the Community of Jews who trust in the Lord).&quot; The British were infuriated by this action and they effectively severed all ties with him and his followers.

The arrival of a foreign Jew known as &quot;Yosef&quot;, presumably of Ashkenazi background, in 1920 contributed much towards the community&#x27;s acquisition of knowledge about the seasons in which Jewish holidays, such as Pesach, Shavuot, Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot, take place. A source in the Abayudaya community confirms that the first Jew to visit the community was Yosef, who stayed with and taught the community for about six months, and would appear to have first brought the Jewish calendar to the Abayudaya community.

Furthermore, the laws concerning kashrut were first introduced to the community by Yosef. The community continues to practice kashrut today. Yosef&#x27;s teachings influenced Semei Kakungulu to establish a school that acted as a type of Yeshiva, with the purpose of passing on and teaching the skills and knowledge first obtained from Yosef.

After Kakungulu&#x27;s death from tetanus in 1928, Samson Mugombe Israeli, one of his disciples, became the spiritual leader of the community, which isolated itself for self-protection.

In 1962, Arye Oded, an Israeli studying at Makerere University, visited the Abayudaya and met Samson Mugombe. This was the first time the Abayudaya had ever met an Israeli, and the first time the community was meeting a foreign Jew since Yosef. Oded had many long interviews with Mugombe and other leaders and explained to them how Jews in Israel practised Judaism. Oded then wrote a book (&quot;Religion and Politics in Uganda,&quot;) and numerous articles on the community and their customs which introduced them to world Jewry.

However, in the 1970s they were persecuted by Idi Amin, who outlawed Jewish rituals and destroyed synagogues. Some of the Abayudaya community converted to either Christianity or Islam in the face of religious persecution. A core group of roughly 300 members remained, however, committed to Judaism, worshipping secretly and fearful that they would be discovered by their neighbors and reported to the authorities. This group later named itself &quot;She&#x27;erit Yisrael&quot; — the Remnant of Israel — meaning the surviving (Ugandan) Jews.

The community underwent a revival in the 1980s. 

=== 21st century ===
Approximately 400 Abayudaya community members were formally converted by five rabbis of the Conservative branch of Judaism in February 2002, and conversions by Conservative rabbis continued during the following years. During the 1990&#x27;s they were related to a Messianic (Christian) Jewish congregation led by David Finkelstein. 

In 2017, the community lives near the newly built Stern Synagogue on Nabugoye Hill outside Mbale and the nearby synagogue in the village of Namanyonyi plus others live in Nasenyi, Nalubembe, Buseta, Nangolo and the sole Orthodox community, Putti, all in Pallisa District. An eighth village, Namutumba, with a synagogue, is in Magada Village, approximately 70 km south. Finally, a ninth village, Apac, is way north of Mbale. A census was conducted in 2015 by village members, which showed the total population as 1067.

Namutumba, the largest village, is a thriving Jewish community with about 244 members with an active synagogue. The community has built an interfaith primary school - Tikkun Olam Primary School (TOPS) serving its greater community, has active young leadership in economic development and is seeking to improve the lives of all its community members. Yoash Mayende is the Director of TOPS, a completely solar campus. Rabbi Levi Shadrach Mugoya is their current spiritual leader. The elder Rabbi Eri appointed Shadrach to be his successor, “a great honor and a great responsibility.” Shadrach attended Uganda Christian University and graduated with a degree in Project Planning and Entrepreneurship in 2013. He studied in the yeshiva of the chief Abayudaya Rabbi, Gershom Sizomu. Shadrach is now pursuing his studies with ALEPH (Alliance for Jewish Renewal) so that he can lead his people well as their rabbi. The Conservative Yeshivah in Israel has accepted him to study for 2017–2018.

Gershom Sizomu, the spiritual leader of the Abayudaya and the Rosh Yeshiva, was enrolled in the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies five-year graduate program at the American Jewish University in Los Angeles, California where he studied Hebrew, rabbinic literature, the Bible, Jewish philosophy, and other subjects. Upon completion of this program, Sizomu received his ordination as a rabbi under the auspices of the Conservative movement on May 19, 2008, and returned to Uganda to lead its Jewish community. He is the first native-born black rabbi in sub-Saharan Africa. He is also the first chief rabbi of Uganda. In February 2016 he was elected as a Member of Parliament in Uganda representing Bungokho North outside of Mbale.

A new synagogue, Stern Synagogue, named after Ralph and Sue Stern, Jewish Americans who contributed $100,000, now has replaced the small Moses Synagogue on Nabugoye Hill as of 2017. Other key donors are Eyal, Yael, Leya and Aely Aronoff. Julius and Ray Charlstein Foundation. Naty and Debbie Saidoff. The synagogue is, according to Rabbi Sizomu, the biggest in sub-Saharan Africa.

Another development is the possible recognition of the Putti Abayudaya by Israel and the Orthodox Jewish world, thanks to the efforts of Rabbi Shlomo Riskin, founding Chief Rabbi of Efrat and Chancellor of the Ohr Torah Stone institute, in coordination with Putti Village Assistance Organization (PVAO). This plan received a setback in 2018 when the Israel Ministry of the Interior ruled that the Putti Abayudaya were not a recognised Jewish community and so their conversion is &quot;not recognized for the purpose of receiving status in Israel&quot;. The community is governed by an elected board, currently chaired by Tarphon Kamya. Putti village receives outside support from PVAO. 

== Institutions ==
Besides the five synagogues, Jewish schools have been established with outside help from individuals and organizations where secular and Jewish subjects are taught. Unlike many Christian-run schools, learning Hebrew and Judaism is merely optional for non-Jewish students. Christian, Muslim, and Jewish students attend these schools. Scholarships given by outside sources have enabled some students to attend Universities as well. The following are the currently existing community institutions:

* The Hadassah Primary School located between Nabugoye and Namanyonyi
* The Semei Kakungulu High School (Nabugoye Hill)
* Tikkun Olam Primary School (Namutumba)
* A Yeshiva (Nabugoye Hill) The building of the Yeshiva is being funded by a grant from the United Synagogue Youth Tikun Olam program
* A new Jewish Hospital (Kampala) Galilee Community General Hospital
* A new Jewish Orthodox synagogue Located right in the center of Kampala
* The Tobin Medical Centre located in Mbale funded by Be&#x27;chol Lashon

== Community relations ==

The Christian and Muslim neighbors once looked upon the Abayudaya with disdain and hatred, but relations have improved significantly and some view members of the Abayudaya with respect and admiration. It should also be noted that the community has been growing at a steady rate. Numbering only 300 individuals at the time of the fall of Idi Amin, the Abayudaya have grown to as many as 2,000 individuals since that time.

In 2002 the story of the Abayudaya was told in the book &quot;Abayudaya: The Jews of Uganda&quot;, with photographs and text by photojournalist Richard Sobol and musical recordings produced by Jeffrey Summit and published by Abbeville Press. Sobol has continued to travel and lecture with a multi media slide presentation to help bring the Ugandan Jews out of isolation.

In 2007 an independent production team, Marion Segal Productions, made a documentary film on the Abayudaya on behalf of the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC-TV). Its title, &quot;Pearls of Africa,&quot; is a reference to the fact that this region of Africa is also known as the pearl of Africa. The documentary was directed and narrated by filmmaker, Guy Lieberman, in association with producer Marion Segal, both South African Jews. Included in the documentary are interviews with Aaron Kintu Moses, J.J. Keki, Enosh K. Mainah, and other leaders of the Abayudaya, both in the Nabugoye Hill community and in the Putti community. It also includes interviews with two wives who show their Sabbath preparations, speak about their children&#x27;s education, and discuss the intimate side of Jewish marriage and the need for a mikveh. The documentary generated considerable interest amongst the South African Jewish community and inspired members to make financial and other contributions (e.g. books) to the Abayudaya. Subsequent to this documentary, the South African Jewish community also hosted two of the younger generation of Abayudaya to share their stories at local Jewish events.

In 2003, J.J. Keki, a member of the Abayudaya community, led the effort to create a cooperative for coffee-growers in the region, including not only the Jewish coffee-growers, but Christian and Muslim coffee-growers as well. The result was Mirembe Kawomera, Luganda for &quot;Delicious Peace&quot;. In partnership with Thanksgiving Coffee Company of Fort Bragg, California, the cooperative is working in bringing new prosperity to members of all religions.

==Religious life and customs==
As the community increased its ties and interactions with outside Jewish communities, namely in the United States and Israel, its religious ideology and customs shifted towards mainstream Judaism. Members attend Shabbat services regularly both on Friday evenings and Saturdays. Congregations remove their shoes before entering the synagogue. This custom is believed to have been practiced by Jews in biblical times and is still practiced by a few Jewish communities today. The Abayudaya follow kashrut and slaughter their own animals accordingly.

==Music==
Music has been an important aspect in the lives of the Abayudaya. In recent years, the community has produced two CDs that are centered on religious themes. One of the albums, entitled &quot;Abayudaya: Music from the Jewish people of Uganda&quot; was produced by Jeffrey Summit and nominated for a Best Traditional World Music album at the 47th Grammy Awards.

The Abayudaya community has received further recognition and respect within the Jewish community because of the work of Noam Katz, a Jewish American musician. His 2005 CD, &quot;Mirembe&quot; (&quot;peace&quot; in Luganda), featured the Abayudaya in the majority of its songs. In addition to studying at a seminary, Katz travels throughout North America, and he also gives a slideshow/concert which showcases the music of the Abayudaya.

The music of the Abayudaya is distinctly African and it is Jewish at the same time. Many of the songs combine Luganda words with Hebrew words. Additionally, Psalms and prayers are set to a distinctly African tune and rhythm. Music is considered important by the community for a variety of reasons. Some elders of the community have stated that it was music that enabled the community to persevere through the harsh conditions that it was forced to endure during the rule of Idi Amin.

<doc id="660289" wikidata="Q2745557" url="?curid=660289" title="Art Rooney">
<text>Arthur Joseph Rooney Sr. (January 27, 1901 – August 25, 1988), often referred to as &quot;the Chief&quot;, was an American professional football executive. He was the founding owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, an American football franchise in the National Football League (NFL), from 1933 until his death. Rooney is a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, was an Olympic qualifying boxer, and was part or whole owner in several track sport venues and Pittsburgh area pro teams. He was the first president of the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1933 to 1974, and the first chairman of the team from 1933 until his death in 1988. Art Rooney was 77 years old.

==Family history==
Rooney&#x27;s great-grandparents, James and Mary Rooney, were Irish Catholics who emigrated from Newry in County Down, Ireland to Canada during the Great Famine in the 1840s. While living in Montreal, the Rooneys had a son, Arthur (who would become Art Rooney&#x27;s grandfather). James and Mary later moved to Ebbw Vale, Wales, where the iron industry was flourishing, taking their son Arthur, then 21, with them. This Arthur Rooney married Catherine Regan (who was also Irish Catholic), in Wales, and they had a son, Dan. Two years after Dan Rooney was born, the family moved back to Canada and eventually ended up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1884. Along the way the family grew to include nine children of which Dan was the second.

Dan Rooney remained in the Pittsburgh area, and eventually opened a saloon in the Youghiogheny Valley coal town of Coulter, Pennsylvania (or Coultersville). This is where Dan Rooney met and wed Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Murray, who was the daughter of a coal miner, and where the couple&#x27;s first son, Arthur Joseph Rooney, was born. Dan and Maggie would eventually settle their family in Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Side in 1913, where they bought a three-story building at the corner of Corey Street and General Robinson Street. Dan operated a cafe and saloon out of the first floor with the family living above. The building was located just a block from Exposition Park, which had been home to the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team until 1909.

Rooney had a brother, Silas Rooney, who later entered the priesthood. Silas Rooney eventually became the athletic director for St. Bonaventure University in 1947 and invited the Steelers to play their training camp at the university in the 1950s. Another brother, James P. Rooney, later was elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly, winning easily in part because Art had renamed the team after James, who also played on the squad, as a promotional tactic.

==Education and athletics==

Rooney attended St. Peter&#x27;s Catholic School in Pittsburgh, Duquesne University Prep School, then several semesters at Indiana Normal School before completing a final year at Temple University on an athletic scholarship. He was awarded for his athleticism at Indiana (now the Indiana University of Pennsylvania) by being posthumously inducted into the IUP athletic Hall of Fame in 1997. He spent his time there participating on both the basketball and football teams while also playing centerfielder for the Crimson Hawks baseball team. 

After his high school graduation in 1919, he dedicated himself to sports. Initially, Rooney became an accomplished boxer, winning the AAU welterweight belt in 1918 and tried out for the 1920 Olympic Team, 

He played minor league baseball for both the Flint, Michigan &quot;Vehicles&quot; and the Wheeling, West Virginia &quot;Stogies&quot;. In 1925 he served as Wheeling&#x27;s player-manager and led the Middle Atlantic League in games, hits, runs, stolen bases and finished second in batting average (his brother Dan Rooney, Wheeling&#x27;s catcher that year, finished third). 

Rooney also played the halfback position for the semi-pro Pittsburgh &quot;Hope Harvey&quot; and &quot;Majestic Radio&quot; clubs, the former of which he later took over and renamed the J.P. Rooneys before purchasing an NFL franchise for $2,500 in 1933 following the repeal of Pennsylvania&#x27;s blue laws. During this time, Rooney served as the team&#x27;s general manager, head coach and owner. His team played games at the former Exposition Park on the Northside.

==Pittsburgh Steelers==
Rooney&#x27;s affiliation with the National Football League (NFL) began in 1933 when he paid a $2,500 franchise fee to found a club based in the city of Pittsburgh. He named his new team the &quot;Pirates&quot;, after the city&#x27;s baseball team, of which Rooney was a fan since childhood.

Since the league&#x27;s inception in 1920, the NFL had wanted a team in Pittsburgh due to the city&#x27;s already-long history with football as well as the popularity of the Pittsburgh Panthers football team, an NCAA national championship contender during this period. The league was finally able to take advantage of Pennsylvania relaxing their blue laws that prior to 1933 prohibited sporting events from taking place on Sundays, when most NFL games take place.
In 1936, Rooney won a parlay at Saratoga Race Course, which netted him about $160,000. He placed the bet based on a tip from New York Giants owner Tim Mara, a bookmaker. He used the winnings to hire a coach, Joe Bach, give contracts to his players and almost win a championship. The winnings funded the team until 1941 when he sold the franchise to NY playboy Alex Thompson. Thompson wanted to move the franchise to Boston so he could be within a five-hour train ride of his club. At the same time, the Philadelphia Eagles ran into financial problems. Rooney used the funds from the sale of franchise to get a 70% interest in the Eagles, the other 30% held by Rooney friend and future NFL commissioner, Bert Bell. Bell and Rooney agreed to trade places with Thompson. Bell took the role of President of the Steelers that he relinquished to Rooney in 1946 when Bell became Commissioner. Rooney got his good friend and his sister&#x27;s father in law, Barney McGinley, to buy Bell&#x27;s shares. Barney&#x27;s son Jack, Art&#x27;s brother in law, retained the McGinley interest that passed to his heirs when he died in 2006.

Rooney sent shock waves through the NFL by signing Byron &quot;Whizzer&quot; White to a record-breaking $15,000 contract in 1938. This move, however, did not bring the Pirates a winning season, and White left the team for the Detroit Lions the following year. The club did not have a season above .500 until 1942, the year after they were renamed the Pittsburgh Steelers.

During World War II, the Steelers had some financial difficulties and were merged with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1943 and the Chicago Cardinals in 1944.

After the war, Rooney became team president. He longed to bring an NFL title to Pittsburgh but was never able to beat the powerhouse teams, like the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay Packers. The Steelers also struggled with playing in a city and era where baseball was king and were treated as something of a joke compared to the Pirates. The team also made some questionable personnel calls at the time such as cutting a then-unknown Johnny Unitas in training camp (Unitas would go on to a Hall of Fame career with the Baltimore Colts) and trading their first round pick in the 1965 draft to the Chicago Bears (who would draft Dick Butkus with the pick), among others.

Nevertheless, Rooney was popular with owners as a mediator, which would carry over to his son Dan Rooney. He was the only owner to vote against moving the rights of the New York Yanks to Dallas, Texas after the 1951 season due to concerns of racism in the South at the time. (Ultimately, the Dallas Texans failed after one year, and the rights were moved to Baltimore, where the team became the Baltimore Colts. The team now plays in Indianapolis.) In 1963, along with Bears owner George Halas, Rooney was one of two owners to vote for the 1925 NFL Championship to be reinstated to the long-defunct Pottsville Maroons.

==Pittsburgh Penguins==
As a pillar of the community in many aspects, Rooney was asked to lend his considerable influence in the city&#x27;s bid to reclaim an NHL franchise during the league&#x27;s expansion in 1967. Although Pittsburgh enjoyed championship hockey with the professional but &quot;minor league&quot; Pittsburgh Hornets since its NHL franchise (the Pirates hockey team) disbanded in 1930 from the effects of the Great Depression, many city leaders were pushing for the region to become more &quot;major league&quot; suggesting that Mr. Rooney use his influence in the sports industry to have the league award Pittsburgh a franchise. Rooney proved his worth and from 1967 until the early 1970s was a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins.

==Homestead Grays==
In a 1981 interview by the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; Rooney related that &quot;from time to time he had helped financially support the Negro league team, the Homestead Grays, and . . . was a better baseball fan than football fan.&quot;

==Track sports==
Rooney also acquired the Yonkers Raceway in 1972, the Palm Beach Kennel Club, Green Mountain Kennel Club in Vermont, Shamrock Stables in Maryland and owned the Liberty Bell Park Racetrack outside Philadelphia.

==Later life==
Following the AFL–NFL merger in 1970, the Steelers agreed to leave the NFL Eastern Conference and joined the AFC Central Division.

Through expert scouting, the Steelers became a power. In 1972, they began a remarkable 8–year run of playoff appearances, and 13 straight years of winning seasons, including three additional playoff berths. In Rooney&#x27;s 41st season as owner, the club won the Super Bowl. During Rooney&#x27;s lifetime the team also had Super Bowl victories following the 1975, 1978 and 1979 seasons. They also won the Super Bowl in the 2005 and 2008 seasons, making the Steelers the first-team following the AFL–NFL merger to win six Super Bowls.

Following the Steelers&#x27; victory in Super Bowl IX, Rooney stepped down from day-to-day management of the team, but remained the ultimate source of authority until his death. Dan, his son, took over as team president. Rooney died of complications from a stroke on August 25, 1988, at the age of 87. An August 1987 &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; story stated that Rooney never missed a Hall of Fame induction ceremony in all 25 years, and that he was asked to present his third inductee, John Henry Johnson, that month. In memory of &quot;The Chief,&quot; Steelers wore a patch on the left shoulder of their uniforms with Rooney&#x27;s initials AJR for the entire season. The team ended up finishing 5-11, their worst record since a 1–13 showing in 1969. He is buried at the North Side Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

==Legacy==
In 1964, he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Duquesne University named their football field in his honor in 1993. In 1999 Rooney ranked 81st on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; &quot;100 Most Powerful Sports Figures of the 20th Century&quot; list. A statue of his likeness graces the entrance to the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Heinz Field. The street that runs adjacent to Heinz Field on Pittsburgh&#x27;s North Side is named &quot;Art Rooney Avenue&quot; in his honor. In 2000, he was inducted as a &quot;pioneer&quot; into the American Football Association&#x27;s Semi-Pro Football Hall of Fame.

During Rooney&#x27;s life, the Steelers would often use a late-round draft pick on a player from a local college like Pitt, West Virginia or Penn State. Though these players rarely made the team, this practice was intended to appeal to local fans and players.


Art Rooney is the subject of, and the only character in, the one-man play &quot;The Chief&quot;, written by Gene Collier and Rob Zellers.

Arthur J. Rooney was married to Kathleen Rooney née McNulty (1904–1982) for 51 years, until her 1982 death. Kathleen was the mother of Art&#x27;s five sons, who are Dan Rooney, the chairman of the board of directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers and a former United States Ambassador to Ireland, Art Rooney Jr., Timothy Rooney, Patrick Rooney, and John Rooney (all also directors of the Pittsburgh Steelers). She is also the grandmother of the couple&#x27;s 32 grandchildren, including current Steelers president Art Rooney II and U.S. Representative Thomas J. Rooney (R, FL-16). The couple also has about 75 great-grandchildren, including actress sisters Kate Mara and Rooney Mara.

<text>The Special Task Force (STF) (Sinhala: ; Tamil: ) is the tier one police tactical unit of the Sri Lanka Police specialising in anti-irregular military, apprehension of armed and dangerous criminals, clandestine and covert operations, combat and patrolling in urban areas, counterterrorism and hostage rescue crisis managements, crowd control, executive protection, high-risk tactical law enforcement situations, indirect fire for support operations, irregular warfare, operating in difficult to access terrain, protecting high-level meeting areas, search and rescue people who are in distress or imminent danger from disaster, support crowd control and riot control, tactical special operations, and other tasks requiring special training. It was formed in 1983 not as a military force, but rather as a highly specialised armed police unit.

== Function ==

The STF is spearhead primarily involve anti-irregular military, counterinsurgency, counterterrorism and hostage rescue crisis managements, executive protection, high-risk tactical law enforcement situations, operating in difficult to access and extremely dangerous areas, protecting high-level meeting areas, serving high-risk arrest and search warrants, and special operations that are extremely high-risk and dangerous – as the most highly trained police organisation in Sri Lanka – it would be the lead unit whenever law enforcement forces engaged the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The STF is mostly stationed in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka where the LTTE was wiped out. Some small number of units are placed in Mannar District and Vavuniya District.

Other units are based in Colombo and provide VIP security. The STF is internationally recognised for its expertise in these areas and it is often invited to assist foreign law enforcement agencies with planning major events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics and in dealing with possible terrorist threats.

== Formation ==
When the Special Task Force (STF) was formed in 1983, it comprised mainly existing policemen. It was headed by the 1960 Rome Olympian and existing Senior Superintendent of Police, Dharmasiri Weerakoon. The STF were trained by the Sri Lanka Army (SLA) in the handling of small arms and light weapons and were given basic training in jungle warfare and small unit tactics.

They deeply resemble a paramilitary organisation and later separate training facilities for the STF have been established in Kalutara, south of Colombo. The first platoons formed were deployed in the North of Sri Lanka to provide additional support for police stations and to stem the LTTE separatists.

The STF was enhanced considerably in 1983 when former British Army Special Air Service (SAS) crack teams were brought in to provide specialised training in all aspects of counterinsurgency, counterterrorism and hostage rescue crisis managements, and executive protection. The SAS experts trained the STF troops at Katukurunda wing of the Police College, after making the training school into a sophisticated training complex. Further training was provided with assistance of Keenie Meenie Services in 1984.

Later, the STF experts took over from the SAS in 1988. Today the STF has a fully-fledged training wing, regarded as one of the best in South East Asia. 11 August 1984, that the Israel Security Agency Shin Beth was involved in the training of the Sri Lankan armed forces. Many officers belonging to Israel were also involved in the training of the Sri Lankan soldiers in Colombo.

In 2008, the STF received P2 APCs from Indonesia made by Sentra Surya Ekajaya to help the unit conduct their counterinsurgency operations against the LTTE.

== Operations ==
By 1987, heavily involved in the Sri Lankan civil war, the STF was in control of the area from Kiran to Potuvil in the Batticaloa District. The STF was deployed in Company formation into 15 separate camps. When the Indian Peace Keeping Force was moved into the Batticaloa in 1987 as part of the ongoing peace process, the STF was in complete control of Batticoloa, and had restored a level of normalcy to the area. From 1983 to 1987 when the STF was in control over Batticoloa not a single STF camp had come under attack from the LTTE.

In 2019 STF involved in 2019 Kalmunai shootout.

=== Operation Niyathai Jaya (Definite Victory) ===

In its first major operation since the signing of the ceasefire agreement in 2002, Special Task Force troops launched a limited offensive named &quot;Definite Victory&quot; (In Sinhala: ) on January 4, 2007 against LTTE rebels in the Kanchikudichcharu and Thoppigala south regions of the Ampara District, as a reaction to the child abductions in Bakmitiyawa, Ampara and abduction of two teachers and 23 Tamil children in December 2006 while they were returning from extra classes to their homes.

As a result of this offensive, the elite police commandos were able to overrun more than fifteen (15) rebel camps including the Stanly Base, which was the main LTTE camp in the Ampara District and a regional intelligence and supply camp of the LTTE, Bagayadi Base, where local and foreign foodstuffs and sanitary material was stored, Janak Base, which made clothing identical to Sri Lanka Army and Special Task Force uniforms, Jeewan Base, which was another supply camp from which the STF was able to recover four vehicles and the Diana Base where LTTE leaders meet. This camp was furnished with luxury items which were denied to the ordinary LTTE cadres.

After the fall of Stanly Base, STF troops were able to find an explosive laden truck and a motor cycle that the rebels were planning to use to carry out suicide attacks in the capital of Colombo. And it is also reported that LTTE was housing a large number of child soldiers conscripted by them in this camp. Other than that, STF troops were able to recover a large quantity of arms and ammunition, coffins, large number of anti-personnel mines, vehicles
, satellite and radio receivers, global positioning systems, power generators, boats with name and logo of the Non Governmental Organization &quot;Save the Children&quot;, tents with the logo of &quot;UNHCR&quot; and a fully equipped hospital donated to the militants by a Dutch INGO named ZOA Refugee Care This NGO donated hospital is named by the tigers as Thileepan memorial hospital. STF also said that they also found a water tanker truck donated by, the Tamil Rehabilitation Organization (TRO) which is a front organisation of the LTTE, who collect funds especially in the United States and Canada purportedly for civilians, but actually for the militant group. However, aid workers argue that the supplies must have been taken after they evacuated their office due to heavy fighting. Jeevan Thiagarajah, the head of the Consortium for Humanitarian Agencies, has stated that the matter is simply a misunderstanding.

As a result of this mission STF troops able to kill four rebels and the STF commented that the militants were fleeing from the area without retaliating against their troops.

== Criticism ==

The Special Task Force has been accused of various human rights abuses including extrajudicial killings and involvement in the disappearance of individuals.

* According to a United Nations commissioned study conducted in 1997, the STF was the arresting agency in 5% of the 1219 reported cases of disappearances in the Batticaloa district in North Eastern Province between 1988 and 1996.
* Additionally, after a visit to Sri Lanka from 24 August to 5 September in the same year, UN Special Rapporteur Bacre Waly Ndiaye reported the existence of allegations that individuals had died &quot;while in the custody of the Special Task Force of Sri Lanka in Colombo&quot;.
* At least two incidents of extrajudicial killings involving members of the STF have also been noted by the Sri Lankan government or outside observers. Following the newest round of fighting between the government and the LTTE starting in April 1994, the mutilated bodies of between 21 and 31 Tamil males were discovered in rivers and lakes near Colombo. 
* On 17 August ten STF officers (and fifteen others) were charged with committing the murders, which allegedly took place at the STF headquarters in Colombo. In addition, at least 17 extrajudicial killings were carried out by Sri Lankan security forces (including the STF) in Eastern Province in retaliation for LTTE attacks. Human rights monitors determined the deceased to be civilians, but security forces maintained that they were LTTE members.

<text>Saint-Quentin (; ; ) is a city in the Aisne department, Hauts-de-France, northern France. It has been identified as the &quot;Augusta Veromanduorum&quot; of antiquity. It is named after Saint Quentin of Amiens, who is said to have been martyred there in the 3rd century.

==Administration==
Saint-Quentin is a sub-prefecture of Aisne. Although Saint-Quentin is by far the largest city in Aisne, the capital is the third-largest city, Laon.

==Mayors==
The mayor of Saint-Quentin is Frédérique Macarez, a member of the centre-right LR Party.

==History==
The city was founded by the Romans, in the Augustean period, to replace the &quot;oppidum&quot; of Vermand (11 km away) as the capital of &quot;Viromandui&quot; (Celtic Belgian people who occupied the region). It received the name &quot;Augusta Viromanduorum&quot;, &quot;Augusta&quot; of the &quot;Viromandui&quot;, in honor of the emperor Augustus. The site is that of a ford across the River Somme. During the late Roman period, it is possible that the civitas capital was transferred back to Vermand (whose name comes from &quot;Veromandis&quot;); almost nothing relating to the fourth century has been found in Saint-Quentin.

During the early Middle Ages, a major monastery, now the Basilica of Saint-Quentin, developed, based on pilgrimage to the tomb of Quentin, a Roman Christian who came to evangelize the region and was martyred in Augusta, giving rise to a new town which was named after him.

From the 9th century, Saint-Quentin was the capital of Vermandois County. From the 10th century, the counts of Vermandois (descendants of the Carolingian, then Capetian families) were very powerful. The city grew rapidly: the &quot;bourgeois&quot; organized themselves and obtained, in the second half of the 12th century (a very early date), a municipal charter, which guaranteed their commune a large degree of autonomy.

At the beginning of the 13th century, Saint-Quentin entered the royal domain. At that time, it was a thriving city, based on its wool textile industry (city &quot;drapante&quot;). It was also a centre of commerce boosted by its position on the border of the kingdom of France, between the Champagne fairs and the cities of Flanders (wine exportation, etc.): it had an important annual fair. It also benefited from its location in the heart of a rich agricultural region (trade of grain and &quot;guède&quot; (woad), a high-value blue dye).

From the 14th century, Saint-Quentin suffered from this strategic position: it endured the French-English wars (Hundred Years&#x27; War). In the 15th century, the city was disputed between the king of France and the dukes of Burgundy (it is one of the &quot;cities of the Somme&quot;). Ravaged by the plague on several occasions, its population decreased, while its economy was in crisis: its fair was increasingly irrelevant, and agricultural production diminished. The declining textile industry turned to the production of linen canvas. Meanwhile, the city faced major expenses to maintain its fortifications and armed troops.

Between the end of the 15th century and the mid-17th century, this strategic position was the cause of frequent misfortune. In 1557, a siege by the Spanish army (as part of the battle of Saint-Quentin) ended with the looting of the city and its desertion for two years. Given back to France in 1559, it underwent intense fortification work: the medieval wall, redesigned several times, was protected by many new advanced fortifications. Two districts were razed to make way for them. In the mid-17th century, the city escaped the sieges, but suffered the horrors of wars ravaging the Picardy region, accompanied by the plague (in 1636, 3,000 people died, out of perhaps 10,000 inhabitants) and famine.

In the second half of the 17th century, the conquests of Louis XIV moved the border away from Saint- Quentin, and it lost much of its strategic role. At the end of the 16th century, its textile production specialized in fine flax canvas (&quot;batiste&quot; and lawn). This brought prosperity, particularly in the 18th century, when these textiles were exported across Europe and the Americas.

During the First French Empire, difficulties in the export market brought economic decline. At the request of the municipality, Napoleon ordered the razing of the fortifications, to allow the city to grow beyond its old boundaries. In 1814-1815, Saint-Quentin was occupied by the Russian army, but without any damage.

In the 19th century, Saint-Quentin developed into a thriving industrial city, thanks to entrepreneurs constantly on the lookout for new technologies. Textiles and mechanical devices were foremost among a wide variety of products.

In 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, the population repelled the Prussians on 8 October, but the city fell during the second offensive. The hopeless but heroic action had national repercussions: Saint-Quentin was decorated with the Legion of Honour. On 19 January 1871 the French army was defeated near the town.
The First World War hit Saint-Quentin very hard. In September 1914, the city was overrun; it endured a harsh occupation. From 1916, it lay at the heart of the war zone, because the Germans had integrated it into the Hindenburg Line. After the evacuation of the population in March, the town was systematically looted and industrial equipment removed or destroyed. The fighting destroyed it: 80% of buildings (including the Basilica of Saint-Quentin) were damaged.

Despite national support, the reconstruction process was long, and the city struggled to regain its pre-1914 dynamism. The 1911 population of 55,000 was achieved again only in the mid-1950s, in the context of general economic expansion. This prosperity continued until the mid-1970s, when the French textile industry began to suffer through competition from developing countries.

== French sartorial heritage ==
The city was a pivotal centre of mulquinerie.

== Incidents ==
On 30 March 2013 five children between the ages of two and ten, were killed in a house fire in the city.

Their parents had recently separated and their father was hosting the children at his new home for the first time for the weekend, as they had been spending most of their time with their mother. At 10:30pm local time on 30 March the fire started via an unknown cause. The children&#x27;s father, alongside neighbours, made desperate attempts to save the children, but by the time the emergency services arrived, it was too late. The building was considered &quot;too dangerous to enter&quot; and the bodies of the five children were discovered once the fire was extinguished.

The children&#x27;s father was seriously burned in a failed attempt to save his children&#x27;s lives and jumped through a window to safety. He was hospitalised and wasn&#x27;t informed until later on Sunday that his children had died.

<doc id="660305" wikidata="Q6570181" url="?curid=660305" title="List of English words of Hawaiian origin">
<text>The [[Hawaiian language]] has offered a number of words to the English language. Some Hawaiian words are known to non-Hawaiian speakers, and a few have also been assimilated into the English language (e.g. &quot;aloha&quot;, meaning &quot;hello&quot;, &quot;love&quot;, or &quot;goodbye&quot;, or &quot;mahalo&quot;, meaning &quot;thank you&quot;). English also borrows some Hawaiian words (e.g. &quot;ukulele&quot;, &quot;mahimahi&quot;, and &quot;muʻumuʻu&quot;). Hawaiian vocabulary often overlaps with other Polynesian languages, such as Tahitian, so it is not always clear which of those languages a term is borrowed from.

The Hawaiian orthography is notably different from the English orthography because there is a special letter in the Hawaiian alphabet, the ʻokina. The ʻokina represents a glottal stop, which indicates a short pause to separate syllables. The kahakō represents longer vowel sounds. Both the okina and kahakō are often omitted in English orthography.

Due to the Hawaiian orthography&#x27;s difference from English orthography, the pronunciation of the words differ. For example, the &quot;muʻumuʻu&quot;, traditionally a Hawaiian dress, is pronounced by many mainland (colloquial term for the Continental U.S.) residents. However, many Hawaii residents have learned that the ʻokina in Hawaiian signifies a glottal stop. Thus, in the Hawaiian language, &quot;muʻumuʻu&quot; is pronounced , approximately . The pronunciations listed here are how it would sound in Hawaiian orthography.

<doc id="660310" wikidata="Q1882835" url="?curid=660310" title="Macintosh Performa">
<text>The Macintosh Performa is a family of personal computers designed, manufactured and sold by Apple Computer, Inc. from 1992 to 1997. The Performa brand re-used models from Apple&#x27;s Quadra, Centris, LC, Classic, and Power Macintosh families with model numbers that denoted included software packages or hard drive sizes. Whereas non-Performa Macintosh computers were sold by Apple Authorized Resellers, the Performa was sold through big-box stores and mass-market retailers such as Good Guys, Circuit City, and Sears.

The initial series of models consisted of the Macintosh Classic II-based Performa 200, the LC II-based Performa 400, and the IIvi-based Performa 600. After releasing a total of sixty-four different models, Apple retired the Performa brand in early 1997, shortly after release of the Power Macintosh 5500, 6500, 8600 and 9600, as well as the return of Steve Jobs to the company. The Performa brand&#x27;s lifespan coincided with a period of significant financial turmoil at Apple due in part to low sales of Performa machines.

== Overview ==
With a strong education market share throughout the 1980s, Apple wanted to push its computers into the home, with the idea that a child would experience the same Macintosh computer both in the home and at school, and later grow to use Macintosh computers at work. In the early 1990s, Apple sold computers through a chain of authorized resellers, and through mail order catalogs such as those found in the latter third of MacWorld Magazine. A typical reseller sold Macintosh computers to professionals, who purchased high-level applications and required performance and expansion capabilities. Consumers, however, purchased computers based on the best value, and weren&#x27;t as concerned about expansion or performance. To reach these customers, Apple wanted to sell their computers through department store chains (such as Sears), but this would conflict with existing authorized reseller agreements, in which a geographic area had only one reseller.

To prevent these conflicts, Apple split the Macintosh line into professional and consumer models. The professional line included the Classic, LC, Centris, Quadra, and Power Macintosh lines, and continued to be sold as-is (i.e., no consumer software bundles or limited features). The consumer line was given the name &quot;Performa&quot;, and included computers similar to the professional line. Early Performa models were not sold with the &quot;Macintosh&quot; brand in order to get around the authorized reseller agreements.

The Performa line was marketed differently from the professional line. To satisfy consumer-level budgets, the computers were sold bundled with home and small business applications. Most models were also bundled with a keyboard, mouse, an external modem and either a dot-29 or dot-39 pitch shadow mask CRT monitor. Professional models, in contrast, were sold &quot;à la carte&quot; with keyboard and mouse bundles chosen by the dealer or sold separately; monitors sold with high-end Macintosh models typically used Trinitron tubes based on aperture grille technology.

While the Performa models resembled their professional counterpart on the system software and hardware level, certain features were tweaked or removed. The Performa 600, for instance, lacked the level-2 cache of the Macintosh IIvx it was based on.

Unlike the professional Macintosh lines, each individual Performa bundle was given a unique model number, in some cases varying only by the software bundle or the specific retailer that sold that model. This was intended to accommodate retailers, who could advertise that they could beat their competitors&#x27; price on equivalent models while at the same time ensuring that they did not actually carry the same models as their competitors. To help consumers choose between the options available to them, Apple created multiple paid advertisements including &quot;The Martinettis Bring Home a Computer&quot;, a thirty-minute &quot;storymercial&quot; about a fictional family that purchases a Performa computer that aired in December 1994.

Apple&#x27;s strategy for selling Performa machines in department and electronics retail stores did not include the sort of specialized training Apple offered to its dealers. This resulted in situations where Performa display models were often poorly taken care of; the demo computers crashed, the self-running demo software not running or the display models not even powered on. Apple tried to address the training issue by hiring their own sales people to aid the store sales staff, most of them recruited from Macintosh user groups. Despite this, however, many returned Performa computers could not be serviced properly because the stores were not authorized Apple service centers.

The problem was compounded by retailers favoring Microsoft Windows, especially after the introduction of Windows 95. Computers running Windows were generally cheaper, and encouraged by manufacturer spiffs, advertising co-ops, and other promotion programs. In addition, many stores preferred to sell their own branded white box PCs, something Apple would not allow.

As a consequence of these issues, Apple overestimated demand for Performa machines in 1995 while also underestimating demand for high-end Power Macintosh models, leading to significant oversupply issues. Introduction of new Performa models slowed as a result: whereas Apple had introduced 20 different Performa models around the world from May to December 1995, the number dropped to four in the first seven months of 1996.

For the late-1996 holiday period, sales of Performa-branded machines had dropped year-over-year by 15 percent, reflective of a company-wide drop in fourth-quarter revenues by one-third compared with 1995.

In February 1997, just days after Steve Jobs returned to the company, Apple refreshed its entire line of desktop computers, retiring a dozen Performa models based on the Power Macintosh 6200 and 6400 with no replacement, and reducing the range of Power Macintosh to six computers (plus a few Apple Workgroup Server variants). The official end of the Performa brand was announced on March 15 as part of sweeping changes at the company that included layoffs of a third of the company&#x27;s workforce and the cancellation of several software products. By early 1998, Apple&#x27;s lineup was reduced to four computers: One desktop, one all-in-one, and two minitowers (one of which was sold as a server product). As part of the restructuring of how Apple sold its computers in retail channels, it partnered with CompUSA to implement a &quot;Store within a store&quot; concept. Apple and related products were displayed and sold in a physically separate location by specialized employees (currently done at select Best Buy stores).

== Performa-specific software ==

The Performa versions of the Macintosh System software introduced some features that were not available on non-Performa Macintoshes. The most notable of these are At Ease (parental controls), the Launcher (an application launcher similar to the macOS Dock), and the Performa Control Panel, which included several unique configuration options. The functionality of all three components were eventually folded into the operating system itself. Versions of System 7 with the additional software had a &#x27;P&#x27; appended to the end, such as 7.1.2P which was included with the Performa 630 in mid-1994.

Software bundles usually included ClarisWorks, Quicken, a calendar/contact manager such as Touchbase and Datebook Pro, America Online, eWorld, educational software such as &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary&quot;, &quot;The New Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;The TIME Almanac&quot; (on models equipped with a CD-ROM drive), &quot;Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing&quot;, or Mario Teaches Typing, and a selection of games such as &quot;Spectre Challenger&quot;, &quot;Diamonds&quot;, &quot;Lemmings&quot;, and &quot;Monopoly&quot;. Another software package that only the Performa was equipped with was called MegaPhone, a screen-based telephony (SBT) application developed by Cypress Research.

<text>The Fairchild PT-19 (company designation Fairchild M62) is an American monoplane primary trainer aircraft that served with the United States Army Air Forces, RAF and RCAF during World War II. Designed by Fairchild Aircraft, it was a contemporary of the Kaydet biplane trainer, and was used by the USAAF during Primary Flying Training. As with other USAAF trainers of the period, the PT-19 had multiple designations based on the powerplant installed.

==Design and development==
According to H.L. Puckett, &quot;Still U.S. pilots were receiving their primary flight training in biplanes, although the low wing advance trainer was in use. A look around showed that there was no low wing primary trainer being produced in the U.A. Fairchild felt this urgency and set his organization at work on such a low wing trainer with the proposal that the new proven Ranger be used as the power plant for the new airplane to be known as the M-62. The M-62, which was to become the PT-19, was to use the experience gained from the F-24 and the more recent Model 46.&quot;

In 1933, Fairchild Aircraft Corporation&#x27;s chief engineer, A.A. Gassner, had hired Armand Thiebolt, as his chief structural engineer. In 1937, Thiebolt was named chief engineer, and given the task of designing the PT-19. Included in the design was the use of interchangeable parts and non-strategic materials. According to Puckett, &quot;The proposed low wing design adapted itself readily to a wide tread landing gear, which when combined with judicious wheel location and a low center of gravity, provided protection against ground looping.&quot; The Ranger engine would also result in a narrower cowling compared to those using a radial engine, which meant increased visibility for the pilot. The reduced cowling also improved propeller efficiency and an increase in horsepower.

The cantilever wings, with wooden ribs, were covered by 3/32 inch preformed mahogany or fir plywood. The inboard portion consisted of a welded trussed 4130 structure. The fuselage used Chromoly square tubing for the longerons and brace members, and fabric covered. The cowling was made of Alclad. Both wing center sections contained the fuel tank, with landing gear housings on the outboard ends. The oleo struts were designed to withstand a 6 &quot;g&quot; acceleration from a drop. Two hollow box wood spars were used in the wing and center sections. Duramold was used to cover the wings. Early models used aluminum alloy seats made by the Budd Company, while later models used plywood seats made by Hughes Aircraft Company. Early models had metal floors and flaps, while later models used wood for both. The vertical and horizontal stabilizers were made of spruce spars, covered with plywood. According to Puckett, &quot;Moisture became the arch enemy of the Fairchild PT and was responsible for the relatively small survival rate of the airplanes built.&quot;


On 15 May 1939, the M-62 prototype first flew. In a fly-off competition at Wright Field, the aircraft beat out 17 other designs. On 22 September 1939, the Army placed an order for 270 airplanes. Fairchild had to include 27 wood working subcontractors, including furniture stores, a hosiery plant and a foundry. After the start of WWII, Fairchild licensed manufacturing with Fleet Aircraft, Howard Aircraft Corporation, St. Louis Aircraft Corporation, and Aeronca.

The original production batch of 275 were powered by the inline 175 hp Ranger L-440-1 engine and designated the PT-19. In 1941, mass production began and 3,181 of the PT-19A model, powered by the 200 hp L-440-3, were made by Fairchild. An additional 477 were built by Aeronca and 44 by the St. Louis Aircraft Corporation. The PT-19B, of which 917 were built, was equipped for instrument flight training by attaching a collapsible hood to the front cockpit.

When airplane production exceeded engine production, the PT-23 was prototyped by Fairchild. Except for the engine, the airplane was identical from the firewall rearwards. According to Puckett, &quot;The second protype PT-23 was the only one of these airplanes which was painted Air Corps blue and yellow.&quot; The PT-23 was powered by the 220 hp Continental R-670 radial powerplant. A total of 869 PT-23s were built as well as 256 of the PT-23A, which was the instrument flight-equipped version. The PT-23 was manufactured in the US by Fairchild, Aeronca, St. Louis Aircraft Corporation and Howard Aircraft Corporation and in Canada by Fleet Aircraft Corporation as well as Fabrica do Galeao in Brazil (220 or 232 between 1944 and 1948).

During 1943, USAAF Training Command received a number of complaints about durability issues with the plywood wings of the PT-19 and the PT-23 when exposed to the high heat and/or humidity of training bases located in Texas and Florida. Maintenance officers at the USAAF overhaul depots had been forced to order replacement of the wooden wing sections after only two to three months&#x27; active service because of wood rot and ply separation issues. Subsequent to this incident, the USAAF incorporated a demand for all-metal wing sections on all future fixed-wing training aircraft.

The final variant was the PT-26 which used the L-440-7 engine. The Canadian-built versions of these were designated the Cornell for use by the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan which was centered in Canada.

==Operational history==
Compared to the earlier biplane trainers, the Fairchild PT-19 provided a more advanced type of aircraft. Speeds were higher and wing loading more closely approximated that of combat aircraft, with flight characteristics demanding more precision and care. Its virtues were that it was inexpensive, simple to maintain and, most of all, virtually viceless.

These planes were delivered to various bases all over the country by WASPs (Women&#x27;s Airforce Service Pilots) between 1942-1944.

Thousands of the PT-19 series were rapidly integrated into the United States and Commonwealth training programs, serving throughout World War II and beyond. Even after their retirement in the late 1940s, a substantial number found their way onto the United States and other civil registers, being flown by private pilot owners.

<text>Tickell&#x27;s blue flycatcher (Cyornis tickelliae) is a small passerine bird in the flycatcher family. This is an insectivorous species which breeds in tropical Asia, from the Indian Subcontinent eastwards to Bangladesh and western Myanmar. The Indochinese blue flycatcher was formerly considered conspecific. They are blue on the upperparts and the throat and breast are rufous. They are found in dense scrub to forest habitats. The name commemorates the wife of the British ornithologist Samuel Tickell who collected in India and Burma.

==Description==

Tickell&#x27;s blue flycatcher is about 11–12 cm long. It sits upright and forages mainly in the overgrowth. The male&#x27;s upper parts are bright blue, its throat and breast are red, and the rest of the underparts are white. The female is duller blue with a brighter blue brow, shoulder, rump, and tail. It hybridizes with the pale-chinned blue flycatcher (&quot;Cyornis poliogenys&quot;) in the Eastern Ghats of India and these hybrids have sometimes been treated as a subspecies &quot;vernayi&quot;. The juvenile is streaked and has a spotted mantle, scaly brown upperparts, head and breast, with just the wings and tail being blue.

They have sometimes been known to feed even after dusk. Apart from flying insects they may occasionally pick up crawling insects.

The species shows regional variations in plumage and size and several of these populations have been designated with subspecies names. The nominate form is found in India, Nepal and Myanmar. The Sri Lankan population is separated as &quot;jerdoni&quot; (or &quot;nesea&quot;/&quot;mesaea&quot; said to be darker) The Sri Lankan population is &quot;C. t. jerdoni&quot; which has a longer bill. &quot;C. t. indochina&quot; extends in range from Myanmar, through Thailand into Cambodia and Vietnam. Southern Thailand, peninsular Malaysia and northeast Sumatra has the population &quot;C. t. sumatrensis&quot; while &quot;lamprus&quot; is an insular population on Anamba Island. In the past this species has been considered as a subspecies of the blue-throated blue flycatcher (&quot;Cyornis rubeculoides&quot;) which resembles this but has a blue throat.

==Habitat and distribution==
Tickell&#x27;s blue flycatcher breeds in dry forest, scrub, bamboo and gardens.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The metallic song of the bird includes a series of clicks followed by five or six notes that end abruptly. The metallic song consists of short clicks followed by five or six notes resembling that of the Spot-breasted fantail. Alarm calls include &quot;churr&quot; and clicking notes. It is a wary bird and is easily observed in small gardens too. It is a forest-loving species which is found in thick cover and shade, and particularly haunts the banks of wooded streams.

They feed mainly by capturing insects in flight but their prey include other insects such as termites and earwigs that may be gleaned or picked from the ground. Now they are being observed inhabiting garbage places. During the breeding season, they may take larger prey including small vertebrates. A bush frog has been reported as prey in Sri Lanka.
The breeding season is April to August (March to June in Sri Lanka). It nests in a hole in a tree or amongst rocks that is lined with fine grass and fibres and lay 3–5 eggs.

<text>Bruce Patrick McNall (born April 17, 1950) is an American former Thoroughbred racehorse owner, sports executive, and convicted felon who once owned the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League (CFL).

McNall claimed to have made his initial fortune as a coin collector, though Metropolitan Museum of Art director Thomas Hoving claimed he smuggled art antiquities as the partner of Robert E. Hecht. In the 1980s McNall produced several Hollywood movies, including &quot;The Manhattan Project&quot; and &quot;Weekend at Bernie&#x27;s&quot;.

McNall bought a 25 percent stake in the Kings from Jerry Buss in 1986, and bought an additional 24 percent in 1987 to become the team&#x27;s largest shareholder. He was named team president that September, and purchased Buss&#x27;s remaining shares in March 1988. He then shocked the sports world on August 9, 1988, when he acquired the NHL&#x27;s biggest star, Wayne Gretzky, along with Marty McSorley and Mike Krushelnyski, from the Edmonton Oilers for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas, three first-round draft picks and US$15 million. The $15 million cash was needed for Oilers owner Peter Pocklington to secure the release of a lien on Gretzky’s contract held by the Province of Alberta Treasury Branches. McNall raised Gretzky&#x27;s annual salary from less than $1 million to $1,620,000 million for the 1988-1989 season, and a total of $19,340,000 over an 8 year contract. Many argue that this triggered a dramatic rise in NHL salaries throughout the 1990s.

In 1992, McNall was elected chairman of the NHL Board of Governors—the league&#x27;s second-highest post.

In 1991, McNall, Gretzky and actor/comedian John Candy purchased the CFL&#x27;s Toronto Argonauts. Prior to the 1991 season, McNall enticed Raghib &quot;Rocket&quot; Ismail away from the National Football League by signing him to a four-year contract for a then-unheard-of $18.2 million. Although Ismail led the Argonauts to the 1991 Grey Cup championship, he returned to the U.S. after two seasons in Toronto.

At one point, he also owned the finest copy of the most expensive baseball card, Honus Wagner&#x27;s 1909 T206 card.

==Thoroughbred racing==
McNall also owned Thoroughbred race horses and in 1990 won France&#x27;s most prestigious race, the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe, with the colt Saumarez. He also owned a 50% interest in Trempolino when the French colt won the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe in 1987. He was also a partner with Wayne Gretzky in the colt Golden Pheasant who won races in Europe as well as the Arlington Million in the U.S. and the Japan Cup at Tokyo Racecourse.

==Decline==
In December 1993, McNall defaulted on a $90 million loan, and Bank of America threatened to force the Kings into bankruptcy unless he sold the team. He sold controlling interest in the Kings in May 1994 and resigned as chairman of the board of governors, though he still remained as president and governor of the Kings for a time. 

In early 1994, he granted an interview to &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in which he admitted smuggling many of his prized coins out of foreign countries (it was the April 1994 issue, but released in early March of 1994); his admissions led to the shutting down of his numismatics firm, Numismatic Fine Arts, in early May of the same year by the FBI (including seizure of computers and printed documents from NFA&#x27;s offices in the Century City office complex). His claim of graduating from the University of Oxford was also debunked.

Later that year, McNall sold the Argos to league television partner TSN in May 1994, a sale delayed by John Candy&#x27;s death that March. The team had lost several million dollars over four years, and McNall concluded he could not justify those losses as an absentee owner 3,000 miles away..

On December 14, 1994, McNall pleaded guilty to five counts of conspiracy and fraud, and admitted to bilking six banks out of $236 million over a ten-year period. He was sentenced to 70 months in prison. Immediately after his conviction, it emerged that his free-spending ways had put the Kings in serious financial jeopardy. They were ultimately forced into bankruptcy in 1995. The financial problems from the McNall era plagued the Kings for several years afterward. 

McNall was released in 2001 after his sentence was reduced by 13 months for good behavior. He was on probation until 2006. McNall remained on good terms with many of his former players, with Wayne Gretzky, Rob Blake, Luc Robitaille and others visiting him in prison. Gretzky even refused to allow the Kings to retire his number 99 until McNall could attend the ceremony. McNall also attended Robitaille&#x27;s uniform retirement ceremony in 2007. He credited his celebrity friends who supported him. Kurt Russell and Goldie Hawn visited, &quot;Michael Eisner, who suggested I write the book and bought it, always took my call&quot;, while &quot;Dick Zanuck was always there, Tom Hanks would write to me, Bert Fields would send his books, and Barry Kemp wrote long letters. They kept me going.&quot;

McNall&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Fun While It Lasted: My Rise and Fall in the Land of Fame and Fortune&quot;, was published by Hyperion Books in 2003. In 2004, McNall became co-chair of A-Mark Entertainment. He took a role with Peter M. Hoffman at Seven Arts Pictures in 2003 and is credited on Nick Cassavetes&#x27; 2012 movie, &quot;Yellow&quot;.

<text>Bleach (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tite Kubo. It follows the adventures of a teenager Ichigo Kurosaki, who obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a &quot;death personification&quot; similar to a Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His new-found powers allow him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits called Hollows and guiding departed souls to the afterlife, and set him on journeys to various ghostly realms of existence.

&quot;Bleach&quot; was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from August 2001 to August 2016, with its chapters collected in 74 volumes. The series has spawned a media franchise that includes an anime television series adaptation produced by studio Pierrot from 2004 to 2012, two original video animation (OVA) episodes, four animated feature films, ten stage musicals, and numerous video games, as well as many types of &quot;Bleach&quot;-related merchandise. A Japanese live-action film adaptation produced by Warner Bros. premiered in 2018. A to the anime television series, which adapts the manga&#x27;s final story arc, premiered in 2022.

In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media in 2004. They have released the collected volumes and published its chapters in their &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; magazine from November 2007 until the magazine&#x27;s final issue in April 2012.

&quot;Bleach&quot; received the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award for the category in 2005. The manga had over 130 million volumes in circulation worldwide by 2022, making it one of the best-selling manga in history.

==Plot==

Ichigo Kurosaki is a teenager from Karakura Town who can see ghosts, a talent allowing him to meet Rukia Kuchiki, a Soul Reaper who enters the town in search of a Hollow, a kind of monstrous lost soul who can harm both ghosts and humans. Rukia is one of the , soldiers trusted with ushering the souls of the dead from the World of the Living to the , the afterlife realm from which she originates and with fighting Hollows. When she is severely wounded defending Ichigo from a Hollow she pursues, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo, so he may fight in her stead while she recovers. Rukia is thereby trapped in an ordinary human body, and she must advise Ichigo as he balances the demands of his substitute Soul Reaper duties and attending high school. For aid in hunting the Hollows, the pair ally with a trio of other spiritually empowered allies: Ichigo&#x27;s high school classmate Orihime Inoue, best friend Yasutora &quot;Chad&quot; Sado and Uryū Ishida, a Quincy classmate with the ability to control spiritual particles.

Eventually, Rukia is arrested by her Soul Reaper superiors and sentenced to death for the illegal act of transferring her powers to a human. Ichigo and his friends enlist the help of ex-Soul Reaper scientist Kisuke Urahara, who trains Ichigo to access his own Soul Reaper powers, to enter the Soul Society and rescue Rukia. Shortly after the party&#x27;s arrival in the Soul Society, conflict arises among the captains of the Thirteen Court Squads when the captain of the fifth company, Sōsuke Aizen, is apparently murdered. The captains believe that the intruders might have been responsible, which causes the Soul Reapers to begin fighting amongst themselves. Thereafter, the Captain Commander Genryusai Shigekuni Yamamoto, issues the Soul Reapers to arrest Ichigo and his friends as suspects. However, Ichigo saves Rukia and manages to stop the war against the Soul Society. Aizen reappears and reveals his intention to obtain the , an orb of immense power Urahara planted inside Rukia, by faking his death and arranging the execution. Aizen accompanies his fellow conspirators, Gin Ichimaru and Kaname Tōsen, who are the third and ninth company&#x27;s captains, as they use Hollows to cover their escape into the Hollows&#x27; realm, . Afterwards, Ichigo and Rukia reconcile with the Soul Reapers, who view the former as a powerful ally and designate him an official title as Substitute Soul Reaper.

Ichigo soon finds himself and his friends in escalating skirmishes with Aizen&#x27;s army of humanoid Hollows, the Arrancar, as they are joined by the Vizards, Soul Reapers who were victims of Aizen&#x27;s experiments in creating the Arrancar. When Ulquiorra, one of the Espada (Aizen&#x27;s ten most powerful Arrancars) kidnaps Orihime, Ichigo and his allies enter Hueco Mundo to invade Las Noches. However, as Ichigo rescues Orihime, Aizen reveals her abduction was a distraction as he launches an attack on Karakura Town, in order to sacrifice everyone and create a key to the Soul King&#x27;s Palace, so he can kill the Soul King who reigns over the Soul Society. Anticipating Aizen&#x27;s attack, the Thirteen Court Squads had already been waiting for him by moving the entire Karakura Town to the Soul Society prior to his attack. When the Vizards join the remaining Soul Reapers, Gin reveals his agenda of killing Aizen. The latter uses the Hōgyoku to become a god-like being before killing Gin. However, Ichigo sacrifices and loses all his power to defeat Aizen, and reverts to a normal human. Subsequently, Aizen is arrested by the Soul Society. 

Months later, preparing for life after high school, Ichigo is called back into action when Xcution, a group of Fullbringers—supernaturally aware humans like Chad, manipulate him and the others in a scheme to siphon his Fullbring abilities. After the Soul Reapers restore his Soul Reaper powers, Ichigo learns that Xcution&#x27;s leader, Kugo Ginjo, was his predecessor. It is revealed that the Soul Society did not trust the substitute Soul Reapers, so they used the badge given to the Substitute Soul Reaper to monitor and restrict his power output. Ginjo felt betrayed and swore vengeance on all Soul Reapers. Despite knowing the truth, Ichigo trusts his Soul Reaper friends and defeats Ginjo. With his power restored, Ichigo once again is reinstated as a Substitute Soul Reaper.

After Ichigo regains his powers, an army of Quincies known as the appear and declare war against the Soul Society, having already enslaved many Arrancars in Hueco Mundo. The group is led by Yhwach, the ancient progenitor of the Quincies, who seeks to kill the Soul King, and rid the world of death and fear. In their first invasion, the Wandenreich kill many Soul Reapers including the Head-Captain, Yamamoto. Uryū joins Yhwach and learns the truth behind the death of his mother. Later, Ichigo and his friends aid the Soul Society in fighting the Wandenreich&#x27;s second invasion, but Yhwach invades the Royal Palace and kills the Soul King. In the final battle, the surviving Shinigami, along with Ichigo and his friends, assault Yhwach&#x27;s new palace and defeat his army of Sternritters. Yhwach returns to the Soul Society to destroy it, but Ichigo kills him with the help of Uryū and Aizen after the latter is temporarily released from prison.

Ten years later, Rukia becomes the new captain of the thirteenth company and has a daughter, an apprentice Soul Reaper named Ichika, with her childhood friend Renji Abarai. Meanwhile, Ichigo and Orihime have a son named Kazui, who is also a Soul Reaper. 

Two years later, Ichigo attends the Soul Funeral Ceremony for 13th Division captain Jūshirō Ukitake. While the captains are waiting in the Soul Society to perform the ritual, Ichigo joins the Lieutenants at Karakura Town to capture Hollows that will be used as a sacrifice. They are ambushed by the Beasts of Hell, led by the late Octava Espada Szayelaporro Granz. Even though the lieutenants suppress them, it is revealed that the ceremony is a process of sending the deceased captains, including Ukitake, to Hell.

==Production==
&quot;Bleach&quot; was first conceived from Tite Kubo&#x27;s desire to draw a (Soul Reaper) in a kimono, which formed the basis for the design of the Soul Reapers in the series. At first, Kubo thought that the Soul Reapers should use guns, so the developed title for the series was &quot;Snipe&quot; (as in &quot;sniper&quot;) and published in &quot;Akamaru Jump&quot; in 2000; however, this working title changed with the inclusion of swords, but, as it was a last-minute change, the first announcement came out with the &quot;Snipe&quot; title still in place. After that, the series was meant to be named &quot;Black&quot; due to the color of the Soul Reapers&#x27; clothes, but Kubo thought the title was too generic. He later tried the name of &quot;White&quot;, but came to like &quot;Bleach&quot; more for its association with the color white and that he did not find it too obvious. The original story concept was submitted to &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; shortly after the cancellation of Kubo&#x27;s previous manga, &quot;Zombiepowder&quot;, but was at first rejected. Manga artist Akira Toriyama saw the story and wrote a letter of encouragement to Kubo. &quot;Bleach&quot; was accepted for publication a short time later in 2001, and was initially intended to be a shorter series, with a maximum serialization length of five years. Early plans for the story did not include the hierarchical structure of the Soul Society, but did include some characters and elements that were not introduced into the plot until the Arrancar arc, such as Ichigo&#x27;s Soul Reaper parentage.

Kubo has cited influences for elements of &quot;Bleach&quot; ranging from other manga series to music, foreign language, architecture, and film. He attributed his interest in drawing the supernatural and monsters to Shigeru Mizuki&#x27;s &quot;GeGeGe no Kitaro&quot; and &quot;Bleach&quot;″s focus on interesting weaponry and battle scenes to Masami Kurumada&#x27;s &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, manga that Kubo enjoyed as a boy. The latter is based on Greek mythology and Kubo also considered it as a source for his focus on myths, monsters and the afterlife. The action style and storytelling found in &quot;Bleach&quot; are inspired by cinema, though Kubo has not revealed any specific movie as being an influence for fight scenes. When pressed, he told interviewers that he liked &quot;Snatch&quot;, but did not use it as a model. &quot;Bleach&quot;″s fight choreography is instead constructed with the aid of rock music, which the author listens to while imagining the fights in order to give him a sense of pacing for the panel cuts and change of angles through the scenes. Kubo prefers to draw realistic injuries in order to render the fight more impactful, by making the readers feel the pain the characters are feeling. &quot;Bleach&quot; fight scenes are often broken up with brief gags, which the author inserts when he grows bored during the illustration process.

&quot;Bleach&quot;″s plotting process is focused around character design. When writing plotlines or having difficulties generating new material, Kubo begins by thinking of new characters, often &quot;en masse&quot;, and rereading previous volumes of &quot;Bleach&quot;. Kubo has said that he likes creating characters that have outward appearances that do not match their true nature—an element that can be found in many &quot;Bleach&quot; characters—as he is &quot;attracted to people with that seeming contradiction&quot; and finds an &quot;urge to draw people like that&quot; when he works. The terminology used in &quot;Bleach&quot; has a variety of inspirations, with each category of characters bearing a different linguistic theme. Many of the names for swords and spells used by Soul Reapers were inspired by ancient Japanese literature. Hollows and Arrancars use Spanish terms. Fullbringers use English vocabulary, with names referencing rock music, and finally, the Quincies draw on the German language. This multilingual terminology, along with the variety in apparent character ethnicities, emphasizes the international nature of the &quot;Bleach&quot; settings.

==Themes and analysis==
&quot;Bleach&quot;″s plot incorporates the traditional Japanese belief of spirits coexisting with humans and their nature, good or evil, depends on the circumstances. An example is Orihime&#x27;s backstory. She was raised from the age of three by her brother Sora, and prayed for his soul&#x27;s peace after he died in a car accident. As time went on, she prayed less and Sora became jealous and turned into a Hollow and attacked Orihime. Academic Patrick Drazen says this is a reminder to the audience to not abandon the old ways or risk the spirits taking offense and causing problems in the world. &quot;Bleach&quot; also incorporates Shinto themes of purification of &quot;evil spirits through charms, scrolls, incantations, and other rituals&quot;. Christopher A. Born regards &quot;Bleach&quot; as transmitting Confucian values.

Von Feigenblatt describes &quot;Bleach&quot; as being culturally and religiously aware, as it draws upon Christianity and Caribbean Santería. Spanish terms are prevalent throughout the realm of Hueco Mundo, and Quincies have been known to associate with the German language, making Kubo&#x27;s world of characters diverse in race and language as well. Von Feigenblatt notes that the Quincy &quot;are clearly inspired by the Roman Catholic Christian Orders of Knighthood such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre whose influence is shown in terms of the uniform worn by the Quincy as well as by the symbolism of the cross&quot;.

==Media==
===Manga===

&quot;Bleach&quot;, written and illustrated by Tite Kubo, was serialized for 15 years in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from August 7, 2001, to August 22, 2016. Its 698 individual chapters were collected in 74 volumes released between January 5, 2002, and November 4, 2016. Shueisha published the first 21 volumes compiled into six omnibus collections under the name &quot;Resurrected Souls&quot;, to celebrate the series&#x27; tenth anniversary. The first collection was released on August 22, 2011; the last collection was published on January 23, 2012.

North American licensor Viz Media serialized the first chapters in the print magazine &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; from its November 2007 to April 2012 issues. The series moved to the digital anthology &quot;Weekly Shonen Jump Alpha&quot; in January 2012 and Viz Media released it digitally as Shueisha published new chapters in Japan. The 74 volumes were released from July 6, 2004, to October 2, 2018. Viz Media also released a hardcover &quot;collector&#x27;s edition&quot; of the first volume that came with a dust jacket, two box sets, and twenty-five 3-in-1 volumes between June 7, 2011, and March 5, 2019.

A 73-page chapter, titled , was published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the manga&#x27;s debut in the magazine, on August 10, 2021. It was published in English by Viz Media&#x27;s &quot;Shonen Jump&quot; online magazine and on the Shueisha&#x27;s &quot;Manga Plus&quot; online platform. The one-shot ends seemingly on a cliffhanger; the character for &quot;hen&quot; (), used in the Japanese title of the chapter, is usually used to denote the title of a story arc. The chapter was digitally released as a collected volume on December 3, 2021. A full-color version of the chapter was published digitally on September 4, 2023.

===Video games===

A number of video games have been created featuring characters from the &quot;Bleach&quot; series, primarily though not exclusively fighting games. The first video game to be released from the &quot;Bleach&quot; series was &quot;&quot;, which debuted on March 24, 2005, for the Sony PlayStation Portable. Currently, the majority of the games have only been released in Japan, though Sega has localized the first three Nintendo DS games and the first Wii game for North America. So far, all dedicated &quot;Bleach&quot; games released for Sony&#x27;s consoles have been developed and published by SCEI, whereas the games for Nintendo consoles are developed and published by Sega, and the Nintendo DS games are developed by Treasure Co. Ltd. Two mobile games had also been released in 2014 (&quot;Bleach: Bankai Battle&quot;) and 2015 (&quot;&quot;) for the series, which are available for iOS and Android. In 2017, Line announced the release of a game exclusive for their communication app called &quot;Bleach: Paradise Lost&quot;. In July 2023, a console video game titled &quot;Bleach: Soul Resonance&quot;, published by Nuverse, was announced. In July 2024, a video game titled &quot;Bleach: Rebirth of Souls&quot; was announced. It is set to be released by Bandai Namco Entertainment for the PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows (via Steam), and Xbox Series X/S on March 21, 2025.

===Trading card game===

Two collectible card games (CCG) based on the &quot;Bleach&quot; series have been produced, one in the Japanese market and a different one in North America. &quot;Bleach Soul Card Battle&quot;, produced by Bandai, was introduced in Japan at the Jump Festa in 2004. Twenty named sets were released for the series. After &quot;Bleach Soul Card Battle&quot;, Bandai introduced three more series. &quot;Bleach The Card Gum&quot;, which contains 14 sets, was released in early September 2007. The next series, &quot;Bleach Clear Collection&quot;, which contains six sets, was released in July 2008. The last series, &quot;Bleach Clear Soul Plate&quot;, which consists of three sets, was published in December 2009.

&quot;Bleach TCG&quot; was introduced in the United States by Score Entertainment in May 2007, but ceased publication April 2009, just before the planned launch of its seventh expansion, &quot;Bleach Infiltration&quot;. This cancellation was attributed to the 2007–09 recession, which has heavily affected TCG sales. Designed by Aik Tongtharadol, the TCG is a two-player game in which each player starts with at least 61 cards: a &quot;Guardian&quot; card, a 60-card &quot;main deck&quot;, and an optional 20-card &quot;side deck&quot;. A player loses if his or her power, as dictated by the Guardian card, is reduced to zero, or if he or she is unable to draw or discard a card from his or her deck. The cards for the game have been released in named sets with each set released in three formats: a 72-card pre-constructed box set containing a starter deck and two booster packs, a 10-card booster pack, and a 12-pack booster box.

===Musicals===

Bleach has been adapted into a series of rock musicals, jointly produced by Studio Pierrot and Nelke Planning. There have been five musicals produced which covered portions of the Substitute and Soul Society arcs, as well as five additional performances known as &quot;Live Bankai Shows&quot; and &quot;Rock Musical Bleach Shinsei&quot;, which did not follow the &quot;Bleach&quot; plotline. The initial performance run of the &quot;Bleach&quot; musical was from August 17–28, 2005, at the Space Zero Tokyo center in Shinjuku.

The musicals are directed by Takuya Hiramitsu, with script adaptation by Naoshi Okumura and music composed by playwright Shoichi Tama. The songs are completely original and not taken from the anime soundtrack. Key actors in the series include Tatsuya Isaka, who plays Ichigo Kurosaki, Miki Satō, who plays Rukia Kuchiki, and Eiji Moriyama, who plays Renji Abarai.

In 2016, another musical was produced to celebrate &quot;Bleach&quot; 15th anniversary. The musical was directed and written by Tsutsumi Yasuyuki with Dream5&#x27;s Akira Takano and Chihiro Kai as Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki respectively. The musical debuted on July 28, 2016, in AiiA 2.5 Theater Tokyo.

==Reception==
===Sales===
&quot;Bleach&quot; had over 90million copies in circulation in Japan by 2017; over 120 million copies in circulation worldwide by 2018; and over 130 million copies in circulation worldwide by 2022, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time from &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;. During 2008, volume 34 of the manga sold 874,153 copies in Japan, becoming the 12th best-seller comics from the year. Volumes 33 and 35 have also ranked 17 and 18, respectively. In total the manga has sold 3,161,825 copies in Japan during 2008, becoming the year&#x27;s fifth best selling series. In the first half from 2009, &quot;Bleach&quot; ranked as the second best-selling manga in Japan, having sold 3.5 million copies. Having sold 927,610 copies, volume 36 ranked seventh, volume 37 was eighth with 907,714 sold copies, and volume 38 at 10th with 822,238 copies.

North American sales of the manga have also been high, with volumes having sold over 1.2million copies by 2007. Volume 16 placed in the top 10 graphic novel sales in December 2006 and volume 17 was the best-selling manga volume for the month of February 2007. In a 2010 interview, Gonzalo Ferreyra, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Viz, listed &quot;Bleach&quot; as one of six Viz titles that continue to exceed expectations in spite of the harshening manga market. By 2022, the manga had over 2.7million volumes in circulation in the United States.

===Critical reception===
Deb Aoki from About.com considered the series as the Best Continuing Shōnen Manga of 2007, along with &quot;Eyeshield 21&quot;, praising the &quot;compelling stories, dazzling action sequences and great character development&quot;. She also placed the title on her list of &quot;Top 10 Shōnen Manga Must-Reads&quot;. The artwork and the character designs received positive response by IGN&#x27;s A.E. Sparrow. He also commented on the series&#x27; ability to handle multiple minor character plotlines at the same time, which he considered a point of appeal, in response to fans&#x27; claims about a &quot;lack of a story&quot; in &quot;Bleach&quot;. Leroy Douresseaux from &quot;Comic Book Bin&quot; agreed with Sparrow in the number of storylines, but also praised the fighting scenes finding them comparable to the ones of popular films. On the other hand, Mania reviewer Jarred Pine criticized the series as being plagued with stereotypes from the genre. He felt it was a rough start for the series with unimpressive battles, overused gags, and a bad introduction for central character Ichigo that causes him to come across &quot;as a frowning punk&quot; whose one good trait is his desire to protect. Despite this, Pine notes that he loves the series, particularly its quirky, lovable characters. Jason Thompson said he was no longer able to take &quot;Bleach&quot; seriously after it introduced villains Ulquiorra and Yammy in a scene precisely mirroring Vegeta and Nappa&#x27;s arrival in &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, but acknowledged it was likely intended as a deliberate homage. He also said Kubo was able to avoid the worst artistic failings typical in series which indulge in superpowered combat, but that the battle scenes were still sometimes difficult to follow.

===Accolades===
In 2005, &quot;Bleach&quot; was awarded the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award in the category. The English version of the manga was nominated for the &quot;best manga&quot; and &quot;best theme&quot; awards at the 2006 and 2007 American Anime Awards, but did not win either category.

In November 2014, readers of Media Factory&#x27;s &quot;Da Vinci&quot; magazine voted &quot;Bleach&quot; the 16th &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;″s greatest manga series of all time. On TV Asahi&#x27;s Manga Sōsenkyo 2021 poll, in which 150,000 people voted for their top 100 manga series, &quot;Bleach&quot; ranked 23rd.

<doc id="660334" wikidata="Q953836" url="?curid=660334" title="Oxalis oregana">
<text>Oxalis oregana , known as redwood sorrel or Oregon oxalis, is a species of the wood sorrel family, Oxalidaceae, in the genus &quot;Oxalis&quot; native to moist Douglas-fir and coast redwood forests of western North America from southwestern British Columbia to Washington, Oregon, and California.

==Description==

&quot;Oxalis oregana&quot; is a short, herbaceous perennial with erect flowering stems 5–15 cm tall. The three leaflets are heart-shaped, 1–4.5 cm long with purplish undersides, on 5–20 cm stalks. The inflorescence is 2.4–4 cm in diameter, white to pink with five petals and sepals. The hairy five-chambered seed capsules are egg-shaped, 7–9 mm long; seeds are almond-shaped. It spreads by a scaly rhizome varying the size of patches. They can be seen throughout moist forest under-canopies.

==Rapid light response==
&quot;Oxalis oregana&quot; photosynthesizes at relatively low levels of ambient sunlight (1/200th of full sunlight). When direct sunlight strikes the leaves they fold downwards; when shade returns, the leaves reopen. Taking only a few minutes, this movement is observable to the eye.

==Leaves as food==
The leaves of &quot;Oxalis oregana&quot; are eaten by the Cowlitz, Quileute and Quinault peoples. Like spinach, they contain mildly toxic oxalic acid, which is named after the genus. They are safe to eat in small amounts for those with no oxalate-related conditions.

<doc id="660337" wikidata="Q457279" url="?curid=660337" title="Harold Russell">
<text>Harold John Avery Russell (January 14, 1914 – January 29, 2002) was an American World War II veteran and actor. After losing his hands during his military service, Russell was cast in the epic drama film &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946), which earned him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He was the first non-professional actor to win an Academy Award for acting and the first Oscar recipient to sell his award.

==Early life==

Harold Russell was born in North Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, and moved to Massachusetts, United States, with his family in 1921, after his father&#x27;s death in 1920.

At the time of the December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, he was living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, working at a food market. In his 1949 autobiography, &quot;Victory in My Hands&quot;, he wrote that he rushed to enlist in the United States Army because he considered himself a failure.

On June 6, 1944, while he was an Army instructor teaching demolition work with the U.S. 13th Airborne Division at Camp Mackall, North Carolina, a defective fuse detonated TNT explosives that he was handling. He lost both hands and was given two hooks to serve as hands. After his recovery, while attending Boston University, Russell was featured in &quot;Diary of a Sergeant&quot;, an Army film about rehabilitating war veterans.

==&quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;==

When film director William Wyler saw the film on Russell, he cast him in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; with Fredric March and Dana Andrews. Russell played the role of Homer Parrish, a United States Navy sailor who lost both hands during the war.

For his role as Parrish, Russell won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in 1947. Earlier in the ceremony, he was awarded an honorary Oscar for &quot;bringing aid and comfort to disabled veterans through the medium of motion pictures.&quot; The special award had been created because the board of governors wanted to salute Russell, a non-professional actor, but assumed that he had little chance for a competitive win. It was the only time in Oscar history that the academy awarded two Oscars for the same performance.

Wyler called it &quot;the finest performance I have ever seen on the screen.&quot; However, Russell earned less than $10,000 for his performance (equivalent to $167,500 in 2023 dollars), and he did not receive any residual profits.

==Later years==

Upon completion of the film, at the urging of Wyler, Russell returned to school, earning a business degree from Boston University. Speaking with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1996, Russell recalled:
Wyler told me I should go back to college because there wasn&#x27;t much call for a guy with no hands in the motion picture industry. I figured he was right. [In the handful of roles I&#x27;ve taken since then,] I always play a disabled veteran. And this is what Wyler said—&#x27;After a while they&#x27;re going to run out of ideas&#x27;—and he was absolutely right. How many times can you play the same role?

Russell became active in AMVETS, serving three terms as National Commander. He was first elected in 1949. He was elected to his third term in 1960. He also was vice-president of the World Veterans Fund, Inc., the fundraising branch of the World Veterans Federation.

As head of AMVETS, Russell wrote to President Truman in 1951 supporting his decision to dismiss General Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War. Russell&#x27;s telegram to Truman cited MacArthur&#x27;s &quot;repeated insubordination in violation of basic American principles governing civil versus military authority.&quot; His telegram asserted that those were &quot;obvious grounds&quot; to relieve MacArthur. Erle Cocke, Jr., commander of the American Legion, said that he was &quot;shocked by the news&quot; that AMVETS and the American Veterans Committee supported MacArthur&#x27;s firing.

From the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Russell served as chairman of the President&#x27;s Commission on Employment of the Handicapped, an unpaid position. 

In 1965, Russell received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

Russell appeared in two films after his debut, &quot;Inside Moves&quot; in 1980 and &quot;Dogtown&quot; in 1997. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, in 1981 and a two-part episode of the television series &quot;China Beach&quot; in 1989.

Russell authored two autobiographies, &quot;Victory in My Hands&quot; (1949) and &quot;The Best Years of My Life&quot; (1981). 

In 1992, Russell consigned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions, and, on August 6, 1992, in New York City, the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60,500. Russell defended his action by saying that he needed money for his wife&#x27;s medical expenses, though this was later disputed. Russell did not sell the special Oscar. After his death, the unidentified collector was identified as Lew Wasserman, a studio executive and talent agent, who then donated it back to the Academy.

On January 29, 2002, Russell died at a nursing home in Needham, Massachusetts and was interred in Lakeview Cemetery in the nearby town of Wayland.

<doc id="660342" wikidata="Q1465164" url="?curid=660342" title="History of the Jews in Africa">
<text>African Jewish communities include:
*Sephardi Jews and Mizrahi Jews who primarily live in the Maghreb of North Africa, including Morocco, Algeria, Libya, and Tunisia, as well as Sudan and Egypt. Some were established early in the diaspora; others after the expulsion from Iberia in the late 15th century.
*South African Jews, who are mostly Ashkenazi Jews descended from pre-Holocaust immigrant Lithuanian Jews.
*Beta Israel living primarily in the Amhara and Tigray regions of Ethiopia and sparsely in Eritrea.
*Berber Jews, the majority of whom were assimilated and converted to Islam, especially during the historical persecutions of the Almohadic Caliphate in the Middle Ages. The modern population of Berber Jews in Africa now numbers about 8,000 people in Morocco, with the majority having emigrated to Israel since the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, along with smaller numbers scattered throughout Europe and North America. 
*Lemba Jews, who have been in Zimbabwe for at least 2500 years.
*Historical communities which no longer exist in Africa due to assimilation, such as the Jews of Bilad el-Sudan in West Africa, who existed before the introduction of Islam to the region during the 14th century. 
*Various relatively modern groups throughout Africa, most of whom claim some form of a Judaic or Israelite identity, and/or ancestry.

==Ancient communities==
The most ancient communities of African Jews are the Ethiopian, West African Jews, Sephardi Jews, and Mizrahi Jews of North Africa and the Horn of Africa.

In the seventh century, many Spanish Jews fled from the persecution which was occurring under the rule of the Visigoths and migrated to North Africa, where they made their homes in the Byzantine-dominated cities along the Mediterranean coast. Others arrived after the expulsion from Iberia. Remnants of longstanding Jewish communities remain in Morocco, Tunisia, and the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla. There is a much-diminished but still vibrant community on the island of Djerba in Tunisia. Since 1948 and the war to establish Israel, which aroused hostility in Muslim lands, most other North African Jews emigrated to Israel.

Of the seventh-century immigrants, some of them moved inland and proselytized among the Berber tribes. A number of tribes, including the Jarawa, Uled Jari, and some tribes of the Daggatun people, converted to Judaism. Ibn Khaldun reported that Kahina, a female Berber warlord who led the resistance against the Muslim Arab conquests of North Africa in the 680s and 690s, was a Jew of the Jarawa tribe. With the defeat of the Berber rebellion, none of the Jewish communities was initially forced to convert to Islam.

===Ethiopia===
In 1975, the Israeli religious authorities and the Israeli government both recognized the Beta Israel of Ethiopia as an officially Jewish community. Hundreds of persons who wanted to emigrate to Israel were air-lifted under the leadership of Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Begin had obtained an official ruling from the Israeli Sephardi Chief Rabbi (or &quot;Rishon LeZion&quot;) Ovadia Yosef that the Beta Israel were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes. Rabbis believed that they were probably descendants of the Tribe of Dan; rabbinical responsa discussing issues related to the people date back hundreds of years. With this endorsement, in later decades, tens of thousands of Beta Israel Jews were air-lifted to Israel. Significant immigration to Israel continues into the 21st century, producing an Ethiopian Jewish community of around 81,000 immigrants, who with their 39,000 children who were born in Israel itself, numbered around 120,000 by early 2009.

Due to certain aspects of Orthodox Jewish marital laws, Rabbi Yosef ruled that upon their arrival in Israel, the Beta Israel had to undergo a &quot;pro forma&quot; conversion to Judaism. They had to declare their allegiance to a &quot;halachic&quot; way of life and the Jewish people, in conformity with practices which are followed by adherents of Orthodox Rabbinical Judaism. He did not demand the normal formal requirements that the halacha imposes on potential gentile proselytes, (such as a brit milah or immersion in a mikveh). Few Ashkenazi rabbinic authorities consider the conversions to be actual conversions, not &quot;pro forma&quot;.
Over time, due to their community&#x27;s isolation from those in Europe and the Middle East, the practices of the Beta Israel developed to differ significantly from those of other forms of Judaism. In Ethiopia, the Beta Israel community was for the most part isolated from the Talmud. They did have their own oral law. In some cases, they had practices similar to those of Karaite Judaism, and in others more similar to rabbinical Judaism.

In many instances, their religious elders, or their priestly class, known as &quot;kessim&quot; or &quot;qessotch&quot;, interpreted the Biblical Law of the Tanakh in a way which is similar to the way in which it is interpreted by rabbinite Jewish communities in other parts of the world. In that sense, the Beta Israel had a tradition analogous to that of the &quot;Talmud,&quot; although at times at variance with the practices and teachings of other Jewish communities.

One significant difference is the fact that the Beta Israel lacked the festivals of Purim and Hanukkah, probably because they branched off from the main body of Judaism before these non-Biblical holidays began to be commemorated. Today, most members of the Beta Israel community living in Israel do observe these holidays.

They are a community which is in transition. Some of the kessim accept the rabbinic/Talmudic tradition that is practiced by non-Ethiopian Orthodox Jews. Many members of the younger generation of Ethiopian-Israelis have been educated in yeshivas and they have also received rabbinical ordination (&quot;semikha&quot;). A certain segment of traditionalist &quot;kessim&quot; insist on maintaining their separate and distinct form of Judaism, as it had been practiced in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Many of the Ethiopian Jewish youth who have immigrated to Israel or been born there have assimilated either to the dominant form of Orthodox Judaism, or to a secular lifestyle.

The Beit Avraham of Ethiopia consists of some 50,000 members. This community also claims to have a Jewish heritage. Several scholars think that they broke off from the Beta Israel community several centuries ago, hid their Jewish customs, and outwardly adopted Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity.

The Beit Avraham have traditionally been on the lower rungs of Ethiopian social life. They have held occupations which are similar to those which have been held by the Beta Israel, such as crafts. Recently, the Beit Avraham community has attempted to reach out to the worldwide Jewish community. They formed the Ethiopian North Shewa Zionist Organization in an attempt to save their Jewish identity. The members of this group refer to themselves as the &quot;Falashmura.&quot; Because they do not have any reliable proof of Jewish ancestry, Israeli religious authorities and other religious Jewish communities require them to complete a formal conversion to Judaism before they recognize them as Jews. Those Falashmura who do so are considered converts to Judaism.

The Gefat people (locally known by the pejorative &quot;Fuga&quot;) are a southern Ethiopian tribe which is descended from Beta Israel.

===Somalia===

The Yibir are a tribe that lives in Somalia, eastern Ethiopia, Djibouti, and northern Kenya. Though they have been Muslim for centuries, some of them assert they are descendants of Hebrews who arrived in the Horn of Africa long before the arrival of Somali nomads. These individuals assert that &quot;Yibir&quot; means &quot;Hebrew&quot; in their language.

===Bilad el-Sudan===

The historical presence of Jewish communities in Africa is well-attested to. Today, the descendants of these Jews live in nations such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, Senegal, Ghana, Nigeria, and many other areas. According to the 17th century &quot;Tarikh al-Fattash&quot; and the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;, several Jewish communities existed as parts of the Ghana, Mali, and later Songhai empires. One such community was formed by a group of Egyptian Jews, who allegedly traveled by way of the Sahel corridor through Chad into Mali. Manuscript C of the &quot;Tarikh al-Fattash&quot; described a community called the Bani Israel; in 1402, it lived in Tindirma, possessed 333 wells, and had seven princes as well as an army.

Another such community was that of the Zuwa ruler of Koukiya (located at the Niger River). His name was known only as &quot;Zuwa Alyaman,&quot; meaning &quot;He comes from Yemen&quot;. According to an isolated local legend, Zuwa Alyaman was a member of one of the Jewish communities transported from Yemen by Abyssinians in the 6th century CE after the defeat of Dhu Nuwas. Zuwa Alyaman was said to have traveled into West Africa along with his brother. They established a community in Kukiya at the banks of the Niger River downstream from Gao. According to the &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;, after Zuwa Alyaman, there were 14 Zuwa rulers of Gao before the rise of Islam in the second half of the eleventh century.

Other sources stated that other Jewish communities in the region developed from people who migrated from Morocco and Egypt; others later came from Portugal. Some communities were said to have been populated by certain Berber Jews, like a group of Tuareg known as Dawsahak or Iddao Ishaak (&quot;children of Isaac&quot;). They speak a language related to Songhai, live in Ménaka Region in northeastern Mali and were formerly herders for Tuareg nobles. In addition, some migrated into the area away from the Muslim rule of North Africa.

The well-known 16th Century geographer Leo Africanus - an Andalusian Berber convert to Christianity - mentions a mysterious small village of African Jews southwest of Timbuktu, who traded in exotic spices, weapons, and poisons.

==Medieval arrivals==

===North Africa and the Maghreb===

The largest influx of Jews to Africa came after the Spanish Inquisition after the Fall of Granada and the end of Islamic Spain. The mass exodus and expulsion of the Iberian Jews began in 1492, Sicilian Jews were affected soon afterwards. Many of these Sephardi Jews settled primarily in the Maghreb under Muslim and Ottoman patronage. Morocco, Tunisia, Libya and Algeria as well as Egypt became home to significant Jewish communities. These communities were later incorporated into the Ottoman millet system as Africanized Ottoman Jews, bound by the laws of the Talmud and Torah but with allegiance to the Caliph of Constantinople.

===Tanzania===

The Nyambo are a tribe that lives in Tanzania, northern Tanzania, and Southern Uganda as Ankole. Though they have been Christians for centuries, they assert they are descendants of Hebrews who arrived in the Horn of Africa long before the arrival of Somali nomads. Some say that &quot;Nyambo&quot; means &quot;Hebrew&quot; in their language.

=== Sudan ===
We know little more about the presence of Jews in modern times in the territories of today&#x27;s Sudan, and what is known is that in the 20th and 19th centuries a permanent Jewish community was founded, which at its peak totaled approximately one thousand Jews, and that Jewish community was closed in the 1970s.

===Songhai===
In the 14th century many Moors and Jews, fleeing persecution in Spain, migrated south to the Timbuktu area, at that time part of the Songhai Empire. Among them was the Kehath (Ka&#x27;ti) family, descended from Ismael Jan Kot Al-yahudi of Scheida, Morocco. Sons of this prominent family founded three villages that still exist near Timbuktu—Kirshamba, Haybomo, and Kongougara. In 1492, Askia Muhammed came to power in the previously tolerant region of Timbuktu and decreed that Jews must convert to Islam or leave; Judaism became illegal in Songhai, as it did in Catholic Spain that same year. As the historian Leo Africanus wrote in 1526: &quot;The king (Askia) is a declared enemy of the Jews. He will not allow any to live in the city. If he hears it said that a Berber merchant frequents them or does business with them, he confiscates his goods.&quot;

The Kehath family converted with the rest of the non-Muslim population. The Cohens, descended from the Moroccan Islamicized Jewish trader El-Hadj Abd-al-Salam al Kuhin, arrived in the Timbuktu area in the 18th century, and the Abana family came in the first half of the 19th century. According to Prof. Michel Abitbol, at the Center for the Research of Moroccan Jewry in Israel, in the late 19th century Rabbi Mordoche Aby Serour traveled to Timbuktu several times as a not-too-successful trader in ostrich feathers and ivory. Ismael Diadie Haidara, a historian from Timbuktu, has found old Hebrew texts among the city&#x27;s historical records. He has also researched his own past and discovered that he is descended from the Moroccan Jewish traders of the Abana family. As he interviewed elders in the villages of his relatives, he has discovered that knowledge of the family&#x27;s Jewish identity has been preserved, in secret, out of fear of persecution.

===São Tomé e Príncipe===
King Manuel I of Portugal exiled about 2,000 Jewish children under the age of ten, to São Tomé and Príncipe around 1500. Most died, but in the early 17th century &quot;the local bishop noted with disgust that there were still Jewish observances on the island and returned to Portugal because of his frustration with them.&quot; Although Jewish practices faded over subsequent centuries, there are people in São Tomé and Príncipe who are aware of partial descent from this population. Similarly, a number of Portuguese ethnic Jews were exiled to Sao Tome after forced conversions to Roman Catholicism. From São Tomé and by other means groups of Jews settled down the west coast of Africa, as far south as Loango.

==Modern communities==
===Cameroon===
Rabbi Yisrael Oriel, formerly Bodol Ngimbus-Ngimbus, was born into the Bassa people. He says there were historically Jews in the area and that the word &quot;Bassa&quot; is from the Hebrew for &#x27;on a journey&#x27; and means &quot;blessing&quot;. Rabbi Oriel claims to be a Levite descended from Moses and reportedly made &quot;aliya&quot; in 1988, and he was then apparently ordained as a rabbi by the Sephardic Chief Rabbi and appointed rabbi to Nigerian Jews.

Rabbi Oriel claims that in 1920 there were 400,000 &#x27;Israelites&#x27; in Cameroon, but by 1962 the number had decreased to 167,000 due to conversions to Christianity and Islam. He said that although these tribes had not been accepted halachically, he believes that he can prove their Jewish status from medieval rabbinic sources.

The father of Yaphet Kotto, an American actor, was a Cameroonian Jew. Kotto identified as Jewish.

===Côte d&#x27;Ivoire===
Communities have been forming in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire in recent years and have been slowly growing throughout the region. The capital city of Abidjan has two synagogues, each with a population of about 40-70 congregants. In addition, large groups of indigenous peoples referred to as Danites claim descent from the lost tribe of Dan and many from this ethnic group have shown interest in Judaic practices.

===Ghana===

From the eighteenth century on what is now Ghana was a favorite locus for theories positing Israelite origins for various ethnic groups in the area. These theories were widespread and were taken up by powerful people in the twentieth century. The House of Israel community of Sefwi Wiawso, Sefwi Sui has identified as Jewish since the early 1970s.

===Kenya===

Theories suggesting Israelite origins particularly of the Masai abounded in the nineteenth century and were gradually absorbed into religious and societal practices throughout the area. The chief proponent of Masai Israelite origins was a German officer Moritz Merkel whose detailed research is still in use today. Of the many Judaic manifestations in the religious sphere is a small emergent community in Laikipia County, Kenya, which has abandoned Christianity and taken up Judaism. There are an estimated 5,000 of them at the present time. Although at first Messianic, they concluded that their beliefs were incompatible with Christianity and are now waiting to be instructed in traditional Judaism. Some of the younger children of this community have been sent to the Abayudaya schools in Uganda to be instructed in Judaism and other subjects. Luos in Kenya are another of the groups considered by some to be of Israelite origin. They claim to have migrated hundreds of years ago from the north along the river Nile from Egypt through South Sudan and then into Kenya.

===Madagascar===

In early modern times it was widely believed that Israelites had settled in Madagascar. Works by the French scholar Alfred Grandidier and Augustus Keane, the British professor of Hindustani at University College, London provided what they saw as conclusive proof of these ancient connections. In 2010 a small community of Malagasies began practicing normative Judaism, and three separate communities formed, each embracing a different version of Jewish spiritual practice. In May 2016, 121 members of the Malagasy Jewish community were converted in accordance with traditional Jewish rituals; appearing before a beit din and submerged in a mikvah. The conversion, organized with the help of the Jewish organization Kulanu, was presided over by three Orthodox rabbis.

===Nigeria===

At the present time, the existence of Israelite associations is mainly attributed to the Igbo, many of whom claim Israelite origins. Most of the Jews of Nigeria can be found among the Igbo ethnic group. Certain Nigerian communities with Judaic practices have been receiving help from individual Israelis and American Jews who work in Nigeria with outreach organizations like Kulanu.
The number of Igbos in Nigeria who identify as Jews has been estimated to number around 4,000 (2016), along with 70 synagogues. Many have converted from Christianity. Other sources give a higher estimate, claiming that some 30,000 Igbos were practicing some form of Judaism in 2008.

===South Africa===
===Uganda===

For centuries, it was believed that Jews inhabited the central portions of Africa. Some Africans were keen to adopt Judaism in recent times. One of these was Samei Kakungulu, one of the most remarkable Ugandans of his generation, a brilliant military strategist and a man who had a great amount of spiritual and intellectual curiosity. In 1919, having declared that &quot;we now will be known as Jews,&quot; he was circumcised along with his first son, whom he called Yuda. His second son was subsequently circumcised on the eighth day, in the Jewish fashion, and he was named Nimrod. In 1922, Kakungulu published a 90-page book, which was essentially a guide to Judaism. He died a Jew (albeit one with a residual belief in Jesus) and his followers in Mbale, who are known as the Abayudaya, continued to practice Judaism, despite the persecution which they were subjected to during the rule of Idi Amin, when many of them converted to Christianity or Islam, and today, they are some thousand strong. In the twenty first century, the Abayudaya are considered observant practitioners of Judaism, many of them have undergone formal Orthodox conversions, and they have forged strong links with Jewish communities in the United States and Israel, along with increasingly strong links with Black Jewish communities in Africa and elsewhere. In a relatively new movement, the Abayudaya of Uganda have converted to Judaism since 1917, influenced by the American William Saunders Crowdy, who claimed that African Americans were descended from the Jews.

===Zambia===

A number of European Jews settled in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia). At its peak in the early 1960s, there were 1,000 Jews living in the country, many in Livingstone. The number began to fall after independence and there were estimated to be around 50 remaining by 2012.

===Zimbabwe===
====Anglo-Jews====

The Zimbabwe Jewish community was mainly of British citizenship, whose arrival coincides with the first white colonists in the 1890s. At its peak in the early 1970s, it numbered some 7500 people (80% Ashkenazi Jews) who lived primarily in the two communities of Salisbury (now Harare) and Bulawayo in Matabeleland. Smaller rural communities also existed for short periods in Kwekwe, Umtali (now Mutare), and Gatooma. The community declined in part due to age, but most Jewish residents in Zimbabwe left after violence and social disruption. In 2007, the local Jewish community had declined to 270. The community had strong links with Israel.

In 2003, the Bulawayo Hebrew Congregation Synagogue burned down; this was followed by several letters justifying the fire based on economic antisemitism.

====The Lemba People====

The Lemba,&quot;wa-Remba&quot;, or &quot;Mwenye&quot; are a Bantu-speaking ethnic group native to Zimbabwe and South Africa, with smaller, little-known branches in Mozambique and Malawi. According to Tudor Parfitt, when he first worked in the field among the Lemba in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Malawi in the 1980s, they numbered an estimated 50,000. They speak the same Bantu languages which their geographic neighbours speak and they also bear a physical resemblance to their geographic neighbors, but some of their religious practices and beliefs are similar to Jewish and Muslim practices and beliefs. According to Parfitt, the Lemba claim that they once had a book which described their traditions but it was lost.

Parfitt has suggested that the name &quot;Lemba&quot; may originate in &quot;chilemba&quot;, a Swahili word for the turbans which are worn by some Bantu men, or it may originate from &quot;lembi,&quot; a Bantu term for a &quot;non-African&quot; or a &quot;respected foreigner&quot;. In Zimbabwe and South Africa, the people prefer the name &quot;Mwenye.&quot;

They have a tradition of ancient Jewish or South Arabian descent through their male line. Genetic Y-DNA analyses in the 2000s have established a partially Middle-Eastern origin for a portion of the male Lemba population. More recent research argues that DNA studies do not support claims of a specifically Jewish genetic heritage.

===Mauritius===

According to the 2011 census carried out by Statistics Mauritius, there are 43 Jews in Mauritius.

It is based on the 1929 Hungarian one-act play &quot;Egy, kettő, három&quot; by Ferenc Molnár, with a &quot;plot borrowed partly from&quot; &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, a 1939 film co-written by Wilder. The film stars James Cagney, Horst Buchholz, Liselotte Pulver, Pamela Tiffin, Arlene Francis, Leon Askin and Howard St. John. It would be Cagney&#x27;s last film appearance until &quot;Ragtime&quot; in 1981, 20 years later.

The film is primarily set in West Berlin during the Cold War, but before the construction of the Berlin Wall, and politics is predominant in the premise. The film is known for its quick pace.

==Plot==
C.R. &quot;Mac&quot; MacNamara is a high-ranking executive in the Coca-Cola Company, assigned to West Berlin after a business fiasco a few years earlier in the Middle East (about which he is still bitter). While based in West Germany for now, Mac is angling to become head of Western European Coca-Cola Operations, based in London. After working on an arrangement to introduce Coke into the Soviet Union, Mac receives a call from his boss, W.P. Hazeltine, at Coca-Cola headquarters in Atlanta. Scarlett Hazeltine, the boss&#x27;s hot-blooded but slightly dim 17-year-old socialite daughter, is coming to West Berlin. Mac is assigned the unenviable task of taking care of her.

An expected two-week stay extends into two months, and Mac discovers just why Scarlett is so enamored of West Berlin: she surprises him by announcing that she&#x27;s married to Otto Piffl, a young East German Communist with ardent anti-capitalistic views. When the Southern belle is confronted about her foolishness in the matter of helping him blow up anti-American &quot;Yankee Go Home&quot; balloons (how the couple met) she simply replies with, &quot;It&#x27;s not &quot;anti-American&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;anti-Yankee&quot;. Where I come from, everybody&#x27;s against the Yankees.&quot;

Mac tries to come to terms with letting his boss&#x27;s daughter marry a Communist and learns the horrible truth: the couple are bound for Moscow to make a new life for themselves (&quot;They&#x27;ve assigned us a magnificent apartment, just a short walk from the bathroom!&quot;). Since Hazeltine and his wife are coming to Berlin to collect their daughter the next day, Mac deals with the disaster by bribing East German officials to steal Scarlett’s marriage certificate from the archives. Mac also frames the young Communist firebrand Otto, resulting in his being arrested by the East German police, by planting on his motorcycle a &quot;Russky Go Home&quot; balloon and presenting him with a wedding present of an Uncle Sam cuckoo clock wrapped in the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;. After Otto, during interrogation, is forced to listen endlessly to a cover of the song &quot;Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini&quot; (which is intentionally badly distorted as it plays) he cracks and signs a confession saying that he is an American spy.

Under pressure from his exasperated and disapproving wife Phyllis (who wants to take her family back to live in the US), and with the revelation that Scarlett is pregnant—and, worse, unmarried with her East German marriage certificate gone—Mac must now fix the mess he has created. He must restore the marriage certificate and bring Otto back with the help of his new Soviet business associates on whom Mac uses all his wiles, as well as his sexy secretary, Fräulein Ingeborg. With the boss on the way, he finds that his only chance is to turn Otto into a son-in-law in good standing—which means, among other things, making him a capitalist with an aristocratic pedigree (albeit contrived by adoption).

Mac arranges to have Otto adopted by an impoverished count, who now works as a washroom attendant and includes a photo of the family castle with the price of adoption (destroyed in the 17th century by the Ottoman Turks). Scarlett is dubious that her father will be fooled by the ruse, but is reassured that her baby will now be part of a long line of bleeders, which will please her snobbish mother. In a frenetic race against time and the arrival of the Hazeltines&#x27; plane, Mac outfits Otto in complete paraphernalia befitting his new aristocratic status, while Otto rails against being forced to join the detested bourgeoisie (his Communist Party membership is paid up through the year). Meanwhile, Scarlett and Mac coach Otto on how to speak to her conservative Southern father (&quot;The Civil War was a draw...&quot;).

In the end, the Hazeltines approve of their new son-in-law, Otto, who Mac learns from Hazeltine will be named the new head of Western European Operations, with a disappointed Mac getting a promotion to VP of Procurement back in Atlanta. Mac reconciles with his family at the airport, and to celebrate his promotion, buys them Cokes from a vending machine. After handing out the bottles, he discovers that the last one actually is a Pepsi-Cola.

==Cast==
==Production==

Cagney decided to take the role primarily because it was to be shot in Germany: while growing up in Manhattan&#x27;s Yorkville neighborhood, he had had fond memories of the area, which was &quot;teeming with German immigrants.&quot; Horst Buchholz was a young European actor who had recently finished &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; with Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach and Steve McQueen; during the production, he became the only actor that Cagney ever openly disliked.

Wilder was filming in Berlin the morning the Berlin Wall went up, forcing the crew to move to Munich. During principal photography, Wilder received a call from Joan Crawford, recently appointed to the board of directors of Pepsi-Cola following her husband Alfred Steele&#x27;s death. In response to Crawford&#x27;s protests over the use of the Coca-Cola brand in the film, Wilder scattered some references to Pepsi, including the final scene. Some scenes were shot at Bavaria Film Studios.

The theatrical release poster for the film, with a woman holding three balloons, was designed by Saul Bass. The Bass designed poster that Wilder originally intended for the film&#x27;s release featured a United States style flag sticking out of a Coca-Cola-style bottle. The poster had to be replaced, however, when Coca-Cola threatened legal action against United Artists for copyright infringement.

==Soundtrack==
Aram Khachaturian&#x27;s lively &quot;Sabre Dance&quot; marks the moments when Mac moves into energetic action (Ingeborg&#x27;s table dance at Grand Hotel Potemkin and car chase) and is also played during the opening credits. The &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot; is played on the way to the Grand Hotel Potemkin. The conductor of the orchestra sings a German language version of &quot;Yes! We Have No Bananas&quot; on the arrival of Mac at the Grand Hotel Potemkin.

==Release==
When the movie opened, it came with a spoken preface by Cagney, added by Wilder:

On Sunday, August 13th, 1961, the eyes of America were on the nation&#x27;s capital, where Roger Maris was hitting home runs No. 44 and 45 against the Senators. On that same day, without any warning, the East German Communists sealed off the border between East and West Berlin. I only mention this to show the kind of people we&#x27;re dealing with—&quot;real shifty&quot;.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Critic Bosley Crowther applauded the work of Cagney and wrote,

With all due respect for all the others, all of whom are very good—Pamela Tiffin, a new young beauty, as Scarlett; Horst Buchholz as the East Berlin boy, Lilo Pulver as a German secretary, Leon Askin as a Communist stooge and several more—the burden is carried by Mr. Cagney, who is a good 50 per cent of the show. He has seldom worked so hard in any picture or had such a browbeating ball. His fellow is a free-wheeling rascal. His wife (Arlene Francis) hates his guts. He knows all the ways of beating the rackets and has no compunctions about their use. He is brutishly bold and brassy, wildly ingenious and glib. Mr. Cagney makes you mistrust him—but he sure makes you laugh with him. And that&#x27;s about the nature of the picture. It is one with which you can laugh—with its own impudence toward foreign crises—while laughing at its rowdy spinning jokes.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine called it a &quot;yell-mell, hard-sell, Sennett-with-a-sound-track satire of iron curtains and color lines, of people&#x27;s demockeracy, Coca-Colonization, peaceful , and the Deep Southern concept that all facilities are created separate but equal.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; notes Wilder &quot;purposely neglects the high precision of hilarity that made &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; a screwball classic and &quot;The Apartment&quot; a peerless comedy of officemanship. But in the rapid, brutal, whambam style of a man swatting flies with a pile driver, he has produced a sometimes , often wonderfully funny exercise in nonstop nuttiness.&quot; The film won kudos from the staff at &quot;Variety.&quot; They wrote, &quot;Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; is a fast-paced, high-pitched, hard-hitting, lighthearted farce crammed with topical gags and spiced with satirical overtones. Story is so furiously quick-witted that some of its wit gets snarled and smothered in overlap. But total experience packs a considerable wallop.&quot; Pauline Kael, on the other hand, dismissed the film as a tiresome succession of stale and inane gags. She was also bemused by what seemed to her the forced enthusiasm of the favorable reviews.

According to J. Hoberman, screenwriter Abby Mann (who wrote &quot;Judgment at Nuremberg&quot;) &quot;deemed Wilder&#x27;s [film] so tasteless, he felt obliged to apologize for it at the Moscow Film Festival.&quot;

===Box office===
&quot;One, Two, Three&quot; did not do well at either the U.S. or German box office. The lighthearted East-West Berlin story felt much more sinister at the release, since the Berlin Wall had been built after principal photography began. It earned rentals over $2 million in the US and Canada. 

The film recorded a loss of $1.6 million. However, it was re-released in 1985 in France and West Germany and became a box office success, especially in West Berlin.

===Censorship===
&quot;One, Two, Three&quot; was banned in Finland, which had a policy of Finlandization, from 1962 to 1986 on &quot;political&quot; grounds — it was feared that the film would harm relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. United Pictures Finland tried to get the film released theatrically in 1962, 1966 and 1969 but it was only in 1986 that the Finnish Board of Film Classification allowed the film to be distributed.

===Awards===
Nominations
* Academy Awards: Oscar, Best Cinematography, Black-and-White, Daniel L. Fapp; 1962.
* Golden Globes: Golden Globe, Best Motion Picture – Comedy; Best Supporting Actress, Pamela Tiffin; 1962.
* Laurel Awards: Golden Laurel, Top Comedy, 4th place; Top Male Comedy Performance, James Cagney, 4th place; 1962.
* Writers Guild of America Awards: Best Written American Comedy (Screen), Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond; 1962.

===Homages and references===
* The film makes several references to Cagney&#x27;s earlier films, including a Cagney impression from Red Buttons, and the grapefruit-to-the-face incident from &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;. Additionally, the cuckoo clock in MacNamara&#x27;s office plays &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;. Cagney also refers to his contemporary Edward G. Robinson by using Robinson&#x27;s line &quot;Mother of Mercy, is this the end of Rico?&quot; from &quot;Little Caesar&quot;, which was a competitor of &quot;The Public Enemy&quot;.
* The Cold War is referenced, with one joke spoken by an &quot;apparatchik&quot; seeming to foreshadow the Cuban Missile Crisis: &quot;We have trade agreement with Cuba: they send us cigars, we send them rockets.&quot; When Cagney&#x27;s character retorts that they are &quot;pretty crummy cigars,&quot; the Russian replies that they send the Cubans &quot;pretty crummy rockets.&quot;
* Cagney noted that he quit Hollywood after this film due to fatigue from an inordinate number of lines in a lengthy movie helmed by a demanding Wilder and to a feeling of jealousy when he heard from a friend about to set off on a leisurely yachting trip.
* In the 2015 Steven Spielberg-directed film about an incident in the cold war, &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, there is a scene with a Berlin movie-house showing the film &quot;Eins, Zwei, Drei&quot; in the background.

==Re-releases==
&quot;One, Two, Three&quot; aired on &quot;The ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; on January 31, 1965. It was received enthusiastically in Germany upon its 1985 re-release in cinemas. &quot;One, Two, Three&quot; was given a grand re-première at a large outdoor showing in West Berlin which was broadcast simultaneously on television. The film went on to spend a year in West Berlin cinemas, where it was rediscovered by West Berlin citizens.

<doc id="660345" wikidata="Q7690983" url="?curid=660345" title="2004 Te Tai Hauauru by-election">
<text>The Te Tai Hauauru by-election was a by-election in the New Zealand electorate of Te Tai Hauāuru, one of the Māori electorates. The date set for the by-election was 10 July 2004. It saw the re-election of Tariana Turia, a former MP for the Labour Party and now co-leader of the Māori Party.

Turia had quit both Parliament and the Labour Party in protest over the government&#x27;s position in the foreshore and seabed controversy. She contested the by-election as a member of the new Māori Party, which she played a leading role in establishing. None of the major parties contested the by-election, and Turia was always the overwhelming favourite to win. Perhaps due to the apparent inevitability of a win for Turia, only around 32% of Te Tai Hauauru voters cast ballots.

Nominations for the by-election closed on 15 June 2004. Candidates were:
* Tariana Turia (Māori Party)
* Peter Wakeman, a Labour Party member who stood as an independent.
* Dun Mihaka (Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party), a veteran Māori activist best known for baring his buttocks to the Queen on her 1983 Royal Tour of New Zealand.
* Tahu Nepia, who stood as an independent, but represented the Ratana movement, with the intent of establishing an Independent Ratana Party to contest the next general election.
* Rusty Kane, an independent who campaigned on the platform that Māori electorates should be abolished.
* David Bolton, independent.

If no candidates had been put forward to oppose Turia, she would have been declared the winner without a vote – this initially appeared possible, and given the cost of a by-election (estimated at almost NZ$500,000), many hoped that a vote could be avoided.

The holding of a by-election was criticised by a number other parties. The Labour Party, of which Turia was originally a member (and which has traditionally dominated the Māori electorates) has called the by-election &quot;a waste of time and money&quot;, and a &quot;sideshow&quot; although the by-election was required by Labour-supported waka-jumping law in force at the time. Labour nominated Errol Mason to contest the seat at the subsequent 2005 general election, losing to Turia.

<text>The white-bellied blue flycatcher (Cyornis pallidipes) is a small passerine bird in the flycatcher family Muscicapidae. It is endemic to the Western Ghats (including the Nilgiris) of southwest India. Males are dark blue with a lighter shade of blue on the brow and have a greyish white belly. Females have a rufous breast, a white face and olive grey above.

==Description==
This flycatcher is about long and has a longish beak. It forages in the undergrowth in the shade of dense forest canopy where it makes aerial forays to capture insects. The male is indigo blue with ultramarine blue supercilium and forehead. The lores and face are dark grey. The belly is white and bordered by smoky grey wash. The female is olive brown above with whitish lores. The rufous throat and breast fades to white towards the belly. The female has a chestnut tail and can be told apart from other flycatchers like by the lack of the black and white tail pattern. In poor lighting and within the Palni Hills it can be confusable with the white-bellied blue robin, which however has longer legs and is more likely to be seen on the ground.

==Distribution ==

The white-bellied blue flycatcher occurs in dense forest and sholas south from Mahabaleshwar through the Western Ghats, extending into the Nilgiris and the Biligirirangan Hills, down to southern Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It is found mainly in the hill forests from the foothills to about 1700 m in the Nilgiris.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The white-bellied blue flycatcher tends to be quiet and inactive, foraging mainly in the dark shade below the forest canopy. They have a very low song that can be heard only at close quarters. The song is a rambling series of rising and falling broken notes interspersed with clicks and squeaks. They are usually seen singly or in pairs and are often found to join mixed-species foraging flocks.

The breeding season is from February to September, mainly during the monsoon. The nest is a rough cup of moss neatly lined on the inside and placed low on a moss covered rock, hole in tree or mud-bank. The usual clutch is four eggs which are pale sea-green with brown spotting, denser on the broad end.

<doc id="660350" wikidata="Q313439" url="?curid=660350" title="Gaius (jurist)">
<text>Gaius (; &quot;fl.&quot; AD 130–180) was a Roman jurist. Little is known about his personal life, including his name (Gaius or Caius being merely his personal name (&quot;praenomen&quot;)). It is also difficult to ascertain the span of his life, but it is assumed he lived from AD 130 to at least AD 179, as he wrote on legislation passed within that time. 

From internal evidence in his works it may be gathered that he flourished in the reigns of the emperors Hadrian, Antoninus Pius, Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. His works were thus composed between the years 130 and 180. After his death, however, his writings were recognized as of great authority, and the emperor Theodosius II named him in the &quot;Law of Citations,&quot; along with Papinian, Ulpian, Modestinus and Paulus, as one of the five jurists whose opinions were to be followed by judicial officers in deciding cases. The works of these jurists accordingly became most important sources of Roman law.

Besides the &quot;Institutes&quot;, which are a complete exposition of the elements of Roman law, Gaius was the author of treatises on the &quot;Edicts of the Magistrates&quot;, on the Twelve Tables (), on the important &quot;Lex Papia Poppaea&quot;, and on several other topics. His interest in the antiquities of Roman law is apparent, and for this reason his work is most valuable to the historian of early institutions. In the disputes between the two schools of Roman jurists he generally attached himself to that of the Sabinians, who were said to be followers of Ateius Capito, of whose life we have some account in the &quot;Annals&quot; of Tacitus, and to advocate a strict adherence as far as possible to ancient rules, and to resist innovation. Many quotations from the works of Gaius occur in the &quot;Digest,&quot; created by Tribonian at the direction of Justinian I, and so acquired a permanent place in the system of Roman law; while a comparison of the &quot;Institutes of Justinian&quot; with those of Gaius shows that the whole method and arrangement of the later work were copied from that of the earlier, and very numerous passages are word for word the same. The &quot;Digest&quot; and the &quot;Institutes of Justinian&quot; are part of the &quot;Corpus Juris Civilis.&quot; Probably, for the greater part of the period of three centuries which elapsed between Gaius and Justinian, his &quot;Institutes&quot; had been the familiar textbook for all students of Roman law.

==The &quot;Institutes&quot; ==

The &quot;Institutes&quot; of Gaius, written about the year AD 161, was an introductory textbook of legal institutions divided into four books: the first treating of persons and the differences of the status they may occupy in the eye of the law; the second of things, and the modes in which rights over them may be acquired, including the law relating to wills; the third of intestate succession and of obligations; and the fourth of actions and their forms.

Another circumstance which renders the work of Gaius more interesting to the historical student than that of Justinian, is that Gaius lived at a time when actions were tried by the system of &quot;formulae&quot;, or formal directions given by the &quot;praetor&quot; before whom the case first came, to the &quot;judex&quot; to whom he referred it. Without a knowledge of the terms of these &quot;formulae&quot; it is impossible to solve the most interesting question in the history of Roman law, and show how the rigid rules peculiar to the ancient law of Rome were modified by what has been called the equitable jurisdiction of the praetors, and made applicable to new conditions, and brought into harmony with the notions and the needs of a more developed society. It is clear from evidence of Gaius that this result was obtained, not by an independent set of courts administering, as in England previous to the Judicature Acts, a system different from that of the ordinary courts, but by the manipulation of the &quot;formulae&quot;. In the time of Justinian the work was complete, and the formulary system had disappeared.

The work was lost to modern scholars, until, in 1816, a palimpsest was discovered by B. G. Niebuhr in the chapter library of Verona, in which some of the works of St. Jerome were written over some earlier writings, which proved to be the lost work of Gaius. The greater part of the palimpsest has, however, been deciphered with the help of August von Bethmann-Hollweg, and the text is now fairly complete. More recently, two sets of papyrus fragments have been found. The discovery of Gaius&#x27; work has thrown a flood of light on portions of the history of Roman law which had previously been most obscure. Much of the historical information given by Gaius is wanting in the compilations of Justinian, and, in particular, the account of the ancient forms of procedure in actions. In these forms can be traced &quot;survivals&quot; from the most primitive times, which provide the science of comparative law with valuable illustrations, which may explain the strange forms of legal procedure found in other early systems.

There are several editions of the &quot;Institutes&quot;, beginning with the &quot;editio princeps&quot; of I. F. L. Göschen (Berlin, 1820). The author of the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica article recommends the English edition of Edward Poste published in 1885, which includes an English translation and copious commentary. More recent editions include E. Seckel and B. Kuebler (8th edition; Leipzig, 1939); Francis de Zulueta, containing his own Latin text with an English translation and commentary (1946); and W. M. Gordon and O. F. Robinson (London, 1988), with an English translation and the Latin text by Seckel and Kuebler. A comparison of the early forms of action mentioned by Gaius with those used by other primitive societies will be found in Sir Henry Maine&#x27;s &quot;Early Institutions&quot;, chapter 9. For further information see M. Glasson, &quot;Étude sur Gaius et sur le jus respondendi&quot;.

== Relief ==
In the 1950s, the Polish-American sculptor Joseph Kiselewski was commissioned to create four marble reliefs located over the gallery doorway at the Chambers of the U.S. House of Representatives in Washington D.C. They are each 28&quot; in diameter. The relief of Gaius is one of the four.

<doc id="660353" wikidata="Q591534" url="?curid=660353" title="British Forces Post Office">
<text>The British Forces Post Office (BFPO) provides a postal service to HM Forces separate from that provided by Royal Mail in the United Kingdom. BFPO addresses are used for the delivery of mail in the UK and around the world. BFPO moved from its original base at Inglis Barracks, Mill Hill to its current base at RAF Northolt in west London in 2007.

British Forces Post Office status as an agency of the Ministry of Defence ended on 1 April 2007, when it became part of Defence Equipment &amp; Support.

== BFPO addresses and numbers ==
Below is an example of a BFPO address, using the fictitious Loamshire Regiment:

 12345678 LCPL B Jones
 B Company
 1 Loamshire Regt
 BFPO 61

BFPO 61 is for Milan, Italy. Until the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, Hong Kong used postal orders with BFPO 1 being the address for British forces serving in the then colony.

When sending mail from the UK to a member of HM Forces serving overseas, the sender must address it to the appropriate BFPO number, and not to the country in which that person is based. This is especially important as mail to BFPO addresses is often charged at the inland UK rate, and if it is addressed to an overseas destination with only UK postage attached, this will result in delays.

For security reasons, mail from HM Forces to civilian addresses in Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland must be handed directly to BFPO staff, not placed in the post box, and must not have a return military address displayed on the envelope. In addition, mail to those destinations cannot be sent using the Bluey system.

In 2012, in collaboration with Royal Mail, the BFPO introduced UK-style postcodes, to help ordering items online, owing to problems with websites not recognising the BFPO addressing format. The addresses are assigned to the notional post town &quot;BFPO&quot; and, as of 2012, the postcodes all begin with &quot;BF1&quot;. For example, the above address would appear as:

 12345678 LCPL B Jones
 B Company
 1 Loamshire Regt
 BFPO 61
 BFPO
 BF1 2AY

These UK style postcodes are provided for compatibility with non-BFPO UK addresses and are solely for use within websites, due to the automated sorting process at BFPO they should not appear on items of mail.

== The &quot;e-Bluey&quot; ==
To speed up the delivery to HM Forces, the BFPO developed a hybrid form of mail, known as the &#x27;e-Bluey&#x27;, in which letters can be sent directly by internet to the British Armed Forces serving in theatre. The letters are downloaded and printed and then dispatched to the recipient via the traditional military postal system. Letters sent by serving Armed Forces members to family and friends in the UK (from Operational Theatres) are downloaded and printed at various locations in the UK and then delivered to the Royal Mail for final delivery.

The name, e-bluey, comes from the aerograms that are (still) provided for troops on active service and their families at home. Self-adhesive strips along the edges of the paper allowed it to be folded and sealed without the added weight of an envelope, meaning that more of them could be carried by air or by hand for the same total weight. Because of the blue paper these were nicknamed &quot;blueys&quot;, and the name came to carry something of an emotional charge due to the significance of receiving a possibly rare bluey from a loved one. &quot;e-Bluey&quot; was thus a natural term for the BFPO&#x27;s electronic hybrid mail system.

The e-blueys are downloaded from an e-bluey web server (www.ebluey.com) and utilises Pressure Sealed forms that are printed and sealed with an integrated Printer/Sealer. This ensures maximum security and privacy and the correspondence is not censored or reviewed.

The e-bluey was first conceived by Brigadier Barry Cash, CE of the British Forces Post Office (now retired). He assigned the initial development to Major Roy Walker MBE (now retired) in the late 1990s. The service was activated the week before Christmas of 2000. Photo capability was added in 2005, allowing senders to attach personal photos to their e-blueys.

In the spring of 2003, during the first three months of the Invasion of Iraq, over 250,000 e-blueys were sent per month, a record that still stands. The e-bluey became ubiquitous. By the time it was replaced, it accounted for 80% of the flat mail delivered to troops in theatre. e-Blueys were available in numerous locations around the globe plus on operational Navy ships.

The e-bluey system was supported by SuperLetter.Com Inc. who wrote the software and managed the servers for the e-bluey system. The system won several awards, including BFPO e-bluey System Winner 2001 World Mail Award, BFPO e-bluey System Winner 2005 UK Mail Award, and BFPO 2007 UK Mail Award for Technology.

The e-bluey equipment was maintained by Technical Support Services (TSS), a department within BFPO London, since its inception.

The e-bluey service ceased in April 2017. It was replaced by the INtouch message service.

==Postal orders==
One of the services that is provided by some of the British Forces Post Offices is the issuing and cashing of postal orders. A British postal order issued at a forces post office is very sought after by collectors of postal orders.

A postal order issued by a BFPO in a Commonwealth country, such as the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus, is regarded as being a part of the numismatic and notaphilic history of that country.

== History of the British Army postal services ==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; make mention of messengers being sent by King Edward the Elder (899–924) to recall members of the Kent fyrd, but it is generally regarded that the origins of the postal services stem from the King&#x27;s Messengers (&quot;Nuncii et Cursores&quot;) of medieval times. In particular the Royal Post established in the reign of King Edward IV (1461–83) to support his troops engaged in a war against Scotland.

A dedicated military postal unit, the Army Post Office Corps was formed in 1882. In 1913 it was subsumed into the Royal Engineers as the Royal Engineers (Postal Section) and in late 1990s became the BFPO. Today, all services are provided by BFPO.

<doc id="660356" wikidata="Q230561" url="?curid=660356" title="Adelaide of Maurienne">
<text>Adelaide of Maurienne, also called Alix or Adele (1092 – 18 November 1154) was Queen of France as the second wife of King Louis VI (1115–1137).

==Family==
Adelaide was the daughter of Count Humbert II of Savoy and Gisela of Burgundy. Adelaide&#x27;s older brother Amadeus III succeeded their father as count of Savoy in 1103. Adelaide had the same name as her paternal great-grandmother Adelaide of Susa, ruler of the March of Turin, and her second cousin, Adelaide del Vasto, queen of Jerusalem. Through her father, Adelaide was also related to Emperor Henry V. On her mother&#x27;s side, Adelaide&#x27;s relatives included her uncle Pope Callixtus II, who visited Adelaide at court in France, and her first cousin King Alfonso VII of León and Castile.

==Queen Consort==
Adelaide became the second wife of King Louis VI of France, whom she married on 3 August 1115 in Paris, France. They had nine children, the second of whom became Louis VII of France. 

Adelaide was one of the most politically active of all France&#x27;s medieval queens. Her name appears on 45 royal charters from the reign of Louis VI. During her tenure as queen, royal charters were dated with both her regnal year and that of the king. Among many other religious benefactions, she and Louis founded the monastery of St Peter&#x27;s (Ste Pierre) at Montmartre, in the northern suburbs of Paris.

After Louis VI&#x27;s death, Adelaide did not immediately retire to conventual life, as did most widowed queens of the time. Instead, she married Matthieu I of Montmorency, with whom she had one child. She remained active in the French court and religious activities.

==Death==
In 1153 she retired to Montmartre Abbey, which she had founded with Louis VII. She died there on 18 November 1154. She was buried in the cemetery of the Church of St. Pierre at Montmartre. The abbey was destroyed during the French Revolution, but Adelaide&#x27;s tomb is still visible in the church of St Pierre.

==Legend==
Adelaide is one of two queens in a legend related in the seventeenth century by William Dugdale. As the story goes, Queen Adélaide of France became enamored of a young knight, William d&#x27;Albini, at a joust. However, he was already engaged to Adeliza of Louvain and refused to become her lover. The jealous Adélaide lured him into the clutches of a hungry lion, but William ripped out the beast&#x27;s tongue with his bare hands and thus killed it. This story is almost without a doubt, apocryphal.

==Issue==
Louis and Adelaide had seven sons and two daughters:
# Philip of France (1116–1131)
# Louis VII (1120 – 18 November 1180), King of France
# Henry (1121–1175), Archbishop of Reims
# Hugues (b. c. 1122)
# Robert (c. 1123 – 11 October 1188), Count of Dreux
# Constance (c. 1124–16 August 1176), married first Eustace IV, Count of Boulogne and then Raymond V of Toulouse
# Philip (1125–1161), Bishop of Paris.
# Peter (c. 1126 – 1183), married Elizabeth, Lady of Courtenay
# a daughter, whose name is not known, who died in infancy and was interred at the Abbey of Saint-Victor, Paris

With Matthieu I of Montmorency, Adelaide had one daughter:

<doc id="660358" wikidata="Q11976756" url="?curid=660358" title="Ian Macfarlane (economist)">
<text>Ian John Macfarlane (born 22 June 1946) is an Australian economist, and central banker. After an early career as an economist in Melbourne, Sydney, Oxford and Paris, he joined the Reserve Bank of Australia in 1979 and rose to become Governor from 1996 to 2006. After retiring from the Reserve Bank, he became a company director, economic consultant and author of two books.

== Education and early career ==
Macfarlane moved to Melbourne at the age of three and lived there until he was twenty three. He was educated at Melbourne High School and Monash University, Melbourne, from which he received the Bachelor of Economics degree with honours in 1968, and the Master of Economics degree in 1971. While completing his master&#x27;s degree he taught at Monash University. He moved to Sydney in 1970 on a short-term contract with the Reserve Bank of Australia to join a team building the first econometric model of the Australian economy. When his contract finished, he moved to England and from 1971–72 he worked at the Institute of Economics and Statistics at the University of Oxford. Following this, he then moved to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, where he served until 1978.

== Reserve Bank of Australia ==
Macfarlane returned to Australia and became a permanent employee of the Reserve Bank&#x27;s Research Department in 1979. In 1981 he was made its deputy manager. In 1983, six months before the float of the Australian dollar, he moved to the Financial Markets Department where his work involved close interaction with the money, bond and foreign exchange markets. In 1988 he returned to head the Economics Department to a position now known as Assistant Governor (Economic).

In 1992 he was appointed Deputy Governor by the Keating government, and in 1996, he was appointed Governor by the Howard government. On taking up the position, he signed a memorandum of Agreement with Treasurer Peter Costello which introduced Australia&#x27;s inflation-targeting monetary policy regime. The ten years during which Macfarlane was Governor was a period of good economic growth and low inflation, although the Asian financial crisis in 1997, the global recession of 2001 and an incipient housing price bubble in 2003 presented challenges. On Macfarlane&#x27;s retirement in 2006, Treasurer Peter Costello, said: &quot;Ian Macfarlane has been an exceptionally successful governor of the Reserve Bank ... and when history of the last ten years is written, it will show as one of, if not the greatest periods of economic management in Australian history.&quot; Prime Minister John Howard wrote in his autobiography &quot;Macfarlane was the stand-out economic official in the lifetime of my government. His advice and sense of balance was far superior to that of anybody else who provided economic advice to us&quot;.

== Post-Reserve Bank Career ==
After retiring from the RBA Macfarlane was appointed as a director of three public companies - Woolworths (2007-2015), Leighton Holdings (2007-2013) and ANZ Bank (2007-2016). He was also on the International Advisory Boards of Goldman Sachs (2007-2016) and the China Banking Regulatory Commission (2011-2014). He continued to be a director of the Lowy Institute for International Policy (2004-2017).

Immediately after leaving the RBA, he was chosen to deliver the Boyer Lectures for 2006. This series of six lectures, which combines both history and economics, was published as a book titled &quot;The Search for Stability&quot;&quot;.&quot;

Macfarlane has always been interested in history, and in 2019 published a purely historical work titled &quot;Ten Remarkable Australians: they made their mark on the world but were forgotten.&quot; This is a series of biographical essays on ten Australians born before Federation who achieved international prominence in the first half of the 1900s.

== Awards and honours ==
== Personal ==
Macfarlane married Barbara Heather Payne in 1970. They have two children, a son Duncan and daughter Victoria and six grandchildren, Andrew, Abby, Oscar, Alice, James and Olivia.

<doc id="660379" wikidata="Q193704" url="?curid=660379" title="Saint-Briac-sur-Mer">
<text>Saint-Briac-sur-Mer (, literally &quot;Saint-Briac on Sea&quot;; ; Gallo: &quot;Saent-Beriac&quot;), is a commune in the Ille-et-Vilaine Department in Brittany in northwestern France.

==Population==

Inhabitants of Saint-Briac-sur-Mer are called &quot;briacins&quot; in French.
==Climate==
St Briac lies on the Gulf Stream which means it enjoys a warm climate, several degrees warmer than the surrounding areas. The village has fine examples of tropical palms and plants, along the streets, making strolls very enjoyable.

== Leisure ==
Saint Briac has two campsites, seven beaches, four tennis courts, one soccer field, a yacht club, one mini golf, one 18 hole golf course, and more than 5 restaurants.

==History==
The name Saint Briac comes from the name of Saint Briag, an Irishman. Briag arrived from Ireland with Saint Tugdual in around 548.

On 4 and 5 September 1758, a British fleet of 113 ships under the command of Admiral Richard Howe, landed east of the Garde Guerin, in Saint Briac. With a force of more than 12,000 men, under the command of General Thomas Bligh, who accompanied the Duke of York, the future king George III, they established camp in neighboring St Lunaire, but not before pillaging and burning down more than half of Saint Briac.

Le Chateau du Nessay (seen below) was built on an emplacement of a castle originating from the 12th century. During the French Revolution, it was used as a prison, to hold political prisoners.

St Briac was called Port Briac during the French Revolution.

Though France requires since 1976 that all beaches be public and that shoreside owners let people pass, wealthy owners of Saint-Briac-sur-Mer don&#x27;t allow it and have been fighting the law in court ever since, including John Kerry&#x27;s family.

The Forbes family estate, called Les Essarts was bombed during World War II. Les Essarts was rebuilt in 1954.

==Politics==
Brice Lalonde, a former Green Party candidate for president of France, was mayor of this wealthy resort village from 1989 to 2008.

Lalonde and his first cousin, U.S. Senator John Kerry, are grandsons of James Grant Forbes, an heir of the Forbes family of China and Boston. James Grant Forbes was born in Shanghai and later moved to France where the Forbes family estate is located. Kerry and Lalonde were childhood friends on the estate in Saint Briac.

The current mayor is Vincent Denby Wilkes

The area was traditionally settled by Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki, and in 1847 Howick was established as a defensive settlement for Auckland, by veteran fencible soldiers of the British Army. Howick was a small agricultural centre until the 1950s, when it developed into a suburban area of Auckland.

==Geography==
Howick is located in the central peninsula of East Auckland, between the Tāmaki River and Tāmaki Strait of the Hauraki Gulf. Waipaparoa / Howick Beach is located to the north-east of the suburb, adjacent to Mellons Bay in the west and Cockle Bay in the east. Waipaparoa / Howick Beach looks out towards the Tāmaki Strait, Waiheke Island, Motukaraka Island and Beachlands. The soil around Howick is primarily clay and sandstone.

== Etymology ==

Howick was named after Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey, a name chosen by Governor George Grey in 1847. The Earl was formerly known as Viscount Howick, and his family home in Alnwick, Northumberland. Earl Grey was the Secretary of State for the Colonies who decided to settle British Army veterans in settlements around Auckland. The traditional Tāmaki Māori names for the coastal area were Paparoa and Waipaparoa, and Ōwairoa was used to describe the swampy inland area where the Howick village was established. The names Howick, Owairoa and Paparoa were used interchangeably by European settlers until 1923, when the Howick Town Board was established.

== History ==

===Māori history===
The Tāmaki Strait was visited by the &quot;Tainui&quot; migratory waka around the year 1300, and members of the crew settled around East Auckland and the Pōhutukawa Coast. These were the ancestors of the modern mana whenua of the area, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki. The traditional names for the beach and surrounding bay are Paparoa and Waipaparoa, with Waipaparoa referring to the wider bay between modern-day Howick and Beachlands, including the Turanga Creek. The Howick area was extensively cultivated, but as the area was relatively exposed, two fortified pā were constructed: Paparoa Pā at the south-eastern end of Waipaparoa / Howick Beach, and Tūwakamana Pā above Cockle Bay. In addition to agriculture, the Waipaparoa / Howick Beach area was known for (shortspine spurdog sharks), which were caught in the near-by estuaries and dried at the beach. In the 1600s, the warrior Kāwharu attacked and razed Paparoa Pā, without taking occupation of the lands. While the wider area was still cultivated, the site of Paparoa Pā became a wāhi tapu (sacred and restricted) site to Ngāi Tai.

In 1836, English Missionary William Thomas Fairburn brokered a land sale between Tāmaki Māori chiefs, Pōtatau Te Wherowhero and Turia of Ngāti Te Rau, covering the majority of modern-day South Auckland, East Auckland and the Pōhutukawa Coast. The sale was envisioned by the church and the chiefs as a way to end hostilities in the area, but it is unclear what the chiefs understood or consented to. Māori continued to live in the area, unchanged by this sale. Fairburn&#x27;s Purchase was investigated by the New Zealand Land Commission found to be excessive and reduced in size. The disallowed parts of his purchase were not returned to Ngāi Tai, however in 1854 a reserve was created for Ngāi Tai around the Wairoa River and Umupuia. As a part of this arrangement, Ngāi Tai agreed not to settle elsewhere in the region, which included Howick.

===Establishment of Howick===

Howick was established in 1847 as a defensive outpost for Auckland, by fencibles (retired British Army soldiers) and their families. Governor George Grey, Bishop George Selwyn, Major Mathew Richmond and Felton Mathew chose the site in October 1847, at a location known to early colonists as Owairoa. The decision to establish on site was controversial. It was allegedly chosen to protect Auckland against potential invasion from Marutūāhu tribes to the east, but the site was too far inland to serve this purpose. As the Crown owned the entirety of the land at Howick, the Government could directly profit from the land sales to fencible settlers.

The fencibles arrived between 1847 and 1852, with the first ships arriving at Waiapaparoa / Howick Beach. Early settlers struggled to establish themselves on the land. Almost no trees were found in the district that could be used for construction, and the soil was primarily clay, compared to other fencible settlements such as Ōtāhuhu and Panmure that were established on volcanic soils more suitable for farming. In 1849 when William Fox of the New Zealand Company visited Howick, he described the settlement as a costly failure. The settlers were promised that houses would be constructed for their families, however this had not occurred by their arrival. The first cottages were constructed from raupō with help from Ngāi Tai, and by December 1849 most of these had been replaced with wooden cottages.

The fencible settlers were primarily poor, and were evenly split between Catholic and Protestant families. All Saints Church was constructed in Howick in 1847, as the first Anglican parish church in Auckland. The Government was widely criticised for not providing many employment opportunities for the fencible settlers. Early settlers often found work on Government projects such as road construction, drainage or clearing allotments, while others worked for farmers. Many fencibles lived in Auckland for work, but were obliged to return to Howick on Sundays, otherwise they could be charged with mutiny under the Fencibles Act. 

Howick village developed around the Howick Domain, and grew overtime to become a service centre for the surrounding rural areas. The settlers were dependent on water transport and ferry services, until the construction of the Panmure Bridge across the Tāmaki River in 1865. Howick was developed into an English-style village by the settlers, becoming known as an area where potatoes and butter were produced. In the 1850s and 1860s the Howick District Acclimation Society worked to introduce English birds such as the thrush and blackbird to the area, to develop an English atmosphere and as a measure to combat caterpillars in the orchards of the area.

By 1854, many of the fencibles had completed their required seven years of service. Most stayed in Howick, with some moving to Auckland, the gold mine towns of the Coromandel Peninsula, or new defensive settlements to the south, such as Hunua, Papakura and Pukekawa.

In April 1861, news reached the village of the imminent Invasion of the Waikato. By July 1863, a defensive blockhouse was constructed in Howick, and 101 fencibles and their sons served in the war. In September 1863, the Ngāi Tai village of Ōtau near Clevedon was attacked by the British army, and the village was evacuated, with people moving to communities at the river&#x27;s mouth. While Māori of South Auckland such as Te Ākitai Waiohua were forced to leave, Ngāi Tai were designated as a &quot;friendly&quot; people by the Crown, and remained neutral in the fighting. After the Native Lands Act of 1865, the Native Land Court confiscated many Ngāi Tai lands. The remaining land was individuated, slowly sold on to European farmers.

The first local government was established in the area in 1862, with the creation of the Howick Township Road Board.

In 1865, the capital of New Zealand was moved from Auckland to Wellington. This caused major financial problems for the residents of Howick, as income from butter dropped and land prices plummeted. By 1880, the population of the village had dropped to 220, down from 775 in 1848. The Howick Town Hall was constructed in 1884, and a number of social organisations such as the Howick Musical Association and Howick Cricket Club were established during this period.

=== Suburban development ===

Until the 1920s, Howick had the reputation of being a sleepy English-style village. By 1921, the village had grown enough to become a town district within the Manukau County. In the 1930s after a concrete road was constructed between Howick and Greenlane, Howick developed into a suburb for people working in Penrose, Westfield and Ōtāhuhu. Howick village held fundraising carnivals from the 1930s to the 1950s known as Queens Carnivals, where beauty pageants were held to choose an annual queen from the community to represent Howick businesses.

After World War II, many Dutch New Zealanders settled in Howick. The population had slowly grown to 1,500 when the settlement celebrated its centenary in 1947. In 1952, Howick split from the Manukau County to form its own borough. Major suburban growth occurred in Howick in the 1960s and 1970s, including the development of new suburbs in the surrounding areas. In the 1980s and 1990s, Howick developed as a location for Asian migrant communities. Entrepreneur Kit Wong established 100 shops at the Meadowlands shopping plaza, which included a number of businesses run by Chinese and Thai immigrants, such as restaurants.

==Government==

===Howick electorate===
From 1993 and prior to the introduction of MMP in 1996, Howick had its own seat in Parliament, Howick; which had been created from part of the former Otara electorate.

In the 1996 general election, due to the need to decrease the number of general electorates to ensure a sufficient number of seats were available for list MPs, the population centres formerly in the Howick seat were merged into the former separate seat of Pakuranga.

While making recommendations for the boundaries to apply in the 2008 general election, the Electoral Commission recently proposed to resurrect the Howick seat. The planned seat would have taken in the population centres of Howick and Botany Downs-Dannemora but would have had the effect of splitting Bucklands Beach and Highland Park across two electorates. Due to this, and the planned move to incorporate Panmure, Point England and Glen Innes into the neighbouring Pakuranga seat, the commission received a significant number of objections from Pakuranga residents. The Commission eventually adopted the recommendation of Objector N17/30 in keeping the Howick suburb in Pakuranga and renaming the new seat Botany, with a corresponding shift in centre of gravity to the new suburb of Flat Bush.
===Local government===

The first local government in the area was the Howick Township Road Board, which was established in 1862. By 1921, the village had grown enough to become a town district within the Manukau County, becoming a borough in 1952. As a part of the 1989 New Zealand local government reforms, Howick Borough was incorporated into Manukau City. In November 2010, all cities and districts of the Auckland region were amalgamated into a single body, governed by the Auckland Council.

Howick is part of the Howick local board area, who elects members of the Howick Local Board. Residents of Howick also elect two Howick ward councillors, who sits on the Auckland Council.

====Mayors of Howick====
During its existence from 1952 to 1989, the borough of Howick had six mayors:
==Notable places==
===Museums===
Howick Historical Village, a living history museum run by Howick &amp; Districts Historical Society and located in Pakuranga, opened in 1980 to recreate the Fencible settlement of Howick. The original historic buildings, sourced from around Howick and its environs, were saved from demolition between the mid 1960s and early 1980s and moved to Lloyd Elsmore Park in Pakuranga.

The Polish Heritage Trust Museum has been operating in Howick in 2004.

=== Emilia Maud Nixon Garden of Memories ===
Originally built in the mid-1930s, a small wharenui is located behind the village&#x27;s library and arts centre. The &#x27;Garden of Memories&#x27; was developed by Howick resident Emilia Maude Nixon to &quot;promote understanding, harmony and goodwill between all people&quot;. Nixon planted native trees and grew traditional food eaten by Maori. A waka was also located in the garden, with the wharenui named Torere – after the daughter of Hoturoa, the chief of the Tainui. Kuia and kaumātua visited the garden for a dedication in 1936.

After Nixon&#x27;s death in 1962, the garden was managed by the Howick Borough Council while Torere was managed by the Howick and District Historical Society. In the following decades, the wharenui was occasionally vandalised and left largely unmaintained. The original structure was demolished and rebuilt by the Manukau City Council following the 1989 New Zealand local government reforms – though the wharenui&#x27;s facade and carvings were maintained. Following the rebuilding of Torere, the building was used for classes and activities organised by volunteers.

An attempt to name the wharenui a &quot;marae&quot; by its managing trust prompted over 300 submissions by residents in 1997 – and signs bearing the name were gratified over. The opposition and council response sparked a Race Relations Office investigation. But Torere itself was damaged beyond repair following a fire in October 2004 – fire investigators found the incident was likely a result of an arson attack, while some locals blamed the fire on an electrical fault. The wharenui rebuild project was contested by some locals, notably the Howick Ratepayers and Residents Association, and was only completed in 2011.

<text>A clipboard manager or clipboard extender, is a computer program that adds functionality to an operating system&#x27;s clipboard. Many clipboards provide only one buffer for the &quot;copy and paste&quot; function, and it is overwritten by each new &quot;copy&quot; operation. The main task of a clipboard manager is to store data copied to the clipboard in a way that permits extended use of the data.

Clipboard managers enhance the basic functions of cut, copy, and paste operations with one or more of the following features:
* Multiple buffers and the ability to merge, split, and edit their contents
* Selecting which buffer &quot;cut&quot; or &quot;copy&quot; operations should store data in
* Selecting which buffer(s) &quot;paste&quot; operations should take data from
* Handling formatted text, tabular data, data objects, media content, and URLs
* Saving copied data to long-term storage
* Indexing or tagging of clipped data
* Searching of saved data

Sharing clipboard contents remotely is sometimes done with pastebins.

==Copy history==

Some clipboard managers allow the user to keep multiple clipped objects, available for later use. Some keep a clipping history by automatically making a new buffer for each new cut or copy operation.

Some applications have an internal copy history feature. This has been a standard feature in UNIX editors like vi and emacs for some time. Recent versions of Microsoft Office have included the &quot;Office Clipboard&quot;, a built-in clipboard manager, which operates as long as one of the Office suite applications is open.

== In different systems ==

=== Windows ===
The default Microsoft Windows clipboard manager enables pasting the copied data, even after an application is closed, by maintaining the clip buffer itself. Its copying and pasting operations are very versatile in what they permit to be transferred between applications. A range of cells clipped from an Excel sheet can be pasted as a table into MS Word or LibreOffice Writer. Formatted text clipped from a web page will become cells in an Excel sheet, a table in MS Word, or plain text in Notepad. In Windows 10 and above, the clipboard manager can be accessed with the keyboard shortcut Win + V.

ClipBook Viewer is a discontinued utility included in the Windows NT family until the release of Windows Vista.

Windows versions prior to the Windows 10 October 2018 Update do not offer a copy history feature. In these versions a third-party clipboard manager that replaces the default clipboard is required for extended functionality. The Windows 10 October 2018 Update introduced a new Cloud Clipboard feature which does offer copy history, as well as the ability to sync this history for access on other devices.

=== Mac OS X ===
Mac OS X also has a host of third-party options for clipboard management.

CopyPaste was the first (1997) multiple clipboard utility, the only for many years and is still actively developed. (Shareware)
CopyPaste was first reviewed in 1997 by Tidbits. and also by WIRED.

Clipboard managers for Mac OS X use the Dock, status bar or Dashboard to integrate with the Mac Look and Feel.

=== Linux ===
The freedesktop.org Clipboard Manager specification describes a protocol layered on top of the ICCCM clipboard spec for client applications. A daemon process is responsible for storing clipboard contents. This daemon clipboard manager must be provided by the window manager running in the user&#x27;s X session. The client-side specification has native support in a number of toolkits, including GTK.

The Linux desktop environment KDE ships with Klipper.

GNOME provides a basic clipboard manager function as part of the gnome-control-center (accessed via the gnome-settings-daemon), that supports the freedesktop.org Clipboard Manager Specification.

<doc id="660398" wikidata="Q73700" url="?curid=660398" title="Grey-headed canary-flycatcher">
<text>The grey-headed canary-flycatcher (Culicicapa ceylonensis), sometimes known as the grey-headed flycatcher, is a species of small flycatcher-like bird found in tropical Asia. It has a square crest, a grey hood and yellow underparts. They are found mainly in forested habitats where they often join other birds in mixed-species foraging flocks. Pairs are often seen as they forage for insects by making flycatcher-like sallies and calling aloud. Several subspecies are recognized within their wide distribution range. In the past the genus &quot;Culicicapa&quot; was considered to be an Old World flycatcher but studies have found them to belong to a new family designated as the Stenostiridae or fairy flycatchers that include the African genera &quot;Stenostira&quot; and &quot;Elminia&quot;.

==Description==

The grey-headed canary-flycatcher is about long with a squarish grey head, a canary yellow belly and yellowish-green upperparts. They forage actively like flycatchers and perches in a very upright posture. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage. They have a very flat bill (which gave it the earlier genus name of &quot;Platyrhynchus&quot;) which when seen from above look like an equilateral triangle and is fringed with long rictal bristles.

Across their range, populations differ in the shades of the colours and vary slightly in dimensions and several of these have been designated as subspecies. The nominate subspecies breeds in peninsular India in the hills of the Western Ghats, Nilgiris, central India and the Eastern Ghats (Lammasingi) and Sri Lanka. Subspecies &quot;calochrysea&quot; first described by Harry Oberholser in 1923 breeds along the Himalayas east to Myanmar and Thailand and winters across southern India. The nominate form is darker in shade. Subspecies &quot;antioxantha&quot; which was also described by Oberholser has a breeding range from southern Burma, Thailand through Malaysia to Java and Bali. The island population &quot;sejuncta&quot; described by Ernst Hartert in 1897 is found on Sumbawa, Flores and possibly on Lombok while &quot;connectens&quot; described by Bernhard Rensch in 1931 is restricted to the island of Sumba.

The grey-headed canary-flycatcher was earlier considered to be an Old World flycatcher in spite of its odd crest, colours and nature of vocalization. Molecular phylogeny studies however show that they are quite different and have been placed in the family Stenostiridae that is closely related to the tits and penduline-tits.
==Habitat and distribution==
This species breeds in upland to montane oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;) and other broadleaved forests and similar wooded areas in temperate to tropical southern Asia, from Pakistan, Central India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia and southern China. Many populations are resident, but some Himalayan birds are partial migrants that winter in peninsular India sometimes even occurring in arid habitats. Other populations may make altitudinal movements but in parts of the eastern Himalayas such as Bhutan, they have been found to occur all year round, and can be found up to and above 2,000 m ASL. During the non-breeding season, they are seen in the plains and lower elevations (September to March in India) when they prefer well wooded areas of relatively mature secondary forests, abandoned plantations and overgrown gardens, usually near water and streams including wooded gorges. They are very active and noisy throughout the day foraging at all levels of the forest.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The grey-headed canary-flycatcher is an insectivore and like flycatchers makes sallies for aerial insects from a low perch under the canopy of a tree. A pair may forage together and they will often join mixed-species foraging flocks. They breed in summer (April to June in India and possibly later in western China
). The nest, built by the female alone, is an unlined cup bound by cobwebs and often attached to and covered by moss. The nest is found placed against the mossy trunk of a tree or built on rocks or on a ledge in a mud bank. The typical clutch is three or four eggs. Hodgson&#x27;s hawk-cuckoo has been observed parasitizing the brood of this species in northern Borneo.

<doc id="660410" wikidata="Q6497985" url="?curid=660410" title="Sound stage">
<text>A sound stage (also written soundstage) is a large, soundproof structure, building or room with large doors and high ceilings, used for the production of theatrical film-making and television productions, usually located on a secured movie or television studio property. 

Compared to a silent stage, a sound stage is sound-proofed so that sound can be recorded along with the images. The recordings are known as &quot;production sound&quot;. Because most sound in movies, other than dialogue, is added in post-production, this generally means that the main difference between the two is that sound stages are used for dialogue scenes, but silent stages are not. An alternative to production sound is to record additional dialogue during post-production (known as dubbing).

==Early history==
Structures of this type were in use in the motion picture industry before the advent of sound recording. Early stages for silent movies were built, either as a three-wall open-roof set, or with large skylights, until electric lighting became powerful enough to expose film adequately.

==Contemporary building requirements==
===Extensive soundproofing===
With the advent of electric lights, enclosed stages were built in Hollywood and rapidly converted to sound stages with many mattresses placed on the walls. With the coming of the talkies in the late 1920s, it became necessary to enclose and fully soundproof these stages to eliminate noise and distractions from outside, including limiting access. 

The ceilings and walls of the building containing the sound stage must be heavily soundproofed, so the structure must be sturdy and capable of accepting such additional features and loads, or a new building specifically designed with the features and to bear the loads is required, which often is the less expensive alternative to retrofitting an existing structure because of engineering issues. 

Buildings without soundproofing still are referred to as silent stages and may be used where the dialogue and other sounds are recorded as a separate operation. This separate operation usually involves the principal actors doing synchronized dialogue replacement voice recordings over a working cut of the film, specialized language actors doing a secondary language dubbing or for the filming of special effects.

A sound stage, unlike a silent stage, requires caution to avoid making noise anywhere within range of the audio recording equipment.

A sound stage traditionally has a large red light above or next to each exterior door. When the light starts blinking, it means shooting is in progress. Anyone who opens the door at that point will introduce external sound and light and ruin the take in progress.

When a studio is home to multiple sound stages, they tend to all look alike from the outside: giant beige box-shaped buildings. Sound stages are marked on the exterior with large numbers to help distinguish them.

===Enclosed stage===
An enclosed stage makes it easier for the crew of a production to design and build the sets to exact specifications, precise scale, and detail. The art director of a production makes an architectural plan and carpenters build it. On a film, the head electrician is credited as the &quot;gaffer&quot; and the assistant as the &quot;best boy&quot;, regardless of gender. After a set is painted, the &quot;set dresser&quot; furnishes it with everything that the &quot;set designer&quot;, under the direction of the &quot;art director&quot;, has selected for the interior.

===Catwalks and ceiling lights===
On a sound stage, the camera may be placed exactly where the director wants it. Achieving the desired lighting is easier because each stage has a metal framework with catwalks and lights suspended from the ceiling. This makes it easier for the cinematographer to have the &quot;grips&quot; position each flag or bounce and the &quot;lighting technicians&quot; to position each light to get exactly the correct lighting for every shot.

==Cameras, rentals, and special techniques==
Television production generally uses multiple cameras, and cinema production generally uses a single camera. This is not universally true because the choice varies very much on what the director is trying to achieve.

Rental of a sound stage entails an expensive process, but working on a sound stage saves time when setting up for production as long as access to all of the necessary technical equipment, personnel, and supplies is readily available. As all the scenes can be filmed on the sets inside the sound stage, using it also eliminates having to move the production from location to location. 

With the use of bluescreen or greenscreen techniques (whereby backgrounds are inserted electronically behind the actors in the finished film) and a sound stage, extensive control of the production process is achieved.

==In acoustic recording==
In audio recording, the term &quot;soundstage&quot; refers to the depth and richness of the recording, and usually relates to the playback process. According to audiophiles, the quality of the playback is very much dependent upon how one is able to pick out different instruments, voices, vocal parts, and such exactly where they are located on an imaginary, two- or three-dimensional field. The quality of this soundstage can enhance not only the listener&#x27;s involvement in the recording, but also their overall perception of the stage.

==Special effects before post-production==
The latest technology and software can render basic &quot;previsualisation&quot; effects into scenes in real time while recording, before post-production, with the use of sensors detecting the position of actors and elements, in the staging of the frame. The director during filming can view what the composition of the picture is with basic digital objects and surfaces included and how it appears, assisting the creative process.

== Virtual production volumes ==
A newer form of set being used in both the production of films and television shows is the virtual production &quot;volume&quot;. Different from the volume of a conventional motion capture stage (where often no physical image is being recorded for the final product), a virtual production volume is a stage that is surrounded (in varying degrees) by screens that extend the set. These screens, most commonly large arrays of LEDs, show a version of the set that was constructed in 3D (using software such as Unreal Engine) that tracks its motion in real time with camera movement. A static display can function similarly for a still camera, given there is no parallax. However, these volumes allow the scenery to adaptively move and distort according to how the camera ought to see it if it were moving in a real environment.

Benefits of such a setup include total control of a scene; dusk and dawn can last all day. Not only can time of day or number of light sources be manipulated at will, but portions of the volume off-screen can be turned completely white to add fill lighting from a given direction, or they can be turned off to darken that area. They can also function as a typical green/blue screen for chroma keying by displaying the solid color behind the performers. Having a physical space where actors can see their environment and inform their performances accordingly is something that most greenscreen sets lack. 

The controlled visual environment also allows directors and cinematographers the ability to better create mise-en-scène, with greater control over the set, and the ability to see the final image as they are creating it. Where these volumes are especially beneficial is in having light behave perfectly realistically on transparent, translucent, and very reflective materials. These types of objects, such as eyeglasses, glassware, and shiny armor, are often very difficult to deal with in a conventional chroma key work flow. This technique also minimizes the amount of tedious rotoscoping work required in post-production to cut out what was not picked up by chroma keying.

The downside to this setup is that unlike with greenscreen, whatever was filmed is final in terms of visual environment (as is the case with filming on any normal set or location). By contrast, a greenscreen film segment can essentially be swapped to anything at any point in post-production.

<text>The House of Montmorency () was one of the oldest and most distinguished noble families in France.

==Origins==
The family name Montmorency derived from their castle in the &quot;pays de France&quot;, recorded in Latin as &quot;Mons Maurentiacus&quot;, in 993. &quot;Maurentiacus&quot;, the name of the area surrounding the castle, meant &quot;estate of Maurentius&quot;, probably a Gallo-Roman landowner. 
The village that grew up in the vicinity of the castle was also known as &quot;Montmorency&quot;, and is eponymous of the modern commune of Montmorency, Val-d&#x27;Oise &quot;département&quot;, in the immediate neighborhood of Enghien-les-Bains and Saint-Denis, about northwest of Paris.

==History==
The family, since its first appearance in history in the person of Bouchard I of Montmorency in the 10th century, has furnished six constables and twelve marshals of France, several admirals and cardinals, numerous grand officers of the Crown and grand masters of various knightly orders. Henry IV of France once said, that if ever the House of Bourbon should fail (i.e., become extinct), no European family deserved the French crown more than the House of Montmorency. Bouchard I&#x27;s son Thibaud of Montmorency was the ancestor of the lords of Montlhéry.

Matthieu I of Montmorency received in 1138 the post of constable, and died in 1160. His first wife was Aline, a natural daughter of Henry I of England; his second, Adelaide de Maurienne, widow of Louis VI and mother of Louis VII, and according to Duchesne, he shared the regency of France with Suger, during the absence of the latter king on the Second Crusade.

Matthieu II of Montmorency had an important share in the victory of Bouvines (1214). As he captured 12 enemy flags at Bouvines, he was permitted by the king to display 12 eagles on his coat of arms. He was also made constable in 1218. During the reign of Louis VIII he distinguished himself chiefly in the south of France (Niort, La Rochelle, Bordeaux). On the accession of Louis IX, he was one of the chief supports of the queen-regent Blanche of Castile, and was successful in reducing all vassals to obedience. He died in 1230.

His younger son, Guy, in right of his mother, became head of the House of Laval. Canada&#x27;s oldest French-language university, Université Laval, was named after François de Montmorency-Laval, first bishop of New France and founder of the Quebec Seminary, from while Université Laval emerged.

Anne de Montmorency, so named, it is said, after his godmother Anne of Brittany, was the first to attain the ducal title (1551).

His eldest son, François de Montmorency (1530–1579), was married to Diane, natural daughter of Henry II.

Another son, Henri I de Montmorency (1534–1614), who became duc de Montmorency on his brother&#x27;s death in 1579, had been governor of Languedoc since 1563. As a leader of the party called the &quot;Politiques&quot; he took a prominent part in the French Wars of Religion. In 1593 he was made constable, but Henry IV showed some anxiety to keep him away from Languedoc, which he ruled like a sovereign prince.

Henri II de Montmorency (1595 – October 30, 1632), son of Duke Henri I, succeeded to the title in 1614, having previously been made Grand Admiral. He also was governor of Languedoc. In 1625 he defeated the French Protestant fleet under Soubise, and seized the islands of Ré and Oleron, but the jealousy of Richelieu deprived him of the means of following up these advantages. In 1628-1629 he was allowed to command against the Duke of Rohan in Languedoc; in 1630 he defeated the Piedmontese, and captured Carlo Doria, at Avigliana, and took Saluzzo. 

In the same year he was created marshal. In 1632 he joined the party of Gaston, duke of Orleans, and placed himself at the head of the rebel army, which was defeated by Marshal Henri de Schomberg at Castelnaudary (September 1, 1632); severely wounded, he fell into the enemy&#x27;s hands and, abandoned by Gaston, was executed as a traitor at Toulouse on October 30. The ducal title passed to his sister Charlotte-Marguerite, princess of Condé.

From the barons de Fosseux, a branch of the Montmorency family established in Brabant in the 15th century, sprang the seigneurs de Bouteville, among whom was the duellist François de Montmorency-Bouteville, who was beheaded in 1627. His son, François Henri, marshal of France, became Duke of Piney-Luxemburg by his marriage with Madeleine de Clermont, daughter of Marguerite Charlotte de Luxemburg, Duchesse de Piney.

Charles François Frédéric de Montmorency-Luxembourg, son of the marshal, was created Duc de Beaufort in 1688 and Duke of Montmorency in 1689.

In 1767 the title of Duke of Beaufort-Montmorency passed by marriage to another branch of the Montmorency-Fosseux. This branch becoming extinct in 1862, the title was taken by the Duc de Valencay, who belonged to the Talleyrand-Périgord family and married one of the two heiresses of this branch (1864). There were many other branches of the Montmorency family, among others that of the seigneurs of Laval.

In the 19th century the Irish Morres family highlighted a claim to descent from the Montmorency family. Morres descendants persisted in asserting the connection, obtaining a Royal license to change their name, despite objections expressed in the 1860s by undisputed descendants of the Montmorency family in France.

<text>Late Junction is a music programme broadcast weekly on Friday nights by BBC Radio 3. Billed as &quot;Journeys in music, ancient to future. The home for adventurous listeners.&quot;, the programme has a wide musical scope. It is not uncommon to hear medieval ballads juxtaposed with 21st-century electronica, or jazz followed by international folk music followed by an ambient track. Each edition of the programme runs for 90 minutes.

==History==
The programme was created soon after Roger Wright took over as controller of BBC Radio 3, as part of changes with which Wright believed that he was addressing &quot;this feeling people had that they didn&#x27;t want to put Radio 3 on unless they were going to listen carefully&quot;. The first programme was broadcast on 13 September 1999 and produced by Antony Pitts.

&quot;Late Junction&quot; won a Sony gold award in 2003 for Music Programming. The show was described as &quot;A radio jewel. Is there a show like this anywhere else in the radio world? Everyone who hears the show falls in love with it. Surprising, revealing, accessible. Brilliantly programmed - a show where the real star is the music.&quot;

The programme&#x27;s main regular presenters are Verity Sharp and Jennifer Lucy Allan, who alternate as solo presenters. Before the shift from three 90-minute shows per week to a single two-hour broadcast in late 2019, other regular presenters included the show&#x27;s founding presenter Fiona Talkington, Max Reinhardt, Nick Luscombe, Anne Hilde Neset, and Mara Carlyle. Other former presenters include Shaheera Asante (until 2006), and Robert Sandall, until his death from prostate cancer in 2010.

While the selection of music to be played in any one programme is the result of a collaboration between producer and presenter, some individual preferences can be detected. Fiona Talkington, for instance, tended to play more conventional jazz and Scandinavian music and Verity Sharp more folk music, especially that featuring fiddle-playing. Nick Luscombe&#x27;s shows often featured music from Japan.

The show has featured occasional &quot;Late Junction Sessions&quot;, where two musicians or groups, from different genres, are introduced and record together, exclusively for Late Junction, for the first time. After broadcast, these sessions are available as a podcast for 30 days.

In March 2019, BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Davey announced that Late Junction was being cut from three episodes a week to a single two-hour slot on Fridays from Autumn 2019. More than 500 people from the world of music, including Brian Eno, Billy Bragg, Jarvis Cocker, Martin Carthy and Eliza Carthy signed an open letter objecting to the cut.

From April 2024, as part of a new schedule introduced by BBC Radio 3 Controller Sam Jackson, Late Junction&#x27;s weekly running time was cut by a further 30 minutes to 90 minutes and it also moved to the earlier start time of 10pm.

It comprises Meijiang District, Meixian District, Xingning City and five counties. Its built-up or metro area made up of two urban districts was home to 992,351 inhabitants.

==History==
Neolithic age stone tools and pottery have been discovered in dozens of places in the Meixian district of Meizhou. Ancient kiln sites from the Western Zhou dynasty and bells from the Warring States period were also found. Before the Qin dynasty, Meizhou was under Nanyue rule. After Qin unified the Nanyue, Meizhou was belonged to Nanhai Commandery.

The original name of Meizhou was Chengxiang (程乡), established under the prefecture of Jingzhou during the Southern Han (917–971). The name was changed to Meizhou at the 10th century and Jiaying Prefecture at the 15th century. After 1912, it was changed back to Meizhou, the name comes from the Mei River and the Chinese name for the plum blossom ().
After several subsequent shifts of jurisdiction, it became Meizhou City in 1988. Meizhou is now a noted historical and cultural city.

==Geography and climate==
Meizhou is located in the northeast of Guangdong Province, bordering Fujian Province in the northeast and Jiangxi Province in the northwest. The complex geological structure was formed mainly from granite, spouting rocks, metamorphic rock, shale, sandstone, red rock and limestone.Its administrative area ranges in latitude from 23° 23&#x27; to 24° 56&#x27; N and in longitude from 115° 18&#x27; to 116° 56&#x27; E, covering an area of .

Meizhou has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with short, mild, overcast winters and long, very hot, humid summers. The monthly daily average temperature in January is , and in July is . From April to June, rainfall is the heaviest and most frequent. Though striking typhoons do not affect the area as much as the coast, the mountainous topography means that flooding is a serious concern.

==Administration==

The municipal government, Intermediate Court, CPC office and Public Security Bureau are located in the Jiangnan Subdistrict of the Meijiang District, on the right bank of Mei River.

==Economy==
Meizhou is rich in mineral and tourism resources. It has 48 kinds of minerals including coal, iron, limestone, rare clay and porcelain clay amongst others. Of these reserves manganese is ranked first in Guangdong Province. Meizhou has plenty of water resources, hot springs and certified mineral waters. There are tourism resources such as cultural historic sites constructed during the Tang dynasty, former residences of notable figures, natural scenery of all kinds, and unique Hakka cultural sights.

==Transport==
Meizhou is a communication hub for the three provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi and the bridge connecting the coastal and the inland areas. State Highways 205 and 206 run across the city. Expressways, state, provincial county and village highways extend to all parts.

In 2019 the city became the terminus for the Meizhou–Chaoshan high-speed railway which opened a new station at providing high-speed rail links to Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Shantou, Chaoshan, Yichang and Xiamen. The Guangzhou–Meizhou–Shantou railway and Meizhou-Kanshi Railway use Meizhou railway station in the city providing regular rail connections to Guangzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Shenzhen, Dapu, Wuchang and Kunming.

The city is served by the regional Meizhou Meixian Airport, with regular air routes to Guangzhou and Hong Kong.
By water, the Mei River and Han River reach Chaozhou and Shantou.
==Culture==
The Meixian dialect is considered the standard Hakka dialect, along with the neighboring Mei County and Dabu County.

Hakka people are a unique ethnic group of Han Chinese originally from around the Yellow River area, who later migrated south to avoid the chaos of war centuries ago. Due to hostility towards the new immigrants, many were forced into the mountainous regions of Guangdong Province. This migratory tradition has continued with the redistribution of Hakka people to the most remote parts of the world. Many people in Meizhou emigrated during the last century to earn money for their families, with some returning to build in their hometowns.

Many buildings are named after famous people in Meizhou, built by returning Hakkas and overseas diaspora Hakkas.

Because of its mountainous location, Meizhou has numerous natural scenic areas and good air quality. Many visitors come to the Yannanfei Tea Garden to climb the mountain.

==Education==
Education in Meizhou has been highly valued since ancient times. The city is home to Jiaying University, a local university which also attracts Hakka students from other provinces. The university is also known for its research into Hakka culture.

==Food==
During the period after August or September, a sea of pomelos can be seen, especially in village orchards.
Salt baked chicken is among the most well-known Hakka dishes, found also in many other cities. Another local dish is Yong tau foo (stuffed tofu). It is said that when Hakka people first came south, there was no wheat flour for dumplings. So they substituted tofu. Meat based fillings give a special taste that became a feature of Hakka cuisine. Preserved beef and ginger candies are also locally popular.

<doc id="660428" wikidata="Q3268015" url="?curid=660428" title="Duke of Montmorency">
<text>Duke of Montmorency was a title of French nobility that was created several times for members of the Montmorency family, who were lords of Montmorency, near Paris.

==History==
The first creation was in 1551 for Anne de Montmorency, Constable of France. This title was forfeited by the 4th Duke of Montmorency, who was executed for treason in 1632. 

The dukedom was recreated in 1633 for his sister Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency and her husband, the Prince of Condé. This title was renamed as Duke of Enghien in 1689.

At that point, the Montmorency name was transferred to the dukedom of Beaufort (second creation), which had been conferred in 1688 on Charles François Frédéric de Montmorency-Luxembourg, Prince de Tingry. This new dukedom of Montmorency was authorised to pass through the female line to the branch of Montmorency-Fosseux in 1767, but the line became extinct in 1862. 

However, Emperor Napoleon III extended the title of Duke of Montmorency in 1864 to Nicolas Raoul Adalbert de Talleyrand-Périgord, second son of the 3rd Duke of Talleyrand by his wife Anne Louise Charlotte de Montmorency, who was a sister of the 6th Duke of Montmorency.

<doc id="660435" wikidata="Q580292" url="?curid=660435" title="François de Montmorency, 2nd Duke of Montmorency">
<text>François de Montmorency, 2nd [[Duke of Montmorency]] (17 July 1530 – 6 May 1579) was a French noble, governor, diplomat and soldier during the latter Italian Wars and the early French Wars of Religion. The son of Anne de Montmorency, favourite of the king and Madeleine of Savoy, Montmorency began his political career during the coronation of Henri II in 1547. With the resumption of the Italian Wars in 1551 he fought at the capture of Chieri, the famous defence of Metz and the defence of Thérouanne. In the latter engagement he was captured by Imperial forces, and put up for ransom. He would spend the next three years in captivity before returning to France in 1556. Returning to the conflict immediately he participated in the disastrous Saint-Quentin campaign in which the French army was destroyed and his father captured. After serving as a lieutenant in Picardie he found himself gaining advantage on the death of Henri II, the new Guise regime compensating the Montmorency family for their seizure of the grand maître title with the provision of a Marshal baton to Montmorency.

Back in 1556 on his return from captivity he had been granted the dual honour of the governorship of Île de France and that of Paris. He would hold these offices with brief interruptions until his death, building a sizeable power base in the capital. His father was disappointed to learn on his release that he had secretly arranged a marriage, and Montmorency was forced to annul the arrangement so he could marry the king&#x27;s daughter Diane de France. As governor of the Île de France he exerted a moderate Catholic influence that infuriated radical elements of the city that accused him of crypto Protestantism. This was advantageous to him as the crown increasingly moved in the direction of toleration, culminating in the Edict of January which recognised the right of Protestant worship in 1562. During the early civil wars he remained loyal to the crown but represented a conciliatory position on the royal council, frequently partaking in peace talks. During the second war of religion he fought at Saint-Denis where his father was killed, leaving him as duke.

Throughout this period he feuded with the Guise, allying himself with his cousin Admiral Coligny who the Guise accused of assassinating the duke of Guise in 1563. This culminated in a showdown in his governorship when Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, brother to the late duke attempted a show of force entry into the city, only to be repulsed in a skirmish with Montmorency&#x27;s forces. Though the two sides were forced to reconcile at Moulins, Allier in 1566 the feud would continue. Montmorency was the lone voice at court in support of Coligny&#x27;s plan to bring France into war with Spain. When Coligny was assassinated in Paris by the duke of Guise in the opening hours of the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew, Montmorency was absent from the city, having retired to his estates with an illness. He considered revenging himself on the Guise, until the king informed him the assassination had his blessing. In 1574 Montmorency found himself close to the king&#x27;s brother Alençon at court, and was accused of involvement in an attempt on the duke of Guise&#x27;s life, leaving court, he was convinced by Charles IX to return in April, only to be implicated in a conspiracy of Alençon&#x27;s, and thrown in the Bastille. His brothers escaped court and entered rebellion, however he would not be released until Alençon himself escaped court in September 1575 and his release was demanded. Weakened by his imprisonment he spent the final years of his life less involved in affairs of court, dying in 1579.

==Early life and family==
===Family===
Montmorency was born in 1530, the first son of Anne de Montmorency and Madeleine of Savoy. His parents&#x27; marriage was fruitful, and they would go on to have another four sons; Henri I de Montmorency (1534-1614), Charles de Montmorency-Damville (1537-1612), Gabriel de Montmorency (1541-1562) and Guillaume de Montmorency-Thoré (1547-1593). The careers of all these brothers would be shaped by the French Wars of Religion. Anne de Montmorency was a fervent Catholic, and favourite to kings François I, who made him Constable, and Henri II. He was disappointed by his sons more moderate Catholicism, and his beloved nephew Gaspard II de Coligny&#x27;s Protestantism.

===Marriage===
After the death of the duke of Castro, the king&#x27;s daughter Diane de France was once again marriagable. Constable Montmorency seeing the potential for advantage to the family, convinced the king to marry her to his son, François de Montmorency. Uninterested in the marriage selected for him, Montmorency defied his family, swearing legally binding &quot;paroles de promesse&quot; to another woman Jeanne de Piennes, one of Catherine de Medici&#x27;s &quot;filles d&#x27;honneur&quot;. Upon finding out the Constable was furious, and flew into a rage, retiring to his hôtel for two weeks during which he spoke to no one. The Constable attempted to persuade Jeanne to become a nun which would release his son from their arrangement. Montmorency for his part was dispatched to Rome to get the arrangements annulled, but Pope Paul IV refused. Montmorency blamed the duke of Guise for this failure, much to the duke&#x27;s dismay. Not easily defeated Constable Montmorency oversaw the passing of a law in 1557 allowing a father to disinherit a son under the age of 30 if they married without their father&#x27;s consent. The law was passed with retroactive effect, so Montmorency was compelled to annul his marriage and go with his father&#x27;s choice. He wrote to Jeanne releasing her from her obligations to him and urging her to do likewise for him. The Constable compensated her through an arrangement of a marriage to Alluye, a secretary of state and a gift of 40,000 &quot;livres.&quot; Montmorency and Diane were married in May 1557. The marriage would not produce any sons, as such he would be succeeded by his brother to his titles on his death.

Of moderate religious inclinations, his proclivities were complemented by his wife. She exerted a conciliatory influence on the court and supported her husbands tolerant attitude towards Protestantism.

===Reputation===
The contemporary historian Brantôme wrote of Montmorency: &quot;Now, besides the fact that Monsieur de Montmorency was brave, he was a wise and shrewd captain and a strong politician, and for this, the King , when he went to tour his kingdom [in 1564], left him Governor of the Île de France and Paris, where he showed his wisdom and good leadership, because, having found the people of Paris, just emerged from civil war, still a great enemy of the Huguenots, mutinous, seditious, shaking and boiling all over, with mutiny and envy, always spilling blood, ... he rendered them supple and easy to handle like a buckskin glove from Vendôme, with which the King was greatly satisfied.&quot;

==Reign of Henri II==
With the advent of a new king&#x27;s reign, Montmorency had a part to play in the coronation at Reims. He and the other three representatives of the oldest baronies in France (Martigues, Harcourt and Thouars) travelled to the Basilica of Saint-Remi where they demanded the transportation of the sacred oils to anoint Henri be taken to the cathedral. He and the other nobles stayed in the basilica until the important oils were returned as hostages.

===Italian Wars===
As tensions rose in Italy between the duke of Parma and the Emperor the French began preparing to offer military support to their ally. Marshal Brissac was created governor of Piedmont and put in charge of military support. Henri dispatched military companies to assist him in the coming conflict. The flower of the French nobility joined the forces, among them the younger sons of the duke of Guise, the Bourbon-Vendôme prince&#x27;s of the blood and Montmorency. In 1551 Brissac&#x27;s force executed a coup with the capture of Chieri, surprising the Emperor who had expected the French to relieve Parma. For now France and the Empire were not formerly at war, both providing assistance to proxies, however this fiction would be shattered the following year.

During April 1552 Montmorency briefly campaigned in Italy besieging the castle of Lanzo under Brissac&#x27;s direction, however with little success he and many of the other high ranking nobles who had flocked south in search of glory, hurried back north to join with Henri. Alongside Henri he participated in the capture of Ivoy and Damvillers. With the capture of Metz, Henri dispatched Montmorency and Villars to bring word of the armies entry into Germany to the Protestant princes with whom France was allied. After the successful defence of Metz against the Emperor, Henri was feeling confident, and lost himself in celebrations for this landmark accomplishment. He staged a grand procession in the city featuring Montmorency and his brother Damville who had assisted the duke of Guise in the defence of the city. The emperor meanwhile readied a new army and struck at Thérouanne in 1553 which held a strategic position between Calais and Flanders. Having sieged the fortress for a month it at last fell to the imperial forces, who razed the settlement to the ground, and captured 1000 prisoners, among them Montmorency who had been among the defenders of the city. Indeed it was Montmorency to whom the task of negotiating the surrender fell. Shortly after the destruction of Thérouanne the imperial army meted out the same fate to Hesdin. Among the casualties at Hesdin was the Duke of Castro, newly wed to the king&#x27;s daughter Diane de France. 

===Ransom===
With a ransom set at 80,000 &quot;écus&quot;, a reduction from the original 100,000 the Constable was promised that the ransom attained from the most prominent imperial prisoner the duke of Aarschot would be used to buy back his son&#x27;s freedom. In May 1556 Aarschot escaped his imprisonment, infuriating Montmorency, both for the violation of aristocratic honour and the loss of revenue it represented. In July word reached the court that the Imperial captors would lower the ransom to 50,000 &quot;écus&quot;, furthering the Constables desire for peace. In August with the ransom paid, Montmorency returned to France. The Constable was at first overjoyed, until he learned of his son&#x27;s marital situation.

===Governor===
Constable Montmorency was still keen for his son to receive the key governorship of Paris, and ensured it was earmarked for him while Montmorency was still in Imperial captivity. In 1556, Montmorency received appointment as governor of the Île de France and city of Paris. In this role he replaced his cousin Gaspard II de Coligny, who had held the post since 1551, Coligny in turn was shuffled into the governorship of Picardie. He would hold these posts largely uninterrupted until his death in 1579, the role of governor of Paris changing hands a couple of times. In 1561 Marshal Thermes was appointed as lieutenant-general of Paris, only to be replaced by Marshal Brissac in May 1562 who was in turn replaced by the future Marshal Cossé before Montmorency again assumed the role. In a further twist, during 1562 Cardinal Bourbon would hold the role of governor of Paris. Upon receiving the appointment in 1556, Montmorency was granted a large monetary gift by the town council of Paris. He made his entrance to the &quot;hôtel de ville&quot; with a retinue of 200 nobles.

===Return to the fight===
With Guise&#x27;s campaign into Italy in January 1557, Montmorency accompanied him, bringing his company with him. In the wake of the disastrous battle of Saint-Quentin in which much of the French army was destroyed and Montmorency&#x27;s father the Constable captured, Montmorency was among the captains that led the remnants of the French army to safety, having fought in the engagement himself but avoided capture. He and Bourdillon led two cannons from the field, rendezvousing with the Prince of Condé and François I, Duke of Nevers at La Fère. Montmorency was dispatched to Amiens as a special lieutenant. This gave him military authority over the border region during the crisis that now consuming the kingdom. The king&#x27;s orders to the governor of Péronne made it clear that this appointment allowed him to act as the de facto governor of Picardie. Meanwhile the Constable&#x27;s enemy, the Guise family, free of their rival led the war effort from Paris, achieving a counter stroke with the capture of Calais, which had resisted French control for 200 years. By May 1558, the triumphant Guise secured Montmorency&#x27;s replacement with Claude, Duke of Aumale in Picardie. With the return from captivity of the Constable in 1558, the Guise were pushed once more from the limelight by the king&#x27;s favourite. The duke of Guise, resentful about his loss of authority, lashed out uncharacteristically, challenging Montmorency to a duel over a perceived slight. Montmorency protested that he had done nothing to dishonour the Guise, and reported what had transpired to the king and Constable. The king was annoyed at Guise&#x27;s behaviour, while the Constable laughed it off, recognising it as being a sign of political desperation. 

==Reign of François II==
===Grand Maître===
Upon the sudden death of Henri II, a palace revolution quickly followed. The Guise, utilising their relationship as uncles to the new queen of France asserted their dominance over the crown. Their ascendency came at the expense of Henri II&#x27;s favourite the Constable. To this end the office of &quot;grand maître&quot;, which the Constable had hoped to provide to his son was usurped for the duke of Guise. The Guise could not however afford to totally alienate such a powerful magnate, as such to compensate the family for the seizure of this post, the Constable&#x27;s first son was granted the Marshal baton.

===Conspiracy of Amboise===
In the wake of the Conspiracy of Amboise, in which Protestants attempted to seize the king and kill his advisers, Montmorency and his father quickly hurried to Paris, this was both to ensure the city was calm and that there was no potential for subversion related to the conspiracy to unfold in the city. The gates were closed, regular guards were reinforced and searches undertaken. Those who were not resident to the capital had to provide reasons for their presence or depart in 24 hours. 

In August 1560, he participated in an Assembly of Notables summoned by the Guise in response to both the religious crisis that was engulfing the kingdom and the financial problems which had been left by Henri II. The assembly agreed that the religious question would be left to a general assembly of the church, while the financial question would be dealt with by an Estates General, who would consider a package of reforms. 

==Reign of Charles IX==
As early as 1561 Montmorency had acquired a reputation for moderate Catholicism, the English ambassador reported that he was &#x27;said not to be against our religion&#x27;. He remonstrated with his father in April 1561 when the Constable reconciled with the duke of Guise in the form of an informal alliance against Protestantism, urging his father not to abandon nobles who were reliable friends of the family for a relationship with his bitterest rival. In May 1561 the English ambassador reported that Montmorency had absented himself from Charles&#x27; sacre as he would not partake in Mass.

===Edict of January===
The crown increasingly moved towards religious toleration in the early years of Charles IX. This culminated in the Edict of January in 1562, which for the first time granted official toleration to the presence of two faiths in France. This explosive edict was expected to receive strong opposition from the &quot;Parlement&quot; which would have to register it before it became law. As such Montmorency and Navarre were dispatched to the &quot;Parlement&quot; to order them to register it immediately and without the traditional process of remonstrance. The &quot;Parlement&quot; ignored their demands, and instead insisted on receiving physical copies so they could review the text and prepare their response. Montmorency oversaw the printing of them and by the following week they were in the hands of &quot;Parlementaires.&quot; This did not please the leading &quot;présidents&quot; on the court however which wanted to distribute them itself, several councillors came to the Marshal to demand that the entire output be handed over to them. Their displeasure at how the situation had unfolded would be reflected in the remonstrances they raised in February. Finally on 6 March they registered the edict. In the final days before the edicts registration, bands of students began to riot in the &quot;Palais de Justice&quot;, demanding the edict be published on threat of seizing churches for themselves. Montmorency reported that thousands of armed men were threatening the city, and that to avert serious disturbance, the &quot;Parlement&quot; should register the edict post-haste.

In January 1563 a powder reserve in one of Paris&#x27; arsenals detonated. Militant Catholics in the city blamed the Protestants for having sabotaged the powder supply. The nucleus of a riot began to formulate, with violence being meted out to those Protestants suspected of responsibility. Montmorency, the prévôt des marchands and other authorities hurried to the scene, to contain the crowds. However despite their efforts, several would be killed in the coming days. Catherine voiced her considerable displeasure about the chaotic situation in the capital, advising Montmorency on 8 February to bring more troops into the capital to contain the populace.

===Peace of Amboise===
As a term of the Peace of Amboise, the Protestants were granted one site of worship per baillage, the court was keen that these sites would be selected in small out of the way locations away from population centres. To this end Catherine instructed Montmorency to relocate the site in Senlis, away from Pontoise and towards a more obscure location. As governor of the Île de France, Montmorency was responsible for all sites of worship in the various bailli of the region. To ensure that the terms were abided by across France, a commissioner system was established by the crown, with several commissioners responsible for each region of France. There were concerns however that these commissioners would struggle to assert their authority over local interests, to this end the three Marshals, Bourdillon Vielleville and Montmorency were assigned super regions in which they were to reinforce the commissioners authority. Montmorency was given the region of his governorship, Picardie, Normandie, Champagne, Orléans and Berry. He began his enforcement responsibilities with a visit to Picardie. Having arrived, he ensured that the king&#x27;s majority was recognised, and that towns abided by the recent edicts, he further held responsibility for the disarmament of the populace, excluding border towns. This appointment risked overstretching Montmorency, who already had a consuming task keeping his governorship in order.

===Royal tour===
Conscious that the state of peace was still very fragile, Catherine decided in 1564, that the court would tour France with the dual purpose of enforcing the young king&#x27;s authority on the independent minded magnates of the provinces, and ensuring that the terms of the peace were abided by. Catherine feared however that the courts absence from the capital could lead to dangerous developments in the city. To this end she began a regular stream of correspondence with Montmorency. In total during the courts travels across France she would send 74 letters to him. Her concern proved to be justified, as the feud between the Guise and Montmorency heated up in the city while the court was in Languedoc. Montmorency&#x27;s open partisanship with Coligny and his faction during this period was of considerable distress to the court. From their travels Catherine wrote to him urging all nobles who were not in the household of residents to be retired from the city. Montmorency, unwilling to dilute the heavy retinue of followers he enjoyed in Paris complained to her that she was interfering with his authority. She shot back that Lansac and de Garde would enforce the royal will if he wouldn&#x27;t.

===Feud===
While he had been in opposition to his cousin during the first war of religion, with the coming of peace Montmorency reconciled with Admiral Coligny. This set him up for a confrontation with the house of Guise, who blamed Coligny for the assassination of the duke of Guise in the closing days of the first war. Both he and his father, who was militantly Catholic defended his cousin at court from the accusations of the Guise family who wanted an investigation opened into Coligny. Both justified their defence of their Protestant kinsmen as a family matter that was unconnected from religion. To this end Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, brother of the late duke aimed to make a show of force entry into Paris with an armed retinue, hoping that this could provide advantage after the failure to pursue their case against the Admiral through legal channels. Montmorency refused the Cardinal entry to the city under arms. While Lorraine technically had a royal permit to travel with an armed escort he refused to show it to Montmorency, making his entry illegal. Therefore ignoring the prohibition Lorraine and his retinue entered the city through the &quot;porte Saint-Denis&quot;, and came out worse in a skirmish near &quot;St Innocents&quot; with Montmorency&#x27;s forces. Montmorency was supported by the Protestant prince Porcien in the engagement. Meanwhile Aumale entered the city via another gate without opposition. Lorraine for his part was forced to retreat to the &quot;Hôtel de Cluny&quot; with Aumale, where they were besieged by mocking Parisians who he had hoped would flock to his banner upon his entry into the capital. During the skirmish, one of Lorraine&#x27;s men had been killed. A few days after this humiliation they quietly slipped out of the city. Coligny meanwhile arrived in Paris on 22 January to offer his support to the Marshal accompanied by 70 gentleman. Montmorency defended his calling on Coligny in front of the Paris &quot;Parlement&quot; saying that the Admiral brought the support of the &#x27;reformed religion&#x27; which was useful against his enemies the Guise. In January 1566, while the court was resident at Moulins Catherine engineered a forceful reconciliation between the Guise and Coligny, and of that between the Guise and Marshal Montmorency, the most forthright defender of Coligny in the Montmorency family. Coligny and Lorraine were forced to exchange the kiss of peace, in theory settling their feud. Nevertheless this did little but paper over the hatred between the two parties, and when the Duke of Guise arrived at court, the Constable and Montmorency made their excuses and departed.

In early 1567, the continued subversions of the peace of Amboise by the Protestants of Paris, was wearing thin on Catherine, who was conscious that militant Catholics were keen to engage in more violence in the city. She urged Montmorency to instruct the Protestants of the city to &#x27;live more modestly&#x27;. Montmorency&#x27;s warning had little effect, and the illegal services, marriages and baptisms continued in the city. As the Constable increasingly aged, he planned for the succession of his titles, hoping to impart the office of Constable to his son, this was a frustration to Louis I, Prince of Condé who coveted the office for himself. The ambitions the leading Protestant nobles in combination with the inflammatory policy of the Spanish in crushing the Protestants of the Spanish Netherlands drove them into rebellion once more, striking upon a plan to seize the king at Meaux.

===Second civil war=== 
After the failure of the Surprise of Meaux, the Protestant army that had intended to capture the king pursued him and the court as they fled to Paris, unable to catch him on the road, Condé established a siege of the capital. Inside the city the situation was tense, as first fears of Protestant&#x27;s storming the city and then fears of starving during a siege drove much of the population into a fury. Some militant Catholics accused Montmorency and his father the Constable of treason in favour of the Protestants after the fall of Charenton-le-Pont to Condé&#x27;s army. It was rumoured that Montmorency had told the garrison to capitulate. Indeed both the Constable and Montmorency were involved in negotiations with their cousin and other representatives of the Protestants in October, however these broke down with the Constable angrily quarrelling with Coligny. The threat of a riot in Paris pushed the Montmorency&#x27;s into action, and on 10 November Constable Montmorency led an army out to break the siege, which they successfully did with a victory at Saint-Denis, though the Constable was killed during the battle. After the death of the Constable it was Montmorency who led the royal army to victory. In January 1568 Montmorency was again among the commissioners who sought to bring the war to a close, but they failed to arrive at terms. The second war was brought to a close with the Peace of Longjumeau in March of that year, the commissioners having at last succeeded in their efforts. One of the terms of the peace was that the crown would pay off the Protestant mercenaries that had been hired by Condé. To this end money was appropriate from the royal treasury, and Montmorency and the duke of Longueville went as security for the remainder of the sum which was to be provided by Cardinal Bourbon.

===Third civil war===
In May 1568 a royal council discussed how best to ensure this peace was preserved, Montmorency argued that what was necessary was for nobles to remain under arms, while a disarming of the populace of towns was undertaken. At the same time discussions were occurring concerning a new head of the army, due to the present vacancy of the office of Constable. Catherine determined that no longer would the office be dominated by powerful magnates, and that instead the king&#x27;s brother Anjou would serve as the kingdom&#x27;s lieutenant general while the office would be left vacant. Montmorency, his brother Damville and Vielleville opposed this plan, as the young Anjou was currently representing the most extreme Catholic faction at court. To break the militant hold on the young prince, Montmorency desired that he be married to Elizabeth I. At another council meeting in September 1568, a discussion about the prospect of accepting the Pope&#x27;s offer of financial relief to the financially beleaguered kingdom in return for resuming a war against heresy was discussed. The tenor of the debate became heated as Michel de l&#x27;Hôpital, chancellor of France and Lorraine sparred over the matter, Lorraine angrily denouncing Hôpital as a Protestant. Montmorency had to intervene between the two as Lorraine grabbed the elderly Hôpital&#x27;s beard and threatened to assault him. The debate settled in the war parties favour, France once more descended into civil war, however the three marshals refused to serve in the conflict.

In November 1568, Montmorency summoned the captains of the city militia to him, to explain their recent actions, which included organising book burnings and harassing Protestants in their homes. Montmorency chided them and warned that if they did not get into line with royal policy, the king would station royal troops in the capital instead. The captains rejected this threat, ominously warning Montmorency that if the captain of a ship would not do what needed to be done, the pilots would put their hands on the helm. During the third civil war Montmorency acted as an intermediary for negotiations between his kinsmen Coligny and the royal court, in the hopes of reaching a peace settlement. By this time he had a reputation in court as a member of a middle party, that would in future be termed &quot;politique&quot;, which prioritised the stability of the state over religious disputes. Radical Catholics blamed Montmorency, and Morvillier for the generous peace that brought the third war of a religion to a close, with Blaise de Monluc decrying &#x27;we defeated them over and over, yet despite that they had such good credit on the king&#x27;s council that the edicts were always favourable to them&#x27;.

===Saint-Germain-en-Laye===
As a term of the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, monuments, such as the Gastines Cross, which had been elevated to commemorate the killing of the Protestant Gastines family, had to be torn down. Montmorency was to oversee the removal of this monument, which was beloved by many of the militant Catholics of the city. The radical preacher Simon Vigor was among three delegates who travelled to Montmorency to petition him for the maintenance of the memorial. Popular opinion became increasingly violent, culminating in a riot in December 1571 in favour of its preservation. Montmorency oversaw the crushing of the unrest, furthering the hatred the militant Catholic population had for him, characterising him as a crypto-Protestant. He had one of the rioters hung and others prosecuted. Montmorency warned the king that his enemies the Guise were stockpiling weapons in the city, however nothing came of this. With anti-Protestant violence crushed under his authority in Paris, militant Parisians turned their attention to sectarian violence against Italians and &#x27;witches&#x27;, with a riot against the formers presence in the capital in June 1572. The 1570 peace had also secured his temporary ascendency at court, at the expense of the Guise who were disgraced. In July 1570 he won a battle of precedence in the court with Charles, Duke of Mayenne. 

During 1571, violence erupted in Rouen after a Protestant congregation failed to remove their hats as the host passed them, leaving 40 dead. Montmorency took charge of bringing royal justice to bear, during which he condemned 66 to death and levied fines on others. This further cemented the hatred many Catholics had for him. 

In July 1572 Montmorency was dispatched as a diplomat to England, his reputation as someone who would tolerate Protestantism making him an obvious choice for the king to have sign the Treaty of Blois which created an Anglo-French alliance. While this delighted Coligny, who saw it as the first step towards war with Spain, no further moves towards war would be taken. Montmorency too shared the desire for a return to war against Spain, recruiting soldiers for the effort with Coligny in early August 1572 but the council was in otherwise unanimous opposition.

===Massacre of Saint Bartholomew===
Having attended the wedding of Navarre and Marguerite of Valois, intended as a security for the 1570 peace, Montmorency quickly departed the city, leaving two days after the event on 20 August. His reason for leaving has been ascribed both to illness and fear of a plot against his family. He advised Coligny to leave the city with him, but he had business to attend to with the king and tarried. On 22 August an assassin made an attempt on Coligny&#x27;s life, leaving the situation in the capital explosive and without the presence of the governor to assert control over the situation and suppress disorder as he had in 1571.

With the royal council drawing up kill lists to sever the head of the Protestant leadership on 23 August, rumours would later swirl that Montmorency&#x27;s name had been floated for inclusion among the executions however if true, it was removed. Upon the Assassination of Admiral Coligny in the opening hours of the Massacre of Saint Bartholomew, Montmorency, absent from the city, was furious to hear of the killing of one of his kin. Back in 1570, he had promised the king that he would pursue vengeance if any harm came to his cousin. He renewed this vow on condition the king himself did not claim responsibility for the murder. The king initially blamed a private quarrel between Guise and the Châtillon for the killing before altering his story to assert that it had been his orders. No longer subject to the obligations of aristocratic honour to strike back in his feud, Montmorency resolved to remain loyal to the king. While staying at Senlis, he exerted his influence to prevent an expansion of the massacre that was unfolding in Paris. He took charge of Coligny&#x27;s body once he had acquired it from where it lay in Paris, ensuring that it received burial.

The following year, Montmorency participated in the siege of La Rochelle. The city had gone into rebellion following the massacre, Montmorency fought with the royal army in suppressing the city. The siege and war would ultimately be brought to an end by the king&#x27;s brother Anjou&#x27;s election as king of the Commonwealth. Upon returning to court in December 1573, the duke of Guise showed his displeasure by promptly retiring.

===Malcontents===
During January 1574, with the support of Montmorency, who was becoming a close friend, Charles IX promised the office of lieutenant-general to Alençon. In February, while the court was resident at Montmorency&#x27;s residence, the Château de Chantilly the Duke of Guise accused Montmorency of having hired the sieur de Ventabren to have him assassinated. Montmorency and Ventabren denied the charge, however Montmorency no longer feeling welcome at court departed. His withdrawal removed a moderating influence on the opposition to the Guise at court. With his absence, Charles retracted the offer of the lieutenant-generalship to Alençon, granting it to a cousin of the Guise the duke of Lorraine, in response Alençon began plotting. On 27 February a Protestant force was seen in the vicinity of the court, and while it was dispersed accusations were levelled at the ambitious Alençon and Navarre as the ringleaders of this attempt on the court. The Papal Nuncio believed Montmorency was aware of the conspiracy, but had chosen not to involve himself. Alençon and Navarre meanwhile denied the charges but were kept under watch at court which retreated to Vincennes. In April Charles managed to coax Montmorency into returning to court, shortly thereafter upon hearing of another escape attempt involving Alençon and Navarre Montmorency was placed under arrest. The nobles La Mole and Coconas, who had planned the escape were interrogated, Coconas confessed that the Montmorencies were behind the attempt, and that Alençon was to link up with the rebel prince Condé in Germany. When a false rumour reached the court that Damville, governor of Languedoc and brother of Montmorency had been captured, Montmorency and Marshal Cossé were transferred to the Bastille on 4 May. Upon learning of Damville&#x27;s survival, he was dispossed of his governate in favour of the Dauphin Montpensier.

Montmorency&#x27;s other brothers Méru and Thoré, who were more open about their rebellious desires meanwhile escaped into Germany, where they raised a mercenary army alongside Condé. The court hoped that the captivity of their brother would prevent them from crossing the border and invading France with the threat of execution.

==Reign of Henri III==
===Damville===
With the death of Charles in May 1574, Anjou hurried back from the Commonwealth to take the French throne, assuming the regnal name of Henri III. On route, he held an interview with Damville in Turin, warmly receiving the magnate and listening to his grievances about the treatment of Protestants. Henri restored Damville to his governate, and proposed a more limited toleration of Protestantism. As far as Damville&#x27;s complaints about the captivity of his brother, Henri promised to consider their situation upon his arrival in Paris. Having reached Paris Henri refused Damville&#x27;s request to release his brother. Damville accused Henri of trying to murder his brother in his cell.

In February 1575 during negotiations to end the civil war, the Protestant deputies negotiating with the crown demanded the release of Montmorency and Cossé. More politically dangerous than the renegade Montmorency brothers was the flight from his imprisonment at court of Alençon in September 1575. As a brother to the king his presence among the rebels presented a serious threat to the court. Among his many demands he listed the release of Montmorency and Cossé, a demand that was met on 2 October, the court desperate to re-secure his loyalty. In response the Montmorency brothers, once more granted freedom to manoeuvrer invaded France.

===Peace of Monsieur===
As a term of the Peace of Monsieur which brought the war to a close in May 1576, Montmorency and Cossé were restored the honours they had been stripped of upon their detainment. The edicts terms were read out to the court in his presence. The presence of Catholics on both sides of the fifth war of religion including the Montmorency family, had stripped the conflict of much of its confessional character as it devolved more openly into a battle for supremacy at court between political factions.

===Death===
Though restored to his honours, Montmorency found his influence at court did not recover from his families involvement in the Malcontent plots of 1574-5. Moreover he found himself worn and aged by his imprisonment. In March 1579 he was entrusted by Henri as a special commissioner alongside Pomponne de Bellièvre to impress the king&#x27;s demands for more money on a special session of the Estates. Upon the death of Montmorency on 6 May 1579, his brother Damville became duke of Montmorency. Damville found himself burdened by his brothers considerable debts, Montmorency having accumulated 110,000 &quot;livres&quot; in debts during his life.

<doc id="660440" wikidata="Q7621692" url="?curid=660440" title="Strasbourg Cathedral bombing plot">
<text>In December 2000, an al-Qaeda-linked plot to bomb the Strasbourg Christmas market, at the feet of the Strasbourg Cathedral, on New Year&#x27;s Eve was discovered. The plot was foiled by French and German police after a terrorist network based in Frankfurt, Germany, the &quot;Frankfurt group&quot;, was unravelled. A total of fourteen people were convicted as part of the plot; four in Germany and ten in France, including the operational leader, Mohammed Bensakhria ( &quot;Meliani&quot;), thought to be a European deputy to Osama bin Laden. The alleged mastermind of the plot was thought to have been Abu Doha, who was detained in the United Kingdom.

==Arrests==

After being tipped off by British intelligence, German police on 26 December 2000 discovered bomb-making equipment during a raid of an apartment in Frankfurt. Four men were arrested. Among the findings were several pressure cookers, 30 kg of chemicals that could be used to make explosives, and a notebook describing how to mix homemade bombs. A video was also discovered, showing a crowded Christmas market in Strasbourg, with a voiceover in Arabic calling the people in the video &quot;enemies of Allah.&quot; The voiceover, attributed to one of the suspects, further said &quot;This cathedral is Allah&#x27;s enemy,&quot; and &quot;You will go to hell, Allah willing.&quot; The call that had alerted British intelligence had been made by one in the group asking Abu Doha, the alleged mastermind of the plot, for more cash; Doha was already wanted by the United States for his connection to the Los Angeles International Airport millennium bombing plot.

Members of the Frankfurt group were found to have trained in al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, to have connections to Islamist networks in Spain, Italy, Belgium and the United Kingdom, and to the Algerian terrorist group Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC). The discovery of the plot in Frankfurt led to further arrests in the United Kingdom, where another plot of killing members of the European Parliament was discovered, in which MEPs were to be killed with sarin nerve gas during session in Strasbourg in February 2001. British police arrested twelve people including Doha in February 2001 as a result of the Frankfurt operation. All British suspects were quickly released due to &quot;lack of evidence,&quot; although Doha was subsequently re-arrested. According to the Crown Prosecution Service, the charges against six main suspects were dropped for &quot;security reasons,&quot; which was linked by others to an MI5 bid to &quot;monitor&quot; the group.

==Trials and convictions==
In March 2003, the four suspects in Frankfurt, Aeurobui Beandali, Salim Boukhari, Fouhad Sabour and Lamine Maroni were sentenced to between 10 and 12 years&#x27; imprisonment. According to the Frankfurt court, the group had planned to blow up pressure cookers packed with explosives, as they had learned in training camps in Afghanistan. The target was reported to have been the Christmas market at the Strasbourg Cathedral on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The target was said to have been chosen deliberately for its Christian symbolism. Beandali was the only to confess to the plot, while Boukhari and Sabour claimed to have planned to attack an empty synagogue in Strasbourg.

In December 2004, ten suspects were put on trial in Paris, accused of being members of the Frankfurt group. The suspects, all Algerian or French-Algerian, were sentenced to terms of up to 10 years, convicted for &quot;criminal association with a terrorist enterprise&quot; with alleged connections to terrorist networks in the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain. The group&#x27;s alleged leaders, Mohammed Bensakhria (a.k.a. Meliani, considered one of Osama bin Laden&#x27;s &quot;lieutenants&quot; in Europe), 37, and Slimane Khalfaoui, 29, were given 10 years, and Yacine Akhnouche, 30, was given eight. Bensakhria, the suspected ringleader, was thought to have fled Germany as he was arrested in Spain in 2001 and subsequently extradited to France. Rabah Kadre, 37, who was in detention in the United Kingdom was given six years, and was banned from entering French territory. The six other suspects, who received lesser terms, were convicted for giving logistical support to the plot by providing false documents to other group members.

<text>Lithuanian Brazilians (, ) are Brazilian citizens who are fully, partially or predominantly of Lithuanian descent or are Lithuanian-born people residing in Brazil.

==History==
The first Lithuanian to set foot on Brazilian soil, according to a record dated in 1866, was colonel Andrius Višteliauskas. His mission was to aid the Brazilian armed forces in the Paraguayan War. In 1890,a group of Lithuanian immigrants and their families arrived in Brazil, in a total of twenty-five Lithuanian families entered the land of Brazil. Their destination was the newly established colony of Ijuí, situated on the red and fertile soil of the northwestern part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

Today the city of Ijuí is a developed town. From early on Ijuí was settled by peoples of different ethno-linguistic backgrounds, unlike some other towns in the region. For example, the town of Guaraní das Missões was settled mostly by Polish immigrants. On the other hand, Germans, who came from the old German colonies (the Altkolonie) located in the eastern part of the state, went on to settle the municipality of Cerro Largo (formerly known as Serro Azul) and to make it into the small town that it is today.

One can still meet descendants from that first group of Lithuanian immigrants that settled in the Ijuí area. In 1926, around thirty thousand Lithuanian immigrants arrived in Brazil. They went to work in the many coffee plantations (fazendas) throughout the State of São Paulo. Other groups of immigrants also were lured into the country at the time to fulfill labor shortages. São Paulo may have been the destination of most Lithuanians but they also went to settle in other states such as Rio de Janeiro and Paraná. The town of Castro, in Paraná, a state south of São Paulo, boasts that amongst Japanese, Russians and other ethnic groups their town was also founded by Lithuanian immigrants.

The slaves of Brazil had been freed in 1888. More and more in the following decades the coffee barons of the land tried to obtain laborers from other sources, mostly from White European sources.

In São Paulo Lithuanians developed strong social ties around church congregations. Most were Catholic but many also participated in Lutheran church services.

In 1930, the núcleo (small colony) of Barão de Antonina, was established in Itaporanga, São Paulo. The center of Lithuanian life in Brazil is Vila Zelina, a district in one of the biggest megalopolises of the world – the city of São Paulo. Everything seems to revolve around the Saint Joseph Catholic Church (São José). One can still taste some of the culinary of the Old World in this part of town. Easter eggs are still celebrated in the traditional way.

In 2001, a documentary Eldorado: Lithuanians in Brazil or (Portuguese title: &quot;Eldorado: Lituanos no Brasil&quot;), by Fabiano Canosa and Julius Ziz was released about the story of Lithuanians in Brazil.

<doc id="660444" wikidata="Q5968974" url="?curid=660444" title="PurifyPlus">
<text>PurifyPlus is a memory debugger program used by software developers to detect memory access errors in programs, especially those written in C or C++. It was originally written by Reed Hastings of Pure Software. Pure Software later merged with Atria Software to form Pure Atria Software, which in turn was later acquired by Rational Software, which in turn was acquired by IBM, and then divested to UNICOM Systems, Inc. on Dec 31, 2014. It is functionally similar to other memory debuggers, such as Insure++, Valgrind and BoundsChecker.

==Overview==
PurifyPlus allows dynamic verification, a process by which a program discovers errors that occur when the program runs, much like a debugger. Static verification or static code analysis, by contrast, involves detecting errors in the source code without ever compiling or running it, just by discovering logical inconsistencies. The type checking by a C compiler is an example of static verification.

When a program is linked with PurifyPlus, corrected verification code is automatically inserted into the executable by parsing and adding to the object code, including libraries. That way, if a memory error occurs, the program will print out the exact location of the error, the memory address involved, and other relevant information. PurifyPlus also detects memory leaks. By default, a leak report is generated at program exit but can also be generated by calling the PurifyPlus leak-detection API from within an instrumented application.

The errors that PurifyPlus discovers include array bounds reads and writes, trying to access unallocated memory, freeing unallocated memory (usually due to freeing the same memory for the second time), as well as memory leaks (allocated memory with no pointer reference). Most of these errors are not fatal (at least not at the site of the error), and often when just running the program there is no way to detect them, except by observing that &quot;something&quot; is wrong due to incorrect program behavior. Hence PurifyPlus helps by detecting these errors and telling the programmer exactly where they occur. Because PurifyPlus works by instrumenting all the object code, it detects errors that occur inside of third-party or operating system libraries. These errors are often caused by the programmer passing incorrect arguments to the library calls, or by misunderstandings about the protocols for freeing data structures used by the libraries. These are often the most difficult errors to find and fix.

==Differences from traditional debuggers==
The ability to detect non-fatal errors is a major distinction between PurifyPlus and similar programs from the usual debuggers. By contrast, debuggers generally only allow the programmer to quickly find the sources of fatal errors, such as a program crash due to dereferencing a null pointer, but do not help to detect the non-fatal memory errors. Debuggers are useful for other things that PurifyPlus is not intended for, such as for stepping through the code line by line or examining the program&#x27;s memory by hand at a particular moment of execution. In other words, these tools can complement each other for a skilled developer.

PurifyPlus also includes other functionality, such as high-performance watchpoints, which are of general use while using a debugger on one&#x27;s code.

Using PurifyPlus makes the most sense in programming languages that leave memory management to the programmer. Hence, in Java, Lisp, or Visual Basic, for example, automatic memory management reduces occurrence of any memory leaks. These languages can however still have leaks; unnecessary references to objects will prevent the memory from being re-allocated. IBM has a product called Rational Application Developer to uncover these sorts of errors.

<doc id="660445" wikidata="Q2074267" url="?curid=660445" title="Lomi-lomi salmon">
<text>Lomi-lomi salmon (or lomi salmon) is a side dish in Hawaiian cuisine containing salted salmon, onions, and tomatoes. Its origin is similar to &quot;poisson cru&quot;. It resembles &quot;pico de gallo&quot; not only in appearance, but also in the way it is often consumed: as an accompaniment (or condiment) to other foods, in this case &quot;poi&quot; or &quot;kalua pork&quot;.

Hawaiians of yesteryear would probably not recognize the contemporary version of this dish served today. However, it is seen today as a quintessential side dish when serving traditional Hawaiian foods or at traditional lū‘au festivities. While salmon is not a fish found in Hawaiian waters, and onions and tomatoes are not &quot;pre-contact&quot; foods, &quot;lomilomi salmon&quot; is still embraced as an ethnic Hawaiian dish. It is appropriate that dish should be known popularly by its hapa name &quot;lomi salmon&quot; rather than &quot;lomi kāmano&quot;.

A similar dish called &quot;lomi ōpae&quot; ( lit. &quot;shrimp&quot;) uses dried shrimp in place of salted salmon and was made popular by singer Henry Kapono.

==Preparation==
Hawaiians were first introduced to salmon around the early 1800s, as contract laborers sent to the Pacific Northwest. Salmon would have likely been traditionally prepared as &quot;poke&quot;. A typical relish was made of &quot;inamona&quot; mixed with dried &quot;alaala&quot; (octopus liver) and &quot;ʻalaea&quot; salt. The poke was accompanied with several types of &quot;akaakai&quot; (onion), &quot;limu kohu&quot; and a large bowl of poi. 

A type of &quot;poke&quot; in essence, the name &quot;lomilomi&quot; is taken from the traditional method of preparation (Hawaiian for &quot;to massage&quot;) where fresh fish is rubbed with salt in varying amounts to simply season it for flavor or to cure it for preservation. In the evolution of this dish from its &quot;poke&quot; origins, the salt salmon is then cubed into small ~1cm pieces and again massaged into chopped tomatoes and onions of about the same size. Some modern recipes call for scallions, cucumbers, chilis, additional salt, or lime, or even fish substitutes other than salmon and is typically served chilled or with ice.

==Background==
When Captain James Cook arrived in 1778, he brought along with him the concept of preserved fish and meat—such as salted cod and corned beef—common rations of foreign navies, whalers, and traders.

In the 1790s, Spanish horticulturist Francisco de Paula Marin brought tomatoes to the Hawaiian Islands. He was the first to successfully cultivate and raise tomatoes. De Paula Marin further popularized the planting of onions.

In 1829, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, a fur trading company looking to expand its business in new resources discovered during the expeditions of the Northwest Passage, established an office in Honolulu to market the Pacific Northwest&#x27;s abundant timber to a growing non-native settlement. The company would hire many Hawaiians as sailors and laborers in the fur and lumber trades. The physical strength of the native Hawaiians had made an impression on the British. Dozens were initially sent to their British Columbia facilities which also operated commercial fisheries at its Fort Langley trading post. Many were likely to have consumed fresh and cured salmon, which became a very important commodity.

By 1840, around 300 to 400 native Hawaiian laborers were sent to the Northwest in vessels and at ports. Many of these laborers chose to permanently settle in the Northwest after their contracts expired. For those returning to Hawaii, the voyage took about three weeks. Since fresh salmon would not last the journey, these laborers introduced salted salmon, which immediately became popular.

The practice of salting fish for preservation was already known to the ancient Hawaiians, and was often consumed with poi during periods when the regular fish supply was scarce or when fishing was not possible like during storms. Fish was preferably eaten raw with some alaea salt or sometimes seasoned with blood from the gills. The families of missionaries found salted salmon to be a substitute for salt cod—the New England standby. Similarly, the Portuguese starting in the late 1800s brought with them &quot;bacalhau&quot;, a Portuguese salted cod.

The Northwest was exporting 3,000 to 4,000 barrels of salted salmon, mainly to Hawaii and Asia by 1835. Following the formation of a constitutional monarchy in Hawaii, the first tariff act took effect on January 1, 1843. The first vessel to make customs entry and to pay the &quot;ad valorem tax&quot; at three percent was the Hudson&#x27;s Bay barque &quot;Vancouver&quot; from the Columbia River, January 6, 1843. The vessel&#x27;s cargo consisted of 695 barrels of Columbia River salmon valued at $4,170 ($172,261 in 2023), and 160 twelve-foot four-inch planks valued at $307.20 ($12,690.31 in 2023). On this amount $134.32 ($5,548.70 in 2023) in duty was collected.

Paradis became a star at the age of 14 with the international success of her single &quot;Joe le taxi&quot; (1987). At age 18, she was awarded France&#x27;s highest honours as both a singer and an actress with the Prix Romy Schneider and the César Award for Most Promising Actress for Jean-Claude Brisseau&#x27;s &quot;Noce Blanche&quot;, as well as the Victoires de la Musique for Best Female Singer for her album &quot;Variations sur le même t&#x27;aime&quot;.

In 2022, she was nominated for the Molière Award for Best Actress for her performance in the play &quot;Maman&quot;.

She has been a muse to numerous musicians and lyricists who each took one of her albums under their aegis, including Étienne Roda-Gil (1988), Serge Gainsbourg (1990), Lenny Kravitz (1992), Matthieu Chedid (2007), Benjamin Biolay (2013), Samuel Benchetrit and The Bees (2018). As a model, Paradis has appeared on more than 300 magazine covers worldwide including &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;, &quot;Madame Figaro&quot;, &quot;Paris Match&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Premiere&quot;, and &quot;Marie Claire&quot;.

Paradis was made &quot;Officier&quot; (Officer) in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 2011 and was named &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) in the &quot;Ordre national de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; in 2015.

== Early life ==
Paradis was born in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, near Paris, to interior designers André and Corinne Paradis. As a child she enrolled in dance lessons, learnt the basics of piano, and attended child model casting sessions. At the age of seven, Paradis appeared on the local television program &quot;L&#x27;École des fans&quot;, a talent show for child singers.

== Career ==
=== 1983–1991 ===

Paradis recorded her first single, &quot;La Magie des surprises-parties&quot;, in 1983 and performed it in an Italian festival in 1985. Although not a hit, it paved the way for the song with which she became internationally famous, &quot;Joe le taxi,&quot; composed by Franck Langolff in 1987, when she was 14. It was number one in France for 11 weeks and, unusually for a song sung in French, was released in the United Kingdom, where it reached number three. It was taken from her first album &quot;M&amp;J&quot; (for &quot;Marilyn &amp; John&quot;) which placed 13th in France, but did not enter the British chart.

In March 1989, at age 16, she left high school to pursue her singing career. Paradis released the album &quot;Variations sur le même t&#x27;aime&quot; in 1990, containing a remake of the Lou Reed song &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. The album was written by French composer Serge Gainsbourg, whom she met when she received the best singer award at Victoires de la Musique, on 4 February 1990.

In 1990, she won the César Award for Most Promising Actress for her role in &quot;Noce Blanche&quot;.

In 1991, Paradis promoted the fragrance &quot;Coco&quot; for Chanel. In the advertisement, she was covered in black feathers, portraying a bird swinging in a cage. The advert was shot by Jean-Paul Goude. Paradis spoke of her continued admiration of Chanel in 2010 saying, &quot;The more I know them, the more I love Chanel.&quot;

=== 1992–1996 ===
In 1992, Paradis moved to the United States to work with Lenny Kravitz, whom she was dating at the time. Paradis started working on a new album in English, a language she was now fluent in. Written and produced by Kravitz, the album, titled &quot;Vanessa Paradis&quot;, topped the French chart and briefly made the UK listings (number 45). One of the singles from it was &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, which made number 5 in France and gave her another Top 10 hit in the UK, peaking at number six.

In March 1993, Paradis started her first international tour, the Natural High Tour; she performed in France, England and Canada. In February 1994, &quot;Live&quot; was released in France. In April 1994, Paradis filmed &quot;Élisa&quot;, under the direction of Jean Becker. &quot;Elisa&quot; was a big success in France and was released internationally.

=== 1997–2006 ===
In 1997, Paradis played in &quot;Un amour de sorcière&quot; with Jeanne Moreau and Jean Reno, before filming &quot;Une chance sur deux&quot;, with Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo. In March 1999, &quot;La fille sur le Pont&quot;, by Patrice Leconte was released. This movie was shot and released in black and white. In 2004, she promoted Chanel&#x27;s new handbags called &quot;Ligne Cambon&quot;.

In 2005, she modeled for Chanel again for &quot;The New Mademoiselle&quot; handbag. In 2008, she modelled for Miu Miu. Meanwhile, she was included in the French children&#x27;s album and concert &quot;Le Soldat Rose&quot; in 2006.

=== 2007–present ===
Paradis released a new album (&quot;Divinidylle&quot;) in 2007 which was released in the UK on 11 December (September in France). There are three versions (regular, limited edition, and the Christmas edition). She started the Divinidylle Tour in October. Some concerts were filmed, and a DVD/CD of the tour was released. Paradis won two &quot;Les Victoires de la Musique&quot; awards for this album in February 2008. Some of her later projects are a greatest hits CD (&quot;Best of Vanessa Paradis&quot;), which includes the commercial jingle &quot;I love Paris in the Springtime&quot;; she also starred in the animated film &quot;Un monstre à Paris&quot;, released in 2010.

Canadian film director Jean-Marc Vallée cast Paradis in a starring role in his film &quot;Café de Flore&quot;, in which she plays the single mother of a child with Down syndrome in the 1960s. The film was released in 2011, and Paradis garnered a Genie Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the 2012 Genie Awards.

Paradis released an acoustic album in November 2010 entitled &quot;Une nuit à Versailles&quot;. The album was recorded at L&#x27;Opéra of the Palace of Versailles during her Vanessa Paradis Concert Acoustique Tour. She also released a set of DVDs in 2010 called &quot;Anthologie&quot; which collected rare live performances and interviews from 1987 to 2007.

In 2010 she became the face of Chanel&#x27;s new lipstick, Rouge Coco. She also became the face of their new handbag line, Ranger.

Her 2011 international tour included performances in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Europe and Turkey.

In May 2013, Paradis released a new album, &quot;Love Songs&quot;, a double LP produced by French singer and producer Benjamin Biolay. The first single, &quot;Love Song&quot;, was also written by Biolay. The second single was &quot;Les espaces et les sentiments&quot;. The third single, &quot;Mi Amor&quot;, was written by BB Brunes frontman Adrien Gallo. Other people that have contributed to the songwriting of the album include Mickey 3D frontman Mickaël Furnon, as well as Johnny Depp and Lily-Rose Depp.

In 2016, Paradis co-starred in &quot;Yoga Hosers&quot; with her daughter Lily-Rose, as a history teacher. The same year, she was a member of the main competition jury of the 2016 Cannes Film Festival.

In September 2021, Paradis made her theatre debut in the play &quot;Maman&quot;, written and directed by her husband, Samuel Benchetrit, at the Edouard VII theatre in Paris. For her performance in the play, she was nominated for the Molière Award for Best Actress in a Private Theatre.

== Personal life ==
At 15, Paradis started dating 26-year-old French singer Florent Pagny. The relationship ended in 1991. From 1991 to 1996, she was in a relationship with Lenny Kravitz, who also produced her 1992 self-titled album. She dated French actor Stanislas Merhar from 1997 to 1998.

From 1998 to 2012, Paradis was in a relationship with American actor Johnny Depp. They have a daughter, Lily-Rose Depp (born 1999) and a son John &quot;Jack&quot; Christopher Depp III (Jack Depp), born in 2002.

In May 2014, at a Chanel show in Dubai, Vanessa Paradis confirmed her relationship with French singer Benjamin Biolay. They broke up in May 2015. In November 2016, she began dating Samuel Benchetrit, who directed her in his fifth film, &quot;Dog&quot;. In June 2018, Paradis and Benchetrit married in the town of Saint-Siméon. Vanessa Paradis has a country estate nearby, and her late father owned a small restaurant in the quiet country commune.

Paradis&#x27;s sister, Alysson Paradis, is also an actress.

<text>Roissy-en-France (, &quot;Roissy-in-France&quot; after the Pays de France), colloquially simply called Roissy, is a commune in the northeastern outer suburbs of Paris, France, in the Val-d&#x27;Oise department. It is located from the centre of Paris.

One-quarter of Charles de Gaulle Airport (France&#x27;s main airport) is located in the commune (but none of its terminals), which gave its name to the airport originally. Later renamed, the airport is still commonly referred to as &quot;Roissy&quot; in France. The rest of the airport lies on the territory of Tremblay-en-France and several other communes.

==Name==
In the name Roissy-en-France, &#x27;France&#x27; refers not to the country of France but to an area (&quot;pays&quot;) of the historical province of Île-de-France. Île-de-France was made up of several &quot;pays&quot;, most notably Pays de France and Hurepoix. Pays de France was the fertile plain located immediately north of the City of Paris, with the city of Saint-Denis at its centre. Pays de France is now almost entirely built up and is covered by the northern suburbs of Paris. Pays de France is also known as &quot;Parisis&quot; and as the &quot;plaine de France&quot; (&quot;plain of France&quot;), and its name still appears in the name of some communes in the northern suburbs of Paris, such as Roissy-en-France (which literally means &quot;Roissy in the Pays de France&quot;).

==Population==
==Transport==
Roissy-en-France is not served by Paris Métro, RER, or suburban rail network. The closest station to Roissy-en-France is Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 1 station on line B of the RER, Paris Region&#x27;s express suburban rail system. This station is located inside the airport, on the part of the airport belonging to the commune of Tremblay-en-France, from the town center of Roissy-en-France.

==Economy==
Blue Line, a charter passenger airline, had its head office in Building B of Paris Nord 2, Parc des Lumières in Roissy-en-France.

Air France&#x27;s head office is located in the Roissypôle complex on the grounds of Charles de Gaulle Airport and in Tremblay-en-France, near Roissy-en-France.

==Education==
The community has two schools, école maternelle Saint-Exupéry (preschool) and école élémentaire Jean Mermoz.

==Literary reference==
Roissy is the location where the action of the two explicit sadomasochistic novels &quot;Story of O&quot; (&quot;Histoire d&#x27;O&quot;), and its sequel &quot;Retour à Roissy&quot; by Pauline Réage take place.

<doc id="660454" wikidata="Q353952" url="?curid=660454" title="Adelaide, South Africa">
<text>Adelaide is a rural town and farming area in the province of Eastern Cape, South Africa. Adelaide is situated at the foothills of the Great Winterberg mountain range, east of Bedford and west of Fort Beaufort.

== History ==
=== Before European arrival ===
The first recorded settlement of the modern day area of Adelaide was during the late 18th and 19th centuries, when white farmers (known as trekboers) settled here and started productive farming. Before that time there may have been some dispersed groups of Bushmen, however they left no written records.

=== Colonial Adelaide ===
Adelaide&#x27;s origins date back to 1835 when a British officer named Captain Alexander Boswell Armstrong (1787–1862) established a military encampment which he named &quot;Fort Adelaide&quot; after Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, wife of King William IV. Despite the earlier English settlers, who were part of the 1820 Settlers, later on a large number of both Scottish and Afrikaans people soon immigrated here too. The Scottish were also the first to erect a church in the local area.

== Modern day Adelaide ==
Adelaide is an important centre for wool and sheep farming. Beef, mutton, venison, and citrus fruit are also important products. The specialised abattoir for venison (farm-hunted game meat) operating in the central town provides much needed employment to the local residents.

About 2,300 Coloureds reside in the Bezuidenhoutville township from the central town, and represent 19% of Adelaide&#x27;s inhabitants. Lingelethu is the largest Black African township in Adelaide, with a census exceeding 6,000 and a population share of 77% of the municipal area.

<text>The Five Towns is an informal grouping of villages and hamlets in Nassau County, United States on the South Shore of western Long Island adjoining the border with Queens County in New York City. Although there is no official Five Towns designation, &quot;the basic five are Lawrence, Cedarhurst, Woodmere, Hewlett and Inwood.&quot; Each of these &quot;towns&quot; has a consecutive stop on the Far Rockaway Branch of the Long Island Rail Road. All five communities are part of the Town of Hempstead. Woodmere is the largest and most populous community in the Five Towns, while Inwood is the second largest community in the Five Towns.

The area also includes some unincorporated communities and two small villages, Hewlett Bay Park and Woodsburgh, that are not added to the final total. Despite the name, none of these communities is a town. The Five Towns is usually said to comprise the villages of Lawrence and Cedarhurst, the hamlets of Woodmere and Inwood, and &quot;The Hewletts,” which consist of the villages of Hewlett Bay Park, Hewlett Harbor, and Hewlett Neck, and the hamlet of Hewlett, along with Woodsburgh.

North Woodmere is technically one of the &quot;Five Towns&quot; as it is served by the Five Towns&#x27; two local high schools and its constituents use the &quot;Five Towns&quot; many public services. Others do not consider it to be part of the &quot;Five Towns,&quot; as it is a section of Valley Stream, separated from the rest of the Five Towns by Motts Creek. Atlantic Beach, which is located across a drawbridge from Lawrence on a barrier island it shares with Long Beach, Lido Beach and Point Lookout, is culturally linked to the Five Towns, with its students attending Five Towns public schools, but it is usually — though not always — excluded from the designation.

==History==
The name &quot;Five Towns&quot; dates back to 1931, when individual Community Chest groups in the area banded together to form the &quot;Five Towns Community Chest&quot;, consisting of Inwood, Lawrence, Cedarhurst, Woodmere, and Hewlett. The organization still exists (as of 2018) as a local charity, but the &quot;Five Towns&quot; moniker caught on as a designation for the entire area. A 1933 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; references a Girl Scouts of the USA encampment by the &quot;Five Towns Council, embracing the villages of Inwood, Lawrence, Cedarhurst, Woodmere and Hewlett&quot;, listed in order by LIRR station.

One notable characteristic of the Five Towns is that despite the reputation of the South Shore of Nassau County being more urbanized than the North Shore, the Five Towns retains hamlets that resemble areas along Long Island&#x27;s Gold Coast on the North Shore with enormous mansions and exclusive private communities 
along the water. &quot;The New York Times&quot; used the term &quot;affluent&quot; in describing the area. Inwood, however, is much less affluent than the other &quot;towns,&quot; with a more urban character and a significantly more ethnically diverse population.

==Education==
There are two school districts in the Five Towns, the Lawrence Public Schools (District 15) and the Hewlett-Woodmere School District (District 14). Roughly speaking, the Lawrence school district contains all of Lawrence, Cedarhurst and Inwood, and parts of Woodmere, North Woodmere, and Woodsburgh, while the Hewlett-Woodmere district contains all of Hewlett and part of Woodmere and extends partly into the neighboring villages of Lynbrook and Valley Stream (North Woodmere and Gibson in particular).

In addition, there are many private schools in the Five Towns. Among them are the independent school, Lawrence Woodmere Academy, and Jewish schools, Hebrew Academy of the Five Towns and Rockaway (HAFTR), Hebrew Academy of Long Beach (HALB), and Yeshiva of South Shore.

===Five Towns College===
Although Lawrence was planned to be the location for Five Towns College, the original site was no longer available by the time the school received its charter in 1972. The college is currently located in Dix Hills, Suffolk County. Other than the proposed original site, the school never had a physical connection to the Five Towns.

== Jewish community ==

By the 1980s, the Five Towns had developed a large Jewish community. The UJA-Federation of New York estimated that 35,000 Jews lived in the area, out of a total of 47,048 counted in the 1980 census, with a growing number of Orthodox Jews. By 2010, the Five Towns hosted a large number of synagogues, Jewish private schools, and kosher restaurants. The Orthodox community had become so large that many incoming Orthodox families chose to move to adjoining areas like Far Rockaway and North Woodmere.

== Publications ==
As of February 2019, the Five Towns has two weekly local publications: The &quot;Nassau Herald&quot; and The Five Towns Jewish Times.

==In popular culture==
* The 1993 movie &quot;Amongst Friends&quot;, by Rob Weiss, was filmed and set in the Five Towns.
*The television show &quot;Entourage&quot; features a fictional show titled &quot;Five Towns&quot;, in which Johnny Drama stars as a character. The producer of the show was supposed to be actor-director Edward Burns, who in real life grew up in Valley Stream but attended Hewlett High School. When shown on &quot;Entourage&quot; the Five Towns is oddly portrayed as a gritty industrial area. 
*In Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 1963 debut novel &quot;V.&quot;, he mentions the Five Towns; however, he includes Malverne as being part of the group.
* In the film &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, when trying to get Henry to come along on a double date, Tommy mentions that his date lives in the Five Towns.
* Opening scene to &quot;Married to the Mob&quot; was filmed at the Cedarhurst train station (but with the trains going in the reverse direction per the director&#x27;s decision).

<text>Marsileaceae () is a small family of heterosporous aquatic and semi-aquatic ferns, though at first sight they do not physically resemble other ferns. The group is commonly known as the &quot;pepperwort family&quot; or as the &quot;water-clover family&quot; because the leaves of the genus &quot;Marsilea&quot; superficially resemble the leaves of a four-leaf clover. In all, the family contains three genera and 50 to 80 species with most of those belonging to &quot;Marsilea&quot;.

==Natural history==
Members of the Marsileaceae are aquatic or semi-aquatic. Plants often grow in dense clumps in mud along the shores of ponds or streams, or they may grow submerged in shallow water with some of the leaves extending to float on the water surface. They grow in seasonally wet habitats, but survive the winter or dry season by losing their leaves and producing hard, desiccation-resistant reproductive structures.

There are only three living genera in the family Marsileaceae. The majority of species (about 45 to 70) belong to the genus &quot;Marsilea&quot;, which grows worldwide in warm-temperate and tropical regions. &quot;Marsilea&quot; can be distinguished from the other two genera by the presence of four leaflets on each leaf, although some species occasionally produce six leaflets per leaf. A second genus &quot;Regnellidium&quot; includes a single living species that grows only in southern Brazil and neighboring parts of Argentina; it has only two leaflets per leaf. The third genus &quot;Pilularia&quot; grows widely in temperate regions of both the northern and southern hemispheres. Its leaves do not subdivide into leaflets but are slender and tapered to a point, so that it is often overlooked and mistaken for a grass. There are only about five species known.

The closest relatives of the Marsileaceae are the Salviniaceae, which are also aquatic and heterosporous. However, both of these other fern families float freely on the surface of ponds or lakes instead of rooting in soil or mud. The close relationship of these groups to the Marsileaceae is supported by both morphologic and molecular analysis, as well as by the discovery of an intermediate fossil named &quot;Hydropteris&quot;. In general, the Salviniaceae and Azollaceae have a much better fossil record than the Marsileaceae. Until recently, &quot;Rodeites dakshinii&quot; was the oldest fossil member known; it is a preserved sporocarp containing spores, found in Tertiary chert of India. In 2000, the discovery of fossilized sporocarps from the Cretaceous of eastern North America was announced. These fossils were assigned to the species &quot;Regnellidium upatoiensis&quot;, and pushed the known history of the Marsileaceae back into the Mesozoic. Other remains include &quot;Regnellites nagashimae&quot; from the Upper Jurassic or Lower Cretaceous of Japan. The fossils include leaves with visible veins, as well as sporocarps. The currently oldest known member of the family is &quot;Flabellariopteris,&quot; described in 2014 from isolated leaves dating to the Late Triassic in Liaoning, China.

==Morphology==
The Marsileaceae share many of the basic structural characteristics common to most ferns, but the differences are more noticeable than the similarities. Species of this family have long, slender rhizomes that creep along or beneath the ground. Their fronds (leaves) grow in distinct clusters at nodes along the rhizome, with wide spacing between leaf clusters. As a result, the plants appear to be more stem than leaf, unlike other ferns.

Roots grow primarily from the same nodes as the leaves, but may also grow from other locations along the rhizome. The roots of &quot;Marsilea&quot; and &quot;Regnellidium&quot; are noteworthy for containing vessel elements. Vessels have also been found in the rhizome of two species of &quot;Marsilea&quot;. These vessels have evolved independently of vessels in other groups of plants.

The leaves are the most easily observed characteristic for the Marsileaceae; they have a long slender leaf stalk ending in zero, two, or four (occasionally six) leaflets. The number of leaflets differs among the three genera and can therefore be used for identification. In &quot;Pilularia&quot;, the leaves are narrowly cylindrical and taper to a point. Leaves of &quot;Regnellidium&quot; bear two broad leaflets, while leaves of &quot;Marsilea&quot; bear four leaflets at the tip. The four leaflets on the leaf of &quot;Marsilea&quot; are not borne equally. Instead, they are borne in pairs with one pair of leaflets attached slightly higher than the other. Thus in the developing leaf, the leaflets are folded more like the wings of a butterfly than like the leaflets of a clover.

As with other ferns, the leaves develop in a circinate pattern. They begin as small, tight spirals which unroll as the leaf matures. At full maturity they are held erect with the leaflets unfolded, except in &quot;Pilularia&quot; whose leaves have no blade. Temperate species are deciduous, losing their vegetative leaves in winter. Tropical species may also lose their leaves during the dry season. These leaves are photosynthetic, and produce most of the food used by the plant.

Some aquatic species of &quot;Marsilea&quot;, especially those growing with their rhizome submerged, may have vegetative leaves that are dimorphic. Some of their leaves grow up to the surface of the water, and look just like leaves of species growing out of water. These plants also produce other leaves with shorter leaf stalks that are not long enough to reach the surface, and so the leaflets remain underwater. These leaves have different anatomical and cellular characteristics better suited to their submerged environment.

In addition to their vegetative (sterile) leaflets, all species of Marsileaceae produce fertile (spore-producing) leaflets at or near the base of the photosynthetic leaves. This reproductive portion looks and functions very differently from the vegetative portion of the leaves.

==Life cycle==
Like other ferns, members of the Marsileaceae produce spores, but not seeds when they reproduce. Unlike other ferns, the spores in this family are produced inside sporocarps. These are hairy, short-stalked, bean-shaped structures usually 3 to 8 mm in diameter with a hardened outer covering. This outer covering is tough and resistant to drying out, allowing the spores inside to survive unfavorable conditions such as winter frost or summer desiccation. Despite this toughness, the sporocarps will open readily in water if conditions are favorable, and specimens have been successfully germinated after being stored for more than 130 years. Each growing season, only one sporocarp typically develops per node along the rhizome near the base of the other leaf-stalks, though in some species of &quot;Marsilea&quot; there may be two or occasionally as many as twenty. The resemblance of the sporocarps to peppercorns gives the family its common name of &quot;pepperwort&quot;.

The sporocarps are functionally and developmentally modified leaflets, although they have much shorter stalks than the vegetative leaflets. Inside the sporocarp, the modified leaflets bear several sori, each of which consists of several sporangia covered by a thin hood of tissue (the indusium). Each sorus includes a mix of two types of sporangium, each type producing only one of two kinds of spores. Toward the center of each sorus and developing first are the megasporangia, each of which will produce a single large female megaspore. Surrounding them at the edge of the sorus and developing later are the microsporangia, each of which will produce many small male microspores.

Because the Marsileaceae produce two kinds of spore (and thus two kinds of gametophyte), they are called heterosporous. While heterospory is the norm among all plants with seeds, such as the flowering plants and conifers, it is very rare among other groups of plants. Also, most heterosporous plants produce their two kinds of sporangia in different places on the plant. Since the Marsileaceae grow both kinds together in a single cluster, they differ from other plants in this regard as well.

The spores remain dormant inside the sporocarp through unfavorable conditions, but when conditions are suitable and wet, the sporocarp will germinate. It splits into halves, allowing the tissue coiled inside to become hydrated. As this internal tissue swells with water, it pushes the halves of the hard outer covering apart, and emerges as a long gelatinous worm-like sorophore. The sorophore is a sorus-bearing structure unique to the Marsileaceae; it may extend to more than ten times the length of the sporocarp inside which it was coiled. This extension carries the numerous spore-producing sori attached along each side of the sorophore out into the water.

==Human uses==
Some species of &quot;Marsilea&quot; are cultivated in garden pools or aquaria. The Indigenous Australians once made a porridge of pulverized &quot;Marsilea&quot; sporocarps called &quot;nardoo&quot;. However, the sporocarps contain toxic levels of thiaminase, so careful preparation methods must be used in order for the &quot;nardoo&quot; to be safe for consumption.

<doc id="660508" wikidata="Q836341" url="?curid=660508" title="Salvinia">
<text>Salvinia or watermosses is a genus of free-floating aquatic ferns in the family Salviniaceae. The genus is named in honor of 17th-century Italian naturalist Anton Maria Salvini, and the generic name was first published in 1754 by French botanist Jean-François Séguier in &quot;Plantae Veronenses&quot;, a description of the plants found around Verona. Twelve species are recognized, at least three of which (&quot;S. molesta&quot;, &quot;S. herzogii&quot;, and &quot;S. minima&quot;) are believed to be hybrids in part because their sporangia are found to be empty.

&quot;Salvinia&quot; is related to the other water ferns, including the mosquito fern &quot;Azolla&quot;. Recent sources include both &quot;Azolla&quot; and &quot;Salvinia&quot; in Salviniaceae, although each genus was formerly given its own family.

&quot;Salvinia&quot;, like the other ferns in order Salviniales, are heterosporous, producing spores of differing sizes. However, leaf development in &quot;Salvinia&quot; is unique. The upper side of the floating leaf, which appears to face the stem axis, is morphologically abaxial.

&quot;Salvinia cucullata&quot; is one of just two fern species for which a reference genome has been published.

==Description==
Small, floating aquatics with creeping stems, branched, bearing hairs on the leaf surface papillae but no true roots. Leaves are in trimerous whorls, with two leaves green, sessile or short-petioled, flat, entire and floating, and one leaf finely dissected, petiolate, rootlike and pendent. Submerged leaves bearing sori that are surrounded by basifixed membranous indusia (sporocarps).

They bear sporocarps of two types, either megasporangia that are few in number (approximately 10), each with single megaspore, or many microsporangia, each with 64 microspores. Spores are of two kinds and sizes, both globose, trilete. Megagametophytes and microgametophytes protruding through sporangium wall; megagametophytes floating on water surface with archegonia directed downward; microgametophytes remaining fixed to sporangium wall.

The small, hairlike growths, known as trichomes or microgametical follicles, are not known to have any productive function, and are currently a biological mystery.

==Phylogeny==
Phylogeny of &quot;Salvinia&quot;
Other species include:
* &quot;S. biloba&quot; 
* &quot;S. ×delasotae&quot; {&quot;Salvinia sprucei&quot; × &quot;Salvinia minima&quot;}
* &quot;S. hastata&quot; 
* &quot;S. martynii&quot; 
* &quot;S. nuriana&quot; 
* &quot;S. nymphellula&quot; 
* &quot;S. sprucei&quot; 

==Evolutionary history==
The geography of &quot;Salvinia&quot; fossil material suggests members of the genus may have been broadly distributed during the Tertiary.

==Distribution==
Distribution is mostly tropical, in North America, Mexico, West Indies, Central America, South America, Eurasia and Africa, including Madagascar, South Borneo, Asia.

==Economic impacts==
Giant salvinia (&quot;Salvinia molesta&quot;) is a commonly introduced invasive weed in warm climates, but is native to South America. It grows rapidly, up to two times its dry weight in days, and forms dense mats over still waters. A tiny weevil, &quot;Cyrtobagous salviniae&quot;, has been used successfully to biologically control giant salvinia.

One proposed use takes advantage of the hydrophobic trichomes, which do not repel oil. This makes them candidates for mopping up oil spills, as they become saturated with oil in thirty seconds. &quot;S. molesta&quot; trichomes served as a model for a similarly hydrophobic synthetic polycarbonate.

==Salvinia effect==
The salvinia effect describes the stabilization of an air layer upon a submerged hydrophobic (water repellent) surface by hydrophilic (water loving) pins. This physic-chemical phenomenon was discovered on the floating fern &quot;Salvinia molesta&quot; by the botanist Wilhelm Barthlott (Universität Bonn) while working on the Lotus effect and was described in cooperation with the physicist Thomas Schimmel (Karlsruher Institut für Technologie), fluid mechanist Alfred Leder (Universität Rostock) and their colleagues in 2010.

<text>In engineering, a serviceability failure occurs when a structure does not collapse, but rather fails to meet the required specifications. For example, severe wind may cause an excess of vibration at a pedestrian bridge making it impossible to cross it safely or comfortably. Similar excessive vibrations can be caused by pedestrians due to their walking, running, or jumping. Similarly, storm conditions may cause water to spill over a coastal structure, so that boats are not safe behind the structure.

Examples of serviceability failures include deformations, vibration, cracking, and leakages.</text><links>

<text>Guy Barnett (born 4 April 1962) is an Australian politician. He is a member of the Liberal Party and was appointed deputy premier of Tasmania in 2024. He has been a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly since 2014 and has been a state government minister since 2016. He was previously a Senator for Tasmania from 2002 to 2011.

==Early life==
Barnett was born on 5 April 1962 in Launceston, Tasmania. He is the son of Sallie Sinclair () and John Barnett, a sheep farmer. His father died of motor neurone disease in 1985 and his mother was a founder of the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Tasmania. She later remarried to businessman Raymond Ferrall.

Barnett was raised at Quamby Estate, his parents&#x27; historic grazing property near Hagley. He attended the Launceston Church Grammar School and Geelong Grammar School. He gained a Bachelor of Laws and later a Master of Laws (Environmental Law) from the University of Tasmania. While at university, he served as president of the University of Tasmania Liberal Club.

Barnett worked as a lawyer after graduating, including in Washington, D.C. as a consultant at Taft Stettinius &amp; Hollister. He was a senior adviser to Tasmanian premier Robin Gray from 1988 to 1989 and was later managing director of Guy Barnett and Associates, a political and public relations consultancy, from 1989 to 2002. He was an accomplished real tennis player, competing in the doubles event of the 1998 Australian Open.

==Federal politics==
Barnett was appointed to the Senate on 26 February 2002 to fill a casual vacancy caused by the resignation of Brian Gibson. He was elected to a six-year term in his own right at the 2004 federal election.

Barnett was active in various Senate committees and served as chair of the Standing Committee on Publications from 2006 to 2007 and of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs from 2007 to 2008.

In a November 2008 preselection ballot, Barnett was placed in third position on the Liberal Party&#x27;s Senate ticket in Tasmania for the next federal election, behind Eric Abetz and Stephen Parry. The result was widely reported as a demotion, given the party had only secured two Senate seats in Tasmania at the previous election. Barnett lost his seat at the 2010 election, with his term expiring on 30 June 2011.

==State politics==
In the 2014 Tasmanian state election Barnett was elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly representing the Division of Lyons for the Liberal Party. He was also appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Premier.

In July 2016, after the resignation of Adam Brooks, he was appointed Minister for Resources and Minister for Building and Construction. He was also made Minister for Energy in 2017 and Minister for Primary Industries and Water in 2018.

Barnett served as Minister for State Development, Construction and Housing under Jeremy Rockliff from April 2022 to July 2023. He was then appointed Minister for Health, serving until April 2024. In October 2023, following a ministerial reshuffle caused by the resignation of Elise Archer, he was additionally appointed Attorney-General of Tasmania, at which point he relinquished the Energy and Renewables portfolio.

Barnett was elected deputy leader of the Tasmanians Liberals in October 2024, following the resignation of Michael Ferguson. He was consequently appointed deputy premier of Tasmania.

== Policy positions ==

Barnett was a strong advocate for the War in Iraq, justifying the war in a speech to the senate on 20 March 2003.

Barnett is a republican. In 2006, he proposed abolishing the Queen&#x27;s Birthday public holiday in favour of a &quot;more Australian-oriented holiday&quot; and stated that the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours should instead be awarded on Anzac Day.

In June 2008, Barnett moved a motion in the Senate to end Medicare funding for abortions occurring after the second trimester, stating that there should be &quot;compassion and care for the unborn, we want to show love and concern for them rather than killing them in many cases for psychosocial reasons, which is effectively abortion on request&quot;.
Barnett opposed same-sex marriage in the 2017 postal plebiscite.

<doc id="660546" wikidata="Q18003128" url="?curid=660546" title="The Thinker">
<text>The Thinker (), by Auguste Rodin, is a bronze sculpture depicting a nude male figure of heroic size, seated on a large rock, leaning forward, right elbow placed upon the left thigh, back of the right hand supporting the chin in a posture evocative of deep thought and contemplation. This universally recognized expression of “deep thought” has made the sculpture one of the most widely known artworks in the world. It has become the iconic symbol of &quot;thinking&quot;; images of the sculpture in profile are often used to indicate philosophy and other practices of contemplation or introspection.

Rodin conceived the figure as part of his work &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot; commissioned in 1880, but the first of the familiar monumental bronze castings was made in 1904, and is now exhibited at the Musée Rodin, in Paris.

There are 27 other known full-sized bronze castings of the figure, approximately tall, though not all were made under Rodin&#x27;s supervision. Various other versions, several in plaster, as well as studies and posthumous castings, exist in a range of sizes.

==Origin==
&quot;The Thinker&quot; was initially named The Poet (), and was part of a large commission begun in 1880 for a doorway surround called &quot;The Gates of Hell&quot;. Rodin based this on the early 14th century poem &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante Alighieri, and most of the figures in the work represented the main characters in the poem with &quot;The Thinker&quot; at the center of the composition over the doorway and somewhat larger than most of the other figures. Some critics believe that it was originally intended to depict Dante at the gates of Hell, pondering his great poem.

Other critics reject that theory, pointing out that the figure is naked while Dante is fully clothed throughout his poem, and that the sculpture&#x27;s physique does not correspond to Dante&#x27;s effete figure. The sculpture is nude, as Rodin wanted a heroic figure in the tradition of Michelangelo, to represent intellect as well as poetry. Other critics came to see the sculpture as a self-portrait. This detail from the &quot;Gates of Hell&quot; was first named &quot;The Thinker&quot; by foundry workers, who noted its similarity to Michelangelo&#x27;s statue of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino, called &quot;Il Pensieroso&quot; (The Thinker).

The model for this sculpture, as for other works by Rodin, was the muscular French prizefighter and wrestler Jean Baud, who mostly appeared in the red-light district. Jean Baud was also featured on the 1911 Swiss 50 franc note by Hodler.

The original is in the Musée Rodin in Paris. The sculpture has a height of 72 cm, was made of bronze and had been finely patinated and polished. The work depicts a nude male figure of heroic size who is tense, muscular and internalized, contemplating the actions and fate of the people while sitting on a rock. He is seen leaning over, his right elbow placed on his left thigh, holding the weight of his chin on the back of his right hand. The pose is one of deep thought and contemplation, and the statue is often used as an image to represent philosophy. This and many other works by Rodin were groundbreaking for modernism and heralded a new age of three-dimensional artistic creation.

The work was enlarged in 1902 to a height of 181 cm. The monumental version became the artist&#x27;s first work in public space. The figure was designed to be seen from below and is normally displayed on a fairly high plinth, although the heights vary considerably chosen by the various owners.

==Casts==
&quot;The Thinker&quot; has been cast in multiple versions and is found around the world, but the history of the progression from models to castings is still not entirely clear. About 28 monumental-sized bronze casts are in museums and public places. In addition, there are sculptures of different study-sized scales and plaster versions (often painted bronze) in both monumental and study sizes. Some newer castings have been produced posthumously and are not considered part of the original production.

Rodin made the first small plaster version around 1881. The first bronze version was executed in 1884 and is held at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia. The first full-scale model was presented at the Salon des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1904. A public subscription financed a bronze casting, which became the property of the City of Paris, and was put in front of the Panthéon. In 1922, the original bronze was moved to the Musée Rodin.

==Art market ==
In June 2022 a cast was put up for sale at Christie&#x27;s in Paris with an estimate of up to €14m. The cast was made in about 1928 at the Rudier Foundry, founded by Alexis Rudier (1845-1897) who worked with Antoine Bourdelle and Aristide Maillol.

== Reception ==

Max Linde had a copy of the monumental version cast in 1904 and placed it in the garden of his villa, &quot;Lindesche Villa&quot;. There Edvard Munch painted his painting &quot;Rodin&#x27;s Thinker in the Garden of Dr. Linde&quot;, which is now in the Behnhaus. The cast later went to the Detroit Institute of Arts.
In his film &quot;The Great Dictator,&quot; Charlie Chaplin shows the &quot;Venus de Milo&quot; and Rodin&#x27;s &quot;Thinker&quot; with the modification that the left arms are stretched out in the Hynkel salute. With this allusion to the Nazi salute, Chaplin addresses the integration of art into Nazi propaganda. In the film &quot;Night at the Museum 2,&quot; the protagonists encounter a statue of the &quot;Thinker&quot; that has been brought to life. When asked a question, he stutters: &quot;I think...I think...I think.&quot; Later in the film, he flirts with a statue of Aphrodite. In &quot;Death at a Funeral&quot;, the statue is quoted as Alan Tudyk sitting naked on a rooftop in a &quot;thinking pose.&quot; In &quot;Midnight in Paris,&quot; the then French first lady Carla Bruni made a cameo appearance as a tour guide, explaining the sculpture of the &quot;Thinker&quot; to a group of American visitors in the garden of the Musée Rodin.

In singer Ariana Grande&#x27;s &quot;God Is a Woman&quot; music video, she sits in the &quot;Thinker&quot; pose while being attacked by small angry men. They throw into them words taken from the book they are on. However, these bounce off the singer when they reach her.

As part of the project launched in Mannheim for the painting of houses in the city with large-scale wall paintings (so-called murals) by national and international artists from the street art scene, Rodin&#x27;s &quot;Thinker&quot; was taken up and the mural &quot;The Modern Thinker&quot; implemented.

== Similar sculptures ==
Repetitive portrayals of individuals, both male and female, have been depicted in physical form while in the process of contemplation or grieving.

The &quot;Karditsa Thinker&quot; is a Neolithic clay figurine found in the area of Karditsa in Thessaly, Greece. This unique artifact, dated around 3900 BCE, during the Final Neolithic period (4500-3300 BCE), is a large solid clay figurine of a seated man. Despite some clumsiness in detail, it conveys the impression of a robust man looking upwards with a manly bearing. The figurine exhibits features of fully developed sculpture and is considered the largest Neolithic artifact found in Greece. The pronounced ithyphallic element, though mostly broken, along with its size, suggests a possible cultic character, possibly representing an agrarian deity associated with the fertility of the land.

The Thinker from Yehud is an archaeological figurine discovered during salvage excavations in the Israeli city of Yehud. The figurine, which sits atop a ceramic jug in a posture resembling &quot;The Thinker&quot;, dates back to the Middle Bronze Age II Palestine (c. 1800–1600 BCE). It was found in a tomb accompanied by various items, including daggers, spearheads, an axe head, a knife, two male sheep, and a donkey, all likely buried as offerings. After its discovery, the broken jug had to be stabilised and restored before being displayed in the Canaanite Galleries of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

The &quot;Thinker of Cernavodă&quot;, Romania, a terracotta sculpture, and its female counterpart, &quot;The Sitting Woman&quot;, are works of art from the Chalcolithic era. The Hamangia culture produced these remarkable sculptures, with The Thinker believed to be the earliest prehistoric sculpture that conveys human self-reflection instead of the more common artistic themes of hunting or fertility. The discovery of the Spong Man, which is the earliest known Anglo-Saxon sculpture of a person, was found in Europe&#x27;s other end, five millennia. The sculpture takes the form of a seated figure on a pottery lid of a cremation urn, resembling a humanoid figure.

A thousand years later, Michelangelo created the tomb of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino, which is located in the Basilica di San Lorenzo in Florence, Italy. The tomb is a sculptural masterpiece and was commissioned by Pope Clement VII to honor the memory of the Duke of Urbino, a member of the powerful Medici family of Florence. The tomb is considered one of Michelangelo&#x27;s finest works in sculpture and was created in the Mannerist style of the Late Renaissance period. The tomb features a large rectangular base, which is adorned with intricate reliefs and two sculptures, Dusk and Dawn, that represent the cycle of life. The central figure on the tomb is a sculpture of the Duke, who is portrayed as a thinker with his face in shadow and his elbow resting on a money box with a similarly muscular, contemplative figure with his hand on his chin, though the figure is seated rather than standing like Rodin&#x27;s &quot;The Thinker&quot;. The tomb also includes two reclining figures on the sarcophagus that are believed to represent Day and Night.

<text>Shaun Cameron Wright-Phillips (born 25 October 1981) is an English former professional footballer who played as a winger. He played in the Premier League and Football League for Manchester City, Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers, in Major League Soccer for the New York Red Bulls, in the United Soccer League for the New York Red Bulls II and Phoenix Rising FC, and at senior international level for the England national team.

A Nottingham Forest youth product, he spent 13 seasons playing in the Premier League during spells with Manchester City, Chelsea and Queens Park Rangers. In 2015, he joined Major League Soccer club New York Red Bulls alongside his brother, Bradley. Wright-Phillips joined Phoenix Rising FC in 2017.

The England international scored six goals in 36 appearances for the national team, which included selection for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Early life==
Shaun Cameron Wright-Phillips was born on 25 October 1981 in Greenwich, Greater London. He is the son of former England international Ian Wright, who adopted him at the age of three. His younger brother, Bradley Wright-Phillips, is also a professional footballer and the all-time top scorer for the New York Red Bulls. Wright-Phillips grew up in Brockley and attended Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hatcham College in New Cross Gate. Wright-Phillips is of Trinidadian and Grenadian descent.

==Club career==
===Manchester City===
Wright-Phillips was released by Nottingham Forest aged 17 and Manchester City took him to Maine Road. He made his first-team debut as a substitute in the second leg of a League Cup match against Burnley, replacing Terry Cooke. His league debut came two months later at Port Vale. Brought on as substitute striker, he helped his team turn a 1–0 deficit into a 2–1 win. His shot resulted in the first Manchester City goal, which Wright-Phillips attempted to claim, though the strike was later credited as an own goal instead. He then started the next two matches in place of Paul Dickov, who was absent through injury. Once Dickov recovered, Wright-Phillips returned to the reserves, making only one further first team appearance that season. City finished second in the First Division, resulting in promotion to the Premier League for the 2000–01 season.

Wright-Phillips featured more regularly than the previous season but was still not fully established in the first team, making 12 starts and seven substitute appearances playing in a variety of attacking positions. Manchester City&#x27;s stay in the Premier League was brief; at the end of the season they were relegated.

Under Keegan, Wright-Phillips firmly established himself in the first team, not as a forward, but as a wing-back. Keegan was known for playing attacking football, and decided to use the attacking Wright-Phillips in a traditionally defensive position due to his mobility and dribbling ability. From 2000 to 2003, Wright-Phillips won Manchester City&#x27;s Young Player of the Year award four times in succession, surpassing Steve Kinsey&#x27;s record of three times.

On 17 November 2004, he became one of the main targets of racist chants from sections of the Spanish crowd at an international friendly between England and Spain in Madrid. However, he brushed that aside with his performance in his next Manchester City appearance at Portsmouth, saying to reporters after the match, &quot;I just let the football do the talking&quot;. He also has a similar response regarding his father, saying in an interview with manchesteronline.co.uk: &quot;The press brought up my adopted father&#x27;s name. They relate to his name and that is fine by me – it comes with the name, but I will be my own man. I have made my own path and started to take my own steps.&quot;. His son is also going through City&#x27;s youth ranks at the moment.

===Chelsea===
On 18 July 2005, Wright-Phillips completed a £21 million move to Premier League champions Chelsea, returning to his native London. He joined the club on a five-year contract after agreeing to personal terms and passing a medical. He had previously said he would not leave Manchester City. His appearances were initially limited, starting only 15 times for Chelsea in 2005–06 and struggling to find scoring form. An inconsistent first season with Chelsea culminated in him missing out on the opportunity to travel to Germany with the England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

Despite making few first-team appearances, Wright-Phillips maintained that he was happy at Chelsea and wanted to stay and fight for a first-team place. He received a boost from his manager José Mourinho, when the latter declined to make an approach for Real Betis winger Joaquín, stating that he had enough options in terms of wingers. His first goal for the club came in a 2–0 Champions League win over Levski Sofia on 5 December 2006, in his 52nd match and almost 17 months after his transfer.

As 2006–07 progressed, Wright-Phillips picked up form and scored his first league goal against West Ham United on 18 April, following it up with his second in the same match. Subsequently, he started in several matches towards the end of the season including the 2007 FA Cup Final which Chelsea won.

At the beginning of 2007–08, Wright-Phillips maintained his starting place on the right wing. He also maintained his place after José Mourinho left Chelsea and under new coach Avram Grant. He was selected to play in the 2008 League Cup Final, which Chelsea lost to Tottenham Hotspur. He only made another six appearances that season and failed to make the match day squad for the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final. Having made 65 starting appearances for the club, with a further 60 as a substitute, Wright-Phillips had been unable to secure a regular place in the team under Grant and Mourinho. After falling out of favour with new manager Luiz Felipe Scolari, he was allowed to leave the club.

===Return to Manchester City===
On 28 August 2008, he re-joined former club Manchester City on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee, believed to be in the region of £8.5 million. On his second debut, Wright-Phillips scored two goals against Sunderland in the 3–0 away win in the Premier League. His third goal for City came in a 6–0 victory over Portsmouth on 21 September 2008. Wright-Phillips equalled his entire goalscoring record at Chelsea just over a month after returning to City. His right footed drive in the second half against Omonia Nicosia on 2 October helped steer City through to the group stages of the UEFA Cup for the first time. On 29 October, Wright-Phillips swore at former Middlesbrough manager Gareth Southgate during Manchester City&#x27;s 2–0 defeat to his club, after Southgate complained about Wright-Phillips appearing to go down too easily after a challenge. The Football Association warned Wright-Phillips about his future conduct.

The 2009–10 season started very well for Wright-Phillips, setting up Emmanuel Adebayor&#x27;s first goal for Man City in the third minute of a 2–0 win against Blackburn Rovers. He followed that up with a goal in a League Cup tie with Crystal Palace. Three weeks later against Arsenal, he set up a goal for Adebayor before scoring one for himself. He went on to score in successive home matches against Burnley and Hull City where he delivered an assist for Carlos Tevez&#x27;s debut Man City goal. During his next game against Arsenal he scored in a 3–0 League Cup win which saw City progress to the tournament&#x27;s semi finals. He found himself in-and-out of the team under manager Roberto Mancini, with new signing Adam Johnson&#x27;s form forcing Wright-Phillips to be a substitute in most matches, including City&#x27;s match at his former club Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. He came off the bench to replace Johnson in the 60th minute and then set up Craig Bellamy&#x27;s second goal in the 4–2 win. Despite his impact in the match, Wright-Phillips had not secured a place in the team. He started for City on the final match of the 2009–10 Premier League against West Ham at Upton Park, where he scored the equaliser in a 1–1 draw.

The 2010–11 season saw Wright-Phillips only make seven league appearances, with the increased competition for places following the signings of David Silva and Yaya Touré resulting in him rarely being included in the club&#x27;s matchday squad. City won the 2010–11 FA Cup, and despite being left out of the squad for the final, he did contribute some appearances earlier in the cup run, including coming on as a substitute against Manchester United in the semi-final.

===Queens Park Rangers===
On 31 August 2011, the final day of the transfer window, Wright-Phillips signed for Queens Park Rangers (QPR) on a three-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his full debut for QPR against Newcastle United on 12 September 2011, making the starting line-up and winning man of the match by supporters. He failed to score a goal for almost a year before scoring his first the following season for QPR against Walsall in the League Cup on 28 August 2012. His only goal for QPR in the Premier League came during the derby against former club Chelsea on 2 January 2013, which ended 1–0. Despite this, QPR would find themselves relegated to the Championship at the end of the season. QPR would return to the Premiership at the first time of asking, defeating Derby County in the play-off finals, though Wright-Phillips would increasingly find his role throughout the season diminished to the occasional cameo from the subs bench and reserve outings. After featuring even more sporadically during 2014–15, QPR announced that Wright-Phillips would be released from his contract in a batch of players that included fellow former England internationals Rio Ferdinand and Joey Barton.

===New York Red Bulls===
In June 2015, Wright-Phillips began training with Major League Soccer club the New York Red Bulls to regain fitness following his departure from QPR. Impressing head coach Jesse Marsch, he suggested he would sign for the club when his contract officially expired on 30 June.

On 27 July, he completed a move to join his brother, Bradley Wright-Phillips, at the New York Red Bulls. He made his debut on 1 August, coming off the bench to win a penalty and assist his brother in a 3–1 victory at the Philadelphia Union. Wright-Phillips was named in the MLS Team of the Week following the performance.

Wright-Phillips was released by the Red Bulls at the end of the 2015 Major League Soccer season, but was later re-signed on 25 January 2016.

===Phoenix Rising FC===
On 23 February 2017, Wright-Phillips signed for United Soccer League club Phoenix Rising FC. He made his debut on 26 March 2017, in a 1–0 defeat to Toronto FC II.

Wright-Phillips announced his retirement from playing on 24 August 2019 at the age of 37.

==International career==
Wright-Phillips made his England debut as a substitute for Nicky Butt against Ukraine on 18 August 2004. He scored the last of England&#x27;s goals in a 3–0 win, described by BBC Sport as &quot;crowning a solo run with a stunning finish.&quot; He was a regular member of England&#x27;s squad during qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and made his first competitive start in a 1–0 away win over Wales. After a decline in form, however, especially a poor performance away to Northern Ireland, and a lack of matches following his move to Chelsea, he missed out on a place in the squad for the World Cup finals.

After a good start to the 2007–08 season, Wright-Phillips received an England recall to play against Germany in a friendly match at the new Wembley Stadium. Wright-Phillips was brought on as a substitute in the second half during the match in which England lost 2–1 to Germany and he was named the England sponsor&#x27;s man of the match after an impressive performance.

On 8 September 2007, Wright-Phillips was selected to start against Israel in a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier he scored the first goal in the 3–0 victory and won the England sponsor&#x27;s man of the match award with his performance. He was then selected to start for England against Estonia and scored his third goal for England and the opener in a third consecutive 3–0 win at Wembley. He was selected in England&#x27;s critical Euro 2008 qualifying match against Croatia, substituted at half time in favour of David Beckham with England trailing 2–0, with England eventually losing 3–2 and therefore missing out on Euro 2008.

On 14 October 2009, with England having already qualified for the 2010 World Cup, Wright-Phillips was selected in the starting XI against Belarus at Wembley Stadium.&quot; Unusually, he was joined in the team (which was missing Wayne Rooney through injury) by Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s Aaron Lennon, meaning England played with two recognised wingers. Mid-way through the second half, Wright-Phillips drove in a shot from the edge of the penalty area which beat the dive of the Belarus goalkeeper. He appeared as a second-half substitute against Egypt on 3 March 2010, scoring England&#x27;s second goal and assisting Peter Crouch for the third as they came from behind to win 3–1.

On 1 June 2010, Wright-Phillips was selected for England&#x27;s final 23-man squad that was to play in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He appeared as a substitute in England&#x27;s opening two group matches against United States and Algeria.

==Personal life==
Wright-Phillips has a son, D&#x27;Margio Wright-Phillips, who plays for Belgian club Beerschot. He is also capped for England U16s.

<text>CICI-TV (analogue channel 5) is a television station in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. The station is owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, and has studios on Frood Road (near Lasalle Boulevard) in Sudbury; its transmitter is located near Huron Street.

CICI-TV is the flagship station of the network&#x27;s CTV Northern Ontario sub-system. CICI produces all of the CTV Northern Ontario stations&#x27; local programming, except for some local news inserts in the system&#x27;s newscasts.

==History==
The station was launched on October 25, 1953, by Sudbury businessmen George Miller, Jim Cooper and Bill Plaunt. It was the first privately owned television station to launch in Canada, and only the fourth television station overall after CBC Television&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations CBLT in Toronto, CBMT in Montreal and CBOT in Ottawa. Its original call sign was CKSO-TV. The station was a CBC affiliate, receiving programs by kinescope until a microwave relay system linked the station to Toronto in 1956. The station originally broadcast only from 7 to 11 p.m., but by the end of its first year in operation it was on the air from 3:30 p.m. to midnight.

The station was owned by the &quot;Sudbury Star&quot; along with CKSO radio (AM 790, now CJRQ at FM 92.7). The newspaper was sold to Thomson Newspapers in 1955, but the paper&#x27;s former local owners retained the radio and television stations under the corporate name CKSO Ltd. The company name was changed to Cambrian Broadcasting by 1965.

===Reaffiliation with CTV===
In 1970, four separate companies simultaneously applied for new stations in Sudbury: J. Conrad Lavigne, who owned the existing CBC affiliate CFCL-TV in Timmins, and Hyland Broadcasting, which owned the existing CBC affiliate CJIC-TV in Sault Ste. Marie, each applied for a rebroadcast transmitter in Sudbury to transmit their existing programming, predicated on the assumption that CKSO would then switch its affiliation to CTV; the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation itself applied for its own owned-and-operated station in the city, also predicated on the same assumption; and a fourth company, North Star Broadcasting, applied to launch a new CTV affiliate.

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rejected all four of the original applications on the grounds that as Sudbury was the only city in the region large enough to support two competing television stations, all of the original applications would have effectively shut down any path for CTV service to ever be extended to Timmins or North Bay; even the mere addition of rebroadcasters of Sudbury&#x27;s new CTV station would itself destroy the viability of the existing CBC stations in the smaller cities unless they were &quot;also&quot; paired up to a sister station in Sudbury. It accordingly directed Cambrian and Lavigne, as the incumbent broadcasters, to collaborate on a new plan that would treat Sudbury, North Bay and Timmins as a single market, and extend CTV service to all three cities. Although North Bay&#x27;s CFCH-TV was owned by another company at this time, its owners were trying to sell the station and thus were not considered to be relevant to the plan. Accordingly, the two companies then resubmitted a revised application under which Lavigne would launch stations in Sudbury and North Bay and become the CBC affiliate in all three cities, while Cambrian would purchase CFCH, launch a rebroadcaster of CKSO in Timmins, and switch its affiliation to CTV in all three cities. 
CKSO thus disaffiliated from the CBC to join CTV in 1971. Lavigne&#x27;s new CBC affiliate, CKNC, went to air in Sudbury the day of CKSO&#x27;s affiliation switch.

CKSO was Sudbury&#x27;s only television station until 1971, when CKNC signed on. A building at 699 Frood Road was built and later became the permanent home for CKSO and CKNC (now defunct) where the station remains to this day.

===Merger===
The financial pressures of competing in small markets, however, left both companies losing money and very nearly bankrupt by 1980. As a result, the CRTC approved a full merger into the MCTV twinstick. As part of the deal, Cambrian Broadcasting spun CKSO radio off to new owners, and since the stations no longer had common ownership the television station adopted the new call sign CICI. At this time, the Timmins repeater was converted into a new standalone station, CITO-TV.

In 1981, an Ontario provincial court case against the station, for allegedly failing to satisfy its Canadian content requirements in the 1979–80 season, briefly had the effect of nullifying the entire policy; the judge ruled that because the federal Broadcast Act defined a station as the holder of a licence issued under the Radio Act of 1967, but the Canadian content regulations were set down in a &quot;later&quot; revision of the Broadcast Act, a station was not bound by the regulation as it wasn&#x27;t present in the 1967 edition. The ruling was subsequently overturned on appeal.

In 1990, the stations were acquired by Baton Broadcasting. Baton bought full control of CTV in 1997, making CICI a fully owned-and-operated station of the network. CKNC was sold to the CBC in 2002, ceasing operations and becoming a full-time rebroadcaster of CBLT in Toronto.

==Famous people==
Former CKSO employee Judy Jacobson was the first woman in Canadian broadcasting history to work on air as a television weather reporter. She later became a federal Member of Parliament for Sudbury&#x27;s Nickel Belt riding.

Other past employees of the station include journalists Francis D&#x27;Souza, Sarika Sehgal and Susan Hay, all later associated with major market stations in Toronto, as well as sportscasters and former hockey players Cummy Burton and Frank Salive.

Brendan Connor rejoined the station in 2011 as news anchor, after spending many years as a sportscaster and anchor for national and international networks including TSN, CBC Newsworld and Al Jazeera English. He is the son of Michael Connor, a longtime news anchor from the station&#x27;s days as CKSO. Michael Connor died in December 2008, at age 82.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Inco sponsored a local variety show, &quot;Inco Presents&quot;, on the station. The program included comedic sketches performed by the duo of Gil Mayer and Norm McGilvary, in which Mayer, a sales manager with the station, performed the character of miner &quot;Marcel Mucker&quot;. Marc Mayer, now the director of the National Gallery of Canada, is the son of Gil Mayer.

Alan Nesbitt, a journalist who worked for the station in the 1960s before moving on to major market stations in the United States, wrote about his time with the station in a chapter of his 2020 memoir &quot;Stepping Out Into Traffic&quot;.

==Transmitters==
CICI also broadcast on CICI-TV-1 channel 3 in Elliot Lake and CKNY-TV-11 channel 11 in Huntsville. The rebroadcaster in Huntsville was originally a CKCO-TV repeater (CKCO-TV-4), but switched to CKNY-TV as its source, and then to CICI-TV, retaining the CKNY-TV-11 call sign. This repeater initially aired a very small amount of local programming distinct from its parent station, but ultimately this was phased out, though it still airs a small amount of local commercials specifically for the Huntsville area.

Both transmitters were among a long list of CTV rebroadcasters nationwide to have shut down on or before August 31, 2009, as part of a political dispute with Canadian authorities on paid fee-for-carriage requirements for cable television operators. A subsequent change in ownership assigned full control of CTVglobemedia to Bell Canada; as of 2011, these transmitters remain in normal licensed broadcast operation.

On February 11, 2016, Bell Media applied for its regular licence renewals, which included applications to delete a long list of transmitters, including CICI-TV-1. Bell Media&#x27;s rationale for deleting these analogue repeaters is below:
We are electing to delete these analog transmitters from the main licence with which they are associated. These analog transmitters generate no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015–24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown.
On July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down CKNY-TV-11 Huntsville as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019-268. This transmitter was shut down by October 9, 2020.

==Special programming==
Each December, the station airs a locally produced program called the &quot;CTV Lions Children&#x27;s Christmas Telethon&quot;.

<text>CITO-TV (analogue channel 3) is a television station in Timmins, Ontario, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, the station has studios on Pine Street North (near Hendry Avenue) in Timmins, and its transmitter is located near Highway 101 (just west of Connaught Road). It also operates rebroadcasters in Kapuskasing (channel 10), Kirkland Lake (channel 11, also serving Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec), Hearst (channel 4) and Chapleau (channel 9).

CITO-TV is part of the CTV Northern Ontario sub-system. It essentially operates as a &quot;de facto&quot; semi-satellite of CICI-TV in Sudbury, running the same programming as that station at all times (except for certain commercials and regional news inserts during its newscasts).

==History==

CITO was established April 1, 1971, as CKSO-TV-2, originally rebroadcasting CKSO in Sudbury. Unlike CKSO and CKNY in North Bay, which were established in the 1950s as CBC affiliates and then reaffiliated with CTV in 1971 when J. Conrad Lavigne established new CBC stations in those markets; in Timmins, Lavigne&#x27;s existing station CFCL retained its CBC affiliation and CTV service was provided by a rebroadcast transmitter of CKSO.

Until 1980, CKSO-2 and CFCL aggressively competed with each other for advertising dollars, leaving both in a precarious financial position due to the Timmins market&#x27;s relatively small size. In 1980, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) approved the merger of Cambrian Broadcasting and Lavigne&#x27;s Mid-Canada Communications into the MCTV twinstick. The station&#x27;s callsign changed to CITO-TV at that time and it began operating as a standalone station.

In 1990, the stations were acquired by Baton Broadcasting. Baton subsequently became the sole corporate owner of CTV, and sold CFCL to the CBC in 2002.

==Transmitters==
These and many other CTV rebroadcasters nationwide were to shut down on or before August 31, 2009, as part of a political dispute with Canadian authorities on paid fee-for-carriage requirements for cable television operators. A subsequent change in ownership assigned full control of CTVglobemedia to Bell Media; as of 2011, these transmitters remain in normal licensed broadcast operation.

On February 11, 2016, Bell Media applied for its regular license renewals, which included applications to delete a long list of transmitters, including CITO-TV-3 and CITO-TV-4. Bell Media&#x27;s rationale for deleting these analogue repeaters is below:
&quot;We are electing to delete these analogue transmitters from the main licence with which they are associated. These analogue transmitters generate no incremental revenue, attract little to no viewership given the growth of BDU or DTH subscriptions and are costly to maintain, repair or replace. In addition, none of the highlighted transmitters offer any programming that differs from the main channels. The Commission has determined that broadcasters may elect to shut down transmitters but will lose certain regulatory privileges (distribution on the basic service, the ability to request simultaneous substitution) as noted in Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015–24, Over-the-air transmission of television signals and local programming. We are fully aware of the loss of these regulatory privileges as a result of any transmitter shutdown.&quot;
At the same time, Bell Media applied to convert the licenses of CTV2 Atlantic (formerly ASN) and CTV2 Alberta (formerly ACCESS) from satellite-to-cable undertakings into television stations without transmitters (similar to cable-only network affiliates in the United States), and to reduce the level of educational content on CTV2 Alberta.

On July 30, 2019, Bell Media was granted permission to close down an additional transmitter as part of Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2019-268. The transmitter for CITO-TV-2 will be shut down by December 3, 2021.

<text>CHBX-TV (analogue channel 2) is a television station in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. It is owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, and maintains studios and transmitter facilities on 6 Line East (just east of Peoples Road) in Sault Ste. Marie.

CHBX-TV is part of the CTV Northern Ontario sub-system. It essentially operates as a &quot;de facto&quot; semi-satellite of CICI-TV in Sudbury, running the same programming as that station at all times (except for certain commercials and regional news inserts during its newscasts).

The station&#x27;s signal also reaches the eastern portion of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and can be seen over-the-air as far south as Gaylord, Michigan. It is carried on Charter Spectrum in St. Ignace on Channel 2; however, it is not seen on Spectrum in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.

==History==
The station began broadcasting on November 5, 1977, as CKCY-TV. It was owned by Huron Broadcasting along with CBC affiliate CJIC-TV, and was a sister station of an AM radio outlet with the same call letters. Prior to the sign-on of CKCY, CTV programming was available in Sault Ste. Marie on cable from Sudbury&#x27;s CKSO-TV (now CICI).

It adopted the current CHBX call sign in 1985, when the radio station was sold to Mid-Canada Radio. In 1990, Huron sold CHBX and its CBC-affiliated twinstick CJIC-TV to Baton Broadcasting, which merged them into the MCTV system. Ironically, MCTV flagship CICI had been available on cable in Sault Ste. Marie for part of the 1980s; the two stations aired radically different programming at the time.

Baton became the sole corporate owner of CTV in 1997, and sold CJIC to the CBC in 2002.

==Transmitters==
CHBX also broadcasts on CHBX-TV-1 channel 7 in Wawa; this repeater was among a long list of CTV rebroadcasters nationwide to have shut down on or before August 31, 2009, as part of a political dispute with Canadian authorities on paid fee-for-carriage requirements for cable television operators. A subsequent change in ownership assigned full control of CTVglobemedia to Bell Canada Enterprises; as of 2011, these transmitters remain in normal licensed broadcast operation.

<text>CKNY-DT (channel 10) is a television station in North Bay, Ontario, Canada, part of the CTV Television Network. Owned and operated by network parent Bell Media, the station maintains a transmitter adjacent to Ski Hill Road (southwest of Highway 534) in Nipissing.

CKNY-DT is part of the CTV Northern Ontario sub-system, and is the only station in the sub-system to broadcast a digital signal. It essentially operates as a &quot;de facto&quot; semi-satellite of CICI-TV in Sudbury, running the same programming as that station at all times (except for certain commercials and regional news inserts during its newscasts). CKNY-TV&#x27;s studios were located on Oak and Wyld Streets (near the shoreline of Lake Nipissing) in downtown North Bay, and were closed in 2020.

==History==
CKNY was originally launched by local businessmen Gerry Alger and Gerry Stanton in 1955, as a CBC affiliate with the callsign CKGN. The station was subsequently acquired by The Thomson Corporation in 1960, and recalled as CFCH.

In 1970, Thomson reached a deal to sell the station to Bushnell Communications of Ottawa, although the transaction was never completed. Around the same time, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rejected all of the applicants in the first round of license hearings to extend CTV service to Sudbury, the largest market in the region; because the North Bay and Timmins markets were deemed too small to support competing television stations, the commission directed Cambrian Broadcasting of Sudbury and J. Conrad Lavigne of Timmins to collaborate on an alternative plan in which all three cities would receive CTV service without losing CBC. Effectively, the decision declared all three cities to be a single television market, and prevented new television companies from entering and potentially upsetting the balance.

In the first revised plan, Cambrian&#x27;s CKSO-TV, which was now slated to become the CTV affiliate, would simply have added a rebroadcaster in North Bay on channel 4, while leaving the ownership status and affiliation of CFCH unchanged. The CRTC rejected this proposal, however, as it did not adequately resolve the commission&#x27;s concerns about CFCH&#x27;s financial viability in the face of competition. Accordingly, in 1971 the station was directly acquired by Cambrian Broadcasting and became an affiliate of CTV and a semi-satellite of CKSO, while Lavigne&#x27;s new CBC affiliate, CHNB, went on the air at the same time.

For a number of years in the 1960s and &#x27;70s, CFCH/CKNY operated rebroadcast transmitter CJTK-TV in Témiscaming, Quebec on channel 3. It is not known when it was shut down.

Throughout the 1970s, CKNY and CHNB aggressively competed with each other for advertising revenue; by 1980, however, the stations ran into exactly the problem the CRTC had been trying to prevent by linking them to Sudbury in the 1970 hearings: they were losing money and very nearly bankrupt. In 1980, the CRTC approved the merger of the two stations, along with their co-owned stations in Sudbury and Timmins, into the MCTV twinstick.

In 1990, the stations were acquired by Baton Broadcasting. Baton subsequently became the sole corporate owner of CTV, and sold CHNB to the CBC in 2002.

In 1999, CKNY began rebroadcasting on channel 11 in Huntsville, Ontario (CKNY-TV-11), licensed to Dwight and serving the Muskoka and Parry Sound area on a transmitter which previously rebroadcast the programming of CKCO (as CKCO-TV-4). Initially a semi-satellite with a very small amount of local programming, the Huntsville station subsequently lost local programming, and then changed its programming and advertising feed source to CICI.

Since the acquisition of CTV by Bell Canada, CKNY has gradually downsized its local operations, with all newscasts across the CTV Northern Ontario system (formerly MCTV) centralized out of Sudbury; as of 2020, the station only had three local employees (two reporters and a cameraman). In May 2020, CKNY closed its local studio on Oak Street, with the remaining employees now working remotely.

Just after midnight on October 30, 2020, CKNY-TV turned off its analogue signal and signed on its digital signal on channel 12.

<text>Metohija (, ), also known in Albanian as Dukagjini, (, ) is a large basin and the name of the region covering the southwestern part of Kosovo. The region covers 35% (3,891 km2) of Kosovo&#x27;s total area. According to the 2024 census, the population of the region is 570,147.

== Names ==
The name Metohija derives from the Greek word (&quot;metóchia&quot;; singular , &quot;metóchion&quot;), meaning &quot;monastic estates&quot; – a reference to the large number of villages and estates in the region that were owned by the Serbian Orthodox monasteries and Mount Athos during the Middle Ages.
In Albanian the area is called &quot;Rrafshi i Dukagjinit&quot; and means &quot;the plateau of Dukagjin&quot;, as the toponym (in Albanian) took the name of the Dukagjini family who ruled a large part of Dukagjini during the 14th-15th centuries. According to Jahja Drançolli, a professor at the University of Pristina, the oldest name for the region is Dukagjin Plain () or simply Dukagjin and the region was under the Sanjak of Dukagjin in the 15th–16th century with its capital in Peja. Drançolli also state that the name &#x27;Metohija&#x27; does not appear as a geographic notion in the Medieval and Ottoman period which would have the meaning of the territory of Peja, Gjakova and Prizren. The denomination Metohija only appears as an ecclesiastic property. The name Metohija came first to be used as a geographic notion by Serbian scholars in the 19th-20th century. A similar name is found in Northern Albania, the Dukagjin highlands.

The term &quot;Kosovo and Metohija&quot; () was in official use for the Autonomous Region of Kosovo and Metohija (1945–1963), and also for the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija (1963–1968). The term &quot;Metohija&quot; was dropped from the official name of the province in 1968, and thus the term &quot;Kosovo&quot; became the official name of the province as a whole. The change was not welcomed by Serbs, who continued to use the old name (for example in the 1986 Draft Memorandum of SANU). In September 1990, the new Constitution of the Republic of Serbia was adopted, changing the official name of the province back to the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija. This time, the change was not welcomed by ethnic Albanians, who protested against the official use of the term &quot;Metohija&quot;. In 2008, after the Kosovo declaration of independence, Serbia included the term &quot;Metohija&quot; into the official name of the newly formed Ministry for Kosovo and Metohija, which was transformed in 2012 into the Office for Kosovo and Metohija.

== Geography ==

Metohija is wide at its broadest point and about long, at an average altitude of above sea level. Its principal river is the White Drin. It is bordered by the mountain ranges Mokra Gora in the north and northwest, the Accursed Mountains in the west, Pashtrik in the southwest, the Šar Mountains ) in the south and southeast, and Drenica in the east and northeast, which distinguishes it from the rest of Kosovo in the east and northeast.

The geographic division between Metohija and the rest of Kosovo causes differences between the two areas&#x27; flora and fauna. Metohija has the characteristic influences of the Mediterranean.

Metohija consists of fertile arable land with many small rivers which provide water for irrigation and, in combination with the Mediterranean climate, give excellent fields except for cereals. This area is well known for its high-quality vineyards, fruit orchards, and for the growing of chestnut and almond trees. 

The geographical region of Metohija is further divided into four parts: Prizrenski Podgor, Llapusha, Reka and Rugova.

== Districts ==
It encompasses three of the seven districts of Kosovo:

==History==
===Prehistory===
Based on archaeology, the region of Kosovo and Metohija and the Morava Valley were interconnected in the Neolithic (Starčevo and Vinča) and Eneolithic. The Triballi of Morava entered Kosovo in two waves in the 8th and 7th centuries BC, then took part in the genesis of the Dardani. Necropolises near Zhur suggest that the southwestern-most part of Metohija at the end of 6th century BC was subject to Illyrian influx. After the Roman conquests, the Metohija region was divided into Dardania and Praevalitana.

===Middle Ages===
Coinciding with the decline of the Roman Empire, many &quot;barbarian&quot; tribes passed through the Balkans, most of whom did not leave any lasting state. The Slavs, however, overwhelmed the Balkans in the 6th and 7th centuries. The region was conquered by Bulgaria in the early 10th century, after which Byzantine rule was restored, briefly ca. 970–975, and again after 1018. In terms of ecclesiastical administration, the region of Metohija belonged to the Eparchy of Prizren, created in 1019. During the 11th and the 12th century, the region was contested between the Grand Principality of Serbia and the Byzantine Empire. Serbian Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja was recognized as independent in 1190, keeping northern parts of the Metohija (region of Hvosno), while southern parts were incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia by the beginning of the 13th century. After the Fall of the Serbian Empire in 1371, the region of Metohija was controlled by the Balšić family of Zeta, and since 1378 by the Branković family. The region was also controlled by the Principality of Dukagjini. It was part of the Serbian Despotate until 1455, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire.

Ottoman cadastral records, particularly the Ottoman defters of the 15th-16th centuries, indicate that the Dukagjin Plains were inhabited by a majority of Albanian Christians during this period. This Albanian Christian majority of the region mainly concerned itself with agriculture and consisted of both Catholic and Orthodox Albanians. Albanian anthroponomy and onomastics prevailed over Slavic ones, and there are many cases of mixed Slav-Albanian anthroponomy; that is to say, Albanians with elements of Slavic anthroponomy as a result of their conversion to the Orthodox faith. The Slavic population of the region during these times consisted of a small minority, and was mainly located in the Nahiya of Peja and with a very small pocket in the Nahiya of Prizren.

===Early modern===
Metohija was conquered by the Ottoman Empire in 1455 and incorporated into the Sanjak of Prizren (southern part of Metohija) and Sanjak of Peć (northern part of Metohija). In 1878, after several administrative reforms, the region was included into Ottoman Vilayet of Kosovo.

===Modern===
The area was taken by the Kingdom of Montenegro in the 1912 First Balkan War except for the Prizren area, conquered by Kingdom of Serbia. During the First World War, Montenegro was conquered by the Austro-Hungarian forces in 1915. The Central Powers were pushed out of Metohija by the Serbian Army in 1918. Montenegro subsequently joined the Kingdom of Serbia, which was followed by the formation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The Kingdom was reformed into the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929. The Kingdom suffered an Axis invasion during World War II in 1941, and the region of Metohija was incorporated into Italian-controlled Albania, with the Italians employing the &quot;Vulnetari&quot;, an Albanian volunteer militia, to control the villages. After Italy&#x27;s treaty with the Allies in 1943, the Germans took direct control over the region, supported by the local Albanian collaborationists (Balli Kombëtar). After numerous rebellions of Serb Chetniks and Yugoslav Partisans, Metohija was captured by Serb forces in 1944. In 1946, it became part of Serbia&#x27;s Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija, within the transitional Democratic Federal Yugoslavia.

On 17 February 2008, representatives of Kosovo Albanians, declared Kosovo&#x27;s independence and subsequently adopted the Constitution of Republic of Kosovo, which came into effect on 15 June 2008. Serbia still considers Metohija part of its territory.

<text>Thomas Mark Bishop (born 29 June 1954) is a former Australian politician who served as an Australian Labor Party member of the Australian Senate representing the state of Western Australia from July 1996 until June 2014. He was born in Adelaide, South Australia and was educated at the University of Adelaide and Harvard University. He was an industrial officer and union secretary before entering politics.

Bishop has been Shadow Minister for Veterans&#x27; Affairs 2001–04, Shadow Minister for Customs 2003–04 and Shadow Minister for Defence Industry, Procurement and Personnel 2005–2006.

In December 2006, Bishop announced that he would not recontest his Senate seat, due to expire on 30 June 2008. However, before the 2007 he decided to recontest and was re-elected for a further six-year term.

In the Rudd Labor Government, Senator Bishop was chair of the Senate Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, as well as being a member of a number of other Joint House and Senate committees.

Bishop withdrew from Senate preselection for the 2014 election after a factional deal which would have seen him relegated to an unwinnable position on the ticket. He subsequently retired from politics.

<text>Petersfield Town Football Club are an English football club based in Petersfield, Hampshire, England. The club is affiliated to the Hampshire Football Association, and is an England Football Accredited Club. They are currently members of the Southern Combination Football League Premier Division, playing home fixtures at The Southdowns Builders Stadium.

==History==

The club was founded by Peter De-Sisto in 1993 after the demise of Petersfield United (founded 1889). The previous club folded after being denied permission to switch from the Isthmian League to the Wessex League and had serious debts. The newly formed club took their place in Division One (now Premier Division) of the Wessex League, under the management of former England player Gary Stevens.

For the first four seasons the club stayed in the Wessex League before being relegated to Division One of the Hampshire League. The club only lasted one season in Division One and were relegated again to Division Two, where they stayed for a further season finishing as runners-up, however when the league was re-organised they were effectively promoted twice, as they now found themselves in the newly formed Premier Division.

The club stayed in the Premier Division of the Hampshire League until the start of the 2004/05 season, when the Wessex League expanded and the club joined the newly formed Division Two. 
The club remained in this Division - which was now called Division One, until the 2013/14 season when Petersfield Town became Wessex League Division One Champions.

Under the stewardship of Ian Saunders, the club won the Wessex League Premier Division in 2014/15, becoming the first club to win back to back championships in the Wessex League and thus earned promotion to the Southern Football League.

Numerous &#x27;Team of the Month&#x27; awards were claimed during the campaign, with midfielder Ed Dryden catching the eye, earning a move to Stoke City.

Season 2015/16 was another year of firsts for Petersfield – it was the first time they had played in the Southern League and they went on to finish in 13th place in Division One Central.

They played in the FA Trophy for the first time too and had their best ever run in the FA Cup to date – reaching the third qualifying round before losing to National League South side St Albans City.

Saunders left the Rams a little over a week before the start of the 2016/17 campaign and Andy Neal and Gary Lines had short spells in charge of first team matters before John Robson was appointed manager in October 2016.

However, he could not reverse what had become a disastrous season and the Rams finished bottom of Division One Central, gaining only nine points all season.

It wasn&#x27;t all doom and gloom though – the first team reached the final of the Portsmouth Senior Cup at Fratton Park, home of Portsmouth FC, and the reserve team won the Wyvern League&#x27;s Division One East title and the Wyvern League Challenge Cup.

In the summer of 2017, Jim Macey was appointed first team manager and the Rams were placed back in the Wessex Premier Division following their relegation from Step 4 football.
After a poor start to the campaign Macey resigned and Mark Summerhill took the helm. He worked tirelessly but could not turn around the season, and the club finished bottom of the Premier Division for a second successive relegation.

Back in Wessex Division One, the goal in 2018/19 was to stabilise the club both on and off the field, and this was achieved as Summerhill took the team to a 15th-place finish on 40 points, plus a quarter-final appearance in the Russell-Cotes Cup.

Further progress was made in 2019/20 with the team on course for a top half of the table finish when the season was terminated due to COVID-19.

There was also cup success, the highlights being the club&#x27;s best ever run in the FA Vase reaching the second round proper, and the third round of the Hampshire Senior Cup.

The pandemic once again brought season 2020/21 to a premature end, however the club was once again enjoying a solid campaign.

After the two curtailed seasons the club concluded 2021/22 in twelfth place.

A partnership with Gosport Borough saw Pat Suraci and Joe Lea join as Joint Managers, with Mark Summerhill becoming Head of Football.

They brought instant success to the club with promotion back to the Wessex Premier Division via the Division One play-offs defeating New Milton Town, while also reaching the Wessex League Cup final.

Their tenure was unfortunately short-lived with the trio departing for Privett Park in the summer of 2023, however it gave opportunity for captain, Connor Hoare to step into the Manager&#x27;s role for 2023/24, assisted by Callum Glen.

Their appointment coincided with an exciting new era at Love Lane, following a summer merger with the highly successful Petersfield Town Juniors.

Together, they formed one unified club to secure a bright and sustainable future for football in Petersfield, enabling player pathway at all age groups; the emergence of a Ladies side, and an increased volunteer workforce to take the club forward off the pitch.

==Ground==

The club play their home games at The Southdowns Builders Stadium, Love Lane, Petersfield, Hampshire, GU31 4BW.

The stadium has hosted Petersfield Town and previously Petersfield United since 1948. Prior to this the club played at Princes Road on land subsequently owned by Hampshire Cattle Breeders.

A latter-day attendance record of 1,615 was set on December 28, 1992, for an Isthmian League Division Three fixture with Aldershot Town. The visitors recording a 3–0 victory in what was to be The Rams last season under their former guise as Petersfield United. The stadium is situated opposite Churcher&#x27;s College.

<text>Maik Stefan Taylor (born 4 September 1971) is a former Northern Ireland international football goalkeeper and, since July 2022, goalkeeping coach at Birmingham City.

At club level, Taylor played non-League football for Petersfield Town, Basingstoke Town and Farnborough Town before moving into the Football League with Barnet. He went on to play for Southampton, Fulham, Birmingham City, where he spent eight years before his release at the end of the 2010–11 season, Leeds United and Millwall. In international football, he played for Northern Ireland, qualifying for that country through his British passport which at that time, as he was born abroad, entitled him to play for any of the Home Nations.

Taylor took up goalkeeper coaching, initially with the Northern Ireland setup. He was briefly goalkeeping coach at Bradford City in 2019, and then spent three years in that role with Walsall before moving on to Birmingham City in July 2022.

==Early life==
Taylor was born in Hildesheim, West Germany, to a German mother and an English father who was serving as a staff sergeant in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) regiment of the British Army. Taylor began his football career at ASC Nienburg of Nienburg, Lower Saxony, in Germany before moving to England as a schoolboy. He later followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps by joining the REME based at Arborfield in Berkshire, where he attended Princess Marina College.

He later moved to Bordon in Hampshire where he played football for his regiment and for the Army and Combined Services representative sides. During this period he also played for Petersfield Town, Basingstoke Town and Farnborough Town, with whom he won the Southern League Premier Division title in 1993–94.

==Club career==
In June 1995, Taylor joined Barnet of the Football League Third Division for a fee of £700. Eighteen months later he was signed by Southampton of the Premier League for a fee of £500,000.

===Southampton===
Taylor had become a &quot;Saints&quot; fan as a schoolboy so when Graeme Souness brought him to The Dell in January 1997, no-one was more delighted than Taylor himself. Taylor immediately went into the first-team, replacing Dave Beasant, and made his debut on 11 January in a 1–0 victory at Middlesbrough. During his first season at Southampton, the team struggled near the foot of the table, missing relegation by one point, having been in last place with five matches to play.

Souness left the club in the summer of 1997, being replaced by Dave Jones who brought in several new players, including goalkeeper Paul Jones from his previous club, Stockport County. Taylor spent the rest of his time at Southampton on the bench and was sold to Fulham in November 1997.

===Fulham===
Taylor was bought by Fulham in 1997 from Southampton at a cost of £800,000. Fulham&#x27;s manager Kevin Keegan rated him as the &quot;best taker of a cross I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot; and he proved to be a good signing for the Cottagers, helping them win the Second Division title in 1999. The First Division championship followed in 2001 and thus promotion to the Premier League.

Whilst at Craven Cottage, Taylor earned his first international cap for Northern Ireland in a 3–0 defeat by Germany on 27 March 1999. He went on to make over 80 appearances for his adopted country.

He was the first-choice goalkeeper at Craven Cottage until Fulham reached the Premier League, when manager Jean Tigana signed Edwin van der Sar, thus relegating Taylor to the bench. Taylor made only one Premier League appearance in 2001–02, but an injury to Van der Sar sustained at Newcastle United on 21 December 2002 ruled him out for several months, allowing Taylor to return to the side, and he retained his place for the remainder of the season.

===Birmingham City===
Taylor signed for Birmingham City in August 2003, initially on a year-long loan deal with the possibility of a permanent contract. Manager Steve Bruce made the contract permanent in March 2004 for a £1.5 million fee. Taylor continued his impressive form and was rewarded by being nominated as the goalkeeper for the Premiership team of the 2003–04 season.

Taylor was replaced as Birmingham&#x27;s first choice goalkeeper in February 2007 by Colin Doyle, but regained his place after the first three matches of the 2007–08 Premier League season. He was again replaced as the first choice keeper in the 2009–10 Premier League season by loan signing Joe Hart, playing only the two fixtures against Hart&#x27;s parent club, Manchester City. He spent the rest of the season on the bench.

In May 2010, Taylor signed a new one-year deal with Birmingham just after they had signed new keeper Ben Foster from Manchester United. He played only four matches in 2010–11, all in cup competitions, and was on the bench as Birmingham won the 2011 Football League Cup Final. He was not offered a new contract at the end of the season.

===Final playing years===
After training with the club for two weeks in November 2011, and saving a penalty in a friendly against a Chelsea XI, Taylor signed a short-term contract, until January 2012, with Championship club Leeds United. Taylor took his place on the bench behind loan goalkeeper Alex McCarthy two days later against Barnsley. His contract was extended until the end of the season, to act as backup for Andy Lonergan,

But in March, having made no appearances for Leeds and with new manager Neil Warnock preferring not to name a goalkeeper among the substitutes, Taylor agreed to move to fellow Championship club Millwall on loan for the remainder of the season. After a string of clean sheets, Taylor was nominated for the Championship player of the month award for April. After his six-month deal came to an end, Taylor was told he would be released by Leeds at the expiry of his contract. In May 2012, Taylor agreed a 12-month contract with Millwall, staying with them for one season before retiring.

==International career==
Taylor was born in Germany to an English father and a German mother. As a British citizen who was born abroad, FIFA eligibility rules at the time of Taylor&#x27;s first international selection entitled him to represent any of the constituent countries of the United Kingdom at international level. He opted for Northern Ireland, despite having no familial connection to that country.

Taylor made his debut for the Northern Ireland U21 team in April 1998 at the age of 27, as an over-age player in a 2-1 friendly victory over Switzerland. His senior debut was against Germany in 1999: Northern Ireland lost 3–0. In an August 2005 friendly Taylor saved an injury time penalty from Malta&#x27;s George Mallia to keep the score at 1–1. He became a regular in the Northern Ireland national team, and played 88 matches, including the famous 1–0 victory over England in September 2005.

Taylor was replaced by Lee Camp as first choice goalkeeper, but was recalled to the Northern Ireland squad in August 2011 despite not being registered with a club since leaving Birmingham City. He made his 88th appearance for Northern Ireland on 11 October 2011, captaining his country in a 3–0 defeat away to Italy in a Euro 2012 qualifier. While working as the national goalkeeping coach, the 43-year-old Taylor made an emergency return to the squad in June 2015 as a back-up goalkeeper, following an injury to Roy Carroll the day before a Euro 2016 qualifier against Romania.

==Coaching career==
In July 2013, Taylorwho had studied UEFA B Licence and UEFA A Licence, Part 1was hired as goalkeeping coach for the Northern Ireland national team.

On 8 March 2019, he agreed a short-term deal to become the goalkeeping coach at Bradford City until the end of the 2018–19 season. In June 2019 he left Bradford to take up a similar role at Walsall, and in July 2022, returned to Birmingham City as part of newly appointed head coach John Eustace&#x27;s backroom staff.

<text>Non-tariff barriers to trade (NTBs; also called non-tariff measures, NTMs) are trade barriers that restrict imports or exports of goods or services through mechanisms other than the simple imposition of tariffs. Such barriers are subject to controversy and debate, as they may comply with international rules on trade yet serve protectionist purposes.

The Southern African Development Community (SADC) defines a non-tariff barrier as &quot;any obstacle to international trade that is not an import or export duty. They may take the form of import quotas, subsidies, customs delays, technical barriers, or other systems preventing or impeding trade&quot;. According to the World Trade Organization, non-tariff barriers to trade include import licensing, rules for valuation of goods at customs, pre-shipment inspections, rules of origin (&#x27;made in&#x27;), and trade prepared investment measures. A 2019 UNCTAD report concluded that trade costs associated with non-tariff measures were more than double those of traditional tariffs.

==History==

===The transition from tariffs to non-tariff barriers===

One of the reasons why industrialized countries have moved from tariffs to NTBs is the fact that developed countries have sources of income other than tariffs. Historically, in the formation of nation-states, governments had to get funding. They received it through the introduction of tariffs. This explains the fact that most developing countries still rely on tariffs as a way to finance their spending. Developed countries can afford not to depend on tariffs, at the same time developing NTBs as a possible way of international trade regulation. The second reason for the transition to NTBs is that these barriers can be used to support weak industries or compensation of industries which have been affected negatively by the reduction of tariffs. The third reason for the popularity of NTBs is the ability of interest groups to influence the process in the absence of opportunities to obtain government support for the tariffs.

==Non-tariff barriers today==

With the exception of export subsidies and quotas, NTBs are most similar to the tariffs. Tariffs for goods production were reduced during the eight rounds of negotiations in the WTO and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). After lowering of tariffs, the principle of protectionism demanded the introduction of new NTBs such as technical barriers to trade (TBT). According to statements made at United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2005), the use of NTBs, based on the amount and control of price levels has decreased significantly from 45% in 1994 to 15% in 2004, while use of other NTBs increased from 55% in 1994 to 85% in 2004.

Increasing consumer demand for safe and environment friendly products also have had their impact on increasing popularity of TBT. Many NTBs are governed by WTO agreements, which originated in the Uruguay Round (the TBT Agreement, SPS Measures Agreement, the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing), as well as GATT articles. NTBs in the field of services have become as important as in the field of trade in goods.

Most of the NTB can be defined as protectionist measures, unless they are related to difficulties in the market, such as externalities and information asymmetries between consumers and producers of goods. An example of this is safety standards and labeling requirements.

The need to protect sensitive to import industries, as well as a wide range of trade restrictions, available to the governments of industrialized countries, forcing them to resort to use the NTB, and putting serious obstacles to international trade and world economic growth. Thus, NTBs can be referred as a new form of protection which has replaced tariffs as an old form of protection.

==Types of Non-Tariff Barriers==
Professor Alan Deardorff characterises NTB policies under three headings: Purposes, Examples, and Consequences
There are several different variants of the division or classification of non-tariff barriers. Some scholars divide them between internal taxes, administrative barriers, health and sanitary regulations and government procurement policies. Others divide them into more categories such as specific limitations on trade, customs and administrative entry procedures, standards, government participation in trade, charges on import, and other categories.

The first category includes methods to directly import restrictions for protection of certain sectors of national industries: licensing and allocation of import quotas, antidumping and countervailing duties, import deposits, so-called voluntary export restraints, countervailing duties, the system of minimum import prices, etc. Under second category follow methods that are not directly aimed at restricting foreign trade and more related to the administrative bureaucracy, whose actions, however, restrict trade, for example: customs procedures, technical standards and norms, sanitary and veterinary standards, requirements for labeling and packaging, bottling, etc. The third category consists of methods that are not directly aimed at restricting the import or promoting the export, but the effects of which often lead to this result.

The non-tariff barriers can include wide variety of restrictions to trade.

== Examples of common NTBs ==
===Administrative and bureaucratic delays at the border===

Administrative and bureaucratic delays at the border increase uncertainty and the cost of maintaining inventory. For example, even though Turkey is in a (partial) customs union with the EU, transport of Turkish goods to the European Union is subject to extensive administrative overheads that Turkey estimates costs the Turkish economy three billion euros per year.

===Censorship===
Testifying before the United States Senate Committee on Finance, Subcommittee on International Trade, Customs, and Global Competitiveness on &quot;censorship as a non-tariff barrier&quot; in 2020, Richard Gere stated that economic interest compel studios to avoid social and political issues Hollywood once addressed, &quot;Imagine Marty Scorsese&#x27;s Kundun, about the life of the Dalai Lama, or my own film Red Corner, which is highly critical of the Chinese legal system. Imagine them being made today. It wouldn&#x27;t happen.&quot;

=== Embargoes ===

Embargoes are outright prohibition of trade in certain commodities. As well as quotas, embargoes may be imposed on imports or exports of particular goods in respect of certain goods supplied to or from specific countries, or in respect of all goods shipped to certain countries. Although an embargo may be imposed for biosecurity reasons, more often the reasons are political (see economic sanctions and international sanctions). Embargoes are generally considered legal barriers to trade, not to be confused with blockades, which are often considered to be acts of war.

=== Foreign exchange restrictions and foreign exchange controls ===

Foreign exchange restrictions and foreign exchange controls occupy an important place among the non-tariff regulatory instruments of foreign economic activity. Foreign exchange restrictions constitute the management of transactions between national and foreign operators, either by limiting the supply of foreign currency (to restrict imports) or by state manipulation of exchange rates (to boost exports and limit imports). 

=== Import deposits ===
Another example of foreign trade regulations is import deposits. Import deposits is a form of deposit, which the importer must pay the central bank for a definite period of time (non-interest bearing deposit) in an amount equal to all or part of the cost of imported goods.

===Administrative regulation of capital movements===
At the national level, administrative regulation of capital movements between states is carried out mainly within a framework of bilateral agreements, which include a clear definition of the legal regime, the procedure for the admission of investments and investors. It is determined by mode (fair and equitable, national, &#x27;most favoured nation&#x27;), order of nationalization and compensation, transfer profits and capital repatriation and dispute resolution.

=== Licenses ===
The most common instruments of direct regulation of imports (and sometimes export) are licenses and quotas. Almost all industrialized countries apply these non-tariff methods. The license system requires that a state (through specially authorized office) issues permits for foreign trade transactions of import and export commodities included in the lists of licensed merchandises. Product licensing can take many forms and procedures. The main types of licenses are general license that permits unrestricted importation or exportation of goods included in the lists for a certain period of time; and one-time license for a certain product importer (exporter) to import (or export). One-time license indicates a quantity of goods, its cost, its country of origin (or destination), and in some cases also customs point through which import (or export) of goods should be carried out. The use of licensing systems as an instrument for foreign trade regulation is based on a number of international level standards agreements. In particular, these agreements include some provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) / World Trade Organization (WTO) such as the Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures.

=== Localization requirement ===
An importing country may require the prospective exporter to include a degree of local participation in the product or service. Options include a designated importer, a joint-venture company with majority local control, requirement for complete local manufacture which may imply transfer of intellectual property. The WTO has not reached a conclusion on the legitimacy of these measures.

===Standards===

Standards take a special place among non-tariff barriers. Countries usually impose standards on classification, labelling and testing of products to ensure that domestic products meet domestic standards, but also to restrict sales of products of foreign manufacture unless they meet or exceed these same standards. These standards are sometimes entered to protect the safety and health of local populations and the natural environment. Standards which are ostensibly enacted for health and safety reasons can be used by states for trade protectionist and political purposes.

===Quotas===

Licensing of foreign trade is closely related to quantitative restrictions – quotas – on imports and exports of certain goods. A quota is a limitation in value or in physical terms, imposed on import and export of certain goods for a certain period of time. This category includes global quotas with respect to specific countries, seasonal quotas, and so-called &quot;voluntary export restraints&quot;. Quantitative controls on foreign trade transactions are carried out through one-time license.

Quantitative restrictions on imports and exports are direct administrative forms of government regulation of foreign trade. Licenses and quotas limit the independence of enterprises with a regard to entering foreign markets, narrowing the range of countries in which firms can conduct trade for certain commodities. They regulate the range and number of goods permitted for import and export.

However, the system of licensing and quota imports and exports, establishing firm control over foreign trade in certain goods, in many cases turns out to be more flexible and effective than economic instruments of foreign trade regulation. This can be explained by the fact that licensing and quota systems are an important instrument of trade regulation of the vast majority of the world.

This type of trade barrier normally leads to increased costs and limited selection of goods for consumers and higher import prices for companies. Import quotas can be unilateral, levied by the country without negotiations with exporting country; or bilateral or multilateral, when they are imposed after negotiations and agreements.

An export quota is a limit on the amount of goods that can be exported from a country. There are different reasons for imposing export quotas from a country. These reasons include guaranteeing of the supply of the products that are in shortage in the domestic market, manipulation of the prices on the international level, and the control of goods strategically important for the country. In some cases, the importing countries request exporting countries to impose voluntary export restraints.

====Agreement on a &quot;voluntary&quot; export restraint====
In the past decade, a widespread practice of concluding agreements on the &quot;voluntary&quot; export restrictions and the establishment of import minimum prices imposed by leading Western nations upon exporters that are weaker in an economical or political sense. These types of restrictions involve the establishment of unconventional techniques when trade barriers are introduced at the border of the exporting country instead of the importing country.

Thus, the agreement on &quot;voluntary&quot; export restraints is imposed by the exporter under the threat of sanctions to limit the export of certain goods to the importing country. Similarly, the establishment of minimum import prices should be strictly observed by the exporting firms in contracts with the importers of the country that has set such prices. In the case of reduction of export prices below the minimum level, the importing country imposes anti-dumping duty, which could lead to withdrawal from the market. “Voluntary&quot; export agreements affect trade in textiles, footwear, dairy products, consumer electronics, cars, machine tools, etc.

Problems arise when the quotas are distributed between countries because it is necessary to ensure that products from one country are not diverted in violation of quotas set out in second country. Import quotas are not necessarily designed to protect domestic producers. For example, Japan maintains quotas on many agricultural products it does not produce. Quotas on imports are used as leverage when negotiating the sales of Japanese exports, as well as avoiding excessive dependence on any other country with respect to necessary food; the supplies of which could decrease in case of bad weather or political conditions.

Export quotas can be set in order to provide domestic consumers with sufficient stocks of goods at low prices, to prevent the depletion of natural resources, as well as to increase export prices by restricting supply to foreign markets. Such restrictions (through agreements on various types of goods) allow producing countries to use quotas for such commodities as coffee and oil; as the result, prices for these products increased in importing countries.

A quota can be a tariff rate quota, global quota, discriminating quota, and export quota.

==Scarcity of information==
The scarcity of information on non-tariff barriers is a major problem to the competitiveness of developing countries. As a result, the International Trade Centre conducted national surveys and began publishing a series of technical papers on non-tariff barriers faced in developing countries. By 2015 it launched the NTM Business Surveys website listing non-tariff barriers from company perspectives.
