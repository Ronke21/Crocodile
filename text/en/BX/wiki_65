<doc id="678023" wikidata="Q1799403" url="?curid=678023" title="Labellum (botany)">
<text>In botany, the labellum (or lip) is the part of the flower of an orchid or &quot;Canna&quot;, or other less-known genera, that serves to attract insects, which pollinate the flower, and acts as a landing platform for them.

&quot;Labellum&quot; (plural: &quot;labella&quot;) is the Latin diminutive of &quot;labrum&quot;, meaning lip.

The labellum is a modified petal and can be distinguished from the other petals and from the sepals by its large size and its often irregular shape. It is not unusual for the other two petals of an orchid flower to look like the sepals, so that the labellum stands out as distinct.

In orchids, the labellum is the modified median petal that sits opposite from the fertile anther and usually highly modified from the other perianth segments. It is often united with the column and can be hinged or movable, facilitating pollination. Often, the orchid labellum is divided into three or more lobes. Some have modified fleshy lumps on the upper surface generally referred to as the callus (plural: &quot;calli&quot;), with some being divided into multiple ridges or a central keel. When the callus is flat and broad, it is sometimes called a plate, which can have fringed margins. The callus can be highly modified with striking colors that may aid in pollinator deceit and mimicry.

The labellum in orchids is often large and complex enough that terminology describing relative positions for structures on it becomes useful: the hypochile is the basal portion nearer the connection with the rest of the flower, the mesochile is the middle portion, and the epichile is the distal portion.

<text>Hayford Peirce (January 7, 1942 – November 19, 2020) was an American writer of science fiction, mysteries, and a spy thriller. He wrote numerous short stories for the science-fiction magazines &quot;Analog&quot;, &quot;Galaxy&quot;, and &quot;Omni&quot;, as well as mystery shorts for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; and &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.

&quot;The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot; states that &quot;he established a name for lightly written tales whose backgrounds were unusually well conceived.&quot;

== Biography ==
Peirce was born in 1942 in Bangor, Maine. His father, also named Hayford, a recognized authority on Byzantine art, wrote several books on the subject in French.

Peirce began writing in 1974, with the sale of &quot;Unlimited Warfare&quot;, a science fiction short story to &quot;Analog&quot; magazine.

In 2017, &quot;The Motley Fool&quot; published a financial article describing how Peirce became a &quot;dividend millionaire&quot; by investing in high-dividend stocks over a 22-year period.

== Writing career ==

Peirce wrote a number of science fiction and mystery novels, some of which were published by Tor Books, and the others by Wildside Press. They have been translated into several languages. Typical of them are &quot;Napoleon Disentimed&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Hibiscus&quot;. His one spy thriller, written in London in 1968 at the height of the fictional spy mania, was &quot;The Bel Air Blitz&quot;.

Many of his short stories concern on-going protagonists. In the science fiction field there have been collections of his &quot;Chap Foey Rider, Capitalist to the Stars&quot; stories, of his &quot;Jonathan White, Stockbroker in Orbit&quot; stories, and of his &quot;Sam Fearon, Time Scanner&quot; stories. In the mystery field, he has had two collections about protagonists living in Tahiti, &quot;Commissaire Tama&quot;, a chief of police, and &quot;Joe Caneili&quot;, a private eye.

Peirce also collaborated with David M. Alexander on stories that have appeared in &quot;Analog&quot;.

== Death ==

On November 19, 2020, Peirce was found in critical condition at his home in Tucson, Arizona, with a self-inflicted gunshot wound; his wife, Wanda Zhang Peirce, was found dead at the scene in &quot;a possible murder suicide&quot;, according to police. Peirce was hospitalized, and subsequently died. His wife was the former owner of Wanda Z&#x27;s Chinese, a restaurant in Oro Valley which had closed in 2015.

<doc id="678064" wikidata="Q2303375" url="?curid=678064" title="Petz">
<text>Petz is a series of single-player video games dating back to 1995, in which the player can adopt, raise, care for and breed their own virtual pets. Developed by PF.Magic, original &quot;Petz&quot; (&quot;Dogz&quot; and &quot;Catz&quot;) has sold over 1.5 million copies worldwide. The series has grown to over 22 million copies as of 2011 since coming under Ubisoft.

==Development==
The original &quot;Petz&quot; games — &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot; — were developed by PF.Magic, released in 1995 and 1996 respectively. They reused the graphics engine used in the game &quot;Ballz&quot;. Rob Fulop developed the first title in the series, &quot;Dogz: Your Computer Pet&quot;, following the controversy surrounding his previous title &quot;Night Trap&quot; and with the desire to make a game that was &quot;so cute and so adorable that no could ever, ever say it was bad for kids&quot;. He claims to have consulted a shopping mall Santa Claus to understand &quot;exactly what kids wanted&quot; who informed him that puppies were a popular gift request every single year, leading to the idea of a virtual puppy. 

After earning revenues of $8 million in 1997, PF.Magic was acquired by The Learning Company&#x27;s Mindscape division for $15.8 million in 1998. In 2001, Ubi Soft (Ubisoft, since 2003) acquired the entertainment division of The Learning Company, granting Ubisoft exclusive publishing rights to 88 titles, including &quot;Dogz&quot; and &quot;Catz&quot;. 

Ubisoft would publish &quot;Catz 5&quot; and &quot;Dogz 5&quot;, in 2002, as the last games following the original style, before putting franchise on hold for three years. After releasing &quot;Dogz&quot; and &quot;Catz&quot; for the Game Boy Advance in 2005 and 2006, Ubisoft announced their intention for a &quot;revitalisation&quot; of the series, in direct response to the success of Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Nintendogs&quot;. Many of the successive games were localised games from Japan or Europe in origin and were simply rebranded with the &quot;Petz&quot; name.

== Animals ==
The initial games were limited to dogz and catz, but additional animals were also introduced. These animals include Pigz, Bunnyz, Monkeyz, Dolphinz, and Hamsterz, some of which received their own games. 

Users learned how to reverse-engineer the system, and began producing additional breedz, toyz, playscenes, clothes, and developer tools for the games, as permitted by PF.Magic, Mindscape, and Ubisoft.

==Games==
===Notes===
==Reception==

The original software was generally well received, with &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; giving 1995&#x27;s &quot;Dogz&quot; 4 out of 5 stars, and &quot;PC Zone&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; giving &quot;Catz&quot; an 8/10 and B+ respectively. However, later games where less well received, in particularly compared to other virtual pet experiences that were available, with the 1999 Game Boy Color games negatively compared to Tamagotchi, and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Dogz&quot; for the Game Boy Advance, being seen as an attempt to ape &quot;Nintendogs&quot;. By 2007, &quot;Joystiq&quot; recommended buying games in the series only for &quot;people you hate&quot;.

The &quot;Petz&quot; series is also notable for the online community that grew around it, which game designer Nathalie Lawhead speculates is part of the reason for its success and enduring legacy.

<doc id="678075" wikidata="Q3514045" url="?curid=678075" title="Croatian science fiction">
<text>Croatian science fiction consists mostly of literature, novels and stories published in various magazines and story collections, and some movies and graphic novels. The first Croatian occurrence of science fiction happened in 1919 and since then, the region has seen the birth and death of several countries/states. This dynamic left a mark on the genre.

== Beginnings (1919–1940) ==
The first elements of science fiction in Croatian literature appeared in the novel &quot;Crveni ocean&quot; (&quot;Red Ocean&quot;) written by Marija Jurić-Zagorka. Zagorka was almost exclusively a mainstream author and &quot;Crveni ocean&quot; was an adventure novel with occasional SF elements. This is why it is usually considered that the first &quot;real&quot; Croatian science fiction novel was &quot;Na Pacifiku godine 2255.&quot; (&quot;In the Pacific in the Year 2255&quot;) by Milan Šufflay. Where Zagorka only touched the SF motifs for the purpose of an adventure story, Šufflay dived into the genre with all of its apparatus: technological achievements and social and political change. As the title says, the novel takes place in the far future, following the collapse of Western civilization.

The pre-WWII era ended with a few more authors and novels, mostly serialized in newspapers, such as &quot;Gospodin Čovjek&quot; (&quot;A Man of Stature&quot;) by Mato Hanžeković in 1932, and &quot;Muri Massanga - the Man Who Conquered the World&quot; by Mladen Horvat in 1927, with the latter even printed in Germany as &quot;Der Neger Muri&quot; (&quot;The Black Man Muri&quot;). Josip Smolčić used the pseudonym Aldion Degal to publish several novels: &quot;Atomska raketa&quot; (&quot;The Atomic Rocket&quot;) in 1939, &quot;Zrake smrti&quot; (&quot;The Death Rays&quot;) in 1932 and &quot;Smaragdni skarabej&quot; (&quot;The Emerald Scarab&quot;) in 1938. &quot;Majstor Omega osvaja svijet&quot; (&quot;Master Omega Conquers the World&quot;), serialised in 1940 and signed by &quot;Stan Rager&quot; (a pseudonym for Stanko Radovanović and Zvonimir Furtinger) was also popular.

== After World War II (1950–1975) ==
During World War II, there was little room for publishing any literature, with Croatia ultimately ending up in political turmoil. As soon as the situation stabilised, the genre started recovering, first through publishing science fiction works from USA and Soviet Union, and then works by one of the aforementioned authors - Zvonimir Furtinger - who began a tandem with Mladen Bjažić and published several novels over the course of a decade, starting in 1959.

A wide spectrum of topics can be gleaned from the titles alone: &quot;Osvajač 2 se ne javlja&quot; (&quot;Conqueror Two Not Responding&quot;) in 1959, &quot;Svemirska nevjesta&quot; (&quot;The Space Bride&quot;), “Varamunga – tajanstveni grad&quot; (&quot;Varamunga – the Mysterious City&quot;), the young adult novel &quot;Zagonetni stroj profesora Kružića&quot; (&quot;The Mysterious Machine of Professor Kružić&quot;) in 1960, &quot;Mrtvi se vraćaju&quot; (&quot;The Dead Return&quot;) in 1965, &quot;Ništa bez Božene&quot; (&quot;Nothing Without Božena&quot;- actually an extended version of &quot;Professor Kružić&quot;) in 1970. Topics ranged from aliens, cosmic disasters, AI, matter replication and so on. Bjažić and Furtinger reached high levels of popularity, basically paving the way for the subsequent growth of not only SF in Croatia, but also within Yugoslavia as a whole.

As opposed to more or less classic, hard(er) SF, Angelo Ritig wrote two novels: &quot;Sasvim neobično buđenje&quot; (&quot;A Quite Unusual Awakening&quot;) in 1961 and &quot;Ljubav u neboderu&quot; (&quot;Love in a Skyscraper&quot;) in 1965, which were more aimed at psychology and character development.

== Years of Sirius (1976–1989) ==
1976 was a crucial year for Croatian and Yugoslav science fiction. This year brought two events that set the tone for the genre in the whole region for the next few decades. The first one was the establishment of SFera, the science fiction fan club in Zagreb. The second was the founding of &quot;Sirius&quot;, a magazine that published science fiction stories mostly originating in the USA and the United Kingdom, but occasionally picking the best works from other countries, mainly - but not exclusively - the Soviet Union.

&quot;Sirius&quot; was published by &quot;Vjesnik&quot;, the central news and magazine company in Croatia. &quot;Vjesnik&quot; had a large number of different titles under its roof, from various entertainment, TV, enigmatic magazines, through issues that specialized in various hobbies and all the way to pulp genre literature like westerns and love or crime stories. The first editor of &quot;Sirius&quot;, effectively its founder, was Borivoj Jurković, who held the position for several years.

At its peak, &quot;Sirius&quot; reached a circulation of nearly 40,000 copies (for comparison, Yugoslavia had a population of around 20 million), making it the third largest science fiction magazine in the world at the time. Also, in 1980 and 1984, &quot;Sirius&quot; was declared the best European SF magazine. During the 13 years of its existence, around 500 stories by Croatian authors were published on its pages. Apart from the aforementioned Bjažić and Furtinger, new names emerged to become the cornerstones of Croatian SF. These included Predrag Raos, Darko Macan, Vera Ivosić-Santo (later known as Veronika Santo), Branko Pihač, Živko Prodanović, Neven Antičević (who went on to become the founder of one of the biggest publishing houses and bookstore chains in Croatia), Radovan Devlić (mainly a comic author), Damir Mikuličić, Darije Đokić and many others.

In parallel to all of this, SFera immediately outgrew its initial role as a SF fan club. In its second year, SFera started its fanzine &quot;Parsek&quot;. &quot;Parsek&quot; had a concept similar to western fanzines - which was in turn similar to that of professional magazines - to nurture writers and theoretical work, as well as acting as a bulletin for the club members. Since 1979, SFera has also organized SFeraKon, its annual SF convention, which immediately became the biggest fan and professional gathering in the region.

In addition, SFera established the first literary award in Croatia called &quot;Sfera award&quot;. Sfera was first awarded in 1981 and has been active since. In 1996 SFera also started a youth program, organizing a national contest for stories and literary works for all primary and secondary school students in the whole country. Several hundred works per year have been revised, with the latest number of entries going into more than a thousand. Some of the later emerging authors got their first break from this contest.

== The Independence War and the Aftermath (1990–2000) ==
The war for independence caused the breakup of Yugoslavia and the collapse of socialist system followed. The fragmentation of the market into six smaller republics (some of which were at war with each other) was detrimental to the publishing projects that became more risky and of questionable profitability. After the initial shock of a war, the science fiction scene soon started showing signs of life. After the 1991 SFeraKon was skipped due to war, the convention resumed in 1992.

&quot;Sirius&quot; was extinguished in 1989 at a circulation of around 10,000. There was a three year lull and then, in 1992, a small private publisher started what was to be the spiritual heir to &quot;Sirius&quot;, a magazine called &quot;Futura&quot;. Its first editor was Vlatko Jurić Kokić (he later joined SFera and even participated in organising SFeraKon), but starting from the 6th issue in spring of 1993 replaced by Krsto A. Mažuranić, one of the founders of Sfera. Since then, &quot;Futura&quot; has regularly published at least one story written by a Croatian author each month. With a smaller market and unfavorable cultural circumstances, &quot;Futura&quot; has continuously struggled on the edge of existence with its circulation rarely - if ever - reaching 1000 sold copies and usually going around 500 per issue.

In 1995 - although this was planned for 1994 - SFera started publishing an annual short story collection with exclusively Croatian authors. Initiated by Darko Macan and Tatjana Jambrišak, with Macan being the first editor, the series jump-started the new generation of Croatian writers, some of whom would become well known in the years and even decades to come. Alongside Macan, who had already published stories in &quot;Sirius&quot;, the most important is Aleksandar Žiljak, a prolific author who had previously published stories in Croatian daily newspapers and magazines, but also SFera&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Parsek&quot;.

Several SF conventions and SF clubs were established by the year 2000: Kutikon in Kutina, Essekon in Osijek (Essek being the Hungarian name for the city), RiKon in Rijeka (organised by the Aurora club) and Istrakon in Pazin (organised by the Albus club).

== 21st century (2001 onward) ==
In 2003, SFera took another step forward, starting to publish author anthologies under the joint name &quot;Biblioteka SFera&quot;. Twelve anthologies were published in three years. Those anthologies represented the previous 10–15 years of their authors’ work and served as the cornerstone of Croatian science fiction of that decade.

The year 2006 brought &quot;Ad Astra - an Anthology of Croatian Science Fiction Stories 1976-2006&quot;, gathering 30 stories by 30 authors published in the past three decades.

Fanzines also started to flourish with Prime (by Aurora), SFemir and several others. Additionally, in 2002 the Istrakon crew started publishing their own collection of miniature stories (up to 1000 words). The same year the Festival of Fantastic Literature was established, also taking place in the city of Pazin, publishing their story collection every year from 2006. Another convention emerged in 2006 - Liburnicon in Opatija.

After 30 years of having a single award for national science fiction literature, a second award was established in Rijeka by the &quot;3. zmaj&quot; SF club (&quot;The Third Dragon&quot;, a successor to Aurora). Both the SFERA and Artefakt for several categories continue to be awarded every year.

New fandom and semi-professional groups have emerged since 2010: in Slavonski Brod the SF group &quot;Orion&quot; came into being with a convention called &quot;Marsonicon&quot; (after Marsonia, the old Roman name of the city), a series of Croatian and regional SF annual collection series titled &quot;Marsonic&quot;, started in 2012, and a fanzine named &quot;Svemirski Brod&quot; in 2013. By the end of the decade, the city of Split followed suit with FantaSTikon and one more series of annual collections of Croatian science fiction in print.

In 2020, eight years after the first Croatian Eurocon, the second was held in Rijeka along with Rikon, dubbed &quot;Futuricon&quot;. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, it was held mostly on-line with lectures, talks, panels and other program items broadcast through Discord and other networks.

A project started by a small publisher named &quot;Hangar 7&quot;, was another continuation: that of the never forgotten &quot;Sirius&quot;. The first issue of &quot;Sirius B&quot; saw the light of day in 2011 and continued with the old concept: mostly translated foreign stories, with most, if not all, coming from the English-speaking world - due to scarcity of funds needed for translating from other languages, this was the only option - and the occasional story by Croatian authors.

In 2019 a different kind of project emerged: &quot;Alienus&quot; &quot;publishing&quot;, based on self-sufficiency. The idea is that the full profit of a book is directed towards publishing subsequent books and the work on publishing a new book starts only once there are sufficient funds.

<doc id="678078" wikidata="Q1005215" url="?curid=678078" title="Inclusive fitness">
<text>Inclusive fitness is a conceptual framework in evolutionary biology first defined by W. D. Hamilton in 1964. It is primarily used to aid the understanding of how social traits are expected to evolve in structured populations. It involves partitioning an individual&#x27;s expected fitness returns into two distinct components: direct fitness returns - the component of a focal individual’s fitness that is independent of who it interacts with socially; indirect fitness returns - the component that is dependent on who it interacts with socially. The direct component of an individual&#x27;s fitness is often called its personal fitness, while an individual’s direct and indirect fitness components taken together are often called its inclusive fitness. 

Under an inclusive fitness framework direct fitness returns are realised through the offspring a focal individual produces independent of who it interacts with, while indirect fitness returns are realised by adding up all the effects our focal individual has on the (number of) offspring produced by those it interacts with weighted by the relatedness of our focal individual to those it interacts with. This can be visualised in a sexually reproducing system (assuming identity by descent) by saying that an individual&#x27;s own child, who carries one half of that individual&#x27;s genes, represents one offspring equivalent. A sibling&#x27;s child, who will carry one-quarter of the individual&#x27;s genes, will then represent 1/2 offspring equivalent (and so on - see coefficient of relationship for further examples). 

Neighbour-modulated fitness is the conceptual inverse of inclusive fitness. Where inclusive fitness calculates an individual’s indirect fitness component by summing the fitness that focal individual receives through modifying the productivities of those it interacts with (its neighbours), neighbour-modulated fitness instead calculates it by summing the effects an individual’s neighbours have on that focal individual’s productivity. When taken over an entire population, these two frameworks give functionally equivalent results. Hamilton’s rule is a particularly important result in the fields of evolutionary ecology and behavioral ecology that follows naturally from the partitioning of fitness into direct and indirect components, as given by inclusive and neighbour-modulated fitness. It enables us to see how the average trait value of a population is expected to evolve under the assumption of small mutational steps. 

Kin selection is a well known case whereby inclusive fitness effects can influence the evolution of social behaviours. Kin selection relies on positive relatedness (driven by identity by descent) to enable individuals who positively influence the fitness of those they interact with at a cost to their own personal fitness, to outcompete individuals employing more selfish strategies. It is thought to be one of the primary mechanisms underlying the evolution of altruistic behaviour, alongside the less prevalent reciprocity (see also reciprocal altruism), and to be of particular importance in enabling the evolution of eusociality among other forms of group living. Inclusive fitness has also been used to explain the existence of spiteful behaviour, where individuals negatively influence the fitness of those they interact with at a cost to their own personal fitness. 

Inclusive fitness and neighbour-modulated fitness are both frameworks that leverage the individual as the unit of selection. It is from this that the gene-centered view of evolution emerged: a perspective that has facilitated much of the work done into the evolution of conflict (examples include parent-offspring conflict, interlocus sexual conflict, and intragenomic conflict).

== Overview ==

The British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton showed mathematically that, because other members of a population may share one&#x27;s genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by indirectly promoting the reproduction and survival of other individuals who also carry that gene. This is variously called &quot;kin theory&quot;, &quot;kin selection theory&quot; or &quot;inclusive fitness theory&quot;. The most obvious category of such individuals is close genetic relatives, and where these are concerned, the application of inclusive fitness theory is often more straightforwardly treated via the narrower kin selection theory. Hamilton&#x27;s theory, alongside reciprocal altruism, is considered one of the two primary mechanisms for the evolution of social behaviors in natural species and a major contribution to the field of sociobiology, which holds that some behaviors can be dictated by genes, and therefore can be passed to future generations and may be selected for as the organism evolves.

Belding&#x27;s ground squirrel provides an example; it gives an alarm call to warn its local group of the presence of a predator. By emitting the alarm, it gives its own location away, putting itself in more danger. In the process, however, the squirrel may protect its relatives within the local group (along with the rest of the group). Therefore, if the effect of the trait influencing the alarm call typically protects the other squirrels in the immediate area, it will lead to the passing on of more copies of the alarm call trait in the next generation than the squirrel could leave by reproducing on its own. In such a case natural selection will increase the trait that influences giving the alarm call, provided that a sufficient fraction of the shared genes include the gene(s) predisposing to the alarm call.

&quot;Synalpheus regalis&quot;, a eusocial shrimp, is an organism whose social traits meet the inclusive fitness criterion. The larger defenders protect the young juveniles in the colony from outsiders. By ensuring the young&#x27;s survival, the genes will continue to be passed on to future generations.

Inclusive fitness is more generalized than strict kin selection, which requires that the shared genes are &quot;identical by descent&quot;. Inclusive fitness is not limited to cases where &quot;kin&quot; (&#x27;close genetic relatives&#x27;) are involved.

== Hamilton&#x27;s rule ==

Hamilton&#x27;s rule is most easily derived in the framework of neighbour-modulated fitness, where the fitness of a focal individual is considered to be modulated by the actions of its neighbours. This is the inverse of inclusive fitness where we consider how a focal individual modulates the fitness of its neighbours. However, taken over the entire population, these two approaches are equivalent to each other so long as fitness remains linear in trait value. A simple derivation of Hamilton&#x27;s rule can be gained via the Price equation as follows. If an infinite population is assumed, such that any non-selective effects can be ignored, the Price equation can be written as:

:formula_1

Where formula_2 represents trait value and formula_3 represents fitness, either taken for an individual formula_4 or averaged over the entire population. If fitness is linear in trait value, the fitness for an individual formula_4 can be written as:

:formula_6

Where formula_7 is the component of an individual&#x27;s fitness which is independent of trait value, formula_8 parameterizes the effect of individual formula_4&#x27;s phenotype on its own fitness (written negative, by convention, to represent a fitness cost), formula_10 is the average trait value of individual formula_4&#x27;s neighbours, and formula_12 parameterizes the effect of individual formula_4&#x27;s neighbours on its fitness (written positive, by convention, to represent a fitness benefit). Substituting into the Price equation then gives:

:formula_14

Since formula_7 by definition does not covary with formula_16, this rearranges to:

:formula_17

Since formula_18 this term must, by definition, be greater than 0. This is because variances can never be negative, and negative mean fitness is undefined (if mean fitness is 0 the population has crashed, similarly 0 variance would imply a monomorphic population, in both cases a change in mean trait value is impossible). It can then be said that that mean trait value will increase (formula_19) when:

:formula_20

or

:formula_21

Giving Hamilton&#x27;s rule, where relatedness (formula_22) is a regression coefficient of the form formula_23, or formula_24. Relatedness here can vary between a value of 1 (only interacting with individuals of the same trait value) and -1 (only interacting with individuals of a [most] different trait value), and will be 0 when all individuals in the population interact with equal likelihood.

Fitness in practice, however, does not tend to be linear in trait value -this would imply an increase to an infinitely large trait value being just as valuable to fitness as a similar increase to a very small trait value. Consequently, to apply Hamilton&#x27;s rule to biological systems the conditions under which fitness can be approximated to being linear in trait value must first be found. There are two main methods used to approximate fitness as being linear in trait value; performing a partial regression with respect to both the focal individual&#x27;s trait value and its neighbours average trait value, or taking a first order Taylor series approximation of fitness with respect to trait value. Performing a partial regression requires minimal assumptions, but only provides a statistical relationship as opposed to a mechanistic one, and cannot be extrapolated beyond the dataset that it was generated from. Linearizing via a Taylor series approximation, however, provides a powerful mechanistic relationship (see also causal model), but requires the assumption that evolution proceeds in sufficiently small mutational steps that the difference in trait value between an individual and its neighbours is close to 0 (in accordance with Fisher&#x27;s geometric model): although in practice this approximation can often still retain predictive power under larger mutational steps. 

As a first order approximation (linear in trait value), Hamilton&#x27;s rule can only inform about how the mean trait value in a population is expected to change (directional selection). It contains no information about how the variance in trait value is expected to change (disruptive selection). As such it cannot be considered sufficient to determine evolutionary stability, even when Hamilton&#x27;s rule predicts no change in trait value. This is because disruptive selection terms, and subsequent conditions for evolutionary branching, must instead be obtained from second order approximations (quadratic in trait value) of fitness.

Gardner &quot;et al.&quot; (2007) suggest that Hamilton&#x27;s rule can be applied to multi-locus models, but that it should be done at the point of interpreting theory, rather than the starting point of enquiry. They suggest that one should &quot;use standard population genetics, game theory, or other methodologies to derive a condition for when the social trait of interest is favoured by selection and then use Hamilton&#x27;s rule as an aid for conceptualizing this result&quot;. It is now becoming increasingly popular to use adaptive dynamics approaches to gain selection conditions which are directly interpretable with respect to Hamilton&#x27;s rule.

== Altruism ==

The concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an &quot;altruism gene&quot; (or complex of genes) that influences an organism&#x27;s behaviour to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behaviour also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to common descent. In formal terms, if such a complex of genes arises, Hamilton&#x27;s rule (rbc) specifies the selective criteria (in terms of cost, benefit and relatedness) for such a trait to increase in frequency in the population. Hamilton noted that inclusive fitness theory does not by itself predict that a species will necessarily evolve such altruistic behaviours, since an opportunity or context for interaction between individuals is a more primary and necessary requirement in order for any social interaction to occur in the first place. As Hamilton put it, &quot;Altruistic or selfish acts are only possible when a suitable social object is available. In this sense behaviours are conditional from the start.&quot; In other words, while inclusive fitness theory specifies a set of necessary criteria for the evolution of altruistic traits, it does not specify a sufficient condition for their evolution in any given species. More primary necessary criteria include the existence of gene complexes for altruistic traits in gene pool, as mentioned above, and especially that &quot;a suitable social object is available&quot;, as Hamilton noted. The American evolutionary biologist Paul W. Sherman gives a fuller discussion of Hamilton&#x27;s latter point:

The occurrence of sibling cannibalism in several species underlines the point that inclusive fitness theory should not be understood to simply predict that genetically related individuals will inevitably recognize and engage in positive social behaviours towards genetic relatives. Only in species that have the appropriate traits in their gene pool, and in which individuals typically interacted with genetic relatives in the natural conditions of their evolutionary history, will social behaviour potentially be elaborated, and consideration of the evolutionarily typical demographic composition of grouping contexts of that species is thus a first step in understanding how selection pressures upon inclusive fitness have shaped the forms of its social behaviour. Richard Dawkins gives a simplified illustration:

Evidence from a variety of species including primates and other social mammals suggests that contextual cues (such as familiarity) are often significant proximate mechanisms mediating the expression of altruistic behaviour, regardless of whether the participants are always in fact genetic relatives or not. This is nevertheless evolutionarily stable since selection pressure acts on typical conditions, not on the rare occasions where actual genetic relatedness differs from that normally encountered. Inclusive fitness theory thus does not imply that organisms evolve to direct altruism towards genetic relatives. Many popular treatments do however promote this interpretation, as illustrated in a review:

Such misunderstandings of inclusive fitness&#x27; implications for the study of altruism, even amongst professional biologists utilizing the theory, are widespread, prompting prominent theorists to regularly attempt to highlight and clarify the mistakes. An example of attempted clarification is West et al. (2010):

== Green-beard effect ==

As well as interactions in reliable contexts of genetic relatedness, altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behaviour in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them. As Dawkins points out in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; and &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot;, this must be distinguished from the green-beard effect.

The green-beard effect is the act of a gene (or several closely linked genes), that: 
# Produces a phenotype.
# Allows recognition of that phenotype in others.
# Causes the individual to preferentially treat other individuals with the same gene.

The green-beard effect was originally a thought experiment by Hamilton in his publications on inclusive fitness in 1964, although it hadn&#x27;t yet been observed. As of today, it has been observed in few species. Its rarity is probably due to its susceptibility to &#x27;cheating&#x27; whereby individuals can gain the trait that confers the advantage, without the altruistic behaviour. This normally would occur via the crossing over of chromosomes which happens frequently, often rendering the green-beard effect a transient state. However, Wang et al. has shown in one of the species where the effect is common (fire ants), recombination cannot occur due to a large genetic transversion, essentially forming a supergene. This, along with homozygote inviability at the green-beard loci allows for the extended maintenance of the green-beard effect.

Equally, cheaters may not be able to invade the green-beard population if the mechanism for preferential treatment and the phenotype are intrinsically linked. In budding yeast (&quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;), the dominant allele FLO1 is responsible for flocculation (self-adherence between cells) which helps protect them against harmful substances such as ethanol. While &#x27;cheater&#x27; yeast cells occasionally find their way into the biofilm-like substance that is formed from FLO1 expressing yeast, they cannot invade as the FLO1 expressing yeast will not bind to them in return, and thus the phenotype is intrinsically linked to the preference.

== Parent–offspring conflict and optimization ==

Early writings on inclusive fitness theory (including Hamilton 1964) used K in place of B/C. Thus Hamilton&#x27;s rule was expressed as

formula_25
is the necessary and sufficient condition for selection for altruism.

Where B is the gain to the beneficiary, C is the cost to the actor and r is the number of its own offspring equivalents the actor expects in one of the offspring of the beneficiary. r is either called the coefficient of relatedness or coefficient of relationship, depending on how it is computed. The method of computing has changed over time, as has the terminology. It is not clear whether or not changes in the terminology followed changes in computation.

Robert Trivers (1974) defined &quot;parent-offspring conflict&quot; as any case where

formula_26

i.e., K is between 1 and 2. The benefit is greater than the cost but is less than twice the cost. In this case, the parent would wish the offspring to behave as if r is 1 between siblings, although it is actually presumed to be 1/2 or closely approximated by 1/2. In other words, a parent would wish its offspring to give up ten offspring in order to raise 11 nieces and nephews. The offspring, when not manipulated by the parent, would require at least 21 nieces and nephews to justify the sacrifice of 10 of its own offspring.

The parent is trying to maximize its number of grandchildren, while the offspring is trying to maximize the number of its own offspring equivalents (via offspring and nieces and nephews) it produces. If the parent cannot manipulate the offspring and therefore loses in the conflict, the grandparents with the fewest grandchildren seem to be selected for. In other words, if the parent has no influence on the offspring&#x27;s behaviour, grandparents with fewer grandchildren increase in frequency in the population.

By extension, parents with the fewest offspring will also increase in frequency. This seems to go against Ronald Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection&quot; which states that the change in fitness over the course of a generation equals the variance in fitness at the beginning of the generation. Variance is defined as the square of a quantity—standard deviation —and as a square must always be positive (or zero). That would imply that e fitness could never decrease as time passes. This goes along with the intuitive idea that lower fitness cannot be selected for. During parent-offspring conflict, the number of stranger equivalents reared per offspring equivalents reared is going down. Consideration of this phenomenon caused Orlove (1979) and Grafen (2006) to say that nothing is being maximized.

According to Trivers, if Sigmund Freud had tried to explain intra-family conflict after Hamilton instead of before him, he would have attributed the motivation for the conflict and for the castration complex to resource allocation issues rather than to sexual jealousy.

Incidentally, when k=1 or k=2, the average number of offspring per parent stays constant as time goes by. When k&lt;1 or k&gt;2 then the average number of offspring per parent increases as time goes by.

The term &quot;gene&quot; can refer to a locus (location) on an organism&#x27;s DNA—a section that codes for a particular trait. Alternative versions of the code at that location are called &quot;alleles.&quot; If there are two alleles at a locus, one of which codes for altruism and the other for selfishness, an individual who has one of each is said to be a heterozygote at that locus. If the heterozygote uses half of its resources raising its own offspring and the other half helping its siblings raise theirs, that condition is called codominance. If there is codominance the &quot;2&quot; in the above argument is exactly 2. If by contrast, the altruism allele is more dominant, then the 2 in the above would be replaced by a number smaller than 2. If the selfishness allele is the more dominant, something greater than 2 would replace the 2.

== Opposing view ==

A 2010 paper by Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita, and E. O. Wilson suggested that standard natural selection theory is superior to inclusive fitness theory, stating that the interactions between cost and benefit cannot be explained only in terms of relatedness. This, Nowak said, makes Hamilton&#x27;s rule at worst superfluous and at best ad hoc. Gardner in turn was critical of the paper, describing it as &quot;a really terrible article&quot;, and along with other co-authors has written a reply, submitted to &quot;Nature&quot;. The disagreement stems from a long history of confusion over what Hamilton&#x27;s rule represents. Hamilton&#x27;s rule gives the direction of mean phenotypic change (directional selection) so long as fitness is linear in phenotype, and the utility of Hamilton&#x27;s rule is simply a reflection of when it is suitable to consider fitness as being linear in phenotype. The primary (and strictest) case is when evolution proceeds in very small mutational steps. Under such circumstances Hamilton&#x27;s rule then emerges as the result of taking a first order Taylor series approximation of fitness with regards to phenotype. This assumption of small mutational steps (otherwise known as δ-weak selection) is often made on the basis of Fisher&#x27;s geometric model and underpins much of modern evolutionary theory.

In work prior to Nowak &quot;et al.&quot; (2010), various authors derived different versions of a formula for formula_22, all designed to preserve Hamilton&#x27;s rule. Orlove noted that if a formula for formula_22 is defined so as to ensure that Hamilton&#x27;s rule is preserved, then the approach is by definition ad hoc. However, he published an unrelated derivation of the same formula for formula_22 – a derivation designed to preserve two statements about the rate of selection – which on its own was similarly ad hoc. Orlove argued that the existence of two unrelated derivations of the formula for formula_22 reduces or eliminates the ad hoc nature of the formula, and of inclusive fitness theory as well. The derivations were demonstrated to be unrelated by corresponding parts of the two identical formulae for formula_22 being derived from the genotypes of different individuals. The parts that were derived from the genotypes of different individuals were terms to the right of the minus sign in the covariances in the two versions of the formula for formula_22. By contrast, the terms left of the minus sign in both derivations come from the same source. In populations containing only two trait values, it has since been shown that formula_22 is in fact Sewall Wright&#x27;s coefficient of relationship.

Engles (1982) suggested that the c/b ratio be considered as a continuum of this behavioural trait rather than discontinuous in nature. From this approach fitness transactions can be better observed because there is more to what is happening to affect an individual&#x27;s fitness than just losing and gaining.

<text>Blood Feast is a 1963 American splatter film. It was composed, shot, and directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis, written by Allison Louise Downe from an idea by Lewis and David F. Freidman, and stars Mal Arnold, William Kerwin, Connie Mason, and Lyn Bolton. The plot focuses on a psychopathic food caterer named Fuad Ramses (Arnold) who kills women so that he can include their body parts in his meals and perform sacrifices to his &quot;Egyptian goddess&quot; Ishtar.

&quot;Blood Feast&quot; is considered the first splatter film, a sub-genre of horror noted for its graphic depictions of on-screen gore. It was highly successful, grossing $4 million against its minuscule $24,500 budget, while receiving poor reviews from critics, who criticized it as amateurish and vulgar. The film was followed by a belated sequel, &quot;Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat&quot;, in 2002.

== Plot ==
A woman comes home to her Miami Beach apartment and hears of a recent murder in Rogers Park. She is then murdered while taking a bath. Before leaving, the killer hacks off her leg above the knee with a machete and bags it. A copy of a book titled &quot;Ancient Weird Religious Rites&quot; is seen near the body.

At the police station the following day, Detective Pete Thornton consults with the chief of the homicide bureau about the killings, who says that the killer follows a pattern of mutilating his victims by removing their limbs and organs. Elsewhere in town, Dorothy Fremont hires a caterer named Fuad Ramses to arrange a dinner party for her daughter, Suzette. Ramses – who is the serial murderer – tells Mrs. Fremont he will prepare an ancient Egyptian feast for the affair. Mrs. Fremont is delighted, as Suzette is interested in Egyptology. After Mrs. Fremont leaves Ramses&#x27; store, he goes to a back room, where he has enshrined a statue of the goddess Ishtar. Ramses is preparing a &quot;blood feast&quot; – a stew from his victims&#x27; blood and body parts intended to resurrect Ishtar.

Later that day, Thornton tells the chief he interviewed the latest victim&#x27;s acquaintances and that she was a book club member. That evening, Tony and Marcy are on a nearby beach. Ramses arrives, knocks Tony unconscious, and removes Marcy&#x27;s brain from her skull. Thornton and the chief arrive on the scene but cannot get helpful information from Tony, who is hysterical. They later question Marcy&#x27;s mother, who tells them Marcy belonged to a book club. Sometime later, Ramses stakes out a motel. He knocks on a woman&#x27;s door and attacks her when she answers, ripping her tongue out as another ingredient of his &quot;blood feast.&quot;

Suzette attends an Egyptian studies lecture with her boyfriend, Detective Thornton, at the local university. The lecturer, Dr. Flanders, tells them about the pharaohs Ramses I and Ramses II and the cult of Ishtar that thrived during their rule five thousand years prior. He describes a ritual in which women were sacrificed to the goddess on an altar, and their body parts were prepared and served as dishes during the feast; this was said to cause Ishtar to be reborn. After the lecture, Suzette and Thornton learn that a victim has been found near death and taken to a hospital. Thornton drives Suzette home and rushes to the hospital. The victim, identified as Janet Blake, recounts her attacker saying something that sounded like &quot;Etar&quot; and dies.

Ramses receives a letter from Suzette&#x27;s friend Trudy Sanders, requesting a copy of &quot;Ancient Weird Religious Rites&quot; he advertised in the newspaper; he kidnaps Trudy that evening. The next day, Trudy awakens in Ramses&#x27;s back room. Ramses lashes Trudy with a scourge, collecting her blood in a silver chalice. Suzette informs Thornton that Fuad Ramses will be catering her dinner party and serving an authentic Egyptian feast in honor of Ishtar. Noting the similarity between Ishtar and the word &quot;Etar,&quot; Thornton calls Dr. Flanders and learns that Ramses is the author of &quot;Ancient Weird Religious Rites&quot;. Deducing Ramses to be the killer, Thornton and the police race to Ramses&#x27; store, where they discover the Ishtar shrine, Trudy&#x27;s body, and other human remains. The police head to the Fremont house to arrest Ramses and stop the guests from partaking in the feast.

Ramses arrives at the dinner party and asks Suzette to help him make the feast &quot;more authentic.&quot; He has Suzette lie on a kitchen countertop and tells her to close her eyes and offer a prayer to Ishtar. As he raises his machete to decapitate her, Mrs. Fremont enters the kitchen, and he flees. The police chase Ramses through a dump, and he climbs into the back of a garbage truck. The unaware truck driver turns on the trash compactor, crushing Ramses. Thornton explains to the chief how he deduced the killer&#x27;s identity and says Ramses must have kept a list of people who requested his book as potential victims. The detectives return to their headquarters to file a report; elsewhere, the statue of Ishtar sheds tears of blood.

==Production==
=== Development ===
The concept for &quot;Blood Feast&quot; arose in the early 1960s, three years after the release of director Alfred Hitchcock’s horror film &quot;Psycho&quot;. Lewis, previously a teacher at Mississippi State College, had quit his job in order to enter the film business, and directed several &quot;nudie cutie&quot; films in the early 1960s, produced by David F. Friedman (who would later produce &quot;Blood Feast&quot; and several other splatter films that Lewis would direct). Lewis had seen &quot;Psycho&quot; and felt that the film had cheated by showing the results of the murders in the film but not the action, because Hitchcock could not risk getting turned down by theaters. The main idea behind &quot;Blood Feast&quot; was that bathtubs of blood would be spilled in an effort to portray an Egyptian meal cooked with the bodies of virgins and a woman&#x27;s tongue being ripped out of her mouth.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place in Miami, Florida over a period of four days, with a budget of $24,000. Director Lewis wanted a realistic prop for the scene where a woman gets her tongue ripped out; in order to accommodate this, a sheep&#x27;s tongue was imported from Tampa Bay and used in the scene. All other limbs and organs used during production were imported locally. Lewis filmed &quot;Blood Feast&quot; in color in order to show the red blood used in the film.

== Release ==

Distributed by Box Office Spectaculars, the film was released July 6, 1963 at the Bellevue Drive-In in Bellevue (now Peoria) Illinois. The film was advertised as &quot;Egyptian Blood Feast&quot; at drive-ins in New York.

Producer Friedman came up with some publicity stunts for the film, such as giving theater-goers &quot;vomit bags&quot; and intentionally taking out an injunction against the film in Sarasota, Florida, in order to gain publicity. Both were very effective and generated more interest in the film, which became highly successful, grossing $4 million against its minuscule $24,500 budget.

===Censorship===
In the United Kingdom, the film faced censorship issues, eventually being banned and added to the infamous &quot;video nasty&quot; list. It was given a DVD release in 2001 with 23 seconds of cuts. In 2005, the film was finally released uncut with an 18 certificate after more than 40 years of being banned.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Blood Feast&quot; was first released on VHS home video by Continental Video in the 1980s. It also received VHS and DVD releases by Something Weird Video in the late 1990s.

In 2017, Arrow Video released the film in a DVD and Blu-ray double pack.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Blood Feast&quot; received generally negative reviews. &quot;Variety&quot; declared the film to be a &quot;totally inept shocker&quot;, &quot;incredibly crude and unprofessional from start to finish&quot; and &quot;an insult even to the most puerile and salacious of audiences&quot;. The review labeled the entire production a &quot;fiasco&quot;, calling the screenplay (credited to Louise Downe) &quot;senseless&quot;, and the acting &quot;amateurish&quot;. Of Lewis&#x27; direction, camerawork, and musical composition, the review judged that he had &quot;failed dismally on all three counts&quot;. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described &quot;Blood Feast&quot; as &quot;a blot on the American film industry.&quot; Stephen King has said that it is &quot;the worst horror movie&quot; he has ever seen.

In response to &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s criticism of the film, Friedman said, &quot;Herschell and I have often wondered who told the &quot;Variety&quot; scribe we were taking ourselves seriously&quot;.

Jerry Renshaw of &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; liked the film, but criticized the film&#x27;s poor acting and noticeably low budget. Renshaw concluded his review by calling the film &quot;offensive, nasty, shabby, and revolting, but also great fun, if you can stand the sight of guts&quot;.
On his website &quot;Fantastic Movie Musings and Ramblings&quot;, Dave Sindelar panned the film, criticizing the acting and stating that director Lewis &quot;manages to make his movies look like home movies without giving them that air of verisimilitude that would make them believable&quot;. Dennis Schwartz of &quot;Ozus&#x27; World Movie Reviews&quot; gave &quot;Blood Feast&quot; a C grade, stating that it was &quot;one of those really bad films that some take pleasure laughing at and others sneering at and others doing both&quot;.
Allmovie&#x27;s Fred Beldin wrote, &quot;The plot is threadbare, the acting is on a par with the clumsiest of high school plays and the direction is static and uninvolving. Nevertheless, this is one of the important releases in film history, ushering in a new acceptance of explicit violence that was obviously just waiting to be exploited&quot;.

On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 38% based on , with a weighted average rating of 4.48/10.

===Significance===
&quot;Blood Feast&quot; immediately became notorious for its explicit gore and violence. It is often cited erroneously as one of the first films to show people dying with their eyes open (earlier examples include D. W. Griffith&#x27;s 1909 film &quot;The Country Doctor&quot;, William A. Wellman&#x27;s 1931 film &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; and 1960&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;).

Fuad Ramses was described by author Christopher Wayne Curry – in his book &quot;A Taste of Blood: The Films of Herschell Gordon Lewis&quot; – as &quot;the original machete-wielding madman&quot; and the forerunner to similar characters in &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot;. Lewis said of the film, &quot;I&#x27;ve often referred to &quot;Blood Feast&quot; as a Walt Whitman poem. It&#x27;s no good, but it was the first of its type.&quot; &quot;One of the all-time greats,&quot; enthused Cramps singer and horror aficionado Lux Interior. &quot;It was the first gore movie… Now, it looks kind of funny, but it&#x27;s still really sick.&quot;

&quot;Blood Feast&quot; is the first part of what the director&#x27;s fans call &quot;The Blood Trilogy&quot;. Rounding out the trilogy are &quot;Two Thousand Maniacs!&quot; (1964) and &quot;Color Me Blood Red&quot; (1965). After the third, producer Friedman said, &quot;I think that for now we&#x27;re going to abandon making any more &#x27;super blood and gore&#x27; movies, since so many of our contemporaries are launching similar productions, causing a risk that the market will quickly reach a saturation point.&quot;

== Literature ==
Lewis wrote a novelization of &quot;Blood Feast&quot; to coincide with the release of the film. The novel, which features significantly different versions of central characters Fuad Ramses, Pete Thornton and Suzette Fremont, has a much more humorous tone than the film and is set in Chicago rather than Miami. It was reprinted by FantaCo Enterprises in the 1980s.

A black-and-white two-issue comic book adaptation of the film was published by Eternity Comics in 1991. It was written by Jack Herman, penciled by Stan Timmons and inked by Mike Matthew.

==Legacy==

=== Sequels ===
&quot;Blood Feast&quot; was the first part of Lewis&#x27; &quot;Blood Trilogy&quot;, with the others being &quot;Two Thousand Maniacs!&quot; and &quot;Color Me Blood Red&quot;.

A sequel, &quot;Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat&quot;, was released in 2002. It takes place years after the first film, with Fuad&#x27;s grandson following in his grandfather&#x27;s footsteps. It marked the first time Lewis and Friedman had worked together on a film in 36 years.

&quot;Blood Diner&quot; (1987) was produced with the intention of making it a &quot;spiritual sequel&quot; to &quot;Blood Feast&quot;.

===Remake===
A remake directed by Marcel Walz and starring Robert Rusler as Fuad Ramses, was given a limited theatrical release on June 23, 2017.

<text>Alpha Delta Pi (), commonly known as ADPi (pronounced &quot;ay-dee-pye&quot;), is an International Panhellenic sorority founded on May 15, 1851, at Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia. It is the oldest secret society for women.

Alpha Delta Pi is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference. The sorority&#x27;s national philanthropic partner is the Ronald McDonald House Charities. Its executive office is located in Atlanta, Georgia.

== History ==
Alpha Delta Pi was first founded as the Adelphean Society on May 15, 1851, at Wesleyan Female College in Macon, Georgia. The six founders included Eugenia Tucker Fitzgerald, Elizabeth Williams Mitchell, Sophronia Woodruff Dews, Octavia Andrew Rush, Mary Evans Glass, and Ella Pierce Turner.

In 1904, a committee of three, led by Jewel Davis, contacted Attorney Dupont Guerry, the college&#x27;s president, about to the procedure to become a national organization. They secured a charter of incorporation from the state of Georgia. In 1905, the Adelphean Society changed its name to Alpha Delta Phi. At the time of nationalization, Alpha Delta Phi, as a &quot;women&#x27;s fraternity&quot;, had sixty active members and 3,000 alumnae.

In 1905, the &quot;Beta chapter&quot; was established at Salem College in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, by two members of the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;. The chapter had seven members and fifteen new initiates until the administration abolished sororities three years later. In 1906 its &quot;Gamma chapter&quot; was founded at Mary Baldwin Seminary. Visitors were not allowed at the school, so the chapter charter and special instructions were delivered to the new group by mail.

In 1906, Jewel Davis entered the University of Texas at Austin as a graduate student, organized a group, and installed them as &quot;Delta chapter&quot;, the fourth chapter of Alpha Delta Phi. Jewel Davis is listed as a charter member as there was no precedent for affiliation. Today, the &quot;Delta chapter&quot; at The University of Texas at Austin is the oldest surviving chapter of Alpha Delta Pi. Between 1906 and 1912, eight more chapters were founded at various universities.

In 1913, Alpha Delta Phi officially changed its name to Alpha Delta Pi. The deliberations over this change remain largely unknown aside from the impetus of the discovery of a pre-existing men&#x27;s fraternity using those exact letters and which pre-dated the original Adelphean Society&#x27;s inception by almost 20 years. There seems to be little to no speculation as to why &quot;Pi&quot; was specifically chosen as a replacement letter, and or why it took so long to hear of the pre-existing Alpha Delta Phi fraternity. Thus in 1913, the Adelphean Society, through Convention legislation, changed the name of the organization, adopted a recognition pin, and appointed a standardization committee. The trustees at Wesleyan Female College voted to abolish sororities, leading to the closure of &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; in 1915. &quot;Chi chapter&quot;, at Wittenberg University, was the first chapter to bear the new name at installation. In 1948, Mrs. Carolee Strock Stanard retired as Grand President and part of her keynote address became &quot;The Creed of Alpha Delta Pi&quot;. In 1960, Alpha Delta Pi&#x27;s 100th chapter, &quot;Delta Omicron&quot;, was installed at East Carolina University.

In 1979, Alpha Delta Pi adopted Ronald McDonald Houses as the National Philanthropy. In 1983, Alpha Delta Pi Foundation was established. In 2001, Alpha Delta Pi celebrated its 150th anniversary in Atlanta, Georgia, and in 2006, the &quot;Delta chapter&quot;, the oldest open chapter of ADPi, celebrated its 100th anniversary at The University of Texas at Austin. In 2009, &quot;Theta Theta chapter&quot; at Quinnipiac University was installed. &quot;Theta Theta&quot; was the 200th chapter of ADPi to be installed. Chapters continue to be installed and anniversaries are celebrated at numerous university campuses.

== Symbols and publications ==
The open motto of ADPi is &quot;We Live for Each Other,&quot; and its colors are azure blue and white. To the sorority, blue is symbolic of friendship, which the sorority cites as one of its founding values; white symbolizes sincerity and truth, which are two qualities the sorority states it looks for in its members. The official flower is the woodland violet; however since woodland violets are found in the wild and not available for purchase, people often substitute the African violet. The official jewel and symbol is the diamond, which the sorority uses as a symbol of &quot;the enduring strength and value of friendship&quot;. The mascot for Alpha Delta Pi is a lion with the nickname of Alphie. Alpha Delta Pi currently has 161 chapters in the United States and Canada, with the majority concentrated in the southern United States, and over 150 alumnae associations. Its national philanthropy is the Ronald McDonald House Charities.

Elizabeth Moseley Coles, who was elected national president at the first grand convention, was responsible for having Alpha Delta Pi&#x27;s coat of arms designed. Another sister of the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;, Agnes Chapman, is given credit for the actual design of the coat of arms. Symbolism from the ritual and the Alpha pin were combined in the coat of arms, and the design originally had a background of violets. In 1919, the convention body voted to make changes and the present design was accepted.

=== Badges ===

* Badge – The first diamond-shaped badge, also known as a lozenge, was first worn by the Adelpheans in 1851. Stars were not included on this first badge, but it did have a monogram of the Wesleyan pin attached to the badge by a link chain, thus forming a guard. In 1854, the stars were added, but it was not until 1874 that the stars and the clasped hands were raised. This design remained with only slight modifications until 1906 when, at Alpha Delta Pi&#x27;s first convention, Nanaline King presented a new design for the pin. Her design was a smaller gold badge with a black enamel center which pictured the clasped hands, the two stars, and the Greek letters, Alpha Delta Phi. This design was adopted by the convention and is still in use today, except for the Greek letter Phi being changed to Pi at the 1913 convention.
* Alpha Badge – The new member badge, which is a gold pin emblazoned with a lion atop the Greek letters &quot;&quot;, is worn by new members before their initiation.

===&quot;The Adelphean&quot;===
&quot;The Adelphean&quot; is a quarterly magazine covering recent events, upcoming activities, outstanding members, and chapter news. It is a subscription for members and alumnae and promotes leadership on and off campus. &quot;The Adelphean&quot; has a partnership with Ronald McDonald House Charities and other local organizations. Its first issue was published March 12, 1907, by a select group of national Alpha Delta Pi leaders and included a collection of letters from outstanding members and updates on the expansion of the secret society. At this time, Alpha Delta Pi was still referred to as &quot;Alpha Delta Phi.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
Since 1979, Alpha Delta Pi has been committed to serving Ronald McDonald House Charities (RMHC). Throughout their partnership, Alpha Delta Pi has contributed more than $16 million to RHMC. Local RMHC Chapters operate Ronald McDonald House, Ronald McDonald Care Mobile, and Ronald McDonald Family Room programs in local communities.

== Chapters ==
Alpha Delta Pi has 161 chapters in the US and Canada.

<text>In number theory, the -th cabtaxi number, typically denoted , is defined as the smallest positive integer that can be written as the sum of two &quot;positive or negative or 0&quot; cubes in ways. Such numbers exist for all , which follows from the analogous result for taxicab numbers.

== Known cabtaxi numbers ==
Only 10 cabtaxi numbers are known :

formula_1

== History ==
Cabtaxi(2) was known to François Viète and Pietro Bongo in the late 16th century in the equivalent form formula_2. The existence of Cabtaxi(3) was known to Leonhard Euler, but its actual solution was not found until later, by Edward B. Escott in 1902.

Cabtaxi(4) through and Cabtaxi(7) were found by Randall L. Rathbun in 1992; Cabtaxi(8) was found by Daniel J. Bernstein in 1998. Cabtaxi(9) was found by Duncan Moore in 2005, using Bernstein&#x27;s method. Cabtaxi(10) was first reported as an upper bound by Christian Boyer in 2006 and verified as Cabtaxi(10) by Uwe Hollerbach and reported on the NMBRTHRY mailing list on May 16, 2008.

<doc id="678152" wikidata="Q1514118" url="?curid=678152" title="Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs">
<text>Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs was an American rock band that was part of the first wave of punk bands from the 1970s. The band was headed by Georgia-born singer Jayne County (aka Wayne County) and became known for their campy, foul-mouthed ballads, glam punk inspired songs and image which was heavily influenced by Jackie Curtis and the Theatre of the Ridiculous.

==Career==
Jayne County, then known as Wayne County, originally began performing in New York with a band called &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. This was followed by Wayne County and The Backstreet Boys as documented on Rhino&#x27;s &quot;DIY: Blank Generation&quot; compilation album with an early single: &quot;Max&#x27;s Kansas City 1976.&quot; Upon moving to London with Greg Van Cook, a member of the Backstreet Boys, she recruited a new drummer and bassist to form &quot;The Electric Chairs&quot;; a band comprising Van Cook (guitar), Val Haller (bass) and Chris Dust (drums).

Jools Holland had his first studio session with the group in 1976.

None of County&#x27;s albums were ever released in her native United States except for three songs on the very early punk compilation &quot;Max&#x27;s Kansas City&quot;.

Wayne County and the Electric Chairs were supported by the Police during their 1977 tour of Holland. Dust, a Hungarian, was deported following the band&#x27;s return to the UK when the authorities found that his visa had expired over a year before. He was replaced by John &quot;JJ&quot; Johnson, and the band recorded their first album &quot;The Electric Chairs&quot;. In order to recreate the sound of the album live the band recruited Police guitarist, Henry Padovani on rhythm guitar.

This new five-piece line-up toured extensively, but County ultimately fired Greg Van Cook due to his rampant drug abuse and replaced him with Eliot Michael, another former member of the Backstreet Boys. Producer Martin Birch exerted a great deal of creative control over the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Storm the Gates of Heaven&quot; and Padovani later commented in his memoir that the album &quot;wasn&#x27;t bad but it wasn&#x27;t the Chairs as we wanted it to be.&quot; The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Things Your Mother Never Told You&quot; was produced by David Cunningham. After a few more tours, Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs split in two, with Eliot Michael following County in her solo career. Padovani, Haller, and Johnson recorded a final single: &quot;So Many Ways&quot; as &quot;The Electric Chairs&quot; before management problems forced them to disband completely.

County played &quot;Lounge Lizard&quot; in Derek Jarman&#x27;s 1978 film &quot;Jubilee&quot;, performing &quot;Paranoia Paradise&quot; with the Electric Chairs. This track appeared on the &quot;Jubilee&quot; soundtrack album released by Polydor UK in 1978. County is featured in the 2013 film &quot;CBGB.&quot; The Wayne County and the Electric Chairs track &quot;Out of Control&quot; appears on the &quot;CBGB&quot; film soundtrack

The bootlegged &#x27;live&#x27; appearance of Wayne County &amp; the Electric Chairs in 1978 on the German TV show &quot;Rockpalast&quot; was released as a DVD/CD double pack by Repertoire Records UK in December 2014. The concert took place while the band were touring their second album &quot;Storm the Gates of Heaven&quot;&quot;.

<text>The endosperm is a tissue produced inside the seeds of most of the flowering plants following double fertilization. It is triploid (meaning three chromosome sets per nucleus) in most species, which may be auxin-driven. It surrounds the embryo and provides nutrition in the form of starch, though it can also contain oils and protein. This can make endosperm a source of nutrition in animal diet. For example, wheat endosperm is ground into flour for bread (the rest of the grain is included as well in whole wheat flour), while barley endosperm is the main source of sugars for beer production. Other examples of endosperm that forms the bulk of the edible portion are coconut &quot;meat&quot; and coconut &quot;water&quot;, and corn. Some plants, such as certain orchids, lack endosperm in their seeds.

Ancestral flowering plants have seeds with small embryos and abundant endosperm. In some modern flowering plants the embryo occupies most of the seed and the endosperm is non-developed or consumed before the seed matures. In other flowering plant taxa, the Poaceae for example, the endosperm is greatly developed. 

== Double fertilization ==

An endosperm is formed after the two sperm nuclei inside a pollen grain reach the interior of a female gametophyte or megagametophyte, also called the embryonic sac. One sperm nucleus fertilizes the egg cell, forming a zygote, while the other sperm nucleus usually fuses with the binucleate central cell, forming a primary endosperm cell (its nucleus is often called the &quot;triple fusion nucleus&quot;). That cell created in the process of double fertilization develops into the endosperm. Because it is formed by a separate fertilization event, the endosperm is a separate entity from the developing embryo, and some consider it to be a separate organism. 

About 70% of angiosperm species have endosperm cells that are polyploid. These are typically triploid (containing three sets of chromosomes), but can vary widely from diploid (2n) to 15n.

One flowering plant, &quot;Nuphar polysepala&quot;, has diploid endosperm, resulting from the fusion of a pollen nucleus with one, rather than two, maternal nuclei. The same is supposed for some other basal angiosperms. It is believed that early in the development of angiosperm lineages, there was a duplication in this mode of reproduction, producing seven-celled/eight-nucleate female gametophytes, and triploid endosperms with a 2:1 maternal to paternal genome ratio.

Double fertilisation is a characteristic feature of angiosperms.

== Endosperm development ==
There are three types of endosperm development:

Nuclear endosperm development – where repeated free-nuclear divisions take place; if a cell wall is formed it will form after free-nuclear divisions. Commonly referred to as liquid endosperm. Coconut water is an example of this.

Cellular endosperm development – where a cell-wall formation is coincident with nuclear divisions. Coconut meat is cellular endosperm. Acoraceae has cellular endosperm development while other monocots are helobial.

Helobial endosperm development – where a cell wall is laid down between the first two nuclei, after which one half develops endosperm along the cellular pattern and the other half along the nuclear pattern.

== Evolutionary origins ==
The evolutionary origins of double fertilization and endosperm are unclear, attracting researcher attention for over a century. There are the two major hypotheses:
* The double fertilization initially used to produce two identical, independent embryos (&quot;twins&quot;). Later these embryos acquired different roles, one growing into the mature organism, and another merely supporting it. Thus, the early endosperm was probably diploid, like the embryo. Some gymnosperms, such as &quot;Ephedra&quot;, may produce twin embryos by double fertilization. Either of these two embryos is capable of filling in the seed, but normally only one develops further (the other eventually aborts). Also, most basal angiosperms still contain the four-cell embryo sac and produce diploid endosperms.
* Endosperm is the evolutionary remnant of the actual gametophyte, similar to the complex multicellular gametophytes found in gymnosperms. In this case, acquisition of the additional nucleus from the sperm cell is a later evolutionary step. This nucleus may provide the parental (not only maternal) organism with some control over endosperm development. Becoming triploid or polyploid are later evolutionary steps of this &quot;primary gametophyte&quot;. Nonflowering seed plants (conifers, cycads, &quot;Ginkgo&quot;, &quot;Ephedra&quot;) form a large homozygous female gametophyte to nourish the embryo within a seed.
The triploid transition - and the production of antipodal cells - may have occurred due to a shift in gametophyte development which produced a new interaction with an auxin-dependent mechanism originating in the earliest angiosperms.

==Role in seed development==
In some groups (e.g. grains of the family Poaceae), the endosperm persists to the mature seed stage as a storage tissue, in which case the seeds are called &quot;albuminous&quot; or &quot;endospermous&quot;, and in others it is absorbed during embryo development (e.g., most members of the family Fabaceae, including the common bean, &quot;Phaseolus vulgaris&quot;), in which case the seeds are called &quot;exalbuminous&quot; or &quot;cotyledonous&quot; and the function of storage tissue is performed by enlarged cotyledons (&quot;seed leaves&quot;). In certain species (e.g. corn, &quot;Zea mays&quot;); the storage function is distributed between both endosperm and the embryo. Some mature endosperm tissue stores fats (e.g. castor bean, &quot;Ricinus communis&quot;) and others (including grains, such as wheat and corn) store mainly starches.

The dust-like seeds of orchids have no endosperm. Orchid seedlings are mycoheterotrophic in their early development. In some other species, such as coffee, the endosperm also does not develop. Instead, the nucellus produces a nutritive tissue termed &quot;perisperm&quot;. The endosperm of some species is responsible for seed dormancy. Endosperm tissue also mediates the transfer of nutrients from the mother plant to the embryo, it acts as a location for gene imprinting, and is responsible for aborting seeds produced from genetically mismatched parents. In angiosperms, the endosperm contain hormones such as cytokinins, which regulate cellular differentiation and embryonic organ formation.

==Cereal grains==

Cereal crops are grown for their edible fruit (grains or caryopses), which are primarily endosperm. In the caryopsis, the thin fruit wall is fused to the seed coat. Therefore, the nutritious part of the grain is the seed and its endosperm. In some cases (e.g. wheat, rice) the endosperm is selectively retained in food processing (commonly called white flour), and the embryo (germ) and seed coat (bran) removed. The processed grain has a lower quality of nutrition. Endosperm thus has an important role within the human diet worldwide.

The aleurone is the outer layer of endosperm cells, present in all small grains and retained in many dicots with transient endosperm. The cereal aleurone functions for both storage and digestion. During germination, it secretes the amylase enzyme that breaks down endosperm starch into sugars to nourish the growing seedling.

<doc id="678164" wikidata="Q6844597" url="?curid=678164" title="Miguel Enríquez (privateer)">
<text>&quot;D.&quot; Miguel Enríquez (c. 1674–1743), was a privateer from San Juan, Puerto Rico who operated during the early 18th century. A &quot;mulato&quot; born out of wedlock, he was a shoemaker by occupation during his youth. After working for the governor as a salesman Enríquez was recruited to defend Puerto Rico, then a colony of the Spanish Empire. He commanded a couple of &quot;guarda costas&quot;, receiving a letter of marque and reprisal from the Spanish Crown for his performance. Operating during the height of the Golden Age of Piracy, Enríquez&#x27;s fleet was also credited with controlling the proliferation of buccaneers in the region. However, he was considered a pirate himself by the merchants of other nations, since it was common practice of the government to ignore when foreign ships were attacked. Employing a systematic approach, Enríquez was able to become the most successful and influential Puerto Rican of his time and one of the most powerful men in the New World, converting San Juan into one of the best supplied and important ports in the Caribbean. 

During his years as a privateer, Enríquez established close links with the Spanish Monarchy. In the Caribbean he rallied the support of the Catholic Church, the Spanish bureaucrats and the foreign governors of St. Thomas and Curaçao. Among other tactics, he used his ships for the distribution of urgent messages that arrived at San Juan or La Aguada to the rest of the Antilles. When there was a shortage of royal vessels, Enríquez&#x27;s fleet was responsible for transporting items on behalf of Spain without charge. For this, the Crown granted him a Royal Auxiliary Identification Document (Spanish: &quot;Real Cédula Auxiliar&quot;), which allowed him to directly seek help from the Council of the Indies regardless of how insignificant a conflict was. His ships also provided transportation for the authorities that arrived at Puerto Rico en route to other locations and for Catholic missionaries. Throughout the War of the Spanish Succession, Enríquez&#x27;s fleet was responsible for guarding the Spanish West Indies from incursions by the British and Dutch. In 1717, Enríquez led an operation that expelled foreign settlers from Vieques, for which he was commended. His fleet also participated in other military expeditions in 1728 and 1729.

Enríquez received several recognitions and exemptions that facilitated his work and contributed towards his vast wealth. Under the order of King Philip V (1683–1746), he was awarded The Gold Medal of the Royal Effigy (Spanish: &quot;Medalla de oro de la Real Efigie&quot;) in 1713 and was named Capitán de Mar y Guerra y Armador de Corsos (loosely translated as Captain of the Seas and War and Chief Provider to the Crown Corsairs). His success also led to resentment and constant clashes with the white caste of San Juan, placing him at odds with most of the colonial governors assigned to Puerto Rico. By the time that Matías de Abadía arrived to La Fortaleza, Enríquez was unable to accomplish his removal from office. He was charged with smuggling and stripped of all his power and wealth by the government. Enríquez fled and took refuge in a Catholic convent. The charges of smuggling made by the authorities were eventually dropped, but he chose to remain in the premises where he died a pauper. By the time that his career was over, Enríquez had commanded a fleet of over 300 ships, of which approximately 150 were lost, employing close to 1,500 sailors.

==Early life==
Enríquez was born in San Juan to a poor family. The actual year of his birth is not clear due to contradictory dates, but the dates of 1674, 1676, 1680 and 1681 are referenced or recorded in official documents. Most of these variations were provided by Enríquez himself, who would report a younger age when questioned. Of those proposed, 1674 seems more likely. He was born to Graciana Enríquez, a freed slave of the same social hierarchy who had inherited the surname &quot;Enríquez&quot; from her former slaver, Leonor. His maternal grandmother was born in Africa, with Angola and Guinea being mentioned while his maternal grandfather was an unknown white man. The name of Enríquez&#x27;s father is not mentioned in any documentation, with the possible reasons for this being various and unexplored in the surviving records. It is possible that either the identity was truly unknown by the public or that the father was a member of the Catholic clergy, which would have prompted a &quot;silence pact&quot; to avoid a scandal. The second theory is supported by the fact that a member of the elite class, Luis de Salinas, served as the godfather of his brother, José Enríquez, despite the fact that he was also considered an illegitimate child. It seems likely that both Miguel and José shared the same father. Enríquez also possessed several sacramental objects and books written in Latin, which was a language only used by the clergy, now considered to have been inherited from his father. He was the youngest of four siblings, the others being María and Juan. José died soon after his birth, before reaching his first year. They lived in the room of a house belonging to Ana del Rincón on San Cristóbal y la Carnicería Street.

Unlike most children of the time, Enríquez was taught how to read and write at an advanced level, sufficient to compose detailed documents. His writing style was elegant and he knew cursive, implying that it was a product of extended schooling. By age 10, Enríquez had begun to work as an apprentice shoemaker. As a consequence, he also learned how to craft leather. As was the custom during this age, Enríquez was enrolled in the military at the age of 16. These units were divided by social hierarchy, with him serving under Captain Francisco Martín along other &quot;mulatos&quot;. As a shoemaker, he would only earn four and a half reales per shoe pair. Enríquez never married, but was known to have been involved with several women throughout his life, including Elena Méndez, Teresa Montañez, María Valdés and Ana Muriel. Product of these relations, he had at least eight children, among which were Vicente and Rosa. Of them, Enríquez preferred Vicente, raising him and overseeing his education .

In 1700, aged 26, he was accused of selling contraband in his house. This merchandise was product of trades where people incapable of paying with money, handed items in exchange. The governor sentenced him to a year of forced labor in Castillo San Felipe del Morro and added a fine of 100 pieces of eight. He did not deny the charges, paid the coins without any hesitation and his sentence was changed, upon his own request. Enríquez was now sentenced to serve in the artillery of the Elite Garrison Corps. According to a witness, this change was facilitated due to requests made by influential members of San Juan&#x27;s society, including some members of the Catholic Church. With his job as a shoemaker, it is unknown how he was able to afford the fine so quickly, but it is assumed that he received help. As part of the sentence, Enríquez could not charge for his work in the military, which also meant that during this timeframe he was economically supported by a third party.

==Privateering career==

===Independent work and letter of marque===
In 1701, Enríquez began working as a salesman for governor Gutiérrez de la Riva. It was under this governor that he would go on to become a privateer. Like those that preceded him, Gutiérrez was appointed due to his military experience and his inauguration coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession arriving with a direct order to evaluate the cost of building a new vessel to &quot;extinguish the commerce of [...] foreigners&quot; that had reportedly engaged in piracy and other acts that threatened the Spanish economy. Within a month, he responded with a report suggesting a system that operated between privateers and a ship to guard the coasts. Both the geopolitical environment and the economic difficulty of the colony made privateering a successful and lucrative venture, both for the individual and for the government itself. Gutiérrez proposed the construction of a new boat for the sole purpose of plundering enemy ships, with half of the loot destined to the Crown and the remainder being distributed among the crew. This initiative was accepted and by 1704 the process was underway, with the ship being completed in 1707. 

Gutiérrez needed a front man for this operation and Enríquez was eventually selected, his race allowing for a safe scapegoat if the privateering resulted in conflicts between the local government and Spain. He proved successful in this venture and within a year his role had grown. Only two years after Gutiérrez took office, Enríquez already served as the governor&#x27;s delegate and owner of vessels under his command. These first actions were done independently, albeit with the government&#x27;s compliance. However, by 1704 Enríquez was already being listed as a privateer, receiving an official letter of marque. Multiple invasion attempts by enemy countries further fueled privateering operations, the Spanish West Indies were constantly being besieged by England, Denmark and the Netherlands. The Spanish Crown did not take these threats lightly and ordered Gutiérrez to prepare for an hypothetical scenario, which ultimately proved to be a false alarm. Despite the outcome, this mentality lingered, facilitating the war acts of the privateers. A year later, England actually tried to unsuccessfully invade Puerto Rico, landing within the vicinity of Arecibo. 

With the War of Succession recuperating in the Caribbean, the actions of Enríquez were seen in a positive light. Soon afterwards, French corsairs arrived at San Juan as allies, protected by the Crown with orders to be cared for. However, these foreign vessels were being used to import contraband, which combined with a general animosity due to previous conflicts between these nations, further fueled the need to stabilize the economy by supporting local privateers. On July 23, 1703, Gutiérrez died in San Juan. Despite his connection, Enríquez was generally ignored by the members of the elite that opposed his rule and the privateering operation continued. Gutiérrez&#x27;s death brought forth a period of instability of five years, during which Puerto Rico had nine governors. This favored Enríquez, who continued to thrive in the shadows. Most of them were simply interim governors and due to their short time in office, none were able to pay any attention to his growing success. 

When Pedro del Arroyo was sworn, Enríquez tried to buy his favor by paying the voyage. However, Arroyo died shortly afterwards, preventing a notable profit from this partnership. Despite this, Enríquez actually paid for the funeral service and even provided the black clothing for the servants. Despite his distinction, the former governor was not economically stable and his family was moved into the privateer&#x27;s house. One of the late governor&#x27;s sons, Laureano Pérez del Arroyo, lived with him until his adulthood, when Enríquez requested that he was promoted to the rank of captain. In time, Pérez del Arroyo would become of his most vocal enemies. Eventually, as his wealth and influence grew Enríquez inherited some of Gutiérrez&#x27;s old enemies, including the high class Calderón family.

Constantly serving the Crown, he quickly became the top privateer in Puerto Rico. In a letter sent on February 14, 1705, the work done by two ships owned by Enríquez in the waters of Puerto Rico and Santo Domingo is praised. King Phillip V expressed satisfaction and encouraged the continuation of this labor, not without claiming the weapons captured from his victims. In 1707, Enríquez requested to be placed in charge of a company based there or in the adjacent locales of Havana or Cartagena. The War Board of the Indies ignored his request, and some members even argued that to extend his stay in Puerto Rico he should only be recognized as Captain of the Sea, instead of the higher title of Captain of the Sea and War. The authorities could not jeopardize the success attained by Enríquez&#x27;s privateering fleet, which has gathered positive feedback from the local government. However, they could not reward his efforts with a lesser title either. Following a heated debate, the Board decided to grant him the title of Captain of the Sea and War. Enríquez actually planned this outcome, organizing his local influence so that the communications that reached the Crown were largely positive. This correspondence was being sent years before this, by 1705 these letters were granting him the responsibility for controlling contraband and pirates in the coasts of Puerto Rico.

===Caballero and Captain of the Land and Seas===
With the delay or failure to arrive of the Real Situado, the governors were forced to collect money from the wealthier residents to make do. Enríquez loaned money to the government since 1705 and noted this when issuing his requests. He was officially recognized as Captain of the Sea and War on July 11, 1710. By then Enríquez had become notably active in defending both Puerto Rico and the other Spanish interests in the Caribbean. His privateering fleet had become such a key to local stability that they were the ones responsible for safeguarding the residents when storms or famine struck the island. By 1708, Enríquez had become a renowned man, gaining the attention of Phillip V himself due to his work. That same year, one of his ships brought the loot of a British vessel captured off Tortola to the port of Cumaná. The authorities forced the privateers to sell the cargo in their port and retained two thirds of the earnings. Enríquez was angered by this development and contacted the king, who responded by ordering a full restitution. He became the colonial government&#x27;s main creditor, lending it the sum of 11,497 pieces of eight between 1708 and 1712. 

After five years of instability, the Crown appointed a sailor and merchant named Francisco Danío Granados as governor of Puerto Rico. It is possible that Enríquez already knew him through Gutiérrez, who purchased merchandise from his company. Like those that preceded him, Danío wanted to quickly gain a profit. As a dominant local merchant, this appointment would normally threaten Enríquez, but it seems likely that he was involved to some degree in the election process. He went on to donate 4,000 pieces of eight before Danío&#x27; was sworn into office and provided an additional sum of 300 as a gift. Two months before the new governor took office, the vessel ordered during Gutiérrez&#x27;s term docked at San Juan. Initially, the governor tried to run the privateering in the island by himself, but faced issues recruiting personnel and ultimately formed a mutually beneficial partnership with Enríquez.

In 1712, Danío wrote to Phillip V requesting a recognition for the privateer&#x27;s achievements. The king consulted the Council of the Indies, which proposed that Enríquez should receive the Medal of the Royal Effigy (Spanish: &quot;Medalla de la Real Efigie&quot;) which knighted him as a Caballero of Spain. The award was officially presented on March 12, 1712. This awoke the ire of the higher classes, who could not fathom how a &quot;mulato&quot; could receive such a recognition. Enríquez was the first Puerto Rican presented with this distinction and also received the honorific of Don. From this point onwards, this title preceded his name in any official documentation. However, his adversaries intentionally avoided employing the honorific. The following year, Enríquez was granted a Royal Auxiliary Identification Document, which allowed him to overcome the arbitrary restrictions that he encountered in some Caribbean ports. This rare privilege shielded him from the authorities of the other Spanish colonies, redirecting any conflict to the tribunal of the Council of the Indies. By the end of his five-year term, Danío had earned 55,179 pieces of eight, more than five times the amount that he would have earned by solely fulfilling his office.

===Silver shortage and feud with Ribera===
On July 18, 1711, Juan de Ribera was appointed as governor by the king, but he could only take office when his predecessor&#x27;s term was over. Prior to arriving to Puerto Rico, Ribera and Enríquez exchanged friendly letters. The privateer lowered his guard, expecting to have a productive relation with the future governor. While exchanging letters, Enríquez spent over 20,000 pieces of eight as gifts and other considerations and even lent his best vessel, &quot;La Gloria&quot;, so that Ribera could arrive. He also made sure that La Fortaleza was fitted with supplies to last several months. Ribera arrived to San Juan on December 23, 1713, replacing Danío. Enríquez was confident that with his previous actions he had gained the governor&#x27;s favor, but noticing that his ship arrived fully loaded likely offered an early warning that the functionary actually intended to compete with him. Ribera had manipulated the privateer, projecting a benign posture to avoid waking any suspicion. Having spent the two years after being appointed in the adjacent Cumaná and Margarita, the governor had observed the models used in the Americas and established connections, also becoming familiar with Enríquez&#x27;s own modus operandi. 

Shortly after taking office, Ribera attempted to eradicate privateering from Puerto Rico for his own benefit. He quickly employed his connections in attempts to take over Enríquez&#x27;s market. After completing his first term, Danío left his entire fortune in charge of Enríquez, while he returned to Spain. They agreed that the money would be sent there when needed. However, the arrangement was difficult, since the money was filtered by small quantities or failed to arrive at all. Ribera would employ the privateer&#x27;s own model against him, mimicking several of his tactics, albeit in a more aggressive fashion. Considering Enríquez a direct adversary, the governor intercepted his mail and took over profitable associations.

Ribera systematically stripped Enríquez of his belongings, also launching a campaign to discredit him among Spanish merchants. The governor took control of the shipyard and used it to construct a sloop, a brigantine and a schooner. The animosity between both was fueled by the fact that no side was willing to recognize the authority granted to the other. On one occasion the governor asked him to certify (on behalf of the Royal Guinea Company) that a ship had not returned, after it arrived from Saint Thomas loaded with an illegal haul, but Enríquez refused to commit fraud. Due to the pressure involved, he was ultimately forced to do so. However, Enríquez visited the Secretary of Government, who served as a witness of the act. The same occurred later with a ship that arrived from Trinidad, but this time he firmly refused, claiming that he was willing to risk his life if that meant conserving his honor.

During this administration, a new treasurer was appointed to Puerto Rico, José del Pozo Oneto. Enríquez had tried to win the functionary&#x27;s favor when he arrived, providing slaves and several other gifts. The first year of his incumbency was nominal, however, in early 1717 a series of conflicts between them became apparent. According to a witness account, these differences began when Enríquez refused to loan 4,000 pieces of eight that Pozo wanted for personal matters. Another factor could have been that the treasurer owned several stores in San Juan and was competing with the privateer in auctions. Eventually, Pozo sided with another man that was battling to gain power, dean Martín Calderón. Throughout Ribera&#x27;s term, the elite class of San Juan launched a disparaging campaign, offended by the fact that a &quot;mulato&quot; had essentially become the most influential figure in Puerto Rico. They would constantly address the Spanish Crown and accused him of smuggling, a notable concern during the era, or attempted to disregard his privateering skills. The high class group that led the campaign was the Calderón family, to which the dean belonged. 

It is likely that these differences materialized years before, but that these groups were simply waiting for the opportune moment to act on them. Despite their status, the Calderón family was notorious for being involved with contraband and Ribera allied with them to pursue his own goals. The family even employed the influence of one of his members to create divisions between Enríquez and the newly arrived bishop Pedro de la Concepción Urtiaga. He was able to counter these accusations following the arrival of a prelate that favored him, neutralizing their influence. With the Calderón family on his side, Ribera decided to ignore all of the remaining families due to internal divisions. The governor went as far as eliminating any group that may threaten his intentions of creating a commercial monopoly, grounding Enríquez’s fleet by denying permits and trying to enter the business himself. The bishop quickly took notice and denounced these actions, avoiding the mail interception of the government. After briefly considering a relocation to Santo Domingo, Enríquez launched a counterattack. He proposed to the local authorities that they should speak on his behalf, accomplishing this through several figures, including Danío. 

Ribera was accused of creating a contraband bank before the king, while accountant Antonio Paris Negro highlighted Enríquez&#x27;s work. Frequent letters began to tip the balance in the privateer&#x27;s favor, but time favored the governor. Based on this, Enríquez granted Danío the rights to serve as his extra-official representative and provided him a vessel in which to travel to Madrid. Ribera attempted and failed to block the voyage, but succeeded in stalling it and forcing an additional scale. Once there, Danío acted to expose Ribera and pursued a return to office. Locally, Enríquez convinced functionaries to send complaints devised by himself while portraying them as being personal. Paris Negro was a prominent member of this initiative. Furthermore, these letters were used to also accuse the Calderón family. During the final months of 1715, the Council of the Indies was investigating Ribera, confirming that some of the complaints were real. As a result, Francisco Fernández del Barco was assigned to evaluate his administration. 

Ribera&#x27;s anti-privateering politics were abolished. A few days after, Fernández issued two documents that secretly prepared the governor&#x27;s eventually deposition. The first was sent to the governor of Cumaná, José Carreño, and requested that he travel to Puerto Rico and execute the confiscation of Rivera&#x27;s property and interests with the help of local authorities which was done on May 3, 1716. The governor was then to be held captive at La Fortaleza, without communication separated from any allies, being then transferred to a jail. The second letter restituted all of the property that Ribera had stripped from Enríquez. The prosecution was swift, only two months later Fernández arrived to San Juan, taking control of the charges. Carreño took the office temporally, until the appointed interim governor arrived. Ribera and his associates were charged with contraband and monopolizing the market, falsely gathering money for causes that never materialized and of exploiting the Situado, among other things. He was sentenced to pay 40,317 pieces of eight and he was forced to pay an additional sum of 86,370 to Enríquez. Afterwards, Ribera remained imprisoned in Castillo San Felipe del Morro until a frigate named &quot;La Reina&quot; arrived to take him to Spain. After only serving nearly two years, the former governor was returned to Spain in chains.

===Acquiring unparalleled wealth===
In 1716, Enríquez made a suggestion to Carreño that they organize an expedition and take the island of Saint Thomas. The interim governor sent an official proposal and noted his belief that the privateer and 500 militiamen would suffice and that no royal investment would be needed, but ultimately desisted of the idea after the project failed to gain approval. Alberto Bertolano took the office of governor from Carreño, being sworn on August 30, 1716. As usual, Enríquez tried to earn his favor. However, due to his role as interim governor, Bertolano distanced himself from any of the groups that dominated the Puerto Rican society. This approach did not please Enríquez, who went on to claim that his opponents, led by Pozo, were being favored. An argument that was repeated back by them. However, the governor was instrumental in helping Enríquez to resume his role as a privateer. 

The proprietary restrictions brought forth by the War of the Quadruple Alliance led to Pozo and dean Martín Calderón requesting an ecclesiastical investigation into the privateer&#x27;s assets that ended with the Bishop of San Juan siding with Enríquez. Afterwards, both sides continued to perpetually exchange accusations and insults. Despite running a generally neutral administration, Bertolano was accused of being biased by both sides after his term concluded. In 1720, the conflict with Pozo continued, when the treasurer noticed that Enríquez owed 2,986 pieces of eight in taxes he denounced it. The Council of the Indies executed a secret investigation of the privateer, based on these allegations. His years of loyalty to the Crown had been ignored by the king himself. However, the process was delayed. Prior to this, Pozo had been even able to secure that his allies won the 1719 municipal elections, running a smear campaign against Enríquez to get them elected. The process was plagued by irregularities, with viable voters being arbitrarily disqualified beforehand.

===Second term of Danío===
On October 12, 1717, the Spanish Crown granted Danío a second term as governor of Puerto Rico. This was a goal that he and Enríquez had originally planned since the end of his first administration. However, with time the privateer lost interest, feeling that it was no longer necessary to secure his goals. Danío did not take the office immediately since he was ordered to gather and equip a hundred soldiers that would accompany him. The enemies of Enríquez panicked, fearing that the privateer would possess the support of the governor, bishop and accountant. They soon launched an aggressive defamation campaign to revoke this appointment and seized as much control as they could before his arrival. However, their initiative failed. Enríquez and Danío had remained close following the first term, with one of his nephews receiving his education along Vicente. However, the irregularity in the fulfillment of their previous agreement took a toll. Knowing this, Enríquez quickly tried to once again earn his favor through letters, directly accusing his adversaries of the breach of their accord. 

Danío arrived to San Juan on April 6, 1720, and was immediately received by a belligerent Pozo, who told him that the privateers&#x27; enemies were now his own. During the first months of this term, the governor actually persecuted this group. Enríquez thrived, his fleet capturing four vessels, two from the Netherlands and one from Great Britain and France apiece. Soon after, Danío began a trial of residence that seized the properties of Pozo, who had since gathered a considerable fortune. The former treasurer was also jailed and permanently vanished from the New World. Furthermore, Danío also managed to acquire ecclesiastic censorship from Valvidia, who threatened his allies with eternal damnation. Twelve residents soon revealed the places were Pozo has hidden part of his wealth. The governor used the law as his weapon, who sentenced the other involved to pay a fine of 1,601 pieces of eight and banned them from serving in a public office for a period of ten years. Some were even banished from San Juan. 

Those affected quickly countered by sending letters to the Crown, which responded by ordering the excarteration of Pozo, allowing him to present his case in Spain. However, before the former treasurer could do that, he found himself involved in the secret investigation that was being done against Enríquez. Due to the large number of accusations offered by each side, the Council of the Indies suspected both. Judge Tomás Férnandez Pérez was placed in charge and arrived to San Juan in 1721. Danío was also involved due to his friendship with the privateer and he was ordered to cooperate with the investigation by leaving San Juan while it was underway. Fernández began by interrogating 21 of Enríquez&#x27;s enemies, who offered the same arguments. Once the judge heard all of their versions, he determined that they were merely motivated by their desire to punish the privateer. The blame fell on Pozo and Francisco de Allende, with the entire group being jailed.

Enríquez expected to emerge stronger from this process, however, his relationship with Danío quickly took a turn for the worst. It is likely that the governor felt that the privateer was not willing to cooperate or help him during the investigation. The remainder of Enríquez&#x27;s enemies may have noticed this and pursued his favor, leaving Pozo and his faction alone. During the course of the trial, the animosity between Danío and the privateer became evident. The residents of San Juan were surprised, being familiar with their prior affinity. None of them publicly declared the reason for the conflicts due to the contentious nature of the actions done during their partnership. Under these circumstances, Enríquez found himself in a familiar position. Danío&#x27;s first attempt to challenge this dominance was timid, he fomented more &quot;guarda costas&quot; and facilitated the emergence of new privateers. Among them there was Miguel de Ubides, a vocal critic of Enríquez, who received the authorization to purchase a ship from the governor of Margarita. Upon learning of this, the privateer quickly moved his connections. Enríquez wrote to the governor of Margarita and requested that the ship was not sold to anyone from Puerto Rico. Valvidia, who was also the bishop of Margarita, also interceded in his favor. When Ubides arrived, he was told that the ship was no longer for sale. He received the same response in the ports of Cumaná and La Guaira. 

When two slaves were involved in an incident, they were imprisoned in Enríquez&#x27;s private jail for a period of four months, until Danío ordered their release to antagonize him. The governor also ordered the incarceration of Enríquez in Castillo San Felipe del Morro for cheering posters where the images of several powerful figures were satirized. He did not deny these accusations, instead simply responding that celebrating their use did not damage anyone. Meanwhile, the governors of Margarita and Cumaná also helped the privateers by issuing licenses of their own, which resulted at least in the capture of a British vessel. Enríquez continued to perform favors for the Royal authorities, fixing their ship in his private shipyard and serving as a ferry for a variety of government and Church officials.

Later that year, Enríquez fell victim to two embargoes, where his properties remained confiscated until 1724. However, the authorities were only able to seize what was registered in his name, with neither jewels or coins being listed in the official forms. It is assumed that he hid this portion of his fortune where they could not retrieve it, but despite this, what remained was enough to make him the single wealthiest man in Puerto Rico. In 1722, Enríquez alleged in a letter to the Spanish Crown that since his return Danío had only pursued the appropriation of his fortune and done corrupt actions that led to losses in his privateering ventures. These accusations were backed by Valdivia and Paris. However, the governor was likely simply trying to recover the wealth that he had left in charge of the privateer years before. Enríquez tried to bring an end to the conflict by offering a sum between 15,000 and 20,000 pieces of eight to Danío. However, this offering was declined. Furthermore, both could never agree on the amount of money that was owed due to their previous arrangement, with the governor claiming that it was 42,261 pieces of eight, but the privateer rebuffing that it was a shared debt and that the fortune was spent in critical investments. 

In a letter addressed to the king, Enríquez claimed that he possessed a document stating that he was actually the creditor of the governor&#x27;s fortune and as such owned nothing. This infuriated Danío, who ordered his incarceration on December 9, 1722. Antonio Camino, was also jailed but soon escaped and traveled to Havana. Once there, he began collecting positive accounts for his employer. Among those that agreed to help were a group of military officials that had been neglected by Danío in October 1720, only to be fully attended by Enríquez. After gathering the support, Camino traveled to Spain where he spoke in the privateer&#x27;s behalf for over a year. Valdivia tried to request an excarceration with external help, but Enríquez remained in jail. The relationship between the Church functionary and the privateer had been criticized by Danío. The governor tried to restart the official privateering project by himself, meeting moderate success by mimicking the pirate code&#x27;s repartition of the loot captured. They captured three vessels, two from France and Great Britain and a third one sailed by freebooters.

In Spain, Camino&#x27;s testimony gained the attention of the Council of the Indies which suggested to the king that Danío was investigated and that a new governor should be named to eventually replace him. Phillip V named José Antonio de Isasi . The Council also requested the liberation of Enríquez and the restitution of his property. However, this failed to materialize since Isasi remained in Spain for nearly a year after his appointment and by 1724 he surrendered the nomination. The Council named Captain José Antonio de Mendizábal as his replacement. While preparing, the military officer received strict orders to jail Danío and liberate Enríquez as soon as he arrived to San Juan. As usual, the privateer also took the initiative to gain his favor. On August 23, 1724, Mendizábal took the office of governor and only six days afterwards he ordered the incarceration of his predecessor. In the end, Enríquez succeeded in bringing an end to Danío&#x27;s second term.

The former governor suffered the same fate as Juan de Ribera, being incarcerated in the dungeon of a military fort. However, Danío&#x27;s case dragged on for a prolonged time period, forcing him to remain captive in San Felipe del Morro until at least 1730. The former governor was subsequently transported to Madrid, where he remained in jail. Enríquez provided transport to Danío&#x27;s prosecutor, Simón Belenguer so he could return to Spain, but was unable to gain his favor. This functionary criticized all of the involved and even argued that the privateer&#x27;s actions were more akin to a pirate than to a military officer. However, Belenguer placed most of the blame on Enríquez and issued harsher sentences to his allies that to his enemies. Dean Martín Calderon and Pozo were declared free of guilt. To justify his actions, Mendizábal conducted his own investigation. During this process, even the former allies of Danío testified against him.

===Later years===
Following Danío&#x27;s trial, Enríquez received full support from Mendizábal. The governor largely ignored Balaguer&#x27;s sentence. The Mendizábal administration became the most tranquil time period in Enríquez&#x27;s career. In Spain, Phillip V was briefly replaced by Louis I, only to return to the Crown. The king quickly introduced a new politic that focused on Spain &#x27;s superiority in the Atlantic. This created a new rift between the Empire and Great Britain, which directly benefited Enríquez. The First Secretary of State, José Patiño, decided that the privateer&#x27;s fleet would be employed towards this end. This functionary archived all the complaints issued by his enemies, dismissing the efficiency of their work. Enríquez&#x27;s fleet defended the local trade, a difficult mission due to the proximity of Saint Thomas to Puerto Rico. During the summer of 1728, he was forced to attend a local enemy. Captain Isidro Álvarez de Nava and other members of the military were plotting to assassinate Mendizábal and the privateer. Word of this reached the governor on June 26, 1728, but was largely ignored. 

Álvarez was the most experienced military captain and would take the office of governor in case of death. He was also related to Fernando de Allende, who insisted that if Enríquez survived, the assassination would fail in turning the balance of power. Two unsuccessful attempts were organized against the privateer. A subsequent confession, offering full detail of the plot, put an end to it. The conspirators vehemently denied these accusations, claiming that Enríquez was framing them. The governor negotiated with the soldiers and convinced them to submit to a temporary sentence in Castillo San Felipe del Morro. Afterwards, Álvarez was released and continued his defense at Madrid. With his vessels playing a key role to secure Spain&#x27;s dominance over Great Britain during the Anglo-Spanish War, Enríquez made a bold request for a &quot;mulato&quot;, asking Patiño to help him reach the rank of Royal Admiral. The secretary never answered this petition. The actions of Enríquez soon gained notoriety among the merchants affiliated to the South Sea Company, who gave him the nickname &quot;The Grand Archvillain&quot;. One of them once described him by saying &quot;[Enríquez] has raised himself to be in effect King, at least more than Governor of Porto Rico (sic)&quot;.

Mendizábal&#x27;s cooperation benefited both his business and his military influence, and the governor went as far as employing politics to favor him. On one night, a group of 23 slaves escaped from El Plantaje and were joined by some employees from his shipyard. Consequently in May 1728, Enríquez ordered two of his ships to go to Saint Thomas to reclaim the slaves that had escaped. He also ordered that if this could not be accomplished, they should go to the San Juan cays and capture as many as possible, which they did and returned with 24 slaves. Taking notice, Mendizábal requested a treaty with Denmark that allowed the return or replacement of slaves that escaped between Puerto Rico and Saint Thomas. Despite being fully invested in the war effort, Enríquez also continued to serve the Crown in other aspects. His fleet was forced to secure the arrival of Cumaná&#x27;s Situado, evading a British squadron. Enríquez also continued providing transport to the authorities and even some civilians. That same year, he sent Camino to Havana in order to complete a task. However, Enríquez&#x27;s confidant failed when he lost the relevant documentation, losing to a local privateer and costing a significant amount of money. The privateer was angered by this development, Camino responded by reclaiming payment for his entire career and threatened that he would travel to Spain seeking retribution. Enríquez&#x27;s enemies considered this an opportunity to give credibility to their allegations.

However, as years went by the number of captured vessels became consistently smaller due to Spain&#x27;s shifting its focus to the Mediterranean. Enríquez also lost his influence within the Church with the arrival of a new bishop, Sebastián Lorenzo Pizarro, who declined any gift or favor that he offered. After the war ended, the Empire&#x27;s relation with Great Britain normalized, further complicating this venture. Under these circumstances, the work of Enríquez served as an obstacle and by 1731, Mendizábal&#x27;s last year in office, he was no longer considered a key asset in the New Word.
The sudden change in geopolitics combined with conclusion of Mendizábal&#x27;s term began a downward spiral for Enríquez&#x27;s life. On October 11, 1731, Matías de Abadía docked at San Juan and took office a few hours later. A military officer, he was accompanied by three trusted men, who were quickly placed in the pivotal offices of treasurer of Puerto Rico, overseer and manager of the city. Even before traveling to San Juan, the governor had orders to settle the constant conflicts between its residents. Abadía was also placed in charge of attending Camino&#x27;s case against Enríquez and of investigating the assassination attempts. Following his intervention, the cases of Danío and Álvarez were suddenly re-evaluated by the Council of the Indies and Enríquez was forced to pay 4,000 pieces of eight to the former governor, despite the fact that the investigation had already been closed. Álvarez was also released and reinstated in his military position, with the privateer being forced to pay again. 

The influence that Enríquez once possessed was now wavering and he was likely being held accountable for the incidents of the previous decades. His enemies exploited this and bishop Pizarro aligned himself with the governor, only contacting the privateer to order the use of his vessels for transportation. The fact that Spain needed a scapegoat to appease the British government complicated his position. His privateering venture systematically shrunk, until his last ship was decommissioned by the governor. Furthermore, knowing the lucrative nature of the practice, Abadía employed front men that worked as privateers for him. Eventually, he decided to abandon privateering altogether. During the following years, Abadía used his position to bolster several credit claims against, Enríquez, which eventually ended with the governor ordering a complete embargo. In 1734, the privateer filed a complaint stating that Abadía was prohibiting him from using the title of Caballero of the Royal Effigy and requesting a confirmation of said title. The Council of the Indies preferred to ignore the request, instead telling him to show the relevant medal to the governor. 

That same year, Abadía judged the Mendizábal administration and ordered the incarceration of the former governor, basing his entire case on the complaints of Pozo. Enríquez was also involved in the prosecution, which focused on his supposed debts. He tried to provide his own documentation, but the governor declined. In May 1735, Vicente died, filling the former privateer with guilt. Attempting to escape the administration of Abadía, Enríquez took refuge in the Convent of Santo Tomás on October 30, 1735. He remained there after hearing rumors that he was going to be jailed at Castillo San Felipe del Morro. However, even there the governor pursued him. Abadía requested permission to obtain a search warrant and check if Enríquez had taken any wealth there. All of the rooms were rummaged, but nothing of worth was found. Despite this, Abadía confiscated Enríquez&#x27;s correspondence. Incredulous, the former privateer requested a certification for the search warrant. Between 1735 and 1737, Enríquez wrote to Phillip V six times requesting an independent prosecutor that could launch a neutral investigation. He also offered to reorganize the now scattered privateers. However, the king never replied directly and the only response, issued by the Council of the Indies, informed him that they did not consider that action convenient. From that moment onwards, Enríquez only wrote to detail his misery and to request the payment of an old debt. 

During the following years, his only contact to the outside world was through the Dominican friars. To Enríquez&#x27;s chagrin, Abadía had unusual longevity in the office of governor, with the Crown granting him time beyond the stipulated five years. In 1740, the Council of the Indies revised Mendizábal&#x27;s case and issued a declaration restoring his honor and rank. However, they never did the same for Enríquez, despite being charged as a supposed accomplice of the former governor. Most of his friend eventually left, only Paris and the members of the Church remained besides him. On June 29, 1743, Abadía died while still in office. Five months afterwards, Enríquez died a sudden death. After receiving the Extreme Unction, his body was laid to rest in a mass grave as a charity, since he was penniless and nobody paid for a burial. Only Paris and Rosa Enríquez, his unrecognized daughter who would later claim that he had been poisoned, mourned his death.

===Academic research===

With its goal finally accomplished, the high class of San Juan did its part to erase Enríquez&#x27;s presence from the collective memory of Puerto Rico. His loyalty to the Crown was also ignored by the same authorities that he fervently served in life and his role in history eventually faded from the records. Throughout the following centuries Enríquez&#x27;s work became fragmented, with the bulk remaining obscure. Locally, authors Salvador Brau, Arturo Morales Carrión and José Luis González played a role introducing him to Puerto Rican literature, while his figure was established within the education system by 1922&#x27;s &quot;Historia de Puerto Rico&quot;. Internationally, the early accounts of his life reflect their source, with British versions depicting him as a pirate while the Spanish ones describe his accomplishments. An example was published in 1940 by historian Jean O. McLachlan who lived in British India, who after revising the declarations of the South Sea Company&#x27;s factors concluded that Enríquez &quot;[should have been] the most famous of the &quot;guarda costas&quot;&quot; and that he &quot;may have been a desperado&quot;. McLachlan contends that Enríquez was an ex-slave who got his fortune by &quot;betraying a gentleman to the Inquisition&quot; and used this to become a privateer. He then further goes on to claim that Enríquez was &quot;given a gold medal and the title of Don […] as a result of giving presents to the royal officials and even to His Catholic Majesty&quot;. A direct contrast is established in the eleventh volume of &quot;Historia general de España y América&quot;, a collaboration written by several professors of the University of Córdoba and the University of Seville detailing the history of Spain, which asserts that &quot;[of] all the Spanish corsairs, the most accomplished one was the Puerto Rican Miguel Henríquez&quot;, whom they describe as a &quot;famous and feared […] mythological figure in the Caribbean&quot; during his lifetime.

A more systematic approach was taken by Vegan historian Ángel López Cantós, who studied Enríquez&#x27;s life and whereabouts for decades. The process of rediscovering the privateer&#x27;s past took several years of research, during which his life&#x27;s work was slowly retrieved from the contemporary documents that survive in the General Archive of the Indies. Afterwards, López published several books based on his examination, including two biographies, a novel titled &quot;Mi Tío, Miguel Enríquez&quot; (lit. &quot;My uncle, Miguel Enríquez&quot;) and the historical compilation &quot;Historia y poesía en la vida de Miguel Enríquez&quot; (lit. &quot;History and poetry in the life of Miguel Enríquez&quot;). In 2011, professor Milagros Denis Rosario of City University of New York published a socio-historical analysis for Universidad del Norte, where the role that race played in the recognition of those involved in fending off the 1797 British attack of San Juan was examined, as part of its thesis the document discussed the role and background of similar individuals in the Military history of Puerto Rico. Among the issues explored were the circumstances of Enríquez&#x27;s downfall, which are discussed within the framework set by López Cantós and Brau, leading to the author&#x27;s conclusion that the backlash of the higher classes &quot;represents a clear example of how the [18th century] Puerto Rican society was not ready to accept this kind of individual.&quot;

In her doctoral dissertation in psychology, Miriam Biascoechea Pereda argues that Enríquez is the first recorded instance of an &quot;incipient national identity&quot; among locals, emphasizing that he acted on behalf of &quot;his people [so they] could survive in lieu of Spain&#x27;s blatant neglect of this forlorn colony.&quot; This author states that the &quot;Puerto Rican nation was born with a Mulatto and Caribbean flair&quot; due to his &quot;powerful and influential personality&quot; which &quot;was feared by all, even by the Spanish Monarch, for his bravery and might.&quot;

===Presence in arts and media===
Despite the success of his career, the presence of Enríquez in modern Puerto Rican culture has been eclipsed by his clandestine counterpart, Roberto Cofresí. However, this process of romanticization began during the 20th century. Teacher, journalist and writer Enrique A. Laguerre wrote a novel dedicated to his memory, titled &quot;Miguel Enríquez: Proa libre sobre mar gruesa&quot; (lit. &quot;Miguel Enríquez, free life in a heavy sea&quot;). Enríquez, who became the wealthiest man on the archipelago during the first half of the 18th century, is now considered to have been the first Puerto Rican economic force and entrepreneur. Historian and author Federico Ribes Tovar considered him a &quot;financial genius&quot;. Proposals to name a large cargo transport ship after him have been pursued, but with no success so far. In 2010 the ruins of a chapel that he built within El Plantaje in 1735, named Ermita de Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, was recognized as an historic monument by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico.

Though the examples remain scarce, Enríquez has inspired other kinds of media. In 2007, the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture published a series of comic books named ICePé.cómic, with the 12th volume being &quot;Miguel Enríquez, corsario puertorriqueño&quot; (lit. &quot;Miguel Enríquez, Puerto Rican corsair&quot;). In 2016, Raúl Ríos Díaz published the eponymous short documentary &quot;Miguel Enríquez&quot;, which combined his own research with Cantós&#x27; previous work, later winning a Gold Peer Award for best direction and the public preference vote at the San Juan Fine Arts Film Festival. As part of the Ibero-American branch of promotion for &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed IV: Black Flag&quot;, Ubisoft published an &quot;affinity test&quot; that allowed players to gauge their relation to certain historical figures, among whom was Enríquez, who was listed under both variants of his name. He was played by actor Modesto Lacén in the San Juan National Historic Site/Northern Light Productions documentary &quot;El legado de una Isla: Las fortificaciones del Viejo San Juan&quot; which debuted on March 7, 2017.

In 2021, painter Antonio Martorell unveiled an acrylic piece titled &quot;Don Miguel Enríquez (Corsario del rey)&quot; as part of his &quot;Entretelas Familiares&quot; series, depicting the corsair in full military uniform while a scene involving a sloop and schooner sailing at sea develops in the background. This exhibit illustrated seventy-six portraits dealing with family, friendship and societal dynamics at large and was featured at the Museo de las Américas in Old San Juan until September 2022.

<doc id="678198" wikidata="Q5525391" url="?curid=678198" title="Gary Kremen">
<text>Gary Kremen (born 20 September 1963) is an American engineer, entrepreneur and politician who founded the personals site Match.com, was the first registrant of Sex.com and founder of Clean Power Finance, and was a board member of the Santa Clara Valley Water District from 2014 through 2022. Since 1993, Kremen has been a private and angel investor in over 100 companies (individually or through venture capital funds), of which several have gone public or had liquidity events.

==Early life==
Born in Chicago and raised in a Jewish household in nearby Lincolnwood, Illinois, Kremen graduated from Niles West High School in 1981. He then graduated with bachelor&#x27;s degrees in electrical engineering and computer science from Northwestern University in 1985 and an MBA from Stanford University in 1989.

==Business career==
Kremen launched the software firm Los Altos Technology and headed the company until late 1992.

In 1993, Kremen founded Match.com. Funded by private investors in November 1994, he launched the online personals service Match.com in April 1995. After troubles with venture capitalists over his insistence that the company serve profitable alternative market segments including the LGBT market, he left Match.com in March 1996, remaining on the board. Over Kremen&#x27;s objections, Match.com was sold to Cendant Corporation for $7 million in 1998 and sold by Cendant to Ticketmaster a year and a half later for $50 million.

From 1995 to 1996, Kremen co-founded and served as president of NetAngels.com, Inc., an Internet profiling and personalization company that suggested web sites to users. It merged with Firefly Networks, and then was sold to Microsoft.

In 1999, Kremen was listed as an equity-holding officer or director of Brightcube, Inc. The same year, he sold Computer.com for $500,000.

Kremen is credited as a primary inventor on a 1995-filed patent for dynamic web pages, US patent number 5,706,434, which he later sold for over $1,000,000. Additionally, Kremen holds two other patents in financial-related systems management: US patent number 7,698,219 and US patent number 7,890,436. and a patent for verifying employment online: United States Patent number 8,533,110.

A 2007 &quot;New York Times&quot; article on &quot;millionaires who don&#x27;t feel rich&quot; reported that Kremen estimated his net worth at $10 million.

Kremen is the founder of residential solar financing start-up Clean Power Finance, Inc., which raised $6.9 million from investors in January 2010, $25 million from Kleiner Perkins, $75 million from Google in September 2011, and $62 million from other investors.

He was also founder and chairman of Sociogramics, a financial services company that focuses on bringing credit to the underbanked, having raised seed capital from Tugboat Ventures, Harmony Venture Partners, Trinity Ventures, Greylock Partners, Claremont Creek Ventures, and QED Investors.

Kremen is the founding investor and a board member of CrowdFlower, WaterSmart Software and CapGain Solutions as well as involved with local non-profit organizations. 
He is also a co-founder of Menlo Incubator, which is an early-stage startup program that focuses heavily on mentorship and Cross Coin Ventures. On February 24, 2014, Identiv appointed him a member of the Board of Directors.

Kremen is a University of California, Merced foundation board member. He is also a board member of the nonprofit Saline Preservation Association.

== Political career ==

Kremen was an elected board member and president of the local Purissima Hills Water District from 2010-2014. Kremen&#x27;s romantic partner Essy Stone now serves on that board. Kremen was appointed to the Proposition 39 Citizens Oversight Board by California State Controller John Chiang in January 2014. 

Kremen was elected to the Santa Clara Valley Water District Board of Directors in the 2014 election, after spending $479,000 on the election for a job that paid $53,626.74, described as &quot;stunning...for a water board election&quot;. On January 13, 2015, the Board elected him as the 2015 Board Chair. He was re-elected in 2018 after spending only about $10,000 on his campaign. In 2022, he cast a key vote in a 4-3 decision to put a &quot;deliberately misleading&quot; initiative on the ballot, which claimed to be imposing term limits on the Water Board, but which actually lengthened the existing (and unmentioned) term limits. The vote cost the water board&#x27;s taxpayers $3.2 million dollars, and barely passed with 50.56% of the public vote. This initiative extended Kremen&#x27;s own term as well as the terms of board members who had been there for 26 and 22 years, with salaries and benefits up to $79,000 per year for the part-time job.

Kremen was at some point appointed by the Water Board to The Delta Conveyance Design and Construction Joint Powers Authority.

He ran for the political job of Santa Clara County Assessor in 2021 and 2022, seeking to unseat 27-year incumbent Larry Stone. After contributing $170,000 of his own money, and raising another $71,000 from others, he dropped his campaign in February 2022 after getting into conflict with a campaign staffer, who resigned and took her complaints public. He asked a staffer to sift through a large photo dump, looking for photos useful to the campaign, but the staffer stopped and was outraged when she saw pictures which included Kremen&#x27;s breastfeeding romantic partner with one breast visible. The partner, Essy Stone, reportedly said, &quot;He was just being careless, there’s nothing malicious about it.&quot; But there were other accusations, including bullying, campaigning as a nonprofit, and a threat to harm a Democratic club that planned a Middle East resolution that Kremen opposed. Multiple local politicians rapidly and publicly called on Kremen to step down, leading to him ending the campaign. In addition, the resulting attention revealed 11 internal complaints from Water Board employees, causing Kremen to step down as Water Board Chair, while retaining his board seat. An internal investigation followed.

==Sex.com legal case==

Kremen first registered the domain name &quot;sex.com&quot; in 1994 as well as jobs.com, housing.com, and autos.com. In 1995, Stephen M. Cohen contacted Network Solutions and fraudulently had the domain transferred to his name. Kremen sued Cohen for the return of the sex.com domain name. As Cohen had profited from sex.com while assigned to him, Kremen was awarded a judgment of $65 million against Cohen. Cohen fled to Mexico and moved the money offshore. Kremen obtained Cohen&#x27;s Rancho Santa Fe mansion, to which he relocated after the court case resolved. In 2003, Kremen successfully litigated against Network Solutions. On October 28, 2005, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported Cohen had been arrested in Mexico and turned over to US authorities. Kremen sold sex.com in 2006 to Boston-based Escom LLC for $15 million in cash and stock, and sold sex.net for $454,500 later that year.

<doc id="678205" wikidata="Q1255124" url="?curid=678205" title="DragonStrike (video game)">
<text>DragonStrike is a 1990 flight simulator based on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; fantasy tabletop role-playing game. It is set in the Dragonlance campaign setting.

==Gameplay==
&quot;DragonStrike&quot; is a flight simulator in a high fantasy setting. The player character is a knight who flies on the back of a metallic dragon equipped with a lance and various magic items (among other things a magic orb that acts as a radar in the game). The player&#x27;s dragon can use its recharging magical breath to attack and can also attack with its claws or bite if the dragon passes closely above enemies (likewise, should the dragon pass closely beneath enemies, the player character might attack with his sword). Opponents in the game include evil dragons with and without riders and other flying monsters such as manticores, wyverns, sivak draconians and beholderkin known as gas spores. Flying too close to the ground is another hazard for the player as enemy archers are present in some areas.

Completing successful missions provides the character with more hit points and the opportunity to obtain a more powerful dragon. Depending on what dragon the player chooses (between a bronze, a silver, or a gold dragon) the ending and missions become slightly different.

==Plot==
The game is set in Krynn, world of the &quot;Dragonlance&quot; saga, during the War of the Lance. The main character is a young knight of Solamnia who progressively climbs the ranks of knighthood and is assigned to different dragon mounts. The story starts halfway through the action of the previous title, &quot;War of the Lance&quot;, after the metallic dragons joined the fight alongside the Knights of Solamnia, and it ends roughly at the same time, with a major victory of the forces of the god Paladine. 

On the other hand, the main character of the NES remake is a dragon without any rider. The action starts at the same time as the original, but it ends later, featuring an ending that is different from the one in the novels and in the tabletop modules.

==Development==
Westwood Studios had ported other SSI products, but &quot;DragonStrike&quot; was its first original game for SSI. It was designed by Louis Castle and Brett Sperry. The game was first released in 1990. 

==Ports==
Ports of &quot;DragonStrike&quot; for the PC-9801 and X68000, developed by Crosstalk, were published in 1992.

A game of the same title was published by Pony Canyon for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1992. Despite an almost identical title screen and box cover, it is noticeably different from versions of the game for other systems: instead of being a first-person flight simulator, it is a top-down scrolling shooter, with only 14 missions instead of the original 40.

==Reception==
SSI sold 34,296 copies of &quot;DragonStrike&quot;. The game was reviewed in 1990 in &quot;Dragon&quot; #161 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1990 called &quot;DragonStrike&quot; &quot;a superlative and innovative product&quot; that appealed to both fantasy and simulation gamers, although the magazine wished that it could import Gold Box characters. In a 1992 survey of science fiction games, the magazine gave the title four of five stars, stating that as a clone of &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot;, it did not receive the attention unlike the latter; a 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game three-plus stars.

A reviewer at GameSpy stated that &quot;Westwood [Studios] was finally hitting its stride as a developer with another forgotten classic and badly underrated &quot;DragonStrike&quot;&quot;. The reviewer also said that the game &quot;looked great for its time, with beautiful VGA graphics and primitive fractals used as a terrain engine, and unlike later dragonflight games, it rewarded thinking, strategizing, and taking the time to assess the situation before striking rather than pure reflexes&quot; and that while the flight model was a bit simplistic, &quot;&quot;DragonStrike&quot; is long overdue for a remake&quot;.

<text>MFSB, officially standing for &quot;Mother Father Sister Brother&quot;, was a pool of more than 30 studio musicians based at Philadelphia&#x27;s Sigma Sound Studios. They worked closely with the production team of Gamble and Huff and producer/arranger Thom Bell, and backed up Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, the O&#x27;Jays, the Stylistics, the Spinners, Wilson Pickett, and Billy Paul.

In 1972, MFSB began recording as a named act for the Philadelphia International label. &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot;, also known as the &quot;Soul Train&quot; theme, was their second and most successful single. Released in March 1974, it peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; pop and R&amp;B charts. &quot;TSOP&quot; was influential in establishing the disco sound. The track sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA in April 1974.

==Overview==
MFSB formed in 1971 and disbanded in 1985, three years after Teddy Pendergrass&#x27; car accident, which left him paralyzed.

Assembled by record producers Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, MFSB was the house band for their Philadelphia International Records label and originated &quot;Philly sound&quot; that dominated the early 1970s for the artists who recorded at the Sigma Sound Studios, including The O&#x27;Jays, The Spinners, Harold Melvin &amp; the Bluenotes, the Intruders, the Three Degrees, Jerry Butler, and Teddy Pendergrass. Later in the decade, the collective would become known for the hi-hat-dominated disco sounds that became popular in the late 1970s with groups such as the Trammps, First Choice, Ripple and Double Exposure.

It was the 1973 release of their first album, &quot;MFSB&quot;, that put them on the map. This marked the beginning of a string of instrumental hits that brought major attention to a large orchestra who laid the foundation for the Sound of Philadelphia. The line-up of musicians included Karl Chambers, Earl Young, and Norman Fearrington on drums; Norman Harris, Roland Chambers, Bobby Eli, and T. J. Tindall on guitar; Winnie Wilford and Ronnie Baker on bass; Vincent Montana Jr. on vibes, timpani, orchestra bells, chimes, percussion, arrangements and conductor, and Larry Washington on congas and bongos, Harold Ivory Williams Jr. Jr. on keyboards, plus Leon Huff and Thom Bell on keyboards and Don Renaldo on strings and horns featuring Rocco Bene on trumpet.

MFSB&#x27;s disco sound first hit the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts as the backing band for the O&#x27;Jays&#x27; &quot;Love Train&quot; in March 1973.

In 2005, drummer Keith Benson (who along with Charles Collins and Quinton Joseph, had joined the group in 1975 upon Earl Young&#x27;s departure) revived the group with Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff’s help. The lineup included himself on drums, Jimmy Williams and Stacey McGee on bass,|Dennis Harris and Barton French on guitars, Carla Benson and Michael Clark on vocals.

==Career==
In the spring of 1974, Philadelphia International released an instrumental track which had been recorded by the band as the theme music for the television show &quot;Soul Train&quot; as a single. The record, titled &quot;TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)&quot;, reached number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and also topped the R&amp;B chart and the adult contemporary chart. The success of &quot;TSOP&quot; launched a recording career for the band under their own name. MFSB albums and singles were released for the rest of the decade.

MFSB recorded a cover of the Nite-Liters&#x27;s 1971 instrumental &quot;K-Jee&quot;, which gained some popularity later when it was featured in a key scene in the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977). It is also included in the soundtrack to that movie. &quot;Sexy&quot; (1975) was later used as a prize cue for the &quot;Big Deal of the Day&quot; on the 1980 version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;.

Another popular MFSB number, &quot;Love Is the Message&quot;, has been a favorite of dance/disco DJs since its release; countless remixes, both official and unofficial, exist of the song. On September 20, 2004, the record became among the first to be inducted into the newly formed Dance Music Hall of Fame. In October 2004, the song appeared in the video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot;, playing on funk radio station, Bounce FM. An episode of the television series &quot;Pose&quot; named after the song aired on July 18, 2018, and the song appeared prominently in the episode.

Due to a disagreement with Gamble &amp; Huff over finances, several members of the group moved on to Salsoul Records, where they became known as the Salsoul Orchestra. Other members began performing as the Ritchie Family orchestra, and John Davis and the Monster Orchestra. Not to be outdone, Gamble &amp; Huff replaced them with a new rhythm section consisting of Charles Collins on drums, Michael Foreman on bass guitar, and Dennis Harris on lead guitar. They also employed Dexter Wansel and others on MFSB&#x27;s latter recordings for the label.

For decades, MFSB&#x27;s &quot;My Mood&quot; has been the closing theme music for the Friday 6 p.m. news on WRC-TV, NBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated television station in Washington, D.C. Longtime WRC-TV anchor Jim Vance said the theme was chosen to help soothe viewers after a week of particularly difficult news but also gave the station a chance to acknowledge the staff responsible for gathering it. MFSB&#x27;s &quot;TLC&quot; (Tender Lovin&#x27; Care) was used for decades as the closing credits theme for the Washington, DC, version of the &quot;It&#x27;s Academic&quot; quiz show recorded at WRC-TV.

In 2008, some of the members appeared together on new recordings made at Bobby Eli’s Studio E/The Grooveyard in the Philly suburbs. Musicians on the session were Earl Young on drums, Bobby Eli and Dennis Harris on guitars, Jimmie Williams on bass guitar, Rikki Hicks on percussion and T G Conway on keys. Two songs have been released from that session: &quot;Soul Recession&quot; by Double Exposure and &quot;There I go falling in love again&quot; by Chiquita Green.

==Name origin==
According to the book &quot;A House on Fire: The Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul&quot;, by John A. Jackson, the &quot;clean&quot; version of the MFSB name means &quot;Mother, Father, Sister, Brother&quot;, because according to Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff, despite the diversity at Philadelphia International Records, all were connected musically. This was in line with their spiritual views at the time. The &quot;other&quot; version was &quot;motherfuckin&#x27; son-of-a-bitch&quot;, an expression that was used among the musicians to compliment a person&#x27;s musical prowess.

<text>Dragon Strike is a 1993 adventure board game from TSR, Inc. based on the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy role-playing game. It was intended to be a pathway for beginners to start with, and for players to eventually play the full &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; tabletop game after kindling their interest.

==Overview==
&quot;Dragon Strike&quot; is a hybrid between a board game and a table-top role playing game. It was designed to be a gateway into &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; for new and young players. The game used a ruleset that was simpler than the basic &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules to make it easier to play. The designers hoped to attract players as young as eight years old.

The game came with several fold-out maps, cards, dice, an instructional VHS video, and a number of plastic miniatures. They represent the player characters, monsters, traps, treasure and status effects. The game included several pre-created quests available for play, one of which could be played solo.

===VHS video===
A video titled &quot;Dragon Strike&quot; came with the game on a VHS tape, intended to make the game more accessible to young players. It tells a story of the quest of a band of heroes, while demonstrating how to play the game. The &quot;host&quot; is playing the Dragon Master, trying to kindle the imagination and giving instructions on gameplay. The video also shows a live action story, featuring real-life actors. The video bears only a moderate resemblance to the actual board game. At the end of the tape is a section for the Dragon Master, which includes tips and tricks to help the players have fun, as well as making the game challenging.

The tape was prepared by Flint Dille and his Hollywood contacts, albeit on a low budget. The production was filmed with extensive use of blue screen, with actors acting against a blue screen, and a fantasy background replaced in post-production. The shooting and script were based on an early draft of the rulebook before the game was finalized, and so does not match the actual game perfectly. Monsters such as minotaurs and owlbears, plus the cleric class, make an appearance in the video but not the game itself.

===Gameplay===
The &quot;Dragon Strike&quot; game presents the basics of role-playing games in an innovative board-game format. The rules cast players in the roles of dwarves, thieves, and other fantasy archetypes. Each player receives a card representing his character, which shows ratings for Armor Class, Speed, Attack Strength, and special abilities. A clip attached to the side of the card keeps track of the character&#x27;s Hit Points. The Dragon Master—the &quot;Dragon Strike&quot; equivalent of a Dungeon Master—prepares a session by selecting a mission from the Adventure Book, locates the indicated markers and cards, then responds with monsters, traps, and treasures as the characters wander around the colorful map board. A mission must be completed within a fixed number of turns.

The Dragon Master controls the actions of the monsters and non-player characters. To resolve combat, the Dragon Master compares the Attack Strength to the target&#x27;s Armor Class; if the Attack Roll is higher, the target loses one Hit Point. Equally simple rules cover spell casting, feats of strength, and flying.

==Publication history==
The &quot;Dragon Strike&quot; game was designed by Bruce Nesmith and Andria Hayday, and published by TSR, Inc. in 1993.

In August 1993, issue #196 of Dragon Magazine included an additional scenario/adventure titled &quot;The Dragon Orb&quot;.

&quot;DragonStrike&quot; was part of an initiative by TSR to make their games accessible to young players. A 1992 introductory product called &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; and &quot;First Quest&quot; in 1994 was also part of this effort.

==In other media==
In 1994, Marvel Comics published a one-shot comic book authorized adaptation of &quot;Dragon Strike&quot;, written by Jeff Grubb, penciled by Mike Harris, and inked by Frank Percy.

Four books were written about each of the major classes featured in the video. Warrior, Elf, Wizard and Thief were the titles, and expanded on the lore and adventures leading up to the video and game.

&quot;WildSpace&quot;: Announced as a proposed TV series or expansion to &quot;Dragon Strike&quot; called &quot;WildSpace&quot; and featuring a return of several of the original cast, this time traveling into Spelljammer&#x27;s &quot;WildSpace&quot; setting. Aside from a flyer announcement and a trailer, &quot;WildSpace&quot; was never produced.

==Reception==
Rick Swan reviewed &quot;Dragon Strike&quot; for TSR&#x27;s own &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine #200 (December 1993). Swan claims that &quot;if this doesn&#x27;t lure your kid brother into the hobby, it probably can&#x27;t be done&quot;, calling it &quot;perhaps the most lavishly packaged, user-friendliest introduction to role-playing ever published&quot;. He compliments the game overall by stating: &quot;The much-touted (and unfairly criticized) videotape accomplishes exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to: Define role-playing for those who wouldn&#x27;t know a saving throw from a savings bond. What distinguishes the &quot;Dragon Strike&quot; game from other fantasy board games is, of course, the emphasis on verbal interaction. This may be nothing new to veteran gamers, but for novices, the effect is startling. It&#x27;s as if pawns on a chessboard started talking back. After a few rounds of &quot;Dragon Strike&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Role-playing Lite&quot;, I suspect most players will be salivating for the real thing&quot;.

The game sold acceptably well, selling out its initial printing of 100,000 copies, with orders for 50,000 more from toy and hobby stores. The financial success of the product was compromised by overprinting, however. TSR CEO Lorraine Williams opted to do a reprint of 150,000 copies rather than the 50,000 additional copies ordered. The extra 100,000 orders did not appear with time, and the excess copies largely sat in a warehouse. The excess copies were eventually sold at deeply discounted clearance rates, as low as a dollar a copy, compromising the overall profitability of the product for TSR. Dale Donovan described the overprinting of &quot;DragonStrike&quot; as &quot;snatch[ing] defeat from the jaws of victory&quot;. The overprinting did have the benefit of allowing TSR to essentially take out a &quot;loan&quot; from Random House, as TSR&#x27;s contract with them allowed them to ship the excess copies to Random House for immediate payment, and only be charged with debt later after the unsold copies were returned.

<doc id="678255" wikidata="Q528159" url="?curid=678255" title="Catharine A. MacKinnon">
<text>Catharine Alice MacKinnon (born October 7, 1946) is an American feminist legal scholar, activist, and author. She is the Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School, where she has been tenured since 1990, and the James Barr Ames Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. From 2008 to 2012, she was the special gender adviser to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court.

As an expert on international law, constitutional law, political and legal theory, and jurisprudence, MacKinnon focuses on women&#x27;s rights and sexual abuse and exploitation, including sexual harassment, rape, prostitution, sex trafficking and pornography. She was among the first to argue that pornography is a civil rights violation, and that sexual harassment in education and employment constitutes sex discrimination.

MacKinnon is the author of over a dozen books, including &quot;Sexual Harassment of Working Women&quot; (1979); &quot;Feminism Unmodified&quot; (1987), &quot;Toward a Feminist Theory of the State&quot; (1989); &quot;Only Words&quot; (1993); a casebook, &quot;Sex Equality&quot; (2001, 2007, 2016); &quot;Women&#x27;s Lives, Men&#x27;s Laws&quot; (2005); and &quot;Butterfly Politics&quot; (2017).

==Early life and education==
MacKinnon was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the first of three children (a girl and two boys) to Elizabeth Valentine Davis and George E. MacKinnon; her father was a lawyer, congressman (1947–1949), and judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (1969–1995).

She is the third generation of her family to attend her mother&#x27;s alma mater, Smith College. She earned her MSL and then a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1977 and a PhD in political science, also from Yale University, in 1987. While at Yale, she received a National Science Foundation fellowship.

==Career overview==
MacKinnon is the Elizabeth A. Long Professor of Law at the University of Michigan Law School and the James Barr Ames Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School. In 2007, she served as the Roscoe Pound Visiting Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and has also visited at NYU, University of Western Australia, University of San Diego, Hebrew University, Columbia Law School, University of Chicago, University of Basel, Yale Law School, Osgoode Hall Law School, UCLA School of Law, and Stanford Law School.

MacKinnon is an often-cited legal scholar and regular public speaker. Her ideas can be divided into three overlapping areas: sexual harassment, pornography and prostitution, and international work. She has also written extensively on social and political theory and methodology.

==Research and legal work==
===Sexual harassment===
In 1977, MacKinnon graduated from Yale Law School having written a paper on sexual harassment for Professor Thomas I. Emerson arguing that it was a form of sex-based discrimination. Two years later, Yale University Press published MacKinnon&#x27;s book, &quot;Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination&quot; (1979), creating the legal claim for sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and any other sex-discrimination prohibition. She also conceived the legal claim for sexual harassment as sex discrimination in education under Title IX, which was established through litigation brought by Yale undergraduates in &quot;Alexander v. Yale.&quot; While the plaintiff who went to trial on the facts, Pamela Price, lost, the case established the law: the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit recognized that, under the civil rights statute Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, schools must have procedures to address sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination.

In her book, MacKinnon argued that sexual harassment is sex discrimination because the act is a product of, and produces, the social inequality of women to men (see, for example, pp. 116–18, 174). She distinguishes between two types of sexual harassment (see pp. 32–42): 
# &quot;quid pro quo&quot;, meaning sexual harassment &quot;in which sexual compliance is exchanged, or proposed to be exchanged, for an employment opportunity (p. 32)&quot; and 
# the type of harassment that &quot;arises when sexual harassment is a persistent condition of work (p. 32)&quot;.

In 1980, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission followed MacKinnon&#x27;s framework in adopting guidelines prohibiting sexual harassment by prohibiting both quid pro quo harassment and hostile work environment harassment (see 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11 (a)). Courts also used the concepts.

In 1986, the U.S. Supreme Court held in &quot;Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson&quot; that sexual harassment may violate laws against sex discrimination. MacKinnon was co-counsel for Mechelle Vinson, the plaintiff, and wrote the brief in the Supreme Court. In &quot;Meritor&quot;, the Court recognized the distinction between quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile workplace harassment. In a 2002 article, MacKinnon wrote, quoting the Court:
&quot;Without question,&quot; then-Justice Rehnquist wrote for a unanimous Court, &quot;when a supervisor sexually harasses a subordinate because of the subordinate&#x27;s sex, that supervisor &#x27;discriminate[s]&#x27; on the basis of sex.&quot; The D.C. Circuit, and women, had won. A new common-law rule was established.

&quot;Sexual Harassment of Working Women: A Case of Sex Discrimination&quot;, is the eighth most-cited American legal book published since 1978, according to a study published by Fred R. Shapiro in January 2000.

===Pornography===
====Position====

MacKinnon, along with fellow radical feminist writer and activist Andrea Dworkin, tried to change legal approaches to pornography by framing it as a civil rights violation in the form of sex discrimination, and as human trafficking. They defined pornography as:

In &quot;Toward a Feminist Theory of the State&quot;, MacKinnon writes, &quot;Pornography, in the feminist view, is a form of forced sex, a practice of sexual politics, and institution of gender inequality&quot;. As documented by extensive empirical studies, she writes, &quot;Pornography contributes causally to attitudes and behaviors of violence and discrimination which define the treatment and status of half the population&quot;. (However, the evidence for this claim is not definitive; studies have also shown no relationship between pornography and discriminatory views nor violence against women, with some even suggesting pornography use could be correlated with more egalitarian views.)

====Anti-pornography ordinances====

In 1980, Linda Boreman (who had appeared, under the name Linda Lovelace in the pornographic film &quot;Deep Throat&quot;) said her ex-husband Chuck Traynor had violently coerced her into making &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and other pornographic films. Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, together with MacKinnon, members of Women Against Pornography, and feminist writer Andrea Dworkin offering statements in support. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Boreman, and Gloria Steinem began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of &quot;Deep Throat&quot;. This was not possible for Boreman because the statute of limitations for a possible suit had passed.

MacKinnon and Dworkin continued to discuss civil rights litigation, specifically sex discrimination, as a possible approach to combating pornography. MacKinnon opposed traditional arguments and laws against pornography based on the idea of morality or filth or sexual innocence, including the use of traditional criminal obscenity law to suppress pornography. Instead of condemning pornography for violating &quot;community standards&quot; of sexual decency or modesty, they characterized pornography as a form of sex discrimination and sought to give women the right to seek damages under civil rights law when they could prove they had been harmed. Their anti-pornography ordinances make actionable only sexually explicit material that can be proven to discriminate on the basis of sex.

In 1983, the Minneapolis city government hired MacKinnon and Dworkin to draft an anti-pornography civil rights ordinance as an amendment to the Minneapolis city human rights ordinance. The amendment defined pornography as a civil rights violation against women and allowed women who claimed harm from trafficking in pornography to sue the producers and distributors for damages in civil court. It also allowed those who had been coerced into pornography, had had pornography forced upon them, or were assaulted in a way caused by specific pornography to sue for harm they could prove. The law was passed twice by the Minneapolis city council but was vetoed by the mayor. Another version of the ordinance passed in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984, but was ruled unconstitutional by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, a decision summarily affirmed (without opinion) by the U.S. Supreme Court.

MacKinnon wrote in the &quot;Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review&quot; in 1985:

And as you think about the assumption of consent that follows women into pornography, look closely some time for the skinned knees, the bruises, the welts from the whippings, the scratches, the gashes. Many of them are not simulated. One relatively soft core pornography model said, &quot;I knew the pose was right when it hurt&quot;. It certainly seems important to the audiences that the events in the pornography be real. For this reason, pornography becomes a motive for murder, as in &quot;snuff&quot; films in which someone is tortured to death to make a sex film. They exist.

MacKinnon represented Boreman from 1980 until Boreman&#x27;s death in 2002. Civil libertarians frequently find MacKinnon&#x27;s theories objectionable (see &quot;Criticism&quot; section), arguing there is no evidence that sexually explicit media encourages or promotes violence against women. Max Waltman states that empirical evidence (based on changes to obscenity doctrine in Canada) suggests that civil rather than legal remedies may be more effective as a means of discouraging violence against women.

===Transgender sex equality===
In a 2015 interview, MacKinnon cited Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s famous quotation about &quot;becom[ing] a woman&quot; to say that who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is a woman.&quot; 

Furthermore, during a lecture at Oxford University in 2022, MacKinnon continued to express her support for transfeminism and transgender sex equality, and criticized the postmodernism, liberalist anti-stereotyping approach, and anti-trans feminism. Her lecture, called &quot;A Feminist Defense of Transgender Sex Equality Rights&quot; was subsequently edited and published in the Yale Journal of Law &amp; Feminism in 2023. In this lecture, she addresses concerns from anti-trans feminists about the idea that the recognition of trans identities leads to sexism against women.

Additionally, MacKinnon presents three legal theoretical approaches to transgender sex equality: first, the Textual and Literal Approach, which aligns with libertarianism and views discrimination against trans people as sex discrimination, but often doubles rather than eliminates it; second, the Anti-Stereotyping Approach, a liberal perspective that focuses on how trans people are stereotyped, benefiting those who don’t conform to stereotypes yet still meet dominant standards, while offering no help to those who face discrimination based on subordinated stereotypes; and third, the Substantive Approach, a feminist-informed approach that views anti-trans treatment as sex discriminatory by focusing on hierarchical social structures driven by sexualized misogyny. Under male dominance, trans women lose status during their transition, while trans men may gain it, though they may still be seen as &quot;lesser men.&quot; Trans women face intersectional discrimination as both women and trans individuals, particularly if they are of color. Trans men, although gaining status as men, may still face violence if they are perceived as feminine. MacKinnon argues that the Substantive Approach highlights sexualized misogyny and asserts that understanding gender hierarchy benefits all women.

===International work===
In February 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada largely accepted MacKinnon&#x27;s theories of equality, hate propaganda, and pornography, citing extensively from a brief she co-authored in a ruling against Manitoba pornography distributor Donald Butler. The &quot;Butler&quot; decision was controversial to some; it is sometimes implied that shipments of Dworkin&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; were seized by Canadian customs agents under this ruling, as well as books by Marguerite Duras and David Leavitt. In fact, MacKinnon&#x27;s brief argued that seizure of materials for which no harm was shown was unconstitutional.

Successful &quot;Butler&quot; prosecutions have been undertaken against the lesbian sadomasochistic magazine &quot;Bad Attitude&quot;, as well as the owners of a gay and lesbian bookstore for selling it. Canadian authorities raided an art gallery and confiscated controversial paintings depicting child abuse. Many free speech and gay rights activists have alleged that the law is selectively enforced, targeting the LGBT community.

MacKinnon represented Bosnian and Croatian women against Serbs accused of genocide since 1992, creating the legal claim for rape as an act of genocide in that conflict. She was co-counsel, representing named plaintiff S. Kadic, in &quot;Kadic v. Karadzic&quot; and won a jury verdict of $745 million in New York City on August 10, 2000. The lawsuit (under the United States&#x27; Alien Tort Statute) established forced prostitution and forced impregnation when based on ethnicity or religion in a genocidal context as legally actionable acts of genocide. In 2001, MacKinnon was named co-director of the Lawyers Alliance for Women (LAW) Project, an initiative of Equality Now, an international non-governmental organization.

MacKinnon and Dworkin proposed the law against prostitution in Sweden in 1990, which Sweden passed in 1998. What became termed the Swedish Model, also known as the Nordic Model, the &quot;Equality Model,&quot; or the &quot;Restrictive Model&quot;, penalises buyers of sexual services as well as sellers, where sellers are characterised as pimps or sex traffickers, while putatively decriminalizing all those who are &quot;bought and sold in prostitution.&quot; The fundamental concept is that the requirement to exchange sexual services for survival is a product of sex inequality and a form of violence against women. This model has been accepted in Norway, Iceland, Canada, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Israel and France, but was rejected in New Zealand.

Some organisations and individuals, such as the Global Network of Sex Work Projects, International, and the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women say that this legal model makes it harder for sex workers to find housing, make money to survive, screen clients to avoid violence, prevent their boyfriends from being arrested as &quot;pimps&quot;, and avoid the interactions with police which account for the plurality of sexual violence against sex workers.

MacKinnon works actively with the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (CATW) and Apne Aap in India.

==Political theory==
MacKinnon argues that the inequality between women and men in most societies forms a hierarchy that institutionalizes male dominance, subordinating women, in an arrangement rationalised and often perceived as natural. She writes about the interrelations between theory and practice, recognizing that women&#x27;s experiences have, for the most part, been ignored in both arenas. Furthermore, she uses Marxism to critique certain points in liberal feminism in feminist theory and uses radical feminism to criticize Marxist theory. MacKinnon notes Marx&#x27;s criticism of theory that treated class division as a spontaneous event that occurred naturally. She understands epistemology as theories of knowing, and politics as theories of power: &quot;Having power means, among other things, that when someone says, &#x27;this is how it is,&#x27; it is taken as being that way. ...Powerlessness means that when you say &#x27;this is how it is,&#x27; it is not taken as being that way. This makes articulating silence, perceiving the presence of absence, believing those who have been socially stripped of credibility, critically contextualizing what passes for simple fact, necessary to the epistemology of a politics of the powerless.&quot;

In 1996, Fred R. Shapiro calculated that &quot;Feminism, Marxism, Method, and the State: Toward Feminist Jurisprudence&quot;, 8 Signs 635 (1983), was the 96th most cited article in law reviews even though it was published in a non-legal journal.

==Criticism==
During the &quot;Feminist Sex Wars&quot; in the 1980s, feminists opposing anti-pornography stances, such as Carole Vance and Ellen Willis, began referring to themselves as &quot;pro-sex&quot; or &quot;sex-positive feminists&quot;. Sex-positive feminists and anti-pornography feminists have debated over the implicit and explicit meanings of these labels. Sex-positive feminists note that anti-pornography ordinances drafted by MacKinnon and Dworkin called for the removal, censorship, or control over sexually explicit material.

In &quot;States of Injury&quot; (1995), Wendy Brown contends that MacKinnon&#x27;s attempt to ban prostitution and pornography does not primarily protect but re-inscribes the category of &quot;woman&quot; as an essentialized identity premised on injury. In &quot;The Nation&quot;, Brown also characterized MacKinnon&#x27;s &quot;Toward a Feminist Theory of the State&quot; (1989) as a &quot;profoundly static world view and undemocratic, perhaps even anti-democratic, political sensibility&quot; as well as &quot;flatly dated&quot; and &quot;developed at &#x27;the dawn of feminism&#x27;s second wave... framed by a political-intellectual context that no longer exists — a male Marxist monopoly on radical social discourse&#x27;&quot;.

Judith Butler&#x27;s 1994 article &quot;Against Proper Objects,&quot; in a section titled &quot;Against the anti-pornography paradigm,&quot; criticizes MacKinnon as having &quot;totalizing&quot; and &quot;deterministic&quot; positions on sexuality, specifically heterosexuality, as follows:

==Personal life==
In the early 1990s, MacKinnon had a relationship with author and animal-rights activist Jeffrey Masson, and they were engaged to be married. Earlier, she had been married and divorced. MacKinnon has long been highly protective of details about her private life.

<text>Charles William Russell (14 May 1812 – 26 February 1880) was an Irish Roman Catholic clergyman from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Down and Connor and scholar.

==Early life==
He was born at Killough, County Down, Ireland, a descendant of the Russells who held the Barony of Killough of Quoniamstown and Ballystrew.

He received his early education at Drogheda grammar school (where his mother hailed from) and at Downpatrick, after which he entered St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth in 1826. (St. Patrick&#x27;s College is now formally the Pontifical University and National Seminary of Ireland, but is better known simply as Maynooth College. As such, it shares a campus and works in close cooperation with the National University of Ireland, Maynooth.) He was ordained on 13 June 1835, and became a professor of humanities.

==Works and ecclesiastical career==
In 1842 he was chosen by Pope Gregory XVI to be the first Vicar Apostolic of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), but he refused the dignity as also the Bishopric of Down and the Archbishopric of Armagh. Three years later he returned to Maynooth as professor of ecclesiastical history.

Having published his translation of Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz&#x27;s &quot;System of Theology&quot; in 1850, he was occupied on his &quot;Life of Cardinal Mezzofanti&quot; which appeared in 1858. In 1857 he succeeded Laurence F. Renehan as President of St. Patrick&#x27;s, Maynooth. Cardinal Nicholas Wiseman corresponded often with Russell, and when Wiseman visited Ireland in 1858, he paid a visit to Maynooth. In a memoir written later, Wiseman wrote &quot;the professors and the students, over five hundred in number, in full academic costume, were in waiting with the college grounds, and accorded to their illustrious visitor a thoroughly Irish welcome&quot;. There are original letters from Cardinal Wiseman to Dr. Russell in the archives of St. Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth.

In 1869, Russell&#x27;s antiquarian learning caused him to be appointed a member of the Historical Manuscripts Commission and in that capacity he acted as joint editor (with John Patrick Prendergast) of the eight-volume &quot;Report on the Carte Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library&quot; (1871) and the &quot;Calendar of Irish State Papers during the reign of James I&quot; (4 vols., 1872–1877).

He was also a frequent contributor to the &quot;Dublin Review&quot; which for thirty years he enriched by various papers, often writing more than one for the same number. The last of these were the two masterly articles on the sonnet (1876–1877). He wrote many articles for &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia&quot;, and two - &quot;Palimpsests&quot; and &quot;Papyrus&quot; - for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. He contributed other magazines, such as the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot;, the &quot;Month&quot;, and the &quot;Irish Monthly&quot;. A popular work was his translation of Canon Schmid&#x27;s &quot;Tales for the Young&quot; first published in 1846.

==Death==
He died in Dublin, aged 67, from head injuries occasioned by a fall from his horse several years earlier and is buried in the College Cemetery which he had repaired and enhanced in his time as College President

In 1983 the distinguished ecclesiastical historian Dr. Ambrose MacAuley published his biography of Russell.

==Legacy==
Cardinals Nicholas Wiseman - the first Archbishop of Westminster - and John Henry Newman alike counted him as an intimate friend, and the latter wrote of him: &quot;He had perhaps more to do with my conversion than any one else&quot;. Dr. Russell lived to witness the early success of his nephew Charles Russell who in his uncle&#x27;s lifetime was made a QC but who would subsequently become Lord Chief Justice of England.

<text>The National Bank of New Zealand Limited (NBNZ), often referred to as The National Bank, was one of New Zealand&#x27;s largest banks. Throughout much of its history, the National Bank provided commercial banking services to mainly major industrial and rural as well as some personal customers.

In 1966, Lloyds Bank became the sole owner. In 2003 Lloyds sold the bank to the Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group. The brand was retired in September 2012.

==History==

The successful flotation of the National Bank of New Zealand in London was announced in October 1872. It was to be a New Zealand bank and would begin by buying and expanding the operations of Dunedin&#x27;s Bank of Otago. The new bank had been incorporated in London by a group of people including a number of high-profile former New Zealand residents, among them former Governor Thomas Gore Browne, former Speaker Charles Clifford and former Wellington Provincial Superintendent Isaac Featherston. Another board member was Edward Brodie Hoare of Barnetts, Hoares, Hanbury and Lloyd, Bankers. 

From the first New Zealand operations were managed from Dunedin. Adam Burnes was inspector and general manager. The first branch away from Dunedin opened in Wellington in March 1873 with Alexander Kerr as its first manager. Although &quot;harmonised&quot; it did not technically acquire the 13 branches of the Bank of Otago until 1 July 1873. Branches were also opened in 1873 in Auckland and Hamilton and Christchurch. The National Bank of New Zealand (Ltd) Act gave it the right to issue banknotes redeemable (in specie or gold). Though the bank was technically domiciled in London (which provided certain advantages) the major portion of its shareholders were New Zealand resident or associated. In 1894 its headquarters were moved from Dunedin to Wellington.

Lloyds Bank acquired a small interest in The National Bank in 1919. There was a steady substantial drain of New Zealand shareholdings to the National Bank of New Zealand overseas share register throughout the 1950s and early 1960s This situation continued until 1966, when Lloyds Bank purchased The National Bank outright. In 1967 National Bank and the Bank of New Zealand established joint data processing services operated by Databank Systems. The other trading banks joined the now proven computer system and ownership of Databank the following year.

The bank tentatively dipped a toe into foreign waters in 1969 when it established a branch in Rarotonga, Cook Islands. This foray ended in 1986 when it sold its banking license in Rarotonga to European Pacific Banking Company.

The head office was moved from London to Wellington in 1978 and the Black Horse became its emblem. The Black Horse logo dates back to 1677 London when Humphrey Stockes adopted it as the sign for his shop. Stokes was a goldsmith and &#x27;keeper of the running cashes&#x27;, a banker. When Lloyds Bank took over his site in 1884 it kept the horse as its symbol.

The National Bank acquired Southpac Investment Management in 1983. Five years later it bought The Rural Bank, the former New Zealand Government owned bank, from Fletcher Challenge. It continued consolidating banking in NZ by purchasing Countrywide Banking Corporation from Bank of Scotland in 1998.

In December 2003, the Australia &amp; New Zealand Banking Group purchased the National Bank. Included in the sale was the right to continue to use the Black Horse logo for seven years.

In September 2012, ANZ announced that the National Bank brand would be retired in favour of the ANZ brand over the next two years.

==Sponsorships==
The National Bank was the sponsor of New Zealand Cricket and sponsors all the home tournaments of the country and the New Zealand national cricket team. The National Bank sponsored the National Bank Cup in netball from 2002 until 2007.

<doc id="678285" wikidata="Q7400951" url="?curid=678285" title="Saint Ann's School (Brooklyn)">
<text>Saint Ann&#x27;s School is a private school in Brooklyn, New York City. The school is a non-sectarian, co-educational pre-K–12 day school with programs in the arts, humanities, and sciences. The students number 1,012 from preschool through 12th grade, as well as 324 faculty, administration, and staff members.

The campus, located in Brooklyn Heights, includes a central 15-story building, two adjoining brownstones, and a preschool and kindergarten located near the main campus. Annual tuition as of 2022 is between $48,000 and $52,000.

==History==
Saint Ann&#x27;s School was founded in 1965 with 63 students and seven teachers in the basement of the St. Ann&#x27;s Episcopal Church under the aegis of the vestry of the church and several interested parents. In 1966, the church purchased the former Crescent Athletic Club House, a building designed by Frank Freeman, which has since served as the school&#x27;s main building.

Stanley Bosworth became its first headmaster. In 1982, Saint Ann&#x27;s School formally disaffiliated from the church, having been granted a charter from the Board of Regents of the State of New York. In 2023, Kenyatte Reid became head of school.

==Academic program==
The school allows its high school juniors and seniors to design their own curriculum.

In a 2004 survey conducted by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Saint Ann&#x27;s was rated the number one high school in the country for having the highest percentage of graduating seniors enroll in Ivy League and other highly selective colleges. In late 2007, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; again listed Saint Ann&#x27;s as one of the country&#x27;s top 50 high schools for its success in preparing students to enter top American universities. In 2012, the &quot;New York Observer&quot; ranked Saint Ann&#x27;s as the number one high school in New York City.

== Divisions and demographics ==
The school is organized into four divisions: preschool, lower, middle and high school. The vast majority of the students are from Brooklyn and Manhattan, although other boroughs are represented. Approximately 22 percent of the student body receive some level of scholarship aid (8.5 percent receive tuition remission; 13.5 percent receive financial aid). Approximately 33 percent of the student body are nonwhite.

In her memoirs, Claire Dederer wrote that when she was a student at Oberlin College, &quot;all the coolest girls&quot; had attended St. Ann&#x27;s: &quot;They had slept with Beastie Boys when the Beastie Boys were still a punk band. They had famous parents. [...] The Saint Ann’s girls didn’t need anyone besides themselves. They ruled the school.&quot; 

==Controversies==
===Allegations of Sexual Misconduct=== 
In 2017, allegations of sexual misconduct by teachers were posted to Facebook. In response, the school commissioned an independent investigation, which announced in 2019 that it had identified nineteen former St. Anne&#x27;s teachers or staff who potentially engaged in inappropriate behavior or sexual misconduct with students, going back to the 1970s.

===Suicide of Ellis Lariviere=== 
In February 2021 an eighth grade St. Ann&#x27;s student, Ellis Lariviere, committed suicide after being notified that he would not be permitted to continue at the school following the end of the year. Lariviere was noted as a talented artist who struggled with dyslexia. His midyear eighth grade reports noted his problems with writing and organization, but also noted the progress he had made that year, and praised him for creative thinking and contributions to his classes. Lariviere&#x27;s suicide note specifically requested that the school not hold an assembly about his death, and the school&#x27;s notification to parents failed to mention that he had been told not to return to the school. Two years later, in April 2023, Lariviere&#x27;s parents filed suit against the school, its headmaster, and its board of trustees for wrongful death. A commentating law professor, David C. Bloomfield, stated that despite how private schools are not required to retain students, the school did make an ethical commitment not to give up on students.

===Hiring of Winston Nguyen=== 
In July 2024, St. Ann&#x27;s math teacher Winston Nguyen was arrested and charged with &quot;use of a child in a sexual performance, promoting a sexual performance by a child and disseminating indecent material to a minor&quot;, among other charges. It was revealed that Nguyen had previously been convicted of grand larceny, stealing more than $300,000 from an elderly couple he worked for, and that St. Ann’s had been aware of his criminal past when they hired him.

==Faculty and alumni==
The school maintains a list called &quot;The Growing Shelf&quot;, which documents all published community members.

===Notable faculty===
* Pearl Abraham (novelist)
* Staceyann Chin (poet and LGBT activist)
* Mark Denbeaux (lawyer)
* Jonathan Elliott (composer)
* Oskar Eustis (artistic director of Public Theater)

<text>Miguel Jesús Cairo [ki&#x27;-row] (born May 4, 1974), is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder and currently the bench coach for the Washington Nationals. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine different clubs in a 17-year career, spanning from 1996 to 2012. During his playing days, Cairo stood tall and weighed while batting and throwing right-handed. While primarily a second baseman, Cairo was able to play all the infield positions and as a corner outfielder. He was also used for pinch-hitting duties late in his career. He was interim manager for the White Sox in the latter part of the 2022 season as manager Tony La Russa stepped away due to health concerns.

==Playing career==

===Los Angeles Dodgers (1990–1995)===
Cairo was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Los Angeles Dodgers on September 20, 1990. After beginning his career with the Dodgers Dominican Summer League team, he played with the rookie class Gulf Coast Dodgers (1992), Class-A Vero Beach Dodgers (1992–1993), Advanced Class-A Bakersfield Dodgers (1994) and AA San Antonio Missions.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1996)===
On November 29, 1995, the Dodgers traded Cairo with Willis Otañez to the Seattle Mariners for Mike Blowers, who then traded him, along with Bill Risley, to the Toronto Blue Jays for Edwin Hurtado and Paul Menhart on December 18, 1995.

Cairo made his major league debut with the Toronto Blue Jays on April 17, 1996, as the starting 2nd baseman. In his first Major League at-bat, he hit a double off Chuck Finley of the California Angels. He played in 9 games for the Blue Jays, with six hits in 27 at-bats for a .222 average. He also played in 120 games for the AAA Syracuse Chiefs, hitting .277.

===Chicago Cubs (1997)===
On November 20, 1996, he was traded to the Chicago Cubs in exchange for minor leaguer Jason Stevenson. Cairo spent most of the 1997 season with the AAA Iowa Cubs, where he hit .279 in 135 games and was selected to the American Association All-Star team. He also appeared in 16 games for the Cubs and had seven hits in 29 at-bats (.241).

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays (1998–2000)===
The Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected Cairo with the eighth pick in the 1997 MLB expansion draft. He hit his first home run on April 28, 1998, off of Mike Oquist for the Oakland Athletics. He spent three seasons with the Devil Rays, playing fairly frequently, and hit .275 in 389 games. He was the final active player from their inaugural season when he retired.

===Return to the Cubs (2001)===
Cairo signed with the Oakland Athletics during the 2000–2001 offseason, but in March 2001 he was traded back to the Cubs for Eric Hinske. In 66 games with the Cubs, he hit .285.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2001–2003)===
In August 2001, the St. Louis Cardinals claimed Cairo on waivers from the Cubs. He remained with the Cardinals through the 2003 season. He hit .333 in 27 games in 2001, .250 in 108 games in 2002 and .245 in 92 games in 2003. He also appeared in the postseason for the first time in his career in 2001. In the 2002 National League Championship Series against the San Francisco Giants he had five hits, including a home run, in 13 at-bats.

===New York Yankees (2004)===
Cairo signed with the New York Yankees during the 2003–04 offseason.

In 2004, Cairo won the second base job with the Yankees after starting the year in a platoon with Enrique Wilson. Cairo led the league in percentage of productive outs in 2004 for players with a minimum of 40 at-bats. Cairo recorded 17 productive outs in 32 productive out situations, for a PO% of 0.531. Cairo had the highest winning percentage of team wins when he played in a game of any player in the majors in 2004 (for players with over 100 games played). However, the Yankees declined to offer him a contract for 2005 and signed Tony Womack as their new second baseman.

===New York Mets (2005)===
Cairo was signed by the New York Mets as a free agent before the 2005 season and hit .251 in 100 games.

===Return to the Yankees (2006–2007)===
He returned to the Yankees in 2006 and hit .239 in 81 games.

On August 7, 2007, the Yankees designated him for assignment in order to make room on the 40-man roster for Jason Giambi. He was released on August 15.

===Return to the Cardinals (2007)===
On August 19, 2007, the St. Louis Cardinals signed Cairo to a minor league contract, with him reporting to AAA Memphis on August 22. On September 1, 2007, the Cardinals activated him and brought him up to start at second base in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. He became a free agent after the season.

===Seattle Mariners (2008)===

On January 8, 2008, he signed a one-year contract with the Seattle Mariners.

Early at the season, Cairo was seldom used, losing his playing time to teammate Willie Bloomquist and Greg Norton. Norton was soon traded to the Atlanta Braves and, with outfield trouble, the Mariners started a platoon with Bloomquist and Jeremy Reed in center field. which allowed Cairo to be a back-up for struggling first baseman Richie Sexson.

On July 10, the Mariners released Sexson and Cairo assumed the role of full-time first baseman for a few days until Bryan LaHair was finished nursing a sore toe. For the rest of the season, Cairo shared duties at first base with left-handed hitting LaHair, and started at the other infield positions when the incumbents had an off-day.

===Philadelphia Phillies (2009)===
On February 15, 2009, Cairo signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Philadelphia Phillies. On May 19, 2009, the Phillies outrighted Cairo to the AAA Lehigh Valley IronPigs.

Cairo was sent back up to the Phillies on August 23 after they placed Greg Dobbs on the 15-day DL. He returned to the utility infield position, and was retained by the club through the remainder of the regular season. His performance during this stint, including several key hits, led to his inclusion in the division-winning team&#x27;s postseason roster.

===Cincinnati Reds (2010–2012)===
On January 27, 2010, Cairo signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds. On April 2, Cairo made the Opening Day roster. On December 8, as a free agent, he signed a two-year deal with the Reds, which was the first multi-year contract of his career. He had the first multi-home run game of his career on August 13, against the San Diego Padres, in a game that the Reds won 13–1.

==Venezuela League==
In between seasons, Cairo played winter ball with the Leones del Caracas and Cardenales de Lara clubs of the Venezuelan League during the 1993–2003 seasons, hitting .286 with a .351 slugging average in 358 games. Additionally, he hit .308 for the 2000–2001 Cardenales champion team en route to the 2001 Caribbean Series, where he batted .360 and slugged .680 with six RBI.

==Post-playing career==
On February 14, 2013, the Reds announced that Cairo would operate as a special assistant to General Manager Walt Jocketty, effectively ending his playing career.
At the end of spring training the Reds third base coach Mark Berry was diagnosed with throat cancer, then Cairo filled as the team&#x27;s bench coach while Chris Speier moved to third base. With Berry&#x27;s return, Cairo moved back to his intended spot as assistant to Jocketty.

He worked for the New York Yankees in Player Development and was an occasional infield coordinator throughout the Yankee minor league system.

On November 18, 2020, the Chicago White Sox announced that he would join the coaching staff. He served as the bench coach for manager Tony La Russa.

<doc id="678297" wikidata="Q6259283" url="?curid=678297" title="John Stoltenberg">
<text>John Stoltenberg (born 1944) is an American author, activist, magazine editor, college lecturer, playwright, and theater reviewer who identifies his political perspective as radical feminist. For several years he has worked for &quot;DC Metro Theater Arts&quot; and is its executive editor. He has written three books, two collections of his essays and a novel. He was the life partner of Andrea Dworkin for 30 years and has lived with his husband, Joe Hamilton, for over 15 years.

==Education and career==
Stoltenberg studied philosophy, focusing on the philosophy of religion. He holds a Master of Divinity from Union Theological Seminary and a Master of Fine Arts in Theatre Arts from Columbia University School of the Arts. In undergraduate and graduate school, he began writing, producing, directing, and acting in plays. Upon graduation, he became the writer-in-residence and administrative director for the influential experimental theater company The Open Theater, whose artistic director was Joseph Chaikin. Meanwhile, Stoltenberg&#x27;s own plays were produced off-Broadway, and he won a New York State Arts Council grant to be a playwright.

In the 1980s, John began his career as a magazine editor. He worked as the managing editor at &quot;Essence&quot;, &quot;Working Woman&quot;, &quot;Lear&#x27;s&quot;, and later &quot;&quot;. Stoltenberg serves as executive editor and Communications Advisor for DC Metro Theater Arts, where he publishes theater reviews, interviews, and essays about live theater in Washington, D.C. In 2015, John produced a one-woman play titled &quot;Aftermath&quot;, which was an edited version of an unpublished essay by Andrea Dworkin. It was edited and directed for the stage by Adam Thorburn.

==Writings==
Stoltenberg has written many essays and speeches, as well as a novel, reflecting his pro-feminist sexual politics. Several appeared in the book &quot;For Men Against Sexism: A Book of Readings&quot; (1977): &quot;Refusing to Be a Man&quot;, &quot;Toward Gender Justice&quot;, and &quot;Eroticism and Violence in the Father-Son Relationship&quot;. 

In 1989, he published a collection of his essays, &quot;Refusing to Be a Man: Essays on Sex and Justice&quot;. Lesbian author Rita Mae Brown stated the book carefully identifies the process by which male identification &quot;affects and distorts men&#x27;s most intimate capacities.&quot; This was followed in 1993 by a second collection &quot;The End of Manhood: A Book for Men of Conscience&quot;. 

In 2013, he published the novel &quot;GONERZ&quot;. He has stated the writings of Andrea Dworkin have been the inspiration for his own and he dedicated all three books to her. His work is included in several anthologies including &quot;Feminism and Men: Reconstructing Gender Relations&quot; and &quot;The New Politics of Masculinity: Men, Power and Resistance&quot;. Stoltenberg has been credited with the quote: &quot;Pornography tells lies about women. But pornography tells the truth about men.&quot;

==Personal life==
Born and raised in Minnesota, in his early life John was married to a woman and lived within traditional marital roles. After that, John has lived as an out gay man who also uses the term queer. He chose to spend his life with the radical feminist and lesbian, Andrea Dworkin. They were introduced by a mutual friend, a theater director, in 1974, at a meeting of the then-fledgling Gay Academic Union. Later in 1974, after walking out of a poetry reading—a benefit for the War Resisters League in Greenwich Village—due to the misogynist content, they began their decades-long intellectual and personal relationship. 

Their agreement was that while they would always live together, they could have relationships outside of their partnership and John did have relationships with men. John and Andrea planned never to marry unless one of two things occurred. As Andrea stated to &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1985, &quot;unless one of us is terminally ill or jailed for political activity&quot;, as she had been at the Women&#x27;s House of Detention in New York at the age of eighteen. While they intended for the 1985 article to make clear they were not heterosexual, the &quot;editor refused to allow the writer to identify us as gay and lesbian, as we had asked.&quot; They married in 1998, due to her ill health. 

Their life of 31 years together ended in 2005 with Dworkin&#x27;s unexpected death from an enlarged heart. Since then, John has lived with his husband, Joe Hamilton, in Washington, D.C.

==Activism==
In addition to joining Dworkin in marches to protest against pornography, Stoltenberg founded Men Against Pornography in New York City, the male branch of Women Against Pornography. In the mid-&#x27;80s, he created and facilitated &quot;The Pose Workshop&quot;, which entailed clothed men adopting the poses that women strike in pornographic shots with direction from other attendees, a version of which was broadcast on BBC television. He used that as an empathy-builder with young men on college campuses and at anti-sexist men&#x27;s conferences across the US.

He was a founder of the group Men Can Stop Rape and developed the group&#x27;s “My Strength” poster campaign which aims to educate young men on sexual relationships, consent, and rape. 

He is also the creative director of the group&#x27;s &quot;My Duty&quot; sexual-assault-prevention media campaign, which is licensed to the United States Department of Defense&#x27;s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.

Stoltenberg has voiced his support for transgender rights, and argued in 2020 that Dworkin was a transgender ally.

In January 2008, a Philippine record of 17,000 birds (in the 24-hour count) visited the 32,000-hectare Candaba Swamp, sanctuary for migratory birds. There are 80 species of migratory birds were sighted at the 100-hectare fishpond of Mayor Jerry Pelayo in Barangay Doña Simang and in Barangay Paralaya. The rare birds spotted were: the Shrenck&#x27;s bittern, great bittern, gadwall, coot, Philippine mallard or ducks, and Eurasian spoonbill (&quot;Platalea leucorodia&quot;). Robert S. Kennedy&#x27;s book &quot;A Guide to the Birds of the Philippines&quot; lists endemic and migratory birds which visit the Philippines. Pelayo organized the Ibon-Ebon Festival (“birds and eggs”) on February 1–2. The WBCP recorded three rare species in Candaba swamp: the purple swamphen (&quot;Porphyrio porphyrio&quot;), Chinese pond heron (&quot;Ardeola bacchus&quot;) and the black-crowned night heron (&quot;Nycticorax nycticorax&quot;).

==Early life==
Corbett was raised in Wheeling, West Virginia, U.S. He grew up in an apartment block near the Ohio River with his mother and stepfather, both of whom worked at his uncle Phillip&#x27;s music club. Corbett was raised Catholic, and was an altar boy for seven years at St. Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral. His father was raised in Bellaire, Ohio, and was a member of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

<text>Janine Turner (born Janine Loraine Gauntt; December 6, 1962) is an American actress best known for her roles as Maggie O&#x27;Connell in the television series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, as Jessie Deighan in the feature film &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, and as Katie McCoy in &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. She is an author, public speaker and founder and co-chair of Constituting America 2010.

==Early life==
Turner was born Janine Loraine Gauntt in Lincoln, Nebraska, the daughter of Janice Loraine (&quot;née&quot; Agee) and Turner Maurice Gauntt Jr. Her parents returned to their native Texas soon after her birth, and Turner grew up in Euless and Fort Worth, Texas.

==Career==
In 1978, the 15-year-old Turner left home to pursue a modeling career with the Wilhelmina Modeling Agency in New York City. She began her acting career in 1980 in Hollywood, appearing in several episodes of &quot;Dallas&quot;. In October 1981 Turner could be seen in a television commercial for Buf-Puf body sponge. She continued to make guest appearances on television shows throughout the 1980s before landing the role of Laura Templeton on &quot;General Hospital&quot;.

By 1986, Turner had become frustrated by the quality of the roles she was getting. As she told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; five years later, &quot;I was always working, but I wanted to do more serious roles and knew that I had the talent. I had to get away from Hollywood.&quot; Disregarding her agent&#x27;s advice, Turner moved to New York in order to hone her craft, studying in Manhattan with Marcia Haufrecht of the Actors Studio.
I gained a new respect and appreciation for acting in New York. And I decided that I didn&#x27;t want to lock myself into roles that portrayed women negatively. I turned a lot of (TV and film) opportunities down because of that. Everyone thought I was crazy. I was really going for broke. I only had eight dollars left and had become very depressed right before I got the part in &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;.

 Cast as Maggie O&#x27;Connell in 1990, Turner&#x27;s work on &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; earned her an Emmy nomination in 1993 and three consecutive Golden Globe nominations from 1992 to 1994. Accolades aside, the role itself was a positive experience for Turner, following the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; roles that had all but driven her from Hollywood in the first place. &quot;I&#x27;ve found my ideal character in Maggie,&quot; she told the &quot;Tribune&quot;. &quot;She&#x27;s smarter and stronger than all the men she meets.&quot; Turner&#x27;s own move from Hollywood to New York was mirrored by Maggie&#x27;s, from her affluent Grosse Pointe community to the remote fictional backwater of Cicely, Alaska. Turner said about Maggie that &quot;She went against the grain and challenged herself by moving to Alaska.&quot;
After her breakthrough in &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, Turner appeared in the action film &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; opposite Sylvester Stallone. She next appeared as June Cleaver in a &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; film adaptation of television&#x27;s original &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot;, then in &quot;Stolen Women: Captured Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot; with Richard Gere. She also appeared in &quot;No Regrets&quot; and numerous movies of the week.

In 2004, Turner wrote, produced, and directed the award-winning &quot;Trip in a Summer Dress&quot;, a film about a strong-willed mother and her children. In 2006, she appeared in a low-budget movie filmed in Dallas, &quot;The Night of the White Pants&quot;, with Tom Wilkinson. In 2007, she co-wrote, co-produced, and starred in &quot;Christoga&quot;, a Christian Yoga DVD, Turner also co-wrote and produced an album, &quot;Mockingbird Hill&quot;, in which both she and her daughter Juliette sang.

In 2008, Turner began a 12-episode run on the NBC television series &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. She portrayed Katie McCoy, mother of a talented high school football quarterback.
In 2015, Turner portrayed the wife of Anthony Hopkins&#x27; character in &quot;Solace&quot;.

In 2010 Turner founded and is the co-president of the organization Constituting America with co-president Cathy Gillespie, aimed at educating American adults and students about the non-partisan relevancy of the U.S. Constitution.

On May 21, 2011, Turner began hosting a live two-hour talk show, &quot;The Janine Turner Show&quot;, on talk radio station KLIF (AM) in Dallas, and in Houston, KPRC (AM), followed by iHeart Radio until 2013. It was awarded &quot;Best Radio Show in Dallas&quot;.

Turner is the author of four books, &quot;Holding Her Head High: Inspiration from 12 Single Mothers Who Championed Their Children and Changed History&quot;,&quot;A Little Bit Vulnerable: On Hollywood, God, Sobriety, &amp; Politics&quot;, &quot;Wisdom For Each Day: Inherited From My Great Grandfather&quot;, and &quot;Artificial Intelligentsia Vs. Primal Sense&quot;. &quot;Holding Her Head High&quot; focuses on single mothers through history, such as Rachel Lavein Fawcett, the abandoned single mother of Alexander Hamilton.

==Activism and advocacy==
In 2006, Turner was appointed a member of the President&#x27;s Council on Service and Civic Participation. 
In 2010, Turner launched her public speaking career on the national circuit and became a sought-after public inspirational speaker on a plethora of topics, including heart health, sobriety, faith, the Constitution, and politics. She speaks at corporate events, civic events, schools, universities, and churches.

Turner has described herself as &quot;socially liberal and fiscally conservative. I&#x27;m almost more libertarian.&quot; Turner has written 85 essays on the 85 Federalist Papers, and many op-ed pieces for the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot;, &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, and FoxNews.com. Turner has written a petition, &quot;The Truth Act&quot; – and corresponding white paper, &quot;Long and Little Known: How Incoherent Statutes Harm Liberty &amp; the Rule of Law&quot;.

==Personal life==

Turner has never married. Her daughter, Juliette Turner-Jones, was born in 1997. Turner was once engaged to Alec Baldwin and also dated Troy Aikman, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Mark Grace and Sylvester Stallone. As of 2014, Turner was living on a longhorn cattle ranch outside Dallas with her daughter.

<text>Napo (formerly the National Association of Probation Officers) is the trade union and professional association that represents probation staff including probation officers and other operational and administrative staff and Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service staff in England.

Napo was formed on 22 May 1912. It was a member of the Standing Conference of Organisations of Social Workers from 1962, but decided not to join the new British Association of Social Workers in 1970. In 2001, it opted to change its title to &quot;Napo–the trade union and professional association for family court and probation staff&quot;.
It holds an annual general meeting which is open to all members of the union.

It retains a campaigning remit on both criminal justice and family court matters and is recognised as an influential and respectable source of information by both the media and politicians of all parties.

General Secretary Ian Lawrence was reappointed unopposed to commence a third 5 year term of office from July 2023. He is among the few senior British/Asian trade union leaders to emerge from the community for some time and currently serves on the TUC General Council as the member representing black workers from unions with less than 200,000 members.

Ian has made a substantial number of contributions in the media on the situation pertaining to the state of the probation service in England and Wales following the part privatisation of services in 2014. He has also contributed to a number of keynote seminars examining issues within the wider UK criminal justice system and has also provided oral evidence to the Parliamentary Justice Select Committee inquiry into the impact of the Transforming Rehabilitation programme. On 13 June 2020 Napo celebrated a major victory following the announcement by the Lord Chancellor that probation services would return to public ownership and control in June 2021. This news followed a long and sometimes attritional campaign which commanded widespread support from many politicians and groups who had also predicted major problems following the ill-fated reforms that were implemented by the then Secretary of State for Justice Chris Grayling.

Napo is an independent trade union but has good relations with the Labour Party front bench and a number of cross-party MP&#x27;s and Peers in terms of assisting the development of its future policies on the probation and prison service and family justice issues. It is also a founding member of the Justice Unions Parliamentary Group.

The &quot;Probation Journal&quot;, established in 1929, is published by SAGE Publications in association with Napo.

<doc id="678326" wikidata="Q454412" url="?curid=678326" title="Keshia Knight Pulliam">
<text>Keshia Knight Pulliam (born April 9, 1979) is an American actress. She began her career as a child actor. She landed her breakthrough role as Rudy Huxtable, on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1984–1992), and became the youngest person to be nominated for an Emmy Award, when she earned a nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in A Comedy Series at the 38th Primetime Emmy Awards. She later reprised the character on the spin-off series &quot;A Different World&quot; (1987–88). Knight Pulliam is also known for her portrayal of Miranda Lucas-Payne on the TBS comedy drama &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot; (2007–present).

==Career==
Knight Pulliam made her professional debut at 9 months old, in a national print advertisement for Johnson &amp; Johnson baby products. At age 3, she was on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. In 1984, she was cast as Rudy Huxtable on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, a role she played until the series ended in 1992. In 1986, Knight Pulliam became one of the youngest actresses to be nominated for an Emmy Award, receiving a nomination at age 6 for Outstanding Supporting Actress in A Comedy Series. She continued working, appearing in television commercials and TV shows, and making her feature film debut in &quot;The Last Dragon&quot; (1985). She also appeared in the movies &quot;Polly&quot; and its sequel &quot;Polly: Comin&#x27; Home!&quot; with her &quot;Cosby Show&quot; co-star Phylicia Rashad. She is ranked at No. 27 in VH1&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Kid Stars&quot;.

Knight Pulliam won a celebrity version of &quot;Fear Factor&quot; in September 2002. She also won a celebrity version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, and participated in &quot;Celebrity Mole: Yucatan&quot;. In 2004, she appeared in Chingy&#x27;s music video for &quot;One Call Away&quot;. In 2005, she played Darnelle in &quot;Beauty Shop&quot; with Queen Latifah. Knight Pulliam performed in Donald Gray&#x27;s play &quot;The Man of Her Dreams&quot; in the fall of 2006 in St. Louis. In 2008, she joined the cast of &quot;Tyler Perry&#x27;s House of Payne&quot; as Miranda, the new wife of Calvin Payne. The role earned her the 2009 and 2010 NAACP Image Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series. In 2009, she played Candace &quot;Candy&quot; Washington-Collins in the film &quot;Madea Goes to Jail&quot;. Knight Pulliam appeared in Tank&#x27;s 2010 music video for his cover of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me&quot;, playing his love interest.

In 2011, commenting on the fact that only white actors had won Golden Globe Awards that year, she said: &quot;I think that there is definitely work to be done. It can always be more diverse. We live in a very multicultural and global society. More needs to be done to increase the representation of all people and really show the world for what it is. It’s not just one color.&quot;

In 2013, she was a contestant on the ABC celebrity diving show &quot;Splash&quot;. She was first to be eliminated. In 2015, Knight Pulliam was a contestant on the NBC show &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Season 7&quot; and was the first contestant eliminated after being the losing project manager for her team. In 2018, Knight Pulliam was a HouseGuest on the first season of the CBS series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, where she was the second person evicted out of the house, on Day 13.

==Personal life==

She has three brothers, James Knight Pulliam II, Mshon Knight Pulliam, and Juwan Pulliam. Knight Pulliam attended Rutgers Preparatory School in Somerset, New Jersey.

When &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; ended its run in 1992, her family moved to Virginia, where Knight Pulliam attended the Potomac School in McLean and Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Virginia, from which she graduated in 1997. She received a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Spelman College in 2001. She is a member of the Eta Kappa chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.

<doc id="678335" wikidata="Q7141401" url="?curid=678335" title="Parx Casino and Racing">
<text>Parx Casino and Racing (formerly Philadelphia Park Racetrack and Casino) is a Thoroughbred horse racing venue and the largest casino gaming complex in Pennsylvania. Parx is located in Bensalem Township in Bucks County, northeast of the city of Philadelphia. Owned and operated by Greenwood Gaming and Entertainment, Inc., Parx features 24-hour gaming with over 3,200 slot machines, 188 live table games, a poker room with 48 poker tables, live racing and simulcast action, sports betting, several dining options and bars, and the Xcite Center. Parx also offers online gambling and online sports betting along with off-track betting at two locations.

==History==

Originally called Keystone Racetrack, it opened in November 1974 in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, replacing the Liberty Bell Park Racetrack in Northeast Philadelphia as the area&#x27;s Thoroughbred track. When the track was purchased in 1984 by ITB, the racetrack received a new name, Philadelphia Park, a new turf course, and an innovative new way to wager called Phonebet.

In December 1990, the racetrack again changed hands when Greenwood Racing, Inc., a corporation founded in 1989 by British bookmaking veterans Bob Green and Bill Hogwood, purchased the oval from ITB. Full card simulcasting was added, as well as six off-track locations called Turf Clubs, allowing race fans to watch and wager seven days a week.

Late in 1998, Greenwood joined with fellow Pennsylvania corporation, Penn National Gaming, Inc., in expanding into New Jersey with the purchase of Freehold Raceway in Freehold Borough and the operating lease of Garden State Park in Cherry Hill. The new partnership, called Pennwood, was expected to pursue off-track and account wagering in New Jersey. Garden State Park closed in 2002, and was razed shortly thereafter. Simulcasting on cable broadcasting systems (notably those owned by Comcast) was discontinued in March 2010, and shortly replaced by Comcast with TVG Network, who later joined with Harrah&#x27;s Chester to bring their own simulcasting betting accounts in October 2010.

On August 30, 2010, the track was rechristened as Parx Racing and Casino.

Over the years, such notable horses as Shuvee, My Juliet, Spectacular Bid, Revidere, Summer Squall, and Broad Brush found their way to the winner&#x27;s circle at Parx Racing and Casino. The track became famous as the original home of 2004 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes champion Smarty Jones, who placed second in the Belmont Stakes, narrowly missing the Triple Crown.

In November 2014, it was revealed that Parx was requiring jockeys to sign a waiver as a condition of riding there. It is believed that the waiver stemmed from a court judgement against Parx in favor of the family of Mario Calderon, an exercise rider who suffered fatal injuries in an incident on the Parx backstretch in 2010. The judgement required Parx to pay Calderon&#x27;s family $7.8 million in damages. The Jockeys&#x27; Guild said that the waiver contained language &quot;inconsistent with the laws of Pennsylvania&quot; and it would instruct its members against signing it.

In 2017, Parx hosted the fourth annual Jockeys and Jeans fundraiser for the Permanently Disabled Jockeys Fund. The fundraiser has raised more than $650,000 with the goal of raising $200,000 in 2017. The event was previously held in Tampa Bay Downs, Indiana Grand, and Gulfstream Park.

On March 19, 2018, a major accident occurred during the 9th race, in which hall of fame jockey Jose Flores was sent to a hospital following the incident. It was announced that he would be placed on life support a day later. The horse however had to undergo animal euthanasia. Flores was pronounced dead on March 22, 2018, at 12:42 pm.

==Pennsylvania Derby and Cotillion Handicap==
Parx Racing and Casino is the home of Pennsylvania&#x27;s two premier Thoroughbred races, the $1 million (as of 2019) Grade I Pennsylvania Derby and the $1 Million Grade I Cotillion Handicap. The Pennsylvania Derby (which first served as a Memorial Day replacement for the Jersey Derby after the original grandstand at Garden State Park was destroyed by a fire in 1977), was held on Labor Day until 2010 when the race was moved to the last Saturday in September. This brought it closer to the Breeders&#x27; Cup World Championships. The Pennsylvania Derby is a (nine furlongs) race for three-year-olds that has consistently attracted quality fields and large crowds. Over the past few years, it has evolved into a three-day festival that lasts all of Labor Day weekend at the racetrack, culminating with the running of the Derby. The festival has now become a month-long event that features the annual &quot;Owners and Pennsylvania Day at the Races&quot; the Saturday after Labor Day, and a new US$300,000 preliminary event on Labor Day named the &quot;Smarty Jones.&quot; (This race was not run in 2006 because of the rebuilding of the main grandstand as a &quot;racino&quot;.)

The Cotillion, which has been run since Thoroughbred racing began in Pennsylvania in 1969 at the old Liberty Bell Park in Northeast Philadelphia, is a (Eight and a half furlong) race. It is held (as of 2010) on the first Saturday in October as part of a fundraiser for the Susan G. Komen for the Cure breast cancer charity with races featuring female jockeys called &quot;Parx Racing Ladies Day at the Races&quot;

The main grandstand&#x27;s lower floor was reconstructed back into a horse racing facility in September 2010.

The track&#x27;s announcer was Keith Jones. Mr. Jones began his announcing career at Garden State Park as an assistant in the summer of 1985. He took over the full-time duties at Philadelphia Park in 1987. He also spent 13 years as the public address announcer for the Philadelphia Phantoms of the American Hockey League and has had the chance to call a handful of games for the parent club, the Philadelphia Flyers. In addition, Mr. Jones serves as host of the TV program, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Racing,&quot; a 30-minute show featuring highlights of local racing and major, national stakes. He is a member of the track&#x27;s Hall of Fame, inducted with the inaugural class in September 2011. Jones retired on December 30, 2020.

The Pennsylvania State Fair was held at the racetrack annually from 1987 to 2006. In 2002, the track hosted the Claiming Crown of horse racing.

The movie Safe, starring Jason Statham, filmed at Parx Racing and Casino.

On September 27, 2006, the racetrack was awarded a conditional slots license by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board, allowing construction to begin on the casino. Final approval of a permanent license came on December 20, 2006, and the following day the casino opened. Bally&#x27;s was chosen as the casino management system. The name of the casino - &quot;Parx&quot; - a modified spelling of the racetrack name - was unveiled following a fireworks display on July 4, 2009.

The plan for the site:
*Phase 1: Renovation of the Grandstand, building of the Parx Casino. (Complete; opened December 18, 2009)
*Last Phase: Renovation of paddock. (Complete; opened in May 2010)

Parx has over 3,200 slot machines. Electronic table games, such as roulette and blackjack, and video poker are also available.

Parx has 188 tables, offering games including blackjack, craps, roulette, and baccarat.

In January 2018, the Xcite Center and adjacent brand new poker room featuring over 48 tables opened in the main casino building as part of a $50 million expansion; poker was previously in the Parx East building. The poker room opened on January 11, 2018, while the Xcite Center opened on January 13, 2018.

<doc id="678337" wikidata="Q866741" url="?curid=678337" title="Chinatown, Vancouver">
<text>Chinatown is a neighbourhood in Vancouver, British Columbia, and is Canada&#x27;s largest Chinatown. Centred around Pender Street, it is surrounded by Gastown to the north, the Downtown financial and central business districts to the west, the Georgia Viaduct and the False Creek inlet to the south, the Downtown Eastside and the remnant of old Japantown to the northeast, and the residential neighbourhood of Strathcona to the southeast.

Due to the large ethnic Chinese presence in Vancouver—especially represented by mostly Cantonese-speaking multi-generation Chinese Canadians and first-generation immigrants from Hong Kong—the city has been referred to as &quot;Hongcouver&quot;. However, most immigration in recent years has been Mandarin-speaking residents from Mainland China. Chinatown remains a popular tourist attraction and is one of the largest historic Chinatowns in North America, but it experienced recent decline as newer members of Vancouver&#x27;s Chinese community dispersed to other parts of the metropolitan area.

==Geography==
The approximate borders of Chinatown as designated by the City of Vancouver are the alley between Pender and Hastings Streets, Georgia Street, Gore Avenue, and Taylor Street, although unofficially the area extends well into the rest of the Downtown Eastside. Main, Pender, and Keefer Streets are the principal areas of commercial activity.

==History==

=== Early immigration and head tax ===

Chinese immigrants, primarily men, first came to Vancouver in large numbers during the late 19th century, attracted in part by the British Columbia gold rush of 1858 and then the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. In the census of 1880–81, the total Chinese population in Canada was 4,383, of which the overwhelming majority (4,350) resided in British Columbia. By 1884, 17,000 Chinese immigrants had arrived in Canada to work on the railroad alone. The 1891 census counted 9,129 Chinese in Canada (8,910 in British Columbia), and the population at the 1901 census had increased to 16,792 in Canada (14,376 in British Columbia as an incomplete count). Of the estimated 16,000 Chinese immigrants in British Columbia in 1901, 2,715 lived in Victoria and another 2,011 lived in Vancouver.

After the completion of the railroad, under the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885, a head tax of per person was levied solely on Chinese immigrants to discourage further settlement; the head tax was raised to $100 in 1900 and then $500 in 1903.

By 1900, Chinatown covered the four square blocks bounded by Canton Alley (on the west), Hastings Street (on the north), Keefer Street (on the south), and Main Street (on the east, named Westminster Avenue at the time), with Pender Street (then called Dupont) as the main commercial district. During this time, Vancouver&#x27;s Red Light district was present in the area, undergoing routine police checks and attempts to clean up the area. By 1906, the Dupont brothels were forced to close. As a result, several brothels and businesses moved to two parallel dirt paved, dead-end lanes off of Dupont, West of Carrall: Shanghai Alley and Canton Alley. While these immigrants were dispersed throughout Chinatown, they strongly concentrated these areas. In 1896, the health officer for the City of Vancouver reported the city had to destroy houses in Chinatown &quot;owing to their filthy condition&quot; and that &quot;one could hardly pass through the [Chinatown] quarter without holding one&#x27;s nose.&quot; Another health officer noted &quot;The Chinese merchants and employers of labour endeavour to assist the health officials, and are, as a rule, willing to co-operate and help in this matter, but the lower classes of Chinese emigrants give a great deal of trouble unless constantly watched,&quot; concluding that continued immigration would lead to &quot;circumstances and conditions which predispose to infectious disease, and serve to spread it rapidly when once it is roused into activity.&quot; This perception only worsened with the turn of the district. Residents of the area where said to face continuous &quot;white hostility and discrimination&quot; due to three main vices, drug problems, gambling and sex work. As these perceptions grew, the discrimination turned to violence, resulting in a destructive raid in 1907 that caused irreversible damage to the area.

=== Clan societies and 1907 riot ===

As more people of Chinese heritage came to Vancouver, clan associations were formed to help the newcomers assimilate in their adopted homeland and to provide friendship and support. Clan societies were often formed around a shared surname lineage, county (e.g., Kaiping, Zhongshan), or other feature of identity.

Despite these efforts, discrimination against residents of the area continued to grow and eventually turned to violence. The Vancouver riots of September 1907 grew out of an anti-immigration rally being held by the Asiatic Exclusion League, resulting in significant damage to Chinatown businesses. 2,000 Chinese immigrants were displaced from their homes, and total property damage resulting from the actions of the mob of 10,000 was estimated at $15,000. One news report speculated the riot was held to intimidate a visiting Japanese delegate. Another blamed the presence of American agitators. Mackenzie King, then the Deputy Minister of Labour, was dispatched to investigate the riot and recommended the disbursement of $36,000 in compensation.

The head tax was repealed via the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which instead abolished Chinese immigration to Canada entirely, except in limited circumstances.

===Late 20th century improvements===
In 1979, the Chinatown Historic Area Planning Committee sponsored a streetscape improvement program to add various Chinese-style elements to the area, such as specially paved sidewalks and red dragon streetlamps that demarcated the area&#x27;s borders while emphasizing it as a destination for heritage tourism. Starting with its designation by the province as a historic area in 1971 and subsequent economic shifts, Chinatown shifted from a central business district to playing a largely cultural role. Murality, a local non-profit, is installing a mural on East Pender Street with the aim of bringing colour and vitality to the neighbourhood.

The growth of Chinatown during much of the 20th century created a healthy, robust community that gradually became an aging one as many Chinese immigrants no longer lived nearby. Noticing local businesses suffering, the Chinatown Merchants Association cited the lack of parking and restrictive heritage district rules as impediments to new uses and renovations. Their concerns subsequently led to a relaxation of zoning laws to allow for a wider range of uses, including necessary demolition. Additions in the mid-1990s included a large parkade, a shopping mall, and the largest Chinese restaurant in Canada. More residential projects around the community and a lowering of property taxes helped to maintain a more rounded community. Reinvigoration was a discussed topic along government members, symbolically embedded in the Millennium Gate project, which opened in 2002.

===Recent immigration===
In addition to Han Chinese from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Mainland China, Chinese Latin Americans have also settled in the Chinatown area. Most of them were from Peru and arrived shortly after Juan Velasco Alvarado took over that country in a military coup in 1968. Others have come from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Nicaragua.

Vancouver experienced large numbers of immigrants from the Asia-Pacific region in the last two decades of the twentieth century, most notably from China, whose population in the Vancouver Census Metropolitan Area was estimated at 300,000 in the mid-1990s.

==Businesses and development==

Chinatown is becoming more prosperous as new investment and old traditional businesses flourish. Today the neighbourhood features many traditional restaurants, banks, markets, clinics, tea shops, clothing stores, and other shops catering to the local community and tourists alike. The Vancouver office of &quot;Sing Tao Daily&quot;, one of the city&#x27;s four Chinese-language dailies, remains in Chinatown. OMNI British Columbia (formerly Channel M) had its television studio in Chinatown from 2003 to 2010. Vancouver Film School also has a satellite location in Chinatown. A bar &amp; nightclub known as ‘Fortune Sound Club’ is situated within the heart of Chinatown.

Chinatown&#x27;s businesses today predominantly consist of those selling lower-order, working-class goods, such as groceries, tea shops, and souvenir stores. While some businesses, such as restaurants, stand out, they are no longer the only Chinese food establishments in the city, a shift that contributed to a visible decline in foot traffic and nighttime activity in Chinatown. As the vacancy rate in Chinatown currently stands at 10%, it has been acknowledged that Chinatown needs a new approach to development, since some businesses have relocated to suburban shopping centres while others simply retired or went out of business. Examples include the closing of some restaurants and shops, sometimes in instances where the family did not have successors or where the business could not sustain itself any longer. Although there is a considerable business vacancy, Chinatown lease rates are considered the cheapest in the city, at $15–$30 per square foot—about one-tenth of the asking price on Vancouver&#x27;s Downtown Robson Street, the city&#x27;s upscale shopping district.

The new Chinatown business plan encourages new entrepreneurs to move in—and has attracted a longboard store and German sausage shop—as ways of restoring storefronts and bringing in a younger crowd, and to make higher-income people more comfortable in the area. Attracted to the lower rent and the building&#x27;s heritage status, younger businesses have moved in, often with white owners who also live in apartments above the shops. The general consensus is that Chinatown&#x27;s priority is to attract people of all backgrounds to Chinatown, and it is believed that the opening of non-traditional stores will bring a new flow of energy and income to the streets. As a result, the commercial activity is becoming more diversified, dotted with Western chain stores. Other additions include vintage stores, two art galleries, bars, and a nightclub, built on the site of the former Ming&#x27;s restaurant, in an attempt to bring something of a nightlife atmosphere, reminiscent of the 1950s and 1960s, back to the neighbourhood. The diversity of new shops and businesses is believed to be necessary in creating a new image for Chinatown in order to bring vibrancy back to the area and encourage commercial activities in general, and as a way to compete with suburban districts as well as nearby Gastown and Downtown Vancouver.

===Chinatown Revitalization Action Plan===
The Chinatown Historic Area planning committee, along with AECOM Economics, a US-based planning firm, helped to prepare a Chinatown Revitalization Action Plan for Vancouver&#x27;s planning department in November 2011. Vancouver planners surveyed 77 businesses and found that 64% reported a decrease in revenue between 2008 and 2011. The majority of consumers, 58%, were local residents, with 21% coming from elsewhere in the Lower Mainland. Tourist spending accounted for only 12% of Chinatown customers.

===Condominium development===
Vancouver city councillors voted in 2011 to raise building height restrictions in Chinatown in order to boost its population density. A limit of 9 stories for most of the neighbourhood was set, with a maximum of 15 stories on the busiest streets.

==Architecture==
The neighbourhood was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2011.

Ongoing efforts at revitalization include efforts by the business community to improve safety by hiring private security, considering new marketing promotions, and introducing residential units into the neighbourhood by restoring and renovating heritage buildings. The current focus is on the restoration and adaptive reuse of the distinctive association buildings.

===Gates===

The China Gate (next to the Chinese Cultural Centre, near the intersection with Carrall) facing Pender Street was donated to the City of Vancouver by the Government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China following the Expo 86 world&#x27;s fair, where it was on display. After being displayed for almost 20 years at its current location, the gate was rebuilt and received a major renovation of its façade employing stone and steel. Funding for the renovation came from government and private sources; the renovated gate was unveiled during the October 2005 visit of Guangdong governor Huang Huahua.

This is not to be confused with the larger Millennium Gate, which straddles Pender Street at the west end of Chinatown, near the intersection with Taylor Street. The Millennium Gate was approved on September 20, 2001, and erected in 2002 at the same site as a temporary wooden arch built to celebrate the 1901 royal tour by the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and York. Joe Y. Wai designed the Millennium Gate.

===Neon signs===

Chinatown was once known for its neon signs, but like the rest of the city, lost many signs to changing times and a sign bylaw passed in 1974. The last of these was the Ho Ho sign (which showed a rice bowl and chop sticks), which was removed in 1997.

A large tall neon sign was approved for the Chinatown Plaza parkade project in 2008 under the City of Vancouver&#x27;s Great Beginnings initiative. The new sign was installed in March 2010.

In 2017, a neon sign featuring a large green and yellow-coloured rooster for the Sai Woo Restaurant was installed on Pender Street. The new owner of the Sai Woo was made aware of the original sign that hung outside the earlier incarnation of the restaurant (1925–59) from a one-second clip from a movie of a 1958 parade in Chinatown, and launched a search for the original sign which was unsuccessful. The sign was recreated from the archived footage. At the same time, plans were announced to relight the tall Ho Ho sign in 2018 or 2019.

===Laozi Mural===
Vancouver&#x27;s Laozi (also referred to &quot;Lao Tzu&quot; and &quot;Lao Tsu&quot;, 老子) mural is located on the Western wall of the Lee&#x27;s Association building, at the corner of Gore Avenue and Pender Street, on the boundary of Chinatown. The mural was unveiled on October 2, 2010, by the Mayor of the City of Vancouver, Gregor Robertson. as part of the celebration of the 125 years of Vancouver&#x27;s Chinatown. The mural is featured in multiple lists of notable Vancouver murals.

It was designed by Kenson Seto and painted by Alex Li &amp; Falk. The mural is 223 square metres, and cost $18,000 which was split between the City of Vancouver and Lee&#x27;s Association of Vancouver. It was defaced multiple times by graffiti, causing outrage in the community.

On April 5, 2016, the City of Vancouver rezoned the lot at 303 E Pender St/450 Gore Avenue, allowing construction of a six-story building that hid the mural from sight. The building, marketed as Brixton Flats was designed by architect Gair Williamson and developed by GMC Projects Inc., whose website features an image of the Laozi mural. 

Vancouver City Council added a condition to the rezoning: &quot;Design development to create a new mural to reflect the character and history of Chinatown;Note to Applicant: The intent is not to recreate the existing mural, but rather to seek a viable opportunity to create a new mural of a suitable size and location on the building, including possible location on the eastern side of the building.&quot;The developer is studying the possibility of painting a smaller version of the original mural on the new building.

<doc id="678341" wikidata="Q503101" url="?curid=678341" title="John Jensen">
<text>John Jensen (; born 3 May 1965), nicknamed Faxe (), is a Danish football manager and former player.

A former midfielder, his playing career lasted almost two entire decades, including a stint with Arsenal in England and three stints with Brøndby IF in Denmark. He scored four goals in 69 caps for the Denmark national team, entering Danish footballing folklore during the 1992 European Championship tournament, when he scored the opening goal in Denmark&#x27;s 2–0 victory over Germany in the final.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Jensen started his career at Brøndby IF, and was an important part of the team which won the Danish championship in 1987, crowned by a call-up to the Denmark national team and the Danish &quot;Player of the Year&quot; award in 1987. After impressing in the UEFA Euro 1988, he spent a brief, unhappy spell in the Bundesliga team Hamburger SV, and was back with Brøndby in March 1990, where he took part in the club&#x27;s successful 1991 UEFA Cup campaign which reached the semi-final of the tournament.

===Arsenal===
In July 1992 Jensen was signed by George Graham for Arsenal in a £1.1 million deal to succeed Leeds United bound David Rocastle in central midfield, after a bid to sign Geoff Thomas from Crystal Palace failed.

In his first season at Highbury, after making his Arsenal League debut on the opening day of the season versus Norwich City, he struggled at first to make any sort of impact within the English game and, although a great tackler and a work rate second to none, he found the pace of the Premier League too frenzied. He missed the 1993 Football League Cup Final versus Sheffield Wednesday but bounced back to put in two sterling performances in the FA Cup Final against the same opposition two months later.

In 1993-94, he was of paramount importance to the side. His bustling, combative style was a vital influence in Arsenals midfield, until a knee ligament injury he received in an international friendly match with Denmark versus Hungary, which resulted him missing the 1994 European Cup Winners Cup Final, after playing in all previous ties. Along with Ian Wright he was later granted a medal.

In 1994-95, although playing in 24 League games he had to endure the pain of missing yet another European Cup Winners Cup Final when not selected by caretaker Stewart Houston.

Jensen also scored his first and only goal for Arsenal on his 98th appearance, against Queens Park Rangers on 31 December 1994. Officially, though, he also scored a shootout goal against his friend Peter Schmeichel of Manchester United in the 1993 FA Charity Shield.

On 21 February 1995 George Graham, who had led Arsenal to six trophies in eight seasons, lost his job after a Premier League inquiry found he had accepted an illegal £425,000 payment from Norwegian agent Rune Hauge following Arsenal’s recruiting of Pål Lydersen and Jensen, two of Hauge’s clients.

14 February 1996 Jensen played his last game for Arsenal in the League Cup semi-final versus Aston Villa, and left Highbury in March 1996, after 138 competitive appearances for the club.

===Return to Denmark===
After leaving Arsenal he rejoined his old club, Brøndby IF. In 1999, he moved on to Herfølge, where he was part of the squad that won the 1999–2000 Danish Superliga.

==International career==
Jensen scored four goals in 69 appearances for the Denmark national team between 1987 and 1995. When he appeared at Euro 1992, he scored the first goal in the Final of an eventual 2–0 victory against Germany.

During the years he spent at Arsenal, Jensen scored two goals in 21 games for the Denmark national team: one against Albania in 1993 and one against Belgium in 1994.

==Coaching career==
Jensen retired from full-time playing in 1999 and accepted the job of player/manager at Herfølge BK, a small Danish club, and immediately made a name for himself by winning the Danish Superliga on his first attempt. However, Herfølge&#x27;s success was short-lived, and they were relegated from the Superliga in the 2001 season. Jensen&#x27;s reputation with his old club was good enough to secure him a move back to Brøndby IF, as assistant manager to Michael Laudrup, a position he held until June 2006, when Jensen and Laudrup did not extend their contracts with the club.

When Laudrup in 2007 was named new manager at Spanish side Getafe, Jensen followed him as assistant manager. Laudrup quit Getafe after only one season, taking Jensen with him. On 12 January 2009, Jensen started as manager of Danish Superliga side Randers FC. On 6 October 2009, Jensen was sacked from Randers FC after a series of nine losses and two draws in 11 matches.

On 12 January 2011, he signed a six-month contract with Blackburn Rovers to become assistant manager and work alongside Steve Kean. On 23 May 2011, he signed a new deal one-year deal to remain as Steve Kean&#x27;s assistant at Blackburn.

On 29 September 2011, he left Blackburn Rovers.

On 11 October 2012, he was appointed consultant for Brøndby IF by manager Auri Skarbalius.

On 27 May 2014, he was named new manager of Danish club Fremad Amager replacing Tim Ilsø.

In September 2018, it was announced that Jensen would take temporary charge of the Denmark national team for their replacement team&#x27;s friendly match against Slovakia, following a dispute between the Danish Football Union and players, which also involved incumbent head coach Åge Hareide. &quot;When I say yes to help it&#x27;s because I feel very strongly for the national team as an institution, and because the most important thing must be that the games will be played after all&quot;, said Jensen.

<doc id="678353" wikidata="Q1063096" url="?curid=678353" title="Wagashi">
<text>is traditional Japanese confectionery, typically made using plant-based ingredients and with an emphasis on seasonality. &quot;Wagashi&quot; generally makes use of cooking methods that pre-date Western influence in Japan. It is often served with green tea.

Most of today&#x27;s wagashi was born during the Edo period (1603–1868). This was a period of peace, economic and cultural prosperity, and increased domestic self-sufficiency in sugar.
During the Edo period, a type of wagashi called were made by kneading white bean paste, gyūhi, sugar, yams, and other ingredients, and formed into various colors and shapes based on seasonal flowers, animals, nature, events, customs, and other themes.

== Definition ==

In Japan, the word for sweets or confectionery, , originally referred to fruits and nuts. Fruits and nuts may be eaten as snacks between meals and served as &quot;sweets&quot; during a tea ceremony. The word &quot;Wa&quot; means &quot;Japanese&quot;, and &quot;kashi&quot; becomes &quot;gashi&quot; in compound words, &quot;wagashi&quot; therefore means &quot;Japanese confectionery&quot;.

In 1603, the first year of the Edo period (1603–1868), the term meant both confectionery and fruit, and was more commonly used to refer to fruit. For example, the Japanese-Portuguese dictionary of the time describes &quot;quaxi&quot; (菓子) as &quot;fruit, especially fruit eaten after a meal.&quot; The term , which is used to refer to fruit today, is a remnant of the same term.

The word &quot;wagashi&quot; was coined at the end of 1800s to distinguish Japanese confectionery from sweets, cakes and baked goods introduced from the West termed &quot;yōgashi&quot; (洋菓子). However, &quot;wagashi&quot; was not the common term for Japanese confectionery until after the Second World War.

The definition of wagashi is ambiguous, and the line between wagashi and other types of Japanese confectionery is vague. For example, although the original was introduced from Portugal, it has been around for more than 400 years and has been modified to suit Japanese tastes, so it is classified as a wagashi. , created in 2014, was developed by a wagashi shop as a derivative of and is recognized as a wagashi in Japan. In recent years, wagashi shops have developed and marketed many confections that are an eclectic mix of wagashi and Western confections, often referred to as &quot;neo-wagashi&quot;.

==History==
=== Before the Edo period ===
==== Jomon - Nara period ====
It is believed that the first food eaten as a confection in Japan was a processed food from the Jomon period. It is thought to have been either a food made by kneading chestnuts into a powder and then baking and hardening it with eggs and salt, or a food made by adding animal flesh to chestnut flour and baking and hardening it.

During the Yayoi period, were made from grain or rice flour.
During the Nara period (710–794), a food called was brought to Japan from the Tang dynasty. This food consisted mostly of powdered kneaded rice, wheat, soybeans, and azuki beans, seasoned with sweet miso paste, and fried in oil as the main ingredient. It was prized as a ritual food in various forms, but later fell into disuse in Japan and is now used as an offering to the Buddha in modern Buddhism. Sugar was introduced to Japan around 750, but it was not until 850 years later, around the Edo period, that sugar-based wagashi began to be widely produced.

==== Heian - Muromachi period ====
The first beautifully crafted confections were created in the Heian period (794–1185) and are mentioned in The Tale of Genji under the names and . Tsubakimochi was originally a confection that was not fried in oil, which was unusual among karakudamono, but it was later changed to suit the tastes of the Japanese people. In the beginning, it was a mochi made by coating rice flour with a sweetener made from the juice of boiled vine grass and wrapping it in camellia leaves. Later, the sweetener made from the juice of boiled vine grass was replaced by sugar, and the rice cake was filled with red bean paste. Confectionery of this period was food offered to the nobility.
During the Kamakura period (1185–1333), Japanese Buddhist monks who studied in the Song dynasty brought the tea culture to Japan, and the custom of eating confections with tea began in Japan.
The monks also introduced , a light meal, and the history book mentions , , and as . However, the manjū and yōkan brought to Japan by the monks were not sweets as we know them today, but were prepared in a completely different way. At that time, manjū was not confection, did not contain red bean paste, and were not sweet. The history book clearly describes manjū as a dish eaten with chopsticks along with soup and pickles. Later, manjū changed from a light meal to a confection to suit Japanese tastes. In the Muromachi period (1336–1573), depicted sweet manjū made with sugar. This manjū is considered the prototype of today&#x27;s manjū. Yōkan was a soup containing sheep meat, but since there was no custom of eating animal meat in Japan, the Japanese replaced the meat with a paste made of kneaded barley or azuki bean flour. Later, the soup was removed and replaced with a pasty confection made of barley or azuki bean flour. Finally, around 1800, during the Edo period (1603–1868), 500 years later, yōkan became what it is today. The invention of in the 1600s was essential to the birth of modern yokan. Later, the kanten invented in Japan was introduced to Manchuria, Korea and Taiwan. The udon was also very different from today&#x27;s udon, more like &quot;wonton&quot;. (餛飩).

==== Sengoku and Azuchi-Momoyama period ====

During the Sengoku period, the Portuguese brought Western confectionery to Japan through the Nanban trade. is a typical confection based on these Western confections. Kasutera was the only exception because it was made from chicken eggs, while Japanese confectionery was made from vegetable ingredients. To suit their own tastes, the Japanese added to the sponge cake to make it more moist, and , was added to the bottom of the sponge cake to give it a coarser texture. As trade increased, so did sugar imports. The prototype of was also brought to Japan through trade with Portugal and Spain. While Kompeitō, introduced from Portugal, was a sugar-coated confection with a poppy seed or sesame seed center, the Japanese eventually transformed it into an all-sugar confection with a center.

From the Sengoku period to the Azuchi-Momoyama period, wagashi developed along with the Japanese tea ceremony, and delicate, beautiful, and aesthetically pleasing confections began to emerge. The Japanese tea ceremony was used as a secret meeting place for and as a salon for the upper class.

=== Emergence of modern wagashi ===
During the Edo period, wagashi developed dramatically, establishing what we know today as wagashi. From the Keicho (1596–1615) to the Kan&#x27;ei era (1624–1644), classical Japanese literature and seasonal elegance began to be incorporated into wagashi brand names. During the Genroku era (1688–1704), when the Genroku culture flourished, wagashi with beautiful shapes and colors based on themes from classical literature and seasonal elegance began to be produced under the influence of the Rimpa school of art.

Self-sufficiency in sugar increased when Tokugawa Yoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa shogun, encouraged the production of sugar. In Sanuki Province, which is now Kagawa Prefecture, sugar called was produced. The common people began to eat wagashi that used a lot of sugar, and various types of wagashi were produced, especially in Kyoto. Local wagashi specialties began to be produced in various regions of Japan, and a wagashi culture blossomed throughout the country. The design of , a beautiful fresh confection with various shapes and colors that characterizes wagashi, was created and developed in Kyoto during this period and spread to all parts of Japan. The brand names and designs of these uniquely Japanese wagashi were compiled and recorded in picture books. The most famous of these is , which lists the brand names and designs of wagashi from each period of the Edo period in color illustrations.

The famous Kyoto wagashi was created in 1689 during the Genroku era (1688–1704) or in 1805 during the Bunka era (1804–1818).
The name Yatsuhashi comes from a scene in the Tale of Ise or from the musician Yatsuhashi Kengyo, and is made by steaming a mixture of rice flour, sugar, and cinnamon, stretching the dough thin, and baking it. Yatsuhashi is still a popular souvenir today, and according to a survey conducted by the city of Kyoto in 2022, 89.2% of Japanese tourists visiting Kyoto bought souvenirs, of which 10.7% bought Yatsuhashi.

==== Ame and amezaiku ====

During this time, became popular with the common people. The ingredients of common people&#x27;s sweets were often inexpensive grain-derived sweeteners rather than expensive sugar. Ame was so popular that many people came up with creative ways to sell it. Peddlers sold ame by performing various tricks while walking the streets of the city, displaying puppet (traditional Japanese mechanized puppets), and dressing up as women. In the Kan&#x27;ei era (1624–1644), peddlers began selling a variety of wagashi to the general public in addition to ame.

The production of , elaborate animal-shaped amezaiku, spread throughout the city beyond the previous temples along with the development of . The traditional Japanese scissors were indispensable for the production of amezaiku, and when the production of iron increased dramatically with the invention of the balance bellows in iron manufacturing (たたら製鉄), the production of scissors also increased, contributing to the production of amezaiku. During the Bunka (1804–1818) and Bunsei era (1818–1830), it was possible to obtain amezaiku with the same shape as today&#x27;s amezaiku.

==== Japan&#x27;s modernization and beyond ====

During the Meiji era (1868–1912), when Japan began active trade with the West after the end of its , Western cooking utensils were brought to Japan. With the advent of the 
modern oven, many baked confections such as and were born.

In the 21st century, wagashi continues to be created. , created in 1960, is a very popular souvenir of Kyoto. According to a survey conducted by the City of Kyoto in 2022, 89.2% of Japanese tourists who visited Kyoto bought souvenirs, of which 31.6% bought Nama yatsuhashi. This means that 42.3% of Japanese tourists who bought souvenirs in Kyoto in 2022 bought either Nama yatsuhashi or Yatsuhashi.

In 2014, a wagashi shop in Yamanashi Prefecture created a from and water. The popularity of this wagashi has spread outside of Japan, and derivative products have been created.

===Classification===
There are several ways to classify wagashi, including classification by moisture content, ingredients, and production method.
The most common classification method is based on moisture content, which is very important because it affects shelf life.
According to this classification, sweets with a moisture content of 30% or more are classified as , those with a moisture content of 10% to 30% are classified as , and those with a moisture content of less than 10% are classified as .

When classified by production method, each type of wagashi is classified as &quot;neri mono&quot;, which is made by kneading ingredients; &quot;mushi mono&quot;, which is made by steaming; &quot;yaki mono&quot;, which is made by baking; &quot;age mono&quot;, which is made by frying; &quot;nagashi mono&quot;, which is made by pouring ingredients into a mold; &quot;uchi mono&quot;, which is made by mixing powdered ingredients and sugar into a mold and then hardening the mixture; &quot;kake mono&quot;, which is made by pouring syrup over the ingredients; and &quot;ame mono&quot;, which is made by boiling down the sugar and hardening it, and so on.

For example, yōkan can be classified as either or , depending on the product, as the moisture content varies from product to product. It is also classified as &quot;nagashi mono&quot; because it is made by pouring into a mold and hardening it.

<text>In thermochemistry, the enthalpy of solution (heat of solution or enthalpy of solvation) is the enthalpy change associated with the dissolution of a substance in a solvent at constant pressure resulting in infinite dilution.

The enthalpy of solution is most often expressed in kJ/mol at constant temperature. The energy change can be regarded as being made up of three parts: the endothermic breaking of bonds within the solute and within the solvent, and the formation of attractions between the solute and the solvent. An ideal solution has a null enthalpy of mixing. For a non-ideal solution, it is an excess molar quantity.

==Energetics==
Dissolution by most gases is exothermic. That is, when a gas dissolves in a liquid solvent, energy is released as heat, warming both the system (i.e. the solution) and the surroundings. 

The temperature of the solution eventually decreases to match that of the surroundings. The equilibrium, between the gas as a separate phase and the gas in solution, will by Le Châtelier&#x27;s principle shift to favour the gas going into solution as the temperature is decreased (decreasing the temperature increases the solubility of a gas). 

When a saturated solution of a gas is heated, gas comes out of the solution.

==Steps in dissolution==
Dissolution can be viewed as occurring in three steps:
# Breaking solute–solute attractions (endothermic), for instance, lattice energy in salts.
# Breaking solvent–solvent attractions (endothermic), for instance, that of hydrogen bonding.
# Forming solvent–solute attractions (exothermic), in solvation.

The value of the enthalpy of solvation is the sum of these individual steps:
: formula_1

Dissolving ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic. The energy released by the solvation of the ammonium ions and nitrate ions is less than the energy absorbed in breaking up the ammonium nitrate ionic lattice and the attractions between water molecules. Dissolving potassium hydroxide is exothermic, as more energy is released during solvation than is used in breaking up the solute and solvent.

==Expressions in differential or integral form==
The expressions of the enthalpy change of dissolution can be differential or integral, as a function of the ratio of amounts of solute-solvent.

The molar differential enthalpy change of dissolution is
: formula_2
where is the infinitesimal variation, or differential, of the mole number of the solute during dissolution.

The integral heat of dissolution is defined as a process of obtaining a certain amount of solution with a final concentration. The enthalpy change in this process, normalized by the mole number of solute, is evaluated as the molar integral heat of dissolution. Mathematically, the molar integral heat of dissolution is denoted as
: formula_3

The prime heat of dissolution is the differential heat of dissolution for obtaining an infinitely diluted solution.

==Dependence on the nature of the solution==
The enthalpy of mixing of an ideal solution is zero by definition, but the enthalpy of dissolution of nonelectrolytes has the value of the enthalpy of fusion or vaporisation. For non-ideal solutions of electrolytes it is connected to the activity coefficient of the solute(s) and the temperature derivative of the relative permittivity through the following formula:
formula_4

<text>The Carte Manuscripts are archived historical papers collected by Thomas Carte (1686–1754). They are held in the Bodleian Library, at the University of Oxford, England.

Among Carte&#x27;s collection were many documents relating to the history of Ireland. Thomas Carte gave a first tranche of Irish papers to the Bodleian in 1753.

Carte&#x27;s papers were arranged for binding in 276 volumes in 1862, and in 1871 Charles William Russell and John Patrick Prendergast edited the eight-volume &quot;Report on the Carte Manuscripts in the Bodleian Library&quot;.

A catalogue of the Carte Papers is available via the Online Catalogues of Western Manuscripts at the Bodleian Library. A handwritten calendar of the Carte Papers, produced between 1878 and 1883, is available in the Library. The 1660-1687 section of the Carte Calendar is published online.

<doc id="678428" wikidata="Q2061990" url="?curid=678428" title="Rob Liefeld">
<text>Robert Liefeld (; born October 3, 1967) is an American comic book creator. A prominent writer and artist in the 1990s, he is known for co-creating the character Cable with writer Louise Simonson and the character Deadpool with writer Fabian Nicieza. In the early 1990s, Liefeld gained popularity due to his work on Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The New Mutants&quot; and later &quot;X-Force&quot;. In 1992, he and several other popular Marvel illustrators left the company to found Image Comics, which started a wave of comic books owned by their creators rather than by publishers. The first book published by Image Comics was Liefeld&#x27;s &quot;Youngblood&quot; #1.

Liefeld has been called one of the most controversial figures in the comic industry for his drawing skills, business practices, and controversial comments.

==Early life==
Rob Liefeld was born on October 3, 1967, in Fullerton, California, the younger child of a Baptist minister and a part-time secretary. He and his sister, seven years his senior, grew up in Anaheim, California.

Liefeld&#x27;s love of comics began as a child, which led early on to his decision to be a professional artist, a practice that began with his tracing artwork from comic books. As a high-school student, he took basic fundamental art courses, and attended comic book conventions at the nearby Disneyland Hotel, where he met creators such as George Pérez, John Romita Jr., Jim Shooter, Bob Layton, Mike Zeck and Marv Wolfman. Liefeld cites Pérez, along with John Byrne and Frank Miller, as major influences. He has also noted how the influence of Arthur Adams is visible in his art.

==Career==
===Early career===
After graduating from high school, Liefeld took life drawing classes at a local junior college, working odd jobs for about a year, including as a pizza delivery man and construction worker, while practicing his artwork, samples of which he sent to small comics publishers, as he was too intimidated to send them to the &quot;Big Two&quot; companies of Marvel Comics and DC Comics.
Among the editors he sent art samples around 1985 to Gary Carlson of Megaton Comics. Carlson was working on &quot;Megaton&quot; #4, and was looking for replacements for artists who had moved on to bigger projects. Liefeld&#x27;s submission packet consisted mostly of pinups of DC Comics characters like the Teen Titans and Legion of Super Heroes, as well as some sketches of Megaton characters. Some of these earlier pinups are visible on Liefeld&#x27;s website. Although Carlson thought Liefeld&#x27;s depictions of his characters was not sufficiently accurate, and exhibited what Carlson characterized as &quot;some goofy anatomy&quot;, he found Liefeld&#x27;s storytelling to be clear, and his rendering style evocative of the influence of artist George Pérez. Although Carlson liked Liefeld&#x27;s work overall, he felt the young artist was not ready for professional work. Weeks later he received another set of samples that were an improvement, and later still, a four-page Berserker story (not to be confused with the Marvel or Top Cow characters of the same name), along with pinups of the Megaton characters Ultragirl and Ultraman. Carlson used one of the pinups as the inside front cover to &quot;Megaton&quot; #5, and Liefeld&#x27;s Ultragirl pinup in the company&#x27;s Who&#x27;s Who-type reference book &quot;Megaton Explosion&quot; #1 (June 1987). The book also featured an entry for Liefeld&#x27;s own creation, a team of superheroes called Youngblood, the very first appearance of that team in print.

Carlson and his colleague Chris Ecker later met with the teenaged Liefeld, who at that point had not yet obtained his driver&#x27;s license, at the Ramada O&#x27;Hare Hotel, which was then the location of the Chicago ComiCon. Impressed with the artist&#x27;s enthusiasm and the new art samples he showed them, Carlson gave Liefeld a test script in order to judge his ability to draw a page-to-page comics story. Although Carlson was impressed with Liefeld&#x27;s layouts, the story was eventually drawn by Gary Thomas by the time it saw print in &quot;Megaton&quot; #7. Two months later Liefeld drew the team in an advertisement in &quot;Megaton&quot; #8 (August 1987), which indicated that it would next appear in &quot;Megaton Special&quot; #1, by Liefeld and writer Hank Kanalz, with a cover by artist Jerry Ordway. However, Megaton Comics went out of business before that could be printed.

===Success with DC Comics and Marvel Comics===
Learning from a friend of a comic book convention in San Francisco where a large number of editors would be in attendance, Liefeld and his friend drove several hours to San Francisco, where they stayed with his aunt and uncle. At the convention, he showed editors his samples and offered a package, which consisted of 10 pages of sequential art featuring his own characters. Editor Dick Giordano, to whom Liefeld showed his samples at the DC booth, requested that Liefeld send him more samples. Although Liefeld was apprehensive about approaching the Marvel booth, he did so at his friend&#x27;s urging, and as a result, editor Mark Gruenwald offered Liefeld a job illustrating an eight-page &quot;Avengers&quot; backup story featuring the Black Panther, much to the 19-year-old artist&#x27;s surprise. Though the published story was ultimately illustrated by another artist, Liefeld was later given character design work by the publisher. His first published story, was a DC Comics Bonus Book insert in &quot;Warlord&quot; #131 (September 1988). Editor Robert Greenberger recalled that Liefeld &quot;was discovered by my office-mate, Jonathan Peterson, who was scrambling to find something for him to do. I had the &quot;Warlord&quot; Bonus Book slot coming up, so to keep Rob from finding work at our rival, I tapped him for that.&quot; Next came the five-issue miniseries &quot;Hawk and Dove&quot; for DC Comics, the first issue of which was published with an October 1988 cover date. It was this work that first garnered Liefeld visibility among readers of mainstream comics. That same year, Liefeld drew &quot;Secret Origins&quot; #28.

Liefeld&#x27;s layouts for &quot;Hawk and Dove&quot; #5, which took place in a chaos dimension, were oriented sideways so that a reader would have to turn the comic book at a right angle to read them. Because this was done without prior editorial approval, editor Mike Carlin cut and pasted the panels into the proper order, and Karl Kesel lightboxed them onto DC comics paper to ink them. The letters column of &quot;Hawk and Dove&quot; #5 mentions that Liefeld &quot;showed something new to an editor who thought he&#x27;d seen everything.&quot; Liefeld explained this was how the dimension had been portrayed the only other time it had been shown. Kesel disputed this, asserting that this was the first time that dimension had been shown, but a 2007 article in Comic Book Resources pointed out that artist Erik Larsen had indeed portrayed that realm in this manner in &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; #14, which had been published three months prior.

Shortly thereafter, Liefeld began doing work for Marvel Comics as well, his first assignment for them being &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #23. In 1989, Liefeld became the penciller for the Marvel series &quot;The New Mutants&quot;, starting with issue #86. He is generally credited for turning this lowest-selling title of the &quot;X-Men&quot; franchise into a financial success, which underlined the increased popularity and clout that his stint on the title had earned him.

With &quot;The New Mutants&quot; #98, Liefeld assumed full creative control over the series, penciling, inking and plotting, with Fabian Nicieza writing dialog. The &quot;New Mutants&quot; series ended with issue 100, and was replaced with a revamped version of the team called &quot;X-Force&quot;, whose 1991 debut issue sold four million copies, setting an industry-wide record later broken by Chris Claremont and Jim Lee&#x27;s &quot;X-Men&quot; (vol. 2) #1. The sales numbers were propelled by 1990s direct market sales strategies: five variant edition trading cards were polybagged with &quot;X-Force&quot; #1 to encourage sales of multiple copies to single collectors, while &quot;X-Men&quot; #1 was sold with five variant covers. As of 2013, &quot;X-Force&quot; #1 remains the second highest-selling comic book in history.

In mid-1990, Levi&#x27;s began producing a series of TV commercials directed by Spike Lee for their 501 button fly jeans, which included an onscreen 800 number that viewers who worked in unique jobs could call in order to appear in the company&#x27;s commercials. After calling the number and leaving a message describing himself and his career, Liefeld appeared in one of the commercials, in which Lee interviews Liefeld about his career and his creation, &quot;X-Force&quot;.

Liefeld was subsequently interviewed by Stan Lee in the second episode of the 1991 documentary series &quot;The Comic Book Greats&quot;, in which he discussed how he broke into the industry, demonstrated his drawing technique, and talked about his Levi&#x27;s commercial.

===Leaving Marvel Comics, co-founding Image Comics===
Liefeld&#x27;s relationship with Marvel began to break down in 1991 when he announced plans in a black-and-white advertisement in the &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; to publish an original title with competitor Malibu Comics. The exact title is unknown, but according to journalist Michael Dean, it was something to the effect of &quot;The X-Cutioners&quot;, a title whose similarity to Marvel&#x27;s X-Men family of titles evoked the ire of Marvel editor Bob Harras, who threatened to fire Liefeld if he used that title.
Liefeld and several other popular young artists including Jim Lee, Todd McFarlane, Erik Larsen, Whilce Portacio, Jim Valentino and Marc Silvestri left Marvel in 1992 to form Image Comics. Each co-founder formed his own studio under the Image banner, such as Liefeld&#x27;s Extreme Studios. Liefeld&#x27;s superhero team series &quot;Youngblood&quot;, which is partially a derivative of a 1991 &quot;Teen Titans&quot; series Liefeld had proposed to DC Comics, was the first comic Image published. He appeared on an episode of &quot;The Dennis Miller Show&quot; to promote the book.

The series&#x27; first issue met with negative reception from fans and critics for the unclear storytelling effected not only by Liefeld&#x27;s art, but by the book&#x27;s flip format, which some readers found confusing, as well as the book&#x27;s poor anatomy; incorrect perspective; non-existent backgrounds; poor dialogue and the late shipping of the book, a problem that continued with subsequent issues. In an interview in &quot;Hero Illustrated&quot; #4 (October 1993), Liefeld conceded disappointment with the first four issues of &quot;Youngblood&quot;, calling the first issue a &quot;disaster&quot;. Liefeld explained that production problems, as well as sub-par scripting by his friend and collaborator Hank Kanalz, whose employment Liefeld later terminated, resulted in work that was lower in quality than that which Liefeld produced when Fabian Nicieza scripted his plots on &quot;X-Force&quot;, and that reprints of those four issues would be re-scripted. Writer and &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot; columnist Peter David pointed to Liefeld&#x27;s scapegoating of Kanalz as an example of Liefeld&#x27;s failure to take responsibility for his project, and evidence that genuine collaboration with good writers like Louise Simonson and Fabian Nicieza, which some of the Image founders did not appreciate, had previously reflected better on Liefeld&#x27;s art.

Other titles produced by Liefeld&#x27;s Extreme Studios during the 1990s included &quot;Brigade&quot;, &quot;Bloodstrike&quot;, &quot;Glory&quot;, &quot;Prophet&quot;, &quot;Supreme&quot;, &quot;Team Youngblood&quot;, &quot;Youngblood Strikefile&quot;, &quot;Troll&quot;, &quot;New Men&quot; and &quot;Avengelyne&quot;.

In 1996, Liefeld&#x27;s and Lee&#x27;s studios signed with Marvel to re-envision several of the company&#x27;s core series, an event called &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot;. Liefeld was contracted to write twelve issues of &quot;The Avengers&quot;, co-written with Jeph Loeb, and was to pencil twelve issues of &quot;Captain America.&quot; Due to disappointing sales, Marvel terminated the agreement after six issues, and reassigned the two series to Lee&#x27;s studio, one of the most controversial episodes in Liefeld&#x27;s career.

===Departure from Image===
In June 1996, Marc Silvestri temporarily left Image with his Top Cow imprint over conflicts with Liefeld, with Image Comics executive director Larry Marder saying that Liefeld &quot;was making an increasing number of business decisions that were counterproductive to being a business partner.&quot; In early September, Liefeld issued a press release stating he was resigning his position at Image and leaving the group. Nearly simultaneously, the other Image partners issued a press release stating that they had fired Liefeld. His resignation came only minutes before the second meeting that would have forced him out. Liefeld moved all his publishing ventures into a new company, Awesome Comics. This new enterprise, announced in April 1997 as a partnership between Liefeld and Malibu Comics founding partner Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, concentrated its efforts on newer properties.

===Awesome Comics===
After leaving &quot;Captain America&quot;, Liefeld attempted to buy the rights to Fighting American, a similarly patriotically themed 1954 character from Captain America&#x27;s creators, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby. The still-living Simon and Kirby&#x27;s widow agreed to a figure Liefeld felt was too high, and he created a new similar character, Agent America. Simon threatened to sue, and the parties renegotiated a deal acceptable to all. Marvel Comics then sued Liefeld, who was allowed to use the character but not have him throw his shield weapon, a distinctive trait of Captain America.

Liefeld also hired comic book writer Alan Moore to revive many of Liefeld&#x27;s creations. Moore wrote a few issues of &quot;Youngblood&quot; and &quot;Glory,&quot; but his most lauded work for Liefeld was on &quot;Supreme&quot;, for which Moore won the 1997 Eisner Award for Best Writer.

Awesome&#x27;s initial releases included new properties like &quot;Kaboom!&quot;, created by Jeff Matsuda. Awesome ceased operation in 2000 due to the departure of its primary investor.

===2000s work===

In the 2000s, Liefeld returned to his former characters in the X-Men franchise, providing pencils for &quot;Cable&quot; and &quot;X-Force&quot; until the early 2000s, when both were canceled.

In 2004, he reunited with Fabian Nicieza for an &quot;X-Force&quot; limited series and illustrated the early covers for Nicieza&#x27;s &quot;Cable and Deadpool&quot;. In that same year, Liefeld formed Arcade Comics and once again announced plans to revive &quot;Youngblood&quot;. These involved reprinting older material and providing the art for two new series: &quot;Youngblood: Bloodsport&quot; with Mark Millar and &quot;Youngblood: Genesis&quot; with Brandon Thomas. Although the former only published one issue, Liefeld expressed hopes to finish the series.

Liefeld and writer Jeph Loeb returned to the Heroes Reborn Universe with &quot;Onslaught Reborn&quot;, a five-issue limited series that premiered in November 2006. It met with poor reviews.

In 2007, Liefeld and writer Robert Kirkman collaborated on a revival of &quot;Killraven&quot;. Although five issues of the series were finished, the project was cancelled without any of them being printed.

In July 2007, it was announced that Rob Liefeld and Youngblood would be returning to Image Comics after years of self-publication. This new partnership marks the first time in a decade that Liefeld and Image would collaborate on a project. This &quot;Youngblood&quot; series was written by Joe Casey with art by Derec Donovan and Val Staples, and covers by Liefeld. It debuted in January 2008. Liefeld took over writing and art duties with issue #9, though that would be the series&#x27; final issue. To commemorate the event, and the 15th anniversary of Image Comics, the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con was headlined by the Image Founders panel, where all seven of the original Image Comics founders appeared on stage together.

===2010s work===

2010 saw Liefeld return to the Deadpool character, first by penciling issue #1 of the &quot;Prelude to Deadpool Corps&quot; series, the issue focusing on Lady Deadpool. Liefeld became the regular artist on &quot;Deadpool Corps&quot;, providing interior art for the first nine issues.

In March 2011, Liefeld was announced as the artist on &quot;The Infinite&quot;, a mini-series written by Robert Kirkman. In January 2012, this project was canceled by Liefeld after Kirkman&#x27;s studio, Skybound, disagreed on the work of a new inker Liefeld hired to draw 14 of the pages in issue #5, which Liefeld re-inked as a result.

In June 2011, he was announced as the artist on a new &quot;Hawk and Dove&quot; series, with writer Sterling Gates, as part of The New 52, DC Comics&#x27; relaunch of their entire superhero line, returning Liefeld to the characters that helped establish him in the industry. When that book was canceled as of issue #8, Liefeld was hired to take over three other titles: &quot;Grifter&quot;, &quot;Deathstroke&quot; and &quot;The Savage Hawkman&quot;, plotting all three, while also writing and drawing &quot;Deathstroke&quot;. Though he indicated in July 2012 that he would stay on the titles for a run that would end in 2013, he abruptly quit DC Comics in late August 2012, announcing that the #0 issues to be published in September would be his last. Though Liefeld characterized his experience on The New 52 as a positive one, he did not disguise his animosity toward editor Brian Smith, with whom his clashes were among his reasons for leaving the company. Other reasons he cited were frequent rewrites of his material, and the overall corporate culture that was more prevalent now that both DC and Marvel were owned by large media conglomerates. Liefeld also referred to Scott Clark&#x27;s artwork on &quot;Grifter&quot; as &quot;crap&quot;. Liefeld indicated that he would return to focusing on his creator-owned properties at Image, including &quot;Bloodstrike&quot;, &quot;Brigade&quot;, as well as other projects yet to be specified. In response to these events, artist Pete Woods defended DC editorial, stating that the restrictions placed on creators was the result of a plan they had for all 52 of their titles that required them to be consistent with one another. Editor Tom Brevoort and writer Gail Simone defended Brian Smith, disputing Liefeld&#x27;s characterization of him, leading to a heated exchange on Twitter between Liefeld and Brevoort, and eventually head &quot;Batman&quot; writer Scott Snyder as well.

In 2011–2012 Liefeld returned to his earlier creator-owned characters, with new books written and illustrated by other writers and artists. These included a new &quot;Avengelyne&quot; ongoing series debut at Image Comics under the creative team of Mark Poulton and Owen Gieni, a &quot;Bloodstrike&quot; series written by Tim Seeley, a &quot;Glory&quot; series written by Joe Keatinge and illustrated by Sophie Campbell, and a &quot;Prophet&quot; series written by Brandon Graham that garnered critical acclaim. He also published revivals of &quot;Youngblood&quot; with writer John McLaughlin with artist Jon Malin and &quot;Supreme&quot; by Erik Larsen in 2012.

In August 2012 Liefeld generated controversy by posting a tweet in which he said of his creation, Deadpool, and the creators who worked on the character:

The comment was met with criticism by industry professionals who pointed to the esteemed creators who had worked on the character that Liefeld was apparently calling &quot;D-list&quot; creators. Among these critics was Rich Johnston of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot;, who pointed out that some of these past creators included Joe Kelly, Ed McGuinness, Joe Madureira, Gail Simone, David Lapham and Kyle Baker. Artist Dave Johnson, who had also worked on the character, referenced a video Liefeld posted on the Web a year earlier of him inking a comics page while driving, by saying, &quot;Yes!!! I&#x27;ve been elevated to the &#x27;D list&#x27; of talent. Thanks Rob. Now if I can only learn how to ink while driving a car.&quot; Then-Marvel Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso also referenced other creators who had worked on Deadpool, including Gerry Duggan, Brian Posehn, and Tony Moore, saying, &quot;Welcome to the D-list, @GerryDuggan @thebrianposehn @tonymoore! Howdy Doody just put your name on the list.&quot; Writer Rick Remender, another veteran of books featuring Deadpool, stated, &quot;Lot of talented people you just called out as D-list. Might be a better way to congratulate yourself?&quot; Liefeld defended his statement in subsequent tweets posted that day, tweeting, &quot;Truth hurts. Did I miss the Brubaker Deadpool arc? The Millar Deadpool arc? The Loeb Deadpool arc. Get over yourself. The flip of my statement is that Marvel doesn&#x27;t feature their prize talent on Dpool and the character does well-Mostly newbies, hence D-list&quot;. Liefeld stated that his point was that &quot;heavy contract players&quot; at Marvel such as Leinil Francis Yu, Steve McNiven, Arthur Adams, and Olivier Coipel did not produce regular monthly books featuring the character. On March 3, Liefeld apologized for his comments, saying, &quot;As a parent I tell my kids it costs nothing to apologise, so here goes: I apologise and am truly sorry to everyone I insulted with my D-list comments. I said it and can&#x27;t take it back.&quot; Liefeld stated that his original complaint was that Marvel tended to rely on new and unproven talent on Deadpool, and not to attack creators such as the then-new team of Posehn, Duggan, and Moore.

Liefeld made a cameo appearance in the 2016 film based on his most famous creation, &quot;Deadpool&quot;, which was released in February 2016. In an interview that month, Liefeld stated that he was working on the graphic novel &quot;Deadpool: Bad Blood&quot;, which was set for release later that year. In 2017, it was reported by Deadline that Liefeld was working with Akiva Goldsman and Graham King on a seven-figure movie deal for his Extreme Universe.

In June 2019, Liefeld reacted to the sweeping editorial changes that occurred at DC Comics in the aftermath of a controversial printing error on &quot;Batman Damned&quot; #1 with a set of two tweets in which he stated, &quot;DC Comics gonna drive off a cliff here real soon ... gotta get my popcorn ... I ain&#x27;t never seen a company in as much disarray as DC Comics. Thank God they have Batman to act as their Tylenol, , laughing gas ... &#x27;more Batman will fix it! When writer Mark Millar expressed skepticism of this prediction, pointing to DC&#x27;s strong lineup, Liefeld replied that Millar&#x27;s assessment was a dated one that had not been true since the 1980s. Liefeld further tweeted, &quot;I understand my DC honesty will cost me a potential opportunity but who cares! C&#x27;mon... they should fire everybody in management and refresh. Batman will still be there for the next group ... And Jim Lee could finally draw the X-Men for you again!!! Wins all around!!&quot; Liefeld eventually deleted the initial two tweets, but they nonetheless prompted a series of arguments between Liefeld and users who criticized him for his remarks. This was followed by Liefeld&#x27;s concession that neither Marvel nor DC were in any danger of shutting down, and his announcement that he was ending his Twitter account, and would be using Instagram.

===2020s work===
In July 2020 IDW Publishing released the first issue of &quot;Snake Eyes: Deadgame&quot;, a G.I. Joe-related series co-written by Liefeld and Chad Bowers, and penciled by Liefeld, Adelso Corona, and Neil Vyetake. Around that same time, Liefeld began a podcast on iTunes, Spotify and Podbean called &quot;Robservations&quot;, in which he talks about different topics pertaining to the comics industry.

On October 12, 2023, Liefeld debuted on his Instagram account a proof of concept trailer for &quot;Bloodstrike&quot;, based on the Image Comics series he had debuted in 1993 as a spinoff of &quot;Youngblood&quot;. &quot;Bloodstrike&quot; features a squad of assassins, each of whom is a super-powered operative who died in the line of duty and was resurrected by a secret government program called Project Born Again. The short was directed by Philip J. Silvera, who had met Liefeld during production of the 2016 &quot;Deadpool&quot; film, on which Silvera had served as a stunt coordinator and second unit director. Over the years, interest had been expressed in the property by individuals such as Akiva Goldsman and Graham King, and production companies such as Netflix, which optioned the development rights, but these eventually expired without any produced results. Liefeld explained in the caption that accompanied the trailer that he released it in the hopes of spurring renewed interest in producing a &quot;Bloodstrike&quot; film, saying, &quot;When taking a comic book from page to screen there are always hurdles, screenplay, screenwriters, talent that attach and move on. It gets old really fast.&quot; Liefeld hoped the film would be directed by Silvera, whom Liefeld said had expressed not only a significant knowledge of comics, but a passion for the characters of Liefeld&#x27;s Extreme Studios. According to Liefeld, Silvera had also expressed a commitment during the COVID-19 pandemic to make a &quot;Bloodstrike&quot; film after his commitments at the time were fulfilled, beginning with the trailer.

On February 5, 2024, Liefeld announced on Twitter that after producing one final Deadpool comic to be published later that year, he was retiring from writing or drawing the character, stating, &quot;I am retiring from Deadpool. It&#x27;s official. Yup, after 33 years of not only introducing Deadpool but chronicling many of his most popular adventures it&#x27;s time for the Deadpool Daddy to say farewell. One of the fun parts about getting older is you can retire from things, so here I am.&quot; Liefeld cited his age as a reason for his decision, explaining, &quot;In case you are wondering, why now? That&#x27;s easy, I&#x27;ll be 57 at the end of this and my eyes are still functioning, the work continues to be strong, I want to go out with the best effort I can muster. The hand-eye coordination won’t be there forever.&quot;

In the February 3, 2025 episode of his podcast, &quot;Robservations&quot;, and a follow-up interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Liefeld stated that he had severed ties with Marvel, following perceived slights at the July premiere in New York of &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;. Specifically, Liefeld learned that he and his family were not invited to the afterparty, despite having attended such events in the past, which Liefeld said &quot;was meant to embarrass, diminish, defeat me.&quot; He also said that he had been ignored by top Disney officials, including Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige, despite the fact that Feige had been standing near Liefeld. In addition, Liefeld said he posed for professional photos with members of the film&#x27;s production, but later was told by his publicist that those photos had been deleted. He perceived the photos to have been taken as a courtesy only, without any intention of being published, though &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s Aaron Couch said that other photos of Liefeld and his family were used in Disney&#x27;s Getty press portal from the event. Liefeld said that his ire with the company began in early 2023, when he learned that it made the controversial decision to change the credits on Wolverine by giving co-creator status to editor Roy Thomas, which upset Christina Valada, the widow of Wolverine co-creator Len Wein, with whom Lifeld is close friends. Liefeld also made a July 2023 request for special credit on &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, akin to the prominent credit DC Comics gives Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster on its &quot;Superman&quot; publications, and inquired about other possible promotional opportunities, but this too was rebuffed. Liefeld believed that the negative reaction Marvel had to his request is what motivated his treatment at the premiere.

==Criticism and praise==

Liefeld&#x27;s name has become something of a lightning rod in the industry. In an interview, Brian Michael Bendis described the polarization of opinion on Liefeld: &quot;There is a great dichotomy ... There&#x27;s either some great and generous story about [Liefeld] or you will hear some unbelievable thing like, &#x27;How is he not in jail if he did that?&#x27; There is no middle ground.&quot;

In interviews, Liefeld has compared himself to other popular figures who experienced meteoric success and acclaim early in their careers but near-pariah status afterwards, such as LeBron James or Britney Spears, who &quot;became vapid in pop music, and perhaps [he] was nothing more than a vapid comic book artist&quot;. He seems to credit his success to tapping into the zeitgeist: &quot;I&#x27;ll be the first to tell you that we [the Image collective] were never the best artists. We were never the best at anything, but just like a song or a band or whatever, we caught on and we toured rigorously.&quot;

Liefeld is not without supporters in the industry, including those who defend his art. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; says of Liefeld&#x27;s critics, &quot;Rob Liefeld is the punching bag of choice for many discerning comics fans. But he&#x27;s also the man who defined what the 1990s looked like in superhero books, so he&#x27;s crying all the way to the bank. For every detractor who thinks he&#x27;s the worst thing to happen to comic books since Fredric Wertham, there are a dozen ravenous fanboys ready to snatch up whatever he does next.&quot; Writer Jeph Loeb, with whom Liefeld collaborated, and writer Mark Millar are reported to be admirers of his work. Millar in particular wrote the foreword to the 2008 &quot;Youngblood&quot; collection published by Image Comics, in which he defended that series as an entry in the celebrity superhero subgenre that predated &quot;The Authority&quot; and &quot;X-Statix&quot;. Millar also compared critics of Liefeld&#x27;s layouts and figure work to those who would have criticized Jack Kirby for exhibiting a cartoony style rather than photorealism, and asserted that his own children are avid fans of Liefeld&#x27;s work in general, and &quot;Youngblood&quot; in particular. Comics writer Grant Morrison credited the Image creators with &quot;rescuing&quot; American comics, explaining that they responded to children&#x27;s tastes of the time, and brought comics back to their basic superhero roots following the British Invasion in comics and the popularization of titles typified by Vertigo Comics, which Morrison was a part of. Morrison stated that they are an admirer of Liefeld&#x27;s work in particular, explaining that while Liefeld&#x27;s art was regarded as &quot;total crap&quot; in the 1990s, many comic book artists today see it as an avant-garde abstraction of reality that is as bizarre and individual as Vincent van Gogh. In 2012, Rich Johnston of &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; said of DC Comics&#x27; decision to assign Liefeld the co-scripting and drawing duties on three of their flagging New 52 titles, &quot;Rob does have a habit, of course, of pulling out sales and attention like a rabbit out of a hat.&quot;

In 2013, he was named on &quot;IGN&quot;″s list of &quot;The Best Tweeters in Comics&quot; for both his industry insight and his bluntness.

===Art style===
Liefeld has been criticized for his drawing skill. In a 1996 interview, writer/illustrator Barry Windsor-Smith criticized the depth of work by the popular artists of the 1990s like Liefeld and Jim Lee, and those whom they had influenced (whom he referred to as &quot;the Liefelds and the Lees&quot;), stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think it has even crossed their minds that comic books can be a medium for intimate self-expression.&quot; Speaking of Liefeld in particular, Windsor-Smith said:


Liefeld has also been criticized for designing characters with an improbable profusion of weapons, accessories, and pouches, a tendency that was subject to parody. For example, during Grant Morrison&#x27;s run on DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; in the early 1990s, Morrison collaborated with Keith Giffen, Mike Mignola, and Walt Simonson to produce &quot;Doom Force Special&quot; #1 (July 1992), which &quot;vicious[ly]&quot; mocked Liefeld&#x27;s work on &quot;X-Force&quot;.

Artist Alex Ross drew upon his dislike of the design of Liefeld&#x27;s creation Cable when designing the character Magog for the 1996 miniseries &quot;Kingdom Come&quot;. Following writer Mark Waid&#x27;s instructions that the character&#x27;s appearance be based on aspects of superhero design trends of the time that they disliked, Ross said of Cable, &quot;That&#x27;s a character that Mark Waid invented that was really just put to me like come up with the most God awful, Rob Liefeld sort of design that you can. What I was stealing from was—really only two key designs of Rob&#x27;s—the design of Cable. I hated it. I felt like it looked like they just threw up everything on the character—the scars, the thing going on with his eye, the arm, and what&#x27;s with all the guns?&quot;

Liefeld has also been criticized for drawing figures with exaggerated muscular anatomy, such as long legs and tiny feet, and &quot;bizarre&quot; anatomy on female characters that some critics felt served to objectify women, with critical articles such as &quot;The 40 Worst Rob Liefeld Drawings&quot;, &quot;A Gallery of Rob Liefeld&#x27;s Anatomical Abominations&quot; and &quot;Worst Rob Liefeld Covers&quot; among the top mentions of Liefeld on Google. One of the most criticized and parodied illustrations was a promotional illustration of Captain America for the 1996 &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; storyline, which depicted Captain America with &quot;cartoonish proportions&quot;, in particular his stomach, arms, and &quot;gaping barrel chest&quot;, as &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; (CBR) put it. Referred to by &quot;Comics Beat&quot; as &quot;the most infamous piece of art in comics history&quot;, Timothy Donohoo of CBR observed that the artwork &quot;showcases the extreme and many times highly unrealistic anatomy seen in the comics of the era&quot;, and came to be viewed as emblematic of Liefeld&#x27;s artwork as a whole, one that subsequently became an internet meme. Liefeld poked fun at the matter in 2016, tweeting, &quot;Of course I&#x27;m #teamcap. I didn&#x27;t give him those big tits for nuthin...&quot; He revisited the illustration in September 2023 with a New York Comic Con variant cover for &quot;Captain America&quot; (vol 10) #1, depicting the Sam Wilson incarnation of the character in the same pose. Posting the image on Twitter, Liefeld commented, &quot;Had to get something off my chest.&quot; In October 2023, the original 1996 artwork was put up for auction with Heritage Auctions, the second time it had been made so available. On November 17, the piece was finally auctioned for $132,000 USD.

These stylistic elements were seen as the impetus for Liefeld&#x27;s initial success, when such affectations were unusual in comics, and helped lend such characters to successfully merchandised products. Nonetheless, the approach later became a cliché and led to a widespread hostility towards the style. Liefeld agrees for the most part with this estimation of his early work, saying, &quot;In the mid-90s we &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″ed everything. I&#x27;m as guilty as anyone ...&quot; Liefeld&#x27;s friend, Image Comics partner, and &quot;The Walking Dead&quot; creator, Robert Kirkman, defends Liefeld, saying, &quot;Every figure that Rob draws has a certain energy to it, a certain excitement. Every character Rob drew had seven knives and six guns and shoulder pads and pouches and belts and straps and ammunition. It was an aesthetic that as a kid absolutely blew me away. I idolized the guy ... Everything he draws is interesting, whether it&#x27;s accurate or not. A lot of people look at the way Rob draws the human body and they say, &#x27;That&#x27;s wrong in my eyes.&#x27; I would say that these people have no joy in their souls. It&#x27;s not like Rob doesn&#x27;t know what a human body looks like, I think Rob looks at a human body and goes: &#x27;That&#x27;s boring. I can do better.

In addition to his depiction of human anatomy, Liefeld&#x27;s art has also been criticized in more general terms for use of splash pages in lieu of multi-panel pages depicting more story, and poor design and continuity in elements such as clothing, props, and proper proportions between characters and their environments, with industry columnist Peter David responding to Liefeld&#x27;s 1996 work on the &quot;Heroes Reborn&quot; &quot;Captain America&quot; by proclaiming Liefeld the &quot;Ed Wood of comics&quot;. Kesel relates:

Liefeld has stated that such criticism has not bothered him, in part because, at the height of his popularity, he had things outside of his work to focus on, such as the death of his father from cancer in 1999. By the 2010s, he was known to reference this perception of his work in a lighthearted manner: Following the April 2012 release of DC Comics&#x27; solicitations for that July, which included Liefeld&#x27;s covers for &quot;The Savage Hawkman&quot; #11, &quot;Deathstroke&quot; #11, and &quot;Grifter&quot; #11—all of which showed characters&#x27; feet—Liefeld, who had been criticized for avoiding drawing characters&#x27; feet, commented, &quot;The Hipsters don&#x27;t know what to do when I draw feet. It confuses them.&quot; In &quot;Deadpool 2&quot;, the character Domino&#x27;s luck-based powers are disparaged by Deadpool: &quot;Luck? What coked-out, glass pipe-sucking freakshow comic book artist came up with that little chestnut? Probably a guy who can&#x27;t draw feet!&quot;, a reference acknowledged by Liefeld, who has pointed out that many fan favorite artists used mounds of debris or shadows to avoid drawing feet.

===Creator credit===
At the beginning of Liefeld&#x27;s run on the &quot;New Mutants&quot;, the heavily muscled, heavily armed cyborg character Cable was created for the team, and became a popular antihero, although there is dispute over Cable&#x27;s origin, with conflicting accounts of credit given to Liefeld, Bob Harras, and Louise Simonson for aspects of the character&#x27;s concept and origin. For a time, Marvel credited only Liefeld and Simonson as Cable&#x27;s creators within the &quot;Cable &amp; Deadpool&quot; series. He also was credited as the sole creator of &quot;Youngblood&quot;, when documentation suggests that Liefeld&#x27;s longtime friend and collaborator Hank Kanalz co-developed that team with him. Liefeld has also contested sharing creator credit with writer Fabian Nicieza for the character Deadpool. In a 2016 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, Liefeld said that he did &quot;all the heavy lifting&quot; in writing and drawing the issue in which that character first appeared, while Nicieza wrote its script, saying, &quot;If a janitor scripted New Mutants 98, he&#x27;d be the co-creator – that&#x27;s how it works, buddy. Deadpool does not exist in any way, shape or form without me. I wrote the stories. Like Jim Lee and others, I worked with a scripter who helped facilitate. I chose Fabian, and he got the benefit of the Rob Liefeld lottery ticket. Those are good coattails to ride.&quot; These remarks drew criticism from writers Dan Slott, Mark Waid, and Kurt Busiek, and artist Darick Robertson, who felt that Liefeld was diminishing Nicieza&#x27;s contributions to the character. Busiek in particular referenced Nicieza&#x27;s work on Deadpool&#x27;s signature trait, saying, &quot;Because the success of the Merc With A Mouth clearly has nothing to do with the guy who supplied the mouth.&quot; Liefeld later said that he hated the &quot;New York Times&quot; article, calling it &quot;a hit piece&quot;.

Liefeld has also been accused of swiping, or copying, art from other artists. Liefeld responded to this accusation by stating that in these instances, which he said were limited to ten, he was offering tribute to the artists of the original pieces in question, rather than plagiarizing, and compared this to the work of filmmaker Brian De Palma, who used the techniques of Alfred Hitchcock. Peter David responded to this rationale by stating that DePalma himself was criticized harshly by film critics for employing Hitchcock&#x27;s techniques, and that Liefeld, who has identified himself as a &quot;stickler&quot; for credit, did not credit artists whose work he copied, instances of which exceeded the ten upon which Liefeld insisted. David also stated that some of these artists, such as John Byrne and George Pérez, did not react to this practice on Liefeld&#x27;s part as a &quot;tribute&quot;, and expressed displeasure at the degree to which Liefeld relied on their work.

===Production and business problems===
Liefeld has also gained a reputation for producing late books, primarily his creator-owned ones, though somewhat less so when doing work-for-hire. Some issues of his series &quot;Youngblood&quot; shipped as much as nine months late. Liefeld has attributed this to the greater incentive a freelancer feels when doing work-for-hire assignments for a company, as opposed to working on one&#x27;s self-owned work. Creator Bob Layton related he had to fly to Los Angeles and actually sit on Liefeld&#x27;s doorstep until Liefeld finished penciling his portion of the &quot;Deathmate&quot; miniseries, which was an intercompany crossover published by Image Comics and Valiant Comics, and that he had to ink the artwork himself in an Anaheim hotel room. Layton stated, &quot;There I was, with my own company to manage, and I was in California, managing someone else&#x27;s people.&quot; Layton cites &quot;Deathmate&quot;, and Image&#x27;s inability to produce its half of that series in a timely manner, as the first disaster that heralded the end of the speculator boom of the 1990s, and the eventual demise of Valiant Comics.

Liefeld has been criticized for not returning to Rick Veitch the original artwork that Veitch had produced for Liefeld&#x27;s Awesome Comics series, &quot;Supreme&quot;.

Liefeld compared his conflicts with contemporaries McFarlane and Jim Lee to the intra-band conflicts of the Eagles, reflecting in 2007 that his feud with the Image partners was in the past, saying, &quot;The divorce was ugly, but to me it didn&#x27;t linger. ... I realized you just need to let it go.&quot;

<text>Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kondratiev (; also Kondratieff; Russian: Никола́й Дми́триевич Кондра́тьев; 4 March 1892 – 17 September 1938) was a Russian Soviet economist and proponent of the New Economic Policy (NEP) best known for the business cycle theory known as Kondratiev waves.

Kondratiev became an early leading figure of Soviet economics and promoted the NEP&#x27;s system of small private free market enterprises in the Soviet Union. Kondratiev&#x27;s theory that Western capitalist economies have long term (50-to-60-year) cycles of boom followed by depression gained recognition inside and outside the Soviet Union.

Kondratiev was condemned and imprisoned in 1930, but continued to work until his execution during the Great Purge in 1938. Some of his work was published, for the first time, posthumously. 

==Life==
===Early life and education===
Nikolai Dimitrievich Kondratiev was born on 4 March 1892 in the Galuevskaya, a village near Vichuga, Kostroma Governorate, into a peasant family of Komi heritage. Kondratiev was tutored at the University of St. Petersburg before the 1917 Russian Revolution by Mikhail Tugan-Baranovsky and Alexander Sergeyevich Lappo-Danilevsky. A member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, his initial professional work was in the area of agricultural economics and statistics and the problem of food supplies. On 5 October 1917, at the age of 25, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Supply of the last Alexander Kerensky government, which lasted for only a few days.

After the revolution, Kondratiev pursued academic research. In 1919, he was appointed to a teaching post at the Agricultural Academy of Peter the Great. In October 1920 he founded the Institute of Conjuncture, in Moscow. As its first director, he developed it into a large and respected institution with 51 researchers by 1923.

In 1922, he published his first writing on long cycles., &quot;The World Economy and its Conjunctures During and After the War&quot;. To provide proof that capitalist economies were subject to spontaneous and recurrent depressions and recoveries, Kondratiev did extensive price analysis of goods in the German, British, and French economies. Among the prices studied were raw materials and output products, interest rates, foreign trade, wages, and bank deposits.

In 1923, Kondratiev intervened in the debate about the &quot;Scissors Crisis&quot;, following the general opinion of his colleagues. In 1923–25, he worked on a five-year plan for the development of Soviet agriculture. In 1924, after publishing his first book, presenting the first tentative version of his theory of major cycles, Kondratiev traveled to England, Germany, Canada and the United States, and visited several universities before returning to Russia..

In his 1924 paper &quot;On the Notion of Economic Statics, Dynamics and Fluctuations&quot;, Kondratiev formulated, for the first time, his theory of long business cycles. Specifically, he made the following conclusions:
1. Prosperity years were most common in the capitalist economies during upswing periods.
2. Agriculture suffered more and long depressions than did industry during price downswings
3. Major technological innovations were conceived in downswing periods but were developed in upswing periods
4. Gold supply increased, and new markets were opened at the beginning of an upswing
5. The most extensive and devastating wars occurred during periods of an upswing(Mager, 1987, p. 27)

In 1925 he published his book &quot;The Major Economic Cycles&quot;, which quickly was translated into German. A short form was published in 1935 in the &quot;Review of Economic Statistics&quot; and for a time his ideas became popular in the West, until eclipsed by those of John Maynard Keynes.

Kondratiev&#x27;s economic cycle theory held that there were long cycles of about fifty years. At the beginning of the cycle economies produce high-cost capital goods and infrastructure investments creating new employment and income and demand for consumer goods. However, after a few decades the expected return on investment falls below the interest rate and people refuse to invest, even as overcapacity in capital goods gives rise to massive layoffs, reducing the demand for consumer goods. Unemployment and a long economic crisis ensue as economies contract. People and companies save their resources until confidence begins to return and there is an upswing into a new capital formation period, usually characterized by large scale investment in new technologies.

Joseph Schumpeter credited the foundations of Long Wave Theory to Nikolai Kondratiev. He coined the term &quot;Kondratiev Waves&quot; (K-waves) in respect for Nikolai Kondratiev.

===Support of the People&#x27;s Commissariat===

A member of the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Agriculture and a proponent of the Soviet New Economic Policy (NEP) supported by Vladimir Lenin, Kondratiev was influential with writings about agriculture and planning methodology. Influenced by his trips overseas, he advocated a market-led industrialization strategy emphasizing export of agricultural produce to pay for industrialization, following the Ricardian economics theory of comparative advantage. He proposed a plan for agriculture and forestry from 1924 to 1928. However, after the death of Lenin in 1924, Joseph Stalin, who favored complete government control of the economy, took control of the Communist Party. Kondratiev&#x27;s influence quickly waned.

According to the late Harvard sociologist Carle C. Zimmerman, Kondratiev was reported to Soviet authorities by a member of the University of Minnesota agriculture faculty in 1927 after a visit to sociologist Pitirim Sorokin:

Kondratieff (sic), an agricultural economist and student of business cycles, visited Minnesota in 1927 and stayed with Sorokin. A number of prominent American scientists were pro-communist at the time. One was a forester at the Ag campus where I had an office. He upbraided me for associating with Sorokin and Kondratieff and told me he was going to send a report about Kondratieff back to Russia. Later I learned that Kondratieff was arrested immediately after returning to Russia from the trip to see American universities. However, he was not given the final &quot;treatment&quot; until the Stalinist purges of 1931.

===Fall from USSR directorship===

Kondratiev was removed from the directorship of the Institute of Conjuncture in 1928 and arrested in July 1930, accused of being a member of a &quot;&quot; (a non-existent party invented by the NKVD). Convicted as a &quot;kulak-professor&quot; and sentenced to 8 years in prison, Kondratiev served his sentence, from February 1932 onwards, at Suzdal, near Moscow. Although his health deteriorated under poor conditions, Kondratiev continued his research and decided to prepare five new books, as he mentioned in a letter to his wife. Some of these texts were indeed completed and were published posthumously.

His last letter was sent to his daughter, Elena Kondratieva, on 31 August 1938. In September 1938, during Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, he was tried, sentenced to death, and executed on the same day at the Kommunarka shooting ground. His relatives were informed that he was condemned to &quot;ten years without the right to correspond with the outside world&quot;. He was 46 at the time of the execution.

==Legacy==
In the 1970s, increased interest in business cycles led to the rediscovery of Kondratiev&#x27;s work, including the first-time publication of a complete English translation of his seminal article &quot;The Long Waves in Economic Life&quot; in the journal &quot;Review (Fernand Braudel Center)&quot; in 1979 (the article was originally published in a German journal in 1926 and a partial English translation appeared in the journal &quot;The Review of Economic Statistics&quot; in 1935). This rediscovery of Kondratiev in English-speaking academia led to his theories being extended for the first time beyond economics as, for example, political scientists such as Joshua Goldstein and geographers such as Brian Berry extended the concept of Kondratiev long waves into their own fields. However, Kondratiev&#x27;s theory remains controversial because, among other issues, of his ideas about the periodical character of the replacement of basic capital goods and the empirical possibility of coincidence in identifying long waves (i.e. that long waves are simply an epiphenomenon). Economists disagree about the length of cycles and their starting or ending points.

In 1987, the Soviet authorities officially rehabilitated Kondratiev. His collected works were first translated into English by Stephen S. Wilson in 1998. In 1992, on the centenary of his birth, the International Foundation N.A. Kondratiev was founded at the hands of Russian academics, Elena Kondratieva and Italian economist Giancarlo Pallavicini, at the time the first Western advisor to the Russian government for the reform of the economy, appointed vice president, along with Yurji Jacovetz, and Leonid Abalkin president

<text>James Jesus Angleton (December 9, 1917 – May 11, 1987) was an American intelligence operative who served as chief of the counterintelligence department of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1954 to 1975. According to Director of Central Intelligence Richard Helms, Angleton was &quot;recognized as the dominant counterintelligence figure in the non-communist world&quot;.

Angleton served in the Office of Strategic Services, a wartime predecessor to the CIA, in Italy and London during World War II. After the war, he returned to Washington, D.C. to become one of the founding officers of the CIA. He was initially responsible for the collection of foreign intelligence and liaison with counterpart organizations in allied countries. In 1954, Allen Dulles promoted Angleton to chief of the Counterintelligence Staff. As chief, Angleton was significantly involved in the defection of Soviet KGB agents Anatoliy Golitsyn and Yuri Nosenko. Through Golitsyn, Angleton became convinced the CIA harbored a high-ranking Soviet mole and engaged in an intensive search. Whether this was a highly destructive witch hunt or appropriate caution remains a subject of intense historical debate.

Investigative journalist Edward Jay Epstein agrees with the high regard in which Angleton was held by his colleagues in the intelligence business, and adds that Angleton earned the &quot;trust of six CIA directors—including Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, Allen W. Dulles and Richard Helms. They kept Angleton in key positions and valued his work.&quot;

==Early and personal life==
James Jesus Angleton was born December 9, 1917, in Boise, Idaho, the eldest of four children of James Hugh Angleton (1888–1973) and Carmen Mercedes Moreno (1898–1985). His parents met in Nogales, Arizona, while his father was a U.S. Army cavalry officer serving under General John Pershing. Carmen Moreno was born in Mexico but was already a naturalized American citizen before she married James H. Angleton in December 1916.

James Hugh Angleton joined the National Cash Register Corporation, rising through its ranks until in the early 1930s he purchased the NCR franchise in Italy. In Italy, he became head of the American Chamber of Commerce.

Angleton&#x27;s boyhood was spent in Milan, Italy. He studied as a boarder at Malvern College in England before attending Yale University. As a Yale undergraduate, Angleton edited the Yale literary magazine &quot;Furioso&quot; with Reed Whittemore. &quot;Furioso&quot; published many of the best-known poets of the interwar period, including William Carlos Williams, E. E. Cummings and Ezra Pound. Angleton carried on an extensive correspondence with Pound, Cummings and T. S. Eliot, among others, and was particularly influenced by William Empson, author of &quot;Seven Types of Ambiguity&quot;. Angleton was trained in the New Criticism at Yale by Maynard Mack and others, chiefly Norman Holmes Pearson, a founder of American Studies. He briefly studied law at Harvard, but did not graduate.

==World War II==
In 1943, Angleton joined the U.S. Army. During World War II, Angleton served in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and led its Italian branch. He also served in London under Norman Holmes Pearson in the X-2 Counter Espionage Branch of the OSS. By February 1944, he was chief of the Italy desk for X-2 in London. While in London, Angleton met the famous double agent Kim Philby. In November 1944, Angleton was transferred to Italy as commander of Secret Counterintelligence Unit Z, which handled Ultra intelligence based on the British intercepts of German radio communications.

By the end of the war, Angleton was head of X-2 for all of Italy. In this position, Angleton helped prevent the execution of Italian naval commander Junio Valerio Borghese, whose elite unit Decima MAS had collaborated with the Schutzstaffel during the war. Angleton was interested in the defense of installations such as ports and bridges and offered Borghese a fair trial in return for his collaboration. He dressed him up in an American uniform and drove him from Milan to Rome for interrogation by the Allies. Borghese was then tried and convicted by an Italian court of collaboration with the Nazi invaders but not of war crimes.

Angleton remained in Italy after the war, establishing connections with other intelligence services and playing a major role in the 1948 Italian general election. The election was won by the US-backed Christian Democratic Party over the Soviet-backed Italian Communist Party. Angleton&#x27;s tour in Italy as an intelligence officer is regarded by biographer Jefferson Morley as a critical turn not only in his professional life. His personal liaisons with Italian Mafia figures helped the CIA in the immediate postwar period.

==Central Intelligence Agency==

Upon his return to Washington after World War II, Angleton was employed by the various successor organizations to the OSS and eventually became one of the founding officers of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947.

In May 1949, he was made head of Staff A of the Office of Special Operations, where he was responsible for the collection of foreign intelligence and liaising with counterpart intelligence organizations in foreign countries.

Beginning in 1951, Angleton was responsible for &quot;the Israel desk&quot; as liaison with Israel&#x27;s Mossad and Shin Bet agencies. Angleton retained an active interest in Israeli intelligence and maintained connections there throughout his career, believing that émigrés to Israel from the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact nations could be a valuable source of information on their countries of origin. He also believed that Israeli foreign intelligence services could be used for proxy operations in third countries. For instance, Shin Bet was crucial in obtaining a transcript of Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s 1956 speech to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Congress that denounced Joseph Stalin. Author Samuel Katz has claimed that Angleton directed CIA assistance to the Israeli nuclear weapons program.

As head of Staff A, Angleton worked particularly closely with Kim Philby, the apparent future head of MI6, who was also in Washington. In 1951, Philby&#x27;s colleagues Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean defected to Moscow. Philby was expelled from Washington, suspected of having tipped them off based on decoded Soviet communications from the Venona project. Philby was confirmed to be a Soviet mole but eluded those sent to arrest him. He defected to Moscow in 1963. Philby called Angleton &quot;a brilliant opponent&quot; and a &quot;fascinating&quot; friend who seemed to be &quot;catching on&quot; before his defection. CIA employee William King Harvey, a former FBI agent, had voiced his suspicions regarding Philby and others Angleton suspected were Soviet agents.

In 1953, Allen Dulles became Director of Central Intelligence. He soon named Angleton chief of the Counterintelligence Staff, in which position Angleton served for the remainder of his career. Dulles also assigned Angleton responsibility for coordination with allied intelligence services.

As chief of Counterintelligence, Angleton oversaw a ring of informants organized by Jay Lovestone, a trade union leader and former head of the Communist Party of the United States. It was informally called the &quot;Lovestone Empire&quot;. Lovestone worked with foreign unions and used covert funds to establish a global system of anti-communist union organizers.

During the Vietnam War and Soviet-American détente, Angleton remained convinced of the necessity of the war. During this period, Angleton&#x27;s counter-intelligence staff undertook a most comprehensive domestic covert surveillance project (called Operation CHAOS) under the direction of President Lyndon Johnson. The prevailing belief at the time was that the anti-war and civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s had foreign funding and support. None was found by them, although the Soviet Union did influence the movements.

Angleton also believed that the strategic calculations underlying the resumption of relations with China were flawed based on a deceptive KGB staging of the Sino-Soviet split. He went so far as to speculate that Henry Kissinger might be under KGB influence.

===Suspicion of infiltration===
Angleton held a general belief that all secret intelligence agencies should be assumed to be penetrated by others, or at least that a reasonable chief of counterintelligence should assume so. Angleton&#x27;s view was influenced by his direct experience with the manipulation of German intelligence during World War II, the Cambridge Five, and the success of American infiltration efforts in the Third World. In particular, Angleton&#x27;s close association with Philby heightened Angleton&#x27;s suspicions and led him to double-check &quot;potential problems&quot;. Angleton&#x27;s position in the CIA and his close relationship with Director Richard Helms in particular expanded his influence, and as it grew, the CIA split between Angletonians and anti-Angletonians. This conflict rose in particular regard to Anatoliy Golitsyn and Yuri Nosenko, who defected from the Soviet Union to the United States in 1961 and 1964, respectively.

Golitsyn defected via Helsinki on December 15, 1961. He and his family flew with a CIA escort to Sweden and then to the United States, where he was interviewed by Angleton personally. Golitsyn limited his initial debriefing to a review of photographs to identify KGB officers and refused to discuss KGB strategy. After Golitsyn raised the possibility of serious infiltration with MI5 in a subsequent debriefing, MI5 shared the concern with Angleton. He responded by asking Helms to allow him to take responsibility for Golitsyn and his further debriefing. Golitsyn ultimately informed on many famous Soviet agents, including the Cambridge Five, which led to their apprehension. Angleton identified Golitsyn as &quot;the most valuable defector ever to reach the West&quot;.

However, other allegations Golitsyn made, including that Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Harold Wilson was a Soviet agent and that the Sino-Soviet split was a &quot;charade,&quot; were ultimately found to be false. Golitsyn also claimed that a mole who had been stationed in West Germany, was of Slavic descent, had a last name that might end in &quot;sky&quot; and definitely began with a &quot;K&quot;, and operated under the KGB codename &quot;Sasha&quot;. Angleton believed this claim, with the result that anyone who approximated this description fell under his suspicion.

Angleton became increasingly convinced that the CIA was compromised by the KGB. Golitsyn convinced Angleton that the KGB had reorganized in 1958 and 1959 to consist mostly of a shell, incorporating only those agents whom the CIA and the FBI were recruiting, directed by a small cabal of puppet masters who doubled those agents to manipulate their Western counterparts. Although Golitsyn was a questionable source, Angleton accepted significant information obtained from his debriefing by the CIA.

In 1964, Yuri Nosenko, a KGB officer based in Geneva, insisted he needed to defect to the United States, as his role as a double agent had been discovered, and he was being recalled to Moscow. Nosenko was allowed to defect, although the CIA was unable to verify a KGB recall order. Golitsyn had said from the beginning that the KGB would try to plant defectors in an effort to discredit him. Under great duress, Nosenko failed two highly questionable lie detector tests but passed a third test monitored by several Agency departments. Judging his claim (as well as additional claims regarding Lee Harvey Oswald) improbable, Angleton permitted David Murphy, head of the Soviet Russia Division, to hold Nosenko in solitary confinement for over three years. This confinement included 16 months in a small attic with no windows, furniture, heat or air conditioning. Human contact was completely banned. Nosenko was given a shower once a week and had no television, reading material, radio, exercise, or toothbrush. Interrogations were frequent and intensive. Nosenko spent an additional four months in a ten-foot by ten-foot concrete bunker in Camp Peary. He was told that this condition would continue for 25 years unless he confessed to being a Soviet spy. Nosenko did not appear to have shaken Angleton&#x27;s faith in Golitsyn, although Helms and J. Edgar Hoover thought otherwise. Hoover&#x27;s objections are said to have been so vehement as to severely curtail counterintelligence cooperation between the FBI and CIA for the remainder of Hoover&#x27;s service as FBI director. Nosenko was found to be a legitimate defector, a lieutenant colonel. He became a consultant to the CIA. Golitsyn, who had defected years before, was unable to provide concrete support for his views of the KGB.

Angleton came into increasing conflict with the rest of the Agency, particularly the Directorate of Operations, over the efficacy of their intelligence-gathering efforts. He questioned this without explaining his broader views on KGB strategy and organization.

In his 2022 book, &quot;Uncovering Popov&#x27;s Mole&quot;, researcher John M. Newman argues that Bruce Solie of the Office of Security was very probably the mole and that he misled Angleton, his protégé, into believing the traitor was in the Soviet Russia Division.

=== Suspicion of foreign leaders ===
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Angleton privately accused various foreign leaders of being Soviet spies. He twice informed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police that he believed Prime Minister Lester Pearson and his successor Pierre Trudeau were agents of the Soviet Union. Angleton accused Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, West German Chancellor Willy Brandt, and British Prime Minister Harold Wilson of being assets for the Soviet Union.

Australian journalist Brian Toohey claimed that Angleton considered Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam a &quot;serious threat&quot; to the US. Angleton was concerned after the Commonwealth police raided ASIO headquarters in Melbourne in 1973 at the direction of Attorney General Lionel Murphy. In 1974, Angleton sought to instigate the removal of Whitlam from office by having CIA station chief in Canberra, John Walker, ask Peter Barbour, then head of ASIO, to make a false declaration that Whitlam had lied about the raid in Parliament. Barbour refused to make the statement.

===Church Committee and resignation===
In 1973, William Colby was named Director of Central Intelligence by Richard Nixon. Colby reorganized the CIA in an effort to curb Angleton&#x27;s influence and weaken the Counterintelligence branch, beginning by stripping him of control over the Israel desk. Colby demanded Angleton&#x27;s resignation.

Angleton came to public attention when the Church Committee (formally the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities) probed the CIA for information on domestic surveillance, specifically the operation known as HT Lingual, as well as assassination plots and the death of John F. Kennedy.

In December 1974, Seymour Hersh published a story in &quot;The New York Times&quot; about domestic counter-intelligence activities against anti-war protesters and other domestic dissidents. Angleton&#x27;s resignation was announced on Christmas Eve 1974, just as President Gerald Ford demanded Director Colby report on the allegations and various Congressional committees announced that they would launch their own inquiries. Angleton told reporters from United Press International that he was resigning because &quot;my usefulness has ended&quot; and the CIA was getting involved in &quot;police state activities&quot;. Three of Angleton&#x27;s senior aides retired within a week after it was made clear that they would be transferred elsewhere in the Agency rather than promoted. The Counterintelligence staff was reduced from 300 to 80 people.

In 1975, Angleton was awarded the CIA&#x27;s Distinguished Intelligence Medal. By this time, Angleton had been quietly rehired by the CIA at his old salary through a secret contract. Until September 1975, &quot;operational issues remained solely the preserve of Angleton&quot;.

=== Aftermath ===
The late 1970s were generally a period of upheaval for the CIA. During George H. W. Bush&#x27;s tenure as Director, President Ford authorized the creation of Team B, a project concluding that the Agency and the intelligence community had seriously underestimated Soviet strategic nuclear strength in Central Europe. Admiral Stansfield Turner, on his appointment as DCI by President Jimmy Carter in 1977, used Angleton as an example of the excesses in the Agency that he hoped to curb. He referred to this during his service and in his memoirs.

Because of their suspicions, Angleton and his staff ultimately impeded the career advancement of numerous CIA employees. Forty employees are said to have been investigated and fourteen were considered serious suspects by Angleton&#x27;s staff. The CIA paid compensation to three under what Agency employees termed the &quot;Mole Relief Act&quot;.

With Golitsyn, Angleton continued to seek out moles. They sought the assistance of William F. Buckley, Jr. (himself a former CIA asset) to write &quot;New Lies for Old&quot;, which argued that the Soviet Union planned to fake a collapse to lull its enemies into a false sense of victory, but Buckley refused. In his 1994 book &quot;&quot;, author Mark Riebling claimed that of 194 predictions made in &quot;New Lies For Old&quot;, 139 had been fulfilled by 1993, nine seemed &quot;clearly wrong&quot;, and the other 46 were &quot;not soon falsifiable&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
In July 1943, shortly after he enlisted in the Army, Angleton married Cicely Harriet d&#x27;Autremont, a Vassar alumna from Tucson, Arizona. Together, they had three children:
* James C. Angleton;
* Guru Sangat Kaur Khalsa (formerly Truffy Angleton); and
* Siri Hari Kaur Angleton-Khalsa (formerly Lucy d&#x27;Autremont Angleton)

The Angletons lived in the Rock Spring neighborhood of Arlington, Virginia until Angleton&#x27;s death. The Angletons developed a varied social set in Washington, including professional acquaintances in intelligence, poets, painters and journalists.

Angleton&#x27;s wife and his daughters explored Sikhism, and both of Angleton&#x27;s daughters became followers of Harbhajan Singh Khalsa.

Angleton died from cancer in Washington, D.C., on 11 May 1987.

==Legacy==
Angleton&#x27;s responsibilities as chief of Counterintelligence have given rise to a considerable literature focused on his efforts to identify Soviet or Eastern Bloc agents working in American secret intelligence agencies.

In time, Angleton&#x27;s zeal and suspicions came to be regarded as counterproductive, if not destructive. In the wake of his departure, counterintelligence efforts were undertaken with far less enthusiasm. Some believe this overcompensation was responsible for oversights which allowed Aldrich Ames, Robert Hanssen and others to compromise American intelligence agencies after Angleton&#x27;s resignation. Although the American intelligence community quickly recovered from the Church Committee, it found itself uncharacteristically incapable of policing itself after Angleton&#x27;s departure. Edward Jay Epstein has argued that the positions of Ames and Hanssen—both well-placed Soviet counter-intelligence agents, in the CIA and FBI respectively—would enable the KGB to deceive the American intelligence community, in the manner that Angleton hypothesized.

Despite misgivings over his uncompromising and often obsessive approach to his profession, Angleton is highly regarded by a number of his peers in the intelligence business. Former Shin Bet chief Amos Manor, in an interview in &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;, revealed his fascination with the man during Angleton&#x27;s work to forge the U.S.–Israel liaison in the early 1950s. Manor described Angleton as &quot;fanatic about everything&quot;, with a &quot;tendency towards mystification&quot;. Manor discovered decades later that the real reason for Angleton&#x27;s visit was to investigate Manor, being an Eastern European Jewish immigrant, for Angleton thought that it would be prudent to &quot;sanitize&quot; the U.S.–Israeli bridge before a more formal intelligence relationship was established.

Three books dealing with Angleton take foreign intelligence activities, counterintelligence and domestic intelligence activities as their central theme: Tom Mangold&#x27;s &quot;Cold Warrior&quot;, David C. Martin&#x27;s &quot;Wilderness of Mirrors&quot;, and David Wise&#x27;s &quot;Molehunt&quot;. Tim Weiner&#x27;s &quot;Legacy of Ashes&quot; paints Angleton as an incompetent alcoholic.

These views have been challenged by Tennent H. Bagley in his 2007 book, &quot;Spy Wars&quot;, and Mark Riebling in his 1994 book, &quot;Wedge&quot;. John M. Newman, in his 2022 book, &quot;Uncovering Popov&#x27;s Mole&quot;, characterizes Angleton as a man lacking self-confidence and who required a father figure. Newman claims that Angleton was duped by at least two KGB moles: Kim Philby in MI6 and Bruce Solie in the Office of Security. Newman also suggests that Leonard V. McCoy in the Soviet Russia Division&#x27;s Reports &amp; Requirements section may have been a mole.

=== CIA Family Jewels ===

A set of highly sensitive Agency documents, referred to as the &quot;Family Jewels,&quot; was publicly released on June 25, 2007, after more than three decades of secrecy. The release was prompted by an internal CIA investigation of the 1970s Church Committee which verified the far-ranging power and influence that Angleton wielded during his long tenure as counter-intelligence czar. The exposé revealed that Angleton-planned infiltration of law enforcement and military organizations in other countries was used to increase the influence of the United States. It also confirmed past rumors that it was Angleton who was in charge of the domestic spying activities of the CIA under Operation CHAOS.

<doc id="678445" wikidata="Q1192464" url="?curid=678445" title="Rendaku">
<text>is a phenomenon affecting the pronunciation of compound words in Japanese. When rendaku occurs, a voiceless consonant (such as ) is replaced with a voiced consonant (such as ) at the start of the second (or later) part of the compound. For example, the morpheme starts with the voiceless consonant when used as an independent word or as the first part of a compound word, but this is replaced with the corresponding voiced consonant when this morpheme is used as the second part of the compound word . 

Rendaku is common in Japanese, but does not occur in all compound words. It is regularly blocked in certain circumstances. The most important phonological condition blocking rendaku is known as Lyman&#x27;s law, which prevents rendaku if the second element of the compound word already contains one (or more) of the voiced obstruent consonant phonemes . Rendaku is also systematically blocked if the second element of a compound is a recent loanword into Japanese from a foreign language. Furthermore, rendaku may fail to occur even in contexts where no definite blocking factor is present.

In the Japanese writing system, rendaku affects how a morpheme is spelled when using one of the kana syllabaries: it causes the &quot;dakuten&quot; (&quot;voicing mark&quot;, written as ゛) to be added to the upper right corner of the kana character representing the first consonant and vowel in the second element of the compound. For example, and are spelled in hiragana as and , respectively. Rendaku is not marked in writing when a morpheme is spelled using kanji (logographs taken from Chinese characters). For example, is written with the kanji character , which is unchanged when used in the spelling of .

Linguistically, since rendaku involves aspects of both pronunciation (phonology) and word structure (morphology), it is categorized as a morphophonological phenomenon. 

== Effects ==

Rendaku replaces a voiceless obstruent consonant with a corresponding voiced consonant sound. This is seen most straightforwardly in the case of the voiceless alveolar plosive , which in the context of rendaku becomes the voiced alveolar plosive , retaining the same manner and place of articulation as the original consonant. However, rendaku can also cause additional changes depending on the sounds involved. 

In the standard variety of Japanese, rendaku has the following effects. Note that in the context of Japanese phonology, some consonant sounds that seem distinct to English speakers, and that have distinct spellings in Hepburn romanization, are analyzed as allophones (contextual variants of a phoneme).

Depending on accent, the voiced velar nasal may be used in Japanese as an alternative to the voiced velar stop when the consonant occurs in the middle of a word. These two sounds are typically analyzed as allophones of a single phoneme . In accents that use like this, is replaced with in the context of rendaku.

The voiceless affricates are commonly analyzed as allophones of . The phonemic analysis of their voiced outcomes is complicated by a phonetic merger. Originally, corresponded to voiced affricate sounds , whereas corresponded to voiced fricative sounds . However, the historical distinction between and has been lost in the Tokyo-based standard (though not in all regional varieties of Japanese). The merged sounds may be pronounced either as voiced affricates or voiced fricatives, regardless of etymology (see &quot;yotsugana&quot;). As a result of this merge, the phonetic sequence represents a neutralization of historical and , and represents a neutralization of historical and .

In the context of rendaku, dialects with the merger may be analyzed as possessing an underlying phonemic distinction between and that becomes neutralized on the phonetic level as . When morphemes that begin with the morae &quot;chi&quot; (/) and &quot;tsu&quot; (/) undergo rendaku, the resulting morae &quot;ji&quot; and &quot;zu&quot; are generally spelled with the kana / and /, rather than the identically pronounced / and /. This is not a strict rule, however, and is relaxed in certain older compounds or names, especially those that are not easily recognized as compounds.

It is possible to characterize rendaku in terms of its effect on a morpheme&#x27;s Japanese kana spelling: it adds the &quot;dakuten&quot; (voicing mark) to the first kana of the affected morpheme. The relevant graphemes are shown in the tables below (excluding yōon digraphs, which are formed by taking an i-column kana and placing a small &quot;ya, yu,&quot; or &quot;yo&quot; kana after it).


The following table shows an example of rendaku for each major allophone of the eligible consonant sounds:

==Conditions==
Rendaku occurs most frequently in compounds where the second element is a single morpheme of native Japanese origin that does not already contain a voiced obstruent phoneme. However, even though rendaku is usual in this context, it does not invariably occur: there are numerous exceptions pronounced without rendaku. Some compound words are pronounced with rendaku by some speakers, but without it by other speakers.

Rendaku is blocked when a voiced obstruent phoneme is already present in the second element of the compound. This rule, called Lyman’s law, is highly reliable, with only a small number of exceptions.

Rendaku is also blocked if the second element is a recent loanword from a language other than Chinese (gairaigo). This rule likewise has few exceptions.

Rendaku does not affect most Sino-Japanese elements, but this tendency is less consistent. A substantial minority do undergo rendaku as the second element of a compound. It has been speculated that Sino-Japanese elements that can undergo rendaku might have become &quot;vulgarized&quot;, that is, adopted into the same category of vocabulary as native Japanese morphemes.

Other rules have been proposed regarding circumstances where rendaku is either blocked or favored, but often, it is only possible to identify tendencies rather than inviolable rules.

===Lyman&#x27;s law===
Lyman&#x27;s law is the constraint that &quot;rendaku&quot; cannot occur if the second element already contains a voiced obstruent phoneme (that is, if it contains any of the consonant phonemes , including their allophones such as and ; all of these sounds are written with the dakuten and called in Japanese). This is considered to be one of the most fundamental of the rules governing &quot;rendaku&quot;.

: + → (surname) (&quot;mountain&quot; + &quot;gate&quot; → place name). Since already contains a voiced obstruent consonant phoneme , its initial consonant does not undergo rendaku, so the form *&quot;Yamagado&quot; やまがど does not exist (* indicates a non-existent form).
: + → (&quot;one person&quot; + &quot;travel&quot; → &quot;traveling alone&quot;), not *. Since already contains a voiced obstruent consonant phoneme , its initial consonant does not undergo rendaku.
: + → (&quot;mountain&quot; + &quot;fire&quot; → &quot;mountain fire&quot;), not *. Since already contains a voiced obstruent consonant phoneme (in the form of its allophone ), its initial consonant does not undergo rendaku.

The precise formulation of Lyman&#x27;s law varies between analysts. In particular, there are conflicting viewpoints on the size of the phonological domain in which it applies. One formulation states that &quot;rendaku&quot; is blocked by the presence of voiced obstruent consonant &quot;within a morpheme&quot;; this may be interpreted as a consequence of a more general constraint that applies also to the underived form of native Japanese morphemes, which do not generally contain more than one voiced obstruent phoneme. An alternative view is that Lyman&#x27;s law applies whenever a voiced obstruent consonant occurs anywhere within the second element of a compound, and so might also include cases where this element is composed of more than one morpheme. Rendaku occasionally (although relatively infrequently) causes voicing of the initial consonant of a Sino-Japanese () lexeme that is written with two kanji, and is in etymological terms composed of two Sino-Japanese roots; it is debatable whether such lexemes count as one morpheme or two from a synchronic perspective. 

In modern Japanese, the presence of a voiced obstruent phoneme in the first element does not normally block rendaku, as demonstrated by examples such as + → . Nevertheless, it has been proposed that in certain circumstances, Lyman&#x27;s law might be (or might once have been) sensitive to the presence of a voiced obstruent in the first element of a compound. Compound personal names ending in the element &#x27;rice field&#x27; seem to usually show rendaku when the final mora of the first element contains (e.g. ), but never show rendaku when the final mora of the first element contains (e.g. ) (and usually do not show rendaku when it contains ). The pattern of voicing seen in compounds like these may in part be a residue of an older version of the law that operated in Old Japanese. Examination of Old Japanese compounds suggests that Old Japanese had a constraint against two consecutive syllables starting with a prenasalized consonant (the source of modern Japanese /voiced obstruent phonemes), but over time, this constraint came to be replaced with the modern tendency for a consonant to block rendaku only when it occurs in the second element of the compound.

Some formulations of the law treat it as applicable only in cases where the /voiced obstruent phoneme is the second consonant of the final element of the compound. In the case of Old Japanese, there is not enough evidence to conclude whether the Old Japanese version of Lyman&#x27;s law applied to morphemes containing a prenasalized consonant in their third or later syllable. In modern Japanese, however, there is evidence that Lyman&#x27;s law applies in general to morphemes of this form, as indicated by the lack of rendaku in examples such as + → or + → . There are only a handful of exceptions, such as + → , where voicing occurs despite the presence of a /voiced obstruent consonant in the second element of the compound.

Although this law is named after Benjamin Smith Lyman, who independently propounded it in 1894, it is really a re-discovery. The Edo period linguists Kamo no Mabuchi (1765) and Motoori Norinaga (1767–1798) separately and independently identified the law during the 18th century.

===Lexical stratum of the second element===

Another important factor affecting the likelihood of rendaku is the etymological source or lexical stratum of the second element of the compound. Rendaku frequently affects wago (native Japanese lexemes), infrequently affects kango (Sino-Japanese vocabulary), and very rarely affects gairaigo (recent loanwords, such as borrowings from English). On the other hand, the lexical stratum of the first element of the compound is not relevant.

One possible reason for the resistance of Sino-Japanese morphemes to rendaku is the greater potential for it to cause homophony in this context. Native Japanese morphemes very rarely start with a voiced obstruent consonant, but this does not apply to Sino-Japanese; therefore, rendaku of Sino-Japanese morphemes is more likely to neutralize a contrast between distinct morphemes.

====Kango====

Sino-Japanese vocabulary is built from Sino-Japanese roots, which have a restricted phonological structure (one or two moras long). At least half or more of Sino-Japanese terms are &quot;binoms&quot; consisting of two roots, but some roots can be used on their own as words (mononoms). Each word is written with as many kanji (Chinese characters) as it has roots.

When used as the second element of a compound, most Sino-Japanese lexemes do not undergo rendaku. However, a minority (around 20% of mononoms, and 10% of binoms) do show rendaku in at least some compounds. No criteria have been identified that predict with 100% accuracy when this occurs.

In terms of phonology, rendaku is blocked by Lyman&#x27;s law and so never affects a binom where the second root starts with a voiced obstruent phoneme; e.g. in , in . Based on a study of how native speakers pronounced novel compounds, concluded that rendaku is statistically less likely to affect a Sino-Japanese binom where the first root ends in the moraic nasal and the second root end in a voiceless obstruent, although it is not fully blocked in this context (the study&#x27;s observed rate of rendaku in this context was 1.3%, compared to Vance 1996&#x27;s dictionary-based estimate of rendaku affecting 10% of all Sino-Japanese binoms).

Sino-Japanese roots that start with voiceless obstruents may have variant pronunciations starting with voiced obstruent phonemes for other reasons aside from rendaku.

One reason is the existence of different readings of Sino-Japanese roots, corresponding in general to different time periods of borrowing. Two of the most important types of reading are termed Go-on and Kan-on. Certain Kan-on readings starting with correspond regularly to Go-on readings starting with : these represent different adaptations of Early Middle Chinese voiced obstruent sounds, and so the existence of these alternative pronunciations is unrelated in origin to rendaku.

An example is the root &#x27;ground, land&#x27;, which has both a Kan-on pronunciation and a Go-on pronunciation ; for this reason, the use of the voiced pronunciation in compounds such as cannot necessarily be attributed to rendaku, since the version of this root can also be found at the start of a word, e.g. in .

In addition, a minority of lexemes composed of two Sino-Japanese roots display a type of sequential voicing, affecting only roots in second position, that is indistinguishable in effect from rendaku, but probably has a distinct origin in terms of morphology. The relevant context is forms such as , which appears to display rendaku on its second element . In this case, voicing is hypothesized to be the result of the preceding Sino-Japanese root originally ending in a nasal sound, which caused the following consonant to become prenasalized and voiced. Prenasalization and voicing of a consonant after a nasal sound () is hypothesized to have been an active phonological rule up through Early Middle Japanese; in Late Middle Japanese, were denasalized and voicing after ceased to be automatic.

====Gairaigo====

&quot;Gairaigo&quot; vocabulary is usually not affected by rendaku when it occurs as the second element of a compound, as illustrated by the contrast between &#x27;glass shelf&#x27;, from native Japanese &#x27;shelf&#x27;, and &#x27;glass case&#x27;, from foreign &#x27;case&#x27;: rendaku does not occur and is not expected to occur in the latter compound word, since its non-initial element belongings to foreign vocabulary. (In contrast, as shown by , the use of a &quot;gairaigo&quot; word as the first element of a compound does not prevent rendaku of a following native element.) Examples where rendaku affects a &quot;gairaigo&quot; element of a compound are highly exceptional.

===Part of speech===

Rendaku affects compounds involving various parts of speech, such as Noun + Verb, Adjective + Noun, Verb + Noun, Verb + Adjective; however, it is rare in compounds of the form Verb + Verb.





===Reduplication===
Rendaku is very frequent in words formed by reduplication, other than mimetic words, which are immune to rendaku.

Examples:
: (iteration)
:: &quot;hito&quot; + &quot;hito&quot; → &quot;hitobito&quot; (&quot;person&quot; + &quot;person&quot; → &quot;people&quot;)
: (iteration)
:: &quot;toki&quot; + &quot;toki&quot; → &quot;tokidoki&quot; (&quot;time&quot; + &quot;time&quot; → &quot;sometimes&quot;)

===Semantics===
&quot;Rendaku&quot; tends not to occur in non-reduplicative compounds which have the semantic value of &quot;X and Y&quot; (so-called dvandva or copulative compounds), as exemplified by &quot;yama&quot; + &quot;kawa&quot; &gt; &quot;yamakawa&quot; &quot;mountains and rivers&quot;, as opposed to &quot;yama&quot; + &quot;kawa&quot; &gt; &quot;yamagawa&quot; &quot;mountain river&quot;.

===Branching compounds===

In compounds containing more than two elements (or rather, compounds where one element is itself a compound), the branching structure of the compound may affect the application of rendaku. For example, , a compound of the morphemes &quot;door&quot; and &quot;shelf&quot;, retains its initial voiceless when used as the second element of the compound &quot;small cupboard&quot;. In examples like this, where the second element contains a voiced consonant as a result of rendaku, the lack of voicing at the start of the second element of the larger compound can potentially be explained as a consequence of Lyman&#x27;s law.

 proposed that rendaku is blocked in general in the left-branching elements of a right-branching compound, even in cases where Lyman&#x27;s law does not apply. However, other linguists have questioned the validity or necessity of formulating such a constraint. The branching constraint is intended to explain the contrasting behavior of examples such as the following:
:&quot;mon&quot; + [&quot;shiro&quot; + &quot;chō&quot;] &gt; &quot;monshirochō&quot;, not *&quot;monjirochō&quot; (&quot;family crest&quot; + [&quot;white&quot; + &quot;butterfly&quot;] &gt; &quot;cabbage butterfly&quot;)
but
:[&quot;o&quot; + &quot;shiro&quot;] + &quot;washi&quot; &gt; &quot;ojirowashi&quot; ([&quot;tail&quot; + &quot;white&quot;] + &quot;eagle&quot; &gt; &quot;white-tailed eagle&quot;)

This constraint does not apply to all words where the second element is composed of more than one morpheme. As discussed above, rendaku can affect Sino-Japanese &quot;binoms&quot; composed of two Sino-Japanese roots. Assuming the branching constraint is valid, it is possible it does not prevent rendaku in that context because Sino-Japanese binoms do not have the morphological status of compound words in the context of rendaku. In any case, there seem to be some counterexamples to the branching constraint, such as &#x27;big talk&#x27;, from &#x27;big&#x27; + , from &#x27; bath&#x27; + &#x27;carpet&#x27;, or &#x27;fire brigade for common people&#x27;, from &#x27;town&#x27; + , from &#x27;fire&#x27; + &#x27;to extinguish&#x27;. One proposal accounts for such apparent counterexamples by postulating a distinction between &quot;loose&quot; compounds, which are hypothesized to be immune to rendaku per the branching rule when used as the right-hand element of a larger compound, and &quot;strict&quot; compounds, which can undergo rendaku the same way as single morphemes. However, it is not clear that there are reliable non-circular criteria for predicting whether a compound is &quot;loose&quot; or &quot;strict&quot;. Other examples of rendaku affecting &quot;multi-root&quot; elements that are themselves composed of smaller elements include the following:
:: &quot;oboro&quot; + &quot;tsukiyo&quot; → &quot;oborozukiyo&quot; (&quot;haze&quot; + &quot;moonlit night&quot; → &quot;hazy moonlit night&quot;)
:::Here, &quot;tsukiyo&quot; is composed of &quot;tsuki&quot; (&quot;moon&quot;) and &quot;yo&quot; (&quot;night&quot;)
:: &quot;iro&quot; + &quot;chaya&quot; → &quot;irojaya&quot; (&quot;lust&quot; + &quot;teahouse&quot; → &quot;brothel teahouse&quot;)
:::Here, &quot;chaya&quot; is composed of &quot;cha&quot; (&quot;tea&quot;) and &quot;ya&quot; (&quot;shop&quot;); &quot;cha&quot; by itself generally doesn&#x27;t undergo rendaku, but &quot;chaya&quot; frequently does

The branching constraint analysis could be considered a violation of the Atom Condition, which states that &quot;in lexical derivations from X, only features realized on X are accessible.&quot; An alternative view proposes that the process applies cyclically.
:[&quot;nuri&quot; + &quot;hashi&quot;] + &quot;ire&quot; &gt; &quot;nuribashiire&quot; ([lacquered chopstick] case, &quot;case for lacquered chopsticks&quot;) 
:&quot;nuri&quot; + [&quot;hashi&quot; + &quot;ire&quot;] &gt; &quot;nurihashiire&quot; (lacquered [chopstick case], &quot;lacquered case for chopsticks&quot;) 
This could be seen as the voicing between hashi and ire staying unrealized but still activating Lyman&#x27;s Law.

Ito and Mester 2003 proposed a third account distinct from both Otsu 1980&#x27;s branching-based constraint and Ito and Mester 1986&#x27;s cyclical account. This hypothesis holds that the relationship between branching and rendaku is not direct, but is mediated by prosodic structure: the lack of rendaku in right-branching compounds such as is analyzed as a consequence of coming at the start of a prosodic word. Per Ito and Mester 2007, whether a compound is treated as one or as multiple prosodic words is affected by the length of the second element of the compound: if the second element is longer than four moras (or two bimoraic feet), then the compound is required to have the prosody of a phrase rather than a single word.

===Further considerations===
Despite a number of rules which have been formulated to help explain the distribution of the effect of &quot;rendaku&quot;, there still remain many examples of words in which &quot;rendaku&quot; manifests in ways currently unpredictable. Some instances are linked with a lexical property as noted above but others may obey laws yet to be discovered. &quot;Rendaku&quot; thus remains partially unpredictable, sometimes presenting a problem even to native speakers, particularly in Japanese names, where &quot;rendaku&quot; occurs or fails to occur often without obvious cause. In many cases, an identically written name may either have or not have &quot;rendaku&quot;, depending on the person. For example, may be read in a number of ways, including both and .

In some cases, &quot;rendaku&quot; varies depending on syntax. For instance, the suffix , from , is pronounced as following the perfective verb, as in , but is pronounced as when following a noun, as in or, semantically differently – more concretely – .

====Lexical propensity====

It has been hypothesized that morphemes are inherently either more susceptible or more resistant to being voiced when used as the second element of a compound; in other words, that the propensity of a morpheme to undergo rendaku is lexically specified. Some morphemes show voicing in all compounds in which they occur. At the far end of the spectrum, a small percentage of morphemes appear to be immune to rendaku (for reasons not explained by the phonological, morphosyntactic, and lexical-stratum factors described above that regularly block rendaku). Other morphemes are intermediate and undergo voicing in some but not all compounds. found that out of elements that occurred at least 5 times in second position in a database of frequent compound words, the most common behavior (42%) was to undergo voicing in all compounds, and each range of greater resistance to rendaku contained successively fewer elements (35% had voicing rates from 0.667 to 0.999; 12% had voicing rates from 0.334 to 0.666; 7% had voicing rates from 0.001 to 0.333, and 5% were never voiced).

 suggests that the first element of compound words also has a lexically variable propensity to trigger rendaku, hypothesizing that rendaku occurs in words where the combination of these two voicing weights (the rendaku-triggering weight of the first element and the rendaku-undergoing weight of the second element) exceeds a threshold value, and fails to occur when this value falls below the threshold.

====Avoidance of bVmV====
Rendaku seems to be avoided in non-verbal elements that start with or + vowel + + vowel, such as , which has been explained as an effect of a preference against having homorganic consonants at the start of adjacent syllables: rendaku would replace or with , which is bilabial like . Rendaku is seen before vowel + + vowel in &#x27;love letter&#x27; from &#x27;letter&#x27;: this is consistent with the hypothesis, since contains , which is already homorganic with (and so avoiding rendaku would not make any difference). (An alternative explanation supposes that , as well as other words that undergo rendaku to , starts with an underlying labial consonant that is phonologically distinct from the found at the start of lexemes that do not undergo rendaku.)

A study observed this tendency as an active factor affecting the frequency with which Japanese speakers preferred rendaku vs. non-rendaku variants of nonce words.

For whatever reason, this avoidance is not seen in verb roots (including deverbal nouns), which undergo rendaku even in cases such as &#x27;to corrupt&#x27;.

No comparable effect is seen with other consonant sounds that undergo rendaku, since they retain the same place of articulation after the change.

== Productivity ==

Although rendaku does not occur in all compounds, it is common and studies of Japanese native speakers show that it occurs often in newly formed compounds. It has been suggested that its productivity in new compounds is caused by analogy with existing compound words.

=== Acquisition by children ===

Some studies have examined the phonological development of rendaku. Studies from the late 1990s and early 2000s indicate that children under five and a half years old show limited use of rendaku in any context. The use of rendaku in established compounds becomes frequent by the age of six, but children below this age do not show reliable use of rendaku in unfamiliar compounds. Children over the age of six use rendaku frequently both in familiar and unfamiliar compounds.

== Theoretical analysis ==

In linguistics, rendaku has been analyzed in terms of various phonological theories. It has been popular to identify Lyman&#x27;s Law, the restriction against applying rendaku to a morpheme that already contains a voiced obstruent phoneme, as an example of a more general theoretical concept known as the obligatory contour principle (or &quot;OCP&quot; for short). This principle was originally formulated (by Leben 1973) to refer to the phonology of tone, and referred to a hypothesized constraint against having consecutive identical tones in the underlying representation of a morpheme. Later phonologists have interpreted the principle as a more general constraint, using it to refer also to bans on identical adjacent specifications of various non-tone features. Thus, Lyman&#x27;s Law has been interpreted as an example where the obligatory contour principle (OCP) applies to voicing specifications and rules out multiple occurrences of voicing within a morpheme.

== Historical origin ==

The voiced obstruent consonants of modern Japanese go back to prenasalized voiced obstruents of Old Japanese. Rendaku may have originated from the fusion of consonants with preceding nasal sounds derived from reduction of the genitive postpositional particle or the dative postpositional particle : for example, according to this hypothesis, a form such as might go back to an original &quot;mountain- bird&quot;. This explanation could help account for why rendaku is not found consistently in all compound words: if some compounds were originally formed with or , but others were formed with simple juxtaposition of two roots, then rendaku would be expected to have arisen only in the first category of compounds, but not in the second.

Whatever its origin, by the Old Japanese period rendaku had already become grammatically distinct from constructions with or , as shown by the occurrence of forms such as &quot;your bird&quot;, where a phrase with would be ungrammatical, since the genitive of the pronoun &quot;you&quot; was always formed with the particle .

== Rendaku in Tohoku dialects ==

In the Kahoku dialect of Tōhoku, the phonemes have voiced allophones when they come between voiced vowels, and the phonemes have prenasalized or nasal allophones when they come between vowels: for example, &#x27;target&#x27; is pronounced (with a second consonant that is voiced but not prenasalized) whereas &#x27;window&#x27; is pronounced (with both voicing and prenasalization of the second consonant). Thus, rendaku in this dialect, when it occurs, typically involves phonetic prenasalization of the second element of the compound, as is speculated to have been the case in prehistoric Japanese: e.g. &#x27;beach&quot; + &#x27;chestnut&#x27; → &#x27;clam&#x27;. However, the use of prenasalization at the start of the second element of a compound word is not uniform, and depending on the speakers and the words pronounced, significant variations were observed. There was a relationship between the rate of prenasalization and the speakers’ age: older individuals use prenasalized pronunciations at a higher rate than younger individuals. On the other hand, differences in the speakers’ gender and socioeconomic status did not affect the rate of prenasalization. It is speculated that dialect mixing with standard Japanese may have increased the use of pronunciations without prenasalization. In the case of , loss of prenasalization may also have additionally been facilitated by the fact that the resulting sound did not merge with any preexisting phoneme, since does not occur intervocalically in non-mimetic vocabulary (in contrast, in forms like [te̝ɡɑmɨ], the absence of prenasalization makes it possible to interpret the consonant as merely the voiced intervocalic allophone of , which would result in the phonemic transcription , with the same consonant phoneme as the independent word ).

A Tōhoku dialect spoken in Iwate Prefecture has been reported to have a phonotactic constraint prohibiting prenasalized obstruents from occurring in two successive syllables; this rule produces regular denasalization in &#x27;ceremonial fire&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;fireworks&#x27;.

<text>USS &quot;Donald Cook&quot; (DDG-75) is the 25th &quot;Arleigh Burke-class&quot; (Flight II) Aegis guided missile destroyer in the United States Navy named for Medal of Honor recipient Donald Cook, a colonel in the United States Marine Corps. She is the 14th of the class to be built at Bath Iron Works in Bath, Maine. Construction began on 9 July 1996, she was launched and christened on 3 May 1997, and on 4 December 1998, she was commissioned at Penn&#x27;s Landing Pier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

On 16 February 2012, Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus announced &quot;Donald Cook&quot; was to be one of four ships to be homeported at Naval Station Rota, Spain. In January 2014, the Navy announced that the ship would arrive there in mid-February 2014. In Rota she forms part of Destroyer Squadron 60.

== Upgrade ==
On 12 November 2009, the Missile Defense Agency announced that &quot;Donald Cook&quot; would be upgraded during fiscal 2012 to RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) capability to function as part of the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System.

In 2016, four destroyers patrolling with the U.S. 6th Fleet based in Naval Station Rota, Spain, including &quot;Donald Cook&quot; received self-protection upgrades, replacing the aft Phalanx CIWS 20 mm Vulcan cannon with the SeaRAM 11-cell RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile launcher. The SeaRam uses the same sensor dome as the Phalanx. This was the first time the close-range ship defense system was paired with an Aegis ship. All four ships to receive the upgrade were either Flight I or II, meaning they originally had two Phalanx CIWS systems when launched.

==Service history ==
===2010s===

On 24 February 2012, &quot;Donald Cook&quot; was awarded the 2011 Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; award. On 9 April 2014, U.S. military officials confirmed the deployment of &quot;Donald Cook&quot; to the Black Sea, shortly after Russia&#x27;s annexation of Crimea and amid the pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine. The U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s official statement said that the vessel&#x27;s mission was &quot;to reassure NATO allies and Black Sea partners of America’s commitment to strengthen and improve interoperability, while working towards mutual goals in the region&quot;. On 10 April 2014, the warship was reported to have entered the Black Sea. On 12 April 2014, an unarmed Russian Su-24 &quot;Fencer&quot; strike aircraft made 12 close-range passes of &quot;Donald Cook&quot; during a patrol of the western Black Sea. According to an allegation by a Pentagon spokesman, &quot;The aircraft did not respond to multiple queries and warnings from &quot;Donald Cook&quot;, and the event ended without incident after approximately 90 minutes.&quot; Further, &quot;Donald Cook&quot; is more than capable of defending herself against a pair of Su-24s. In 2014, Russia&#x27;s state-run news-media outlets ran a series of reports that falsely asserted that during that incident, the Su-24, equipped with the Khibiny electronic warfare system, had disabled the ship&#x27;s Aegis combat systems. The misinformation was later picked up by British tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot; and by Fox News, and later reported as Russian propaganda by &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

On 14 April 2014, &quot;Donald Cook&quot; visited Constanta, Romania, where President Traian Băsescu had a tour of the ship. &quot;Donald Cook&quot; then conducted various exercises in concert with the Romanian Navy before departing the Black Sea on 24 April 2014. On 26 December 2014, for the second time, according to the U.S. Navy, the destroyer entered the Black Sea to reassure and demonstrate U.S. commitment to work closely with NATO allies. &quot;Donald Cook&quot; participated in exercises with the Turkish Navy, including an underway replenishment and other exercises with the TCG &quot;Fatih&quot; on 28 December 2014. The ship visited Constanta, Romania, on 30 December and Varna, Bulgaria, on 8 January 2015. She also participated in exercises with Ukrainian Navy ship on 11 January 2015, and then departed the Black Sea on 14 January 2015.

On 11 and 12 April 2016, two Russian Su-24s performed several low-altitude passes on &quot;Donald Cook&quot; while the ship was conducting exercises with a Polish helicopter in international waters in the Baltic Sea, off Kaliningrad. A Russian Ka-27 &quot;Helix&quot; antisubmarine helicopter also circled the destroyer seven times. The U.S. Navy released photos and videos of the incident on 14 April, and the U.S. government lodged a complaint with the Russian government. In response to the U.S. Secretary of State commenting on the incident and saying that &quot;under the rules of engagement, that could have been a shoot-down&quot;, the Russian Federation Council&#x27;s official Igor Morozov said that the U.S. likewise &quot;ought to know that &quot;Donald Cook&quot; approached our borders and may already be unable to depart those.&quot; On 26 February 2019, the ship hosted U.S. diplomats Gordon Sondland, Marie Yovanovitch, Kurt Volker, the EU&#x27;s Jean Christophe-Belliard, and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, among others.

===2020s===
On 23 February 2020, the ship entered the Black Sea, marking the seventh time a U.S. ship had entered the sea in 2020. While in the Black Sea, the ship conducted routine maritime security operations. departed Naval Station Norfolk on 26 March, to replace &quot;Donald Cook&quot; as one of the forward destroyers located in Rota, Spain. &quot;Donald Cook&quot;&#x27;s new homeport was to be Naval Station Mayport.
On 25 April 2022, the ship returned to Mayport after a three-month deployment.

On June 12th, 2024, USS Donald Cook along with USS Truxtun, USS Delbert D. Black, Coast Guard Cutter, the Stone, and a Boeing P-8 maritime patrol aircraft were deployed to track a Russian naval flotilla sailing less than 30 miles off the coast of Key Largo, Florida. The flotilla was expected to arrive the same day in Havana, Cuba for naval and air exercises.

==Coat of arms==
=== Shield ===

He put the interests of his comrades before his own life. The crossed swords denote spirit and teamwork, as well as U.S. Navy and Marine Corps heritage. The U.S. Marine Corps officers&#x27; Mameluke sword is representative of Colonel Cook&#x27;s Marine service. The light-blue upside-down star symbolizes the Medal of Honor Cook earned for his spirit, sacrifice, and heroism.

=== Crest ===

<text>Värttinä (, meaning &quot;spindle&quot;) is a Finnish folk music band that started as a project by Sari and Mari Kaasinen in 1983 in the village of Rääkkylä, in Karelia, the southeastern region of Finland. Many transformations have taken place in the band since then. Värttinä shot into fame with the release of their 1991 album &quot;Oi Dai&quot;. As of 2009, the band consists of three lead female vocalists supported by three acoustic musicians. The vocalists sing in the Karelian dialect of the Finnish language.

In August 2005, Värttinä recorded their tenth studio album called &quot;Miero&quot; at Finnvox Studios, Helsinki. It was released on 25 January 2006 in Finland, and 30 January 2006 worldwide. In 2006, Värttinä also released the Värttinä Archive Live DVD, which included material from their 20th anniversary concert and other new and archive material. Värttinä collaborated with A. R. Rahman, a notable Indian composer, in composing the music for the theatrical adaptation of the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, which played in Toronto in 2006 and in London in 2007.

Värttinä has been featured in two episodes of popular animated children&#x27;s show &quot;Arthur&quot; singing their hit song &quot;Matalii ja Mustii&quot; from the album &quot;Seleniko&quot;. The song was also featured on the show&#x27;s first soundtrack, &quot;Arthur and Friends: The First Almost Real Not Live CD (Or Tape)&quot;.

The birth of Värttinä was heavily influenced by two sisters, Sari and Mari Kaasinen, from Rääkkylä. Guided by their mother, they had performed poems from the 1970s as a group named Tsupukat. After the group ceased in 1983, the girls established Värttinä, which they entered into a youth arts event and made their way into the finals. The following year they changed poem reading into singing, and this time the group won that same competition. In 1985 Värttinä, now having male members as well, made its first appearance in the Kaustinen Folk Music Festival. Folk music circles became aware of the band as the one singing &quot;korkeelta ja kovvoo&quot; (high and loud).

Sari Kaasinen had become the leading member of Värttinä, and children in Rääkkylä were eager to join the band; at its height, the group was accompanied by 21 children. When the group finally could not be made any bigger, Sari established a band called Sirmakka for the youngest ones wanting to join.

In the beginning of 1987 Värttinä was selected as the &quot;Ensemble of the Year&quot; in Kaustinen. Their first record, &quot;Värttinä&quot;, was recorded in the following spring. Instruments used were kantele, acoustic guitar, double bass, violin, accordion, saxophone, flute, and tin whistle. They gained more publicity and, according to a guess by Sari Kaasinen, made over a hundred performances in one year.

Their next album &quot;Musta Lindu&quot; was released in the summer of 1989. Playing skills and confidence had improved with experience, which can well be heard on the record. The pieces were Mari songs collected by Sari Kaasinen on her journeys; one of them was her own composition. Returning home from Åland at summer&#x27;s end, it seemed that Värttinä had come to the end of its journey. But the Kaasinen sisters, Janne Lappalainen, Kirsi Kähkönen, and Minna Rautiainen did not want to give up because they had just found their own way of making music, and the beginning of the &quot;new Värttinä&quot; followed.

=== New Värttinä ===
In the beginning of the 1990s, the whole aforementioned group had moved to Helsinki and started training at the Sibelius Academy. Sari started singing with the other girls, and the background line-up stabilized as consisting of Janne Lappalainen, Tommi Viksten, Tom Nyman, Riitta Potinoja, and Kari Reiman. Värttinä made a demo record which led to a recording contract with Sonet Records. The single &quot;Marilaulu&quot;, released in the autumn, increased the public interest even more, and the album &quot;Oi Dai&quot;, released in the spring of 1991, became the band&#x27;s breakthrough. They had now formed their style, which consisted of strong and energetic female singing, music pieces based on Finno-Ugric music traditions, and a band playing acoustic instruments. The style they created, mixing folk music into rock, jazz and popular music, was unheard of before.

The year 1992 brought a lot of concerts and the Emma Award, and some members were changed due to the tightening pace. In the end of the year, the album &quot;Seleniko&quot; was released with more compositions by the band than before. The record rose to the top of European world music charts and stayed there for three months. The album was released also in the United States, and the next year, when &quot;Oi Dai&quot; was released in the USA, too, the band started its first North-American tour. Music from the album &quot;Seleniko&quot; (an excerpt from the track &quot;Matalii ja mustii&quot;) was featured on the American children&#x27;s television show &quot;Arthur&quot;.

After &quot;Seleniko&quot;, Antto Varilo became the guitarist and Pekka Lehti the bassist. On &quot;Aitara&quot;, recorded in the autumn of 1994, Anssi Nykänen plays the drums, but Marko Timonen played them in concerts. The record made it to the charts again and it was remembered for the tracks &quot;Tumala&quot; and &quot;Outona omilla mailla&quot;. The band toured around the North America and Europe. Many were interested in the women&#x27;s distinctive way of singing, and they made an appearance on a record of Maggie Reilly.

Värttinä&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Kokko&quot; was released in the end of 1996. The familiar note &quot;trad.&quot; was not found in the credits of the pieces any more as all songs were written by the band itself. After the release of &quot;Kokko&quot;, Värttinä started its first tours in Japan and Australia, even though Sari Kaasinen had to leave the band for family reasons, and only three women were left as singers.

In August 1998 their seventh album, &quot;Vihma&quot;, was released under the record company Wicklow Records, established by Paddy Moloney from the band Chieftains along with BMG. Värttinä&#x27;s style can be said to have changed in &quot;Vihma&quot;. All compositions were made by the band&#x27;s male members, and they contained more complex changes in time and also the singing melodies became rhythmically more diverse. &quot;Vihma&quot; made it to the charts around the world like its predecessors.

During the winter 1998–1999 Värttinä experienced yet another change of members. Susan Aho, originally joined to replace Riitta Kossi (previously Potinoja), became a permanent front-row singer, and Markku Lepistö joined to replace her as an accordionist. Riikka Väyrynen replaced the singer Sirpa Reiman.

In June 1999 Värttinä was awarded the BASF Master Award, given to artists, producers, recorders and studios for records gaining chart success and at the same time displaying high technical and artistic quality. The award has previously been given to Metallica and Shania Twain. After the award Värttinä moved to the studio to record their next album &quot;Ilmatar&quot;, released in the beginning of 2000. &quot;Ilmatar&quot; took the experimental and diverse style of &quot;Vihma&quot; even further. &quot;Äijö&quot; became the most popular song of this album, featured by singer Ismo Alanko. During the year, Värttinä toured around Japan and Europe, ending the tour in the Savoy theatre in Helsinki, where a live album of the same name was recorded on 6 December. It was released in the beginning of the next year, simultaneously with the book &quot;Korkeelta ja kovvoo&quot; by Kimmo Nevalainen.

In 2001 &quot;Ilmatar&quot; was released in Brazil, and Värttinä performed in the Rock in Rio festival in Rio de Janeiro for more than 200,000 people. Värttinä&#x27;s line-up was changed again, when Johanna Virtanen joined to replace Riikka Timonen (previously Väyrynen) who had left the band, and Jaakko Lukkarinen replaced the drummer Marko Timonen.

=== Rebirth===
In 2002, the violinist Kari Reiman, bassist Pekka Lehti and original Värttinä singer Kirsi Kähkönen left the band, too. Reiman was replaced by Lassi Logrén, who had already been in the &quot;old Värttinä&quot; in his childhood. Hannu Rantanen became the bassist. Both had performed in the band before as substitutes. Värttinä thus started its &quot;third era&quot; with the singer trio Kaasinen-Aho-Virtanen. The first release with this line-up was &quot;Iki&quot; in 2003, when the band also celebrated its 20th anniversary.

Later in the same year Värttinä was invited to compose music for the &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; theatrical adaptation, based on the book by J. R. R. Tolkien. Värttinä composed music for two and a half years together with A.R. Rahman, coordinated by Christopher Nightingale. The musical, premiered in Toronto in 2006 and moved to London in May 2007.

In December 2005 Värttinä was awarded the Finland Prize, awarded yearly by the Finnish Ministry of Education for considerable artistic merits and remarkable professional achievements. In January 2006 Värttinä released their eleventh album &quot;Miero&quot;. The album was the band&#x27;s first one to be made under Real World Records, established by Peter Gabriel.

In 2008, Värttinä toured Finland, Sweden, Norway, Poland, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium, in support of their 25th anniversary CD. The concert in Tampere (Finland) was filmed by Filmiteollisuus Oy and was broadcast on YLE Finnish national TV.

In late 2008, a new Värttinä book &quot;Värttinä – Mierontiellä ja punaisella matolla&quot; covering the story of Värttinä until now was published in Finland. Janne Lappalainen and Markku Lepistö departed the band.

===2010s ===
In late 2009, Lassi Logrén and Antto Varilo departed the band. Accordionist and keyboard player Matti Kallio joined Värttinä.

In 2010, Susan Aho and Johanna Virtanen represented Finland at the Eurovision Song Contest in Oslo as Kuunkuiskaajat. Their song &quot;Työlki ellää&quot; finished 11th in the semi-final.

In February 2012 Värttinä released their 11th studio album &quot;Utu&quot;. The album reached number one on the World Music Charts Europe in May. In October, Värttinä received the Womex Artist Award 2012 in Thessaloniki, Greece. Later it was announced, that Karoliina Kantelinen would replace Johanna Virtanen in the lineup.

<doc id="678464" wikidata="Q3395223" url="?curid=678464" title="Atacama Desert border dispute">
<text>The Atacama Desert border dispute was a dispute between Bolivia and Chile from 1825 to 1879 for the territories of the Atacama Coast due to the different views of both countries of the territory inherited from the Spanish Empire. During the dispute, both countries signed Treaties in 1866 and 1874. The dispute occurred prior to the War of the Pacific, which settled the dispute in favor of Chile. Due to the surrender of land by Bolivia, the Puna de Atacama dispute was generated between Chile and Argentina and was settled in 1899.

==Origins==
The origins of the dispute came from the borders established in the Spanish empire that just defined the Atacama desert as the northern border of the General Captaincy of Chile. Bolivian and Chilean historians disagree on whether the territory of Charcas, originally part of the Viceroyalty of Peru, later of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata and ultimately of Bolivia, included access to the sea. Supporting their claims with different documents, Bolivians claim that it did while Chileans disagree. When Simón Bolívar established Bolivia as a nation in 1825, he claimed access to the sea, disregarding overlapping claims by Chile, which had gained independence 7 years before.

The border dispute between Bolivia and Chile grew slowly during most of the 19th century over the Atacama corridor, a part of the Atacama Desert which now forms northern Chile. The Atacama Desert is bordered by the Coast Range on the west and the Andes on the east. The geography of the area was a very large factor in determining how the border dispute began. Because of the mountains, the area has rains only 2 to 4 times a century, making it one of the driest places on Earth.

After the independence of Chile (1818) and Bolivia (1825) none of the following governments of both countries cared about defining its borders.
National boundaries in the Atacama region had still not been definitely determined when nitrate, silver and copper deposits were discovered in the area. Both Bolivia and Chile established competing claims for the territory. Other countries&#x27; interest was drawn due to the importance of nitrates in the production of fertilizer and high explosives; Britain, Spain and the United States had a strategic and economic stake in controlling the resource granting their support to the different parties. Chile&#x27;s influence grew in the disputed zone as miners, some of them backed by Chilean and foreign companies, started to advance northwards establishing mines and port facilities. Most economic exploitation of the coastal region was being conducted by Chilean companies and British interests, under the aegis of Chile&#x27;s more robust economy and more stable institutions.

== Boundary Treaty of 1866 ==
National borders in the region had not been clearly agreed until 1866; the two countries had negotiated a treaty that established the 24th parallel south as their boundary, and entitled Bolivia and Chile to share in tax revenue on mineral exports out of the territory between the 23rd and 25th parallels.

==The War of the Pacific==
On 27 November 1873 the &quot;Antofagasta Nitrate &amp; Railway Company&quot; signed a contract with the Bolivian government that would have authorized it to extract saltpeter duty-free for 25 years.

A second treaty in 1874 superseded the 1866 treaty, entitling Bolivia to collect full tax revenue between the 23rd and 24th parallels, but stipulating that tax rates on Chilean companies could not increase for 25 years.

In February 1878, The Bolivian Congress and a National Constituent Assembly found the contract incomplete because it had not been ratified by Congress as required by the Bolivian Constitution of 1871. Subsequently, the Congress would approve the contract only if the company would pay a 10 cents tax per quintal of mineral extracted.
Chile claimed that the border treaty of 1874 did not allow for such a tax hike. The company complained the increased payments were illegal. The company mounted significant pressure and demanded that the Chilean government intervene.

When the Antofagasta Nitrate &amp; Railway Company refused to pay, the Bolivian government under President Hilarión Daza threatened to confiscate its property. Chile responded by sending a warship to the area in December 1878. Bolivia announced the seizure and auction of the company on 14 February 1879. Chile, in turn, threatened that such action would render the border treaty null and void.

In 1873 Peru and Bolivia had signed a secret Treaty of Mutual Defense. In April 1879, shortly after becoming aware of the alliance treaty between Peru and Bolivia, Chile declared war on both countries. Within four years Chile defeated the joint war efforts of Bolivia and Peru. It ultimately led to the Chilean annexation of the Peruvian Tarapacá department and Arica province, as well as the Bolivian department of Litoral, leaving Bolivia as a landlocked country.
In 1884, Bolivia signed a truce that gave control to Chile of the entire Bolivian coast, the province of Antofagasta, and its valuable nitrate, copper and other mineral deposits. The two countries signed the Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1904, which made this arrangement permanent. Chile built a railroad connecting the Bolivian capital of La Paz with the port of Arica and guaranteed freedom of transit for Bolivian commerce through Chilean ports and territory.

==Chilean proposal of 1975==

In 1975, the Chilean government of Augusto Pinochet made a proposal to Bolivia consisting in a swap of a narrow continuous corridor of Chilean land from the sea to the border between Chile and Bolivia, running parallel to the border between Chile and Peru, making the Lluta River Chile&#x27;s northern border, in exchange for the same amount of Bolivian territory. The proposal, known as the Charaña Accords, involved former Peruvian land and according to the treaty of Ancón, Chile could not give former Peruvian territories to other nations without Peru&#x27;s agreement. The dictator of Peru Francisco Morales-Bermúdez was opposed to these changes but proposed to make Arica a territory governed by the three states. Chile responded that it could not accept this complicated shared sovereignty.
Since Pinochet was likely aware that the Charaña proposals would fail in the end due to Peruvian opposition, legal and political analysts have suggested that he raised them just as a gesture towards Bolivia.

==Recent history==
Bolivia still wishes for an Atacama corridor, which Chile rejects. In spite of this conflict, Chile grants unrestricted access to all kinds of Bolivian merchandise through the Atacama. The territories ceded by Bolivia and Peru contain some of world&#x27;s largest copper deposits. These are mined by Codelco - a state owned mining company which contributes a significant part of the Chilean state&#x27;s income.

Peru has ceded a small leased territory to Bolivia for sea access called Bolivia Mar, but Bolivia is mostly uninterested in it due to repercussions of Chile being able to assert that Bolivia doesn&#x27;t need any of their land for sea access.

During the Bolivian Gas War the dispute rose again as most Bolivians, including Evo Morales (who would go on to become president), opposed the future export of Bolivian gas through Chilean territory, which the government and foreign companies wanted. In 2004, the anniversary of the 1904 treaty, Bolivian claims were reignited, and the words gas-for-sea became the slogan of those who opposed exportation. The dispute became evident when the Bolivian president Carlos Mesa engaged in a public spat with the Chilean president Ricardo Lagos at the Organization of American States. Mesa, who was under pressure to speak out on Bolivia&#x27;s aspirations, put the topic before all the presidents of the Americas. The Chilean president reacted by mentioning Bolivia&#x27;s refusal to have diplomatic relations with Chile, and with this in mind he offered diplomatic relationships between the two countries &quot;here and now&quot;. The offer was hastily declined by Mesa who was not actually seeking an offer but intended to attract international interest to the situation.

Bolivian president Evo Morales decided to break off all dialogue with Chile on the maritime issue, opting instead to pursue the issue in litigation in international courts. He thus broke an OAS resolution in 2012 wherein the majority of member states encouraged Bolivia to pursue the issue via bilateral dialogue with Chile. Chilean president Sebastian Piñera pleaded with Evo Morales to continue with the dialogue but to no avail. The Bolivian government followed through with its determination to file a case with the International Court of Justice on 24 April 2013. Surprisingly, the case did not challenge the border treaties signed by both countries which Evo Morales has always been against. The basis of the case stemmed from two bilateral negotiations in the 1970s and 1950s where a sovereign route to the Pacific was allegedly promised by Chile but never eventuated. Bolivia argues &quot;the rights of expectations&quot; for their case which is a commercial law term that had never been used in the ICJ. In October 2018, the International Court of Justice issued a final and binding decision that Chile was not obliged to negotiate granting Bolivia sea access.

In March 2021, Bolivian president Luis Arce, on occasion of Día del Mar, said that the dispute is &quot;open and pending&quot; issue between the two countries and offered a nine-point plan to establish diplomatic negotiations with Chile to solve the dispute. The Chilean government responded that it was willing to establish dialogue but that the issue had already been settled by the International Court of Justice. During the 2021 Chilean presidential campaign, communist candidate Daniel Jadue argued in favor of a &quot;mutually beneficial&quot; agreement with Bolivia, in which territory would be ceded in exchange for Chile acquiring some gas and water rights. Jadue has clarified that he would only support such an arrangement were it to receive a democratic mandate through a plebiscite.

<text>Edwin Orr Denby (February 4, 1903 – July 12, 1983) was an American writer of dance criticism, poetry, and a novel, but is perhaps now best known for his work with Orson Welles in translating and adapting the 1851 French comedy &quot;The Italian Straw Hat&quot; to the American stage in 1936 in the form of the farce &quot;Horse Eats Hat&quot;.

==Early life, education and early career==
The son of Charles Denby, Jr. and Martha Dalzell Orr, Edwin was born in Tianjin, China, where Charles had been appointed as chief foreign advisor to Yuan Shikai a year earlier. Edwin&#x27;s grandfather, Charles Harvey Denby, who had served as the United States Ambassador to China for an unprecedented 13 years, died when Edwin was age one.

Denby spent his childhood first in Shanghai, China, then in Vienna, Austria, where his father served as consul general from 1909 to 1915, before coming to the United States in 1916.

He was educated at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Connecticut; and attended Harvard University, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but failed to graduate. He also attended classes at the University of Vienna, before obtaining a diploma in gymnastics (with specialty in modern dance) at the Hellerau-Laxenburg school in Vienna in 1928.

He performed for several years, notably with the Darmstadt State Theater and celebrated triumphs alongside Claire Eckstein, a German ballerina and choreographer.

Looking for someone to take his passport photo, he encountered photographer and filmmaker Rudy Burckhardt in Switzerland in 1934, and the two remained inseparable for the rest of Denby&#x27;s life. The following year, they returned to New York City, New York, and rented a loft for eighteen dollars a month in a five-story walk-up building on West 21st Street in Chelsea. 

Denby&#x27;s friendship with painter Willem de Kooning, who lived one floor below in the adjacent building, began shortly thereafter when de Kooning&#x27;s kitten turned up on the fire-escape outside of Denby&#x27;s window one evening.

==Writing==

In 1935, soon after Denby&#x27;s return to New York City, Orson Welles and John Houseman asked him to help translate and adapt &quot;The Italian Straw Hat&quot;, by Eugene Labiche and Marc-Michel, for the Broadway stage. The resulting play, titled &quot;Horse Eats Hat&quot;, was scored by Paul Bowles, and was performed as a Works Progress Administration Federal Theatre Production in 1936. Denby also appeared in the play, playing one half of &quot;The Horse&quot;.

During his lifetime, being ambivalent about the publication of his poetry, he was known primarily as a dance critic. At the behest of Aaron Copland and Virgil Thomson, he began writing a dance column for the magazine &quot;Modern Music&quot; in 1936. In 1943, Thomson drafted Denby as the dance critic for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;.

===Works===
His dance reviews and essays were collected in &quot;Looking at the Dance&quot; (1949, reprinted 1968), &quot;Dancers, Buildings, and People in the Streets&quot; (1965) and &quot;Dance Writings&quot; (1986). 

His small book on Willem de Kooning was published by Hanuman Books in 1988.

Denby&#x27;s works of poetry include &quot;In Public, In Private&quot; (1948), &quot;Mediterranean Cities&quot; (1956), &quot;Snoring in New York&quot; (1974), &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Complete Poems&quot; (1986).

His English translation of Lao Tze&#x27;s Chinese classic text &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; from a German edition was published as &quot;Edwin&#x27;s Tao&quot; in 1993.

Denby&#x27;s only novel, &quot;Mrs. W&#x27;s Last Sandwich&quot; (also released as &quot;Scream in a Cave&quot;) was published in 1972.

==Guggenheim Fellow==
In 1948, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship grant in poetry and dance criticism.

==Death and legacy==
On July 12, 1983, at the summer house he maintained with Burckhardt in Searsmont Maine, he committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills; he had been ill and increasingly concerned about the loss of his mental powers.

Denby was inducted into the National Museum of Dance&#x27;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame in 2002.

<text>Ningal (Sumerian: &quot;Great Queen&quot;; Akkadian Nikkal) was a Mesopotamian goddess regarded as the wife of the moon god, Nanna/Sin. She was particularly closely associated with his main cult centers, Ur and Harran, but they were also worshiped together in other cities of Mesopotamia. She was particularly venerated by the Third Dynasty of Ur and later by kings of Larsa.

==Character and iconography==
Ningal&#x27;s name has Sumerian origin and can be translated as &quot;Great Queen&quot;. While she was a major deity in the Mesopotamian pantheon and the worship of her is attested from all periods of history of Mesopotamia, her character was largely &quot;passive and supportive&quot; according to Joan Goodnick Westenholz. She was the tutelary deity of Ur. She shared it with her husband Nanna (Akkadian Sin). She was referred to as the &quot;lady&quot; (NIN; Early Dynastic sources) or &quot;mother&quot; (AMA; Ur III sources) of Ur. She and the city could be compared to a mother and her child in literary texts. She was portrayed mourning over it in laments, such as &quot;Lament for Ur&quot; or &quot;Lament for Sumer and Ur&quot;.

Based on some of Ningal&#x27;s epithets it has additionally been proposed that she was in part an astral deity, much like her husband. This aspect might have been reflected in titles such as Ninantagal, Ninmulnunna, Si-iminbi and possibly Kalkal, respectively &quot;high lady&quot;, &quot;lady, star of the prince&quot;, &quot;sevenfold light&quot; and &quot;treasured&quot;. 

Ningal&#x27;s iconography was not consistent. It has been proposed that she could be represented as a seated goddess accompanied by the lunar crescent, a symbol of her husband. A type of bird, &quot;u&quot;5-&quot;bi&quot;2, was possibly associated with her, though the evidence is inconclusive. Proposed identities of this animal include the greylag goose and the whooper swan, but it is assumed that even in Ur, statues of a goddess accompanied by a water bird of the genus Anserini, well known from excavations, were more likely to represent Nanshe. Ningal was also called &quot;zirru&quot;, a term which might designate a female bird. Some &quot;en&quot; priestesses of Nanna, especially Sargon&#x27;s daughter Enheduanna, were also referred to as &quot;zirru&quot;. On the Ur-Nammu Stele, Ningal is depicted sitting in her husband&#x27;s lap. This type of depictions was meant to display the intimate nature of the connection between the deities and highlight their ability to act in unison, and is also attested for Bau and Ningirsu. 

In medical treatises the term &quot;hand of Ningal&quot; referred to an unidentified skin disease; analogous names of diseases are attested for various other deities, for example Sin, Adad, Shamash and Geshtinanna.

==Association with other deities==
Ningal&#x27;s mother was Ningikuga (Sumerian: &quot;lady of the pure reed&quot;), as attested in a &quot;balbale&quot; composition and in an emesal love song. This goddess could be identified as a consort of Enki. The god list &quot;An = Anum&quot; identifies her with Damkina directly, though in its Old Babylonian forerunner she is a separate deity in the circle of Enki. Ningikuga could also instead function as the name of a manifestation of Ningal, addressed as &quot;the pure one who purifies the earth&quot;.

The lunar god Nanna (Akkadian Sin) was regarded as Ningal&#x27;s husband. Her role as his wife is the best attested aspect of her character. Some of her epithets underlined her connection to him, for example Ḫegalnunna (&quot;wealth of the prince&quot;). A derivative of Ningal were regarded as married to other moon gods in Hurrian (Kušuḫ or Umbu), Hittite (Arma) and Ugaritic (Yarikh) sources. In all of the corresponding languages her name was rendered as Nikkal, similarly as in Akkadian. The best attested children of Ningal and Nanna were Inanna (Ishtar), who represented Venus, and Utu (Shamash), who represented the sun. The view that Inanna was a daughter of Nanna and Ningal is the most commonly attested tradition regarding her parentage. The poem &quot;Agushaya&quot; refers to Inanna as Ningal&#x27;s firstborn child. Due to her identification with Ishtar, the Hurrian and Elamite goddess Pinikir is referred to as a daughter of Sin and Ningal in a text written in Akkadian but found in a corpus of Hurro-Hittite rituals. Further relatively commonly attested children of Ningal and Nanna include the goddesses Amarra-uzu and Amarra-he&#x27;ea, known from &quot;An = Anum&quot;, Ningublaga (the city god of Ki&#x27;abrig) and Numushda (the city god of Kazallu). In Neo-Assyrian sources from Harran Nuska was regarded as the son of Ningal and her husband. In a Maqlû incantation, Manzat (Akkadian and Elamite goddess of the rainbow) appears as the sister of Shamash, and by extension as daughter of his parents, Ningal and her husband.

&quot;An = Anum&quot; indicates that Ningal was believed to have a &quot;sukkal&quot; (attendant deity), though the reading of their name, dMEkà-kàME, remains uncertain. Richard L. Litke argued that the gloss is unlikely to point at an otherwise unknown pronunciation of the sign ME, and assumed that the deity in mention was named Meme, while an alternate version of the list had the name Kakka in the same line instead. proposes that this deity is identical with the divine messenger Kakka. Litke instead concluded that in this case Kakka should be understood as a deity elsewhere equated with Ninkarrak, distinct from the messenger god. A medicine goddess named Kakka, associated with Ninkarrak and Ninshubur, is attested in sources from Mari.

An association between Ningal and Ninshubur is documented in the Early Dynastic god list from Abu Salabikh. In the Old Babylonian period Nanshe was incorporated into the circle of deities associated with her in Ur, though she is overall sparsely attested in sources from this city. It is possible that the deity &quot;Nin-é&quot;.NIM.&quot;ma&quot;, best attested in texts from Larsa and the Sealand, was associated with Ningal as a member of her entourage starting with the reign of Kudur-Mabuk and his successors, though it has also been proposed that this name was her epithet.

==Worship==
Ningal is first attested the god lists from Early Dynastic Fara and Abu Salabikh. She is also mentioned in the &quot;Zame Hymns&quot; (from &quot;za3-me&quot;, &quot;praise&quot;), where she appears after Nanna as &quot;mother Ningal&quot; (&quot;ama Ningal&quot;).

===Ur===
A temple dedicated to Ningal was located in Ur, and could be referred with the ceremonial Sumerian names Egarku and Agrunku (&quot;house, sacred boudoir&quot;). In the earliest texts from this city, she is only attested in two theophoric names, but by the Ur III period she came to be invoked in them commonly. The Ur-Nammu Stele indicates that she was likely the highest ranked goddess in the local pantheon during his reign. A limestone bowl dedicated to Ningal by Ur-Nammu&#x27;s daughter , who served as the &quot;en&quot; priestess of Nanna, has also been discovered. Shulgi referred to Ningal as his mother. He also rebuilt the temple of Nanna in Ga’esh, Ekarzida (&quot;house, pure quay&quot;) as a temple of Ningal in which she was known by the epithet Nin-Urimma, &quot;lady of Ur&quot;.

The veneration of Ningal in Ur is well documented in sources from the Old Babylonian period as well. Anette Zgoll argues that her cultic importance increased compared to the preceding Ur III period. Shu-Ilishu of Isin mentions Ningal in a curse formula in an inscription found in Ur commemorating the recovery of the statue of Nanna from Anshan. Iddin-Dagan referred to himself as the &quot;beloved of Nanna and Ningal&quot;. , &quot;en&quot; priestess of Nanna and daughter of Ishme-Dagan, dedicated a statue to Ningal. Kings of Larsa, especially Warad-Sin and Rim-Sîn I, considered Ur a city of particular religious and political importance and were active worshipers of Ningal. Sources from this period indicate that her temple was combined with the Gipar, the residence of the &quot;en&quot; priestess of Nanna, into a single complex. The ceremonial name Egarku was retained for her major sanctuary within it, and appears in inscriptions of kings such as Nur-Adad and Warad-Sin. Another shrine dedicated to her in the Gipar was Eidlurugukalamma (&quot;house of the river ordeal of the land&quot;), rebuilt by Silli-Adad. The work continued under the reign of his successor Warad-Sin. Sin-Iddinam mentions Ningal alongside Nanna in an inscription dealing with the construction of the walls of Ur.

In the Kassite period, Kurigalzu I built another temple of Ningal in Ur, but its name is presently unknown.

Ningal was still worshiped in Ur during the Neo-Babylonian period. Her main temple there was rebuilt by Nabonidus. Additionally a &quot;bīt ḫilṣi&quot; (&quot;house of pressing&quot;), assumed to be a pharmacy accompanied by a garden where the ingredients for various medicines were grown) located in the same city in this period was associated with Ningal.

===Harran===
In Harran Ningal was worshiped in a shrine known under the name &quot;giparu&quot;. Andrew R. George assumes it was located in the Eḫulḫul, the temple of Sin located in this city. It is attested in sources from the reign of Ashurbanipal. An inscription of this king states that Ningal and Nanna crowned him in Harran. According to inscriptions of Nabonidus, during the repairs undertaken at his orders in the Eḫulḫul the temple was provided with refurbished statues of its divine inhabitants, including Sin, Ningal, Nuska and Sadarnunna.

Harran most likely influenced the Aramaic center of the cult of Ningal, known from sources from the first millennium BCE, Nereb (Al-Nayrab) located in the proximity of Aleppo.

===Other cities===
Offerings to Ningal are mentioned in texts from Nippur from the Ur III period. According to the so-called &quot;Nippur Compendium&quot;, she was worshiped in this city in the local temple of Nanna, as well as in a sanctuary referred to as &quot;bīt dalīli&quot; (&quot;house of praise&quot;) alongside Nisaba, Kusu, Shamash and Bēl-ālīya. A seal inscription from the Kassite period mentions&quot;Ningal of Nippur&quot; alongside the local goddess Ninimma.

From lower Mesopotamia Ningal was introduced to Mari, where she was already known in the Ur III period. In an early offering list she appears after Belet-ekallim and Lugal-Terqa (&quot;lord of Terqa&quot;). One masculine and one feminine theophoric name invoking her have been identified in Old Babylonian sources from this city.

A document from Old Babylonian Sippar mentions that statues of Ningal and Nanna were used as witnesses of a transaction. They were also invoked together on cylinder seal inscriptions from this city from the same period, though not as commonly as Shamash and Aya or Adad and Shala. 

References to veneration of Ningal in the Old Babylonian period are also available from multiple other cities, including Babylon, Isin, Kisurra, Larsa, Tutub and Urum. A joint cult center of Ningal and her husband whose location is uncertain was also patronized by kings of the Manana Dynasty near Kish. 

A single attestation of Ningal is known from the archive of the First Sealand dynasty. She occurs in this context as a recipient of offerings alongside Nanna. A settlement named after her, Quppat-Ningal, is also attested a handful of times in this text corpus, for example in a letter of an official named Nūr-Bau, presumably addressed to king or his successor Ayadaragalama.

The &quot;Canonical Temple List&quot;, which dates to the Kassite period, lists two temples of Ningal whose location remains unknown, Eangim (&quot;house like heaven&quot;) and Eengimkuga (&quot;house pure like heaven&quot;).

One of the inscriptions of the Assyrian king Esarhaddon commemorates the construction of a temple dedicated jointly to Ningal, Sin, Shamash and Aya in Nineveh. A shrine dedicated to her was also located in Dur-Sharrukin, a new royal city constructed during the reign of Sargon II. It was located within his palace. The king implored her in an inscription to intercede with her husband to grant him a long life and to guarantee his successors will continue to rule over &quot;every inhabited region forever&quot;. Ningal is also attested in a number of theophoric names from Assyria.

Letters from the reign of Ashurbanipal indicate that Ningal and her husband replaced Inanna and Dumuzi as the tutelary deities of Kissig in late periods. Nabonidus restored a temple of Ningal bearing the ceremonial name Eamaškuga (&quot;house, pure sheepfold&quot;) in this city, which according to Andrew R. George might be identical with Eamašku, attested in association with Inanna in earlier literary texts, including &quot;Inanna&#x27;s Descent&quot;. This event is commemorated by an inscription on a poorly preserved cylinder dated to 546 BCE discovered during excavations in Tell al-Lahm, which might be the site of Kissik. The king asked Ningal to intercede with her husband on his behalf in it.

Ningal was also worshiped in Uruk in the Seleucid period. However, the attestations are limited to a single source, the ritual text K 7353, which shows astrological influence, but ultimately remains obscure. She is absent from earlier Neo-Babylonian sources and according to Julia Krul presumably was incorporated into the local pantheon due to her status as the wife of Sin, similarly to other spouses, children and servants of locally venerated deities who first appear in Uruk in Seleucid sources.

===Outside Mesopotamia===
The cult of Ningal spread from Mesopotamia to other areas, including Hurrian kingdoms such as Kizzuwatna, as well as Ugarit and the Hittite Empire, where she developed into Nikkal. In Ugarit, where she could be referred to as Nikkal-wa-Ib, she belonged both to the Ugaritic and Hurrian pantheons of the city, and is attested as the wife of both local moon god Yarikh and his Hurrian counterpart Kušuḫ. In an Ugaritic myth she is associated with an otherwise unknown god &quot;Ḫrḫb&quot;, who was possibly regarded as her father and most likely originated in Hurrian tradition. Non-Hurrian non-Ugaritic attestations of Nikkal from areas where West Semitic languages were spoken in the second and first millennia BCE are very infrequent, though it might be the result of preservation bias. According to Gina Konstantopoulos, the distinct western form of Ningal might be mentioned in the treaty between Ashur-nirari V and Mati-ilu of Arpad.

In the east Ningal is attested in Akkadian theophoric names from Susa in Elam, with the oldest examples occurring in sources from the Sargonic period. Additionally, a chapel dedicated to her was maintained there by an Akkadian-speaking family, possibly originally brought to the city as prisoners of war after the Elamite conquest of Ur. They maintained it over the course of four generations.

In Egypt Ningal (or Nikkal) is only attested once, in a single magical papyrus, in which she appears as a foreign deity implored to heal a disease.

<text>Satsang () is an audience with a satguru for the purpose of spiritual or yogic instruction. The &quot;satsanga&quot; is a gathering of good people for the performance of devotional activities.

== Meanings ==
The word is derived from the Sanskrit &quot;sat&quot; meaning &quot;purity or truth&quot;, and &quot;sanga&quot; meaning &quot;in group or association&quot;. Thus the literal meaning of &quot;satsang&quot; is &quot;the company of Truth&quot;, but it holds multiple meanings within the Sant and Bhakti traditions of northern India. Charlotte Vaudeville defines Sant as a distinct tradition because of its emphasis on devotion to the Divine Name (satnam), the Divine Guru (satguru), and the importance of the company of devotees (satsang). &quot;Sat&quot; (truth) in Indian traditions refers to that which is eternal and changeless. Along with &quot;Cit&quot; (consciousness) and Ānanda (bliss), it is a quality of Brahman (supreme being). In this context, Satsang represents an experience of Brahman, particularly as the personal Lord residing within the human heart.

In bhakti traditions, satsang takes on a communal aspect, signifying gatherings of devotees for inspiration and focus amidst worldly distractions. It includes listening to spiritual discourses and singing praises of the divine.

The main purpose of conducting satsanga by any organisation is for marking an important event in its history. Participating in any satsanga is considered pious in yogic sciences due to its benefits in spiritual upliftment of an aspirant. Satsangs are generally conducted by any non-religious or spiritual organisations in large groups.

== Activities ==
The following activities may take place in a satsanga:

* Spiritual discourse
* Bhajans
* Chanting of mantras
* Meditation
* Tree planting
* Cleanliness programmes
* Spiritual stories
* Weddings

== See also ==
* Guru
* Rishi
* Pandit

<text>Anthony Philip Heinrich (March 11, 1781 – May 3, 1861) was the first &quot;full-time&quot; American composer, and the most prominent before the American Civil War. He did not start composing until he was 36, after losing his business fortune in the Napoleonic Wars. For most of his career he was known as &quot;Father Heinrich,&quot; an emeritus figure of America&#x27;s small classical music community. He chaired the founding meeting of the New York Philharmonic Society in 1842.

==Life==
Born in modest circumstances in Schönbüchel (now Krásný Buk, part of Krásná Lípa), Bohemia, Heinrich was given into the care of a rich uncle, whose thriving business empire he inherited in 1800. In 1810 he became stranded in Boston by the loss of his entire fortune in the Napoleonic Wars and the ensuing economic crash. Penniless, he resolved to take up his long-time avocation and become a professional violinist and conductor.

A formative experience for him was a 700-mile journey, on foot and by boat, into the wilderness of Pennsylvania and then along the Ohio River into Kentucky. The sights and sounds of the new American frontier inspired some of the most original, if not strange, program music of the nineteenth century. Settling in a log cabin near Bardstown, Kentucky (1818), he began to produce a body of work unlike anything being written in Europe at the time. Some of his works include: &quot;The Dawning of Music in Kentucky, or the Pleasures of Harmony in the Solitudes of Nature&quot; (Philadelphia, 1820); &quot;The Columbiad, or Migration of American Wild Passenger Pigeons&quot; (1858); &quot;The Ornithological Combat of Kings, or the Condor of the Andes and the Eagle of the Cordilleras&quot; (1836); &quot;The Minstrelsy of Nature in the Wilds of North America&quot;; &quot;The Wild Wood Spirits&#x27; Chant&quot; (ca. 1842); &quot;The Treaty of William Penn with the Indians&quot; (1834; a rare 19th century concerto grosso).

Shortly after his arrival in Kentucky in 1817, he conducted a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s First Symphony—only the second time a Beethoven symphony had been performed in the United States. He was identified as the &quot;Beethoven of America&quot; by one critic (1822).

Stylistically Heinrich&#x27;s music has more in common with other early American music than with the models of his European contemporaries. He shunned development, preferring episodic forms, especially the theme with variations, which he used to impressive expressive effect. He occasionally wrote passages of startling, even jarring, chromaticism, usually in an attempt to express an extra-musical idea. Often his music has an improvisatory quality (much of his music may be notated improvisation, considering its copious quantity). His generous allowances for performer interpretation are arguably the beginning of indeterminacy in American music.

Heinrich was successful in his European tours, undertaken because of a lack of competent orchestras in the United States in the period before the American Civil War. He nevertheless died neglected, in 1861 in New York City, in the poverty he had fled.

Occasionally Heinrich&#x27;s music is revived.

<text>Edward Rudolph &quot;Butch&quot; Warren Jr. (August 9, 1939 – October 5, 2013) was an American jazz bassist who was active during the 1950s and 1960s.

==Biography==
Warren&#x27;s mother was a typist at the CIA. His father, Edward Sr., was an electronics technician who played piano and organ part-time in clubs in Washington, D.C; his uncle, Quentin — actually the same age as Butch — played guitar. The Warren home was often visited by jazz musicians Billy Hart, Jimmy Smith, and Stuff Smith. The first time Butch Warren played bass was at home on an instrument left by Billy Taylor, who had played bass for Duke Ellington. Warren has cited Jimmy Blanton, the innovative and virtuoso bassist with Ellington from 1939 to 1941, as his biggest inspiration.

Warren began playing professionally at age 14 in a Washington, D.C. band led by his father. He later worked with other local groups, including that of Stuff Smith, as well as with altoist and bandleader Rick Henderson at the Howard Theatre.

When he was 19, he sat in with Kenny Dorham to substitute for an absent bassist. A few days later, Dorham invited him to New York City, where he spent the next six months as a sideman at a club in Brooklyn. He appeared on his first recording in January 1960 with Dorham, saxophonist Charles Davis, pianist Tommy Flanagan, and drummer Buddy Enlow. Through his friendship with Sonny Clark, he recorded for Blue Note Records in 1961 on Clark&#x27;s album &quot;Leapin&#x27; and Lopin″&quot;. Alfred Lion, producer at Blue Note, hired Warren to fill the vacancy of staff bassist. During this job he played on &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; with Herbie Hancock. As sideman, he also recorded with Miles Davis, Hank Mobley, Donald Byrd, Dexter Gordon, Joe Henderson, Jackie McLean, and Stanley Turrentine.

Mental illness and heroin addiction created problems for Warren. In 1963, his friend Sonny Clark died of an overdose. Months later, Thelonious Monk hired the 23-year-old Warren. Monk&#x27;s band was surrounded by drugs and Warren quit after a yearlong tour. Moving back to D.C., he admitted himself to St. Elizabeths Hospital. He was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

Following the onset of his illness he played professionally only occasionally, including a regular gig at the jazz club Columbia Station in Washington D.C.

His only solo effort was captured on &quot;Butch&#x27;s Blues&quot; but he was better known as a sideman on many albums, including Dexter Gordon&#x27;s &quot;Go&quot;.

He died of lung cancer in Silver Spring, Maryland at the age of 74.

<text>Civaka Cintamani (), also spelled as Jivaka Chintamani, is one of the five great Tamil epics. Authored by a Madurai-based Jain ascetic Tiruttakkatēvar in the early 10th century, the epic is a story of a prince who is the perfect master of all arts, perfect warrior and perfect lover with numerous wives. The &quot;Civaka Cintamani&quot; is also called the Mana Nool (). The epic is organized into 13 cantos and contains 3,145 quatrains in &quot;viruttam&quot; poetic meter. Its Jain author is credited with 2,700 of these quatrains, the rest by his &quot;guru&quot; and another anonymous author.

The epic begins with the story of a treacherous coup, where the king helps his pregnant queen escape in a peacock-shaped flying machine but is himself killed. The queen gives birth to a boy. She hands him over to a loyal servant to raise, becoming a nun herself. The boy, Jivaka, grows up into a man, rather a superman, one who is perfect in every art, every skill, every field of knowledge. He excels in war and erotics, kills his enemies, wins over and marries every pretty girl he meets, then regains the kingdom his father had lost. After enjoying power, sex and begetting many sons with his numerous wives, the epic ends with him renouncing the world and becoming a Jain ascetic.

The Tamil epic &quot;Civakacintamani&quot; is probably a compilation of many older, fantasy-filled unreal Tamil folk stories. The poet skillfully couples the martial adventures of the extraordinarily talented superman with graphic sexual descriptions of his affairs, along with lyrical interludes of his virtues such as kindness, duty, tenderness and affection for all living beings. The epic&#x27;s love scenes are sensuous and loaded with double entendre and metaphors. The poetic style of the &quot;Civakacintamani&quot; epic is found in Tamil poetic literature that followed among Hindu and Jain scholars, attesting to its literary significance.

Portions of the epic were ceremonially recited by members of the Tamil Jain community in the 19th century. Rare copies of its palm-leaf manuscripts were preserved by Tamil Hindus. U V Swaminatha Aiyar – a Shaiva pundit and Tamil scholar, discovered two copies of it in 1880 at the encouragement of the chief abbot of a Shaiva Hindu monastery in Kumbhakonam, one copy given by Tamil enthusiast Ramaswami Mutaliyar and the other by the monastery. Aiyar studied the epic&#x27;s manuscripts under oil lamps, with guidance from Appasami Nayinar – a Jaina community leader, established a critical edition and published the first paper version of the epic in 1887.

==Author and date==

&quot;Civaka Cintamani&quot; – as it has survived into the modern era – is an epic of 3,145 stanzas, each stanza of four highly lyrical lines. According to the final verses of the epic, it consists of 2,700 (86%) verses. According to the 14th-century Naccinarkkiniyar commentary, the 2,700 verses were composed by Thiruthakkadevar (Tiruttakkatevar) of the Chola race who in his youth became a Jain ascetic and moved to Madurai. The authorship of the remaining quatrains is unknown. According to a Jain tradition, 2 of the quatrains were composed by the teacher and counselor of Thiruthakkadevar, while the rest were anonymously added. The larger Tamil tradition believes that 445 quatrains were composed by Kantiyar, a poetess and inserted into the original. The entire epic is sometimes credited to just Thiruthakkadevar by casual writers.

Some non-Jaina Tamil poets, states Zvelebil, have questioned whether Thiruthakkadevar was really a Jain ascetic, since one of the mandatory five &quot;mahāvratas&quot; (great vows) for ascetics in Jainism is strict abstinence from sex in &quot;action, words and thought&quot;, but the epic is loaded with sexually-explicit verses. According to the tradition, Thiruthakkadevar proved his ascetic purity by an ordeal.

According to a note in 1857 by the colonial-era missionary P Percival, his acquaintances informed him that Thiruthakkadevar, also called Tirudevar, was a learned Jain scholar who lived 2,000 years ago, and who was acquainted with &quot;Akattiyam&quot; and &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;, the celebrated Tamil grammar works. He is also believed to have deep acquaintance in Sanskrit and Vedas. His epic, said Percival, was quoted by Tamil grammarians because it was believed to be of &quot;undoubted authority&quot; on Tamil language.

Later Tamil literature scholarship places Thiruthakkadevar about 1,000 years later than Percival&#x27;s colonial-era note. The story in &quot;Civakacintamani&quot;, states Kamil Zvelebil, is the story found in the older Sanskrit text &quot;Kshattracudamani&quot; by Vadibhasinha, which itself was based on Gunabhadra&#x27;s &quot;Uttarapurana&quot;. The latter text can be firmly dated to 897–898 CE (derived from Hindu calendar) based on the notes in its &quot;prasasti&quot;. Therefore, the epic was composed after 898 CE. It is now broadly accepted by scholars that the &quot;Civakacintamani&quot; epic was composed in the early 10th century on a foundation of the 9th-century Sanskrit originals.

==Contents==

The work contains 3147 quatrains and is divided into 13 cantos called &quot;illambakams&quot; (Skt: &quot;lambaka&quot;). The 13 cantos were summarized in 1857 by the Christian missionary Peter Percival as follows:

* Namagal &quot;Ilambagam&quot; contains 408 verses detailing the story prior to the birth of the hero, Jivakan. It also details his birth, his mother fleeing from the assassin who murdered her husband, the king and the rescue of baby Jivakan from the forest by a merchant Chitty.
* Kovindiyar &quot;Ilambagam&quot; relates to the exploits of young Jivakan; his bravery detailed when he attacks the gang of freebooters who loot the city; his marriage to Kovindeyar, the daughter of a citizen in the city named Pasukavalam who gets impressed by his bravery. The section has 84 stanzas.
* Kandarvatatteyar &quot;Illambagam&quot; is derived from the celebrated musician, Tatteyar whose skill on Veena, an Indian string instrument was almost unrivalled. She was resolute not to marry anyone until her challenge is surpassed. Jivaka won the competition. She and Jivaka marry. The events are accounted in 358 stanzas in this section.
* Gundmaleyar &quot;Ilambagam&quot; contains 415 stanzas and presents two young women namely Gunamelai and Churamanjiri of high family contended for their superiority in possessing scented powders. The identical scents were difficult to differentiate and when Jivagan did it, Gunamelai agreed to marry him. Sudarshana Jakshadeva, who got transformed to a dog due to a sin is restored to his former form by Jivaka. Chirumanji is rescued by Jivaka from an angry charging elephant.
* Pathumeiyar &quot;Ilambagam&quot; narrates the travel of Jivaka to foreign lands in 246 verses. Jivaka saves Pathumai when she was bitten by a serpent while collecting flowers. They get married.
* Kemasariyar &quot;Ilambagam&quot; contains 145 verses and it describes the visit of Jivaka to Kshemadesam where he performs austerities that gains him admiration from the king. Kshema Sundari and Jivaka get married.
* Kanagamaleyar &quot;Ilambagam&quot; depicts the hero in a place called Susandesam where the king suspends on a high mark, promising to give his daughter in marriage to the person who succeeds in displacing the mark with an arrow. Jivaka wins the competition and marries the king&#x27;s daughter namely Chisanti. The heroics is depicted in 30 stanzas.
* Kimaleyar &quot;Ilambagam&quot; has 107 stanzas, where Jivaka proceeds to Nanaadu where he meets his mother in Tandakarenyam and salutes her. When he returns to the city, a merchant, who gets wealthy on account of Jivaka bestows his daughter Vimalei in marriage.
* In the ninth &quot;ilambagam&quot;, Jivaka marries Suramanjari, who once vowed not to marry anyone during the perfume episode.
* Manamagal &quot;Ilambagam&quot; contains 358 stanzas and narrates the victory of Jivaga in marrying the daughter of his maternal uncle, the king of Videkam. Jivaka wins the competition of hitting the target with arrow and his fame spreads across. The assassin who killed Jivaka&#x27;s father plans to seize him and put him to death, but Jivaga wins and ascends the throne of his ancestors.
* Purmagal &quot;Illambagam&quot; contains 51 stanzas that narrates the conquest of Jivaka of the dominions of his father&#x27;s assassin. The country was called Emangadesam.
* Ilakaneiyar &quot;Illambagam&quot; contains 221 verses describing the nuptials of Jivaga and his maternal uncle&#x27;s daughter, Illakanei.
* Mutti &quot;Illambagam&quot; is the last canto of the epic. Jivaka renounces, partitions his dominions to his sons, and becomes an ascetic.

Percival noted that the Jivaka story is also found in the older Sanskrit Jaina text, called &quot;Maha Purana&quot; and that the Jains did not consider it to be a part of their 18 celebrated Puranas.

===Story===
The epic begins with the story of a treacherous coup by a minister of the king. The king had given temporary responsibility for the capital while the king and queen were traveling. The king helps his pregnant queen escape in a peacock-shaped flying machine but gets himself killed by the minister&#x27;s army. The queen gives birth to a boy as she hid in a remote cremation grounds. She hands over her baby she named Jivaka to a loyal servant to raise, becoming a nun herself. The boy grows up into a man, rather a superman, one who is perfect in every art, every skill, every field of knowledge. Jivaka the superhero excels in war and erotics, kills his enemies, wins over and marries every beautiful girl he meets, then regains the kingdom his father had lost. After enjoying power, sex and begetting many sons with his numerous wives, the epic ends with Jivaka renouncing the world and converting into a Jaina ascetic.

The epic concludes that all the worldly pleasures Jivaka enjoyed was nothing but illusions distracting him from the path of spiritual salvation.

==Significance==

The epic is unusual in many respects. Authored by a Jain ascetic, it presents a story that is unlike the generally accepted view of historic Jainism being an &quot;austerely ascetic&quot; religious tradition. The hero the epic, Jivaka, indulges in a life of sensual pursuits with numerous women, marries many women and carries out a sexual affair with a dancing girl without marrying her, violently kills his enemies including those who had participated or supported the coup against his father, seeks and enjoys power. Thus, his life is anything but one of non-violence, sexual fidelity, restraint and non-possessiveness – some of the traditionally understood virtues for householders in Jainism. Ultimately, the hero converts into a Jain ascetic, yet the epic writer is generally accepted to be a Jaina ascetic. The epic has explicit and lyrical descriptions of sensual gratifications and sex. According to David Shulman, the epic questions the long-held scholarly views of Jainism and the teachings of its most celebrated historic scholars. According to James Ryan, a proposed explanation is that the Digambara Jains were living with Hindus, the epic was influenced by the Hindu beliefs and outlook on life, and it reflects a synthetic work that fused the values and virtues of Hinduism and Jainism. An alternate explanation, states Ryan, is that the epic includes explicit eros and graphic descriptions of sex not to praise or recommend such values or practices in the way some early Hindu texts do, the epic includes this so as to examine and criticize it from the Jain perspective.

According to Arathoon, the work stands as a proof of secular outlook of Chola kings during the period. Though they were Hindus, they encouraged the Jain education and arts. The epic was influential on other Tamil poets, and it &quot;may have served as a poetic model for both &quot;Kamban Ramayana&quot; and Cekkilar&quot;, states David Shulman.

The epic hints of no persecution or violence between the Tamil Shaiva and Jaina community. Its composition, reception, and influence in the Hindu community suggest that the Jain–Hindu relations in the Tamil region were cordial and collaborative at least through the 10th century.

The Tamil epic is notable for the high number of Sanskrit loan words, likely because it is a late medieval text. It is also notable, according to Vaidyanathan for chronologically being the first Tamil text where the caste-related term Shudra appears (Tamil: &quot;cūttiraṇ&quot;) in verse 1287, line 4.

It is considered one of the five great Tamil epics according to later Tamil literary tradition, the others being &quot;Manimekalai&quot;, &quot;Silappadikaram&quot;, &quot;Valayapathi&quot; and &quot;Kundalakesi&quot;. In its form, it anticipates the Ramayana of Kambar. &quot;Cīvaka Cintāmaṇi&quot; was much appreciated by the Chola king who was its patron and was well received at his Chola court. It has been admired for its poetic form, appealing story-line, and theological message.

==Manuscripts and translations==
U. V. Swaminatha Iyer (1855-1942 CE) – a practicing Shaiva Brahmin and Tamil scholar, discovered two copies of the epic in 1880 at the encouragement of his &quot;guru&quot;, the chief abbot of a Shaiva Hindu monastery in Kumbhakonam. The first copy came from Tamil enthusiast Ramaswami Mutaliyar whom the abbot had introduced to Iyer (also spelled Aiyar), and the other came from the monastery&#x27;s large collection of ancient texts. The palm-leaf manuscripts decay and degrade relatively quickly in the tropical climate of south India, and must be re-copied every few decades or about a century, a step that introduces scribal errors. The two copies of the manuscripts were different, and one included commentary from the 14th century. Aiyar studied the two versions of the manuscripts under oil lamps. With help from Appasami Nayinar – a Jaina community leader, Aiyar established a critical edition and published the first paper print of the epic in 1887.

Between 2005 and 2019, James Ryan and G Vijayavenugopal published the English translation of &quot;Civaka Cintamani&quot; in three volumes.

<text>Precious Images is a 1986 short film directed by Chuck Workman. It features approximately 470 half-second-long splices of movie moments through the history of American film. Some of the clips are organized by genre and set to appropriate music; musicals, for example, are accompanied by the title song from &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;. Films featured range chronologically from &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; (1903) to &quot;Rocky IV&quot; (1985), and range in subject from light comedies to dramas and horror films.

==Production==
&quot;Precious Images&quot; was commissioned by the Directors Guild for its 50th anniversary. Workman had previously produced two documentaries, &quot;The Director and the Image (1984)&quot; and &quot;The Director and the Actor (1984),&quot; for the Guild. Editing took two or three months to complete.

&quot;Precious Images&quot; features half-second-long splices from approximately 470 American films. Chuck Workman described the film&#x27;s editing structure as &quot;a sprint. You take a breath and you &quot;go&quot;.&quot;
&quot;Of course, I had so many movies I wanted to include that the time constraint forced me to compress the film more and more. The cutting got faster and faster, but I realized that the film was still working. And I was moving things around, and it was &quot;still&quot; working. I started finding these wonderful little combinations of shots, the kind of edits that I&#x27;d been doing for years in other things, but suddenly in this film I wasn&#x27;t selling anything. It was a wonderful moment for me.&quot;

==Release==
&quot;Precious Images&quot; won the Oscar for Live Action Short Film during the 1987 ceremony, where it was featured in its entirety. In 1996, the film was reissued with new scenes from more contemporary films up to that point. It was also shown every 15 minutes within London&#x27;s Museum of the Moving Image since its 1988 opening, but this very popular attraction was closed in 1999.

The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival.

==Recognition==
In 2009, &quot;Precious Images&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

<text>Virgin Gorda () is the third-largest island (after Tortola and Anegada) and second-most populous of the British Virgin Islands (BVI).

==Geography==
Located at about 18 degrees, 30 minutes North, and 64 degrees, 30 minutes West, it covers an area of about .

The main commercial and residential area is Spanish Town on the southwestern part of the island.
An unusual geologic formation known as &quot;the Baths&quot; located on the southern end of the island makes Virgin Gorda one of the BVI&#x27;s major tourist destinations. At the Baths, in spite of evidence of the island&#x27;s largely volcanic origins, huge granite boulders lie in piles on the beach, forming scenic grottoes that are open to the sea. Granite is an intrusive igneous rock, thus not volcanic. It did form from magma, however, at great depth. Granite becomes exposed at the Earth&#x27;s surface only after geologic ages of erosion removes the overburden. At the surface, weathering has broken the granite into large boulders and rounded their surfaces. North of the Baths is the Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor, formerly owned by Little Dix Bay. The most notable ruin on Virgin Gorda is the old Copper Mine.

One of the great harbors of the world, North Sound, and historically Gorda Sound, lies at the northeast end of the island. It is bordered by four islands and connecting reef systems that keep the sound calm, creating one of the world&#x27;s great watersports meccas, with over of protected waters. At the eastern end of the sound is the premier anchorage, in the lee of Biras Hill (elevation ). The village, resort, and marina at this point (Jon&#x27;O&#x27;Point) is called the Bitter End Yacht Club, and runs for about a mile of coastline.
==History==
Christopher Columbus is said to have named the island &quot;the Fat Virgin&quot;, because the island&#x27;s profile on the horizon looks like a fat woman lying on her side.

Historically renowned, the anchorage off Bitter End was the site of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Hawkins&#x27; 1595 fleet rendezvous, two Elizabethan British admirals who led Britain&#x27;s ascendance into naval supremacy. Twenty-six ships anchored in the sound and used the large hill at Bitter End to practice for their attack on San Juan, to wrest Puerto Rico from Spain. With both admirals dying on the 1595/1596 voyage, the land at Bitter End may be the last place that these legendary mariners set foot on British soil.

==Transportation==
Marine ferry services from Tortola, St. Thomas, and St. John, as well as small commuter airlines, serve the island. In January 2010, Virgin Gorda Airport was restricted to a very small list of airlines by Air Safety Support International, the territory&#x27;s aviation regulatory agency, which demanded that the airport be brought in line with international safety standards. The airport reopened in December 2010.

Tourists travel from neighboring islands such as Tortola and St. Thomas by boat and then return to these islands by boat in order to travel on scheduled passenger airlines flights operated into the Tortola Terrance B. Lettsome International Airport and St. Thomas Cyril E. King Airport.

==Education==
The BVI operates several government schools. Virgin Gorda residents are served by Robinson O&#x27;Neal Memorial Primary School and Bregado Flax Educational Centre, a combined primary and secondary school that opened in 1982. In 2000 the government created plans to create a primary school on the island.

==Churches==
* St. Ursula&#x27;s Church, The Valley

==Trivia==
* A map with the outline of Virgin Gorda appears as the map of the Republic of Corte Maltese in the movie &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot;.

<doc id="678558" wikidata="Q944880" url="?curid=678558" title="Unplugged (Alice in Chains album)">
<text>Unplugged is a live album by the American rock band Alice in Chains, released on July 30, 1996, by Columbia Records. It was recorded on April 10, 1996, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Majestic Theatre for the television series &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;. The show was directed by Joe Perota and first aired on MTV on May 28, 1996. Home video releases of the MTV broadcast were released on VHS in October 1996, and on DVD in October 1999. The &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; was Alice in Chains&#x27; first concert in two and a half years, and contains live, acoustic versions of the band&#x27;s biggest hits along with lesser-known songs.

A new song, &quot;The Killer Is Me&quot;, was performed for the first time during the concert. The acoustic version of &quot;Over Now&quot; (originally released on Alice in Chains&#x27; 1995 self-titled album) was released as a promotional single in July 1996. The album debuted at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart, and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The performance was released on DVD on October 26, 1999, and re-released as a CD/DVD package featuring unaired footage on September 18, 2007. The home video release has received gold certification by RIAA.

==Background and recording==
On April 10, 1996, Alice in Chains resurfaced to perform their first concert in two and a half years for &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, a program featuring all-acoustic set lists. The band was offered to do the segment numerous times prior to the actual taping before finally accepting. The show was recorded at the Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Majestic Theatre and first aired on MTV on May 28, 1996. It was Layne Staley&#x27;s idea to have big candles decorating the stage to keep it dark and moody, as the band never liked bright lights on stage, so Staley himself bought the candles at Seattle&#x27;s Pike Place Market.

The performance was one of Alice in Chains&#x27; final appearances with vocalist Layne Staley and featured some of the band&#x27;s highest charting singles, including &quot;Rooster&quot;, &quot;Down in a Hole&quot;, &quot;Heaven Beside You&quot;, and &quot;Would?&quot;, and introduced a new song, &quot;The Killer Is Me&quot;. The show marked Alice in Chains&#x27; first appearance as a five-piece band, adding second guitarist Scott Olson.

Jerry Cantrell has attested to being fairly ill during the performance as a result of food poisoning from a hot dog consumed before the gig. Mike Inez&#x27;s bass had the phrase &quot;Friends Don&#x27;t Let Friends Get Friends Haircuts...&quot; written on it, directed at the members of Metallica who were in the audience and had recently cut their hair short. Inez and drummer Sean Kinney did pay tribute to Metallica, however, playing the intro to their hit song &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; just before &quot;Sludge Factory&quot;. Before &quot;Angry Chair,&quot; Jerry Cantrell paid further tribute by playing the intro to &quot;Battery&quot; going into the &quot;Hee Haw&quot; song, &quot;Gloom, Despair, and Agony on Me&quot;. This was omitted from the CD but can be found on the VHS and DVD. On the CD version of the MTV Unplugged concert, as Staley says &quot;Okay, that&#x27;s it,&quot; at the end of the song, booing can be heard (presumably due to the performance concluding). Staley responded to the heckler by shouting, &quot;Hey, fuck you, man!&quot; which was greeted by laughter from the audience.

Cantrell has stated that the band was considering playing the songs &quot;Love, Hate, Love&quot; and &quot;We Die Young&quot; for the set, but ultimately chose not to, chiefly as a result of limited time. Moreover, a few songs such as &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; and &quot;Sludge Factory&quot; had to be replayed numerous times due to error. Accordingly, the taping took approximately three hours to finish.

Cantrell said that one of his favorite things from the concert was when Staley said at the end of the show, &quot;I wish I could hug you all, but I&#x27;m not gonna&quot;.

==Release and reception==
A live album of the performance was released in July 1996, which debuted at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was accompanied by a home video release. The album has received platinum certification by the RIAA and the home video release has received gold certification by the RIAA. A full length DVD of the concert was also later released on October 26, 1999. The songs &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, &quot;Frogs&quot;, and &quot;The Killer Is Me&quot; were cut from the original MTV broadcast but are included on both the CD and home video releases. The album was re-released as a CD/DVD package on September 18, 2007.

The album initially received mixed reviews from critics. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote in his review of the album: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t offer anything that the albums don&#x27;t already. The acoustic arrangements of the harder songs sound like novelties, and the rest sound like rehashes of their previous work, only without much energy.&quot; Sandy Masuo of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote in her review &quot;Unplugged certainly reaffirms the emotional range and technical prowess of Alice in Chains. But it lacks electricity in more ways than one. The concentrated catharsis in Alice in Chains&#x27; music is still best heard with the amps cranked up to 11.&quot; Despite this, the album eventually gained more recognition and praise after the death of vocalist Layne Staley, mainly due to his powerful performance despite his condition, and is now considered an iconic live album. Alice Pattillo of &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; considers Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; as the best live album ever made.

==Track listing==
* &quot;Angry Chair&quot;, &quot;Frogs&quot; and &quot;The Killer Is Me&quot; were removed from the original broadcast, but are included in rereleases.

===DVD release===
* The DVD release shows another take of &quot;Sludge Factory,&quot; in which Layne Staley mixes up the lyrics at the beginning of the song which is ended shortly after. They then go into the &quot;formal&quot; take which was used on the CD. The DVD&#x27;s introduction to &quot;Sludge Factory&quot; also contains portions of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, written by James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, and Kirk Hammett.
* On the DVD, the final song&#x27;s title is listed onscreen as &quot;Killer Is Me&quot;, right after Jerry Cantrell introduced it as &quot;The Killer Is Me.&quot; Note that while the CD and the vinyl also list the final song as &quot;Killer Is Me&quot;, the DVD&#x27;s track list lists the song as &quot;The Killer Is Me.&quot; The song was also released in the &quot;Music Bank&quot; box set, where the title is again listed as &quot;The Killer Is Me.&quot;

<text>South India, also known as Southern India or Peninsular India, is the southern part of the Deccan Peninsula in India encompassing the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Telangana as well as the union territories of Lakshadweep and Puducherry, occupying 19.31% of India&#x27;s area () and 20% of India&#x27;s population. It is bound by the Bay of Bengal in the east, the Arabian Sea in the west and the Indian Ocean in the south. The geography of the region is diverse, with two mountain ranges, the Western and Eastern Ghats, bordering the plateau heartland. The Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, Penna, Tungabhadra and Vaigai rivers are important non-perennial sources of water. Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Coimbatore and Kochi are the largest urban areas in the region.

The majority of the people in South India speak at least one of the four major Dravidian languages: Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam. During its history, a number of dynastic kingdoms ruled over parts of South India, and shaped the culture in those regions. Major dynasties that were established in South India include the Cheras, Cholas, Pandyas, Pallavas, Satavahanas, Chalukyas, Hoysalas, Rashtrakutas and Vijayanagara. European countries entered India through Kerala and the region was colonized by Britain, Portugal and France.

After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after Indian independence, the economies of South Indian states have registered a sustained higher-than-national-average growth over the past three decades. South India has the largest combined largest gross domestic product compared to other regions in India. The South Indian states lead in some socio-economic metrics of India with a higher HDI as the economy has undergone growth at a faster rate than in most northern states. As of 2011, Literacy rates in the southern states is higher than the national average at approximately 76%. The fertility rate in South India is 1.9, the lowest of all regions in India.

==Etymology==
&quot;South India&quot; is also known as &quot;Peninsular India&quot; indicating its location in a peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. The term &quot;Deccan&quot;, referring to the area covered by the Deccan Plateau that covers most of peninsular India excluding the coastal areas, is an anglicised form of the Prakrit word &quot;dakkhiṇa&quot; derived from the Sanskrit word &quot;dakshiṇa&quot; meaning south. &quot;Carnatic&quot;, derived from &quot;Karnāḍ&quot; or &quot;Karunāḍ&quot; meaning &quot;high country&quot;, has also been associated with South India.

== History ==
=== Ancient and medieval era ===

Carbon dating shows that ash mounds associated with Neolithic cultures in South India date back to 8000 BCE. Towards the beginning of 1000 BCE, iron technology spread through the region; however, there does not appear to be a fully developed Bronze Age preceding the Iron Age in South India. The region was in the middle of a trade route that extended from Muziris to Arikamedu linking the Mediterranean to East Asia. Trade with Phoenicians, Romans, Greeks, Arabs, Syrians, Jews, and Chinese began during the Sangam period (c. 3rd century BCE to c. 4th century CE). The region was part of the ancient Silk Road connecting the East with the West.

Several dynasties such as the Cheras of Karuvur, the Pandyas of Madurai, the Cholas of Thanjavur, the Zamorins of Kozhikode, the Satavahanas of Amaravati, the Pallavas of Kanchi, the Kadambas of Banavasi, the Western Gangas of Kolar, the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta, the Chalukyas of Badami, the Hoysalas of Belur, and the Kakatiyas of Orugallu ruled over the region from the 6th century BCE to the 14th century CE. In the 15th century, Vijayanagara empire was the last kingdom to conquer all of Southern India. After repeated invasions from the Sultanate of Delhi, the Vijayanagara empire fell in 1646 and the region was ruled by various Deccan Sultanates, polygars and Nayak governors of the erstwhile Vijayanagara empire who declared independence.

===Colonial era===

The Europeans arrived in the 15th century; and by the middle of the 18th century, the French and the British were involved in a protracted struggle for military control over South India. After the defeat of Tipu Sultan in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War in 1799 and the end of the Vellore Mutiny in 1806, the British consolidated their power over much of present-day South India, with the exception of French Pondichéry. The British Empire took control of the region from the British East India Company in 1857. During the British colonial rule, the region was divided into the Madras Presidency (later, the Madras Province), Hyderabad State, Mysore, and the Madras States Agency (composed of Travancore, Cochin, Jeypore, and a number of other minor princely states). The region played a major role in the Indian independence movement. Of the 72 delegates who participated in the first session of the Indian National Congress at Bombay in December 1885, 22 hailed from South India.

=== Post-independence ===
After Indian Independence in 1947, the region was organized into four states Madras State, Mysore State, Hyderabad State and Travancore-Cochin. Dravida Nadu was a proposal for a separate sovereign state for the speakers of the Dravidian languages in South India. Initially, the demand of Dravida Nadu proponents was limited to Tamil-speaking regions, but it was later expanded to include other Indian states with a majority of Dravidian-speakers in the region. The States Reorganisation Act 1956, which created linguistic States, weakened the demand for a separate sovereign state.

The States Reorganisation Act of 1956 reorganized the states based on linguistic lines resulting in the creation of the new states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. As a result of this act, Madras State retained its name with Kanyakumari district added to from Travancore-Cochin. The state was subsequently renamed Tamil Nadu in 1968. Andhra Pradesh was created with the merger of Andhra State with the Telugu-speaking districts of Hyderabad State in 1956. Kerala was created with the merger of Malabar district and the Kasaragod taluk of South Canara districts of Madras State with Travancore-Cochin. Mysore State was re-organized with the addition of districts of Bellary and South Canara (excluding Kasaragod taluk) and the Kollegal taluk of Coimbatore district from the Madras State, the districts of Belgaum, Bijapur, North Canara and Dharwad from Bombay State, the Kannada-majority districts of Bidar, Raichur and Gulbarga from Hyderabad State and the province of Coorg. Mysore State was renamed as Karnataka in 1973. The Union Territory of Puducherry was created in 1954 comprising the previous French enclaves of Pondichéry, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahé. The Laccadive Islands which were divided between South Canara and Malabar districts of Madras State were united and organized into the union territory of Lakshadweep. Telangana was created on June 2, 2014, by bifurcating Andhra Pradesh and comprises ten districts in northwestern Andhra Pradesh.

==Geography==
===Topography===
South India is a peninsula in the shape of an inverted triangle bound by Indian Ocean in the South, Arabian Sea in the west, by Bay of Bengal in the east and the Vindhya and Satpura ranges in the north. The Narmada river flows westwards in the depression between the Vindhya and Satpura ranges, which define the northern spur of the Deccan plateau. The low-lying coral islands of Lakshadweep are situated off the southwestern coast of India and the Andaman and Nicobar islands lie far off the eastern coast. The Palk Strait and the chain of low sandbars and islands known as Rama&#x27;s Bridge separate the region from Sri Lanka, which lies off the southeastern coast. The southernmost tip of mainland India is at Kanyakumari where the Indian Ocean meets the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.

The Western Ghats runs south along the western coast from south of the Tapti River to Kanyakumari and forms a narrow strip of land with the Arabian sea called Konkan region. Anai Mudi in the Anaimalai Hills is the highest peak in South India. The Eastern Ghats run parallel to the Bay of Bengal along the eastern coast and the strip of land between them forms the Coromandel region. They are a discontinuous range of mountains, which have been eroded and quadrisected by the four major rivers of southern India, the Godavari, Mahanadi, Krishna, and Kaveri. Both mountain ranges meet at the Nilgiri mountains which run in a crescent approximately along the borders of Tamil Nadu with northern Kerala and Karnataka, encompassing the Palakkad and Wayanad hills and the Sathyamangalam ranges, extending to the relatively low-lying hills of the Eastern Ghats on the western portion of the Tamil Nadu–Andhra Pradesh border, forming the Tirupati and Annamalai hills.

The Deccan plateau is the elevated region bound by the mountain ranges. The plateau rises to in the north and to more than in the south, forming a raised triangle within the downward-pointing triangle of the Indian subcontinent&#x27;s coastline. It also slopes gently from West to East resulting in major rivers arising in the Western Ghats and flowing east into the Bay of Bengal. The volcanic basalt beds of the Deccan were laid down in the massive Deccan Traps eruption, which occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period, between 67 and 66 million years ago. Layer after layer was formed by the volcanic activity that lasted many years and when the volcanoes became extinct, they left a region of highlands with typically vast stretches of flat areas on top like a table. The plateau is watered by the east-flowing Godavari, Krishna, Kaveri, Penna, Tungabhadra, Vaigai rivers and their tributaries.

Other prominent features include the Gulf of Mannar, the Palk Strait, which separates India from Sri Lanka; the Ten Degree Channel, which separates the Andamans from the Nicobar Islands; and the Eight Degree Channel, which separates the Laccadive and Amindivi Islands from the Minicoy Island to the south. Laccadive Sea is a smaller sea. There are coral reefs located in the Gulf of Mannar and Lakshadweep islands. Large lakes include Vembanad Lake and Pulicat Lake.

===Climate===

The region has a tropical climate and depends on monsoons for rainfall. According to the Köppen climate classification, it has a non-arid climate with minimum mean temperatures of . The most humid is the tropical monsoon climate characterized by moderate to high year-round temperatures and seasonally heavy rainfall above per year. The tropical climate is experienced in a strip of south-western lowlands abutting the Malabar Coast, the Western Ghats and the Lakshadweep islands.

A tropical wet and dry climate, drier than areas with a tropical monsoon climate, prevails over most of the inland peninsular region except for a semi-arid rain shadow east of the Western Ghats. Winter and early summer are long dry periods with temperatures averaging above ; summer is exceedingly hot with temperatures in low-lying areas exceeding ; and the rainy season lasts from June to September, with annual rainfall averaging between across the region. Once the dry northeast monsoon begins in September, most precipitation in India falls in Tamil Nadu, leaving other states comparatively dry. A hot semi-arid climate predominates in the land east of the Western Ghats and the Cardamom Hills. The region – which includes Karnataka, inland Tamil Nadu and western Andhra Pradesh – gets between of rainfall annually, with hot summers and dry winters with temperatures around . The months between March and May are hot and dry, with mean monthly temperatures hovering around , with precipitation. Without artificial irrigation, this region is not suitable for agriculture.

The southwest monsoon from June to September accounts for most of the rainfall in the region. The Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon hits the Western Ghats along the coastal state of Kerala and moves northward along the Konkan coast, with precipitation on coastal areas west of the Western Ghats. The lofty Western Ghats prevent the winds from reaching the Deccan Plateau; hence, the leeward region (the region deprived of winds) receives very little rainfall. The Bay of Bengal branch of the southwest monsoon heads toward northeast India, picking up moisture from the Bay of Bengal. The Coramandel coast does not receive much rainfall from the southwest monsoon, due to the shape of the land. Tamil Nadu and southeast Andhra Pradesh receive rains from the northeast monsoon. The northeast monsoon takes place from November to early March, when the surface high-pressure system is strongest. The North Indian Ocean tropical cyclones occur throughout the year in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, bringing devastating winds and heavy rainfall.


===Flora and fauna===
There is a wide diversity of plants and animals in South India, resulting from its varied climates and geography. Deciduous forests are found along the Western Ghats while tropical dry forests and scrub lands are common in the interior Deccan plateau. The southern Western Ghats have rain forests located at high altitudes called the South Western Ghats montane rain forests, and the Malabar Coast moist forests are found on the coastal plains. The Western Ghats is one of the eight hottest biodiversity hotspots in the world and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Important ecological regions of South India are the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in the Nilgiri Hills, the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve in the Agastya Mala-Cardamom Hills and Gulf of Mannar coral reefs. The Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve covers an area of of ocean, islands and the adjoining coastline including coral reefs, salt marshes and mangroves. It is home to endangered aquatic species, including dolphins, dugongs, whales and sea cucumbers. Bird sanctuaries including Thattekad, Kadalundi, Vedanthangal, Ranganathittu, Kumarakom, Neelapattu, and Pulicat are home to numerous migratory and local birds.

South India is home to one of the largest populations of endangered Bengal tigers and Indian elephants in India, being home to one-third of the tiger population and more than half of the elephant population, with 14 Project Tiger reserves and 11 Project Elephant reserves. Elephant populations are found in eight fragmented sites in the region: in northern Karnataka, along the Western Ghats, in Bhadra–Malnad, in Brahmagiri–Nilgiris–Eastern Ghats, in Nilambur–Silent Valley–Coimbatore, in Anamalai–Parambikulam, in Periyar–Srivilliputhur, and in Agasthyamalai Other threatened and endangered species found in the region include the grizzled giant squirrel, grey slender loris, sloth bear, Nilgiri tahr, Nilgiri langur, lion-tailed macaque, and the Indian leopard.

==Politics==
Politics in South India is characterized by a mix of regional and national political parties. The Justice Party and Swaraj Party were the two major parties in the erstwhile Madras Presidency. The Justice Party eventually lost the 1937 elections to the Indian National Congress, and Chakravarti Rajagopalachari became the Chief Minister of the Madras Presidency. During the 1920s and 1930s, the Self-Respect Movement, spearheaded by Theagaroya Chetty and E. V. Ramaswamy (commonly known as Periyar), emerged in the Madras Presidency. In 1944, Periyar transformed the party into a social organisation, renaming the party Dravidar Kazhagam, and withdrew from electoral politics. The initial aim was the secession of Dravida Nadu from the rest of India upon Indian independence. After independence, C. N. Annadurai, a follower of Periyar, formed the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1948. The Anti-Hindi agitations of Tamil Nadu led to the rise of Dravidian parties that formed Tamil Nadu&#x27;s first government, in 1967. In 1972, a split in the DMK resulted in the formation of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) led by M. G. Ramachandran. Dravidian parties continue to dominate Tamil Nadu electoral politics, the national parties usually aligning as junior partners to the major Dravidian parties, AIADMK and DMK.

Indian National Congress dominated the political scene in Tamil Nadu in the 1950s and 1960s under the leadership of K. Kamaraj, who led the party after the death of Jawaharlal Nehru and ensured the selection of Prime Ministers Lal Bahadur Shastri and Indira Gandhi. Congress continues to be a major party in Telangana, Karnataka, and Kerala. The party ruled with minimal opposition for 30 years in Andhra Pradesh, before the formation of the Telugu Desam Party by Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao in 1982. Two prominent coalitions in Kerala are the United Democratic Front, led by the Indian National Congress, and the Left Democratic Front, led by the Communist Party of India (Marxist). For the past fifty years, these two coalitions have been alternately in power; and E. M. S. Namboodiripad, the first elected chief minister of Kerala in 1957, is credited as the leader of the first democratically elected communist government in the world. The Bharatiya Janata Party and Janata Dal (Secular) are significant parties in Karnataka.



C. Rajagopalachari, the first Indian Governor General of India post independence, was from South India. The region has produced six Indian presidents, namely, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, V. V. Giri, Neelam Sanjiva Reddy, R. Venkataraman, K. R. Narayanan, and APJ Abdul Kalam. Prime ministers P. V. Narasimha Rao and H. D. Deve Gowda were from the region.

===Administration===
South India consists of the five southern Indian states of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu, as well as the union territories of Puducherry, and Lakshadweep. Puducherry and the five states each have an elected state government, while Lakshadweep is centrally administered by the president of India.

Each state is headed by a Governor who is appointed by the President of India and who names the leader of the state legislature&#x27;s ruling party or coalition as chief minister, who is the head of the state government.

Each state or territory is further divided into districts, which are further subdivided into revenue divisions and &quot;taluk&quot;s / &quot;Mandal&quot;s or &quot;tehsil&quot;s. Local bodies govern respective cities, towns, and villages, along with an elected mayor, municipal chairman, or panchayat chairman, respectively.

====States====

* Andhra Pradesh was divided into two states, Telangana and a residual Andhra Pradesh on 2 June 2014. Hyderabad, located entirely within the borders of Telangana, was to serve as joint capital for both states for a period of time not exceeding ten years.

====Union territories====
===Legislative representation===
South India elects 132 members to the Lok Sabha, accounting for roughly one-fourth of the total strength. The region is allocated 58 seats in the Rajya Sabha, out of the total of 245.

The state legislatures of Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry are unicameral, while Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana have bicameral legislatures. States with bicameral legislatures have an upper house (Legislative Council) with members not more than one-third the size of the Assembly. State legislatures elect members for terms of five years. Governors may suspend or dissolve assemblies and can administer when no party is able to form a government.

==Demographics==

As per the 2011 census of India, the estimated population of South India was 252 million, around one fifth of the total population of the country. The region&#x27;s total fertility rate (TFR) was less than the population replacement level of 2.1 for all states, with Kerala and Tamil Nadu having the lowest TFRs in India at 1.7. As a result, from 1981 to 2011 the proportion of the population of South India to India&#x27;s total population has declined. Scheduled Castes and Tribes form 18% of the population of the region. Agriculture is the major employer in the region, with 47.5% of the population being involved in agrarian activities. About 60% of the population lives in permanent housing structures. 67.8% of South India has access to tap water, with wells and springs being major sources of water supply.

After experiencing fluctuations in the decades immediately after the independence of India, the economies of South Indian states have, over the past three decades, registered growth higher than the national average. While South Indian states have improved in some of the socio-economic metrics, poverty continues to affect the region as it does the rest of the country, although it has considerably decreased over the years. Based on the 2011 census, the HDI in the southern states is high, and the economy has grown at a faster rate than those of most northern states.

As per the 2011 census, the average literacy rate in South India is approximately 80%, considerably higher than the Indian national average of 74%, with Kerala having the highest literacy rate of 93.91%. South India has the highest sex ratio with Kerala and Tamil Nadu being the top two states. The South Indian states rank amongst the top 10 in economic freedom, life expectancy
., access to drinking water, house ownership, and TV ownership The poverty rate is at 19% while that in the other Indian states is at 38%. The per capita income is , which is more than double of the other Indian states (). Of the three demographically related targets of the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations and expected to be achieved by 2015, Kerala and Tamil Nadu achieved the goals related to improvement of maternal health and of reducing infant mortality and child mortality by 2009.

===Languages===
The largest linguistic group in South India is the Dravidian family of languages, of approximately 73 languages. The major languages spoken include Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, and Malayalam. Tulu is spoken by about 1.5 million people in coastal Kerala and Karnataka; Konkani, an Indo-Aryan language, is spoken by around 0.8 million people in the Konkan coast (Canara) and Kerala; Kodava Takk is spoken by more than half a million people in Kodagu, Mysore, and Bangalore. English is also widely spoken in urban areas of South India. Deccani Urdu a regional dialect of Urdu is spoken by the Muslims. Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Urdu, and konkani are listed among the 22 official languages of India. Tamil was the first language to be granted classical language status by the Government of India in 2004. Later Telugu (2008), Kannada (2008) and Malayalam (2013) were also declared as classical languages. These four languages combined have literary outputs larger than other literary languages of India.

===Religion===

Evidence of prehistoric religion in South India comes from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals, such as the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka, at Stone Age sites.

Hinduism is the major religion today in South India, with about 84% of the population adhering to it, which is often regarded as the oldest religion in the world, tracing its roots to prehistoric times in India. Its spiritual traditions include both the Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism, although Buddhist and Jain philosophies were influential several centuries earlier. Ayyavazhi has spread significantly across the southern parts of South India. Shaiva Siddhanta philosophy is prominent among many communities.

Islam was introduced to South India in the early 7th century by Arab traders on the Malabar Coast, and spread during the rule of the Deccan Sultanates, from the 17th to 18th centuries. About 11% of the population In South India follow Islam. Muslims of Arab descent in Kerala are called Jonaka Mappila. About 4% follow Christianity. Christianity was introduced to South India by Thomas the Apostle, who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and proselytized natives, who are called Nazrani Mappila. Kerala is also home to one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, who are supposed to have arrived on the Malabar coast during the reign of King Solomon.

===Largest cities===
The major metropolitan areas in south India are as follows:

==Transport==
===Road===
South India has an extensive road network with of National Highways and of State Highways. The Golden Quadrilateral connecting Chennai with Mumbai and Kolkata traverses Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Bus services are provided by state-run transport corporations, namely the Andhra Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation, Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation, Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation, Telangana State Road Transport Corporation, Kerala State Road Transport Corporation, and Puducherry Road Transport Corporation.
===Rail===
In 1832, the proposal to construct the first railway line in India at Madras was made. In 1835, a railway track was constructed between Red Hills and Chintadripet in Madras and became operational in 1837. The Madras Railway was established in 1845. The Great Southern of India Railway Company was founded in England in 1853 and registered in 1859. The construction on the first main line in the South between Royapuram in Madras and Arcot started in 1853, which became operational on 1 July 1856. Construction of track in the Madras Presidency began in 1859 and the link from Trichinopoly to Negapatam and a link from Tirur to the Port of Beypore at Kozhikode on the Malabar Coast, which eventually got expanded into the Mangalore-Chennai line via Palakkad Gap were opened in 1861. The Carnatic Railway Company was founded in 1864 and opened a Madras–Arakkonam–Conjeevaram–Katpadi junction line in 1865. These two companies subsequently merged in 1874 to form the South Indian Railway Company. In 1880, the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, established by the British, built a railway network radiating from Madras. In 1879, the Madras Railway constructed a line from Royapuram to Bangalore; and the Maharaja of Mysore established the Mysore State Railway to build an extension from Bangalore to Mysore. The Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway was founded on 1 January 1908 by merging the Madras Railway and the Southern Mahratta Railway.

On 14 April 1951, the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway, the South Indian Railway, and the Mysore State Railway were merged to form the Southern Railway, the first zone of Indian Railways. The South Central zone was created on 2 October 1966 as the ninth zone of Indian Railways and the South Western zone was created on 1 April 2003. Most of the region is covered by the three zones, with small portions of the coasts covered by East Coast Railway and Konkan Railway. In 2019, a new South Coast Railway zone was announced but is yet to become operational as of 2023. The Nilgiri Mountain Railway of Southern Railway is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Indian Railways under the ownership of the Ministry of Railways of the Government of India operates the railway system.

====Suburban and Metro====

Currently, operational metro systems are there in four cities Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi. Chennai Suburban founded in 1928 is one of the oldest and largest urban networks in the country. Opened in 1995, Chennai MRTS was the first elevated urban railway in India. Hyderabad MMTS was opened in 2003, becoming the second city in South India to have a local rail transit system. As of December 2022, South India has 205.06 km of operational metro lines and 16 systems.

===Air===

In 1915, Tata Sons started a regular airmail service between Karachi and Madras marking the beginning of air transportation in the southern part of India. In March 1930, a discussion initiated by pilot G. Vlasto led to the founding of the Madras Flying Club, which became a pioneer in pilot training in South India. On 15 October 1932, Indian aviator J. R. D. Tata flew a Puss Moth aircraft carrying mail from Karachi to Juhu aerodrome, Bombay; and the aircraft continued to Madras, piloted by Neville Vincent, a former Royal Air Force pilot and friend of Tata.

There are 12 international airports, 2 customs airports, 15 domestic airports, 5 state owned/private airports and 15 air bases in South India. Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kochi international airports are amongst the 10 busiest in the country. Chennai International Airport serves as the Southern Regional Headquarters of the Airports Authority of India, the Southern Region comprising the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, and the union territories of Puducherry and Lakshadweep. Four of the ten busiest airports in India are in South India.

The region comes under the purview of the Southern Air Command of the Indian Air Force headquartered at Thiruvananthapuram. In addition, the National Training Command is headquartered at Bengaluru. The Air Force operates nine air bases in Southern India. In the region, the Indian Navy operates airbases at Kochi, Arakkonam, Uchipuli, Vizag and Chennai.

===Water===
The region is covered by water on three sides and has a long coastline. A total of 67 ports are situated in South India: Tamil Nadu (18), Kerala (14), Andhra Pradesh (13), Karanataka (11), Lakshadweep (10) and Pondicherry (1). Major ports include Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Mangalore, Tuticorin, Ennore and Kochi.

The Kerala backwaters are a network of interconnected canals, rivers, lakes, and inlets, a labyrinthine system formed by more than 900 km of waterways. The Eastern Naval Command and Southern Naval Command of the Indian Navy are headquartered at Visakhapatnam and Kochi respectively. In the region, the Indian Navy has its major operational bases at Visakhapatnam, Chennai, Kochi, Karwar, and Kavaratti. Kochi Water Metro is the first water metro service in India launched in 2023.

==Economy==


After independence, the economy of South India conformed to a socialist framework, with strict governmental control over private sector participation, foreign trade, and foreign direct investment.

This Tamil literature includes the oldest grammatical treatise, &quot;Tholkappiyam&quot;, and the epics &quot;Silappatikaram&quot; and &quot;Manimekalai&quot;.

References to Kannada literature appear from the fourth century CE. Telugu literature adopted a form of Prakrit which in course of development became the immediate ancestor of Telugu. Distinct Malayalam literature came later in the 13th century.

===Architecture===

South India has two distinct styles of rock architecture, the &quot;Dravidian&quot; style of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and the &quot;Vesara&quot; style of Karnataka, Telangana. The Architecture of Kerala is a unique architecture that emerged from the Dravidian architecture in the southwestern part of India.

In Dravidian architecture, the temples considered of porches or &quot;Mantapas&quot; preceding the door leading to the sanctum, Gate-pyramids or &quot;Gopurams&quot; in quadrangular enclosures that surround the temple and &quot;Pillared halls&quot; used for many purposes and are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple usually has a tank called the &quot;Kalyani&quot; or &quot;Pushkarni&quot;. The Gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate at the entrance of the temple forms a prominent feature of Koils and Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the &quot;kalasam&quot;, a bulbous stone finial and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The gopuram&#x27;s origins can be traced back to the Pallavas who built the group of monuments in Mahabalipuram and Kanchipuram. The Cholas later expanded the same and by the Pandya rule in twelfth century, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple&#x27;s outer appearance. &quot;Vimanam&quot; are similar structures built over the &quot;garbhagriha&quot; or inner sanctum of the temple but are usually smaller than the gopurams in the Dravidian architecture with a few exceptions including the Brihadisvara Temple in Thanjavur.

Vesara style of architecture originated during the reign of Chalukyas and later adopted by Western Chalukyas and Hoysalas. The later Vijayanagara architecture incorporated the features of both Dravidian and Vesara styles. The temples at Mahabalipuram, Thanjavur, Gangaikonda Cholapuram and Darasuram, Hampi and Pattadakal are declared UNESCO World Heritage sites.

<doc id="678594" wikidata="Q5540206" url="?curid=678594" title="George Hancock (softball)">
<text>George Warren Hancock (1 March 1861 – 15 April 1936), after the time a reporter for Chicago Board of Trade, invented the game of softball in 1887. The first game was played, inside the Farragut Boat Club in Chicago. The first game of softball came from a football game between Yale and Harvard. When it was announced that Yale had won, Yale alumni, in excitement, threw a boxing glove at a Harvard supporter. The Harvard supporter playfully swung at it as spectators looked on in interest.

George Hancock shouted, &quot;Let&#x27;s play ball,&quot; and tied the boxing glove into the shape of a ball. The men chalked a diamond shape onto the floor and broke a broom handle to serve as a bat. This is credited as the first softball game which was played on Thanksgiving Day November 24, 1887 after a Harvard-Yale football game that had been followed by telegraph.

Hancock&#x27;s original game of indoor baseball quickly caught on in popularity, becoming international with the formation of a league in Toronto. That year, 1887, was also the premiere publication of the &quot;Indoor Baseball Guide&quot;. This was the first nationally distributed publication on the new game and it lasted a decade. In the spring of 1888, Hancock&#x27;s game moved outdoors. It was played on a small diamond and called indoor-outdoor. Due to the sport&#x27;s mass appeal, Hancock published his first set of indoor-outdoor rules in 1889.
